1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,458
We bring you the circus.

3
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:29,057
The pied piper, whose magic tunes lead
children of all ages, from 6 to 60,

4
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:34,344
into a tinsel and spun-candy
world of reckless beauty

5
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:37,772
and mounting laughter, whirling thrills,

6
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,314
the rhythm, excitement and grace

7
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:42,976
of daring and blaring and dance,

8
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,488
of high-stepping horses
and high-flying stars.

9
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,326
But behind all this,

10
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,118
the circus is a massive machine

11
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:56,500
whose very life depends on
discipline, motion and speed.

12
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,159
A mechanized army on wheels

13
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:02,209
that rolls over any
obstacle in its path,

14
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,503
that meets calamity again and again,

15
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,836
but always comes up smiling.

16
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:12,761
A place where disaster and
tragedy stalk the big top,

17
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:16,470
haunt the backyard and
ride the circus train,

18
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:20,398
where death is constantly watching

19
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:24,316
for one frayed rope, one weak link,

20
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:27,563
or one trace of fear.

21
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,196
A fierce, primitive fighting force

22
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:34,952
that smashes relentlessly
forward against impossible odds,

23
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,789
that is the circus.

24
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:42,043
And this is the story of
the biggest of the big tops

25
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:46,508
and of the men and women who fight
to make it the greatest show on earth.

26
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,472
- Morning, Mr. Braden.
- Morning, Nick.

27
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,596
- When's the new horse arriving, Brad?
- Tomorrow, Chuck.

28
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,351
Don't rub them thin, Jimmy.
Those bells are 60 years old.

29
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,437
They've rung in some good shows.

30
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,814
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Braden.

31
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:10,988
How are the kids?

32
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:14,825
Oh, just fine, except they were playing
with Randy Concello a few days ago.

33
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:15,993
That's nice.

34
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:18,204
Yes, but Randy came down
with the mumps this morning.

35
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:21,209
What? No. Any signs?

36
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:24,166
No, not yet, but baby
gorillas do get the mumps.

37
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:26,213
I'll have Higgins give
them a shot of immune serum

38
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,005
and double their cod liver oil.
Give them plenty of spinach.

39
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:31,383
You stay healthy now, boy, you hear?

40
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,879
Say, is it true were only gonna
play a short season this year?

41
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,517
Don't believe all you hear.

42
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:37,055
- See?
- Go back to Mama now.

43
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,720
I told you there was nothing to it.

44
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,738
- How's Myrtle?
- Stomach.

45
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,817
Give her some gin and ginger.

46
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:58,155
- Any news about a full season?
- You'll get a full season.

47
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,288
Be sure Myrtle gets all the gin.

48
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:09,962
- Same old trouble?
- Yeah. Sore throat. All of it.

49
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:12,508
Well, get a billiard
cue and swab it out.

50
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,177
Better feed your bird, Lou.

51
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:21,638
Hey, Brad, Betty in the cookhouse said

52
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,352
were only gonna play
the big cities this year.

53
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,814
And then close up like a misers heart.

54
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,566
Well, if they're giving
odds, bet a buck for me.

55
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:31,482
Why the rehearsal just for makeup, Brad?

56
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:34,943
Because you left off your eyelashes
last performance last season.

57
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,321
You're gonna need an extra shoe
walking back from Kalamazoo.

58
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:40,074
I'm supposed to be looking for you, Brad.

59
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,494
Well, are you supposed to find me?

60
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:44,288
Big brass hollering for you up front.

61
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,706
You found me.

62
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,920
Hey, Brad, this might help.

63
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:50,586
Too small.

64
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,679
Skim off the cream.

65
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,855
Let the little shows
scramble for the thin milk.

66
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,977
Don't forget what circus
day means to a small town.

67
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,310
John North, you're just
soft about the circus.

68
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,860
It's suicide to play this
whole tour this year.

69
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:14,692
- You gonna tell that to Brad?
- Yes.

70
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,776
A good circus boss carries out orders.

71
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:18,945
My vote is 10 weeks
and back to Sarasota.

72
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,069
But for 80 years...

73
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:23,996
That order about keeping the grounds
clean goes for the top brass, too.

74
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,460
- Hi, Brad. I'm sorry about that.
- Good morning.

75
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:27,703
I've seen happier heads on canes.

76
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:29,041
We sent for you, Brad, to tell you

77
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:30,958
we've got to pass up the
small cities and towns.

78
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,208
- Times have changed.
- Kids haven't.

79
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:35,378
- Prices have.
- Well stay in the black.

80
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:36,550
You hope.

81
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,556
Look, Brad, here's the
tour for this season.

82
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:42,138
That's only 10 weeks.

83
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:45,727
Sixty percent of our money comes from
the big cities in the first 10 weeks.

84
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,187
The worlds upside down,
Brad. We can't take the risk...

85
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,731
Our people risk their necks twice a day.

86
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,571
Well have a short season,
no red ink and no trouble.

87
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:54,901
Troubles part of the circus.

88
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,446
They said Barnum was in
trouble when he lost Tom Thumb.

89
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,942
They said he was
through when Jumbo died.

90
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:03,406
Were the greatest show on earth, and
you can't put 1,400 people out of work

91
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,076
because the world has a stomach ache.

92
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,750
And you can't risk $25,000 a day
on a sentimental journey, either.

93
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:12,337
If you'll play only the big cities, you'll
cut the heart right out of this show.

94
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:15,758
In two seasons, you'll destroy what
it took his family 80 years to build.

95
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,252
I might vote a few weeks more
if we had a bigger headline.

96
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:20,636
- Holly isn't known.
- Well, we've got one.

97
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,682
- Didn't you tell him, John?
- Not yet.

98
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,263
Who is it, Johnny?

99
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:27,679
Have you brought Gargantua back to life?

100
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:29,770
The Great Sebastian.

101
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:30,938
- What?
- Oh, no!

102
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,307
Obviously, you're crazy.

103
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,442
Sebastian's wrecked
every show he's been with.

104
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,780
- But he draws like sugar in fly time.
- Nobody can handle him.

105
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:40,618
- He's never worked for Brad.
- You're buying trouble, Johnny.

106
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:43,110
I'm buying the best
trapeze act in the air.

107
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:46,705
Well, he may be a god in the air,
but he's a devil on the ground.

108
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,073
You mean with women?

109
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,126
Do you know how many
women this show carries?

110
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,754
He's not that good, no
matter what you've heard.

111
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,878
- Things are bad enough as it is.
- No, Brad, it's too big a gamble.

112
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:57,133
You haven't sold me. I'm still
against going under canvas.

113
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:59,793
- Are you for Sebastian?
- Yes.

114
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,008
Because the only way we could get him
was to sign him for the full season.

115
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,642
I knew there was a trick in it.

116
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:07,134
You can't get good acts
for a 10-week season!

117
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,427
Cool off, Brad.

118
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,764
Were going to stay out as
long as were in the black.

119
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:11,937
Agreed?

120
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,686
- As long as we make money, yes.
- If you say so, John.

121
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:14,809
Well, I don't like it, John.

122
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:16,102
Thank you, gentlemen. That's it.

123
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,403
And you'd better start
worrying about Sebastian.

124
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:20,697
- Let me show you...
- You try to give...

125
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:21,899
I can't believe it.

126
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,404
Hey, Lucky, keep those cats
covered when you move them.

127
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,828
Okay, Mr. Braden.

128
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:31,329
- Brad?
- Yeah?

129
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:35,005
You know Sebastian only
works in the centre ring.

130
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,419
I know it.

131
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:38,585
Id rather crawl in that cage of cats

132
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:41,631
than have to tell Holly
she's out of the centre ring.

133
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:43,344
So would I.

134
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:45,472
You can blame me if you want to.

135
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:48,427
Thanks, but it's my
medicine. I'll take it.

136
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,481
Come on, boy. Come on.

137
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:59,686
Hey, Tuffy, off your
back and on your toes.

138
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,905
And give me a little
more slack this time.

139
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,151
You got ample rope now for a hanging.

140
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:06,118
One more and I'm going to
do without the mechanic.

141
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,865
No deal. I'll put up a net.

142
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:10,198
What do you think I am, a fish?

143
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,581
You better use a net for this
one, or you'll break your neck,

144
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,413
and Brad will break mine.

145
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:17,292
Now don't get sentimental,
Tuffy. Come on, lets go.

146
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,874
If Brad sees this,
he'll chew your ears off.

147
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,553
Snap your legs now.

148
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:24,549
All the way together, Lena.

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,392
Point your toes, Janet.
A little more curve.

150
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:28,721
Relax, relax.

151
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:30,056
- Any news?
- Nope.

152
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,853
Come on, now. Lets get over it.

153
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,233
Faster, Loni, faster.

154
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,658
What gives, Buttons?

155
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:47,947
Holly's hatched up a new
hair-raiser for that centre spot.

156
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:50,454
Quiet around the centre ring!

157
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,747
Everybody, still a minute, please!

158
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:55,534
Time...

159
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,048
Terrific, Holly!

160
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:01,002
Pretty good.

161
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:05,258
Hi, Brad. Do you like it?

162
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:07,305
You try it again and I'll ground you.

163
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,182
It's the finish on my new act.

164
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:11,177
It'll finish you and your act.

165
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,430
Don't you want to see it once more?

166
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:14,851
No. Come on down.

167
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:18,692
Okay, you're the boss. Watch
it, Tuffy. Here I come.

168
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,353
- Oh, brother.
- Hey, look it.

169
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,939
- Down on seconds.
- Put it in the act, Holly.

170
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:28,530
That ankle drop is out. I
want you all in one piece.

171
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:36,829
That's for making the big
brass give us a full season.

172
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:39,625
You got that trapeze
wired for sound, pigeon?

173
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:43,918
But you're the kind of fellow who
could talk anybody into anything.

174
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,802
- You did, didn't you?
- Yeah.

175
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:47,512
Hey, kids, Brad fixed it.

176
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:50,089
Were gonna play the
full season! Come on!

177
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:55,266
Did you hear that,
Klaus? The full season!

178
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,858
Down, move down. Make
him put me down, Klaus.

179
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,022
Why?

180
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,352
Do I have to have an
excuse to leave the room?

181
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:04,569
You know, I think it is the trousers.

182
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:06,281
Wherever there are trousers, you go.

183
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,736
- Full season, Loni.
- Oh! He filled it.

184
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:12,616
The full season will buy
me a sable-dyed rabbit coat.

185
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,165
What you have on, I like.

186
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,001
Well, sugar, like it
a little farther away.

187
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:20,793
- No layoff, Buzzy!
- Tell him, Daisy.

188
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,340
Were hitting the sticks.

189
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:23,504
Terrific.

190
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:33,430
Okay...

191
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,512
A full season, isn't that swell?

192
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:37,851
You're wonderful!

193
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,894
All right, quiet down,
everybody. Quiet down!

194
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:44,185
Now, listen, and get this, all of you.

195
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:47,445
We only stay out as long
as were in the black.

196
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,944
Well be in the black, right?

197
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:51,822
You mean we all got
to play in blackface?

198
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,492
- And Sebastian, too!
- Sebastian?

199
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:59,367
- Sebastian?
- Sebastian?

200
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:02,166
- Oh, no, he's not.
- Lock up the girls.

201
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:03,667
Ain't he in Europe?

202
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,165
- Oh, boy, wait till you see him.
- Who did you say?

203
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,177
Well, I don't know, but I heard
that The Great Sebastian's coming.

204
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:10,674
Is that true, Brad?

205
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,881
News sure travels fast around here.

206
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:17,350
He's strictly centre ring, isn't he?

207
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:18,933
That's right.

208
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,314
- Hi. Ain't it great?
- Terrific.

209
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:27,484
Oh, boy!

210
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:29,984
Do you know what this is?

211
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:33,279
Well, sure. It's my
iron-jaw mouthpiece. Why?

212
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,248
Put it in your gabby
mouth and keep it shut.

213
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,455
- Where'd you leave the props?
- Right over here.

214
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,789
He can take care of us now.

215
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:43,665
All right. Get your bits,
girls. You, too, Philip.

216
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:46,748
Well, I guess I know where I stand.

217
00:12:46,842 --> 00:12:48,218
- Holly, listen...
- To what?

218
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:51,256
More promises about next
year, the year after that?

219
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:53,256
I was a fool to believe you.

220
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,721
You'd sell out your own
grandmother for a name act.

221
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,301
- You know there's nobody...
- Don't say you're sorry.

222
00:12:58,395 --> 00:12:59,427
I couldn't take that.

223
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:01,561
I'm sorry there's only one centre ring.

224
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:04,318
Oh, sure. I know. The show comes first.

225
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,433
I didn't want to do this.

226
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:08,398
Save your breath. I know
just what you're gonna say.

227
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:12,072
Oh, Brad, I had the centre ring.
You told me I could have it.

228
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,282
Holly, you want the show
to play the road, don't you?

229
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,994
I worked in every act in this circus.

230
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,785
I'm in spec, I'm in manage, I'm
a rose on the beauty float,

231
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:21,116
I fill in with the flyers.
I work from start to finish.

232
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,831
Well, so do most of the others. It
was the only way to get a full season.

233
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,000
But my own act,

234
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,758
the one thing that's really mine,
that I've worked on for three years,

235
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,384
that you toss right
out of the centre ring.

236
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:32,505
Pigeon, look, you're the
best trapeze act in the show.

237
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:36,261
- Then why don't you leave me in centre?
- Because Sebastian's a bigger draw.

238
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,390
Brad, I'll draw them. Leave me there.

239
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:41,597
Sebastian's sure. You're a chance.

240
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:49,522
You don't take chances
with the show, do you?

241
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:50,978
No.

242
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:53,444
All right.

243
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,702
I'll move over.

244
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,651
Where do I go?

245
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:01,160
Ring one.

246
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,454
Oh, Brad,

247
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:08,464
Id do my act in clown alley
or the horse top for you.

248
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,417
Id do anything if it was just for you.

249
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:16,512
Pigeon, look, out under the sky,
you know how I feel about you.

250
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,884
But under the big top, one
performers just like another to me.

251
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,513
You've got nothing but
sawdust in your veins.

252
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:26,144
I've scraped too many of you
kinkers up from the sawdust

253
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,142
to let anybody get under my skin.

254
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,564
Just so the show rolls.

255
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,860
You don't care who it
rolls over or who it hurts.

256
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,145
So it rolls over me.

257
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,363
Be careful someday it
doesn't roll over you.

258
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:36,482
Don't worry.

259
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:40,325
I'll have my rigging out of centre
before The Great Sebastian arrives.

260
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:44,331
- Tuffy, tear down my rigging.
- Okay.

261
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:51,835
Like peanuts, Harry?

262
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:56,001
I got everything lined up, Mr. Henderson.

263
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,840
Gaff wheels, novelties for sucker bait,

264
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:59,841
and two of the best
stickmen in the rackets.

265
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,891
I'll work it just like the Columbia show.

266
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:04,812
No, Harry, you got a tough guy
here you didn't have at Columbia.

267
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:07,020
Brad Braden? I'll handle him.

268
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,856
With your brains, you
couldn't handle that hippo.

269
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:13,194
Listen, if Braden gets in my
way, I'll roll right over him.

270
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:16,237
He'd break you in two.

271
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:18,360
Not with you backing me, Mr. Henderson.

272
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,445
He's too smart to tangle with your boys.

273
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:22,863
I'll cut him in, maybe.

274
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,666
You can't buy men like Braden.
And don't meet him head-on.

275
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,336
Okay, I'll go around him.

276
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:33,337
Great.

277
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:36,506
What about the bankroll for the games?

278
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,089
Have some more peanuts, Harry.

279
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:44,050
Peanuts?

280
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,405
Hi, potato. Getting ready to roll?

281
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,988
What's the potato gag?

282
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:06,322
- Here, wrap that for me, will you?
- Okay.

283
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,078
Well, there's mashed potatoes and
hashed potatoes, sweet potatoes.

284
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,083
I don't feel very sweet,

285
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,800
except maybe about you.

286
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:20,170
You're always helping everybody, Buttons.

287
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:23,348
- Brad asked me to help you.
- Was he sorry about it?

288
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,594
Maybe he was just worried I
wouldn't have my rigging down

289
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:29,348
before The Great Sebastian arrives.

290
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,899
Could be. Could be.

291
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,776
He doesn't consider anybody's feelings
when it comes to running the circus.

292
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:38,112
You're telling me. I'm
so mad I could spit.

293
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:39,907
Well, why don't you spit then?

294
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:43,111
You know, Brads not
a man, he's a machine,

295
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:44,995
like the tractors and the generators.

296
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:49,285
Why, Buttons, I thought
you were his friend.

297
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:52,955
Well, he broke his word to you.
You could never trust him again.

298
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:55,000
That isn't true!

299
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,463
Brads been worried sick about
getting us all a full season.

300
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,793
If he had to throw me out, he
had to throw me out and its...

301
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,011
You didn't mean any
of what you just said.

302
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,638
I made you see it his
way a little, didn't I?

303
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,475
Darn you.

304
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:14,189
- You make me feel like a big idiot.
- Yeah, well, stop acting like one then.

305
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,104
Well, anyway, I'm still mad at
him. And I'm mad at you, too.

306
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:22,318
Say, that's pretty neat.

307
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,778
Reminds me of a bandage I wore
once when I sprained my ankle.

308
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:34,371
Buttons, why can Brad hurt me so?

309
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,664
Why do I always want to hurt him back?

310
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:43,294
They say each man kills
the thing he loves.

311
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:48,847
A coward does it with a kiss,
a brave man with a sword.

312
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:50,679
Why, that's crazy.

313
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,811
You wouldn't hurt anyone you loved.

314
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:55,568
Who knows what a man
will do when he's in love?

315
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:58,649
Every girl in the
show has tried for you.

316
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:01,439
But I guess you already
have someone, huh?

317
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:02,611
Could be.

318
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,863
Is she in one of the
towns were gonna play?

319
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:08,870
I haven't seen the route sheet.

320
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:11,873
Is that why you don't try
to romance any of the gals?

321
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:14,869
No. Clowns are funny people, Holly.

322
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:16,915
They only love once.

323
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:22,759
All men aren't that way even
if they act like clowns.

324
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,304
No, I suppose not.

325
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,973
Oh, Buttons, I'm all ache inside,

326
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:32,849
having a man love sawdust more than me.

327
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,894
Well, maybe he'll have
to make a choice someday.

328
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,563
Choice?

329
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:42,230
If ever I'm in his arms, his
head will be in the machine shop

330
00:18:42,573 --> 00:18:44,649
- or bedding down the hippopotamus.
- Yeah.

331
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:48,822
You're lucky. Everybody loves you.

332
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:52,243
Ten million kids and your girl.

333
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:56,494
You'll be seeing her pretty soon.

334
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:58,754
We roll in three days.

335
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,919
Yeah.

336
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,506
Yeah.

337
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:10,639
Into the sunshine of spring,

338
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:14,142
the circus rises from
its winter hibernation,

339
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,605
spick-and-span,

340
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,023
and ready for eight months
of excitement and adventure.

341
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:22,529
The circus trains, like Noah's Ark,

342
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:25,530
will carry and shelter man and beast

343
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:29,234
through flood and mud
and heat and storm,

344
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:31,285
through triumph and adversity.

345
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:33,614
1,400 souls,

346
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:37,491
each sure the season will
bring his hearts desire.

347
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:40,256
- You dropped something!
- Hey, look out, look out.

348
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,748
Why don't you drive where you're looking?

349
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:46,340
I wish one of your dogs would bite you.

350
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:51,765
All right, boys! Come on.

351
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,349
All right. Keep it coming.
Keeping it coming. That's right.

352
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:57,814
Keep it coming.

353
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:09,156
Get tight in front of those wheels.

354
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:12,160
Can't locate Sebastian. Tried
the hospitals, the hotels.

355
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:14,998
Straighten that wagon
out! Come on! Get with it!

356
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,912
We pull out in a half an hour
whether he's aboard or not.

357
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:20,160
Check both railroad stations and...

358
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:28,001
- Who's that?
- Sebastian, I guess.

359
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:37,516
- Hi, Sebastian.
- Hello!

360
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:39,891
Get a load of that.

361
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:43,228
Where's the fire at?

362
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:54,484
Oh, baby!

363
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:07,081
This ought to be good.

364
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:09,003
Where is the boss man?

365
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:15,009
I thought he was.

366
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,681
I am Sebastian. I am
honoured to be with you.

367
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:21,558
I hope your acts as
good as your entrance.

368
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:24,519
I've seen them all arrive,
Caldona, The Concellos,

369
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,312
none of them ever came
with a funeral escort.

370
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,240
The police escort, it was not my idea.

371
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:34,238
- I clocked him at 75 in a 15-mile
zone. - Running a red light.

372
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:35,906
I got him for cutting
in and out of traffic

373
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:37,455
on the wrong side of the highway.

374
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,331
In the war, I drive a tank.

375
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,581
Sometimes I forget. I forgot.

376
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,169
Yeah, well, the judge will add
that up to about $100 or 60 days.

377
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:47,336
$100?

378
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:53,463
Then it'll be 60 days in jail.

379
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:57,140
I would hate to be absent the
first two months of the show.

380
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:01,053
Okay, boys. I'll buy him back.

381
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,265
Take my jeep, Lawson.
Settle it in the office.

382
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,770
Get your baggage aboard.

383
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:09,612
You can park that heap
in the menagerie house.

384
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:10,942
I salute you.

385
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:13,357
We shall get along together splendidly.

386
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,740
Hey!

387
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:24,665
Don't crowd, mister.

388
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:27,920
Can't you see an elephant, or
do I have to paint her red?

389
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:33,093
I was blinded by the memory of
an unforgettable night in Paris.

390
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:36,922
Blow up your water wings,
girls. Here comes the big wave.

391
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,845
Come on, Ruth.

392
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:42,306
How come no husband ever shot you?

393
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:44,436
I never offer a sitting target.

394
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,144
I thought Id seen the last of you

395
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,856
when you got mixed up with
that wirewalker from Lisbon.

396
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:51,902
You will never see
the last of me, Angel.

397
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:53,104
Angel!

398
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:56,113
That will be arranged
when you meet Klaus.

399
00:22:58,787 --> 00:22:59,950
Angel!

400
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:02,117
Sebastian!

401
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:08,001
- Hello, handsome. Remember?
- Natalia!

402
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:11,374
- No, honey ball, Phyllis.
- Of course.

403
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:14,040
Lovely Phyllis with
the charming iron jaw.

404
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:17,628
Well, I'm still hanging
on to my job with it.

405
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:18,754
All right.

406
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:21,850
It saves your feet. Sure
tough on your clothes, though.

407
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:23,394
Thanks for the ride, sugar.

408
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,021
You know Sebastian, eh?

409
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:28,190
- Sure, were old friends.
- How good friends?

410
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,933
Listen, you can worry about
any other guy in the show,

411
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:32,226
but not Sebastian.

412
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:35,405
I wouldn't want him if he
were dipped in gold dust.

413
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:41,401
We will make beautiful
music together, huh?

414
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:45,032
Yeah, the last time, I
remember a few sour notes.

415
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,406
Oh, Natalia was...

416
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:50,118
Who is that?

417
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:51,625
They threw me off the ball team

418
00:23:51,715 --> 00:23:54,289
because I was catching
home runs at second base.

419
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:56,009
Say, how come the Giants passed you up?

420
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:57,126
I don't know.

421
00:23:57,221 --> 00:23:59,130
Oh, that's the giant and the fat boy.

422
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:00,682
No, no. In between.

423
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,177
- Oh, that's Holly.
- Holly?

424
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:05,430
She's interesting.

425
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,438
I wouldn't meet her
just now if I were you.

426
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,813
- You're poison.
- Why?

427
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:14,270
- You just put her out of the centre ring.
- I did?

428
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:19,404
Excuse me.

429
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,289
Music.

430
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,991
- Well, here we go again.
- Did you bring any cards?

431
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:31,043
- Oh, my feet are killing me.
- Well, then, keep off of mine.

432
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,372
Pardon. Is it true what
Phyllis has told me?

433
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:35,257
- I wouldn't know.
- Pardon.

434
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:37,296
Wait a minute!

435
00:24:37,386 --> 00:24:39,877
That they put you out of
the centre ring for me?

436
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:41,466
I am Sebastian.

437
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:45,219
- You mean you didn't know?
- How could I?

438
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:48,098
- I am very, very sorry.
- I'll get over it.

439
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:51,522
If you're half as good in the
air as you look on the ground,

440
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:53,151
you are at least terrific.

441
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:55,358
The boss seems to have other ideas.

442
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:59,191
Say, they tell me that you
work with two bars like I do.

443
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:02,576
No. You work with two bars like I do.

444
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:05,363
Anyway, I'm glad to meet you.

445
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:08,369
It means so much to
you, the centre ring?

446
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,748
- Don't be funny.
- Excuse me.

447
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:11,999
Would you hold these, please?

448
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:13,879
- Oh, yes, Sebastian.
- Thank you.

449
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:16,048
- Come.
- Where?

450
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:19,004
- To see the boss.
- What for?

451
00:25:19,094 --> 00:25:21,550
I will insist he put
you right back again.

452
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,720
You aren't kidding me, are you?

453
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:30,267
- Come and see.
- Oh, boy, will I!

454
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:32,562
Keep going. This isn't a parking lot.

455
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,975
That was a beautiful
doll you made for Sissy.

456
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,896
I'm glad she liked it. Hello, Holly.

457
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:38,363
Oh, Buttons!

458
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:40,191
I want you to meet The Great Sebastian.

459
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:43,651
This is Buttons. You'll love
him. Everybody does. Come on.

460
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:49,114
- Why are you in makeup?
- Why are you The Great Sebastian?

461
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:57,537
Get those runs in,
and were about through.

462
00:25:57,633 --> 00:26:00,504
Mr. Braden, we've got
trouble, 750 pounds of it.

463
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:04,378
- Yeah, we can't get Tiny aboard.
- Can't even get him through the door.

464
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,599
Go along with Lotus.

465
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:13,095
They'll make you comfortable in her car.

466
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:15,432
That hippo? She might get hungry.

467
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:17,936
Don't worry. She's a vegetarian.

468
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,950
Brad! Brad!

469
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:28,031
Sebastian's got something to tell you.

470
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:30,660
Better tie him in so
he wont roll! Has he?

471
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:34,000
You know what? He wants to
give up the centre ring to me.

472
00:26:34,086 --> 00:26:35,497
Isn't he wonderful?

473
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:37,414
Yeah. Wonderful.

474
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:40,048
Where do you propose to go?

475
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:42,756
I have had the centre ring.
To me, it does not matter.

476
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:45,418
Ring one or ring three, as you wish.

477
00:26:45,514 --> 00:26:49,014
He really means it, Brad.
He's not just grandstanding.

478
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:50,761
- Holly...
- Oh, Brad.

479
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:53,344
I've wanted that ring ever
since I've been a foot high.

480
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,266
Do you know what were paying Sebastian?

481
00:26:55,357 --> 00:26:58,275
You know how his billing
reads? He's the star of the show.

482
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,519
And the star requests ring three.

483
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:02,652
Who do you think you're kidding?

484
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:06,195
I'm sorry, Holly, but the
people watch the star.

485
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:08,823
That's why the star
plays the centre ring.

486
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:13,282
The people watch the star, do they?

487
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,918
Well, they're going to be watching me.

488
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,461
If you wont let him
give me the centre ring,

489
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:17,826
I'll take it away from him.

490
00:27:17,922 --> 00:27:19,879
Oh, no, ma chérie.

491
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:23,381
I may give it away, but
no one will take it away.

492
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:25,293
Look, Sebastian.

493
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:27,878
You're a nice guy, and I
hate to do this to you,

494
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:30,927
but I'm going to make
ring one the centre ring.

495
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,058
If you do something
once, I'll do it twice.

496
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:34,723
If you do a double, I'll do a triple.

497
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:36,687
If you stand on your
head, I'll stand on my ear.

498
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:38,683
Not while I'm around, you wont.

499
00:27:38,776 --> 00:27:41,349
The one place you're not
around is 40 feet straight up.

500
00:27:41,445 --> 00:27:43,521
Maybe that's why I like it there.

501
00:27:43,614 --> 00:27:46,900
I'm warning you, the audiences
are going to be looking at me.

502
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:49,196
And so will I.

503
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:53,165
You start any trouble,
and I'll ground you both.

504
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:56,748
Hello, Brad. Were here to
bless the circus trains again.

505
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:58,460
It's good to see you, Father.

506
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,871
Could you pour it on a
little extra heavy this time?

507
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:03,752
- Of course we can.
- I think were going to need it.

508
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:10,175
All right, boys. Raise
that run up and get it in.

509
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:11,345
Even.

510
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:13,841
Loading.

511
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:27,026
Hurry it up, little Jim!

512
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:29,358
- Give me your hand.
- Don't fall, now.

513
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:31,067
Oh, boy!

514
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,370
Bye. See you in Washington.

515
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,211
Bye, Father!

516
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:47,297
Bye, Father.

517
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:06,570
...one of the featured attractions
of the greatest show on earth.

518
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:08,897
Come right on in. Lets everybody go.

519
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:11,743
...boys and girls...

520
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:14,947
She's going to swallow
first this curved sword,

521
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,538
and you will notice that
she has to twist her body

522
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:22,042
in order that the sword
can go down her curved neck.

523
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:24,421
Do you think it's sharp?

524
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:34,546
Children of all ages!

525
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:37,393
John Ringling North welcomes you

526
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:40,265
to the greatest show on earth.

527
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:45,442
Brainy bruins with new ideas.

528
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:50,358
Himalayan, Russian,
Syrian and polar bears.

529
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:03,078
Sleek and shining as silver dollars,

530
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,124
Roland Tiebor's marvellous, amazing,

531
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:08,457
sophisticated sea lions.

532
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:21,392
The internationally
famous riding canine!

533
00:30:28,445 --> 00:30:30,485
He did it, Mama!

534
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:47,668
Back, boy!

535
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:49,747
Foot!

536
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:51,253
Foot! Foot!

537
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:55,085
Foot!

538
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:57,672
That foots pretty rough
to go in a girls face.

539
00:30:57,766 --> 00:30:59,806
- File it.
- All right.

540
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,471
Hey, the duel or whatever you call
it for the centre ring, Mr. Braden?

541
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:06,681
Yeah? What about it?

542
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:09,017
I hear they're slapping death
in the face twice a day.

543
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:10,736
The paper wants to know
if it's on the level.

544
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:13,573
Coming right on. Take a look.

545
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:32,461
Ladies and gentlemen,

546
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:36,336
the sensation of the ages.

547
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,431
In ring one,

548
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:42,932
the beautiful bird of paradise,

549
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,476
queen of the flying trapeze,

550
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:49,857
the daring, the incredible,

551
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:52,400
the death-defying,

552
00:31:52,488 --> 00:31:55,405
peerless and fearless Holly!

553
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,123
And in the centre ring,

554
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,874
the outstanding aerial
daredevil of all time,

555
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:15,876
the debonair king of the
air, The Great Sebastian!

556
00:32:56,594 --> 00:33:00,674
It sure packs them in. Best
publicity gag in a long time.

557
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,259
It's no gag, brother.

558
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,548
You wouldn't kid me, would you?

559
00:33:04,643 --> 00:33:06,766
Kid you? They're working without nets.

560
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:20,193
Boy, look at that guy.

561
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,528
Look at her!

562
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:34,171
If they don't get killed.

563
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:37,332
It's all done with mirrors, mister.

564
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,284
- Well, what are they going to do now?
- Changing bars.

565
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:49,781
Should I whistle them down,
Brad? They're changing their act.

566
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:00,383
No. Leave them alone.

567
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:02,878
They're doing all right.

568
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:04,714
Okay. You're the boss.

569
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,153
Hey, Sebastian, try it
without the doughnut!

570
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:18,539
How long do you think this can
go on before something happens?

571
00:36:18,629 --> 00:36:20,289
That's circus, isn't it?

572
00:36:43,946 --> 00:36:45,654
Do you believe in prayer?

573
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:47,567
And practise.

574
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:50,529
- What if one of them falls?
- Nobody's going to fall.

575
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,326
This is packing them in every show.

576
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:57,739
- We stay in the black or close down.
- Oh, stop talking so tough.

577
00:36:58,335 --> 00:37:00,494
You know, that isn't the
bass drum I hear thumping.

578
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:01,667
That's your heart.

579
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:03,415
You know...

580
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:04,538
I know.

581
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,614
Well, I've had enough.

582
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,196
Well, that was a close one.

583
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:15,656
Well, are you ready to call it off?

584
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:18,315
I have not started yet,
but you were magnificent.

585
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,617
- Sure stole it today, Holly.
- Thanks, Bob.

586
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:22,662
You two had quite a
party up there, didn't you?

587
00:40:22,748 --> 00:40:24,492
Did you notice which
ring they were looking at?

588
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:27,288
If you really want to kill
yourself, wait till the seasons over.

589
00:40:27,378 --> 00:40:28,706
Well, what do you know?
He was worried about me.

590
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:29,875
So was I.

591
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:32,918
From here on, cut out the dogfights
up there and stick to your acts.

592
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:35,167
Brad, don't be a killjoy.

593
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,834
You don't know what it's like up
there. It's a different world.

594
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,638
Just the two of us
fighting for the crowd.

595
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:42,559
You feel like you could do
anything. Were not people up there.

596
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:45,181
Were like two streaks of
light with wings and...

597
00:40:47,606 --> 00:40:49,314
You wouldn't understand.

598
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:53,063
- Nobody would, except another flyer.
- Like Sebastian?

599
00:40:56,532 --> 00:40:57,611
Yeah.

600
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,702
Like Sebastian.

601
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:03,242
Come on, come on. We
need people for the spec.

602
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,035
- Did you watch the show?
- Yeah. It was terrific!

603
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,415
- McClosky wants you, Brad.
- Okay.

604
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,250
- Did you follow me?
- Yeah.

605
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:14,249
- That's not the half of it!
- Please go up to the costume...

606
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:17,046
You and Sebastian got an exclusive
little club up there in the air?

607
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:19,045
Get yourself a trapeze
if you want to join.

608
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:21,463
And don't park your chewing
gum on the moon again, please.

609
00:41:21,557 --> 00:41:24,392
Why don't he look at me anymore?
Have I got too much or not enough?

610
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:26,718
Don't worry, sugar.
He'll get around to you.

611
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:28,556
- I'm hoping.
- Maybe he wont.

612
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:30,058
Did your elephant sit on this zipper?

613
00:41:30,149 --> 00:41:31,892
He says were artists up there together.

614
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:34,226
He'd tell that to a trained
seal if it paid off.

615
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,024
Maybe he shows his bad side
to you and his good side to me.

616
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:38,941
Listen, Snow White, you're
not fighting this guy,

617
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:40,231
you're falling for him.

618
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,864
He was good enough for you once.
Maybe you'd like to have him back.

619
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:44,531
I wouldn't give Sebastian the right time

620
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:46,863
if Brad was as nuts about
me as he is about you.

621
00:41:46,957 --> 00:41:48,072
Brad? Are you kidding?

622
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:50,836
I come fourth. After Ringling
Bros., Barnum and Bailey.

623
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,628
You're eating too many potatoes.

624
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:54,041
When Brad doesn't come home nights,

625
00:41:54,131 --> 00:41:56,539
you'll know the blonde he's
sitting up with is a giraffe.

626
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,844
Hey, Holly, you trying to corner the
market or just starting a collection?

627
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:03,262
- My...
- Well, you only work with your teeth.

628
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:06,303
Get with it, Mabel. Three
minutes. So lets get it all on.

629
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:07,508
Okay.

630
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,302
If it were only you, sugar,

631
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:12,267
Id let you ride the roller
coaster all the way down.

632
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:14,018
But I'm thinking about Brad.

633
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:16,435
Why do you want to bust up
the swellest guy in the circus?

634
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:18,438
Sounds like you've got it bad.

635
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:21,531
He's the only guy that looks at me
that I don't know what he's thinking.

636
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:22,696
He's thinking circus.

637
00:42:22,785 --> 00:42:25,454
He hasn't thought anything but circus
since he fell out of the cradle.

638
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:27,910
But if you want him so
bad, what's stopping you?

639
00:42:27,998 --> 00:42:29,908
Maybe because I knew too
many guys like Sebastian

640
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,245
before I met Brad.

641
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:33,043
Been around too much, huh?

642
00:42:33,128 --> 00:42:35,168
You haven't been gathering
any moss, either.

643
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:37,416
Brads a one-woman man.

644
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:40,129
I've got a feeling he
wants a one-man woman.

645
00:42:42,513 --> 00:42:43,972
I don't rate a guy like that.

646
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:45,254
Angel?

647
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:48,385
Besides, right now she's got
elephant trainer trouble.

648
00:42:48,853 --> 00:42:50,133
Angel!

649
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:52,268
You better hurry.
That's not Sabu calling.

650
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:54,396
That's what I like about
him. He's so gentle.

651
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:56,974
Who wants them gentle? I like them wild.

652
00:42:57,653 --> 00:42:59,646
Oh, come on, birdie. Get going.

653
00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:01,316
Angel, come along!

654
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:21,296
You should have seen Brads
face when you took that tumble.

655
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:22,796
She was too busy watching Sebastian.

656
00:43:22,887 --> 00:43:25,045
- Put your claws away, girls.
- Holly.

657
00:43:26,098 --> 00:43:27,758
Gee, if all the Rangers
looked like Sebastian,

658
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:28,881
me for Texas.

659
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:30,470
You and plenty more, huh, Holly?

660
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:32,637
Look, all I want from
him is the centre ring.

661
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,146
You always have a smile for
that high-flying peacock.

662
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:38,226
Well, what you want
me to do, cry over him?

663
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,110
I feel like a turret gunner.

664
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,985
Made it.

665
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:47,158
Okay, batten down the hatches.

666
00:43:47,244 --> 00:43:49,036
Hey, Rich, get me a hot dog, will you?

667
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:51,078
- We ain't got time.
- Well, I'm hungry!

668
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:52,659
You always are.

669
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:45,959
An album of favourite songs.

670
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:48,425
A circus serenade.

671
00:45:13,164 --> 00:45:14,907
A Disney album.

672
00:45:22,798 --> 00:45:24,755
It's Mickey Mouse. Hi, Mickey!

673
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:31,925
Come on, Donald!

674
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:33,296
Look at Pluto!

675
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:35,059
Hi, Alice!

676
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:41,645
Oh, and there the Mad
Hatter. The Mad Hatter.

677
00:45:48,324 --> 00:45:50,612
A Gay Nineties album.

678
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:16,971
A moonlight serenade.

679
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,475
The magic of moonlight melodies,

680
00:46:20,564 --> 00:46:24,776
with the lovely Phyllis
as goddess of the moon.

681
00:46:32,284 --> 00:46:33,695
Nursery rhymes.

682
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:37,903
The lady who taught you
your first fairy tale,

683
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,701
Mother Goose!

684
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,244
She's big, isn't she?

685
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:55,715
A barbershop ballad.

686
00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:03,814
A bouquet of American beauties,

687
00:47:04,316 --> 00:47:07,483
with the lovely Holly
as the centre rosebud

688
00:47:07,987 --> 00:47:10,193
singing Only a Rose.

689
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:39,802
Gee, you have a funny mouth.

690
00:47:39,894 --> 00:47:42,301
- Let me hold him.
- Go away.

691
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:57,192
Look it. Isn't it pretty?

692
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:08,503
They've been around
again asking questions.

693
00:48:09,006 --> 00:48:10,500
I'm so worried for you.

694
00:48:10,591 --> 00:48:13,627
Oh, now don't worry. They'll
never find me behind this nose.

695
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:14,917
Be very careful, dear.

696
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:16,175
Now how about a nice smile

697
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:18,422
that I can remember till next year?

698
00:48:19,308 --> 00:48:20,802
God be with you, my boy.

699
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:22,517
It's all right, Mother.

700
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:26,181
Only a rose

701
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:27,732
Here we go!

702
00:48:28,943 --> 00:48:32,691
Only a smile to keep in memory

703
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,991
Until we meet another day

704
00:48:37,076 --> 00:48:41,156
Only a rose to whisper

705
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:45,540
Blushing as roses do

706
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:52,542
I'll bring along a smile
or a song for anyone

707
00:48:54,176 --> 00:49:00,926
Only a rose for you

708
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:16,448
A Stephen Foster album.

709
00:49:41,724 --> 00:49:44,131
A South American album!

710
00:49:50,483 --> 00:49:54,729
Exotic firebirds from
the forests of the Amazon,

711
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,023
a blaze of breathtaking beauty.

712
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:38,862
A very special surprise

713
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:41,984
for children of all ages,

714
00:50:42,076 --> 00:50:44,827
our guest star for tonight,

715
00:50:44,912 --> 00:50:47,154
Hopalong Cassidy!

716
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,034
That's him! Sure, it's Hoppy!

717
00:51:05,516 --> 00:51:07,758
A Christmas album.

718
00:51:07,852 --> 00:51:11,351
Jingle bells, jingle
bells Jingle all the way

719
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,229
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh

720
00:51:30,624 --> 00:51:33,032
Your hair is too red,
your legs are too thin,

721
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:34,158
you have lips like a cat.

722
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:36,376
You're no good. You give
me too much trouble.

723
00:51:36,464 --> 00:51:38,255
Flattery rolls right off me.

724
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,333
But you make a fire here.

725
00:51:40,426 --> 00:51:43,546
Well, simmer down, General,
before you melt your medals.

726
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,933
What could be more fitting
for the Christmas album

727
00:51:52,021 --> 00:51:54,975
than Adeste Fideles?

728
00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:30,388
The performance ends,

729
00:52:30,476 --> 00:52:32,468
but the drama never stops.

730
00:52:33,687 --> 00:52:36,095
In the grey, drizzly morning,

731
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:40,318
the first section of the circus
train pulls into the railroad yard,

732
00:52:40,402 --> 00:52:42,609
long before the city is awake.

733
00:52:43,113 --> 00:52:46,814
But the animals are awake and
looking for their breakfast.

734
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:49,067
Then comes the unloading.

735
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:53,953
Two hundred tons of living power.
Sixty carloads of equipment.

736
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:58,085
Wheels rolling, gears grinding.

737
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:02,464
A circus is gigantic power
and unceasing movement.

738
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,293
It is a restless giant,

739
00:53:05,386 --> 00:53:09,466
unlimbering its muscles
after the long night ride

740
00:53:09,557 --> 00:53:12,308
before moving in to capture a new city.

741
00:53:13,686 --> 00:53:17,470
Up from the railroad yards
with their faithful escort

742
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:21,812
of early-rising young fans
who've been waiting since daybreak

743
00:53:21,902 --> 00:53:24,191
to follow these living tanks

744
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,814
as they lumber and sway
to the circus grounds,

745
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:31,988
where the stakes are being driven
that will anchor the big top

746
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,080
against the beating of
its constant adversaries,

747
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:37,039
wind and rain.

748
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:40,826
An army is at work, an army
the audience never sees.

749
00:53:41,672 --> 00:53:46,168
An army that must be moved from
city to city, fed and housed,

750
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,463
a thousand strong, hardworking men,

751
00:53:49,555 --> 00:53:53,505
moving like a finely-geared
machine, with one purpose,

752
00:53:53,601 --> 00:53:55,178
to roll the show.

753
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,140
The all-important baling
ring clangs into place.

754
00:53:59,231 --> 00:54:04,024
Bales of fireproof canvas,
58,000 pounds of it,

755
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:06,780
are hauled out, unwrapped, rolled out,

756
00:54:06,864 --> 00:54:09,569
stretched, laid on the ground,

757
00:54:09,658 --> 00:54:14,036
where it lies like the skin
of a mighty dismembered giant,

758
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:16,030
waiting for some magician

759
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:19,326
to bring it together and give it life,

760
00:54:20,336 --> 00:54:22,827
waiting until, one by one,

761
00:54:22,922 --> 00:54:26,373
the giants ribs rise into place

762
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:29,088
and are firmly fastened in the earth.

763
00:54:30,304 --> 00:54:34,302
Boys line up for the punt games,
a chance for a free ticket.

764
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:39,229
The disciplined army never loses
a moment nor wastes a motion.

765
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:43,774
The boss canvas man makes fast
the canvas to the baling ring.

766
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:46,433
The lives of all depend on it.

767
00:54:46,529 --> 00:54:49,944
Each of the hundreds of roustabouts
has his place and his job,

768
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:54,908
a responsible job, for one
mistake, one bit of carelessness,

769
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:56,538
could cost a life.

770
00:54:56,622 --> 00:54:58,698
The giants skin is stretched out

771
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:01,911
until it lies smooth and moulded,

772
00:55:02,628 --> 00:55:05,463
like the bowl of a great coliseum.

773
00:55:05,548 --> 00:55:07,374
But eyes watching for trouble

774
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:10,586
have noticed a little
tear that must be patched

775
00:55:10,678 --> 00:55:13,632
before the searching fingers of the wind

776
00:55:13,722 --> 00:55:15,798
can rip it into a disaster,

777
00:55:16,433 --> 00:55:18,759
before the giant can
stand up and stretch

778
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:21,723
over his feast of colour and laughter.

779
00:55:22,815 --> 00:55:25,388
Now the giant comes to life.

780
00:55:25,484 --> 00:55:28,651
Slowly, the tons and
tons of his canvas body

781
00:55:28,737 --> 00:55:30,860
rise and swell into the air.

782
00:55:31,782 --> 00:55:35,151
He starts growing to
his full, majestic height

783
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:37,735
as he catches his first deep breath.

784
00:55:38,914 --> 00:55:42,200
The strong baling rings
slipping along the great poles,

785
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:46,160
until at last they reach to
the flags flying from the peak.

786
00:55:47,673 --> 00:55:52,216
And as the big top rises in
each town, new risks are taken.

787
00:55:53,012 --> 00:55:55,419
Caution is thrown to the winds

788
00:55:55,514 --> 00:55:58,005
in this battle for the centre ring.

789
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:01,885
...55, 56, 57, 58,

790
00:56:01,979 --> 00:56:06,107
59, 60, 61,

791
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:10,272
62, 63, 64,

792
00:56:10,362 --> 00:56:14,277
65, 66, 67,

793
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:17,036
68, 69...

794
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:20,829
I warned her not to do
Jenny's act on that rigging.

795
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:24,034
Yeah. I was there the
night Jenny got killed.

796
00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:27,958
...75, 76, 77,

797
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:32,175
78, 79, 80,

798
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:36,304
81, 82, 83,

799
00:56:36,388 --> 00:56:40,552
84, 85, 86,

800
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:44,854
87, 88, 89,

801
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:49,019
90, 91, 92,

802
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:53,190
93, 94, 95,

803
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,278
96, 97, 98...

804
00:56:57,993 --> 00:57:01,528
- Paying for the hay all in silver?
- That's how we get paid.

805
00:57:02,373 --> 00:57:04,449
Holly's spinning like a
weathervane in a Kansas twister.

806
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:05,704
- Swingovers?
- Yeah.

807
00:57:05,793 --> 00:57:06,991
Her rope isn't rigged for that.

808
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:08,497
Tell the ringmaster to
whistle in The Zoppes.

809
00:57:08,587 --> 00:57:09,619
- Fast.
- Right.

810
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:13,296
...107, 108, 109,

811
00:57:13,384 --> 00:57:17,796
110, 111, 112...

812
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:19,169
Come on.

813
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:23,346
114, 115, 116,

814
00:57:23,435 --> 00:57:25,345
117...

815
00:57:25,437 --> 00:57:28,355
- What are they doing, Grandma?
- I don't know.

816
00:57:28,941 --> 00:57:32,986
121, 122, 123,

817
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,233
124...

818
00:57:37,658 --> 00:57:39,532
Like a fish on a line!

819
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,419
The red rope!

820
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:03,547
Hey, you!

821
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:05,884
You! Are you crazy?

822
00:58:05,978 --> 00:58:07,721
Hauling me down in front of everybody!

823
00:58:07,813 --> 00:58:11,063
Everybody laughing at me!
I was going for a record!

824
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,229
What's the matter, are you jealous?

825
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:14,725
Can't you stand to see me
work in the air anymore?

826
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,480
You can't do that trick
on a pull-up rope.

827
00:58:16,572 --> 00:58:18,980
- I was doing it, wasn't I?
- Get out of the way.

828
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:22,443
A hurricane of hazardous horsemanship

829
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:25,241
displayed by the riding Zoppes!

830
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:27,573
Why didn't you put her over
your knee and spank her?

831
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:29,955
That would get some laughs, too.

832
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:33,503
Haven't you got enough clowns, you
got to make a comic out of her?

833
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:37,587
- She was trying to break a record.
- Shed have broken more than a record.

834
00:58:38,886 --> 00:58:41,009
You sure saved her a buster.

835
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:44,011
You better tell her, Brad,
or shell never forgive you.

836
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:04,153
Alberto Zoppe and Cucciola,

837
00:59:04,245 --> 00:59:07,530
worlds smallest bareback rider!

838
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,067
I would buy you spring violets
from the little old lady

839
01:01:06,158 --> 01:01:09,278
in the Place de I'Opera
and crépes suzettes.

840
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,662
You never eaten them?

841
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,825
Paris is a honeymoon city,
chérie, full of enchantment.

842
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:21,580
On a night like this, the
Seine is deep and mysterious,

843
01:01:21,674 --> 01:01:23,251
like a woman's eyes.

844
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:25,714
The lights in it are like jewels.

845
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:30,467
Did you know, chérie, in your eyes
there are lights like stardust?

846
01:01:31,517 --> 01:01:34,269
No, but keep going.

847
01:01:34,353 --> 01:01:37,354
You are beautiful and
exciting, like wine.

848
01:01:38,107 --> 01:01:39,934
You know women are like wine?

849
01:01:40,025 --> 01:01:45,696
Some are like sweet Sauternes,
some are warm like Burgundy, some...

850
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:48,189
Which one was Angel?

851
01:01:48,701 --> 01:01:51,618
- Angel?
- Angel.

852
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,331
Angel was like cognac,

853
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:57,574
all fire in a glass.

854
01:01:57,668 --> 01:01:59,127
But you...

855
01:01:59,962 --> 01:02:04,291
You are like champagne.
Sparkling, tantalizing.

856
01:02:04,884 --> 01:02:07,007
You make a mans head spin.

857
01:02:09,513 --> 01:02:14,056
- You've got a terrific line.
- A line? What is that?

858
01:02:14,143 --> 01:02:17,808
Well, I mean, you've said all
this before to too many girls.

859
01:02:17,897 --> 01:02:20,055
Well, never to one like you.

860
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,898
Oh, I have wandered a little.

861
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:27,229
But how else could I appreciate
what I have found now?

862
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,782
Id better go.

863
01:02:31,076 --> 01:02:34,908
When we are up in the air,
I fall more and more in love.

864
01:02:34,997 --> 01:02:37,322
- You, too, no?
- No.

865
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:40,867
A girl may say no, but
the woman in her means yes.

866
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:45,089
- Do not be afraid of me.
- I'm just scared of myself.

867
01:02:45,174 --> 01:02:48,128
It is not of yourself. It
is love that frightens you.

868
01:02:48,219 --> 01:02:50,888
Feel. My heart beats fast like yours.

869
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:55,016
- That's the magic of it. You love me.
- No. I mean, I don't know.

870
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,556
Let me go! Sebastian!

871
01:03:01,649 --> 01:03:04,056
Never try to take
anything from an elephant.

872
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:06,025
Sebastian, do something!

873
01:03:06,111 --> 01:03:08,437
A lion, I'll fight for you. A tiger.

874
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:11,485
But a redheaded wildcat
with an elephant, no.

875
01:03:14,286 --> 01:03:17,157
You make this two-tailed
jackass put me down!

876
01:03:17,248 --> 01:03:19,454
Did he tell you about
Paris in the spring?

877
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:22,115
It's none of your
business what he told...

878
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:25,295
Did he say you were like
cognac, all fire in the glass?

879
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:28,631
No. He said I was like
champagne. I made his head spin.

880
01:03:28,717 --> 01:03:31,291
Yeah, only you'll be the one
that wakes up with a hangover.

881
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:33,794
You take care of your love
life, and I'll take care of mine.

882
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:36,641
No, I've got four
working here. That's all.

883
01:03:36,725 --> 01:03:39,181
Well, if you've got an
elephant missing, go find her.

884
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,645
Joe, send into town.

885
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:43,303
They had a Republican
convention there tonight.

886
01:03:43,941 --> 01:03:46,895
Hold it. Here's your
missing Jumbo. It's okay.

887
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:50,564
Come on, move it up,
Ruth. Come on. Move it up.

888
01:03:50,656 --> 01:03:51,735
You...

889
01:03:52,116 --> 01:03:53,943
All right. Put her down.

890
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:55,232
What's this, a new act?

891
01:03:55,327 --> 01:03:57,367
You nearly lost your
stray lamb to a wolf.

892
01:03:57,454 --> 01:03:59,613
You know, you've got a nose as
long as that elephants trunk.

893
01:03:59,707 --> 01:04:01,201
Keep them both out of my business.

894
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:03,450
They're looking for this bull
down at the railroad yard.

895
01:04:03,544 --> 01:04:07,209
- Ruth just couldn't resist the hay pile.
- Id hate to have your nerve in a tooth.

896
01:04:07,298 --> 01:04:10,334
Come on, sugar. Lets go. Come on.

897
01:04:10,426 --> 01:04:12,917
I think your coffees kind of cold.

898
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:19,849
- Why did you do that, Holly?
- I don't know.

899
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:23,011
There's just something
about Sebastian that I...

900
01:04:23,105 --> 01:04:26,142
Yeah, he's some glamour boy.

901
01:04:26,859 --> 01:04:29,350
He said I had stardust in my eyes.

902
01:04:31,363 --> 01:04:34,400
- I bet you never even noticed.
- Sure, I have.

903
01:04:34,492 --> 01:04:37,196
But you weren't rigged
for that one-armed swing.

904
01:04:37,286 --> 01:04:39,742
I know, just so the show keeps rolling.

905
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:42,748
Come over here. I want
to show you something.

906
01:04:53,093 --> 01:04:55,382
Just a few more spins up there.

907
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:03,769
- You would've lost a good act.
- One of the best.

908
01:05:04,897 --> 01:05:08,598
Now, look, Holly, I want you to
soft-pedal this stuff with Sebastian.

909
01:05:08,692 --> 01:05:12,026
- You do, Brad? Why?
- It's gone too far.

910
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:16,730
I guess you're right. I
have been playing with fire.

911
01:05:16,826 --> 01:05:19,399
But it's all your fault. If
you weren't such a big lug...

912
01:05:19,495 --> 01:05:22,780
I'm talking about your act, this
duel or whatever you call it.

913
01:05:22,873 --> 01:05:25,578
I want you to stop it
before you get hurt.

914
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:28,538
Is it me you're worried
about or the circus?

915
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,415
- You.
- Brad, do you really mean that?

916
01:05:33,968 --> 01:05:37,633
Why couldn't you say so?
Sure, I'll cut it out.

917
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:40,259
But I've got pride.
He'll look better than me.

918
01:05:40,349 --> 01:05:43,635
- With a net under him?
- A net? Why a net?

919
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:45,720
To save his expensive neck.

920
01:05:45,813 --> 01:05:49,763
- Well, I don't want a net.
- All right, then stick to the old act.

921
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:53,274
Sure, Brad. Whatever you say.

922
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:56,778
And when Sebastian tones
down, his net comes out, too.

923
01:05:57,741 --> 01:05:59,948
Now, you going to stop
fooling around up there?

924
01:06:00,035 --> 01:06:01,411
Sure, Brad.

925
01:06:02,288 --> 01:06:04,494
- What about on the ground?
- On the ground?

926
01:06:04,582 --> 01:06:07,452
Oh, that reminds me, Jeannie
pulled her shoulder tonight.

927
01:06:07,543 --> 01:06:09,167
Shell be on the ground for a while.

928
01:06:09,253 --> 01:06:10,628
Will you fill in with the flyers again?

929
01:06:10,713 --> 01:06:12,622
Of course, Brad, but you
were just gonna say that...

930
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:14,838
Line up that pole wagon! Swing it over!

931
01:06:14,925 --> 01:06:16,799
Brad, on the ground...

932
01:06:17,511 --> 01:06:21,805
- Do you want me to stop seeing him?
- On the ground? I...

933
01:06:27,396 --> 01:06:29,305
Doughnuts?

934
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:36,102
You left a little of your
fragrance behind with your scarf.

935
01:06:36,197 --> 01:06:38,438
May I escort you to the train?

936
01:06:41,202 --> 01:06:43,028
I'm waiting for Brad.

937
01:06:43,537 --> 01:06:47,321
- Till the next time, chérie.
- There wont be any next time.

938
01:06:47,416 --> 01:06:48,495
No?

939
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:52,835
I think you have stardust
mixed up with sawdust.

940
01:06:52,922 --> 01:06:54,665
Good night, boss man.

941
01:06:56,008 --> 01:06:57,799
And on the ground,

942
01:06:59,637 --> 01:07:02,840
I wouldn't want to meddle
in your private affairs.

943
01:07:13,692 --> 01:07:16,563
To the right and left of the doorway.

944
01:07:20,491 --> 01:07:22,946
Pompom hats, folks. Step right up.

945
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,283
Put your name on them,
your sweethearts name,

946
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:27,363
your wife's name, even
your mother-in-laws name.

947
01:07:27,456 --> 01:07:31,157
Step right up, folks. Get your
pompom hats before you leave.

948
01:07:32,878 --> 01:07:36,045
- For you, Liebchen, a present.
- Thank you, sugar.

949
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,505
Straight from Paris and twice as classy.

950
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,758
- How does it look?
- It looks good.

951
01:07:43,848 --> 01:07:45,721
Read it, what it says.

952
01:07:48,144 --> 01:07:51,310
Angel, du bist mein. What's it mean?

953
01:07:53,566 --> 01:07:54,941
You are mine.

954
01:07:55,818 --> 01:07:57,395
Listen, sugar, I'm not yours.

955
01:07:57,486 --> 01:07:59,894
And I'm not wearing
any hat that says so.

956
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:01,317
The sooner you take no for an answer,

957
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:05,239
the easier it's gonna be for
both of us. Because it is no.

958
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:08,577
The only thing I like about
you are your elephants.

959
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:10,363
But, Angel...

960
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:13,293
Want to win a baby doll?
Wise up. I know dolls.

961
01:08:13,377 --> 01:08:16,082
They're my business. Takes
dough to get a dame like her.

962
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:18,081
Her heart is ice.

963
01:08:18,174 --> 01:08:20,925
She wouldn't say no to
a hunk of ice like this.

964
01:08:24,138 --> 01:08:25,513
But I could not buy such a thing.

965
01:08:25,598 --> 01:08:27,424
Go ahead, take it. Your
credits okay with me.

966
01:08:27,516 --> 01:08:29,260
- What's the matter, pal?
- My wallets gone.

967
01:08:29,351 --> 01:08:30,466
Are you sure?

968
01:08:30,561 --> 01:08:32,470
I had the wallet in my
pocket when I was right here.

969
01:08:32,563 --> 01:08:35,766
- And I had $10 in it.
- Did you, now?

970
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:38,775
- You must be mistaken, friend.
- Oh, no. I...

971
01:08:40,613 --> 01:08:42,652
Well, maybe I was.

972
01:08:45,284 --> 01:08:47,905
Harry, you make trouble.

973
01:08:47,995 --> 01:08:49,988
Right this way, folks,
and win a baby doll!

974
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,239
Everybody plays, everybody wins.

975
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,957
Keep your eye on the arrow, folks.

976
01:08:54,043 --> 01:08:57,163
Round and round it goes and
where it stops, nobody knows.

977
01:08:57,254 --> 01:08:59,924
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry. Everybody plays.

978
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:42,999
How did he get in there?

979
01:09:56,522 --> 01:09:59,095
Waters coming out of it.

980
01:09:59,191 --> 01:10:01,943
Look at that silly umbrella.

981
01:10:28,262 --> 01:10:29,804
Sit down, Son.

982
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:08,084
Your attention, please.

983
01:11:08,636 --> 01:11:12,633
The greatest show on
earth proudly presents

984
01:11:12,723 --> 01:11:16,424
the most sensational
flying acts of all time,

985
01:11:17,436 --> 01:11:21,765
dazzling, dauntless daredevils
of the flying trapeze,

986
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:26,599
breathtaking, death-defying
marvels in midair!

987
01:12:05,943 --> 01:12:07,022
Hey!

988
01:12:07,736 --> 01:12:08,899
Hello.

989
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:11,860
You crazy devil, how
did you get up here?

990
01:12:11,949 --> 01:12:13,324
I bribed your catcher.

991
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:15,816
- Let me go!
- Kiss me.

992
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:17,489
Look, you're holding up the act.

993
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:27,577
I could swing with
you forever like this.

994
01:12:27,673 --> 01:12:29,215
Why will you not see me anymore?

995
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,799
- They're waiting. Please put me back.
- Not until you kiss me.

996
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:36,338
When I kiss you, I need both
feet on the ground. Let me go.

997
01:12:36,974 --> 01:12:40,058
- You really insist, chérie?
- Yes! Let me go!

998
01:12:42,188 --> 01:12:43,433
Goodbye.

999
01:12:55,242 --> 01:12:57,401
Sebastian wont give up, Brad.

1000
01:12:57,495 --> 01:12:59,653
You better marry me quick
or I'm a gone pigeon.

1001
01:12:59,747 --> 01:13:02,831
You get back up there and finish
the act or you'll be a dead pigeon.

1002
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:04,162
Yes, sir.

1003
01:13:17,723 --> 01:13:19,301
We got trouble on the midway.

1004
01:13:19,391 --> 01:13:21,799
- Harry?
- Yeah, his doll concession.

1005
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:26,354
Get yourself a little spending
money. Here we go for another spin.

1006
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,267
The more you play, the more you win.

1007
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:31,562
- Lets go, Sam. You can't win at this.
- I got no more money anyhow.

1008
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:35,817
Come on, mister, you can't quit now.
You're bound to hit it this time.

1009
01:13:35,908 --> 01:13:37,616
What do you think you're
doing? Let go of me.

1010
01:13:37,701 --> 01:13:41,035
- How much did you lose, lady?
- This months egg money, nearly $50.

1011
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:42,580
Take this. Go on in and enjoy the show.

1012
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:44,373
Get rid of the customers, Joe.

1013
01:13:46,752 --> 01:13:48,792
Don't mix it, Brad. You'll get hurt.

1014
01:13:48,879 --> 01:13:52,248
- You know I run a clean show.
- You're not running me!

1015
01:13:54,426 --> 01:13:56,917
Hey, did you see that?
Right in the kisser!

1016
01:13:57,012 --> 01:13:58,804
Hey, look out, Brad!

1017
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:05,010
The boss finally caught you, huh?

1018
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:06,479
Nice going.

1019
01:14:12,236 --> 01:14:13,351
Do you know who's backing me?

1020
01:14:13,445 --> 01:14:15,438
Yeah, and he's backing
your whole dirty setup.

1021
01:14:15,531 --> 01:14:17,025
Now get going.

1022
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:27,083
The luscious Phyllis dances and sings

1023
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:30,619
to the sultry south sea strains

1024
01:14:30,713 --> 01:14:33,548
of Lovely Luawana Lady!

1025
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:15,836
Lovely Luawana lady

1026
01:15:15,966 --> 01:15:20,296
When your hopes and dreams grow fadey

1027
01:15:20,387 --> 01:15:26,307
Don't you ever be afraid
He wont come back to you

1028
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:32,105
Lovely Luawana lady

1029
01:15:32,191 --> 01:15:35,441
Where those yukes and jukes are played

1030
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:39,193
He dreams of all the dreams he made

1031
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:42,899
And longs that they'll come true

1032
01:15:42,993 --> 01:15:44,867
Ever since he's back

1033
01:15:44,954 --> 01:15:48,204
There's been no lack of gals

1034
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,247
But, gee, they're slow

1035
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:54,876
They don't have that wicky wack

1036
01:15:54,964 --> 01:15:58,831
You taught him there
when the moon was low

1037
01:15:58,926 --> 01:16:03,837
Now every Susie, Sal, and Sadie

1038
01:16:03,931 --> 01:16:07,715
Just becomes a memory shady

1039
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:11,345
Lovely Luawana lady

1040
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:16,777
When he dreams of you

1041
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,246
You made a mistake, Mr.
Braden, a bad mistake,

1042
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:56,614
throwing my games off the lot.

1043
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:00,162
They're off, Mr. Henderson,
and they stay off.

1044
01:18:00,256 --> 01:18:02,663
It might save you a lot of
trouble if you let Harry come back.

1045
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:05,712
Wherever you operate, the
midways crawling with pickpockets

1046
01:18:05,803 --> 01:18:07,427
and crooked gambling.

1047
01:18:07,513 --> 01:18:10,680
One rotten apple like you
can ruin a whole circus.

1048
01:18:11,642 --> 01:18:13,350
You know, you're not so tough.

1049
01:18:13,435 --> 01:18:15,013
You wont stand a chance
fighting my outfit.

1050
01:18:15,104 --> 01:18:19,101
- I've never run away from a fight yet.
- And I've never lost one.

1051
01:18:19,858 --> 01:18:22,694
There's no smoking allowed
in here, Mr. Henderson.

1052
01:18:22,778 --> 01:18:26,313
Don't throw it away.
I'll show you the way out.

1053
01:19:34,099 --> 01:19:37,931
Lovely Luawana lady

1054
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:41,638
When your hopes and dreams grow fadey

1055
01:19:41,732 --> 01:19:44,816
Don't you ever be afraid

1056
01:19:44,902 --> 01:19:48,437
He wont come back to you

1057
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:53,157
Now every Susie, Sal, and Sadie

1058
01:19:53,244 --> 01:19:56,613
Just becomes a memory shady

1059
01:19:56,705 --> 01:20:00,620
Lovely Luawana lady

1060
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:05,786
When he dreams of you

1061
01:20:18,269 --> 01:20:20,475
Are you afraid to speak to me?

1062
01:20:22,398 --> 01:20:26,265
The applause, the centre ring, you
do not try to steal them anymore.

1063
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:29,527
I don't have to. The only
net I use is in my hair.

1064
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:41,116
- That net, it was the boss mans orders.
- Safety first.

1065
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:44,707
- Who can be safe near you?
- You can.

1066
01:20:45,796 --> 01:20:47,207
Ringmaster?

1067
01:20:47,298 --> 01:20:50,749
I have a surprise for you. I
fly from the big rigging tonight.

1068
01:20:50,843 --> 01:20:52,966
Oh, Mr. Thompson, when I
signal, will you announce

1069
01:20:53,053 --> 01:20:57,596
that I will do a double forward
over the bar through a paper hoop.

1070
01:20:57,683 --> 01:20:59,640
- A double?
- Through a hoop?

1071
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:01,351
Through a hoop.

1072
01:21:01,437 --> 01:21:03,513
That's not so much with a net under you.

1073
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:05,931
Stop it, you two. You're on.

1074
01:21:09,904 --> 01:21:11,184
Chérie...

1075
01:21:13,782 --> 01:21:15,740
The net, it bothers you?

1076
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,750
- You crazy fool!
- No net.

1077
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,624
Thank you, my friend.

1078
01:21:25,419 --> 01:21:28,788
Ladies and gentlemen,

1079
01:21:28,881 --> 01:21:31,917
the sensation of the ages!

1080
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:37,096
In ring one,

1081
01:21:37,181 --> 01:21:41,642
the beautiful and spectacular
queen of the flying trapeze,

1082
01:21:41,727 --> 01:21:44,218
the incredible Holly!

1083
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:46,638
And in the centre ring,

1084
01:21:46,732 --> 01:21:50,944
the outstanding aerial
daredevil of all time,

1085
01:21:51,028 --> 01:21:55,773
the debonair king of the
air, The Great Sebastian!

1086
01:21:59,828 --> 01:22:01,027
No net.

1087
01:23:44,308 --> 01:23:46,881
And now, for the first time

1088
01:23:46,977 --> 01:23:49,433
in this or any other circus,

1089
01:23:50,064 --> 01:23:54,726
The Great Sebastian will
attempt a double somersault

1090
01:23:54,818 --> 01:23:57,903
over the bar, through a hoop,

1091
01:23:57,988 --> 01:24:02,235
scorning a net or any
other safety device.

1092
01:24:03,786 --> 01:24:05,446
Hope he makes it.

1093
01:24:11,752 --> 01:24:15,251
Sebastian, no! Don't
try it without the net!

1094
01:24:20,678 --> 01:24:21,757
Who took that net down?

1095
01:24:21,845 --> 01:24:24,681
- He did. You want it up again?
- It's too late now. He's ready to go.

1096
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:44,784
Go on, now.

1097
01:24:45,995 --> 01:24:47,405
Keep the show rolling.

1098
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:49,572
Roll up this net. Clowns!

1099
01:24:49,665 --> 01:24:52,121
Holly, keep it going.
Go into your swing.

1100
01:24:52,835 --> 01:24:53,914
No.

1101
01:24:59,091 --> 01:25:00,466
Walk me off.

1102
01:25:02,928 --> 01:25:05,253
Do not rob me of my exit.

1103
01:25:06,265 --> 01:25:07,463
All right.

1104
01:25:07,558 --> 01:25:10,974
Your arm, boss man. Your strong arm.

1105
01:25:11,061 --> 01:25:12,306
Easy now.

1106
01:25:26,243 --> 01:25:28,319
Keep your seats, please!

1107
01:25:28,412 --> 01:25:32,326
The Great Sebastian is
shaken but not badly hurt.

1108
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:35,750
The performance is now continuing!

1109
01:25:35,836 --> 01:25:38,707
Resume your seats! Please!

1110
01:26:04,448 --> 01:26:07,366
- Birdie, is he dead?
- No, I don't think so.

1111
01:26:09,578 --> 01:26:11,072
Draw it back.

1112
01:26:12,206 --> 01:26:13,830
- Carefully now.
- All right.

1113
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:16,703
Back to wardrobe,
girls. Back to wardrobe.

1114
01:26:18,587 --> 01:26:20,959
- Will he be all right, Doc?
- He's lucky to be alive.

1115
01:26:21,048 --> 01:26:22,423
- Thanks for the help, Buttons.
- Okay.

1116
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:24,880
Where did you ever learn
to do a Velpeau bandage?

1117
01:26:25,511 --> 01:26:27,800
Well, you learn a lot when
you're a pharmacists mate.

1118
01:26:27,888 --> 01:26:30,510
You must've been the best in the Navy.

1119
01:26:36,313 --> 01:26:38,057
Gee, he's hurt bad.

1120
01:26:40,985 --> 01:26:42,064
The other way. Turn him around.

1121
01:26:42,152 --> 01:26:44,192
Don't transfer him. Just
leave him on this stretcher.

1122
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,608
Sebastian!

1123
01:26:46,949 --> 01:26:50,365
Of all the crazy things.
Why did you do it?

1124
01:26:51,412 --> 01:26:54,531
I didn't mean for it
to happen like this.

1125
01:26:54,623 --> 01:26:56,948
Only he would try
such a wonderful trick.

1126
01:26:57,042 --> 01:27:00,826
- And you almost did it.
- I will do it. The next time.

1127
01:27:00,921 --> 01:27:02,332
Sure, you will.

1128
01:27:02,423 --> 01:27:05,044
And when you come back, you'll
stand them on their ears.

1129
01:27:05,134 --> 01:27:08,467
When I come back, chérie,
you will fall. For me.

1130
01:27:08,554 --> 01:27:12,386
All right, get him in there.
Lets get started. Get a move on.

1131
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:21,936
Oh, Brad.

1132
01:27:25,779 --> 01:27:29,148
Flyers have fallen
before. They will again.

1133
01:27:30,534 --> 01:27:32,326
He wont die, pigeon.

1134
01:27:34,288 --> 01:27:36,696
Your rig goes in centre ring tomorrow.

1135
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:39,626
But I didn't want it like this,

1136
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,953
not over his broken body.

1137
01:27:48,969 --> 01:27:54,011
Under the big top, only two
days count, today and tomorrow.

1138
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:59,393
The circus rolls on whether
flyers rise or flyers fall.

1139
01:28:00,564 --> 01:28:01,809
And week after week,

1140
01:28:01,899 --> 01:28:05,482
new audiences laugh at
the antics of the clowns

1141
01:28:05,569 --> 01:28:09,781
and thrill to incredible
feats of skill and daring.

1142
01:28:50,489 --> 01:28:54,072
Hot roasted peanuts. Peanuts.
Get them while they're hot.

1143
01:29:10,718 --> 01:29:12,710
Hot roasted peanuts.

1144
01:29:12,803 --> 01:29:14,381
I can't watch it.

1145
01:31:12,506 --> 01:31:14,000
Higher, higher!

1146
01:31:14,717 --> 01:31:18,501
- Take another crack at it, Holly.
- Higher this time. Sky's the limit.

1147
01:31:18,929 --> 01:31:20,637
Play it, Emmett. Give me some rhythm.

1148
01:31:20,723 --> 01:31:22,680
Yeah, maybe that'll help.

1149
01:31:22,766 --> 01:31:24,177
Well, whistle or something.

1150
01:31:24,268 --> 01:31:27,222
- Anybody got a lemon?
- You think that'll work?

1151
01:31:29,273 --> 01:31:31,266
- Start your jug band.
- Noodle it up.

1152
01:31:31,358 --> 01:31:34,145
- Give it plenty of bounce!
- Yeah, pick it up, Ed.

1153
01:31:36,906 --> 01:31:38,400
Hit it, Holly!

1154
01:31:39,074 --> 01:31:42,526
When things go wrong and life's no song

1155
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:45,111
And you're flat on your back

1156
01:31:46,165 --> 01:31:49,415
That doesn't mean you have to lie there

1157
01:31:49,501 --> 01:31:51,660
Be a jumpin' jack

1158
01:31:52,713 --> 01:31:55,880
Keep on the hop and if you flop

1159
01:31:55,966 --> 01:31:59,252
In every single plan

1160
01:31:59,345 --> 01:32:02,714
Stand on your head and holler, Hi, there

1161
01:32:02,806 --> 01:32:05,048
Be a jumpin' jack

1162
01:32:05,893 --> 01:32:09,143
When things go up They must come down

1163
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:12,433
And also vice-a verse

1164
01:32:12,524 --> 01:32:15,691
If things look bad, don't fret and frown

1165
01:32:15,778 --> 01:32:17,901
They could be ten times worse

1166
01:32:17,988 --> 01:32:19,067
Get Emmett!

1167
01:32:19,156 --> 01:32:20,734
Your train of luck

1168
01:32:20,824 --> 01:32:22,283
It may get stuck

1169
01:32:22,368 --> 01:32:25,653
If something's on the track

1170
01:32:25,746 --> 01:32:26,861
Take a good jump

1171
01:32:26,956 --> 01:32:28,865
And you'll get by there

1172
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:31,912
Be a jumpin' jack

1173
01:32:45,266 --> 01:32:47,591
Oh, Sebastian, you're back.

1174
01:32:48,394 --> 01:32:50,102
- Hi, there, gorgeous.
- We missed you.

1175
01:32:50,187 --> 01:32:52,263
A stitch in time saves more than nine.

1176
01:32:52,356 --> 01:32:54,764
I'll bet they took plenty in you.

1177
01:32:55,234 --> 01:32:57,357
Hey, you were doing this when I left.

1178
01:33:02,157 --> 01:33:04,695
- Hello.
- Sebastian, you're out of the hospital.

1179
01:33:04,785 --> 01:33:06,991
Yes, but never out of
danger when I see you.

1180
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,705
Hello, Sebastian.

1181
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:13,793
Fine. I hope both your heads are well.

1182
01:33:15,337 --> 01:33:18,007
Vita, don't eat too much. You'll
break your sisters pretty neck.

1183
01:33:19,466 --> 01:33:22,302
Well, if it isn't Superman!

1184
01:33:22,386 --> 01:33:25,470
- Something will get burned.
- It sure will.

1185
01:33:29,101 --> 01:33:32,684
If you play with fire, you get
burned. I still have my scar.

1186
01:33:33,397 --> 01:33:36,932
Brad! Oh, Brad! Sebastian's back!

1187
01:33:37,026 --> 01:33:38,817
Oh, good, good.

1188
01:33:40,446 --> 01:33:41,691
Cucciola!

1189
01:33:47,494 --> 01:33:49,321
Say, it looks like the
hospital agreed with you.

1190
01:33:49,413 --> 01:33:50,611
So did the nurses.

1191
01:33:50,706 --> 01:33:52,782
- Hi, Sebastian.
- Hello. How are you?

1192
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:54,203
I'll open your trunk
and lay your stuff out.

1193
01:33:54,293 --> 01:33:55,668
Thank you.

1194
01:33:56,795 --> 01:33:59,915
Hey, good to see you. Now maybe
I'll get my five bucks back.

1195
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:01,834
Maybe I'll borrow five more.

1196
01:34:01,926 --> 01:34:04,214
Sebastian, it sure wasn't
the same without you, fella.

1197
01:34:04,303 --> 01:34:07,008
Hello. I practised somersaults
in my bed every day.

1198
01:34:07,097 --> 01:34:09,339
But did you do any bedsprings?

1199
01:34:09,934 --> 01:34:12,685
Why is it whenever
he's around I'm all wet?

1200
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:14,597
In more ways than one.

1201
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:19,691
If you should slip and lose your grip

1202
01:34:19,777 --> 01:34:23,193
Get up and bounce right back

1203
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,688
Act just like a rubber ball...

1204
01:34:25,783 --> 01:34:27,692
Look, Holly! Sebastian!

1205
01:34:29,703 --> 01:34:30,866
Sebastian.

1206
01:34:30,955 --> 01:34:32,663
He sure looks good.

1207
01:34:32,748 --> 01:34:35,369
- It's been three months.
- Yeah, that's right. So it is.

1208
01:34:35,793 --> 01:34:38,331
Hello, Sebastian. Glad
you're out of the hospital.

1209
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,662
I'm sorry you weren't with me.

1210
01:34:41,215 --> 01:34:42,377
The show missed you.

1211
01:34:42,466 --> 01:34:43,794
Sebastian!

1212
01:34:44,885 --> 01:34:46,214
- Sebastian.
- Holly.

1213
01:34:46,303 --> 01:34:49,886
Oh, jiminy crickets! Oh, gosh!

1214
01:34:49,974 --> 01:34:51,883
I've never been so happy to see anyone.

1215
01:34:51,976 --> 01:34:54,467
Are you all right
again? Really all right?

1216
01:34:55,312 --> 01:34:57,554
Let me see if it's really you.

1217
01:34:57,648 --> 01:35:00,898
It was a wonderful hospital.
And such nurses, too.

1218
01:35:00,985 --> 01:35:03,772
And we were worried about this big lug.

1219
01:35:03,862 --> 01:35:05,273
This calls for a celebration.

1220
01:35:05,364 --> 01:35:08,400
He came back when he heard how
good you were in the centre ring.

1221
01:35:08,492 --> 01:35:09,903
I was just keeping it warm for you.

1222
01:35:09,994 --> 01:35:12,615
- I do not want it.
- Why not?

1223
01:35:12,705 --> 01:35:15,456
- You don't want the centre ring back?
- Why not?

1224
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:17,830
Because I just came back
to collect my things.

1225
01:35:18,669 --> 01:35:19,914
What for?

1226
01:35:20,754 --> 01:35:22,712
- Match?
- No, thank you.

1227
01:35:23,215 --> 01:35:25,208
Collect your...

1228
01:35:25,301 --> 01:35:27,092
Now I know he's kidding.

1229
01:35:28,637 --> 01:35:31,175
No, no. I dropped over
at the Columbia show.

1230
01:35:31,265 --> 01:35:32,807
Columbia?

1231
01:35:32,892 --> 01:35:35,596
We've been fighting them in
every town since you left.

1232
01:35:37,187 --> 01:35:39,975
I ran into somebody over there
I had not seen since Paris,

1233
01:35:40,065 --> 01:35:42,141
and very charming.

1234
01:35:43,861 --> 01:35:46,019
You know how it is. These things happen.

1235
01:35:46,947 --> 01:35:49,023
No. What happens?

1236
01:35:49,116 --> 01:35:52,817
You know. A pearl loses
it's luster in time.

1237
01:35:53,787 --> 01:35:56,076
Champagne goes flat, doesn't it?

1238
01:35:56,165 --> 01:35:59,664
Even the blond bubbling
kind goes flat very quickly.

1239
01:36:01,545 --> 01:36:03,621
Well, I will get my gear and rigging.

1240
01:36:03,714 --> 01:36:05,422
You don't plan to work
for Columbia, do you?

1241
01:36:05,507 --> 01:36:08,259
Let him go, Brad. He's
found some more stardust.

1242
01:36:08,344 --> 01:36:09,589
No, he hasn't.

1243
01:36:09,678 --> 01:36:13,012
Chérie, I return you to
sawdust. Sawdust to sawdust.

1244
01:36:13,098 --> 01:36:15,886
You wouldn't work for Columbia.
You're The Great Sebastian.

1245
01:36:15,976 --> 01:36:18,811
You wouldn't give up the centre
ring for anything or anybody,

1246
01:36:18,896 --> 01:36:20,473
unless you couldn't hold it.

1247
01:36:20,564 --> 01:36:22,806
You've been lying ever
since you came in here.

1248
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:25,817
- Now lets see the truth.
- Keep your hands off...

1249
01:36:27,905 --> 01:36:31,903
- You should not have done that.
- That's why you wouldn't shake hands.

1250
01:36:41,335 --> 01:36:43,541
You weren't going to Columbia.

1251
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:47,002
There wasn't any girl from Paris.

1252
01:36:47,967 --> 01:36:49,758
You just didn't want me to know...

1253
01:36:51,011 --> 01:36:53,170
To know what Id done.

1254
01:36:57,393 --> 01:37:00,310
No, no, no, chérie.
You have done nothing.

1255
01:37:01,605 --> 01:37:02,981
It is life.

1256
01:37:04,858 --> 01:37:06,602
No one is to blame.

1257
01:37:08,988 --> 01:37:12,820
- Can't something be done?
- No. They have tried.

1258
01:37:17,037 --> 01:37:18,829
May I have my coat, please?

1259
01:37:18,914 --> 01:37:22,532
There's a job for you in this
show as long as you want it.

1260
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:26,128
One more cripple
hanging on to the circus?

1261
01:37:26,213 --> 01:37:30,626
Watching others flying through the
air while I am crawling on the ground?

1262
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,883
You are meaning to be kind, boss man,

1263
01:37:33,971 --> 01:37:36,888
but you and I both know
it is better that I go.

1264
01:37:39,143 --> 01:37:40,222
Don't let him go, Brad!

1265
01:37:40,311 --> 01:37:43,976
Holly, he's grounded for good.
Hell go crazy if he stays.

1266
01:37:48,277 --> 01:37:51,313
- I did that to him.
- No, he took the chance.

1267
01:37:52,197 --> 01:37:55,780
I did it to him, as
surely as if Id shot him.

1268
01:37:55,868 --> 01:37:59,403
- You had nothing to do with it.
- Oh, yes, I did, Brad.

1269
01:37:59,496 --> 01:38:01,370
I made him take that net down.

1270
01:38:01,457 --> 01:38:05,917
I laughed at him. I razzed him into
it. That's what made him take it down!

1271
01:38:06,337 --> 01:38:09,006
You two crazy fools.

1272
01:38:11,383 --> 01:38:13,257
He was tops in the air.

1273
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:19,300
Now he's tied to a dead arm
for the rest of his life,

1274
01:38:20,434 --> 01:38:21,809
a claw hand.

1275
01:38:23,103 --> 01:38:26,887
- It would've been kinder if Id killed him.
- Holly, this is circus.

1276
01:38:26,982 --> 01:38:30,766
Brad, you can't realise what it
means not to go up there again.

1277
01:38:30,861 --> 01:38:32,605
Maybe I can.

1278
01:38:32,696 --> 01:38:34,488
That's why it's better to let him go.

1279
01:38:34,573 --> 01:38:37,111
- If he goes, I'm going with him.
- Holly, don't be a fool!

1280
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:41,115
You saw the way he hid his arm,
said things to make me hate him.

1281
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:45,624
He said them because he
didn't want me to know...

1282
01:38:45,709 --> 01:38:47,998
To know that Id smashed him,

1283
01:38:48,545 --> 01:38:50,455
smashed his whole life.

1284
01:38:52,132 --> 01:38:56,379
He didn't want me to
know because he loves me.

1285
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:58,297
And I've got to make it up
to him for what I've done.

1286
01:38:58,389 --> 01:38:59,503
All right, you smashed him.

1287
01:38:59,598 --> 01:39:02,516
Do you think smashing all
three of us will help him?

1288
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:04,475
You don't need me, Brad.

1289
01:39:04,562 --> 01:39:06,186
You've got what you love.

1290
01:39:06,272 --> 01:39:08,644
You've got the circus. But what's he got?

1291
01:39:08,732 --> 01:39:11,982
He's got guts. That guys
tough. He doesn't need sympathy.

1292
01:39:12,069 --> 01:39:14,940
He can take this if you leave
him alone. He doesn't need pity.

1293
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:17,319
I'm not going to give him pity.

1294
01:39:18,325 --> 01:39:21,492
I'm going to try and give him love.

1295
01:39:29,962 --> 01:39:31,041
Yeah?

1296
01:39:33,841 --> 01:39:35,169
All right.

1297
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:09,041
- What do you want?
- To help you.

1298
01:40:09,126 --> 01:40:11,202
I don't want any help.
I don't need any help.

1299
01:40:11,295 --> 01:40:14,249
You come here to cry over me,
go somewhere else. I am packing.

1300
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:16,628
You don't even know where you're going.

1301
01:40:16,717 --> 01:40:19,718
Besides, wherever it
is, what could you do

1302
01:40:19,803 --> 01:40:21,547
that you couldn't do
here with me to help you?

1303
01:40:21,639 --> 01:40:23,382
What do think you could do for me?

1304
01:40:23,474 --> 01:40:26,143
Well, I could fold this
cape a little better.

1305
01:40:26,227 --> 01:40:28,552
Oh, I see. Now I'm a cripple.

1306
01:40:28,646 --> 01:40:30,519
You would dress me,
undress me, cut up my food,

1307
01:40:30,606 --> 01:40:33,393
wait on me like a little
child. No, thank you.

1308
01:40:33,484 --> 01:40:35,809
If you want to be kind, please go.

1309
01:40:35,903 --> 01:40:37,730
I want to be with you, wherever you are.

1310
01:40:37,821 --> 01:40:40,692
You are lying. You are sorry for me.

1311
01:40:40,783 --> 01:40:43,534
You want to pay me because you
teased me to cut down the net!

1312
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:44,817
That isn't true.

1313
01:40:44,912 --> 01:40:49,408
You fell in love with me when I was
The Great Sebastian, king in the air,

1314
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,584
a flash of lightning in the centre ring.

1315
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:55,955
On the ground, it is
someone else you love.

1316
01:40:56,048 --> 01:40:57,626
That's all over.

1317
01:41:00,678 --> 01:41:02,551
Go back to the boss man.

1318
01:41:02,638 --> 01:41:04,677
Don't think I am
finished because of this.

1319
01:41:04,765 --> 01:41:06,592
If I want someone, I'll ask her myself.

1320
01:41:06,684 --> 01:41:09,887
Women are no problem for
me. I find them anywhere.

1321
01:41:11,021 --> 01:41:13,144
You came back because you love me.

1322
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,102
You would like to believe
that, wouldn't you?

1323
01:41:19,196 --> 01:41:20,441
It was for this I came back.

1324
01:41:20,531 --> 01:41:22,274
- You did not.
- My rig.

1325
01:41:23,993 --> 01:41:26,116
Well, I can sell it anyway.

1326
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:31,245
You should be dressing for the show.
The applause, it is all yours now.

1327
01:41:31,333 --> 01:41:32,412
You've got the centre ring.

1328
01:41:32,668 --> 01:41:36,666
I can't take it away from you. I
can't even applaud you properly.

1329
01:41:36,964 --> 01:41:39,087
Say anything you like.

1330
01:41:39,174 --> 01:41:40,882
Hit me if you want.

1331
01:41:41,635 --> 01:41:46,131
- It wont change the way I feel.
- Maybe I would like to hit you for lying.

1332
01:41:51,478 --> 01:41:53,804
No one is to blame but me. I...

1333
01:41:54,607 --> 01:41:58,141
- Please, I must hurry.
- You're not going.

1334
01:41:58,235 --> 01:42:02,399
You're tied to the circus, and whether
you like it or not, you're tied to me.

1335
01:42:02,823 --> 01:42:05,148
You think I would tie you to this?

1336
01:42:07,328 --> 01:42:09,700
It wasn't your arm I fell in love with.

1337
01:42:11,206 --> 01:42:12,665
Or your hand.

1338
01:42:13,417 --> 01:42:15,326
I fell in love with you.

1339
01:42:16,045 --> 01:42:18,666
Id give my other arm
if I could believe you.

1340
01:42:19,381 --> 01:42:22,168
What does a girl have to
say to make a blind man see?

1341
01:42:22,259 --> 01:42:25,628
Say that you'll stay, that
you'll never leave me, ever.

1342
01:42:26,222 --> 01:42:29,673
This is not because
you are sorry for me?

1343
01:42:31,227 --> 01:42:33,433
You bet your life I'm sorry for you.

1344
01:42:34,355 --> 01:42:36,394
You're stuck with a blonde,

1345
01:42:36,523 --> 01:42:38,516
and you'll never get away.

1346
01:42:39,235 --> 01:42:43,102
Chérie, how I would love you.

1347
01:42:46,575 --> 01:42:48,367
Hey, wait for me, Anita!

1348
01:43:02,049 --> 01:43:03,543
Step it up kids, were on.

1349
01:43:03,634 --> 01:43:05,840
- Is my hat okay?
- Nobody's gonna see you.

1350
01:43:05,928 --> 01:43:08,004
Keep your coop to yourself today.

1351
01:43:12,226 --> 01:43:13,934
Picnic in the park.

1352
01:43:28,742 --> 01:43:33,488
A regal cavalcade with
Queen Marie Antoinette

1353
01:43:33,581 --> 01:43:37,792
and her gay court at
the royal horse show.

1354
01:43:43,924 --> 01:43:46,296
Remember, you're supposed to be a queen.

1355
01:45:00,584 --> 01:45:03,075
You're for the birds, that's for sure.

1356
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:06,254
Giving up your life to
Sebastian because he's washed up.

1357
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,463
Who do you think you are?
Joan of Arc or somebody?

1358
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:10,258
What does it matter to you what I do?

1359
01:45:10,344 --> 01:45:14,258
Go ahead. Play noble. That halo
is gonna slip, sugar. It's phoney.

1360
01:45:14,348 --> 01:45:15,723
It'll be around your neck.

1361
01:45:15,808 --> 01:45:17,847
Where would you wear yours?

1362
01:45:21,105 --> 01:45:23,726
Say, why are you so steamed
up about me and Sebastian?

1363
01:45:23,816 --> 01:45:25,144
Sebastian?

1364
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:27,808
I don't care if you
break him up for firewood.

1365
01:45:27,903 --> 01:45:30,062
He asked for it,
playing around with you.

1366
01:45:30,155 --> 01:45:33,073
But Brads on the level. He
didn't have this coming to him.

1367
01:45:33,158 --> 01:45:34,902
Brad hasn't got time for love.

1368
01:45:34,994 --> 01:45:37,663
- Okay, I'll take Brad the way he is.
- That is, if you're his type.

1369
01:45:37,746 --> 01:45:39,739
Who are you calling a type?

1370
01:45:40,499 --> 01:45:43,535
Maybe I have been over the
course a few too many times.

1371
01:45:43,627 --> 01:45:46,581
But I've got a heart under this
costume with room in it for one guy.

1372
01:45:46,672 --> 01:45:49,589
You busted him apart, and
I'm gonna pick up the pieces.

1373
01:45:49,675 --> 01:45:51,751
Hell never miss you, sugar.

1374
01:45:51,927 --> 01:45:54,762
I'm going to give him
more than you ever could.

1375
01:45:54,847 --> 01:45:57,599
Maybe so. You've had
plenty of experience.

1376
01:47:17,096 --> 01:47:18,294
You'll never make it.

1377
01:47:18,389 --> 01:47:19,847
- Did you see him?
- No. Where?

1378
01:47:19,932 --> 01:47:21,509
Here's your toothpick!

1379
01:48:13,861 --> 01:48:18,439
When the lights go out on this
glittering realm of sawdust and popcorn,

1380
01:48:18,532 --> 01:48:22,826
the circus puts off it's spangles
and climbs into battle dress

1381
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:25,699
for the nightly combat
with time and distance.

1382
01:48:26,874 --> 01:48:31,203
The tear-down is a wild tangle
of man, machine and beast,

1383
01:48:31,462 --> 01:48:34,131
an orderly disorder of ropes

1384
01:48:34,214 --> 01:48:37,418
and metal poles and steel cable

1385
01:48:37,676 --> 01:48:39,633
and tons of heavy canvas.

1386
01:48:40,429 --> 01:48:42,671
Yet out of this apparent chaos,

1387
01:48:43,265 --> 01:48:45,673
these people bring tomorrows show,

1388
01:48:46,101 --> 01:48:48,557
fresh and new and gay and hot,

1389
01:48:49,438 --> 01:48:54,349
no matter how tangled the
skein of their own lives may be.

1390
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:58,061
Ruth! Don't eat them newspapers!

1391
01:48:58,656 --> 01:49:00,613
I told you to leave them lay.

1392
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:02,658
No, no, Ruth, Ruth.

1393
01:49:02,743 --> 01:49:04,617
You'll get a tummy ache.

1394
01:49:05,037 --> 01:49:07,326
She likes the candy that is stuck to it.

1395
01:49:24,265 --> 01:49:26,471
He killed the thing he loved.

1396
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:30,055
Buttons, look.

1397
01:49:30,604 --> 01:49:33,938
- You said that.
- Did I?

1398
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:37,902
Well, don't believe everything you hear.

1399
01:49:38,487 --> 01:49:40,396
And only half of what you see.

1400
01:49:53,877 --> 01:49:55,336
I can believe that.

1401
01:49:55,504 --> 01:49:58,671
So you see, chérie? All
men are alike except...

1402
01:49:58,757 --> 01:50:00,168
I know. Except you.

1403
01:50:00,259 --> 01:50:02,335
Come on, lets go down to the car.

1404
01:50:09,602 --> 01:50:10,764
Hello?

1405
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,683
Hello?

1406
01:50:13,022 --> 01:50:14,564
No, John North.

1407
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:18,307
Hello, Johnny? It's Brad.

1408
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:21,603
Sure, Johnny, Sebastian's back.

1409
01:50:21,989 --> 01:50:24,065
Yeah, he's staying with the show.

1410
01:50:24,742 --> 01:50:26,152
No, he can't.

1411
01:50:26,744 --> 01:50:29,994
Not his old act, but he's in the show.

1412
01:50:30,497 --> 01:50:31,696
Me?

1413
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:34,458
Why do you ask that?

1414
01:50:34,585 --> 01:50:36,791
There's nothing wrong with me.

1415
01:50:37,212 --> 01:50:39,170
Business is holding up fine.

1416
01:50:39,715 --> 01:50:41,589
The advance sale is fine.

1417
01:50:41,675 --> 01:50:43,335
Everything's fine.

1418
01:50:43,469 --> 01:50:46,138
And were a cinch to keep
going the full season.

1419
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:47,301
Yeah.

1420
01:50:47,765 --> 01:50:49,342
So long, Johnny.

1421
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,007
- The full season? That's great.
- Yeah.

1422
01:50:53,395 --> 01:50:55,353
Aren't you in the wrong wagon?

1423
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:57,266
Not the way this one looks.

1424
01:50:57,650 --> 01:51:01,398
- Don't touch that.
- A brass hat.

1425
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:03,689
What's all this housekeeping?

1426
01:51:03,781 --> 01:51:05,441
Just housekeeping.

1427
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:10,735
Well, go do it someplace else.
The boys take care of all this.

1428
01:51:11,038 --> 01:51:13,529
- You are a sourpuss, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1429
01:51:13,624 --> 01:51:15,866
- You want to bite somebody?
- Yeah.

1430
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:17,620
Well, pick your spot.

1431
01:51:23,509 --> 01:51:24,884
Needs sugar.

1432
01:51:25,135 --> 01:51:28,551
I wasn't sure how you
liked it. I'll learn.

1433
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:31,474
- Don't bother.
- Sweet?

1434
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,852
Oh. Medium.

1435
01:51:42,987 --> 01:51:46,652
- What do you think you're doing?
- Packing your pipe.

1436
01:51:49,785 --> 01:51:51,445
Well, don't look so worried.

1437
01:51:51,537 --> 01:51:54,075
You never know what you're
gonna like until you try it.

1438
01:51:54,164 --> 01:51:55,244
I...

1439
01:52:05,509 --> 01:52:06,624
Well,

1440
01:52:08,345 --> 01:52:09,970
what do you know?

1441
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:12,303
I used to fill my dads pipe.

1442
01:52:14,059 --> 01:52:16,467
I don't remember seeing you before.

1443
01:52:17,271 --> 01:52:19,726
You didn't. You only looked at me.

1444
01:52:19,815 --> 01:52:21,606
Now, what was that name again?

1445
01:52:21,692 --> 01:52:24,895
Minnie Mouse. Even
elephants are afraid of me.

1446
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:28,315
They're smart animals. Women are poison.

1447
01:52:28,449 --> 01:52:30,192
But it's a wonderful death.

1448
01:52:35,539 --> 01:52:37,532
I'm not dangerous. Honest.

1449
01:52:38,334 --> 01:52:41,085
I just think a guy in
trouble feels better if...

1450
01:52:41,295 --> 01:52:43,288
Well, if there's a woman around.

1451
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:45,962
Just someone to get mad at.

1452
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:55,808
- Well, don't you want some coffee?
- Sure, sugar.

1453
01:52:57,394 --> 01:52:59,304
That's what I came for.

1454
01:53:03,984 --> 01:53:07,318
You know, I never knew a
woman could fill a pipe.

1455
01:53:10,991 --> 01:53:14,158
Heads up! Big wagon coming through!

1456
01:53:33,806 --> 01:53:37,056
Hello, sucker. How
long you gonna take it?

1457
01:53:37,393 --> 01:53:40,263
- Pretty picture, ain't it?
- Shut up.

1458
01:53:40,354 --> 01:53:41,979
Angel likes that guy.

1459
01:53:42,064 --> 01:53:44,057
Why? Because he can give her presents.

1460
01:53:44,149 --> 01:53:46,557
He's got the dough, so he gets the girl.

1461
01:53:47,736 --> 01:53:49,694
What is mine I keep.

1462
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:52,900
Not without dough. But we can get it.

1463
01:53:52,992 --> 01:53:54,949
Get it where it'll hurt, too.

1464
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:03,327
Get with it. You've got
four and a half minutes.

1465
01:54:14,847 --> 01:54:18,346
Brad, you better watch Angel tonight.
The grapevine says she's in for trouble.

1466
01:54:24,189 --> 01:54:27,393
Klaus, the greatest elephant
trainer in the world,

1467
01:54:27,776 --> 01:54:31,525
presents his marvellous
mastodonic mammals,

1468
01:54:31,864 --> 01:54:36,740
gracefully ridden by 20
sultry sirens from the East,

1469
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:41,117
starring Angel, the sultans favourite.

1470
01:54:44,752 --> 01:54:47,456
Butter-coated popcorn.
Get your popcorn here.

1471
01:54:47,546 --> 01:54:49,040
- Hey, one.
- You want some?

1472
01:54:49,256 --> 01:54:50,585
Thank you.

1473
01:55:55,364 --> 01:55:57,191
Steady. Steady.

1474
01:55:57,283 --> 01:55:58,907
Steady. All right.

1475
01:55:59,243 --> 01:56:00,322
Foot.

1476
01:56:00,411 --> 01:56:01,953
Foot. Foot.

1477
01:56:02,246 --> 01:56:04,120
Foot.

1478
01:56:04,206 --> 01:56:06,033
Foot. Foot.

1479
01:56:06,125 --> 01:56:07,204
Foot. Foot.

1480
01:56:07,293 --> 01:56:08,372
Foot.

1481
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:09,623
Steady.

1482
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:11,333
Steady?

1483
01:56:11,922 --> 01:56:13,962
Steady. Come down.

1484
01:56:14,049 --> 01:56:15,627
Steady.

1485
01:56:15,718 --> 01:56:17,128
Steady.

1486
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:22,181
I wouldn't do that
for a million dollars.

1487
01:56:24,101 --> 01:56:27,517
Minyak, see how our
angels eyes shine today.

1488
01:56:27,605 --> 01:56:29,229
She has found a new love.

1489
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:31,603
Quit clowning, sugar. For this
I don't get paid by the hour.

1490
01:56:31,692 --> 01:56:35,772
- Lets get on with the number, huh?
- Oh, you want to hurry back to the boss.

1491
01:56:36,113 --> 01:56:37,940
Maybe he has a present.

1492
01:56:38,282 --> 01:56:40,607
He likes that funny face, huh?

1493
01:56:40,784 --> 01:56:44,948
Tell me, would he still like
it if Minyak leans a little bit?

1494
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:46,782
Klaus, are you nuts? Let me up.

1495
01:56:46,874 --> 01:56:48,498
- Up, Minyak! Up!
- Steady.

1496
01:56:48,584 --> 01:56:51,751
Be careful. You make Minyak nervous.

1497
01:56:52,463 --> 01:56:54,621
Now your eyes shine for me, too,

1498
01:56:54,715 --> 01:56:57,965
because you have fear in your
lovely, lying little heart.

1499
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:02,555
Is she all right?

1500
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:05,973
Steady, Minyak. Is
your foot getting tired?

1501
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,183
You want to put it down?

1502
01:57:08,938 --> 01:57:10,396
No, my sweet.

1503
01:57:10,564 --> 01:57:12,723
You will never go to any other man.

1504
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,642
Foot, Minyak. Foot, foot.

1505
01:57:15,736 --> 01:57:18,309
- You all right?
- That was close to the finale.

1506
01:57:18,405 --> 01:57:20,149
- Augie.
- This is my act.

1507
01:57:20,241 --> 01:57:23,158
Get your things and get off
the lot. Augie, take over.

1508
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:26,198
- Can you finish?
- Sure. I can do anything for you.

1509
01:57:26,288 --> 01:57:27,451
Angel.

1510
01:57:27,665 --> 01:57:29,075
Fresh popcorn.

1511
01:57:32,378 --> 01:57:36,078
- You fire me because...
- Because you're a jealous fool.

1512
01:57:36,465 --> 01:57:39,881
Now get out of here before I
have you up for attempted murder.

1513
01:59:26,075 --> 01:59:27,948
Buy a circus souvenir.

1514
01:59:28,577 --> 01:59:30,321
Take home a balloon for the...

1515
01:59:30,412 --> 01:59:32,903
Would you like a balloon? Good.

1516
01:59:57,064 --> 01:59:58,642
Life has made me a clown.

1517
01:59:58,732 --> 02:00:01,140
It'll have to make you
a better businessman.

1518
02:00:01,235 --> 02:00:02,694
Thank you.

1519
02:00:03,862 --> 02:00:06,235
Hey, little one. You are tickling me.

1520
02:00:06,574 --> 02:00:08,032
You can feel that?

1521
02:00:08,117 --> 02:00:10,359
He's trying to be
friendly, to cheer me up.

1522
02:00:10,452 --> 02:00:12,778
Come on, Sebastian.
Don't block the entrance.

1523
02:00:12,871 --> 02:00:14,615
Get with it, Buttons.

1524
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:25,248
All right, boys, let them
roll. One buck gets you fifty.

1525
02:00:25,342 --> 02:00:29,043
- My dice. I'll bet $3.00.
- Okay, $3.00. Let the dice roll.

1526
02:00:29,138 --> 02:00:30,762
Six. Your point.

1527
02:00:30,848 --> 02:00:34,217
Harry. What we said, I'll do it.

1528
02:00:34,894 --> 02:00:38,393
So you finally got wise, huh? I
got it all figured. It's a cinch.

1529
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,438
- Tonight.
- Sure. Haven't you heard?

1530
02:00:40,524 --> 02:00:43,442
Were giving a party
in the red pay wagon.

1531
02:00:43,527 --> 02:00:46,481
Seven. A loser. Sorry,
friends. No winners. That's all.

1532
02:00:46,572 --> 02:00:49,692
- Hey, wait a minute.
- I said that's all.

1533
02:00:49,783 --> 02:00:50,863
A fine game you got here.

1534
02:00:50,951 --> 02:00:52,825
You don't even get a chance
to get your dough back.

1535
02:01:03,464 --> 02:01:06,169
- Everything all right in there, Curly?
- Okay.

1536
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:08,755
But next year, lets carry
the cash in the gorilla cage.

1537
02:01:08,844 --> 02:01:10,635
It's air-conditioned.

1538
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:14,804
Well, don't let it
sit here and get rusty.

1539
02:01:14,892 --> 02:01:16,600
- Take it away.
- Right.

1540
02:01:23,692 --> 02:01:25,436
Mr. Braden?

1541
02:01:25,527 --> 02:01:26,690
That's right.

1542
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:29,104
Treasury. Special investigations.

1543
02:01:29,281 --> 02:01:30,562
What can I do for you?

1544
02:01:30,658 --> 02:01:33,030
You carry a doctor with this show?

1545
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:35,823
Yes. You usually find
him in the privilege car.

1546
02:01:35,913 --> 02:01:38,238
Does he look anything like this?

1547
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:44,452
No.

1548
02:01:44,546 --> 02:01:45,626
You sure?

1549
02:01:45,714 --> 02:01:47,707
Ten years can make quite a difference.

1550
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:49,508
What's he wanted for?

1551
02:01:49,593 --> 02:01:51,633
Murder. It's an odd case.

1552
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:53,843
A young doctor killed his wife.

1553
02:01:54,139 --> 02:01:55,799
She was dying anyway.

1554
02:01:55,891 --> 02:01:57,683
What will he get?

1555
02:01:58,143 --> 02:02:00,266
I'm a policeman, not a judge.

1556
02:02:01,188 --> 02:02:03,477
- Why pick on us?
- Just a hunch.

1557
02:02:05,192 --> 02:02:07,861
He was always chasing circuses as a kid.

1558
02:02:08,153 --> 02:02:09,897
You wont see that face around here.

1559
02:02:09,989 --> 02:02:11,317
Probably not.

1560
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:14,361
Anyway, I've arranged to fingerprint
some of your people in Cedar City.

1561
02:02:14,451 --> 02:02:15,946
Do you mind if I ride along with you?

1562
02:02:16,036 --> 02:02:19,037
No. The head porter will
fix you up with a berth.

1563
02:02:19,373 --> 02:02:20,832
Thank you.

1564
02:03:02,917 --> 02:03:05,408
About here. That'll stop the
red wagon back at the road.

1565
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:19,303
Come on. Snap it up.

1566
02:03:19,391 --> 02:03:22,226
First section will be along pretty soon.

1567
02:03:24,396 --> 02:03:26,021
Come on. Come on.

1568
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:15,188
- Say, Buttons...
- Here you are, Brad.

1569
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:16,443
- I got the next one.
- Thanks.

1570
02:04:18,284 --> 02:04:19,694
You're always around when there's trouble.

1571
02:04:19,785 --> 02:04:21,694
You're pretty hard to find
when the news is good.

1572
02:04:21,787 --> 02:04:24,788
I got tied up with a
cop who's riding with us.

1573
02:04:24,999 --> 02:04:26,244
He's looking for someone.

1574
02:04:26,333 --> 02:04:27,958
Anything serious?

1575
02:04:28,043 --> 02:04:29,241
Murder.

1576
02:04:30,379 --> 02:04:32,253
He used to be a doctor.

1577
02:04:32,798 --> 02:04:35,503
You find the darnedest people
around a circus, don't you?

1578
02:04:35,593 --> 02:04:36,755
Yeah.

1579
02:04:37,636 --> 02:04:40,637
What was this good
news? I could use some.

1580
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:42,968
Good news?

1581
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:45,970
Sebastian, there.

1582
02:04:46,353 --> 02:04:48,310
He's got feeling in that hand.

1583
02:04:49,356 --> 02:04:53,650
Yes, and if there's still feeling,
complete recovery is very possible.

1584
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:56,812
Is that a professional opinion?

1585
02:04:58,115 --> 02:05:00,191
That's a clowns opinion.

1586
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:02,318
Why don't you rile him up a little?

1587
02:05:02,411 --> 02:05:03,870
Might get your flyer back.

1588
02:05:03,954 --> 02:05:05,662
Yeah, I'll do that.

1589
02:05:06,624 --> 02:05:09,660
By the way, they're going to take
some fingerprints when we get in.

1590
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:11,162
Okay.

1591
02:05:25,184 --> 02:05:26,975
I'll get revenge tomorrow night.

1592
02:05:27,061 --> 02:05:29,018
Always I'm lucky at cards.

1593
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,438
You sure it's luck?

1594
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:34,023
You think I cheat maybe?

1595
02:05:34,109 --> 02:05:36,517
Why not? You've done it before.

1596
02:05:37,363 --> 02:05:39,521
- I do not like this joke.
- It's no joke.

1597
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:40,860
- Steady.
- Wait a minute.

1598
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:42,907
Well, he used his bum arm
to get Holly, didn't he?

1599
02:05:42,993 --> 02:05:44,322
You know you lie.

1600
02:05:44,411 --> 02:05:47,199
You've got it all figured to get yourself
a meal ticket for life, haven't you?

1601
02:05:47,289 --> 02:05:48,783
Latching onto her.

1602
02:05:49,792 --> 02:05:50,871
You moved it.

1603
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:52,869
- He sure did.
- You bet he did.

1604
02:05:54,964 --> 02:05:56,078
That's why you say these things.

1605
02:05:56,173 --> 02:05:57,751
How about it, Doc? Will
he be able to use it?

1606
02:05:57,841 --> 02:06:00,249
- It certainly did move.
- Of course he did, Doc.

1607
02:06:00,344 --> 02:06:02,301
You know, that should get well.

1608
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,387
I believe that with psychosomatic
treatment, that this might be...

1609
02:06:05,474 --> 02:06:06,933
You did this for me?

1610
02:06:07,017 --> 02:06:09,343
For you? I wouldn't
give you storage space.

1611
02:06:09,436 --> 02:06:12,058
But you're a good flyer.
The show needs you.

1612
02:06:12,147 --> 02:06:13,939
Now, keep working on it.

1613
02:06:14,024 --> 02:06:16,266
You crazy, wonderful fool.

1614
02:06:17,653 --> 02:06:20,939
You know that with my wings
clipped, I would never marry Holly.

1615
02:06:21,031 --> 02:06:22,656
Yet you raise me into the air again.

1616
02:06:24,076 --> 02:06:25,950
Because you are circus.

1617
02:06:27,496 --> 02:06:29,453
I must tell Holly.

1618
02:06:30,374 --> 02:06:33,126
Maybe we name our first baby Bossman.

1619
02:06:35,754 --> 02:06:37,379
Good work, Brad.

1620
02:06:37,881 --> 02:06:38,996
Hey, Doc,

1621
02:06:39,091 --> 02:06:41,712
what is this psycho whatchamacallit?

1622
02:06:57,902 --> 02:07:00,143
Wait till the engines passed.

1623
02:07:37,566 --> 02:07:40,437
Unlock the door and don't try anything.

1624
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,383
Pass it down.

1625
02:08:06,387 --> 02:08:07,501
Can you see the trouble?

1626
02:08:07,596 --> 02:08:09,553
Can't see nothing ahead.

1627
02:08:14,728 --> 02:08:17,054
Get going. We gotta burn rubber.

1628
02:08:25,114 --> 02:08:27,402
- What's that?
- Second section.

1629
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:30,524
Look.

1630
02:08:30,619 --> 02:08:32,197
Get out of here. This is the girls car.

1631
02:08:32,288 --> 02:08:33,782
Men are not allowed in here.

1632
02:08:33,872 --> 02:08:34,987
Who'd you come to see?

1633
02:08:35,082 --> 02:08:37,407
What did you do, boy
scout, lose your compass?

1634
02:08:37,501 --> 02:08:38,876
Well, what are you
doing in no mans land?

1635
02:08:38,961 --> 02:08:40,752
Angel, you are going to be a bridesmaid.

1636
02:08:40,838 --> 02:08:42,961
- Who's getting married?
- You are, my darling.

1637
02:08:43,048 --> 02:08:45,124
Angel. She's on that train.

1638
02:08:45,384 --> 02:08:47,424
So what? We got the dough.
Lets get out of here.

1639
02:08:47,511 --> 02:08:50,346
The lights. I must turn the
lights back on the track.

1640
02:08:50,431 --> 02:08:52,008
You crazy lunkhead. Give me that wheel.

1641
02:08:52,099 --> 02:08:54,886
Were going to turn the
lights on the track.

1642
02:08:57,396 --> 02:08:59,768
The train! Stop the train!

1643
02:08:59,857 --> 02:09:01,517
Stop the train!

1644
02:09:05,654 --> 02:09:08,940
Stop! Can't you see the lights? Stop!

1645
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:13,284
First section! Hold it!

1646
02:09:13,370 --> 02:09:14,651
Angel!

1647
02:09:15,664 --> 02:09:17,040
Angel!

1648
02:10:12,471 --> 02:10:13,965
Sebastian.

1649
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:17,676
Hurry. Angels caught under here.

1650
02:10:18,352 --> 02:10:19,515
Hurry.

1651
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:27,892
Doc? Where are you, Doc?

1652
02:10:29,029 --> 02:10:31,485
Bob. Bob, where's the doc?

1653
02:10:31,574 --> 02:10:33,068
How do I know?

1654
02:10:34,076 --> 02:10:36,199
- Help me.
- Sure, Bill, where are you?

1655
02:10:36,287 --> 02:10:37,911
Over here. Help me.

1656
02:10:37,997 --> 02:10:40,155
Okay, hold on. I'll get you out.

1657
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:44,828
My legs are all numb.
I can't feel anything.

1658
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:47,127
- You all right, Brad?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1659
02:10:47,214 --> 02:10:49,290
Break out some fusees, Blackie.

1660
02:10:50,259 --> 02:10:53,129
Get the road torches
going. We need some light.

1661
02:10:53,262 --> 02:10:54,424
If Hanks on his feet,

1662
02:10:54,513 --> 02:10:57,218
have him make torches out of
the waste from the journal boxes.

1663
02:10:57,808 --> 02:10:59,682
We got to get some light here.

1664
02:10:59,768 --> 02:11:02,438
Get this stuff off me. Come on.

1665
02:11:03,355 --> 02:11:04,470
How you doing in there, Bob?

1666
02:11:04,565 --> 02:11:05,763
Not so hot.

1667
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:07,566
That's a new way to
get thrown out of bed.

1668
02:11:07,651 --> 02:11:10,486
Elsie, Jeanne. Where
are you? You all right?

1669
02:11:10,696 --> 02:11:13,317
- Some of these kids are hurt.
- I'll get the doctor.

1670
02:11:13,407 --> 02:11:15,150
No, no, down there. Through the window.

1671
02:11:15,242 --> 02:11:16,986
Rip that sheet. Make some bandages.

1672
02:11:22,917 --> 02:11:25,953
Holy mackerel! Get back in
there, you little devils.

1673
02:11:28,297 --> 02:11:31,713
Rajah, Rajah! Get
back! Get back in there!

1674
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:33,508
No, you don't. Back.

1675
02:11:33,886 --> 02:11:35,629
Come on with those poles.

1676
02:11:37,556 --> 02:11:39,596
Get some welding torches.

1677
02:11:39,767 --> 02:11:40,881
Get in there.

1678
02:11:40,976 --> 02:11:42,435
No place like home, Nero.

1679
02:11:42,519 --> 02:11:44,346
Here's another torch.

1680
02:11:44,688 --> 02:11:46,847
Put a blanket over the glass.

1681
02:11:49,485 --> 02:11:51,608
You can tell that
this ain't the pay line.

1682
02:11:51,695 --> 02:11:54,186
You want water, you can get
it here. Busted water line.

1683
02:11:54,573 --> 02:11:56,649
It's pretty bad in
there. Where's the doctor?

1684
02:11:56,742 --> 02:11:59,411
He was in the privilege car when we hit.

1685
02:12:02,665 --> 02:12:04,788
I can hear them. They're
around here somewhere.

1686
02:12:08,462 --> 02:12:11,214
Come on, boys. Get me out of this junk.

1687
02:12:11,298 --> 02:12:13,421
Hey, Mike, get some men
and round up the cats

1688
02:12:13,509 --> 02:12:14,623
before they smell blood.

1689
02:12:14,718 --> 02:12:15,750
Right, Mr. Braden.

1690
02:12:15,844 --> 02:12:18,382
Somebody check the gorilla cage. The
glass will be broken. Board it up.

1691
02:12:18,472 --> 02:12:21,224
- Okay, boss.
- Keep those babies warm.

1692
02:12:21,308 --> 02:12:22,471
How many killed, Jack?

1693
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,054
Don't know yet.

1694
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:25,930
- Is that the doctor?
- Yeah. He's out cold.

1695
02:12:26,021 --> 02:12:27,432
Is that the doctor?

1696
02:12:27,523 --> 02:12:29,432
Well, we've got to get some doctors here.

1697
02:12:29,525 --> 02:12:30,639
- Stu?
- Yes.

1698
02:12:30,734 --> 02:12:32,478
Check the walkie-talkie in
my jeep. See if it's okay.

1699
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:33,649
Sure, Brad.

1700
02:12:33,737 --> 02:12:36,359
Come on, boys. Get this
stuff off me, can't you?

1701
02:12:36,448 --> 02:12:38,939
Hello, Angel. What's
the score in your car?

1702
02:12:39,034 --> 02:12:41,656
It's turned over. A lot of the girls...

1703
02:12:42,371 --> 02:12:44,162
Brad, you're bleeding.

1704
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:47,576
No dice, Brad. We gotta rig something.

1705
02:12:47,668 --> 02:12:49,459
I know the rig to get.

1706
02:12:50,087 --> 02:12:52,329
Tell them to get out the
work bulls. Well need them.

1707
02:12:52,423 --> 02:12:53,502
Come on.

1708
02:12:53,591 --> 02:12:56,378
Watch out, watch out.
Don't let him into the car.

1709
02:12:57,344 --> 02:12:58,755
He's coming back.

1710
02:12:58,846 --> 02:12:59,960
There he goes!

1711
02:13:00,055 --> 02:13:01,336
Samson!

1712
02:13:01,557 --> 02:13:02,755
Don't worry, Minnie.

1713
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:05,175
You'll be walking on
your hands in a week.

1714
02:13:07,771 --> 02:13:09,396
Well, my teeth are okay.

1715
02:13:09,481 --> 02:13:11,474
Bite off a Band-Aid.
Minnie's got a broken arm.

1716
02:13:11,567 --> 02:13:13,809
Hold still. Let her lean against you.

1717
02:13:13,903 --> 02:13:15,979
- Hurry up with that first aid kit.
- Here.

1718
02:13:19,325 --> 02:13:21,650
Give me the stick. Come
on, Minyak. Come on!

1719
02:13:21,744 --> 02:13:23,368
Come on, Minyak!

1720
02:13:23,454 --> 02:13:25,078
Minyak, this way.

1721
02:13:27,166 --> 02:13:29,657
Get the wagons down to the
highway. Everyone on the road.

1722
02:13:29,752 --> 02:13:32,836
You can't move the circus, Brad. This
wrecks scattered over five acres.

1723
02:13:32,922 --> 02:13:34,001
Half the animals are loose.

1724
02:13:34,089 --> 02:13:35,667
And were rolling into Cedar City.

1725
02:13:35,758 --> 02:13:38,130
Broken poles and canvas cut to ribbons?

1726
02:13:38,218 --> 02:13:39,843
Then well sidewall, play without a tent.

1727
02:13:39,929 --> 02:13:41,506
All right, take the strain on that pry.

1728
02:13:41,597 --> 02:13:43,673
Come on. Get with it.

1729
02:13:43,766 --> 02:13:44,845
Easy, now.

1730
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:47,092
I wish I could do this like
Buttons did it. He did a...

1731
02:13:47,186 --> 02:13:48,846
Say, where is Buttons?

1732
02:13:48,938 --> 02:13:51,061
Bring that first-aid kit over, please.

1733
02:13:51,148 --> 02:13:53,853
I send her for a doctor and
she comes back with an elephant.

1734
02:13:53,943 --> 02:13:55,686
You'd better leave the
little pixie to Phyllis

1735
02:13:55,778 --> 02:13:57,651
if you want to say
goodbye to our boyfriend.

1736
02:13:57,738 --> 02:14:00,194
- Come on.
- Goodbye to our...

1737
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:02,195
Brad.

1738
02:14:02,618 --> 02:14:04,611
Here. Finish Minnie's arm.

1739
02:14:06,622 --> 02:14:07,902
The rail wont move.

1740
02:14:07,998 --> 02:14:09,706
Hook it on a cage.

1741
02:14:09,792 --> 02:14:11,369
Take it away.

1742
02:14:12,044 --> 02:14:14,665
No, that's no good, man.
You'll pull our whole car over.

1743
02:14:14,755 --> 02:14:17,044
Brad. I didn't know.

1744
02:14:17,132 --> 02:14:18,710
I'm glad you're okay, pigeon.

1745
02:14:18,801 --> 02:14:21,506
We may miss the matinée,
but well make the night show.

1746
02:14:21,595 --> 02:14:23,173
Oh, Brad.

1747
02:14:23,264 --> 02:14:25,007
- Get that block out of the way.
- Here, I'll take it.

1748
02:14:25,099 --> 02:14:27,672
All right, Minyak, come on, pick it up.

1749
02:14:27,768 --> 02:14:30,306
Pick it up. Okay. Here we go.

1750
02:14:30,396 --> 02:14:32,139
Stand it on it's side.

1751
02:14:32,231 --> 02:14:34,389
Come on. Pick it up. Up.

1752
02:14:34,483 --> 02:14:35,728
All right, lets take him over here.

1753
02:14:35,818 --> 02:14:37,312
Well put it over there.

1754
02:14:37,403 --> 02:14:39,063
Brad, you're bleeding like a stuck fish.

1755
02:14:39,154 --> 02:14:40,234
- Birdie!
- Easy now.

1756
02:14:40,322 --> 02:14:42,398
Birdie, hurry with that first-aid kit!

1757
02:14:42,491 --> 02:14:44,116
Give me something to put on it.

1758
02:14:44,201 --> 02:14:45,909
Here. Here, Brad.

1759
02:14:47,204 --> 02:14:48,912
Birdie! Hurry!

1760
02:14:49,164 --> 02:14:52,249
Thank you, sugar. Thank you.

1761
02:14:53,586 --> 02:14:56,123
Birdie. Birdie, come on!
Don't move like a snail!

1762
02:14:56,213 --> 02:14:57,292
Birdie, get the gauze.

1763
02:14:57,381 --> 02:15:00,584
Well make a compression
bandage, pack it in.

1764
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:03,384
More of it. More of it.

1765
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:05,297
What are you doing here, Birdie?

1766
02:15:05,389 --> 02:15:07,761
- Here.
- Go see what's left of your costumes.

1767
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:09,724
We can't give a show without wardrobe.

1768
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:12,383
Well give a show, boss, if I have
to put them in horse blankets.

1769
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:14,104
Holly.

1770
02:15:14,773 --> 02:15:16,398
Here, hold.

1771
02:15:16,984 --> 02:15:19,557
Hank, any horses hurt?

1772
02:15:19,653 --> 02:15:21,562
The horses are okay,
Brad, but you're not.

1773
02:15:21,655 --> 02:15:22,900
I'm all right.

1774
02:15:23,324 --> 02:15:25,197
I've seen all kinds of
accidents on the lot, Holly.

1775
02:15:25,284 --> 02:15:26,399
That's an artery.

1776
02:15:26,493 --> 02:15:29,067
Every time his heart beats,
it pumps blood out of him.

1777
02:15:29,955 --> 02:15:31,236
What are we going to do? The doctors...

1778
02:15:31,332 --> 02:15:33,787
Hell bleed to death if we
don't get someone to him.

1779
02:15:36,337 --> 02:15:38,744
- I know someone.
- Good.

1780
02:15:56,273 --> 02:15:58,396
- Have you seen Buttons?
- No.

1781
02:16:04,156 --> 02:16:06,694
Birdie! Birdie, have you seen Buttons?

1782
02:16:06,784 --> 02:16:08,159
He just went by.

1783
02:16:08,244 --> 02:16:09,868
Get the Zoppes costumes next.

1784
02:16:09,954 --> 02:16:12,705
- Buttons!
- All right, throw them down!

1785
02:16:13,832 --> 02:16:18,411
Buttons! Buttons! Buttons.

1786
02:16:18,504 --> 02:16:21,209
Brads hurt. He's bleeding.
They can't stop it.

1787
02:16:21,298 --> 02:16:23,338
Well, get the doctor working
on him, Holly. I gotta go.

1788
02:16:23,425 --> 02:16:25,881
The doctors knocked out.
He was in the same car.

1789
02:16:25,970 --> 02:16:30,217
Buttons, that newspaper about the
doctor who killed the girl he loved...

1790
02:16:30,307 --> 02:16:31,967
Yeah, well, Brad told me
something about a detective

1791
02:16:32,059 --> 02:16:33,553
being on the train
looking for that fellow.

1792
02:16:33,644 --> 02:16:36,396
Look, I don't know if you're
the man they're looking for,

1793
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:38,722
- but if you are, you can save Brad.
- No.

1794
02:16:38,816 --> 02:16:41,733
Remember you told me once about
killing the thing you loved?

1795
02:16:41,819 --> 02:16:46,066
Well, maybe you killed someone
because you loved her so much.

1796
02:16:47,074 --> 02:16:50,657
If you are him, you
could save someone I love.

1797
02:16:50,744 --> 02:16:53,200
Oh, Buttons. I've always loved him.

1798
02:16:53,289 --> 02:16:57,500
Please, please don't let
him die, if you are the man.

1799
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:00,252
Are you, Buttons?

1800
02:17:02,214 --> 02:17:05,548
Yeah, I'm the man,
Holly. Come on. Lets go.

1801
02:17:13,851 --> 02:17:17,516
See if they can set up a cook tent.
Everyone could use some coffee.

1802
02:17:17,605 --> 02:17:18,980
Okay, Brad.

1803
02:17:19,064 --> 02:17:21,022
Find out what performers are hurt.

1804
02:17:21,108 --> 02:17:22,768
Let me know what acts we can't use.

1805
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:23,974
Lie still, Brad.

1806
02:17:24,069 --> 02:17:25,729
Here's the doctors bag. I found it.

1807
02:17:25,821 --> 02:17:27,778
Fine, fine. Get something
to put it on, will you?

1808
02:17:27,865 --> 02:17:30,901
We've got to get the big top rigged
somehow and put on a performance.

1809
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:32,653
Lie still, will you?

1810
02:17:33,287 --> 02:17:35,860
You'll finish this performance
under Gods big top.

1811
02:17:35,956 --> 02:17:37,415
Buttons.

1812
02:17:37,499 --> 02:17:40,868
If that detective sees you doing
this, he wont need fingerprints.

1813
02:17:40,961 --> 02:17:43,631
Well, the circus needs a boss right now.

1814
02:17:43,714 --> 02:17:45,956
Besides, I kind of like you.

1815
02:17:46,050 --> 02:17:50,546
Brad, please do what
Buttons says, for me.

1816
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:54,552
What are you trying to do,
make my last moments happy?

1817
02:17:56,477 --> 02:17:57,722
Is that you, Chuck?

1818
02:17:57,811 --> 02:18:00,563
Chuck, how many seed wagons are okay?

1819
02:18:00,648 --> 02:18:01,810
- About half.
- Set them up.

1820
02:18:01,899 --> 02:18:03,642
Use planks for what's missing.

1821
02:18:03,734 --> 02:18:07,566
You have got sawdust in your
veins. You can't even die decently.

1822
02:18:07,655 --> 02:18:11,071
Take it easy, Holly. This
isn't sawdust he's bleeding.

1823
02:18:11,158 --> 02:18:13,863
You're gonna have to have a
blood transfusion right quick.

1824
02:18:13,953 --> 02:18:15,862
You were in the army,
Brad. What's your blood type?

1825
02:18:15,955 --> 02:18:17,034
- AB.
- AB.

1826
02:18:17,122 --> 02:18:18,202
Which Rh?

1827
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:20,034
- Negative.
- Negative? Are you sure?

1828
02:18:20,125 --> 02:18:22,248
Yeah, I'm sure. Were
out of luck, Buttons.

1829
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:24,661
- What does that mean?
- Well, i's hard to find.

1830
02:18:24,755 --> 02:18:26,582
There must be a blood
bank in Cedar City.

1831
02:18:26,674 --> 02:18:27,836
We don't have any time for that.

1832
02:18:27,925 --> 02:18:29,384
Now, look, some of you go out and see

1833
02:18:29,468 --> 02:18:31,425
if you can find somebody
that has AB blood.

1834
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:33,919
- There must be somebody in this show.
- There is someone.

1835
02:18:34,014 --> 02:18:36,007
Me. I have it.

1836
02:18:38,227 --> 02:18:40,303
- Sebastian.
- Not him.

1837
02:18:40,396 --> 02:18:42,269
You're not gonna put
that guys blood in me.

1838
02:18:42,356 --> 02:18:44,396
You don't have enough blood
in you now to quibble about it.

1839
02:18:44,483 --> 02:18:47,188
Sit down here. Roll up your left
sleeve. Get his wristwatch off.

1840
02:18:47,278 --> 02:18:49,436
- All right.
- I think I can rig it with this.

1841
02:18:49,530 --> 02:18:51,688
Buttons, find somebody else.

1842
02:18:51,782 --> 02:18:54,320
You'll be dead in 20 minutes without him.

1843
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:55,820
Here, soak this in alcohol.

1844
02:18:55,911 --> 02:18:59,695
All right, but just take enough
till you can get some other guy.

1845
02:18:59,790 --> 02:19:03,788
It hurts me as much as it
does you, but noblesse oblige.

1846
02:19:03,877 --> 02:19:05,288
You ought to be grateful.

1847
02:19:05,379 --> 02:19:07,585
Grateful? To him?

1848
02:19:07,673 --> 02:19:10,425
I've had nothing but trouble
ever since you joined the show.

1849
02:19:10,509 --> 02:19:14,423
They warned me about you, but
I had to find out the hard way.

1850
02:19:14,513 --> 02:19:16,387
Big stuff in the air.

1851
02:19:16,473 --> 02:19:19,925
Upsetting the whole circus,
chopping down your net.

1852
02:19:20,019 --> 02:19:23,185
Now you want to be a hero, save my life.

1853
02:19:23,272 --> 02:19:25,063
I don't want any part of you.

1854
02:19:25,149 --> 02:19:27,391
I do not want to give you my good blood,

1855
02:19:27,484 --> 02:19:30,236
but what it will do for you...

1856
02:19:30,738 --> 02:19:32,362
Hasn't done much for you.

1857
02:19:32,448 --> 02:19:37,157
If he should make love well after
this, pay no attention. It will be me.

1858
02:19:37,745 --> 02:19:41,196
- I can't see. Give me the light over here.
- I'll take it.

1859
02:19:43,083 --> 02:19:44,661
Go ahead, Doctor.

1860
02:19:51,383 --> 02:19:53,542
Yes. Take all you want.

1861
02:19:53,636 --> 02:19:56,174
It will make of him a better man.

1862
02:19:56,263 --> 02:19:59,881
He will have more fire,
more of what women love.

1863
02:19:59,975 --> 02:20:02,597
They may even want to marry you.

1864
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:07,139
And each time you look at one
of your children, boss man,

1865
02:20:07,233 --> 02:20:08,940
you will see me.

1866
02:20:09,026 --> 02:20:10,520
If any kid of mine ever...

1867
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:11,809
- Brad.
- Yeah?

1868
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:14,276
It's the end of the line. Were licked.

1869
02:20:14,365 --> 02:20:16,938
We ain't got no big top,
and our lightings all shot.

1870
02:20:17,034 --> 02:20:20,735
- I'm not quitting. Well give a show.
- Brad, take it easy, will you?

1871
02:20:20,829 --> 02:20:23,783
- Where's my hat?
- Buttons.

1872
02:20:26,627 --> 02:20:28,536
- Give me that stethoscope.
- What is it, Buttons?

1873
02:20:28,629 --> 02:20:30,622
Put the ear tips in my ears.

1874
02:20:31,215 --> 02:20:33,706
Keep count of these
plunger strokes here.

1875
02:20:34,468 --> 02:20:36,626
Now put that over his heart.

1876
02:20:38,973 --> 02:20:41,464
A little lower. A little
lower. Right there.

1877
02:20:44,895 --> 02:20:46,437
His hearts going so
fast, I can hardly count.

1878
02:20:46,522 --> 02:20:48,431
- It must be over 130.
- 130...

1879
02:20:52,278 --> 02:20:54,685
Well, I guess that's it.

1880
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:57,271
- I'll get word out were cancelling.
- No, were not.

1881
02:20:57,366 --> 02:20:59,572
We couldn't even get into
town on a junk wagon.

1882
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:02,365
- Well bring the town out here.
- Five.

1883
02:21:02,454 --> 02:21:03,949
Sell tickets to see the wreck?

1884
02:21:04,039 --> 02:21:05,747
- That's not a bad idea.
- Are you nuts?

1885
02:21:05,833 --> 02:21:09,451
Maybe. Well get the crowd out here
if we have to drag them by the hair.

1886
02:21:09,587 --> 02:21:11,994
If you're putting on this act
for Brad, he can't hear you.

1887
02:21:12,089 --> 02:21:13,631
- What's the matter with...
- Now stop shaking the stand

1888
02:21:13,716 --> 02:21:15,792
or hell never hear anybody.

1889
02:21:16,135 --> 02:21:17,712
What's the matter with all of you?

1890
02:21:17,803 --> 02:21:19,796
Brad said wed give a show,
and were going to give it.

1891
02:21:19,889 --> 02:21:21,003
We got no big top.

1892
02:21:21,098 --> 02:21:22,758
Well sidewall it, set up in the open.

1893
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:24,973
- Where?
- Over there. It's an open field.

1894
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:26,804
I got you, birdbrain. You struck oil.

1895
02:21:26,896 --> 02:21:29,896
Jack, get everything together
that can walk, crawl, or run,

1896
02:21:29,982 --> 02:21:32,105
floats, midgets, clowns,
anything that can stand.

1897
02:21:32,192 --> 02:21:33,603
Tell them it's cherry pie.

1898
02:21:33,694 --> 02:21:35,568
Hank, fix up everything on wheels.

1899
02:21:35,654 --> 02:21:37,030
If the horses can't pull them, we can.

1900
02:21:37,114 --> 02:21:38,229
You're doing fine, Doc.

1901
02:21:38,324 --> 02:21:39,782
- Hurry up, do what I said.
- Come on, Bob.

1902
02:21:39,867 --> 02:21:41,326
Fred, tell Lloyd to stake out.

1903
02:21:41,410 --> 02:21:43,319
- What about the big top?
- Don't argue with me.

1904
02:21:43,412 --> 02:21:46,164
Emmett. Emmett, patch up
the clowns for a parade.

1905
02:21:46,248 --> 02:21:47,363
- Parade?
- Yes, parade.

1906
02:21:47,458 --> 02:21:48,916
- Hey, are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

1907
02:21:49,001 --> 02:21:50,661
Rig my trapeze in a wagon.

1908
02:21:50,753 --> 02:21:53,588
Gertrude. Gertrude, help
Birdie with the wardrobe. Hurry.

1909
02:21:53,672 --> 02:21:57,172
Dave. Dave, find Merle. Tell
him to get the band together.

1910
02:21:57,259 --> 02:21:59,833
If the instruments are
busted, tell him they can sing.

1911
02:21:59,929 --> 02:22:02,384
Here. Never mind the wreck.
Get the show rolling. Hurry.

1912
02:22:02,473 --> 02:22:06,305
- I can beat a drum, even with one hand.
- Not until I'm through with you.

1913
02:22:06,393 --> 02:22:07,852
You're doing all right
where you are, sugar.

1914
02:22:07,937 --> 02:22:09,016
What are you doing?

1915
02:22:09,104 --> 02:22:11,430
Will you two stop it?
You'll kill this man.

1916
02:22:11,523 --> 02:22:13,148
Twenty-five.

1917
02:22:13,234 --> 02:22:15,025
So long, Brad.

1918
02:22:15,653 --> 02:22:20,030
I'll bring all the elephants that can
walk, and the ones that can't, I'll carry.

1919
02:22:23,202 --> 02:22:26,653
You keep him going,
Buttons. Well roll the show.

1920
02:22:30,876 --> 02:22:32,668
God bless you.

1921
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:40,540
Thirty.

1922
02:22:45,057 --> 02:22:46,551
Buttons,

1923
02:22:47,351 --> 02:22:49,972
which one are you
trying to save him for?

1924
02:22:58,737 --> 02:23:00,896
Scars covered by grease paint,

1925
02:23:00,990 --> 02:23:04,109
bandages hidden by funny wigs,

1926
02:23:04,201 --> 02:23:07,736
the spangled pied piper limps into town.

1927
02:23:14,044 --> 02:23:16,879
Come on, folks, tie
yourself to a balloon!

1928
02:23:16,964 --> 02:23:19,003
Float out and see the circus!

1929
02:23:19,091 --> 02:23:20,965
Come on, come on! Follow us!

1930
02:23:21,051 --> 02:23:22,510
Come to the circus!

1931
02:23:22,678 --> 02:23:24,920
This is the first time
I've been alone with you

1932
02:23:25,014 --> 02:23:27,469
since that wonderful night
in Paris, and I love it.

1933
02:23:27,558 --> 02:23:30,594
Look, sugar, I love you
because you're Rh negative.

1934
02:23:30,686 --> 02:23:32,429
Not to you, chérie.

1935
02:23:33,022 --> 02:23:34,730
- Come on!
- Come on!

1936
02:23:50,289 --> 02:23:51,664
We've got them, Merle.

1937
02:23:51,749 --> 02:23:54,037
They're coming with us.
Hit the circus song.

1938
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:04,211
Come to the circus

1939
02:24:04,303 --> 02:24:06,296
The greatest show on earth

1940
02:24:06,388 --> 02:24:07,633
Come to the circus

1941
02:24:07,723 --> 02:24:09,348
See the circus

1942
02:24:09,558 --> 02:24:11,136
If were not very careful

1943
02:24:11,227 --> 02:24:13,303
Life can overwork us

1944
02:24:13,395 --> 02:24:14,973
So take today

1945
02:24:15,189 --> 02:24:17,098
And make it gay

1946
02:24:17,191 --> 02:24:21,058
For there are too many
tears along the way

1947
02:24:21,153 --> 02:24:23,359
So come to the circus

1948
02:24:23,447 --> 02:24:25,072
It's circus day today

1949
02:24:25,157 --> 02:24:26,984
Come see the barkers

1950
02:24:27,076 --> 02:24:28,618
And the gawkers

1951
02:24:28,702 --> 02:24:29,865
The bareback riders

1952
02:24:29,954 --> 02:24:32,705
And the fearless tightrope walkers

1953
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:36,206
The cuddly bears do their routine

1954
02:24:36,293 --> 02:24:38,452
The greatest extravaganza

1955
02:24:38,545 --> 02:24:40,538
The world has ever seen

1956
02:24:43,926 --> 02:24:47,295
The big calliope will play

1957
02:24:48,013 --> 02:24:51,513
And 50 pachyderms will play

1958
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:55,598
You'll see a hawker dressed in grey

1959
02:24:55,688 --> 02:24:59,353
Shouting, Peanuts, popcorn and lemonade

1960
02:24:59,441 --> 02:25:02,608
The human cannonball will zoom

1961
02:25:03,404 --> 02:25:07,104
As trumpets blare and bass drums boom

1962
02:25:07,199 --> 02:25:10,615
To entertain your mom and pop

1963
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:14,240
As we go under the great big top

1964
02:25:45,237 --> 02:25:46,981
Working on the rig.

1965
02:25:47,114 --> 02:25:49,237
Get them ready for the show.

1966
02:25:50,075 --> 02:25:51,618
Is that The Flying Comets rig?

1967
02:25:51,702 --> 02:25:52,817
Yeah.

1968
02:25:52,912 --> 02:25:54,536
We've only got four poles.

1969
02:25:54,622 --> 02:25:56,282
Rig it over ring three.

1970
02:25:57,166 --> 02:25:58,909
- Hey, Russ.
- Yes, boss?

1971
02:25:59,001 --> 02:26:01,077
Have Whitey climb up and
see if they're in sight yet.

1972
02:26:01,170 --> 02:26:03,412
- How do you feel?
- Never mind that. Just take off.

1973
02:26:03,505 --> 02:26:06,175
- And see if the menagerie...
- Brad, Brad, take it easy.

1974
02:26:07,009 --> 02:26:09,582
Doc, maybe you can keep
him quiet. I give up.

1975
02:26:09,762 --> 02:26:12,134
You did a great job,
Buttons. A great job.

1976
02:26:12,223 --> 02:26:13,800
Thank you, Doc. It's my last.

1977
02:26:14,642 --> 02:26:16,930
Looks like you ran
into a little trouble.

1978
02:26:17,353 --> 02:26:20,188
If I were in the junk business,
I might make you an offer.

1979
02:26:20,356 --> 02:26:22,929
Vultures even follow train wrecks.

1980
02:26:23,734 --> 02:26:24,979
Braden,

1981
02:26:26,070 --> 02:26:28,358
- you're all washed up.
- Well give a show.

1982
02:26:28,447 --> 02:26:30,523
Without an audience?

1983
02:26:37,873 --> 02:26:39,451
Hey, you hear that?

1984
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:41,992
Brad? You hear it?

1985
02:26:44,797 --> 02:26:45,876
The pied piper.

1986
02:26:46,715 --> 02:26:48,126
What's that?

1987
02:26:48,217 --> 02:26:49,711
That's a ratcatcher, Mr. Henderson.

1988
02:26:49,802 --> 02:26:50,881
What?

1989
02:26:50,970 --> 02:26:54,006
You know, great rats, small
rats, lean rats, scrawny rats,

1990
02:26:54,139 --> 02:26:57,639
brown rats, black rats,
grey rats, tawny rats.

1991
02:26:57,768 --> 02:26:59,642
They made it. Listen to that band.

1992
02:26:59,728 --> 02:27:01,851
Hey, Whitey, can you see them yet?

1993
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:03,855
I see them, Brad!

1994
02:27:35,139 --> 02:27:36,716
Wow! Look at them come!

1995
02:27:36,849 --> 02:27:38,676
They got the whole town with them!

1996
02:27:38,767 --> 02:27:40,048
Thank God.

1997
02:27:40,185 --> 02:27:42,178
Think I'll go have a look.

1998
02:27:48,319 --> 02:27:52,019
I'll say this much for you,
Braden. You're good circus.

1999
02:27:52,531 --> 02:27:54,358
I'll wait till you're
back on your feet again,

2000
02:27:54,450 --> 02:27:55,944
then I'll knock you off them for good.

2001
02:27:56,035 --> 02:27:59,071
Why don't you stay and
see the show, Henderson?

2002
02:27:59,371 --> 02:28:01,660
There'll be standing room.

2003
02:28:02,791 --> 02:28:04,334
I'm sorry, Doc.

2004
02:28:04,585 --> 02:28:06,542
I couldn't take a chance
with that crowd coming.

2005
02:28:06,629 --> 02:28:08,954
Yeah, yeah. I know.

2006
02:28:09,214 --> 02:28:12,714
Id kind of like to
shake your hand before...

2007
02:28:15,221 --> 02:28:16,845
You're all right.

2008
02:28:22,895 --> 02:28:24,140
Buttons...

2009
02:28:29,652 --> 02:28:31,110
What can a man say?

2010
02:28:31,195 --> 02:28:33,104
Well, take care of yourself, Brad.

2011
02:28:33,197 --> 02:28:36,613
Tell Holly I'm going to keep that
date with that girl she knows about.

2012
02:28:38,035 --> 02:28:39,944
Where's my hat?

2013
02:28:42,248 --> 02:28:44,240
Here's a present for you.

2014
02:28:48,712 --> 02:28:50,171
Come on, Squeaker.

2015
02:28:50,256 --> 02:28:52,295
Do you want a bite of
my candy bar, Buttons?

2016
02:28:52,383 --> 02:28:54,755
No, thanks, honey. I'm not very hungry.

2017
02:28:54,885 --> 02:28:57,127
Squeaker likes candy, don't you?

2018
02:28:58,430 --> 02:29:01,266
- I'll tell you, why don't you take him?
- Don't you want him?

2019
02:29:01,350 --> 02:29:04,102
Yeah, I want him, but I
can't take him where I'm going.

2020
02:29:04,478 --> 02:29:06,969
Here. Don't feed him too
much popcorn or hell pop.

2021
02:29:08,107 --> 02:29:09,601
Thanks.

2022
02:29:09,692 --> 02:29:11,768
- Well, keep the show rolling, Brad.
- Hey, Buttons, what's this...

2023
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:14,434
And why don't you tell
Holly Brad wants to see her?

2024
02:29:14,697 --> 02:29:16,239
Come on. Lets go.

2025
02:29:16,323 --> 02:29:18,150
- You kids want popcorn?
- Yeah!

2026
02:29:18,576 --> 02:29:20,901
Merle, spot the band
between those seat wagons.

2027
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:23,408
We got the webs rigged
to the star boom, Holly.

2028
02:29:23,497 --> 02:29:25,454
Keep them out of the
way of the Alzana wire.

2029
02:29:25,541 --> 02:29:27,783
Antoinette, take your web
girls up to the big pole.

2030
02:29:27,876 --> 02:29:30,794
Lou, you work the centre ring
with Loni and The Chaludis.

2031
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:33,121
Honey, use my trapeze. Yours is busted.

2032
02:29:33,215 --> 02:29:34,793
Give them a hula bubble bath, Phyllis.

2033
02:29:34,883 --> 02:29:37,291
Yes. In the elephant tub.

2034
02:29:41,098 --> 02:29:42,676
Hey, Rusty. Follow captain high.

2035
02:29:42,766 --> 02:29:44,011
Right, Sebastian.

2036
02:29:44,101 --> 02:29:45,560
Well, what happened to you, sugar?

2037
02:29:45,644 --> 02:29:48,349
You must have gotten
some of Brads blood.

2038
02:29:48,981 --> 02:29:51,389
You walking people, get
back by the bubble float.

2039
02:29:51,483 --> 02:29:53,275
Holly, Brad wants you!

2040
02:29:53,402 --> 02:29:56,189
Okay. Coffee, everybody, after
the spec at the grease joint.

2041
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:58,853
Ladies and gentlemen,

2042
02:29:59,074 --> 02:30:02,278
we bring you a new innovation.

2043
02:30:02,661 --> 02:30:05,911
The greatest assembly
of artists in the world

2044
02:30:06,248 --> 02:30:11,159
will entertain you under the
blue canopy of the open sky.

2045
02:30:11,337 --> 02:30:14,124
Golly, Brad, you sure look
better than when I saw you last.

2046
02:30:14,214 --> 02:30:17,132
- Yeah, sure, but...
- No, no! Put The Idnavies in the centre!

2047
02:30:17,343 --> 02:30:20,759
Brad, what I said last night.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

2048
02:30:20,846 --> 02:30:22,673
- Well, I'm not. Listen...
- Brad, aren't you proud of me?

2049
02:30:22,765 --> 02:30:24,342
You should have seen
us. We panicked them.

2050
02:30:24,433 --> 02:30:25,512
Were not gonna have enough
seats out there to hold them.

2051
02:30:25,601 --> 02:30:26,716
I nearly folded last night.

2052
02:30:26,810 --> 02:30:28,139
It made me see what I've been missing.

2053
02:30:28,229 --> 02:30:31,064
You know what I'm gonna do? Were
gonna parade around the track...

2054
02:30:31,148 --> 02:30:33,520
Would you listen to what I'm
trying to tell you? I love you.

2055
02:30:33,609 --> 02:30:35,187
- I know, but were ready to start.
- Holly...

2056
02:30:35,319 --> 02:30:36,398
After the show, huh, Brad?

2057
02:30:36,487 --> 02:30:37,946
Judas priest!

2058
02:30:38,447 --> 02:30:40,772
You got nothing but
sawdust in your veins!

2059
02:30:40,866 --> 02:30:42,574
Children of all ages,

2060
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:44,948
the big show is about to commence.

2061
02:30:45,037 --> 02:30:47,362
Well, looks like were out in the cold.

2062
02:30:49,375 --> 02:30:52,245
Perhaps we should keep
each other warm, huh?

2063
02:30:52,378 --> 02:30:55,332
Listen, sugar, the only
way you can keep me warm

2064
02:30:55,422 --> 02:30:57,913
is to wrap me up in a marriage licence.

2065
02:30:58,050 --> 02:31:01,004
Why not? That would be something new.

2066
02:31:07,768 --> 02:31:11,054
Roll it, Merle! Plenty
of brass and make it loud!

2067
02:31:18,612 --> 02:31:20,404
Come to the circus

2068
02:31:20,489 --> 02:31:22,565
Come on along and see

2069
02:31:22,658 --> 02:31:24,236
Hooray for lions

2070
02:31:24,326 --> 02:31:25,785
And the camels

2071
02:31:25,869 --> 02:31:29,321
You'll have fun And look
at all the other mammals

2072
02:31:29,582 --> 02:31:31,373
Come see the clowns

2073
02:31:31,458 --> 02:31:33,451
Who play their part

2074
02:31:33,544 --> 02:31:37,376
They'll wear a smile
that hides a broken heart

2075
02:31:37,464 --> 02:31:38,579
Tremendous

2076
02:31:38,674 --> 02:31:39,789
Stupendous

2077
02:31:39,883 --> 02:31:40,963
The circus show shall be

2078
02:31:41,051 --> 02:31:42,961
The Bengal tiger

2079
02:31:43,053 --> 02:31:44,713
And the lion

2080
02:31:44,805 --> 02:31:46,845
The trapeze artist does a leap

2081
02:31:46,932 --> 02:31:48,391
That's death-defyin'

2082
02:31:48,475 --> 02:31:50,468
A land of mirth

2083
02:31:50,644 --> 02:31:52,436
Your moneys worth

2084
02:31:52,521 --> 02:31:55,688
Come on along to the circus

2085
02:31:56,817 --> 02:32:02,855
The greatest show on earth

2086
02:32:07,786 --> 02:32:10,574
That's all, ladies and
gentlemen. That's all.

2087
02:32:11,081 --> 02:32:13,454
Come again to the
greatest show on earth.

2088
02:32:13,542 --> 02:32:16,377
Bring the children. Bring the old folks.

2089
02:32:16,462 --> 02:32:18,953
You can shake the sawdust off your feet,

2090
02:32:19,048 --> 02:32:20,756
but you can't shake it out of your heart.

2091
02:32:20,841 --> 02:32:22,466
Come again, folks.

2092
02:32:22,635 --> 02:32:24,045
The greatest show on earth!

2093
02:32:24,136 --> 02:32:25,963
Come again.

2094
02:32:26,305 --> 02:33:26,871
