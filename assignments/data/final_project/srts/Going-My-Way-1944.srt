1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,189
But Father Fitzgibbon, why
do you want a new furnace?

3
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,531
Because, Mr. Haines, last winter,

4
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,151
in the month of November alone, four of me

5
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,245
perishiners took to
the bed with pneumonia.

6
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,488
Well that's too bad.

7
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,991
It's only by a miracle
that I meself pulled through.

8
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,289
And it'll only cost $632.50,

9
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,789
complete with an automatic damper.

10
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,210
But Father Fitzgibbon, I didn't

11
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,129
come here to put in a new furnace.

12
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,048
I think you oughta give
him his furnace, dad.

13
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,466
It would warm people's hearts and

14
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,681
maybe his collections would be bigger.

15
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,924
No son.

16
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,800
Improvements are out.

17
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,645
Now Father...

18
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,558
That was good, what
he said, that was good.

19
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,806
Oh, well he's new to our business.

20
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,650
Now Father...

21
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,892
No furnace huh?

22
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,983
No furnace.

23
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,852
Now Father, here's my business.

24
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,446
You owe the Knickerbocker
Savings and Loan Company

25
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,532
five payments on this
mortgage, and if they're

26
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,491
not taken care of, I'm afraid the

27
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,407
Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company

28
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,700
will have to take the necessary action.

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,868
Huh?

30
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,036
Why don't you make that the subject

31
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,409
of your sermon next Sunday?

32
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,626
Tell it to your people.

33
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,871
The Lord loveth the cheerful giver?

34
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,545
Oh I can imagine meself
saying that in Mass next Sunday.

35
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,259
What a sermon that would be, Mr. Haines.

36
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,720
The text of me sermon this morning

37
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,931
is taken from the mortgage.

38
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,684
According to Mr. Haines.

39
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,934
From the first to the 23rd clause.

40
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,900
If they'd only know.

41
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,439
Oh but that's your business.

42
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,062
Keep it bright, huh?

43
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,281
No, but seriously Father, we've made

44
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,776
a bad loan and we want our money back.

45
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,619
Well you'll get it somehow.

46
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,410
Ah, well that's all I wanted to know.

47
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,703
Well good day, Father.

48
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,710
Come on son.

49
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,265
Dad.

50
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,436
You can't foreclose, why
it just hasn't been done.

51
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,021
I read up on it, and there's never been

52
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,686
a Catholic Church foreclosure
in the history of New York.

53
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:58,186
Well there's always a
first time isn't there?

54
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,609
Don't you think you're
being a little harsh with him?

55
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,947
You've got to be.

56
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,943
Son, never loan money to a church.

57
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,286
As soon as you start to close in on them,

58
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,827
everybody thinks you're a heel.

59
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,244
Well aren't you?

60
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,254
Yes.

61
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,920
Good morning!

62
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,168
Excuse me, but could you tell me

63
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,920
where I'd find St. Dominic's Church?

64
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,387
Eh?

65
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,724
I'm looking
for St. Dominic's Church.

66
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,059
Why?

67
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,099
I'm gonna work there.

68
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,972
The new assistant eh?

69
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,728
And you can't even find the church.

70
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,239
Well all I can say is, young man,

71
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,359
you're off to a mighty bad start.

72
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,780
What's your name?

73
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,154
Father O'Malley.

74
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,827
Charles Francis Patrick O'Malley.

75
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,750
What's yours?

76
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,162
Her name is Quimp!

77
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,583
Hattie Quimp!

78
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,376
You'll see a lot of her, you will.

79
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,420
At St. Dominic's she's
a regular two-dayer.

80
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,009
Very religious.

81
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,594
Burns candles.

82
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,261
I could tell you plenty about them too.

83
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,557
And if I did, they'd have
to leave the neighborhood!

84
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,729
If you're looking for
St. Dominic's, Father,

85
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,567
it's a block up and then to your left.

86
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,570
Thank you.

87
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,793
Hello.

88
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,627
Hello.

89
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,709
How's things going?

90
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,828
Aw terrible.

91
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,252
They never hit one to me.

92
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,296
Watch right field for me
a minute, will you Father?

93
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,135
Sure.

94
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,136
I gotta run in the house.

95
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,719
Okay.

96
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,341
Hey fellas, the Father's
gonna take my place!

97
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,467
Okay Father!

98
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:56,895
I got it!

99
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,898
Got it!

100
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,322
Thanks.

101
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,785
What do you think you're doing?

102
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,033
I'm a substitute right fielder.

103
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,784
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

104
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,036
Playing around with a lot of kids,

105
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,708
smashing people's windows.

106
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,956
A big grown up man.

107
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,502
And a priest besides.

108
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,509
Oh hello.

109
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,007
Still looking for St. Dominic's?

110
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,301
You just wait 'til I
tell Father Fitzgibbon.

111
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,765
Look, you keep out of this will you?

112
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,883
Go on, go on.

113
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,011
This is between him and me.

114
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,138
Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.

115
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,481
Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.

116
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,769
Well I intend to pay for it.

117
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,610
When?

118
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,068
Priests never have any money.

119
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,904
That window...

120
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,692
Now wait a minute, my good man.

121
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,692
I said I'd pay for it
and I told you I'm sorry.

122
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,285
What else can I say after I say I'm sorry?

123
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,495
Well that ain't the idea,

124
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,829
it's the principle of the thing.

125
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,119
A priest didn't oughta go around
breaking people's windows.

126
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,288
It sets a bad example for the children.

127
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,627
You got me stymied there,

128
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,337
I'm contrite and I'm penitent.

129
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,376
I told you I'm sorry.

130
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,169
Yeah, you told me that
twice, but that don't...

131
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,590
That doesn't fix the broken
window, I know, I know.

132
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,838
I think you're just plain
hard to get along with.

133
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,465
Maybe a little security might help.

134
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,683
Huh?

135
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,722
These were given to me.

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,017
Why don't you keep them
until I've made good?

137
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,266
Maybe they'll make you feel better.

138
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,984
They're mother of pearl, you see?

139
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,697
If that'll satisfy you, I'll run along.

140
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,699
Hey you.

141
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,692
Here.

142
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,318
I got no use for this.

143
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,820
First place, I don't believe in it.

144
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,696
As a matter of fact, I
don't believe in anything.

145
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,868
I can believe that.

146
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,833
I'm an atheist.

147
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,496
Besides, I'm superstitious.

148
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,994
All right then, I'm sorry about

149
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,791
the window, I'll have it fixed.

150
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,835
Can I have the ball back?

151
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,800
You even throw like an atheist.

152
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,877
Mrs. Carmody, did the
young priest come yet?

153
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,999
He's here.

154
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,969
But he insisted on changing
his clothes before seeing you.

155
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,052
Ah, that's nice.

156
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,092
Tidying himself up a bit.

157
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,475
Hello Father.

158
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,891
I'm your new curate, Father.

159
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,439
If you'll excuse my appearance.

160
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,356
I know it's not possible.

161
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,232
The bishop may have a grudge against me.

162
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,825
He may think I've a mouth full of clover

163
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,491
and can't preach, but even the bishop

164
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,581
wouldn't do a thing like this to me.

165
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:06,703
I see what you mean.

166
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,416
Young man, may I ask is that

167
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,091
the official garb of the
priests in St. Louis?

168
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:20,137
No, something happened
to me on the way over.

169
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,386
I guess this just isn't my day, Father.

170
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,762
Do you mind if I...

171
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,773
Nah.

172
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,488
Eh.

173
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,994
Young man, as a matter of curiosity,

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,458
what made you become a priest?

175
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,796
Why I...

176
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,511
Hello?

177
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,216
Well you don't say.

178
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,259
You don't say.

179
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,723
Oh yes, I can well believe it.

180
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,769
Mrs. Quimp?

181
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,443
Oh yes, yes indeed, Miss Quimp.

182
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,989
Yes indeed, I appreciate
your good intentions.

183
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,830
Yes yes yes.

184
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,539
Goodbye, yes, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

185
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,534
I guess she told you about me huh?

186
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,457
Yeah, the girl is all bitty.

187
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,921
Young man, I'm afraid you're
off to a very bad start.

188
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,381
That's what she said.

189
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,341
I'm sorry, Father.

190
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,553
Smashing people's windows, such conduct.

191
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:44,096
Oh yes, that reminds me, I
wanted to ask you something.

192
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,438
Tell me young man, how did
you happen to become a priest?

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Well I...

194
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,113
Yeah?

195
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,943
Chuck?

196
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,950
Chuck who?

197
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,610
Father Chuck?

198
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
That's me.

199
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,156
Here, I'll take it over here.

200
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,586
Hello?

201
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,915
Timmy!

202
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,084
Well how are you Timmy?

203
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,048
Oh I just got in.

204
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,008
Well what do you know.

205
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,628
That's Father O'Dowd,
an old friend of mine.

206
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,755
We used to go to school together.

212
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,615
Can you talk?

213
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,950
Well no.

214
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,040
All right, then I'll do the talking.

215
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,502
How does your new pastor impress you?

216
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,416
You're a big help.

217
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,961
Well it's a little early to say.

218
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,174
Time will tell.

219
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,756
Uh-uh.

220
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,879
No, I think it'd be better

221
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,256
if I told you when I saw you.

222
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,767
Yes, it'd be much better.

223
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,853
All right Timmy, make it soon huh?

224
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,855
So long.

225
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,439
Oh he's a great little man.

226
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,478
Yeah, yeah.

227
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,478
Well what were we talking about?

228
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,855
I was going to ask you something...

229
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,198
You were gonna ask me if
I wanted to see the church.

230
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,817
Yes, that's right.

231
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,052
I like this.

232
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,098
It's beautiful.

233
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,021
Thank you.

234
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,934
How long you been here Father?

235
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:55,941
45 years.

236
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,567
46 in October.

237
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,650
The church?

238
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,111
The same.

239
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,696
I built it.

240
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,818
Can only hope someday I
can say I built as much.

241
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,744
This is nice.

242
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,864
Yeah, the birds like it.

243
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,079
They're good company.

244
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,668
Listen.

245
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,547
Yes, I've taken a great deal
of pleasure in me garden.

246
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,388
It's been hard work,
but it's been worth it.

247
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,256
I think you'll find this a very

248
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:33,056
pleasant place in which to meditate.

249
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,679
You do meditate don't you?

250
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,976
Oh yeah, sure.

251
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,892
Now I'll show you the church.

252
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,521
What we really need is
a loudspeaker system.

253
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,371
For a minute I thought I
found a four leaf clover.

254
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,785
Guess it just isn't my day.

255
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,078
Would you like to see the...

256
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,085
Oh yes!

257
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,319
Oh Mrs. Carmody!

258
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,442
Just a minute.

259
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,240
Just a minute.

260
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,159
Where's Father O'Malley?

261
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,157
He left early this morning.

262
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,329
The young man doesn't sleep
as late as you do, you know.

263
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,336
Huh?

264
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,373
Oh, oh.

265
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,296
What's this?

266
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,214
His luggage.

267
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,422
Just arrived.

268
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,007
Golf, tennis.

269
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,592
Now where may I ask is his fish pole?

270
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,595
It's here.

271
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,141
Good morning, Father!

272
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,518
Been to market huh?

273
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,315
Mrs. Carmody could attend to that.

274
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,108
You should've been making parish calls.

275
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:49,948
I have.

276
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,110
Mrs. McGonagall, you know, the one

277
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,109
with the big house and rheumatism?

278
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,326
She sent you a present.

279
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,489
Oh she did huh?

280
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,362
How very generous of her, I must say.

281
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,208
A fine Christian woman in Mrs. McGonagall.

282
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,667
I wonder what it is.

283
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,831
Something to eat, I dare say.

284
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:04,671
Jam!

285
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,755
No, pickled pigs feet.

286
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,588
Possibly some brandy peaches.

287
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,086
Oh if there's one thing I'm partial to,

288
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,089
it's a nice big jar of brandy peaches.

289
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,011
A nice basket too.

290
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,135
Yeah, she wants it back.

291
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,941
They're too young, O'Malley.

292
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,855
Much too young to be
separated from the mother.

293
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,603
That's what she said.

294
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,980
So here's the mother.

295
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,401
Ain't she cute?

296
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,283
Hello baby.

297
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,276
The joy of giving is indeed a pleasure.

298
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,448
Especially when you get rid
of something you don't want.

299
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,493
Oh Mrs. McGonagall is
famous for these tricks.

300
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,619
When her husband died
she sent me his umbrella,

301
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,669
his long flannel underwear,
and his mustache coat.

307
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,066
Hiya Chuck, I'm glad to see you.

308
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,980
Glad to see you.

309
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,318
How long is it
since we've seen each other?

310
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,321
Four years.

311
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,403
Oh five anyway.

312
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,365
Has it been that long?

313
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,199
Yes.

314
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,033
Pardon me.

315
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,242
Father Fitzgibbon, this is
my old friend Father O'Dowd.

316
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,611
How are you, Father Fitzgibbon?

317
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,364
We've been friends since we
were knee high to a nibbly.

318
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,910
He was our local Huckleberry Finn.

319
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,077
Laugh and the world laughs
with you, he used to say.

320
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,794
Cry and you cry all by yourself.

321
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,038
How are you, Father Fitzgibbon?

322
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,459
I just dropped by to
see if Father O'Malley

323
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,630
could play a little golf this afternoon.

324
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,672
Oh you did?

325
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,132
Where's your parish?

326
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,597
Right over here, St. Francis.

327
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,468
Well now, about your golf.

328
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,060
'Course I can't answer for you, but at

329
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,770
St. Dominic's we've very little time

330
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,937
for games of golf and sunshine.

331
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,980
And if you're working
for me, all I can say

332
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,525
is that you wouldn't have time for either.

333
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,272
It's lucky for me then
that I'm at St. Francis.

334
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,784
It's my hope St.
Francis can say the same.

335
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,497
Uh-oh, he's got you there Timmy.

336
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,536
Good Father, very good.

337
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,455
Say Father, why don't you
come around with us sometime?

338
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,420
It's a grand game.

339
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,582
Sure Father, we'll teach you.

340
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,296
A man is never too old to learn.

341
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,882
A lot of nice fresh
air out on the golf course.

342
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,341
And profanity too.

343
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,505
No.

344
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,630
A golf course is nothing but
a pool room moved outdoors.

345
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,553
You mind if I use that
one sometime Father?

346
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,850
Young man, would you mind?

347
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,066
How did he ever become a priest?

348
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:35,483
Well I don't...

349
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,822
Father Fitzgibbon.

350
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,825
Excuse me.

351
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,079
Who is it?

352
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,616
Mrs. Quimp.

353
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,624
Oh gosh.

354
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,577
Does he know?

355
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,668
Does he know what?

356
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,754
That you're in charge.

357
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,673
How'd you know?

358
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,710
I didn't.

359
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,003
Ha.

360
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,717
I gathered as much when
I heard you were here.

361
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,054
Everybody knows that St.
Dominic's is in a bad way.

362
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,470
Father Fitzgibbon is
getting to be an old man.

363
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,808
This needs a young Father...

364
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,267
Timmy, look.

365
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,477
Don't mention it to anybody.

366
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Oh no, no.

367
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,222
You see, when I had
my talk with the bishop

368
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,144
it was our understanding
that Father Fitzgibbon

369
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,767
was to remain here as pastor and I was

370
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,236
to try and straighten out St. Dominic's

371
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,400
without hurting his feelings.

372
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,282
I see.

373
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,149
You're in charge but you're not.

374
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,618
I don't think I'd like
an assignment like that.

375
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,782
But the bishop couldn't very well

376
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,200
put him out to pasture could he?

377
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,209
Pasture?

378
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,995
What's this I hear about a pasture?

379
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,666
I was just saying to him, Father.

380
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,919
The next time I come "past your" church

381
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,966
I'm going to drop in and see you.

382
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,338
Good day, Father.

383
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,556
So long, Chuck.

384
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,395
I was going to ask you something.

385
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,890
Oh yes, the telephone.

386
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,516
Mrs. Quimp just telephoned, her landlord

387
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,984
has thrown her out again, she'll want

388
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,898
somebody to go down and
see her, you better go...

389
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,941
I'll go right along, Father.

390
00:19:58,948 --> 00:19:59,984
Will you mind the puppies?

391
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,990
Yeah.

392
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,623
Thank you.

393
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,876
I'll bet you're the new
assistant, the one who's

394
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,541
going to get St. Dominic's
out of all its trouble?

395
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,540
And I'll bet you're all the trouble.

396
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,212
I'll wager you're the
man with the mortgage.

397
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,880
Oh you've heard about the mortgage?

398
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,798
All churches have mortgages.

399
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,967
It isn't respectable for
a church not to have one.

400
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,090
My name's O'Malley.

401
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,136
Mine's Haines.

402
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:27,976
Nice meeting you.

403
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,058
We may have to touch you for

404
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,302
a little more a little later on.

405
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,146
Eh?

406
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,184
Yeah, we're gonna need a new
paint job here pretty soon.

407
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,647
But I must run along.

408
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,017
You look like a man it'll be a
pleasure to do business with.

409
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,027
Yes.

410
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,044
Get out!

411
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,207
Get out, you're not throwing me out!

412
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,423
And I'll pay you me rent when I get it!

413
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,963
Good morning, Father.

414
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,006
Morning.

415
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,174
Hello, Father.

416
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,093
Mrs. Quimp and I were just discussing you.

417
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,215
Oh you were?

418
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,679
As you know, I represent the

419
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,803
Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company.

420
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,520
And in as much as Mrs. Quimp declines

421
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,105
to pay her rent, the Knickerbocker

422
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,770
Savings and Loan Company refuses

423
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,019
to offer her any further hospitality.

424
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,986
Is she very far in her rears?

425
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,981
Mrs. Quimp has paid
us nothing for six months.

426
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,107
Well it's certainly very nice

427
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,029
of you to show her so much leniency.

428
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,154
Supposing the poor old
woman has no place to go.

429
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,372
Well the Knickerbocker
Savings and Loan Company

430
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,286
is not a charitable institution,

431
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,751
Father, like St. Dominic's.

432
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,417
With us it's just a matter
of cold-blooded business.

433
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,039
Well with you it's different.

434
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,212
You haven't got anything
and you don't want anything.

435
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,132
That's your business, and
people respect you for it.

436
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,424
But I'm not in your business, see?

437
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,172
If I haven't got anything and

438
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,721
don't want anything, I'm a bum.

439
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,012
Surely there must be
something we can do about it.

440
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,604
Well I don't know what
you're gonna do about it,

441
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,974
but I'm going to throw
her right out on her ear.

442
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,441
Now why don't you give her a break?

443
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,185
Give her a month to make good in.

444
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,937
St. Dominic's will guarantee it.

445
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:04,781
St. Dominic's?

446
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,023
Yeah.

447
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,865
I can see you haven't
been around long, Father.

448
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,611
Why St. Dominic's is in
worse shape than Mrs. Quimp.

449
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,783
My old man happens to own
the mortgage and he says...

450
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,782
Oh your father holds the mortgage eh?

451
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,203
You're darn right he does.

452
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,451
And confidentially, I think he'd

453
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,077
like to find a way to foreclose.

454
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,295
He wants to tear down the church

455
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,788
and making a parking lot out of it.

456
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,415
Can you imagine?

457
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,257
Oh he's a very disliked man.

458
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,173
I'm sorta following in his footsteps.

459
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,012
Junior eh?

460
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,424
Yeah.

461
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,357
Let's cut through the churchyard.

462
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,583
Good afternoon boys.

463
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,835
Oh hello, Father.

464
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,929
That's a fine fat bird you have there.

465
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,968
Oh, well we were sorta
bringing it over for you.

466
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,308
It's sorta a present ain't it Herman?

467
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,518
Yeah!

468
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,807
Well now that's very generous of you.

469
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,771
Such a fine bird and all.

470
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,393
Now where, may I ask, did you get it?

471
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,236
We got...

472
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,853
We won it in a raffle
over at the theater.

473
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:27,864
We were lucky.

474
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,027
Why isn't that great huh?

475
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,113
But surely your mother...

476
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,702
Well except on Christmas,
ma don't like turkey.

477
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:35,538
She don't huh?

478
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,331
Honest.

479
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,823
Well now that's most fortunate for me,

480
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,790
for there's nothing I'm
more partial to than

481
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:44,163
a nice Tom turkey,
roasted all with dressing.

482
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,961
Well I appreciate your kindness, boys.

483
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,549
Aw it ain't nothing, Father.

484
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,545
Oh on the contrary, I
appreciate the thought behind it.

485
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,467
Small luxuries, like small sacrifices,

486
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,056
are oftentimes the most godly.

487
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,800
Well bless you both.

488
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,727
Thank you.

489
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,442
Take it in, inside the
kitchen's the housekeeper.

490
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,312
Okay Father, we'll see you later.

491
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,995
So you guaranteed
Mrs. Quimp's rent did you?

492
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,288
Of course I did.

493
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,378
St. Dominic's can't afford it.

494
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:30,376
I expected you to counsel
Mrs. Quimp, not to adopt her.

495
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,752
Ah, hot turkey.

496
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,013
Hot?

497
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,131
Of course it's hot.

498
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,848
That's what I said.

499
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,398
Bless us, oh Lord, for these

500
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,866
thy gifts we are about receive

501
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,780
in the name of amen.

502
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,787
Amen.

503
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,205
Say Father, you know a youngster

504
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,923
around here named Tony Scaponi?

505
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,542
Mmmhm, what about him?

506
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,589
Well this afternoon...

507
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:18,431
Tony belongs to a fine,
upstanding Catholic family.

508
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,925
11 children.

509
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,597
Oh sure I know Tony.

510
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,469
As fine a lad as there is in the parish.

511
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,937
Police don't think so.

512
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,815
Oh they don't huh?

513
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:26,932
No.

514
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,308
If something isn't done about Tony

515
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,559
and his pals, I'm afraid they're

516
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,186
gonna wind up in a reform school.

517
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,196
Who told you that?

518
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,313
The police.

519
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,361
Oh you've been listening
to Patrick McCarthy no doubt.

520
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,576
Let me tell you that that...

521
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,866
That man hasn't been to
Mass in the last 10 years.

522
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,830
That may be, but I think

523
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,995
McCarthy's right about those kids.

524
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,666
They're terrorizing the
whole neighborhood, Father.

525
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,208
Always talking like that.

526
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,422
To hear the police talk, you'd think that

527
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,634
every lad in the parish was a criminal.

528
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,636
I'll have you know that
the very food there

529
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,255
before us is brought to us by two

530
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,928
of those very lads that the police

531
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,017
are so maliciously slandering.

532
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,056
Is that so?

533
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,060
Tony Scaponi was one of them.

534
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,100
I gave them both my blessing.

535
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,569
And they gave you the bird.

536
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,572
Yeah.

537
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,074
I'll get it.

538
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,509
Hello, McCarthy.

539
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,129
Oh good evening, Father.

540
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,222
Well I brought 'em.

541
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,638
Tony Scaponi, Herman Langerhanke.

542
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,644
Hi fellas.

543
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,312
I don't think you have to wait, McCarthy.

544
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,931
Well okay, Father.

545
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,571
Say, I understand that you fellas

546
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,235
like baseball pretty well huh?

547
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,358
Yeah.

548
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,076
I was thinking Saturday
the Yanks are playing

549
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,038
the St. Louis Browns, a double header.

550
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,829
Would you like to go out
and see the games with me?

551
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,327
St. Louis my old hometown, you know.

552
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,579
I get all the passes I want.

553
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,549
What do you say?

554
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,542
Well I guess so.

555
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,760
Yeah, yeah sure, I guess
the fellas would like that.

556
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,798
That's a date then.

557
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,047
I'll meet you here Saturday at noon?

558
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,264
Yeah, that'd be good.

559
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,678
You run along and have your dinner.

560
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,722
I'll go finish my turkey.

561
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,117
Let me see, now where was I?

562
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,870
Oh yeah, I know.

563
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,489
I was going to ask you something.

564
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,206
Oh yeah, what made me become a priest?

565
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,325
No no no no.

566
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,960
About young Tony.

567
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,920
What was it the police accused him of?

568
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,923
Stealing.

569
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,628
Stealing?

570
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,501
Stealing what?

571
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,512
Turkeys.

572
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,140
Seems the boys hijacked a
poultry truck down the street

573
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,643
here and there was quite
a bit of excitement.

574
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,522
The driver reported them to the police.

575
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,196
And did that poor man
get his turkeys back?

576
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,116
All but one, Father.

577
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,142
Thank you.

578
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,115
Hello McCarthy, how are you?

579
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,487
Good morning, Father.

580
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,614
You open for business?

581
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,661
Always open for business, McCarthy.

582
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,668
Come on in.

583
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,425
You just wait here.

584
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,840
Come right in, Pat.

585
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,132
I got a problem, Father.

586
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,014
Yeah?

587
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,756
Seems like it's more yours than mine.

588
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,133
Mmmhm.

589
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,143
It's her.

590
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,392
Well Father, it's this way.

591
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,561
Last night I'm walking my beat, see?

592
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,853
And who do you think I run into?

593
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
Her?

594
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,695
Mrs. Quimp.

595
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,232
Ah.

596
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,650
"Officer McCaddy" she says.

597
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,148
You know how the old stool pigeon talks.

598
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,075
Yes I do.

599
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,784
"If you'll go around the
corner you'll find a girl.

600
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,621
"I've been watching her and
she ain't up to no good."

601
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,239
Well Father, I go around the corner

602
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,618
and there, like the
Quimp says, I find her.

603
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,620
You follow me, Father?

604
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,246
Yes I am.

605
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,295
Well I look at her and size her up.

606
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,508
One of those things, I think.

607
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,722
And I'm just about to say to her

608
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,842
no sister, not on my beat.

609
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,014
When she turns, and right
away I see another line.

610
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,060
You follow me Father?

611
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,682
Mmmhm, yup.

612
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,559
Well to get down to her, Father,

613
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,154
I find she's broke and run away from home.

614
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,444
There's no soul in town.

615
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,910
So instead of booking
her, I take her home.

616
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,199
It's all right with the Mrs for one night,

617
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,244
but if she stays any longer, well I guess

618
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,958
Mrs. McCarthy, good woman that she is,

619
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,953
is no different from any other woman.

620
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,999
You follow me, Father?

621
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,292
Yeah, I follow you.

622
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,165
So anyway, she tells us that she's

623
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,383
run away from home on account

624
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,718
of her folks don't understand her.

625
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,805
We tried arguing with her,
Father, but she's a tough one.

626
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,847
She thinks honor thy father and
thy mother is a belly laugh.

627
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,062
Well Father, guess I'll let
you pick it up from here.

628
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,977
Says her name's Carol James.

629
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,099
All right, McCarthy.

630
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:01,942
So long, Father.

631
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,777
Goodbye.

632
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,316
All right, you can go in now.

633
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,615
Come right in.

634
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,985
Would you sit down over here?

635
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,281
Carol.

636
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,329
Suppose you give us
your version of it huh?

637
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,453
I guess it's just about like he said.

638
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,250
You don't get along with your parents.

639
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,090
No.

640
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,332
So you're going to leave home?

641
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,549
Oh I've left.

642
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,255
How you fixed for funds?

643
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,378
I haven't any.

644
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,346
That's how I met Officer McCarthy.

645
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,885
Oh but I'll get by.

646
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,810
How about you go back home.

647
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,522
I tell you, at home
my life is intolerable.

648
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,525
Parents?

649
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,188
We don't agree on anything.

650
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,730
Don't like the way I do my hair,

651
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,480
my eyebrows, too much lipstick.

652
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,697
Something or other.

653
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,032
Too long, too short.

654
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,321
Do you think it's too short?

655
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,328
Well I...

656
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,746
I don't know.

657
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,535
They even object to my boyfriends.

658
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,535
And if they do let me go out
they say "where are you going?

659
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,831
"Come home early!

660
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,955
"Come right home after the show!"

661
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,251
"No drive-in."

662
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,552
And no matter how early
I get in, it's too late.

663
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:15,139
And if I say we ran out of
gas, they say I'm lying.

664
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,142
Are you?

665
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,310
Sometimes.

666
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,470
Did you ever think of maybe having

667
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,643
the boyfriends over to the house?

668
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,516
Now you talk like they do.

669
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,519
I tell you why I can't have
them over to the house,

670
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,691
because grandma sleeps in the living room.

671
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,234
She does huh?

672
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,779
By 9 o'clock we have
to be off the couch.

673
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,777
She needs it for a bed.

674
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,073
Can you imagine?

675
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,081
Course you know, there
might be two sides to it.

676
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,167
Maybe you're being a little unreasonable.

677
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,752
I'm 18.

678
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,754
18 huh?

679
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,081
As old as that?

680
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,212
You know, when I was 18 I thought

681
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,336
my father was pretty dumb.

682
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,679
After a while when I got
to be 21 I was amazed

683
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,517
to find out how much he
learned in three years.

684
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,352
Oh well.

685
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,595
Now that you're in New York,
what do you propose to do?

686
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,972
I'm going to get a job.

687
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,815
I'm a singer.

688
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,023
A singer huh?

689
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:06,901
You any good?

690
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,143
Well of course I'm good.

691
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,395
What makes you think so?

692
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,113
Well I'm just good, that's all.

693
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,108
Well would you sing something for me?

694
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,530
Maybe I can help you.

695
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,028
I'm supposed to be a pretty good judge.

696
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,281
You wouldn't know the
kind of songs I know.

697
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,827
How do you know?

698
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,170
Do you happen to know Day After Forever?

699
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,173
What key?

700
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,048
Would you mind dropping
it just a little?

Did I do that?

Oh definitely.

Hello, Father.

757
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,722
This young lady came to us for some help.

758
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,605
So it's work you're wanting.

759
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,727
Yes, Father.

760
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:24,156
Well I think maybe I can place you.

761
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,570
You can?

762
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,070
What would you think of
a little general housework?

763
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,163
Mrs. Scaponi with all those children.

764
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,203
11, no 12, 12 in October.

765
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,960
I think maybe she could use you.

766
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:37,838
Oh no.

767
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,671
I'm not looking for that kind of work.

768
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,669
I don't think you understand
Father, she's a singer.

769
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,295
Aren't you?

770
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,306
Well now.

771
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:52,010
And where, may I ask, are you
expecting to find employment?

772
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,684
In some nice cool airy
nightclub I suppose.

773
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,022
Any prospects?

774
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,391
Well no.

775
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,063
Not exactly.

776
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,608
And you're willing to starve
rather than push a broom.

777
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,366
You have a home, I presume.

778
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,031
Oh she just left it, Father.

779
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,950
Then go right back to your parents.

780
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,492
A fine little girl like you singing

781
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,369
in some place like the
Blue Goose or something.

782
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,246
Well you've got to
start someplace, Father.

783
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,747
Nonsense, being a good wife and a mother

784
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,465
is a good enough start for you.

785
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,960
Like your own mother.

786
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,302
Well goodbye, Father.

787
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,127
Goodbye.

788
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,771
Hey.

789
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,266
Young lady.

790
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,562
You go home and stay home

791
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,107
until the right man comes around.

792
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,277
The right man will
never come near our house.

793
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,990
But don't worry.

794
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,993
I'll get by.

795
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:56,834
Carol!

796
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,453
Wait just a minute.

797
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,463
Father.

798
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,624
Do you think you may have 10, Father?

799
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:06,468
Of what?

800
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,427
$10?

801
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,135
She's all alone, she hasn't a thing.

802
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,629
Open up our hearts, huh?

803
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
$10.

804
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,306
Just a minute.

805
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
How about five eh?

806
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:23,694
Five?

807
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,695
No no, 10.

808
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:35,871
Carol, I didn't like the way
you said that "I'll get by."

809
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,740
Here's a little something
to tide you over.

810
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,625
Oh, it's fine...

811
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,288
It's all right, it's not charity.

812
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,295
It's a loan.

813
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,464
Thanks.

814
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,502
I can use it.

815
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,259
I appreciate it.

816
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,254
Carol, I guess there's a lot of things

817
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,972
I should have said to you, advice for

818
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,261
one thing or another, but you

819
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,884
wouldn't have paid any attention.

820
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,013
After all, you are 18 aren't you?

821
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,139
Don't worry.

822
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,230
I'll be all right.

823
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,895
Of course you will, Carol.

824
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,938
I'll get by.

825
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,526
Oh don't say that.

826
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,771
Now let's hear from you, huh?

827
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,238
All right, Father.

828
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,074
Bye.

829
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,075
Bye Carol.

830
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,251
Hey fellas!

831
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,294
What are we doing hanging around here for?

832
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,219
'Cause I promised
O'Malley, that's what for.

833
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,184
Why?

834
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,678
'Cause I said so, see?

835
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,224
Hey fellas, look.

836
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,061
Waist petticoats.

837
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,439
First thing you know, he'll be

838
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,278
charming us into these things.

839
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,523
Yeah, making
altar boys out of us.

840
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,197
First guy up, I kick his teeth in see?

841
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,321
Now look yous, O'Malley's
a right guy, see?

842
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,331
Pick him up.

843
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,578
Now look yous, O'Malley's
a right guy, see?

844
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,622
He didn't rat on us
about the turkeys did he?

845
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,790
No.

846
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,709
Took us to a
baseball game didn't he?

847
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,831
Yeah.

848
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,924
Bought us hot dogs didn't he?

849
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,088
Yeah.

850
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,178
He's gonna take us
to a picture show ain't he?

851
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,546
How do we know?

852
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,553
Hello Father.

853
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,644
Say hello to the Father.

854
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,889
Hello Father.

855
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,899
Hi fellas.

856
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,943
Hey Father, where'd you get the outfit?

857
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,361
That's the St. Louis Browns.

858
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,700
I told you I used to work out with them.

859
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,035
They thought I brought them luck.

860
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,573
When I left town they
made me a present of it.

861
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,242
Oh that's just the
outfit to wear in a cellar.

862
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,616
Oh you, knocking my team.

863
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,626
Well I guess you fellas wonder

864
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,834
why I asked you down here huh?

865
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,453
Well hey Father, I wanna
talk to you a minute.

866
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,296
Can I?

867
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,131
Wanna see me?

868
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:49,965
Yeah, just a minute.

869
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,332
Pardon me boys.

870
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,132
Tony, what's on your mind?

871
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,256
Well Father, so you
won't have no beef coming,

872
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,723
I'm laying it on the line okay?

873
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,388
Okay.

874
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,227
Well he's here, Father.

875
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,719
Like I promised, only you
should've heard him squawk.

876
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,688
Worse than that turkey.

877
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,180
Oh the turkey, they did huh?

878
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,056
Yeah, they figured that being a priest

879
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,899
you was gonna slip them the old routine.

880
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,777
Oh yeah.

881
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,939
Personally, I'm for giving you a break,

882
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,528
and what I says is what the gang goes.

883
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,489
Swell of ya, Tony.

884
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,731
Aw it ain't nothing, Father.

885
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,199
Only the way it is now Father,

886
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,612
I'm on a hook for you, see?

887
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,076
I'm responsible for you, get me?

888
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,320
I won't let you down Tony.

889
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,912
Well maybe you won't,
but I'm telling you,

890
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,952
you step out of line just once and me and

891
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,042
the gang will drop ya
like you was a hot potato.

892
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:27,878
Okay?

893
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:28,960
Okay, can I talk to them now?

894
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:29,921
Oh sure.

895
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,922
Go ahead.

896
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,921
Boys, I'm not gonna do much talking.

897
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,890
Like Tony says, I'm gonna
lay it right on the line.

898
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,136
I asked you down here to do me a favor.

899
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,854
St. Dominic's needs a choir
and I wanna start one.

900
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,566
I know, I know what you're thinking,

901
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,980
but it's not gonna be that way at all.

902
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,023
It's gonna be fun.

903
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,443
Believe me, I like fun as much as anybody.

904
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,532
If it doesn't turn out
that way, if you think

905
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,526
I'm trying to slip something
over on you, well like

906
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,653
Tony says you can "drop
me like a hot potato."

907
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,373
What do you say?

908
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,291
You gonna give me a break?

909
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,499
Well Father, that depends.

910
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,788
What is it?

911
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,003
Well how many of you
here know Three Blind Mice?

912
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:11,838
I know it.

913
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,955
One.

914
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,081
Two, any more?

915
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:14,925
Three.

916
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:15,926
Oh come on, you all know it.

917
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,088
Everybody knows it?

918
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,095
Fine.

919
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,088
What's the matter with him over there?

920
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:21,932
Oh Herman?

921
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,390
He's pouting.

922
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,392
Hey Herman!

923
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,935
He's got a good bass voice.

924
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:31,775
You want him?

925
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,937
Well certainly, Tony.

926
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,981
You've got him, Father.

927
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,068
Now let's see, we gotta
divide this up some way.

928
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,362
Hey Herman, wait a minute.

929
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,577
The Father wants to see you.

930
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,870
Well I don't wanna see the Father!

931
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,334
Shhhh.

932
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,170
What is...

933
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,958
Keep quiet, will ya please?

934
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,706
Don't hit me on the
head, you make me dopey!

935
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,082
You are dopey.

936
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,009
Now keep quiet.

937
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,844
But I...

938
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,881
Come here.

939
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,503
Now look, he wants a bass singer...

940
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,675
I ain't a bass singer!

941
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,298
You are a bass singer!

942
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,015
Why am I a bass singer?

943
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,259
Oooh that burns me up!

944
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,351
My head, my head!

945
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,765
Shhh.

946
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,104
He wants a bass singer.

947
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,107
I don't know how to...

948
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,315
Will you go down please?

949
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,558
Will you go down?

950
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,276
Now keep quiet, okay?

951
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,238
Let's go.

952
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,239
Okay.

965
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,814
It's no business of mine Father,

966
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,227
but sometimes the things you do

967
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,852
in haste are the things we most regret.

968
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,819
Think it over a while.

969
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,030
Then if you really feel
you must see the bishop...

970
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,444
That I do.

971
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,192
But the boys are much better off here

972
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,489
than running the streets, I'm sure

973
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,283
that was Father O'Malley's idea.

974
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,201
I'm a charmed man, Mrs. Carmody.

975
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,949
But there's some things that get under

976
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,873
my skin and Three Blind
Mice is one of them.

977
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,336
But he's young, Father.

978
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,455
Eh?

979
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,754
I admit, maybe a wee bit impulsive.

980
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,252
But I know he means well.

981
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,674
And after all, it was the bishop

982
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,547
himself did put him here.

983
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,889
Yeah, and the bishop himself

984
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,100
will put him someplace else.

985
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:16,473
I'm going to ask to have
Father O'Malley transferred.

986
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,142
Don't worry.

987
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,269
It's not a bad report I'll be making.

988
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,987
I'll just tell the bishop that this

989
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,858
young man and I, that
we don't see eye to eye,

990
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,281
and I'd be happier if he
was sent some other place.

991
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,746
It's a long hard road
you've come, Father.

992
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,410
45 years and most of the time

993
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,784
carrying other people's burdens.

994
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,161
The time has come when you
should rest on your oars.

995
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,915
Take things a might
easier, enjoy your life.

Let somebody else carry the load for you.

a strong pair of shoulders.

Now we got our sections down,

1009
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,657
I'm gonna give each section a note.

1010
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,784
And we'll put them all together
and we'll have a chord.

1011
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,911
Take this section first, here's your note.

My name's Elmer.

Elmer?

1032
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,782
Your voice is changing or something is it?

1033
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:51,992
Yeah, I guess so, Father.

1034
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,405
Think we'll have to
drop you down a bracket.

1035
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,869
You get over here in the third section.

1036
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,363
Elmer's a switch hitter it seems.

1037
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,949

1054
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,071

and we got a nice chord.

chord number two, chord number three.

1066
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,321
Put those three chords together
and we can sing a song.

1067
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,909
I'll hold up the fingers,
those will be your signals.

Watch the signals now.

Yeah, let's go ahead.

1090
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,974
You saw the bishop, Father?

1091
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,889
Yeah, yeah.

1092
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,387
Would you ask Father O'Malley if

1093
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,106
he'd mind stepping into me study?

1094
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,785
You wanted to see me, Father?

1095
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,829
Yeah, yes I did, I did.

1096
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,204
Sit down, sit down.

1097
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:44,057
Father O'Malley, I've
been to see the bishop.

1098
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:46,802
Oh you have?

1099
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,599
And I want to be frank with you.

1100
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,897
I must admit that my purpose in going

1101
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,647
to see the bishop was
to have you transferred.

1102
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,911
I'm sorry you don't like me, Father.

1103
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,375
I don't dislike anyone.

1104
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,416
It's just that I disagree with you.

1105
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,255
What did the bishop say?

1106
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,966
After a little talk, he congratulated me

1107
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,586
on my 45 years at St. Dominic's.

1108
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,598
He has a remarkable memory.

1109
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,302
He said it was a monument to

1110
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,680
the fact that I had built it.

1111
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,892
Coming from the bishop,

1112
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,860
that's certainly a fine compliment.

1113
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,106
Then I told him I'd
come to talk about you.

1114
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,278
That seemed to disturb him.

1115
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,444
Then he started telling me about

1116
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,037
what a fine young man you are.

1117
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:53,001
Capable, progressive, how
much confidence he had in you.

1118
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:56,876
He even told me that he had a nice talk

1119
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,750
with you before you reported to me.

1120
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,096
Course he didn't tell me
what you two talked about.

1121
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,559
He didn't have to.

1122
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,639
I could see it in the good man's eyes.

1123
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:19,986
When you get to my age you
can tell that, you know?

1124
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,573
Then after a little more telling me how

1125
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:27,194
progressive you were, he
asked me why I'd come.

1126
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,571
Unknown what was on his
mind, and to save him

1127
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,790
the embarrassment of having to tell me.

1128
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,916
The bishop wouldn't hurt anyone.

1129
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,710
I put him at his ease.

1130
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,426
Bishop, I said, the very thing that's

1131
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,341
on your mind is on mine, it's the

1132
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,931
very thing I've come to see you about.

1133
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,143
I want you to put young Father O'Malley

1134
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,521
in charge of St. Dominic's.

1135
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,601
The bishop seemed much relieved.

1136
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,228
He congratulated me on my ability

1137
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,526
to see so clearly at my age.

1138
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,782
On my ability to face the inevitable.

1139
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,707
Then what happened?

1140
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,088
That was all.

1141
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,468
Oh Father.

1142
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,755
Why can't we go along
just as we have been?

1143
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,223
No no, you're in charge now.

1144
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,519
Sit down.

1145
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,729
No Father.

1146
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,065
Sit down, I'll familiarize you with...

1147
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:43,903
There's no hurry, we can
do that anytime, Father.

1148
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,614
Well is there anything
you'd like me to do?

1149
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,983
I mean now.

1150
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:48,993
Nothing.

1151
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:51,579
Well then.

1152
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:57,910
If you don't mind, I'll lie
down a while before dinner.

1153
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,536
All right, Father.

1154
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,592
When you and the bishop
had your little talk,

1155
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,429
it was more or less along
those lines wasn't it?

1156
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,717
Yes.

1157
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,953
I think you better start without him.

1158
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:36,448
Looks like he's not
coming down for dinner.

1159
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,201
Well he said he wanted
to take a little nap.

1160
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:40,998
He didn't look well did he?

1161
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,371
When he came in this evening.

1162
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,962
Go see if he's awake.

1163
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:50,178
If he's coming down, I'll wait for him.

1164
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,555
Father O'Malley!

1165
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:57,848
Father O'Malley!

1166
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,731
Father!

1167
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:02,900
He's gone.

1168
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,187
He's packed his things.

1169
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,275
Everything.

1170
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,195
He's gone.

1171
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,113
Where would he go?

1172
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,571
I can't imagine.

1173
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,705
Okay, sure.

1174
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,329
But keep at it, will ya?

1175
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,171
No, you can't miss him.

1176
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,290
A little guy.

1177
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,883
Old.

1178
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,094
Got a grip and an umbrella.

1179
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,347
Okay.

1180
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,841
Nothing yet, Father.

1181
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,811
They're gonna check the
subways, the hospitals.

1182
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,930
Look Father, take it easy will you?

1183
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,147
And you better go home.

1184
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,857
No use the two of us getting drowned.

1185
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,022
All right, but you call me
the minute you hear anything.

1186
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:47,820
I will.

1187
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:48,738
I don't care what time it is.

1188
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,105
I will, Father.

1189
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,919
Shall I make some coffee?

1190
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:09,926
Wha, hmm?

1191
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,168
Oh, no thank you.

1192
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,190
Come on.

1193
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,978
Now what's the matter?

1194
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,113
If you don't mind, I'd
rather go in by myself.

1195
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,402
If you don't mind, I found you

1196
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,991
and I'm going to deliver you personally.

1197
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,860
That's not necessary.

1198
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,039
There's no reward you know.

1199
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,250
It's going to be a little difficult

1200
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,619
and I'd rather explain to Father O'Malley

1201
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,747
in me own way, and I can do that

1202
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,669
better when you're not around.

1203
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:51,757
Okay.

1204
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,968
But if you want my
advice, you just tell him

1205
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,008
you've been a bad boy, you ran away

1206
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,848
from home, and you're sorry.

1207
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,762
And if you want my
advice, you'll go to church

1208
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,681
on Sunday, say you haven't been to Mass

1209
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:05,556
in 10 years, and that you're sorry.

1210
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Hello.

1211
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,452
If you don't mind, I've come back.

1212
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,997
But only temporarily.

1213
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:11,212
Until me plans are more formulated.

1214
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,706
Maybe you wouldn't mind letting me stay.

1215
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,754
I'll be no bother to you.

1216
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,302
Here Father, let's get out of these

1217
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,767
wet clothes and get you up to bed huh?

1218
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,807
But I don't expect me
old room, that's yours now.

1219
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,179
Oh I haven't moved in there yet.

1220
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,647
No no, I insist, that's your room.

1221
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,266
I'll sleep on the cot, anywhere.

1222
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,187
I'll not even be
bothering you for me food.

1223
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,031
I'll eat out.

1224
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,193
We'll talk about that later.

1225
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,782
Mrs. Carmody will bring
you something on a tray.

1226
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,993
No no no no, I'm not a bit hungry, I...

1227
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,328
Come on now Father, just a wee snack.

1228
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,243
I've been keeping it for you on the stove.

1229
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,992
Nice juicy cut of roast
beef, Yorkshire pudding,

1230
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,959
and there were some
creamed onions too huh?

1231
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,124
And some asparagus with
buttered breadcrumbs.

1232
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,750
Golden brown potatoes
and a nice cup of coffee.

1233
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,425
Well if you insist, just a
small portion of everything.

1234
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,562
I hope it wasn't too much
trouble for you, Mrs. Carmody.

1235
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,809
No trouble at all, Father.

1236
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,857
I feel I ought to help
you with the dishes.

1237
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,150
Don't worry about the dishes.

1238
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:22,275
Isn't much washing they'll be needing.

1239
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,913
Say, you're still a little cold Father,

1240
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:30,408
you were drenched to the skin.

1241
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,752
You oughta take a little
something to warm you up.

1242
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,465
Do you have a wee drop
of the creature about?

1243
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,549
Matter of fact, I might
have a little one with you.

1244
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,092
I was out myself tonight.

1245
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,965
I went out for a paper.

1246
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,143
Ah, well in that case.

1247
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,729
I'll ask Mrs. Carmody
where she keeps it.

1248
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,144
No no no no, look
yonder in the bookcase.

1249
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,151
Oh.

1250
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,312
No no, other side.

1251
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,109
No down, down.

1252
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:05,076
You'll find it behind The
Life of General Grant.

1253
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,012
Bit of ol' Ireland huh?

1254
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:32,019
Every Christmas since I left,

1255
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,981
my old mother sends me one of these.

1256
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:42,147
With a degree of abstinence
it becomes me calendar.

1257
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,114
I get a little behind during Lent,

1258
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,983
but it comes out even at Christmas.

1259
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:12,844
That's me mother.

1260
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,604
She's very beautiful.

1261
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:18,065
Of course that was taken some time ago.

1262
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,104
She's 90 now.

1263
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,190
Let's drink to your mother.

1264
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:25,907
Hope you'll be seeing her soon, Father.

1265
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,526
What about your mother?

1266
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,153
Well I don't remember much about her.

1267
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,781
She died when I was quite young.

1268
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,088
Well.

1269
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,249
Let's drink to the two of them anyway.

1270
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,793
Thank you, Father.

1271
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,221
You know, Father O'Malley?

1272
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:58,348
I always planned that as soon as I got

1273
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,941
a few dollars ahead, I'll go back

1274
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:04,779
to the old country and see my mother.

1275
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,443
Would you believe it?

1276
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,236
That was 45 years ago.

1277
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:12,411
And every time I get
a few dollars ahead...

1278
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:13,700
There's always somebody that

1279
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:17,291
seems to need it more than you do.

1280
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,126
Aye, you'd like her.

1281
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,371
She'd like you too.

1282
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,249
She always had a song in her heart.

1283
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,293
I can almost hear her now.

1284
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,975
Me boy, do you know too-ra-loo-ra-loo?

1296
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,970
Here Tony, here's the fare.

1297
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,388
Everybody right home and to bed!

1298
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:41,511
Get a lot of rest!

1299
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,433
I'm responsible for ya.

1300
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,397
Don't forget we got a
rehearsal in the morning huh?

1301
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,686
Oh gee Father, ain't you coming with us?

1302
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:47,979
No, I think I'll walk home alone.

1303
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,978
I wanna think about my sermon for Sunday.

1304
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:52,025
Has to be an extra special
one for your parents.

1305
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:52,865
Oh good.

1306
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,823
On how to bring up children.

1307
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:57,990
Oh Father, good luck to you!

1308
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,578
Good luck Father!

1309
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:12,551
Chuck.

1310
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:15,721
Gennie.

1311
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,634
Chuck, it's good to see you.

1312
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,678
Well it's good to see you too.

1313
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,051
Where were you going Gennie?

1314
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,518
To work, and I'm late.

1315
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,521
Come along.

1316
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,041
What are you doing here?

1317
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,126
This is the Metropolitan.

1318
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,210
This is where I work!

1319
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,080
Wait a minute, isn't that Carmen?

1320
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,258
Huh?

1321
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:56,428
What do you play?

1322
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,965
One of the spectators at the bullfight?

1323
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,965
Believe it or not, I'm Carmen.

1324
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,386
Gennie Tuffle, Carmen?

1325
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,474
Oh I've changed that.

1326
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:04,685
It's Genevieve Linden.

1327
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,223
I was singing Carmen in Rio and they

1328
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,268
heard me and said would you sing it here.

1329
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,606
Here, can you imagine?

1330
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,601
Gennie Tuffle at the Metropolitan.

1331
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:12,897
Imagine that.

1332
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,191
Well Chuck, make yourself comfortable.

1333
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,155
I have to be getting on.

1334
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,742
Oh it's good to see you Chuck.

1335
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,498
Come on Effie, I'm terribly late.

1336
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,041
I don't know why I'm even talking to you!

1337
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:31,922
No?

1338
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:34,006
Why didn't you write?

1339
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,670
I did write.

1340
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,886
I know you did, but why did you stop?

1341
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,881
Didn't I tell you?

1342
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,223
No you didn't.

1343
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,842
But you're going to.

1344
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:50,897
Gennie.

1345
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,268
Please, I want to ask
you just a small favor.

1346
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,271
Hello Tommy, what is it?

1347
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,238
Tonight, would you be so good as to

1348
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,858
glance occasionally at my baton?

1349
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:04,236
Tonight, let's not race, let's try

1350
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:07,285
just for once to finish together huh?

1351
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,367
All right Tommy, I promise.

1352
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:12,916
And Tommy, do me a favor.

1353
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,333
Meet Chuck O'Malley.

1354
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,707
He's a very old friend of mine.

1355
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:19,552
Chuck, Senor Tomaso Bozanni.

1356
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:20,554
Father.

1357
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:22,421
Chuck?

1358
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,640
She always calls me that.

1359
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,559
You haven't told me yet Chuck.

1360
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,599
Why did you stop writing?

1361
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,474
I did tell you in my last letter.

1362
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:35,358
Which letter was that?

1363
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:42,359
Guess that must've been
the letter you didn't get.

1364
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,782
You wrote to me in Rome, in Florence.

1365
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,825
Naples, Vienna, Budapest.

1366
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,125
Then I went to Switzerland and I found

1367
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,461
one of your letters
waiting for me in Luzzone.

1368
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:57,673
Oh you should've been there, Chuck.

1369
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,416
It was a week before Christmas.

1370
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,214
There was a quaint little post office.

1371
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,088
I walked up to it in the snow.

1372
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,839
The moon was so bright that I read

1373
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,593
your letter on the way home.

1374
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:11,391
And I answered it that night.

1375
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,356
But that letter in Luzzone
was the last one I got.

1376
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:17,397
From there I went to South America.

1377
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,611
There were no more letters.

1378
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,523
What happened Chuck?

1379
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,702
Chuck, what hap...

1380
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,286
Father Chuck.

1381
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,920
It'll take me a little
while to get used to that.

1382
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,762
Where's your parish, Father?

1383
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,848
I'm over here at St. Dominic's.

1384
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,967
About 10 blocks from here.

1385
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,563
Remember Timmy?

1386
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:56,519
Tim O'Dowd?

1387
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,143
Yes, of course I do.

1388
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:03,067
He's at St. Francis
now, he's a priest too.

1389
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:04,986
Dear ol' Timmy.

1390
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,483
Can you imagine that?

1391
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:09,532
Well I'll have to be running along.

1392
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,872
Oh please, please don't go.

1393
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,366
Tommy, he can stand in the wings can't he?

1394
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,959
It would be a privilege.

1395
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,419
Please.

1396
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:18,663
You know, Tommy?

1397
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,170
Father O'Malley was the first one

1398
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,042
to tell me I could sing.

1399
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,012
Maybe one day I'll
tell her the same thing.

1400
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:28,676
If she listens to you
Father, maybe you could

1401
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:32,427
persuade her to listen just once to me.

1402
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:33,723
Watch the baton.

1403
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,226
Good luck, Miss Tuffle.

1404
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,927
You wanted to see me Father?

1405
01:13:58,935 --> 01:13:59,971
Yeah, yeah.

1406
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:04,681
Mrs. Quimp here, good woman that she is,

1407
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,023
has come here with a bit
of disturbing information.

1408
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,437
I think it should more properly

1409
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,276
be brought to your attention.

1410
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,817
That's nice work Mrs. Quimp, what is it?

1411
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:17,193
Suppose you tell Father
O'Malley in your own words.

1412
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,069
You better tell him, Father.

1413
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,080
Huh?

1414
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,497
Well your little songbird who was

1415
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,792
without funds, but not a
bit interested in general

1416
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:33,042
housework, is fitting a
nest in her own manner.

1417
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,839
And if Mrs. Quimp's observations

1418
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,883
are correct, a very fine manor it is.

1419
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,973
It seems, Father O'Malley, that the

1420
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,808
young lady in question has an apartment

1421
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,474
directly across the street.

1422
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,893
Opposite Mrs. Quimp's bedroom.

1423
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:51,105
And according to Mrs.
Quimp, young Ted Haines

1424
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:53,525
comes early and stays so late that...

1425
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:57,400
Mrs. Quimp is losing a lot of sleep.

1426
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,153
It's queer isn't it, Father?

1427
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,324
Young Haines was ready to throw me out

1428
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,119
without so much as a how do you do.

1429
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:07,459
But when it comes to this young "lady,"

1430
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,498
and mark you, there are other words

1431
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:13,670
I could call her, he acts quite different.

1432
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,714
Don't you think it's strange?

1433
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:17,837
That's a question.

1434
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,338
People do funny things you know.

1435
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,385
Father O'Malley.

1436
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,008
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

1437
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,807
The nose on whose father Father?

1438
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:28,180
Well it doesn't matter
whose face it's on.

1439
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,557
You and I have got to face it.

1440
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,568
Excuse us.

1441
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:40,155
This is very suspicious, Father O'Malley.

1442
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,948
As you're more familiar with the case,

1443
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:44,321
I think you should handle it.

1444
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,286
I handle the little sins.

Hello Father.

1453
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:29,867
Hello Carol.

1454
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,046
Hi Father.

1455
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,047
Hello.

1456
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:36,839
I heard you.

1457
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:37,923
That's more like it.

1458
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,088
Thank you, Father.

1459
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:43,965
Maybe it's because I'm putting
more meaning into the words.

1460
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,011
Very nice here isn't it?

1461
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:53,858
Very nice.

1462
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,448
Now before you go any further Father...

1463
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,033
You mean it's all in my mind?

1464
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,243
That's right.

1465
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,992
Yes, I'm sure Father is just

1466
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,742
dying to hear more of the details.

1467
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:12,585
Huh?

1468
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:13,419
Yes.

1469
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,254
Won't you sit down?

1470
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,255
Mmmhm.

1471
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,711
Well I was going down the street,

1472
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,587
and minding my own business too,

1473
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,635
when who do you think just happened by,

1474
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,224
purely by accident of course,

1475
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,560
and pulled up alongside of the curb?

1476
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,179
Ted Haines Jr.

1477
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,350
Right.

1478
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,690
And what do you think his approach was?

1479
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:36,729
You tell him.

1480
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,772
I prefer not to remember.

1481
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,362
Well being a woman, I do.

1482
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,073
His exact words were "Hey
good looking, what's cooking?"

1483
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,318
Aw now wait a minute.

1484
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:50,038
What I really said was "Who
do you know that I know?"

1485
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,497
You know that's worse?

1486
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,741
Well...

1487
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:54,788
Well that was that, and
with practically no more

1488
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,663
of a buildup than that,
he asked me to lunch.

1489
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,005
Who knows, it might have worked.

1490
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:01,125
It's been known to.

1491
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:02,876
So after I'd cooled him off I came

1492
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,004
back here, no job, no money,

1493
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,971
expecting to be thrown out any minute.

1494
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,181
There was a knock on the door and I said

1495
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,801
to myself the landlord, here it comes.

1496
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,518
And who do you think was there?

1497
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,728
Junior?

1498
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:14,731
Right.

1499
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,018
I was so surprised.

1500
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:16,983
So was I.

1501
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:21,312
Well up to here we're all surprised.

1502
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,863
Naturally before throwing me out

1503
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,573
he had to know a little about me.

1504
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:29,240
So in a few well chosen
sentences I gave him the details.

1505
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,488
Sorta like I told you.

1506
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:34,411
And you found a landlord
with a heart of gold.

1507
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:36,831
Well not exactly a heart of gold Father,

1508
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,250
but well we had the apartment vacant

1509
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:42,215
and it seemed a shame to throw her out.

1510
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,335
Well anyway, what's wrong with that?

1511
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:47,713
Nothing that I know of up to here.

1512
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:51,558
Well as I was saying, it
was a shame to throw her out.

1513
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,721
Like Mrs. Quimp?

1514
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:53,561
Yeah.

1515
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,178
No!

1516
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,101
Well that's different.

1517
01:18:57,107 --> 01:19:00,020
I can see that obviously.

1518
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,814
Look Father, she told me about coming

1519
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,688
to see you and that
you wanted to help her.

1520
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:07,907
You don't have a corner
on helping people do you?

1521
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,448
And besides, I've practically
got her lined up in a job.

1522
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,117
Yes, and soon as I get it
I'm going to pay him back.

1523
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:15,365
Every nickel of it.

1524
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:17,584
And you too, Father.

1525
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,873
Don't worry about me.

1526
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,714
Rather a nice looking piano you have here.

1527
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:25,379
Well she needs one doesn't she?

1528
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,343
She's gotta practice, she's a singer.

1529
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:28,712
That's very thoughtful.

1530
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,556
Course pianos are a little
expensive these days.

1531
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:35,552
Well I asked her first
if she can play a ukulele.

1532
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:36,848
Well then naturally.

1533
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:37,891
Yeah, naturally.

1534
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,892
Carol tells me you can play, Father.

1535
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,063
How about trying this one out

1536
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,481
and see if I got a good buy.

1537
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:47,526
Yes, play something for us, Father.

1538
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,835
Would you mind us asking
you a few questions, Father?

1539
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,170
No.

1540
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,334
Where'd you get that wicked left hand?

1541
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,708
Well I've always been
interested in music.

1542
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,756
Used to write a bit of it at school.

1543
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,721
Had a little band, I used to
play for the school dances.

1544
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:14,845
O'Malley's Orioles.

1545
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:20,726
You know, at one time I had
quite a decision to make.

1546
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:24,773
Whether to write the
nation's songs or go my way.

1547
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,317
Any regrets, Father?

1548
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,157
Regrets?

1549
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,074
No.

1550
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,907
I get a great happiness
out of helping people

1551
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,618
realize that religion
doesn't have to be this.

1552
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:40,166
Taking all the fun out of everything.

1553
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,205
Can be bright.

1554
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,545
Bring you closer to happiness.

1555
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,210
You go to church Ted?

1556
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:47,423
Well...

1557
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:51,420
Would you rather I change the subject?

1558
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,547
If I could just express
musically what I have

1559
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:57,096
in my mind, it would
be much more eloquent.

1560
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,978
Sound simpler than be remembered.

1561
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:06,151
Sometimes the spoken
word can be pretty dull.

1562
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:09,442
You mean sing your sermons, Father?

1563
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,734
Yeah, sorta.

1564
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,528
Have you ever
had anything published?

1565
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,534
No, no.

1566
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:18,872

of your unpublished ones?

01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:13,945
Goodbye Carol.

1586
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:14,947
Goodbye Ted.

1587
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,694
Bye Father.

1588
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:25,915
Nice thought.

1589
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:28,872
Going my way.

1590
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:33,418
Isn't it Ted?

1591
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,222
He's quite a fella.

1592
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:49,556
Good morning, Father.

1593
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,603
I'd like to present Miss Genevieve Linden.

1594
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,351
Gennie, this is Father Fitzgibbon.

1595
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:54,443
Good morning, Father.

1596
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,404
How do you do?

1597
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:56,197
She's a singer.

1598
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,198
Huh?

1599
01:23:58,992 --> 01:23:59,992
Ah.

1600
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:02,245
Looking for work?

1601
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:04,238
Oh no, no, Father.

1602
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:07,116
She sings at the Metropolitan Opera House.

1603
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,242
Well now, it's a great privilege

1604
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:11,085
to meet you, Miss Linden.

1605
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:12,624
You've come quite a ways in the world huh?

1606
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:13,464
Well I...

1607
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:14,581
Travel extensively?

1608
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,627
Yes, quite a bit.

1609
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,000
Ah, well where's your home?

1610
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,797
Well I just bought
a home in Long Island.

1611
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,261
Well, a nice home?

1612
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,180
Very lovely.

1613
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,888
In that care undoubtedly
you'd be interested

1614
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,759
in a crazy quilt, we're raffling it off.

1615
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,769
Again?

1616
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:31,647
We're trying to raise a
little money, Father O'Dowd.

1617
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,483
I see.

1618
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,401
How many?

1619
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,893
I'll take them all.

1620
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,360
How much are they?

1621
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:39,574
Be $10.

1622
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:42,827
Thank you.

1623
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,035
And I hope you win this one.

1624
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:44,870
Thank you.

1625
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,237
And I hope you win it too, Gennie.

1626
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,535
Then perhaps you'll
donate it to our church.

1627
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:51,285
And we can raffle it off
over there all over again.

1628
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:53,912
Oh I'd hate to see that
crazy quilt leaving the parish.

1629
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,836
Where's the Pied Piper
and his merry little men?

1630
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:58,801
Down in the basement.

1631
01:24:58,802 --> 01:24:59,635
Thank you, Father.

1632
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:00,469
Come Gennie.

1633
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,304
Goodbye Father.

1634
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:02,138
Goodbye, thank you.

1635
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:05,928
Congratulations on
selling all your tickets.

1636
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:16,986
Like some more?

1637
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:17,820
Mmmhm.

1638
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,687
You're our first audience you know.

1639
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:21,189
Ready boys?

1640
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,879
That's the best.

1641
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,667
Course we have our more serious side.

1642
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,255
Would you like to hear the
boys sing something nice?

1643
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:40,045
Something with a little more beauty?

1644
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:41,418
Yes, very much.

1645
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,381
That was very well done boys.

1646
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:53,599
That's all.

1647
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,138
Thank you so much.

1648
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:58,013
See you all tomorrow huh?

1649
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:01,682
They're angels.

1650
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:05,812
They've got something you
lose when you get older.

1651
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:09,490
What's the matter Timmy?

1652
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:10,984
Nothing, nothing.

1653
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,326
That was beautiful, Chuck.

1654
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:13,445
Beautiful.

1655
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:15,071
Of course we don't get
Miss Genevieve Linden

1656
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,789
of the Metropolitan down here every day.

1657
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,409
Nor deems O'Dowd either.

1658
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:22,162
Oh now wait a minute, wait a minute.

1659
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:23,379
I'm glad to see you kept up

1660
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,919
your interest in music, Father.

1661
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,918
Are you writing anything anymore?

1662
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:29,009
Oh yes.

1663
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,219
I have a little song here now that

1664
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,339
Timmy's gonna take to a publisher.

1665
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:33,965
A very good friend of
his, and if he likes it

1666
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:37,594
that might be the answer
to all our trouble.

1667
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:40,980
I have bad news for ya.

1668
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,348
I've been to the publisher, Chuck.

1669
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:43,566
He wasn't interested.

1670
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:45,025
Wouldn't even look at it.

1671
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:47,065
Said they were loaded up.

1672
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,447
May I see it?

1673
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,822
So you're still in trouble.

1674
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,039
Wouldn't even look at it huh?

1675
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,452
Oh he glanced at it.

1676
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,075
What'd he have to say?

1677
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:03,294
"Schmaltz isn't selling this season."

1678
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:04,377
Schmaltz?

1679
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:05,713
And what are they buying?

1680
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:06,715
Bafola.

1681
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:08,207
No, I think they call it vafola.

1682
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:09,051
Ah, vafola.

1683
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:10,133
- Vafola.
- Vafola.

1684
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:12,344
Boy I heard some of their song hits.

1685
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:15,306
It was Hut-Sut Time on the Rillerah.

1686
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:19,185
And then there was another one,

1687
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,019
I couldn't even understand the words.

1688
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:23,389
This fella lost his
girl in Salt Lake City.

1689
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,689
Then he goes on to say the
altitude is 5,400 feet.

1690
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:27,570
Interesting.

1691
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,982
The average temperature 73.

1692
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:31,106
The section is noted for gold, silver,

1693
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,778
copper grade, but that doesn't

1694
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,116
make any difference to this fella

1695
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,406
because he's lost his sugar.

1696
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:38,863
Vafola.

1697
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,957
Oh I know what vafola is.

1698
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,040
It's...

1699
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:49,915
What's the matter with that?

1700
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:50,962
Not for me.

1701
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,506
Can you imagine Beat Me Eight

1702
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:56,005
to the Bar by Daddy O'Malley?

1703
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,348
Oh no.

1704
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,521
I like this.

1705
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,481
She's buying schmaltz.

1706
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:08,859
Going My Way.

1707
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:11,237
Will you autograph it for me?

1708
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,239
All right.

1709
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:15,659
Thank you.

1710
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,285
Well I have to go now.

1711
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,745
Father Tim, can I drop you off?

1712
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:21,455
You can, thank you.

1713
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:26,456
There you are.

1714
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,711
Thank you.

1715
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,588
Goodbye.

1716
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,093
My pen, Father.

1717
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:43,810
Oh, oh yes.

1718
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:45,509
Good day.

1719
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,083
Oh.

1720
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:06,001
Yes?

1721
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:17,513
Uh-huh.

1722
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:20,724
Mmmhm.

1723
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:27,523
Uh-huh.

1724
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:29,942
Mmmhm.

1725
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:32,563
Well who are you?

1726
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:36,572
I want to have a talk
with you, that's who I am.

1727
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:37,574
Ooooh.

1728
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,401
You must be his father.

1729
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,367
How old are you?

1730
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:45,374
I'm 18.

1731
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:47,787
Well that's good.

1732
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:57,464
Well.

1733
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:58,677
Oh Ted!

1734
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,967
Be right with you darling!

1735
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,201
What?

1736
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:25,831
Hello dad.

1737
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:34,292
Where have you been
for the past two weeks?

1738
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:35,299
Well dad.

1739
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:41,137
I've been in a blue Heaven
dancing on a pink cloud.

1740
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:42,801
She came in on a moonbeam.

1741
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,049
That's a lie, I had you followed.

1742
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,972
That wasn't cricket, dad.

1743
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:49,061
When you were my age I
didn't follow you around.

1744
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:55,567
Everything I say kills her.

1745
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,686
It kills me too.

1746
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:58,653
Do you realize this is
one of my apartments?

1747
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:00,989
Oh yes, I had it redecorated.

1748
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,654
And that's one of my robes.

1749
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,403
Yes, I had it altered.

1750
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,871
I'm going to like him.

1751
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:10,491
Do you know I could have
you thrown out of town?

1752
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:13,119
Maybe I know something
about her you don't know.

1753
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,416
She was picked up on the
street by the police.

1754
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,085
Oh I know that.

1755
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,175
Maybe we know something
that you don't know.

1756
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,293
We're married.

1757
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,347
Married?

1758
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,183
Oooh I'll have that annulled.

1759
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,346
Uh-uh.

1760
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:29,844
You can only get them annulled when

1761
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:31,516
they aren't right in the first place.

1762
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:33,230
Ours was right.

1763
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:36,397
We said something about
'til death do us part.

1764
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:37,402
Remember?

1765
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:40,563
Where were you married?

1766
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:42,485
St. Dominic's, Father O'Malley.

1767
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:44,154
O'Malley?

1768
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,526
A secret marriage eh?

1769
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:48,450
Well he's put his foot in it this time.

1770
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:49,822
It wasn't a secret marriage dad,

1771
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,369
it was in all the papers.

1772
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:52,867
I didn't see it.

1773
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,164
Well you never get past
the financial column.

1774
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,037
Don't be impertinent.

1775
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,961
Young woman, do you know how
he's planning to support you?

1776
01:33:59,968 --> 01:34:01,675
You know he's quit his job.

1777
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:03,135
That's all right.

1778
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:04,504
I'll support him.

1779
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,927
Sure, she's working.

1780
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:08,934
You...

1781
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:12,011
You'd live off your wife?

1782
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:13,728
Well mother was a big
help to you wasn't she?

1783
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:15,939
Until you got on your feet.

1784
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:19,692
That was entirely different.

1785
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:21,904
I made something of myself.

1786
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:30,325
Yes dad, you certainly have.

1787
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,331
Look son.

1788
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,001
My boy.

1789
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:38,287
Have you no family pride?

1790
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:39,298
Uh-uh.

1791
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:42,670
No shame?

1792
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:43,758
Nope.

1793
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:45,718
You certainly slipped, my boy.

1794
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,554
You've lost everything.

1795
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:49,219
I don't think so dad.

1796
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:51,342
I think I found something.

1797
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:53,478
Mmmhm.

1798
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:01,819
Well darling, I guess
I'd better get dressed.

1799
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:15,913
I think I'm a failure as a father.

1800
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:18,036
I don't think so.

1801
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:19,287
Darling!

1802
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:20,504
Where's my hat?

1803
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:22,999
I'll get it.

1804
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,491
You'll have to forgive the way

1805
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:59,619
we've been acting today, dad.

1806
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:01,245
We were a little hysterical.

1807
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:04,499
I guess we were both a little mad.

1808
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,045
Well I'm mad too.

1809
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,507
Quitting his job like that.

1810
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:11,551
Running off and getting married.

1811
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:13,344
I don't know, this younger generation

1812
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,889
doesn't seem to have any sense.

1813
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:52,466
So long, sweetie.

1814
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:55,511
God bless you.

1815
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:02,223
Goodbye dad.

1816
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:06,064
That plane you gave me did the trick.

1817
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,153
When they found out about
my 600 hours in the air

1818
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:10,148
they said okay bud, we want you in.

1819
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:11,158
Well.

1820
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,367
Be nice to her dad.

1821
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,906
She'll grow on you.

1822
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:20,334
Goodbye boy.

1823
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:31,053
Well.

1824
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:33,638
He's gone.

1825
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:35,891
Dad.

1826
01:37:40,646 --> 01:37:42,228
Look Max.

1827
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:43,597
Max.

1828
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:45,190
Max, you just have to do this for me

1829
01:37:45,193 --> 01:37:47,230
and I don't want any arguments about it.

1830
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:49,398
I'm afraid we got all
the songs we need, Father.

1831
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,112
Our catalog is full.

1832
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:52,777
Oh now, now, now wait a minute.

1833
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:53,945
I've been through a lot of trouble

1834
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,362
to arrange this, so grab your hat,

1835
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:58,113
and a taxi, and get right over here.

1836
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,081
Yes now!

1837
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,323
This very minute!

1838
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:02,245
If you don't, I'll put
the Irish curse on you.

1839
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:05,585
Goodbye Father.

1840
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:09,415
That's Father O'Dowd, a friend of mine.

1841
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:10,791
What did he want, a donation?

1842
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:11,676
No.

1843
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:14,215
Pal of his has got a song
and he's plugging it.

1844
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:15,929
And what a plug.

1845
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:17,548
He's grabbed off the Metropolitan

1846
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:19,515
Opera House with the full orchestra

1847
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:22,307
conducted by this fellow Tomaso...

1848
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:25,143
Whatever his name is, the star

1849
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:28,608
Genevieve Linden, and
a choir of 30 voices.

1850
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:32,195
All this fuss to put over a
song written by a pal of his.

1851
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:34,064
And they're waiting right
now for us at the Met.

1852
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:35,191
At the Metropolitan?

1853
01:38:35,201 --> 01:38:38,535

Wonderful.

1880
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:14,558
You sang it great, Miss Linden.

1881
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:15,527
Thank you.

1882
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:17,235
That's a pretty good
song you got there, Father.

1883
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:18,071
Thank you.

1884
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:19,188
I guess you oughta know.

1885
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:20,359
You bet he does.

1886
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:22,403
They say he's the sharpest
little man in town.

1887
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,949
Well now I'm embarrassed.

1888
01:41:26,956 --> 01:41:28,538
You mean to talk business?

1889
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:29,416
The money?

1890
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:31,784
Oh don't let that embarrass you.

1891
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:32,625
We love it.

1892
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:35,662
Well what I wanted to say is that

1893
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:37,130
although it's great, it's just as

1894
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:39,625
I told you, Father, it's too good for us.

1895
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:41,843
It's way over our head.

1896
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:43,633
You see, it's not just the type of song

1897
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:46,097
that a guy would, pardon me Father,

1898
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,308
that a gentleman would croon

1899
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:51,054
to his babe, if you know what I mean.

1900
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:55,307
It doesn't say enough,
it hasn't got that...

1901
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:57,355
Well it's just not for me.

1902
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:58,602
I think you oughta try it out on

1903
01:41:58,613 --> 01:42:02,197
someone who publishes higher class stuff.

1904
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:03,315
Thanks.

1905
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:06,819
Well I guess we better
get back to the office.

1906
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:09,071
You know Father, I could be wrong.

1907
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:10,913
I hope I am.

1908
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:11,750
Goodbye.

1909
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:12,751
Goodbye.

1910
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,828
Oh I'm sorry.

1911
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:18,125
Well we tried.

1912
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:20,874
You sang it beautifully, Gennie.

1913
01:42:20,885 --> 01:42:22,171
Boys, you did fine.

1914
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:23,589
Not a single mistake.

1915
01:42:23,596 --> 01:42:24,677
Thank you, Father.

1916
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,297
If that isn't good, I'll go
in the real estate business.

1917
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:28,765
I was going to ask you and the boys

1918
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,475
to sing a little more, but maybe

1919
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:33,221
you don't feel like it now.

1920
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,142
They sing divinely.

1921
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:37,937
And they look like Botticelli's angels.

1922
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:40,310
Maybe a little something huh?

1923
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:43,029
What do you think
they'd like to hear boys?

1924
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:43,865
The Mule.

1925
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:44,699
Hmm?

1926
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,533

1927
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:46,368

1928
01:42:46,369 --> 01:42:47,202
Yeah.

1929

1968
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:15,174
Did you hear that Timmy?

1969
01:45:15,184 --> 01:45:16,017
Max!

1970
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:19,807
You're a grand lad.

1971
01:45:19,814 --> 01:45:21,601
I knew your name wasn't
golden for nothing.

1972
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,153
Fellas, if you'll come to St. Dominic's

1973
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:29,566
tomorrow morning at 10:30...

1974
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:30,905
Church?

1975
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:32,240
Oh now Max, a day in church

1976
01:45:32,243 --> 01:45:33,950
isn't gonna hurt you that much.

1977
01:45:33,953 --> 01:45:35,660
Be there and bring the cash with you.

1978
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:38,280
Father O'Malley will tell
you how he wants it paid.

1979
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:39,701
An old man, very dear friend of

1980
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:41,745
Father O'Malley's, is involved in this.

1981
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:43,163
Father Fitzgibbon.

1982
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,911
It would make Father
O'Malley very happy if you

1983
01:45:44,922 --> 01:45:48,916
fellas would, you know,
just do this his way.

1984
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,828
Church.

1985
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:57,762
As you know, I've
been here for 45 years.

1986
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:01,303
46 in October.

1987
01:46:03,941 --> 01:46:08,857
And during that time, I've
always asked you to be generous.

1988
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:11,067
Which you have.

1989
01:46:11,073 --> 01:46:14,032
And now I have to ask you again.

1990
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:17,653
You all know how I feel
about St. Dominic's.

1991
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:21,952
Well we're in dire financial straits.

1992
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:26,832
So give what you can.

1993
01:46:26,839 --> 01:46:29,707
And I know, I know that whatever

1994
01:46:29,717 --> 01:46:32,835
you give, whether it's large or small,

1995
01:46:34,179 --> 01:46:37,343
the good Lord will bless you for it.

1996
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:40,467
In the name of the Father,
Son, the Holy Ghost.

1997
01:46:40,477 --> 01:46:41,477
Amen.

1998
01:47:42,665 --> 01:47:43,701
Gratifying.

1999
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:44,993
Very gratifying.

2000
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:47,997
And the bishop thought I couldn't preach.

2001
01:47:48,003 --> 01:47:50,245
Thought I had a mouthful of clover.

2002
01:47:50,255 --> 01:47:51,416
I wish he'd been here.

2003
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:52,584
Father, now that you're practically

2004
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:54,173
wallowing in wealth, you suppose

2005
01:47:54,176 --> 01:47:56,964
I could have a half a dollar?

2006
01:47:56,971 --> 01:47:58,303
What for, what for?

2007
01:47:58,305 --> 01:47:59,967
Well Father O'Dowd
and I thought, with your

2008
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:02,432
permission, we'd play
a little golf tomorrow.

2009
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:04,175
I need a new gold ball.

2010
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:07,395
If I lose it I'll swear off, I'll quit.

2011
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:08,855
Take 50 cents.

2012
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:11,816
No no no, take it out of the.

2013
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:13,355
They never keep any books.

2014
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:17,652
Suppose I could buy
Father O'Dowd one too?

2015
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,024
Must we?

2016
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:22,323
I can get two nice
repaints for 50 cents.

2017
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:23,991
Give him 50 cents.

2018
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:25,284
You oughta come along with us, Father.

2019
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:26,406
You don't have to play.

2020
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:27,749
Just go around.

2021
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:29,287
The fresh air will do you good.

2022
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:30,626
You can be our.

2023
01:48:30,629 --> 01:48:31,462
Your what?

2024
01:48:32,297 --> 01:48:33,458
What's...

2025
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:35,798
Sorta an over the shoulder quarterback.

2026
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:38,550
Will you come?

2027
01:48:38,554 --> 01:48:40,637
Well a little fresh
air might do me good.

2028
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:41,800
We'll get a ball for you too.

2029
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:42,807
Of course.

2030
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:54,435
Plenty
mushrooms around here.

2031
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:08,449
Well now where did that go?

2032
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:10,246
Right there.

2033
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,879
Now let me understand.

2034
01:49:18,886 --> 01:49:21,424
If you get the ball in the hole

2035
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:23,422
in this hit, then Father O'Dowd...

2036
01:49:23,432 --> 01:49:24,639
I win.

2037
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:26,974
So you've gotta count
the number of blows.

2038
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:28,513
That's right Father.

2039
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,806
Step aside, he's gonna play now.

2040
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:30,813
Careful.

2041
01:49:53,128 --> 01:49:54,835
How many did you have?

2042
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:55,671
Three huh?

2043
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:56,672
How many?

2044
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:15,474
Well that's remarkable.

2045
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:16,645
Remarkable.

2046
01:50:16,652 --> 01:50:17,984
Can you do that every time?

2047
01:50:17,986 --> 01:50:19,852
Oh I've been known to miss, Father.

2048
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:22,150
A strong crosswind or something.

2049
01:50:22,157 --> 01:50:23,989
Here, give me a hold of that.

2050
01:50:23,992 --> 01:50:24,826
You wanna try it?

2051
01:50:24,827 --> 01:50:25,827
Yeah.

2052
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:29,036
Better throw a ball in there for you.

2053
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:30,405
There you are.

2054
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:31,997
Keep your head down now, Father.

2055
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,616
Watch your language.

2056
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:56,564
Father, you holed out!

2057
01:50:56,567 --> 01:50:57,853
Not bad for a beginner huh?

2058
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,396
Oh you've played before.

2059
01:50:59,403 --> 01:51:00,644
Oh no no, believe me, that's the

2060
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:04,022
first time I ever had a caddy in me hand.

2061
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:07,742
Well you better play
in our watch then huh?

2062
01:52:18,941 --> 01:52:22,434
Well I guess I better be going.

2063
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:24,026
Let that be a lesson to you, Father.

2064
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:25,440
Don't trust anyone.

2065
01:52:33,163 --> 01:52:35,701
What an extraordinary person.

2066
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:37,583
Isn't he?

2067
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:44,873
Well I'll sleep well tonight anyway.

2068
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:48,968
It must be that golf.

2069
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:55,475
you know, I
feel 10 years younger.

2070
01:52:55,811 --> 01:52:57,347
You know I was thinking Father,

2071
01:52:57,354 --> 01:53:00,062
now that everything is going so right,

2072
01:53:00,065 --> 01:53:02,022
before something goes wrong,

2073
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:04,108
you oughta take a little time off.

2074
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:05,818
To do what for instance?

2075
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:07,687
Well like for instance take

2076
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:10,611
a trip home and see your mother.

2077
01:53:10,617 --> 01:53:13,701
Interest is all paid up to date.

2078
01:53:13,704 --> 01:53:15,320
If something goes wrong, I have plans

2079
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:19,165
that'll take care of the next payment.

2080
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:22,410
You really think it would be all right?

2081
01:53:22,421 --> 01:53:24,162
I mean it would yeah?

2082
01:53:24,172 --> 01:53:26,255
Father Fitzgibbon,
Chuck, the church is afire!

2083
01:53:56,788 --> 01:53:58,575
Don't worry, Father.

2084
01:53:58,582 --> 01:54:00,039
We'll build again.

2085
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:12,051
Can I help you Father?

2086
01:54:12,054 --> 01:54:14,922
No, it's all right, I can manage.

2087
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:19,054
This is for the birds.

2088
01:54:27,486 --> 01:54:29,773
They're used to coming here.

2089
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,231
I don't want them to go away.

2090
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:34,241
No.

2091
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:36,826
Oh you see Father?

2092
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:37,661
They're not leaving.

2093
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:39,449
Nobody's leaving here.

2094
01:54:40,957 --> 01:54:44,291
And when your church is
rebuilt, they'll all be back.

2095
01:54:44,294 --> 01:54:45,785
Everyone will be back.

2096
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:47,003
In the meantime you can send

2097
01:54:47,005 --> 01:54:49,748
your congregation over to my parish.

2098
01:54:49,758 --> 01:54:53,126
I'll split the collection with you 50/50.

2099
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:54,422
Take it, Father.

2100
01:54:56,598 --> 01:54:58,214
What makes you all so hopeful

2101
01:54:58,225 --> 01:55:01,514
that the church will ever be rebuilt?

2102
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:08,853
Here, you're supposed to take this.

2103
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:09,976
No, no I cannot.

2104
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:11,568
Come on, please Father, take it.

2105
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:12,488
I tell you what, if you'll

2106
01:55:12,489 --> 01:55:14,697
take it I'll take some too.

2107
01:55:16,243 --> 01:55:18,235
There, now that wasn't so bad.

2108
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:19,781
Don't you try it.

2109
01:55:20,705 --> 01:55:22,571
Doctors, medicine, feh.

2110
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:25,241
What I need is to be up and about.

2111
01:55:25,252 --> 01:55:26,538
Being up and about
is what's got you down,

2112
01:55:26,545 --> 01:55:28,127
tramping all over the parish trying

2113
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:30,213
to raise funds, and how
much did you collect?

2114
01:55:30,215 --> 01:55:33,834
There's no need for you to rub it in.

2115
01:55:33,844 --> 01:55:35,426
$35.85.

2116
01:55:35,429 --> 01:55:37,011
Yeah.

2117
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:38,504
How much is the doctor's bill?

2118
01:55:38,515 --> 01:55:39,515
40.

2119
01:55:40,434 --> 01:55:41,766
Says here to take two now, we wanna

2120
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:42,929
get our money's worth, here.

2121
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:44,723
Now listen, there's nothing in that

2122
01:55:44,729 --> 01:55:46,766
bottle that's going to do me any good.

2123
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:49,561
Oh Father, now you're not
gonna lose hope are you?

2124
01:55:49,568 --> 01:55:50,568
Hope?

2125
01:55:53,447 --> 01:55:55,564
You know Chuck, when
you're young it's easy

2126
01:55:55,574 --> 01:55:59,067
to keep the fires of hope burning bright.

2127
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:01,194
But at my age you're lucky if

2128
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:03,742
the pilot light doesn't go out.

2129
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,667
I know, Father.

2130
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:11,458
45 years of your efforts in ashes.

2131
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:14,335
Here, take this.

2132
01:56:19,181 --> 01:56:21,343
That'll keep the pilot light burning.

2133
01:56:21,349 --> 01:56:22,510
Yes, it ought to.

2134
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:24,133
Tastes like it had kerosene in it.

2135
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,596
Well did you make your parish calls?

2136
01:56:28,607 --> 01:56:29,643
Oh yes.

2137
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:32,517
Mrs. McGonagall's rheumatism
is kicking up again.

2138
01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:35,065
I told her to bury a
potato out in the backyard.

2139
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,278
That's for warts.

2140
01:56:36,281 --> 01:56:37,647
That's what she said.

2141
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:40,195
And I heard Mrs. Quimp's new gossip.

2142
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:41,363
Oh what else?

2143
01:56:41,369 --> 01:56:44,828
And then I went to see
Carol and Mr. Haines.

2144
01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:46,572
Oh, did they hear from young Ted?

2145
01:56:46,583 --> 01:56:48,825
Young Ted has been wounded in Africa.

2146
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:49,996
Ah, too bad.

2147
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:51,869
They're shipping him home.

2148
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,623
Find upstanding young fella.

2149
01:56:54,633 --> 01:56:56,374
Maybe they'll decorate him.

2150
01:56:56,384 --> 01:56:58,250
No, I doubt it.

2151
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:01,754
Some friend of his ran over him in a jeep.

2152
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:03,882
But I got some good news.

2153
01:57:03,892 --> 01:57:05,724
I have a letter from Miss Linden.

2154
01:57:05,727 --> 01:57:08,185
Miss Linden, well now, that's very nice.

2155
01:57:08,188 --> 01:57:09,104
Where is she?

2156
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:11,347
She's in St. Louis.

2157
01:57:11,358 --> 01:57:12,644
And here it comes Father, I gave you

2158
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:14,984
that medicine to quiet your nerves.

2159
01:57:14,986 --> 01:57:16,522
Tony and the boys are with her.

2160
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:17,862
They're on a concert tour.

2161
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:18,945
They're on a what?

2162
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:20,360
Now I had their parents' consent

2163
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:21,903
and they'll be back in time for school.

2164
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:22,743
But you...

2165
01:57:22,744 --> 01:57:25,077
Besides, travel's a great education.

2166
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,116
If they make enough money it's

2167
01:57:26,122 --> 01:57:28,364
gonna build you a new church.

2168
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:32,585
Not much of one maybe, but
something to go on with.

2169
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:36,164
Miss Linden sent you a check.

2170
01:57:36,174 --> 01:57:37,290
With her love.

2171
01:57:42,347 --> 01:57:43,347
$3,500.

2172
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:47,217
How's the pilot light burning now?

2173
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:49,093
It's burning brighter, Chuck.

2174
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:51,517
It's a long road back,
but we've started huh?

2175
01:57:51,523 --> 01:57:54,687
You know, I have a feeling
the dawn may rise again.

2176
01:57:54,693 --> 01:57:56,650
Sure it'll rise again.

2177
01:57:58,154 --> 01:58:00,111
You know, I think I'll get up meself.

2178
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:02,607
No no, now you better stay
there and get some rest.

2179
01:58:02,617 --> 01:58:04,404
Rest, you're well, but not that good.

2180
01:58:04,411 --> 01:58:06,869
You don't feel near that good.

2181
01:58:08,164 --> 01:58:10,030
Hey now boys, boys, boys!

2182
01:58:10,041 --> 01:58:11,907
Go on, go on home, go
on away with you now,

2183
01:58:11,918 --> 01:58:13,910
your dinner's ready, go on go on go on.

2184
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,867
Bye Father.

2185
01:58:24,723 --> 01:58:26,555
Goodnight.

2186
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:27,969
Fine girl, Miss Linden.

2187
01:58:27,976 --> 01:58:30,764
Very thoughtful, very generous.

2188
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:34,229
Close this up, keep the sawdust out hmm?

2189
01:58:37,736 --> 01:58:40,729
That will lend beauty to the dedication.

2190
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:43,072
And at Christmas you and
the choir will be able to...

2191
01:58:43,074 --> 01:58:44,940
Father, I won't be here at Christmas.

2192
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:45,987
Huh?

2193
01:58:45,994 --> 01:58:48,657
Well I was with the
bishop this afternoon.

2194
01:58:48,663 --> 01:58:51,872
He's transferring me to another parish.

2195
01:58:53,501 --> 01:58:55,493
You're leaving me.

2196
01:58:55,503 --> 01:58:59,042
Well now it never occurred
to me that someday you might.

2197
01:58:59,049 --> 01:59:02,759
But me boy, what am I
going to do without you?

2198
01:59:02,761 --> 01:59:03,877
You didn't ask to?

2199
01:59:03,887 --> 01:59:05,423
Oh no Father, as a matter of fact

2200
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:07,513
I asked to stay with you, but the bishop

2201
01:59:07,515 --> 01:59:10,804
asked me to help him out and I...

2202
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:12,767
St. Dominic's, what's going to happen?

2203
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:14,637
Well you'll be all right, Father.

2204
01:59:14,648 --> 01:59:15,764
I wish you could've heard some of

2205
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:17,140
the things the bishop said about you.

2206
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,357
Would've done you good.

2207
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,101
Says you're looking 10 years younger.

2208
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:22,603
He has all the confidence
in the world in you.

2209
01:59:22,614 --> 01:59:25,072
And don't worry, you'll
have a new assistant

2210
01:59:25,075 --> 01:59:26,987
Well now I want you
wish you all the success

2211
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:30,031
in the world, which I know you'll have.

2212
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:32,371
Is it a perish of your own?

2213
01:59:32,374 --> 01:59:34,866
Well no, not exactly Father,

2214
01:59:34,876 --> 01:59:37,584
you see this church, St. Charles,

2215
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:40,712
well the pastor's getting along

2216
01:59:40,715 --> 01:59:42,206
in years and things aren't...

2217
01:59:42,217 --> 01:59:44,300
You mean they're in trouble.

2218
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:48,342
Yes, and I'm supposed to go
in there and try and help...

2219
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:50,681
You mean without both of their knowing.

2220
01:59:50,684 --> 01:59:51,684
Uh-huh.

2221
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:55,554
Well now that's a difficult assignment.

2222
01:59:55,563 --> 01:59:57,555
But it'll work out.

2223
01:59:57,565 --> 02:00:00,683
You may have trouble with
the old man at first.

2224
02:00:00,694 --> 02:00:04,358
He may be running off to the
bishop every few minutes.

2225
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:06,947
But don't let that bother you.

2226
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:08,942
You'll bring him around
to your way of thinking.

2227
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:12,494
Well there's dinner.

2228
02:00:12,497 --> 02:00:16,241
You'll know how to manage
these old fuss buckets.

2229
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:17,708
Take them out in the golf course.

2230
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:18,918
Bring them out in the fresh air.

2231
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:19,753
Yeah.

2232
02:00:19,754 --> 02:00:22,997
We'll get along just so he...

2233
02:00:23,007 --> 02:00:24,794
Knows enough to come in out of the rain.

2234
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:25,634
That's it.

2235
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:28,594
That's it Father, that's it exactly.

2236
02:00:37,647 --> 02:00:39,559
Come in, Tony.

2237
02:00:39,566 --> 02:00:40,482
Hi Father.

2238
02:00:40,483 --> 02:00:41,599
So you're really leaving us huh?

2239
02:00:41,609 --> 02:00:43,350
Yes, I've got my orders Tony.

2240
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:44,319
I guess when the bishop says

2241
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,652
you gotta go, you gotta go.

2242
02:00:45,655 --> 02:00:46,613
That ain't hay huh?

2243
02:00:46,614 --> 02:00:47,573
That's right Tony.

2244
02:00:47,574 --> 02:00:49,657
You know, sometimes I
think I don't like bishops.

2245
02:00:49,659 --> 02:00:51,776
Well Tony, bishops are like umpires.

2246
02:00:51,786 --> 02:00:53,948
You have to have them to
call the close decisions.

2247
02:00:53,955 --> 02:00:54,788
Really?

2248
02:00:54,789 --> 02:00:57,623
Say, I got a little
Christmas present here for you.

2249
02:00:57,625 --> 02:00:59,912
I want you to take my
place with the choir.

2250
02:00:59,919 --> 02:01:02,036
From now on, you're in charge.

2251
02:01:02,046 --> 02:01:03,253
That's swell of you, Father.

2252
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:04,372
It's a great present.

2253
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:05,543
I always had my eye on it.

2254
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:06,508
I thought you did.

2255
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:08,341
Say, when you gonna give
Father Fitzgibbon his surprise?

2256
02:01:08,344 --> 02:01:10,256
Shhh, not so loud.

2257
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:11,629
Later on in the church.

2258
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:12,598
Those boys haven't told anyone?

2259
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:13,599
Not a word Father, not a word,

2260
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:15,091
and if they did I'd kick, er,

2261
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:16,512
I mean I'd be disappointed in them.

2262
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,761
Well I guess I'll get going, Father.

2263
02:01:18,772 --> 02:01:19,730
I know there's a lot on your mind,

2264
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:20,938
you wanted to tell me about taking

2265
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,977
your place with the gang and everything.

2266
02:01:22,984 --> 02:01:24,270
But I'll make it easy for you.

2267
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:25,563
I'll be everything you want me to be.

2268
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:27,152
Just as if you were
here checking up on me.

2269
02:01:27,155 --> 02:01:28,316
And if you don't, I'm gonna

2270
02:01:28,323 --> 02:01:29,655
drop you like you was a hot potato.

2271
02:01:29,657 --> 02:01:30,738
Okay Father, it's a deal.

2272
02:01:30,742 --> 02:01:31,575
Good luck to you.

2273
02:01:31,576 --> 02:01:32,409
Good luck to you.

2274
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:33,446
So long, Father.

2275
02:01:33,453 --> 02:01:34,453
So long.

2276
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:08,731
Pretty near Christmas.

2277
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:09,738
Yeah.

2278
02:02:35,807 --> 02:02:37,924
I'm sure that the way to say what I'd like

2279
02:02:37,934 --> 02:02:41,393
to say will occur to me after you've gone.

2280
02:02:43,064 --> 02:02:45,772
We're separated by many
years, Father O'Malley.

2281
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:47,357
Which could be the reason why we haven't

2282
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:50,148
seen eye to eye in many instances.

2283
02:02:51,823 --> 02:02:53,735
But though we've had many differences,

2284
02:02:53,741 --> 02:02:56,233
we never differed in fundamentals.

2285
02:02:56,244 --> 02:02:58,201
It was only in method.

2286
02:02:58,204 --> 02:03:00,321
But never in our hearts.

2287
02:03:09,757 --> 02:03:10,716
Good stuff huh?

2288
02:03:10,717 --> 02:03:11,717
Oh yes.

2289
02:03:12,635 --> 02:03:13,552
Bye Ted.

2290
02:03:13,553 --> 02:03:14,553
Bye Father.

2291
02:03:14,554 --> 02:03:16,261
Bye Carol.

2292
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:17,846
Right man did come along.

2293
02:03:17,849 --> 02:03:20,091
Yes, but not past our house.

2294
02:03:20,101 --> 02:03:21,888
Stubborn huh?

2295
02:03:21,895 --> 02:03:22,895
Goodbye, Mr. Haines.

2296
02:03:22,896 --> 02:03:23,896
Father.

2297
02:03:26,524 --> 02:03:28,436
Pardon me, Mr. Haines.

2298
02:03:28,443 --> 02:03:30,059
I've just left the bishop.

2299
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:32,402
He told me to report to Father Fitzgibbon.

2300
02:03:32,405 --> 02:03:33,771
I'm taking your place.

2301
02:03:33,781 --> 02:03:34,988
I'm the new curate.

2302
02:03:36,451 --> 02:03:37,908
Come on, come on,
you've very little time.

2303
02:03:37,911 --> 02:03:39,493
They're waiting in the
church to say goodbye.

2304
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:40,454
All right Father, I've been

2305
02:03:40,455 --> 02:03:41,821
doing you a lot of good here.

2306
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:43,367
You're gonna have a new
church after the war.

2307
02:03:43,374 --> 02:03:44,910
Yes, but we didn't raise enough money.

2308
02:03:44,918 --> 02:03:45,999
That's just it.

2309
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:47,584
Mr. Haines is gonna give us a mortgage.

2310
02:03:47,587 --> 02:03:48,623
Take care of the difference.

2311
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:49,630
That's right, Father.

2312
02:03:49,631 --> 02:03:51,167
He convinced me I have a heart.

2313
02:03:51,174 --> 02:03:52,090
And after all, it wouldn't be

2314
02:03:52,091 --> 02:03:53,252
a church without a mortgage.

2315
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:54,340
That's right, that's right.

2316
02:03:54,344 --> 02:03:55,344
He's a wonder.

2317
02:03:55,345 --> 02:03:57,211
I don't know what I'm
going to do without him.

2318
02:03:57,221 --> 02:03:58,462
I don't know who the bishop is going

2319
02:03:58,473 --> 02:04:00,886
to send in his place, but whoever he is...

2320
02:04:00,892 --> 02:04:02,349
Father.

2321
02:04:02,352 --> 02:04:07,313
Right behind
you, Father O'Dowd.

2322
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:10,065
Congratulations to you, Father.

2323
02:04:12,445 --> 02:04:14,357
The bishop wouldn't do that to me again.

2324
02:04:14,364 --> 02:04:15,900
Yes he's done it.

2325
02:04:17,075 --> 02:04:18,361
Mr. Haines.

2326
02:04:18,368 --> 02:04:20,155
Nice of you to give that
mortgage to the church.

2327
02:04:20,161 --> 02:04:21,119
Oh not a problem.

2328
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,659
Can't tell you how
much we appreciate it.

2329
02:04:30,838 --> 02:04:35,378
As you know, we're all
going to miss Father O'Malley.

2330
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:40,341
He was a fine man.

2331
02:04:42,767 --> 02:04:44,633
This is Father O'Malley.

2332
02:04:44,644 --> 02:04:46,306
The man who sent for you.

2333
02:04:46,312 --> 02:04:48,224
How do you do, Mrs. Fitzgibbon?

2334
02:04:48,231 --> 02:04:49,813
I've heard so much about you.

2335
02:04:49,816 --> 02:04:51,182
Now it's good to see you.

2336
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:52,603
I think you'll agree with me that we're

2337
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:55,478
all a little better for having known him.

2338
02:04:55,488 --> 02:04:58,526
He was always thinking of others.

2339
02:04:58,533 --> 02:05:01,446
And that, you know, can
make life very beautiful.

2340
02:05:01,452 --> 02:05:05,571
Believe me, it's what
we do for others that...
