1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:07,299


2
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:35,929
<i>In Washington, high-ranking Navy and
Army officers meet in closed conference.</i>

3
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,477
<i>After months of secret preparations...</i>

4
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:47,608
<i>... a far-reaching, combined operation
is about to begin.</i>

5
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,033
<i>Continued secrecy is imperative...</i>

6
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,078
<i>... for the plan 's success.</i>

7
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,891
We've cornered the chili sauce market
for you, sir.

8
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,435
Good work, Cookie.
Got steaks to go with it?

9
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,562
Yes, sir.

10
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,731
Captain, last torpedo's on board.

11
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,817
- Right. I'll be at the dock phone.
- Aye, aye, sir.

12
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,749
Any luck on that Oklahoma City call?

13
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,503
Sorry, Captain Cassidy, I haven't
gotten through to your wife.

14
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,755
<i>You know how it is. Christmas Eve.</i>

15
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,550
Yes, I know how it is.

16
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,012
Thank you. Cancel the call.

17
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,614
Hi, Rocky. That kid of yours
been born yet?

18
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,743
- Yes, sir. It's a boy.
- What, no cigar?

19
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,789
- Congratulations, Rocky.
- Thank you, sir.

20
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,587
- Captain.
- What, Sparks?

21
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:59,508
- I got the record changer all hooked up.
- So I hear.

22
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,469
The crew certainly does appreciate
your gift, sir.

23
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:07,057
Well, after five patrols,
I appreciate my crew, Sparks.

24
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,620
Full fuel, lube, oil, battery
and fresh water.

25
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,039
Engineering department
ready for sea, sir.

26
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,168
Request permission to warm up
the main engine.

27
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,296
- Okay, Larry.
- Thank you, sir.

28
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:42,217
<i>Sweetheart, we're shoving off
ahead of schedule.</i>

29
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,678
<i>Something urgent.</i>

30
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,681
<i>I tried to telephone you
and the children...</i>

31
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,100
<i>... to wish you a merry Christmas...</i>

32
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:55,272
<i>... and to tell you I'm now wearing
three stripes on my sleeve...</i>

33
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,195
<i>... and some embarrassingly shiny
scrambled eggs on my cap.</i>

34
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,531
<i>I hope you like
the nylon stockings, darling.</i>

35
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,534
<i>Don 't ask me how I got them.</i>

36
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,623
<i>Tell Michael I couldn 't find
a toy submarine.</i>

37
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,460
<i>Tell him it's the war.
He'll understand.</i>

38
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:20,506
<i>There's even a shortage of teddy bears,
but I found one for Debby.</i>

39
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:26,553
<i>I hope her chickenpox didn 't leave
any marks on that sweet face.</i>

40
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,476
Full torpedoes onboard.
All tubes loaded and ready for war shot.

41
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,187
Full ammunition and pyrotechnics
onboard.

42
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,440
- Gunnery department ready for sea, sir.
- Very well, Pete.

43
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,401
- Send in the mail orderly, please.
- Aye, aye, sir.

44
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:47,366
<i>I've got the same good crew.
A few new men from sub school.</i>

45
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,701
<i>If we were together tonight, darling...</i>

46
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,585
- Mail orderly, captain.
- Mail this before we shove off.

47
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,754
Aye, aye, sir.

48
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,924
All hands aboard. All departments
ready for sea.

49
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,009
Secured quarters.

50
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,682
They won't kick you upstairs.

51
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,685
- You're too valuable at sea.
- Who's kidding who?

52
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,688
I'll be fighting from a desk
after this patrol, Andy.

53
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,151
Gather around, men.

54
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,950
I'm sorry your liberty was cut short.

55
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:35,289
The Navy would've let us have Christmas
ashore if this wasn't important.

56
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,917
The men who've been with me know
I don't believe in fight talks.

57
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,129
When a man gives a fight talk,
he needs one himself.

58
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,883
For the benefit of newcomers,
you're here because you volunteered.

59
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:50,220
You're well-trained, highly selected men,
and we're glad to have you aboard.

60
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,890
You may be infants in
the submarine service...

61
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,185
...but you'll be veterans
by the time we make port again.

62
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,187
We've had pretty fair luck so far.

63
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,315
Let's hope we really smear them
this time.

64
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,735
- Dismiss the crew.
- Aye, aye, sir.

65
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,612
Leave your quarters.

66
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:16,747
Shore connection is clear. Topside
secured, all except mooring lines.

67
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,249
Okay, chief.

68
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,212
All tested out. Ship ready
for getting under way, sir.

69
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,881
Number one and two
main engines on propulsion.

70
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,592
Okay, let's go.

71
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,594
Single up!

72
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,349
Answer bells.

73
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,518
Take in one!

74
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,646
Pull five! Port, back one-third.

75
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,193
Port, stop.

76
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,820
Take in five!

77
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,491
All ahead one-third.

78
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,724
- Hatch secured.
- Report, forward room rigged for diving.

79
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,104
What do you think you are?
The pipes of Pan?

80
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,398
This, Dakota, is a genuine Nazi flute.

81
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,568
- I paid an Atlantic sailor 5 bucks for it.
- Nazi flute?

82
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,987
You can get them in Frisco for four bits.

83
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,073
- You know of Tarpon Springs, Florida?
- Sure.

84
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,575
- You do?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,911
The best fishermen in the world
are the Greeks, my people.

86
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,413
You're Greek?

87
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,456
- Greek-American.
- What's your name?

88
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:45,043
Leos Deopoulis Gurfelis Junior.
That "junior" is pure American.

89
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,214
But seeing you're off a destroyer
we'll settle for "Tin Can." Okay?

90
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,302
Okay, just so long as nobody
around here calls me "Hey, Greek."

91
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,721
- I'm sensitive.
- Oh, Mike.

92
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,724
Surprise.

93
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,811
Here's that 5-spot I borrowed.

94
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:07,399
- Fine time to pay me back.
- But I did pay you.

95
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:12,487
There goes one of the nicest guys
that ever borrowed 5 bucks from me.

96
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,616
Why doesn't the captain
wear his decorations?

97
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,952
- Doesn't need to.
- We heard a lot about him at sub school.

98
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,288
You can believe anything that was good.

99
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:25,709
Those torpedoes cost 12,000 bucks
apiece. Our skipper doesn't waste them.

100
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:29,630
He's got more plain intestinal fortitude
than any guy I ever met.

101
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,299
I'd follow him right into
the mikado's bathtub.

102
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,218
Do you think we'll see action?

103
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,803
Good. That's why I got off
that four-stacker.

104
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,848
Up and down, nothing but escorting.
Made me sick.

105
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,684
- Sitting on a beehive?
- I know. He wants a medal.

106
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,479
Who cares about medals?
I got a better reason.

107
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,148
Pipe down. Look.

108
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:53,570
In all my 12 years in the Navy,
I never seen a doll on a submarine.

109
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,825
I won her, Mike. Cute, huh?

110
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,079
- She gonna bunk with you?
- Yep.

111
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,581
She's a liberty gimmick.
Makes gals jealous.

112
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,291
- Jealous of that doll?
- Sure.

113
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,877
I take her into a joint, sit her on a table.

114
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,630
Then we have a long talk.
It never fails.

115
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,675
Dame comes up and says,
"That's the best you can do?"

116
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,802
I says, "That's up to you, honey."

117
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,847
What happens then?

118
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,558
- How old are you, Tommy?
- Nineteen.

119
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,810
Come back next year.

120
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,106
Say, that's a cute military objective
you got there.

121
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,694
- That's my sister.
- Oh, intelligent too.

122
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:38,866
Well, if you boys don't mind, Nita and I,
we want to be alone, don't we?

123
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:43,704
See? It's cute. I told you.
You know, it works all the time.

124
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,301
Passed the submarine net, captain.

125
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:03,473
Well, Andy, it'll be a long time
between beers.

126
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,251
Merry Christmas, Mike.

127
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,217
Merry Christmas, Tommy.

128
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,849
This is the first Christmas
I ever spent underwater.

129
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,520
You should have been aboard with us
Christmas Day 1941.

130
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,272
The Japs sure gave us
a Christmas present.

131
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,151
Blasted the living daylights out of us
off Lingayen Gulf.

132
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,780
Between depth charges,
we ate Christmas dinner in the dark...

133
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,492
...200 feet down.
Ice water and sandwiches.

134
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:10,123
Well-sprinkled with rust and chips of
paint that kept flying off the bulkheads.

135
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,672
- Bet you said your prayers.
- I sure did. Some extra Hail Marys too.

136
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,133
- You think prayers do any good, Mike?
- Sure, they do.

137
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,262
Some guys say, "Go ahead, prove to me
there's a God."

138
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:28,350
I don't argue. I just know,
like I know there's salt in the sea.

139
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,477
That's the way it is with me too.

140
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:35,440
Look, Mike, if we get depth-charged,
and I show any signs of being yellow...

141
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,068
...you sock me.
- Right on the button.

142
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,947
- That's a promise?
- It's a promise.

143
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,825
If I were in Connecticut now...

144
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,662
...Mother and Dad would come in
to wake me singing Christmas carols.

145
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,790
It's sort of a custom they started
when I was a kid.

146
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,758
Pretty, ain't it?
Those guys practice all year for this.

147
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,386
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, you guys!

148
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,638
- Merry Christmas, Tin Can!
- Happy Noel.

149
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,307
Same to you and many more.

150
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,359
Merry Christmas, skipper.

151
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,820
Merry Christmas, fellas.

152
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,947
Merry Christmas, skipper.

153
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,734
And a very merry Christmas
to you gents.

154
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,779
We'll have to top the diesels.

155
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,193
Hey, get a load of him, will you?

156
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,032
Presents.

157
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,581
"For Pills, the pharmacist's mate,
a mournful knell.

158
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:59,376
He dropped his vitamins
down the periscope well."

159
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,461
So, what do you got?

160
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,007
"The new kid forward
is wiser but sadder.

161
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,468
Since he stepped on the skipper
coming down the ladder!"

162
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,971
I apologized.

163
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,099
"On Wolf's grave, a wreath is laid.

164
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:18,270
Since he tangled his line
with that chambermaid."

165
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,938
- Come on, open it.
- Open it!

166
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,159
You should have had it filled.

167
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:35,662
"All hands get ready
to upchuck this dinner.

168
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,333
With Cookie in the galley,
we're going to get thinner."

169
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,337
Fine, listen.

170
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:47,674
If that ain't a new high
for gratitude.

171
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,136
Who practically mothers
all the guys on this ship?

172
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,846
I do.

173
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,433
Who bends over a hot stove
all day long for you guys?

174
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,935
I do.

175
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,522
Who's going to get all the glory
when you sink a Jap ship?

176
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,482
You! That's who.

177
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,401
Who's gonna get the medals
from this war? You guys!

178
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:12,199
And what am I going to get? Nothing but
varicose veins and dishwater hands!

179
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,535
Open it! Open it!

180
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,329
What have you got? Open it.

181
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,930
Gee, guys.

182
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,475
You shouldn't have done it.

183
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,730
Lookouts to the bridge.

184
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,399
Keep your eyes peeled, kid.

185
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,527
All submarines look alike.
We're nobody's friend.

186
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:52,739
Even our ships will shoot first
and ask questions afterward.

187
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,076
He listens to you like you were
a tin god.

188
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,760
- Look pretty snappy today, captain.
- You know, Christmas.

189
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,813
- Coffee, sir.
- Thank you.

190
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,359
- All clear starboard.
- All clear port.

191
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,613
You fellas know me.
I'm no highbrow.

192
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,782
When I come home, if there's
any grand opera playing...

193
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,661
...the whole Connors family goes
down there twice a week.

194
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:43,290
Don't ask me why, but to me, it's like
going down in a sub.

195
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,627
You shove off,
go deep under the sea.

196
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,128
When you come back up...

197
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,507
...you got something inside
that's never been there before.

198
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,675
Irish and Greeks, born philosophers.

199
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,260
I got a philosophy too.

200
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,847
Every day a box of Cracker Jacks
with a prize in every package.

201
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,975
I feel sorry for you.
You don't know what family means.

202
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,479
Family means a house has a mortgage,
the kids have measles...

203
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,816
...and the old man pays for the insurance
when he's dead. No, not for Wolfie.

204
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,819
The only babies I want
are those born 21 years ago.

205
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,657
<i>Captain has given permission to pick up
the San Francisco newscast.</i>

206
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,494
<i>This broadcast comes to you
from the Friendly Credit Company.</i>

207
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:25,999
<i>The Friendly Credit Company trusts you.
Any amount from $ 25 to $ 1000.</i>

208
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,254
<i>And so Christmas Day
is bright on all fronts.</i>

209
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,007
<i>San Francisco police are continuing
the manhunt for a sailor...</i>

210
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,134
<i>... wanted on several counts.</i>

211
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:39,388
<i>The woman making the complaints
insists on prosecution.</i>

212
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:43,851
<i>The sailor was last seen boarding a
United States submarine at Mare Island.</i>

213
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:48,522
<i>The sailor is known to the girls
only as "Wolf."</i>

214
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:52,401
- Well, Wolfie!
- Shut up.

215
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,988
However, his shipmates volunteered
information to the police.

216
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,533
Enough to send him up for 1042 years.

217
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:04,454
The Wolf has been described as a body
of man entirely surrounded by women.

218
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,956
- He's...
- Terrific!

219
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,624
Terrific.

220
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,088
It's just a gag, Wolfie. Just a gag.

221
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,258
Captain give you permission
to pull that stunt?

222
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,887
- Yes, sir.
- I was in on the gag too.

223
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,849
- Were you?
- Well, just around the edges.

224
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:34,943
- Plane coming in at the sun!
- Clear the bridge! Take her down!

225
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,631
- Hatch secured!
- Battle stations manned.

226
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,674
Main induction closed.

227
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,399
What was it?

228
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,944
Looked like a four-motor
bomber to me.

229
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,612
Pressure in the boat, sir.

230
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:32,209
Level off at 150 feet.

231
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,045
- Rig for depth charge.
- Rig for depth charge.

232
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,798
Close main vents.

233
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,883
Main vents closed, sir.

234
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,011
- Blow negative.
- Blow negative.

235
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,598
- Close negative flood.
- Close negative flood.

236
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,308
Negative flood closed, sir.

237
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,103
- Level off at 150.
- Level off at 150.

238
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,737
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble.

239
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,287
Open all vents.

240
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,170
- All ahead one-third.
- All ahead one-third.

241
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,256
All answering ahead one-third, sir.

242
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,925
- Pump from auxiliary to sea.
- Auxiliary to sea!

243
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,973
- Can we hear it when it comes?
- Yep, son.

244
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,100
We'll hear it, all right.

245
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:36,356
- Isn't there anything we can do?
- Yep. We're doing it.

246
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,695
Maybe it's one of our own planes.

247
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,698
If we sink, it doesn't matter
who drops the bombs.

248
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,180
Think they can see
our shadow from the air?

249
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,641
That's what we're finding out.

250
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,363
All clear, sir.

251
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,366
Let's go up for a look-see.
Periscope depth.

252
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,202
Periscope depth. Five degrees up angle.

253
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,705
- Twenty-degree rise on the bow planes.
- Five degrees up angle.

254
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:37,042
- Twenty-degree rise, sir.
- Take charge of your planes.

255
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,931
Up a foot.

256
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,151
Maybe that plane had feathers.

257
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:07,030
Looks as if we dunked
for a four-motored albatross.

258
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,492
Service, down scope.
Have a merry Christmas, men.

259
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:16,748
- Gee, fellas. I could have sworn...
- Albatross have retractable landing gear?

260
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,710
Lookouts to the bridge!

261
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:23,797
- You can hear that motor so plain!
- Key down. He feels bad enough.

262
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,155
Watch out, or they'll give you
an E for imagination.

263
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,282
Lay off him, Rocky.

264
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,783
That's all right, son.

265
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,787
I'd rather submerge for 100 birds
than not submerge for one plane.

266
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,207
Thank you, sir.

267
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:15,140
- All clear starboard.
- All clear port.

268
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,043
Hello, Andy.

269
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,463
Almost 24 hours out now, skipper.
About time to open orders?

270
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:49,049
Three minutes to go, Andy.

271
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:52,052
I got a hunch it's something big.

272
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:55,222
Last night, I dreamed
we upped periscope.

273
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:58,600
Right in the middle of
the entire Jap imperial fleet.

274
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,686
Passing in review.

275
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:04,314
- Did we sink them all?
- With one torpedo.

276
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,816
Billiard shot.

277
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,569
By the way, there's a man
from the forward room.

278
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:12,155
Wants to see you on a matter
of vital importance.

279
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:16,743
- Torpedoman Adams.
- Send him in.

280
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:27,796
I was told I'd have to ask you, sir.

281
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,092
Go ahead. Ask me.

282
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:36,180
Sir, at sub school, we saw a lot
of pictures of submariners...

283
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:40,017
...coming back from patrols with beards.

284
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:43,854
- So you want to grow one?
- Yes, sir.

285
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,984
- Think you can?
- Sir, I'd like to find out.

286
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,029
Well, I'll tell you, Adams.

287
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,657
First patrol, we all grew beards.
I had a pip.

288
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,784
The second patrol was
half and half.

289
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:01,788
Then we decided beards are itchy.
They get greasy. We keep a trim ship.

290
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,291
Makes sense we have a trim crew
to man her.

291
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,792
Yes, sir.

292
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,296
But I don't want to cheat you
of a beard on your first patrol.

293
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:12,883
Oh, that's all right, sir.
I only shave twice a week anyway.

294
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,469
If I could grow one,
it'd look a little limp.

295
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:19,264
I'll stick to shaving twice a week, sir.

296
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,768
Maybe when we get back,
you'll be shaving three times a week.

297
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,856
Thank you, sir. I guess I'd better
get back and do what I was doing.

298
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,983
Thank you.

299
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,028
Send the quartermaster
with the chart catalog.

300
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:18,740
Captain wants the chart catalog, Rocky.

301
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,789
- Chart catalog, sir.
- Thank you. Stand by.

302
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,459
- Has he come yet?
- No. He's still in there.

303
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:33,213
- Bring in chart 1291.
- Aye, aye, sir.

304
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:40,554
Just get out that old chart of Tahiti.
I got a tomato in Papeete.

305
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,182
Poetry.

306
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,282
Gonna write a letter
to your wife every night?

307
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:04,369
- Yep. Sort of keeps us in touch.
- Doesn't make sense if there's no mail.

308
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,371
Who knows? We might hit Australia.

309
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,999
Then again, we might not.

310
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,882
Funny thing about submarines.

311
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:20,552
The crew always knows where
we're going before the captain does.

312
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,736
Holy smoke! Tokyo?

313
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:40,572
I always wanted to see those geisha gals
up-close.

314
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,908
Too bad you didn't study
"Japany" lingo.

315
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:46,453
Listen, my kind of language
is international.

316
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,874
How are we going to get
into Tokyo Bay?

317
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,544
<i>The Copperfin just naturally
sprouts wings.</i>

318
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,963
We fly over the nets
and the minefields...

319
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,800
...plumb in the middle of the harbor.
- Tokyo Bay. Perfect.

320
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,469
Bet we sink 70,000 tons.
20 bucks, even money.

321
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:06,723
- Seventy thousand tons. You're nuts.
- Look, I got a reason to have luck.

322
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,976
Where I go, there's gonna be
dead Japs.

323
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,604
- What is this reason of yours?
- Never mind. Anybody wanna bet?

324
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,983
It's a secret between him and Roosevelt.
I'll take the bet.

325
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,151
I'll pay off double if we make it.

326
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:21,738
Only two guys whistle in the Navy.
Boatswain's mates and boots.

327
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,365
You a boatswain's mate?

328
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,034
I'm sorry, Mike. I forgot.

329
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,578
You hear that music?

330
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:31,123
- Reminds me of a dame I knew in Frisco.
- Here we go again.

331
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,251
She was built for speed,
like a destroyer.

332
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,880
- Oh, now I listen.
- Kind of compact too, like a submarine.

333
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:41,300
She was coming down Sutter Street.
Off my starboard beam.

334
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,510
<i>I sees her and says, "Up periscope."</i>

335
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:48,182
<i>I gives my motor a third back and
maneuvers for an opening shot.</i>

336
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,518
<i>She picks me up on her detector.</i>

337
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:55,439
<i>Gives her rudder a hard left.
Makes like she's looking in the window.</i>

338
00:30:55,772 --> 00:31:00,068
<i>Naturally, I gives my rudder
a hard right and moves...</i>

339
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:04,489
<i>... right up alongside her. She's beautiful.
But beautiful!</i>

340
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,034
<i>Comes up to about my chin.
Fits just right.</i>

341
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,204
Well, neither of us breaks silence.

342
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,541
Naturally, there's a long pause.
We're both running on batteries now.

343
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,377
Something electric is going on between
her and me.

344
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,880
I'd been on patrol three months.

345
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,882
And this was
my first night ashore.

346
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,051
Now, you guys know how it is.

347
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:29,056
There she was in a nice, clean, crisp,
lacy blouse.

348
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,684
And she looked
just like she had a bath.

349
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,728
So she looked like she had a bath.

350
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:37,564
She even smelled like geranium.

351
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,734
So she even smelled like geraniums.
Then what?

352
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:45,072
Here we are, hove to,
with her smelling like geraniums...

353
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,741
...and me with three months' pay
in my whites.

354
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,661
- I'll never forget it!
- Never forget what, Wolf?

355
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,330
Some dames have lips that
are curved all right.

356
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:57,668
But when you kiss them, you find they
have lips as hard as a warhead?

357
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:03,090
Well, you could tell hers
was as soft as silk.

358
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:07,594
Just enough lipstick. Just right.

359
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,806
Well, what did you do about it?

360
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:14,142
<i>I was so busy drinking her in
out of my starboard lamps...</i>

361
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:18,856
<i>... that I don 't see this Market Street
commando hove to alongside her.</i>

362
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,859
<i>I'm trying to get a recognition signal
out of her...</i>

363
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:24,361
<i>... when this sailor busts right in
and says:</i>

364
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,780
<i>"Would you like one
of those lacy things?"</i>

365
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,491
<i>She says, "Sure."
And they go in and buy one.</i>

366
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:32,411
<i>- Well, what did you do?
- Me? I'm murdered!</i>

367
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:37,207
<i>There I am, anchored,
dead in the water...</i>

368
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:40,127
<i>... looking in the window.
She's picking out one.</i>

369
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,964
<i>And this Market Street commando
is giving me the gloat!</i>

370
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,258
<i>Am I burnt. I'm dying!</i>

371
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:49,511
My first night in. There she'd been,
standing next to me.

372
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:52,639
- Smelling like geraniums.
- Okay, we been through that.

373
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:56,101
This Market Street commando peels
off some lettuce and pays.

374
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:59,104
And she's smiling
as sweet as a dream.

375
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:03,734
And there I am, outside the window,
bulkheads busted in.

376
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,320
<i>Next thing I know,
she gives this guy a kiss.</i>

377
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,656
<i>And the next thing I know,
she's making for my anchorage...</i>

378
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,951
<i>... with his stuff under her arm,
and she's saying to me:</i>

379
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:14,912
<i>"Going my way, submariner?"</i>

380
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,789
Then what happened, Wolf?

381
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:20,918
She was built for speed,
but like I said, kid...

382
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:25,422
...kind of compact too, like a submarine.

383
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:42,231
According to the orders, we're to pick
up the lieutenant here at point x-ray.

384
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,567
A PBY boat will meet us at 1430.

385
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,319
Why are they flying him down?

386
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,822
Save us going out of our way
to pick him up. Time's important.

387
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,867
- Who is he?
- Aerology specialist.

388
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,245
North Pacific area.

389
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,872
All we have to do
is put him ashore in Japan.

390
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,797
You are showing signs
of needing a sun lamp.

391
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:09,633
From now on, sign up.
Everybody, once a day.

392
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,303
- You ever want to be a real doctor, Pills?
- Yeah.

393
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,974
I was one of those wise guys
who didn't know where he was going.

394
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,309
Funny place to find out, on submarines.

395
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:22,437
- What college did you go to?
- California.

396
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:24,690
Only a year. Then I signed up.

397
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:28,193
I had an A in chemistry,
so they made me a pharmacist's mate.

398
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,779
Ain't it wonderful what
an education will do?

399
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,366
When I got out of third grade,
I took a job at Coney Island.

400
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,494
- Frying hot dogs.
- You should have stuck to hot dogs.

401
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,913
Where's that half-baked barber?

402
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,333
You finishing college
when the war's over?

403
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,044
Yep. Putting my pay
and a half in war bonds.

404
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,463
Working my way
through college underwater.

405
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:53,677
Pills, if anything happened
to us while we're out on patrol...

406
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:57,764
...if we got conked off, you figure
we'd see our folks in the hereafter?

407
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,933
I wouldn't bank on it.

408
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,354
My old man wouldn't be overjoyed to see
me. He never thought I was much good.

409
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,024
- I like to think we got souls...
- I don't know.

410
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:10,694
All those guys I cut up at school,
never found a soul inside.

411
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,738
Well, what does that prove, Pills?

412
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,781
Say you trust a guy.

413
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,534
You can't see the trust,
but it's there.

414
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:21,246
- I'm from Missouri, Mike.
- I'm not exactly religious.

415
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,582
- But don't you think God...
- No, I don't.

416
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:26,126
My angle is, I only believe
what I can see.

417
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,754
- Are you an atheist?
- Call it what you like.

418
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,882
The Japs turn the heat on us,
I'll watch you pray.

419
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,301
I've seen it happen before.

420
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,138
- Say, you guys know what?
- No, what?

421
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:42,643
There's something screwy
about this detour or whatever it is.

422
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:44,728
We'll know before long.

423
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:48,482
Hey, Yo Yo, mind if I use your office?
Something private.

424
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:51,026
- Sure.
- Thanks.

425
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,156
That's the third time
he's asked me.

426
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,075
Well, maybe he's writing poems.

427
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,744
There you are, my little scissorbill.

428
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:02,246
Get thee behind me.

429
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:05,624
Mind you, no politics, no ball games,
no hair down my neck.

430
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,334
Nothing but barbering.

431
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:13,048
Well, Cookie, looks like we're getting
pretty close to enemy waters.

432
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:16,176
Now, Tommy, don't go
getting yourself all worried.

433
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,388
Think we ought to take the hat off?

434
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,224
Well, don't you think we'd better?

435
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:28,021
- Clippers?
- Yes, thanks.

436
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:33,735
You see, Tommy, there's always
one of two things about a submarine.

437
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:38,282
In the first place, either the enemy
finds you, or he doesn't.

438
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:41,451
If he doesn't find you,
there's nothing to worry about.

439
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:45,581
But if he does, there is still
one of two things.

440
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:48,208
Either he drops a depth charge,
or he don't.

441
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,628
If he doesn't, there's nothing
to worry about. If he does...

442
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,964
...then there's still
one of two things.

443
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,466
Either he drops it
close to you or far away.

444
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:00,179
If he drops them far away,
it's foolish to worry.

445
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,847
If he drops them near you...

446
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:05,267
...then there is still one
of two things to worry about.

447
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:07,186
And that is...

448
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:10,105
Don't cut too much off.

449
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,899
If your pressure hull holds.

450
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:15,068
Of course, if it holds,
wouldn't it be foolish to worry?

451
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,238
If it doesn't, you won't be able
to worry, so why worry?

452
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,741
Are you through?

453
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,868
Yes.

454
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,917
He was worth waiting for.
He's a good barber. That looks fine.

455
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,418
You next?

456
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:50,270
One thousand fathoms, sir.

457
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:05,244
Rudder amidships. Steady on course.

458
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,372
- Two-nine-zero.
- Eight hundred fathoms.

459
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:17,965
Right, five degrees rudder.
New course, 295. All motors stop.

460
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:22,845
Right, five degrees rudder.
New course, 295. All motors stop.

461
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,388
Three hundred fathoms.

462
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,318
Stations for battle surface.

463
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,153
Stations for battle surface.

464
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,201
Ready on all main engines.

465
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:00,632
Down scope.

466
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,286
All engines, ahead one-third.

467
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,743
Has the radio man picked
up anything on the frequency?

468
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,120
Contact established, sir.

469
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,585
Plane to starboard, sir.

470
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,716
Hold your fire.

471
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,178
Stand by to challenge.

472
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:29,888
Okay, Rocky.

473
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:39,231
Challenge.

474
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,747
Plane answered challenge
correctly, captain.

475
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,292
All stop. Rudder amidships.

476
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:13,473
Always nice to see
those stars on the wing.

477
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:54,097
You know, I'd sure like
to hook an Aleutian salmon.

478
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:57,184
Cute if I opened him up,
and there was a Jap in there.

479
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:59,603
Fried Jap in tartar sauce.

480
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:02,064
I'll take mine boiled in oil.

481
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:09,196
I'll go down and get him.

482
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:27,297
Lieutenant Raymond. McCary.
Welcome aboard.

483
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,550
- Thank you.
- Come up, meet the captain.

484
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,051
Thanks.

485
00:42:58,203 --> 00:42:59,830
Lieutenant Raymond reporting.

486
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:02,416
- Glad to have you aboard.
- Glad to be aboard.

487
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,335
- Ready on one and two.
- You already know McCary.

488
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:07,671
- Yes, sir. We've met.
- How was your trip?

489
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,883
It was pretty rough.
Is my aerology gear aboard?

490
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:12,384
Under lock and key.

491
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:15,721
If you'll go below, we'll arrange
for your berthing later.

492
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,599
- I'd like to get this ship out of here.
- Yes, sir.

493
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:23,520
How do I get below? I've never
been aboard a submarine before.

494
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,774
There's the hatch. It goes down.

495
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:30,903
Yes, sir.

496
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:36,366
Hey! Bear a hand. I got a bite.

497
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:41,622
Planes approaching, dead astern!

498
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,251
Jap float Zeros.

499
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:48,754
All ahead full!
Ten degrees right rudder!

500
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:52,424
Commence firing!

501
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,809
Get him smack in the teeth!

502
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:18,242
Unexploded bomb forward!

503
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:22,204
We ought to be diving.

504
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,456
Got six fathoms under us.
Gotta get on.

505
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:41,181
Coming in low! Get down!

506
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:46,186
Good work, Wolf!

507
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:49,523
- Is he hurt badly?
- I think so, sir.

508
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,316
There he goes.

509
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:57,781
If that Nip doesn't get out of there,
he'll end up with a hot seat.

510
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:08,876
I could pop him off
with a clear conscience.

511
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:11,962
He looks awful Ionesome up there.

512
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:13,589
Okay.

513
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:16,592
The unexploded bomb is wedged
in the superstructure.

514
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,636
Let's have a look at it.
Larry, take the watch.

515
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,737
Pick up that Jap aviator.
I want to question him.

516
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:44,077
We'll have to bring out
the cutting torches.

517
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:45,913
No time.

518
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,541
I'll get your pigeon for you.

519
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,919
Okay, Mike.
We'll put him to roost.

520
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:06,141
Looks like the war
is over for you, son.

521
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,274
Mike!

522
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,331
That's enough, kid.

523
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,458
Where's Mike?

524
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,585
Dakota is taking him below.

525
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:44,972
Mike looked up like he
wanted me to do something.

526
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:47,724
I just stood there.

527
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:50,644
Me too. It happened so fast.

528
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:53,730
We need a man to pull the teeth
of an unexploded bomb.

529
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:56,316
Volunteers to the control room.

530
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:06,368
Mike would be alive now
if I hadn't just stood there.

531
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:09,079
Stow it. These things happen every day.

532
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:13,500
If you want to take it out on somebody,
take it out on the Japs, not yourself.

533
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,460
Come on. Let's get out of here.

534
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:24,678
It boils down to a matter of thickness.
The bomb is wedged in a tight spot.

535
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,264
And neither the captain
or I can get to it.

536
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:32,394
Back home, they used to call me "Slim."

537
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:34,146
You'll do, "Slim."

538
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,357
Take this and that off.

539
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:47,993
Your volunteer, captain.

540
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,038
Know what you're volunteering for?

541
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:52,956
Yes, sir. The bomb.

542
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:57,002
It's wedged under the superstructure.
That's not all.

543
00:47:57,169 --> 00:48:01,507
That Jap may have radioed our position.
If planes come while we're down there...

544
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:03,967
...we'll have to drink a lot of water.

545
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:07,304
I'll go with you, captain.

546
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,391
Okay, Tommy. Get down below.

547
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,818
In case of another attack,
take her down.

548
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,072
Aye, aye, sir.

549
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:30,077
Clear the decks. Diving stations!

550
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,506
Son...

551
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:46,009
...that bomb may be a dud
because the firing pin's fractured.

552
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:49,137
If it is, the slightest jar
will set it off.

553
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,014
So take it very easy.

554
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:53,725
Here. You'll need this web wrench.

555
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:57,688
Tell me when you reach the bomb,
but don't touch it.

556
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,597
- Reached the bomb.
- Don't touch it yet.

557
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:34,558
Look carefully around
the base of the fuse.

558
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:38,979
The bomb may be a booby trap,
so it will blow up at the slightest touch.

559
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:44,109
Do you see any hammer marks
or slight indentations?

560
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:49,823
- No, captain.
- All right.

561
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:52,826
Now, very carefully...

562
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,328
...feel the nose.

563
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,010
Can you feel any marks?

564
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,471
No marks, sir.

565
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:14,515
Very gently now...

566
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,602
...place the web wrench
around the fuse.

567
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,024
It unscrews counterclockwise.

568
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:25,526
Right to left.

569
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,028
You got that?

570
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:29,738
Yes, sir. It's in place.

571
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:33,659
- It unscrews left to right, sir.
- Right to left! Right to left!

572
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,202
I'm sorry, sir.

573
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,704
I heard you all right.
I repeated it wrong.

574
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:40,040
Right to left, sir.
I'm a little nervous.

575
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,542
Stop and take a breath.

576
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,127
You're doing fine.

577
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:50,592
Well, I guess Mike
got it quicker, that's all.

578
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:52,386
Shut up.

579
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:55,556
- Talking don't bother a bomb.
- It bothers me.

580
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:03,105
Dakota, I once knew a dame who had
a temperament just like a bomb.

581
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:05,315
Laugh? No laugh.

582
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:09,069
Start unscrewing it gently.
Just use gradual pressure.

583
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:10,904
Right to left.

584
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:12,573
- Right.
- Easy.

585
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:14,825
Easy. Just loosen it.

586
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:30,424
- I've loosened it, sir.
- Now, carefully...

587
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,342
...remove the wrench.

588
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:35,053
Turn the fuse by hand.

589
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:42,269
Easy.

590
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:44,354
Very, very gently, son.

591
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:48,358
Easy does it.

592
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:20,849
Got "made in U.S.A." stamped on it.

593
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:25,395
The appeasers' contribution
to the war effort.

594
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:28,148
Take it and stew it, Cookie.

595
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,192
Adams, you did a fine job.

596
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,653
You earned yourself a higher rating.

597
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,321
Thank you, sir.

598
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,369
You got a great pair
of shoes to fill, Tommy.

599
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:50,504
One kid's shoe.

600
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:54,967
And one pipe...

601
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:56,510
...stem broken.

602
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,682
That completes the inventory.

603
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:12,818
Mike was a first-class
torpedoman...

604
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:14,820
...in more ways than one.

605
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:24,788
Where's the kid?

606
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:27,124
He went aft. He feels kind of low.

607
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:30,544
Wonder if we should have told
the exec about that package...

608
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:34,089
...Mike used to keep under his sack.
- What package?

609
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:35,924
Well...

610
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:38,594
...every time he borrowed
Yo Yo's office...

611
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,096
...he took it along with him.

612
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:51,190
Hey, maybe it's one
of them censored records.

613
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,400
Say, we could do with a laugh.

614
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:12,544
I thought Mike was acting
secret when he used to come in here.

615
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,303
<i>Hello, honey.</i>

616
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:24,806
<i>I hope you play this record
once in a while while you're away.</i>

617
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:27,518
<i>It'll mean you're missing
me like I miss you...</i>

618
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:30,646
<i>... from the moment you shove off,
every single time.</i>

619
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:35,776
<i>Have I ever told you how much those
homecoming bear hugs mean to me?</i>

620
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:40,447
<i>Gosh, darling, you could break
all my ribs, having you back is so good.</i>

621
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:45,118
<i>The kids miss you and make believe
you're at the table each night.</i>

622
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:49,331
<i>I don 't think they know
what being married 10 years...</i>

623
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:52,042
<i>... to a sweet guy like you is like.</i>

624
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,211
<i>I do, thank God.</i>

625
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:57,589
<i>Means you've made me
the happiest woman alive.</i>

626
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:01,093
<i>I hope I've made you happy, Mike.</i>

627
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,178
<i>I always tried my darnedest...</i>

628
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:04,763
<i>... because I love you...</i>

629
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,640
<i>... with every bit of my heart.</i>

630
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:31,665
"And whilst we consign...

631
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:34,418
...his remains to the deep...

632
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:38,589
...we the living
pray thee heavenly Father...

633
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:42,009
...to grant him eternal peace
and rest...

634
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:44,428
...through Christ Jesus, our Lord."

635
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:46,346
Amen.

636
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,966
Why weren't you up there?

637
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:27,554
I got no use for burials.

638
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:36,146
Oh, coffee's more important, huh?

639
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:44,071
- You don't think I care he's dead?
- Why didn't you come up?

640
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:47,699
- Sorry for that Jap?
- Shut up! I don't take that from nobody!

641
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,627
I'm surprised at you guys, all of you.

642
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:03,924
You ought to have sense enough
not to get such dumb ideas!

643
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:08,762
- I told you, I had my reasons.
- Bilge!

644
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,402
Look.

645
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:26,446
I had an uncle lived
in the old country, see.

646
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:29,408
A real high-class guy, not like me.

647
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:31,159
You know what he was?

648
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:33,579
He was a teacher of philosophy.

649
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:36,248
To be that in Greece,
the home of philosophy...

650
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:39,960
...you got to be A-number-one smart,
and that was my uncle.

651
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:41,795
So they killed him, them Nazis.

652
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:44,631
They stood him up against the wall.
You know why?

653
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:46,425
Because he had brains.

654
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:51,263
And everybody's got to be their slave.
Them that won't, like my uncle, they kill.

655
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:57,227
My old man was no good.

656
00:57:57,394 --> 00:58:00,063
He was a boozer.
He died in bed having the D.T.'s.

657
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:04,693
But my uncle,
a man with education and charity...

658
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,196
...who used to send my ma
what to eat with.

659
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:11,116
Him, they stood up against the wall.
And that sticks in here with me.

660
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:13,285
The difference between
them and us...

661
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:18,123
...is, with us even the no-good
gets a chance to die in his own bed.

662
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:21,001
So I don't forget my uncle.

663
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:24,505
An American flier gets killed,
I think of my uncle.

664
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:28,258
I see pictures of Chinese kids
getting bombed, I think of my uncle.

665
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:31,178
A Russian guerrilla gets hanged,
I think of my uncle.

666
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:34,139
I see Mike lying in there dead,
I think of my uncle.

667
00:58:34,306 --> 00:58:37,351
I ain't got room in here
to see one of our guys get buried.

668
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:40,479
Not yet. Not until I've done
something to even the score.

669
00:58:40,646 --> 00:58:43,023
So I eat with it, and I sleep with it.

670
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:45,484
So be sore at me, you dopes.

671
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,865
- I'm sorry, Tin Can.
- Attention.

672
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,537
At ease, men.

673
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,044
- Trying to figure out about Mike?
- Yes, sir.

674
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:07,881
Well...

675
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:10,968
...officers and men on submarines
are closer together...

676
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:13,095
...than in most branches of our Navy.

677
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,180
Mike was with me on my first patrol.

678
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:18,392
He was my friend. I know his family.

679
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:21,895
His wife's a fine, great-hearted woman.

680
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,481
I know his kids.

681
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:31,196
I remember Mike's pride when he bought
the first pair of roller skates for his boy.

682
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:34,408
They were the finest roller skates
that money could buy.

683
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:36,577
Roller skates for a 5-year-old.

684
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:41,081
Well, that Jap got a present too,
when he was 5.

685
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:42,916
Only it was a dagger.

686
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:47,254
His old man gave him a dagger, so he'd
know what he was supposed to be.

687
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,923
The Japs have a ceremony
that goes with it.

688
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:54,595
At 7, a Jap kid is taking marches
under an army instructor.

689
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:58,265
At 13, he can put a machine
gun together blindfolded.

690
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,521
That Jap started on the road 20 years
ago to putting a knife in Mike's back.

691
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:09,318
There are lots of Mikes dying right now.

692
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:11,486
And a lot more Mikes will die...

693
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:16,950
...until we wipe out a system that puts
daggers in the hands of 5-year-olds.

694
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:19,411
You know...

695
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:22,080
...if Mike were here to put
it into words now...

696
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:24,666
...that's just about what he died for.

697
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:27,211
More roller skates in this world.

698
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,548
Including some for the next
generation of Japanese kids...

699
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:35,093
...because that's the kind
of a man Mike was.

700
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:21,056
- What's that you're reading?
- San Francisco telephone directory.

701
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:23,517
- I collect names.
- What do you do with them?

702
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:27,354
Just meditate. Wonder what kind
of people go with the names.

703
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:31,024
- Wonder what the names mean.
- Names don't mean nothing.

704
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:32,985
- Oh, no?
- No.

705
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,821
- Well, my name's Wainwright.
- Wainwright. So what?

706
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:40,409
My grandpa used to build wagons. A
wainwright's a guy who builds wagons.

707
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:42,703
- Like covered wagons?
- Sure.

708
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,622
Maybe he built some
wagons crossed the plains.

709
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:49,168
Some grandpas built houses.
Name's Carpenter.

710
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:52,421
Some grandpas made clothes.
Name's Tailor.

711
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:56,425
Some guy's grandpa built wheels
for my grandpa's wagons.

712
01:01:56,592 --> 01:01:58,886
Name's Wheelwright,
a guy who builds wheels.

713
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:02,472
Sun lamp ready in the forward room.
Come on, GI sunshine.

714
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,893
Don't tell me the captain
finally gave up that sun lamp.

715
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:09,396
Phone books are fascinating.
I'm nuts about them.

716
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:11,982
Personally, I use phone books
for long shots.

717
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:15,194
In San Diego, I had nothing to do
and nothing on my mind...

718
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,737
Except skirts.

719
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:20,115
So I sees this phone book.
I flip it open. I come to a name.

720
01:02:20,282 --> 01:02:21,658
Rosalie Riley.

721
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,287
"Pretty name," I says to myself.
"I wonder what she's like."

722
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:27,289
- So...
- So you call her up.

723
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:29,124
No. Why waste time?

724
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:32,252
I go right out to her house,
21 Valley Road.

725
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,963
Never forget it.
Had roses all over the place.

726
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,965
Very pretty. Very pretty indeed.

727
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:39,927
- Red and pink roses...
- Now we're going to pick roses.

728
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:44,056
I pick a rose. So I got something to talk
about when she comes to the door.

729
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,017
Up I go to the door.

730
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:51,355
I ring the bell. And I hear
a very nice voice from the inside.

731
01:02:51,522 --> 01:02:54,441
"Wait a minute," she says.
"I'm in the bathtub."

732
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:56,944
Every girl you meet is in the bathtub!

733
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,072
I haven't met her yet. I'm on her porch!

734
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,783
Naturally, I sit down.

735
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,911
I'm rocking back and forth,
back and forth.

736
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:08,580
Skip the details.
Who cares if you're rocking?

737
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:11,291
I'm just trying to give you the picture!

738
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:13,961
We got the picture!

739
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,588
You're in the bathtub!
She's on the porch!

740
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:21,301
She's in the bathtub.
I'm on the porch!

741
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:25,556
She comes to the door.
My stomach flutters.

742
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:28,475
- She's beautiful!
- Now his stomach flutters.

743
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,647
"Oh," she says, "I thought you were
someone else. " "Disappointed?" I says.

744
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:35,649
You're there
with a snappy comeback.

745
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:37,901
She says,
"I can't ask you to come in."

746
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:42,406
"Of course not," I says, giving her pearly
teeth. "But I can ask you to come out."

747
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:44,032
What did she say to that?

748
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:46,994
Well, she didn't say anything,
that is, right away.

749
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,454
Then I proceeded to pour
on the personality.

750
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:51,248
Then what did you do?

751
01:03:51,582 --> 01:03:53,709
Now, wouldn't you like to know?

752
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:57,171
You give me a pain in the pancreas.
You're always shooting off.

753
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:01,008
Stow it for the rest of this patrol.
Some of us have sweethearts.

754
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:04,344
Yeah?
Well, maybe some of us haven't.

755
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:08,974
Hasn't he been telling the truth?

756
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:13,937
No. You haven't been swallowing
all that stuff, have you?

757
01:05:00,526 --> 01:05:02,319
Captain.

758
01:05:02,903 --> 01:05:04,821
Oh, this it?

759
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,074
I'm afraid to take a look.

760
01:05:08,951 --> 01:05:11,453
Just hope it won't be Coney Island.

761
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,414
Well, I got on my lucky sweater.

762
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:33,016
What's the bearing?

763
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,435
Zero-five-zero, captain.

764
01:05:51,577 --> 01:05:54,746
Smack on the button. Take a look.

765
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:04,590
Right down Fujiyama's throat.

766
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:07,384
Nice work, Andy.
Check your tangents.

767
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:14,266
Lieutenant Raymond
to the conning tower.

768
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:17,936
Attention, all hands.

769
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:22,274
We're lying off the Japanese mainland.
Thought you'd like to know.

770
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:25,319
Just like the postcards, huh?

771
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,155
You get a better look inside the bay,
captain.

772
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:31,950
By the way, you think you can
get inside the net?

773
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:34,745
- That's what orders say.
- What about minefields?

774
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:37,831
- Can you see them underwater?
- Nope. I wish I could.

775
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:41,168
But if you do get in, how are you
going to get the ship out?

776
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:44,129
This is a sort of blind date, Raymond.

777
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:47,674
- We have to wait and see what happens.
- Got my tangents, captain.

778
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:50,802
Okay, Andy. Down scope.

779
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:55,432
We'll break out a chart
of the probable minefields.

780
01:06:55,641 --> 01:07:00,145
Well, boys, looks as if
we have to wait for a ticket in.

781
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:08,195
This is going to be like waiting
to have your first tooth yanked.

782
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,907
Checking the gravity, captain.

783
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:17,538
How'd you happen to volunteer
for the submarine service, captain?

784
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:19,206
Well, when I was a kid...

785
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:22,543
...I used to get a kick
out of swimming underwater.

786
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:28,215
How's your wife feel about
your shoving off on these patrols?

787
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:31,385
The way the wives of all the men
in the services feel.

788
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:34,012
Did she know what she
was getting into?

789
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:35,722
Not when she met me.

790
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:38,308
She was a blind date.

791
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,144
Not quite the same as the date
we've got ahead.

792
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:43,856
It was dark. I couldn't see
what she looked like.

793
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:46,316
- You find out what she looked like?
- Yes.

794
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:49,403
You see, we have two kids by now.

795
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:52,698
I meant that night, sir.

796
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:54,449
No.

797
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:59,121
But I found you didn't need to know
what a girl looked like to like her.

798
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:03,292
I liked her voice, the things she said,
the way she laughed.

799
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:05,252
Still do.

800
01:08:05,586 --> 01:08:08,422
I like the way she is with our kids.

801
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:11,341
I like everything about her.

802
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:14,845
What made you pick the Navy,
Raymond?

803
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:17,055
Well, I was born and raised in Tokyo.

804
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:19,099
Tokyo, Japan?

805
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:21,894
- You speak Japanese?
- Yes, he does.

806
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,022
- We expect to make good use of it soon.
- Let's hear some.
