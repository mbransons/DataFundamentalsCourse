1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,082
- Fire!
- Stand back!

3
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,127
In the woods, boys, in the woods!

4
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,881
- Fire!
- Let's go! Ride!

5
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,142
Fall back!

6
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,440
You okay?

7
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,525
Come on, Bob!
This way!

8
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,944
Hey, you all right?

9
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,786
Gatling! They got a Gatling.

10
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,499
Goddamn it, Cole! This stopped
being fun about two years ago.

11
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,669
Move that wagon!

12
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,635
- Down!
- Fire!

13
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,640
Cole, Bob, you okay?

14
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,101
Takes more than a cannon
to kill the Youngers.

15
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:29,149
- The cannon's doing a good job, Cole!
- Some Indian tracker you are, Tom.

16
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,319
You pay me to find Bluecoats.
There they are.

17
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,571
- Get me James.
- Jesse?

18
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,574
No, not Jesse. The one that can shoot.

19
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,827
- Frank!
- Frank!

20
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,746
Hold your ground!

21
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,790
Frank, up front!

22
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,126
Jesse, watch your back.

23
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,923
Watch your heads, boys.

24
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,349
- Cannon or Gatling?
- Fire!

25
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,726
- Cannon!
- Cannon.

26
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,632
- Where you been?
- What's up?

27
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,009
Nothing really.

28
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,803
When I put my head up,
they shoot at me.

29
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:44,349
- So, we got a plan?
- My plan of pissing myself is working.

30
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,603
I can hit those boys.
We need a distraction.

31
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:53,358
A distraction?
Why the hell didn't you just say so?

32
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,325
- He's smiling.
- That's never a good thing.

33
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,113
Get that rider!

34
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,429
- We're coming, Jesse!
- Head out!

35
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,309
Take the hill! Charge!

36
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,500
Pull back!

37
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,056
Come on!

38
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,957
Go on, get. Get!

39
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,304
Go on! Go on!

40
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,692
- Distracting enough?
- They hardly noticed.

41
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,612
- I could have done more?
- Uh-huh!

42
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,950
- Such as?
- You could have worn a woman's bonnet.

43
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,119
- That would've made an impression.
- I figure.

44
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,000
By the time you figure out stuff,
I'm already finished doing it.

45
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,839
You're always doing stuff
before I'm finished figuring it out.

46
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:06,343
Goddamn, boy!
Wait till we get to Missouri.

47
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,931
Tell them gals about how
Jesse James charged the Union Army.

48
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:16,728
- He keeps that up, he'll outrank you.
- I'll still be better-looking, right?

49
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,147
Let's meet on that south road.

50
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:24,278
See if we can get those Yankees
Jesse here scared off.

51
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,614
- Ride with me, cousin.
- I could use the walk.

52
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:32,160
All right. We'll have
horses waiting for you at the road.

53
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,289
All right, Rangers, let's ride!

54
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,210
I would sound stupid
saying something like that.

55
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,641
Where you going?

56
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,103
- There's Yankees back there.
- War's over.

57
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,565
General Lee surrendered yesterday
at Appomattox.

58
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,944
- Yesterday.
- Somebody better tell the Yankees!

59
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:11,450
- What do you reckon, cousin?
- Home. Cole, we go home.

60
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:17,706
We ride like hell and God help any
fool who comes between me and my farm.

61
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,542
That's the best plan I heard all war.

62
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,086
Well, boys, let's ride!

63
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,710
- Hello, Liberty, Missouri!
- Let's go home, back to our farms.

64
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:49,089
Planting corn, harvesting corn,
eating corn.

65
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,924
Corn gonna shoot me?

66
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,386
- Then I love it.
- Let's go!

67
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,230
We got problems.

68
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,026
Got a garrison in town.
We're in occupied territory.

69
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,987
- Hands off your hip.
- Are you scared?

70
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,199
Pick your fights. You taught me that.

71
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,630
- Jesus, mercy.
- That's Charlie Higgins.

72
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,634
- I'm cutting him down.
- Not now, Cole.

73
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:37,387
- What's wrong with you?
- Lf we have to kill them...

74
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,473
...I don't wanna warn them.

75
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,726
I wanna make sure Jim
and the girls are okay.

76
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:47,564
Stop by and tell our ma we're fine.
We'll see Doc Mimms.

77
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,879
Excuse me, sir,
we're here for the doctor.

78
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,176
- Jesse. Frank.
- Zerelda?

79
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,638
- Little Zee Mimms?
- You were little Jesse James.

80
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:25,727
Yeah, but you got big!
I mean, Zee, you aged!

81
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,231
I mean, in a good way,
you got big and older.

82
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,901
- Frank, say something.
- No, you're doing just fine.

83
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,780
- Frank. Jesse.
- Daddy.

84
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:43,787
- Where's Web?
- He rode right into them, screaming.

85
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,791
- Web did that?
- He jumped his horse over our heads.

86
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,919
Killed 12 before they
knew what hit them.

87
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:56,383
- Took out a Gatling gun and a cannon.
- Saved all our lives, doc.

88
00:11:56,592 --> 00:12:01,597
None of the Liberty boys would've
come home if not for Web. God's truth.

89
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,892
- Web died fighting?
- Web died a hero.

90
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,729
But still died.

91
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:13,066
Doc, if there's anything we can do,
we want to help.

92
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:17,362
Think about yourselves.
Don't end up like Charlie Higgins.

93
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,199
They found out he was a
Quantrill Raider.

94
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:25,162
They arrested him, tried him by
military tribunal and hanged him.

95
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,417
- But there's general amnesty.
- Not if you rode in a partisan band.

96
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,421
You're in more danger
because you've got a farm.

97
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,759
Railroad men come in offering
to buy land. Nobody sells.

98
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,305
So the army starts hanging men
who own farms for treason.

99
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,807
All we've thought about is home.

100
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,811
I'll kill anyone who tries
to get me off my farm.

101
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,234
If I have to go to war with the
railroad to stay, it's fine by me.

102
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,236
Let's think about this.

103
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,950
- Lf we have a good story, we're okay.
- What story are they gonna believe?

104
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,703
You were in General Hood's
Texas Army...

105
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:10,832
...until Sharpsburg, then were
assigned to Jeb Stuart's cavalry...

106
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,294
...until you surrendered in Tennessee.

107
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:19,800
- That just might work.
- Yeah, that might just work.

108
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,345
Now go on and see your ma.

109
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,306
She'll be glad to see her sons alive.

110
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:30,644
And for her sake, stay that way.

111
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:43,073
Thanks for everything.
Especially the story you told.

112
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,743
- Look, Zee...
- I'm going to go cry now.

113
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,839
- Zerelda became a hell of a woman.
- Oh, yeah.

114
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,508
- "Big and older."
- Shut up, Frank.

115
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:02,968
You're a charmer.

116
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,722
- I'll shoot you.
- Next time, try "fat and haggard."

117
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,900
My boys! My boys!

118
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:22,154
My boys! My boys are alive! Oh, God!

119
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:26,992
- Praise God, you're alive!
- Not if you don't ease up a bit, Ma.

120
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,413
- Did you kill Yankees?
- A few.

121
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,248
- Say your prayers?
- Yes.

122
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,002
Good. Come inside and wash
your hands for dinner.

123
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,714
- Ma, you look so good.
- No, you look great!

124
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,302
Look at Jimmy Younger,
all grown up.

125
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,888
- How you doing?
- All right.

126
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,558
- Your ma made us eat.
- That was two hours ago.

127
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,268
I don't see clean plates.

128
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:58,148
- Thanks for accepting Tom.
- He's Christian and killed Yankees.

129
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:03,862
- Jesus told me that made him okay.
- She's still talking to Jesus.

130
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,824
- What worries me is, he's talking back.
- I heard that.

131
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,204
- Come on, Frank.
- You play me that.

132
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,086
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?

133
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,588
She got two, don't she?

134
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,216
- I think one's glass.
- Which one?

135
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,052
- The right or the left?
- The brown one.

136
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:32,057
Don't make me tell the town about
the fella you screwed in Atlanta.

137
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,642
Talking to me?

138
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,228
- That dance-hall girl at Bunny's?
- Yes.

139
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,314
Sadie was a beautiful woman.
Not a man!

140
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,317
- She had a nice mustache.
- More than that.

141
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,195
- She was European.
- All right.

142
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,949
I'll admit Sadie's a woman,
if you stop about my Zee.

143
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,701
- "My Zee"?
- Your Zee?

144
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,162
From women 's eyes
This doctrine I derive

145
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:57,833
They sparkle still
The right Promethean fire

146
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,003
They are the books, the arts
The academes

147
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,548
That show, contain and nourish
All the world

148
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,218
I don't know what you said,
but it sounded nice.

149
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,763
That's Shakespeare.
Now, he's European.

150
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,142
Write that down,
so I can say it to Zee?

151
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,729
- I'll send you a telegram.
- Thanks, brother.

152
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:23,734
- Thanks for the help, Cole.
- You did plenty over at our place.

153
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,613
- You miss it, don't you?
- What, the war?

154
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,781
Hell, no.

155
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,534
I miss things about it, but...

156
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,828
- It was exciting.
- Yeah.

157
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,248
It was a lot of killing.
Why miss that?

158
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:43,378
Because we were good at it.
Shoot, we were great at it.

159
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:49,301
Tell anybody this and I'll kill you.
You know I'm the toughest man in town.

160
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,764
But you are one terrifying
son of a bitch with guns.

161
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,897
Boys.

162
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,072
Howdy, folks, how are you?

163
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,366
- Howdy?
- Easterners.

164
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,326
Fine, thank you, sir.

165
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,788
I'm Rollin H. Parker,
emissary to Thaddeus Rains...

166
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,666
...president of Rock
Northern Railroad.

167
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,293
This is Allan Pinkerton...

168
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:27,756
...founder of the Secret Service
and under contract to Mr. Rains.

169
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:32,052
As you no doubt heard,
our railroad's moving west.

170
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,180
Well, east would put you underwater.

171
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,102
Moving west to open
the frontier to folks.

172
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,939
Your acreage is located on
the proposed right of way.

173
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:50,028
I am here to get your signature
on this land-sale contract.

174
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,491
And I'm authorized to pay you two
dollars an acre.

175
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,951
Two dollars?

176
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,790
The price was set by the Department of
the Interior of the U.S. Government.

177
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,711
- This land ain't for sale.
- I understand how you feel.

178
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,674
You've made a lovely home here,
but it isn't up to me or you.

179
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:14,428
You familiar with the right
of eminent domain?

180
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,763
Yeah, I am. What about it?

181
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,934
This land's about to be condemned.

182
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,479
You see, I'm doing you folks a favor.

183
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,983
Two dollars an acre
is a one-time-only deal.

184
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,235
After today, the price drops.

185
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:34,698
If I were you, I'd sign the contract
and we'll be on our way.

186
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,534
Good day, Mr. Parker.

187
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:42,831
You can tell Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put
this where the sun don't shine.

188
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,751
Shakespeare.

189
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:52,257
I don't think you understand.

190
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,260
You don't have a choice.

191
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:01,767
Ma'am, I think that you should
search your heart here...

192
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,062
...and try to do the right thing.

193
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,899
Let me ask the Lord.

194
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:23,539
The Lord says to bury them out back.
Nobody will find them.

195
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,000
- Somebody's in a vengeful mood.
- Let them go.

196
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,504
- We'll bury them next time.
- Oh, all right.

197
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,673
Now, ma'am...

198
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:40,180
You folks are making
a serious mistake here.

199
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,356
Nicely played.

200
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,824
Tell them what you told me.

201
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:04,413
I checked the court documents for the
rail bed. They don't need our land.

202
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:08,041
They're using as much land
as they can.

203
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,544
Floor recognizes Clell Miller.

204
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,173
They say if we don't sell,
we'll end up with nothing.

205
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:18,802
- Only if we don't stick together.
- Loni Packwood.

206
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,764
I say this is the last straw.

207
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:27,978
I came back from the war.
My farm was burned down.

208
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:33,609
My cows was dead. And now my wife's
run off with my cousin Jeb.

209
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:38,155
That son of a bitch. He took my dog!

210
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,159
Loni. About the railroad.

211
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,245
He took my dog!

212
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,790
- They got Cole!
- He came to our house.

213
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,919
Figured you'd all want to hear this.

214
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:57,257
They came and made the same offer
they made you folks.

215
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:00,302
My brother Jim tried
to chase them off.

216
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,931
A detective hit him in the head
and knocked him out.

217
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,142
- Cole lost his temper.
- Oh, no.

218
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,604
- Just a little.
- How many did he kill, Bob?

219
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,773
Two.

220
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,902
Because they worked for
the Department of the Interior...

221
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,238
The Army can hang him.

222
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,697
Tomorrow.

223
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,450
- What do we do?
- Nothing!

224
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,537
You folks will do nothing.
Go home now.

225
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,664
You too, doc.

226
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:33,335
So you can swear that you know
nothing about what's gonna happen.

227
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:36,547
- Boys...
- Doc, go home.

228
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:41,093
They ain't gonna hang
no more Liberty boys.

229
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,428
Go home.

230
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:53,272
Meeting's adjourned.
Go home, everybody.

231
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,315
Go home.

232
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,151
- I'm staying.
- Me too.

233
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,821
Loni, Clell.

234
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:04,157
- Couldn't lose him.
- Jim, I said stay home!

235
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,201
It's my fault. I want in.

236
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,705
It was a matter of time before
they hung someone.

237
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:13,667
- And you're too young.
- Too young?

238
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:21,341
- I'm as old as you were, going to war.
- And Web too. No.

239
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,136
- You're wasting time.
- Zee, go home.

240
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,346
I was there for the hangings.

241
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:31,185
You need to know how they do it.
What order they do things in.

242
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:35,772
If you mess up rescuing Cole because
you won't listen to a woman...

243
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,109
...then damn you all.

244
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:46,283
All right.

245
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:50,078
Eight of us against
a Union regiment...

246
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:56,001
...and Pinkerton detectives on
Main Street in broad daylight.

247
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,715
- He's smiling.
- Is that bad?

248
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,551
Very.

249
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:22,986
Pinkerton, relax. The Army
has everything well in hand.

250
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:27,699
Nothing like a hanging to motivate
people to relocate.

251
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:30,285
It's not my job to relax.

252
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:34,998
I've got men at every entrance
so no one rides in shooting.

253
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:39,378
I've got a sharpshooter up
on that rooftop over there...

254
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,089
...just in case.

255
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,684
Be it known that Coleman Younger
be found guilty of treasonable acts...

256
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:57,437
...against military law
and the Articles of War...

257
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:00,858
...to be hanged by
the neck until dead.

258
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,820
May God have mercy on his soul.

259
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,932
Brilliant.

260
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,644
Go on, hang him! Pull it!

261
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:22,624
Sir, are you all right?
Somebody get a doctor!

262
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:33,343
The bullet left clean,
but he's lost blood.

263
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:37,306
He's gonna be fine, right, Daddy?

264
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:39,433
Praying wouldn't hurt.

265
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,771
Who's that? Stay here with him.

266
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:49,776
We're checking all houses
for a fugitive.

267
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,363
Powell, out back. McCall, first floor.

268
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,407
- I'm going up.
- Who are you?

269
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,578
- Oh, sorry, ma'am.
- Well, I should hope so!

270
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,583
Go! Go.

271
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,838
Jesse, are you awake?

272
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,925
Jesse, is that your hand?

273
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,393
They're gone. What are you...?

274
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:28,148
- I made them think I was alone.
- Let's hope he pulls through.

275
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,693
I think he's feeling better already.

276
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,552
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir.

277
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,472
- It's a pleasure to have you.
- I'm pleased to be here.

278
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,599
- Really?
- No, Parker, no!

279
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:07,646
I'm really not pleased to come
to this godforsaken piece of dirt...

280
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:11,942
...to discover why you can't evict
a few simple farmers...

281
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,653
...from their pathetic mudholes...

282
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:17,781
...so I can build the greatest
railroad ever.

283
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,995
- I understand your distress, sir.
- What's going on?

284
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:29,209
Two weeks ago, we arranged to have
the Army hang a local farmer.

285
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,087
- That's good.
- Unfortunately not, sir.

286
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,966
A group of local thugs
managed to rescue him...

287
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:41,763
...inspiring resistance. And Mr.
Allan Pinkerton was seriously injured.

288
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:46,560
Leaving you in charge of operations
until he should return.

289
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:51,106
A further impediment is that
the garrison's moving on...

290
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:55,569
...so we don't have that stick
to threaten them with.

291
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,238
You see that as the loss of a tool.

292
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:02,451
I see a power vacuum to fill.
As we have the most power...

293
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,746
...we may move with impunity.

294
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,457
I see, sir.

295
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,878
I'll get four patrols together
for action tonight.

296
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,047
They'll see what happens...

297
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:18,842
...when they challenge
the righteousness of progress.

298
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:20,886
Yes, sir.

299
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:27,059
- You shouldn't be up.
- It's been two weeks. I'm sick of it.

300
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,437
- You're sick of my company?
- Of course not!

301
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:35,484
- Teasing you is unfair.
- What you do to me is unfair.

302
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:39,154
- Well, I shouldn't tease a hero.
- What?

303
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:42,658
Everybody in the county knows
you rescued Cole.

304
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,993
We're all so proud of you.

305
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:47,871
And not one farm's been sold since.

306
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,251
Well, that's good, but I wasn't
the only person...

307
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,586
...risking my neck that day.

308
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:58,590
You're saying I should spend time
with Cole Younger?

309
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:02,469
With Cole Younger?
No, I never said that.

310
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:10,310
- You gonna stop loafing and get home?
- What do you think, Frank?

311
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:15,858
Until Ma has you home so she can fuss
over you, she'll make me miserable.

312
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:19,611
- What do you say, sir?
- You're pretty much healed.

313
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,906
- Thank you, doc.
- Of course.

314
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,409
Bye, Jesse.

315
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,580
Bye, Zee.

316
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,043
- You're looking more spry.
- Shut up, Frank.

317
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:40,465
Doc, I was wondering if later
this evening I could come by?

318
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,092
You're always welcome.

319
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:46,722
Yeah, I know, doc. But I was thinking
maybe I could take Zee out?

320
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,683
Someplace near, with other folk.

321
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,353
Near, you know. Here, but out.

322
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,772
It's fine by me, Jesse.

323
00:30:55,981 --> 00:31:00,235
Don't worry, sir.
I'll make sure they're chaperoned.

324
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:06,241
That hadn't even occurred to me.
I am deeply in your debt.

325
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,202
You're very welcome, sir.

326
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:13,498
The Army's leaving, so Cole can stop
hiding and get back to his farm.

327
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,001
We're meeting
at the Younger place.

328
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,345
Leave them alone.

329
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,222
- Cole.
- Clell.

330
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:30,891
- How are you?
- Hey, John.

331
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,976
Thanks for coming.

332
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,686
- How are you?
- Hey, Cole.

333
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:38,815
Hey, who's seen how Loni
Packwood is dressed?

334
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,985
Tom, come here, huh?

335
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:45,072
- Thank you.
- James!

336
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,908
You behave yourselves.

337
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,703
Look. Liberty's favorite son,
come here!

338
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,665
- I won't forget what you did.
- Yeah.

339
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,500
I'm pleased you came.

340
00:31:56,708 --> 00:32:00,337
- Why, thank you.
- I'm very pleased you came with Jesse.

341
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:04,174
There's a gaggle of girls
hoping to dance with Jesse...

342
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:07,636
...who'll have to settle
with my many charms.

343
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:11,849
- Bob, you have no shame.
- Not yet. But I'm hoping.

344
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,102
- Let's dance.
- Okay.

345
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:08,113
I used to come to this rock
as a kid.

346
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:11,450
Imagine what life would be like
when I got older.

347
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,579
- You didn't want a farm?
- I thought of being a river pirate.

348
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,289
A river pirate?

349
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:22,920
- Hand over your jewels, missy.
- Thank God you grew out of that.

350
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,049
- You did grow out of that, didn't you?
- Mostly, yeah.

351
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,594
I mean, it would be all right
for a bachelor.

352
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,476
Are you planning on being a bachelor
your whole life, Jesse James?

353
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:41,230
Not if I find the right girl.

354
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,357
What's this "right girl" like?

355
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:49,154
What's she like? She's smart.
She's funny.

356
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,533
She's bossy.
She always makes me think.

357
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,619
She's at least two steps ahead of me.

358
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,415
Where will you find such a girl?

359
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,672
From this doctrine...

360
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:14,680
From women 's eyes these doctrine...
This doctrine, I derive

361
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:20,060
They sparkle still like...

362
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,439
...tiny sparkling rocks

363
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,483
"Sparkling rocks"?

364
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,193
Yeah, little ones.

365
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,113
Is this one of Frank's
Shakespeare poems?

366
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,574
Yes, it is.

367
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:40,455
Were you planning on kissing
me when you finished quoting?

368
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:44,209
I planned on kissing you
for a very long time.

369
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:14,406
Bastards!

370
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:16,950
Come back here and face me!

371
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,661
- Cole, what'd they do?
- Let's get back.

372
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,623
We need some water.
Get some buckets.

373
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:26,335
- Get buckets!
- Water!

374
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:32,841
It's the Pinkertons.
It's the railroad.

375
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:36,345
Then Ma. Ma!

376
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,097
Come on!

377
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,781
Thank God.

378
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,161
Ma!

379
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:04,081
Ma! Ma!

380
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,004
We know.
We'll get you to Doc Mimms.

381
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:17,094
You boys take care
of each other.

382
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:19,263
Ma, Doc Mimms...

383
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,352
Well, look at that.

384
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:29,940
The good Lord's a bit shorter
than I reckoned.

385
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,362
Ma?

386
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:59,553
I think we can move on, rebuild.
Make a decent life someplace else.

387
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:04,349
- I don't care.
- I didn't think you would.

388
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:10,022
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy
Johnston, the Creeders', Will Hite.

389
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:15,736
- Sheriff said it's drunk Kansas boys.
- I say we kill some railroad men.

390
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:19,406
No. This isn't a feud, this is war.

391
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:23,076
- They've got more men than us.
- What do we do?

392
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:27,748
We do what we did in the war.
We harass their supply lines.

393
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:32,294
- We kill their men, they won't care.
- Lf we take money and supplies...

394
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:35,005
- Exactly.
- That's a good plan, Jesse.

395
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:38,133
I'll get more men,
and Tom will ride with us.

396
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:41,386
- Where do we hit?
- I know a gal at the bank.

397
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:45,849
See if I can get a list of where
the railroad keeps money.

398
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:03,617
- I'm so sorry, Jesse.
- Me and Frank gotta leave for a while.

399
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:08,497
But you and I,
we've started something.

400
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:11,333
I don't know what'll happen if you go.

401
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,336
- Neither do I.
- Just let the law...

402
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:18,715
Laws don't touch men like
Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.

403
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:22,511
Whose justice, yours or God's?

404
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,180
When will you stop?

405
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:31,019
When I send them to their graves.

406
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:57,004
I have bad news.
The railroad payroll has been stolen.

407
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:01,258
What do you mean?
The railroad's money is in that safe.

408
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,012
That safe?

409
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,378
Excuse me, sir,
the bank's closed today.

410
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,589
- What?
- It's a bank holiday.

411
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:45,969
There ain't no dad-burned bank
holiday. Get out of my way!

412
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,474
- This is outrageous. Who are you?
- The James gang.

413
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:54,144
- The James gang?
- Yeah.

414
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,648
How about the James-Younger gang?

415
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,901
The James-Younger gang.

416
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:06,323
I'll whop you real good
if you don't get out of my way.

417
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:07,950
Stop!

418
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,827
Excuse me, sir. It's a bank holiday.

419
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:14,581
It ain't no bank holiday.
What are you saying?

420
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,792
- What are you doing?
- Go on.

421
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,461
Sir, the safe.

422
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,506
- Ma'am, turn around. Cover your eyes.
- Why?

423
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm gonna shoot him
and I don't think you wanna see it.

424
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:32,015
Hey, the safe. Now.

425
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,059
It ain't no holiday.

426
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:37,187
- It's a bank holiday.
- You're right, sir.

427
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:43,151
- Then why can't I go in there?
- On account of that we're robbing it.

428
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:46,196
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

429
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:49,616
It's secret.

430
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:55,747
- Fine, I'll just wait over here.
- I'd appreciate that.

431
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:02,337
Go on.

432
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:06,383
- What the...?
- What is it?

433
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:10,345
Old Man Tucker is sitting there quiet
outside the bank.

434
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:11,805
So?

435
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:16,810
When have you ever known Old Man
Tucker not to be yelling?

436
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:28,197
- How'd it go in there?
- Fine. How'd it go out here?

437
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,199
We should talk.

438
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:45,797
You can be smart or stupid about this.
Only one way ends with you breathing.

439
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:07,361
Just because we're robbing a bank,
there's no reason not to be civil.

440
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:20,165
- Where the hell were you?
- I had you covered.

441
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,628
- I got 5000.
- I got 3000.

442
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:28,173
$8000! That's $1000 apiece!

443
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:30,425
Our luck is finally changing.

444
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:35,430
These are the farm property rights
the bank held for the railroad.

445
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:39,226
Pass them over here before something
happens to them.

446
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,270
Whoops.

447
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:46,400
Settle down.
Not all this money's ours.

448
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,402
No, it was the bank's.

449
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:52,614
That's why we went
to all the trouble of stealing it.

450
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:57,661
We ought to give some money
to our hurting neighbors in Liberty.

451
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,913
They didn't risk their necks.

452
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,710
Creating some goodwill
will make it easier to dodge the law.

453
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,129
Frank's being smart about this.

454
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:10,132
Him reading books
don't make him smart.

455
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:13,510
- Yeah, it does.
- No, it don't. Stay out of this.

456
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,347
- I think Jesse's got a good idea.
- Jim.

457
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:24,021
Who put you in charge? I did
a mighty fine job during the war.

458
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:27,357
And I remember cutting
a noose off you.

459
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:30,194
That's why you both lead the gang.

460
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:35,073
Two of you went into that bank.
Two heads are better than one.

461
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:38,619
All Jesse's doing is making
a suggestion.

462
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:42,247
We're waiting to hear
what you think, Cole...

463
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:45,667
...as the other leader of the gang.

464
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:48,045
That's fine.

465
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:50,923
- What?
- It's a smart thing to do.

466
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:52,508
- Cole...
- Hey!

467
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:58,013
We decide something, that's it.
We're in this for the long haul.

468
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:03,852
This plan of me and Jesse's,
it's smart. Gives us places to hide.

469
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:07,606
Then no farmer will shoot us
in our sleep.

470
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:10,943
We gotta think...
What's that word, Frank?

471
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:14,738
- Strategically.
- Yeah, thank you.

472
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:19,701
- Strategically, because this is a war.
- This ain't no war.

473
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:22,829
What's that?

474
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,209
Nobody paid me no $1000
to fight in a war.

475
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,342
- Tom, are you cheating again?
- I'm broke again.

476
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:38,887
- Next up, Thaxton Switch.
- That ain't a bank.

477
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:43,350
It's a construction depot
so it'll have ammo, explosives.

478
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,270
We can take those and
do a bigger job.

479
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:52,442
- It's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
- I do so want to kill me some of them.

480
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,945
Boys...

481
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:58,574
...we're famous.
- What's this?

482
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:02,870
"Fidelity Bank was robbed on Tuesday
by 20 armed men."

483
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:09,376
Twenty? You mean another gang robbed
the same bank the same day as us?

484
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:13,463
"The outlaws, calling themselves
the James-Younger gang...

485
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,926
...shot their way out, wounding
the sheriff and three townsfolk.

486
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:24,683
- The loss is estimated to be $50,000."
- $50,000? More like 50,000 pesos.

487
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:29,479
"It's believed to be the first
daylight robbery in American history."

488
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,274
- I'll drink to that.
- We made history?

489
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:35,485
- We should be proud.
- The rest is horseshit.

490
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:40,699
Next time we're gonna have to set
the record straight ourselves.

491
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,118
Line them up.

492
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:45,996
- Barkeep.
- Whiskey.

493
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:57,257
They exchanged fire
with the Pinkerton guards...

494
00:45:57,466 --> 00:46:00,552
...raided the payroll office
and blew the track.

495
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,349
- How much did they get from the safe?
- $35,000 in currency...

496
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:09,019
...plus the added delay
of miles of destroyed track.

497
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:13,649
I'll kill them for blowing up
my railway.

498
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:18,362
- They didn't actually blow the track.
- Who did?

499
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:23,825
We did. I mean, our men did.

500
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:28,705
Our workers planted the dynamite,
but they were under duress.

501
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:32,960
Pinkerton, what is going on here?

502
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:39,007
You managed to piss off the wrong
bunch of farm boys this time.

503
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:43,428
- They had to be dealt with.
- By burning down their homes?

504
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:46,139
You wouldn't have done that?

505
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,520
I would have done that. But I'd make
sure I killed them all first.

506
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:56,942
- I want them arrested and hanged.
- Do you think a jury in these parts...

507
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,279
...would convict one of their own?
I doubt it.

508
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:04,992
- We're beginning an interesting game.
- This is no game.

509
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:10,372
I'm afraid our adversaries
don't agree.

510
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:16,753
"Rock Island Pacific Railroad Depot
was robbed near St. Louis, Missouri.

511
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:21,341
The James-Younger gang was outnumbered
by Pinkerton detectives...

512
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:24,887
...but they were no match
for the guns of the West."

513
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:27,014
Fine piece of writing.

514
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,850
"The gang destroyed
the Thaxton Switch site...

515
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:34,271
...meaning that for months,
farmers can sleep without fearing...

516
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,733
...the railroad is coming
to steal their land."

517
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,819
Who wrote this? I'll see them hanged.

518
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,698
That's the best part.

519
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,536
"The foregoing article
was sent to this newspaper...

520
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:53,874
...reputedly written
by the outlaw Jesse James himself."

521
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:08,263
- Hey! Look at that.
- What is it?

522
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:10,432
"Better...

523
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:13,393
...slow down.

524
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:17,439
Dynamite ahead.

525
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,483
Too late.

526
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:22,319
You're dead."

527
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:43,090
Yes, sir, that was a fine
piece of driving.

528
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,891
Damn.

529
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:58,522
Thanks, Mr. Williams.

530
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:02,901
You have to look carefully
at these Yankee $2 bills.

531
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:07,698
- Could you change this for me? Thanks.
- Certainly, sir.

532
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:14,580
- I'm sorry, this bill is counterfeit.
- I don't think so.

533
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:19,042
I'll need all your money
so I can compare.

534
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:22,713
Scientific method.
I hear it's all the rage.

535
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:26,133
Yes, you can compare
all of them, Mr...

536
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:28,552
James.

537
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,723
- Jesse James?
- Yes, sir, it's a terrible sketch.

538
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:36,226
- That's all I have.
- Thank you. Been a pleasure.

539
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,687
Take care now, you hear?

540
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:41,273
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

541
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:44,610
Pinkerton, why can't you catch
these outlaws?

542
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,945
It's early in the game, sir.

543
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:50,908
Jesse James and I are learning
each other's moves...

544
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:53,160
...feeling out each other.

545
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:58,457
I'm losing millions while you play
chess with these farmers.

546
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,000
Hardly farmers.

547
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:04,505
Each of these men has four
years of fighting experience.

548
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:08,383
They're disciplined and
have a charismatic leader.

549
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:12,721
If I were to design the perfect
outlaw band...

550
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,265
...this is the gang I'd create.

551
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:18,936
So, what can you tell me?

552
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:22,064
It's going to be a long winter.

553
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:34,868
Take this road! Come on!

554
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:41,124
- Come on, boys! Come on!
- Let's go!

555
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:46,547
Come on, boys!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

556
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:25,377
- I never thought they would give up.
- They were admirably persistent.

557
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,462
Longest chase we've had.

558
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:30,591
- Jesse, we gotta have a word.
- Sure.

559
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:34,553
The newspapers call us
the James-Younger gang.

560
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:35,971
Yes.

561
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:40,601
Why not "Younger-James gang"?
We got three Youngers and two James.

562
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,103
I like the James-Younger gang.

563
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:46,148
I'll beat the piss out of you.
Stay out!

564
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:50,360
Jimmy's got a point.
The Younger-James gang is confusing.

565
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:54,781
- How's that, Bob?
- Say we burst into a bank and yell...

566
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:57,659
..."We're the Younger-James gang!"

567
00:51:57,868 --> 00:52:00,662
People will think,
"Younger-James gang?

568
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:05,167
Is there an older James gang?
How come we never heard of them?"

569
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,962
They'll think about that instead
of raising their arms.

570
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:14,426
- Can't argue.
- Do we even have the same mama?

571
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:17,804
Is anybody hearing me?
I got a little idea.

572
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:21,642
If I kill you, then Jim,
I'm gonna have no argument.

573
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:27,814
Pinkerton, it's been eight months.
I see holdups and I see robberies.

574
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:30,192
I don't see men on nooses.

575
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:34,404
The James gang's encounters
have been with local law.

576
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:36,698
They're no match for the gang.

577
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:41,745
- What about your detectives?
- Listen, you! Shut up.

578
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:48,377
I have to hunt this man.

579
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:52,422
I have to get inside this man's mind.

580
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:55,759
I have to anticipate him.

581
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,636
And that takes time.

582
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:01,557
Time, time, time.
Oh, I can't believe this.

583
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:04,184
Would you believe there are towns...

584
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:07,980
...where the James gang walks openly,
as heroes?

585
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:12,317
- Now, how can that be?
- Because they are charitable.

586
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:16,613
Give money to churches, to farmers.

587
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:21,243
They gave Maddox sharecroppers
enough money to build a school.

588
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:25,205
- That's my money!
- We should burn that school down.

589
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:27,374
That's the way to win them
back to our side.

590
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:33,881
Pinkerton, hundreds of men have died
to build this railroad.

591
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,593
But they did their jobs.

592
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:41,722
Now, this Jesse James,
that's your job.

593
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:43,515
Do your job.

594
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:45,767
Then you let me do my job...

595
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:49,396
...as I see fit, without interference.

596
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:54,276
- What can you tell me?
- It's going to be a long spring.

597
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:59,948
If people would hand it over and not
shoot, there'd be less killing.

598
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:07,497
- What's that?
- It's my lucky rabbit's foot.

599
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:11,835
- Took it off that dead fella.
- That one's not working.

600
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:13,587
What?

601
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:17,883
Can I have your autograph?

602
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:22,262
Take this to the West.

603
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:26,058
Grogan, you take this.
Take these towns.

604
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:30,812
- You remind me of...
- I can't write this.

605
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:35,025
Your blue-green eyes remind me...

606
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:39,112
...of the land and the sky.
- That's it.

607
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:45,202
You might want to change that to
"I thought of you."

608
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:49,581
Look, just write the whole thing
yourself.

609
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:26,994
I think we know how this is gonna go.

610
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:30,163
One false move and I'll
blow your head off!

611
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,000
- Bob?
- You heard me, Jesse!

612
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,087
You know how crazy I get! Crazy!

613
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:42,092
- Bob.
- We got a problem, little brother?

614
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:43,594
Frankly, yeah.

615
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:48,932
- I'm feeling a little left out.
- It's the wanted posters, right?

616
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:54,229
Yeah. Obviously, someone's not
standing out in people's minds.

617
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:57,816
Gents, we're in the middle
of something.

618
00:55:58,066 --> 00:56:00,110
- Bob's upset.
- The posters?

619
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:03,822
- Yeah.
- Don't say "yeah" in that tone.

620
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:06,783
- This is important!
- Okay.

621
00:56:06,992 --> 00:56:12,372
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had
to get Mad Bob Younger under control.

622
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:15,918
Yeah, Bob here will kill a man
for sneezing.

623
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,463
- He's our best shot.
- Better than you, Jesse?

624
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,093
Bob Younger taught me how to shoot.

625
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:27,262
Now...

626
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:30,349
...how about we get back
to the robbery?

627
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:34,895
- Of course.
- That means now, mister!

628
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:38,315
Now.

629
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,861
- That's it, no more bets.
- One more time. Come on, talk to me!

630
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:47,407
Talk to me, one more time!
Pretty please!

631
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:51,620
- Damn, Loni, you're lucky.
- Luckiest man in the West...

632
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:55,249
...now that I'm riding
with Jesse James!

633
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:02,172
- You okay, Jesse?
- Drinking whiskey? You're too young.

634
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:07,636
Not too young to shoot a man,
not too young to drink whiskey.

635
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:16,186
Jim, you been with a girl yet?

636
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:21,275
Tonight? I was just getting ready
to go turn on that Younger charm.

637
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:24,945
Not exactly.

638
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:29,116
- Been with a girl ever?
- Yeah, I've been with a girl!

639
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:37,249
I didn't want to get one of them
paid ladies. You know what I mean?

640
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:38,959
I think so.

641
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:41,670
You and Frank, Cole, even Bob...

642
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:45,340
...you get girls because
you're handsome and famous.

643
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:48,719
They look at me like
I'm your baby brother.

644
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:56,226
- But don't tell nobody.
- No, I swear. Not a word.

645
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:02,232
- You okay?
- Tell you what...

646
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:05,444
...I can't drink good neither.

647
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:09,781
- I'm gonna go outside and throw up.
- You do that. Hurry.

648
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:13,952
- Hey, Loni.
- Oh, yeah.

649
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:15,871
Let's go, sugar-britches.

650
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:19,708
Just call me Lucky Loni Packwood.

651
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:23,170
- The new rail route is complete, sir.
- Parker?

652
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,714
- Yes, sir?
- What's that?

653
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:31,470
That, sir?
Jenkins will explain that.

654
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:34,848
- Sir.
- Jenkins.

655
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:38,727
Yes, well, we have done
a financial study...

656
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:41,980
...of the construction costs...
- Jenkins!

657
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:46,860
It's cheaper to go around
Jesse James, sir.

658
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:51,073
Even with the detours
and the extra track...

659
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:55,035
...it's just cheaper.

660
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:04,002
So you're telling me that
Jesse James has won?

661
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:06,421
Oh, no.

662
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:10,926
No, no, no. See, every three months
the James gang...

663
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:14,263
...circles back to
Liberty, Missouri...

664
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:17,766
...and they pull a job beforehand.
- So?

665
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:22,437
There's only four banks within
that radius they've not robbed.

666
00:59:23,272 --> 00:59:26,441
- Could you put men at all four?
- Don't have to.

667
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:31,029
I have a better tool at my disposal
for narrowing it down to one.

668
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:36,201
- What's that?
- An intense hatred of you.

669
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,873
Jesse.

670
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:45,669
Things a fella's gotta do
to get some respect.

671
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:50,340
- You deserve it, Bob. It's about time.
- Thank you.

672
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:56,471
Listen, Jesse, we got a problem.
It's Cole.

673
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,893
- He's been full of vinegar lately.
- He's planning a job.

674
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:06,398
- He's what?
- I don't wanna start trouble.

675
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:09,568
- Tell me.
- Cole, are you sure?

676
01:00:09,776 --> 01:00:13,614
- It'll be the biggest score yet.
- What will be?

677
01:00:15,324 --> 01:00:17,701
Hyperion Bank, two days' ride.

678
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:22,539
- Got $100,000 in railroad money.
- That's all there? Don't sound right.

679
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:26,835
- Lf you read it first, you'd be fine.
- What are you saying?

680
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:32,674
I've robbed as many banks as you.
I know this bank. It's an easy job.

681
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:36,011
- You're forgetting who's in charge!
- Jesse.

682
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:42,100
You're in charge? Huh?
We ain't partners no more, Jesse?

683
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,646
You tell Cole Younger
when and where to ride?

684
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:48,524
- He didn't mean that.
- Siding against me?

685
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:54,947
Being with me is being against you?
We don't wanna do that.

686
01:00:55,155 --> 01:01:01,745
None of us idiots wanna go against
Jesse James, the greatest outlaw ever!

687
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:06,500
Paper says without you, we wouldn't
find a goat's ass with a stick!

688
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:10,754
- You've been full of yourself lately.
- You think so?

689
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:13,257
You all do?

690
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:17,219
Frank?

691
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,431
- One of us gets an idea...
- A bad idea!

692
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:24,601
- I got us through the war.
- And nearly got hanged.

693
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,979
- That's it!
- Cole!

694
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:45,122
Boys, we don't want this!

695
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:48,333
- I'm a better soldier!
- I'm a better outlaw.

696
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,335
You both hate the railroad!

697
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:53,297
Do it, and Rains never
comes west again!

698
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:55,632
- What?
- It's his money!

699
01:01:55,883 --> 01:02:00,012
He's paying out of his own fortune!
You wanna hurt him?

700
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:03,682
- Put your guns down!
- I still don't like it!

701
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:08,353
- Let me run the show, General Lee!
- Jesse.

702
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:11,648
Jesse!

703
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,904
You want it?

704
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:21,700
All right.

705
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,161
We hit this bank.

706
01:02:31,376 --> 01:02:35,464
You'll be smiling once you got
that money in your pocket.

707
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:42,971
Cole Younger's gonna make
everyone rich!

708
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:18,423
Hands in the air!
We're robbing this bank.

709
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:23,053
Do what you're told, nobody dies.
Hands up!

710
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:36,233
Oh, no.

711
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:49,955
Down!

712
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:33,749
- Which one should I shoot first?
- None.

713
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:37,044
Jesse, you all right?

714
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:44,134
Head for the end of the street!

715
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,930
- Look!
- Damn.

716
01:04:54,311 --> 01:04:56,855
Son of a bitch!

717
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,359
Move, go on!

718
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:06,156
- Dozen out back.
- They gonna rush us?

719
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:09,201
They're insurance, in case we run.

720
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:14,623
Get inside! Get inside! Get in!

721
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,795
Any ideas, little brother?

722
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:25,467
Oh, Lord.

723
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,579
Oh, Lord.

724
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:16,101
Oh, shit! Let's get!

725
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:32,618
Fire!

726
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,392
Damn!

727
01:06:59,895 --> 01:07:02,356
Go, boys! Come on!

728
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:08,070
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on, boys!

729
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,113
Come on!

730
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,541
Jimmy!

731
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:37,432
Easy. Easy.

732
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,107
Rest here.

733
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,568
Get some bandages and whiskey.

734
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:51,738
- Too young for whiskey.
- We'll make an exception.

735
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:54,533
Hey, little brother.
I'm sorry.

736
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:57,369
All right, Jim? I'm sorry.

737
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:01,123
It was the best time of my life.

738
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:06,461
I was famous, you know?

739
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:08,338
Yeah.

740
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:40,871
- He was just a kid.
- He was old enough.

741
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:44,791
A boy riding with the most famous
outlaws in the West.

742
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:47,085
How could he say no to that?

743
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:52,174
Railroad burned him out too.
You couldn't stop him.

744
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:56,887
You're a piss-poor liar
for the smartest man I know.

745
01:08:57,638 --> 01:09:03,143
A war against the railroad.
What the hell was I thinking?

746
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:07,314
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

747
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:10,734
- I'm out.
- You're out?

748
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:16,823
Blood gets spilled,
you're just gonna quit?

749
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:19,201
Who's next, Cole?

750
01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:23,288
You? Me? Bob?

751
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:27,251
- Can't go back, Jesse.
- I ain't telling you what to do.

752
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:30,379
Keep riding with Cole,
that's fine by me.

753
01:09:30,629 --> 01:09:32,589
Frank?

754
01:09:36,218 --> 01:09:38,512
Get the hell out of here, then.

755
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:43,600
Don't come back when you find
you can't farm with a six-gun!

756
01:10:23,974 --> 01:10:25,601
Jesse.

757
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:32,566
What are you thinking?
There are lawmen all over.

758
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:36,069
I had to see you.
I'm getting married.

759
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,614
I don't understand.

760
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:45,078
The most wonderful woman in the world.
I can't stop thinking about her.

761
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:50,834
Zee, I've quit my outlaw ways.

762
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:57,674
Come live in my home,
and in my heart.

763
01:10:58,133 --> 01:11:00,928
Be my wife.

764
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:13,690
Is that a yes?

765
01:11:21,907 --> 01:11:24,451
I never would've imagined us here.

766
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,956
That's why I picked it.
We can start a new life here.

767
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:33,502
Will you be happy in Florida,
without the excitement?

768
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:36,964
I've got you.
You keep me busy.

769
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:39,967
We can go to the hotel, check in...

770
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:44,179
...then do something I've wanted
to do for a long time.

771
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:48,809
Wait a minute. Certain things wait
until after the wedding.

772
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:53,897
Driver, change of plans.
Take us to the nearest church.

773
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:57,484
"Jesse Woodson James."

774
01:11:57,734 --> 01:12:01,488
Jesse James.
The Jesse James?

775
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:05,742
I could lie, but I want this marriage
to be legal.

776
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:09,705
I'm starting a new life
so I'm depending on your...

777
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:11,623
- Discretion?
- Discretion.

778
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,377
- Sir, I'm a man of the cloth...
- Well, thank you.

779
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:19,673
...who needs to repair
a leaky church roof.

780
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,760
Of course.

781
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:29,141
Now let's have a drink.

782
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:32,603
- In the church?
- Communion!

783
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:34,104
Have a good day.

784
01:12:35,105 --> 01:12:38,609
Hands in the air!
This is a robbery! Move!

785
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:40,569
The safe, now!

786
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:43,488
Of course!

787
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:49,286
- Sir?
- What?

788
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:52,164
Where's Jesse James?

789
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:55,667
This here is the Younger gang!
Understand?

790
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:59,338
But the Youngers ride
with Jesse James.

791
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:02,049
You wanna die?

792
01:13:02,633 --> 01:13:06,762
Did ride. No more.
You understand?

793
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:11,016
- The safe, now! All right?
- All right.

794
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:14,019
Jesse James never
went around yelling.

795
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:43,048
This is the best score yet!

796
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:45,884
Taking too long.
People used to snap to.

797
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:49,805
Well, that was because of J...
The gang's reputation.

798
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:53,767
If people think Jesse's riding,
we won't get respect.

799
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:57,813
We're outlaws.
Not exactly the most respectable job.

800
01:13:58,063 --> 01:14:01,900
Bob, leave me alone.
All right? Go on.

801
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:07,281
What?

802
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:11,243
"The life of the James gang
wasn't all killing.

803
01:14:11,535 --> 01:14:15,038
These young bucks
had a taste for the ladies...

804
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:18,876
...especially the handsome,
charismatic Jesse James."

805
01:14:19,209 --> 01:14:20,460
Beg your pardon?

806
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:24,256
"Blazing Guns of the West.
True Stories of Jesse James."

807
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:27,384
- Only a dime in the hotel.
- Let me see.

808
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:29,428
I'm not finished.

809
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,349
"When he sauntered into a saloon,
his spurs jangling...

810
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:38,812
...Ladies flocked to him
like flies to a candied apple."

811
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:40,272
As I said, hmm.

812
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:43,817
Now, sweetie...

813
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:48,071
...you don't believe them silly
dime novels, do you?

814
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:53,243
Swimming.

815
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:55,954
Swimming is good.

816
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:20,938
Don't turn around.

817
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:23,023
What?

818
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:27,653
If you don't see it,
then it's not real.

819
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:34,034
Jesse James!

820
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,416
You're under arrest!

821
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:59,810
They arrested Jesse!

822
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:05,816
- What have you done?
- What's that, Bob?

823
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:08,944
What have you done, Cole?

824
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:12,114
- I ain't done nothing, Bob.
- Swear.

825
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:19,746
Swear on Jimmy's grave.

826
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:30,299
Bob, you know Cole would never
do such a thing.

827
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:33,385
He and Jesse are best friends.

828
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:37,848
Cousins. Blood brothers.

829
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:41,518
Bob.

830
01:16:57,326 --> 01:17:00,329
I'm sorry, Cole.

831
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:35,697
- We're moving you tomorrow.
- But I like the presidential suite.

832
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:40,827
You'll get a similar room,
but the hotel's in Washington, D.C.

833
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:46,458
You won't get a fair trial here,
with a jury of James sympathizers.

834
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:50,170
- So I get a jury bought off by Rains?
- That's it.

835
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:54,967
- Did you order our houses burned down?
- Not that day.

836
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:57,469
I'm guilty of many things...

837
01:17:57,678 --> 01:18:03,684
...but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains
and Parker.

838
01:18:06,144 --> 01:18:10,274
- This was you, by the way.
- You almost ended my career.

839
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:12,860
Pity.

840
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:17,531
We're gonna hang you, you know.

841
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:20,450
Yeah, I figured.

842
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:23,412
Was it worth it?

843
01:18:24,037 --> 01:18:27,958
- I should've killed Rains.
- That's what I'd have done.

844
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:30,460
Well, I'm not hanged yet.

845
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:34,631
You cocky little bastard!

846
01:18:36,049 --> 01:18:38,343
Oh, you'll miss me.

847
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:42,973
No. I'll hang you.

848
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:46,560
But I may miss you a little bit.

849
01:18:58,697 --> 01:19:00,407
Come on, you!

850
01:19:02,743 --> 01:19:04,953
So this is he.

851
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:06,413
I remember you.

852
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:09,875
You're Parker. I remember you too.

853
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:13,921
- You killed my ma.
- How did you know?

854
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:16,924
Not such a menace now, is he?

855
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:20,177
Well, I could always
take off his irons.

856
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:25,098
You cost me millions and months
of delays in construction.

857
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:29,228
I wish I could hang you
every morning for a century.

858
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:33,106
How do you like that?

859
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:37,694
My father had it made
when he started this railroad.

860
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:42,950
I'll give it to my son,
and he'll give it to his son.

861
01:19:43,242 --> 01:19:48,789
The right sort of men will always
run this country. Not your sort.

862
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:53,877
You'll always suffer.
And you haven't changed anything.

863
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:57,548
I made you think twice
about burning homes down.

864
01:19:57,798 --> 01:20:01,718
- We'll speak in Washington.
- You're on the same train?

865
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:07,307
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna have to pay you a visit.

866
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:10,394
- Big words.
- It's a promise.

867
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:13,146
Get him on board.

868
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:17,860
Open up!

869
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:22,281
- Hook him up.
- Come with me, boy.

870
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,834
Take him back.

871
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:37,129
Now, your guns.

872
01:20:37,546 --> 01:20:40,632
I don't like it.
We can handle him.

873
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:46,680
In the last 10 seconds, he could've
grabbed your gun at least three times!

874
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:50,392
If he lays a finger
on one of your guns...

875
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:55,272
...you are all, and I mean all,
dead men!

876
01:20:55,939 --> 01:20:57,900
He's chained up.

877
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:03,280
I'll put that on your tombstone.
Your guns!

878
01:21:52,371 --> 01:21:54,748
Give me two good cards.

879
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:58,293
Everybody, ante up.

880
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:01,588
Hey, stupid!

881
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,841
Yeah, you!

882
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:07,636
Glad to see you know your name,
you dumb shit!

883
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:17,312
- What are you saying, boy?
- I recognize you.

884
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:19,064
How?

885
01:22:19,273 --> 01:22:22,776
You left by the front door
as I came in the back.

886
01:22:23,026 --> 01:22:26,280
You shut up now, boy!

887
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:32,160
Yeah. Your wife said
you did that to her too.

888
01:22:33,203 --> 01:22:35,330
Will this shut you up?

889
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:37,708
I can do this without the gun.

890
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,377
It just makes things easier.

891
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,222
What the hell is that?

892
01:23:33,472 --> 01:23:38,185
Vengeance!
Outside! Get up on the roof!

893
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:41,688
You stay put, gentlemen.

894
01:24:20,686 --> 01:24:24,189
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

895
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:27,192
Now go get my husband!

896
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:45,627
- There's only four of them!
- Move, you fools! Move!

897
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:53,320
Come quickly! This way.

898
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:05,332
Do it!

899
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:14,633
That was for my ma.
This is for everybody else.

900
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:17,344
No, they'll set the Army on you!

901
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:21,223
You and your wife.

902
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:37,197
That is a nice watch you got there.
Hand it over.

903
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:41,410
If I can get you today...

904
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:46,415
...then you damn sure know
I can kill you anytime I want.

905
01:26:46,623 --> 01:26:50,627
Sleep on that for the next 20 years.
Give it to me!

906
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:05,184
Hands up, now!

907
01:27:11,064 --> 01:27:13,275
Tennessee.

908
01:27:13,567 --> 01:27:16,111
The railroad has no business there.

909
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,866
Therefore I have no interest
in the state of Tennessee.

910
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:24,203
Thank you.

911
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:26,872
I'd just as soon kill you...

912
01:27:27,331 --> 01:27:31,001
...but chasing you takes up
too much of my time.

913
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:33,378
Fair enough.

914
01:27:33,587 --> 01:27:35,881
Jesse James?

915
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,431
Come on, let's ride!

916
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:05,077
- Get arrested again, I'll kill you.
- Yes, ma'am.

917
01:28:05,327 --> 01:28:08,580
- I blew up a train.
- You're a hell of a woman.

918
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:11,959
- Don't swear!
- Yes, ma'am.

919
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:23,303
- I missed you, cousin.
- I missed you too.

920
01:28:23,554 --> 01:28:25,264
You know...

921
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:29,935
...when you got caught, they thought
I had something to do with it.

922
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:32,646
- Never crossed my mind.
- Good.

923
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:35,899
Things changed when you quit the gang.

924
01:28:36,108 --> 01:28:39,194
- Now I say, "Let's ride."
- He ain't bad at it.

925
01:28:39,695 --> 01:28:42,573
- It's tough.
- Where'd you get the riders?

926
01:28:42,823 --> 01:28:46,577
We didn't. Zerelda did.
She makes a hell of an outlaw.

927
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:49,329
So, what's the plan, Jesse?

928
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:51,665
- We're gonna buy a farm.
- Farm?

929
01:28:51,832 --> 01:28:55,502
- Down in Tennessee.
- All right.

930
01:28:57,588 --> 01:29:01,258
Want to ride with the Younger gang
for a while?

931
01:29:01,508 --> 01:29:03,218
Bye, boys.

932
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,804
Tom.

933
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:10,309
- Tennessee, huh?
- Yeah, I think so.

934
01:29:10,517 --> 01:29:15,063
- Meet you there in a couple weeks.
- I'll see you soon.

935
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:21,111
- Thanks for that distraction.
- Hell, they hardly noticed us.

936
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:23,947
- Mrs. James?
- Shall we?

937
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,700
Shall we, indeed. Frank. Rangers.

938
01:29:26,992 --> 01:29:29,453
- Tennessee?
- I'll explain on the way.

939
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:32,080
All right, boys.

940
01:29:33,332 --> 01:29:36,168
Let's ride!

941
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:38,921
- When were you gonna tell me?
- I did.

942
01:29:39,129 --> 01:29:40,380
Because I asked.

943
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:45,177
- Damn, am I ever gonna win with you?
- Don't change the subject.
