"  HEADMASTER: Lights out! WOMAN: Cletus, are you there? CLETUS: My angel. This is for you. What did the doctor say? He said the mutations are advancing. My powers are too strong. Cletus, I'm scared. CLETUS: It's gonna be okay. They're coming to take me away.  They're sending me to a place where there are others like me. They can't do that.  They can't take you from me. You're my one bright light. I will always love you! CLETUS: Frances!  FRANCES : Get off! Frances! CLETUS: No! No!   Any last words?      Welcome to your new home, Frances.      DR. PAZZO: Your old boyfriend's finally getting what he deserves. And the world will be a safer place without him. EDDIE: Detective Mulligan, with all due respect, I don't want anything to do with Cletus Kasady. MULLIGAN: Well, that's too bad, because he only wants to see you. Though, in my opinion, you had your chance with Kasady and you blew it. Right, um, so... what does he want? Maybe he wants to spill the beans about where the missing bodies are buried. So you're gonna have to do the right thing for a change.   VENOM: No! Take your tiny hands off of me! We should be out there protecting the city lethally! -  -   What was that? Unhand me! Man should never consent to crawl when he has the impulse to fly. You are a bottom-feeder.  Be quiet. How many times have I told you that I want you to hide yourself when I am working? I am serious. It is important. You have to show me respect. - Respect? Respect? - Yes. Yes. - Okay. - Okay. Kasady gonna give you the scoop, right? - Right. - Wrong. - What do you mean? - Because you blow everything. Oh, okay, I see. You're talking about Anne again. I miss her! I will do it. I don't like you. VENOM: Let me eat him! You do not deserve nice things.  CLETUS: Welcome back, Eddie Brock. I've been thinking about you. What do you want, Cletus? I mean, why am I here? Do a man who's buried alive a kindness, won't you? Get a message out to all my... fans. And in return, I'll give you my life. What? Story. I heard the written word hasn't been working out so well. Piece like this, an exclusive...  ...would put you back on top. Go on. People love... serial killers. All my secrets laid bare, Eddie. So much carnage. But why me?  I like you. All right, it's a deal.  What's your message?  That distant cathedral - is all I see... - Mm-hmm. ...fractured angel the other part of me. Print that in your column. Is that it? This, um... Who's gonna... Who's gonna read that, some random haiku? Print it, and what's mine is yours. Wow, lucky me. Goodbye, Eddie. Thank you. Thank you. VENOM: What a dick. Eddie, look. Look. EDDIE : What are you doing? VENOM: Your job for you. CLETUS: Eddie. Don't forget me, Eddie.  What did you get? Uh, I got a headache and probably got tuberculosis. What? A little louder.  He read me poetry, man. Is this some kind of joke to you, Eddie? Because I'm not laughing. VENOM: Yeah, you could do with a laugh. Come on, man. These things, they just take a little time, all right? Well, the second he gives you something... Of course. Keep me ahead of the curve, Eddie. - Don't embarrass me. - All right. -  - Do you understand? EDDIE: Trust me, the only scoop I'm getting today is double chocolate chip. VENOM: No! I get brain freeze.  VENOM: Come here. Look. - I'm looking. - Grab those. All right. Whoa. Okay.  VENOM: Now, what do you think? - I think I'm Pablo Picasso. - No! - Okay. - Come here. Look.  - Well, say what you see. - Uh, it's a house. VENOM: Never mind. Oh, I know this one. - It's a tree. - Idiot. Sit down. Now, pay attention. VENOM: Bingo. Holy cow.  REPORTER: Would you say your friendship with Cletus Kasady is what allowed you to solve this decades-old mystery? You are the only person from the outside world he's spoken with. Seems he likes you. Well, you know, he's a serial killer. I don't see how he can like anyone. REPORTER : Brock was able to uncover what the FBI and police could not. Bowing to public outrage, the governor of California has overturned his moratorium and reinstated the death penalty for Kasady.   Brock's career has been given a much-needed revival, putting him back on top once more.   REPORTER 2: A harrowing story finally comes to an end. Vindication for the victims and closure for the families. Thanks to the diligence of one man. - Thank you, Eddie Brock. - VENOM: And Venom. You know, this could be us, Eddie. Going out there, solving cases, fighting bad guys. Maybe I eat them, hmm? And then we save the day. EDDIE: But we saved the day. It's done.  You said I could eat bad guys! -  - This again? I need to be free, feeling the wind in my hair and the sand between my toes. You don't have any hair. You are not listening to me. Oh, I'm listening. I cannot live like this anymore. - I'm starving. - So eat those guys. - VENOM: I can't. -  Sonny and Cher are best friends. EDDIE: Are you serious? That's ridiculous. That's what...  Man, that was abusive. That was abuse.  And that's a $2,000 TV. You have got to get control of your aggression. That is why we have Snookie! I cannot live on chicken and chocolate alone. I need brains. Chickens have brains. I most passionately disagree. Look. Look at those poor idiots.  Small brains. Come on, man, it's not their fault that you, uh... you live on the old phenylethyla... - laphenylethylan. - Phenylethylalanine. Yeah, I just... I just said that. I've told you a thousand times, - because it is only found... - Yeah? - ...in brains and in chocolate. - And in chocolate. That's right. All right, well, how about this? You live in my body, you live by my rules. - I live in your body because... - Why? ...unfortunately, I don't have many options. Well, how about this, son? The FBI is still investigating us for all of that stuff that ""we were involved with,"" so if one more head goes missing, we will get hauled off into Area 51. They will kill us both. So somebody has to be responsible. Responsibility... it's for the mediocre. - Food! - Can you stop doing that? - Food! Food! - Please just stop doing that now. - Come on, stop doing that. - Food! - I have a deadline! Will you... - Food...! Goddamn it! Fine!   - Good evening, Eddie. - Hey, Mrs. Chen. - Good evening, Venom. -  EDDIE: He says hi. Oh. MRS. CHEN: Chocolate hasn't arrived yet. - VENOM: No! - Oh, no. We have a deal. What's gonna happen? You gonna stop protecting me? I don't think so. I've been keeping my mouth shut, - feeding your little secret. - Wow. Little old Mrs. Chen is a little old blackmailer, huh? Less of the old. I am 39. - VENOM: And I am Barry Manilow. - Right. VENOM: I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen. No, no, you cannot eat Mrs. Chen. - What? - Well, I guess it's gonna have to be plan B. What's plan B? - Aah! Not this again! -  I need human brains to survive. EDDIE: Uh-uh. Now, pick up some chickens, man. Let's go.     I'm done with this grossness. Look at all the amazing things that we can do. We are wasting our talent.  Bad guy. - VENOM: Hello, kitty. -  EDDIE: Leave him. Leave him be. - Leave him be! Leave him be! -  - I shall remove your head. - EDDIE: No, you won't. - I will use it for bowling! - No, you will not. VENOM: I will take it to... What is the one that we like, Eddie? EDDIE: It's Lucky Strike. - Yes! Lucky Strike! - EDDIE: Put him down! I will take you to Lucky Strike, and I will score a 300-point game. - EDDIE: You won't. - The rest of your pudgy little - boy body will be left here... -  ...rolling around in dumpster juice. - EDDIE: Oh, God. -  No! Put him down! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, - no, no, no, no, no, no! -  EDDIE: No! VENOM: Fine! EDDIE: She didn't want our help. She did not know she needed our help, Eddie. There is a difference.  VENOM: It is Anne. - Anne is on the phone, Eddie! -  Hey, Anne. ANNE: Hey, E-Eddie. Hi. - Hi. - VENOM: Be nice to her. ANNE: You sound out of breath. I'm-I'm not catching you at a bad time, am I? No, no, not at all. I'm just, uh... - I'm just hanging around. - Okay. Uh, I'm-I'm sorry I haven't returned your calls. I guess... I just needed a little space after the whole... alien biting a guy's head off thing, so... VENOM: Ah, the good old days. Anyway, so I have some news, and-and I was wondering if we could meet. - VENOM: Yes! - Yeah, sure, that would be, uh... That would be fine. Great. Okay, great. Uh, how's tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Yeah, great. - 8:00? - L'Araigne? - Okay, great. - Looking forward to it. Oh... Yeah, okay. Me, too. Bye. Great. VENOM: It's over with the doctor! That is the voice of a woman - who just got brutally dumped. -   All right    Yeah...  Stop. VENOM: Don't you want to look your best? Just leave me alone. You are always nitpicking.  Wow.  Hey. Hey. -  Okay. Hi. - Yeah. Wow. VENOM: Awkward. So, uh, h-how's it going? How's, uh... - How's Mr. Belvedere? Yeah. - Uh, good, good. You know, he's still wiping his ass on the carpet. - He learned that from you. -  Yeah, how-how's, uh... how's the legal aid work going? Well, you know how much I love an underdog, so... Yeah. Yeah, that's why you... put up with me for so long, huh? You said it. - S-So... - So... VENOM: So? I don't know, I-I thought it would be better to tell you in person that... Uh-huh. VENOM: No! Wow. Oh, Anne. Wow, that is, uh... that is so much bigger than the... the one that I got you. VENOM: Ugh, it's gaudy. That's Dan, right? Doc-Doctor Dan. Yeah, that... it's Dan. Holy shit, Anne. Way to go. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. - VENOM: Well, I am not okay. - Yeah. You could just say, ""Congratulations. I'm happy for you."" You know, like two people who still care enough about each other to lie so that the other one doesn't feel like complete shit. I... Maybe we could do that version of this? No, I am... I am happy for you, Anne. - You know, I'm, uh... - VENOM: No. Congratulations. Thank you. VENOM: That was going to be us, Eddie. I, for one, would not be inconsolable if Dan were to fall into traffic and lose his head and his feet - and all of his teeth! - What? What was that? What? Nothing. Whoa. If I ask you a question, do you have the ability to tell me the truth? You mean as in being super happy for you because of your engagement? Because, I mean, you just told me to lie, so that's really, really confusing. Is Venom with you? He's dead. VENOM: I am. I'm playing dead right now. Yeah, I mean, he... - Right. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Well, that's... You just don't change, do you? What are you talking about? This is just a... It's a huge shock. Um, I'm in... Anne, I'm in love with you. This is a lot to process. No, the truth is you don't love anybody. You can't. Commitment's just not your thing. All right, then, fine. Do not marry Dan. - Dan makes me feel safe. - Ugh. Okay, and you made me feel like I was on a roller coaster. And sometimes you just have to know when to get off. - Yeah, and not yak. - VENOM: And not yak! You know, not yak. Yak. ANNE: Hey, Venom. Take care of him, all right? Don't let him keep messing everything up. VENOM: I'm going to make you cry now, Eddie. She will love it. Cry. Cry. It's a lot to process.  Congratulations, Anne. It's great news.   VENOM: Slow down, pal. EDDIE: Why? You don't believe in consequences. No injuries. You fix them. No hangovers. You mend them. I couldn't even hurt myself if I tried. -  -  VENOM: Eddie, I apologize that I can't mend the heart. Emotional pain, it hits much harder, and it lasts longer. You just need to pull up your big-boy pants and take it. Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say. Why? Because I'm a real boy and you're just an amoeba. VENOM: I will only take that because we are hurting right now.  Don't worry, buddy. I will get you through this. Do you know what always cheers me up in the morning, Eddie?  Sausages and brains.  VENOM:  I say ""ee-ther"" And I say ""eye-ther""   I say ""nee-ther""   Ee-ther, eye-ther Nee-ther, ny-ther   Let's call The whole thing off  Ow! Ow, ow. Ouch. Ow.  Po-tah-toes   I like to-may-toes And I like to-mah-to   Po-tay-toes, po-tah-toes To-may-toes, to-mah-toes   Let's call The whole thing off  Cheer up, old pal.  And, oh, if we call We call the whole thing off  -  Then we must part  -  That's for you.   So if I like pa-jam-as   And you like pa-jah-mas   I'll wear pa-jam-as...  VENOM: Are you pen pals with an ant? Whoa, listen to this. ""Dearest pally pal, ""I hereby invite you to witness ""my demise, ""my final moments ""on this spinning shit wheel that we call Earth."" CLETUS : You are responsible for bringing about the end of Cletus Kasady. It's only right that you hold the door for me on my way out. - They'll stop my heart... -  ...just like it stopped at my birth.  What if Cletus Kasady - had never been revived? -  He would never have pushed Grandma - down a flight of stairs. -  Bye-bye, Grandma, you puckered old sphincter. He would never have thrown a hair dryer - into Mother's bathtub. -  -  -  - Yes, Mama, I'm a bad, bad boy. -  He would never have been beaten to the brink of death by Daddy-o - and sent to... -  St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children.  That circus of hell...   ...with one bright light. Oh, Eddie, we are all born into this world through blood and pain. Every hero has an origin story. Your friend... EDDIE : ""Cletus Kasady."" Kiss, hug, kiss, hug. Smiley face. Ew. VENOM: Nutjob. You know, I-I should be there. Uh, no, it's a bad idea. I mean, I-I-I put him there. Actually, he put himself there when he decided to be a complete lunatic. Ta-da! You know, it would be nice just to have your support just... I mean, just for once. - Catsup? - You know what I mean? VENOM: This place is an all-you-can-eat buffet. Who's going to care if I polish off a couple of these idiots? EDDIE: You can't be sure who is and who is not guilty, buddy. - VENOM: They're in prison! - EDDIE: Yeah, but, you know, some people take false confessions. They, uh... you know, they take pleas. We watched Making a Murderer. You all right? Yeah, man, I'm just practicing. VENOM: I am a predator, Eddie. - Mm-hmm. - Lions do not eat salad. Yeah, but you're not a lion, are you? I mean, I see you more of a vexatious little pig, dog, house bat thing. That's fine. - VENOM: You suck. - You suck! - Excuse me? - EDDIE: Yeah, wow. I don't have an explanation for that. I think I just... I'm having a panic attack, um... Yeah, I'll sign here. Stand two feet away from the bars. No touching the condemned. Understood. - Visitor's here. -   This is a ""me"" thing, not a ""we"" thing. VENOM: Everything is a ""you"" thing. CLETUS: Oh, happy day for you, Eddie Brock. -  - Mm, what a scoop. The end of the Magical... Misery Tour. I worry for your soul. How will you live with the weight of snuffing out a man's life? I was, uh... I was hoping maybe you could give me a couple pointers.  Funny little guy, aren't you? -  - VENOM: Don't need that. My memory is outstanding. Rude. Consequences. Every decision you ever make. Who do we leave behind, and how do we leave them? A connubial bed, empty, waiting in the darkness for the rescuer who never comes. Because of you. VENOM: This guy makes zero sense. You and I are the same. No. No, we're not. Twisted insides, mean daddies. You feel like home to me, Eddie, like family. And really, truly, that is all I ever wanted in this world. Family. Well, killing your grandmother and your mother sure is a funny way of showing it. Anything you want to unburden yourself with before... ...um, this happens? Yes. I have wishes to bestow upon you. VENOM: Oh, that is kind. I want to wish you... this heartbreak. VENOM: Uh-oh. Too late. I wish for you to see out your days alone, as you always have been. VENOM: Watch it, pal. Wh-Where are you going with this? You are a cancer to everyone who ever loved you, Eddie. Deceived your trusting fiance. And no wonder Daddy could never look at you again after you killed his wife, your mother, just by being born. VENOM: You son of a bitch! No, no! No, no, no, don't! Don't! VENOM: Speak to my friend again like that... I dare you!  - Hey, hey! -  No touching the inmate. Hey, back up! Eddie? You're done. I have tasted blood before, my friend, and that is not it. Eddie Brock has a big secret. Shut up, Kasady! VENOM: That may have been a mistake. EDDIE: Shut up. Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock? I don't know anymore. VENOM: Eddie! EDDIE: I don't want to hear another word out your mouth. - VENOM: Eddie. - I don't want to hear it. VENOM: Eddie, I am sorry. EDDIE: That was his last time on record ever. There's no more... any words for his victims or... You know, they're gone. Any clues of outstanding bodies, we-we've lost forever and completely. - VENOM: I didn't mean to. -  - You didn't mean to? - And I said I'm sorry. You didn't mean to, but you did it. I mean, you just decided... I don't know.  That's it, you did it. You know, you didn't even think that we might get caught, we might get killed? No, you don't think about things like that, do you? You just think about chickens, you think about you, you think about what you want, and you think about you. Let me remind you of something, Eddie. You were a loser before I came along. You were nothing. I made you special. Oh, you made me special, huh? Well, let me tell you something, right? Before you came along, I had a life. I didn't have chickens, all right? But I had dreams. Yeah, I had dreams, and I had a fiance, and I had a really successful TV show! Ah, but you destroyed all of those things by yourself. Yeah, but you know what? I rebuilt my life, and now I just want to live it. Good night. And how did you build this new life? - Hmm? - Excuse me? Well, who found the clue on the wall so you could be this big, shiny hero? Hmm? Who found the clue? - Who? - Wow. Yeah. No, no, no. This is not about being a hero for me, man. This is about wanting to live in peace. D-Do you understand what I'm talking about? No, you don't. You don't understand what I'm talking about. Okay, this is about me wanting to live without you whining in my ear all the time about eating bad guys or, like, nagging me about Anne or destroying my place or destroying my life! Do you know how lucky you are that I chose you? You chose me? Buddy, I'm the only person that took you in when your friends kicked you off the planet Ming Mong 'cause you are a reject! You are a pariah. Lethal protection, my ass. You couldn't protect anything. You are useless. You couldn't get a job down here cleaning toilets! -  - I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. - Please, let me fix it. -  So I can break it again!  You son of a bitch.  -  - Out! Get out. Take your stuff. Get out! This is my house. -  - No! Keep it down up there!  VENOM: Get out!   -  - Sonny? You wouldn't dare! Yeah, absolutely. No, no, no! - VENOM: Yeah! - No! I'm calling the police! I-I am so sorry. Show yourself.    -  -  You can't win! Take a look at me. Look at the size of you. Puny. How dare you? I guess this is goodbye. Oh, yeah. Finally something we agree on. -  -  What in the world? All this crazy shit. VENOM: Yeah. -  -   -  - Hmm? -  - No. No. No, no, no, no. No! VENOM: Yeah! EDDIE: No! - Yeah! - No! Oh, yeah. No.   EDDIE: No, no, no. I wish I never met you!  VENOM: Sayonara!  WARDEN: Cletus Kasady, you have been tried, convicted and sentenced to death by the state of California. May your passing bring closure to the victims' families, and may you find peace in the hereafter. CLETUS: Soon come chaos. Chaos soon come. Are those your final words? Enjoy the show.    -  - Warden. Something wicked... this way comes.  - WARDEN: Somebody let me out! -  -  -       -  -  -  -  -  -         GUARD: Don't move!   PRISONER: Hey! -  -    Please. I got a family.     Any last words, Warden? Don't! Please!    San Quentin, may you rot And burn in hell   May your walls fall down And may I live to tell   And I'll walk out A wiser, stronger man   And, Warden You tasted just like ham    You two are being evicted.  Come on, don't look at me like that. It was never, never gonna work out. All right? Yes. COMMENTATOR: Just because of how quickly he moved in... -  - ...the offensive line cannot pick him up. REPORTER: Breaking news. Serial killer Cletus Kasady is on the run... Shit. ...as a statewide manhunt is underway... - Oh, shit. - ...after last night's audacious - escape from San Quentin Prison. -   REPORTER: It is absolutely chaos here. We have reports of multiple casualties. We don't how Cletus Kasady... - Hey. - What, you're not dead? No. - Can I come in? - Yeah, sure. Come on in. Uh, yeah, I was just seeing for myself on the news. Yeah, on a scale of one to ten, it's 11 bad. Reports coming from San Quentin are, quite frankly, bananas. Nice TV. W-Well, how-how did he do it? - Yeah, how did he, indeed? - Yeah. That's the million-dollar question. And yet again, you were his special visitor. So, what did he tell you? Me? Nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing about an escape plan? Nothing about some kind of elaborate breakout costume? No. Well, how come, every time, you seem to be at the center of these things and then miraculously you know nothing about it? Maybe I'm lucky. Yeah, right. You-you said, um...  ...the reports coming out of San Quentin are bananas? What-what do... what do you mean by ""bananas""? Remember when I asked you a similar question... - Uh-huh. - ...the day you interviewed him? Information is currency. You of all people should know that. Come on. I thought he'd come to try to find the man that nearly got him executed, but I guess not. I'd lay low if I was you. I'll see myself out.  EDDIE: Okay, think. Think, think, think, think, think. What would Venom do? He would find you before you find me, and he would eat your face! Damn. - All right. -  CLETUS : Who do we leave behind, and how do we leave them? - A connubial bed, empty... - ""Connubial bed."" - ...left to rot... - Is it marriage? What... ...waiting in the darkness for the rescuer who never comes. EDDIE: I don't understand. ""That circle of hell..."" CLETUS: Because of you. - You and I are the same. - ""With one bright light""? CLETUS: Twisted insides, mean daddies. EDDIE: ""Bright light."" CLETUS: You feel like home to me. - Like family. - EDDIE: St. Estes.   VENOM: Crapola! Another one bites the dust.  Look at all these weirdos. My kind of people. - Nice costume. - WOMAN: Hey! Awesome work. Greatest costume ever. Oh, my God. - Oh. - Is that Japanese? No, I made it myself. - WOMAN: Hey. - Who, me? Hello, gorgeous. Sorry, no, you're not my type. I am out of the Eddie closet.  Hello, darlin'. Ooh, racer red. Got to have it.  CARNAGE: Let's get this party started. -  -  Oh, hell yes. MAN: Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Stop! - Stop that! Stop! Stop! -  Ah, shit. - You are real. - CARNAGE: I am. And once I kill that thing that made me, we will be indestructible. I know where to find him, but first, I need you to help me find something I lost. - Deal. - Deal. -  -   My soul ascended to the sky It's just you and I   Gone, but I'm feeling Too alive...  Oh, yeah!  Dude.  I assume you'll be Coming for blood   That makes two of us   That makes two of us Venom...   Oh, yeah, bro! Tight!  Venom   Venom, venom, venom, venom   Follow me, follow me Follow me   Actually, don't follow me Nobody...    Thank you.  MAN : Oh, yeah! Oh, shit. Your costume is amazing! Thank you, one person.  Eddie was wrong.  He kept me hidden because he was ashamed.  But look at me now. You love me, and I'm free!  - Yeah! - VENOM: Yeah! Stop this cruel treatment of aliens. - It is wrong. -  All of us should be able to live together upon this ball of rock.  Yeah! Free to be who we be!  I love you! I love you, too.  - Yeah! - CROWD: Yeah! Lethal Protector out.   Whoa, that was a hard act to follow. I wish you could have seen me tonight...  ...Eddie.    Holy shit.  - Mulligan. - Uh, it's Eddie Brock here. Look, uh, this may be a long shot, but I-I think I may have found something. Go on, Eddie. What do you got? Last time I spoke to Kasady, he was talking to me about connubial beds and-and marriage. And, uh, it didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but, um, I'm here at St. Estes, and I found this, uh... Well, I'm standing in front of a... of a... of a tree, and I'm-I'm looking at it. It's, uh... it's got a carving on it. It says ""CK loves FB."" I'm thinking that maybe whoever this FB is might know where he's headed. And, uh... a-and if you can, I don't know, pull up some files from St. Estes, maybe you can figure out who this FB is. FB, that's, uh... that's Frances Barrison. Wow. That-that's quick. Yeah, it's impossible, Eddie. She's dead. I, uh... I shot her.      -  -      A living legend Intention his name   Don't get distracted...  -  -  Can I help you, sir?    Got any of those internets?  You're alive.  When I get out, I'm gonna slice your face off and wear it to a party! You're never getting out of here, Siegfried.  No one does.  Well, Frances, it seems your sweetheart has done a Houdini act over there at San Quentin. It's all over the news. Oh, don't get excited. He's not gonna find you. COMPUTER VOICE: Screw you. How flattering. But you're not my type. I wonder where he could be. COMPUTER VOICE: I'm right here. Ta-da.   Hi, baby.  I... don't want you to freak out, okay? Um, I'd like you to meet... Carnage.  That is so hot.   Go!   A '66.  My dream car. Yeah, I remember. Let's see what you got.       CLETUS: Mm, mm.  Yes, baby!      OFFICER : This is SFPD. Stand down.       Stop! You'll kill him! CARNAGE: She does that again, I'll eat her face. He's sensitive to sound. OFFICER : Stop the vehicle. Stand down.  CLETUS: Who said romance was dead? Hey. No drunks in here.  Help me. Food. Out. You get out! Chocolate. Venom? VENOM: I'm having trouble keeping them standing, Mrs. C. Where's Eddie? VENOM: Food.  Monsters! Monsters everywhere! They're everywhere! - Monsters! -   Put out an APB. Form a perimeter. Blockade state lines. And bring in Brock.  I'm no use to anybody here. I'm just wasting your time. Well, you know what I keep thinking? I keep thinking, ""What else is Eddie Brock ""not sharing about Cletus Kasady? ""Now, why was it Eddie that Cletus wanted to witness the execution?"" Huh? Bad things happen around you. Multiple dead bodies at your building last year, that bizarre outburst at the lobster restaurant, and only you at the Life Foundation when that rocket exploded. And now Clyde's found Bonnie, and there's a dead psychiatrist at a facility I knew nothing about until today. And people are talking about seeing monsters. Monsters? Uh, what-what do you mean... - what do you mean, ""monsters""? - Monsters, Eddie! Everywhere Cletus goes, so goes this supposed monster. - Oh, God. - Talk to me, Eddie. -  - Talk to me!  MULLIGAN: How's he doing it, Eddie?  What's the secret? How's he making people see things? All right, I, uh...  I can't answer any more of your questions without making my phone call. I'll get you your phone call. But you know what secrets want, Eddie? They want out. That's why they're so hard to keep.  DAN: Eddie asked you to do this? And he doesn't have anyone else that can help him? We're gonna be late for the party. He's in trouble, Dan. Yeah, trouble is his thing. Are there gonna be aliens again? No, of course not. I'd like to speak to him alone. Well, your duty of honesty supersedes your duty to the client if somebody gets harmed. They teach you that at posh school? Oh, hey. Anne. Hey, Anne, thank you so... thank you so much for coming.  Boy, that little guy's a charmer, huh? How much do I need to worry about you right now? Uh, I-I messed up. Okay. How badly? Uh, it couldn't be worse, and it's-it's all on me. Whatever you did, Eddie, you just need to tell the cops the truth. No. No. No, I can't tell them that they are chasing a serial killer  who's also got an alien inside of him. And he's capable of killing everybody. Venom. Talk to me. What's happening? No, he's-he's not here. He's not here. Is this, like, an ""I'm lying"" ""He's not here,"" or is this a real ""He's not here""? He's not here. - ANNE: Jesus Christ, Eddie. -  DISPATCHER : St. Estes fire. All units. What the actual f... - Eddie, think. Think. - I don't know. I don't know. All I know that... i-is that he can't go long without eating food, right, so he's eating chicken and he eats chocolate, and that's it. And that is only if he's still observing the rules. We need to find him. You mean I need to find him. Yeah, you need to find him, please. And then I-I... I will fix it. - I'll try. - Thank you. Mrs. Chen. - Who's asking? - It's me. What do you want? - Oh, she's a charmer. -  Okay, listen. You broke Eddie's heart. Okay, I actually don't have time to explain why that's wildly off the mark. Do you know where Venom is? You want to break his heart, too? I'm not gonna get into who did what to who. Eddie said that he might be here because of the chocolate. I-I just need to speak with the alien. Wha... Hey, you said there weren't gonna be any aliens. - I meant more aliens. - REPORTER: Breaking news. The mayor has issued a curfew... Can you turn the volume up, please? REPORTER: Kasady and Barrison should be treated as armed and extremely dangerous. An all-out manhunt continues tonight.  So? - Cletus has a symbiote. - DAN: Oh, my God. Any other information you're pathologically lying about? - Pussy. - Excuse me? Eddie needs Venom. She just called me a pussy. He said he didn't need him, that life was better without him. Okay, I don't understand. What do you care... Oh, wait a second. You get out here right now.  Do you... D-Do you see that? - Seriously, do you see that? - Yeah, hon, I've seen it. VENOM: Eddie's going to have to fight this battle all by his little bitch self. Oh, don't be a big baby. Go help your friend. He said I couldn't get a job fixing toilets. Cletus will come for him. He won't survive without you. Of course he won't. Because I am the hero of the two of us. Yeah, you're the big sexy hero. You're the coolest, you're the hottest, and you're the bravest. I am. You know, I'm still standing right here. No one likes you, Dan! I love seeing you in action.  Let's go save that asshole.  CLETUS: I promised we'd be free from here. FRANCES: And we'd walk to the cathedral on the hill.  A wedding. CLETUS: Three guests. One for each of us. FRANCES: The cop that took my eye. CLETUS: Eddie Brock. And Venom. A red wedding.  You... you didn't find him? OFFICER: Oh, my Lord. What happened?    EDDIE: Hey, Dan. All right, let's go. VENOM: I'm not talking to him! Well, he doesn't want to come out. What-what do you mean? We-we have to leave right now 'cause Cletus is gonna wipe the city out. VENOM: We're not doing shit until he apologizes. So, he's looking for an apology. Look, I know that amends aren't - really your thing, but... - EDDIE: An apology? What, like, as in right... right now, an apology? VENOM: I need him to beg. Fine, I will be the bigger of us. VENOM: I will always be the bigger of us, but go on. What did he say? What is he saying? He said he's listening very sincerely. All right, listen to this. I am sorry. VENOM: Not the right tone. I'm sorry. VENOM: Nope. I-I am sorry. So weird. I'm sorry! I don't know why you're shouting at me. Well, 'cause... Okay, well, fine. I was a... I was a loser before I met you. - VENOM: Yep. That's right. - And, uh... and now I am someone. All right? You made me special. VENOM: Damn right. Why don't you put a cherry on it? A cherry on that? Right. Um... I'm... I-I am truly very sorry for everything that I said. - VENOM: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Everything that I did not say. - Everything that I did, you know. - Mm-hmm. And probably everything that I-I did... I did not... I did not do. - VENOM: Mm... - Yeah, he's thinking. - VENOM: Hmm... - Come on. Come on. - VENOM: Okay. - Whoa. Whoa! Oh. Oh, no. VENOM: Kiss her. Are you gonna... are you gonna kiss me now? - No. - No? ANNE: Oh, God, I'm never doing that again. God, well, maybe never. I don't know. Honestly, it's really fun. VENOM: If we save the day, can we call ourselves the Lethal Protector? That is so '80s. Dan, pack quickly. Don't stay. And if for any reason... Fire and sound. ""Fire and sound""? Is that a band? - No, it's what kills them. - EDDIE: Yeah. Okay, look, man, I've got her. -  - VENOM: Not sorry. - ANNE: Oh... - God, I'm so sorry. Man, those two need some serious couples counseling.  I'm pulling up to Brock's now.  Shit. Oh, my God. Kasady, place your hands on your head! Which, um... hands? What the...   We found you. Shriek will be so pleased. Yoo-hoo! Brockalicious.  Bling-a-ling. Now, whose finger were you meant for? Ah. A nice, shiny lure for a little fishy.  Okay. Here we go, buddy.  -  - Hello, Anne. I just incapacitated your boyfriend. Now, he'll be okay... with an answer about where Eddie Brock is.  Well, I'm sure as shit not gonna tell you that. It's a shame to hurt you.  Tell Brock Cletus will make a swap. Her head for his. He's gonna kill you both. Peeps have tried that already. Botched it.   VENOM: They can't find him! They are hunting us, too, buddy.  Come on, where are you?  Hey, Dan. What's going on? - Eddie, they got her. - Huh? - They've taken Anne! - Calm down. Yeah, they took her to their wedding. - They took her where? - Their wedding. - Grace Cathedral. Hurry. - We're on our way. All right, it looks like we are going to a wedding. VENOM: Oh, will there be canaps? You bet your ass.    That distant cathedral is all I see. Fractured angel, the other part of me. D-Dearly beloved... Gifts first. Actually, traditionally... Shut your mouth. Father. Baby, I got for you what you want most. SHRIEK: The cop? - CLETUS: The cop. -  Continue, Father. Dearly beloved, if anyone objects to this marriage, speak now or forever hold th-their...  Where is she?!  There you are. Death to you, Father. No! Not you, Father. You, Father. Oh, shit! Uh, where you going? What are you doing? VENOM: This is much worse than I thought. That is a red one. Wow. Uh... - Red one? - We should leave immediately. Annie will get over it. We never liked her anyway. So let's go. Now? Congratulations to the happy couple. We are leaving. Eddie! Yoo-hoo. I'll be right with you, all right? Mm. Okay, you need to come out right now. Because I am feeling super, super vulnerable right here. Brock's just like you? Not for long.  Eddie, over here! You need to come out right now. I will let you eat everybody. You can eat 'em all! Apart from him in the robe. You cannot eat him. - VENOM: Promise? - I promise.  EDDIE: Thank you.      Baby! Shut your mouth.  Marriage trouble already?  Time to die. EDDIE: That's the spirit. I mean us. We are going to die.       I-I killed you. Well, you can't kill a ghost.  You, kill him, but keep your mouth shut. CLETUS: Our wife knows what she's doing. Just turn it down. Who do you think you're talking to? - Stop him. - My cop!   Honeymoon over? PRIEST : Oh, God. No.  -  - Power up. EDDIE: No!   Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. Cletus Kasady...   What do they say about an eye for an eye?    Fire and sound. Except without the sound.  Baby!  Cletus!    -  -       Mano a mano, Brock.   You know how I spent my endless days? -  -  I spent them thinking about how you only told one side of the story. -  -  You didn't write about the part where Cletus was abused by Mommy, Daddy and Granny!         You didn't tell the world how he was a scared little boy that no one cared about and no one came to save!  - You never asked yourself why! -  That's bad journalism!   Oh, happy days.  I'm not a crazy man, but I am a vengeful one. You're going to watch her die.   Anne! Anne! -  -  Do something!  Eddie, I'm afraid we cannot beat them.  Baby, that's too much. You got to stop him. CLETUS: What are you doing? I'll shut her up for good.  No, stop! You're hurting her!  EDDIE: Get up! I can't. EDDIE: Look. Look. They're not symbiotic. Get away from her! Shut up. Get your hands off my wife! EDDIE: They're not a match. We are. EDDIE: That's right. We are. Together, we are... VENOM & EDDIE: The Lethal Protector!         -  -   -  -  -  -  Let there be carnage!   -  -     - I got you. You okay? -        Father, one of us must die. EDDIE : We need fire.  Or sound. -  -    CARNAGE: No!     Holy mackerel.       He did not taste good. I'm a killer with or without the monster, Eddie.  You know what I really wanted? No. What was it, Cletus? I told you, but you weren't listening. Well, I'm listening now. I wanted your friendship. I'm sorry, Cletus. Fuck this guy.  You in there, get him out of here. They're gonna come for you both. I know. Hey, Anne. Take care. Yeah, you, too, champ. VENOM: Dan! You take care, too. Thanks. I like you. We totally didn't need him, though. Honestly, I think he was more of a hindrance than a help. Monsters. That there is Don Quixote, and the guy next to him is, uh, S-Sancho Panza. They're two very different people who have very different takes on the world. D-Different ways of doing things. Sometimes they didn't like each other a whole lot, but ultimately... they worked together to bring out the best in each other. VENOM: Eddie, the time has come. I must go alone. It is me they want. Yeah. Well, my dear Sancho, facts are the enemy of truth. VENOM: What does that even mean? It means... It means that we are... - frien... - VENOM: Fugitives! Um, yeah. Yeah. - On the run. - That, too. -  -   Thank you for bringing me here. Yeah, you're welcome, buddy. - It's beautiful, huh? - Mm-hmm. EDDIE: I'm sorry that we can't do anything about the old ""wind in your hair"" situation, but... Osho says, when you love someone, - you accept the whole person... - Osho? ...with all of their defects. ""Defects."" Hmm. Nobody is perfect. Just go back. Go back a minute. You telling me... you just said that you love me. - Um... - You did. Where will we go? I don't know. I don't know. Anywhere that needs a Lethal Protector, I suppose. Oh! You really meant it! Yeah. We will need a cape and a mask. No. No, I think you got that covered. We're good.

Ests embarazada. Ests esperando un hijo mo?  VENOM: Oh, I love this show. EDDIE: Yeah. VENOM: Maximiliano's feelings are not being validated. Yeah, well, he never should've kept such an insane secret, man. VENOM: We all have a past, Eddie. What, are you... you hiding stuff from me? VENOM: 80 billion light-years of hive knowledge across universes would explode your tiny little brain. What-what does that even mean, man? VENOM: Well, let me give you a taste, then. Just the smallest fraction of the things we symbiotes have experienced. - Okay. - Ready, Eddie? Yeah.   Whoa. VENOM: What's happening? EDDIE: No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.  VENOM: What the hell is that?! Oh, that's a... that-that's just a towel. Where are we? - Wh-What did you do? - It wasn't me. J.

Sir? Sir, uh, are you the janitor of this building? Don't never come up on anybody like that. What's the matter with you? I'm sorry. You have the apartment 5-F? This is 148 Suffolk Street, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I look at the apartment, please? - Yeah, what do you want to do? - Well, I just... I'd like to see it. I don't know how... you know, if I want it, but I'd like to see it. Well, you know, it ain't furnished. Well, a little nail up there would... I leave these lights on 'cause you had about 12 guys up here the other day. All right, now, first of all, you've got a shelf up here. You can put everything up here. And you've got your water. And you've got a combination bathtub and dishwasher here. And you can just, uh... Oh, is... what's that? That's, um... Could someone take that out? Yeah, well, you can take it out. Here you've got a great view, you know? And, uh, only one flight up, and you've got the sky. Now, over here, this is my pride and joy. This is an oven that's kept here, right, that... that you open here... You take it as-is, right, or you don't take it at all. How much did you say this place rents for? $75 a month. Yeah. I didn't know that we had this much furniture in here. Well, yeah, but... - How much is it, then? Sixty-six... well, it says in the paper... Now, look, I know what it says in the paper. $45. I didn't know all this furniture was in here, all right? You know, and the mattresses go with it. You know? And here, over here... you don't need to look out there, because there's the view, right there. - I'll take it. - Okay. Will you shut that door? Leave the coffee and corned beef on the table. What the hell are you... I don't want any magazines, kid. You mind? Look what you're disturbing here, huh? Where do you think you are, in your own house? - I'm sorry. - Look at that. Is that gorgeous? You see that cleavage? Huh? Where you gonna get that? You don't get that in a Fellini film. You get that in a Banner film. Now, this is your public, you understand? These guys come from every walk of life... middle class, rich, poor. Don't pay any attention. Things go on in there. I shouldn't even tell you what goes on in there. You come into one of these theaters, you do not go into the men's room. You understand? You got that straight? That's one of the laws. Is that art? - What's going on in there? - Don't pay any attention to it. Go on, get out from in here. Pervert. Leave him alone. Who knows where he's been. She looks inhibited, right? You know why she looks inhibited? She hasn't had the right direction. She has not been told who she is in this film. That girl does not want to screw anybody. She wants to screw the man of her life, so who do they put her in with, huh? Some weirdo with gold hair. Yeah, that's funny, huh? What's gonna happen when her mother sees that picture, know what I mean? Kids should grow up with a feeling of beauty about their bodies, right? I mean, my little boy, my 6-year-old boy, walks around with a towel around him all the time. I mean, why is that, huh? I don't see my daughter doing that. Hey. That's all right. He means well. This man is obviously somebody who needs a movie. But not this movie. If it were this movie, he wouldn't be doing this to me. He wouldn't be putting his hands on my balls. Now, you want to make a film for me, you've got to have a property. Kid, kid, this is real estate. What is this? Is this gonna sell movies? Yes. This is gonna sell movies, a tall building? So what? So that's a phallic symbol. I know what that is. - No, it's not. - You trying to teach me something? A tall building? Listen, I used to watch Superman when I was a little kid, too, you know what I mean? You're not gonna teach me anything new with just a tall building. The reason I've come to see you is because I know that you're a good producer... Take a look at that top floor. - Who took this picture? - I took these pictures. You know what you've got on that top floor? The top floor is an old woman. That's not an interesting picture. - An old woman? - Yes! No, no! You'd better have your eyes checked, kid. Look what he's showing me. Look what's gonna sell money, right? You got the right idea. You like titties, right? - Right? - Yeah. You'll buy this before you'll buy that picture, won't you? - I'll show you something. - Go on, show him something. Go on, see if you can make a sale. - You see, these are four windows. - It's gorgeous, isn't it? You could really go home and jerk off to that, couldn't you? Wait a minute, Mr. Banner! You could really go home and put your thing right through the window. These are the most interesting windows of this side of the building. There are 270 windows. - I'm taking your word for that? - Yes. Now, what I have, see, I have this telescope here, see? I've got this telescope, and I get the activities of all these... the secretaries, the revolutionary, the hippy... young hippies... this playboy down here, and then up there, you've got a housewife. That's what I don't understand. How do you know they live there? How do I know they live there? I've been watching them. I have all the photographs. I have all the film, the 8mm film. And then I've got this telescope, you see, and I do this. And you set it up here, and, you know, it's what I call ""peep"" art, and I think it's fantastic, because you get all these private moments. You get all these people together, and they don't know they're being watched. Its not like in those photographs in that bookstore, but these are real activities. You think people are stupid? You think people are stupid? You think people don't know when they're being watched? No, they don't know. You think I don't know that you're watching me now? The only compromise in this is when someone pulls the blinds. - Why don't you look? - I'm gonna see what you see, right? Look on the 16th floor. You think people don't know when they're being watched, right? Mr. Banner, can I just... Don't ""Mr. Banner"" me. You're getting me nervous. - All right, now, look in that window. - Call me Joe. - What? - Oh, there she is. Go ahead, look, look. Just watch, watch. - Can you see her? - Hey, hey! I see, like, a very funny broad with a red towel, right? Right, right, right, right. Now, you like it. I'm glad you like it. - What's your name? Jon, right? - Jon, right. 280 windows. Confessions of a Peeping Jon. Oh, yeah, well, that's... Okay. - That's what? - Okay, okay. - You patronizing me? - No. You gonna give me the money? You putting up with me? I'm putting up with you. - You don't have to put up with me. - I'm not putting up with you! I'm just saying, give me the money, and I'll do it. I told you, I'm scared of heights. I'm nervous up here. You need a lens. I like the idea. It's a good idea. It's a good idea, kid. It's a good idea. Too bad you don't have a lens. You need a lens! What, are you gonna work with that piece of crap? What are you doing to my equipment? I'm waiting for her to take off... I could see her from here better! - Look at this! - Well, I know I need a lens. You see these? These are $12 prescription glasses. I can see probably clearer. Look at that. I have no trouble now seeing her. I'll get you a lens from Harry. You go down to Harry, he'll send you to ABC Camera, you go down, you get the lens, you get the works. - You will? - You better deliver. I will, I promise! You get a lens, you sit in your bathtub, you'll be able to take pictures. Oh, Mr. Banner, that's fantastic. Can I shake your hand? When you get to know me better, we'll shake hands. Right now it's strictly business, you understand? That's great, Mr. Banner. Listen, how much money can you give me? Don't worry about it. Whatever it costs. What do you need? Well, I need about... I'd like to have about $2,000. $2,000? All right, so I'll give you about $2,000. Get out. You're gonna give me $2,000? - I'm gonna give you $2,000. - You're really gonna give me $2,000? That's right, I'm a schmuck, I know. I trust you, kid. I know, I know, I know. I've got a good heart. You remind me of... What's the difference who you remind me of? He was killed in the war, anyway. He was a good kid. He went away. I was gonna teach him the business, you know that? What business was that? - You trying to make fun of me? - I'm sorry. What? I'm taking you in off the street, you're making fun of me? My cousin Marshall. My cousin Marshall would have had this job, would have had the opportunity that you're gonna have. Mr. Banner, I'm very sorry. I'd like to shake your hand. I'm sorry. Can I expect a check from you? You just tell Harry to send the bills to me. And what you're actually doing is setting the camera motor on, and you can just take pictures of yourself. That's right. You just push this button. Like this? And as far as the sound is concerned, the sound is recorded in this microphone. - Oh, I see. - Right here. Does it have... what do you...? A zoom? Yes. Now, I'll show you how to operate the zoom. You just twist this like so... and your subject will come closer and closer and closer. Yeah, I see. - Isn't that great? - I can do that, right. - Isn't that great? - Yes. Now, are you familiar with the exposure? No, I don't really know anything about it. Well, you see this little ring around the center here? Yeah, right here? Well, you just turn that slowly and slowly, and the camera will automatically set itself for the proper exposure. - What's exposure? - That's right. Well, it's the correct lightness and darkness of the picture. Oh, yeah, I see. The light and the dark. Yes. You see how that works? Now, you want to try the zoom now? Yeah. Let's zoom right across the room, right over there. Okay. I'll take that man's picture right there. You're getting him right in the picture. Uh-huh. But it's all out of focus now. - Well, we'll fix that. - Oh, I see. You get sound just like Hollywood. You can sing. They can do anything they want, anything. Who's there? Jon Rubin. - Jon Rubin? - Yes, Jon Rubin. Hi. How are you? I'm your computer date. Computer date? Yes. ABC Computer Dating. Very nice to meet you. I never ordered a computer date. If you didn't, somebody who certainly looks very much like you did. As a matter of fact, you look much better than your photograph. As a matter of fact, you're quite a knockout! Well, I think we have approximately 15 minutes. Do you know my name? Well, of course I know your name. Jo Ann Larch. - Judy. - Judy? - Judy Bishop. - Oh, Judy Bishop? Ha ha! Very funny. You've got a very good sense of humor. As a matter of fact, I punched that in. I'm very glad. Well, let's get going, will you, because we don't have much time. Well, I think there must be some mistake. Hello, is this ABC Computer Dating? Yes, my name is Jon Rubin, and there seems to be some mistake here. I'm at the apartment of a Judy Bishop, 505 LaGuardia Place. A Judy Bishop of 505 LaGuardia Place... and, uh... uh... it seems that there's some mistake, because I have come here under the assumption that we were to have a date tonight, and, uh, it seems that Miss Bishop knows nothing about it... and so I would like to find out what's happening here. I happen to have tickets for Cinema Sociables, dining, and dancing, and I have a cab waiting outside, and it seems that there's just nothing here now, and I'm quite upset about it, and I seem to be feeling quite degraded. Now, could you please tell me what the story is? There seems to be some mistake? There is a mistake? It's 505 LaGuardia Place in the Bronx? Well, I'm... I'm... You should be sorry! You should absolutely be sorry! What? Well, I'm afraid I'll just have to report it to the Better Business Bureau, yes. Well, the least you can do is send my $3 back. Do you know my address? That's right. Goodbye. What's that? Oh, nothing, nothing. L... Well, I spoke to them on the phone, and they said that, uh, that there must have been some mistake. The LaGuardia Place that I was told to go to is in the Bronx, so I really feel terrible. - What a shame. - Yes, I feel like quite a fool. Oh, don't be silly. Well, I do. I feel as if I've degraded myself and embarrassed you, and I really, really feel very bad. I'm quite sorry, and now I have these tickets, and I can't do anything with them. I mean, uh, I can't get my money back, because they're non-returnable. Well, there must be somebody... And I can't call anyone, you know. I'd feel kinda silly just calling a girl now. ...some girl in New York City who's free tonight. Wonder what I did...? Oh. Ah! Here they are. Yeah, I just don't know. I guess the only thing to do is... Oh, don't be silly! No. Well... Well, I don't know. I just can't call a girl now. There must be someone. Oh, listen, um... I-I don't want to be rude or, you know, crass or vulgar or impolite. I certainly wouldn't want to do that... I've already embarrassed you enough... but I was just thinking, um... perhaps, uh... perhaps, uh... ...you would like to go. - Yes! You would? All right. Oh, actually, I had a date, but I-I cancelled it because it, uh, it snowed. - You could go? - Yeah. Oh, fantastic. Well, come on, let's go. Oh, wow. What a beautiful movie. It's so personal to me, that... that child-woman. At times, she's a little girl, terrified by the brutality and ugliness of reality, and she has to talk in rhyme to preserve her fantasy world. And then, at times... the woman... this sexual-driven, passionate woman... bursts forth like a ripe fruit. So much wanting. And then that frightens her, and she has to go back into the little girl again and talk in rhyme. Yeah. You know, tragedy is a funny thing. Oh, wow. It certainly is. Just breaks my heart. You know, I think I understand this movie really well because I had a personal experience. I was going with Danny in high school, and we were at Jim Thorpe High. And Danny... Danny and I were really close, except there wasn't any magic, you know what I mean? We weren't really... And, um, we went to this party together, and, well, this person was there. This person, he was like the high school heartthrob, you know? Everybody was crazy about him. And I never thought he'd look at me or anything. I never thought he'd pay any attention to me, and suddenly, out of the blue, he began talking to me, and then he began dancing with me, and, well, we were communicating. We were talking about things I'd never talked to anyone about before. We were really close. And he said to me, ""Would you leave with me? We're two special people, and we should leave together,"" he said. And I said yes, because it was so special. And, well, we got into his car, and we drove to the quarry, and it was a very beautiful night, and... well... I had all these feelings inside of me that I'd never had for anyone before, and, well, I gave myself to him, completely. Oh. Oh, you did? And, um, it was very beautiful, I-I thought. And, uh, when it was over... I-I said to him... and it wasn't because I wanted to get engaged or I wanted him to pin me or I wanted to go steady or anything like that. It was because I had for him the biggest feeling I'd ever had for anyone in my whole life. Ever. And I said to him, ""I love you."" And I looked in his face... and he had the most sick, ugly, peculiar grin on his face. He was laughing at me! Do you mind if I put my hand here? No. Well, as you can imagine, I mean, everything inside me went cold. I became inwardly hysterical. And I-I looked up at him, and in my nakedness, l... you may not believe this... I said to him, ""Roger, Roger, look at me. Roger, Roger, what do you see?"" That reminds me of something that happened to me. I was coming home. I was living with a girl, Barbara, a few years ago, and, uh... it was her birthday, and I came home, and I had presents and a cake and candles, and all kinds of confetti and crepe paper, and I was rushing up the stairs, ecstatic. I opened the door very quietly and crept in, and I heard the shower running. Well, I opened the door to the bathroom... and I hear some voices. And all of a sudden I open the shower curtain, and then, there are... there she is with another person. They were... they were... they were naked. And the funny thing about it was, he had this kind of laugh, this kind of grin, this kind of evil grin, and it... it really threw me, and I naturally ran out of the place in a state of shock. I didn't know what to do, and... But, you know, come to think of it, his name was Roger, because I was introduced to him once before. It was? And he... Did you say this Roger was from Jim Thorpe, PA? Jim Thorpe, PA? What was his last name? Parks. Roger Parks. Roger Parks? Well... well, I'll be damned. Do you know that's the same Roger Parks who was in the shower with Barbara? Do you know that? That same son of a bitch was in the shower with Barbara! That goddamn... ...son of a bastard! - Oh, no! Oh! Oh, look what I've done. Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, are you all right? - In a moment of passion, I... I got excited. I'm sorry. I must've acted like a fool, and I've ruined the pizza. I'm... I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's just that... It's all right. Poor you. Oh, you poor thing. That's terrible. We were both victimized by that... that... that brute, that... that... that... Oh, l... oh, I get so... Oh, I'm... I get so... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Please forgive me. You poor thing. You poor thing. Be gentle with me. I will, Judy, but not now. We've both had a very exhausting evening, and we're both drained, and... Well, when? Well, as I've said, we're both very drained, and we've had quite an unusual experience this evening, a wonderful experience. I happen to be a person of the weather, and I hear that tomorrow the forecast is not too good. It's going to be cloudy and rainy all day, but Sunday is going to be sunny and beautiful, and I think that's the day we should get together and rendezvous. This is the wonderful view we have from the living room and bedroom windows. It's really nice, because how many people in New York can look out their window and see this much space? Usually they're just looking into the side of another building or into somebody else's window. This is the housing project across the street. It's not nearly as nice as the one we live in. This is our housing project, see? I don't like that one at all. This one is really pretty. It's really modern. And the cement blocks, all one color. We live on the sixth floor. Let's see, not counting the big windows on the bottom, go up one, two, three, four, five, six, and over to the... let's see... second and third window, that's right. Let's see now, l... Um, this is my elevator. It's an automatic elevator, so we don't need a doorman. And, um... - Oh. Hi, Gerrit. - Hello, Mrs. Mitchell. This is a neighbor of mine. Lives upstairs. And, um... Can you hold the door, 'cause I'm trying to take a... Um, thank you. What are you putting up there? - It's a poster. - I think I'll come in and ride with you. What is that you're putting...? Are you allowed to put things up in an elevator like that? I don't know. What is that? Is that a naked girl? - Yep. - My goodness. Well, what, is it an advertisement for something? Yeah. What? A play. I'm trying out my new movie camera. Gerrit is a student at... where do you go to school, Gerrit? - NYU. - Are you in the play? Uh-huh. Oh, are you really? I guess that's why you grew a beard, huh? A lot of actors have beards, don't they? Are you gonna leave that there in the elevator? - Mm-hmm. - We'll have to come see it. Shoot 'em! ...black in America? Why not? You live in America, why can't you learn to be part of it? 'Cause I'm not black. Well, now you can find out what it's like to be black. I'd like to talk to you. You have the kind of face that looks like... - No, I'm real busy. - You are busy? Why are you so busy you don't want to know what it's like to be black? - Sorry. So I'm busy. - You're very busy? Do you have black people in your neighborhood, sir? Excuse me, sir, do you know what it's like to be black in America? - Say what? - To be black in America. - Yes. I do. - You do? Would it interest you to learn more about black people and how it is to be black in this society... to go through the experience? I don't know what are you talking about. Excuse me, sir, do you know what it's like to be black in America? You've got to go back to work? Are there any black people at your job? Black people have been imitating white people for so long, they know how to act like you all act, so, I mean, what's your whole problem? Why can't you go through the black experience? I don't have any problem. I don't care if you're green, blue, or yellow. We know. We understand that. That's an admirable attitude. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to be a black woman? She doesn't look black. It's a question of understanding it from the inside as opposed to understanding it from the outside. It's easy to say, ""I live next door to somebody."" That's just saying that you're liberal. I'm not a liberal, I'm a radical. I mean, you know, you're not talking to a white liberal walking around the Village. You know, we have been on many marches in Harlem. We've done lots of things. We haven't been born today, you know. All of intellectual white America's been on marches and given to the NAACP and attended lectures. How do you expect to be where you are now if we don't help you? - I'm not saying that. - We know why we're here. Because you helped us stay there. Right. You have an obligation if somebody's a human. Well, of course. I understand that. And it's not attending marches, and it's not going to lectures, and it's not giving money to the NAACP. Just what do you want from us? I want you to check this out, that's what I want. Come and see our show, Be Black Baby. Listen, we know all about this. This is nothing new to us. Intellectual experiences don't have nothing to do with physical experiences. You think we're unimaginative? We've been all through this. It's not about your imagination. It's about what you live, lady. And you can't intellectualize it, you understand? You have to live it. It isn't a matter of intellectualizing. That's what you just said... you have a good imagination. Come on, I'll owe it to you, you bastard! ...well, of course there are. - You have anything to do with them? - But of course. Like what? We see them in the morning, we say hello to them, just like to anybody else. Look, there are now scholarships. If you want to take advantage of the situation now... You gotta kiss somebody's ass to get a scholarship. Oh, come on. A large part of your clients are black, aren't they? Yes. Can I ask you if you ever feel guilty... I mean, if your conscience ever bothers you? Never at all. Never at all, my friend. Do you know, do you have any idea what I'm talking about? I think I have a good idea what you're talking about. Yeah, well, I'll tell you what I'm talking about, man. You got stuff in this store that is the shoddiest merchandise I've ever seen. You have committed your life, you have made it your life's work to suck in the poorest people in this town and sell them the shoddiest trash I've ever seen for the most blown-up, exorbitant prices I could ever have expected to see anywhere. You are a pillar in the system that is oppressing the black people and all the poor people in the world, no matter what color they are, man! Do you realize that? Are you aware of that at all? I'm aware of everything, but I'm really surprised you're even talking this way. You notice our prices that we charge over here? Do you know what we sell over here? - Incredibly over... - We are the cheapest. We are the cheapest. We defy anyone to undersell our prices! We give everything away. But you're being a tool, mister! I'm being used? I'm being used? For what price? You being used to suck in people, mister. Man, you got the wrong impression. No, I ain't, because you tell people to buy this garbage, mister! I tell people to buy this garbage. You know why? Because... because... because I'm being paid! You tell Puerto Rican people, you tell crackers, you tell black people... Well, nobody's twisting their arm to walk in that door! Nobody's twisting you to stand out here and sell this bullshit! For a price! For a price, man! That means you done sold yourself, right? I ain't sold myself! It's a matter of opinion! But that's what you're doing, right? Telling people to buy this garbage! That's your opinion! - That's what it is! - Well, I'll tell you what... ...get a police and have me arrested! No, no, brother, I want to appeal to you. I don't want to get no police on you. - Why you want to appeal to me? - Because you a black man! You damn right! ""There's just nothing you can do. It's uncanny, but there's nothing you can do."" I'll start crying there. That'll take about three... I'll give myself three minutes just to make sure the crying and everything... really build it up. If that doesn't get her, I don't know what will. If she doesn't say, ""Oh, Jon, is there anything I can do?"" And I'll say, ""I can't ask you."" ""Oh, please, Jon, take me now."" And I'll say, ""Oh, oh, Estelle... I-I mean... I mean, Judy."" And she'll say, ""No, no, Jon, say what's ever in your heart. ""If it's Estelle, it's Estelle, ""and I know that sooner or later, you'll love me, and everything will be fine."" And I'll say... Let's see, that oughtta take about two more minutes. That'll take, uh... And, ""Oh, Jon, take me."" And so, let's see, I'll get her up against the ledge here, and then I'll kiss her a few times, and then I'll start undoing her blouse. Make sure she's facing the camera. I'll have to turn her. It'll be a little awkward, but I'll get her there. Let's see... that oughtta... Yeah, that's 26-and-a-half minutes... 26-and-a-half minutes... It's now 9:57. I have to be there at 10:00. It's 9:57 plus 20 seconds. That gives me 40 seconds. Well, coat. Coat. I guess you'll want to know why I have two watches here. You see, the left watch, which is my uncle's, runs correctly, and the one which is my watch, this one on the right here... uh, I've got to explain this to you... happens to be about five minutes off, so if you notice that I keep looking at it every few seconds, it's only because I'm trying to check it now, because I paid $30 to have it fixed. What's for breakfast? Uh... me! Ha ha ha! Very funny! No, what's for breakfast, seriously? Huh? I'd like a four-minute egg. I'd like a four-minute egg, not sooner or faster. Oh, come on, forget about breakfast. I'll bet you cook just like my mother. - Mother? - Yes. You want a mother figure, honey? No, I mean, I bet you make a four-minute egg just like my mother made fantastic four-minute eggs, though my mother did do one thing... and that was that she'd make me go to dancing school all the time, and I met a girl named Estelle there, and Estelle was the only girl who would dance with me, though, and sometimes, uh, Estelle and I would... would... would be alone in the country. For example, once we were on a rock, and we made love and... you know what happened to Estelle? Make love to me, sweetie! Well, something happens to... she... she's... - Come on. - Estelle was killed. Estelle was killed. We were on a... We were driving along, and, um... all of a sudden, the car turned over, and rolled over about 23 times. Come on! I walked out without a scratch, and Estelle was damaged beyond repair. You're kidding! That's terrible! The car burst into flames, and she was burnt to a crisp. Why are you telling me this? Well, I just want to tell you, I'm a very sensitive person, and I can't just jump into bed with you like this. But I fell in love with you! Come on! Well, I-I love you, too, but it's just that... uh... uh... you know, it's... And then Estelle and I went to, uh... well... - Oh, please. - I feel very badly about Estelle now. - This was a few years ago... - This is not the time for Estelle. ...and now I see a psychiatrist about five times a week, and he told me that, uh... well, he told me that I can't have sex except under certain conditions, and he said that it's a matter of time, it's a matter of time. - I have to get to know somebody first. - I'll be gentle! - No, no. - I'll be gentle. I have to get to know you. Look, would you do me a favor? Would you wait about 25 minutes? Wait? Why? I-I can't explain it. It's difficult. It's difficult. I can't explain. Oh, let me comfort you, sweetie. If you could only wait a few minutes. - Just a few! - Here, lie down. Okay. Just wait, though, because I have to get to know you first. Right. Just lie down. I mean, I just don't... it's not proper... I just don't jump into bed with every girl I see. I-I like you. I just don't go around flattering people and saying how much I like them unless I really like them. Right. So, why can't you... can you wait a few minutes? Sure. Good, good. I-I forgot to tell you something else, too. I-I don't have any, uh... - Are you protected? - Oh, the hell with that! I'd like to get some prophylactics or contraceptives. Well, which would you like... a prophylactic or a contraceptive? Well, I just want... What's for a man? A man? Well, I mean, it depends on what your situation is. Well, what's the best thing you have for right now... I mean, for a man or for a woman? What would be the best thing that you'd have? - For right now? - Yeah, yeah. This minute? Well, not this... you know... well, you know... Just a minute. I've got something. Something might happen. Now, um, these are prophylactics. Trojan, you see? These are of quite fine quality. I have them either in unlubricated or lubricated. Uh, which is the better? Which is the stronger? Well, it depends, you know, on what you like. I'll demonstrate one for you. Now, you see, this is unlubricated. Yeah. I see. Yeah. Is it strong, though? Is the rubber...? Oh, very, very good. Here, see? - It really is very durable. - It's very strong. No holes or anything. Gee, you can see through it, as a matter of fact. Yeah, it's very thin, for sensitivity. Oh, and now for your wife, sir. This just came to us from Copenhagen. This is a personal vibrator. You see? It comes in three colors... pink, light blue, or ""natural."" Now, the batteries are in here. They're included in the price. - You mean this is for...? - Marvelous? For a woman? Yes, a massage of the... as you see on the box. - You see? - Oh! For those hard-to-get-at places. That's good. This is Vagabond lotion. See? Smell that. Isn't that... isn't that marvelous? Smells a little strange. The thing about Vagabond is, it has no bitter-tasting chemicals, so once you apply it, you see, the alcohol evaporates very quickly, leaving a sweet residue on the skin. Oh, I see. As they advertise it, ""Suddenly you're delicious!"" What I did was, I computed the time on my watch, the 26-and-a-half minutes that it would take me to seduce her. 26-and-a-half? Yeah, 26-and-a-half minutes, and I set the camera onto the clock radio, and I had this red lightbulb... Red lightbulb! I used to do that when I was a kid. And the camera was on, and I could see it from her apartment. So, as you'll see now... see, this is the preliminary stuff. - She's cute. - Yeah, yeah. She a pro? Uh... well, I think she is, as a matter of fact. But she's really great. See, what happens now is, see, we go down for a few minutes. That's good. You build up the ecstasy. Watch! We're gonna come up, and I rip her clothes off! It's fantastic. Great stuff. Should be up any second now. Just take a second. - It's, uh... - Coming up soon, right? Yeah, just... well... What's going on here? Where the hell are you? What the hell are you doing? That's a $500 projector! What the hell is that? What are you, some kind of genital freak? Huh? What is that? Is that what I spent money for? That's my Golden Fig Leaf Award, right, from Anchorage, Alaska? How many of them do you think they give out? You dropped your sunglasses. I'll drop 'em again! Get out of here, you phony! She was different, she really was. She just didn't know what was going on at all. And she really thought she said something. Uh... excuse me, excuse me. Uh, is this... you're casting for that ""be black"" thing, for the police officer? Be Black Baby, that's right. Well, I'd like to try for it. You don't look much like a cop to me, man. Yeah, you look kinda humble to me. Well... I don't know, man, if you've got pig in you, we'll get it out of you, so why don't you come on in? - Door's over there. - Okay. Hold up. We're gonna have you run through a trial run, you know, to kinda like test your pig potential. I'm willing to do whatever you want. I can do anything, so, you know... Whatever you want to do, I'm willing, 'cause I think I can play a cop. Sure, I know I can. Come on, open that goddamn door! We can't have any perverts here! What'd you say? Huh? What'd you say? What do you mean? That a friend of yours? What are you protesting? Let me see your permit. You don't need a permit? What do you mean? What's that? Against the war in Vietnam? Let me tell you something, son, you ever been in Vietnam? Well, I have, and I know what it's like. Oh, yeah, you know, huh? What are you, two years old, you've been in the Army? You haven't been in the Army in high school. What? What did you say, young lady? ""Make love, not war""? Listen, I make love very well. What do you know about love? What do you know about war? Well, you want a good slap in the face, huh? You won't even wear a goddamn brassiere, you little slut. Goddamn bitch. What? What'd you say? What are you gonna do about it? Listen, son, I happen to know that you don't have a permit here, so I'm gonna tell you something... You just touch my bat? You touched my bat? Come on, come out! Gimme it! Come on! Yeah. Listen, people, we want to take you through the black experience, and you all know that being black means being loose. - Being what? - Being black means being loose. And that's part of our history, and what we want to do is kind of loosen you up, to more or less prepare you for the experience that we're about to take you through. Okay, now, feel down the arms to the hands. Slowly. You know. We're gonna not rush anything. Touching the hands. Keep your arms clear. Feel anything? Are you aware of any differences? You know...? - He's got a scar. - A scar! - Carolyn is wearing her ring. - I'm sorry! ...then to the neck, and then to the hair. You feel any differences now? No, not the head. Just feel the hair. - So this is a natural? - Yes, it's very natural. It's very... it's sort of springy, isn't it? Like a sponge. - It's like a sponge. - It's like angel food cake. - Is anyone else...? - I had expected steel wool... ...but it's soft, and... ...to the left, back, right, forward... left, back, right, forward... Okay? How are you doing over there? You're not doing anything! Come on, move! Stop taking notes! You're supposed to dance now. Come on. I have to review this for Eye Magazine. I'm sorry. - You're not touching. Come on. - I don't want to touch. You're supposed to. Just keep going. We're supposed to be... we're supposed to relax, right? This is making me very nervous. I'd rather not touch him. I'd rather relax. It's just a play. Right. You're participating in a play, and this is part of your part. But you're the actors. We're the audience, honey. You're also an actor in this case. We're just not sure of the point of this whole thing. We're trying. - Well, come on, let's just do it. - Right. Okay. Forward, side, back, side... Now, in order to be black and to feel black, you've got to eat black, and we have here for you today, through the kindness of sister Carolyn here, who was kind enough to whip it up for us, some of the best in soul food... black-eyed peas... pig feet, and greens. Collard greens. And here we go, right for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. That's enough, that's enough. No, that's good. Mr. Paul. No, no, no. No, no, no. - No, no, you have to eat it. - I don't have to eat that, no, no. Don't look at it like that. You're supposed to eat it. Taste it! Why don't you want it? Is something wrong with it? - What's wrong with it? - What's the matter? That's the food we eat. We got to dish out some stuff for the brother up here. He doesn't even have any! I done told you, I don't care for any. - Open your mouth. - I really... No, no. Now, you really must. You really must. Thank you. Okay. That's some beans for you. Now you need some greens. - Wait a minute. - Chew it. Swallow it. - Chew it and say, ""Mmm!"" - It's good! Go ahead, swallow it, swallow it. Oh, there's something... wait a minute. Oh, yeah, okay, that's all right. Would you eat... hurry up and eat, man? Yeah, I will. You didn't eat none of your meat, man. The sooner you finish, the sooner you get to the show. Right. All of this is what you eat. All of that. That stuff... eat it, man. You know, you're supposed to be so pro-us, then eat us, you understand? There it is, right there. Eat it. - Excuse me. - Eat it, man. - I really... - Well, eat it, man! I mean, this is the black experience. Eat it. Thank you. You all have, uh... you're just about ready for the show. Yeah, you're just about ready. You've tasted black, you've danced black, and you've felt black, and now you've got to be black in order to truly know what it is to have the black experience. Okay, so you come on up here, and we're gonna do you up. - Oh, look! - I'm gonna take care of you. Okay, you look great. Well, you know, you're a bit negroish, so we get to put some on you. Now I can be black on the outside. - Yeah, well, you know. - No, no. - You must. Lady, lady... - It's gonna ruin my makeup! ...it's part of the experience. - Don't. Oh! - Come on! It's all...! - It's all part of it. Close your eyes before you get it in your eyes. Don't get it in my hair. Okay, I won't get it in your hair, your pretty blonde hair. - Don't rub it in. - I won't, I won't. Close your mouth. Oh, this is senseless, just senseless. No, it's not. Yeah. You know, the next thing we do, now that you are black, as white people, we want to kinda get to know you better, 'cause you know all white people want to get to know black people. Is that right? That's right. Now, we want to kinda get to know you better and kinda socialize with you and kinda understand what you're about, black people, see, because we're white and you're black. - We're black now? - That's right. You look black. Look at us. You see? So we want to kinda get into your personal lives, you know, just to be friendly. Oh, I think I have enough. So, why don't we kinda break up and get to know each other, the individual people, okay? Yeah, my name is John Dillinger, you understand. - Hello. - How you doing? - Paul Vymil. - Right. Now, listen, do you have any I.D. On you? Any ""idea"" on me? No, I.D. Identification. - Yes, in my wallet. - Could I see it for a second? - Where are you from? - I'm from Manhasset. From Manhasset? Yeah, what do you do now? Well, I'm a housewife. A housewife? Do you have any children? No. You don't? You gonna have some soon? Well, we're, uh... we're planning. I mean, we're in a family-planning group. Oh, how exciting. How very, very interesting. Why don't you let me take your purse for you for the rest of the show, because we're going to go on up to a new level, and I'm going to take good care of it downstairs, okay? And you don't want to carry this heavy thing around with you all day. Why don't you just go on upstairs, and we'll be right with you, all right? Yeah, why don't you just go on upstairs now. Well... They didn't take her purse! Lady. Hey, would you like to join us? Come on! Uh, what...? She... she took my purse, and she didn't take her purse, and I would like my purse back. Oh, no, that's silly. - Did they take your purse? - They didn't really? She said they were doing it to everybody, but I'm the only one that it happened to, and I don't like that. It's downstairs. It's downstairs, okay? - Well, l... - I think l... She took it. She took my... she said every... she took everyb... she said everybody was doing it. Why don't you go down and find it for her? Why don't you go down with her? I think she's a little bit upset. Joe, I think you should go down. Well, I think somebody oughtta go get it. I don't want to go down. - Well, listen, it's just part of the play. - It's not funny! Well, it's just part of the play, that's all. I looked in my wallet, all of my money is gone. - Joe, go down. - I'm sure it's part of the play, but... It is. It's just part of the play. - Go down. - It's not funny. No, I don't want you to walk down with me. - We'll go together. Come on. - Well, you should go. Speak to the director. I'm sure you'll get it back. I'm going right behind you, Joe. Just stay there. Stay with the girl. Stay here. Stay and talk to her. All right? I'm perfectly capable of going down by myself. If anything happens, come right back... if anything happens. I-I'm sure it's just part of the play. Don't worry about it. Joe, don't get hostile. Be nice. I won't get hostile. There's... there's a number of people. They're just kidding around. You can hear them laughing. Um... excuse me. - Excuse me. - Right. Hi. Would you like to come in for a second, man? Sure. Sure. Wait a second! Somebody do something, will you? - It's part of the play! - It's not part of the play! Somebody do something! Listen, they didn't really hurt him. I still haven't got my money, she hasn't got her bag. - It's no joke, huh? - It's just part of the performance. Oh, some performance. Where's his money? I don't know what to do. Listen, this happens every performance. - Oh, we'll get it later, then. - All right. Come on, let's go up to the next stage. Come on. I'm not gonna go in there, that's for sure. - Well, that's, you know... - All right. Where's the theat...? Well, where's he gonna be? Well, he'll meet you after the performance. Hey, lady! You. You, come up here. I'm talking to you. I said get up here. Go ahead. Yeah, the one with the stupid look on her face. Yeah, in the green coat. You, Miss Blondie. Get up here. - I'd like my purse back. - She's not a blonde! She's a nigger with blonde hair. Get the fuck up here, lady. Get up here, now! You hear? - What the hell is going on here? - Shut up, mister. - Hey, take it easy. - Are you kidding or something? I don't want you to talk to me like that. I didn't ask you nothing. I said get up here. Now, I want all of you up here now, 'cause we're gonna go through something that you been waiting for, niggers. I'd like to go to the theater. Yeah, I think you want to go. Now, get up here! All of you, get up here! Okay, mother fuckers, move! Now! Oh, my God, I think he's got a gun! That's right, it's a gun and it kills. Now, move! Come on, fatso, move!

What are you doing? What are you doing? Need any help? Need any help? Okay, I'm gonna deputize you fellows. Thank you, sir. It wasn't them, it was him! - It's okay. - Don't touch me! Come on, you're a nigger. Now, what's your real name? - What's your real name? - That's my real name. That's my real name, I'm telling ya! I'm not kidding you, officer, I mean it. They got my wallet and my papers. What's his real name? How does he know? He doesn't even know me! Freeman! Martin Freeman! I know him! My name is Zinn, Murray Zinn. Prime Minister of the Black Panthers! I know him. He tried to bomb my house! - Where do you live, Martin? - I live up in Scarsdale. Scarsdale?! What do you mean Scarsdale?! Come on, Martin, what's this, huh? Avon... Avon Street! Avon Street! Come on, Martin, where do you live? - I live on Avon Street in Scarsdale. - Goddamn nigger! What? He lives on 147th Street. That's his brother. They're always together. What's his name? His name's June Bug! They call him June Bug! - June Bug. - I'm Professor Vymil. That's a perfect nigger name. June Bug what, Freeman? - Professor Vymil. - Man, watch out! - Professor Weimar? - Paul Vymil. A real comedian over here, Professor Weimar! You know what I got here? A bunch of fucking liars. Come on, everybody, get out, huh? Come on, everybody outside! I'll get you. We're gonna have to shoot anybody who tries to escape! Everybody out! Move it! Come on! You goddamn niggers! - Put 'em out of here! - Niggers! Come on! Be black, baby! Be black, baby, be black! Outta sight? All right! Be black, baby! Be black, baby! Be black! Be black! Remember, now.

Good audience, good audience! Very good! Gotta hand it to them. - Outta sight, now. - Glad you enjoyed the show. - Was that in good taste? - Yeah. Well, Clive... Clive Barnes was really right. That was some experience! It was a great, great show. Great theater. I'm gonna tell all my friends they've got to come. They've all really got to come. Except they should have called it... It was really something. ... Humiliate the Honky or Hump the Honky, but it was great theater. How about you, sir? It was magnificent, a magnificent experience. I'm tickled I came. It made you feel what it felt like to be a Negro. I mean, it really gave you the... to be black. It really makes you stop and think, really. Certainly I've worried about the problems, the... the... oh, the... you could almost say the sicknesses in our society. But it was invigorating. It was... I-I find it hard to think! Listen to that stupid shit! Oh, man, fuck them, you know. Kick their behinds, and they still go for it. I don't think they learned a thing. We have to go to those projects up there with the silent middle class, in those projects, where they're sitting with their pipes right now, in their chairs, reading the New York Times... you have to go up there, and you have to blow their minds. Just do it, man! Go in there and blow the fuck out of 'em! ...table of contents, table of contents... Ah, contents. ""Introduction, 13. ""One, Collective Behavior. Two, the Countryside vs. The City.

Hi, my name is Harry Jameson. I work for MetLife. Yes, pleased to meet you. Are you a member of the club? ""The urban guerrilla must become and remain anonymous..."" Okay, Joyce, go in through the playground. - Right. - Hurry up. Okay, man, head for the lobby of the west building. Stay low. Move fast. Okay, listen, we've got to go straight across the plaza. Be very cool. Let's go. When we hit the pillars, let's move. Come on. - Hi, Jessica, how are you? - Fine, and you? I'm okay... You stay back. Where are you from? Do you have permission to do this? Excuse me. Shit! Try that one! Get back. Would you like to buy some shares in black today? Really, you could at least be careful. This elevator's much too crowded. Do you know what it's like to be a black man in America today, Mr. James M. Russick? Sick. S-l-C-K. Come on, pig, open this goddamn door! Okay, this is your last chance. Hey, what is this? Be black, baby! I want to take my bike out. Oh. Now stay tuned for N.I. T.'s award-winning program, Homegrown Happening. - Honey? - Yeah? What do you want for dinner? What do I want for dinner? Mmm. Thank you. Here. - Whatever you'd like. - We've got turkey... ...beef, or fried chicken, and I have a Mexican one in the freezer. Well, I've been making enough decisions this week, and I think you can make that one. Okay, Mr. Decision-Maker. Come on, Daisy. Come, let's have din-din. - Come on, sweetie. - She's all right, honey. Leave her. - Honey! - Yeah? You know what I read in TV Guide today? No, what did you read in TV Guide today? - They cancelled Peyton Place. - Oh, that's too bad. I can't believe it! I'm so depressed about it. I mean, you know, I've been watching that show four or five years. I feel as if I know those people. They're like my friends and neighbors. Must be a blow to those actors when they lose a series like that. I hear that after a few years, three or four or something, you become a millionaire. I'd like to go out there and sell a few policies to them, huh? How'd you like to go to Hollywood, hmm? Sell some of the actors some policies? Met has great offices in Los Angeles. That reminds me, the other day I sold a policy to Harry Jameson. He's kind of a friend of mine, and he told my supervisor, Joe McMann, he told Joe about my style and how well I sold the policy, and he said that Joe seemed a little nervous, as if I was doing too well, you know. Thought maybe I was bucking for his position. - I think he was right. - He's jealous! You keep up the good work, honey. You keep it up. You're a real plugger. Oh, honey! Yeah? Did you think about what I asked you? - What's that? - About the dishwasher. Oh, yeah, I did think about that. I was just selling a policy to someone out on Staten Island, and he had a beautiful washer for $90, and he sort of implied that if I didn't buy the washer, he wouldn't take the policy, he'd buy it from Prudential. Oh, honey, I don't want a secondhand washer. I don't want something everybody else has put their dirty old dishes in. Well, I wouldn't worry about it. It's a very good one, and we can't afford to get anything better at this point. I mean, it's better than buying one for $300 or $400. We have too many payments. We have the car payments, we have this rug that you bought. What color is it? Did you ever think of that? - My kitchen happens to be yellow. - It's white. White?! I don't want a white dishwasher! Everybody has 'em! Oh, come on, honey, I want it to match the kitchen. So what color do you want? I want yellow. Oh, now, listen, we can get a yellow one in a few years. Oh, honey, you just never think about those things. You don't know anything about kitchens. - Don't worry, it'll work out... - Honey! What's the matter? Are you all right? I feel something. Are you okay? It's too much for me. I just can't take it. - Just take it easy. Don't worry. - I just can't take all this housework... ...and all the cooking and all the laundry and everything. It's just too much for me. - Okay. Don't worry. - I'm just exhausted! - Look, look. Okay... - I can't handle it. All right, all right. Now, look, from now on, from now on, I'm gonna do everything. I'm gonna call the agency right away. We're gonna get some colored help. It's very cheap. We can afford it. I'm gonna borrow on the policy. Nothing is more important than our child, do you understand? Oh, honey. - Nothing. Don't worry... - What about me? Oh, he really kicked, honey. Did he really? Yeah? Let me listen. Don't press so! I'm not pressing. It's my child, honey. I can't hear anything, though. Can't hear anything? Well, stop pressing so hard! You're gonna kill the kid! You almost gave me a miscarriage, carrying me over here! Okay, okay. Take it easy, honey. You're very excited now. You're very excitable. I'm gonna call the doctor right now. I'm gonna do all the work. You're not gonna do anything. I'm gonna work until we get a maid, okay? Now, just take it easy. I'm gonna take the laundry out now, okay? Now, take it easy. All right, I'll be right back. And now, from our studios in New York, the Now News with John Winnicove. This is John Winnicove with the evening report. This afternoon, I stood on the former site of the Community Co-op. As you know, the building was completely leveled by an explosion last Friday night. Over the past few days, the police and special agents of the FBI have discovered that the explosion emanated from the laundry room, and are even now sifting through the rubble in an effort to determine the cause or causes or person or persons responsible for this truly horrible holocaust. This afternoon we were on the scene, speaking with relatives of former tenants and friends, and we switch to that report now. Avery Gunnz. I-I don't live in the building, but I was on my way... I-I was visiting my sister last night, and I left my wallet there, and I'm really upset. I had my driver's license and my credit cards, and I don't know what to do. It's a terrible thing. - You think it's a good thing, sir? - Yes, I think it's a good thing. I think a lot of people have dogs in this neighborhood. I think we'll be able to walk our dogs now. I think we need more room like this. Well, now, you weren't a resident here, obviously. No, I'm not a resident, but we need more... A lot of these things are going to be happening. They're doing quite a bit of this, and I think they'll be blowing them up faster than they can build 'em. I live in that red house across the street, and I can see from my window. I can see all the entries that were here. Strange people always walking in and out, all hours of the night and day. All the time. I see. So you attribute it to someone who's just walking in and out. - Some funny person did this. - Funny person. I see. - Sir, did you have an opinion? - Yes. - What is your name? - Joe. Dr. Joe King. - Dr. King, you say? - Yeah. Right. - A doctor of medicine? - I'm a psychiatrist, yeah. Would you like to turn right to the camera here so we could face the camera? Now, Dr. King, what are your feelings about this? Well, you know, it probably is the result of somebody who cracked under the pressures of our society. You know, we have such intense materialistic pressures, and there's such a tremendous gap between those who make it and those who don't. And you feel most definitely that that frustration is the kind of thing that is taken out here. It's the kind of thing... We're raised on violence in America, you know? People are... all these toy guns, and the war in Vietnam... - Excuse me, sir. - Excuse me, what is your name? My name is Jon Rubin, sir, and I just came back from Vietnam. I spent 18 months over there, and I'd just like to say that... What were you doing over there? Would you mind telling us what...? I happen to be a demolition expert. You might be able to give us some clue. We've been trying to determine the... As a matter of fact, I was noticing this building, getting away from that, and it looks like a pretty good job. Uh, you know, I hate to say it, but it looks like it was done by an expert, at least. I'd just like to say, sir, I'm just sick of this... - Well, please, we're on the air. - Sorry, sir, that's the way I feel. I'm just kinda annoyed about the fact that, well, I just come back from Vietnam after we kinda, you know, sweep up the country there. We've got 500,000 men over there, and then we come back to this country, and what do we see? We see some kind of mess on the floor, and people killed... I mean, a fellow like this has never seen any... You haven't seen any action. You ever been in the Army? You ever been over in Korea or Vietnam or in the Second War? You haven't seen what I've seen. I've seen arms shot off. I've seen faces blown up. - I've seen... taken off. - Hey. I'm sick of all that... I'm sick of all that... Excuse me, please, we have to... I'm sorry. We have to... I-I don't mean to push you, but we have to get off the air now. Do you have anything you might just like to say in summary? Well, I would like to say something, if you don't mind. No, of course not. I'd like to say hello to my mother, if you don't mind. Uh... of course. Thank you. Hi, Ma!,  Illumination...   Illumination   Illumination   Illumination   Yeah!  -  Illumination  -  Illumination   Illumination...  Oh. Oh, my gosh.  Let's go crazy   Whoo!   Let's go crazy   Let's go crazy, let's go crazy   If you don't like   The world you're living in   Take a look around   At least you got friends   You see, I called my old lady   For a friendly word  She picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor   ""Ah-ah"" is all I heard  Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down?   Oh, no, let's go   Let's go crazy   Let's get nuts  Let's look for the purple banana  Till they put us in the truck   Let's go!   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  -  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  -  Yeah, yeah  -  We're all excited  -  We're all excited  -  Don't know why  -  Don't know why   Maybe it's 'cause   We're all gonna die   When we do  -  What's it all for?  -  What's it all for?  You better live now before the grim reaper comes  Knocking on your door, tell me  Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down?   Oh, no, let's go  -  Let's go crazy  -  Let's go crazy  -  Let's get nuts  -  Let's get nuts  Let's look for the purple banana  Till they put us in the truck, let's go!   Come on, baby   Let's get nuts   Yeah   Crazy  Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down   Oh, no, let's go  -  Let's go crazy  -  Let's go crazy  -  Let's get nuts  -  Let's get nuts  Let's look for the purple banana  Till they put us in the truck   Let's go!   Dr. Everything'll Be All Right  Will make everything go wrong   Let's go!   Yeah, yeah   Let's go!  What's going on? No time to explain. Run away. Oh, hey, Sammy. You really got those moves locked down now, hmm? I sure do, Mr. Moon. Yeah, look at you. Great job, everybody. Great job. - Thanks, Mr. Moon. - Yeah! I think we pretty much nailed it. So, is she here? There. See the dog, middle third row? Oh, she's younger than I imagined. Yeah, well, supposedly, she's the best scout in show business. I can't tell if-if she's enjoying it. Come on, let's get a better view.  This I know   He told me, ""Don't worry about it""   He told me, ""Don't worry no more""   We both know we can't go...  And how we doing over here, Miss Crawly? Oh, very good, Mr. Moon. So far, I counted nine smiles, two belly laughs and five chuckles. Uh, though the last one could've just been gas. Well, that's proof, right? She must like the show. - Oh, my gosh. You think so? - I hope so. All right, now, keep up the good work. Come on, everybody, back to positions. She'd be, like, cuckoo not to love the show. Dream big dreams. That's what I always said, right? Mm-hmm. Well, looks like we're about to take this show to the entertainment capital of the world. Mr. Moon, she's leaving. - Huh? - She's leaving the show.  He told me, ""You'll never...""  Miss Crawly, stay right here. - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna follow that dog. -  Whoo!  -  I can't feel my face   When I'm with you  I can't feel my face, yeah...  Good heavens! - Hey, Nana. - What are you doing? The scout is leaving.  I can't feel my face...  Ah, so she is. Hurry. Uh, Suki? Suki Lane? I'm Buster Moon. Uh, hi. So glad you could make it. Um, would you like some popcorn? Oh, no, thanks. I'm not staying for the second half, so... Oh. But, uh, we thought you were enjoying it. I mean, not that we were watching you or anything. It really is a cute little show. Just not what we're looking for. But-but wait. Y-You got to see the second act. I'm-I'm telling you, it's a smash. Okay, Mr. Moon, can I be honest? - Of course. - Are you sure? 'Cause folks say that when they don't really mean it. No, please, please, be as honest as you like. You're not good enough. What? Taxi! You know, maybe I will have that popcorn. Look, you've got a nice little local theater here, and it's great for what it is, but trust me, you'd never make it in the big leagues. Bye, now. Well, what did she say? I'll be right back. Nah. Mm-mm. A few laughs, bunch of quirky ideas. But, anyway, about Thursday... Oh, my... Yeah, hi. It's me again. Whoa. - Whoa. - I'll call you back. Are you out of your mind? When are you holding auditions? Tomorrow. But there is no way you'll... Uh, listen, it... Get out of the road, you idiot! Hey, do you mind? I'm in a meeting here. Could-could you at least give us a chance to try out for your boss? Driver, could you please lose this maniac? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. No, no, no, no! When are you gonna come down?   When are you going to land?  I should have stayed on the farm  I should have listened to my old man  You know you can't hold me forever   I didn't sign up with you  I'm not a present for your friends to open  This boy's too young to be singing   The blues   Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah   Ah, ah, ah  Mr. Moon? So goodbye, yellow brick road  Where the dogs of society howl  You can't plant me in your penthouse   I'm going back to my plow  Back to the howling old owl in the woods  Hunting the horny-back toad...  Oh, for heaven's sake. What can I say, Nana? - I'm a failure. - Oh, poppycock. I was reaching too high. Honestly, one negative comment, and it's all, ""Woe is me."" Nana, come on. She said I'm not good enough. I mean, heck, I've just been told that my destiny, all of my hopes and dreams, uh, they all end right here. Well, what did you expect? That she would drop to her knees and declare you a genius? Roll out the red carpet for the great Buster Moon! She-she ran me off the road into a canal. Well, you're still in one piece, aren't you? Well, yeah, but... Well, anyone who dares set out to follow their dreams is bound to face a lot worse than a dip in the canal. Ah, Hobbs. I found him. Uh, bring the car round, will you? - There's a good chap. - I-I... I just thought she'd at least see we deserved a shot. Never mind what this person you don't even know said. Do you think you're good enough? - Of course, but... - Then you must fight for what you believe in. Guts, stamina, faith. These are the things you need now, and without them... Well, maybe that scout was right. Maybe you're not good enough.  Ah   Oh   Ah   Oh...  Oh, I... No, I know, Rosita, but trust me on this. It'll be totally worth it. And listen, I'm outside her place now, so can you call the others and have 'em meet up in half an hour? Great. Thank you.  Off, off with your head  Dance, dance till you're dead  -  Heads will roll  -  Heads will roll   Heads will roll  -  Heads will roll  -  Heads will roll   On the floor   Off, off, off with your head   Dance, dance   Dance till you're dead, dead   Off, off, off with your head  Dance, dance, dance till you're dead.  Thank you so much. Good night. Moon. Hey. Wow. You were great out there. I got to go back out for an encore. Okay. Hey, but what are you doing - after the show? - Uh, nothing. Well, listen, I know this is crazy short notice, but you always said you'd come back to work with us - when the time was right. - Of course. Well, this is that time. Here, paycheck. I'm getting the gang together to go audition - for this huge show... - Just-just a second. Hey, Rick, how come you're only paying me half what the other acts get? I pay what I think you're worth, sweetheart. Oh, okay. See, I have this rule about not letting guys like you tell me what I'm worth, so, you know, unless I get paid like everyone else, I'm out of here. This is the only club in town. Where else you gonna play? I have no idea, but I'm sure as heck not sticking around here. Let's go. Ooh! Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. You-you got to do the encore. Hey, Ash! Deal with it, sweetheart. Redshore City Bus five leaving from park 15... Okay, I got the tickets. Anyone seen Miss Crawly? Here you go, Johnny. - Here's yours, and... - Mr. Moon. Uh, uh, I'm sorry, but I'm really having second thoughts about this. What? No, no, no, wait. All right, last call. Let's go. - Now, just a second. - Johnny's right. I mean, that theater scout, she didn't think we were good enough. - She sounds like a jerk. - Yeah, total jerk. Yeah, but she's wrong... dead wrong. There's a reason our show is sold out every night, and I'm telling you, her boss is gonna love it. Ooh. Or maybe we could just, like, do a different show, you know? Gunter, please, I got this. Seriously, I have this idea for, like, a space musical. All right, we're rolling out here. You don't want to hear about the space musical? Guys, come on! Wait! Listen, you guys, I have dreamt of performing in Redshore City since I was a little kid. And besides, I just convinced my husband to babysit for the next 24 hours, and I am not gonna waste an opportunity like that. So come on. We've got nothing to lose. Here, Ash. You come in on page two. Wait. We're just gonna rehearse this here - at the back of the bus? - Yes, we are. - Course we are. - Yep. We got to get this show in the best shape ever. Ah, Miss Crawly, you made it. Good. You are an angel, and we're sure gonna need that... Whoa! What the... Uh, well, you did say, ""Dress to impress.""  Time   All the long red lines   That take control  Of all the smoke like streams   That flow into your dreams   That big blue open sea   That can't be crossed   That can't be climbed   Just born between...  Absolutely right. Let's just cut that line and have you just play the guitar part through the whole scene. - Got it. - Guys, we're here. All right. Let's go spread a little Moon Theater magic. - Woo-hoo! - Come on! No. No? What do you mean, ""no""? For the last time, sir, no appointment, no entry. - Um... - Sir, do I need to call security? We should go. Yes, you should. Next, please. I don't like this. Hi. How may I help you? I'm here to see Mr. Crystal for the presentation. This is so unfair. She's, like, totally unfair, that lady. I mean, why's she got to be so snotty about it? I got all dressed up for nothing. Let's just find somewhere for lunch - and hang out. - Everyone, in here. Quick. Get in. Hmm. - Oh, come on. - So dark in here. - What's going on? - Shh! I got to think. - I've got to think. I've got to think. - Mr. Moon? - I've got to think. - I'm not so good in small spaces. - Okay, okay, okay. - Ow! Somebody stepped on my trotter. - Sorry. Sorry. - Okay, honey. Come on. - Let's get you out of here. - Aha! Look at this. Meena. Do you think that's kind of your size? White shirt now red, my bloody nose  Sleepin', you're on your tippy-toes  Creepin' around like no one knows   Think you're...  Hey, Ricky. Hi. Crystal Entertainment. - Uh, hold one moment, sir. - Phew. - I'll-I'll connect you. - Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Everybody, hold on. Oh, Mr. Moon? Hold tight, Miss Crawly. Make your girlfriend mad type   Might seduce your dad type   I'm the bad guy   Duh   I like it...  Good job. Now, into the elevator. Quick. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Meena! Come on!  I'll let you play the role   I'll be your animal...  We could all get arrested for...  I'm only good at bein' bad   Bad...  Everybody, mop. Uh... Where are you going now? I'm gonna find somewhere to change out of this stuff. Ah.  Like a vendetta-ta  I-I-I see how this is gonna go  Touch me and you'll never be alone  I-Island breeze and lights down low   No one has to know   In the middle of the night   In my dreams  You should see the things we do   Baby, mm  In the middle of the night...  Look, that's him. That is the Mr. Crystal.  I know I'm gonna be with you  Garbage.  So I take my time...  -  Hi  -  My name is  -  What?  -  My name is  -  Who?  -  My name is...   Abra-Abracadabra   Abracadabra...   Bangs, she bangs  Oh, baby, when she moves, she moves...   Hello...   What do you want from me?   Why do you run from me?   What are you wondering?   What do you know?   Why are you scared of...  You used to call me on my cell phone  Late night when you need my lo...   Talk to me, baby  I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa-oh  Let's lose our minds and go crazy, crazy   I-I-I-I-I, I keep on hopin' we'll eat   Cake by the ocean, uh   Walk for me, baby  I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh  Let's lose our minds and go crazy...  Okay, everybody, if you can leave immediately, single file, we'd appreciate that. Thank you very much. Jerry, for the love of... - Sorry, sir. - Well, where's the next group, Jerry? Why am I standing here waiting? How about I... I just... I just, uh... Be useful or be gone, okay? Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Um, okay. Um, you. Hey. Hey. Yeah, you. Little guy, you're here for the audition? Uh, yes. Yeah, yeah, yes, we are. Guys, we're on right now. - Now? - What? Your name? Hey, your name, please? Uh, it's Buster Moon from the New Moon Theater. And we're very excited to share our story with you today, sir. Right, guys? Yeah, great. Now, get to it. Of course. Yes. Okay, guys, just like we rehearsed. This is the story of an ordinary high school girl who discovers... Stop. Stop? He wants you to stop. ""Ordinary"" and ""school."" Two words I will never be associated with. - Never. Never. - Where the heck did you dig these guys up from, huh? If you could all leave very quickly, we'd appreciate that, please. I need big shows, Jerry. - Big ideas! - Yes, sir, big. The biggest. Hey, I have a big one. Okay, honey. Come on, let's go. You know, the sci-fi musical. - That's big, right? - Um, uh... I mean, it's got the aliens and the robots and the lasers and these amazing songs from, like, Clay Calloway to... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Clay Calloway? I love Clay Calloway. I know, right? I mean, doesn't everybody? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See, Jerry? This is exactly the kind of big idea I'm talking about. - Yes, sir. - So, uh... so what's the show called? What's it called? Um... - Gunter, you, uh... - you want to... ...uh, tell Mr. Crystal what it's called? Uh-huh. It's called Out of This World. Out of This World. That's right. Just imagine it. Ash? Uh, yeah, I got it. A spectacular musical that takes your audience out of this world.  I wanna run   I want to hide   I wanna tear down the walls   That hold me inside  I love this song.  I wanna reach out   And touch the flame  Where the streets have no name.  Sir, your lunch meeting with... Oh, my... Not now. Moon, how did you get in here? Hey, he said not now. Psst. Yeah, I heard him. Thanks, Jerry. Are you telling me you-you got Clay Calloway's permission to use his song? - Well, what if I told you I did? - Ah. Okay, so what, you got some kind of personal connection to this guy? - How else would I get it? - Moon! Wait, if you know him, then you could get him in the show, right? Oh, that'd be huge for me. Huge. Sir, I'm sorry, but seriously? You think this little guy from nowhere can get Clay Calloway in the show? Well, Suki, for your information, I am not just a little guy from nowhere. Consider it done, sir. I'll give you three weeks, Moon. Three weeks to get this show up and running, okay? Yes, sir. Thank you. Moon, do you really know Clay Calloway? Shh, shh. Not now. - Jerry. - Oh! Right here, sir. I want these guys to start work right away. Set 'em up with our designers, our dancers, whatever they need. And get 'em rooms at the hotel, okay? The very best suites. The whole shaboodle. Yes, sir. Yes, of course. Uh, hey, one last thing. Don't you ever do nothing to make me look bad. You got that? Oh, I will never let that happen, sir. You better not, or I'll throw you off the roof. Great job, everyone. Take it away, Raoul. Oh, my gosh. - Is this really happening? - Yeah! We're playing Redshore City, baby! Yes, we are, Gunter. Gunter, sci-fi musical? You're a genius. Yeah, well, Mama always said, ""Gunter, you're not as stupid as your papa."" No, you're not. Hey, Suki. No hard feelings, huh? You have no idea what you're getting into. Whoa. - Are you out of your mind? - What? Clay Calloway? I'm, like, his biggest fan, and I can tell you, the guy is a recluse. Seriously, after his wife died, no one's seen him in over 15 years. Ah. That's not good. No, it's not. Uh... Miss Crawly, I need you to help me find Clay Calloway. An address, a phone number, anything. - But we've got to find that guy. - Yes, sir.  Think about it...  Good morning! I'm Linda Le Bon, and have I got some hot news for you. Down in the heart or hidden...  Infamous billionaire Jimmy Crystal has hired - an unknown theater producer... - What? ...by the name of Buster Moon. Look inside your heart and I'll look inside mine  Things look so bad everywhere   Everywhere  In this whole world, what is fair?  We walk the line and try to see   Try to see  Falling behind in what could be  Oh, oh, bring me a higher love   Bring me a higher love, oh   Bring me a higher love   Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?   That love, that love   Bring me higher love  Love, that love, that love...  Okay, so this guy is coming in from that side, and it's, like, cuckoo crazy, and then I think we should have, like, this cool alien tango scene. ""Alien tango scene."" Oh. I love it. Wait. I've got a better idea. What if it was, like, a big underwater scene instead? - Underwater? - Yeah, yeah. I'm sure of this. Write it down. - Mm, okay. - Wait, wait. Stop your clicky-clacky. I have a better idea. Uh, you can't keep changing your mind. Why? Why? Because in exactly 20 minutes, the stage crew are coming here to start work on our show, and we need to lock this stuff down. Oh, my gosh, they're early. Ooh, and I want to have, like, this beautiful love scene... Miss Crawly, anything on Calloway? - Hmm, not a thing. - Oh, geez. Ah, Mr. Moon. We're your production team, and we're here to start... Yes, yes, yes. Uh, you're here to work on the show. And I would gladly invite you all in right now, but... We should totally do, like, a battle scene! Gunter, no, not now. I just need a little more time to, you know, hammer out a few minor, little details, so would it be okay if you all could come back in, like, I don't know, an hour? Or maybe four? And I really appreciate your patience. Thank you so much. Hmm. Okay. Okay. That was not a great start. - Oh, look, it's a gift from Mr. Crystal. - Huh. It-it says, um, ""Don't screw up, Moon, or else."" Ooh, I've got a better idea.  What about the mambo?  And everyone's in space suits   A great idea, I think so.  Good morning. May I have everyone's attention, please? Thank you. Yes. Okay, um, on behalf of myself and the cast, I just want to say that to be given this incredible opportunity to work with you all here at the Crystal Tower Theater, well, it's an honor for all of us. And I believe that, together, we can make a show that'll take the audience out of this world. And a big thanks to Steve over here for staying up all night to make this model. Great work, Steve. And here she is, folks. The star of our show, Rosita. That's you, baby! The lead role? Trust me, you are perfect for it. Wait till my kids hear about this. And so the story goes like this. Rosita plays an astronaut searching for a missing space explorer. Together, with their trusty robot... - That's me. - Mm-hmm, yes. They follow the trail across four planets. There's a planet of war, a planet of love, a one of despair and one of joy. And each planet will have its own spectacular musical number performed by one of our terrific cast. A-And how does it end? Do I find the explorer? Oh, we have no clue what we're going to do at the end. Gunter, no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We do have great ideas for the ending. We just... All right. We've only got three weeks to make this reality, folks. Let's get to work. Johnny, you are gonna play an alien warrior in a fantastic battle scene. - Yes! - Come with me. Johnny, I want you to meet your fellow dancers. - Hello, lads. - Hey, how you doing? Uh, wait. You said mine was a battle scene. Well, it is, but Gunter saw it as more of a... a dance battle. - Yeah! - Okay... Johnny, don't worry. You're gonna be working with the number one choreographer in Redshore City. ""Klaus Kickenklober."" Yep. Klaus will turn you into a pro in no time. - Okay. - Uh... Mr. Moon? Meena, you okay? Gunter said I'm in a romantic scene and, uh, uh... I have to kiss someone. Yeah. It's gonna be an amazing, beautiful, romantic scene. Mr. Moon, I've never even had a boyfriend or any of that stuff. Ah, don't you worry. I'm gonna cast a great partner for you. - Promise? - Promise. Mr. Moon, we're ready to start building the rest of the sets and... Okay, okay, okay, listen. I don't exactly know what they are yet, so could you give me one more night to figure this out? Hey, this guy doesn't have it figured out, so we can't start work right now. Mason? - Did everybody hear that? - Hey, don't... He does not have the show figured out. I'm looking into his eyes, - and all I see is fear. - Uh-uh. Mm-mm. Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen... - And a little bit of shame. - Yeah, yeah. Look, I-I think everyone heard you, Mason. Thank you so much. Gunter... we have work to do. And then I'm thinking, Ash, you know, she can, like, totally have a duet with Clay Calloway, 'cause, like, she's a star that is, like, guiding them all the way back home again. Yes, Gunter. That's perfect for Ash. Mommy! Oh, my darlings, you're here. Yeah, Johnny! Oh. My gosh, I wasn't expecting you till the morning. I know, but they couldn't wait to see you. The star of the show, huh? Can you believe it? It's literally my dream come true. - I know. Mwah. - Ew. I am so proud of you, honey. Uh... help. Mr. Moon, I found him. - Clay Calloway? - Yeah. I found his home address. No way. Yes way. Miss Crawly, I'm gonna need you to go visit him first thing tomorrow. - Oh, yes, sir. - You'll need to rent a car and take him a letter and, uh, maybe that fruit basket. Yes, the fruit basket. - You got that? - Got it. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. We're dancing. We're dancing. We're holding. We're holding. Stay en pointe. Shuffle and hold. I said hold, Johnny. He's not holding. - And one, two, three, four... - All right, I'm... I am trying. Let's not forget, this is Redshore City, not your little local theater. And five, six, seven, eight. Ryan, that was excellent. Johnny, you are doing it wrong. That was awful. Come on, Johnny. You can do better. - He's freaking me out. - Johnny. - I'm trying. - Thrust. And thrust, and thrust. You're not thrusting, Johnny. - Come on. Thrust. - Thrust, and thrust. Still not thrusting. Can you thrust, please? Five, six, seven, and tippy-toes, tippy-toes. I don't see your tippy-toes. Oh, come on, he's having a laugh. - Tippy-toes. Come on, let's go. - Seven, and... That is rubbish, terribly poor, really bad. That bloke absolutely hates me. Hang in there, Johnny. The first week's always tough. Yeah. You're right. You're right. Meena, come and meet your partner. Oh, my gosh, he's here? Yep. He's called Darius. Won a ton of awards. And I think you guys are gonna have great chemistry.  If I was your boyfriend   I'd never let you go   Keep you on my arm, girl   You'd never be alone   I can be a gentleman   Anything you want  - Wow. -  If I...  That's really great, Darius. Uh, yeah, it's a scene from the last show I was in. I'm sure you heard of it... Hope Against Hope. Gosh, I won every award in town. Uh, the Golden Piccolo for Best Crying. Uh, the Archer Newman Award for Outstanding Hair. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, my costar, she was just like you, Gina. - She was, uh... - Uh, it's Meena. Excuse me? M-My name, it's Meena, not Gina. Yeah, okay. In the future, if you could not interrupt me, that would be way better. Okay, okay. Let's rehearse.  Don't wanna close my eyes   Don't wanna fall asleep  -  'Cause I'd miss you, babe  - Uh, uh, uh... -  And I  - Oh.  Don't wanna miss a thing...  No, no, no, no, no, uh... This song is not helping her at all.  When I saw you in that dress   Looking so beautiful   I don't deserve this   Darling, you look   Perfect tonight.  Oh, boy. So, where's Calloway? Uh, he'll be here very soon. - Mm, is that so? - It is indeed so. In fact, my trusty assistant Miss Crawly is on her way to meet him right now. -  Wake up  -  Wake up  -  Grab a brush and put a little makeup  -  Makeup  -  Hide your scars to fade away the shake-up  -  Doo-doo  -  Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?  -  The table  -  Here you go, create another fable  -  You wanted to  Grab a brush and put a little makeup...  Your destination is on the right. On the right. Okay. Oh. Oh. Mr. Calloway? Hello? Is anybody home? Ooh. Okay, I got you. Clay Callowa... Oopsie-daisy. Hello. I can't take your call right now, but please leave me a message after the beep. Miss Crawly, it's me, Mr. Moon. I haven't heard from you in a while. I'm starting to worry here. Moon! Mr. Crystal. Your set designs are a disgrace. What? I'm just messing with you. Where's your sense of humor, huh? Anyway, this is my daughter Porsha. Hey. Nice to meet you, Porsha. She wants to meet Calloway. Big fan, aren't you, baby? Oh, my gosh, I'm, like, so into vintage right now. So, where is he? Uh, well... I-I'm not expecting Clay on set just yet. - I mean... - Wait. Is this, like, a sky-fi show? Uh, sci-fi? Yes. Yes, it is. Oh, my gosh, I love sky-fi. Mr. Moon! - We're ready on the tower. - Oh. Thank you, Sasha. We, uh... We're gonna rehearse, Mr. Crystal, so... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You go and do your rehearsing thing. - Go, go, go, go. - Playback. Okay. All set. Just remember to release the safety catch before you jump, okay? Okay, yeah. Is Mommy gonna jump off that? She sure is. Wow!  If you want it   Take it   I should've said it before   Tried to hide it   Fake it   I can't pretend anymore...  Uh... Oh, my gosh. Gunter. Mr. Moon, I think Rosita's having, like, a major freak-out up here. Oh, no. Hey, Moon, you really think the mommy pig's gonna pull this off? Mommy pig? Absolutely, sir. Believe me, there's nothing Rosita can't do. - I can't do this. - Why didn't you tell me - you were afraid of heights? - I wasn't. I-I mean, I've never been afraid in my whole life before, but I... suddenly, I just... I don't know what happened to me. - Did my kids see that? - Hey, you guys. What's going on up here? Who is that? Ooh. Can I try? No, no, no, no, no, no. I-I can't let you jump off here. Daddy, he won't let me jump! Moon, come on. Let her do the thing. - Yay! - Porsha, wait! Whoa, hey. Uh, just a minute. I love it! Whee! It's easy! All right, let's get you down, Rosita. Oh, my gosh, you guys. This is exactly like the dream I had last night. Seriously, you-you were all there. And you and you and that funny-looking guy over there. - Um... - All of you. And you asked me to sing for you. I... I did? Yeah. And so, I was like...  This girl is on fire  This girl is on fire   She's walking on fire   This girl is on fire.  Well, that's a lovely dream you had there, Porsha. Um, okay, everybody, back to first positions, please. Here, Rosita. You want to try with the helmet this time? Oh, but now I know what the dream meant. Yeah. She's afraid. She'll never be able to play the part. But here I am, and I'm young, and I'm not afraid at all. I-I can't just give you Rosita's part. I mean... Moon, walk with me. What's wrong with you, huh? What, you got a kink in your think? It's just that I wrote this part for Rosita and... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me tell you something, Moon. What you got here is an opportunity to make me happy. And when an opportunity like that comes along, you'd better grab it! You get me? - Uh... - What? You don't think my daughter's good enough for your show? No, Mr. Crystal. Well, I-I think she's wonderful. Oh, good. So you'll figure it out. I'll... Yes, I will. Daddy, I'm hungry for French toast. Jerry! - Yes, sir. - Get her some French toast. And, by the way, I like the set. That whole ""rings moving around"" thing. Creative, quirky. I like it. Bye, Daddy. Mm-kay. Let's have Porsha measured for a costume right away, please. Yes, right away, people. Would you just get the French toast, Jerry? I'm getting the French toast, Suki. You okay? A little shaky, but I'm okay. Yeah. You know, uh... Look, maybe this is for the best, huh? I mean, you really were scared up there. Right. I'll write you another part, Rosita. A really... a really, really great part. - You all right? - Oh, I'm fine. - Really? - Yes. You're all very sweet, but like Mr. Moon says, this is probably for the best. - Seriously? - Seriously. I am completely fine with this. Hey, honey. Are you... you-you're sure you're not, you know, upset? No, I-I'm good. Um, can I please just have the bathroom to myself - for five minutes? - You got it. Okay, kids, go get your jammies on! Thank you for choosing to drive with Royalty. All right. Bye-bye.  Yo, yo, yo, they wanna know   Who's that girl?  Uh, yo, yo, come on, come on...  Oh, hello, young sir. Um, oh, yes, you'll... you'll be pleased to hear I did bring it back with a full tank. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And... Sorry I'm late, Mr. Kickenklober. I was practicing all morning. I just lost track of time. Oh, I thought maybe you had been involved in a terrible accident and we'd never have to see you again, but never mind. Seriously? Why do you have to be so mean all the time? 'Cause only when we suffer... ...can we be great. Places, everyone! Ryan, you'll be playing his opponent in the climax of the scene. Now... let's see if little Johnny has learned the steps. Whoa. S-Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. - Ow! - Wrong. Sorry. Again! Higher. So bad. Again! No! Again! Come on. Yuck! Again! - Whoa. - Come on! Man. Hot tamale, hotter than a Somali, fur coat  Ferrari, hop out the stu', jump in the coupe  Big Dipper on top of the roof  Flexing on... as hard as I can  Eating halal, driving the Lam'   Told that... I'm sorry, though  'Bout my coins like Mario, yeah, they call me Cardi B  I run this... like cardio, whoo   I said I like it like, whoo   I said I like it like, whoo   I said I like it like  Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone. Wow, wow. You are an amazing crowd. Mate, you're amazing. Much appreciated. - Thank you so much. - Uh... Uh, um... Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Okay. Thank you very much, little guy. Wow, so kind. Listen, could I buy you a coffee or, uh, maybe something to eat? Whoa, that's forward, ain't it? What? No, no, no. I didn't mean... I just would love to talk to you about maybe... Hey! You got a license to perform here? Actually, I'd love a chat. Let's go. Here you go. One volcano smoothie with extra chocolate lava. Shut up. Here. 50 bucks. Honestly, if you could just give me some dance lessons, you would literally be saving my life. Wait, if you're in a real show, how come you don't have a choreographer? I do, but it turns out he's a massive weirdo. And how do I know that you're not a weirdo? Hmm? How do I know that you're legit? Well, just come with me to rehearsals. See for yourself. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not just gonna follow some guy I don't know to rehearsals. Well, how else am I supposed to prove that I'm legit? And maybe I should stop and start confessing   Confessing, yeah   Oh, I've been shaking, I love it when you go crazy   You take all my inhibitions  What are you doing? Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  You take me places that tear up my reputation   Manipulate my decisions  Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back   Oh-oh, oh-oh  -  Oh-oh  - Yeah! Woo-hoo! There's nothing holdin' me back...  I knew you were a weirdo. There's nothing holdin' me back.  Whoa. - This is sick! - See? First positions, please. Whoa. Mate, look at that. Look at that. Hey. Who are you? Ah, it's all right. She's with me. Pleased to meet you. I'm Nooshy. I'm his dance coach. And I really love that hat. She's right. Great hat. You think some riffraff street dancer can help you more than me? - Riffraff? - Okay, okay. Hang on. She's just gonna give me some extra lessons, that's all. Oh, because I, Klaus Kickenklober, master choreographer, am not good enough for Johnny. - No, that's not what I meant. - Yes, I'm irrelevant to him. I'm just a stupid, fat, old monkey. - I don't think that at all. - I do. Shh! Please. She's only trying to help me, that's all. Dude, anyway, I only need two days with him. Two days? Ha! 200 years, more like. Two days. He'll be amazing. Oh, really? Well, if he is, I will eat my hat. Okay, everybody, from the top. Stand by, playback. Lots of energy now, and... Wha...? Miss Crawly? You can't go back there, Mr. Moon. - Never. Never. - What? What happened to you? That lion, you see, he's crazy. Crazy! Oh, he's crazy. Pew. Pew, pew. - Wow, she's a mess. - Pew, pew! Pew... So, you're not gonna go out there, are you? Gonna have to. I mean... All set over here, Mr. Moon. Okay. Playback! Stand by, Rosita. And... action! Ooh, look what you made me do   Look what you made me do  Look what you just made me do   Look what you just made me  Ooh, look what you made me do  - And cue Porsha. -  Look what you made me do  Look what you just made me do  Look what you just made me, ooh.  Take that, you nasty alien monster. Did I do good? Yeah. That was so good. Yay! Did you hear that? He thinks I'm awesome. Okay, she cannot act. Shh. I know. I know. But I got to keep Mr. Crystal happy. Take that, you nasty alien monster. Excuse me, but Mr. Crystal wants to see you. Take that, you nasty alien monster. Oh. Well, I could come by this afternoon. He means now. Right now. O... kay. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, I did. Yes, I did. - Come on in. - Whoa. This place is incredible. Pretty great, huh? So, how's it going with Calloway? Calloway? It's, uh... it's good. - Yeah. Very good. - Right, right. Well, let me ask you something. What did I do to make you disrespect me, huh? What? Oh, what? You think I'm an idiot? Some kind of bozo? No. No, sir, not at all. My team, they talked to Calloway's lawyer, and they say he's never heard of you or your show. Really? They said that? Uh... - You lied to me! - I-I didn't mean to. Okay? Honestly, I really thought I could get him. No one makes me look like a fool! No one! I-I wouldn't dream of doing that to you. I swear, if you didn't have my kid in your show, you'd be out of that window by now! Please, please, please. I-I'm so sorry. You'd better have Calloway by the end of next week, - or so help me! - I-I-I will. I-I-I'll get him. I won't let you down, sir. Oh, I know you won't let me down. - Jerry, get in here! - Yes, sir. Right here, sir. - Clean this mess up, will you? - Yes, absolutely, I'd love to. Listen up. I got to go to Calloway's, and I got to go ASAP. - Oh, no, please don't go there. - D-Don't worry. Don't worry. I know you said he's crazy, but I'll be all right. - Oh, can I go with you, please? - Uh, I don't know. Come on, you're gonna need me. I know everything about this guy. - Uh... I think you're right. - Yes! Now, listen, Gunter, you've got to figure out the ending of this show on your own. - On my own? - Yes. Miss Crawly, I need you to take charge while I'm away. - Yes, sir. - Now, listen to me. You got to bring your A game here, Miss Crawly. I'm serious. You got to be tough. - Yes, I got to be tough. - You got to be firm. Oh, and I got to be firm. Yes. And you cannot... I repeat, cannot... let production fall behind, not one little bit. Is that clear? Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir. Mason! That volcano should've been finished yesterday! - W-We're on it, Miss Crawly. - You better be! Meena, Darius, take it from the top, and this time, put a little juice in it, will you? I'm trying my best, Miss Crawly. A little juice? Hey, everybody. You're two hours late for rehearsal! Wait. Wait, where's the koala? Who are you? I'm in charge! That's who! Now, get your tail to wardrobe, sweetheart. Oh, my gosh. There he is. That's him. Holy moly, it really is. He doesn't look so scary. Mr. Calloway! - Go away! - No, please. We-we-we just want to talk to you for one minute. That's all. We are not leaving until you talk to us. Fine. If you're not coming over here, we're coming over to you. No! Stay off the fence! Don't listen to him. Stop, stop, stop! Porsha, you're still messing it up. It's not my fault. He keeps missing the catch. I think she's trying to kill me. Reset. Let's go again. Meena! Darius! We're coming to you next, and I better see some chemistry between you two. Okay, let's run these steps one more time. So, music starts, I step out, do my moves, fancy moves. Step together, drop. Gazing at each other like we're burning up with love... What are you doing with your face? Your face looks broken. What is that? Uh... I was falling in love? Yeah, Gina, listen. I'm sorry, that-that's not what falling in love with me looks like. I... I should know. I see it day after day, week after week. Let's run it again. From the top! And five, six, seven, eight. And one... Would you like some ice cream, ma'am? Or should I say, Your Majesty? Uh... I just... You look like a goddess, and, uh... and-and-and lucky for you, it's ""free ice cream for all goddesses"" day. Aw. That's cherry cheesecake, and I-I make it all myself. See, my truck's right over there. Come by anytime... Your Majesty. Ooh, that... Are you okay? Buster? You okay? Ash? Where are we? We're in Clay's house. Oh, my gosh. - Have you talked to him yet? - Uh-huh. - You have? - We were just discussing whether he'd consider being in our show. What did he say? He said no. Not in a million years. Please, Mr. Calloway. Look, you don't... you don't realize how much it would mean to have you in our show and... Will you stop your yakking? Here. Your friend left this on my property. And I want you gone in the morning. And that's why they say, ""Never meet your heroes."" Step, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Yes! Whoa, mate. You're not ready to be busting out these moves. - Sorry. - Look at you. Klaus has thrown you in the deep end and drained out all of your confidence like... Don't worry. We'll build up to it step-by-step. Just forget what Klaus told you and go with the flow.  Hey, uh, uh  I'd rather be nobody other than me  Mark my words, my talk ain't cheap  Life's a dream, but I'm not sleep   I, I feel like a work of art   I'm not easily forgot   Had to set myself apart   I'm just following my heart   I'm just following my path  I'm just here to make it last   I'm not living in the past  If you don't feel me, kiss my   Uh, uh, sultate   Uh, uh, sultate   Uh, uh, sultate.  Nailed it! Now, didn't you say you were gonna eat your hat? Well, there you go. Mmm. Yum-yum. I love it when you call me seorita   I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya...  Girl, that is your fourth today. I know, I know. But I can't stop. It's 'cause I really want to talk to him. But... but when I get close, I get nervous, so... so I just buy another ice cream. It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah.  Uh, honestly, th-this is gonna be the greatest show I have ever made. Whoa! And when you see the sets and the... Turn on that tap for me. Tap? Uh, sure. So, anyway... Whoa! Oopsie-daisy. Moon, you okay? I'm okay! It's tea. You drink it. I promise, this is going to be the most wonderful... I mean, fantastic show ever. Did you put honey in this? A-And the ending? Oh, boy. I mean, i-it's gonna end with you and your song... You don't want to do the show. Besides, lost my singing voice, so... Your voice sounds fine to me. This... This is all because you lost your wife, isn't it? Okay, porcupine. We're not talking about my Ruby. Look, I know she inspired so many of your songs... All of my songs. Right. I... I can't imagine what it must be like to lose someone so special, but do you think this is what Ruby would've wanted for you? I mean, you out here on your own and never singing again? No, y-you don't understand. There's... there's no rock star living here anymore. Clay, you just need to play again. Your songs will bring you back. You can. You can reconnect with... No, I can't! I haven't even heard one of my songs in over 15 years. And for good reason. Ruby was everything. And I don't like honey in my tea. He's not gonna change his mind. He will. But you should go back. Me? What about you? I just need time with him. I can't just leave him like this. Ten-hut! - Whoa. - Welcome back, Mr. Moon, sir. Uh, thank you, Miss Crawly. Oh, and I have something for you. Thank you, Mr. Moon, sir. All right, you can ease off the attitude now. Oh, oh, yes, yes. So, any luck with Clay Calloway? Shh! Not yet. But if anyone can convince him, it's Ash, so... All right, folks, tomorrow, we have our first run-through, so let's get this show in shipshape shape. And cue Porsha. Captain's log. I must take care, for I have landed on the Planet of War. Ooh. Okay, so let's just hold it right there, folks. Uh, everyone, take five. What the heck is a captain's log, anyway? Um, Porsha, can I have a word? Porsha, you know I truly believe that this show, i-it... it's close to being fantastic, maybe even perfect. - Thank you. - Y-Yeah, yeah, but-but, see, to make it the best it can be... ...well, I got to make some changes. Uh-huh. Like... uh... I have to give the lead role back to Rosita. What? I'm just offering you the opportunity - to switch roles with... - You're firing me? No, I-I'm not firing you. Oh, wait till my dad hears that you fired me. But I'm not firing you. Please, wait! Oh, my gosh. You all hate me, don't you? No, no, no, we don't hate you. We all think you're terrific! Well, I don't care if you hate me. Please stop. You and your stupid, stupid sky-fi show can go to heck! Porsha, stop. Wait! Oh, I am one dead koala.  I'm not afraid   Of anything in this world  There's nothing you can throw at me   That I haven't already heard   I'm just trying to find   A decent melody   A song that I can sing   In my own company  I never thought you were a fool  But, darling, look at you, ooh   You gotta stand up straight   And carry your own weight  These tears are going nowhere, babe  You've got to get yourself together   You've got stuck in a moment   Now you can't get out of it   Oh, love, look at you now  You got yourself stuck in a moment   And you can't get out of it.   Hot News.  And the hottest story today: Porsha Crystal was reportedly fired from her father's show. He fired my daughter? My daughter? Would you be quiet? You've embarrassed me enough. But, Daddy... Now the whole world thinks I got a talentless loser for a daughter. Take her home. Bring me Moon.  He will not always say   What you would have him say   But now and then, he'll say   Something wonderful...  Ash? Now is not a good... Moon, I've got him! - What? - I got Calloway! Here, he wants to talk to you. Your friend is even more annoying than you are. Don't listen to him. We're heading to Redshore right now. - You are? - Yes. Oh, my gosh. Okay, this is great news, seriously. You may have just saved my life here. Okay. Here we go. Mr. Moon, what have you done? Mr. Crystal. Aah! I got some great news. Clay Calloway is on his way here right now. Everybody, out. Okay, I think I know what this might be about, and I... You fired Porsha. No. No. I never fired her. You calling her a liar? No, no, no, no, she just got it wrong, is all. I was only trying to help her do the best she could, and be-believe me, I-I-I just wanted to do the right thing. The right thing to do... - ...is what I tell you to do! - But I did! I-I-I delivered a great show. And Ca-Calloway, he's coming. No, no, no! Stop! Stop! No! You really think I'd let a lowlife little amateur loser like you humiliate me? Please! Please! - You made me look bad. - No, no! I didn't mean to! No! So I'm gonna have to let you go. What? Whoa! Sir. Uh, sir, sir, sir. I'm-I'm so sorry, um, so sorry to bother you, but, uh, you have a live TV appearance in just a moment, so it-it might be better if we just put a pin in this right now. Um... You-you nearly killed me. And I'll finish the job later. No. No! No! Help! Help! Jerry! Anyone! No. Help, please! Shh! You need to get out of this city and never, ever come back. Do you understand? Never. Okay, okay. I understand. I told you you were not cut out for this. He tried to kill me. Yeah, and when he finds you're gone, he'll have his thugs looking all over for you. Okay. Thank you, Suki. I'm so, so... Get out of here. Uh, what did you say, Mr. Moon? Get out! All of you! Get out of there right now! There's no time to explain. Just get the cast and meet me back at the hotel! And we're live in five, four, three, two...  Hot News  -  Hot News...  - Jerry, go get my snacks. Yes, sir. What a great show we have... Here to discuss the drama - surrounding his new show... - Sir! Uh, sir, sir, sir. - Mr. Redshore City himself... - What? ...please welcome Mr. Jimmy Crystal. Come on out here, Jimmy. - Don't make us beg. - Moon got out. - Find him. - Does this guy know how to make an entrance or what? Hey, everybody! Good to see you. Linda, I got some hot news for you. You look terrific. It is so good to see you. Well, thank you. Thank you for having me. Oh, my gosh. Billionaire Magazine Man of the Year three years in a row, owner of the largest... theater chain in the world... Buster? Ash? Ash, in here! Buster? I-I'm stuck! You got to be kidding me. Hold still. What are you doing in there? Ash, the show's off. Crystal got mad - and tried to kill me. - What? I thought you were his thugs coming here to finish me off. Oh, no. It's them. Shh. Pretend we're not here. The first time I leave home in 15 years, and what do I find? The show is off, and this guy is hiding in a suitcase. No, no, don't... don't open the door. No, no, no. Clay Calloway. I remember you. Miss Crawly. - Pew, pew. Pew. - Miss Crawly, wake up. Wha... Mm, what? Wake up. We got to get out of here. Coast is clear. Let's go. Come on, Miss Crawly. Come on. Come on. Come on. We'll all feel better when we're safe at home. You sure about that? 'Cause I can tell you, running and hiding away is not all that it's cracked up to be. Well, we don't have a choice. Yeah, well, all these years, I thought the same, but turns out there's always a choice. Just never had the guts to make the right one. Know what I mean? Right? A victim. I shut down my show 'cause of a talentless little twerp called Buster Moon. Seriously, you should've seen this teeny, tiny loser. Oh, and his pathetic amateur friends... let's just say, whatever Podunk town they crawled out of, that's where they belong, 'cause it sure ain't this great city. No. I see, Clay's right. What we're trying to do here, it takes guts. Guys, wait. We-we cannot let that-that-that-that... that bully steal our hopes and dreams. No, no, no. We are way past singing and dancing now. Look, I-I know this might sound crazy. - If we got the theater back... - Oh, come on. - Just for one night only. - Seriously? It's not like we can just sneak in there and put the show on behind Crystal's back. That is exactly what we're gonna do. Yes! Maybe it's, like, room service? Open up or you're dead, Moon! Okay, it's not room service. You and your dumb friends better not be hiding in there. What are we gonna do? Guys, we just got to be brave now. Are you saying we should fight these thugs? No, no. They'll beat us to a pulp. We're gonna put this show on whether Crystal likes it or not. But first, we're gonna jump out that window. What? I'm beginning to like this guy. Security. Yeah, we got nine suspects loose on the river ride. Repeat, nine suspects loose on the river ride. Hang on, everybody. Uh, this is pool security. I don't see anyone here. Over. There! They're heading east through the back lot! Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, I wish I didn't have... such teeny, tiny legs! -  Soy yo  -  Soy, soy, soy  -  Soy, soy, soy, soy  -  Soy yo   Yo, yo, yo, yo...  Thank you, Linda. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. Well? Uh, no sign of 'em, sir. We think they might have split town. No one is supposed to be in here. Uh, who are you? We're the night cleaners. Oh, I see. Well, we don't need any cleaning right now, but it'd be better if you didn't leave, so... Mm, I don't suppose any of you can tap-dance, huh? Huh. Well, let's move it, folks. Here, Rosita. It's your role. Miss Crawly, let's see if we can get us a new green alien. Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir. Rise and shine, sweetheart!  Soy yo...  Hey! You made it! Yeah, well, uh, maybe I overreacted a little before. A little? You were, like, a total drama queen back there. Yeah, okay, we're all good now. Wow, my dad's gonna flip when he finds out about us. - Well, we're safe for now, but listen, let's... - Safe? Uh, no. None of us are safe. Mr. Moon, I know someone who can protect us. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Protection? Say no more, son. We're on our way.  Soy yo   Soy yo   Soy yo   Soy yo   Soy yo   Soy, soy, soy   Soy, soy, soy, soy  -  Soy yo  -  Yo, yo, yo   Yo, yo, yo, yo  -  Soy yo  -  Soy, soy, soy, soy  Good night, Porsha.  Soy yo.  All right, be that way. I don't care. Spoiled little brat. All right, time to get us an audience. Wait. Moon, as soon as you start inviting folks in here, hotel security will just shut us down, right? Oh, it's okay. Rosita's got that covered. Norman, release the piglets.  No, not today...  Hey, no! All security, we have a situation on floor 17. Repeat, all security to floor 17. This is the best day of my life, Daddy! Whoo! Repeat, everybody to floor 17! Wait, uh, is it on? - Yes, it's on now. - Oh, now? - Yes, now. - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Before I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Good evening.

Woo-hoo! I love you! Yeah! Oh, Mr. Moon, are you okay? Yeah. Never better. Uh, where's Ash and Clay? Clay. Clay, you back here? We're on next. You okay? Uh-huh. Mission report. We have survived the wormhole. - Yeah! - Yeah. And arrived on the last planet. The missing space explorer must be here somewhere, but there's no sign of life on my scanner. That's your cue. Clay, it's time to go on. But I see no signs of life. Nothing but an empty cave. - Clay. - Oh, no. It's okay. Just sing. - Your songs will carry you. - No. - This is a mistake. - Please. It's been so long. I'm not ready. I'm sorry. I'm not ready.  I have climbed   The highest mountains   I have run   Through the fields   Only to be with you   Only to be with you   But I still haven't found   What I'm looking for   But I still haven't found   What I'm looking for   But I still haven't found   What I'm looking for   I believe   In the kingdom come   Then all the colors   Will bleed into one   Bleed into one   But yes, I'm still running   You broke the bonds   And you loosed the chains   Carried the cross   Of my shame, of my shame   You know I believe it   But I still haven't found   What I'm looking for   But I still haven't found   What I'm looking for   I still haven't found   What I'm looking for   I still haven't found   What I'm looking for   But I still haven't found   What I'm looking for   But I still haven't found  Mission accomplished. We're heading home.  What I'm looking for.  - Hey, Mr. Moon! - Come on! - Get out here, Moon. - Come on out here! Jimmy! Oh, my gosh, listen to that crowd. You are a genius. Yeah, you really are a genius, sir. Yeah, you got that right, Linda. Thank you, thank you. Too kind. I appreciate it, really. I-I do. Look, I am very proud of this show. We did great work here. Great work. And my good friend, Clay... great to have him back, right? Yeah! And listen, I look forward to seeing this show run at my theater for many, many years to come. Right, Moon? Moon? Officers, arrest that wolf. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! He's innocent! Mr. Crystal, please! I love you!  Was a Monday morning   'Bout a quarter past 4:00   You were busy dreaming   So what did you wake up for?  Are you a stranger in your own life?  What are you hiding behind those eyes?  Is no one looking for you there?  You know your song saved my life  I don't sing it just so I can get by   Won't you hear me   When I tell you, darlin'   I sing it to survive  Stop the bus! Whoa! - What is it? - What happened? - What's going on? - Ow! I just got a call from The Majestic. They think your show is fantastic, and they want to put it on at their theater. Well, what do you say, Mr. Calloway? You in?  Your song saved my life   The worst and the best days   Of my life   I was broken, now I'm open   Your love keeps me alive   It keeps me alive   Your song saved my life   The worst and the best days   Of my life   Your song saved my life  Song saved my, song saved my.  Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull There's nothing holdin' me back  There's nothing holdin' me back   Oh, I've been shaking   I love it when you go crazy   You take all my inhibitions  Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  You take me places that tear up my reputation   Manipulate my decisions  Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  There's nothing holdin' me back  'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far   I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right  If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark   I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right  'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far   I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right  If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark  I know we'd be all right, we would be all right   Oh, I've been shaking   I love it when you go crazy   You take all my inhibitions  Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back  You take me places that tear up my reputation   Manipulate my decisions   Baby, there's nothing   Holdin' me back   Baby, there's nothing   Holdin' me back   Oh, whoa  There's nothing holdin' me back   I feel so free   When you're with me, baby   Baby, there's nothing   Holdin' me back.  Oh!, Kenichi... Hideki... Minoru... Masao... Susumu... Yuta... Yaichi... Toyoaki... Isao... Ryosuke... Yukio... Takahiro... Master, we should go. It's not good for your health. I wonder how long I'll be able to make the trip here. I'd like to settle the score for these children who died while I'm in charge. I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month. My children in the Demon Slayer Corps... are on the front lines even as we speak, fighting the demons. No matter how many lives the demons take... the one thing they can never crush is a human's will. No matter how battered we are, we will always rise up again to fight. For now, let's hide our swords on our backs. Oh no! The train's leaving! Are the police still around? We'll have to go even if they are. I'm taking you on! Lord of this land! Hey, idiot! We should go, too! Hey, don't leave me behind! W-Wait up! Tanjiro! Inosuke! Zenitsu! So fast! Sorry! We're very sorry! Forget that! Get over here, idiot! So freakin' fast! Ma'am, is that all right? Thank you. Sorry to trouble you. Oh no. It's the least I can do. He's a Hashira, right? This Rengoku person... Are you sure you'll recognize his face? Sure. He had this gaudy hairstyle, and I remember his scent, too. Hey! I think I'll know it's him once we get close. Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Is that the Flame Hashira guy? - Delicious! - Yeah. Not just some random glutton? - Delicious! - Yeah. Delicious! Um, excuse me... Delicious! R-Rengoku? Delicious! Uh, we really get that part already. And you're the kid from that day at the Master's. Yes. I'm Tanjiro Kamado. And they are my fellow Demon Slayers, Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. I see. And inside that box there... Yes. It's my sister Nezuko. Right! That demon we saw that day, huh? Since the Master's acknowledged her, I won't say any word for now. Have a seat here. Being inside the lord is mind-blowing! You're going to break the glass! Calm down already, will ya? What are you three doing here? A mission? We received an order from a Kasugai Crow. ""The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing. Join Rengoku on site,"" he said. Yes! I see now! Understood! Right. Also, there's one more thing. Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku. What is it? Let's hear it. About my father... What about your father? Well, he was really frail. Was he really? But even if it was cold enough to freeze your lungs, he could still perform a kagura dance in the snow. Well, I'm glad to hear it! The thing is... What's up? Hinokami Kagura... Dance! I suddenly found myself doing the kagura that I'd seen as a child. If you know anything about that, Rengoku... I was hoping you'd tell me. Right! But I know nothing! I've never even heard the term ""Hinokami Dance"" before. But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle. All right, end of discussion! Um, can you try to help me a little more? You should become my Tsuguko, my apprentice! I'll look after you! Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at? He's totally weird, all right. Flame Breathing has a long history. In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira. Flame. Water. Wind. Stone. Thunder. Those are the fundamental breathing techniques. The other techniques were created as offshoots of those five. Mist is a fork of Wind. Young Mizoguchi! What color is your sword? My name's Kamado. And the color is black. A black sword, huh? Well, isn't that unfortunate? For real? I've never known a swordsman with a black sword that became a Hashira. On top of that, I hear that they have no clue which style to master. Come to me, and I'll train you! You can rest easy now! No, thank you! And just what are you looking at? He's strange, but he seems to be very caring. And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice. Awesome! Awesome! So fast! That's dangerous, you idiot! I'm gonna run outside and race to see who's faster! - You can't possibly be that stupid, can you? - That's dangerous. You never know when a demon might appear. You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train? Sure do! What? They do? Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here? Nooo! I'm getting off! Over 40 people have disappeared on this train. The Corps sent a few swordsmen, but then they all went silent. That's why I, a Hashira, am here. Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off! May I... see your... tickets, please? What's he doing? The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it. Here. What is this? There's a horrible scent. Thank you... very much. Mr. Conductor... You could get hurt, so please step back. As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword. Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body? I had a hard time detecting you. But if you bare your fangs at innocent people... my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone! Flame Breathing... First Form... Unknowing Fire! Amazing. He sliced off the demon's head with one blow. There's still one more. Come with me! All right! D-Don't leave me behind! You will not lay a finger on that man! Didn't you hear me? I said I'm your opponent. What the hell is it? It's got long arms! All right! - First come, first served! - Hold up! We gotta save the passenger first! It won't matter once I destroy that thing! You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on. We're good to go now. Let's finish him off in short order. Flame Breathing... Second Form... Rising Scorching Sun! Tha... Tha... That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man! Please make me your apprentice! Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you! - Me, too, please! - Me, three! I'll train all of you! Big Bro Rengoku! Bro! - Bro! - Bro! Big Bro Rengoku! I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep! Please! Put me to sleep, too, now! Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter! I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Sure thing. You did a good job. Go to sleep. Have a nice dream where you can meet your family. Excuse me. What do you want us to do? Their slumber will grow deeper in a little while. Wait here until then. Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons. When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies. I will have to stay in the first car for a while. Hang on until everything's ready to go... so that you can have blissful dreams. Okay. What's going on? What happened? Calm down. Calm down. You have to calm down. Hey! It's Big Bro! Welcome home, Big Bro! Did you sell the charcoal? Big Bro? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! To be able to die while dreaming... Just how lucky are you? It doesn't matter how powerful a Demon Slayer you are. A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit! All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core. You can kill them just like that! All human hearts are the same. So fragile and weak, like glasswork. Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist? That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about. Take a deep, slow breath... while you count. Do that, and you'll fall asleep. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears! What a weirdo! Oh my, you must be exhausted. It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine. You don't have a fever, do you? Take it easy and get some rest today, okay? I'm all right. Are you sure? Hey! You come back here! Gotcha! What do you think you're doing? Hey! You stop that right now! Seems like... I was having a bad dream or something. Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams... Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams... And even if a demon comes, deep in their dreams... Even in the stomach, deep in their dreams... Looks like fun. You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you? You are falling... You are falling... into a dream. It's a deep slumber. They can... no longer awaken. This way! The peaches over here taste great! And there are tons of white clovers in bloom! I'll make you a chaplet! I can make these really great-looking ones... Nezuko! Yes! Make a lot, okay... Zenitsu? There's a river along the way, but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right? River? What am I going to do, Zenitsu? I can't swim. I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river! Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko! Just leave it to me! Let's go! Expedition Team! Expedition Team! We're the Cave Expedition Team! Expedition Team! Expedition Team! We're the Cave Expedition Team! Expedition Team! Expedition Team! Boss! Boss! What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2? I can smell the master of this cave over there, pompoko! And I can hear it breathing as it sleeps, squeak! Here he is! All right, let's go! Showdown! - Roger that, Boss! - Roger that, Boss! Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3! Come over here! Look, I'll give you these sparkly acorns! C'mon! Let's go! - Hey! - Hey! Why did I come here? Oh, right. To report to my father... that I've become a Hashira. So what if you've become a Hashira? Worthless. It means nothing. You're never going to amount to anything anyway. Neither you... nor I. Brother... Was our father pleased to hear your news? Do you think our father will acknowledge me if I become a Hashira, too? He wasn't always like that. After all, he did rise to the rank of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps. He was a passionate man. And yet, one day, out of the blue, he quit being a swordsman. Suddenly. The man who'd raised us both with such enthusiasm... Why? It's pointless to think about such things, so stop. Senjuro is even worse off. He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young, and just look at the state our father is in. I'm going to be honest. Our father wasn't happy to hear it. He told me that it meant nothing. But that's not enough to extinguish my passion! This flame inside my heart will never go out! I'll never give in! And Senjuro... You're not like me. You have a big brother... who believes in his little brother. No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being! Keep that burning passion inside your heart! Let's do our best! Let's do our best and live on! No matter how lonely it gets. Looking good. Those ropes that I created are used... for a special technique that allows one to invade the dreams of whoever you're tethered to. I always fight with the utmost caution. Once you're asleep, Hashira or not, you're no different than a baby. I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers. There's no need to swing in such a hurry. Relax your shoulders. Like this? That's right. Close call. He's right there. I have to make sure he doesn't see me! I have to hurry to the edge of the dream! Hurry! The dream world I show them isn't infinite. It's circular, with the dreamer in its center. The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core. That's what you must destroy. Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled. There it is! The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further. I'll destroy his spiritual core right away! And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself! What an odd realm of the subconscious. It's hot. It's burning up. I have to hurry. Found it! The spiritual core! I've never seen a red one before. All I have to do is destroy this and... It'll be my turn to... I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell. What a strong survival instinct he has! I'm going to make your favorite rice crackers today, Tanjiro. Wow! I'll start breaking old rice cakes first. It's our lucky day, Rokuta! Rice crackers! No fair! Big Bro's not the only one who likes rice crackers! - I like them, too! - Me, too! Then, let's eat them together, okay? Can you get the grill ready for me? Okay! I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl! Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then! Me, too! Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them! No fair! There. Nezuko, let's go. What did I just say? I'm back! Welcome home, Tanjiro. Yeah, I'm home! Welcome home, Big Bro! Huh? Where's Nezuko? Big Sis went up the mountain to pick vegetables. In broad daylight? She's not supposed to? Well... Um... Tanjiro... Could you get the bath ready? I'm going to be busy with this for a while. I keep saying all these strange things. Am I tired maybe? Huh? It's gone. I wonder what that was for just a split second. A toolbox perhaps? I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! You're under attack! It's a dream! This is a dream! Wake up now! I see... That's right, I'm... on board the train! Wake up and fight! Fight! Fight! Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes! No, you don't! You stop it right now! Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro? What's your problem? You just had seconds! No good! I'm not awake yet! I'm still inside a dream! How can I get out of it? Now that I've realized that it's a dream... What am I supposed to do? I have to wake up... Big Bro! - What should we do? The fire is - Big Bro! That's Nezuko's scent! It's Nezuko's blood! Nezuko... Nezuko! My uniform... My Nichirin Sword... I'm waking up! Little by little. Little by little! Big Bro? Big Bro, are you all right? Big Bro? Sorry. I have to go. I have to hurry back! I'm sorry. Big Bro! - Big Bro! - Big Bro! If the demon who's showing me this dream is nearby... I have to find him and slash him right away! Where is he? I have to... Where are you going, Big Bro? I picked lots of vegetables today! Mom! This way! Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden! Mom? Tanjiro, are you all right? Big Bro... What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that? I wish I could stay here... forever. I wish I could turn around and go back. By rights, I should've been living like this forever. Right here. If none of this had happened... they'd all have been alive and well now. And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight, under the blue sky. If none of this had happened... If none of this had happened... I should be here making charcoal every day. I never would've laid a hand on a sword! If none of this had happened... If none of this had happened... But I've lost them now. I can never go back! Big Bro! Don't leave us behind! Sorry! I'm sorry, Rokuta! We can't be together anymore. But I'll always be thinking of you, okay? I'll be thinking of you all! There are lots of things to thank you for. Lots of things to be sorry for! But I will never forget you! No matter what, my heart will always be with you! So, please... forgive me! I have to destroy his spiritual core right away. So, this is the inside of his heart? How can it be so beautiful? It's so endlessly vast... and... also warm. Where the heck is his spiritual core? What's with this realm of the subconscious? And that creepy naked boar... Seriously, this is insane. What are you doing in the realm of the subconscious? You stupid naked boar! It's pitch-dark. It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit. What's with that blond brat's realm of subconscious? Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core? You must be kidding me. What was that? What the hell's a guy doing in here? Damn you, parasite! No one's allowed in here but Nezuko. I'm so going to kill you. Where's Nezuko? Wh-Who the heck knows? All right, then... Die! Nooo! They're having trouble, aren't they? I wonder why. They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet. Oh well... I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time. Not here. But I can smell a demon, even faintly. What's this, though? It's like there's a film over everything! There's a faint demon scent everywhere! I can't tell the exact location! I have to hurry! Nezuko's bleeding! If everyone else is asleep, we're in big trouble! What should I do? Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now? Am I just asleep right now? Tanjiro... Take up your sword. There's something you must cut. There's something... I must cut. There's something I must cut... in order to wake up. I think I know what it is. But what if I'm wrong? If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too... there'll be no going back. Don't hesitate! Do it! You have to do it! My death in this dream will lead me to reality! In other words... what I have to cut is... my own neck! I'm all right. I'm alive. Nezuko! Are you okay? Nezuko... Zenitsu... Inosuke... Rengoku... Who are these people? They're all connected by the wrists with ropes. Rope... What's this? It's burned off. Nezuko's burning blood did it? It's faint, but I'm picking up a demon's scent, too! This smell... The ticket! I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too. We were put to sleep when our tickets were punched. This must be a demon's work! Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art using just this faint scent? I don't know why... but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever this rope with my Nichirin Sword. Nezuko! Do me a favor! I want you to burn off everyone's rope! Zenitsu! Wake up! Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up! Wake up, Inosuke! Please! Inosuke... There, there... Sorry, okay? Thanks. You did a great job, Nezuko. It's no good. These two don't wake up. What can I do? Rengoku What are you doing? Is a demon controlling her? Get out of our way! Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams! Is she acting of her own free will? This man, too? What do you think you're doing? If you're awake, you'd better help us out! You may have tuberculosis or whatever, but if you don't do your job, I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me? Is he the one who was connected to me? Tuberculosis... He's sick. Poor man. What this demon did is unforgivable. He took advantage of their weak souls! Sorry. I have to go fight. You want to stay inside a happy dream, don't you? I know. I wanted to stay inside my dream, too. If only this was the dream... I was willing... to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness. But it was warm... inside your dream and inside your soul. You must be the incarnations of this boy's soul. The air is so clear, and it feels good. Is that his spiritual core? Why are you showing it to me? Did you bring me here because I was searching for it? No way! Even though I was trying to destroy it? Why would you... The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart. Are you all right? Thank you. Be careful. Right! Nezuko! The smell is overpowering! So heavy! The demon's scent is so strong even in this strong wind! Was I asleep in such an awful scent? Even if each car was closed off and airtight, I can't believe I was! I was useless! The demon's upwind... Is he in the first car? Nezuko, don't come! Stay away from me and wait! Go wake everyone up! What? You're awake? Good morning! You could've stayed asleep. It was him! Why did you wake up? Didn't I show you a sweet dream? I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered. Would you have liked that one better? No, of course not. Too distressing, right? All right, next... Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life? What I really love... is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream. I just adore the sight of a distorted human face. I get such a kick out of that! How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing? But I don't usually let my guard down. So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers. I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets. Once the conductor punches them, creating clamp marks... the spell activates. And yet... how did this one manage to wake up? And he found the way to wake up in a short time. Even though the human desire for blissful dreams, for self-serving dreams... is so enormous! Don't you dare intrude on my soul! I won't let you... get away with this! What's that? I see he's wearing earrings. How lucky is that? So, he came right to me! This is like a dream! Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan! And once I become more powerful, I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon to a duel to replace him! Water Breathing... Tenth Form... Constant Flux! Blood Demon Art! Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis. Go to sleep! He's not falling asleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Go... to... sleep! It's not working. But why not? No, that's not what this is. He's falling under this spell over and over! He's aware that he's under the spell right away. And he's committing suicide in order to awaken! Even if it's in the middle of a dream, to commit suicide... to take his own life with his own hands... that takes incredible willpower! This brat... is insane! Why didn't you save us? What were you doing while we were being murdered? How could you be the only one to survive? Why do you think you were here? You're so useless! It should've been you that died. How dare you go on living without a care. There's no way they'd ever say that! Not ever! Not my family! Don't you dare... insult... my family! It was way too easy. Could this be a dream, too? Or was this demon weaker than him? I can totally see why... he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings, along with the Hashira! Your very existence is, like... It couldn't be more irritating, you know! He's not dying? Oh, that look on your face is so delightful! That's the look I've been wanting to see! You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you? Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now. It's so easy even an infant would understand. It's because the body over there was no longer my main body. Same with this thing that's talking to you now. It merely looks like my head, but it's not. While you were snoozing away... I fused with this train! Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones! Look at your face. Are you getting it now? In other words... the more than 200 passengers on this train... are the food that will strengthen my body even more... as well as my hostages. So, do you think you can protect them by yourself? All these people packing this train from one end to another... Can you alone keep me from devouring them? What should I do? What should I do? The most I can protect on my own is two cars! Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety! Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke! This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please! Nezuko! Protect the sleeping passengers! Follow me, damn minions! All right! Explosive Awakening! Comin' through! Lord Inosuke's comin' through! Inosuke! It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore! We have to protect the sleeping passengers! This whole train's turned into a demon! Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon! I knew it! So, I was right on the money! That means I was a total stud as a leader! Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang... Crazy Cutting! I'll save every last one of you guys! Fall onto your knees... and worship me! Glorify me! Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through! I have to go save the passengers! If Inosuke can hold down the fort here, I should go on ahead! It's gone this far already? Water Breathing... First Form... Water Surface Slash! No good. This is never going to end! How am I supposed to fend it off? Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me. You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating. And then, after all your strength is depleted... I'm going to partake of those 200 passengers in a leisurely feast. Thunder Breathing... First Form... Thunderclap and Flash! Sixfold. I'll protect you... Nezuko! Protect... That sounded like thunder. From one of the cars in the back? What's going on? Is Zenitsu awake now? What about Rengoku? And Nezuko? I cannot do anything but protect the people here! This is bad! What should I do? We can't fight in coordination! Are the passengers in the back all right? Damn! It's so cramped! And so hard to swing my sword! To think that all of this happened while I was dozing... How could this be? I'm ashamed as a Hashira. If only I could crawl... under a rock! What happened? What was that? A demon attack? Young Kamado! Rengoku! I was pretty thorough with my slashing attacks on my way here, so it should take the demon a while to regenerate. But there's no time to lose! I'll keep it short! Okay! This train has eight cars in all. I'll protect the five in the rear. The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest. You and the boar head boy... will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars. Head? But this demon is No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head! I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight! I want you to show me how gutsy you are! Amazing! I can't even see him! Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move? He's so quick to read the situation and make decisions! Five cars, all by himself? This is no time to be dazzled, idiot! Do what you have to do! The demon's scent is getting stronger by the second! Hurry! Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke? Shut up, or I'll kill you! Up there, huh? That guy with the goggle eyes ordered me around! But somehow... Somehow... Somehow, he was awesome! I'm so pissed! Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front! You don't have to tell me! And by the way, I've found it! Already! With my all-out Seventh Form... I found this master's weak spot! You did? So, it's in the front, after all? That's right, up front! And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier! The scent got swept away because the wind is so strong, making it hard to detect, but if Inosuke says so, there's no doubt about it! So, it's around where the coal's loaded, right? That's right! Understood! Okay, let's go! Forward! This is it, huh? All right! Inosuke! Fishy, very fishy! Especially around here! Who the hell are you? G-Get out of here! The demon's head... The demon's... weak spot! Gross! Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo! That's way too many hands! Uh-oh! Water Breathing, Sixth Form... Whirlpool! Inosuke, are you all right? It's not like you came to my rescue, okay? Yeah, I know! It's here... It's right beneath! Directly below this place. The demon's scent is powerful! Inosuke! The demon's head is right below here! Don't boss me around! I'm the leader! Fine! Just watch. Beast Breathing, Second Fang... Slice! It's the bone. His neck bone! Water Breathing, Eighth Form... Waterfall Basin! It blocked it! The gash is closing up! It's regenerating so fast! Not only that, but it took everything I had just to expose the bone! I have to sever it! Inosuke! We're going to synchronize our breathing and attack together! One of us will slash the flesh while the other jumps in to sever the bone! Sounds good! Great idea! I can praise you for that! Thanks! Let's go! Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep. A Blood Demon Art! He got me! He's putting me to sleep! Inosuke! Slash your own neck in your dreams! Then, you'll wake up! It's all right! Even if I fall under it, I can break the spell! Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes! Or else you'll fall under the spell right away! Okay, I'm awake! Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes! I have to wake up with my eyes shut! With my eyes shut! No good! Wake up! Wake up! Hurry! Cut the neck! Cut it! Cut it! I have to wake up! Hurry! Wake up! This isn't a dream! It's reality! Don't fall for his trap! Don't die such lame deaths! I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head. I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye! You loser eyeballs! I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking! All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death! Inosuke! Don't you dare get in the way of my dream! Did you get stabbed? I'm okay. Just forget about that bastard! I can't do that! I won't let him die! If we don't chop this demon's head off soon, we won't be able to make it! I know! Let's get moving! Inosuke! Synchronize your breathing with mine! And let's chop off the demon's head! Let's attack together! No good! If I fall asleep now... Damn you! C'mon! Follow me! Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang... Slice 'n' Dice! Father, please protect me! I'm going to sever that bone... with this blow! Hinokami Kagura... Clear Blue Sky! Because of its screams and tremors, the train's turning over! Are you okay, Inosuke? H-Hey, is your belly okay? Y-Yeah! Inosuke, protect the passen I can't die. If I die, that'll make him a murderer! I can't die! I don't want to let anyone die! Are you okay, Santaro? Hang in there! I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh! Cool, huh? Is your belly okay? Your belly that got stabbed! I'm... all right. What about you? Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold! I won't be able to move for a while. Help the others, will you? Was anyone injured? What about the engineer near the head? It's okay if that bastard dies! It's not okay. He's the one who stabbed you in the belly, remember? He's got his leg stuck and can't move! His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore! Just leave him there, and he'll die! Then, he's already atoned for his sin. Help him, will you? Please. I'll go for you, then! Because I'm the boss! Because my minion asked me to! After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair! That's really not necessary. It's almost dawn. Get your breathing under control. We have to... save the injured... before it's too late. Nezuko... Zenitsu... Rengoku... I'm sure they're all safe! You have to believe! My body's disintegrating. I can't regenerate. Did I lose? Am I going to die? Me? Ridiculous. Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out! I couldn't devour a single human! My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke! And now, look what I've been reduced to! After all the time and trouble I've taken! It was him! It's all his fault! Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled! I was held at bay! Is this the power of a Hashira? And him... He was fast, too. Even though he never broke the spell completely! Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about? A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers? Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor? Dammit! Dammit! In the first place... it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell! That brat is to blame! I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow! That's right, and that boar, too! I could've at least killed that brat! But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary. He could sense my gaze! Am I going to lose? Am I going to die? Oh, what a nightmare! What a nightmare! It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers. In the Upper Ranks... the same demons have remained for the last few centuries. They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons. Do they have otherworldly powers? Even after receiving so much of his blood, I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks! I want to do it over! I want to do it over! What a miserable nightmare this is... I see you've mastered Total Concentration, Constant. Impressive! Rengoku... After all, Constant is the first step toward becoming a Hashira. Although, there might be 10,000 steps before you can become a Hashira. I'll do my best. You're bleeding from the abdomen. You have to concentrate harder and improve the precision of your breathing. Make your nerves reach every corner of your body. There's a blood vessel. A torn blood vessel. Concentrate harder! That's it. Stanch it. Stop the bleeding. Focus! Great! Looks like you stopped it. You'll be able to do all kinds of things when you master breathing. Not that you'll be able to do everything, but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure. Right. Everyone's safe! There are hordes of injured people, but no one's life is in danger. Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up. Thank you very much. Upper... Three? What's he doing here and now? Flame Breathing, Second Form... Rising Scorching Sun! That's a fine sword. He sure can regenerate fast. This heavy and overwhelming demon aura... So, this is an Upper Rank. I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first. He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me. What would you and I have to talk about? I'm meeting you now for the first time, but I already dislike you. Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too. The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl. Then, it looks like our senses of value are completely different. All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you. Why don't you become a demon, too? I will not. I can tell your strength at a glance. You're a Hashira, aren't you? Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt. It's close to the realm of the highest. I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku. I'm Akaza. Kyojuro... Let me tell you why you can't enter the realm of the highest. Because you're a human. Because you're going to grow old. Because you're going to die. Become a demon, Kyojuro. Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years. You can become stronger. Of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji! I have to help him fight! Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty of being an ephemeral creature like a human. The fact that we grow old and die is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble. ""Strength"" isn't a word used to describe just the body. This boy isn't weak! Don't insult him. I'll repeat it as many times as it takes. You and I have different senses of value. No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon! I see. Technique Development... Destructive Death... Compass Needle! If you refuse to become a demon, I'll kill you. I can't follow their movements! There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now. And no one ever took me up on my offer, either. Why do you think that is? As a fellow martial artist, I just don't get it. Not when only the chosen ones can become demons! Watching the hideous decline of someone blessed with extraordinary powers... It pains me! I can't bear it! Die, Kyojuro... while you're still young and strong. Destructive Death... Air Type! I see. Flame Breathing... Fourth Form... Blooming Flame Undulation! When he strikes the air with his fist, the attack will reach me here! He can move faster than the blink of an eye. If I allow him to fight from a distance like this, slicing his head off will be tricky. In that case... I'll just have to get up close! This superb reaction speed of yours... and these breathtaking sword skills will be lost, too... Kyojuro! Doesn't that make you sad? It happens to everyone! It's a fact of life for any human! Stay where you are! If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal! Stand back! That's an order! Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro! Come on, give me your best shot! Concentrate on me. Nice moves! Rengoku! Ol' Goggle-eyes! Turn into a demon, Kyojuro. Fight me forever and get stronger together with me. You have what it takes to do that! I'll pass! Let me repeat it. I don't like you! I will not become a demon! Flame Breathing... Third Form... Blazing Universe! Magnificent! That's sensational! Destructive Death... Air Type! There's no opening. I can't jump in. I can't keep up with the speed of their movements! Those two are in a different dimension! Getting between them would only mean death! I can feel it in my bones! I can't move... because I know that even if I jumped in to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him! Rengoku... You still don't get it? That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro? Flame Breathing, First Form... Unknowing Fire! It would be a shame to kill you now! You haven't reached your physical peak yet! Second Form... Rising Scorching Sun! In a year or two, you'll have polished your skills even more, and you'll have greater precision! Third Form... Blazing Universe! Fourth Form... Blooming Flame Undulation! Destructive Death... Fifth Form... Flame Tiger! Disorder! Kyojuro! Did he do it? Did he win? Don't tell me... No way! Let's fight more. Don't die on me, Kyojuro. Rengoku... Rengoku! Rengoku! Even if you fight to death, you can't win, Kyojuro. Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me have already healed completely. But what about you? A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs... All irreparable. If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye. Those would be mere scratches for a demon. You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon. I want to go help him! But there's no strength in my arms or legs. It's partly because of my injury, but this always happens after I use the Hinokami Kagura technique! Kyojuro, why... I... I will fulfill my duty! I will not allow anyone here to die! I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant! Flame Breathing... Esoteric Art! What a tremendous fighting spirit! Amazing aura despite all those injuries! That mental strength! That airtight stance! You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro! Let's fight each other for all eternity! Set your heart ablaze. Go beyond your limits! I'm the Flame Hashira... Kyojuro Rengoku! Ninth Form... Rengoku! Destructive Death... Annihilation Type! Rengoku! Rengoku! Rengoku! I see hi Ren... goku... You'll die! This will kill you, Kyojuro! Become a demon! Say that you'll become a demon! You are... strong and one of the chosen ones! Kyojuro... Yes, Mother? I want you to think hard... about what I'm about to ask you. Do you know why you were born stronger than others? I don't know! So that you can save weaker people. Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people. You must never use that God-given strength to hurt others or for personal gain. It is the duty of those born strong to help the weak. It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly. Make sure you never forget that. I won't! I don't have much more time to live. I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child. I will entrust everything to you. Mother... It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you! He stopped it? What unbelievable strength! I've pierced through his solar plexus with my right arm! Damn! It'll be daybreak soon! I have to kill him and get out of here! I can't... pull my arm out! I won't let you escape! No matter what Rengoku says... I have to... do it right now! I have to slice off the demon's head! Quickly! The sun's coming up! There'll be sunlight here! I have to get away! I have to get away! No way am I ever letting go! Not until I chop off your head! Out of my way! Move, Inosuke! Move your body for Rengoku's sake! Beast Breathing, Fang One... Pierce! I have to find refuge from the sunlight! That took too long! I have to get away from the sun! Don't run away! Don't run away, you coward! Don't run away! What the hell is that brat talking about? Doesn't he have a brain in his head? I'm not running away from you! I'm running away from the sun! And besides, the battle's already been decided! He'll run out of strength and die soon! The Demon Slayer Corps... is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage! That's right, us flesh and blood humans! Our wounds don't close up that easily! And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost! Don't run away, you bastard! You bastard! You coward! Rengoku is way more amazing than you! He's stronger! Rengoku didn't lose! He didn't let anybody die! He fought to the end! He protected them to the end! You're the one who lost! It's Rengoku who won! Stop yelling already. You'll reopen that stomach wound. You're badly injured, too, remember? If you die, young Kamado, it'll mean I'm the loser. Rengoku... Come over here. Let's talk a bit one last time. There's something that I remembered... while I was dreaming. You should go to my parents' home, the Rengoku residence. There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira. My father read them often, but since I never did, I don't know what's in them. There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned. R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more. Please stop the bleeding with a breathing technique! Isn't there a way to close up your wounds? No. I'll be dead soon. I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you? Tell my little brother Senjuro... to follow his heart... and to walk down the path that he feels is right. Tell my father... that I want him to take care of himself. One more thing. Young Kamado... I believe in your little sister. I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. I saw her bleeding as she protected the humans inside the train. Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans... is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps no matter what anyone else says. Go ahead and live with your head held high! No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness... set your heart ablaze. Grit your teeth and look straight ahead. Even if you stop and crouch down, the time won't wait for you... or snuggle you and grieve along with you. Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here. As a Hashira, of course I would shield my juniors. Any other Hashira would've done the same thing. We never let the young buds get nipped. Young Kamado... Young Boar Head... Yellow Boy... Keep learning and grow. And then, become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps. I believe in you. I believe in you all. Mother... Do you think I did it right? Did I carry out what I had to do... and my duties? You made me proud. When the train went off the rails, Rengoku had unleashed all these techniques. He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum. I guess he did. I can't believe he's gone. I mean, did an Upper Rank demon really show up? Yeah. Why would an Upper Rank come here? Was it that strong? I mean... Yeah. I'm so frustrated! As soon as I master one thing, I find another thick wall right in front of me... while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it. I just can't make it there yet! If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I... Can I... ever become like Rengoku? Stop whining already! Stop saying dumbass things like, ""Can I or can't I be like him?"" He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that! All living things just go back to the earth when they die! Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back! Don't cry even if you have regrets! No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel, you still have to go on living! But you're crying, too. There are tears flooding out from that headpiece. I'm not crying! Get over here! We're gonna train! Is that so... Rengoku... So, even Rengoku couldn't beat an Upper Rank demon? I don't believe it. Namu Amida Butsu. I'll exterminate those repulsive demons! I see. So, not one of the 200 passengers lost their lives? Kyojuro did a great job, then. What a remarkable child. I'm not sad. I don't have much longer to live, either. Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others... in the land of the dead. Rengoku... Rengoku... Rengoku! <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, We come to you now with revelations about last week's attack in London. An anonymous source provided this video. It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio, moments before his death. You may find this video disturbing. I managed to send the Elemental back, but I don't think I'm gonna make it off this bridge. Spider-Man attacked me. He has an army of drones, Stark technology. He's saying he's gonna be the new Iron Man. No one else. Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack? There will be significant casualties. Do it. Execute them all. This shocking video was released earlier today on the controversial news website TheDailyBugle.net. There you have it, folks. Conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio, an interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet and who will, no doubt, go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time. But that's not all, folks. Here's the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves. You might wanna sit down. Spider-Man's real... Spider-Man's real name is... Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker. What the f...? That's right, folks. Peter Parker. A 17-year-old high school delinquent... - She knows him. - Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend? ...is, in fact... Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend? ...the vile vigilante villain Spider-Man. - Yo, it's him. - Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Please don't touch her, sir. - You're just a kid? - You murdered Mysterio? - Um... - You helped him? - No, I didn't... Come on, kid, let me see your face. He hit me. Spider-Man hit me! - Come on. - He hit me. All this time, people looked up to this boy and called him a hero. I'll tell you what I call him, public enemy number one! I told you I never wanted to do this ever again! MJ, I'm so sorry, but I can't see anything with your hand in my... Sorry. Where are we gonna go? - I don't know. Your house? - No! No! My dad will kill you. What? You said your dad really liked me. Yeah, well, not anymore. Dude! Dude! Dude! Dude! I'm so sorry. Are you okay? No, not really. Uh... Yo, Peter! We should go. We should go. Come on. - You said you don't want to swing. - Swing me. Okay. We can take the subway. No. Look out! That was so much worse. Okay. It's okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on, come on. Okay, I'm so sorry. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I just feel so dumb. I didn't realize you were miserable. No, it was really fun, right? That's why they call it a fling. - And we flung. - It was fun. I could've been more fun. - I can be fun. - We'll hang out again. Like, when do you think? I should see what that is. - No, no, no. - It's what I do. - He's always coming and going. - Peter? Oh, no. - I don't know what to do. - Peter. Peter. - Oh, I... - I didn't see anything. This isn't what it looks like. - No, no, May. - Practice safe... Oh, hey. You must be MJ! - Yeah. Nice to meet you. - So nice to meet you. Wait, have you been crying? We broke up. - Hey, Spider-Man! - Oh. Oh, uh... Thank you. I didn't know you broke up. I thought you were in love, May. Can we talk about this in the kitchen? I should probably leave. I thought you guys were such a handsome couple. It's really about boundaries. - Let me answer the door. - Let's go here. - Is that the door? - Hey. Is it true? - I was gonna go, but... - Not now. I didn't know you were so awkward about sex, Peter. This has nothing to do with sex. If you wanna go over it again. I mean... What's that sound? - Hey, Spider-Man! - Oh, my God. I mean, I'm happy to rehash it if you want to. You take care of your side, I'll take care of mine. What is up with this phone? Will you get off your phones for five minutes? I just wanna talk to you about your relationship, okay? Peter? What? - Is that...? - Is that here? Um... - Yo, Peter Parker! - Yo, Peter! Maybe it's not such a big deal. Spider-Menace! Governments around the world launch investigations into the murderer known as Spider-Man, aka Peter Parker, aka the web-headed war criminal who, for years, has been terrorizing the decent citizens of New York. Well, now this city and the world see him for what he truly is. Murderer! Mysterio forever! New details from last week's devastating attack in London have emerged. For more, we go now to Joint Intelligence headquarters. Authorities just a short while ago confirmed that the deadly drones used in the London attack were designed by Stark Industries. Federal agents! Open up! Federal agents? You stay here. Department of Damage Control. We have a warrant for the arrest of Peter Parker. - You know the Fourth Amendment? - Sure. Unreasonable search and seizure? Get in here, guys. Let's go. I didn't kill Quentin Beck. The drones did, okay? - The drones that are yours. - No. Well, look. Nick Fury was there the entire time. Ask him. He can explain everything. Nick Fury has been off-planet for the last year. - What? - Peter! Hey. MJ! They have nothing to do with this, sir. Don't say anything without a lawyer. I want a lawyer. - Ms. Jones-Watson. - Jones. I don't go by Watson. Ms. Jones, why do you want a lawyer if...? If I have nothing to hide? Exactly. Unless... - I'm actually guilty of something? - Mm-hm. I'm very aware of your tactics and my rights. Just answer my questions. I've seen your file. You're a smart young woman with a bright future ahead of her. Why would you risk it all by getting involved with a vigilante like Peter Parker? So sorry to keep you waiting. - Can we get Ned a snack? - Absolutely. - He's been waiting. - I got you. Dude, I'm so sorry about that. I'm not supposed to say anything to you. Not even a thing. I just have one question. When MJ told you Peter was Spider-Man... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heh. - What's up? I-I knew way before MJ did. I was Spider-Man's ""guy in the chair."" I know about those. Dude, half my guys are guys in the chair. Exactly. You would know. I literally helped him find the Vulture. - I didn't know that. - I helped him hack a suit once and helped him get to space. So in Spider-Man's illegal vigilantism, you were his main accomplice. I would like to have my words stricken from the record. With all due respect, and I mean that very insincerely, unless you have some real specific charges to throw at us, legally, you can't hold us here. - You should definitely lawyer up. - Excuse me? Child endangerment's a nasty rap. A boy was entrusted to you, and as his legal guardian, essentially his mother, you not only allowed him to endanger himself, but you actually encouraged it. Who does that? I wanna see Peter right now. Stark Industries was caught in the web of the Spider-Man-Mysterio controversy today, when federal agents opened an investigation into missing Stark technology. Agents wanna know exactly what was taken... At least they used a good picture. What is happening? That's great. Thank you. Well, I have some good news, Peter. I don't believe any of the charges - against you are gonna stick. - Wait, seriously? - I knew it. - Nice. My God, Mr. Murdock, thank you. - Thank you, Matt. - That's amazing. - You're welcome. - Perfect. - However, Mr. Hogan. - Yes? The feds are investigating that missing technology. I understand your loyalty to Mr. Stark and his legacy, but if you were involved... - If I was? - I advise securing a lawyer. I need a lawyer because I'm...? I thought he was... You said there's no charge. I could say under advisement of counsel, I refuse to answer the question respectfully because the answer can incriminate me... It's in Goodfellas. What's the thing they say in Goodfellas? I know that's what you think. Calm down. Let's hear what he has to say. Matt? You're gonna need a really good lawyer. You may have dodged your legal troubles but things will get much worse. There is still the court of public opinion. Murderer! Mysterio forever! How did you just do that? I'm a really good lawyer. We're gonna need a safer place to live. Oh. Ah. How do we...? How do we...? Alarm system deactivated. It looks nice. And this is safe. Welcome to the spiritual oasis. You like Donkey Kong Jr.? Nicky from Jersey City, you're on the line. I'm not saying I don't want to honor the Avengers, but, you know, not doing it this way. Putting the Captain America shield on the Statue of Liberty? Nah, that will look ridiculous. Leave the Statue of Liberty alone. Oh, Happy. Did you send in your applications yet? I just finished my MIT one. - You? - Same. Can you imagine if we both got in? And Ned? Yeah, but we'd have to get scholarships so we could actually go. You got the scores and the grades. You think I'm being too pragmatic. No, no, no. Well... Kind of. It's okay. It's one of my favorite things about you. - Really? - Yeah. What are your other favorite things? I love your relentless optimism. I am a glass-half-full kind of gal. I really like how you're a people person. I love people. I love them so much. You like sports. I think the Mets are gonna - go all the way this year. - Really? What's that noise? Oh. It's Happy. Look. Gave his room to May so he's sleeping down here. I have a weird question. Um... Does any part of you feel relieved about all of this? Ever since I got bit by that spider... I've only had one week where my life has felt normal. Or kind of normal, I guess. And... that was when you found out. Because then everyone that was in my life that I wanted to know, knew. And it was perfect. But now everybody knows and... I am the most famous person in the entire world. And I'm still broke. I'm... excited to see you tomorrow. Yeah. Me too. Wrap it up. You both like each other. We get it. Hang up. There's no new ground being broken. I need my eight hours. Have you been listening this whole time? - Hi, Happy. - Not by choice. - MJ says hi. - Hello. We're covering the first day of senior year for Midtown High's most famous student, Peter Parker. Go get them, tiger. Or should I say ""spider""? The crowd has continued to grow here all morning long at the Midtown School of Science... The crowd seems evenly divided between supporters of Spider-Man and protestors. MJ! MJ! MJ! We love you! MJ, are you gonna have his spider-babies? Back up. Back up. Back up! MJ, you know he's a murderer, right? Peter. Do a TikTok with me. - Mysterio forever! - Do a flip! - Hey, let's see you and MJ kiss! - Back off. Who are you? Ned Leeds. Spider-Man's best friend. I'm Peter Parker's best friend. You come at my boy, you come at Flash Thompson. If you wanna read about our inspiring friendship, you can in my new book, Flashpoint. One spider, two hearts, a million crazy-ass memories. Check it out. - Go. - No, I gotta wait... No. Go. I'll see you inside, okay? Keep watching Midtown News all year as we bring you up close and personal coverage of Peter fighting his biggest battle yet, college admissions. Peter, we would love to welcome you back to Midtown High, where we shape heroes. Yeah, uh-huh. Or murderers. Stop it. It's an honor to serve you, sir. It's not. Mysterio was right. - Stop. That's all. - Mysterio was right. Some of the students put this together for you. - No, you did that. - I helped a little bit. I tried to stop you so many times but you powered through. - He did all of that. - Did a great job. I hope you have time to check it out. Feel free to walk or swing through the hallway. Or crawl on the ceiling to avoid everybody. - We all know you can do it. - I'm just gonna... I know what you did. Stop. You're embarrassing yourself. He's a conspiracy theorist. Can we just stay up here all day? - It is so crazy down there. - This one's good. ""Some suggest that Parker's powers include the male spider's ability to hypnotize females, which he used to seduce Jones-Watson - into his cult of personality."" - Oh, come on. Stop. Stop. Yes, my Spider-Lord. Finally some privacy. It is so crazy down there. So I was thinking... when we get into MIT, we should live together. - Yeah, for sure. - Yeah, I'd love that. - This is gonna be us. - Yes. Minus the Frisbee and the smiling. MIT's obviously the dream, but if we match up our backup schools, then either way, we'll be in Boston. New school, new town. I can Spider-Man there. - They have crime in Boston, right? - Yes. - Wicked crime. - It'll be like a fresh start. What's up? I don't know. I just feel like, if you don't... If you expect disappointment, then you can never really get disappointed. Come on. Be a fresh start. And we'll all be together. Yeah. No, you're right. Fresh start. Yeah. Fresh start. First one's here! It's okay. It's a backup school. Peter! No? Last one. MIT? Uh... Okay. Okay. - Phew. - Ready? Jones. I told you to take down the Halloween decorations. Actually, that was Sasha so... Enough attitude. Just do it. On it. Feel like I'm gonna puke. Don't, because he will just make me clean it. This is our only shot. It's here or nowhere. - Hey. Come on. - Okay. You guys ready? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, on three. One, two, three. No. You? ""In light of recent controversy, we are unable to consider your application at this time."" This is so not fair. I mean, this is so not fair. I didn't do anything wrong. You guys definitely didn't do anything wrong. Expect disappointment and you will never get disappointed.  No sleep till   Boston  You guys didn't get in? Yeah, because we're actually friends with Spider-Man. Uh, yeah. I better get going. There's a mixer for new admissions and... Sorry, guys. Jones, what are you doing? Get back to work. Yeah, I'm coming. Know what? I wouldn't change a thing I did. Me neither. Although I do need to show this letter to my parents. Um, hi. Hi? I'm, uh... The most famous person in the world. I know. Wong. Try not to slip. We don't have liability insurance. Is all this for a holiday party? No. One of the rotunda gateways connects to Siberia. A blizzard blasted through. Because someone forgot to cast a monthly maintenance spell to keep the seals tight. That's right, he did, because he forgot - I now have higher duties. - Higher duties? The Sorcerer Supreme has higher duties. Yes. Wait, I thought you were the Sorcerer Supreme. No, he got it on a technicality because I blipped for five years. - Oh, well, congratulations. - If I'd been here, then... You'd burn the place down. You two, no one said stop shoveling. So, Peter, to what do I owe the pleasure? Right. I'm really sorry to bother you, sir. Please. We saved half the universe together. Think we're beyond you calling me ""sir."" Okay, uh, Stephen. That feels weird, but I'll allow it. When... When Mysterio revealed my identity... my entire life got screwed up and I was wondering... I don't know if this would actually work, but I was wondering if... maybe you could go back in time and make it so he never did? Peter... we tampered with the stability of space-time to resurrect countless lives. You wanna do it again now because yours got messy? It's not about me. I mean, this is really hurting a lot of people. My Aunt May, Happy, my best friend, my girlfriend, their futures are ruined just because they know me, and they've done nothing wrong. I am so sorry... but even if I wanted to... I don't have the Time Stone anymore. That's right. I'm really sorry if I wasted your time. - No. You didn't. - Just forget about it. He will. He's very good at forgetting things. Wong, you've actually generated a good idea. What? The Runes of Kof-Kol. The Runes of Kof-Kol? It's just a standard spell of forgetting. Won't turn back time, but people will forget you were ever Spider-Man. - Seriously? - No, not seriously. That spell travels the dark borders between known and unknown reality. It's too dangerous. We've used it for a lot less. Do you remember the full moon party at Kamar-Taj? - No. - Exactly. Come on, Wong. Hasn't he been through enough? Just leave me out of this. Fine. Fine. So, what is this place? The Sanctum's built at the intersection of cosmic energy currents. We weren't the first to seek them out. Some of these walls are thousands of years old. And they shot an episode of The Equalizer here in the '80s. Well, I, um... really appreciate you doing this for me, sir. Don't mention it. And don't call me ""sir."" Right. Sorry. You ready? I'm ready. Nice knowing you, Spider-Man. Wait, excuse me? The entire world's about to forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. - Including me. - Everyone? Uh, can't some people still know? That's not how the spell works. And it's very difficult and dangerous to change it mid-casting. So my girlfriend's gonna forget everything? Is she even gonna be my girlfriend? Was she your girlfriend because you were Spider-Man? - I don't know. I really hope not. - All right, fine. Everyone in the world's gonna forget you're Spider-Man except your girlfriend. Thank you so much. Oh, my God, Ned. Ned. What is a Ned? He's my best friend so it's important to me that Ned knows. Okay, let's not change the parameters of this spell any more while I'm casting it. Okay, I'm done. I swear I'm done. I'm done. But my Aunt May should really know. Peter, stop tampering with the spell. When she found out, it was really messy. I don't think I could go through that again. - So my Aunt May? - Yes. Thank you. Happy? No, I'm annoyed. No, it's a nickname. Harold ""Happy"" Hogan. He used to work with Tony Stark, but then he was... Could you just stop talking? Basically everyone that knew I was Spider-Man before should still know! - Did it work? - No. You changed my spell six times. - Five times. - You changed my spell. You don't do that. I told you. And that is why. That spell was out of control. If I hadn't shut it down, something catastrophic could have happened. - Stephen, listen, I am so... - Call me ""sir."" Sorry, sir. After everything we've been through, somehow I always forget you're just a kid. Look, Parker, the problem is not Mysterio. It's you trying to live two different lives. And the longer you do that, the more dangerous it becomes. Believe me. I'm so sorry about you and your friends not getting into college, but if they rejected you and you tried to convince them to reconsider, there's nothing else you can do. When you say, ""Convince them,"" - you mean I could have called them? - Yeah. I could do that? You haven't called the...? I got their letter. I assumed that was... I'm sorry. Are you telling me that you didn't even think to plead your case with them first before you asked me to brainwash the entire world? Well, I mean, when you put it like that... Come on, pick up, pick up. Dude, what? I'm busy. - Flash, where's the MIT mixer? - Why? Because I need to talk to someone. I'm trying to get Ned and MJ a second chance at getting in. What's in it for me? I'm risking a lot just talking to you. Okay, I will, um... pick you up and swing you to school for one week? For a month. - For a week. - Two weeks. - Flash, please. Help me. - You know what I want. Okay, I'll tell everyone you're my best friend. - Flash, please help me. - Cool, cool, cool. There's the assistant vice chancellor. You can plead your case with her. - Perfect. Where is she? - She left. - To go where? - To the airport. Stark network unavailable. Facial recognition unavailable. Hi. Yeah, I can see you. Oh, my God. - That's Peter Parker. - Mom. - Mom, look. - Mommy. No, it's Peter Parker. Hey. Okay. Whew. - Yeah. - Hi. I'm Peter Parker. You do know you're in the street, right? Yeah, I'm sorry. I really needed to talk to you and I know you're on your way to the airport. MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the two smartest people I've met, and I'm the dumbest person because I let them help me, but if I didn't, millions would've died, so please don't let MIT be dumb like me. MIT is dumb? No, I'm saying don't let MIT be dumb. I mean, like the dumber version of me that wouldn't have let them help. You didn't rehearse that, did you, Peter? Basically, what I'm trying to... Why are you running? Oh, my God. Ma'am, you should get out of the car. Everybody get off the bridge! The door's locked. Door's... Hey! Hello, Peter. Hi? Do we...? Do I know you? What have you done with my machine? I don't know what you're talking about. What machine? The power of the sun in the palm of my hand. It's gone. Listen, sir, if you stop smashing cars, we can work together and I can help you find your machine. You want to play games? Catch. It's okay. You guys are good. You're safe. Get out. You think your fancy new suit's gonna save you? Should've killed your little girlfriend when I had the chance. What did you just say? Looks like we got competition. Peter! Help! Don't worry, ma'am! I'm coming! Peter! Ma'am, just stay calm. Just take a deep breath. - Are you okay? - No! I promise, I've got this all under control. Suit compromised. Nanotechnology. Ah, you've outdone yourself, Peter. I underestimated you. But now you die. You're not Peter Parker. I am so confused right now. What's happening? New device detected. Pairing new device. You don't listen to him. You listen to me. Hey. Whoa. Hey. Hey! Listen to me. No, not him. Me. Ma'am, you okay? Come on, you can still make your flight. Peter. You're a hero. No. Well, I'm... No, I'm... I'm gonna talk to Admissions about your friends. And I'm gonna talk to them about you. But, ma'am, this isn't about me. I am going to talk to them about your friends and you. - Okay? - Really? And if you keep your noses clean, maybe you'll have a fair shot. Here. Get out of the way. Let me get that man. Hey! You! I see you. Come here! That was not okay. Unbelievable. Who are...? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Until you stop trying to kill me, I'm in control, buddy, of this whole tentacle situation you got going on here, okay? Now, who are you? What is going...? No. Osborn? Doctor...? Be careful what you wish for, Parker. Let me out of here! Can you please explain to me what is going on? That little spell that you botched where you wanted everyone to forget that Peter Parker's Spider-Man, it started pulling in everyone who knows Peter Parker's Spider-Man from every universe into this one. - From every universe? - Who are you? And where am I? I think it's better we don't engage with them because, frankly, the multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little. The multiverse is real? This shouldn't even be possible. - I thought you stopped the spell. - No, I contained it. It would appear a few of them squeaked through. After you left, I detected an otherworldly presence. I pursued it into the sewers, where I found that... slimy green son of a gun. Spell? As in magic? What is this, a birthday party? Who is this clown? What is this madness? Watch this. Do you know a Peter Parker - who's Spider-Man? - Yes. - Is that him? - No. See? Okay, here's what we gotta do. I don't know how many visitors we've got... I saw another one on the bridge. He was like a flying green elf. He sounds jolly. Start with him. I need you to capture them, bring them here while I figure out how to get them back before they destroy the fabric of reality, or worse, Wong finds out. Uh, Doctor Strange? What? My friends and I just got a second chance to get into MIT, and if the school sees me fighting these crazy monsters... - Hey, watch your mouth. - I'm sorry but... Are you seriously still talking about college? - Hey, what did you just do? - This. Hey, you can't just... How did you do that? Lots of birthday parties. Hey. Whoa. One shot, send them here, move on. You're welcome. Get to work. Sir? Now what? I know this is my mess, and I swear to you I'll fix it, but I'm gonna need help. Whoa! I can't believe I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum. Neither can I. So how did you know you were a man of magic? Because my nana says that we have it in our family, and I get these tinglings in my hands... Talk to your physician. - Peter. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. - Hey. Hey. Sorry for dragging you into this. - Help me find these guys. - You don't have to apologize. You got us a second shot at MIT. It's fine. So how did the bad guys get here? We screwed up a spell trying to get you into college. - Wait. What? - You did it with magic? I thought it was the MIT lady you saved. No, that was after. Let's just focus on the good news, okay? No, let's just focus on the bad news. As of now, you have detected zero multiversal trespassers, so get on your phones, scour the Internet, and... Scooby-Doo this shit. You're telling us what to do even though it was your spell that got screwed up, meaning that all this is kind of your mess. I know a couple of magic words myself, starting with the word ""please."" Please Scooby-Doo this shit. You can work in the undercroft. The undercroft? Badass. - About this whole spell thing... - It's totally okay. - Wait, really? - Yeah. I mean, I get it. You were just trying to fix things, and so... Maybe just run it by us next time, you know? That way, when you're thinking, ""I'm about to do something that could break the universe,"" we could, like, help you workshop something or... brainstorm ideas. Deal. Ned? Oh, dude, I don't care. It's seriously not a big deal. Um, oh! A torture rack. That is a Pilates machine. - That is... - The crypt. Okay, so we get the rest of the guys, you zap them, Doctor Magic will send them back, and when we get into MIT, round of stale doughnuts, my treat. Let's catch some multiverse men. Hey! Who the hell are these two? - My friends. This is MJ. - Hey. - And this is Ned. - Hello. Uh, I'm sorry, what was your name again? Dr. Otto Octavius. Wait, no, seriously, what's your actual name? Oh, is that a dinosaur? If the paint won't come off, I'll get it out. No, no, no. May. We gotta find these guys first. Well, finish your mission, and then come by. We're having a canned food drive. - That could work. - I got one. - May, I gotta go. - Okay. I mean, you can take the guy out of the chair, but you can't take the chair out of the guy. - What'd you find? - There's a... A disturbance near a military research facility outside of the city, and witnesses say that they saw a monster flying through the air. It's gotta be the guy I saw on the bridge, right? That's impossible. You know him, don't you? On the bridge, you said his name. Norman Osborn. Brilliant scientist. Military research. But he was greedy, misguided. - What happened to him? - We tire of your questions, boy! Okay, um... I gotta go. Where am I going? It can't be him. Why? Because Norman Osborn died years ago. So either we saw someone else... or you're flying out into the darkness to fight a ghost. Keep an eye out on the trees. We don't know where this guy is. I genuinely don't know how you do this without throwing up. Did you guys see that? Um, no. It's-It's really dark. Okay, okay, okay, okay. What-What's happening? Peter, what is it? Are you getting the tingle thing? Is the tingle happening? Is your tingle tingling? - Are you guys seeing this? - Yeah. Osborn? No. He was green. This guy's blue. You wouldn't happen to be from another universe, would you? What's he doing? I don't know. Looks like he's charging. I don't like this. Just web him. Whoa! Go left! Left, dude, left! Left! Go! Left! Yes! What are you talking about? Right. Go to the right! Right! Right! He means right. - Don't listen to him. - Guys, this is not helping! Oh, no, no, no. What happened? Peter? Peter. Whoa. Peter, it's me, Flint Marko. You remember? I'm Peter, but I'm not your Peter. What do you mean, you're not my Peter? What the hell is going on? I'll explain, but first, can you help me? - Okay. - You try to surround him, and I'll pull the plug. All right, let's go! I can't hold him much longer. I got it, I got it! Different Peter. Weird. - Thanks. Sorry. - Don't worry about it. I got my body back. Hey, um... This is gonna sound really crazy, but this isn't your universe. Another universe? - Uh-huh. - What? That's what I was feeling. The power, it's different. I like it. Easy, buddy. It's actually my fault that you're here. Like, the universe or the woods? I hate the woods. I meant the universe, sir. So, what, y'all just gonna stand here and act like I ain't butt-ass naked? - I am. - No, no. I, uh... What was that? What did you just do to him? - No. It's okay. - Did you kill him? I can explain everything. Trust me. Please just trust me. I don't trust you. I don't know you. What is this? You picked the wrong side. Connors? Wait. You know this creature? No, no, no. Not a creature. A man. The same universes. Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist at Oscorp when I worked there. A brilliant scientist. Until he turned himself into a lizard. Then he tried to turn the whole city into lizards. - It was crazy. - It wasn't crazy, Max. It was the next step in human evolution. - The dinosaur can talk. Right. - Lizard. Speaking of which what happened to you? Last I recall, you had bad teeth, glasses and a comb-over. Did you get a makeover? You know I can give you a real makeover. Let me guess, into a lizard? - Exactly. - Would you two just shut up? - Where are we? - It's complicated. - A wizard's dungeon. - Wizard's dungeon? There's no real way to sugarcoat that. It's literally the dungeon of a wizard. You can keep your magic. I want a taste of that new energy I just felt. - Oh, Peter, hey. - Did those guys come through yet? There should be an electric guy and a sand guy. Yeah, they're all here and locked up. Perfect. I'm gonna just stay here for a bit and try and fix some of this damage so they don't blame it on me again. - Okay. - But, hey, I, uh... I couldn't do any of this without you, so thank you. Yeah, of course. Hey, ask him if this is, like, a tree monster or, like, a scientist that turned into a tree. It's just a tree, man. Just a tree. Coward. We have a new world to conquer. You make me sick. Leave me alone, please. Hiding in the shadows. Hiding from who you truly are. - No. - You can't escape yourself. - Hey, May. - Hey, Peter. I'm at work, and... one of the guys you're looking for just walked in. May? Where's May? Thank you. May. Ah, hey, here he is. Norman, this is my nephew. Norman Osborn? I thought that you were... I saw Spider-Man in an ad for this place. And I thought he could help me. But you're not him. Wait, so you want Spider-Man's help? He just wandered in. I didn't know where else to go. Someone's living in my house. Oscorp doesn't exist. My son... Sometimes I'm not myself. I'm someone else. - Mm-hm. - And every time he's in control, - I can't remember. - Who? Who's in control? - And now I'm here... - Who's in control? - I don't know what's going on. - Okay, it's okay. And I don't... Doesn't make sense. He's lost. And I don't mean just in the cosmos. I mean in his mind. Are they all like this? - Yeah. - Yeah? They all have their own mental or physical issues. Oh, well, he needs help and maybe they all do. Wait, you don't mean...? No, May, this isn't my problem. Peter, not your problem? Hmm? May. Their chance of getting help is way better back where they came from. Sending them home, that's the best thing we can do for them. For them? Or for yourself? Look around you. This is what we do. - We help people. - This is what's best for them. Trust me. But the fact remains, Spider-Man is a menace. We'll be right back after a brief word from Daily Bugle Supplements. The only other daily fix you need. And we're out. What? I got eyes on him. He's with his aunt and some guy. - You sure? - They're leaving the shelter. Okay. Don't lose him. Thanks, May. Hope to see you again. Hey. He trusts you. So do I. Thanks for cleaning my suit. I'll see you later. - Um, guys, this is Mr. Osborn. - Hey, it's ""doctor."" Sorry. Um, Dr. Osborn, these are my friends. This is Ned and MJ. - Mary Jane? - It's Michelle Jones, actually. Fascinating. Do you think there are other Ned Leedses? Octavius? Osborn? - What... What happened to you? - What happened to...? - You're the walking corpse. - What do you mean? You died, Norman. Years ago. You're insane. - God, I love it here. - What are you talking about? He's standing right there. He's not... Dead. They both died, fighting Spider-Man. It was all over the news. Green Goblin, impaled by the glider you flew around on. And a couple of years later, you, Doc Ock, drowned in the river with your machine. That's nonsense. Spider-Man was trying to stop my fusion reactor, so I stopped him. I had him by the throat, and then I... - And then I was here. - Ah, please. Let me tell you something. I was whupping Spider-Man's ass. He'll tell you. And then he caused an overload. I was stuck in the grid, absorbing data. I was about to turn into pure energy, and then... And then, uh... And then... Oh, shit. - I was about to die. - Max, do you know? Do I die? Oh, great. You caught another one. No, wait, Strange. He's not dangerous. It's okay. Um... What is that? It's an ancient relic. The Macchina di Kadavus. I trapped your corrupted spell inside, and once I finish the proper ritual, it'll reverse the spell and send these guys back to their universes. And then what? We perish? No. No, thanks. I'll pass on that. Let me out of here. Peter! Strange, we can't send them back. Not yet. Why? Well, some of these guys are gonna die. Parker, it's their fate. Come on, Strange, have a heart. In the grand calculus of the multiverse, their sacrifice means infinitely more than their lives. I'm sorry, kid. If they die, they die. Peter! Don't. - Dude, what are you doing? - Peter, you gotta go. Go, go. - Okay. - Get out of here. This is why I never had kids. - Give me the box. - No. Whoa! - Oh, my God, I'm dead. - You're not dead, you've just been separated from your physical form. My physical... What? - How are you doing that? - I have no idea. You should not be able to do that. This feels amazing. That's one of the coolest things that's happened to me, but don't ever do that again. Wha... Hey! Get off of me!  La, la   Tis the season To be jolly...  - What is this place? - The Mirror Dimension, where I'm in control. Strange, stop. Can we please just talk about this? Parker, don't you realize that in the multiverse there are an infinite number of people who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man? And if that spell gets loose, they're all coming here. I know, I get it, but we can't just send them home to die. It's their fate. You can't change that any more than you could change who they are. But what if we could? What if we could change their fate? Whoa! Oh, what are you doing? I'm not giving you the... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Give me that back. Wait a minute. Is that an Archimedean Spiral? The Mirror Dimension is just geometry? You're great at geometry. You can do geometry. Square the radius. Divide by pi. - Plot points along the curve. - It's over, Parker. I'll come pick you up when it's done. Hey, Strange. You know what's cooler than magic? - Math. - Don't do this. - Ow. - I'm sorry, sir, but... ...I have to try. - What happened? - I fought with Strange and won. - What? - Look, I stole his ring thing. I was swinging through the city, and then I went through this massive mirror thing, and then I was back in... - Where is he? - He's trapped, - but I'm not sure for how long. - You could have left us to die. Why didn't you? Because that's not who he is. I think I can help you guys. If I can fix what happened to you, then when you go back, things will be different, and you might not die fighting Spider-Man. - What do you mean fix us? - Our technology is advanced... I can help you. You know, I'm something of a scientist myself. Octavius knows what I can do. Fix? You mean like a dog? I refuse. I can't promise you guys anything, but at least this way, you get to go home and have a chance. A second chance. Come on, isn't that worth trying? Trust me, Peter, when you try to fix people, there are always consequences. I mean, you don't have to come. I also didn't know that you could talk. But if you stay here, you're gonna have to deal with the wizard. Ah, so we go along or die. Not much of a choice, is it? - I just wanna go home. - Well, I, myself, don't wanna be killed, especially by a guy dressed like Dungeons & Dragons, so, what's your plan? I have it all under control. What are we gonna do about this thing? Uh, well, we need to find somewhere safe for it, right? - Yeah, sure. You gotta take it. - Wait, what? If something bad happens, you just push this, - and then it's all over. - We're not gonna leave you. You can't. It's dangerous. You've done enough. - We're in this together. - I know we're in this together, but I can't do this if you're in danger. Okay? So for me, MJ, please just take this. - Please. - Fine. - Thank you. - But, Peter, if I don't hear from you, I'm pressing the button. - Sure. - Okay. And I will do it. Yeah, we all believe you, Michelle. No way that's his girlfriend. No way. - She'll do it. - Absolutely, she will. - Okay. See you later. - Be safe. - You too. - Okay. Whoa. Okay. - Be careful, okay? - Yeah. You too. So, uh... who's coming with me? Well, I'm in. But if this goes sideways... I'm gonna fry you from the inside out. Where's Connors? He wants to stay in the truck. Okay. Alarm system deactivated. Hey, May. - Yeah? - I feel kind of bad - using Happy's place like this. - No, no, no. He'll get over it. New Yorkers - oppose the renovation... - Oh, sorry. So this is your plan, Peter, hm? No lab, no facilities? Just performing miracles in a condominium, hm? What, you gonna cook us some cures and some frozen burritos in a microwave? - I could go for a burrito. - He's gonna kill us all. Well, let's hope not. - You're up first, Doc. - What? Hey, I told you, I don't need fixing. I don't need fixing. Especially by a teenager using scraps from a bachelor's junk drawer. Nah, nah, nah. He got something back there. I can feel it. That weird energy. What the hell is that? It's a fabricator. It can analyze, design, construct basically anything. I thought that was the tanning bed Happy broke. Look at that. He's gonna kill us all. Whoa. What's going on there? So the chip in the back of Doc's neck was designed to protect his brain from the AI system that's controlling these tentacles, but if you look here... the chip is fried. So rather than him being in control of the tentacles, the tentacles are now in control of him. Which, I guess, explains why he is so miserable all the time. Thirsty? Well, yes, I am thirsty. Fresh water or salt? You know, because you're an octopus. What? Fresh water it is. Look at this place. - And all the possibilities. - What, this condo? Yeah, yeah, the condo. I love the whole open floor plan. No. No, man, I'm talking about the world. I kind of like who I am here. And all that power back there... I could be so much more. So why'd you come along? I have a daughter, and I want to see her. But he's not gonna send anyone home till he's finished his little science project back there. You trust him? I don't trust anyone. How'd you end up like that anyway? Oh... the place where I worked at, they were experimenting with electricity created by living organisms, and then, uh... I fell into a vat of electric eels. You're kidding. I fell into a supercollider. Damn. Gotta be careful where you fall. Remarkable. The technology and you. When all this is over, if you need a job and you're willing to commute to another universe... It worked. That totally worked. I got it. I did it. Uh, will you send him up? Here we go. - Sorry. - Hold on, Doc. Oh, will these humiliations never cease? You, keep your science fair project away from me! It'll work. Have faith. Says the reckless fool who turned himself into a monster. Please stop moving your head. - Hold still. - Don't you dare. Ugh! I swear, when I get out of this, we're gonna rip you a new... Doc? Doc? Doc? Dr. Octav... It's so quiet. Those voices inside my head... I'd almost forgotten. Otto. Yes. Norman. It's me. Would you look at that. I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly. Yeah, you're welcome. How can I help? This is Peter. Leave a message. Uh, yeah, Peter, this is Happy. I accessed my doorbell camera. Who are those guys, huh? Is that a cyborg? You bring a cyborg with robot legs into my house? Was one of the guys made of mud? What's going on? Call me. How does it feel, Norman? You're about to become whole again. No more darker half. Just you. Just me. Okay, um... It just goes right here. This... That should be drawing power now. I'm gonna come back in a second to check, but keep an eye on the lights. When they're all green, it means the electricity in your body's dissipated. Well, not all of the electricity. You need electricity for your brain to function. Your nervous system is... I'm not really sure why I'm explaining electricity to you. - Yeah, can I ask you a question? - Sure. Are these your Legos? Uh, I gotta go. I'll be back. - Something feels off. - What do you mean? - I don't like this. - Leave it alone. The sooner you guys get through this, the sooner we go home. - Well, where is he? - Uh, he's inside. And yet here we are, outside. Did you not hear me say, ""Don't lose him?"" I want incriminating footage of Spider-Man. I called Damage Control. They're on their way. And so it begins. ...place is about to be swarming with cops. Peter? What's wrong? I don't know. May? What is it, Peter? What's happening? Why are you looking at me like that? That's some neat trick, that sense of yours. - Norman? - Norman's on sabbatical, honey. - The hell? - The Goblin. ""No more darker half""? Did you really think that I'd let that happen? That I'd let you take away my power just because you're blind to what true power can bring you? - You don't know me. - Don't I? I saw how she trapped you, fighting her holy moral mission. We don't need you to save us. We don't need to be fixed. These are not curses. They're gifts. - Norman, no. - Quiet, lapdog. You don't know what you're talking about. I've watched you from deep behind Norman's cowardly eyes. Struggling to have everything you want while the world tries to make you choose. Gods don't have to choose. We take. May, run. Oh, my God. - What have you done? - I liked you better before. Up here. He's up there. It's the guy from the bridge. Did you see that? No, you don't! Strong enough to have it all. Too weak to take it! Now I got you. I told you there'd be consequences. Your weakness, Peter, is morality. It's choking you. Can't you feel it? It didn't work. Norman was right. He got it from you, that pathetic sickness. You tried to fix me. - May, go. - Now I'm gonna fix you. May, run, please. May! Peter, Peter, Peter. No good deed goes unpunished. You can thank me later. No! - May? - Peter. May, May, I'm here. Oh! - May. - Oh! May, I'm here. - Are you okay? - Uh-huh, uh-huh. What happened? Okay... Oh! It's okay. We're okay, right? Yeah. Knocked on my ass. - Yeah, me too. - That's all. I think I broke my ribs. - This is all my fault, May. - No. I should have let Strange send them back. You did the right thing. They would have been killed. You did the right thing. It's not my responsibility, May. Oh. What Norman said? My moral mission? No. - No, May... - Peter, you listen to me. You have a gift. You have power. And with great power, there must also come great responsibility, mm? Yeah, I know. Let's get the... out of here. Okay, let's go. Let me just catch my... - What happened? Are you okay? - I'm okay. Yeah, you're okay. What happened? Just have to... - catch my breath. - Okay, well, catch your breath. I'm right here. We're gonna take our time. You catch your breath. Then we'll take you to a doctor, okay? Are you okay? Somebody help! I need an ambulance, please! Somebody? - What happened? - Nothing happened. You're okay, you're okay. Let me just... Let me catch my breath. I'm right here. I'm right here. I'm right here. You're okay. It's just me and you. May? May? Will you look at me, May, please? May. May. What are you doing, May? Please, will you just wake up and talk to me? Please? Get out of the car now! Move! Get off, get off, get off me. - Peter! Run! - It's just me and you, okay? It's just me and you, okay? Oh, May, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so, so sorry. I love you. All right, Parker! Come out with your hands up! Come out right now, or we will open fire! Run! All right, let's go. Let's go! Move in! Tragedy. What else can I call it? What more need be said? The damage, the destruction. You saw it with your own eyes. When will people wake up and realize that everywhere Spider-Man goes, chaos and calamity ensue? Everything Spider-Man touches comes to ruin. And we, the innocents, are left to pick up the pieces. J. Jonah Jameson reporting. Good night, and God help us all. We are told that multiple people have been injured, and we can confirm at least one person has been killed... Still nothing? No. I'm gonna press it. - What? No, he... - I know he told me to wait... - but I'm gonna do it. - I just wish... I just wish we could see him. - Ned? - Yeah? - Do that again. - Yeah. I just wish we could see him. Oh. Okay. I just wish we could see Peter. Whoa. Lola, you're right. I am magic. Is that him? - Yeah, yeah, it has to be. - Peter. Peter! - Hey, Peter! - Peter! Yeah. Whoa! Hi. Hi. No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. I'm a nice guy. Okay. - Who the hell are you? - I'm Peter Parker. - That's not possible. - I am Spider-Man, in my world. But then yesterday, I was... I was just here. Wow. String theory, multi-dimensional reality... and matter displacement. - All real? - Yeah. I knew it. This has to be because of the spell. The spell? Like magic spell? - There's no spell. No. - No spell. - Magic's real here too? - I mean... - Shut up, Ned. - No, it's not real. - Shut up. Stop talking. - There's magicians, but no... Stop. Stop. - Prove it. - Prove what? - That you're Peter Parker. - I don't carry an ID with me, you know? Kind of defeats the whole anonymous superhero thing. - Why'd you do that? - To see if you have the tingle. I have the tingle thing, just not for bread. Can you not throw the bread again? You're a deeply mistrusting person... and I respect it. Crawl around. - Crawl around? - Yes. - No. - Yes, crawl around. - Why do I need to? - This is not enough. - This is plenty. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. It is. - No, it's not. Nuh-uh. - How do I stick to the ceiling? - Do it. Ned. My lola's asking if you could just get the cobweb there. - Since you're, like, up there. - Yeah. Thank you. We goo...? - We good? - For now. So I opened the wrong portal to the wrong Peter Parker. I guess you keep doing it until we find the real one. - Ouch. - No offense. - Okay. - Okay. You got it. Find Peter Parker. - What's the thing on his hand? - Shh. Find Peter Parker. Find Peter Parker! Great, it's just some random guy. Hello. Um, I hope it's okay, I just came through this, uh... Oh. It just closed. You're Peter? Yeah. Peter Parker. I... I've seen you two... Hi. Heh. Wait. He's... He's not your friend. Huh. Wait. So you're Spider-Man too? Why didn't you just say that? I generally don't go around advertising it. Kind of defeats the whole anonymous superhero thing. - I said that. - That's what he just said. My lola's asking if you could clean up the webs you just shot. - Oh, sorry, Lola. - Yes, of course. - I'm going to bed. - Night, Lola. Good night, Ned's lola. Uh, this might seem kind of weird, but I've been trying to find your friend ever since I got here. I just have this sense that... That he needs my help. Our help. He does. We don't know where he is. And, um, honestly, right now we're all he really has left. Well, uh, is there someplace that he might go that has meaning to him? Like a place where he would go to just...? Get away from everything? For me, it was the top of the Chrysler Building. Empire State. - It's a better view. - That is a sweet view. Yes. Yeah. I... I think I know exactly where that would be. I'm sorry. Peter, there's... There's some people here. - What? - Um... Hey, wait, wait! Whoa! What...? Sorry... about May. Yeah. Sorry. I got some understanding of what it is you're... No, please don't tell me that you know what I'm going through. - Okay. - She's gone. And it's all my fault. She died for nothing. So I'm gonna do what I should have done in the first place. - Peter... - Please don't. You don't belong here. Either of you. So I'm sending you home. Those other guys are from your worlds, right? So you deal with it. If they die, if you kill them... that's on you. It's not my problem. I don't care anymore. I'm done. I'm really sorry that I dragged you into this. But you have to go home now. Good luck. My Uncle Ben was killed. It was my fault. I lost... I lost Gwen, my, um... She was my MJ. I couldn't save her. I'm never gonna be able to forgive myself for that. But I carried on, tried to, um... Tried to keep going, tried to keep being the, uh... The friendly neighborhood Spider-Man 'cause I know that's what she would've wanted. But at some point, I just... I stopped pulling my punches. I got rageful. I got bitter. I just don't want you to end up like... Like me. The night Ben died... I hunted down the man who I thought did it. I wanted him dead. I got what I wanted. It didn't make it better. It took me a long time... to learn to get through that darkness. I wanna kill him. I wanna tear him apart. I can still hear her voice in my head. Even after she was hurt, she said to me that we did the right thing. She told me that with great power... Comes great responsibility. Wait, what? How do you know that? Uncle Ben said it. The day he died. Maybe she didn't die for nothing, Peter. Okay, so, uh, Connors, Marko, Dillon and, um... I think that I can repair the devices for Dillon and Marko, but the others... Oh, I got Connors. I've cured him once, so no big deal. - What? It's no big deal. - Great. Yeah, that's great. I think I can make an anti-serum for Dr. Osborn. Been thinking about it a long time. Gotta cure all of them. Right? Right. That's what we do. What? Just three yous. Um... So do you have a best friend too? I did. You did? He died in my arms... after he tried to kill me. It was heartbreaking. Dude. - Hey. - Will you run a diagnostic? Yeah. Hey, you okay? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay? Mm-hm. You don't deserve this. - I've ruined your life. - No. No, no, no. Look at me. I'm here. Not going anywhere. We're gonna get through this. And we're gonna get through it together. Okay? Okay. Thank you. You have someone? No. Ah, I got no time for Peter Parker stuff, you know? Hm. - Do you? - Uh... - that's a little complicated. - Oh, I understand. I guess it's just not in the cards for guys like us. Well, I wouldn't give up. Took a while but we made it work. - Yeah? - Yeah. Me and... MJ. My MJ. Uh... It gets confusing here. Yeah. - Peter! - Yeah? - Oh, sorry, did you mean...? - ""Peter"" Peter. - We're all called Peter. - We're all Peter. - Peter Parker? - Again, we're all Peter Parker. - The computer. - Oh! - Oh, I'm ready. - Yeah. Me too. Okay, so now, all we gotta do is lure these guys someplace, right? Try to cure them while they try to kill us, and then send them home. - Using a magic box. - Well, that's the plan. Are you gonna go into battle dressed as a cool youth pastor, or do you got your suit? - Good. - Here's your web cartridges. - Oh, thanks, man. - What's that for? Uh, it's my web fluid. It's for my web shooters. Why? Whoa! That came out of you. Yeah. You can't do that, huh? - No. - How on earth does that...? We're getting sidetracked. This is where we'll do this, okay? It's isolated, so no one should get hurt. We draw them there with the box. It's the thing they want. All we have to do is figure out how to get there. - We could portal there. - What? - I'm magic now. - Yeah, he's right. He can. - Yeah, we saw. - Yeah, he is. - Wait, really? - I got Doctor Strange magic. - No way. - Yeah. I promise, I won't turn into a supervillain and try to kill you. Okay. Thank you. Um, all right, here goes nothing. What's that thing you always say? - Expect disappointment and... - No, no, no. We're gonna kick some ass. Okay. Cure. Cure some ass. Cure that ass. Ladies and gentlemen, the Bugle tip line has just received a call from none other than the fugitive known as Spider-Man, fresh from his rampage in Queens. So, Peter Parker, what pernicious propaganda are you peddling? - Just the truth. - Oh, sure. The truth is... that this is all my fault. I accidentally brought those dangerous people here. Well, he admits it. And if those people are watching... just know that I really did try to help you. I mean, I could have killed you... at any given moment, but I didn't. My Aunt May taught me that everyone deserves a second chance. That's why I'm here. And where is ""here,"" exactly? A place that represents second chances. The Statue of Liberty? Good God, folks. He's about to destroy another national landmark. World, if you're watching... Believe me, the world is watching. ...wish me luck. Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man could use some. Okay, guys, it could be any minute now. Yep, almost done. You know, Max was like the sweetest guy ever before he fell into... a pool of electric eels. That'll do it. Mm. Oh, there it goes. Heh, you okay? Oh, it's my back. It's kind of stiff from all the swinging, I guess. Yeah. No, I got a middle back thing too. - Really? - Yeah. You want me to crack it? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, that'd be great. - All right. - You ready? - Yeah. Yep. That's good. - How is it? - Wow. - That's good. That's better. - Right? Yeah. Wow. This is so cool. I always wanted brothers. So you, like, make your own web fluid in your body? I'd rather not talk about this. - I don't mean to... - But are you teasing me? No, no. He's not teasing you. It's just that we can't do that, so we're curious as to how your web situation works, that's all. If it's personal, I don't wanna pry, but I think it's cool. I... I wish I could tell you, but it's, like, I don't do it. Like I don't... Like I don't do breathing. - Like, breathing just happens. - Whoa. Does it just come out of your wrists, or does it come out of anywhere else? Only... Only the wrists. Never had a block? I run out of webs all the time. - I have to make my own in a lab. - Right. That's... It's a hassle compared to what you got. Sounds like a hassle. But I did. You said that, I was like, - ""Oh, I had a web block."" - Whoa. Why? Existential crisis stuff. Yeah. Don't get me started on that. Hey. What are, like, some of the craziest villains - that you guys have fought? - Seems you've met some of them. Heh-heh, that's a good question. Yeah, I fought an alien made out of black goo once. Oh, no way. I fought an alien too. - On Earth and in space. - Oh. - He was purple. - I wanna fight an alien. I'm still, like, that you fought an alien in space. I'm lame compared... I fought a Russian guy in a rhinoceros machine. Can we rewind it back to the ""I'm lame"" part? - 'Cause you are not. - Thanks. I appreciate that. - I'm not saying I am... - But it's just the self-talk. - Maybe we should... - Listen, I... 'Cause you're amazing. Just to take it in for a minute. - Yeah, I can take it in. - You... You are amazing. - I can. Thank you. - You are amazing. - Will you say it? - I needed to hear that. Thank you. All right, guys, focus up. You feel that? Yeah. What's up, Peter? How you like the new-new? Look, you give it to me, I'm gonna destroy it. But I'll let you live. Don't make me a murderer, Peter. Okay, guys, here he comes. Hey, Max, I missed you, man. Ho! All right, MJ, heads up! Got it! Close it. Uh, Ned, it's not closing. Yeah, I know. - Why isn't it closing? - I don't know. - Did you close it before? No? - I mean, I've opened some. Max, Max, Max. Can we talk for a second? - Just you and me, just talk? - Look who showed up. - My old friend Spider-Man. - I'm trying to save you. - That's all I've ever wanted. - You're not trying to save me. - I am. - You ain't even the shit no more. - Oh... - Don't worry about me. I'll save myself. - Burn up! - Aah! Whoa! Well, I got his attention. Now what? Okay, great. Just FYI, lizard guy's here too. Guys, comm check. Hello? I need Max's cure. Yeah. I'm on it. I need the Lizard cure. Uh, okay, okay. Where's the box, Peter? - Flint, we could help everyone. - I don't care! Sorry! Gross! Sad to tell you, Sandman, nobody's going home. What the hell is going on out there? I keep yelling at you, Peter 2! - But I thought you were Peter 2. - What? I'm not Peter 2. Stop arguing, both of you! Listen to Peter 1. We're clearly not very good at this. I know, I know. We suck. I don't know how to work as a team. - Me neither. - I do. I've been in a team, okay? I don't wanna brag, but I will. I was in the Avengers. - The Avengers? - Yeah. - That's great. - Thank you. What is that? - You don't have the Avengers? - Is that a band? - Are you in a band? - No, I'm not in a band. The Avengers is Earth's mightiest... - How's this helping? - It's not important. All we gotta do is focus, trust your tingle and coordinate our attacks. Yes. Okay. - Let's pick one target. - Right. We take them off the board one at a time. - You got it. Peter 1, Peter 2. - Peter 2. - Peter 3. - Peter 3. - Let's do this. Ready? - Wait, wait, wait! I love you guys. Thank you. - All right, let's do this. - Let's go. Yes! Okay, Spider-Mans. Sandman's first. I'm gonna lead him inside the statue. I'll meet you at the top. - Come on! - Hey! - Hey, Dr. Connors. - Hello, Peter. - Peter 1! - I got it! Flint, we're trying to help you! Guys, I'm at the top. I need the cure! I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Just wait your turn, doc! I'll be right back. It's okay, Flint. We're gonna get you home. You just stay right here. How do we stop him? I've never seen him this powerful. It's the arc reactor. We gotta get it off him. You're not gonna take this from me. That's not gonna work. We gotta do this up close. Peter 2, go right. Peter 3, go left. On me. Unh! Yeah! I'm trying to close it. I can't help that it's not working. It's fine. You'll do it again. We'll keep trying. - All right, we got this. - Focus and close the portal. Close it. Oh, no. No, no, no. And that is a lizard, and we should go! Run! Come on! Come on, this way. Quick, quick, quick! Connors, stop! Yeah. Leave them. They're mine. I don't need your help. I got it just fine. Dr. Octavius, no. What are you doing? Get it off of me. There you go. MJ! Whoa. - We gotta hide this thing. - Oh, right. - Nice, Ned! - Oh, yeah! Oh. Where is he? - No! - Wait, wait, wait. Before you do anything, Mister... Doctor Strange, sir, Peter's plan is working. - What plan? - He's curing them. Dr. Connors? Welcome back, sir. Well, I'll be damned. Did you just open a portal? Yes... Yes, sir, I did. Hmm. Max? - Don't worry. I'm all tapped out. - Are you sure about that? Back to being a nobody. - You were never a nobody, Max. - Yes, I was. Yes, I was. You didn't see me. Can I tell you something, though? Yeah. You got a nice face. You're just a kid. - Ehh... - You're from Queens. You got that suit. You help a lot of poor people. I just thought you was gonna be Black. - Oh, man, I'm sorry. - Oh, don't apologize. There's gotta be a Black Spider-Man somewhere out there. Goddamn eels. The power of the sun. In the palm of your hand. Peter? Otto. Oh, it's good to see you, dear boy. It's good to see you. You're all grown up. How are you? Trying to do better. - Strange, wait, we're so close. - Skip it! I've been dangling over the Grand Canyon for 12 hours. I know, I know, I know. I, uh... Um... Uh... I'm sorry about that, sir. I mean... - You went to the Grand Canyon? - He could have used your help. It's okay. Uh, these are my new friends. This is Peter Parker, Peter Parker. Spider-Man, Spider-Man. They're mes from other universes. - No, no, no. - They're here to help. He's the wizard I told you about. Look, I am really impressed that you've managed to give them all a second chance, kid. But this has to end. Now. Can the Spider-Man come out to play? Strange, no! Are you okay? Yeah. I'm okay. Are you okay? Whoa! Thank you, Mr. Cape, sir. Ned? - Ned! - Hey! - MJ! - Peter? - Ned! - Peter! Hey! - Are you okay? - We're okay! Poor Peter. Too weak to send me home to die. No. I just wanna kill you myself. Attaboy. She was there because of you. I may have struck the blow, but you... Ha-ha, you are the one that killed her. Peter. What have I done? - It's you. - You okay? Uh, yeah, I'm good. I've been stabbed before. - Oh, good, good, good. - Hey. - Oh, man. - Hey, nice catch. Nice throw. What? Is that happening, or am I dying? Yeah, that's happening. That's real. Are there people in the sky? - I gotta go. - Yeah. I got it. You okay? What's happening? They're coming through. I can't stop them. There's gotta be something we could do. Can't you just cast the spell again? The original way, before I screwed it up. We're too late for that. They're here. They're here because of you. What if everyone forgot who I was? What? They're coming because of me, right? Because I'm Peter Parker? So cast a new spell. But this time, make everyone forget who Peter Parker is. Make everyone forget... - me. - No. - But it would work, right? - Yeah, it would work. But you gotta understand, that would mean that everyone who knows and loves you, we... We'd have no memory of you. It would be as though you never existed. I know. Do it. You better go and say your goodbyes. You don't have long. - Thank you, sir. - Call me Stephen. Thank you, Stephen. Yeah. Still feels weird. I'll see you around. So long, kid. Hey. Uh, I think this is it. - I think you're about to go home. - Okay. - All right. - Um, look, I, uh... Thank you. I just wanna... I want you to... I wanna tell you that... I don't know how to say this. - Peter. - I want you to know that I... You know. It's what we do. Yeah, it's what we do. Um... Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ. I, uh... Thank you, thank you, thank you. - I guess I'll see you. - See you. Bye. - Oh... - You're in so much pain, huh? - I am. - Yeah. Oh, you're okay. Oh! Yeah, you did. So proud of you. - Are you okay? - Yeah, we're okay. - Oh, my God, you're bleeding. - I'm fine. I'm okay. - You sure? - I'm fine, I promise. - Okay, okay. - I promise. Good. Um, we should go, right? Yeah. You're gonna forget who I am. - What? - Forget who you are? What are you talking about? It's okay. I'm gonna come and find you, and I'll explain everything. I'll make you remember me. And it'll be like none of this ever happened. Okay? But what if that doesn't work? What if that doesn't work? What if we can't remember you? I don't wanna do that. - I don't wanna do that. - I know. MJ, I know. There's not something we can do? We can't come up with a plan? There's always something we can do. There's nothing we can do. But it'll be okay. You promise? Yeah, I promise. I'll come find you, okay? I know you will. - Okay. - Okay. You better. If you don't, I'll just figure it out. I've done it before, I can do it again. I promise I'll fix this. I really hate magic. Yeah. Me too. I love you. - I love... - Just wait. Wait and tell me when you see me again. Sure. I love you. It's been a few weeks since the fiasco on the Statue of Liberty, and Spider-Man's cultists continue to contend that the vile vigilante is a hero. Well, if he were a hero, he'd unmask himself and tell us who he really is, because only a coward conceals his identity. Only a coward hides his true intentions. Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, this reporter will uncover those intentions come hell or high water. Hi. My name is Peter Parker. You don't know me, but I, uh... Hi, my name is Peter Parker, and you don't know me, but you... Okay, come on. - No way. - Hard to believe, isn't it? Hey. One sec. Can I help you? Hi. Um, my name is Peter Parker, and I... would like a coffee, please. Okay, no problem, Peter Parker. Doughnut for my fellow Engineer. Oh! Wait, what? MIT, they're the Engineers. The mascot. Oh, right, right, right. I should probably know that. Look at you with the school spirit. Tell anybody, I will deny it. Oh, okay. Peter Parker? Peter Parker. Your coffee. - Right. Thank you. - Mm-hm. Um... Are you excited for MIT? Oh, uh, right. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Actually, I am excited, which is weird, 'cause I don't really get excited about things. I kind of expect disappointment. 'Cause then you'll never actually be disappointed. Right? Uh... yeah. Right. I don't know, it kind of feels different this time for some reason. Right. Um... What I was... You okay? It doesn't really hurt anymore. Is there anything else? No. Thank you. No problem. I'll, uh, see you around. How'd you know her? Through Spider-Man. You? Same. I lost a good friend a while back. Felt like this. It hurts 'cause they're gone and then it hurts all over again because you remember what they stood for and you wonder, ""Is all that gone too?"" No, it's not gone. Everyone that she helped... they'll keep it going. You really think so? I know it. - Take care of yourself, okay? - Yeah. Nice to meet you. Rent is due on the first of the month. Don't be late.

Yeah, because it is. Now tell me again about your purple alien that loves stones. 'Cause I'll tell you what, man, aliens do not love stones. - Eddie, don't start. - They don't. Know what aliens love? Eating brains. Because that's what they do. All right? Seor, he made my family disappear. For five years. Five years? That's a long time. Maybe I... Maybe I should go to New York and speak to this... Spider-Man. Eddie, we are drunk. Let's go skinny-dip! I don't think we should skinny-dip. You have to pay the bill. What is happening? No! No, we just got here! No, not again! And there he goes. Without paying the bill, no tips, nothing. Don't cast that spell. - It's too dangerous. - Why? We tampered with the stability of space-time. The multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little. Your desecration of reality... will not go unpunished. It was the only way. But I never meant for any of this to happen. Wanda. Well, I knew sooner or later you'd show up. I made mistakes, and people were hurt. I'm not here to talk about Westview. Then what are you here for? We need your help. With what? What do you know about the multiverse? I'm sorry, Stephen. I hope you understand... the greatest threat... to our universe... is you. Things just got out of hand. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, Sir, please stop sending us disposable slippers. Those are employee benefits from my hotel, they are free. You've been consulting with me for two years,like I said, you can be a part-time taxi driver anytime as long as you buy a car. Sure, I'm just telling you now I've saved enough money for the car. Well, good for you. And I'm prepared to become a fancy chauffeur. I just need your approval. Bring your car and get the paperwork done then. Just a sec. I didn't order food. I did, Erdan. -- Who are you? -- I'm your cousin. Cousin? Come on in. It's alright. -- You're all grown up. -- You're painting walls? I felt it. About the size of an egg. If I had had it removed when it was much smaller, it would cost me 20 thousand, at tops. Now, since it involves vascular penetration, the procedure will cost 70 to 80 thousand. I heard that thyroid tumors are not lethal. Maybe the tumor won't kill me but the money sure will. You don't say. It's about the cost of a car. Erdan, you're buying a car? I was just browsing randomly. I thought you were gonna make a withdrawal. I was cleaning things up. It's expired. Erdan. I haven't come visit you since I came to Beijing. And here on my first visit, I'm borrowing money from you. You don't have to come visit. I'm fine. Zhang Beijing, time to take your medication. Zhang Beijing, time to take your medication. What are you taking medicine for? Same old problem. Hypertension. It must've cost you a lot. I have state health insurance, my employer paid for it. Sorry I wasn't much of a help. -- Take this with you. -- No, no, no. I came to ask you for a favor, how could I take your stuff? -- It's not right. -- Please, it's the least I can do. Okay, then...oh, I almost forgot. This is for you. It was your favorite. When we were kids, we used to fight over this, and you made me cry every time. Erdan, this hypertension thing. You should take it more seriously. Beijing is such a huge city. Who knows when we will meet again? You're not crying, are you? We can see each other anytime. I'm alright. It's the damn tumor. It gets me edgy. Cheer up, we'll figure something out. Okay.. You should go back now. I'm out of here. -- Take care. -- Sure. Hello, sir. Could you please wait a bit longer? I'm running a little late. Please don't give me a bad review. Son, I heard this ride-hailing thing pays a lot, eh? It's not bad. Thanks. What a wonderful young man. That'll work. Yeah. -- Is it open? -- Yes. Is it open? Yes. Because of the card or you? The card. A clean shave, and you'll look just like me. -- Not really. -- You're my cousin. Of course you do. Erdan. I've never lied to get anything. I don't think I can do this. State health insurance is a social benefit. It doesn't matter who benefits from it. Your disease is my disease. And my card is your card. It'll work. No.42, Ma Ke, please go to consulting room 226. No.42, Ma Ke, please go to consulting room 226. No.42, Ma Ke, please go to consulting room 226.

Are you Zhang Beijing? Yeah. This way. Hold on. Come back here. Come back. Is that yours? That. No.49, Jia Tianlong, please go to consulting room 229. No.49, Jia Tianlong, please go to consulting room 229. Swallow. Do you always sweat like this? It's the disease. Where are you from? Bei Beijing. I live in Xili Complex, Hujialou Street, apartment 7-8. Why are you lying to me? What makes you say that? The accent. You're obviously from Hengshui. So am I, and wherever we go, bro, we must not forget where we are from. You need surgery ASAP. Go do a blood test first. Sure. Are you paying cash or do you have health insurance? Insurance. Your card, please. Where's my card? Maybe I should come another day. Wait. What's that in your hand? You're looking for the card while holding it? It's all soaked in your sweat. If I didn't know you have the tumor I'd say you're using someone else's card. Zhang Beijing. You're from Hengshui, bro, why is your name Zhang Beijing? It should be Zhang Hengshui. Right? Here. -- What's wrong with your neck? -- Nothing, it's just numb. You sure are one interesting fella. Come here, let me take a look. -- Turn around. -- Doctor Cao! I've found you finally. You gave me a second life. I think you've mistaken me for someone else. I'm not Doctor Cao. My name is Ning. I'm thankful anyway, Doctor Ning. You, doc, are also a life-saver. You know what? Keep up the good work here. I'll go thank Doctor Cao now. I was looking all over for you, what happened? I'm not cut out for this. Let's just forget it. Man, you're such a wuss. You tumor must be bigger than your balls. You've done well so far. Now it's just a blood test, which requires no use of the card. As long as they don't see it, who knows which is you and which is me? Zhang Beijing! Lingzi? What are you doing here? I work here. Why are you here? I came for a checkup, with a relative. The doctor told to me to get a blood test. Great, you're all mine now. Follow me. Hurry up. Patients trust us with their lives. The hospital shall repay them with love and care. Your disease is my disease. -- Let me see the order. -- Order. Why are you examined for this? What's wrong with your thyroid? There's a tumor. No worries. You'll live. What are you guys doing? It's hunger. Gets me dizzy. Help me sit down. You must have hyperthyroidism, too. Look how your hand shivers. Stop it. Stop it now. You did like using needles on me when we were in school. I got nervous every time I saw you. That's bullshit. Always joking around. You haven't changed a bit. But your hand sure has. You're damn right. What's your skin-care secret? I look like I could be your dad. Cut it out. Make a fist. Make a fist. Let me make a fist. I see you're still mocking me. Now this is gonna sting. I stung him, what are you groaning for? He has blood phobia. You are good. That didn't hurt at all. Maybe this is the way it should be Don't wait till you're an old man To start seeking the freedom you want Thanks, boss. Erdan. You're the man. I applaud you. Just like that, you pulled this whole thing off. You're a natural, man. You should be a movie star. Once, Zhang Yimou came to our hotel to shoot a scene and he insisted that I should be an extra. I Turned it down. Acting is all about emancipating your true nature. And that, my friend simply means being reckless and shameless. True story. You were always the most shameless man in the village. You don't even blush when lying. Here, let's drink to you. Like you said, I'm a natural. Now, the first half was a complete success. As for the second half, the surgery part, I can't do that for you. But what if I screw up? You screw up and my health insurance is gone. That's why you need practice. Emancipate your true nature. How? How? You there. Come here. Come on. Let him have a go. No, no, no. I can't sing. Look at you, what a textbook loser. Now let me show you what emancipation means. -- Pick any song you like. -- This one. -- The Tiger Hunt. -- Behold the fearless hero! Cool. Here we go. This is a tough song. -- What's that old man doing? -- Through the forest... Bravo. Over the snowfield Bravo. My spirit erupts to the cloud You can do it, man. He won't hit the note. To the cloud Come on. To the cloud You can do it, man. Stop filming. Erdan, are you okay? Don't you scare me like that, cousin. This is not good. I need my medicine. I'm going to faint. -- Zhang Beijing. -- Got it. Did you print that out? Is it really that hot? Calm yourself. Sir, he was here this morning. Hyperthyroidism caused by thyroid tumor, triggering hypertension. We need to bring down the BP first. Go get the paperwork done. Be smart. Let's lower his BP. Play with it all you want, just don't eat. You're awake. Group consultation starts in the morning. Surgery will soon follow. You just need a good sleep tonight. Bro, relax. It's just a thyroidectomy. No big deal. Are they blind? Hey, come quick, this is getting out of control. They mistook me for you. Come here and take my place now. I kept saying that and they wouldn't let me in. Maybe I should come tomorrow. Tomorrow? They'll cut me open by then. Huh? Let me think of something. I'm just going to smoke a cigarette outside. Go back to your bed. You can't leave without the doctor's permission. I just wanna pee. I don't now. Come here...sir, could you come over here and clean the hall? Hurry up. Please. Can I at least answer the phone? Is this your partner in crime? You listen to me. Confess now you'll beat the other guy to it. I've told you. I was there to see someone. See someone Now, look at me Can't you see who I am? Sir, what were you thinking? Someone from you family got into trouble, you should help him, yes or no? Yes. So, people helping each other, is that wrong? Of course not. If so, then why are bad things happening to him? Irritation, typical symptom of hyperthyroidism. -- Calm down, please - -- I am calm. I just don't get it. He's a good man, why should he be the one who suffers? It's just a minor surgery. And Doctor Mei he's so proficient. -- It'll be gone before you know it. -- I don't want myself to be gone. I'm not even Zhang Beijing. Delusion caused by hyperthyroidism. Fine. You're not Zhang Beijing. You all know I am actually Zhang Beijing but you're telling me I'm not. You just don't believe me no matter what. Sir, we do believe you. -- Don't we all? -- You're just saying that, but you don't meant it. We all believe you and we mean it. Sir, have another one. Hyperthyroidism makes you crave for food. You're still not believing. Whatever. You got anything for hypertension? I think I'm about to pass out. Quit touching it. Your thyroid is fine. So, what's the story here? That's enough. Bring him in. You two, what is your relationship? How did your health insurance card wind up with him? He's my cou What are you talking about? I don't even know you. I only took his card, nothing else. I was delivering food to his apartment and, while he wasn't looking, I just took his health insurance card. I thoughtthe card is for people who need treatment and I'm people, too. How should I know that he would need it today? No, you're not doing this. Doing what? Don't interrupt me. I just couldn't afford to go to the hospital. So you think what you did was right? It's not right. Just emancipation of true nature. Yep. Your health insurance card. Keep it well. And I'm sorry. What are you waiting for? Take me down-town. Through the forest Was that what we talked about last night? Euphoria caused by hyperthyroidism? He was euphoric for sure. You're euphoric. Thank you, sir. You're a great driver. I know this car too well. -- I see! Bye! -- Bye. Erdan, Isn't this the car you were checking out the other day? I have just called the precinct, and you're out already? The cop was nice. He said it's merely a failed attempt, so he just let me off with a warning. You got lucky. Now let's go to the hospital. -- Take this. -- This is...? What did you I just, um paid for your surgery But What about the car? How do you know I'm buying a car? I'm your cousin. I know exactly what you're thinking. On second thought, this car is not that perfect. When you pay me back in a couple of years, I'll get its newest model. I'd give them some time to upgrade it. No. I can't take this. I read an article online, this thing can be cured by eating dandelion. And we have plenty of that back home. I'll ask the missus to find as much as possible. And I'll eat it every day. It's all I'll eat for every meal. That ought to do it. You do know this is nonrefundable, right? And you left your motorcycle. How is it nonrefundable? The surgery was a success. That's great news for all the dandelions in the village. Now I see. Can I have a quick look at your card? You two don't even look remotely alike. You got some balls pulling such a trick. Damn, you're right. How come you have a card, too? I got it for him. Cousin, so you have insurance all along? What's this? How come I didn't know? Of course you didn't. You're not even paying 18 bucks for a new wok. Let alone 200 for insurance. You would never have agreed. Even putting vinegar in noodles is a luxury to him. Checkmate. -- Does this card work the same as mine? -- It sure does. The rural health insurance works just as well. Government will take care of the sick. Are you sure the spending can be reimbursed? Right at the Village Council. What time do they close? Zhang Beijing. You really do hate keeping contact with old classmates. Why didn't you come to me for the health insurance problem? Did you forget you know someone who works in a hospital? My hometown is Puning, famous for its traditional Chinese medicine. My hometown is Shiyan City, Hubei. One of the sources for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. Hainan is famous for its durian. Jiuzhaigou, giant pandas. My hometown is famous for its apples. Changchun, the city of cars. My home is Afu Village in Guizhou. There's an UFO in our village. And aliens, too. It's true. Not only is the timing perfect, but the location is even better. That the UFO would land, of all places, in Afu Village, South Guizhou. And it's just 15 kilometers away from FAST So, even aliens have come all the way from outer space to congratulate us. Maybe they have holidays during this time, too? With this smart translation device, you'll get any hot date you want. The full moon is best appreciated from home, but the best lipsticks come from alien planets. Worry not about your pick-up lines and haggling skills, I promise, with this lipstick, even aliens will fall for your appeal. The aliens would go crazy for you. An ominous legend popular amidst the Chinese people says that... So, what are you waiting for? Buy! It! Now! For a spacecraft of such size to traverse dozens of light years, Even with a warp drive, the energy would be too great for the craft to endure at such speed. Mr. Guo, speak Chinese, please. Could there really be UFOs? Scientifically speaking... -- ...there is the possibility. -- Yes! Except the possibility is close to zero. It's nearly impossible. A UFO Falls From The Sky My dearest fans, here in the terrace fields transplanting rice seedlings is exhausting work, which causes chronicle lumbar strain. That's why...I invented this transplanter robot. Put the seedling in there. Alright, it's done. Isn't it convenient? Isn't it labor-saving? Thank you so much for another gift packet, my baby love knot, who's truly my biggest fan. What? Do another one? Welcome the ""Step Into Science Again"" TV Crew to Afu Village You guys made it. -- Hello, Mr. Wang, sir. -- I'm Qin. Don't call me sir. Just Wang is okay. Wang. I think I'll stick to sir. Here, I'd like you to meet the man. From our film crew, this is Mr. Tang, chief director, chief cameraman and chief producer. Mr. Chief, what an honor. You're more than welcome here. I'm Tang. Chief producer, chief cameraman and chief director. Gentlemen, I'd like you meet someone too. From our village, Mr. Wang, the boss man, the big shot tourism developer. Who drove his fancy limo all the way here to pick you up. He wants nothing but good publicity for this village. If you know what I mean. We came to Guizhou to investigate the UFO, not to help you make a commercial. It's the same thing, don't you think? -- No, it's not. -- Of course it is. Sir? Sir? Everyone's here, let's go. -- Yeah, let's. -- No, no, please wait. Just a sec. Someone else is coming. -- What are you talking about? Who? -- Me. Gentlemen, allow me to introduce Dong Axue, the child prodigy from CAS, and also a native of Guizhou. I've been friends with Mr. Wang for years. I'm just here to see what this alien fuss is all about. That's okay, as long as you stay out of our investigation. You're all our guests. Your presence here will only bring grace to Afu Village. -- Amazing grace! -- Let's go! -- Come on, hold it up! -- Up, up! Stay in line with me. Come on. Welcome to the Profound Province of Guizhou So much has changed here. Guizhou used to be known for bad weather all year long and inaccessible from all directions. I certainly don't feel any of that now. I still remember back in the day my sister had a thing for this guy from across the canyon. Technically, they were just one kilometer away. But somehow they broke up over the distance. In Southeast Guizhou, there used to be many villages that were just one kilometer apart. But since they had to climb over a mountain, people never got to meet each other. -- That's just the case. -- Great changes have happened since then. Now every county is connected to the superhighway system. And every town the highway. Concrete roads lead to every village. Afu, however, is located so remotely that we're missing out on all the perks of development. That's why we're left behind. But ever since the UFO came, it changed everything. Please. This way, please. Mr. Chief, look...hold on guys. A tourist group! Now we're in Afu Village, the Alienland where the UFO first appeared. You can buy alien-themed souvenirs over there, or take pictures with them here. Then come to the village square by four for the stage performance, a fantasy musical. Alien Love Story. Business is good. You betcha. Some places have mountains, others have rivers. We have the UFO, so we serve alien dishes. That's ridiculous. You can't eat aliens. Please allow me to show you an invention of mine. The FAST Sour Fish Hotpot. With special alien service. There's nothing else like this in the entire universe. See? Does it look exactly the same as the FAST telescope? -- Where's the fish? -- And the aliens? Have some soup first. It'll boost your vigor. Make you the king of the solar system. Then you eat the fish, which is good for your brain, making you smarter than the rest of the galaxy. Roses are red, aliens are blue, the pot is hot, and so are you. The FAST Sour Fish Hotpot, authentic alien flavor. Come on now. Let's dig in gentlemen. Wait. Before we eat, I have a question. Is there a Huang Dabao in the village? Guys, since the mountains here in Guizhou aren't suitable for running, and there aren't so many gyms around, I designed this mandatory treadmill. -- How is it mandatory? -- Let me demonstrate. Activate. Set your goal in life. A little ambiguous. Maximum life. Okay. Here comes my baby love knot again. No rush with the gifts, though. I do hope that you're attracted not to my good looks but my inventions. What is a mandatory treadmill anyway? It means, unless I've reached the goal I set for myself, this door will not open whatsoever. Well, this is too fast. No. Oh, damn it. Third Uncle. Third Uncle. Second Cousin. Second Cousin. Second Cousin. Huang Dabao. Huang Dabao. What the hell are you doing? We have to buy tickets to see an internet celebrity now? Dabao! Huang Dabao! Dabao, what's wrong? Dabao! Dabao! Dabao, are you okay? I'm alright. I did it for exercise. Just ran a marathon. You don't need to run a marathon. Just eat some goji berries. Who are these people? Allow me to introduce. This is Qin and Mr. Chief. They're here to promote our village. Satellite TV? Excuse me, I'll go redo my makeup. -- Wait. -- Mr. Huang, we're actually from Rediscover Science, the documentary program, and we're here to investigate the UFO. UFO They suspect that you built it. I built it? Qin, give this ball a close-up shot. It could be the tool he built it with. Take a hike. What's with the attitude? That's the name of it. It's called Take-A-Hike I came up with that. How come? Guizhou is famous for its mountainous terrain. It's not easy walking around here. So, when you need to go down the mountain and there is no ride, it can be really irritating. My dearest fans, this is Take-A-Hike. An invention that provides a permanent solution for the downhill trip, swift and convenient. Cut it out. This is not one of your live-streaming sessions. Let me ask you something. Why didn't you go to the movie on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival? Mr. Wang, the village head, said the movie sucks. I never said that. What I said was the actors were ugly. Where were you then? I was home, inventing things. With no alibi. Now you're leaving me with no choice but to use the exclusion method. Mr. Wang, would you please summon everyone. Who didn't go to the movie that night? I need to question them one by one. -- All of them? -- All of them. Mr. Chief, is your show called Rediscover Science or Law and Order? That doesn't matter. What matters is the truth. -- Name? -- I've eaten -- Age? -- Three bowls. What were you doing on movie night? Noodles. Next! Mr. Wang, do me a favor and summon no one of this age. But you said you needed to question everyone who didn't go to the movie. Investigations should be elaborate. Chief director, shall we go check out the crime scene? Where is that? Look, I built a 3D map of the surrounding area on my laptop. Given the approximate distance, as well as the trajectory of the thing from the video, the landing site is most likely here. What are we waiting for then? Let's move! Wind speed on the night was four meters per second. Plus, there was mist in the mountain and artificial light. That means the landing site should be in this location. We'll check out both, then. Let's go now! Mr. Chief, it'll be dark soon. You should probably wait till tomorrow. -- No! -- Well you see... I have a meeting to attend, so I think I'll just take off. A car can't get there. Then how do we get there? Huang Dabao. He has a tractor. Can the tractor go any faster?! Safety first. Well, this is too safe! Huang Dabao. Mr. Chief would like to go faster. Show them your invention. For this tractor specifically, I invented the All-direction Multi-dimensional Stereo Acceleration Sensor. It would, instantly, make you feel like you're dashing through air. Mr. Huang, bring it on! Is there a safety belt on this thing? We don't wanna get tossed out. Sit tight. Don't move. Now, get ready to feel it. Here we go. It just got a bit bumpy. According to the coordinates, it should be here. -- The aliens are real. -- Why would you say it's Huang Dabao? Forget about coordinates, what you need is a doctor. Guys, come quick. So, the aliens are real. See? I told you. That's not right. What is? It's definitely not right. Something smells funny. It's diesel. The UFO... runs on diesel? Diesel is just hydrocarbon alkyl. Energy conversion require combustion, which requires oxygen. And there's no oxygen beyond the earth's atmosphere. Even my cousin's tricycle runs on gasoline. This is forged. By you, you mean? -- No. -- It is you. It's not me! It's most certainly you. -- It's most certainly not me! -- You forged this! It's most certainly not him. Judging by the traces here, this place was recently incinerated. Huang Dabao has been with us this whole time. He couldn't possibly have the time to set fire to the grass. Also, it is against my idea of environment-friendly inventions. Chief director, chief director! You need to see this. Chief director. Two more people didn't go to the movie that night. Who? Who do you reckon would benefit the most from the discovery of the UFO? I see. -- Are they asleep? -- Yes. Go, go! Dabao! Huang Dabao! Dabao. Huang Dabao! Where is he? Dabao, where are you? I'm at the gate. Be right back. Where were you this late? Where were you? I had to think something through. Like what? Sir, the Take-A-Hike. It's moving. -- You're delusional. -- It's really moving. Chief director is inside! Why would he steal my invention? Who's stealing your invention? Get him out now! Mr. Dong. -- Chief director! -- Go after the ball! Get the ball! Mr. Chief! Mr. Chief! Mr. Chief! Catch the ball! Block it! Mr. Chief! -- Quick, stop it! -- Stop the ball! Stop it! Mr. Chief! Mr. Chief! Slow down. See? It's okay. Mr. Chief! Mr. Chief! Are you alright? Mr. Chief. I'm fine. Not bad. You can't even stand. I'm okay. Huang Dabao, this thing is no joke. Extremely safe. I spent most of the year developing it and I didn't even have the balls to try it. Sir, you are the man! If I were rolling down like that, I'd puke my guts out! Oh, that reminds me! -- It's okay. -- Alright, everyone. Show's over. Go back to sleep. You've all seen how the big ball rolled down. Now go back to sleep. Come on, off you go. Alright, I'll just cut the crap. Did you forge that thing out there? What thing? What thing? Burn a fake circle in the meadow with diesel to make it look like an UFO. Dong's analysis wasn't necessary correct. Why can't an UFO run on diesel? Of course it can't. What evidence do you have? Because I am the alien. And I'm your daddy. That there is the thing you're looking for. You invented it too? It is my biggest invention ever. I did the first flight test on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. I didn't expect it to be a success. Although the cruising power is obviously inadequate. But I'm still happy. Who knew things would get out of control after that? Why didn't you tell us earlier? How was I supposed to know it would make the news and bring those TV people here? Fair enough. Now I can't hide it anymore. -- I'll just come clean with them. -- And say what? Take a hike. I mean you... ...you make this public, what about tourism? Yeah. Dabao, don't you want everyone in the village to have a better life? Where's your heart? Where's your heart? But, I decided to tell the truth because because I have a heart. Truth? The truth is other villages are blessed with natural beauty and the town of Kedu has made a fortune off the telescope. What do we have? -- Only aliens. -- Who's there? We still can't fall asleep. Quick! Hurry! -- Get it up there! -- No! -- I'm begging you, please. -- No. -- Huang Dabao! This is an order! -- No. According to article 11 of the Civil Aviation Law of the People's Republic of China, Manufacturing of aircraft of any kind must be approved by the civil aviation authority. We can have you arrested. Come on, give me a hand. Give me a hand. One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. Gentlemen, still awake, huh? Yep. So, what are you doing? Discussing, playing poker, talking. We are discussing and talking about whether we are going to play poker. That's right. It's true. You guys have had a tough day. And now you're playing poker? I wish I had your energy. You're not so bad yourselves, still staying up at this hour. Huang Dabao, why don't you tell us more about the things in your yard? They're right there. Be my guest. Just tell us more. May I? I know more about those things in the yard than he does. It's true. What's that sound? I was burping. That was some funny noise you made. Mr. Huang, I'm feeling a little funny in the stomach. Where's the bathroom? The bathroom? In the yard. Where in the yard? Outside. You know what? I'll show you the way. Great. Let's go. What is it? You're sweating. What's wrong? I'm a little weak. -- Have some water. -- No. -- Come on. -- Really, I'm good. -- Just drink it. -- No. -- Drink. -- I'm not drinking it. Fine, don't drink. No need to get mad. Jeez. -- Is this another invention of yours? -- Don't touch that. It's not what you think it is. What do I think is it? No, don't touch that. Relax, you're not gonna go to jail for this. All you need to do later is say you're sorry to the camera. What did you build the UFO for? It was a tragic love story. Many years ago, I fell in love with this girl in the village across the canyon. She is a fair maiden with a heart of gold and the most beautiful eyes I've ever known. Plus a long thick pigtail. Is her name Xiaofang, as in the song? It's hua. Her name is Dong Ahua. How did you know? My name is Axu and hers is Ahua. The hamlet across the canyon is our home. Xiaofu Village. You two were separated by the distance of merely one kilometer. It is the greatest regret of her life. So, you are her younger brother. Brother. Long time no see. It's been 11 years, brother. You've all grown up. What about your sister? -- She got married. -- Good. That's good. Fantastic. Then divorced. That's too bad. -- She really got divorced? -- Yeah. So, what did you invent that thing for? Deliver love letters? Actually I was thinking about logistics. You see, here in Guizho, we have gorgeous scenery and good people, too. The lack of infrastructure is the only thing standing between us and the outside world, preventing lovers and products from leaving the mountains. With improvement in logistics life would be a lot easier for us. Well, with that crappy UFO of yours, it'd be a long shot. No, no. Actually I think it's pretty close. There are problems in power and cruising. I'll help you figure that out. -- Really? -- Yeah. That'd be great. Thank you so much. Brother, I should thank you. For letting me do something to help my home province. And also, a chance to visit my sister. You sister? Axue. Ahua? You're sort of an internet celebrity now. What don't you call me by my screen name? Your screen name? It's you. My baby love knot. You guys are too cute. Well, you didn't know, but there was once a chance that I missed because of long distance. If I were given a second chance, then believe me, I'd never let her go. -- Yeah! -- Make it tight! A small village in South Guizhou is the place I call home Amongst big mountains it lies, secluded and remote. Visitors from outer space in the UFO. A sight that everyone can't wait to behold. Alien civilization, dope technology. It's all local invention, you better believe me. Soaring up, diving down, it goes wherever you want. Maybe someday it'll fly up the mountains and beyond. The one thing I remember about my hometown is the misty pines in winter. The one thing I'd never forget about my home is the Torch Festival. During summer it is extremely hot. Hulun Buir in winter is extremely cold. There's snow everywhere outside the door. The tasty Hot Dry Noodles. I ran to play by the sea holding a tire. Temple Fair on the first day of the Chinese New Year. I can't remember. ONE LAST LESSON St. Gallen, Switzerland Dad. Dad, are you up? Yeah. Coming. Alright, kids. Breakfast is ready. Put your toys down. Dad, maybe you should sit this one out. I don't want you to end up like the other day. I'm fine. Why don't I call the hospital and move your checkup forward? No need. I know my health better than anyone. Dad should really consider retiring. He wouldn't even go to the hospital, let alone quit teaching. It'll kill him. University of Berkelin Screenplay by Lulufu Bu, Keke Hu, Weilin Hua & Zheng Xu Hello, Professor Fan. No, no, no. Like this. Professor Fan, Professor Fan. Call an ambulance, go, go. He is awake. Pa. How do you feel, Pa? The wetch. Time. My wetch. Your watch. My wetch. Veight o'clock, the class. I'm running late. Pa, you can't go to the class. -- You passed out. -- Who passed out? Class begins at veight, and I'm not there yet. Bullshoot. Pa, you can't teach anymore. The doctor says you have a cerebral infraction. -- I have what? -- A stroke. Stone color. Or maybe scarlet. -- Well... -- Dad, no! I'll bring all the colors. I'll bring all the colors. Doctor! Doctor, doctor! Pa, where are you going?! What are you doing?! Old Jiang, he is about to crow. Who is about to crow? Only roosters crow. What rooster? Old Jiang. Jiang Dazhong. Before the class, clang, clang, clang! Clang, clang, clang! He needs to crow! -- What are you even talking about? -- The students are waiting for me. The paints. The boat is about to sail off. Pa, stop it. Call me Sir. And wipe off your snot. You still don't get it. Two plus two equals veight. Your bum is going to be spanked. Where is the bum? The bum. The paints. Sorry. -- Here they are. -- No, no, no! Calm down. This. I got the paints. It began to rain. And then... Cerebral infarction is a common cause of dementia in the elderly. It is often accompanied by severe behavioral and language disorders. Based on your father's symptoms, he has already developed alternating periods of cognitive impairment. We call this 'fluctuating cognition'. Your father's speech does not suggest to me the classic signs of memory lapse from cerebral infarction. But the phrases and words that he's using suggest to me that his memory is stuck at a specific moment in the past. You mean he is living in the past? Yes, yes, you can say that. But how does the modernness of this world or the outside buildings not freak him out? Think of it this way. Imagine he is in a room, and he is trying to put together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Now, the elements that match his memories are the pieces. And the picture will tell us a story. And the story will be something very significant that happened in his past. Tomorrow, Dazhong, go find some nails. And fix the desks and chairs. Jiang Dazhong I knew I'd heard that name before. When my father was teaching in Wangxi Village, he was the school janitor, the bell ringer. Clang, clang, clang, that's him. So his memory is stuck in when he was teaching in the elementary school. Are we bringing Pa to that shabby village go give one last lecture? Qiandao Lake, China This Mid-Autumn festival, there might be an overflow of tourists,  putting the accommodation of our village to a test. Now is the time. But all the guesthouses in the neighbourhood are booked up. Village tours are so popular now. Go check the forest oxygen bar, find a clearing, pitch a few tents put up a couple of tree houses, there you go. Try to get some RVs here. Boathouses on the river is also an idea. International call. Hello. Chief, I need to tell you something. Family trip this way up. Okay. Are you here for the tea picking festival? Please sign in first. Come on, this way. Inside. -- Where is your boss? -- Jogging with the guests. It's getting late. Hasn't she gotten back already? One, one. Xiao Lai. So you just leave your business unattended. Guess which year? 2001, Shanghai Translation Publishing House. -- Amazing. -- How about this one? 1998, People's Literature. Hi guys. What you see here is a very special experience offered in our village, soya beans grinding. You get to pick the beans and then grind them. It gives you such a sense of accomplishment. This is our 2nd generation beehive. Intelligent beehive. Temperature change at the push of a button. Temperature up, dancing bees. Temperature down, all in peace. And the yield doubles. Everyone, why is it that moss can break down rock? I know, I know. Tell me. Hey, I heard you are about to expand the cocoonery. I have to. The number of orders is getting overwhelming. That's major. Tell everyone in the group chat to gather for meeting. Group send it is. A meeting. Calling us together. Now can we please quiet down? I want to know if it is possible that based on this old photo, we recreate a class to help Mr. Fan out. Listen to me. I remember that in 1992, when Fan was giving his last lecture, it was raining cats and dogs, coming down in buckets. Just cut the crap. Listen to me. I would love to help, okay? But how are we supposed to go back to '92? Exactly. This house used to be a pigsty. Mother pigs and baby pigs were running wild. That's correct. The spot that you're sitting on is where the mottled black sow in village gave birth to so many piglets. I know that. Back then the village was plagued by flies, right? Now you can't find one single mosquito, can you? Back then, all the houses were roofless. And now, even the pigsties are separated rooms with a ceiling. How can we go back to '92? Right. Knock it all down? Knocking down the village? I'm the first to say no. -- No way! -- Me too! I never asked you to do that. All I suggested is to restore a classroom and make this last lecture happen. What about the students then? We can't go back to 7, 8 years old. Yeah. 1992? I wasn't even born yet! Should I restore myself to nothing? We will just find some kids. His mind is all muddled. He won't know the difference. Exactly. Things have changed so much. We can't go back. That's enough. My turn to speak. In 1982, Mr. Fan was transferred from the city to here, he could have left in 1985 when his term ended. And why didn't he leave? He was a hard worker and no whiner. He stayed here till all of us could go to town for school. Ten years. One teacher for ten years. He taught us math, Chinese, and then PE. Wearing a pair of worn leather shoes, he led us to kick shuttlecock. If it were not for him, you, your father and your father would be illiterate. It's true what Da Lei said. Right! Let me ask you - two plus two equals what? What was your answer then? Tell us. Eight. You said eight, and I said six. Now you are the secretary, and I'm the head of village. And Xiao Feng, who used to play with dirt all day, is now an accomplished architect. Right. So now it's time to show our gratitude, our gratefulness. Wait. Even if we could recreate this classroom, he is coming back from Switzerland. There are bridges and cars along the way that he can't not see. The Swiss doctor said that now Mr. Fan is making a jigsaw puzzle in his head, which is the image of 1992, the image of the last lecture, get it? Mr. Secretary, If he ever runs out of the room, then it won't be 1992 anymore. - Right! - Right! - Right! - Right! - Right! - Right! - Right! - Right! -- Right! -- You're not telling it right. Enough! Mr. Fan's brain is turning into a puzzle, a puzzle about us. Can't we just figure out a way to help him? Jiang Dalei. The cocoonery that you are expanding is exactly the place where the old classroom used to be. Plus, he has people working on it now. That's handy. Wait, what does my cocoonery have to do with it? -- Even handier. -- What? In Switzerland, Mr. Fan keeps saying that his father is ringing the bell. -- My father is long gone. -- You can play him. Look at you, all cocky and stuff, you look just like you father. -- Am I right? -- Yes, he does. It's a deal then. Applaud. Hey! Hey! Hey, what are you... You promised me, you will help me restore everything once this is over. We are pulling all the people and resources for this. There is no turning back. We fight till the end, we fight to win. There is no second chance. Now kids, Let's turn the clock back to 1992. Your mission is most glorious yet arduous. So dear students, let's go to Bullet Point 13. What was 1992 like? You weren't born yet. Keep it light on the drama, though. You've gone through all the key points? Yes, we have. The most important thing is to remember the name of your character. Gently, gently. You two, podium to the side. That's right. Give me that chair. Kid, hand me the chair. I'll wipe it clean. Xiao Jiang, quick. Get this water hose in place and running. -- And patch up the roof tiles! -- Got it! The rain should be pouring in right through there. Roof tiles stay still, no misplacement. I said we need chicken around. I didn't say they have to be in the classroom. What are the bees for? We couldn't find flies. But the drones don't sting. Get them out of here now. Not one left inside the room, quick. We need to keep it realistic. Mr. Secretary, the roof is done. Then go pick up them at the village entrance. They are arriving. Come on, guys, hurry up. Does the mustache look real enough? Real? Yes. -- Stuck? Not really. -- Don't tangle that. If it has to be really real, I'll be driven nuts. They are almost here, hurry up. Take that away, don't let him see it. What are you two up to? Raising the national flag. Going back in time wouldn't do better than this. Greetings, passengers. The train has now arrived at its destination. On the boat now. But this is not a boat. We should travel by water. This is a waterway. Look, it's all water outside. Have some rest. Attention, attention. Target is arriving at the dummy entrance of the back hill. Get ready. Pa, wake up. I think we're here. I love this smell. Thank you. Goodbye. Wait, Fan. Who am I? Who am I? Goodbye. Who are you. You are the man who drove me here. Class begins. Don't make me ring a second time. Dazhong, I told you before. Put some straws over the roof. It becomes a rain when it waterfalls. Okay. Dazhong, why has your head gotten bigger? It's the stress. I've been stressing over the roof thing. It's pointless to stress. There is a problem to every solution. Take care of yourself. Chief, chief, and Mr. Secretary. He's here. -- I'm so sorry for the trouble. -- We do this because we're thankful. Chief. Thank you for the hard work. My father is getting really sick. He doesn't even recognize me. Let's try and see. Everybody assume your position. He's here. Class. -- Stand up. -- Good morning, Sir! Sit down, please. Mr. Monitor, Get up, you're the monitor. Why are you shorter than before? Where did your dimples go? I smoothed them out by blowing bubbles. Fragile dimples. Everyone, our village school and town school are going to be merged. Why? Right, by then there will better teachers to teach you. So this is my last lecture. There are things that I dread I might remember, so I forget them in my notebook. Shouldn't it be that he is afraid he might forget so he writes them down in his notes? He is babbling. Jiang Xiaohong, your rubber shoes are leaky. After class ask them to find me, and I will mend you. Jiang Qianfang Jiang Qianfang Your math worries me the most. Two and two equals what? -- Four. -- Veight. Black pig from south village gives birth to 2 white piglets. White pig from north village gives birth to 2 black piglets. How many piglets are there? Veight. Correct, veight of them. Veight. Jiang Weian Yes. Tell your father. I'm not going for diner tonight. As long as he works hard in school, It will be a gift to me. It should be me working hard in school. Everyone, Today, I will go off the textbook. I would like to know what you think our hometown will look like in the future. If you want to draw, then write. If you want to write, then draw it. The title is Me and My Town Home village. It should be Hometown. Sir, it should be Hometown. Hometown. Home Ten years ago, when I for the first time stepped into the classroom. There were only two students and one piglet. A piglet. I wanted to turn away and leave. But I couldn't bear the sight of so many children feeding pigs while they should be in school. So I talked to one family after another. Finally, the desks and chairs started to fill up the classroom. The sound of you reading got louder and louder. You all know the boy named Jiang Dongfang, right? Yes. When he was here he once asked me, he said, Sir, I don't want to eat dried radish everyday. Will studying bring me good food to eat? A couple of days ago, he came back from senior high to see me. He told me that there is a good chance that he will enter Shanghai Jiao Tong University. It's said that the food in the canteen is so good. When I heard that, I felt the past ten years I spent here are worth it. What? Give it back. Let go. What's happening? Sir, he took my drawing. It's not a drawing. It's starch. Show me the drawing. It's splashed mud. The monster spider's cave. No. No nonsense. Tell me what it is. This is a school I drew. You want the school to be like this. Why? This is a window. This is the roof. What about this? It's a slide. It's red here, and blue here. Beautiful. Why don't you color it? I don't have them. Who among you has paints? No. Sir, I have a blue pen. I will find some paints for you. Who is it? Why does he have a cellphone? -- What noise is it? -- Your student. Didn't you take all their phones? What's going on? What's this? It's a cellphone. You don't know what cellphone is? What the hell? Your drawing isn't supposed to have colors. Why can't I do colorful drawings? Because you don't have color pens. No, no, no. -- What? -- Red, blue, green, I have them. I got all the colors. I Hey. There's no water. No water. Go check for any blockage. Blockage somewhere. You're stepping on it. It's a mess now. Go check it. Calm down. Calm down. Good morning, Sir. The book is wrong. The chair is wrong. You are not Jiang Xiaofeng. What's your name? Peter. What happened to you, sir? What's going on? I have to go inside. Don't go. What now? How did this happen? That way. Sir, why are you leaving? The class isn't finished. Come back. Mr. Fan fell down. Mr. Fan fell down. Mr. Fan fell down. Mr. Fan! Mr. Fan! Mr. Fan! Mr. Fan! Mr. Fan! Mr. Fan! Mr. Fan! This is for you. Mr. Fan...Mr. Fan... Do you remember me? This is a school I drew. It's red here, and blue here. Gently I lift up your face Jiang Xiaofeng. Hey. Your drawing, now, I get it. Tell me you'll never be alone. Looking deeply into your eyes. No need to say another word. Holding tightly onto your hands. This warmth will never ever change. Together we share joy. We share the same sorrow. And we have the same aspiration. If I were to compare my hometown to a scent it must be that of the ocean. To me the taste of home is like cured meat. The taste of home is salty. The smell of hotpot in the air. It's definitely the potatoes. The taste of Songhua River. -- It's sweet. -- Like clams. -- Salty sea water. -- Like lamb hotpot. Hot oil poured on chilli. Like sand. Rough, dry and bitter. The taste of home to me is nothing else but the mouthful of sand on a windy day. THE ROAD BACK Many have asked me the same question. With all my popularity now, what do I usually sell? The answer is a supreme lifestyle. The best and freshest food in the business. Could you look at me for a change? Stop bugging me. This Yan Feiyan is not that great a saleswoman. She just has a hot body. Like a trophy wife. Man oh man, I used to be just like her. Jia Yuling, I love the way you look now. Yue Longgang, quit bullshitting me already. No, I meant it. That'shey, look, that's... -- What? -- That one. -- Which one? -- That's her. -- Which one? -- That woman. Who? Get me the best hotel they have. With a freezer. -- Isn't that you know who? -- What are you talking about? Can't you finish the sentence? It's that woman who -- That's her. -- Who? -- What are you doing? -- Sister, can I get a picture? -- Oh my god, I'm your biggest fan! -- The Queen of Live Commerce! I watch all your streams, don't you remember? Take a selfie with us, please. Three, two What's the point of taking a selfie if no one can recognize us? You might wanna go easy on the beauty cam. It's too much. Let's switch to original mode then. Got it. Three, two Yue Longgang, original mode? Do you realize how I'd come off? Or yourself? Staff ID 9438 and 9601, in about 20 minutes your supervisor will have a word with you about harassing passengers. Based on my personal experience you'd both get a level-two penalty. Let's go, Jessica. There's nothing to negotiate. Stop playing games with me. We need to be at Shaligou Central School at 3 P.M. for the school anniversary gala. Okay. I don't want another incident like what just happened. You must protect me. Ms. Yan, I love you. Me, too. There are con men out there who would pose as a classmate or a fellow countryman to get close to people. It's all part of the fraud. If I run into one, I'll give you a sign, and you need to come over immediately. Okay, okay. What are you talking about? Twenty million is nothing. You think I care about such a small sum of money? You listen to me, I have one goal. That is to provide everyone in China with the best apple in the world. Big sis? Going back to Shaligou for the anniversary, too? Yeah. What are the chances? It's me. Qiao Shulin. You must have been too busy studying. We were six years apart. Hi, sir, excuse me. You're in my seat. I just ran into a relative. I'm sorry. Can we switch seats? Thanks. How time flies. One year, we were performing together on a windy day with sandstorm. It's a musical. ""The Girl Who Collects Mushrooms."" You were in it? I was the girl. I was one of the mushrooms. Sir, excuse me. That seat is taken. What's the matter with you? This is ridiculous. If you have a problem, talk to a stewardess. Hurry up, off you go. Sis, you see, I sell apples. And you do live commerce. I can give you really good prices. Just friend me on WeChat. Scan your face. -- Jessica. -- No need to see a card. Just give me your number. Hey, sis. What's up? Something wrong with your eyes? Excuse me, Ms. Yan needs to rest now. -- Sorry. -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sir, may I see your boarding pass? Here. Sir, this is an economy class ticket. Please go back to your seat. That's impossible. I... My assistant booked me a first class ticket. Please go to your seat. The plane is about to take off. Thank you for your cooperation. Thank you. Say hello to the captain for me. I'm sorry. Call me. Say hello to the whole crew, too. I thought you were flying first class. I don't want to bother big sis. So I paid to have my seat downgraded. Downgraded? Repeat after me. Where there is a will, there is a way. Where there is a will, there is a way. One more time. Where there is a will, there is a way. Where there is a will, there is a way. Where there is a will, there is a way. Keep Up Your Discipline Study hard. Learn something useful. Make this a better place. It's no using pushing me now. I don't have the money to pay you back. Just give me another day. I've found a new fish. Quiet, please. Quiet, please. And I'm reeling her in today. Take a grab of the yellow soil and put it against my heart. Greetings, everyone. I am Han, your tour guide for the trip. Also a Chinese teacher at Shaligou Middle School and the editor of our official WeChat account. On our way to the school, I'll interview each one of you, digging up some stories of our alumni. And the theme of the interview is A Taste of Home. I wanna go first. Here. Qiao, Qiao. What's the taste of home to you? Crispy and sweet. As the apples from our hometown. Big sis, have a bite first. We'll talk later. These apples make grandmas square dancing queens -- Thank you. -- and children slay those online lectures. Here, I've got a QR-code. A Taste of Home. The wetland is right ahead. We'll take a 15-minute break. Ms. Yan, didn't you say your hometown is on the Loess Plateau? Where is the loess? How come it's so different now? The official term is returning farmland to forests. Sis, you should take a a look around Shaligou. We've turned some four million mu of Maowusu Desert all into oasis now. Seems like you've done a lot for our home. I'm a very successful man. What's the point of making billions if you don't give back? Sis, I need to confirm something with you. You're staying at the five-star hotel in town, right? Right. And you, brother Qiao, are staying in your old cave-house by the school. In my dreams I weep my eyes red remembering the coziness of the cave-house. Here. Han, please get us a cave-house as well. Sure, I'll make the arrangement now. That's not really necessary, boss. You city folks would never understand how we feel about our home in the country. You must know, Fluffy. That deep heart-wrenching nostalgia. What did you just call me? Fluffy. You had inverse eyelashes that made you blink all the time. You were the baby raised by Madam Gao. Sis. Listen to me, I'd rather not talk about that. Seriously. I hope that our cooperation is based on our business resources, instead of this special bond from the past. Why don't you tell me more about those apples of yours? I got everything on my phone. Thanks, sis, thank you. Boss, that guy, Qiao, is definitely a con man. I had a sneak peek of his phone and saw lots of messages from debt-collectors. I doubt he even has a decent amount of cash on him. Is that so? That'd be more fun. Do I look at this? Right here,please. Go. So, what did you bring with you on this homecoming trip? I'd say it's love. Unlike tangible gifts,I believe, spiritual ones are priceless. Two bowls of mutton scraps Sure, no problem. Two more noodle soup here. Gouzi. The bus is here. Watch out. Lunch time, everyone. Brother Qiao's treat. Buckwheat noodles. Sesame rice stew. Steamed pumpkin. Bread soaked in mutton soup. My mouth is watering like crazy. Wow, they even have lamb offal. -- Fluffy. -- Yes? These are authentic foods from home. We have to try everything. You got it. Plus, how expensive can a bowl of lamb offal soup be? 280 yuan. For a bowl of lamb offal soup? What did you put in there? A special elixir? Or sea cucumber? Both. It's our new special. How did you know? -- Fluffy? -- Yes? -- Sis? -- This is so good. Can I have another one? Just swipe them all. Next stop Shaligou, let's go. All passengers to Shaligou. I'm used to carrying no cash nowadays. Hey, sis. You go ahead. Don't wait up. It's okay. I'll wait. Thanks for lunch, Mr. Qiao. Still not working? Did you update your POS terminal? Brother, I don't think even the latest update would allow it to access a metro card. Qiao Shulin. I recognized your shameless face at first glance. Wei Peng? But Han said no one from my class is coming. That's bullshit. Why didn't you tell me? You big-shot billionaire. What are you doing back home? Mr. Billionaire, could you pay up first? -- Let me. -- No, no, you don't have to. -- Please. -- Come on, I'm not letting you do this. -- Don't be pretentious. -- You're home now. -- How much do you make a month? -- None of your business. I got this. You don't want to fight me. -- Alrighty then. -- Good. What the hell did you order? Where is he? Why are you lying down? You and your classmates must know him well. Actually, we don't have that privilege. Qiao here is a billionaire. He Big sis. Are all the famous alumni here? I know this is not the fancy limo you're used to but I can take you guys for a ride. Have ourselves a desert safari. Why do you keep touching me? Guess there's no need for formalities then. We can catch up on the road. Let's go. Your metro card. About two thousand years ago, this used be to a pasture for the Huns. It was larger than Hainan Island. And by Tang Dynasty, it became a desert. -- Say, Fluffy -- Yes, sis? Didn't you say you made a huge contribution to afforestation of the Maosuwu? Nothing worth mentioning. I can prove that. About ten years ago, Qiao made a donation of 200,000 to the school. No dig deal. He said he could grow apple trees in sand. Now the dunes are covered by orchards, with the most exuberant fruits and trees. That must be a wonderful sight to see. What don't we go have a look? We can't, because the show's about to start. It'd be quite a detour. Nonsense. It's just outside the sand area. It used to stretch from over there to right here, with fruit trees yea tall. It just so happened that last year they had them all dug up. Mainly because the fruit turned out to be of poor quality. Sis, if you have the time, I'll take you to the new plantation, which is absolutely magnificent. Why are you staring at me like that? I'm telling you the truth. Over that ridge ahead is our school. Stop the car. What's wrong, sis? Is that the path leading to the hilltop? Sister, say, you make a hole with each step. It's like planting seedlings with high heels. Slow down, sis. Boss, try to stay under the umbrella. All that skin whitening is going to waste. Slow down, please. You walk surprisingly fast, sis. Are we there yet? We are. Madam Gao is buried under the tree. See? The new school. Look how great it is. Too bad the old lady didn't get to see it. I've come home to see you. You told each one of us Learn something useful. Make this a better place. Now that I'm back. I did learn something useful. But you're not around anymore. Am I a good student or what? These past few years I kept dreaming of you. I dreamt that you lost me. Coming through, watch out. Why are you holding a big vase? It's my gift for the school. I had it custom-made. In honor of the 40th anniversary of Shaligou Central School, let the show begin now. Go. The man I want to become is someone I've never met. He talks big. Always bragging. Many think of him as a liar. But he was an orphan. He was just 18 months old when he got acute typhus fever and was abandoned on a mountain trail. Madam Gao, our old principal, took him in. Later, he made a fortune selling fruit. He donated lots of money to build us a new school. Mr. Han said back then the sand storms were so bad that everyone was driven away. And that on Madam Gao's dying bed she said the one thing she couldn't let go was the kids. So, Mr. Qiao told our parents to quit their jobs in the city and come back. He also said that he had this new technology that would make everybody rich. To maintain the moisture you must wrap it up to here. Got it? Yeah. He lived a simple life for he put all his money in the project. And he said if they could improve the quality of the apple, they'd make a lot of money in the future. But little did he know Why are you crying when you get paid no matter what? Worst comes worst, we'll just reclaim the land and develop a new breed. Don't worry about the cost, I'm a billionaire. More and more people came to help with afforestation, as well as education and building the new school. Our school got bigger and bigger while the sand storms got smaller and smaller. This year, the sandy apple is finally a success. My dad said as long as they can sell apples, he'll be able to pay off all the debts. Mr. Han said everyone can be changed by someone else but only a few can truly have an impact on others. That is the man I want to become. Qiao Shulin of Shaligou. Qiao Shulin is my buddy. We've been best friends forever. Shulin. We're here, Shulin. Fluffy. Fluffy. Fluffy. The kids wanted it to be a surprise. It kills me having to hide it from you all the way here. Brother Qiao, on behalf of myself, my students, and everyone in the village, thank you. For god's sake, stop crying. Thank you. Shulin, here. Let's take a selfie together. Sure. Jessica, we're staying tomorrow, got some live-streaming promotion to do. With one new product. I know. The sandy apple. The sun hanging above sand dunes Shines ever brightly Upon sand slopes underneath the sky Holes are being dug Hey-yo hey-ah hey-yo Holes are being dug One sapling after another Are planted in the holes As they look up to gaze upon the sky And they look up to gaze upon the sky I now live in Hainan, some 1240 kilometers from Guiyang, my hometown. I'm about 300 kilometers away from home. Over 10,000 kilometers. In a way I've never really left. 2446 kilometers. I can only go back during the Chinese New Year holidays. I'm an artist, studying at Repin Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, Russia. The distance from my hometown, Xihulu Village, Ximilu Town, Xiqin County, Xihong City, is 6,240 kilometers. Sweetheart, would you just calm down? Be the master of your emotions. Not the other way around. Can you be more rational? You're such a scene maker. Go ahead. I don't care. You need to trust me. I can fix it myself. This would look really bad for me. Please, I'm begging you. Please. Please. -- Hi, Mr. Ma. -- Hi, Mr. Lee. -- Getting hot water? -- Yeah, for a foot bath. What a shame. People respect me here. Impulse is a demon. Don't ruin it. If you're getting in there, at least knock first. You've been rattling on and on. Do I really look that immature to you? Of course not. Ms. Qiu? Allow me to introduce. This is Ma Liang's wife, Chief Couch of our city wrestling team. Comrade Qiu Xia. Mr. Curator, there is something I want to ask you. My husband Ma Liang is being dispatched to help the poor in rural areas. Did you arrange that? You don't have to thank me for that. Send someone else. He can do nothing but paint. Comrade Qiu Xia. This can't be Ma Liang's real thought. When we first got involved in this poverty alleviation program, I asked Ma Liang about his opinions. And his exact words were ""I'd love to."" I think what he meant to say was ""I don't want to"". This is a serious task that shouldn't be joked about. We should have our eyes on the big picture. -- Right? -- Right! Ma Liang is preparing to into Repin Academy of Fine Arts in Russia. A phoenix can not lay in a chicken coop his whole life, can he? A man should have his own mind over his wife. She is your wife, not your mother. In your family, who rules? Go home. In my family, strength rules. Screenplay by Damo Peng, Fei Yan, Wenxiong Xing & Xiaoxian Sun Directed by Damo Peng & Fei Yan Letter of Admission from Repin Academy of Fine Arts of Russia to Ma Liang I got the sausages you sent to me. The whole family thinks that they taste better than Chinese sausages. That's for sure. The Russian recipe is so different. Honey, what is that you are painting? It doesn't look like the Russian painting I imagined. It has the style of production brigades back in the old days. I'm experimenting with different styles. You've been watching me for a while. -- Why don't you go downstairs for a walk? -- No. Be good. A pregnant woman should stay active, it helps the fetus develop. You develop first. I want to watch you having breakfast. I'm already over-developed. You're waking up my roommate. Go. Go take a walk. Wait. This Mendeleev guy, does he have a girlfriend? Why do you ask? I find him weird. The way he looks at me is so sneaky. Oh my. Can he understand what I'm saying? You're crazy. I'm warning you, Ma Liang. I heard that foreigners can be rather loose, especially you artists. Keep your distance from him, you hear me? What is this nonsense? I said I don't wanna come, and you made me to. Now that I'm here, you're being super paranoid. -- Then what? -- I go home. I just listen to you and go home. Alright. I'm gonna take a walk. Is your wife getting suspicious of us? It can't be. Pregnant women are just super sensitive. What if she finds out? If found out, we might be on Topics in Focus. Be quiet. Sweetheart, what again? Yeah. Do you receive the sweater I sent to you? Sweater. The sweater is in the reception office. I haven't gotten it yet. Then go and get it. I want to see if it fits. Why the rush? I'll show you tomorrow. You're not going to get it. If so, then I'll sit here all day. Okay. I'm hanging up. Shit! Hello Brother, You received the sweater from my wife. Right? Take a picture and send it to me. ASAP. Quick! What takes you so long? Oh my, honey. You're such a deft knitter. It's beautiful. Even Mendeleev likes it. Russian Very good. Russian Thank you, my good friend. I'm the hot one now. Stay still. Let me look at it. Did I knit it too small or you've gained weight? It looks so tight. I indeed put on some weight. But tight is good. I can wear a jacket over it. -- That'll be cool. -- Well, the cuffs look so weird. It's a sweater, don't worry. It will become loose over time. Nah. Turn around. -- I want to see the back. -- There is nothing different. It's basically the same, back and front. Just turn around. It's the same. See? Stop messing around. -- It's the same. -- Ma Liang! It does fit. You see it? Ma Liang. Shitty network, get stuck again. What a crappy connection in Russia. That's it. I'm taking a walk now. Try to lose some weight. She hang up. -- I burned my chest. -- Are you alright? Chief, you've sacrificed so much. You owe me no apology, we're in the same boat. -- Go get changed. -- Okay. -- Oh my. -- Such a pickle I dragged you into. It's not a big deal. You're not removing the makeup. Nah. In case of your wife calls by surprise. Double-fold eyelids are tricky to make. My trouble of a wife. Sit tight. -- What happened to your motorbike? -- The clutch cable fell loose. -- Use mine if you're in a hurry. -- It's okay, Mr. Secretary. Please go about your work. Get to the side when cars drive by. Don't play on the road. Mr. Secretary, going to work? Yeah, Uncle Qi. The paddy field tableau is our tourist attraction to the tourists. You have to put lots of work and heart into your lot. -- Follow the exact design when planting. -- Got it. You're not only a farmer now, but also an artist. Well I don't have your talent. -- Mr. Secretary. -- Yes, Auntie Li? I heard you and your wife are in crisis. When are you going to get divorced? A niece of mine is recently divorced. What are you babbling about? Have some compassion for others, would you? His wife is pregnant. Brother, I need two cases of soda. Help yourself. You two are finally back home. You are the unique pride of our village. Remember to help your family with the chores. Mr. Secretary, we're accustomed to the depravity of afternoon tea in the city, We might need a few more days to acclimate. They give away tea to bricklayers? You spend your days slacking, and what's that haircut? So trashy and indecent. Pot calling the kettle black. I scan to pay the soda, brother. Cut it out. Go about your business. Go. Can't we just do business the proper way? It's a disgrace if I take your money. Just go. Get out. Out! -- Do you want me to come back or not? -- I don't care. Stop scanning. Oh god! Mr. Secretary! Are you alright, Mr. Secretary? Brother, is this really necessary? You... Is this really necessary? You overpaid. Come back! It's settled. Russian Nice to meet you. Mamma Mia, that's a lot of trills. Say it again. Russian So nice to meet you. Russian So nice to meet you. Folks, take a break from your work. Have some soda, Mr. Secretary's treat. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Hi, Mr. Secretary. What is this all about? This hour your wife will most likely call you. So we all volunteer to help you fool your wife. Yes. It seems everyone knows about my family matter. In the countryside, even the walls have ears. So I went ahead and told them in advance. I've heard so many times the touching story of Ms. Qiu rescuing your husband by wrestling with the curator. Now I finally get to admire the work of Mr. Ma and the talent overflowed from it. An unspeakable sensation seizes me. I find this piece particularly brilliant. With minimal composition, it conveys such a profound meaning. It's a plastic film. I just bought this new frame online. Russian Good afternoon. Where are you? I'm painting outdoors. Meng Meng and her boyfriend are here. Her boyfriend, Chang Mao. Remember him? Hi, Mr. Ma. Of course I remember him. The photographer who specializes in animals. One of your works won a prize in our cultural center. -- What's the name of that piece? -- Melancholy Donkey. Melancholy Donkey, yes. Chang Mao offered to take some pregnancy photos for me. Well isn't that a treat. He won a prize taking photos of donkeys. -- With you, it'll be much easier. -- That's for sure. Come closer and look. The suburbs of Russia is much nicer than ours. It really is. Of course. They've developed for so many years. Why does the signal tower have Chinese characters on it? That is the evidence of the mightiness of our country. Not only do we install base stations abroad, but also put Chinese Characters on them. Not minding that the foreigners can't read it. This is the confidence when we are strong. Oh my. What's that? The Russians have hair-loss issues. Russian Hair. What are you wearing? Why are you wearing the sweater underneath your shirt? It's not neat. Take it off and change it to the outside. Well, Ma Liang. Why is it stuck again? Ma Liang. Is it because my signal in the house? Probably because you two are too far apart. He is right under the signal tower, there is no way he has signal problem. Ma Liang. Ma Liang. Ma Liang. What kind of lousy signal is this? Over. Incoming call! Sweetheart. Take a look. Look at those baby hands. Young man, have you seen an art exhibition before? -- No. -- It's your lucky day then. Come on. It's my treat for you to see my husband's collection. -- I have things to do. -- It'll only take three minutes. Come on. Very good. Bye. Huixang Village Archway Completion Works Ceremony The turnover of my grocery store has doubled. I decided to open a branch in the east of the village. Mr. Secretary, the young people who had migrated to the big cities are now returning. The farms are no longer short of hands. Mr. Secretary, we sold more than 100 kilos of homemade sausages this week. -- I will bring some to you. -- Well, I...it's my wife. Shush. Hello? Honey, you 're still in bed. Check out my makeup. I'm about to get my pregnancy photos taken. Who is this? So attractive. Is she my wife? You're so annoying. So full of it. Don't wear anything revealing. It might affect the baby. Rest assured, Mr. Artist. We'll take good care of your wife. Good. Where are you now? Don't wander too far. Not very far from our home, there is a new tourist resort. Let me show you. You see, it's quite popular. It is. Okay, you take care. I'm getting up. Meeting dismissed. Keep Our Mission Firmly In Mind It's really good. They sell everything here. I want that one. No, too many additives. -- Barbeque. -- Barbeque, in your situation? You're such a bummer. Ice cream. I'll get some. Hi, kids. Was she my lover from a previous life? Mr. Chief, ice cream for you. -- I really shouldn't take it. -- Thank you. What are you doing? So reckless. -- What? -- It's me. Ma. It's bad. My wife is here. -- Where? -- See? -- Those three. -- Yeah. No wonder she looks so familiar. Guard the viewing deck. Don't let them see the paddy field tableau. My wife has seen my sketches. -- Okay. -- Let me think. Careful, careful. Popcorn alert! I've got an idea. Let's do a petal throwing set. We shouldn't pick flowers. No, we won't. I prepare it beforehand. Throwing rose petals in a sunflower field? That's dumb. It'll look like we're spitting blood. It will look very pretty. Cut it out. Go away. Cut it out. Go away. Cut it out. Go away. Go away. Go away. Quick. Go away. Quick. Go play over there. Brother Goose, could you help us take some photos? Don't be shy. It won't take long. Come on. Your costume is mad cute. Come on. This way. Come. Now I got a new idea, Let's do an animal set. Wow, the big goose So cute. Hello. Look, he's being shy. Let's take a couple of photos. I will just stand here. Okay. Beautiful. Good. Another pose. Another one.This time, not shy, just happy. Yeah Make a heart sign. Good. This is a good one. Now, hold. The lighting is amazing as well. I'm holding him. That's really good. Brother Goose. Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye. Turn around. You are unparalleled. Sit down and have some rest, Xia. Thank you, Goose. Thank you for the food. Here. Take a sip of this. How much is it? Give him the money. The level of service in this village is unparalleled. Xia, let's go back. You can't exhaust yourself. -- Yeah. -- I'm fine. It's just low blood sugar. I'll be fine after I eat something. Thank you. Come. It's too hot, take off your head wear and have some water. You're such a devoted mascot. You guys have made this place really nice. Meng Meng, hand me the phone. I want to call my husband. Why is it so dark on your side? Sweetheart, I keep the light off. I don't want to wake up my roommates. What time is it? There should be daylight already. Daylight is short over here. Let me tell you something really weird. The place I am taking pictures today looks exactly the same as the place you do outdoor paintings in Russia. I'm not kidding. Look. Same, right? No, Not a little. Look harder. Don't they look alike? Even the signal towers are exactly the same. Honey, I suddenly feel that you're very close to me, like right by my side. Sweetheart, you miss me so much that you're having an illusion. Sweetheart, I just had a bad dream. Guess what? I dreamt that you fell from a high place. So today, high places like rooftop, water tower and viewing deck are off limits. You hear me? -- Especially viewing decks. -- I'm pregnant. What high places do you expect me to climb? Alright. I'm hanging up. There is a viewing deck. Let's go see the paddy field tableau. What's wrong? You forget to bring toilet paper? (Pregnant woman, long hair photographer, as well as accompanies are now allowed) Damn. This is specific. We're completely ruled out. The 'as well as' must be referring to me. Why aren't pregnant women allowed? Up there has been freshly painted. Formaldehyde is above the maximum level. Photographers? The paddy field tableau involves business secrets. Professional photographers are not allowed to access for the moment. What about the long hair? According to international conventions, photographers with long hair tend to be more professional. And the 'as well as', how did you predict that? Aren't you traveling together? -- Yeah. -- Then that's it. A country has its laws and a village has its rules. After your baby is born. After you cut your hair, and after you grow up, I will welcome you with gongs and drums, guiding you through every corner of this village. Now, go home. Did we offend anyone? This is going too far. As an apology we offer some local products for the three of you. After all, there aren't many tourist groups that meet all the criteria. Congratulations. This village has a fair amount of rules. But I do appreciate the way they handle complaints. I love my dancing hair. Honey, look, the photos I took today. Are they beautiful? This sausage is really tasty. Xia, try it. The sausage from that village is so yummy. This sausage tastes the same as the ones sent by Ma Liang from Russia. It does? It's from the guy in the village. Turn around. We haven't left anything behind. What happened? Say something? Isn't that Mr. Ma? Xia. Thank God, I was cool at the time. With a few boxes of local products, I sent them away. Wow! In order to deal with this tigress, I spent so much time practicing trilling words with Mr. Secretary. Do you know how to say Tigress in Russian? Russian Tigress Teacup. Russian Teacup Nice to meet you. Russian Nice to meet you If you are meeting people for the first time, then you -- No tipping off! Freeze! You move, you get a photo. Calabash Dolls. Who's that? Outrageous. Give the toilet paper back. Where are you? We are here. I'm here. Qiu Xia, there is something that I have been hiding from you. I meant to confess to you after our baby's birth. You know I grew up in a small village where I believe is the most beautiful place in the world. But now, many villages are getting old, all the young people have left, and I've been thinking what can I do for this? So, So what? Ma Liang, you got new skills. You led the whole village to fool me. Please forgive him. Please. You gave up Repin for this. I thought the first secretary must be having a good time. But I heard that you don't even have time for proper meals. You're not making much money. And you give your wage together with the allowance I sent you to the old widows and young widows in the village. And widowers too. No. Don't beat him. I've been bragging to everyone I met, telling them that my husband got accepted by Repin. The only one in Northeast China. My parents used to say that you were unaccomplished. Now they all call you a late bloomer. But now, I'm sorry. But now, I will ask my parents and all my friends to come here and see it for themselves. I'm going to tell them proudly that my husband got admitted by Repin but he chose not to go. Because he chose a much nobler cause. To satisfy the needs of the people Hui people, and people of all ethnic groups across the country... Enough, Honey. This is a viewing deck, not a rostrum. Sweetheart you are the greatest artist in the world. I wish the best for my hometown and a good life for everyone there. I hope my hometown would soon get rid of poverty. And become a glamorous metropolis. Our beef meatballs would take the world by storm. I want them to be sweet. I heart Xinjiang. Mom,dad,you guys don't have to worry about me. I'm a grownup now. I've always wanted to go to the Nadam Fair. Now I'm at the Nadam Fair everyday. Hopefully, we don't have to leave our home for big cities. And small towns could also have a better future and soon. I wish my mom back home would enjoy her life every day, waiting for me to return., That's the cleanup crew up on the track, and that's a lot of racers involved there, folks. Jack, you realize you got this in the bag, right? Season's wrapped up, man. Doesn't matter where you place. I'm telling you, I got intermittent miss. - Last two laps. - On it! Get those plug wires! Jakob! Now. Hey, Pop. Tell me what you see, Dom. Got an oil spill going into turn two. Bell's driving safe. Corbin's got a sponsor in the stands, so he's pushing it. Talking about me? You got a real problem with car 23. - Linder. - About to whip your ass, Toretto! - Settle down, pretty boy! - That's right. - Shut up! - Yeah, you. You want to tell your driver - he's gonna get somebody hurt? - What'd you say? - Hey! Leave it! - Go home! You suck! He's just pissed I got that spot in the Busch Series next season, not him. Life's got no shortage of guys like Kenny Linder. You're good! It's not about being the stronger man, Dom. It's about being the bigger one. I swear to God, this guy. Pop, turn two, turn two! Got it. I'm walking him in. Shit! Tell me what you see, Dom. He's gonna come at you for that. Get ready on your left. Three-eighths ratchet. Three-eighths driver. Six-inch extension. Are you sure? Remember what your daddy told you. Be precise in life. It can make all the difference. Now, watch this. - See how it's working now? - Mm-hmm. And you see what's happening? It's turning the screw. You're right. Water heater's out again. It's the price we pay for peace and quiet. Want to come and give us a hand? Are you expecting someone? Brian, remember what we practiced. Yo, yo! We come in peace. We come in peace! It's me! Roman? Maybe you don't recognize me 'cause I've been tanning all week, bro. B, come out, son. What you gonna do with that thing, man? What, you out here trying to kill elephants or something? We would've called first. Except you actually need phones in order to get phone calls. You know that, right? - Little B! - Wow, you're so big. - Hi. - Wow. - Hi. Now, I know you don't carpool. So what's up? Mayday! Mayday! My plane is under attack by a rogue agent! We're being boarded. I've got dangerous cargo on board. I need you to assemble the team. ...still alive. I'll explain... It's an SOS transmission from Mr. Nobody's plane. It came through with a mess of encrypted data, most of which I'm still trying to crack. - Did anybody else get this? - Well, that's the thing. He sent it only to us. Why just us? He caught Cipher. But there was a midair attack, and she was extracted. It seems his plane crashed somewhere here, over the northwest region of Montequinto. If Mr. Nobody survived, we need to find him. But the whole area's sealed off. Isolationist, run by military. We're not on call anymore. Wait, wait. Dom, this is Cipher. The woman who killed the mother of your child. Things change. Listen, we're wheels up at 8:00 a.m., if you change your mind. Thank you. Daddy, do you know where God is? - Where is God? - In your heart. He's in your heart, too. And you know something? I'll always be in your heart. Hey, little guy. I have a gift for you. Your father gave this to me. And now I'm gonna give it to you. It's very special. Take care of it. Good night. This isn't who we are. Brian and Mia got out of the game when they became parents. We're not them. ...under attack by a rogue agent! We're being boarded. I've got dangerous cargo on board. ...assemble the team. ...still alive. I'll explain... ...alive. I'll explain... Coming up on the signal, two miles. It's deep in the militarized zone of Montequinto. - I hope everyone's ready. - Ready? Y'all want to make jokes about me not making practical decisions? This is as prepared as it gets. We all see you, man. Nobody thinks you're compensating for anything. - I'll take point. - Careful. Careful's when you get hurt. Right now, we have a ten-minute window between patrols. Mr. Nobody's signal is close, but we've got to move quickly, guys. We do not want to cross paths with the military here. - It's inside. - Cover us. The source of the SOS signal is coming from inside this thing. Somebody wanted in. Plane must have gone down before they could cut through. Or it was sent down on purpose to stop 'em. Yeah, well, their mistake was trying to cut into it. But just give me a minute. I can get in. Dom. There's not a soul in sight. No sign of Mr. Nobody. Got it. What the hell is this? Whatever it is, Mr. Nobody wanted us to find it. How's that work... Go! What?! You don't know who I am?! You think I'm scared?! Roman, where the hell are you?! Who's compensating now, Tej?! ""Peligro minas."" What does that mean? Tej, how fast we got to go to clear 'em? Please don't tell me you're thinking - what I think you're thinking. - Why? What does ""peligro minas"" mean? - Tej, how fast? - I don't know, man. Somebody answer me! What does ""peligro minas"" mean? ""Peligro minas"" means - ""danger, land mines""! - What?! How fast, Tej? Assuming a 50-foot blast radius and a-a half a second trigger delay, I'd say about 80. I can't! My speedometer only goes up to 70. - What do I do?! - You put your foot to that floor, and you pray! Get to that palm plantation, and then we're clear. Whoa! Whoa! Roman, you good? My ass is en fuego! Tej! Wait! Land mine! How in the hell are you not dead? Wait, okay, I think I found us another way out. Two miles to what looks like a bridge across the border. Good. The sooner we get out of here, the better. Letty, on the right. The device. Get in. That was Jakob back there, wasn't it? Always check your mirrors, bitches! Oh, hell no. Are we supposed to drive across that? Well, I said it looked like a bridge. Oh, my God! The military's not giving up. We got to get past the border. Where's the bridge? No. No, no. Dom. Well, that was new. Look, we're in the clear. But this thing is a mess. The headlines out there? Secret spy plane crashes in a hostile country? Followed by some kind of covert ops firefight? I'll get you where you need... and then I'm gonna need to back off. I appreciate the favor. I got to stop doing so many favors. What we doing, Ramsey? Like, where are we going? I-I was able to decrypt the data that came through with Mr. Nobody's SOS, and I found GPS coordinates, definitely included on purpose. You knew about Jakob? Question: Who is Jakob? Jakob is... or was Dom's brother. Oh, my-my bad. I'm sorry. I'm just processing. Brother? You got a brother? Who also happens to be some kind of super spy with his own private army, who drives literally like a bat out of hell, who preplanned an aerial jump and landed at the bottom of an airplane? Who does that? Who does that? A Toretto. That's my dad! That's my dad! He's gone! He's gone! We got to get him out of there. We got to get him out of there! That's my dad! That's my dad! That's my dad! That's my dad! Get him out of there! That's my dad! There's a couple of release forms we've got to sign. Few clearances. Everything else is down there around the corner. Hey. Nobody's supposed to be around here. You Toretto's other son? You're the useless one, right? What is that? Get out of here. Go. So a man can't pay his last respects? That's what that is? No. No, not you. You're the one that killed him. No, racing killed him. Look, he knew that I was gonna pit him into the wall. He knew that. Now, I don't know if he dropped gear. I don't know. I swear... I swear to God, - if you don't get out of here... - What? What? Go find Buddy. Now! All right, well, now we got the golden boy. Leave. You here to make threats, too? ""Leave"" is a simple word. Man, what is it with you Torettos where you're all the heroes in your own stories? Look, I'm gonna tell you a secret. You, your dad, me... we're all stuck, going round and round in the same shitty circle. And we ain't never getting out. You ain't half the man my dad was. - At least I'm alive, asshole. - What did you say? Get off me! Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom, no! Dom! No, man! In here. Jakob. I simply cannot believe that magnet trick actually worked. It looked so damn cool. Look at this here. I got this off the cockpit feed. Oh, I love being rich. It was sloppy. He almost had me. - She say anything? - Nope. Nada. You know, I look at her and I feel creeped out. And sort of turned on at the same time. Is that weird? Nice operation. You snatched me off Mr. Nobody's plane midair without a scratch, and you took him down. Money well spent. - Do you know who I am? - I know who you are. Do you? East L.A. is a tough enough place to grow up. But it was your brother's shadow that turned you into this. Isn't it? So your whole life, you pushed yourself to be faster than Dom. Smarter than Dom. Stronger than Dom. Tell me, do you hate him enough that it keeps you up at night? Still? All these years later? I should've just hired you instead of coercing your brother a couple of years back. I don't work for the competition. That's cute. You thinking you're the competition. Says the woman in the box. Look familiar? The other half's hidden in one of the agency's thousands of vaults. I need you to find out which one. We secured the master drive here from Mr. Nobody's plane. The rest of the hardware is a bit dated. Pre-Internet. To make sure you don't go hack into anything we don't want you to. Say you get what you're after. A weapon so dangerous it shouldn't exist for another half century. What would you do with it? Launch some global attack? Sell it to the highest bidder? Or maybe you see yourself as a necessary shock to the system. I bet all you ever wanted was a hug. You read my psych eval. Good for you. I read your second-grade report card. That's what I do. Your chin... it's distinctive. I know the Torettos have quite the mixed bloodlines, but I never detected a Nordic strain. Finding the two halves of Project Aries is the easy part. Add in your brother Dom to the mix? You don't have a chance. Plans are in motion. Qasar Khan. What? Genghis Khan's little brother. Nobody's heard of him either. Talk about off the grid. I don't think they had grids when this place was built. If a Ninja Turtle pop out on me, tell you right now, I'm out. No way this place was sanctioned by the agency. This was definitely Mr. Nobody's secret hideout. What now, Dom? Whoever Jakob has become... ...and whatever he's up to... ...it's on me. And me alone. Nah. Whatever's on you, it's on us. Let's get to work. Y'all ever thought about how many wild missions we been on? How we somehow... - always survive? - Yeah. - So far, so good, I guess. - It's just luck. No, no, no, see, y'all not listening. Think about this. We've now been on insane missions around the world, doing what most would say is damn near impossible. And I ain't got one single scar to show for it? I mean, look at my jacket. Those are bullet holes from 14 dudes trying to take my head clean off its shoulders. We've taken out cars, trains, tanks. I'm not gonna even mention the submarine. And yet we're still here. Exactly. Ramsey, what happens when you test a theory over and over again only to come to the same result? A hypothesis becomes fact. But you're not actually suggesting that... I don't know, but when the improbable happens again and again, that's more than luck. Maybe we're not so normal. That's what I'm saying. We are not normal. Okay, um... just to clarify, are you two maybe suggesting that we're what, invincible? - Maybe. - Maybe. Or maybe... you're just a dumbass. Take your dumbass jacket with you, man. Pretty impressive driving out there. You miss the old life. Do you? Every day. Guys. We got a little company. Think you know this person. - It's so good to see you. - I missed you. Thank you. Of course. You should've told me. She deserved to know. Jakob's my brother, too. I need to be here. You get involved here, you put everything you have at risk. Your kids and the whole world that you built. We're all risking something. Dom, listen to me. My kids and yours are in the safest hands possible. With Brian. Our world's grown, Dom. I got this one. The firewall on this old thing is actually pretty good. But, you know, port scan, UDP message peek, pop to root shell, and... ...say hello to Project Aries. What is it? It's what we got from Mr. Nobody's plane. Or at least part of it. Aries was designed to override and assimilate anything that runs on code. Any computer anywhere. If it operates on zeros and ones, it's vulnerable. If you take Aries and upload it to a satellite, it'll spread like a virus. Then it'll be a matter of time before someone can control any weapon system... traditional, nuclear, stuff we haven't even seen yet... and just point it wherever they want. Jakob reboots the world order within minutes. Ares is the god of war, right? If Jakob gets his hands on this, he'll be the god of damn near everything. Because of how dangerous it was, the Aries prototype was recovered and split into two halves by Mr. Nobody. Both of which are worthless without the activation key. Jakob now has one of the pieces. He'll be going after the other half next. As for the key, it's... it's vanished. So we find it. If we're gonna beat Jakob to it, we're gonna have to split up. Roman, Tej, I know a couple of guys operating out of Germany that could get us anything we need. I'm on it. Wait, there's one more thing. Mr. Nobody's transmission had one name connected to the key. You guys are gonna want to brace yourselves for this. No way. That's exactly what I said. So you're saying Han's death is connected to all of this? He has to have something to do with it. I'll look into it. Tej, can you send me - all the files you have on Han? - Yeah. I'll go with you. Letty. I got this the day Han died. Mexico. Check the postmark. Whatever he was up to, it ended here. Tokyo. What are you gonna do about Jakob? I'm gonna find him. How? An old friend. Yo, what do you think? Es una ilusin o es real? It doesn't matter. It's all about how you choose to see it. Shit. I told you I was right. - I'm Leo. - Santos. Dom. What are you guys in for? Driving while brown. You see that? Hairline crack in the fuel line. Air gets in there, you got a lean condition. Lean condition? Yeah! Yeah, Jakob! That's what I'm talking about! Who wants next? I said, who wants next?! I got next. Dom. Well, when'd you get out, man? I said I got next. Come on, Dom. You don't want to race me in Buddy's old Charger. Car don't make the driver. Here's how this goes. You win... you can come back home. You lose... you keep driving, you don't stop, you don't ever come back. Ever. What do you mean, Dom? I know what you did. The day we lost him, Dad kept talking about a misfire. Remember? You were the last one under his hood that day. A minute later, he was gone. Tell me why you killed Dad. Now let's race. Armed robbery in Echo Park. - Fourth Street Bridge is open. - Clear, clear, clear! Ready? Set. Go. Too soon. No! ...and beating the shortstop. Line drive over the head of Gonzalez on the field for a base hit. Up next... Place still looks the same. Just like your dad left it. I'm looking for Jakob. Can't help you, man. I know you took Jakob in after my father died. The worst thing you can do to a Toretto is take away their family. That's what you did to Jakob. You've got people who love you, count on you, care for you. He ain't got no one. You get in his way, this ain't gonna end until one of you guys are in the ground. I know you did the best you could, Buddy. But we both know he's about to cause a lot of hurt. I did my best to take care of Jakob. But I'm no Jack Toretto. You've got to make peace with the past if you... ...if you want hope for the future. He's in London. That's all I know. Dom. I hope you find your peace. The chance for peace died that day on the track. Arigato. This place is a dead end. Do you think Jakob could be onto the Han connection? If he has all the information we do, probably. I never told Dom... I stayed in touch with him for a while after what happened. He was over at Buddy's for about a year, and then... he was gone with a message not to follow. But after he disappeared, I was so desperate to find him that I would've... would've done anything. I even broke into a police archive, but I didn't find anything. You what? You were like 16. I did what I had to do. Yeah. How about you? How are you doing? It's a change of pace, huh? Just as I was remembering... ...who I was, everything changed. It slowed down. There's peace for me in the chaos. It's like I... I need to face the world head-on or something to feel alive. Seeing Little Brian hiding in a hole because we had unexpected company... ...that got to me. We never used to hide. Hey, Dom's my brother, but you will always be my sister. Funny how we all have secrets. What? You got to be kidding me. What is it? Remember what Han used to say about Tokyo? You mean how in all the old Westerns, cowboys would make a run for the border to get away from the law, how Tokyo was his... Mexico. No way. She's ready to roll. No. No! No, Sean! Tell me you are not modding the quick disconnect valve on the LOX line. Hey, man, chill out. All right? It's all good. - That tweak just saved us 0.4 seconds. - ""All good""? This isn't Top Gun, Maverick. You don't follow the rules here, you die. Hey, come on. That's a bit much. When you know what too much pressure in the LOX line can do, come talk to me. Till then, stay in your lane. Yo, you're lucky to even be in my lane. In case you forgot, I'm the one that figured out how to let us build rocket engines and get paid. This whole thing was my idea. So who are you gonna trust with your brilliant idea, this glorified mechanic... or a rocket scientist? Without me, you'd be working at Jiffy Lube. Guys, guys. Look, it's all good. Who cares about who did what? Kind of hard for you to do anything when you pee your pants every time you fly, Twinkie. Did I hear that right? You a runner and you afraid of flying? ""Twinkie""? So you must be Ding Dong and Snoball. - Right? - Yo, uh... I don't go by that name anymore. You went by that name ever? Like, ever? I... That's-that's-that's... - Hey! We're up. - Oh, good. Hey, fellas. Y'all seen ten-second cars? Well, say hello to the two-second car. Is that a Pontiac Fiero strapped to a rocket engine? Impressive, I know. No. No, that's not impressive. Eyes up! Here it comes! Let the race begin! Plane's taking off! Go, go, go, go! Yes! We did it! Uh... I'm confused. Y'all didn't actually beat the jet. It didn't explode. - Yeah, or melt. - Yeah. She's still in one piece. You mean ""pieces""? Hey, Jiffy Lube, next time, will you listen to me? Look, we heard y'all could get us some wheels. Preferably the kind that don't explode. Is that possible? Well, the Honda dealership's about 3,000 miles that way. Dominic Toretto sent us. Who's Dominic Toretto? Hmm. Nice necklace, Queenie. Diamonds and emeralds never looked so good. Dominic Toretto. The word on the street is you got locked up. Yeah, well, in and out, you know. When are they gonna learn? Some birds can't be caged. Are you looking for one of me sons? Not tonight. You do the driving, I'll cut you in for 15%. My thieving days are over. Mine ain't. You coming? I'm looking for someone. Would've shown up in town a little while ago. A lot of guys, a lot of resources. Oh, yeah, yeah, word did go round on a crew that just turned up, led by an American. Yeah, he bought some arms off a local seller. Rumor had it he was into something big up in Edinburgh. Local seller, huh? She wouldn't happen to be wearing a stolen necklace, - would she? - He paid well. What was I supposed to do? This geezer was about your height, actually. Similar features. Oh, bloody hell, he's not your cousin or something, is he? He's my brother. Get the hand brake for me, would you, darling? Glad I'm not the only one with a family full of eccentrics. He offered payment for something else. You. You know, nothing's more powerful than the love of family. But you turn that into anger and resentment, nothing's more dangerous. Dom? Don't get yourself killed, okay? You're my favorite American. This is your kind of party, isn't it, Dom? Beautiful women, best cars, best everything. You know, best security, too. I'm Otto. I'm your brother's partner. Well, fi-financier. But, you know, my dad, he's a dictator, so we're not talking regular people rich here. No, no, no, no, no. Everything you see here, I own. These girls, if you want to meet one of them, maybe two, maybe three, just let me know. They're on the payroll. I offer a bomb-ass dental plan, too. Huh? Where is Jakob? He's inside. The brother you're looking for... he's from an old life. - He's long gone. - All I see is the same scared little kid that killed our father. That's your mistake. The spy game... this is my world. So here's my offer. It's the same one you gave me. You leave. Now. You drive away, and you never come back. Ever. A deal? I showed you mercy! And I won't show it to you again. Toretto. Since my dad is head of state, it makes me a foreign dignitary and this place an embassy. Which means you just trespassed into my country and attempted murder. So, naturally, I called in a little favor with all my good friends from Interpol. You keep digging around in the past, Dom, you're not gonna like what you find. And here I thought my dad was a pain in the ass. But your family is a train wreck. Well, now that your brother's finally out of the game, it's time we go to Edinburgh. Get the second piece, maybe do a little sightseeing, huh? Any news on the key? Don't worry about it. Our men are closing in. One week from now, there won't be a superpower in the world can take a piss without our permission. One week from now, your dad will be asking you for an allowance. I'd like that. I'd like that. Whew. What's up? - Well done, Leysa. - Please. If it wasn't for you, I'd still be stealing gas in the D.R. So Queenie treating you right? Like a princesa. I'm her number-one pick, you know. Cara's little sister done good. Good? You saw my fine ass in that white dress. You see how I been rocking shit? All this crew, this is mine. Huh? I been around the world. Oh, I almost forgot. You might need this. Your boy Jakob biometrics are encoded to this gun. You'll have no trouble tracking him now. Hey, Letty. Yeah. Come look at this. What the hell? Han never mentioned a girl, not ever. Letty, Mia! Down, now! You okay? Welcome to Saint Giles' Cathedral of Edinburgh. The High Kirk has a history stretching back over 900 years. Renowned for its stained glass windows, you can see the intricate craftsmanship... We're a go. Ramsey, talk to me. What do we got? I pulled Jakob's biometric signature off the gun, and the algorithm I've run says Jakob's team is right on top of us. Anywhere between 80 and 100 meters. 80 meters? That's a lot around here. This whole area seems pretty packed in. So, we don't know where the secret vault facility Jakob is looking to hit is, now, do we? Wouldn't be a secret if we did. You know what? I'm starting to think your little English accent makes you sound smarter than you are. Man, can I point out that a good old-fashioned tracking chip would've put us within like six feet of this dude? But, nah, instead, we out here with biometrics and facial recognition imaging. Feels like we looking for Where's Waldo - in Harry Potter world. - Yeah, uh, strong argument there, Tej, but tracking chips follow the chip. Before we know it, we'd be chasing some expensive yet tacky jacket to the dry cleaner's. Biometrics, on the other hand, are impossible to... Wait. Guys, okay, we have a problem. Cameras are going down all around us, and my equipment is freaking out. What the hell, Jimmy? Security alert. Cameras are down. Damn. You see anything suspicious? Uh, where do I start? First of all, all of this looks a little spooky. I even seen these two ladies walking with George Washington wigs on their head from the 1700s. I feel like I'm in Transylvania or some damn where. Ramsey, we're looking everywhere. I just grew a new bunion. This is hopeless. What? - You see that? - See what? The ears. They got cauliflower ears. They fight for a living. - Don't worry about it. - Roman. Hey, man, I ordered a pair of Crocs three weeks ago, and I'm still waiting! Where are my shoes, man?! Man, we really need to work on your planning. Hey, Dom, you should get down to the cathedral. Dumbass here just attacked some delivery dudes 'cause he didn't like their ears. Wait, wait, wait. H-How much did you say you paid for that again? You know silver ain't magnetic, right? You know what? Sh... Just shut up. Just shut up. Ramsey, say we had a big electromagnet turned up right around here. Wouldn't that disrupt all electronic signals? Including security systems. That's it. That's how Jakob's getting into the vault. Guys? Guys? Okay, we've got police coming from all sides. - The area's locking down. - He ain't using roads. I got eyes on Jakob. I see Otto. I'm gonna tail him. He's heading towards a blue Jaguar. Okay, follow him. Me? I can't. Why not? Okay, this is a bad time to tell you this, but I don't drive. Okay? I never got my license. I don't know how to drive. And, you know, no one really drives in London. Okay? And that is not my contribution to this group. It's you or no one. Shit. Guys, come on, man. I feel like, between the six of us, we can work this out, right? Okay. I've got... Ramsey, shut it off! Shut it off! Go, go, go! Okay. Uh... Brake is on the left, accelerator right. Oh. Shit. Hey! Oh! Sorry! Whoa! Oh, no! Move! Hey, that was not my fault! Okay, that one was my fault. See? What'd I tell you? Not even a scratch. Otto, sending you new pickup location. I've got it. I'm headed to you now. Otto, where are you? Jakob, I'm there. I don't see anybody. It's because you're on the wrong street. That's my car, pal! Dom! Go! Damn it. You're a natural. Of course I am. Okay, listen up! I want 50 of the best men! I want guns! I want wheels, freaking X-wing fighters... I don't care! The Millennium Falcon, Chewbacca if you can get ahold of him. Money's no object. Go. Go! What? What's so funny? I... I was thinking, if this was a movie, this would be the moment where the villain has an unexpected setback, overcompensates without thinking it through and gets crushed by the good guys. No offense, but you have no idea what we're about to do. And for the record, we're the good guys. Me? I'm Luke freaking Skywalker. Are you sure about that? I mean, I get the daddy issues, but... Look at what you've built. Really? Luke? You're right. No, I'm more of a Han Solo. No. You're Yoda. - Yoda? - Mm-hmm. No. The little green guy? - Yeah. - No. Ah, shit, I'll take it. Because he's a powerful Jedi, right? No. Yoda's a puppet. With someone's hand up his ass. So what now, Dom? No one outruns their past. And yours just caught up to you. Man. There is literally zero industrial or weapons-grade electromagnets I can find that are this powerful. Look at the pull strength level here. - It's crazy. - Yeah. Wait, watch this. Every time. I can't believe it. What are you doing, bruh? I'm hungry. - Hey, guys. - Oh, damn. Surprise. Nice clubhouse. 'Sup, man? Nice to meet you. So you got my postcard, huh? I'm just still trying to figure out... How are you still alive? Well, after Gisele died... I didn't know what to do. I was aimless. - Lost. - Absolutely. But can you get to the part where the car exploded and you're still alive? - Like, I'm trying to... - Roman, can you... can you just be quiet for one minute? We made plans. We had dreams. So what's our next adventure after this? How about... we stay in one place? - Where you thinking? - Tokyo. We always talk about Tokyo. Tokyo it is. You know, it's funny, Gisele led me there, and I wasn't even looking for it. But it became home. Then one day, Mr. Nobody came calling. I worked with Gisele. Back when I was a CIA operative running the drug trade in Central America. The good old days. Gisele was my best. You can lose an asset at any time. Bullet, knife, wire. But I never thought I'd lose her... to love. What do you want? I'm offering you a job, Han. Here, in Tokyo. Why me? 'Cause I saw your work with Gisele. I saw that she trusted you. And that means I can trust you. And that is very rare in this line of work. And all I knew was that I had to steal some tech from the home of a scientist couple. But as usual... Mr. Nobody didn't tell me everything. In fact, he left out the most important part. I was 11. My parents would take me to the movies on Saturdays if I tried hard in school during the week. I was so excited to go I forgot my raincoat, so I went back in. At first, I didn't see it. By the time I looked out the window... Mom and Dad were gone. Turns out I wasn't the only one looking for this thing. Get down! Han saved me. Wouldn't leave me behind. He knew I'd always be a target, so he taught me how to survive. We became a family. ""Always be a target""? Why? 'Cause she is the key. Everybody's been looking for a thing. It was a person all along. My parents didn't want Project Aries to fall into the wrong hands, so they locked it with their own DNA, something we share. And then, one day, Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up that one of his best agents went rogue. So when Deckard Shaw came calling, we used it as cover. But you got killed in a car crash, Han. Mr. Nobody had a way of making things look real. Pretty nifty magic trick. Yeah, I've done better. Now for the hard part. Keeping you dead. My death... Became the best way to stay alive. - What's happening? - It's some kind of hidden subroutine the system follows. That's it, right there. Yeah, nobody moves... everybody lives. Jakob. I'm sorry, Mia. I was the rogue agent. Me. Dom, you ever think about how Mr. Nobody found you? Think he just dropped out of the sky and chose you? I ran missions with Mr. Nobody out of this place for years. I've been looking for that key for a long time, Dom. And you just handed her over. I told you. This is my world. Got it. Got a lot of guys here. You trust 'em? Trust this. You know the only good thing to come from Dad dying? If he hadn't, I'd have spent my entire life in your shadow. And now you're gonna spend the rest of yours living in mine. Only good thing about Dad dying... was he didn't have to watch what you became. You never deserved the Toretto name. You think you knew Dad, huh? What, 'cause you were his favorite? You don't know shit! Okay? You want the truth? Dad died 'cause he was trying to throw that race. We were in deep debt. 'Cause of how he felt about you, he had to ask me for help. How was I supposed to know that car was gonna blow? A good son would've said no. And a real brother would've come to me. Come to you? He made me promise you would never find out. And through all of it... ...I kept that promise. The girl comes with me. Jakob! I will stop you. And that's my promise. Hey! Sue. Sue. Ah. Come on. Come on. Down! Go! Go! Come on! This way! I'm always here. Tell him. No...! No! No! Dom. Tell me what you see, son. See, cars like this are immortal. '70 Chargers are designed so well that if you take care of 'em, they'll run for 100 years. Immortal? Just like a family, Dom. Build it right, you take care of it... ...it'll live beyond you. Daddy. Little B. When are you coming home? Com... No. You know I'm good for it. I promise I'll deliver. I'm telling you, I got intermittent miss. - Last two laps. - On it! Get those plug wires! Jakob! Now. You're good! No! You came to me, Letty. None of it is worth a thing if I lose you. Do you hear me? Is this who we are? Yeah. From here, things move quickly. Jakob has all the pieces he needs. Once he activates Aries, all he needs to do is send the signal global. And then there's no stopping him, ever. He'll have to launch some kind of pirate satellite, something that'll act as an amplifier, infecting other satellites in orbit one by one. So we find him, stop him, and then we get Elle back. Our odds are zero here, Han. Satellite equipment is easy enough to track, but we're not gonna beat Jakob to a launch. Which gives us a two-target problem: Jakob on the ground... With his own private army. - And the satellite. - Which can't be hacked. Not remotely. We'd have to do it physically, 50 miles above ground while the satellite is in orbit. Orbit? We need help. Otherwise, we have no chance. We do it ourselves. It's where we've been that got us this far. No. No, no, no, no, no. Do y'all not understand? Clearly, y'all don't. Because if you did, you'd be pissing your pants like a normal person. Orbit. That's outer space. That's another level. What we gonna do? Hijack a space shuttle? Put rockets on our backs? That's exactly what we're gonna do. What? There goes my father's diplomatic ties with Eastern Europe. This place is going to be crawling with every cop in the city. Time to get the hell out of here. Keep her close. It's activated. As soon as the satellite reaches orbit, we start the uplink. Ah, damn. What? You see that? We can't have an air leak, man. Are you really patching yourself up with duct tape? Yes. I don't know if you noticed or not, but this whole operation is Band-Aids and duct tape. Man, this is insane. We are headed to outer space. You acting like we on our way to Home Depot. This is ridiculous, man. I'm about to abort this whole mission and take my Black ass home. We're literally gonna be in a perpetual freefall. Freefall? What does that even mean? Roman, it means numbers don't lie. As long as we obey the laws of physics, then we'll be fine, okay? It's just all math and science. I knew I should've listened to my teachers. Four minutes to launch. You fellas good to go? Yeah, we just up here putting a bunch of duct tape on shit. You know, that's what Tej do. Man, please hurry up so I can stop hearing his damn mouth. - Yes, we're good to go. - We're not good. This is the same car that we watched do a test run and explode. - This is not smart, Tej. - Don't worry, man. With my ceramic polymer coating, you're gonna be just fine. You're 100% fireproof. Exactly. All eight thrusters fully functional. Hey, please don't tell me you're still running launch simulations. Virgin Galactic launched at 36,000 feet. The space shuttle tests around 50,000 feet. Our last test run with this load means we'll have to go higher... way higher! If we don't get them high enough, these guys are gonna be pancakes at IHOP before the coffee even gets to the table. Hey! We can still hear you! Don't worry, guys. We got this. We do got this, right? I've run thermal imaging. Elle's in the armory truck. And I've got a lock on the Aries signal. It's coming from the beast up ahead. We need to get in there to deactivate it by the time Roman and Tej are in position. Ramsey, power us up. Satellite is in low orbit. Begin. All right, we're passing 50,000 feet! Time to get ready, boys. What we supposed to be doing with these old-ass suits that ain't been used since World War I? Oh, I'm sorry. Astronauts ""R"" Us was closed for shopping today. Listen, these suits are just like space suits. They both account for pressure differential. Only thing is we may blow up like balloons just a little bit. - That's the only difference. - What? We just hit the launch altitude. - You guys ready for a five count? - No, man! I'm barely ready to go scuba diving in this old-ass thing. Don't listen to him. We ready! - ""We""? - Yes, I said ""we""! I thought you was invincible. Let's see how invincible your Black ass is after this. - Punch it! - No! Tej! Oh, my God! I don't want to die! Ignition! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're in outer space! Told you numbers don't lie. This is crazy, bro! Man, how much candy did you eat? Well, I-I... I eat candy when I get nervous. I thought you said you took care of this. Yeah. Hey. You take them back to the freaking junkyard right now! All right, Han, Mia, you're up! Now. Letty. Han! Not all of us. Now, the satellite we looking for should be somewhere... There. Right there. You see it? Got it. Tell me you know how to work the thrusters. Tej, numbers is what you do, right? Driving is what I do. Two dudes from the ghetto... outer space. You know ain't nobody gonna believe us, right? You're right. Something's wrong with the satellite array. It's, uh, interfering with the uplink. I'll handle it. Han? Grab the wheel. Something's up. I think I can link into their feed. - Something you want to tell me, Otto? - My bad. Satellite uplink is actually going splendid. Oh, and by the way, I have a new business partner. Maybe you know her. Guess who's out of the box, Jakob. But I did try to warn you. You were never my competition. - Otto, there's something you should know. - Yeah, go on. - Lay it on me, dude. - You're a spoiled rich prick, - and I'm gonna kill you. - Oh, man, I am so sorry. No one told you, huh? Spoiled rich pricks run the world. Come on. Come on! Go. - What's happening? - Uh, well, we appear to have lost our escort and Jakob. And, well, Dom is making things a little bit difficult here, but it's fine. Really, it's peachy. Don't worry, don't worry. I'll finish this myself. All right, let's see what that beast is made of. You ready, Elle? Crank it. If we can't break through, we stop it. Guys, that thing is not slowing down and the download's almost done. Dom, we don't get out of here now, we're dead. Letty, drop back and line up with the front tires. What? If we can't slow it and we can't punch through, we flip it and we hit the underside. Goddamn it! Why do I have to say this? Flatten these clowns! - Letty, the wires. - You read my mind. Han, get in front of me. Dom, I can't get to you. But I can. All right, the satellite is in range. Let's power up these magnets and fry it. All right, take our time. Okay. All right. - Tej! - Hold on. Come on, baby. Power up. Power up. Shit. - Shit, shit, shit. - What? Talk to me. What's going on? The pressure of the launch... it must have jammed the cables to the power source. Damn it, how did I not think of that? Guys, where are you? The upload is almost complete. Why don't you just kill it? Let's smash it. Let's run it over, right? No. If we crash into that satellite, we'll probably die. And even if we don't, the fuel that it would take to smash it... we'd be stuck out here forever. You got to have faith, bro. Faith? Faith is not numbers. You know what, Tej? You're probably right. We're not invincible. We probably just been lucky this whole time. This might be it. But you know what? If we're gonna go out... ...let's go out on top of the world. Guys, what's happening up there? We've got seconds left. Let's do it. Let's go. Five, four, three, two, one. We did it. We did it! Let's go. Yes! Shit. Not bad, man. Not bad at all. Hold on! Dom! Yes! Got to be kidding me. Shit! Think these belong to you. There's gonna be a lot of people coming after you, Jake. Yeah. This is the world I chose, Dom. You know, Dad wasn't perfect. And he loved us all the same. Someone once gave me a ten-second car... as a second chance. I owe you that, little brother. I lost you once. Don't let that happen again, okay? We come in peace! Hey! This was the last place I saw your grandfather. This is where he raced. Did you race here, too, Daddy? No. But I'll tell you something. Everything I needed to know about life, I learned on this track. You did? I did. It's all gonna be okay, Jakob. We got some rough times ahead... ...but it's gonna be okay. 'Cause we're family. - Fellas. - Hey. What? No way. What's going on? I couldn't believe it when I heard you were alive. It's a long story. But for now, let's just enjoy the moment, huh? Guys, this is Elle. Hey, Elle. I'm Sean. Just call me T. - I'm Earl. - Nice to meet you. Mia. Hi. Nice to finally meet you. - Hey, guys. - Mm. - Hey. How much longer on this food? Like, I'm-I'm... I'm ready to eat now. I've been eating space food for weeks. Oh. So Tootsie Rolls are space food? 'Cause that's all you ate. It was fat free, bruh. Snickers and Twix fat free, too? - My forehead hungry. - Yeah, okay. - I'll see you later. - Y-Your forehead is overweight. Oh! You drive just like your dad. - I do? - Mm-hmm. Do you know, this is... this is where I met your mom for the first time. Right there. She's watching over you from heaven. - She is? - Mm-hmm. I think Daddy has a question for you. You ready to say grace, kid? But I don't know what to say. Oh, it's easy. Just say whatever's in your heart. You ready? - Mm-hmm. - Come on. Hey, guys. Hey. Little Brian's ready to say grace with us. - Uh-huh. - Nice. Now, hold on. There's still an empty chair. He's on the way. Thank you. Please. I tell you where the drive is, the plans we stole. I tell you where it is. You mean this drive? These plans? But you already got it. Yes, mate. How else do you think I stay in this good of shape? Don't go anywhere. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, When I was 7 years old, the elders and I withessed the battle across the river. It was crowded with people, all looking at that building. My father told me, they are all heroes. They are protecting us. I didn't know what happened at the time. I only remember the fermented rice balls tasted good. Ever since then, my father would visit the warehouse every year to light a candle and leave a bowl of fermented rice balls. Now my father's gone, I still go by myself. I can never forget what he said, the people inside are protecting us, right? Hurry up! What are you waiting for? Up ahead is Shanghai! The city's fate depends on you! I'm telling you all now, you are the faces of the Hubei Security Corps. Look lively! Everyone move faster! Ignore those who are falling behind. Keep moving!

Then do you know how the Ming Dynasty collapsed? Take him under your wing. When I'm dead, you take my place. That side is so pretty. That side is the concession. Over there is heaven... Then here is hell. This used to be the warehouse for four banks. The walls are more than a meter thick, even cannons can't get through it. It's more solid than the gates of General Zhang's house. You served General Zhang? Yan and Feng, - I served them all! - It's very accurate, this is my lifeblood. Could you please give it back to me?

I used to sleep like a baby, I couldn't fell asleep last night. Isn't that weird? No way! The shelling has already stopped. I heard they retreated. If everyone retreated, then we'd all be safe! The Japs won't reach us here. It's good enough to just keep the business running. No need to fight over it! Just get in line and wait your turn. The senior officials asked us, the Youth Military Field Service, to distribute emergency supplies. Everyone has one portion! Everyone has a share. Don't fight. Keep in order. Victory! You, as a real man, doing nothing but watching everyday. What does it have to do with you anyway? If you dare, why don't you get enlisted to fight the Japanese? You wouldn't dare.

There are huge quantities of medical supplies and ammunition. Mr. Fang is here. Come in! The 524th Regiment of 88th Division is defending the warehouse now. The 88th Division? The so-called Hateful Zhabei Division. Yes. The division is equipped with German weapons. Please go on. For three months, the 524th Regiment increased troop strength on five occasions. Supplementary troops sourced mainly from Hubei, Hunan, and Zhejiang Security Corps. Currently there's no accurate information on the number of men and their weapons. Thank you for your hard work.

It's our periphery defence troops! Aim at the Japs, shoot! What's happening to these soldiers is what's coming to you all! Chinese troops, surrender your weapons. Otherwise, you will be just like them, dismembered, piece by piece. Duan Wu! Look after Xiao Hubei! Survive! And bring him home! As a NRA soldier, those unwilling to die on the battlefield should be punished. Japs are killing our brothers. I'm giving you all one last chance. Attention! Kill me now! Brother, I'm from the 1st Battalion of the Zhejiang Security Corps, Advisor for Internal Affairs. You can call me the 'Old Abacus'. It is my obligation to serve my country, but my job is just to do the accounts. I don't know how to use this thing. So commander, don't force me to... Force my ass! Do it! I don't know how to kill. He knows! He used to serve General Zhang. Don't bullshit me! I said, you! Come and kill me! Come on! The Zhejiang Security Corps are all dead.

Sir, I studied at a private school back in my hometown, I've never been out of the county. I just wanted to see what Shanghai was like. I didn't realize... I thought we are just here to clean up the battlefield. My mom is waiting for me at home. Please let me go. Xiao Hubei. Commander Yang. - Commander Shangguan is here. - Come down here. Shangguan Zhibiao and surgeon Tang Pinxin are here to report. Tell us about the outside. From Shanghai Rowe Restaurant, all the foreigners eat this. They say if you eat this you will grow up faster. Why don't you eat? It's for kids. Eat it. Eat up. Brother Qiyue, can you tell me why does the horse obey you? I don't know, But since I was a kid, I herded a big flock of sheep by myself. They all follow my orders. Kiddo! Don't play with fire! That's a gas tank, it can explode! Don't let the British soldier find us. Quick! Where are you going? I'm going for a scout. Go.

After a thorough scout, we discovered the Japanese's attempting a stealth attack. I... We... Were able to save our brothers from danger. He said he's going on a scout. For what? Where's the Sichuan soldier? He... It's breach to go out of the warehouse. You don't deserve to be a soldier! Hundreds of thousands of the Dongbei troop soldiers were scared off by 20 thousand of Japanese. You guys are still deserting? This is Shanghai. Nanjing is next. If our troops fled we let the Japanese take over Shanghai, then let the Japanese take over Nanjing? We've strengthened the sandbag wall. Block up the waterway. Close the gate. Yes, sir! Fortifications on the north side were destroyed by the Japanese, we're fixing it as we speak. Officer, the 5th Squad Sergeant from the 2nd Platoon just got killed. Their snipers are too sharp, we should wait until late night. You let the cadres repair the fortifications? Where are those deserters? Yes, sir! Check the gear. Get the sandbags in place. Repair the damaged fortifications. Come out! Don't move! Come out! We are students! We're here to join the army. They came in through the waterway. Watch over them. They are more valuable than us. Get down there and fix the fortification. We need to keep the frontline defence strong. Keep your head down when you are out there. Come back the same once you're finished. Don't come back, until the job is done. Strengthen fortifications! The Imperial Army is maintaining the maximum restraint. If Chinese troops drop their weapons, the Japanese army will give the most dignifiable treatment to them. The Imperial Army is maintaining the maximum restraint. If Chinese troops drop their weapons... Too dangerous. It's too close to the Japanese. They all aim well. When we were defending the Yunzaobang last month, all those killed were shot right here. Two of us should go out, finish the job cautiously. Leave the kid out of it. One of you two follow me. How about this, let's follow the NRA tradition. We draw lots.

My name is Wang Hu! From Taixing, Jiangsu province. Father, mother, I'm sorry. Bashu Chamber of Commerce. Shanghai Branch, Young Daozi. I've always been a fast runner. I would like to try! Daozi, be careful! He is going to get killed. Be careful! Don't get up! This is suicide! Don't come here! Get out and help! Provide cover fire! Don't get up! Stay covered! Don't move! Don't get up! Fuck you! Cover fire! Grab the phone line! I'm a teacher at Shanghai St. John University. We heard the heroes in the warehouse, have persevered in their defence of the city. I came here to offer help, I brought some food and medicines. This is Fang Xingwen, a journalist from Shanghai News. Colonel, Chairman is on the phone. Sir, it's Zhongmin. Thanks for your help. We were all watching your heroic acts. But, none of us had any idea about the difficulties you are facing. There's an urgent lack of morphine here, you have been holding the ground for three days now, every soldier has reached their limit. In reality, this kind of resistance will fail eventually. Every single soldier's life is precious. If you continue in this way, what's the point? The point? This is our homeland. Colonel Xie, how many soldiers do we have in the warehouse? So can I tell the journalists, that there are 800 heroes? What are you doing? Taking photos. To show the people on the outside, show the situation in here. What situation? Whatever the situation is, you rich people will just keep enjoying life as before. We are all concerned. The entire country is watching you. Concerned? Why aren't they coming over to help if they're concerned? Just sitting there watching? Just sitting there watching? Aside from taking photos as a pussy journalist, what else can you do? I want you to take my photo, can you? Journalist Fang! Has anybody seen journalist Fang? Journalist Fang! Having a miscarriage? You little sissy. What are you crying about? Brother, out of everyone in here, only you struck me as a smart one. If you can really make it out, send a message for me. Badaoligou in Andong city, mention Lao Tie, everyone will know. Tell my son, his dad was not scared of death. His dad lived only for him. Brother, tell me your real name! Brother! My name is Old Abacus. You need to relax, just relax. That picture, can you mail it to my family? Sure. Give me an address. Show me how it looks like first. I can't show you right now, if I open the back of the camera, the film will be ruined. When I get back I still need to develop the film and... What's your problem? Are you idiot? Got any cigarettes? Journalist Fang! Journalist Fang! Let's go. Coming. I knew I couldn't trust you. Fuck off! Fuck off! If you dare to escape, I'll kill you with one shot. Brother, want to go together? Brother. Brother, look at my hand. I can't even pull a trigger. I can't even hold a gun. What good am I here? If I stay, will it annihilate the Japanese? I'm just scared, I'm scared if I die, then that's it. Brother, brother! Brother! Brother, you have family? You got land, right? Are you married? They arranged a marriage for me back in my hometown. They told me, my wife is chubby and sweet. I haven't even seen her yet. All wars must eventually come to an end. People must keep on living no matter what. I only know calculating. I don't know how to fight. There must be someone fighting the Japanese. There must be someone defending here. I admire you all. You guys are hero. But, I... I don't... Brother... I'm begging you. I'm begging you, brother. Leave me a way out. I'm begging you. There's enough for everyone! Give me one! Why are you moping? Eat it up! Once your stomach is full, you won't miss home. What? Scared? Drink this, then you won't be scared. Cheers. I'm not scared. Bravo! The warehouse urgently needs sugar, salt, bread, and water! We kindly ask everyone to contribute! Every donation matters! Stand with our soldiers! Don't cry! Stop crying! What are you throwing that for? What are you doing here? - Money from a Russian whore is dirty. - Eva Li. My father is Chinese. She's hybrid, mixed blood. Enjoying the excitement? It's all fixed. Not bad, kid. We have it too, it's been over 400 years. They always perform the story of Guan Yu. Why did you pick Zhao Zilong? The story of Guan Yu is all about brotherhood. Zhao Zilong is different. He protects the country. Today, you were really going to jump? Everyone has their own fate. My family memorial tablet was prepared a long time ago. One, two, go! It's coming! Pick it up! Come on! Capture all of this! Sergeant! Journalist Fang, why are you still here? What are you recording? Taking photos. You're one of those people, who fights any battle just for the money. How are you not dead? I don't have wife or kids. I'm on my own. This money is all for my mother. You've never slept with a woman? Ever touched a woman's breast? What a pity! Tell me... what does it feel like? Give me a pack of cigarettes, and I'll tell you the feeling. Cigarettes! Cigarettes are my life. Blood? What does this say? I can't read. It's from the kid who jumped off the building. Words from the heart. The warehouse urgently needs sugar, salt, bread, and water! 6 o'clock! Colonel Xie has made an appeal! Let's go have some sweet rice balls! Sister Rong's donation. I'm hit! Xiao Hubei! Xiao Hubei! What are you shouting for? I've been hit! - I've been hit! - Let me see. - I've been hit! - Shut up! - I'm going to die! - Let me take a look. I've been shot! You're fine. It's just a graze. You're not dying. Keep alert! Done. Who's outside? A girl! Get her up. There's a sniper across from us. Thank you! Go report now! Report quickly! We are here. The red circle is Shanghai. If I die, who'd tell you that? Dumb little kid. You won't die. Here. Shame on you. She's just a girl, and she swam across the river. Last night, you, a big man, wanted to swim over there? This helps with the pain. Does it hurt? Brother, you are a hero now. Does she smell good? Colonel Xie! Attention! Brothers! Yes, sir! We have just received the order, the Brussels Conference is in session as scheduled. The government wants the entire world to know, that the Chinese troops haven't been defeated! The Generalissimo's office ordered us, to defend two more days at all costs. The longer we defend, the better chance we will gain support from the international community. - Is that understood? - Understood! First, let's thank this girl for her bravery. Attention! However, if we raise this flag, it will be a great provocation for the Japanese Army. They will stop at nothing to destroy us. They may even use heavy artillery. If that's the case, forget about two days. Holding out for even a few hours will be a struggle. What do you say? Colonel, our superiors' order is to defend for two more days. Shouldn't we postpone the flag-raising? Colonel, holding out two more days, If we give it everything we've got, we have a chance. But if we raise the flag tomorrow, we will be unable to complete this mission. In my opinion, compared to holding out two more days, raising the flag will better declare to the international community our attitude and our people's will! Raise the flag! Let's show these sons of bitches that we are still here! This is our home, why the fuck can't we raise our flag? Raise it! Only 2 more days to live anyway, let's do it! We will raise the flag tomorrow morning! If anyone wants to leave any last words to their family, let this lady deliver them for us. One at a time please. Girl, I can't read! Write one for me! Everyone listen up! In consideration of your valiance in battle. The Colonel suggests, formally incorporating you into the 524th Battalion, to form an independent squad, directly reporting to the division. He expects that you will all continue to fight bravely. Raising that flag is death. Isn't this asking us to die? Bullshit! Whoever doesn't want to be a part of this, dismiss yourself. Really? I'm still young. I'm leaving. I'm going back. I'm going home. I'm going back. Out of my way! I'm going back. Stop him! Get off me! Medic! Bandage him! Lock him up! Yes, sir! Is there anyone else who wants to leave? Let me know! You used to serve the 33rd Division? Originally the 36th Division. Commander Song's men never falter. You will be the squad leader. Tomorrow morning, you lead them to raise the flag. Can you handle it? Yes, sir! Attention! Colonel! Apart from the guards, scouts, and the injured, all 345 soldiers are here. At ease! At ease! The Colonel will speak! Brothers of the 88th Division. Over there, are observers from the Western nations. Behind me, are our own people. We are not just here to fight the Japanese, but to show them all, Chinese people are still here. Chinese soldiers are still standing! We soldiers have not retreated, not even one step. As long as we are here, They took over the Northeast and the North China. But now, because of you, Shanghai is still standing! Yes, sir! Dimond! Junior apprentice! Come here! For our fallen brothers. Fire! The Chinese nation will not perish! The Chinese nation will not perish! Long live the Chinese nation! The Chinese nation will not perish! The Chinese nation will be victorious! Long live Colonel Xie! Long live the Chinese nation! The Chinese nation shall be victorious! Colonel, there's incoming attack from the north. 1st Platoon, execute the plan! Protect the flag! Yes, sir! Move! Machine Gun Company! Deploy defence to the north! - Sergeant Yang! Protect the flag! - Yes, sir! Sergeant Yang! I'm staying. - Head to the turret! - Yes, sir! Enter the East building! Prepare for casualties. Dispatch soldiers to carry ammunition! Due South! 2000 metres, target in sight! Loading armor-piercing projectile! Six o'clock! Watch your altitude, look out for enemy fire. Aim at the flag. Get ready! Come on! Squad 4 Platoon 5, protect the flag! Others stand by! Medic! Tighten it! Hurry up! Remove the cartridge! Fast! The aircraft is coming! Run! Hurry! Go get them! 5th Squad 3rd Platoon, protect the flag! Others stand by! The barrel is going to burst! We're out of water, Sir! Medic! Help me! Die! I'm speaking to the Japanese military. You must retreat now! If you continue to proceed, we will consider it as an Act of War. I repeat! Retreat now! Brothers keep it up! Hold it up! Attention all soldiers! Obey orders! Don't make unnecessary sacrifices! No one attacks without my order! Act on my command! Rescue the injured! No one is allowed to attack without my order! Come and save them! Come and save them! 5th Squad go out and retrieve the injured. The rest standby. Quickly! Help them! Medic! Stretchers! Quickly! Help! Move faster! Save the injured! This is HQ, plane number 0917, the British have already raised objections. You'll see! 0917, return immediately. Medic! Move the injured away. They left! They left! They fled! Clear the battlefield! Watch the flagpole. Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Xiao Hubei. Don't be scared. I got you. Brother! Didn't we agree, - when we got to Shanghai... - Brother! We would take a ship to England... with our uncle, with my mom. I miss my mom. There, there... Xiao Hubei. Didn't we agree? Once we are in Shanghai, we'd take a photo together. Take a photo together. Come over here! Take a photo. Stretcher coming! Take a photo. Take a photo. Take a photo together. Take a photo together. They're singing for us. The NRA troops have been beaten in every fight. Today we finally restored some pride. Devoting oneself to one's country, is an honour. Thanks. The squad leader is here! Quiet! - Quiet! - Make yourself at home. Sit down everybody. Get seated. I've spent half of my life drifting around, fighting alongside the army. The lantern swaying in the wind and reflecting our broken shadow, I've put my sword in its sheath and taken off my armour, and placed them in the horse stable. Kiddo! Kiddo! What are you reading? A letter. An officer's letter to his wife. A love letter? Read it. To my dear wife Yuzhi, I'm heading to Luodian with my squad to support the troops as is our duty. Yet I can't help worrying about our families, my parents my young wife and my children. I can't help worrying. By being frugal, you will have adequate food and clothing. Out parents are frail, make sure to look after them. When our kids grow up, they shall join the army to avenge their father. To devote themselves to their country. There will be a day, when our flag, will fly on the peak of Mount Fuji. So that our descendants, won't suffer anymore humiliation. The restoration of the Han awaits the younger generation. An announcement from the Japanese infantry, of the 5th Brigade in Shanghai. Why is there a Japanese vehicle over there? What are they shouting about? It sounds like... The Japanese want to meet with our Colonel Xie. Colonel Xie is riding a white horse, there's Japanese man in front of him! Are they really retreating? I think the NRA won't surrender. I heard they are pulling out! That will be great. All of them can survive. No. No, it can't be. You women, how can you take about our heroes in that way? As if they are not worth a thing! Watch your mouth! Move out of the way! Alright everyone, shut up! There'll be trouble tonight. Help me! Give me a hand. Look! Flare! It's the Japanese! Flare! What are all the soldiers doing outside? I'm from the Japanese infantry of the 5th Brigade in Shanghai... They've come right to our doorstep. Colonel, just let me kill him. I'll go. Colonel! This could be an ambush. Commander Yang and Shangguan, if anything goes wrong, you two take over command. Colonel. Colonel, are you really going? Don't worry. He's riding a horse, you're just walking over. I'm Colonel Konoe Isao of the Japanese Infantry, 5th Brigade, 68th Regiment. NRA 88th Division, 524th Regiment, Colonel Xie Jinyuan. You are quite tenacious! For the past three months, you have been the most admirable opponent. I understand you have received order to retreat. I've also received order to use heavy artillery tomorrow. Thus, our battle will finally come to an end. Henceforth, people will no longer pay attention to this battle. That's none of my business. It is your business! After this, there will be a new commander filling in for me. I will become a failure. So, I'm not here representing the army. Go on. Tomorrow, we will have one last chance to battle. It is a battle of honour between you and me. This is also a fight between us two men. There are only a few hours left before the battle starts. Brothers! Get it together! This is our last fight. Right now you are laying your own graves! Carry those who die first over here. Kiddo, you don't even know my name. 88th Division, 524th Regiment, 1st Battalion, Qi Jiaming. Bottom up. Shangguan, their bodies are all they have. Nobody knows who is going to collect their bodies. According to our ancient tradition, before seeing the ancestors in heaven, they need to be washed. Boil some water from the river. Let them clean themselves. Commissioner, Colonel is having a migraine. He sent me down for you. Instruction from the Generalissimo. At midnight tonight, the defenders in Sihang warehouse, shall evacuate the warehouse to the British concession. Here is the order. October 30th, 1937. Zhongmin, cheers. Boil the water, put in the bucket. Got it! Commissioner, our determination to guard the warehouse has been passed onto the Chief by Zhang Boting. I believe our brave efforts can gain us international support at the conference. The Nine-Power Treaty conference has been postponed. Or one could say, preemptively aborted. The delegation has already found out the stance of each nation. The British and the US care more about their own interests. No one is willing to help us. Shangguan, it's the end. Just wash up! Our sacrifices couldn't have just been a show for the foreigners? We fought and failed for 3 months. The NRA stood for the nation and totally collapsed. People feel defeated, soldiers are afraid to fight. Commissioner, I believe this battle will reinvigorate the soldiers' morale and confidence. So what? The outcome is a foregone conclusion. Shanghai will be occupied by the enemy. If 700,000 NRA failed, what makes you think 400 of you can succeed? Xu Jiahui. Shangguan Zhibiao. In 1932, the Japanese also attacked Shanghai. One gasoline bomb, wiped out half of a company. He's considered lucky, he hung onto his life. 3rd Platoon, 1st Squad... Look across the bank. The people's eyes are on us. Their support for the resistance against Japan is getting stronger. Soon it will fade away. The passion of these people, can not change the war. I don't believe it! This will leave a mark in history. These people will be remembered. Then let's leave it to the later generations to discuss. I'll be honest with you. The Generalissimo orders you to remain here, is just a show put on for the western world. If your men persevere, you will not be warriors anymore. Have you seen the actors on the boat across the river? Don't turn this heroic undertaking into a bigger joke, Zhongmin. This is how you all define this battle? Zhongmin, the nature of war is always politics. 3rd Platoon, 7th Squad! Yes, sir! 7th Squad fall out! The concessions have already agreed to take you in. Retreat. It's meaningless to keep on fighting this war. The little hope you brought - will eventually become a great desperation. - Sir, 7th Squad all present! - Proceed. - Yes, sir! If you leave the warehouse, the glory will be gone, but at least your soldiers will survive. They are all flesh and blood, they all have parents and siblings. As a soldier, I wish... to defend us in this time of danger for our ancestors. 300,000 soldiers were killed out there! Now you're telling me they all have flesh and blood? All have parents and siblings? The government thought that if they stopped the invasion. There would be room for negotiation. But the fact is our military strength doesn't even come close. If the war keeps on going, spreading all over the country eventually the civilians will suffer the most. They will suffer even more attacks, death and separation. This country has gone through enough. Win or lose, I just hope this war can end sooner. So the civilians can suffer less. So the nation can suffer less. Compared to these civilians. Xie Jinyuan's glory is not important. Zhongmin, the Generalissimo's central army has been greatly reduced. Save some of our elites. When retreating, don't instigate new battles. Have the miscellaneous troops provide cover. Attention! Brothers. The Japanese have already warned the concessions. Regardless of the consequences, they will use all available methods including heavy artillery. If the gas tank is ignited, the concessions will turn into a sea of fire. 2 million fellow Chinese will die with us. Therefore, the superiors have given the command. Tonight at midnight, when the British turn off the searchlights, we retreat to the concession. The British requested us to retreat via the bridge. Look sharp and stay organised! Any soldier who tries to swim across will not be granted access. The entire world is watching us. Keep your chins up! - Yes, sir! - This retreat... needs to be well equipped and meticulously organized. So I will be in it with all of you. In order to get more people out of here, some people need to stay behind to cover the retreat. Who volunteers to stay behind? Write down your name. The brother who choose to stay, - Stay alive. - We are the forlorn hope to attack the enemy. I'll stay. To buy more time for our brothers to cross the bridge. I'm here for vengeance. It is true that... we lost this battle. But why? Because our nation is sick! Letting others bully us like this! We should be asking ourselves if we've done our best! I'll stay. Count me in. Will you help carry me over there? Count me in as well. Can you mail that photo to my hometown? - I don't want to die. - I've promised you. Jinyang County, Shanxi Province, Zhangkou Village, the Shi carpenters, it's all for my mother. I'll take care of it. And this... it's from the kid who jumped off the building. Brothers of the 88th Division! Yes, sir! You are all well-trained, German equipped forces. Each of you is one of this country's most elite soldiers. You are also the best medicine for this country. The 400 of us showed the people across the river that there is still hope for China! In order of squad number, move! 1st Company, 2nd Platoon, 1st Squad, Get ready! 1st Company, 4th Platoon, 5th Squad, get ready! These citizens will be the seed to awaken more people! Brothers, remember! You need to survive tonight. As long as there's one of us alive, then our glory will never disappear! Those who survived will represent us to join the national counterattack. For tonight's retreat, your mission is to survive. Remember! Survival is victory! I learned Guiguzi's tactics in order to rob graves. But now we are building graves! We were digging graves from the beginning. You're growing stubble. Pussy, where are you going? Pussy, pussy... You're the pussy! Greasy old fellow! Pussy, want cigarettes? Tell me, what does it feel like? Once you lay your eyes on them, then your head is dizzy. When you grab and rub them, your hand is soaked in the tenderness. Tremors softly like water, and your body just trembles. So nice... In my next life... I'll give it a good try. Inform all companies, cross the bridge in groups of twenty. - We need to be fast. - Yes, sir. - Attention all companies! - Where is Xiao Hubei? Break into groups of twenty, charge across the bridge! We need to be fast! Attention all companies! Groups of twenty, charge across the bridge. Turn off the lights and watch out for snipers. Find cover when the lights go on. Groups of twenty, charge across the bridge! Colonel, my great grandpa told me when I was a kid. The Zhu's Empire was taken over by the Manchus. None of his descendants fought back. It wasn't right. Now the Japanese are here, I shouldn't run again, right, Colonel? Look at the other side. Just the 400 of us aren't enough to fight back. We need to rely on the 400 million people behind us. We are going out there to wake them up. No one knows what this country will become in the future. So you need to survive, grow up well. When you grow up, you will be able to see this country become better. Pussy, let me send you off? Sure. Pussy, cigarettes are your life. Brothers. See you in next life! See you in next life! See you in next life! Let's go! Everyone, get ready! Yes, sir! Japanese. Shoot the lights off. Jun and Lei! Get on it! Yes, sir! Flare! Take cover! Everyone move inside! Everyone move inside! Hurry up! The Japanese have been waiting for us. Send one group first. Draw out the enemies' firing positions. - I'll lead the squad. - Colonel, I'll go. - Colonel! - Everyone shut up! Commander Yang will take over the command, give me the gun! Yes, sir! Then charge across the bridge in squad order. Each life that makes it counts, understand? Understood! Everyone! Take cover! Stand by! Everyone stand by! 1st Platoon ready! This letter arrived just in time, God brought Huang Zhong a chance to claim victory. He stands outside of the military camp shouting out his commands: All soldiers, listen carefully! First beat, preparing the food. Second beat, tightening up the armours. Third beat, pulling out the knives. Fourth beat, starting the battle. Follow the commands no matter what, those who defy orders will be executed. Then we will return with victory! They are standing in positions! Prepare to attack! All squads report! Sir, enemies sighted! Everyone! Battle position! Stand still! Stand still! Stop there or we will open fire! Ready! Fire! Colonel, the counter-fire has begun! Charge! Cross the bridge now! Don't look back! Run! Get up! Get up now! Charge! 2nd group, get ready! 2nd Squad and 3rd Squad are up! 2nd Squad and 3rd Squad, follow me! Go! Keep up the pace! Provide cover fire! Get ready to help! North! Four shooting points! Don't shoot at the concession area! Aim at your target! Help! Leave no man behind! Don't get caught up with fight! Increase firepower! Don't let them cross the bridge! There's a firing point to the west! Take cover! Anyone who can still move, keep crawling forward. Cross even if you have to crawl! Save me sir! I'm a soldier from, Sichuan, the 26th Division! Keep crawling! Save them! I'll go support the Colonel, I'm leaving the team with you! Zhang Zhigiang and Jiao Yousan! Come with me! Commander Yang! Fucking Japanese! Bastards. Shameless! Get out of the way! Morphine Sister Rong, go ahead! I'll pick it up! Kill that officer! Suppress enemy fire! Protect the Colonel! Fall out! All soldiers! Move forward and fall in! Wait for my command! Cover each other! They are all our compatriots! Save them! I can't do this anymore! Just shoot me! Let me answer the question you asked earlier. No one knows, how this history will be written. I don't have faith in today's political situation either. But I believe... our descendants will remember this place. Our country, will remember everything you did. Your people are the true Chinese people. These are my honest thoughts. Everyone charge across the bridge! Everyone charge across the bridge! Everyone charge across the bridge! Everyone charge across the bridge! All soldiers, form two rows! Don't return fire! Don't get caught up with fighting! Assist the injured! All soldiers! Charge across the bridge as fast as possible. Our fellow people across the river are watching us. Be courageous! Yes, sir! Wait for my order! Ready! Charge! Transcript by Synchronized, Hey, Nat!

Firing in place of three. Five, four... She made us. Target deployed smoke. She's on foot with the package. Stay high. I'm going to ground. Oksana. Oh, no. What did I do? Free the others. Yelena, we need a status report. Yelena, we need a status report. Converge on team leader. General Dreykov, we have a deserter. Permission to activate Taskmaster Protocol? Smile. You're in my bed. I'm... I'm not even under the covers. Did you get everything on my list? Got passports, entry visas, a couple of local driver's licenses. Mix and match, you should be able to stretch it to 20 or so identities. Fanny Longbottom? - What? - What, are you 12? That is a legitimate name. We've got a generator outside. It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank will need a flush in a couple of weeks, but, you know, I've got a guy coming for that. You have to haul your rubbish into town. It's just a 20-minute drive. I've got your basic hardware kit stashed under the stairs. Nice. Are you okay? Why wouldn't I be? I hear things. You know, something about the Avengers getting divorced... Ugh. It's fine. I'm actually better on my own. Are you sure? Yeah. Because you can tell me, you know. That's the way the whole friends thing works. I know. I have friends. People who have friends don't call me. And I don't pay you to worry. Oh, hey. What's all this junk? Oh, just some mail and personals from the Budapest safe house. Budapest? Yeah. Budapest. - No, it's ""Budapest."" - Budapest. Budapest. - It's ""Budapest."" - Whatever. I knew you weren't going back there, so I've got someone else in the flat now. Sorry you went through the trouble. I would've told you to chuck it. Well, if you don't want it, throw it in the rubbish. You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond. Why did you break up the encounter with my pet python? Because I discovered he had a crush on me. Moonraker 1 on preset launch program... Oh, great. ...minus two minutes. Retract crew access... I'm pretty sure Ross has no jurisdiction here. And you should know I'm a better shot when I'm pissed off. You're not here for me. Oh, shit. I know you're out there. I know you know I'm out here. Then why are you skulking about like it's a minefield? 'Cause I don't know if I can trust you. Funny, I was going to say the same thing. So, we gonna talk like grown-ups? Is that what we are? Put it down before I make you. You put yours down. Watch your step. Stay down. Stay down. Stay down. Stop. You had to come to Budapest, didn't you? I came here because I thought you wouldn't. But since you're here, what bullet does that? Not bullets. Arrows. Ah, right. If you didn't think I'd come here, why'd you send me this? You brought it back here? I'm not here trying to be your friend, but you need to tell me what that is. It's a synthetic gas. The counteragent to chemical subjugation. The gas immunizes the brain's neuropathways from external manipulation. Maybe in English next time? Why don't you take it to one of your super-scientist friends? They can explain it to you. Tony Stark, maybe? Oh, yeah. We're not really talking right now, so... Great. Perfect timing. Where's an Avenger when you need one? I don't wanna be here. I'm on the run. You could've gotten me killed. Well, what was I supposed to do? You're the only superhero person that I know. That was the whole reason I sent it to you. I kept checking the news, expecting to see Captain America bringing down the Red Room. What? Taking down the Red Room? What are you talking about? It's been gone for years. Dreykov's dead. I killed him. You don't actually believe that, do you? You really do believe that. Dreykov's dead. It took almost destroying the entire city just to get to him. If you're so sure, then tell me what happened. Tell me exactly. We rigged bombs. - Who's ""we""? - Clint Barton. Killing Dreykov was the final step in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D. Simple as that? Yeah, sure, ""simple."" That's what I'd call imploding a five-story building and then shooting it out with the Hungarian Special Forces. Took 10 days in hiding before we could even get out of Budapest. And you checked the body? Confirmed the kill? There was no body left to check. You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter. Where are we trying to get? Motorbike! East side of the building. I got you! No! Hey. Don't move. You're hurt. Let me help you. I don't wanna do this. - What are you doing? - He's making me. Do you believe me now? How many others? Enough. Which one's yours? Black. Brown seat. Where are my keys? Any day now. You can't just steal a guy's car. So you want me to chase him down and un-steal it? - Okay. Any time now, please. - Shut up. Okay, you got a plan, or shall I just stay duck-and-cover? Yeah, my plan was to drive us away. That's a shit plan. You're welcome. Oh, shit. He's back. Put your seat belt on. You're such a mom. Natasha, no. I think I'm bleeding. I'm... No. Not now, trust me. You okay? Yeah. Great plan. I love the part where I almost bled to death. This is cozy. Barton and I spent two days hiding out up here. That must have been fun. Who the hell is that guy? Dreykov's special project. He can mimic anyone he's ever seen. It's like fighting a mirror. Dreykov only deploys him for top-priority missions. This doesn't make any sense. Well, the truth rarely makes sense when you omit key details. What is that supposed to mean? You didn't say one word about Dreykov's daughter. You killed her. I had to. I needed her to lead me to Dreykov. We need confirmation Dreykov's in the building. His car is pulling up now. Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage. I needed her to be sure. Natasha, we clear? All clear. And here you are, not so sure. I needed out. The Red Room's still active. Where is it? I have no idea. He moves location constantly. And every widow is sedated on entry and exit for maximum security. I'm just finding it hard to believe that he could stay off my radar. Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger if you want to stay hidden. I mean, the clue is in the name. Dreykov kills you, one of the big ones comes to avenge you. Wait, what are the big ones? Well, I doubt the god from space has to take an ibuprofen after a fight. Where did you think I was all this time? I thought that you got out and were living a normal life. And you just never made contact again? Honestly, I thought you didn't wanna see me. Bullshit. You just didn't want your baby sister to tag along, whilst you saved the world with the cool kids. You weren't really my sister. And the Avengers aren't really your family. - Why do you always do that thing? - Do what? The thing you do when you're fighting. The... Like, the... This thing that you do when you whip your hair when you're fighting with the arm and the hair. And you do, like, a fighting pose. It's a... It's a fighting pose. You're a total poser. I'm not a poser. Oh, come on. I mean, they're great poses, but it does look like you think everyone's looking at you, like, all the time. All that time that I spent posing, I was trying to actually do something good to make up for all the pain and suffering that we caused. Trying to be more than just a trained killer. Well, then you were fooling yourself because pain and suffering is every day and we are both still a trained killer. Except I'm not the one that's on the cover of a magazine. I'm not the killer that little girls call their hero. That gas, the counteragent, it was synthesized in secret by an older widow from Melina's generation. I was on the mission to retrieve it, and she exposed me and I killed the widow that freed me. Did you have a choice? What you experienced was psychological conditioning. I'm talking about chemically altering brain functions. They're two completely different things. You're fully conscious, but you don't know which part is you. I'm still not sure. - Is that all there is left? - Mmm-hmm. It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov and his network of widows. He takes more every day. Children who don't have anyone to protect them. Just like us when we were small. Maybe one in 20 survives the training, becomes a widow. The rest, he kills. To him, we are just things. Weapons with no face that he can just throw away. Because there is always more. And no one's even looking for him, thanks to you and Alexei. Alexei? ""Dad."" Did you ever look for your parents? Your real ones? Well, my mom abandoned me in the street like garbage. What about you? They destroyed my birth certificate, so I reinvented it. My parents still live in Ohio. My sister moved out west. Is that right? You're a science teacher. You're working part-time, though, especially after you had your son. Your husband, he renovates houses. That is not my story. What is your story? I never let myself be alone long enough to think about it. Did you ever wish for kids? I want a dog. Where you gonna go? I don't know. I don't really have anywhere to go back to, so I guess anywhere. - Don't. - Don't what? You're going to give me some big hero speech, I can feel it. Speeches aren't really my thing. Huh. It was more like an invitation. To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov? Yeah. Even though the Red Room is impossible to find and Dreykov is too slippery to kill? Yeah. That sounds like a shitload of work. Yup. Could be fun, though. Yup. I saw where he put the keys. Top drawer, green cabinet. You know, this is the first piece of clothing I've ever bought for myself. That? Yeah. You don't like it? Is that like a... Is it army surplus, or... Okay, it has a lot of pockets. But I use them all the time, and I made some of my own modifications. - Oh, yeah? - Whatever. Shut up. The point is, I've never... I've never had control over my own life before, and now I do. I want to do things. Hmm... I like your vest. I knew it. I knew you did. It's so cool, right? It's good. Yes. I like it. And you can put so much stuff in there. You wouldn't even know. I really don't know where the Red Room is, though. - I'm sorry. - I know. But I think I know somebody who does. Oh, yeah? Who? We're gonna need a jet. I said we needed a jet. Yeah, you know what you didn't give me? Time. Or money. I'm not made of jets. I thought you were supposed to be the best. Like a real pro. Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina. Was the free flat and lifetime supply of kissel - not to your liking? - Ha! Don't let her wind you up. No, I take exception to impugning my professionalism. Well, you did set me up with a generator that crapped out after six hours. You, too, huh? Tag team. Aw, he's sensitive. See why you keep him around. Where's the rest? Voil. Ooh. Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago. How is it? It's dry. It's really dry. You know, you're getting dangerously close to running out your tab. Supplies I can tally, but you bring me attention from the authorities, all my prices go up. What's that supposed to mean? Your mate, Secretary Ross, has been sniffing around my affairs to the point at which I've got contacts declining my calls. I'm a private contractor. You are sensitive. You're a very annoying individual. - I'll make it up to you. - Mmm-hmm. That's what you say every time. So, I have the nuclear code. But there he is. - Captain America! - America. Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come! I grab hold of his shield and face to face, it's a test of strength. Oh... Oh, no. Oh... That guy think he going to beat me. Anyway, this shield, you know, that he carries with him like a precious baby blanket, you know? I use it to my advantage. I take it and I push him out the window. And I make my escape. Huh? What year was this? I don't know. Like, '83, '84. I know. Captain America was still frozen in ice then. Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh? Oh, no. Uh-oh. Aw, look at the big bear. Gonna cry, little girl? Today is your lucky day, Alexei. Move to the door on the south wall. Go left. Just don't make a scene. You made a scene, didn't you? What now? We're gettin' you outta here. Go to the upper level. Move your ass, super soldier. He's never going to make it. Get me closer. You got a better idea? Natasha. Such a poser. Seriously? Whoo! Sorry! What are you doing? Are you kidding me? Back up! We're both doing a really good job. No. Okay. Enough of this. Ha! Whoa... This would be a cool way to die. Tell me that's a good sign for us! Move your ass! Get us outta here! Huh. Wait! Yes! I need some help up here! Oh, that was exciting. Oh, I'm so proud of you girls. Oh, you can't hear me, huh? Okay. Ah... Wow. Okay. Why the aggression, huh? Is it your time of the month? I don't get my period, dipshit. I don't have a uterus. Or ovaries. Yeah. That's what happens when the Red Room gives you an involuntary hysterectomy. They kind of just go in and they rip out all of your reproductive organs. They just get right in there and they chop them all away. - Everything out, so you can't have babies. - Okay, okay. Okay! Okay! You don't have to get so clinical and nasty. Oh, well, I was about to talk about - fallopian tubes, but okay. - No. It means so much to me that you came back for me. No. No. You're gonna tell us how to get to the Red Room. Huh. Whoa, look at you, huh? All business. Trust me, this isn't pleasure. Little Natasha, all indoctrinated into the Western agenda. I chose to go west to become an Avenger. 'Cause they treated me like family. Really? Family? Well, where are they now? Where is that family now? Tell me where the Red Room is. I have no idea. Okay? Come on. You and Dreykov were like... - Dreykov? - Yeah. General Dreykov, my friend, huh? Gives me glory... Soviet Union's first and only super soldier. I could have been more famous than Captain America. Then he buries me in Ohio on that stupid mission. Three years! So tedious, boring me to tears. No offense, huh? Then puts me in prison for the rest of my life. Why, huh? Why? Why would he put me in... You know why? 'Cause maybe I want to talk about the withering of the state. Or maybe I don't like his hair or something and I say something casually about that. Maybe, you know, I want the Party to feel actually like a party instead of this sourpuss organization. But instead, no. He puts me in prison for the rest of my life. He just runs off and hides, huh? I'm not even the one who, uh, you know... I'm not the one who killed his daughter. Can we throw him out the window now? I think we should wait till we get to a higher altitude. All right. Wait, Mom Melina? We thought she was dead. You cannot kill a fox that swift. - Ew. - What? She was the scientist, the strategist. I was the muscle. She worked directly for Dreykov far more than I ever did. Wait. Are you telling me that Melina is working for the Red Room present day? She works remotely outside St. Petersburg. Uh... I don't think we have enough fuel for St. Petersburg. No, we're good. We'll make it. Okay. You should've brought the Avengers' superjet. I swear, if I hear one more word from him, - I will kick him in the face. - He's the worst. Natasha. Natasha. Natasha. Come here, I want to ask you something. - Come, it's important. - What? Did he talk to you about me? What? Did he talk to you about me? You know, trading war stories? Who? What are you talking about? Captain America. My great adversary in this theater of geopolitical conflict. Not so much a nemesis. More like a contemporary, you know? Coequal. I always thought there was a great deal of mutual respect... Wait. You haven't seen either one of us in 20 years and you're gonna ask me about you? What is with this tension? Did I do something wrong? Is that a serious question? I only ever loved you girls. I did my best to make sure you would succeed to achieve your fullest potential, - and everything worked out. - Everything worked out? Yes. For you, yes. We accomplished our mission in Ohio. Yelena, you went on to become the greatest child assassin the world has ever known. No one can match your efficiency, your ruthlessness. And Natasha, not just a spy, not just toppling regimes, destroying empires from within, but an Avenger. You both have killed so many people. Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red. I couldn't be more proud of you. Okay. You can... No. Let go of me now. You smell really bad. So, are we there yet? You'll know when we're there. Slight right. Straight on. Right. Slight right. Oh, very good, my darling. Yes, very good. Yes, very good, my darling. Back home where it's safe. Come on. Go on. Honey, we're home. Come on, girls. Welcome to my humble abode. Make yourself at home. Let's have a drink. Hey, no funny business. I am putting away my weapon. Are there any booby traps around here? Anything we need to know about? I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps. You didn't raise us at all. Oh, maybe so. But if you got soft, it wasn't on my watch. Let's drink. Okay. Still fits. Oh, my God. I never washed it once. Come and drink. Rise, you workers of salvation Family back together again. - Mmm. - Seeing as our family construct was just a calculated ruse that only lasted three years, I don't think that we can use this term anymore, can we? Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen... Okay. A reunion then, huh? And, uh... I want to say something right off the bat. You haven't aged a day, huh? You're just as beautiful and as supple as the day they staged our marriage. You got fat. But still good. I just got out of prison. I, uh... - I have a lot of energy. - Oh! Please don't do that. So, here's what's gonna happen. Natasha, don't slouch. - I'm not slouching. - Yes, yes, you are. I don't slouch. You're going to get a back hunch. - Listen to your mother. - Oh, my God, this... Up, up. All right, enough. All of you. I didn't say anything. That's not fair. - Here's what's gonna happen... - I don't want any food. Eat a little something, Yelena, for God's sake. You're gonna tell us the location of the Red Room. You know, it's like when you told them that they could stay up late to catch Santa Claus. What? That was fun. You know, ""He come down the chimney, girls. ""Look out. Where is he?"" You wait for him, and then when the cookies are gone, then you see he's there. No, no. What? I want them - to follow their dreams. - No good. Reach for the stars, girls. Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy. It's unfinished business. You can't defeat a man who commands the very will of others. You never saw the culmination of what we started in America. Nor did you. Natasha, always focus, focus. Get what you want. Come in. Did that pig just open the door? Yes. It did. Good boy, Alexei. Good boy. You named a pig after me? You don't see the resemblance? See, he sits just like dog. Amazing. Now, watch. It's a little weird, to me. Stop breathing. We infiltrated the North Institute in Ohio. It was a front for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists. Actually, it was Hydra scientists at that time. In conjunction with the Winter Soldier project, they had dissected and deconstructed the human brain to create the first and only cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia. Was the hub for cognition. Voluntary motor movement, procedural learning. We didn't steal weaponry or technology. We stole the key to unlocking free will. What are you doing? Oh, I am explaining that the science is now so exact, the subject can be instructed to stop breathing and has no choice but to obey. Okay, you made your point. That's enough. Yes, all right. Well, don't worry, Alexei could've survived 11 more seconds without oxygen. Good boy. Now, you go back, back home where it's safe. You go. You go back home, back home where it's safe. Good boy, Alexei. The world functions on a higher level when it is controlled. Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents planted around the globe. And do you know who they test it on? Hmm... No. That's not my department. Ah, come on, come on. - Don't lie to them. Hmm? - I'm not lying. You're Dreykov's architect, huh? What were you? If I was his architect, you were his partner. You were his business partner. No, no, no. I was patsy! - Don't give me that... - He sell me ideology. - Stop with the politics. - All the while, bigger... Shut up! You are an idiot. And you're a coward. You're a coward. And our family was never real, so there's nothing to hold on to. We're moving on. Never family, huh? In my heart, I am simple man. And I think that for a couple deep undercover Russian agents I think we did pretty great as parents, huh? Yes, we had our orders, and we played our roles to perfection. Who cares? That wasn't real. - What? - That wasn't real. Who cares? Don't say that. Please don't say that. It was real. It was real to me. You are my mother. You were my real mother. The closest thing I ever had to one. The best part of my life was fake. And none of you told me. And those agents you chemically subjugated around the globe? That was me. Mmm. And you, you got out. Dreykov made sure no one could escape. Are you gonna say anything? No. Don't touch me. Yelena. No. - I had no idea. - It's okay, it's okay. I'll go talk to her. I came in here because I didn't want to talk. Okay. We, uh... We just sit. We just sit. Where are you going? - To do this myself. - Don't. You won't survive. I wish I could believe that you cared. But you're not even the first mother that abandoned me. No, you weren't abandoned. You were selected by a program that assessed the genetic potential in infants. I was taken? I believe a bargain was struck, your family paid off. But your mother, she never stopped looking for you. She was like you in that way. She was relentless. What happened to her? Dreykov had her killed. Her existence threatened to uncover the Red Room. Normally, the actions of one curious civilian wouldn't warrant an execution, but, as I said, she was relentless. I thought about her every day of my life. Whether or not I admitted it to myself, I did. I've always found it best not to look into the past. Then why did you save this? I remember this day. We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter and summer vacation all in one day. - Different backdrops. - Mmm. I knew all the presents under the tree were just empty boxes, but I didn't care. I wanted to open every single one... so just for a second it would feel real. Let's stop this. Why you doing this? Why does a mouse born in a cage run on that little wheel? Do you know I was cycled through the Red Room four times before you were even born? Those walls are all I know. I was never given a choice. But you're not a mouse, Melina. You were just born in a cage, but that's not your fault. Tell me, how did you keep your heart? Pain only makes us stronger. Didn't you tell us that? What you taught me kept me alive. I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room. They'll be here any minute. So, there I am ice fishing with my father. It's very cold day in this little ice shed. Cold even for Russia, you know? ""Keep the vodka by the fire,"" my father would say to me. Please stop talking. - Please wait. Please wait. - Please, no. Please, I don't want to talk. Please. Please. There is a reason why I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me. I am reaching for fish. Oh! I lose balance. Ah! Splash! My hands go in the river. In this weather, frostbite sets in quick. My father, he go toilet on my hands. Oh, my God. Urine is 35 degrees Celsius, staves off the frostbite. How is this relevant? You know, fathers. No. No. You have done nothing but tell me how bored you were. I was the chore, the job you didn't want to do. To me? To me, you were everything. Exactly. You don't care. You don't care. The only thing you care about are your stupid glory days as the Crimson Dynamo, and no one wants to hear about it. It's the Red Guardian. Get out. Get out! I can't remember If I cried When I read about his widowed bride Something touched me deep inside The day The music Died And they were singing - Bye - Bye - Miss American Pie - American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee - But the levee was dry - Was dry Them good old boys Drinking whiskey Singing ""This will be the day that I die"" ""This'll be the day..."" Get down. They think... I'm sorry. Let's not keep him waiting. Request clearance for landing. Melina? We're touching down in one minute. Then why are we still going up? Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed above the radar all these years. My God. Look at you. So, uh, how was the family reunion? Oh, it was awful. They were clingy, and too emotional, and needy. - Just like old times, huh? - Hmm. Yelena Belova. What's the deal with her? She was the only one affected, right? As far as I know, yes. These gasses and antidotes, it's a pain in my ass. It's a problem. You need to sort it. Hmm. I have nine pigs that will require attending to in my absence. Don't give a shit about your pigs. Cut her brain out... Hmm? Identify the weakness. This is a much less cool way to die. Alexei. What about Romanoff? She's a traitor. She turned her back on her people. On her blood. She had nothing. I gave her home. I gave her love. Put that thing in her you do. You know, uh, chemicals. Turn her into one of your pigs. Can you imagine what I could do with an Avenger under my control? Wouldn't you like to speak to her first? When you look into the eyes of a child you have raised, no mask in the world can hide that. Welcome home. Now, now. Don't go breaking my new toy. Natasha. I can't save us. I need you to know that I'm sorry. I pledged my life to a cause. You know, I thought I was being very brave. Possibly the bravest. But I wasn't being brave. I was coward. In Cuba, when they came and took you away from me... No cause is worth that. You should only sacrifice yourself for something... How did you do that? I designed these cells myself. What? What? I bared my soul to you and it was just you the whole time? Yes, I'm afraid so. But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena. Yelena, it's me. It's Mama. You have a two-inch blade concealed in your beltline. What? What are you going to do to me? Outside right hip. You couldn't have told me sooner? Don't throw a fit. - There wasn't time. - Okay, girls, I'm having trouble hearing you, but, Natasha, there's something I need you to know. I need you to know that I'm sorry. No more excuses, okay? I gave my life for a cause. I thought I was being brave. You don't have earpiece. What? No, she can't hear you. - You don't have earpiece. - Why not? Because it wasn't part of the plan. Oh, yeah? Well, what was the plan? So, once we're inside, I'll activate my tracker and Ross will come running. You are aware that you are still a global fugitive, yes? You know the facility. There must be some way to land it. Instruct them to confine us on level zero. Once I'm out, I can activate the landing protocol, we can descend within the hour. Ah, problem. I only have one earpiece set. I'll give it to Yelena. Where did he take the vials? Probably down to cold storage. Dreykov still has the widows under his control, so you have to expose them to this antidote. Yeah. Sure. Easy. Is this your plan? My plan is to kill you. I'm alive. So, what do we do now? What was my mother's name? Ah... Where we buried her, there was a tree... Um... A pink blossom. Beautiful. And there was a tombstone with her name engraved on it. What was her name? Ah. ""Unknown."" You don't feel anything? You feel anything when I killed your daughter? Is this your haunted past? Really? Thank you, Natasha. You gave me my greatest weapon. Say hello. When your bomb exploded, it nearly killed my Antonia. I had to put a chip in the back of her neck. In the back of her neck. Look at her. You find it difficult to look at her? I do. She... She watches everything and she can do it. She's a perfect mimic. And she fights just like all of your friends. Can she hear me? What? You want to make her feel better? You want to tell her you're sorry? Well, you should have thought of that before you blew her face off. But enough of all this bullshit. Go to work. I have rats in the basement. Go. Go. Well, that was a mistake. Was it? You just sent away the one thing that would stop me from killing you. Try, then. Do it. Is the safety on? No. Try your knife. Ah... You're in trouble. How are you controlling me? I'm not controlling you, Natasha. Well, not yet. But there is a pheromonal lock. Smelling my pheromones prevents you from committing violence against me. I'm very upset with Melina. It's a shame I have to kill her. Come on, now. If we're just going to press buttons and hack computers... - Yes. - I mean, I don't know. There's nothing for me to do. I want to... I want to break something. Oh, you do? Oh, there is something you can break. Melina, if this is the last time that we... Ah, damn it. That was disgusting. Okay. So, this was the big plan, huh? Melina was going to land the Red Room and hand me over to the authorities. Oh, no, no, no. So, what now, you're gonna fold me into your pathetic little puppeteer act? Pathetic, huh? Yeah, what would you call it? - I would call it... - When was the last time that you had a conversation with somebody that wasn't forced to talk to you? You ran away to fight in the wrong war. The real war was fought here, in the shadows. You didn't fight in the shadows. You hid in the dark. Real power comes from undetectable influence. If no one's noticed, then why even do it? You're nothing. - Hmm. - You have nothing. There are 50 people on this planet... Oh, stop it. Don't tell me to stop! If I don't tell you when to stop, then how will you know when to shut up? Come on. Think I can't take a punch? Oh. - God damn it, you're weak. - Weak? I bet it's easier to be tough in front of defenseless little girls, huh? That's enough. You wouldn't be so glib if you had any notion of the scope of what I've built. I own this world. Me. You seem desperate to impress me. I don't need to impress you. I don't need to impress anyone. These world leaders, these great men, they answer to me and my widows. Look at them. These girls were trash. They are thrown out into the street. I recycle the trash. And I give them purpose. I give them a life. Melina, I found the location of the vials. I've had a slight setback. You'll need to get to the widows. It's my network of widows that help me control the scales of power. One command, the oil and stock markets crumble. One command, and a quarter of the planet will starve. My widows can start and end wars. They can make and break kings. You control all of that from here? And with you, an Avenger under my control, I can finally come out of the shadows using the only natural resource that the world has too much of. Girls. All from that little console? Yeah. Oh, you find this amusing? Why are you smiling? Don't take it personal, but, uh... Thank you for your cooperation. Even if you locate the database and get him to show you the key, you won't be able to take it from him. For years, Dreykov has implemented a pheromonal lock in all widows, even me. So, as long as we can smell him, then we won't be able to hurt him. Well, I'll just hold my breath. Not enough. This is basic science. Natasha, to block receptors in olfactory center, you have to sever the nerve. I can handle that. You weren't quite strong enough, so... I'll have to finish it myself. What are you going to do? Sever the nerve. Melina! Precisely what I was thinking. Yelena, slight change of plan. I completely demolished one of the engines and we are going into a controlled crash. Fantastic. I'm heading to the widows now. No. We have to go. Not so talkative now, are you? You took my childhood. You took my choices and tried to break me. But you're never gonna do that to anybody ever again. Nobody leaves this room until she's dead. Make her suffer. I don't wanna hurt you. You don't wanna hurt me. Hey. Are you okay? That looks like it hurts. Okay. I take out on three, ready? I'm sorry. Get as far away from here as possible. You get to make your own choices now. We gotta get outta here. We need to find Dreykov. Are you coming? I'm right behind you. Wait, wait! I have to go back! Yes! Do you see the girls? No! We need to go back. We've lost control. Antonia. No! I'm gonna open the door. You're gonna come after me. It's okay. It's okay. I know you're still in there. And I'm not gonna leave you. Okay. Yelena! She's on the wing! Move! What are you waiting for? Don't do it! This was fun! No! Okay. Let's go. Enough. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is he gone? He's gone. Yelena! Yelena? We're both upside down. I should've come back for you. You don't have to say that. - It's okay. - Hey. Hey. It was real to me, too. Thank you. Everybody good? I am clearly injured. You got something to say? I'd just mess it up. Here comes the cavalry. We're closing in on the target, sir. So, what's our plan? You guys go. I'll stay. That's insanity. We fight. We fight with you. - I'll hold them off. - Natasha, we fight. We can't split up. You're so pigheaded. - You guys, go. - Oh, my God. Besides, if it can work out with the four of us, you know, there may be some hope for the Avengers. Little bit. Okay, well, if you're leaving, then I guess you should take this. I know how much you like it. Shucks. It does have a lot of pockets. Very handy pockets, yeah. He had widows implanted all over the world. Melina will need to copy the formula, but you should be the one to tell 'em it's over. You came back for us. Thank you. Hey. Hey. You take care of yourself, okay? Don't worry. I got this. I know. Don't worry. We're bringing her with us. Come. Come with us. You ever not sleep? I've been in six different time zones in three days because of you. - Oh, really? - Yeah. What, are you scrapping together some parts? What'd you get me this time, like, an upside-down lawnmower? You see what I can get you with a bit of time and money? Go on, say it. I wanna hear it. It would really be good for me to hear it. Really. I'm impressed. Well, yeah. You've always been a really good friend to me. That's what every man wants to hear. Where you gonna go? It's funny. My whole life, I didn't think I had any family. Turns out I got two, so... One of them's a bit of a mess right now. I'm gonna go break a few of them out of prison see if I can't help patch things up. Come on, Fanny. Wow. Sorry. I'm allergic to the Midwest. What this woman did, honestly, I can't even imagine. You're not supposed to be bothering me on my holiday time, Valentina. Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no. I'm just here paying my respects. Hmm... You know, coming here makes you look desperate. Okay. I want a raise. Oh, yeah. You and me both. Believe me, you're gonna earn it. I've got your next target. Thought I'd hand-deliver it. Maybe you'd like a shot at the man responsible for your sister's death. Kind of a cutie, don't you think?, My planet Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low. Rolling over the sands... you can see spice in the air. At nightfall, the spice harvesters land. The outsiders race against time to avoid the heat of the day. They ravage our lands in front of our eyes. Their cruelty to my people is all I've known. These outsiders, the Harkonnens, came long before I was born. By controlling spice production, they became obscenely rich. Richer than the Emperor himself. Our warriors couldn't free Arrakis from the Harkonnens, but one day, by Imperial decree, they were gone. Why did the Emperor choose this path? And who will our next oppressors be? It's good you're up early. Your father wants you in full dress before the Emperor's Herald arrives. Full dress? Military? Ceremonial. Why do we have to go through all this when it's already been decided? Ceremony. Mm. Thank you. If you want it, make me give it to you. Use the Voice. Mom, I just woke up. Give me the water. The glass can't hear you. Command me. Give me the water. Almost. Almost? Bene Gesserit skills take years to learn, Paul. - Mm-hmm. - You look tired. More dreams? No. Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events make life outside the cities of Arrakis truly hostile, with sandstorms powerful enough to cut through metal. Only the native tribes known as the Fremen have adapted well enough to survive. Preferring to inhabit the remotest regions of Arrakis, the Fremen share the deep desert with the giant sandworms known to the Fremen as Shai-Hulud. Long exposure to spice has given the tribe their characteristic blue eyes, the Eyes of Ibad. Little else is known of the Fremen, except that they are dangerous and unreliable. Fremen attacks make spice harvesting extremely hazardous. For the Fremen, spice is the sacred hallucinogen which preserves life and brings enormous health benefits. For the Imperium, spice is used by the navigators of the Spacing Guild to find safe paths between the stars. Without spice, interstellar travel is impossible, making it by far the most valuable substance in the universe. Smile, Gurney. I am smiling. How much will it cost them, traveling all this way for this formality? Three Guild Navigators. A total of 1.46 million, 62 solaris, round trip. By the grace of Shaddam IV of House Corrino, ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne of Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe, I stand before you as Herald of the Change. We are witnessed by members of the Imperial Court, representatives of the Spacing Guild and a sister of the Bene Gesserit. The Emperor has spoken. ""House Atreides shall immediately take control of Arrakis and serve as its steward."" Do you accept? We are House Atreides. There is no call we do not answer, there is no faith that we betray. The Emperor asks us to bring peace to Arrakis. House Atreides accepts. Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Your seal. So, it's done? It's done. How was it? Stabilizers are too loose. - We'll dial it in. - Thank you, my friend. Got it. Duncan. My boy. Hey. Hey. Paul, my boy. So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow. With the advance team. Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow with the advance team. I'd like you to take me with you. You would? Well, that's too bad. 'Cause no. Duncan. Are you trying to get me court-martialed? What's going on? Can I trust you with something? Always. You know that. I've been having dreams. About Arrakis and the Fremen. Okay. So? I saw you. With the Fremen. Ah. So, I do find them. There you go. That's a good omen right there, right? Lanville! I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle. It felt like if I had been there, you'd be alive. First off, I'm not gonna die. You're not taking me seriously. That's why you want to come with me. Listen. Dreams make good stories, but everything important happens when we're awake. 'Cause that's when we make things happen. Look at you. Put on some muscle? I did? No. Hey. See you on Arrakis, my boy. Father, I'd like to ask to join Duncan Idaho on his scout mission to Arrakis tomorrow. I've studied the Fremen language, I'd be an asset. Out of the question. You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis, like the rest of us. I've been training my whole life. What is the point if I'm not allowed to face some actual risk? You know why, Paul. You're the future of House Atreides. And Grandfather fought bulls for sport! Yes. And look where that got him. I need you by my side. When we get to Arrakis, we'll face enormous danger. What danger? The Fremen? The desert? Political danger. The Great Houses look to us for leadership, and this threatens the Emperor. By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens and making it ours, he sets the stage for a war which would weaken both houses. But if we hold firm, and tap the true power of Arrakis, we could be stronger than ever. What does that mean? Mining spice, keeping the Fremen in their place? We'd be no better than Harkonnens. No. By making an alliance with the Fremen. That's what I've sent Duncan Idaho to arrange. Here on Caladan, we've ruled by air power and sea power. On Arrakis, we need to cultivate desert power. I want you sitting in on my Council. Learn what I do. What if I'm not, Dad? Not what? The future of House Atreides. I told my father I didn't want this either. I wanted to be a pilot. You never told me that. Your grandfather said, ""A great man doesn't seek to lead. He's called to it, and he answers."" And if your answer is no... you'll still be the only thing I ever needed you to be... my son. I found my own way to it. Maybe you'll find yours. In their memory... give it a try. Don't stand with your back to the door. How many times do we have to tell you? I could tell it was you by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck. Someone might imitate my stride. I know the difference. Are you the new Weapons Master? With Duncan Idaho gone, I must make do as best I can. Choose your blade. I've had quite a day, Gurney. Give us a song instead. That's rude. Come on. Come on. Old man. Ah, the slow blade penetrates the shield. I guess I'm not in the mood today. - Mood? - Yeah. What's mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises, no matter the mood. Now fight! Come on! I have you. Aye. But look down, my lord. You'd have joined me in death. I see you found the mood. Will it be that bad? You don't get it, do you? You don't really understand the grave nature of what's happening to us. For 80 years, Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen. 80 years of owning the spice fields. Can you imagine the wealth? Your eyes. I need to see it in your eyes. You never met Harkonnens before, I have. They're not human, they're brutal! You have to be ready. Lord Baron. Rabban. The last of our ships have left Arrakis. It's done. Very good. Uncle, how can we let this happen? How can the Emperor take everything we've built and give it to that Duke? How? Don't be too sure it's an act of love. What does he mean? When is a gift not a gift? The Atreides' voice is rising, and the Emperor is a jealous man. A dangerous, jealous man. Paul. Paul, wake up. What's wrong? Get dressed and come with me. What is this? The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is here. She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. She's now Truthsayer to the Emperor himself. She would like to meet you. Why? She wants to know about your dreams. How does she know about my dreams? And why is Dr. Yueh here? He only needs a moment. Hello, young master. Your mother asked me to check your vitals. What's happening? The Bene Gesserit say they serve the greater good... But, meaning no disrespect to your lady mother... they also serve their own designs. What are you saying? Go carefully. His heart is strong as ever, my lady. Tell no one of this. Paul... Remember your training. Who are you? Defiance in the eyes. Like his father. Leave us. You must do everything the Reverend Mother tells you. You dismiss my mother in her own house. Come here. Kneel. How dare you use the Voice on me? Put your right hand in the box. Your mother bade you obey me. I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar. A poison needle. Instant death. The test is simple. Remove your hand from the box and you die. What's in the box? Pain. No need to call the guards. Your mother stands behind that door. No one would get past her. Why are you doing this? An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape. What will you do? Silence. I must not fear. I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings obliteration. And I'll face my fear and I'll permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past... I will turn the inner eye and see its path. And where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain. Enough. Like sifting sand through a screen, we sift people. If you had been unable to control your impulses, like an animal, we could not let you live. You inherit too much power. What, because I'm a duke's son? Because you are Jessica's son. You have more than one birthright, boy. Jessica? You've been training him in the Way. Tell me about these dreams. - I had one tonight. - What did you see? A girl. On Arrakis. Have you dreamt of her before? Many times. Do you often dream things that happen just as you dreamed them? Not exactly. Goodbye, young human. I hope you live. Did you have to go that far? You chose to train him in the Way, in defiance of our rule. He wields our power. He had to be tested to the limits. So much potential, wasted in a male. You were told to bear only daughters. But you, in your pride, thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach. Was I wrong? You're lucky he didn't die in that room. If he is The One, he has a long way to go. His Sight is barely awakened, and now he goes into the fire. But our plans are measured in centuries. We have other prospects if he fails his promise. Do you see so little hope? On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you. A path has been laid. Let's hope he doesn't squander it. Paul. What does it mean? That I could be The One? You heard. The Bene Gesserit serve as powerful partners to the Great Houses, but there's more to it. You steer the politics of the Imperium from the shadows. I know. You don't know everything. For thousands of years, we've been carefully crossings bloodlines - to bring forth... - The One? A mind... powerful enough to bridge space and time. Past and future. Who can help us into a better future. We think he's very close now. Some believe he's here. All part of a plan. Shield. ""My lungs taste the air of Time, Blown past falling sand..."" Thufir Hawat. Young master! How does it feel to walk on a new world? Exciting, to say the least. My lord. How are you, old friend? My advance team has secured the city. We're still smoothing out a few rough spots. My lady. Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Don't be fooled by the welcome. They follow their old masters' rules. Mandatory attendance. That's Harkonnen love out there. Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Atreides! Let's get you out of the sun. The heat can kill in this place. They were pointing at us. What are they shouting? Lisan al-Gaib. ""Voice from the Outer World."" It's their name for ""messiah."" It means the Bene Gesserit have been at work here. Planting superstitions. Preparing the way, Paul. These people have waited for centuries for the Lisan al-Gaib. They see you, they see the signs. They see what they've been told to see. We're good to go. Shield Wall. Protects the city from the weather and the worms. The locals call the big one the Hand of God. Well, the Hand of God is wreaking havoc on our comms system. It's so quiet. Yeah. That's what worries me, too. There's the spaceport and that plume of dust there is the spice refinery. Our two most vulnerable points. I want you guarding them. If we can't refine spice and ship it off-world, - we're dead here. - My lord. The sun's getting too high. We need to seal the doors. What do they say about this hellhole again? ""To shower, you scrub your ass with sand,"" my lord. That's what they say. That's what they say. Candidates for a housekeeper, my lady. What is your name? Shadout Mapes, my lady. The rest of you may go. Thank you. Shadout. It's an old Chakobsa word. ""Well-dipper."" You know the ancient tongues? I know many things. I know that you have a weapon concealed in your bodice. Not now. If you mean to harm me, I must warn you, whatever you're hiding, it won't be enough. The weapon is meant as a gift if you are truly The One. Do you know this? It's a crysknife. Do you know its meaning? Be ready for violence. It's a maker... A maker of the deep desert. When you have lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock. Lisan al-Gaib. The mother and the son. It is yours. Tooth of Shai-Hulud. Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Hello. You shouldn't be out here at this hour of the day. They're out here. Hmm. Fremen pilgrims. They don't care about heatstroke. I didn't know date palms could even be found out here. Oh, these aren't indigenous. They can't survive without me. Each one of these drinks every day the equivalent of five men. Twenty palm trees. A hundred lives. Should we remove them? Save the water? No, no, no. These are sacred. Old dream. The largest and most dangerous organism on Arrakis is the sandworm, capable of reaching 400 meters in length. To avoid making rhythmic noises, which attract the sandworms, the Fremen cross desert spaces using the sandwalk, a dance-like motion with irregular rhythm which emulates the natural sounds of the desert. What scant plant life exists on Arrakis is thanks to the Fremen, who have cultivated deep-rooted terranic plants such as saguaro, burrobush, sand-verbena and incense bush. The shepherd's tree has the deepest documented roots, stretching more than 450 feet deep. These plants cling to life in a parched, nutrient-poor landscape. It's a hunter-seeker. The operator must be nearby. The Harkonnen agent was cemented into that hole six weeks ago. Ran the hunter-seeker through a water pipe inside the walls. Sire, I failed you today. There's no excuse. You have my resignation. You would deprive us of your talents at this time? Sire, my honor demands... They tried to take the life of my son! I don't give a damn about your honor. You want absolution? Go catch some spies. Your Grace. The thing must leave. You can speak without fear. Our pet doesn't understand your language. Get out. It understands. Activate silence. What is the Emperor's message? He will strengthen your hand. With his Sardaukar army. It must never be known. There's no satellites over Arrakis. The Atreides will die in the dark. On that matter, Duke Leto Atreides means nothing to our order. But his wife is under our protection and by extension, her son. Allow them the dignity of exile. House Harkonnen would never dream of violating the sanctity of your order. I give you my word. We will not harm them. If the Duke's son lives... No Atreides will live. My lord, you gave your word to the witch. She sees too much. I said I would not harm them. And I shall not. But Arrakis is Arrakis. And the desert takes the weak. My desert. My Arrakis. My Dune. Your first strategy meeting. Paul Atreides, who catches hunter-seekers in his bare hands like a hero of old. Thanks for the humiliation, old man. Gotta keep an eye on you. Attention! Let's get started. Thufir. Operations. I secured a copy of the Harkonnens' account books. The Harkonnens were taking 10 billion solaris out of here every year. ""They shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and the treasure hid in the sand."" We won't see profits like that for a while. Not with the equipment they left us. How bad is it? These are spice silos. We're meant to fill every crate. All of them? Every 25 standard days. Harkonnen sabotage slows us down. But who's meant to arbitrate? Isn't there a Judge of the Change to oversee the transition? Who did the Emperor appoint? Dr. Liet Kynes. Imperial Ecologist. Been here 20 years. Eccentric, from what I'm told. I want to see these harvesting fields myself. I wouldn't recommend it, my lord. Have this Judge of the Change accompany us. A meeting's long overdue. And we'll get a bit of Imperial protection. A hostage. I love it. Hmm. He's here, my lord. Take care of them. They are friends. Duncan! Ah! My boy! I swear you're getting taller. Well, you smell much worse. For four weeks, I lived with the Fremen. Hidden in the desert, in a community called a sietch. Stilgar, the leader of that sietch, has come with me to meet you, sire. This sietch, how is it hidden? It's underground. Arrakis is filled with caverns. How big was the place? I'd say 10,000 people. And there are hundreds of sietches. Millions of Fremen. You were right. The Harkonnen estimate was 50,000 on the whole planet. The Fremen watched me search for them for days. I never saw them. Finally, they sent a warrior out to kill me. And I gotta tell you, I have never come so close to dying. There's no finer fighter in the Imperium. They fight like demons. Desert power. Duncan. - Well done. - Thank you, my lord. Sire. Their leader has a knife he won't surrender, sire. It's a crysknife. It's sacred to his people. Let him pass. Stop there. Hey! Hey! Mm. Stilgar. Welcome. Sir, I respect the personal dignity of any man that respects mine. Hmm. Hold. Thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body's moisture. We accept it in the spirit in which it was given. I'm glad you've come. I believe your people and mine have much to offer one another. No, no, you are Outworlders. You come here for the spice, you take it, giving nothing in return. That's true. I know you've suffered at the hands of the Harkonnen. Name what you want. If it's in my power to grant, I'll give it and ask for nothing. Mm. I ask for this. Do not seek our sietches. Do not trespass in our lands. The desert was ours long before you came. So, come and dig your spice, but when you have it, go back to this side of the Shield Wall and leave the desert to the Fremen. You will address the Duke as ""my lord"" or ""sire."" Gurney, just... Just a moment. The Emperor has given me Arrakis as my fief to rule and protect. I cannot promise not to travel into the desert if duty compels me. But your sietches will be yours forever. And you will never be hunted while I govern here. That's very honorable. I must go. That's all I have to say to you. Won't you stay? We would honor you. Honor requires that I be elsewhere. I recognize you. I don't like him. Our plan bears fruit. But it will take time? Yes. It will take time. Here, this is for you. It's a paracompass. The moons here have a magnetic field, so... a simple compass needle won't point north. Takes a clever piece of clockwork to sort it out. The Fremen make these? And stillsuits, and sand compactors, and all kinds of ingenious things. What the hell is a sand compactor? That's a sand compactor. My God, man, you've gone native. You admire them. I do. They're fierce but loyal. They're attuned to the desert. Part of it. It's part of them. You wait till you see it. It's beautiful out there. Sunrise warning, all workers. Temperature today will reach 140 degrees. We are currently 90 degrees, and in 10 minutes, we will hit 120 degrees. Last warning call. The Judge of the Change, sire. Dr. Liet Kynes. My lord Duke. Welcome to Arrakis. You're the Imperial Ecologist. Thank you for the stillsuits. They are of Fremen make. The best. With your permission, sire, I must check the integrity of your suit... Whoa. It's all right. It's all right. Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands. A stillsuit is a high-efficiency filtration system. Even this early in the morning, you wouldn't survive two hours without one of these. It cools the body and recycles the water lost to sweat. Your body's movements provide the power. Inside the mask, you'll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water. Mm. In good working order, your suit won't lose more than a thimbleful of water a day. Most impressive. Let's have a look at you, lad. You've... worn a stillsuit before? No, this is my first time. Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who taught you to do that? It seemed the right way. He shall know your ways as though born to them. Are you Fremen? I am accepted in both sietch and village. Now, come and see the spice sands on which your livelihood depends. What would you do if your ornithopter went down out here? You wouldn't want to go down out there. It's worm territory. Dust cloud. I see it. That's one of your harvesters. You can see the spice scattered over the surface. A rich spice bed by the color. If you get a little higher, you'll have a better view. You see these spotter aircraft looking for wormsign. Wormsign? A sand wave moving toward the crawler. Worms travel deep but get closer to the surface when they attack. If you are patient, we should see one. A worm always comes? Always. They're drawn by rhythmic noises. Why don't we just shield the crawlers? A shield's a death sentence in the desert. It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy. Is that a worm? Big one. You have good eyes. Calling crawler Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge. Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over. They seem pretty calm about it. Unlisted flight. Imperium business. Wormsign north and east of you. 3.7 kilometers. Delta Ajax niner, this is Spotter One. Wormsign confirmed. Stand by for contact fix. Worm is on intercept course to your position. Contact in five minutes. So, what happens now? They'll call a carryall to lift the crawler. They'll harvest right up to the last minute. Calling carryall Alpha Zero. Ready for docking sequence. Contact five minutes. Over. Anybody got a visual on the carryall? There it is. This is carryall Alpha Zero to Delta Ajax niner. Approaching from your east. Correcting altitude and preparing docking equipment. Copy, Alpha Zero. Initiating docking sequence. T-5. Copy that. Prepare to be airborne in 30 seconds. Docking sequence initiated. Brace yourselves. Alpha Zero, we're short one point of contact. What is going on? It's one of the anchors. It's dead. Shit. Carryall unable to receive. Unable to lift without that anchor. All call! All call! Any carryall in the sector, please respond! Spotter One, give us an update. Over. Hydraulics are dead. We won't make it. You have to evacuate. Contact in four minutes. Try it again! How many men on that crawler? Crew of 21. Our ships can take six each. That's still three short. We'll find a way. This is Duke Leto Atreides. We're coming down to extract the crew of Delta Ajax niner. We'll set down on the west. Shield generators weigh 100 kilos each. Yes, Gurney, have our escorts throw out the shield generators. Yes, sire. And, Paul, I want you at the back of the thopter. Guide them in. Delta Ajax niner, put seven men each in my ships now. Contact in two minutes. Getting close, guys. We better abandon ship now. Where are they? Sir, there's protocol for a reason. If we take one step out there, we're as good as dead. Besides, we've got a full load of spice. - We can't just leave it. - Damn the spice! I want every man off that crawler now! Hey! Hey! Seven over here, seven over there. Go! Go! Go! Kwisatz Haderach. Kwisatz Haderach awakes. Hurry! Get on! It's here! Paul! Paul! I recognize your footsteps, old man. Get up! Let's go! What's the matter with you? Come on! Let's go! Run! Hey! Bless the Maker and His Water. Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world and keep the world for His people. Hey! - You cannot take such risks. - Yes, sir. You have responsibilities. I... I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again. Go. Dr. Kynes. You saw it. With your own eyes. It's plain to see. Everything they've left us is in shambles. We've been set up to fail. That carryall was just old. The desert isn't kind to equipment. You know what will happen if I don't get spice production back on track. I'm not here to take your part. Arrakis has seen men like you come and go. Take good care of your family. The desert's not kind to humans either. Spice is a psychoactive chemical. You seem to be sensitive. You'll be fine. Thank you, Dr. Yueh. That wasn't an allergic reaction. I had a vision. My eyes were wide open. What did you see? Kwisatz Haderach. You can see. It's confusing. I thought I saw my death, only it wasn't. I know a knife is important, somehow. Someone will hand me a blade, but I don't know who, or when, or where. Some things, though, are crystal clear. I can feel it. I know you're pregnant. You can't know that. I barely know that. It's only been a few weeks. Why does the Baron need us? Harkonnens outnumber the Atreides. Atreides legions are the finest in the Imperium. Trained by Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho. We are the Sardaukar. The Emperor's blades. Those who stand against us fall. Just so. Three battalions. As agreed. The Emperor commands it. It is done. There is something you need to know about Paul. No. Don't think I want to know. Ever since you brought him before your Reverend Mother, he hasn't been the same. He's distracted. Jessica, you gave me a son. And from the moment he was born, I never questioned you. I trusted you completely. Even when you walked in shadows. Now I'm asking you this one thing. If anything happens... will you protect our son? With my life. I'm not asking his mother. I'm asking the Bene Gesserit. Will you protect Paul? Why are you having these thoughts? Leto, this is not you. I thought we'd have more time. Have a good night, Master Paul. Good night, Dr. Yueh. You need to sleep. No. Not like that. I should have married you. Hawat. Security. Security. Sir. Sir. The shield's come down. God in heaven. Get everything with guns off the ground! Go! Go! Go! Go! With me! With me! Atreides! Atreides! - Sardaukar! - Sardaukar! I'm sorry, my lord. But I've made a bargain with the Baron. Why? I had no choice. The Harkonnens have my wife, Wanna. They take her apart like a doll. I will buy her freedom. And you are the price. For Paul. I will do what I can. And you will kill a man for me. I'm going to replace your peg tooth. If you bite down hard, this tooth will crush. Breathe out, and you will fill the air with poison. It will be your last breath. But if you choose your moment well, it will also be the Baron's. Paul. We'll drop them in the desert. Let the worms have them. Why don't we just cut their throats? We could face a Truthsayer. We can say we didn't kill them. The scarred one is deaf. To hell, dogs! I've never had a highborn. You? Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn. She's highborn enough for me. Let's feed the kid to the worms. And give her a long goodbye. Don't you dare touch my mother. Don't talk. Don't! You are not ready. Remove her gag. Shut up. Find the right pitch. We're far enough. Let's throw the boy out. Remove her gag. Kill him. Set us free. Stop! Cut the rope. Give me the knife. Your pitch was too forced. It's a fremkit. They've crippled the ship. Mmm. Ah. You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin. This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting. ""If anyone makes it out of Arrakeen alive, there's an Atreides beacon in the fremkit. God willing, they'll be able to find you."" My lord Baron. Dr. Yueh. The traitor. What do you want? I jammed their comms and lowered their shields. Hmm. I delivered the Duke and his family. The bargain to the letter. And what was I to do for you? Deliver my wife from her agony. Yes. I said I'd set her free. That you could join her. So, join her. What do you think is next? It's a thumper. No stillsuits. The one thing we actually need. For hundreds of years, we've traded blood for blood. But no more. Your son is dead. Your concubine is dead. Tonight the House of Atreides falls. And your bloodline ends forever. What did you say? Here I am... here I remain. Kynes! It's not safe for you here. Will you tell the Great Houses of the Landsraad how we were betrayed? How the best of them were murdered? I am commanded to say nothing. To see nothing. The Emperor sent us here to die. There's spice in the tent. That's the future. It's coming. Holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. Paul, you're scared. I can see it. Tell me, please, what do you fear? Somebody help me, please. Paul. It's coming. I see a holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. A warrior religion that waves the Atreides banner in my father's name. Paul. Fanatical legions worshipping at the shrine of my father's skull. A war in my name! Everyone's shouting my name! Paul. Paul Atreides. You are your father's son. You are my son. You are the Duke Paul Atreides. You know who you are. You know who you are. Get off me! You did this to me! You Bene Gesserit made me a freak! My father is dead. Someone's near. You need to drink. It's recycled water from the tent. Sweat and tears. All right, let's get out of here. That's Duncan. Duncan. My lady. Paul. I'm so sorry. Your father... We know. My lord Duke. Here. Drink this. Harkonnens hit every population center on the planet at once. There must have been 10 legions, hundreds of ships. There were Sardaukar with them. - At least two battalions. - What? Are you sure? You cross swords with a Sardaukar, you know it. So, the Emperor's taken a side. What says the Judge of the Change? The Emperor forbids me from saying anything at all. And yet you risk your life to help us. Storm's coming. The storm will be here in a few hours. We'll be safe here. Do you know what this place is? It's an old ecological testing station. They were meant to tame the planet. Free the water locked beneath the sands. Arrakis could have been a paradise. The work had begun, but then the spice was discovered. And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away. Tanat, will you find stillsuits to fit our visitors? Yes, Liet. Shamir, a coffee service, please. Of course, Liet. Who are you to the Fremen? You know what the Great Houses fear most, Dr. Kynes? Exactly what has happened to us here. The Sardaukar coming and picking them off one by one. Only together can they stand a chance against the Imperium. Would you bear witness? Testify that the Emperor has moved against us here? If they believe me, there would be general warfare between the Great Houses and the Emperor. Chaos across the Imperium. Suppose I presented the Emperor with an alternative to chaos. The Emperor has no sons. And his daughters have yet to marry. You'd make a play for the throne? The Emperor feared the Atreides. He brought you here to kill you. What don't you understand? You're a lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground. The Fremen speak of the Lisan al-Gaib. Careful. The Voice from the Outer World who will lead them to paradise. Superstition. I know you loved a Fremen warrior and lost him in battle. I know you walk in two worlds and are known by many names. I've seen your dream. As emperor, Dr. Kynes, I could make a paradise of Arrakis with a wave of my hand. Do you really think he is the Mahdi? He looks young to me. Sardaukar! No! Duncan! Paul, no! - Duncan, no! - No! - No! - Paul, no! Duncan, no! - He's locked the door. - Duncan! No! He's gone. Duncan! We have to go. We have no choice. Paul, go! Paul! Come on. Come on, come on! Follow the light. You'll find a thopter ready to fly. That storm out there is your best shot. Above 5,000 meters, it's mostly dust. Climb into it. Stay on top. Head south. Find the Fremen. Are you not coming with us? It only seats two. I'll go to the next station and report this attack to the Landsraad. How? I'm Fremen. The desert's my home. Good luck. Good luck. Kynes. You have betrayed the Emperor. I serve only one master. His name is Shai-Hulud. There are jet flares behind us. Paul. We're not high enough! I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings obliteration. See the friend. See the friend. The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve... but a reality to experience. A process that cannot be understood by stopping it. We must move with the flow of the process. We must join it. We must flow with it. Let go. Let go. His healing isn't complete. We chased them into a Coriolis storm. Winds at 800 kilometers an hour. Nothing survives such a storm. They're dead. It's a certainty. So, it's done. Finally. Send word to Giedi Prime to begin selling our spice reserves. But slowly. We don't want the price to fall. You have no idea how much it cost me to bring such a force to bear here. Now I only have one requirement. Income. So, squeeze, Rabban. Squeeze hard. Yes, Uncle. And the Fremen? Kill them all. We're above 5,000 meters. As soon as we land, run for the rocks. And breathe through this. Now we have to find the Fremen. Are you good? Yeah. Paul... Don't be frightened. Even a little desert mouse can survive. Don't be frightened. You'll need to face your fears. A friend... A friend will help you. Follow the friend. You have much to learn. And I will show you the ways of the desert. Come with me. The sietch where Duncan lived is somewhere off that way. I can see greenery over there. There. That means Fremen live there. We'll cross after dark. That's how the Fremen do it. We're about to enter worm territory. We can't walk like regular humans. If we do, we're dead. We'll have to walk like the Fremen do. It's called a sandwalk. At least according to the filmbooks back home. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay. Follow me. Do the same moves. I think this is the right direction. It's close by. Let's get out of here. Wait. It's drum sand. run. Go! Go! It's a thumper. Someone set off a thumper. Paul! Run! How big are they? That was insane. Someone called it. We are not alone. Do not run. You will only waste your body's water. Hold. Stilgar. Hey! You know me. I was there when you came to my father's Council. Oh. This is the Duke's son. Why are you waiting? We need their water. This is the boy I told you about. We can't touch him. How can he be the Lisan al-Gaib? - He hasn't proven himself. - They are weaklings. Jamis. That was a brave crossing they made in the path of Shai-Hulud. He does not speak or act like a weakling. Nor did his father. My thumper saved his life. Go back to reason, Stilgar. He's not The One. We have powerful friends. You help us off-world, to Caladan, you will be well rewarded. What wealth can you offer beyond the water in your flesh? Hmm... The boy is young. He can learn our ways. He may have sanctuary. But the woman is untrained... and too old to learn. back, you dogs. She'll cut my throat. Why didn't you say you were a weirding woman? And a fighter? Conversation ran short. Peace, woman. Peace. I judged hastily. The sun is rising. We must reach Sietch Tabr. The fates of these strangers will be decided there. Until then... they have my countenance. My word is on them. I would not have let you hurt my friends. They say you're the Mahdi. But you look like a little boy. You chose the hardest way up. Follow me. We must go! Give it to me. You will have your own maula pistol when you've earned it. Give it to me. Chani, take charge of the newcomers. See that they are safe on the journey. Let's go. I will not have them. Jamis, I have spoken. Be still. You talk like a leader. But the strongest leads. She bested you. I invoke the amtal. You may not challenge a Sayyadina. Then who will fight in her name? Jamis, don't do this. Don't. The night is fading. Then the sun will witness this death. Where is her champion? I accept her champion. Paul Atreides must die... for Kwisatz Haderach to rise. Don't be frightened. Don't resist. When you take a life, you take your own. I don't believe you're the Lisan al-Gaib. But I want you to die with honor. This crysknife was given to me by my great aunt. It's made from a tooth of Shai-Hulud. The great sandworm. This will be a great honor, for you to die holding it. Where is the Outworlder? Jamis is a good fighter. He won't let you suffer. Chani... Um... Never mind. May thy knife chip and shatter. You should welcome my blade. This world will kill you. Quicker this way. Do you yield? The boy doesn't know our rule. There's no yielding under the amtal rule. Only death is the test of it. - Is he toying with him? - No. Paul has never killed a man. Kwisatz Haderach. Kwisatz Haderach. Climb up. Rise. You're one of us now. A life for a life. Come with us to Sietch Tabr. No. Paul needs to get off-world. You must have ways. You have smugglers, you have ships. - No. - You have... The Emperor sent us to this place. And my father came, not for spice, not for the riches, but for the strength of your people. My road leads into the desert. I can see it. If you'll have us, we will come. Desert power. This is only the beginning. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, In the last years of the Shang Dynasty, Emperor Zhou became a fatuous tyrant. Seeing an opportunity, The Fox Devil, Nine Tailed, transformed herself into Daji, the Royal Consort and took control of the government. The Fox clan brought chaos to the world. Heaven took pity on the people. When at last they rebelled, the Master of Jingxu Hall sent divine reinforcement. Thus the Three Realms were engulfed in war. Jingxu Hall's foremost disciple, Jiang Ziya, set forth to vanquish Nine Tailed once and for all. My love, what have you done? Where are you? Enough! Stop this at once! Jiang Ziya. Aah... Your illusions do not frighten me, Fox Devil! We have the same goal, do we not? Must we quarrel over a single, pitiful dynasty? It is mankind's destiny to serve the Fox Clan forever! I invoke the Suppressing Seal! Malignant spirits. Be vanquished! The war came to an end. For its victory over Emperor Zhou, Jingxu Hall was lauded. The Revered Master bequeathed unto the people gods tasked with the protection of all living things. With the rise of a new Dynasty, there was much to be done. Those loyal to the old order were banished to the icy ruins of Beihai, never to return. For his role in the triumph, Jiang Ziya was celebrated far and wide. It was thought he would lead the new gods. And yet... What'd I say? Why is that rock shaped so weird? When's the last time you've ever seen a rock around here? I'm gonna take a look. Freeze! Things aren't... Whoa! Uh... Ugh... That's no rock. It's one of the Immortals. - Immortals? - Immortals? Behold. Following the Great War, Jingxu Hall let down a stairway to heaven and invited mankind to ascend. The first person to climb it was none other than Jiang Ziya himself. That's how he became a god. I have completed the mission given to me. Jiang Ziya. The Fox Devil you have subdued cannot be permitted to live. As the Three Realms look on. Nine Tailed must be executed. By you. With this act shall you secure your place as leader of the gods. As you are a servant of the people, so shall the disciples of Jingxu Hall be yours to command in upholding Heaven's will. Then so it is done. Kill her! - Kill her! - Kill her! - Kill her! - Kill her! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Nine Tailed. These illusions are fruitless. Your fate is sealed. This is how you end. So loyal. What right does your Master have to presume the will of Heaven? He has saved mankind from your evildoing. Has he indeed? Uh... Very well. Why does he not move to save her? Who is that? You know nothing of the truth. This girl, she's... Jiang Ziya! Do not let her sow the seeds of doubt in your mind! Kill her! Prepare to meet your end! Kill! Kill! Kill! Look out! Her sorcery! Resist the illusion! Stay pure! See me! Take off the mask! Huh? Mark my words, you will be executed! If I die, she dies. Save me. Master, there is an innocent in her clutches! Huh! No, wait! Let her go! Uh... Come on! Get it together! It's been long enough! I want to go home! You have undone the seal. You must be punished. But I saw an innocent spirit within Nine Tailed. Silence! What you saw was a conjuring trick! But is seemed so... Were Nine Tailed loose in the mortal realm... The devastations of the great war would have been for naught. Fortunately, the Fox Devil has been executed. But you are hereby banished from Jingxu Hall! I know what I saw. Jiang Ziya. Master. I have no choice but to seal your divine power and exile you to Beihai until such time as you are no longer in thrall to this wicked illusion. Only then may you return. This job stinks. Emperor Zhou gets to be the God of Marriage, but me? I'm stuck looking after you. I'm a baby sitter! Ah! Four-Alike? No! That's for the three of us to share! Oh, I see how it is! You wanna bite me! Fine! Huh! With a straight hook? This fish is as dumb as you are. What... Oh! You've got to be kidding me. Unbelievable. Look at you. They get to go home, meanwhile we're rooted to the spot! I'll do it! Uh... Wha... I'll break this thing into splinters! Don't test me! Humph! Stop! Do you want to go back to Jingxu Hall or not? Come on! It was all in your head! Um... Nine Tailed played a trick on you. It's like that saying about flies only going for cracked eggs. Not that I'm, you know, calling you an egg or anything... - Go home. - Huh? You deserve better. It's been ten years. This is my punishment. Ugh... You're a damn fool. If it weren't for the Master's orders, I'd be long gone. Four-Alike. Huh? I've got one eye. Two big mouths. Three whole arms. And four legs! You lose! Look at these beauties! - What? - Drink! Bunch of morons. What? You filthy urchin! - Mommy! He's bullying me! - Get back here! Which one of you lowlifes is picking on my child? I'll rip you apart! Excuse me? Oh, oh... Oh. Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! It burns! Stinking devils always causing trouble. Confiscate their weapons! Cowards! Nine Tailed would'a killed ya if you hadn't fled! She'd have taken you lot first! She can smell fear! Says the one who reeks of it! Jiang Ziya? Why is he here? Killjoy. Hmm... Huh... Oh-oh! If it isn't the big shot immortal who got us all imprisoned here! Huh? Excuse me. Humph. Well, hey! At least we're all in this together. Gotta be worse for you, though! Scum of the Three Realms ousted from Jingxu Hall! Oh, that's a good one! The scum of the Three Realms! - Scum! - You hear that? So what if you won the war? You're still stuck here with all of us! Barkeep. How much for rice? My, my. What a rare treat this is. Beihai is on a barter system. The Whip of the Gods would suffice! - What about this? - Hmm... Kunlun moire. Your, associate Shen Gongbao was here earlier, weeping himself silly. Ah. Poor fellow. Forced to trade his earring. Did you two have a spat? Oh now, don't take it to heart. Ha! Life squeezes us one way or another. Get over it and move on, or lay down arms and accept defeat. Sometimes, the only thing standing between us and what we want is admitting we're wrong. What you saw was a conjuring trick! Well. Someone likes making an entrance. Step aside. You're a new face. Tell me, girl, are you looking for someone in particular or just trouble? Just trouble. Is that a fact? Okay, okay! You win! She's good. Strong little one, eh? Huh? I'm looking for a place. It's her. Yeah? And what ""place"" might that be, missy? Somewhere very unique. Where the black flowers bloom. Black flowers? Yeah, sorry. Not ringin' a bell. You seen anything like that before? Interesting. There is only one such place in the Three Realms. Mount Youdu, the traveler's despair! You know what I'm talking about? Where is it? Tell me! - Hmm. - Don't smirk. I know the score. Youdu was once a sacred mountain not so long ago. It's where Emperor Zhou was given the title ""God of Marriage"". Oh, how times have changed. Strange things are afoot. Black flowers thrive unchecked along the mountainside, hiding the path. All who search for it miss the mark. Ah, but lucky for you I just so happen to have a map. And of course, much more besides. I trade in rare beasts, souvenirs, travel essentials... Everything! Yes. There sits Mount Youdu, in all its glory! - Let me see! - Not so fast! Just the other day, a group of downtrodden fox hunters tried to haggle for this item. If one credits their word, the mountain is haunted, by Fox Devils! But.. weren't they driven to extinction? If the Fox Devils have returned, the Three Realms will be thrown into chaos! Such a young thing you are. What business can you have with so frightful a place? That's none of your concern. Is the map for sale or isn't it? I appreciate your fire. But the first rule of negotiation dictates that all goods are subject to inspection! You stay out of this! What sort of despicable operation are you... You tried to trick me! Meddler. What are you doing? Grab the wretch! What the? My inventory! My Jingxu divination stone! No! Wait! That's immortal wine! I've been saving it for years! You don't say? Well, then... It's worth sharing! Huh? - Hey! - Wait I don't... Someone stop her! Hands off! I'll offer a reward! The map! - Someone catch it! - Get the wine! That's a good boy. Just hand me the map. No, no, no! - Spit it out! - What are you... - waiting for? Take her down! - Spit it out right now! Kill her if you have to! Leave her be! Ugh! Very well! I'll do it myself! Fox! Devil! If we hand her over to Jingxu Hall, we're as good as freed! None of you get in my way! Be careful! They'll want the head intact! Down there! I see her! Don't let her get away! Hurry! Huh? Where do you think you're going? - Stop! - Huh? What is... Who are you? Jiang Ziya! Slow down! You're about to cross the boundary! Good thing I can keep up. If you'd left Beihai, you'd be in defiance of the Master. And that would be bad. Really, really bad. Look, all that stuff I said earlier. I'm just trying to help! Hey, whoa! Whoa! Don't do it! I can only return to Jingxu Hall... by first uncovering the truth. Huh? Please! Be reasonable! Ah! He's starved. He's not thinking clearly. Uh... Okay. If I have to cross, then so be... Jiang Ziya's out of his mind. It's freezing. Get him inside. Ha! He's in league with the Fox Devil! Huh? Huh! Who are you? Give that back! Speak. What is your connection to Nine Tailed? How far the mighty Jiang Ziya has fallen. Treating an innocent little girl like a common hoodlum. - Oh, save it! - Murderer! So much for being an immortal. Are all of you this unreasonable? If anyone's connected to the Fox Devil, it's you. So that bracelet? - Is none of your business! - It belonged to Nine Tailed. Why are you wearing it? What are you talking about? It belongs to me! Stop! Nine Tailed! No! Spirit-taming fires, rise! What were those? What do they want with you? Excellent question. How the hell should I know? They've been after me from the moment I woke up. There's more every time. I'm guessing it has to do with my past. I don't really know. The only clue is this bracelet, and the memory of black flowers. Mount Youdu. Sometimes I can see my father. Waiting for me. He can prove I'm not a devil! Do not let her sow the seeds of doubt. You're coming with me to Jingxu Hall! Are you listening? I have to find my father! He has saved mankind from your evildoing. You know nothing of the truth. I have no choice but to seal your divine power and exile you to Beihai until such time as you are no longer in thrall to this wicked illusion. What is this? Who are you? Very well. Let's go. Where? To Mount Youdu. Wait, are you serious? Yes. Are you afraid? A-Afraid? What kind of question is that? And don't act all high and mighty, it's my map! Hey, wait up! That hasn't healed yet? I have something that might help. My secret recipe! It's yours. If you give me a peek at the map. I thought we were friends! I wasn't aware we'd graduated to that. Whatever, it's only a matter of time. We just have to get to know each other. Good idea. - Let's start with you. - Huh? You're not an immortal. So how did you cross into Beihai? Uh... That's kind of personal. - Are you normally this blunt? - Uh... Why I should even trust you? You're dressed like a vagrant. A desperate vagrant. For all I know you see me as a bounty. Huh? Ah! And you see me as a mark. Uh, wait! Okay, okay, okay. You're so arrogant! That tone. Four-Alike, that's enough. Four-Alike? So this is the legendary creature said to move with such grace? Fearsome? Big as the night sky? Makes men tremble? How adorable. Don't antagonize. It left Jingxu Hall on my account. Oh sure. Sounds like a reasonable story. Or maybe it just couldn't cut it in Heaven. Give that back! I was kidding! Four-Alike! Hey, tough guy! How 'bout you control your pet? Ugh! I'll slap a muzzle on that face! Get back here! All right, fun's over! Don't you even! Those are mine! Four-Alike! Ugh! When I get my hands on you! Is that all immortals really are? A bunch of glorified thieves? First the map, now my biscuits. Huh? Stop. Ugh! It's just a stupid wind chime. They're all over the place. Spirits are supposed to be comforted by the sound of bones rattling. Something like that, anyway. Like a consolation prize for being dead. Huh? These are messages from their loved ones. A connection to life. They're a comfort to the living and the dead. The war is over. The Fox Clan has been defeated. The world is healing. Rest in peace, all of you. Sentimental crap if you ask me. Ugh. That sedative knocked me out cold. Okay. Where's the stubborn bastard gone to? He's hurt? Of course, he is! Damn it! ""The Field of the Undying is known far and wide for its trees that don't die, flowers that don't wilt, and springs that don't run dry."" Charming place. Blame it on the Great War. Everything changed. You know, if the heat's getting to you, I'm more than happy to navigate. Thank you, no. Get away! I don't have any food left! Uh, huh? Cut her ears off! Uh... Water. I need water. You can't do anything for him. There's barely enough for you. I'm not letting him die. That's all there is to it. Let go! Stop it! He doesn't deserve saving! Fox! The man's a fox hunter. He only sees me as game. Who came to my rescue when they tried to cut off my ears? Whatever he is, he hasn't harmed you! Just give him the chance! - Don't! - Fine! Have it your way! Follow her. Calm yourself. I only mean to help. Hear me, Five Emperors. Ye benevolent powers that govern the body, heed my command and heal this... The fox is mine, do you understand me? You can find your own on Mount Youdu. Fox Devil. Damn your trickery. Mount Youdu it is. Once upon a time, there was an immortal from Heaven. Sadly, without his map, there wasn't a whole lot he could do. Huh? Ravens. You guys always assume you're in charge. Till I snap your necks! Help! I want to go home! What the... Well, okay then... What is this thing? Move! Get out of here! - Uh... - Take Four-Alike! Go! Ha! Whoa! Come back! Idiots. I told her to get you out of here! Stupid mutt! What are you doing? Quickly, give me the whip! - I'm trying! - Look out! Oh no! The wind chime. Give it the wind chime. Those things, were they human? At one time. Huh? They're lost souls. Those who left home. Died on the battlefield. No graves. No friends or family. No hope of finding their way back. No way home? That's awful. Blame the Great War. Will they be trapped here forever? Quite possibly. There's some hope for them, though. The Swallow. A great beast said to traverse the sky when moved by human grief. When moved by human grief. Jiu. You okay? I have a home and a family. My father's waiting. - I'll find him. - Huh? This will be able to calm your wound. The map. What'll we do without it? Silly creature. Yeah, you're pretty cute. Ha! Uh... Father... Get inside. Devil. He's only a child! Fox Devil! Get her! Don't let her get away! Give him the knife. Let him do it. Cut her ears off! A nightmare? ""May you sleep the sleep of the just..."" That's the most practical chant I've ever heard. Is it like a traditional one? It's not exactly a chant. It's from the Great War. Soldiers used to say it before bed. The Great War. Was Four-Alike part of it? The last time we were here, all this was ocean. Four-Alike crossed it with a single step and shattered enemy ranks. Vanquish Nine Tailed, and the world would be restored. At least that's what we all told ourselves. But it didn't work out that way. The world just fell into greater ruin. You think this place had it bad. You should see where I'm from. Uh, of course, I'm kidding. Actually, I bet you'll think it's beautiful. So, you know, worth the journey. What are the odds your father is still there? Uh... Really wish I could tell you. I haven't been able to remember anything. Not since waking up in the desert. I dream, though. About this doll he made. A little thing. All strung with stones. Just clinking away in the breeze. It was like a windchime. Calling me home. Whenever I'd sneak away, he'd hang it above the front door. The wind would pick up. And I'd follow the sound back. Jiu. In the dream that's what he calls me. And the place where the black flowers bloom? That's where he's waiting. It's not just a dream. It's real. My whole purpose in life. You better believe I'll find him. Huh... It's the Swallow. The restless souls have been called home. The Swallow has given them hope. Shall we go? According to the map the tail of the Milky Way points to Mount Youdu. Now we're friends. Eat up, you'll need it. Impressive memory. Stop sniffing at me. I don't have any more biscuits. Except that one! That one's mine! Give it back! Ugh! ""When you see the Stone Forest, follow Heishui upstream."" The entrance to Mount Youdu must be up ahead. Are you sure? All I see is a bunch of rocks. And dirt. I'm sure. There's more here than meets the eye. Black flowers? We've gotta be close! Watch out! Jiang Ziya! Where the hell do you think you're going? You can't just leave Beihai! Rules are rules! Rules you've now broken too. I had no choice! The Fox Devil was making an idiot of you! - Let's go back before... - I can't go back yet. Wha... I, uh, think you're buddy's about to explode. Jiang Ziya! Your face. That wound should've healed! C'mon, your powers are dwindling. Damn it. Do you wanna die out here? I will return to Beihai... when I have uncovered the truth. Truth about what? She's the girl I found in Nine Tailed clutches. I have to know who she is. Huh? Uh... This is her? - Why are you so an... - Speak! - Put her down! - What are you? You've been possessed. Let go! I don't have to tell you anything! Stubborn, aren't we? - Show me your true form! - Shen Gongbao! Four-Alike! Huh? - Get back here? - Stop! Four-Alike. Where are you? Four-Alike! Huh... Uh... - Uh? - Over here. This way. Father? Is that you? Father! Use your head. How many lives did the Fox Devil destroy? If the truth is so important to you, open your eyes! - Things aren't what they seem! - Bullshit! We've been down this road before! You are hopeless! That which is inescapable we call fate. That which is unbreakable we call love. Father, is that you? ""Father?"" Foolish child, I am not your father. - Humph. Who are you? - Ooh, what a question! I bind the fates of mortals together. I am the God of Marriage! You're deranged! Untie me! As you wish. Your face is so exquisitely familiar. Uh, ah... The Lock of Destiny? You recognize my bracelet? How could I not? It isn't a bracelet. See. It's a very powerful lock. What? It binds two spirits together inexorably. If one should perish, then so shall the other! My beloved consort wore the companion to this very lock on her person, which can only mean the two of you are bound together eternally! When the chain materializes, I'll be able to find her again! Materialize, my love! Jiu! Don't you run away from me! Where are you? Come to me! Son of a... Why do you keep making the same mistakes? You're the Fox Devil that cost my beloved her life! Jiu! Look out! - Sorcery. - You see it now? It's her. She's... Why? Why murder the woman I cherished? Why destroy my kingdom? She did this. It's all her doing. What you see is evil incarnate. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. No one is waiting for you anywhere. I have to find my father. Jiu! Stop! Kill her! Kill her! No. If she dies so will my love! Aah... Jiang Ziya. How long has it been? Nine Tailed. It's you. Didn't the holy device behead you? Jiang Ziya saved me. Let her go! Release her! Ha! My mortal body was indeed beheaded. But as long as my spirit endures taking physical form is simple! Enough! Foul sorceress! No one cares! Where did this precious kitty come from? Watch out! Ten short years. That's all it's taken for you to sink this low, Jiang Ziya. How utterly heartbreaking. Don't you find that sad? Jiu? Oh, forgive me. I should call you Su Daji. My beloved. Behold. The Zu family's eldest daughter. Betrothed to Emperor Zhou. Such a simple human girl. - Wha... - Hmm... What have you done with my father? Think carefully, child. The memory will come to you. Is that you? Uh... Father, what? Go. I crept into your ceremonial carriage and took your shape for my own. And I becamethe Emperor's cherished consort. And yet... This lock was meant to tether you. Binding you to me forever. Your spirit is strong. It escaped, taking with it your former body and a small measure of my power. And now? You must return! Stop! Cursed feline! Hiya! Master? Alas, a lock forged by the Revered Master is not for the likes of you to break. My Power. My Power! Shit! Her power's coming back! Master. The truth... - I have to know. - Don't listen! She wants to confuse you! Don't give credence to her lies! You dare call me a liar? Heaven is meant to protect all living things. Have you any notion of the atrocities committed by your Revered Master? Shen Gongbao! That said. If not for Jiang Ziya's kindness toward one in peril, never would I have had the opportunity to break free. It's a pity you're so mired that truth eludes you. - Let them go. - Don't despair, child. I won't kill you. Jiu! Four-Alike! Conceal. - The lock! - Run! You're not going anywhere! Faster! The lock remains! You cannot hope to save her! There is no escape! The Fox Clan will rise again! - You were right. - Huh? No one's... No one's... waiting for me. Four-Alike, what's wrong! Watch out! Jiu! Four-Alike! Huh... No. Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command. Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command. Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command. Eight Effulgences... Just hold on. What's happening? Four-Alike. Fore-Alike. Where are you? There you are. My love. What is the world coming to, when even you can become a deity? Return her to me. Your consort is as dead as your legacy. Farewell. All these years... people thought you were bewitched. In the end, we were the fools. Jingxu Hall will eliminate Nine Tailed. But if the Lock of Destiny isn't broken. If Nine Tailed dies, she'll die, too, Won't she? I don't get it. If the Master forged it with his own hands, what are we supposed to do? What do we even believe? Why don't we go to the source? I'll speak with him myself and have the lock undone. Appear! They won't lower the stairway for you anymore. Wait. It's too costly! You're not alone in this. Go to them. Find the answer! I seek the Revered Master. Presumption. You were ordered to contemplate your errors. And instead, you chose to leave. You should be punished. Which I accept willingly. But Nine Tailed lives. Her spirit tied to an innocent. The master knows the truth! Silence! You may not pass! If he has nothing to hide then why will he not speak to me? How dare you! Did you fasten the Lock of Destiny? Does Nine Tailed share your blood? Is this the way of Heaven? Would you sacrifice a child? Master. Jiang Ziya. Everything Jingxu Hall does, it does with the sole aim of protecting life. Tell me, please. Why would you have me believe what I saw was a mere illusion? Because the scope of your understanding is small. Your heart is kind. But your compassion, scattered. Your sense of the greater good is skewed. I ordered you to execute Nine Tailed. Not to crush evil, but kindness. Crush kindness? But, what is wrong with kindness? In itself, nothing. But, alas, for gods... Kindness shown to one person only is a sin. One day there will come a time when a god must sacrifice one to save all. Jiang Ziya must return to Beihai immediately. Once his mind is free of illusion. He may return to his rightful place as leader of the gods and protector of the Three Realms. If I fail to save one life, how can I save all? Insolence! You would put one life above all else? They're all connected. Like drops of water. Life is an ocean. In my eyes, Jiu, and all living things, are one and the same. The great war ripped untold soldiers from home and family. I'm ashamed of my role. I no longer want to be a god. To have power. All I want is to save whoever I'm able. I see. You are certain of this? Once the Lock of Destiny is fastened it cannot be undone in the same lifetime. The only answer... Is reincarnation. Escort Su Daji to the Ruins of Return. Let her step into the light and be reborn. Thank you, Revered Master. Is this it? Nine Tailed! Run! Go without me. Shen. - I... - Just go. Do what has to be done. Save her... and come home. Of course. Uh... Don't you want to be a god? No. Go on. You've stood by me long enough. Report back to the master. - Ugh. - Do as I say. I came here without his permission... Jiang Ziya. I used to be so jealous. You were the Master's favorite. Everyone loved you. But I get it now. You didn't become a hero. You've always been one. But this time... it's my turn. Jiang Ziya. Yes? Where are you taking us? To break the lock. You're going to be reborn. Reborn as what? How do you like that? I'm right back at where I started. Empty-handed. When I opened by eyes all I could see were ruins. Whoever I met. Just wanted to hurt me. I tried to tell them... I said I wasn't a Fox Devil. But they wouldn't believe me. In the next life you'll be a perfectly ordinary child. With friends. Family. A father who loves and cares for you. Don't do that. Don't fill my head with lies. I'd never do that. Goodbye. Huh. Jiang Ziya. Thank you... Damn you, Nine Tailed. Let it be finished! The lock has been broken. She is no longer bound to you. Let her... be reborn! Reborn? You're insane! Surely you didn't think I would release her so easily? Stop this! The world must know. People must see what the Revered Master has done! Arise, my fox brethren! Why the hell is my eye twitching? I've had two drinks. Maybe. It's a sign of good fortune! What the? Behold. These are my fox brethren. Thousands of them! Why are their souls restless? Years ago the Master made a promise. He told me I would become a god. But there was a price. I had to bind the Fox Clan to mortals and launch a war that would unite the Three Realms. Little did we know. When all was said and done the master reneged our bargain. He ordered our genocide. We were thrown into the bottomless pit. Never again to see the light. - Never to be reborn. - Oh... We were the true casualties of the Revered Master's ultimate war. I believed him. In a moment of greed, I doomed my own kind! This cannot be. Today, the Revered Master shall know the pain he wreaked upon the Fox Clan. The Three Realms will tremble at the sight of our true power! Ah! Jiu! Release me from this prison! Kill her! Undo the lock. Kill her! Jiu! Whoa! Jiu! Revered Master. We beg you to reconsider! What I do, I do for the greater good. Jiu. I won't. As long as the Lock of Destiny exists, you cannot save anyone. In times to come, others will repeat our mistake. When I'm reborn, will I really have a father who loves me? No one should be denied salvation. Not gods. Not devils. Not mortals. We all deserve to live free from the yoke of oppression. We all deserve the truth. The lock has been undone. Father, Mother. Can we go home now? - Save me. - Release me from this hell. Jiu! Ah... Jiang Ziya. Have I been reborn yet? Don't do that. Don't fill my head with lies. Head Disciple Jiang Ziya has achieved merit by luring out and vanquishing the Fox Devil once and for all. He may now reclaim his place as leader of the gods. One lock remains to be severed. I, Jiang Ziya, herby vow to follow the Master. In everything. To lead the gods, and protect all life. To become a true god. Stand apart. Forge your own path. The Grand Duke has ascended. All deities, fall back. Approach, Jiang Ziya. Kneel before heaven to be cleansed and deified. Kneel! Impudence! There was no choice. The Fox Devil was pure evil. Search your heart. My actions were a gift to the world. Henceforth, may no one lose their home. May no one be deceived. Let injustice... be a thing of the past! You've gone mad! If the stairway crumbles, the world shall be cut off from divine protection! What have you done? And so, Jiang Ziya demolished the Stairway and the Revered Master was punished by Heaven. The Swallow descended and guided restless souls home. Once again, the world saw peace and hope restored. When I grow up, I want to be a hero just like that! Master. Where does the Swallow come from? Where indeed? A place far above even Jingxu Hall. In the great beyond. Where your master's master dwells. Wow. So the master's master is the Revered Master. And the Revered Master's master is... Great Revered Master! Hush! His name isn't for you to say. He is the great deity far above the Ninth Heaven and sends the Swallow to earth. Jiang Ziya sure is amazing! Even the Great Revered Master lent him a hand. As expected of my ""good friend."" Your good friend? You can search all of Beihai and find no one closer to Jiang Ziya than me! Cut the crap. Your only good friend is drink. Hard to believe Beihai is finally at peace.  A bite of biscuit A bite of sweets   Outside Beihai   Yellow fields of wheat   Mother and Father Sitting by my side   Humming a tune As I drift into a dreamland  What are those hanging from the tree? What a pretty sound! I want one for my doll too! Hmm. Speaking of Jiang Ziya, where exactly has he gone? Far outside the Three Realms. To a place known as the City of Tribulation, is said to be a prison built expressly for gods of his stature. My Lord... the Great Revered Master sends us... We've been order to take up posts. PLEASE WAIT, THERE'S A POST-CREDITS SCENE! THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR WAITING! LET'S MAKE UP FOR THE YEAR TOGETHER! Huh! Humph. Ugh. Ugh... Uh... Mm... Mm-hm. Huh? Uh, huh... May you live long! May we meet again when the storm has passed. Wishing you peace and good fortune in the times ahead. ONE WAR TO DEIFICATION <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, Mm. Alert, biodome breach. Alert, biodome breach. Dr. Andrews, did you see that? The habitat's not gonna hold much longer. We need to start thinking about off-site solutions. The island is the one thing that's kept him isolated. If he leaves, Godzilla will come for him. There can't be two alpha Titans. The whole theory of an ancient rivalry stems from Iwi mythology. He's gotten too big over time. This environment won't sustain much longer. It's too unstable. Hey. Off-site would be a death sentence. You don't think the King could take care of himself? There has to be another way. Finding the origin of these creatures is essential to mankind's survival. The interior of the Earth is made up of vast cabins and air pockets, joined by natural avenues. The admiral begins his expedition, searching for an entrance to a hidden world. The purpose is the discovery and the release to the world of the unknown treasures of Antarctica in the interests of all mankind. Members of the lost party were never seen again. Still no word on what may have happened. There's an ecosystem out there, the likes of which we can't imagine. And the place to find it is this island. Hello, loyal listeners. Welcome to TTP, Titan Truth Podcast. Episode number 245. Today is the day. Maybe the last podcast I ever record. And look, I know I said that last week and maybe the week before and a few other times. But, look, this is the point. After five years of deep cover at Apex Cybernetics, I'm finally taking my shot. Something bad is going on here. I don't know what it is, but I'm about to walk in and download hard evidence and expose a vast corporate conspiracy. Yeah, you can call me a whistleblower, but I ain't just whistling. I mean, this is more than a leak. It's a flood. And believe me, this flood is gonna wash away all of Apex's lies. You can believe that. Welcome to Apex Cybernetics. No unauthorized persons allowed beyond this point. When we started Apex Cybernetics, we dreamt of new ways to push past the limits of human potential. Robotics, the human mind, artificial intelligence. Who knows what brave new future we'll dream of next? I'm Walter Simmons, and it is my privilege to lead Apex into humanity's bold new era. We're not going anywhere. And neither are you. There you are, baby. No, don't eat that! It's incredibly unhealthy. It's just all the GMOs. Growing a second head could be useful. You have to let me know. Because me, myself? I can barely handle the one I got. Bernie, you're not supposed to be in here. You ever wonder what we're really doing here? I mean, really doing here. Why are you here? This isn't Engineering. Because, you know, I had to wait because they're rendering these new specs, which is gonna take over, uh... That's calculator mode. ...over one hour, maybe even more. So my foreman told me to just take a walk - and make some new friends. - Oh. Oh! Now that we're new friends, I can share something with you, right? I know it's in here somewhere. This is hand sanitizer that I made from my own garden. It's really amazing. Don't know if I used that or not. Yes. This. Check this out. That right there is radio mesh networking with a voice-record subprocessor. - Guess from where. Come on. - I don't care. A toaster! It's from a toaster. Look at this thing. I have to go to the bathroom. Is it one or two? 'Cause if it's two, it's probably from these apples. Hey, you wanna use the hand sanitizer that I made? I'm good. Okay, I'll just stay here. Okay. Yeah. Ah, let's see. Whoo. Screen. What are they shipping to Hong Kong? What's Sublevel 33? What the...? Evacuation, Titan alert. This is not a drill. All Apex employees, please proceed... That is my cue. That's my cue. This is not a drill. Proceed to the fallout shelter in a single-file line. Let's go! They used cyanide capsules instead of fallout shelters to keep the secrets in, but, you know, that's neither here nor there, so don't listen to me. Level two personnel, this way! Let's go, let's go! Yeah, that way. It's time! We need to go now! Evacuate. One level at a time, okay. - No. - Hey, you! - Where's your clearance tag? - You know what? The fact that you're talking about clearance tags right now in a time of crisis is incredibly unprofessional. We should be talking about evacuation. Yo! Okay! Oh, my God. Oh, no. What the hell is that? This is CNN breaking news. The United States Navy's Fourth Fleet is deployed off the southeastern seaboard of the U.S. after last night's sudden Godzilla attack. A time of relative peace shattered when the massive Titan, once thought to be a hero to humanity, made landfall in Pensacola, Florida. While the damage was largely contained to the U.S. headquarters of Apex Cybernetics, governments around the world aren't taking any chances after the first substantiated Titan sighting in over three years. CEO Walter Simmons had this to say. It's about working together to ensure a safer world. Godzilla's a threat to humanity, and Apex has a plan to deal with it, once and for all. Students and faculty, please be advised a mandatory assembly will be held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon. Guidance counselors will also be holding additional office hours all this week for individual and group sessions. Welcome back, loyal listeners, to Titan Truth Podcast, episode 246. Oh, my God. I was there. Godzilla's Apex attack. I saw it go down! You think it's a coincidence that he reappears and just so happens to destroy that specific facility? Ha-ha, no, no, no, no. No such thing as coincidence. Dad, I'm telling you, there's something provoking him that we're not seeing here. Why else would Godzilla flash an intimidation display if there wasn't another Titan around? That podcast is filling your head with garbage. - You should be in school. - I am just trying to help. I don't want you to help. I want you to stay safe. We needed a plan to keep peace with these things, and the best one we had just went down in flames. I don't have any more. And the last thing that I need is to be worrying about you. Godzilla saved us. You were there with Mom. You saw it. How could you doubt him? - There has to be a pattern. - There doesn't. - A reason why he was provoked. - There isn't. How do you know that? Because creatures, like people, can change. And right now, Godzilla's out there and he's hurting people, and we don't know why. So cut your pop some slack, would ya? See you at home, Dad. You wanna know my theory? I mean, of course you do. That's why you're here. Come on, it's all about patterns and variables. Oh, wait, stick with me. I'm gonna take you back to sixth grade with this, okay? Godzilla attacks when provoked, that's the pattern. Pensacola is the only coastal Apex hub with an advanced robotics lab. That's the variable. And add them up and your answer is that Apex is at the heart of the problem. Can I help you? If you want an appointment, my office hours are nine to five. - Please, Dr. Lind. - What the f... Guys like you and me, we don't do normal hours, do we? I've been fixated on Hollow Earth for as long as you have. Your theory that it's the birthplace of all Titans is fascinating. Your book was very impressive. Oh, yeah? Well, I got about 30 unsold boxes in my apartment if you want some. Walt Simmons. I know who you are, sir. It's an honor. No, the honor is mine. As is the urgency. Godzilla has never attacked us unprovoked before. These are dangerous times, Dr. Lind. Allow me to introduce our Apex chief technology officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa. He has an interesting thing to show you. Magnetic imaging from one of our new satellites. You know what this is, right? Hollow Earth. An ecosystem as vast as any ocean, right beneath our feet. This energy signal is enormous. And almost identical to readings from Gojira. As our sun fuels the planet's surface, this energy sustains the Hollow Earth, enabling life as powerful as our aggressive Titan friend. If we can harness this life force, we'll have a weapon that can compete with Godzilla. I need your help to find it. I don't know if I'm the right guy for the job. Did you read the reviews? ""A sci-fi quack trading in fringe physics."" Look where they put my office. I'm in the basement right across from flute class. Besides, I'm not with Monarch anymore. And Hollow Earth entry is impossible. We tried. I'm sorry about your brother. He was a true pioneer. Thanks. See, all of our forward scans suggest a habitable environment down there. So, what really went wrong on your brother's mission? When they tried to enter, they hit a gravitational inversion. A whole planet's worth of gravity reversed in a split second. They were crushed in an instant. What if I told you that we, at Apex, have created a phenomenal craft which could sustain such an inversion? The Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle. HEAV. We can make the journey to Hollow Earth possible, Dr. Lind. But we need you to lead the mission. Help me. Help everyone. Finding this needle in a haystack is our best shot against Godzilla. Well, I, uh, might have an idea. But it's crazy. I love crazy ideas. They made me rich. Are you guys familiar with genetic memory? It's a theory that all Titans share a common impulse to return to their evolutionary source. Like spawning salmon. Exactly. Or a... Or a homing pigeon. So if this is the Titans' home and this life force sustains them... A Titan could show you the way. Yeah. With a little help of an old colleague. Ugh, where is it? Dr. Andrews, you have a visitor waiting for you at security. Okay. A power source in Hollow Earth? This sounds nuts, Nathan, even for you. It's there! We just need Kong to bring us to it! The second you take Kong out of containment, Godzilla's gonna come for him. You said you can't keep him here forever. No. Our meddling has already wreaked havoc on Kong's habitat. No way am I letting you drag him halfway across the world to use him as a weapon. No, not as a weapon. As an ally. To protect us, lead the way down there. What even makes you think that he'll go in? You always believed that Skull Island was like Hollow Earth come to the surface, right? And that's where Kong's ancestors came from. Mm-hmm. Through the entrance in Antarctica, we could help him find a new home. And he could save ours. Hers. That power source may be our only hope. We gotta stop Godzilla. This is our only chance. We have to take it. - Okay. - Yes! But when it comes to Kong, what I say goes. You name the terms. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. You won't regret this. Mm, I already regret this. Come on. Whoo! Jeez, I can smell him from up here. Well, he can smell you, too. Still not a fan, huh? What's she saying? Just an Iwi expression. It means that you're very brave. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Hey, use a light touch on the sedatives. He's our escort. We can't have him comatose when we reach Hollow Earth. What if Kong doesn't go willingly? What do you do then? Dr. Lind, please report to the forward deck. Dr. Lind. Excuse me. New arrivals. Welcome. Wow. Who's the idiot who came up with this idea? - Ha-ha. - I'm Maia Simmons. My father sent me. I run point for Apex. Nathan Lind, mission chief. Yeah, don't worry. I'm just here to babysit. The Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicles are on their way to Antarctica as we speak. I know you people think you're cutting-edge, but these prototypes we're loaning you will make what you've been flying look like used Miatas. I love Miatas. Forget about the price tag, which is obscene, of course. The antigravity engines alone produce enough charge to light up Vegas for a week. Feel free to be impressed. Wow. All right, we'll be at the Antarctica entry in 48 hours. This path will get us into Hollow Earth. Once we're inside, Kong should lead us to the power source. Now, the gravitational inversion will be quite intense. Our best guess is that on entry, it'll feel like bungee jumping... with the cord tied to your lower intestine. But if your helicopters are as good as you say... HEAVs. If your HEAVs are as good as you say they are, I believe we can do this. They'll do the job. You just gotta do yours. Excellent. Dr. Andrews. We've avoided all of Godzilla's known territorial waters according to your guidelines. Good. Do I need to be concerned? Yes. They do have a way of sensing threats. And we believe that they had an ancient rivalry. The myths say that their ancestors fought each other in a great war. So if they meet again, who bows to who, is that it? No, I spent 10 years on that island studying him. I know this for sure. Kong bows to no one. Is she supposed to be out there? Jia, come on. Come on. Did the monkey just talk? Okay, class, listen up. In the midst of Godzilla's attack on Apex Pensacola, I found some crazy tech with no official classification. What I saw doesn't match any of the engineering specs I've ever seen. So what are they working on in such blackout secrecy, hmm? This could be the thread that finally unravels the Apex sweater of conspiracy. You better believe I'm gonna keep tugging. For now, I'm secure. Anonymous and hiding in plain sight as I continue my mission. To be clear, my brother can never know we took his van. Josh, to be clear, even if we got into an accident, I don't think he could tell. No, no, my brother would never let you drive either. My mission, my wheel. I just don't think it's a good idea, looking for some secret weirdo off the Internet. I mean, we just had an assembly about this. He's not a weirdo. He's a covert investigator. And he's the only one looking for the truth about Godzilla and Apex. So let him look. Why do we have to help him? Because... If we don't, nobody else will. Are you coming or not? Obviously I'm coming. It's stuck. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Mind control. Read up on it, sheep. Psionic link technology is a reality. That's right. One brain controlling another. Oh, man. Imagine that on a global scale and Apex is invincible. We've been listening to this weirdo for hours. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Knock it off! Wait, this is the part I was telling you about. ...need special UV to even know you've been marked! One or two gallons won't cut it. I need my bleach in bulk! Because spy dust is real, people! I mean, come on, invisible to the naked eye... That's how we find him. - The bleach. - Bleach? He consumes a ton of bleach. He drinks bleach? Showers with it. Oh! Yeah, I shower with bleach. No, what? Prevention against organic tracking technology. See? Tradecraft. Would've made more sense if he just drank it. Come on, just one more place. Madison, this is getting old. Hey, you sell bleach? Is this another one of those Internet challenge things? When I sold those kids those detergent pods, I didn't know they were gonna eat them. I'm still dealing with the lawsuits from that. Look, we're looking for a guy who works for Apex Cybernetics. Buys a lot of bleach. Like every night. He's probably paranoid, high-strung, doesn't like daylight. You know, has a lot of crumbs in his beard, if he has a beard. Okay, look, you kids want some candy? Because I can help you with candy. Look at me in the eye. Okay? I need information. Yeah, we want lots of candy. What are you doing? You think...? Oh, you mean Bernie. Yeah, I know that guy. He buys, like, a ton of bleach. I know where he is, too. If you buy a live fish, I'll give you his address. Bernie? Mister... Mis... Mister Bernie not home. Yep, that was definitely Mister Bernie. Yeah. Um... Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk about Apex and Godzilla. No. No. No. I... I got your faces. I contact authorities. Yes. For knocking on a door? No. No. Bernie, you don't trust the authorities. My name is Madison Russell. My father works for Monarch and my mother was... Emma Russell, right? Before we go any farther, I got one question. Tap or no tap? No tap. - Excuse me, what is ""tap""? - Water. They put fluoride in it. Learned it from the Nazis. Theory is it makes you docile, easy to manipulate. Oh, I drink tap water. Yeah, I kind of figured that. But she does the thinking for both of you, so it should be all right. - Thanks. - Okay. What you got? I believe Godzilla's most recent attacks haven't just been random. I think he targeted the Apex facility. I'm of the same opinion. But why? What is Apex up to that's provoking him? For five years, I embedded myself inside this company, trying to figure out what their game was. Then, last week... I saw this. A manifest of huge cargo being sent from here to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong, which makes no sense because we are not equipped for heavy shipping. - Then what? - And then boom! Godzilla shows up. Caved in half the facility, but I got a sneak peek at some suspicious tech which was hidden in a secret bunker. I mean, some pretty damn suspicious tech. Yeah, but what is that? That's, um... That's Katzunari single malt whiskey. Yeah, but it's in a gun holster. It was a gift from my Sara. You have a Sara? She was my wife. Um, she passed on. She was my rock. My truth. I'll tell you something, the day that this goes empty, that's the day you know I've given up. Bernie. I think we can help each other. Okay, I guess now that we're a team, I feel like we should come up with a plan. We're breaking into Apex. - Wait, what? - You heard her. Tap water. Shit. Hey. Thank you. How is she? Calm. So calm, it's scary. That was extraordinary. I have been signing the alphabet. Basic commands. I thought that he showed recognition, but he never... Do you have any idea how long they've been communicating? No. I knew that they had a bond. He trusts her. Without her, he'd be tearing the ship apart. You know, Jia's parents were killed on the island. When the storm took over the island, it wiped out the native people. But Kong saved her. She had nowhere to go. So I made a promise, then and there, to protect her. And I think that in some way, he did the same. Do you think he would take directions from her? No. If we have someone who can keep the reins on Kong... Yeah, no one can keep the reins on Kong. And she's a child. I know Jia is only a child. But she's the only one he'll communicate with. And we need Kong to find that power source. The world needs him. What's she saying? Godzilla. Did we change course? No. We're nowhere near the areas you flagged. It looks like he's coming for us anyway. He's not coming for us. Him? Then dump him. Dump the monkey! How about we throw you off instead, huh? We have to release him. If we lose Kong, the mission is over. He's a sitting duck out there. We have to let him protect himself. And us. Oh, my God, Jia! Nathan? He needs our help. There must be some way to disorient Godzilla. Depth charges. He's circling back. This won't end until one of them submits. - Shut it down. - What? All of it. Guns, engines. - Shut it down. Right now. - If we do that, we're dead. No, we're playing dead. And we're making him think that he's won. Cut the power. Cut the engines. Kill anything that makes a noise. This better work. As soon as we move, he'll be back. How are we supposed to get the rest of the way? How's Kong with heights? So, what's the plan? We find out what's on Sublevel 33. Ow. Keep it moving, tap water. Go ahead. All right, Mad Hatter. Down the rabbit hole. Okay. We got this. Oh, my God! Are you sure we can trust this guy? Yeah, why? Well, mainly because he says crazy shit all the time and carries a bottle of whiskey from his dead wife like a gun. I think it's romantic. Whoo-hoo! I really don't understand women. Okay, come on. This whole thing came down, and there was this... eye. Uh, what are we looking at? No, no, no, no. No, it was here. I swear to God, it was... it was right there. Hey, guys. Anyone know where this leads to? You believe me, right? 'Cause I know that there was something here. I'm gonna get a migraine from that torch. ""Sublevel."" How deep does this thing go, Bernie? Hell. Goes to hell. Sublevel 33. Maglev shuttle departure to Roswell, New Mexico at 0900 hours. Whoa. What is all this? It's breakaway civilization. I mean, come on. This is page one in the Apex-playing-God handbook. Huh? I mean, the Illuminati running shadow economies all to fund a hidden colony for the elite in case any of these governments and megacorporations accidentally hit the doomsday button. It makes sense - if you think about it. - Yeah, sure. - Someone's coming. - What? - Someone's coming. - What? - Someone's coming? - Yes! Oh, my God. - They look like eggs. - Skull-crawlers. What's Apex doing with skull-crawlers? All right, let's load it up! What was that? What was that? No way. No, no, no. Come on. Okay, guys, I think we're moving. It says we're headed to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong. - What? - Hong Kong. That means that we're gonna get some answers. G10, clear for launch. Here we go. We're getting close! It's not working. Just wait. Wait, wait, wait. What if she tells him there are others down there like him? But you don't know that. We lost our entire fleet getting here. There's no way back for him. And he can't survive here. All right. All right. Hey. He's going. Prepare to launch! Everybody to their station. We gotta go. All flights crews cleared for immediate HEAV launch. HEAV 1 online. We're clear for launch. Copy that, HEAV 1. HEAV 2 online. Exiting hangar now. HEAV 2, confirmation 4055. This is HEAV 3 online, launching now. We'll follow him from behind. There. There he is. Are you sure the monkey's gonna survive this? Oh, he'll be fine. It's us I'd worry about. We're about to be launched 1,000 miles in two seconds until gravity inverts itself and spits us into free fall. It'll be the most amazing thing you've ever seen. Here. For the vomit. What? Engine failure, gravity low. Engine failure. All Delta, reverse gravity propulsion! It's beautiful. This is HEAV 3, we're getting some strange radar activity. We're gonna circle back and... All Delta, prepare to attack! That's gross. Kong's on the move. We gotta go. Well, he seems to know where he's going. Oh, he certainly can move. Okay, okay. Creepy monorail is slowing down. Attention: Shipping pod arriving. Okay. Keep quiet. Follow me. We're going in? Yeah. Oh, no! Every time, I swear. Doors hate us. Oh, yeah. - Aah! - Oh, my God! It's just so massive. It's so stupid. So, what is this place? Well, if there's a corporate-friendly term for ""sacrifice pit,"" I'd say we are in it. Oh, God, that stinks. That's not good. Bernie! I really hate this place. Attention: Demonstration in T-minus one minute. All personnel are to stay clear of the area. Mr. Simmons, systems are coming online now. Commence uplink. Engaging uplink. Pilot engaged. That's robot Godzilla. Oh, no. That's... That's Mechagodzilla. Release number 10. Go, go! Go through there! Madison! Run, girl! Yes! Damn it. System only reached 40% power. Oh, I know. As expected. Don't worry. Once the Hollow Earth sample is uploaded, our power troubles will be over. If they can find the source. Oh, they'll find it. I have faith in my daughter. I have faith in our creation. And humanity will once again... be the apex species. This is why Godzilla attacked the Apex facility. They're trying to replace him. Come on, Maddie. Sir, Godzilla just made an abrupt change in direction. He's moving very fast. Projections show he's likely headed to Hong Kong. Transport is ready and waiting to take you there, sir. That has to be it. We were right. He's home. All personnel must display their Apex employee badge at all times. Follow me. Lizard people build all their facilities the same way. I can find the exit. The exit's this way. Guys. Madison! Oh, my God. Bitch, what? It's a Titan skull. No, no, no. That's not just any Titan. That's Monster Zero. Ghidorah. They hardwired its DNA. Self-generating neural pathways capable of intuitive learning. Okay, I'm smart, but I only go to high school. - It's a living supercomputer. - Shh. It had three heads. Its necks were so long, they communicated telepathically. And there's one here and another one inside of that thing. Yeah, it could be a psionic interface. Oh, my God. Careful. It's a pilot. Yeah. He's in a trance. That's a psionic uplink. It follows his will. Oh, Apex, what have you done? This is the day we feared. I've given the order, Doctor. The city is being evacuated. I don't understand. He led us here. Where is it? What is he doing? It's the axe. It's drawing radiation from the core like it's charging. Whoa! Godzilla's responding! They found it! What in the hell? What are you doing? Extracting a sample. This is a power beyond our understanding. You can't just drill into it. Actually, we can. My father gets what he wants. That's Apex property now. What? Energy signature incoming. We should be able to recreate it soon. That is the discovery of the millennium. - You can't strip it for parts. - Hold it. Go. Go. Got what we needed. Let's go! Yes. Mr. Serizawa, start your engines! The upgrade is untested. Once we get online, Gojira will come straight for us. He's been coming for us since our creation first awoke. - We must embrace it. - We shouldn't rush this. We have no idea how this energy source will affect the Mecha. Get in the goddamn chair. - Go, go, go! - Come on, come on! Move! What are you waiting for? Let's go! This way, sir! Hurry! We gotta get back... Okay. Get him out of the way! Shoot him! Go, go, go! Oh, no. No, no, no... Oh, Jesus! Come on, let's go! - Hold on, ladies. - Yeah. Whoa. Stay low. Yeah. Going viral. What? We've gotta try and stop this. Mm-mm. I don't like this, guys. If this wasn't contributing to world destruction, this would be a great DJ booth. I know what it... Maintenance. Madison, we should go. I'm Maintenance. You don't have to alert the... She doesn't buy that. Uh, Madison, we need to go. The woman with the villain hairdo... Madison, they have guns. Hey, guys. Uh, it's soundproof so I can't really... - I wanna communicate... - Open the door! Say again? Oh, God! Get down! Get down! Oh, shit! We're about to breach the veil! Hold on! Looks like round two goes to Kong. Hey! Oh, come on, guys. Really? Greenpeace again? Greenpea... Actually, sir, not like you would know this, but I'm Level Two Assistant Engineering... Well, Provisional Level Two Assistant Engineering, not like you would know that. My evaluations were incredibly encourag... I'm just saying Greenpeace wishes, is all I'm saying. Where do I know you from? Oh, my goodness. Director Russell's daughter, yes? You caused all of this. If by ""all of this,"" you mean I, and I alone, have given humanity a chance against the Titans, then, yes, I will own that title. Godzilla had left us in peace. You provoked him into war. There can only be one alpha, Miss Russell. It seems to have been providence. It's time to launch. Begin pilot integration. And now... my Mecha. It's not only Godzilla's equal... but his superior. The Apex Titan of my own hand. It's time to show the world what you can do. Pilot engaged. Alert: Failure. System unstable. Alert: Failure. System unstable. This is how we, as a species, win. You see, 10 years ago, when Gojira was first revealed to the world, I had a dream. And in that dream, I saw one thing. And that beautiful, amazing thing was... Oh, shit. No! It's unfair. I really wanted to hear the rest of that speech. What in God's name is that? It's thinking for itself now. We have to warn Monarch. Or try to stop it ourselves. That thing's still linked to their satellite. Wait, Josh. If I can figure out the password, maybe we can shut it down. All right. What the hell is that? What? What's happening? She can feel his heartbeat. He's dying. There's nothing we can do to restart his heart. We'd need a charge big enough to... Light up Las Vegas for a week. Is that a password? Is that a password? I don't know! I'm not used to this. I'm used to pirating movies online. Okay, then go to Settings. - This is Mark. - Dad? Madison, where are you? Dad, can you hear... Can you hear me? I'm in Hong Kong. - Mad? - Dad! Mad? Madison! A-ha! Okay, you two better get some distance. Hey. You are a very brave little girl. I don't know. Maybe we both are. Okay. Good luck, big fella. I thought you said you were a hacker! I said I took an HTML course at summer camp. - HTML? - Yes, at summer camp. Was it a '90s camp? Come on. Use QWERTY. Error. Security lock. No. Shit! Shit. Josh! You have to do something. We tried to take down those Apex bastards, but I think this is as far as we go, so bottom's up. I was hoping to die with adults, but okay. If you've never had a drink before, now's the time 'cause... Drink. Drink! Hey! What are you... That's your solution? I gotta die here with you, and sober! - Yeah! - Yes! Yes! Hey, Nathan? Nathan? Nathan, are you okay? Dad? Dad! Dad! Hi. Um, it was, um... Madison's idea. Shut up, Josh. Dad. This is the man who saved our lives. Bernie, meet Dad. Dad. Uh, Bernie. Um, it's an absolute pleasure to meet you. I was wondering if I could invite you onto my podcast to talk about the Monarch facility in Roswell because... It's amazing. It happened... Jia? Jia! Heads up, guys! He's coming around for his morning walk. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, All legends are born in truth. From the Amazon came the legend of the Tears of the Moon. A single petal from the great Tree could cure any illness and break any curse. Over the centuries, many expeditions went searching for the Healing Tears of legend. None more famous than that of the conquistador Don Lope de Aguirre, who was determined to possess the Tears' power. But the jungle protected the Tears. History will tell you his journey ended in failure. But legend tells more. That he was found by the Guardians of the Tree and nursed back to life. That he demanded they give him the sacred Arrowhead, the key to finding the Tears of the Moon. That Aguirre attacked. But the jungle defended, and Aguirre and his conquistadors were taken, cursed, never to leave sight of the river again, unable to leave or die... ...or so the legend goes. ""We know they disappeared here, ""in the region of Lgrimas de Cristal, ""and it is here that we will find the true source of the legend, ""a tree that possesses unparalleled healing powers. ""My esteemed colleagues..."" ""...I assert that the famous legend ""of the Tears of the Moon is not a myth - ""but scientific truth."" - ...but scientific truth. ""One that could revolutionize modern medicine, ""curing illnesses that not only scourge our cities, ""but cut down more of our soldiers in the trenches than German bullets. ""I have come here today to request access to your exclusive archives..."" ""...including an ancient Arrowhead ""recently recovered from the lost expedition of Dr. Albert Falls. ""The Arrowhead represents the missing piece ""that will finally unlock the location ""of, pause for dramatic effect, the..."" ""The Tears of the Moon."" And you made your request, Mr. Houghton, and the answer remains, emphatically, - ""no."" - Hear, hear. Our archives are the providence of legitimate scholars, - not inspired amateurs. - Hear, hear. Be that as it may, since I have your attention, would you at least allow me to, uh, continue with my, uh, examination of how important the Tears of the Moon could be to medicine? - Hello. - Hello. - Shaka Zulu. - Yes. Through one simple act of innovation, he came to dominate all his enemies from the... There was that, but also the encirclement tactic. You are not where you ought to be. Yes. You're right. Uh, I think I... The secretaries' gallery is that way. Thank you so much. A cure for all ailments, whether it be consumption, diphtheria, dengue fever, yellow fever, hay fever, fever fever... All fevers, um, would be covered. Excuse me. Yes? This area is for Society members only. - Is it? - Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry about that. Well, to be quite frank, I've no idea how you even... Mr. Houghton, we granted you an audience in deference to your late father. This, however, seems remarkably like a paper I had the honor of refusing when it was submitted by a female writer, a Dr. Lily Houghton. No relation, I take it? None that I've ever agreed to. Shall we help you find your way out? Here we are. It's in the first crate of the lot. And thank you so much for your very generous contribution, in solid gold bars, I might add. Would make life so much simpler if more people paid in gold. I don't want the whole lot, just one thing. Seems someone got to it before me. Um, they shouldn't have. I'm sure it's all there. It must have just slid somewhere. Let's... Let's see. It was definitely there. - Stop her! - Oh! Hello. I just wanted you to know, this is a Nguni assegai. It's been mislabeled as ""Zulu."" Grab her! Oh. Wait! The end of the line. Get down! - Oh, my God! - No, no, no! Good day, sir! You think you're the first to eject me? I have been turned out of some of the best clubs in Europe! Oh, my gosh! Frulein, give me that box and I will help you up. - Stop! Stop! - You are slipping! Fare, please. Can I put it on a tab? You shipping out, lads? Ha-ha! Bravo! I think I speak for the entire Society when I offer my most sincere apologies to you, Prince Joachim. You just told them my name. Oh. Oh. It is Prince ""Joachim."" Joachim. - Good. - Now, Prince Joachim, we could refund your money from the... You keep that money, and you tell me, who is that woman? I don't... I do know who that was. Breaking and entering, grand larceny, and worst of all, forced to take public transport. Should I be concerned about you? Why would you say that, MacGregor? This is a petal that could heal all, save countless lives, change the world. Haven't you been dreaming about another adventure? If I wanted to go to a primitive backwater where I can't understand a word anyone's saying, I'd visit our relatives in Scotland. Barely got over that hideous trip with Father to Bhutan. You only lost two toes. - I was seven. - Then just stay here. You can. You can just stay here. Don't worry about me. All alone, in the Amazon. But who'd look after you? Well, I have no idea. Come on, cheer up. Steamer to Brazil, rail to Porto Velho... ...then all we need is a skipper. First of all, let me congratulate you on your excellent choice of skipper. Of all the jungle cruises you could take in the Amazon, this one is undoubtedly the cheapest. But also the most thrilling. Are you still giving a tour? Yes, I am. - Perhaps a refund? - No refunds. We should've taken the other cruise, honey. Told you. Skipper! Skipper? Skipper! I think you should see this! Heads up! Coming through! - Where were we? - About to die. Ah. Skipper! Sir? Sometimes these buttons get stuck. Skipper! All right. If you look to the left of the boat, you'll see some very playful toucans. They're playing their favorite game of beak-wrestling. The only drawback is, only two can play. There's two birds, and those are toucans. I'm saying that only ""two can"" play. Not one, but ""two can"" play. Wow. The rocks you see here in the river are sandstone. But some people just take them for granite. It's one of my boulder attractions. You know, before this, I used to work in an orange juice factory, but I got canned. - Oh... - Couldn't concentrate. Oh... Yeah, they put the squeeze on me, too. That's a good one. I should've opened with that one. You know, they say the boa constrictor right there is capable of eating up to 500 pounds per sitting. Personally, I find that very hard... to swallow. Mommy, can you please make him stop? No one can. And don't interrupt me like that again. I will feed you to the boa. She is a small child. He loves small children. Close your mouth. Hey! Hey! Hands in the boat! Know this about the jungle, everything that you see wants to kill you. And can. Poison angel's trumpet. Strychnos. Curare. Banana spider. Marauders, dead of fever, for never finding the Fountain of Youth. Adventurers, stung by stingrays, searching for cities of gold. Conquistadors, cursed, for slaughtering innocent natives. And then there's the ones that just got eaten by the deadly hippopotamus. But hippos aren't native to the... Shh. Look out! This is the highlight of the tour. It's my favorite part of the jungle. Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the eighth Wonder of the World. Wait for it... The backside of water! It looks just like the front side. It's completely different. It's the eighth Wonder of the World, the backside of water. Guys, get your cameras out, come on. You don't wanna miss this. Snap, snap, snap. Keep snapping. I hope those aren't the Puka Michuna, the deadliest hunters in the hemisphere. They hunt humans! Come on. Please, go faster. Oh, any faster would damage my engine, and I can't afford a new one. Grazie. Prego. All right, listen up, I get paid by the number of people I take out, not by the number of people I bring back. Hold on! Ah. Be a good chap and, uh, take care of the luggage. Told you not to wear trousers. Drawing unnecessary attention. I don't care in the slightest. Hello. Well, folks, you were all outstanding today, now I need you all out, standing on the dock. That means ""get off my boat."" I'm only serious. Au revoir. Ma'am, don't forget - to collect your baggage. - Thank you. I'm only kidding. He's behind you. Adis. Make sure you take care of Zaqueu, he's a good kid. He looks 10, but he's secretly 47. Thank you, sir. Look, how stunning. Did you make these? Beautiful. Oh, that is awful. Excuse me, I just think that you... Let's not start a fight with a monkey vendor. I'm not going to start a fight. They clearly shouldn't be in cages. Oh, my gosh! Look, there's the boats! Look, look, look! Right. I think we've earned ourselves some nice lunch at the hotel, then a bath and a cocktail. We did not travel half the globe for baths and cocktails. We must find this Mr. Nilo and secure our travel. Come on! Frank owes me money. Buongiorno, Frankie boy! Please don't call me that. Hey, Frankie, you know what today is? Frank owes me money. It's the third Tuesday of the month. My money, Frank. My contante. Where is it? Oh, you mean this money? It's all here. I just need this, so I can finally eat this week. The rest  per te. You insult me, Frank. This is not all of my money. This is like a little pinky toe, nothing... Itty-bitty, little nothing of my money, Frank. You borrow money from me to get a new engine, well, you got to pay me back, plus interest. Yeah, I'm going to keep your engine for now. I get 5,000 real in one week, then you get it back. I don't get my money in one week, then I keep your whole boat. What do you want my boat for? You have nice boats. You have all the boats. Not yet, I don't, Frank. But I bet you I will. I'm gonna guess, by next week. Arrivederci, Franco. Ugh, what fresh hell is this? Oh, I love it! Excuse me, um, do you know Mr. Nilo... Classy clientele. Home again, Rosita. Mmm. Hey! Perhaps I should search for Mr. Nilo elsewhere. There's always a chance he's at the hotel bar. Fine. But be quick about it or I'll leave without you. Oh, that option is becoming increasingly desirable. Excuse me. Um, Mr. Nilo's office? Upstairs. Thank you. Obri... Obrigada. How you doing? Mr. Nilo? Hello? Frank owes me money. Ah, there you are. I was hoping we might have a small business chat. Not a good chat time right now. But if you came back first thing tomorrow morning, lots of available chat then. No, I would much prefer now. My name is Dr. Lily Houghton, and my brother and I are looking for passage upriver, and I'm told that you are the man for the job. - You were told wrong. - That's impossible, because you come... ...highly recommended. I have an idea. Please go away. Mr. Nilo, your name is plastered all over the boats outside. I think you're being a bit unreasonable. You're the one trying to break down my door. I have a lot of money. Oh. - You're insistent. - It's been said. Now, we're headed upriver, in the direction of the Peruvian Andes. This region doesn't really have a name on the conventional map, but it was once known to some as Lgrimas de Cristal. You're wearing pants. Trousers. And yes, as are you. Do women in England do that now? Well, we're not in England, last time I checked. Now, look, as shocking as the pants are, I'd really... Frank owes me money. Frank owes me money. Frank owes me money. - Can I get you a drink? - Who's Frank? - I have no idea. - I will have a little something. - Spritzer, I assume? - I'll have whatever you're having. So, do you know the region, Mr. Nilo? Well, if it's on the Amazon River, I know it. And, lady, I could tell you, of all the places in the world you can go, the last place you wanna go is Lgrimas de Cristal. Oh, but I do. And I will. Oh, but you won't, Pants. You can't get there. Nobody can get there. And if they could, they wouldn't. It's not a fun vacation. Well, I'm not here for a vacation. Where'd you get the map? Isn't it extraordinary? The detail and the care he took. It was drawn by Aguirre's cartographer. And it belonged to my father, who used to tell me all about the Tears of the Moon when I was a little girl. So, that's why you wanna go? Your daddy's bedtime stories? Look, can you get us there or not? Or has this just been a colossal waste of my time? I could get you there, but you have to consider the dengue fever, anaconda, plus, look, lady, that's the home of the actual Puka Michuna. They're the ones that like to eat you and wear your eyes for beads. Look, lady, I gotta be honest with you, let's do something that's safe. So, me, you, and your pants, we can go for a ride around town. That'd be fun. I'll show you some waterfalls. You look like you like waterfalls. And I'll also show you the herd of pygmy elephants we just found. Let's go see some elephants. - I lost my key for that thing. - Did you? I did. Well, that's never gonna do it. You're gonna hurt yourself. Those are very sharp. Mr. Nilo, I spent my childhood playtime with the toddler pickpockets of Delhi, so... There we go. Allow me to manage my own safety, if that's all right. Now, shall we negotiate a price? Or shall I just cast about for another skipper? Two beers, two steaks. Who's paying for all this? Oh, Mr. Nilo insisted it was his treat. That's right. I consider 5,000 real more than adequate. 10,000, I take you there myself. I am my best captain. Oh, and your most modest. Fine, 10,000. 10,000 to bring you there alive. If I have to bring you back dead, it's 15,000. Why should I pay more dead? Dead, I'd have to carry you. Dead's a lot harder, lady. 20, dead or alive. Okay, but I get paid in full when we turn back before Lgrimas de Cristal. Why ever would we be turning back? Well, you're gonna beg me to turn back, first sign of the rapids. Well, I look forward to disappointing you. Lily, look who I found at the hotel bar. - Ah! - Mr. Nilo. Buongiorno, signorina. He drives a hard bargain, but he met his match with me. Negotiated him down to 50,000. Who's your friend? Not Mr. Nilo. - Not Mr. Nilo, no. - No. So, I suppose that would make you... Enjoying your meal, Frank? As in, ""Frank owes me money,"" Frank? Of course. It's all making perfect sense. I suppose it's only a scam if you fall for it. Well, thank you, Mr. Frank. I hope we never meet again. Mr. Nilo, hello. - Did you just whistle at me? Eh, scusa. - Aren't you missing an engine? Signorina, he could not get you as far as the outhouse. In fact, his boat kind of looks like an outhouse. You're never gonna find a faster boat in the harbor than La Quila. Plus, she has the finest bath in all Brazil. Why should I trust you? I'm the only one that could get you there. Oh, my gosh! Careful. They can smell fear. I am not afraid. Might be me. Warm, liquid fear. Shoo. Everybody stay calm! - A little bit more fear just came out. - Shut up! Ouch. He did it! Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Frank Wolff. Jungle Navigation. Best rates in town, completely jaguar-free. Thank you. You are a lot of things that I don't really care for. But you are capable, so, - Nuh! 12. Half now, half upon return, alive, and if we have a deal, I'll meet you at the docks with our luggage. - We have a deal. - Good. La Quila will be ready first thing in the morning. Oh, no, ""Frank owes me money,"" we're gonna depart in 10 minutes. No, it gets dark in two hours. Does it? We should probably leave in 10 minutes. Good decision. Not now. I said, not now. Come here. You did good, Proxima. You're a good girl. You were a little late, and you bit me way too hard. But you did good. Jungle doesn't care how pretty your dresses are, you're never gonna get all your luggage on my boat. Not mine. Mine. And, I assure you, every one of these items is entirely necessary for my survival. Well, with all this extra added weight, we'd be lucky to even get out of the harbor, so, no. Dinner without a dinner jacket is hardly, well, dinner, is it? Now... be a good chap. What're you gonna do with those birds? We're gonna stuff them and send them to Paris. No, you're not. How much? What on Earth do you think you're doing? Hey! MacGregor! That will need to be retrieved immediately. Help, MacGregor! MacGregor! No. Those are my tennis rackets. It's a river cruise. - Assorted day wear and shoes? - No. Light reading and bathing costumes? Good. - The liquor? - That one can stay. Now, listen here, you buffoon, if you scuttle any more of my luggage, I will... Gosh, there's a lot of you, isn't there? - Yeah, there is. - Lily? Lily? Hey! - Nilo! He's got your engine! - Oh, we gotta go. Not without my sister. Come on. Get your stuff. Let's go. Lady! Let's go. I am not leaving without my toiletries. Shut down that engine! Okay, time to leave. Why are they chasing us? I have no idea. Here's the English woman. Pay up. Lily. Turn starboard. Resume heading. What? I don't know what that means. Lady, look, we gotta... Oh, God, sorry, Frank. It's all right. Strong form. Frank, follow me. Don't go up there. It's that way. Lady, it's that way. Lady! Leave the monkeys. The monkeys are fine. Don't go up there. - Lady, stop! - Not now, Frank! How you doing, Pants? I'm good. You know, I was trying to tell you about the... - I know. - Come on. No. Come on! Lady, jump! What are you waiting for? There they are! - Where's Lily? - There. Of course she is. Okay. Come on, lady. Tucking in a spot of sightseeing? How nice of you to join us. Why didn't you jump in the water? - I don't wanna talk about it. - She can't swim. You booked a river cruise and you can't swim? I have no intention of swimming. And what about the 20 guys chasing us around town? I may or may not have something in my possession that may or may not be of interest to other interested parties. Shh! I assume she escaped your grasp, Axel. Yes, your excellency. Then I'll take care of it myself. The Tree is the key to Germany winning this war. The Arrowhead will show us the way to the Tree. We cannot let it leave this harbor. Surface! - Who are those guys? - Oh, my gosh. The price just went up. Batten down! Come on! - What happened? - We lost all power. Lady... Reload! I need you to take the wheel. No, no, no. I am an excellent driver. Anyone but you. Starboard. - Quick, before he reloads. - You missed... Understood. - It's all yours. - Oh, thank God! Frank... You steal my engine? Get off my dock! It's private property, Frank. You're finished. Ciao. Sink them and we can recover the Arrowhead from the bottom of the river! Load torpedoes. - Load torpedoes! - Torpedo in. Closing the hatch! - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. Closer. Closer. - Lily? - Do you know, - if I were you, Frank... - Well, you're not me. I just feel that sometimes it just needs a bit of a... This is my engine. Nobody touches my engine but me. What did I just... There you go. Goodbye. Is that a... - Torpedo. - Oh, my God. Frank, Frank, Frank! Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank! - What are you doing? - We can't outrun it. Frank! Oh. Look what they did to you. Poor thing. I'm so sorry. Machine guns. Who brings a submarine to the Amazon? But you still outran them. Every time. I thought I'd keep it casual. Well, you've really outdone yourself this time. Do we know the identity of our homicidal maniac in the submarine? No, I don't know his name. But the youngest son of Kaiser Wilhelm wrote several articles about the Tears of the Moon. And if I had to guess, I would say that that's him. Aren't you hot in all that? Not in the slightest. My eyeballs are sweating. Are you all right, love? Oh, my... Oh, my goodness! MacGregor, look! Inia geoffrensis! Oh, how beautiful! You know, here we call them ""encantado."" - ""Bewitched""? - Yeah. Shape-shifter spirits. Don't look them directly in the eye unless you want nightmares for life. You believe in legends, you should believe in curses, too. Okay. Hey, MacGregor. Had a girlfriend once, she was cross-eyed. Didn't work out. We could never see eye to eye. Oh, my God. Is that your idea of a joke? That is not funny. I'm also quite sure she was seeing somebody on the side. Silly. You know, most people smile when they're on camera, Frank. It's a moving picture camera. Have you never seen one before? I've never seen a moving picture. They're so much fun and you can experience being anywhere in the world. Ah. Although, why would you want to, if you could be here, surrounded by all this? It's just... Oh, it's like drifting through the Garden of Eden. It's just beautiful. Look at this. Frank, did you see these heliconias? Do you know there's more individual species on one tree in the Amazon than there is... MacGregor, I think you seem to be taking us off course. We should turn that way. No, we're good. Stay on course. Lgrimas de Cristal is that way. - Frank, Frank... - He's fine. I think you're mistaken. I'm not mistaken, I'm the skipper. The Lgrimas de Cristal is straight ahead. Stay on course. Frank, it says on the map that it's passable. Here we have that cliff and exactly that tributary. We can save two days going this way. We cannot go that way. We have to go that way. Lgrimas de Cristal is that way. We go that way, it's rapids. You ever been down the rapids? No, but I presume that you have... - Yes. - ...which is why I hired you! So just... turn that way. To the right. Starboard. Whatever you call it. I'm not the one who can't swim, Pants. Don't you worry about that, Skippy. Lady, it's ""Skipper."" My mistake. This godforsaken, endless Amazon, with its infinite tangled tributaries. Dr. Houghton and the Arrowhead could be anywhere. There's only one person who has ever gotten close to the Tears of the Moon. We shall have to ask him directly. We'll set a new course. But, Your Highness, the curse of Don Aguirre... That's only a legend, right? We're gonna anchor here for the night. Can't we make good time in the dark? Look, we can just keep going. No, not unless you want the engine to overheat. Tell you what, Skippy. After this day, I could really do with that luxurious bath of yours. Is it, um, down there? - No, there's no bath down there, Pants. - What? No, the bath is out there. That's the bath. 4,300 miles of luxurious bath. I also warmed it a little bit for you earlier. Oh, and I know you don't know how to swim, so if you happen to drown out there, go ahead and, uh, use the soap to wash yourself ashore. I could do with something to eat. Someone threw all of my reserve food into the harbor. You know, Frank, if you think you're going to cut our trip short by starving us, let me tell you that that is extremely likely to work. Do you expect me to eat that? Oh... Piranha. Better eat them before they eat you. No way. Have to say, Frank. These piranha are so good. Can't quite place that flavor, though. It's blood. Oh. Right. I'm to bed. Sleep anywhere you want downstairs, just not in my cabin. It's off-limits. Why on Earth would I want to do that? Phew. Bugger! You're staring, how do I make it stop? I'm just not used to seeing a woman in pants, that's all. Awfully interested in my apparel, Frank. Get your head around it. You know, you really bring those eyes to life. Your perspective's a little off, though. What? Well, you're right, annoyingly. - Do you draw? - I used to. Why'd you stop? Well, I drew everything I wanted to draw. Then I figured I'd learn something new. Or perhaps you just need some proper inspiration. What about you? Never lack for inspiration. No, I mean, what're you doing out here? Chasing maps all over the place? Or is this your idea of fun? - The Tears of the Moon... - Oh, come on. I believe that the legend is real. - Which it's not. - And I'm gonna find it. - Which you won't. - And when I do, just imagine the lives that could be saved. Legend says one petal from the Tree will heal anything. It will change medicine forever. It's the beginning of a scientific revolution. It's very exciting, Frank. So, you wanna be the Darwin of flowers? And I want to help as many people as I can. Wanna save the world? I didn't say ""save the world."" It's very noble. - Well, thank you. - It's also very stupid. You are deeply unpleasant. And off-key. So, you'd rather risk your life and your brother's life to save people you don't even know? Well, I don't have to know someone to care. Well, I don't have to care about anybody, period. That's apparent. Look, I just think if you're lucky enough to have one person in this life to care about, then that's world enough for me. ""That's world enough for me."" Hmm. Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my... MacGregor! Proxima! Proxima! Heel there, Proxima! Proxima, heel. Heel. Proxima. This is your cat? So, that fight? - Faked it. - For goodness' sake, Frank! Is there a single thing about you that I can trust? Not a thing. Great timing. The natives speak of this place with dread. This is where Aguirre and his men were punished for trying to steal the Arrowhead. There. River water. This is what you have been waiting for. Look who is here. The legend in the flesh. River water. You want to see more? A long, painful wait to see the river again. The Tears of the Moon can break your curse, free you from this jungle. You want what I need. Detonator. The Arrowhead is near. You will find it for me, and we both get what we want. Deal? Swear it. Good. Ah, look who had nightmares. All right, we're about to hit the butter churn. Ready, Pants? You sure this is the only way? You picked the route. You wanted to save two days. Uh, ""butter churn,"" how literal a metaphor? If you have anything of value, I would recommend that you store it below deck. Since I consider myself of value, I will see you all on the other side. Wait a minute. MacGregor. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Do not lose it. You see that? I want you to bring that to me. It's been lovely knowing you. Don't say that. Go. Oh, not you again. Go away. You sure you're up for this, Pants? Just drive the boat, Skippy. That ruddy cat! - What are you doing? - She's incessant. Here we go. Oh, my God! You okay, lady? - I'm fine. - You wanna turn back, Pants? Nope. Just getting started. Good. Me, too. Slow down! You wanna turn back? Just drive! Looks like you wet your pants, Pants. That was the wave. You should give up. You should give up the guitar. Oh, my God! Come on, buena nia. Come on! Please don't ever do that again. I could turn the boat around and we could head back to town, how's that? That may be the first intelligent thing you've said since we met. How about you, Pants? You ready to go back to town? No? I actually loved, uh, the whole experience. I... I found it, um, exhilarating. You're looking a little green around the gills. That's why I'm asking. Are you okay? Are you hungry? Yeah, she's hungry. Have some cured piranha if you think you... You did good... Did you get it? Ugh! You're drunk? You're the worst cat I have ever had. I don't know how you live with that woman. I've been with her for two days, and I already wanna throw her overboard. Does take some getting used to. Does she ever stop being so, uh... - Lily? - Yes. Afraid not. Headfirst, figure it out on the way down. It should be on her crest in Latin. Hmm. What you doing? Your funeral. It's just a peek. Your sister says whatever she wants to say to whoever she wants to say it. No regard for anybody's feelings. Doesn't matter who gets hurt. Usually me. She takes after our father. He was always chasing after some far-fetched idea. There's no such thing as curses. Or cure-alls. And there hasn't been a conquistador here for three centuries. Hmm. So, why'd you follow her out here, then? It was the third time that I'd been presented with an entirely suitable marriage to a charming, educated woman that sits on a horse well, that I had to tell the lady in question that I couldn't accept the offer. Or, indeed, any offer, given that my interests happily lie... elsewhere. Elsewhere? Elsewhere. Huh. Well... To elsewhere. Uncle threatened to disinherit me, friends and family turned their backs... all because of who I loved. I would've been ostracized from society were it not for Lily. She stood by me. And for that, I would follow her into a volcano. Pants! Let's shove off! Would you care to explain this? I said stay out of my quarters. Oh, I bet you did. So that you could keep more secrets from us. Just lie upon lie. I mean, Frank, you are like an onion of deceit. - What lies? - That you're after it yourself! I am not after it! Not anymore. Not for a long, long time. Okay, yes, I came here seeking the Tears of the Moon, just like you. I have a map just like yours. And a dozen others just like it. Aguirre's cartographer certainly was prolific. Yeah, well, he lost his life searching for something that can't be found. I've tracked the legend to every village, every island, every shoal. Nothing. And now I'm stuck on this river ever since, wishing I could be anywhere else but here. But you never had this. I'm going to pet you now. And you're not going to eat me. Understood? Easing in. About to engage. You're not that bad really, are you, for a big, hairy murder cat? I don't usually offend so immediately. Lily! MacGregor. Oh... Where are they taking us? We're headed into headhunter territory, which is a terrible place to be headed. Oh, Frank, come on, not now. I can't turn it off. Lily! Frank! Frank. ...MacGregor... What did you say? I said that they should let you and your brother MacGregor go, and live. In exchange, you'll have to leave all of your things and your clothes, and I'll stay back as well. That's very, very brave. That is not something I agree to, Frank. We're not doing it. There's no way that the three of us can get out of this situation alive. I know these people. Leave now and let them... - No! - Can I please talk for five minutes without you interrupting me? Oh, now you've done it. Oh, no. ""The only thing of yours I want - ""is the Arrowhead."" - No. Don't shake your head like that. They hate that. They hate that. Don't do that. ""I know you have it. ""It belongs to my people, taken long ago. ""You can return it and go free. ""Or I can pry it from your fingers. ""After I pick them clean of meat."" Oh. Come on. You heard the nice cannibal. - Hand it over. - I'm a little rusty in the Puka Michuna dialect, so I want you to translate what I say, word for word. Okay. No, I cannot give you the Arrowhead. - Oh, God. Lily. - Lily. Shut up. Just say it. Yes, I have the Arrow that belongs to your people. She's being weird about the Arrowhead. I will return it. She's extremely difficult. But first I must use it to find the Tears of the Moon. It's hard to be around her. Now, if I die for that, so be it. She doesn't mind if you kill her. But you must let these two men go free. Just don't kill me. Lily! Come on, fight me. You, come on, fight me. Go! Do it! What's wrong with you? Lily... Seriously, Frank. Next time I'm going to charge you more for this ""booga-booga"" nonsense. Sam, we had a deal, okay? No, no. I'm tired, and this is a whole production, with these ridiculous costumes! And you told me this was a nice English lady with her wimpy brother. And she's gonna get herself killed. I know, because she's crazy! She's crazy determined. Lily, listen, the truth is I didn't get a chance to call this entire thing off. Remember, it's only a scam if you fall for it. You've gotta stop doing that. - Wimpy, eh? - In a strong way. Strong form. The whole family has strong form. Can you translate it? Possibly. Possibly, but, you know, there are some impediments. Your English gets very exact when you want something. I have the tingling impression we're to negotiate a price. You get me. Trader Sam likes a trade. Oh, I bet. - Would you like that hat? - Hmm. You can have that hat. You've really done it now. - You think she'll get over it? - Not likely. It wasn't personal, you know. It was a pre-existing arrangement. Cross Lily like that and you are dead to her. Dead and buried. Entombed. - Embalmed and entombed. - I got it. - Dead as a dodo. - You're making it very clear. - Dead, dead, dead. - MacGregor. This beer's actually rather nice. - It's masato. - Hmm. It's made out of fermented spit. You're drinking spit. When in Rome. God, I wish I was in Rome. ""The Tears of the Moon ""possess the power to cure anything."" Now, this word here, there's no exact translation in English. It's... a pain to... the soul. Heal. Heal. Heal the soul. Pretty much. Mm-hmm. Heal. ""To prove yourself worthy, you must turn water to stone. ""Then mend a broken heart."" Ooh. ""For Tears to bloom, ""the great Tree must be under the rare crying Moon."" There is one in two days. ""The Tree hides ""where the Moon bled. ""It sank into the west, over the heart of the serpent."" Serpent. ""Where the fang bites its own tail..."" ""Where the fang bites its tail."" Oh, my goodness. Now, I told you it was complicated. Of course no one's ever found it. Right, because it's not in Lgrimas de Cristal. It's here. La Luna Rota. Yes. How long would you say it would take me to get down there? Two or three days. What about via canoe? Excuse me? Please inform Captain Skippy that I will be traveling alone from now on. You're never gonna make it alone, Lily. Please tell him that he misjudges my determination, also my driving skills. Please tell Dr. Pants that what's out there in the jungle, she's never read about in her little textbooks. Tell her that. Well, I'm not gonna be falling for any more of his ludicrous tricks. They're getting really tedious. If you go upriver by yourself with that thing around your neck, - you're never gonna make it out alive. - Really? We have to stick together. - Do we? - Yes, we do. ""We"" is an interesting word, Frank. Because it sort of implies a bond of trust and honesty. Neither of which you know anything about, because you are a liar, Frank. You are selfish, you are arrogant, and I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw you, which clearly isn't very far, because you are huge. So, there is no more ""we,"" actually. In fact, here's the rest of your 12,000. Oh, and here's a tip for such wonderful service. This one is a driver. Driver. Yes. Use that for anything over 200 yards. Under that, you'll need an iron. War paint? Righto, yes. For a warrior. Dilly! Tickles. This doesn't appear to be coming off. That's 'cause it's tattoo ink. It'll come off eventually. In a few decades. Oh, no. Francisco... - Lily! - Oh... Frank, what? - We have to get out of here now. - What? - Give me the Arrowhead. - Do you think I'm a fool? I think you must think I'm a fool. Francisco... Francisco... - What's going on? - That's what I was trying to tell you. No. You seem surprised. It's impossible. The myth is real. After 400 years... The Arrowhead... ...belongs to me. - Save your family! - Yes! Oh, God! Frank, Frank! Frank! Come on. I got you, Pants. Trust me. Hold on! Frank? Frank, get it. - Hold on. - Come on. - Frank, please. - I got it. - Frank. - I don't got it. - Frank! - Oh, my God! - Frank, get off me! What're you doing? - I'm trying to get traction. - This is ridiculous! - No, no, wait. Just leave me alone! That was a disaster! You're too heavy. MacGregor! Lily? Sorry. Get off her! - No! - Aguirre! Driver. - Lovely shot, sir. - The Arrow. No! Frank! We gotta go! Come on! Get in! Grab that knife! Now! Are you all right? What have you done? My foot. It's all right. It's all right. Ow, ow, ow. You must go. Get out of sight of the river and run. Aguirre only wants the Arrowhead. - Just run as fast as you can. - Go. They're coming! Go! Get away from the river! I have her! No! Give me the Arrowhead! Aguirre, we're too far from the river! Oh, my God! - It's cool. It's me. It's me. - Whoo! Did you see the Arrowhead? Have you really seen it? Not only have I seen it, I held it in my hands. Finally we can break the curse... and Francisco shall pay. Forget about Francisco! The Arrowhead, Aguirre! Only the Tears of the Moon can help us get out of this curse. This jungle is devouring our souls. We are disgusting. Speak for yourself. I am delicious. Do you really believe we still have souls? That's why we need the Tears of the Moon, they are our only hope. The woman in pants has the Arrowhead... and has taken it away from the river. Because she knows we can't follow her there. The Prince. He can follow the Arrowhead. Tell him where she went. You heard him. Tell the Prince. MacGregor! MacGregor! MacGregor! MacGregor! Frank? Frank, you're alive. How? How are you alive, Frank? I saw you die. I saw you fall. How are you alive? Lily, I don't care what you've done for me, - if we make it out of here alive... - Oh, there you are. ...I am never leaving Kensington again. - Frank's alive! - Yeah. Frank's alive. Huh. Oh, um... You've got a little, um, something in your back. Frank? The name's actually Francisco. Francisco Lopez de Heredia. And... I'm roughly 400 years old. - What? - I know it's a lot to take in. - I will explain to you the entire story... - There's no blood in you. Are you a ghost? No, it's complicated. But clearly you're... you're not a human. Okay, but it's very hard to focus when I have a sword impaled in my heart. Trader Sam, I need you to come and pull. Vampire? I told you last time, I'm done pulling weapons out of you. Oh, no. It is, uh, Dr. Houghton, right? Of Botany. Look at it. It's just hanging out like that. Well, it's how it's made. It's got a very strange shape. Have you seen it out the back? It's like... Woo... Like that. Well, it's not... It's kinda actually just straight. One hand, two hand, what do you want? Let's try one. You're gonna need two hands. No, no, no! - What, what, what? - Oh, my gosh! That hurts. - No, it doesn't. - How do you know? Frank, would you like to bite down on my stick? - Nope. I'm good. Thank you. - No, for the pain. I understand what it... What he means. But no. There if you need it. I just feel like you're very uptight right now. And it's not helping me, 'cause I'm very nervous. It's okay to be nervous. It's your first time. - Ooh! - It is your first time, right? - Yes, you know it is, Frank. - I know, I know. I can tell. I've done this hundreds of times. - I don't know how to take that, Frank. - This is special. - Is it? - It is. - Slow! - What? Oh, you can't do it like that. - That's way too hard. - Frank. Would you like me to give it a wiggle? - Yes. Yes. - Absolutely not. I could pop around the back and give it a once over. - No, we're good. - Okay. You know what always helps? If you put your foot on it. - I'm a little nervous. - Don't be nervous. Frank, I'm gonna count to three. You're gonna... I'm counting or... No, I'm counting. - One. - 'Cause... Ahhh! I dreamt I was lunching at Boodle's. Hey, Doctor. - We should go. - Of course. No. You've done enough. I can't leave you alone out here. Look at the state of you. And you can't even walk. Will you at least consider turning back? I will be fine. I promise. Do I smell? Horrendously. We have visitors. Open the hatch. Good afternoon, my friends. Something is there? What is there? You have found their river boat? No? Not the river boat? The Arrowhead? The Arrowhead? Yes. Show... Show me where. We're taking orders from a bee. Show me on the map. Here? Yes! You heard him. Change course! Could you ask the bee for coordinates? Don't be ridiculous, Axel. Thank you. Thank you. 395 years... ...five months and 13 days. I really thought you died. Were you sad when I died? I was very concerned. For my soul. For my expedition. And for you. So, what are you? You don't bleed, I think you breathe. You're not possible. I don't know what I am anymore. But I can tell you what I was. My father was a mercenary and he was recruited by Aguirre's father in Algiers. When my father died protecting him, he took me in. Raised Aguirre and me together, like brothers. Aguirre's daughter Anna had fallen ill. She was all he had. He vowed he wouldn't lose her. I will travel far. But I will come back to you with a Tear of the Moon. And you will run again in the moonlight. Healed. We fought the ocean, only to be beaten by the river. The jungle fought our every step. I would've done anything to find the Tears of the Moon and save Aguirre's daughter. Even chart the Amazon. You were Aguirre's cartographer? You drew my map? Frank... Really think my work is extraordinary? I think you were a minor master of your time. Minor? One by one, the jungle took us. We were all but dead. Still, Aguirre wouldn't turn back. There was no world for him without his daughter in it. And then they came. We would've all died had they not saved us with the Tears of the Moon. The petal's magic was real. Its powers unlocked by the Chief and his daughter. All that was broken, the petals mended. And all at once, we were revived. And Aguirre was happy, because he was closer than ever to finding a cure for his daughter. But he grew impatient. Aguirre demanded they give him the Arrowhead and take him to the Tree. You are not worthy. The Chief refused. Despite all the kindness they'd shown us, he would've killed every last one of them. She has the Arrowhead! I loved Aguirre, but I couldn't be part of the madness. I'm not going to hurt you. I only want the Arrowhead. And I couldn't just stand by. Give it to me! Run! No! A brother's blade cuts deepest. Traitor. The Chief knew he was breathing his last breath. And he used that breath to protect the Arrowhead and their sacred Tree. He cursed Aguirre. He cursed all of us, so that we could never leave sight of the river again. - Where did she go? - She can't be far! Or the jungle would take us back to it, for all eternity. Aguirre hated me for betraying him. He found me over the years, and we fought. And fought again. I got tired of being stabbed. So I made sure he would never hurt me or anyone else again. I trapped them in a cave. The river! Where is it? Where the jungle couldn't take them back to the river. We have to get out of here! Francisco, you will pay for this! And for 300 years, the jungle ravaged their bodies. Turning them into the monsters they are today. I don't know how they got free, but I was safe for a long time. What did you do? Well, I made the best of it. I built a town. And that was fun. Made some friends. Lost some friends. That's when I decided to search for the Tears of the Moon. I built a boat. And I named her after the goddess of the moon, Quila. I charted every inch of this river, searching. Till I finally gave up. And since I could never leave sight of the river, I started giving jungle cruises to tourists. All that time, all alone... Well, not entirely alone, of course. That's right. Over the years, I would find strays that needed someone. The next, after the next, after the next. And la prxima, la prxima... - La prxima? - Proxima, yes, - I name 'em all Proxima. - Oh, la prxima. Oh, but don't worry, you're my favorite girl. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily Life is but a dream You're meant to join in on the second verse. I'll do it again, shall I? Row, row, row... I'm begging you, stop! Are we there yet? No! Got one. I spy with my little eye something beginning with... ""S."" Thought you might want a lift. Hey! I don't take lifts from strangers. Cup of tea? So, how do you enjoy this jungle? I beg your pardon? This jungle. - Yeah, sorry? - The jungle. Try it slower. The jungle. Could you pop it in a sentence? The trees, the bugs... The... The jungle. - The jungle? - Yes. That is what I said. - Right. - How do you enjoy it? It's actually rather grown on me. I don't care anymore. Sir, we have arrived at the target. Ah. Time to make a deal. Look, right through here. You see the peaceful Puka Michuna tribe? With the touch of this button here, I could end 400 innocent lives. Their only crime being that they are still living. Your sister and the Arrowhead were here. Now, I need to know where she is going. The choice is yours. Do they live or do they die? - Let me help you. - No, it's my turn. Okay. You gotta listen to her. - It's perfect. - Pretty good. Yeah. Now we can just cruise. Do you know how many years people have been looking for that? - This old thing? - Yeah. That old thing. How is it that you turn up with it? Stole it. You stole it? Liberated it. How about that? Okay. I've searched for this thing for so long, but I'm pretty sure it belongs to you. What are you gonna do when you find the Tree? Lift the curse. And what will happen to you? Well... I get to make a choice. And I choose to rest. Hey, Lily, look. Everything that you see that's new in this world, I've seen hundreds of thousands of times. Yes, but none of it has been meaningful. All right. Where are they? I don't actually recognize the specific... - Where? - There. I think you got it. The Tree is here and will be ours. I cannot share my discoveries with their masters. You've been down here a while? This has got to be ""water to stone."" Do you think that we climb? I don't think we're meant to go up. We're in luck. There's a chamber down there with a lever in it. I think pulling it is the key. That's wonderful! It's wonderful. It's fantastic. Only problem is that the ancients who built all of this were on average narrower. - Mm-hmm. - So, it's a great time for you to take the finest bath in all Brazil. - No, no, no. Frank, Frank, please! - Yes. Pants, listen... I cannot swim, Frank. That is not something I can do. You've never tried. It's not about trying. I have this very deep fear. I'll do all the swimming. - Frank, please. - Listen... Look, I can't do this without you. I need you. You have to trust me. No, no. Frank, Frank, Frank, please. I thought you might, uh... Just turn around and look at the waterfall, Skippy. - All right? Please. - Fine. Whew. Don't look. Are you wearing pants under your pants? - Yes. - Oh, my God! Frank! It's okay. It's okay. - Here we go. - I'm not... No, no! Wait a minute! Something just touched my foot, Frank! It's okay, it's okay. It was my foot. Oh, I'm so sorry. - I'm very scared. - Okay. I got you. It's okay. Breathe. - Ready? Okay. - Yes. Lily! Lily, come on, come on. Come on. Lily, come on. Come on. Come on, Lily. What is the matter with you, Frank? - You're alive! - How could you leave me? I didn't leave you. There was a lot of fish down there that... What? Fish? Frank... There were lot of piranha, they were coming after... - I saved you. Look. - Don't even look at me. Fine. ""Turn water to stone..."" After 400 years... I found it. We found it. Now you can be the Darwin of flowers. The petal's right there, you can be free. You can... I mean, it's not like the river's not beautiful, but you can go anywhere and you can see the world. You can come to London. I'm from London. I could show it to you. I even have a motor car. I could be like your skipper, Skippy... If you want. Lily, I would love to do all that with you. But I've made up my mind. There is no London for me after this. There's no motor car. I'm ready. No. It's my time. It was my time long ago. No. No, I don't accept it. You could have one more life. Luckily for me, it's my choice. Well, it shouldn't be, because you have very poor judgement. But you have your world to go back to. It's your world. But it could be yours, too. It could be that one person's world enough. Could be. Lily... Lily. Hello. Small chance I told a madman with a cannon where to find you. Oh, so, we finally meet. Wow. Big, strong boy, huh? Go to the bridge. Go. I believe this belongs to you. Now, the Arrowhead, please? No, no, no. Such an imaginative woman seeking the Tears of the Moon to share with the scientific community that won't even permit you, Frulein, to sit among them. To put that tremendous power into the hands of the masses would be pure madness. When I could use the Tears, not only to win the war, but to reign for all generations to come. Take them away. Eyes ahead. Navigate to the Tree. This Tree is long dead. You know more about the Tears of the Moon than anyone, so... you know how to make it bloom. You will do this for me. And when you have what you want, what's to stop you from killing us then? I could kill you now. I'll do it. If you promise to let them go and give me one single petal in return. I know the myths and the ancient ways as if I've lived them myself. Frank, do not... If anyone here is going to bring the Tears of the Moon, it's me. If you can make the Tree bloom, you may have your petal. You have my word. There's no other way. But the little brother stays on the boat. Little brother? I have a name. Wow, it is wonderful. Go ahead. The Arrowhead should fit here. - You better go help him. Go. - No. No? I'll do it if you give me a petal as well. If I give you a petal as well... One petal. Not two. You must choose. What do you think, Muscles? Will you sacrifice your petal for her? She'd have to kill me first. Ja? - Done. - Done. ""Broken-hearted warrior ""climbed to the highest peak ""and shot his arrow into the Moon. ""From there, the Moon learned real pain and began to weep. ""Where the Tears fell grew a sacred Tree..."" Rum-pum-pum-pum... Give me the Arrow. Hurry up! Trader Sam said we would need to fix a broken heart. It's not an Arrowhead, it's a heart. You can't mend a heart that isn't... ...broken. I'll take that petal now. ""Under the crying Moon..."" We must pluck the petals before it sets. Go! Hurry! Every time. Sorry. Shoot! Good murder cat. Where's Lily? Up there. Here we go again. The Moon's setting. The Tree is dying. Whoa. Come on. Yes! Lily! This is a amusingly familiar situation, no? Give me that petal. - No. - You are about to die one way or another, but if you do not give me that petal, so, too, will your brother. His will be much more slower. Give me that petal. Just one is enough. Give it to me. Never. Frank! Let go of me! Take the wheel. Hold her steady. You're the best cat I've ever had. Get off! It looks like you haven't been very nice... to my little friends. Aguirre, help me to get the petal! I'll give you anything you want! Money, ships... Spain! Royalty is not to be trusted. Aguirre, the woman in pants... Get her! Aguirre! Francisco has the petal! Stop him! - This is where you get off. - What? Tell Lily she would've been world enough for me. Where are you going? Proxima. You protect him, you're in charge. Go. Goodbye, girl. Let's give 'em one last cruise, mi buena nia. There's only one way to end this. Come and get me. Lily. He's going to crash. No, he's gonna block the river. Francisco! Give me the petal! He has the petal in his pocket! Enough is enough! It's now time for you to die! Right. I think we've had quite enough of you. Good night. Not exactly what I intended. A brother's blade cuts deepest. Give me the petal. He told me to tell you, you would have been world enough for him. Where's the petal? I'm sorry, old friend. He wanted you to have it. Stop the boat! Stop it! - Frank. - Wait. Frank, no! No! Francisco, what have you done? This is worse than death! This is torture! Oh, you are the most infuriating man I've ever met. Lily... Frank. Frank! Oh, you're bleeding. That hurts. - It does? - Yeah. Well, that's good. I can't believe you shot me. - I know. - Twice. I know, but you didn't go down the first time. You should've just gone down. You're both my world. Well, well, well... Nilo. Now you have all the boats. Take care of her. I stand before you today to tell you about the Tears of the Moon. The legend is true. Our party traveled further into the Amazon than any expedition had previously dared. On our trip, the lines between life and death, past and present, vanished. I witnessed things not to be believed. Enchanted dolphins that could haunt one's dreams. Undead conquistadors, cursed as prisoners of the jungle for nearly 400 years. A tribe whose chief, a lady... No! It actually worked rather well. My point is, this was a journey the likes of which this society has never seen. An adventure truly worthy of this association. But is this association worthy of our great adventure? You see, we didn't seek the Tears of the Moon so that we could be written up in some journal for a load of crusty old farts. My sister, who just made full professor at Cambridge, has asked me to respectfully reject your invitation of membership on her behalf. Which I will do. Just not respectfully. Gentlemen, you can take your invitation and you can shove it up your association. How dare you! Ready for your first driving lesson? I think so, Pants. I hope you know what you're getting yourself into here, Frank. A car. Oh, your jokes. They will be the death of me. They are absolutely exhausting. Wow, Lily. - Did you like it? - It was good. - Yeah. - Are you proud? Oh! Frank, Frank, Frank! - Oh, my goodness! - Okay, I got it. Frank, for goodness' sake! - I got it, I got it. - Turn now! Turn now! Turn now! I got it all under control, Pants., Hey! ...a dark and stormy Halloween. Good evening and welcome to GC-1 News live at 8:00. Our top story tonight, just-released polls have incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr. and 28-year-old grassroots challenger Bella Rel in a dead heat. Things certainly got hot last night in their final debate before next Tuesday's election. Now, my young opponent here wants to gut the Gotham Renewal Program, established by the great Thomas Wayne. Cutting funds from vital projects like our sea wall and the safety net for those who need it. The Renewal Program is broken. This city's been renewing for 20 years. Look where it's gotten us. Crime has skyrocketed. Murder and drug use are at historic highs. Now wait... Now hang on. We have a masked vigilante running the street. Under my administration, the Gotham PD has dealt major blows to organized crime and drug trafficking. The Salvatore Maroni case was the biggest drug bust in city history. But drops and other drugs are still rampant. It's gotten worse. I'm not saying there isn't work to do. But listen... I have a beautiful wife and young son, okay? And I will not rest... Hey. Yeah, I'm watching it now. Why is she still tied? But I thought we were getting a bump in the new Post poll. Okay, you know what? I can't watch this anymore. Just call me in the morning, okay? ...who still believes in everything this city can do. We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell, not a cheerleader. And someone who will tell the people the truth. Thursday, October 31st. The city streets are crowded for the holiday. Even with the rain. Hidden in the chaos is the element, waiting to strike like snakes. But I'm there too. Watching. Two years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal. I must choose my targets carefully. - Come on! Give me the money. - Okay. - Let's go! Let's go! - All right, all right! It's a big city. I can't be everywhere. But they don't know where I am. Look at this guy, man. Boom! Whoo-hoo-hoo! So good, man. That's what I'm talking about! Yo, let's see your hits. That's you. We have a signal now. For when I'm needed. But when that light hits the sky, it's not just a call. It's a warning. To them. Fear... is a tool. Are you out of your mind? Watch where you're goin', drophead! They think I'm hiding in the shadows. Come on! But I am the shadows. - Come on, come on. - Whoo! - Hey, go on, man! Go! - Get him! - Come on, man! - What are you doin'? Help! Somebody help me! Help, help! Where you goin', huh? Come on. Come on, man. Break it. You can't move, huh? Now knock his ass out. Showtime. Showtime, man. Come on, man. Come on. Do it, man. You see this guy? The hell are you supposed to be? I'm vengeance. Holy shit. It's him. Hey, man. No, no, no! Please don't hurt me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Police action. He's with me, Officer. Are you kidding me, sir? You're gonna let him in here? Martinez, let him through. Goddamn freak. What do we know? Detective? Sorry, Lieutenant. We got blunt force trauma. Lacerations on the head. He got hit a lot of times. And hard. All this blood is from his head? No. Excuse me. Most of it's from his hand. Thumb was severed. Killer may have taken it as a trophy. He was alive when it was cut off. Ecchymosis... around the wound. Security detail downstairs said the family was out trick-or-treatin'. The mayor was up here alone. Killer may have come through the skylight. You said there was a card. Yeah. ""From your secret friend. Whoo? Haven't a clue? Let's play a game, just me and you. What does a liar do when he's dead?"" There's a cipher too. Any of this mean anything to you? What's going on here? I asked him to come, Pete. This is a crime scene. It's Mitchell, for chrissakes! I got the press downstairs. You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim, 'cause we got history. But this is way over the line. Wait. - He's involved in this? - No, he's not involved. How do you know? He's a goddamn vigilante! He could be a suspect! What are you doin' to me? We used to be partners. I'm just trying to find the connection, Pete. He lies still. Excuse me? The riddle. What does a liar do when he's dead? He lies still. Oh, Jesus. This must be your favorite night of the year, huh, pal? Happy fuckin' Halloween. Excuse me, Commissioner. They're ready for your statement. I want him outta here. Now! Come on. Yeah. The kid found him. Was there anyone else in the house when you arrived? We really gotta go, man. Tonight, a son lost a father. A wife lost a husband. And I lost a friend. Mayor Mitchell was a fighter for the city, and I will not rest until his killer is found. This was a truly senseless crime, and we are actively pursuing every investigative lead we have in order to identify the perpetrator and hunt him down. I've spoken to the governor... I wish I could say I'm making a difference, but I don't know. Murder, robberies, assault. Two years later, they're all up. And now this. The city's eating itself. Maybe it's beyond saving. But I have to try. Push myself. These nights all roll together in a rush behind the mask. Sometimes in the morning, I have to force myself to remember everything that happened. Unbelievable breaking news this hour, everyone. Again, four-term incumbent Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr. was found murdered last night inside his home in the exclusive Crest Hill district. Exact details of the crime still have not been released, but a citywide manhunt is already underway as police and FBI search for the brazen killer. And this certainly is not the first time Gotham has been rocked by the murder of a political figure. In fact, in an eerie coincidence, it was 20 years ago this week that celebrated billionaire philanthropist Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha were slain during Wayne's own mayoral campaign. It was a shocking crime that remains unsolved to this day. Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career was especially notable for his tough war on drugs when he and city police launched a major sting operation, resulting in the arrest of notorious mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni with what, to this day, remains the biggest drug bust in GCPD history. I assume you heard about this. Yeah. Oh, I see. All this blood is from his head? Dear God. There's a cipher too. Any of this mean anything to you? The killer left this for the Batman? I asked him to come, Pete. Apparently. You're becoming quite a celebrity. Why is he writing to you? It's Mitchell, for chrissakes! I don't know yet. I got the press downstairs. Have a shower. Our accounting friends at Wayne Enterprises are coming for breakfast. Here? Why? Because I couldn't get you to go there. I haven't got time for this. It's getting serious, Bruce. If this continues, it won't be long before you've nothing left. I don't care about that. Any of that. You don't care about your family's legacy? What I'm doing is my family's legacy. If I can't change things here, if I can't have an effect, then I don't care what happens to me. That's what I'm afraid of. Alfred, stop. You're not my father. I'm well aware. We really gotta go, man. Some fresh berries there. What are you doing? Just reminiscing about my days in the Circus. This is actually quite elusive. Where'd you get those O's? ""He lies still"" is only a partial key. It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T. So, I'm looking for any double symbols to start, trying letters, see where it leads. That's interesting. Mr. Pennyworth? Yes, Dory? The accountants are here. See them in, please, Dory. What if it's not a partial key? What do you mean? What if this is the whole key? Ignore the symbols we don't have letters for. Use only the letters from ""He lies still"" and leave the rest... Blank. Yeah, I understand. But that would leave most of the cipher unsolved. I don't see how that's gonna... Oh. Damn. Yeah, he's got a car. Guess it's good to be the mayor. Where to even start? You sure this isn't a leap? ""Drive"" could mean anything. You don't trust me? You mean like you trust me? It's been two years now, and I don't even know who you are, man. There. What are we looking for? A USB port. USB? What? ""Thumb"" drive. Jesus. It's encrypted. Try this. Oh, this guy's hilarious. Oh, well, well, well. So much for family values. Who is she? No idea. But that's the Penguin, Carmine Falcone's right hand. I know who he is. What was that? Shit, shit! The drive. It sent out the photos from my account. Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all of them. Jesus. I'm gonna catch hell for this. Pete's gonna bust a gasket. ""He lies still."" About her? Maybe. That's the Iceberg Lounge. It's under the Shoreline Lofts where Falcone was holed up. Never get in there without a warrant. Yeah. Know who I am? Yeah. I got an idea. I want to see the Penguin. I don't know what you're talking about, pal. What's the problem? Says he wants to see the Penguin. Penguin? There's no Penguin here. That's what I tried to tell him. Get out of here, freak. You hear me? Or that little suit's gonna get all full of blood. Mine or yours? Get him! I saw that whole thing. He's over there! What is your problem? Hey! Put the bat down, or I'll blow your head off! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy, sweetheart. You looking for me? I see you met the twins. Boy, you're everything they say, ain't ya? I guess we both are. How you doing? I'm Oz. Who is she? I really don't know, chief. I might have been coming out at the same time, but I wasn't rolling with them. It's okay, baby. Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite. Come on. Thank you, honey. Here you go, champ. I wanna know who she is, and what she has to do with this murder. - Whose murder? - The mayor's. Is that the mayor? Oh, shit, it is. Look at that. Don't make me hurt you. You better watch it. You know my reputation? Yeah, I do. Do you? Look... I'm just the proprietor, okay? I mean, what people do here ain't got nothing to do with me. Tell you one thing. Whoever she is, she's one hot chick. Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife? Maybe she knows. What? Too soon? You let me know if there's anything else I can do. Taxi! Taxi! Hey, it's me. Baby, what's wrong? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. I can't... On the news? Okay. No. No, stay there. Wait for me, okay? Wait for me, I'm on my way home. Listen, baby, we're gonna get the hell out of here, okay? I promise. If we have to leave earlier, we'll leave tonight. Uh... God damn it. ...photos of murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr. with a younger mystery woman. In a shocking development, the police believe the photos themselves... Now they urge her to contact the GCPD... You're pretty good at that. Hey! Give me that. ""Kosolov, Annika."" He hurt her? That's why you killed him? What? Oh, please. Just give me the goddamn... Listen, honey, you got the wrong idea, okay? I didn't kill anybody. I'm here for my friend. She's trying to get the hell out of here, and this son of a bitch stole her passport. What does she know? Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked she won't even tell me. She did seem upset. Back at your place. Let's go talk to her. Anni! Baby! Anni! Anni! It's gonna be cool this evening. It's gonna be down into the 40s. More breaking news this hour as the city is rocked by a second high-profile murder in as many nights. And this time, the killer has come forward to claim credit online... Jesus, what are they gonna do to her? She's just a kid. Shit, they took my phone. His victim, longtime head of the Gotham City PD, Commissioner Pete Savage, was found dead earlier tonight inside the Police Athletic League facilities in the Tricorner area. The killer posted the following message on social media, and we have to warn you, the video is very disturbing. Hello, people of Gotham. This is the Riddler speaking. On Halloween night, I killed your mayor because he was not who he pretended to be. But I am not done. Here is another... who will soon be losing face. I will kill again, and again, and again, until our day of judgment when the truth about our city will finally... be unmasked. Goodbye! Commissioner Savage served a distinguished 30-year career on the GCPD... Holy shit, I seen that guy too. At the club. The Iceberg Lounge? 44 Below. What is that? The club within the club. The real club. It's a mob hangout. Is that where you work? Selina? No, I just work the bar upstairs. But I see 'em come in. Who? A lot of guys that shouldn't be there, I can tell you that. Your basic upstanding citizen types. You're gonna help me on this. For your friend. You got a lot of cats. I have a thing about strays. You're not safe here. I can take care of myself. Two public figures now dead in just the last two nights, and only days before the election. Police and city officials are left searching for a killer and hoping to find him before he kills again. He waited for him at the gym. Pete always liked to work out late at night, when no one else was around. There's a needle mark on his neck. Injected him with arsenic. Rat poison. Yeah. That seems to be his theme here. Look at this thing. It's a maze. What kind of demented son of a bitch does this to a person? More symbols. It's another cipher. He blasted these out after his message went viral. Bastard murders you and your reputation. That guy pushes drops. On the east end. I don't get it. Why would Pete get involved in something like this? Looks like he got greedy. You kidding me? After everything we did to take down the Maronis? We busted their entire operation, then he caves to some lowlife dealer? Maybe he's not who you thought. You make it sound like he had it coming. He was a cop. Crossed a line. ""I'm mad about you. Want to know my name? Just look inside and see."" ""Follow the maze until you find the rat. Bring him into the light, and you'll find where I'm at."" The hell is that? ""Bring him into the light""? ""Find the rat""? I don't know. Lieutenant. They're coming back. We got to get out of here. Come on. Ow! I don't know about these things. I need to see in there, this hunting ground. Hey, why am I starting to feel like a fish on a hook? I'm just looking for Annika. Boy, you're a real sweetheart. You really don't care what happens to me in there tonight, do you? Look at me. Looks good. Here. I got you. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hey, where you goin'? Hospitality. That's one of the guys I got into it with the other night. Looks like I broke his nose. ""Kenzie, William."" He's an off-duty cop. Are you sure no one can see these things in my eyes? Don't worry. I'm watching you. Don't look away. I need time to make IDs. Great. These guys have a little problem with eye contact, don't they? Feels good, doesn't it? Yeah, baby. Feels real good. Jesus, I hate dropheads. Really? 'Cause when I first saw you, it looked like you were dealing for Penguin. You don't know what you're talking about. Can we not... Can we not do this right now? Wait. Who was that? Oh, I saw him. Look back. If I look back, it's gonna be a whole can of worms. I need to see his face. Jesus. That's the DA. Gil Colson. And he's coming over. You happy? Talk to him. Hey. How you doing? Hi. I'm Gil. Hey, aren't you the DA? Yeah. Wow. I've seen you on TV. Is that right? I haven't seen you around here before. It's a hell of a time to be the new girl, 'cause people are all a little on edge. Oh, honey, I live on the edge. Is that right? I like that. Do you want to come over? Sure. - This is Travis. - Hey. You wanna take a seat over there? - Richie, Glen. - Hey. That's half the DA's office. You know Carla here, huh? Hi. That's Cheri. Don't mind her, she's just taking a break. Drowning our sorrows. You want a drop? Uh, no, I'm good. But you enjoy. Hope you don't mind. I got a lot on my shoulders with that psycho running around. He's wasted. No shit. I like this girl. Oh, hey, I like you too! I mean, this Riddler, he's going after the most powerful people in the city. He knows so much. He doesn't know shit, man. What are you talking about? Yeah, he does! What about that rat... Hey, hey, Gil, come on. - Think maybe you had a little too much. - Hey. The rat. - Slow down. - Ask him about the rat. Hey, what's this about a rat? I mean... there was a rat. We had an informant. We had big-time information on Salvatore Maroni. That's how we got him out of the drops business. He's talking about the Maroni case. But if this guy knows, it's gonna come out. And when it does, this whole city's gonna come apart. Okay, I don't wanna hear this. This is the kind of pillow talk that got that Russian girl disappeared. What do you know about that? Does anybody want a drink? I want a drink. Keep him talking. Wait, where are you going? She knows Annika. No, stay on the DA. I told you I'm looking for my friend. - Where's Annika? - Out of my face. I don't know you. Yeah, but you know her. Who took her? - What have you heard? Is she okay? - Jesus Christ, keep your voice down. What, you got a death wish? Hey, what's the problem, ladies? There's no problem. It's just girl talk. Let's keep it festive down here, all right? Sure thing, Oz. Hey. Hey. Been a long time since I seen you down here. How you been? Yeah, I've been okay. I was just... I was just headed back upstairs. Well... don't be a stranger. - You know Carmine Falcone. - I told you it's a mob spot. You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him. I don't have a relationship with him, okay? - Well, that's not what it looked like. - Forget it. Wait, what are you doing? - Listen, I can't do this anymore. - No! No! Taxi! Hey! I lost you in there. Yeah, I gotta go. Oh, you need a ride? That's me right there. Taxi! I'm good. I hope, uh... I'll see you around. Just hold still. What do you know about a confidential informant in the Maroni case? Yeah, sure, there was. That's the rat we're looking for. Somehow Riddler knows who he is. If we find the rat, maybe it'll lead us to him. Where are you getting this? I have a source who spoke to the DA tonight. Gil's very nervous. I think the killer's targeting people close to that case. I worked that case. Riddler's not after you. How do you know? You're not corrupt. Colson's dirty? Maybe I, uh... I go after him. Lean on him to give up the rat. It's too dangerous. They made a secret deal with this guy. Who knows how many people it touches. Politicians. Police. The courts. It could tear the whole city apart. Jesus, this is a powder keg. And Riddler's the match. You know Carmine Falcone. I told you it's a mob spot. You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him. I don't have a relationship... You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him. I don't have a relationship with him. Okay? You know Carmine Falcone. I told you it's a mob spot. You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him. I don't have a relationship with him. Okay? Pretty. She a new friend of yours? I'm not so sure. Looks like you upset her. Shall I take this as a good sign? What? Your attire. Is Bruce Wayne making an actual appearance? There's a public memorial for Mayor Mitchell. Serial killers like to follow reactions to their crimes. Riddler might not be able to resist. Oh, that reminds me. I've taken the liberty of doing a little work on this latest cipher. The one from the rat maze. I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect, but I'm fairly certain this translates to, ""You are El Rata Alada."" Rata Alada? ""Rat with wings""? It's slang for ""pigeon."" Does that mean anything to you? Yeah. A stool pigeon. Where are your cufflinks? I couldn't find them. Well, you can't go out like that. Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks. You have to keep up appearances. You're still a Wayne. And what about you? Are you a Wayne? Your father gave them to me. No more lies! No more lies! Mr. Wayne. All right. All right, you're going straight down there. Is that Bruce Wayne? Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne! Hold it. You good, fellas? Good. We're good, Mr. Falcone. Sir? Hey! Give us a wide berth here, would you, slick? Hey, watch it, fellas. You got the prince of the city there. Some event, huh? Brought out the one guy in the city more reclusive than me. Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline. Aren't you afraid someone'll take a shot at you? Why? 'Cause your father ain't around? Oz, you know Bruce Wayne? Wow. Is that right? His father saved my life. I got shot in the chest. Right here. I couldn't go to no hospital, so we showed up on his doorstep. Operated right on the dining room table. Kid here, he saw the whole thing, up on the stairs looking down. I remember your face. You don't think that meant something, he did that? It meant he took the Hippocratic oath. ""Hippocratic oath."" That's good. Excuse me. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming to today's memorial for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr. Our program will begin shortly. As a reminder, the family asked that those wishing to honor the mayor's memory consider a donation to the cause most dear to his heart... ...the Gotham Renewal Fund, our city's safety net. What good's a safety net doesn't catch anybody? Didn't help my daughter when she needed it, I can tell you that. The guy was just another rich scum-sucker. He got what he deserved. Know what I mean? Hey, don't I know you? Bruce Wayne. Why haven't you called me back? I'm sorry? I'm Bella Rel. I'm running for mayor. I wouldn't be bothering you here, but your people keep telling me you're unavailable. Will you walk with me? Mr. Wayne. Mr. Wayne. You know, you really could be doing more for this city. Your family has a history of philanthropy, but as far as I can tell, you're not doing anything. If I'm elected, I want to change that. Thank you. My God. I'm gonna go pay my respects. Will you wait for me? I want to continue this. Excuse me. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. Excuse me, chief. Can I talk to you? Gil Colson is missing. What? He hasn't been heard from since last night. Christ, not again. Hey. Mr. Wayne. You got people looking for him, Jim? Sent a couple guys to his house. Nothing. What'd his wife say? She hadn't heard from him. Get out of the car! Get out of the car and show your hands! Get out! Get 'em up! Get out! Show 'em! Christ, it's Colson. There's a bomb around his neck! Let's clear this place out now! We've got to get this place cleared out! Hey, guys, guys. Here we go. We don't know if he's in on it. What's he looking at? Holy shit. Are you kidding me? What the hell is he doing? Gordon! Your guy's gonna get himself killed in there. Please. - He made me do it. - I'm so sorry. He told me if I didn't do exactly what he said, he'd kill me. I'm so sorry. Looks like a combination lock. Can't we just cut it off? Not if you want to keep your head. You came. Who are you? Me? I'm nobody. I'm just an instrument, here to unmask the truth about this cesspool we call a city. ""Unmask""? Yes. Let's do it together, okay? I've been trying to reach you. You're part of this too. How am I a part of this? You'll see. Hey, Chief. You better take a look at this. Say hello to my followers. We're live. They're here to watch our little trial. At the moment, the man across from you, Mr. Colson, is dead. Jesus, can we get somebody out here? This psycho's gonna kill me! But wait a minute... Shut up! You deserve to be dead after what you did! You hear me? Okay. I'm giving you a chance. No one ever gave me a chance. Now, ever since I was a child, I've always loved little puzzles. For me, they are a retreat from the horrors of our world. Maybe they can bring some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson. You want me to do puzzles? Three riddles in two minutes. You give me the answers, and I'll give you the code for the lock. - Do you understand? - Yeah. Okay, okay. So I just... You want me to... Riddle number one... ""It can be cruel, poetic, or blind, but when it's denied, it's violence you may find."" Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that? ""Cruel""? ""Poetic""? - ""Justice."" - Huh? The answer's ""justice."" - Justice? - Yes! - Oh, God. - Justice! And you were supposed to be an arm of justice in this city, along with the late mayor and police commissioner, were you not, Mr. Colson? Of course, of course. Of course. Riddle number two. ""If you are justice, please do not lie. What is the price for your blind eye?"" - ""The price""? - ""Bribes."" Oh, God. ""Bribes""? He's asking you how much it cost for you to turn your back. Fifty-eight seconds! - How much? - Nothing! - How much? - Ten grand. Ten Gs a month. I get a monthly payment just not to prosecute certain cases. What cases? He didn't ask me that! Come on! Ten grand. - That's my answer. It's ten grand! - Okay. Okay. Okay. Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson. Just one more to go before your time runs out. Last riddle. ""Since your justice is so select, please tell us which vermin you're paid to protect."" - ""Which vermin""? - The rat. The informant you all protect from the Salvatore Maroni case. - How do you know about that? - What's his name? Twenty seconds. - No. - He's gonna kill you. I'm a dead man either way. You're talking to a dead man, okay? If I go out this way, it's just me. But if I give over that name, I have family, people I love. - He'll kill them too. - Who will? - People are watching. - What people? It's so much bigger than you could ever imagine. - It's the whole system! - Five! Four! - Oh, God, have mercy on me... - Three! Goodbye! Who do you think he is under there? Take it easy. I want to see. What is that thing? Leather? What's he got on his eyes? Who cares? I want to see his face. What are we doing here? Let's just take it off... Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Relax, God damn it! You're protecting this guy, Jim? He interfered in an active hostage situation. Colson's blood is on his hands. Maybe it's on yours. What'd you say? He would rather die than talk. What was he afraid of? You? You son of a bitch. You have any idea what kind of trouble you're in? You could be an accessory to murder. Why are we playing games... Get him! Come on! Back off! Back off! Great, now I got you on assaulting an officer! - You got me on assaulting three. - Hey! What's the matter with you? This isn't the way to do this! You too now? Let me handle this, Chief. Just give me a minute. You're gonna put yourself on the line for this scumbag, Jim? Just give me a minute. I'll get him to cooperate. Okay, give him the room. Two minutes. You listen to me. We gotta get you out of here. That would put a lot of heat on you. Well, you punched me in the face. Take this key. Through that door. Hallway to the stairs that go to the roof. Hey, what the hell is going on here? Hey, hey, hey, what's going on? Who's the mustache with the broken nose? That's Kenzie. Narcotics. He's one of the guys I got into it with at the Iceberg Lounge. What are you saying? Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin? Or he moonlights as a cop. - Jesus Christ! - Go! Somebody stop him! - There he is! - Freeze! Could have at least pulled that punch, man. I did. Bock put out an APB on you. You really think he's in on this? I don't trust any of 'em. Do you? I only trust you. What's a narcotics cop doing with Falcone's right-hand man? Colson said, ""Cops protect the rat."" Maybe Kenzie's part of it. You think Penguin's the rat? His club caters to the mob. Maroni practically lived there. Penguin would have been privy to a lot of dirt. DA was a regular too. Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam and working a deal was his only way out. The Rata Alada. The what? Riddler's latest. The cipher in the maze. It means ""a rat with wings."" Like a stool pigeon. A penguin's got wings too. Time for me to have another conversation with him. What about the Riddler? He's gonna kill again. It's all connected. Like it or not, it's his game now. You want to find Riddler, we gotta find that rat. Kenzie and the twins, coming your way. There's Penguin. I wonder what's in the bags. You want to move in? Let's follow. They stopped at Waterfront Street. The recycling plant. I'm here. - How you doing? - Yeah, good. How are you? Good, good. Let's get in out of this deluge. It's a drug lab. Drops. This is a buy. Looks like they got Maroni's operation up and running again. Or they never shut it down at all. What are you saying? The biggest drug bust in GCPD history was a fraud? This just got complicated. What do you mean? Hey! What happened? You all right? Dangerous crowd you're stealing from. Jesus. Is this how you get your kicks, hon? Sneaking up on girls in the dark? Is that why you work in the club? It was all just a score? I would love to sit and go over every gory detail with you, bat boy... but, uh, those assholes are coming back. Jesus! Hey, Vengeance! You think you can come after my money, huh? Kenzie! Get the money! Hey! What the... Whoa! Come on! Come on! This guy's crazy! Come on! Hey! Move! Get out of the way! Come on! Get out of the way! I got you! I got you! Take that, you friggin' psycho! I got you! What the hell is this? Good cop, batshit cop? - Who's the Riddler? - Riddler? How should I know? Let's make it easy for you, Oz. Cops caught you doing something. They were gonna shut you down, put you away. So you gave up a bigger fish to save your ass. You ratted out Salvatore Maroni. His drops operation. But the cops, the city officials, the mayor, the DA, they got greedy, right? Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust. They wanted to take over the drops business too, but they needed a minor league mope like you to run it. You don't just work for Carmine Falcone. You work for them too. What are you, crazy? That why you killed the girl? I didn't kill no girl! We know she worked for you at the 44 Below. But she got too close, right? Found out from Mitchell that you were the rat, so you killed her. But somehow Riddler found out too. He knows so much about you. - You must know about him. - Who is he? Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here. Why don't you start harmonizing? There's only one problem with your little scenario, okay? I ain't no rat! You got any idea what Carmine Falcone would do to me if he heard this kind of talk? Oh, you don't wanna talk about rats, huh? Maybe we can talk about what they did to my partner's face. Holy God, what are you showing me here? - This was around his head! - Come on! Open your eyes! Are you El Rata Alada? El Rata Alada? Yeah, a ""rat with wings."" A stool pigeon. That's not you? The symbols in the maze, right here. It says you are El Rata Alada. ""You are El Rata""? It says that? Why, you got something to tell us? Yeah! It's, like, the worst Spanish I ever heard. What? It's ""La."" ""La"" rata. What, is this Riddler stupid or something? Jesus! Look at you two. World's greatest detectives! Am I the only here knows the difference between ""el"" and ""la""? Jesus! No habla espaol, fellas? Do me a favor, shithead, shut up! You think he made a mistake? He doesn't make mistakes. A rat with wings? You know what that sounds like to me? A friggin' bat! Huh? You ever think of that? ""You are El Rata."" ""You are el."" Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe he isn't as smart as... Wait. Is that him? Holy shit. What the hell does that mean? Is he or isn't he? ""I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed. But in a mansion, in a slum, I'll never know where I come from. Do you know what I am?"" Any idea? Yeah. It's an orphan. A mansion in a slum. - He's talking about the old orphanage. - The one that burned down? It was part of the Wayne estate. They donated it after they built the tower. Let's go. You guys realize I'm still here, right? You gonna untie me? How the hell am I supposed to get out of here? Hey! You goddamn sons of bitches! No guns. Yeah, man. That's your thing. What's that? Hey! Hey! Dropheads. What the hell is that? Thank you. Thank you so much. Wasn't that beautiful? Thank you all. Thank you, uh... Thank you for coming today. I believe in Gotham. I believe in its promise. But too many have been left behind for too long, and that's why I'm here today. To announce, not only my candidacy for mayor, but also the creation of the Gotham Renewal Fund. Win or lose, the Wayne Foundation pledges a $1 billion donation to start a charitable endowment for public works. I want to bypass political gridlock, and get money to people and projects who need it now, like these children behind me. ""Sins of the father."" Renewal is about growth. It is about planting seeds... ...and renewing Gotham's promise. Shall be visited upon the son. Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne. Hey! - Hello? - Dory! I need to speak to Alfred! - Oh, Mr. Wayne... - Listen to me! Something terrible is gonna happen! I'm afraid it already has, sir. About an hour ago. I'm so sorry. I've been trying to reach you. The package was intended for you. It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer. We found this too. We've sedated him. We just have to hope he stabilizes. You should go home, Mr. Wayne. Get some sleep. Is there anyone else to notify? Next of kin? No. It's just me. Selina? Can you see me? - Yeah, I can see you. - I need to talk to you. Where can we go? Cat burglar pulling another score? - What? - Wasn't sure I'd see you again. Yeah, well, things were getting a little hot for me, so... How could they do that to her? That piece of shit cop, Kenzie. Her body was in his car. I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna make him pay. You gonna help me? - Help you? - Yeah. I thought you were ""Vengeance."" Your friend got involved with the wrong people. She didn't know any better. Maybe you should have explained it to her. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means your choices have consequences. Jesus Christ. ""Choices""? You know, whoever the hell you are, you obviously grew up rich. - Was it worth it? - What? Compromising yourself for money? What did you have to do to set up that score? How close did you have to get to Penguin? To Falcone? You don't know what the hell you're talking about. Falcone owes me that money. - He owes you? - Yeah, and a lot more. Oh, really? Why's that? You know what? I can't even talk to you. No! I want to know why a guy like Falcone would owe you anything. Because he's my father! My mother worked at the 44 Below. Just like Anni. She used to take me there when I was a little girl. To the club? Yeah. I hid out in the dressing room while she worked. Used to see him there. He scared the shit out of me. And I could never understand why he looked at me the way he did. Then one night, my mother told me who he was. When I was seven, my mother was murdered. Strangled. Never found out who. Probably some creep from the club. Anyway, social services came to take me away, and he didn't say a thing. Couldn't even look at me. He owes me that money. I'm sorry. For what I said. Oh, it's all right. You assume the worst in people. Which, well... maybe we're not so different after all. Who are you under there? What are you hiding? Are you just... hideously scarred? Yeah. Listen to me. If we don't stand up for Annika, no one will. All anyone cares about in this place are these white, privileged assholes. The mayor, the commissioner, the DA. Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that psycho's right to go after these creeps. I think you'd be on his side. What do you mean, ""Thomas and Bruce Wayne""? What, do you live in a cave? The Riddler's latest. It's all about the Waynes. Listen, if I can find that dickbag Kenzie, will you help me? Please. Come on, Vengeance. Just don't make any moves without me, understand? It's a little more dangerous than you know... I told you, baby. I can take care of myself. I'm Thomas Wayne, and I approve this message. From a very young age, my family, Martha's family, the Arkhams... ...instilled in both of us that giving back is not just an obligation, it's a passion. That is our family's legacy. The Waynes and the Arkhams. Gotham's founding families. But what is their real legacy? Twenty years ago, one reporter set out to uncover the dark truth. He found shocking family secrets. How, when Martha was just a child, her mother brutally murdered her father, then committed suicide... ...and how the Arkhams used their power and money to cover it up. How Martha herself was in and out of institutions for years and they didn't want anyone to know. Thomas Wayne tried to force this crusading reporter into a hush-money agreement to save his mayoral campaign. But when the reporter refused... ...Wayne turned to longtime secret associate Carmine Falcone and had him murdered! The Waynes and the Arkhams, Gotham's legacy of lies and murder. I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne. This is your legacy too. And Gotham needs you to answer for the sins of your father. Goodbye. Do you know who I am? You're Bruce Wayne. I wanna see Carmine Falcone. See? Who is this guy who invented the ball, right? Must have made a fortune. If you think about it, the concept of it, right? Briscoe, do you know how much this sweater cost? No, boss. You know why communism failed, right? No, boss. Austerity. All right. All right. Look at that. Perfect. It's never gonna be that good again. Hey, Johnny Slick. What are you doing here? Give us a moment here, fellas. Come on. See ya, champ. Come on, sweetheart. Have a seat. I thought I might hear from you. This, uh, Riddler son of a bitch is really... stirring things up, huh? - Is it true? - What? That reporter business? What do you want to know here, kid? Did you kill him? For my father? Look, your father was in trouble. This reporter had some dirt. Some very... personal stuff about your mother, her family history. Everybody's got their dirty laundry, that's just how it is. But he didn't want none of it coming out, not right before the election. And your father tried to pay the guy off, but he wasn't going for it. So, he came to me. Well, I never seen him like that. He said, ""Carmine, I want you to put the fear of God in this guy."" And when fear isn't enough... Oof. Hmm. Your father wanted me to handle it, so I did. I handled it. I know. You thought your father was a Boy Scout. But you'd be surprised what even a good man like him is capable of in the right situation. Do me a favor. Don't lose any sleep over it. This reporter was a lowlife. He was on Maroni's payroll. - Maroni? - Oh, yeah. He could never stand your father and I had history. And after what happened with that reporter, Maroni was worried that your father would be in my pocket, forever. He would have done anything to keep him from becoming mayor. You understand? Are you saying Salvatore Maroni got my father killed? Do I know it for a fact? I'm just saying, it sure looked that way to me. This is what you wanted, huh? This little conversation here? It's been a long time coming, huh? I mean, you ain't a kid no more. You lied to me... my whole life. I spoke to Carmine Falcone. He told me what he did for my father. About Salvatore Maroni. He told you Salvatore Maroni... Had my father killed. Why didn't you tell me all this? All these years I've spent fighting for him, believing that he was a good man. He was a good man. You listen to me. Your father was a good man. - He made a mistake. - A ""mistake."" He had a man killed. Why? To protect his family image? His political aspirations? It wasn't to protect the family image, and he didn't have anyone killed. He was protecting your mother. He didn't care about his image or the campaign, any of that. He cared about her, and you, and in a moment of weakness, he turned to Falcone. But he never thought Falcone would kill that man. Your father should have known that Falcone would do anything to finally have something on him that he could use. That's who Falcone is. And that was your father's mistake. But when Falcone told him what he'd done, your father was distraught. He told Falcone he was going to the police, that he would confess everything. And that night, your father and your mother were killed. It was Falcone? Oh, I wish I knew for sure. Or maybe it was some random thug on the street who needed money, got scared, and pulled the trigger too fast. If you don't think I've spent every day searching for that answer... It was my job to protect them. Do you understand? I know you always blamed yourself. You were only a boy, Bruce. I could see the fear in your eyes, but I didn't know how to help. I could teach you how to fight, but I wasn't equipped to take care of you. You needed a father. And all you had was me. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, Alfred. God. I never thought I'd feel fear like that again. I thought I'd mastered all that. I mean, I'm not afraid to die. I realize now there's something I haven't got past. This fear... of ever going through any of that again. Of losing somebody I care about. Hey. I saw the signal. That's not you? I thought it was you. - I found him! - I see that. He had my shit and my phone. She left a message the night they took her. She called me... Gordon! Help me out, man! She got my gun! - Shut up! - Put the gun down. I'm telling you, God damn it! She called me! Here. Listen. Hey! Get back here! Where you going? Come back here! Hey, hey, what are you doing, Kenzie? You're scaring her. I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. Please, please, please. Please, don't hurt me, please. Hey, don't be scared. Come here. Now let me ask you again. - What did Mitchell tell you? - No, nothing. He... Don liked to talk. I know that. Especially to pretty girls like you. That's why I made him take your passport... until we could have this little conversation. All I want to do is get out of here, okay? You'll never hear from me again, nobody will. Please, please... We're gonna get you out of here, I promise. But first, I gotta know... What did he tell you? He just said they all made a deal with you. Oh. Hmm. He told you about that, huh? The deal. He said you gave some information on some drops thing and that's how he became mayor. He said you were a very important man. Right. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. Just take it easy. Jesus, he's strangling her. Take it easy. Rata Alada. A falcon has wings too. Falcone is the rat? Falcone works for you guys? The mayor? The DA? No. We work for him. Everybody does. How? Through Renewal. Renewal is everything. - The Renewal Fund? - Yeah. After Thomas Wayne died, they all went after it like vultures. The mayor, Falcone, Maroni. Everyone got in on it. It was perfect for making bribes, laundering money. A huge charitable fund with no oversight. Everybody got a piece. But Falcone wanted more. So he orchestrated a play to take Maroni down big. He'd rat out his drops operation, make the careers of everybody that went after him, then install them all as his puppets. You think this goddamn election matters? Falcone's the mayor. He's been the mayor for the last 20 years. Come on, Vengeance. Let's go kill that son of a bitch. - This creep too. Let's finish this. - Oh, God! No! We'll get him. - But not that way. - There is no other way! He owns the city! Cross that line... you'll become just like him. Listen to me. Don't throw your life away. Don't worry, honey. I got nine of 'em. No, don't! Hey, hey! Oh, God! She won't get out of there alive. And if she kills Falcone, we may never find the Riddler. I have to stop her. Don't you mean ""we""? I gotta do this my way. And then what? We do what Riddler said. Bring the rat into the light. Can you tell Mr. Falcone I'd like to come up? He ain't seein' nobody tonight. Tell him it's about Annika. Hey! Look who it is, huh? - Sorry to bother you. - Nah. It's fine, beautiful. I was just hoping I could talk to you for a minute? Absolutely. Alone? Hey! I'm just so worried. I don't know where she is. And I know that you're a very important man. I was hoping that maybe you could help me find her... because she's been gone so long, I'm beginning to... I'm sorry. It's okay. - I'm so sorry. - I understand. Here. No, that's okay, I have a tissue. Mr. Falcone? Vinnie! Didn't I tell you? I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think you're gonna want to see this. I'm sorry, beautiful. I'll be right back. Holy shit. That recording, provided to GC-1 by Lieutenant James Gordon of the Gotham PD. And we should warn you, the contents are extremely graphic and some of you may find it disturbing. He just said they all made a deal with you. Oh. Hmm. He told you about that, huh? The deal. He said you gave some information on some drops thing and that's how he became mayor. He said you were a very important man. Right. Hmm. Okay. Revelations of Mr. Falcone's secret role as a mafia informant... Hey, Dad. What? I'm Maria Kyle's kid. You remember her? Yeah. Just put down the gun, honey. This is for my mother. I see him! You don't think this hurts me? My own flesh and blood, huh? You made me do this. Just like your mother. He has to pay! You don't have to pay with him. You paid enough. Jesus. Look at you, man. What do you think this is? You think you're gonna scare me with that mask and that cape? I'm gonna start crying, and all of a sudden, some big secret's comin' out? Let me tell you something. Whatever I know, whatever I've done, it's all going with me to my grave. What, are you with Zorro over here? Don't you know you boys in blue work for me? I guess we don't all work for you. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, the City of Gotham will provide one to you. Do you understand these rights? Do you understand? Yeah. I'll see you when I walk out. With these rights in mind, is there anything else you wish to tell... Goddamn rat. What'd you say? Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine. Probably be your last. Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz? Maybe I am. Really, Oz? Because to me, you were always just a gimp in an empty suit. I'll spray paint your ass! What are you doing? It wasn't me! I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot! Get your hands off of me! ""Bring him into the light. And you'll find where I'm at."" There! The shots came from up there! It's Riddler. Gage, on me. Martinez, around back. Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out! He's gone. He's been here this whole time. - Lieutenant. Martinez. - Yeah? Lieutenant, we got a witness here, says she saw someone coming down the fire escape right after the shot. She said he went into the corner diner. The guy's sitting by himself at the counter, right now. Police! Hands up! He said put your goddamn hands up, you son of a bitch. I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie. Stay still! Now! Which one is you? You tell me. Let's go, pencil-neck. Get that son of a bitch out of here! ...where even murdered mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son have gathered in an emotional show of city unity. Our Dan O'Neil is live inside Rel's headquarters right now... Hey. What are all these diaries? They're ledgers. He's got thousands. He scrawled all over 'em. Rambling, ciphers, codes. Got something back on one of the IDs. Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ. - He's a forensic accountant. - Accountant? Hey, Lieutenant! You really okay with this? What about chain of evidence? You should see this. He's wearing gloves. ""Friday, July 16th. My life has been a cruel riddle I could not solve, suffocating my mind, no escape. But then, today, I saw it. A single word on this ledger, sitting on the desk beside me. 'Renewal.' The empty promise they sold to me as a child in that orphanage. One look inside, and finally I understood. My whole life has been preparing me for this. The moment when I would learn the truth. When I could finally strike back and expose their lies."" ""If you want people to understand, really understand, you can't just give them the answers. You have to confront them, torture them with the horrifying questions, just like they tortured me. I know now what I must become."" Jesus. I don't think that rat likes you, man. This one's not a rat. What is that? Some kind of pry tool? Is it a chisel? It's a murder weapon. He killed Mitchell with it. The edge will match the floorboard impression in the mayor's study. ""My confession""? What's he confessing to? He already told us he killed Mitchell. This isn't over. Oh, man. He's been posting all kinds of shit online. He's got, like, 500 followers. Real fringe types. His final post was last night. Some video. Got a lot of views, but it's password-protected. - Can you get in? - Copying his drive now. Take some time, but we'll get in. - Show me the post. - It's right here. ""The Truth Unmasked."" I think I'm his last target. You? Maybe this is all coming to an end. What is? The Batman. Yeah? Right. Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham. You're a good cop. I told you I'd see you in hell. What do you want from me? ""Want""? If only you knew how long I've been waiting for this day. For this moment. I've been invisible my whole life. I guess I won't be anymore, will I? They'll remember me now. They'll remember both of us. Bruce... Wayne. Bruce... Wayne. You know, I was there that day. The day the great Thomas Wayne announced he was running for mayor, made all those promises. Well, a week later he was dead, and everybody just forgot about us. All they could talk about was poor Bruce Wayne. Bruce Wayne, the orphan. Orphan. Living in some tower over the park isn't being an orphan. Looking down on everyone, with all that money. Don't you tell me. Do you know what being an orphan is? It's 30 kids to a room. Twelve years old and already a drophead, numbing the pain. You wake up screaming with rats chewing your fingers. And every winter one of the babies die because it's so cold. But, oh, no. Let's talk about the billionaire with the lying, dead daddy because at least the money makes it go down easy. Doesn't it? Bruce... Wayne. He's the only one we didn't get. But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we? All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks. God. Look at you. Your mask is amazing. I wish you could've seen me in mine. Ain't it funny? All everyone wants to do is unmask you, but they're missing the point. You and I both know I'm looking at the real you right now. My mask allowed me to be myself completely. No shame, no limits. Why did you write me? What do you mean? All those cards. I told you, we've been doing this together. You're a part of this. - We didn't do anything together. - We did. What did we just do? I asked you to bring him into the light, and you did. We're such a good team. We're not a team. I never could have gotten him out of there. I'm not physical. My strength is up here. I mean, I had all the pieces, I had the answers. But I didn't know how to make them listen. You gave me that. I gave you nothing. You showed me what was possible. You showed me all it takes is fear and a little focused violence. You inspired me. You're out of your goddamn mind. What? This is all in your head. You're sick, twisted. How can you say that? You think you'll be remembered? You're a pathetic psychopath, - begging for attention. - No. - You're gonna die alone in Arkham. - No. No, no! A nobody! No! Ahhh! This is not how this was supposed to go! Ahhh! I had it all planned out! We were gonna be safe here. We could watch the whole thing together. Watch what? Everything! It was all there. You mean, you didn't figure it out? Oh, you're really not as smart as I thought you were. I guess I gave you too much credit. What have you done? What's black and blue and dead all over? You. If you think you can stop what's coming... What have you done? Ave Maria What have you done? Gratia plena What have you done? Maria Gratia plena Hey! What are you doing in here? Hey, man, I don't think that you should be touching that. Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh? Killing Mitchell with a friggin' carpet tool. My uncle's a... He's an installer. You know, it's a... Oh, you know. It's a tucker. Huh. Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, guys. Uh, thanks for all the comments and a special thanks to everyone for the tips on detonators. Detonators? I just want to say this will be my last post for a little while, and, uh... what this community has meant to me these weeks, these months, let's just say none of us... is alone anymore. Okay? Jesus. Tomorrow's Election Day. And Bella Rel will win. She promised real change. But we know the truth, don't we? You've seen Gotham's true face now. Together, we've unmasked it. Its corruption, its perversion masquerading under the guise of renewal. But unmasking is not enough. The day of judgment is finally upon us. And now it is time for retribution. I've parked seven vans all along the city seawall. And on the big night, they will go boom. Boom! Boom! When the vans blow, the flooding will happen so fast, evacuation will not be an option. Those who are not washed away will race through the streets in terror. Call Gordon. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. As breaking news hits higher ground in Gotham Square Garden... ...celebrations will turn to panic, as the venue becomes the city's shelter of last resort. And that's where all of you come in. Now, when the time arrives, I will already be unmasked. The pigs will have me in their custody, but that's okay. Because then it will be your turn. You'll be there, waiting. It's time for the lies to finally end. False promises of renewal? Change? We'll give them real, real change now. We've spent our lives in this wretched place, suffering! Wondering, ""Why us?"" Now they will spend their last moments wondering, why them? I can't get through! The lines are down. Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed! I'm just trying to get out of town, man! Lady, we got bombs going off. The whole city's flooding. You're gonna have to go inside the Garden with everyone else. - Lieutenant, who's in charge? - I really don't know. We're just trying to get a handle here, sir. Right. Hey, listen! Quiet! We got an active situation. We need to sweep the building for explosives and get the mayor-elect out of here, now. - Where is she? - I can take you there. Come! - If we don't close the doors... - MCU. ...we're gonna have huge problems. The water's already started to breach. I thought this was a shelter of last resort. Yeah, for a hurricane, but not if the whole seawall comes down. I am not gonna let those people die out there. All right. I'll go calm down the crowd so we can get everyone in. It's not safe for you here. We need to get you out, Ms. Rel. - I'm not going anywhere. - We're under attack, ma'am. Exactly! That's the problem with this city. Everyone's afraid to stand up and do the right thing, but I'm not. - Excuse me. - Ma'am... Everyone, everyone, if I could just get your attention. Please! I just need your attention! You're okay! Hey! Hey! How do I get up there? Follow me, sir. No, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's done now. It's done. It's over. Hey! Hey, man, take it easy! Take it easy. Easy. Jesus. Who the hell are you? Me? I'm Vengeance. Wednesday, November 6th. The city is underwater. The National Guard is coming. Martial law is in effect... but the criminal element never sleeps. Looting and lawlessness will be rampant in the parts of the city no one can get to. I can already see things will get worse before they get better. And some will seize the chance to grab everything they can. We will rebuild. But not just our city. We must rebuild people's faith in our institutions, in our elected officials, in each other. Together, we will learn to believe in Gotham again. I'm starting to see now. I have had an effect here... but not the one I intended. Vengeance won't change the past, mine or anyone else's. I have to become more. People need hope. To know someone's out there for them. The city's angry, scarred, like me. Our scars can destroy us. Even after the physical wounds have healed. But if we survive them, they can transform us. They can give us the power to endure... and the strength to fight. We are live. As you can see, the masked vigilante atop Gotham Square Garden helping to save the lives of hundreds of victims. And now as first responders desperately scramble to help the injured, a mysterious masked man emerges, heroically pulling the victims right through that skylight... Isn't that just terrible? Him... raining on your parade like that? What is it they say? ""One day you're on top, the next... you're a clown."" Well, let me tell you, there are worse things to be. Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad. You did so well. And you know, Gotham loves a comeback story. Who are you? Well, that's the question, isn't it? Riddle me this... ""The less of them you have, the more one is worth."" A friend. You're leaving. Jesus. Don't you ever just say hello? Where will you go? I don't know. Upstate. Bludhaven, maybe. Why? You asking me to stay? You know this place is never gonna change. With Carmine gone, it's only gonna get worse for you. There's gonna be a power grab. It'll be bloody. I know. But the city can change. It won't. I have to try. It's gonna kill you eventually. You know that. Listen. Why don't you come with me? Get into some trouble. Knock off some CEO hedge fund types. It'll be fun. The bat and the cat. It's got a nice ring. Who am I kidding? You're already spoken for. You should go. Selina... Take care of yourself. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, We have breaking news. It happened just a few moments ago apparently. We have very little information available. We have, I understand, an eyewitness on the phone right now. Rog. ...in the middle of the plaza at 8:52. With limited information at this point, we don't know about injuries in the building... What the hell happened? A bomb. I think. So sad. - There was a loud sound... - Rog, I got to, uh... I can only describe it as, it sounded like a missile, not an airplane. Then there was a loud explosion and... Wanna go higher? You got it! Let it in there! So, the Red Sox with two down on a base hit. - First time through the order? - Third. Third? - What inning is this? - Fifth. Oh, boy. Your hands are... disgusting. Let me do it. Disgusting? Wow.

Dive, dive, dive! - He's out! - Ooh! Hey, how do you say ""dive""? - Dive? - It's a tough one. We'll take third ball now. Let's do it. Whoo! Come on. - Go Marcus! - Here we go. Nice little hit. Here we go. Whoo! Ball! That's okay. Good eye, good eye! Alright, Marcus. Wait for your pitch, buddy. This damage with two outs... Shit. Shit. Strike one! It's alright. It's alright. Goddamn thing. Strike two! Come on. Let's go. Alright, folks. That's the game. Why don't we all head to our cars. - Okay, let's go. - Molly! - Hey. - Hey. - What was that? - I don't know. - I don't know what that was. - I'm gonna take the kids home, okay? Okay, yeah. My truck's up on Main Street. Okay. Alright, everybody in. Let's go. I'll go with Dad. Okay. Straight home. Lee? Lee? - Hey. You alright? - Yeah, good. Your brother say anything going on at the base? Not that I know of. He just called. Let me call him back. Alright. Yeah, let me know. My truck's up there. Don't worry. Wait here. Ronnie, what do we got? We got units headed out there now, EMS and fire. - Whereabouts? - I think out by Walker's farm. What's wrong? It's okay, honey. It's okay, honey bunny. It's okay, baby. It's okay. - Mom? - Yeah. What is happening? Oh! Oh, my God! It's okay. It's okay. We're okay. - That's Dad. That's Dad! - Where, where, where? Mom. Mom! Oh, my God! - You're okay, baby. - I'm okay. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. We were on Main Street and, um... I don't... Are you there? Mom? Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily... It's okay. Shh. It's Dad! Down. Get down. Let's go. Wait here. I'm going back in... Stay here. Run! Shh! Baby, please. Shh! Baby, please. No. Please. It's okay, honey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Go. Jump. You can't stay. I don't know why you came all the way up here, but you can't stay. Up? There's not enough food... water. There's not enough anything. How do you know we traveled up? There's nothing I can do. You won't survive. Show me your face. I can't help you. Please, I can't help you. Emmett? Emmett? Please. Breathe, baby. How does it work? There's three feet of concrete. They'd have to be right above us to hear. What is it? Some kind of... Some kind of feedback from the microphone? It just works. I don't know. Just never seen one dead before. How is he? He's, um... Well, it didn't reach the bone. But that wrap won't last. I'm sorry. - For what? - The boys. - I assume... - That day. And Nora? Eleven weeks ago. She was sick. Held out as long as we could in the house. But the pain just... It was when she started screaming... we had to come here. That was smart. It wasn't enough. Can I ask you a question? When you saw the flame... night after night... Did you know it was him? Yes. And did you ever think to come for us? No. The people that are left... what they've become... You don't know, do you? Well, I do. They're not a kind of people worth saving.  Somewhere   Beyond the sea  What is it? - What is it? - Music!  My lover stands On golden sand And watches...  - It's... - ""Beyond the Sea."" - Have you heard this? - Yes. No. Dad would've heard this. It's the same song. It's been playing over and over the last four months. You're lying! My Dad used the radio every day! - What's she saying? - She thinks he would've heard it. Who? Lee. It's the valley. It's the valley. I tried the radio from our house too, but we never heard anything until we got up here. Your dad was never gonna make it work. You're nothing like him! Does this mean that there are more people? - I don't know, baby. I don't. - No! There's nothing left. I told you, there is nothing left. I want you gone tomorrow. It's not a song. On the radio. Beyond The Sea... Right? It's not a song... It's a signal. They're telling us where to look. I looked up the radio station. ...where the song is coming from. It's an island! I can follow the train tracks... It's not even one day. Then I can find a boat. You can't do this. If I can find the song. Where it's coming from... I can use this... to change this... into this! Mom, will never... let you go. I can save them. I can save us. I'll tell her. Mom... I'll tell her. Please don't do this! I need to try. Why? Because Dad would. And look what happened to him. You have to find her for me. She's gone to get help, and I need you to go and find her and bring her back to me. - Alright, listen to me. - Please, Emmett, I'm begging you. - Evelyn... - I'm begging you. We were friends. Emmett, please. Lee is gone. Now he's gone. It's a shame. Because if he were here... he'd look you right in the eye, and he'd tell you that his little girl is absolutely the kind of person worth saving. So please go find her... and bring her back to me. Go! Alright, listen to me. We stay here until they're gone, and then we go. You understand? She can't hear. You can't hear. Shit! I'm taking you home. We'll wait here until they're gone. Goddamn it! Enunciate... Remember? I'm... taking you... back. Hey. They heard... the shot. Okay? No! You can't do this. Help me. Enough, please. Enough. I'm taking you home! What home? You said... your wife... Hey, don't... Do not... talk about my wife! You said... ...that you could not do enough. Now you can. I found a boat. Don't go. I will be right back. A matter of hours. But the baby, I don't know how... I showed you how to do it. Stay calm. You have everything you need. Everything. Please... Look... If I don't go... Soon you'll be in a lot of pain. And I won't know... ...I won't lose you too. Breathe... Okay? I'll be right back.  You make me happy   When skies are gray   You'll never know, dear   How much I love you   So please Don't take my sunshine away  I'll be right back. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Hey. Look at me. Hey. Baby. Marcus. Marcus! Marcus, wake up! Oh! Thank you. You heard the song. You figured it out. She did. - I thought she was... - Figured it out. I'm not sure anyone here can actually believe it. I think most people had finally given up hope. Been a long time. How long? That day. We got here the same way as you. We were in the city when we heard the hurricane sirens. Once they knew they couldn't swim... the National Guard were told to start loading people onto boats. Any boat that they could find. So as soon as people saw the first one get out safe... Well... everyone just started pushing forward. And that's when they started screaming. They had 12 boats lined up on the dock that day. Only two got out. Anyway, you're here now. A new day. And where are you coming from? Ah, just over the Appalachian ridge. And how long did it take? Just under two days. That's determination. It's necessity. To get help? No. To give it. He said he'll do it. Yes. He said yes. Thank you. I wanted to say... I'm sorry... I doubted you. I was wrong. And you were right. I'm nothing like him. You are. Both. Get inside. Get inside! Get inside! Stay down! Get down! Hey, door's locked. You got a key? Where is it? We went too fast. What if we lost it? Give me the key. Jesus Christ, it went back! - No, no, no. - My family. Alright. Listen to me. I have to get back to my family.  Somewhere   Beyond the sea   Somewhere waiting for me   My lover stands On golden sand   And watches the ships That go sailin'   Somewhere   Beyond the sea   She's there watching for me   If I could fly like birds  <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, (IN ENGLISH) Open your eyes. This is where our magic comes from? Mm-hmm. This candle holds the miracle given to our family. How did we get a miracle? Long ago, when my three babies had just been born, your Abuelo Pedro and I were forced to flee our home. And though many joined us, hoping to find a new home, we could not escape the dangers and your abuelo was lost. But in our darkest moment, we were given a miracle. The candle became a magical flame that could never go out. And it blessed us with a refuge in which to live. A place of wonder. YOUNG MIRABEL: An encanto. ABUELA: An encanto. The miracle grew. And our house, our casita itself came alive to shelter us. When my children came of age, the miracle blessed each with a magic Gift to help us. And when their children came of age... YOUNG MIRABEL: They got magic, too. ABUELA: (CHUCKLING) That's right! And together, our family's Gifts have made our new home a paradise. Tonight, this candle will give you your Gift, mi vida.

Ooh! Ooh! (CHUCKLES) Mirabel, I know you want to help. But tonight must go perfectly. The whole town relies on our family, on our Gifts. So, the best way for some of us to help is to step aside.

The cracks were there. They were everywhere. The house was in trouble, -the candle was... -(SCOFFS) Abuela, I promise... That's enough. There is nothing wrong with La Casa Madrigal. The magic is strong. -And so are the drinks. -(CROWD LAUGHS) Please! Music! -A bailar! A bailar! -Psst. -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) -(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) MIRABEL: If it was all in my head, how did I cut my hand? I would never ruin Antonio's night. Is that really what you think? What I think is that today was very hard for you. That's... (GRUNTS) I was looking out for the family. And I might not be super strong like Luisa, or effortlessly perfect like seorita perfecta Isabela who's never even had a bad hair day, but... (SIGHS) Whatever. I wish you could see yourself the way I do. You are perfect just like this. You're just as special as anyone else in this family. Mm-hmm. You just healed my hand with an arepa con queso. I healed your hand with my love for my daughter -with her wonderful brain... -(GROANS) ...and big heart, cool glasses... Stop! Mam! (IN ENGLISH) I know what I saw. Mira, my brother Bruno lost his way in this family. I don't want the same for you. Get some sleep. You'll feel better tomorrow. Ay, Pedro. I need you. Cracks in our casita. If our family knew how vulnerable we truly are... If our miracle is dying... We cannot lose our home again. (SIGHS) Why is this happening? Open my eyes. If the answer is here, help me find it. Help me protect our family. Help me save our miracle. I will save the miracle. Wait. How do I save a miracle? I figure out what's happening to the miracle. Oh, I have no idea. But there is one person in this family who hears everything about everything. So, if anyone would know what's wrong with the magic... -Hey! -MIRABEL: ...it's her. Dolores, hey. You know, out of all my older cousins, you're, like, my favorite cousin, so I feel like I can talk to you about anything, ergo you can talk to me about anything. Like the problem with the magic last night that no one seemed to worry about, but maybe you heard about that maybe I should know about. Camilo! Stop pretending you're Dolores so you can have seconds. Worth a shot. Ah! (GRUNTS) The only one worried about the magic is you and the rats talking in the walls. Oh, and Luisa, I heard her eye twitching all night. (SQUEAKS) There we go. Everyone, to the table! Let's go, let's go. -Luisa. -ABUELA: Family. We are all thankful for Antonio's wonderful new (GRUNTS) Gift. I told them to warm up your seat. Thank you, Toito. I'm sure today we'll find a way to put your blessings to good use. (SOFTLY) Luisa, Dolores says you're totally freaking out. Any chance you maybe know something about last night with the magic... -(GASPS) You do! -ABUELA: Mirabel! If you can't pay attention, I will help you. -Oh, actually... -Casita! As I was saying, we must never take our miracle for granted, so today we will work twice as hard. -Mm-hmm. I will help Luisa. -Stop. First, an announcement. I've spoken to the Guzmns about Mariano's proposal to Isabela. Dolores, do we have a date? Tonight. He wants five babies. -(ISABELA GULPS) -Wonderful! Such a fine young man with our perfect Isabela will bring a new generation of magical blessings and make both of our families stronger. Okay. Our community is counting on us. La Familia Madrigal! ALL: La Familia Madrigal! La Familia Madrigal! Luisa, hey. What? -(GRUNTS) Sorry. -What is your problem? MIRABEL: Hey! Luisa, hold up! -(LUISA GRUNTS) -(BELLS RINGING) SEORA OZMA: Luisa, can you -re-route the river? -Will do. Luisa, the donkeys got out again. LUISA: On it. Luisa! (YELPS) Wait a second! (GROANS) You gotta tell me about the magic. What's going on? What are you hiding? Nothing. Just got a lot of chores, so maybe you should just go home. Luisa, my house is leaning to the... Dolores said your eye was twitching, and it never twitches. Something's making you nervous. Hey, move. You're gonna make me drop a donkey. Luisa, will you just... (SCOFFS) -Just tell me what it is. -There's nothing to tell. You're obviously worried about something. Luisa, if you know what's hurting the magic and it gets worse, 'cause you won't tell me -what's wrong... -(LOUDLY) Nothing's wrong! Wow, uh, sorry. That... That snuck out there. What I meant was, um... Why would anything be wrong? I'm totally fine. The magic's fine. Luisa's fine. I'm totally not nervous. Your eye is doing the thing... I'm the strong one I'm not nervous I'm as tough as the crust Of the Earth is Okay. LUISA: I move mountains I move churches And I glow 'cause I know What my worth is Of course, I mean... Hey, where are you going? I don't ask How hard the work is Got a rough Indestructible surface Diamonds and platinum I find 'em I flatten 'em I take what I'm handed I break what's demanded But under the surface I feel berserk As a tightrope walker In a three-ring circus Under the surface Was Hercules ever like ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"" -(SCREAMS, WHIMPERS) -Under the surface I'm pretty sure I'm worthless If I can't be of service A flaw or a crack The straw in the stack That breaks the camel's back What breaks the camel's back? It's pressure Like a drip, drip, drip That'll never stop Whoa Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip Till you just go pop Whoa Give it to your sister Your sister's older Give her all the heavy things We can't shoulder Who am I If I can't run with the ball? If I fall to pressure Like a grip, grip, grip And it won't let go Whoa Pressure like A tick, tick, tick Till it's ready to blow Whoa Give it to your sister Your sister's stronger See if she can hang on A little longer Who am I If I can't carry it all? If I falter Under the surface I hide my nerves And it worsens I worry Something is gonna hurt us Under the surface The ship doesn't swerve As it heard How big the iceberg is Under the surface I think about my purpose Can I somehow preserve this? Line up the dominos A light wind blows You try to stop it topplin' But on and on it goes But wait If I could shake The crushing weight Of expectations Would that free Some room up for joy Or relaxation? Or a simple pleasure Instead we measure This growing pressure Keeps growing Keep going 'Cause all we know is Pressure like A drip, drip, drip That'll never stop Whoa Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip Till you just go pop Whoa Give it to your sister It doesn't hurt And see if she can handle Every family burden Watch as she buckles And bends but never breaks No mistakes Just pressure Like a grip, grip, grip And it won't let go Whoa Pressure like A tick, tick, tick Till it's ready to blow Whoa Give it to your sister And never wonder If the same pressure Would have pulled you under Who am I If I don't have what it takes? No cracks No breaks No mistakes No pressure I think you're carrying way too much... (GRUNTS) Maybe I overdo it. Yep. Um... There is something you should know. Last night, when you saw the cracks, I felt weak. (HESITATING) What? -MAN: Luisa! The donkeys! -On it! Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? What do you think's hurting the magic? Don't know, but I heard the grown-ups once. Before To Bruno left, he had, like, some terrible vision about it. To Bruno? What was in his vision? No one knows. They never found it. But if something's wrong with the magic, start with Bruno's tower. Find that vision. Wait! How do you find a vision? -What am I even looking for? -(DONKEY BRAYS) If you find it, you'll know. But be careful. That place is off limits for a reason. ABUELA: Such a perfect match. So perfect. And so good for the encanto. Hmm. Casita. Can you turn off the sand? You can't help in here? I'll be fine. I need to do this. For you, for Abuela, maybe a little for me. ""Find the vision, save the..."" Wow. -Oh, hello. -(SQUAWKS) Lot of stairs, but at least I'll have a friend. No. He flew away immediately. -(SQUAWKING) -(GROANS) All right. (SINGING) Welcome to the family Madrigal There's so many stairs In the casa Madrigal You think there would be Another way to Get so high 'Cause we're magic, but no Magical how many stairs fit in here! Bruno, your room is the worst! Come on... Okay, I can do this. Oh... (GRUNTS) Whoo! -(DISTANT THUD) -(GASPS) -(RATTLING) -(GASPS) MIRABEL: Quitter! Empty. (SIGHS) What's hurting the magic? Me. Where are you coming from in such a hurry? I'm sorry, I was... -What is in your hair? -(HESITATING) LUISA: My Gift! -(SOBBING) I'm losing my Gift! -What? Mirabel and I were having this little talk about me carrying too much. So, I tried not to carry so much, but I realized it was putting me behind. And I knew I was gonna let everyone down. And I felt really bad, so I was grabbing all the donkeys, but then when I went to throw the donkeys in the barn, they were heavy! (SOBBING) What did you do? What did you say to her? Nothing. I... I don't... -Mirabel... (SIGHS) -(CHURCH BELLS RINGING) I have to go get the Guzmns for Isabela's engagement. Stay away from Luisa until I can talk to her. Tonight, we can't have any more problems. And whatever you're doing, stop doing it. -(LUISA SOBBING) -(CREAKING) Why am I in your vision, Bruno? -(THUNDER RUMBLES) -(GASPS) Ta! Jeez. Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to... Shoo, shoo, shoo! (GRUNTS) I just wanted to get the last of Toito's things and then I heard the name we do not speak. Great. Now I'm thundering, and that thunder will lead to a drizzle and a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle... Clear skies, clear skies. (EXHALES) Clear skies. Ta Pepa? If... (HESITATING) If he had a vision about someone, what would it mean for them? We don't talk about Bruno. I know. It's just hypothetically, if he saw you... Mirabel, please, we need to get ready for the Guzmns. I just wanna know if it was generally positive or, like, less positive... -It was a nightmare! -Flix! Hey, she needs to know, Pepi, she needs to know. We don't talk about Bruno. He would see something terrible. And then... Boom! It would happen. We don't talk about Bruno. What if you didn't understand what he saw? Then you better figure it out, because it was coming for you. We don't talk About Bruno-no-no-no We don't talk about Bruno -But it was my wedding day -It was our wedding day We were getting ready And there wasn't a cloud In the sky No clouds allowed in the sky Bruno walks in With a mischievous grin Thunder You're telling the story Or am I? I'm sorry, mi vida Go on Bruno says it looks like rain Why did he tell her? In doing so He floods my brain Abuela gets the umbrella PEPA: Married in a hurricane What a joyous day But anyway We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no We don't talk about Bruno Hey Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling I can always hear him Sort of muttering And mumbling I associate him with The sound of falling sand It's a heavy lift With a Gift so humbling Always left Abuela and the family fumbling Grappling with prophecies They couldn't understand Do you understand? Seven-foot frame Rats along his back When he calls your name It all fades to black Yeah, he sees your dreams And feasts on your screams We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no We don't talk about Bruno He told me my fish would die The next day dead CHORUS: No, no He told me I'd grow a gut And just like he said -No, no -He said that all my hair Would disappear Now look at my head CHORUS: No, no Your fate is sealed When your prophecy is read He told me That the life of my dreams Would be promised And someday be mine He told me That my power would grow Like the grapes That thrive on the vine ABUELA: Oye Mariano's on his way He told me That the man of my dreams Would be just out of reach Betrothed to another -It's like I hear him now -Hey, sis I want not a sound out of you DOLORES: I can hear him now Um, Bruno Yeah, about that Bruno I really need to know About Bruno Give me the truth And the whole truth, Bruno Isabela Your boyfriend's here! ALL: Time for dinner -It was my wedding day -It was our wedding day And there wasn't a cloud In the sky No clouds allowed in the sky ISABELA: He told me that my power would grow FLIX: Thunder PEPA: You're telling the story or am I? ABUELA: Oye Mariano's on his way PEPA: Bruno says it looks like rain FLIX: Why did he tell her? PEPA: In doing so, he floods my brain Abuela gets the umbrella PEPA: Married in a hurricane ALL: He's here, don't talk about Bruno-no Why did I talk about Bruno? ALL: Not a word about Bruno I never should have Brought up Bruno Miraboo! Got your party pants on? 'Cause I... I broke into Bruno's tower. I found his last vision. The family's in trouble. The magic is dying. The house is breaking, Luisa's gift is fading. And I think it's all because of me? P? We say nothing. Abuela wants tonight to be perfect. Until the Guzmns leave, you did not break into Bruno's tower. The magic is not dying. The house is not breaking. Luisa's gift is not fading. (SOFTLY) No one will know. Just act normal. -No one has to know. -(DOLORES SQUEAKS) She's gonna tell everyone. -ABUELA: Time to eat! -Miercoles. The Guzmns and the Madrigals together will be so good for the encanto. Yes. Then, let's hope tonight is not a horrible disaster. -(LAUGHTER) -ABUELA: To a perfect night! -Salud! -ALL: Salud! -MARIANO: Avocado? -(GRUNTS, GASPS) -(WHISPERS) -(COUGHS) Camilo. Fix your face. -ISABELA: Water? -(CAMILO WHISPERING) -(CLEARS THROAT) -Mirabel. -(GRUNTS) -The cream, please? -P, the cream? -(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) ...Bruno's vision. -Pepa, the cloud. -(GASPS) (WHISPERING) Clear skies, clear skies, clear skies. (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) Bruno's vision. -MIRABEL: Oh. -(CRACKING) -MARIANO: Mirabel? -(GRUNTS) Everything okay? (CHUCKLES) Everything is great. She's just excited. For you to propose. Which, uh, you should do! -Yes. -As fast as you can. Uh, I was actually gonna... You were actually gonna. Great! (HESITATING) Well, since everyone here has a talent, my Mariano wanted to begin with a song! Luisa, could you bring over the piano? -(VOICE BREAKING) Okay. -(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Uh, it's actually family tradition to sing after. Isabela, most graceful of all the Madrigals. -Um... -You're doing great. -The most perfect flower... -(CHITTERING) -(MIRABEL GASPS) -...in this entire encanto... No! -(GRUNTING) -(PIANO CREAKS) Will you marry... No! -(CONTINUES SOBBING) -(SCREECHING) (SHRIEKS) What is happening? Mirabel found Bruno's vision. She's in it. She's gonna destroy the magic and now, we're all doomed! -(GASPS) -(GROANS) -(MARIANO CRIES) -Seora, por favor! Abuela, please! There's gotta be an explanation. I hate you! -(SOBBING) I'm a loser! -Luisa! What did you do? I'm not doing anything! It's Bruno's vision! It's... Huh? The magic is strong! Everything is fine! We are the Madrigals! -Mirabel! -(THUNDER RUMBLES) -(RAT SQUEAKS) -(GASPS) Hey! It's okay, mami. Deep breath in, deep breath out. -(GASPS) -(GRUNTING) Stop! Stop! (GASPS) No! No! Help! Help... Casita! Casita! (PANTING) Help me! Help me! You're very sweaty. (GRUNTS) -(SCREAMS) -(GASPS) Oh, no! Hmm. -Bye. -What? No. Hold on! Wait! Wait! -(THUD) -Ow. Why did you take the vision? Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood. -MIRABEL: What does it mean? -(INHALES SHARPLY) Is it why you came back or... -(EXHALES DEEPLY) -To Bruno? Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood. You were never supposed to see that vision. No one was. -But... (SPITS) -A little salt. -Sugar. -(SPITS) MIRABEL: (IN ENGLISH) Wait. Have you been in here patching the cracks? Oh, that? No, no, no. I'm too scared to go near those things. All the patching's done by Hernando. Who is Hernando? (IN DEEP VOICE) I'm Hernando and I'm scared of nothing! It's actually me. (CHUCKLES) I used to say my real Gift was ""acting."" (CHUCKLES) (IN ALTERED VOICE) I'm Jorge. I make the spackle. How long have you been back here? You never left. Well, I left my tower, which was, you know, a lot of stairs and here, eh, kitchen adjacent. Ooh, ooh, plus, free entertainment. So, what do you like? You like sports? Game shows? Telenovelas? Their love could never be. I don't understand. Well, because she's his aunt and she has amnesia so she can't remember that she's his aunt. It's like a very forbidden kind of... I don't understand why you left, but didn't leave. Oh, well, because, huh, the mountains around the encanto are pretty tall. And, uh, like I said, free food and everything. You guys love the free food, don't ya? Always hungry. Never satisfied. Yeah, my Gift wasn't helping the family, but, uh, I love my family, you know? I just don't know how to... I just don't know how to... Well, anyway, I think you should go, because, um, I don't really have a good reason, but, if I did, you'd be like, ""I should go, because that's a good reason."" Why was I in your vision? To Bruno? I just wanted to make the family proud of me. Just once. But if I should stop, if I'm hurting my family, just tell me. -I can't tell you... -(MIRABEL SIGHS) ...because I don't know. I had this vision the night that you didn't get your Gift. Abuela worried about the magic. So, she begged me to look into the future. See what it meant. And I saw the magic in danger. Our house breaking. And then, and then, and then, I saw you. But the vision was different. It... it would change. And there was no one answer. No clear fate. Like your future was undecided. But I knew how it was gonna look. I knew what everyone would think because I'm Bruno and everyone always assumes the worst, so... (SIGHS) so... You left to protect me? I don't know which way it'll go, but my guess... the family, the encanto and the fate of the miracle itself... Well, it's all gonna come down to you. Or maybe I'm wrong. You know, it's a mystery. That's why this vision is... Look, if I could help any more, I would, but that's all I know. Good luck. I wish I could've seen more. Yeah. Yeah. You wish you could have seen more, so see more! Have another vision. Oh. No, no. See, I don't do visions anymore. -But you could. -But I won't. You can't say the weight of the world is on your shoulders. The end. If our fate's up to me, me says have another vision. Maybe it'll show me what to do. Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't, you wrecked my vision cave. Which is a problem, 'cause I need a big open space. -We'll find one. -Where? ANTONIO: Use my room. The rats told me everything. Don't eat those. Our family needs help, and you need to get outta here. Meh. You should have told me the second you saw the vision. Think of the family. I was thinking of my daughter. Pepa, calm down. -I'm doing my best. -Yes. You're lucky it's not a hurricane. Mam, you've always been too hard on Mirabel. Look around. We must protect our family, our encanto. -We cannot lose our home. -(DOOR OPENS) Seora, perdon. People in town are becoming anxious about the magic. They want to see you. (SIGHS) Mirabel was in that vision for a reason. Find her. -(RUMBLING) -(BIRDS SQUAWKING) We might wanna hurry. You can't hurry the future. Um... (CHUCKLES) What if I show you something worse? If I see something that you don't like, you're gonna be all, ""Bruno makes bad things happen. ""Oh, he's creepy and his vision killed my goldfish."" I don't think you make bad things happen. Sometimes family weirdos just get a bad rap. You can do this. For the nerves. I can do this. I can do this, I can do this, I can do this. You might wanna hang on. BRUNO: It's just the same thing. I gotta stop! No. I need to know which way it goes. There's gotta be an answer. Something we're not seeing! You're looking at the same thing that I am. If there was something else... There! Over there! BRUNO: Butterfly! Follow the butterfly! Where is that? BRUNO: (HESITATING) It's all out of order. It's the candle. The candle's getting brighter! I think you're gonna help the candle! How? Uh, there's someone with you. And you... -You fight her! -What? Wait, no, no. Is that a hug? Am I fighting or hugging? An embrace. An embrace! To make the candle bright you have to embrace her. Embrace who? BRUNO: Oh... Almost there. -Who is it? -Almost there. Oh, oh. I got it! (INCREDULOUSLY) Isabela? Oh, your sister? That's great! (SIGHS) Every time. MIRABEL: (SCOFFS) Why would embracing Isabela do anything? I don't know. Our family got a miracle. How do you help a family miracle? You hug a sister. Mirabel? (SIGHS) Mirabel? (BURBLING) (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Mirabel? Well, I think we're running out of time here. It's not gonna work. She won't hug me ever, okay? She hates me! Also, I don't know if you heard, I ruined her proposal! Plus, P.S... -(WHISPERS) Mirabel? -...she is just annoying. -Of course it's Isabela! -Mirabel? What's her problem with me anyway? She's the one with roses coming out of her... (LOUDLY) Mirabel! Sorry, sorry, sorry. You see, you're missing the point. The fate of the family, it's not up to her. It's up to you. You're exactly what this family needs. You just have to see it. By yourself, after I leave. (GRUNTS) What, you're not coming? (IN DEEP VOICE) It was your vision, Mirabel. Not mine. You're afraid Abuela will see you. (IN NORMAL VOICE) Yep. I mean, yes, that too. Hey, after you save the miracle, come visit. After I save the miracle, I'm bringing you home. Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood. (EXHALES) You got this. Just gonna save the miracle. With a hug. Isa? Hey. I know we've had our issues, but I'm (HESITATES) ready to be a better sister... to you. So, we should just hug. Let's hug it out, huh? ISABELA: ""Hug it out""? Luisa can't lift an empanada, Mariano's nose looks like a smashed papaya! Have you lost your mind? Isa, I feel like you're upset. And you know what cures being upset? A warm embrace. Get out. -(HESITATING) -Everything was perfect. Abuela was happy. The family was happy. You wanna be a better sister? Apologize for ruining my life. Go on. Apologize. I... am... sorry... Hmm. ...that your life is so great! Out. Wait! (GRUNTS) Fine! I apologize! I wasn't trying to ruin your life! (GRUNTS) Some of us have bigger problems, -you selfish... -(GASPS) ...entitled princess! ""Selfish""? I've been stuck being perfect my whole entire life! And literally, the only thing you have ever done for me is mess things up! Nothing is messed up! You can still marry that big dumb hunk! I never wanted to marry him! I was doing it for the family! Oh, my gosh. Isa, that is a very serious confession. (SIGHS) Okay, get over here. Bring it in. Isa? I just made something unexpected Something sharp Something new Isa? Uh, this is the part where we... It's not symmetrical Or perfect But it's beautiful And it's mine What else can I do? Wait Bring it in, bring it in Good talk Bring it in, bring it in What else can I do? Let's hug Bring it in, bring it in Free hugs Bring it in, bring it in I grow rows and rows of roses Flor de mayo by the mile I make perfect Practiced poses So much hides behind my smile What could I do if I just grew What I was feeling In the moment? Do you know Where you're going? What could I do if I just knew It didn't need to be perfect? It just needed to be And they let me be A hurricane of jacarands -Strangling figs -Fig! Hanging vines This is fine Palma de cera fills the air As I climb and I push through What else can I do? Can I deliver us A river of sundew? Careful, it's carnivorous A little just won't do I wanna feel the shiver Of something new I'm so sick of pretty I want something true Don't you? You just seemed Like your life's been a dream Since the moment You opened your eyes How far do these roots Go down? All I know Are the blossoms you grow But it's awesome to see how You rise -How far can I rise? -How far can you rise? Through the roof to the skies Let's go A hurricane of jacarands -Strangling figs -Go -Hanging vines -Grow Palma de cera fills the air As I climb and I push through What else? What else? What can you do when you are Deeply madly truly In the moment? Seize the moment Keep going What can you do when you know Who you want to be Isn't perfect? -But I'll still be okay -Hey, everybody clear the way I'm coming through With tabebuia Tabebuia -Making waves -Making waves -Changing minds -You've changed mine The way is clearer 'Cause you're here And well I owe this all to you What else can I do? MIRABEL: Show them what you can do -What else can I do? -There's nothing you can't do ISABELA: What else can I do? -You're a bad influence. -(BOTH LAUGH) ABUELA: (ANGRILY) What is going on? -(GASPS) -Abuela? It's okay! Everything's... We're gonna save the miracle. The magic... What are you talking about? Look at our home! Look at your sister! Please just... Isabela wasn't happy. Of course she isn't happy. You ruined her proposal. No, no, no. She needed me to ruin her proposal. -And then we did all this! -(ABUELA GRUNTS) And the candle burned brighter and the cracks... -Mirabel. -That's why I'm in the vision! I'm saving the miracle! You have to stop, Mirabel! The cracks started with you. -Bruno left because of you. -(CRACKING) Luisa's losing her powers. Isabela's out of control. Because of you! I don't know why you weren't given a Gift, but it is not an excuse for you to hurt this family. -(BREATHING HEAVILY) -(CRACKING GROWS LOUDER) I will never be good enough for you. Will I? No matter how hard I try. No matter how hard any of us tries. Luisa will never be strong enough. Isabela won't be perfect enough. Bruno left our family because you only saw the worst in him. Bruno didn't care about this family. He loves this family. I love this family. We all love this family. You're the one that doesn't care. You're the one breaking our home. Don't you ever... The miracle is dying, because of you. (GASPING) No, no, no! FLIX: (GASPS) The candle! Casita! Get me up there! No! (GROANS, PANTS) No! (PANTING) Careful, Antonio! (GRUNTS) We gotta get out of here! Mirabel! Mirabel! Mirabel, we have to get out! -Mirabel! -Mirabel! JULIETA: Mirabel, leave it! AGUSTN: Mirabel! The house is going to fall! JULIETA: Mirabel, get out! AGUSTN: Mirabel! No. -(CREAKING) -(GASPS) JULIETA: Mirabel! Mirabel, are you hurt? Mirabel! PEPA: Julieta, come quick! -(BREATHING HEAVILY) -Julieta! Don't move. I'll be right back. PEPA: How did this happen? DOLORES: Here, let me help you. Let me help you. AGUSTN: Everyone okay? PEPA: Antonio, don't cry, papito. FLIX: How is this possible? The encanto's broken. PEPA: What do we do now? CAMILO: My powers. They're gone. What about Antonio? What is he gonna do? Mirabel? Mirabel! Where's Mirabel? Where is she? Mirabel! FLIX: Mirabel? Mirabel! LUISA: Mirabel? Mirabel! FLIX: Mirabel! They haven't found her yet? -Mirabel! -Mirabel! Mirabel! ABUELA: Mirabel. I'm sorry. (CRIES) I didn't want to hurt us. I just wanted to be something I'm not. I've never been able to come back here. This river is where we were given our miracle. Where Abuelo Pedro... I thought we would have a different life. I thought I would be a different woman. MAN: (SINGING IN SPANISH) Two caterpillars In love Spend their nights and dawns Full of hunger They keep walking And navigating the world That changes and keeps changing Navigating a world That changes and keeps changing Two caterpillars stop the wind As they hold each other with warmth and consent Keep growing They don't know when To find some corner shelter The time keeps changing They are inseparable And the weather keeps changing Oh, caterpillars Don't hold each other any longer You must grow apart and return That's the way forward Miracles are coming Chrysalises are coming You must part And construct your own future Oh, caterpillars Don't hold each other any longer You must grow apart and return That's the way forward Miracles are coming Chrysalises are coming You must part And construct your own future Two caterpillars Disoriented In two cocoons All bundled up ABUELA: I was given a miracle. A second chance. And I was so afraid to lose it that I lost sight of who our miracle was for. And I am so sorry. You never hurt our family, Mirabel. We are broken... because of me. MIRABEL: Abuela. I can finally see. You lost your home. Lost everything. You suffered so much, all alone, so it would never happen again. We were saved because of you. We were given a miracle, because of you.

Sure. Mom, it was all my fault. I shouldn't have lied to Dad. I shouldn't have fooled around. I will never lie again, ever! Mom! I'm your uncle. Not your mom. Why did you apply for the police academy? I want... I want to commit... a perfect crime. Qin, you gonna eat or not? Since birth, people are destined to play different roles. Some roles are good, while others are evil. What's your role? Qin, I'm gonna eat yours too. When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss is also gazing into you. It's ok to gaze, but don't linger. Qin, I left the soup for you. Qin Feng. There is ice cream too. Qin Feng. What's your role? Are you a man or a monster? There's low-calorie yogurt. Qin Feng. And free booze too. Qin Feng, are you a man or a monster? Daddy, I'm sorry! Are you a man or a monster? Have some. Qin Feng. Qin. Qin Feng. Qin. Qin Feng. Qin. You hit me? No, I didn't. You didn't hit me? Were... were you sleepwalking? You were the sleeping one. We'll soon be landing at TokyoNarita International Airport. Did you eat all of these? It's just one meal. One meal? You were eating from New York to Tokyo. All of those are free. Your stomach is going to hurt. I, Tang Ren, might be a headache for others, but my stomach never hurts! You're such a jinx. I need to hit the loo. Something's not right. Yeah, my stomach doesn't feel right. Something's wrong with Noda Hiroshi. Yeah, why is he alone? Don't we deserve a welcoming team of hundreds of people? Hi. Let's go! I need to use the restroom. No time for that. Where are you rushing into? Your afterlife? What's wrong? The man at 9 o'clock. His newspaper is from 3 days ago. The cleaner at 10 o'clock, that uniform doesn't fit him. Those two men at 2 o'clock who seem to be waiting for someone, but their eyes are on us all the time. Vietnamese, Southeast Asia United Army, What do they want? Go. Kid... kidnap? Wait... I thought Japan was a lawful society? What do we do now? Is Tokyo this dangerous? Welcome to Tokyo! Please. Such a grand opening! So it is for Watanabe Masaru's case? Otherwise we wouldn't have you here. Leave the case alone, answer my three questions first! Why do they want to kidnap us? Where is your limousine? And is it equipped with a toilet? My limousine is here. Wait. What? I sensed hostility around us. Where? Over... over there. He's leering. Does he fancy us? He's the No.1 detective in Thailand. Am I not the No.1 detective in Thailand? He's a retired policeman. Three years' Muay Thai champion. He's known for his relentless and invincible ""Rabid Dog"" style. Jack Jaa, the Mad Detective. Thai Boxing Champion? If it weren't for my stomach's sake, that dude, I'd beat him up every time I meet him. He's coming this way. Why do you know him so well? You haven't been on Crimaster, have you? This guy is surging in the chart. He's already made it into the top 10. Don't be scared. Backup team! It looks so painful. Tang, we're counting on you. So what is this case about? You had such a big scene here. These people will tell you. That is the suspect, Watanabe Masaru. He's also our client. He's the sixth-generation leader of Black Dragon, the most powerful mafia in Japan. The victim, Su Chaiwit. President of the Southeast Asia Chamber of Commerce. The sponsor behind gangs like the Vietnam Gang and the Greater Malay Gang. They had been fighting over the development rights of the new Chinatown in downtown Tokyo. After several rounds of fights, it eventually developed into violent confrontations. The night of the incident, Watanabe Masaru and Su Chaiwit were having the last round of negotiations. Su Chaiwit was then attacked and he died on the way to the hospital. How do you know all of this already? Q. Q The Queen? Three hours after we got the invitation from Noda Hiroshi, Q released the information of this 'Ironclad' case on Crimaster. Ironclad case? A case that is almost concluded, with no disputes. All the evidence points to Watanabe Masaru as the murderer. Then why are we here? To find a crack in the iron? You guys are the only variate. And that's why they tried to stop us from seeing Watanabe Masaru. Who will be the judge? Everyone. He's persistent. Get in the car. They are stealing our cars. Give it back! Give it back! Get rid of him! He is chasing so tight! Is he your ex-boyfriend? Let's see for how long he can last! Tokyo, here we come! This won't work. I can't stand this rabid dog any more. You guys go first! How ""ironclad"" is this case? The only person found at the crime scene was the victim. There is no entrance or exit for the suspect to assess the room. It is a perfect locked-room. So it has to be a homicide, right? Qin, we all know it's an ironclad case and it's risky to work with the gangsters. Let's switch to a different case. A different case? The rapist-murderer. I hate them the most. No... no... way I'm going to meet Watanabe Masaru and I'm going to see that locked-room. Locked-room? What is it with you and locked rooms? Locked rooms are the ultimate challenge of detective reasoning. The Three Coffins. The Judas Window. Your window. Here... here we are. No can do. I don't have room for more soup. Soup in Japan means bathhouse. Bathhouse? The legal ones? You've been to the illegal ones? Are we really going in there? Are you scared? You're scared! Then why are you sweating so much? Because of Tokyo Hot. Mr.Qin and Mr.Tang? Yes, we are. Welcome. Beautiful tattoos drawn on their bodies, a round of applause to the gangsta buddies! Stop! They don't speak Chinese. A group of old farts, is this a nursing home for tattooed seniors? The aging of gangsters is a serious issue in Japan. Younger generations no longer want to join the gang. Watanabe Masaru. Oh no! He has needle wrinkles between his eyes and dented brows on the sides. His hostile eyes surrounded with a turbid vibe. And he has a thin lip and small ears on his darkened face. He's definitely murderer material! Moron. This is a face mask. You speak Chinese? I only know one sentence. That's two already. Take it off. Stuff it in. Where? This is a simultaneous interpreting device. You two may come down now. You guys can back off now. You think these two wimps are capable of doing me harm? Noda Hiroshi said you two are genius detectives. We're just a tad more awesome than he is. There's only one week before the trial, we don't have much time. Now you can ask me three questions. How much you gonna pay us? One billion yen. How much is that in RMB? 70 million yuan. One last question. When can you pay? What... what happened that night? We were about to seal the deal on the new Chinatown area estate. But Su Chaiwit asked me to have one final talk with him. The meeting took place in the Watery Hall. The Watery Hall is surrounded by water. There's only one corridor that leads to the hall which makes it hard to ambush, so it's very safe. It's been the favorite meeting location of the gangs in the east. Due to previous conflicts between us, that day, Su Chaiwit came with a large entourage including his secretary, Kobayashi Anna. Please have some tea. Please have some tea. We started the negotiation after some tea. The tea was the problem. It tasted awful? I started to feel dizzy after I drank it. And then? That's all. When I woke up, they were rushing into the room. I saw my hand bleeding, and Su Chaiwit had been stabbed. All of you were there that night? Tell me what you saw. Just as what the President said, after we arrived at the Watery Hall, President and Su Chaiwit went into the room and we waited outside. 15 minutes later, we heard... we heard a crackling sound. That means you didn't go into the room immediately after the noise? No. If we had gone inside sooner, things would have turned out differently. It's all my fault! I'll cut a finger for it!! That can wait! Answer my questions first. How long did you wait before going into the room? Around one or two minutes. And why did you decide to go in? Because... because... because they heard Su Chaiwit's call for help. He's right. What are you doing! President! President! President! So there's only two of them in the room. Yes. The first person who went in was Su Chaiwit's secretary. Yes, it was all my fault for letting her get ahead of me. I'm cutting a finger for my fault! Answer my questions before you do it! Not a single one of you went to the hospital with Su Chaiwit? All of our attention was on our President. I'm cutting my finger! I captured two clips from the CCTV. One is of them taking Su Chaiwit out of the Watery Hall. The other one shows the arrival at the hospital. He died before they wheeled him into the emergency room. Enough. Now that you're clear on what happened that night. The question is, will you take this case or not? Of course yes! One billon yen, not one cent less! Good. I'm entrusting you with the honor and future of our gang and of myself. Within one week, you have to solve the case. Otherwise, I won't let you off. Neither will they. So, yes or no? Yes! Or not? This is a locked-room case. There's Judas Window. Exactly. Japan, locked-room, the lattice reasoning and mafia. Such a variety of elements, even a detective novel can't cover all of these. Yes. Yes! My assistant said yes, so we'll take it! Deal. Last question. You used up all three questions. Let's go. Wait. You get one free. Did you kill him? What the hell are you telling about? I wouldn't have you here if I killed him. I would just ask for him. What do you mean? Are you insulting me? I beg your pardon? I'm telling you if it weren't for your safety, I would have given him a taste of my Mo Boxing routine. This is the last CCTV camera. Such a natural enclosed space. And that's what makes it suspicious. Come on! Let's go and have a look. If the case can't be solved by two of us working as a team. Then it can't be the work of a human being. Get a room. You guys are so close to kissing each other. Let's go. Words are but wind, but seeing is believing. What the? What? Where is the crime scene? This is the crime scene. Where is the shattered screen, the blood trail and the finger prints? Right! Where is the shattered screen, the blood trail and the finger prints? They cleaned it up after the police collected the evidence. You Japanese people are crazy about cleaning. There is nothing left. What are we doing here? Seeing the photos at the crime scene will give us more inspiration, right? Any other information that I didn't see? I need to keep up with you. Time for another contest? Tell me what you found. The blood splatter indicates a severed abdominal artery. The amount of bleeding exceeds 300cc according to my visual inspection. The nearest hospital is 25 minutes' drive away. So death from hemorrhagic shock is plausible. A completely locked room. excludes the possibility of a third person entering and leaving the room. Now let's discuss these two cups of tea that I can't see. Both of them contain a high quantity of GHB. The only suspect is the waitress of the night, Yoshimoto Yuki. She was found dead the next morning having hung herself in her apartment. Silenced. How about Su Chaiwit's body? Residue of GHB found. How about Watanabe Masaru? This drug won't stay in the human body for longer than 6 hours. It was already too late when they considered checking him. So he might have lied. He might have never taken the tea. The dead tell a more honest story than the living. According to the theory of Ockham's Razor, simple reasoning shouldn't be complicated unnecessarily. You want to believe the dead or the living? Of course the dead unless he killed himself. There's only one doubt. What? There's splintered glass beneath him where Su Chaiwit fell down, which indicates he passed out after the glass screen was shattered. But there was no broken glass beneath Watanabe Masaru, that means he crashed before the glass screen got smashed. He didn't push the screen down? How did that happen? Was there really a third person? That would be the most reasonable explanation. But in this particular space, the presence of a third person is impossible. Are we having a supernatural talk? So that's why you believe Watanabe Masaru? And his motive for murder. The development rights for that area were already in his pocket. What would be his reason to kill? Stop wringing your brain. What the mortals can't figure out should be handed to the gods. The Dowsing Rod gives worldly affairs clarity. The deity will be the judge when it merges with me. Go! I got it! The killer had been hiding under the table. How could a man hide in there? They were not blind. Don't you forget they have a very special profession in Japan called Ninja. The killer must be a ninja. He slipped the poison in then hid under the table. After those two passed out, he smashed the glass screen and stabbed Su Chaiwit. Then he planted it on Watanabe Masaru. Before everyone else entered the room, he hid himself. My inference is flawless, you should call me a genius! Maybe the Dowsing Rod wasn't pointing to the table, but this. One detail in the photo struck me as rather curious. This brass ornament fell right next to Watanabe Masaru's hand. Before he fainted, he must have touched it. Watanabe Masaru. There are metallic scratches on the oxide layer of the brass piece. The handling and scratches point to one possibility only. It's a hitting weapon. If I'm correct with my inference, there should be a blow wound on the left side of Su Chaiwit's head. That means Watanabe Masaru lied. He did try to kill him. If we give this evidence to the police, he will be convicted. It took a lot of effort to get his medical parole, this new evidence will send him back under arrest. Give me that! Don't you dare forget who is our boss? The truth is my boss! Truth, truth! One billion yen, man! You're not the richest man, one billion doesn't just happen like that. No matter how much money he offers us, a murderer stays a murderer. A, a, a... Amazing boobs. Send you off from our little town, there's a few things that I want to remind you. You hit me? Your sympathetic nerves get excited resulting in a sudden rush of adrenaline and catecholamine. Causing the capillaries of certain organs to grow rapidly. Grow rapidly...certain organs... Your skin! You're blushing! Did you guys hear the music just now? It's an old song. Moron! This is Kobayashi Anna, senior assistant to Mr. Su. You already speak Chinese, you don't need this. Miss Kobayashi, please put this on, it's very handy. Now our communication has no boundaries. I'm... I know who you are. Really? Am I that famous? Even in Japan? Today, I have the monks pray for the soul of my master Su Chaiwit. Over the years I regarded him as my father. My condolences, Miss Kobayashi. But if you wanna cry, cry on my shoulders. They are yours now. Allow me to do something for our father. To help us lock on the culprit as soon as possible, To help us lock on the culprit as soon as possible, do you mind if I ask about what happened that night? Is that even necessary? It's Watanabe Masaru who did it! You look very certain. There was nobody else in the room that night. I was the first to run inside after I heard the noise. President! Shut up! Save him first! Mr. Su Chaiwit. Mr. Su Chaiwit. Take him to the hospital, right now! And Mr. President told me before he died, it was Watanabe Masaru who stabbed him. Hang in there, Mr. Su Chaiwit. Masaru Watanabe Avenge me. Mr. Su Chaiwit Mr. Su Chaiwit Mr. Tang, you're the No.1 detective from Chinatown. Are you going to help this scum walk free from this felony? Do you know what he did to me that night? He did an abomination other than killing a man? That night... Such a beautiful secretary. How much does Mr. Su pay you? Come work for me, I'll double the paycheck. Kobayashi, it seems like Mr. Watanabe really likes you. Leave us for now. Bastard. He's worse then a beast! Yet you're helping him. You don't see anything but money, do you? Who told you I do it for the money? I was only pretending to accept his bribe, so that I could infiltrate the enemy. And after all the humiliation I went through, I just found evidence overlooked by the police. What is this? We've checked that Watanabe Masaru must have attacked Su Chaiwit with this. If we can find the wound on Su Chaiwit's head, then Watanabe's intention to kill will be confirmed. Jack Jaa! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Such important evidence should be handled by the police. Tanaka Naoki, the youngest Senior Superintendent in Japan's history. He has maintained a 100% case clear-up rate. People call him the police prodigy. Sorry. Thank you for getting this new evidence for me. Watanabe will not get away this time. Thai detective. Japanese detective. Chinese detective. Impressive. Yet Crimaster is only for kids who fancy detective novels and movies. I'm the law here. And let me remind you, don't ever show up where you shouldn't be, or I will arrest you. Is that clear? Let's go. You're absolutely about to fail, but you still stand by the Japanese? What do you mean? Watanabe would not be easy on you guys if he know the new evidence was handed to the police. But if you guys work with us, I will make sure you can go back to China alive. Are you going to betray us? It's not like we are going to lose. So pick one side! It's me who bought your flights. Can I choose both? No need! If we lose, so be it. Fine! I'll see... ...how Watanabe is going to kill you guys. Remember my heart, remember my love for you. Remember I'll be waiting for you every single day. The old song is on again? So you heard that too? Moron. What do we do now? Will Watanabe flip on us? From what I know, he will. You got two options: either hit the road now or solve the case soon. What the living doesn't tell us, let's consult the dead. This time, please don't put me in the nurse costume again. Dressing up like a woman really messed with my hormones. You play the corpse this time. Why aren't you playing the corpse? Do you know how to conduct an autopsy? Reiko, you scared me. How do you work here with such timidity? Movies are all fiction, zombies don't exist at all. Some of them might come pay you a visit tonight. Great. Life is so boring now. We're here. You are? Delivery. So ugly. Have you ever seen any attractive dead body? The elevator's acting weird recently, just be careful. Okay. I almost died from suffocation. Is the new autopsy report out? Here, Officer Tanaka. Exactly as I predicted. There is a wound on the left back side of Su Chaiwit's head. Now we can request the arrest warrant again. Yes, sir. Anything unusual? No, sir. Show me the morgue. Yes, sir. This way please. What do I do now? Are you trying to kill me? But I'm your uncle, by blood! You gonna kill me? I'm your biological uncle! Let's find Su Chaiwit's body. I want to check by myself. Got it! Let's check somewhere else. Got it! Why is the President lighter? Of couse corpse becomes lighter. You idiot! What are you doing? What is that! Find the body and burn it, so there's no evidence for the Southeast Chamber. Mr. President would be very touched by us. Mr. President would be very touched by us. Be brave when we get into the morgue, there is nothing to be scared of. Roger. Please. After you. You go first. No, you go first. Please. Not this one. Here it is. This one. Great. Why is Su Chaiwit so light? Dead bodies are always lighter. Dumbass. Please. Please. Please. Come in please. Where is Tang Ren? Don't mind him, Su Chaiwit is our priority. Why is it going up? Two cowards. What again? Be careful. You! You! You! You guys! What's that? Get them! Quickly! Get them! The mild edema on the left back side of the skull was caused by a blow to the head. Vital reaction not obvious which means the wound was created not long before his death. Radius of the wound is 3.5cm, which matches the size of the brass ornament. The lethal injury was done with a cone-shaped object. The uneven surface matches the glass object left by Watanabe at the crime scene. Autopsy report shows that the glass pieces left inside the victim's body are identical to the shattered screen. It looks like Watanabe is the murderer. Only one thing left. There are two ways of handling the weapon when stabbing someone: holding it with the palm, or the hypothenar muscles of the hand. Watanabe Masaru is 1.75 meters, whereas Su Chaiwit is 1.8 meters. If he struck from the front using the palm, then the wound should be on the left side of the underbelly. But the injury is on his right side, so he must have been holding the blade against the hypothenar muscles and stabbed from the back. The way Watanabe handled the weapon is the key now. Kobayashi, who ran into the room first must have witnessed it. Have you noticed the pinhole in his vein? Yes. His medical report doesn't mention recent injections though. Well, there's only one person who can answer all these questions. Kobayashi Anna. Last night, Watanabe Masaru, the head of the biggest mafia in the East, Black Dragon, was arrested again. Okay, I see. The Black Dragon has issued an order to hunt you guys down. This is getting messy. Are you aware of the trouble you get us in? Say one more word and I will kill myself. And you will lose your uncle forever! Aren't you from the extended family? If we want to leave Japan safely, we need to crack the case. Miss Kobayashi lives in such a cute apartment. Would you like her to be your aunt? If she's willing to take Chinese citizenship, I might consider marrying her. Miss Kobayashi, I'm coming. Why is the door unlocked? Miss Kobayashi, are you taking a shower? I'm coming in. Miss Kobayashi. Don't bother. Kobayashi has been kidnapped. What? That's right. She's been gassed unconscious then dragged out. What's going to happen to my Kobayashi? You again? Are you trying to sabotage our investigation by hiding Miss Kobayashi? It must be this Japanese. He kidnapped Kobayashi for Watanabe! We will never do this despicable shits. So it's you. Are you insane? It must be Watanabe! He wants to silence the witness. It's definitely not him, the police arrested him last night. Cut the crap. Give my Kobayashi back! Get your dirty paws off me, you haven't showered for days. How do you know that? You call yourself a man looking like this? What's wrong with being handsome? You should take care of your skin. Sissy, you never understand a man should look like this. Not you! You crazy! How dare you two brag about masculinity in front of me? Alright, stop fighting! The pinhole on Su Chaiwit and the way Watanabe held the weapon, only Kobayashi owns the key to the truth. And the key to my heart. To know the truth, we must find Kobayashi Anna first. Now, we share the same goal. That gives us zero information. Car plate. Call the police. Tanaka will have us arrested. I'll beat you up if you snatch the phone! And I don't practice Mo Boxing for nothing. Stop it. I found the car owner. A man wanted by the police, Murata Akira. Murata Akira. Rapist-murderer. That serial rapist-murderer. What? Rapist-murderer? My Kobayashi... No... I've located his den. It can't be that simple. Let's save the hostage first. Go! This indeed looks like the den of a pervert. Kobayashi's safety is our top priority. Keep the twaddle to yourself. Watch out, folks. Better hide behind my back, you guys. Easy, easy. Qin, help me! 3 poor people, 2 loaves of bread, show fairness and justice with 1 cut. 3 poor people, 2 loaves of bread, show fairness and justice with 1 cut. 3 poor people, 2 loaves of bread, show fairness and justice with 1 cut. Easy! Wrong answer. 2 chance left. The world doesn't suffer from scarcity but from inequality. Wrong answer. 1 chance left. Let me do it. Qin, you killed the man. Correct. Justice and equality demand sacrifices. Game starts. See Kobayashi after 3 passes. You understand it? I only curse because I don't understand it. What does it mean? The game has just begun. Games? This is turning into a game now? Aren't we here on a rescue mission? Shut up. Tomorrow, 10 am, if you want to save Kobayashi, each of you must bring 100 million yen to the Cosplay Carnival at Akihabara. She will be killed if you call the police. Three detectives? He didn't count you in? Or you? His motive is money? His motive can't be this simple. Now that we don't have other clues, we can only follow his order. How about the money? Who can get three hundred million yen within one night? This late? Banks are closed now. Don't you own Tokyo? Total bullshit! I can say Japan belongs to me. Sawatdee krab. You will know! There's a spot. This group. Faster! Faster! Faster! You go that way! Master, we have summoned thousands of our employees to withdraw cash. But it's still not enough. Then get more people on it. It's already 12 o'clock, ask all of them to withdraw again. Roger. I didn't find you too handsome until today. Shameless! Need a bodyguard? You guys are all wet. Let me take you to get changed. So handsome! I can't take it anymore. Sorry. You can go in. Back up! Shit! We can't get in the carnival without costumes. This way. Which one should I pick? It's so hard to choose with so many options. You've been waiting for this day, haven't you? It all looks so sissy. How would I wear it? You will look good in this. I swear on my grandfather's name. These are all Japanese characters. These are quintessential to our culture, do you have any? Qin, we have to strive for the honor of our country. What exactly are we looking for? We're looking for Kobayashi. And how do we do that without a single hint? No hint? The hint is in front of you. What is it? A puzzle. Think about the people you pass by... One chance only. Can we get out of these costumes first? This is too... Who is calling? The phone is from inside. He's asked us to fill in three numbers before he hangs up. The numbers we've seen. Who's had number on them before? The last one? Stop that! I don't know! I do! D 36D Isn't it obvious? He's asked us to get to the temple in Harajuku. My instruction is to go to Ebisu. I'm heading to Budokan. How can we make it? We have to make it. Qin, wait for me. How do we get there? We might have a chance if we go underground. Underground? I can't breath. Can't breath. You want to save Miss Kobayashi or not? Miss Kobayashi! Here! Help! Stop, you bastard! Stop there! Give my girl back! What is Noda Hiroshi doing there? He's not moving at all. He's moving! And he's moving so fast. Is he flying? I'm the king of Tokyo! Cheating. You lose! What? Look! Noda's red dot disappeared. Did he crash? Leave him alone! Just run! Stop there! Stop! Come back! This one is it! This is your choice. You take care of it. But I chose the thin white leg. It is pretty white, just a bit thick. You don't want to save Miss Kobayashi? I do. But I don't want to die either. Death befalls all men alike. It may be weightier than Mount Tai, or lighter than a feather. He is Mount Tai no doubt. And I am a feather for sure. Tang! Remember that old song? Wild flowers on the road... Not this one. You're right. The Great Wall will never fall. I will beat you at any cost! Call the ambulance, please! Tang! Tang! Any last words? Tell me. Qin, please take good care of Miss Kobayashi, Ah Xiang in Thailand, and Ying Ying in America. How can I take care of so many aunts? I'm your uncle! By blood! Extended. The blood is real! Enough. Drop the act. I found his weakness. You wanna beat him? You're not kidding? When you guys were fighting, I noticed that the callous on his right foot is thicker than the left. It's resulted from years of putting his weight on the right leg, so his left foot must suffer from a prolonged injury. Besides, the skin tone of his left ankle is much lighter than the rest of his body due to bandaging. So his weakness is his left ankle. To topple a mansion, aim at the frailest beam. Got it! Nezha explores the sea. Dividing the wild horse's mane. Immortal points direction. Monkey steals peach. White python screws. Mountain Tai on top. Stop it! Qin, did you learn all these tricks from action films? Jack Jaa is out. Congratulations on passing this test. How much longer do you want to play? The ultimate test is in 10 minutes, Shibuya, Hachi Ko. What is the ultimate test? What do you see? People. A lot of people. That's right. This is the busiest crossroad in the world. I would like to know how many people pass the crossway when the traffic lights' up. So? So Xiao Feng, let's do what we always do: help daddy count how many people are there. Who are you? Who on earth are you? Do you want to know who I am or where Kobayashi is? This is your ultimate challenge. Start. What did he ask us to do? Count people! Quickly, lend me your shoulders. Count people? Such a sick request. Steady. We need to stay still like this? Yes. Lucky that I've been training since I was little. First attempt failed. You get two more chances. Keep going. It's about to start again. Wrong! This is human nature. Regulations can never control human nature. Qin Feng, you have one last chance. Get ready to collect the corpse. This sick bastard is not coming for money, he just wants to torture us. Let's go! Qin! What are you doing? There is all real money! Trust me if you want to save Kobayashi. Join me! The answer is zero. Are we wrong again? No, we got it right this time. Who am I? Who am I? Where am I? What journey did I put you through? Another puzzle. Miss Kobayashi, where are you? Zero or O? Did you count the distance we've traveled since we left from Noda's house? Q. Q The Queen? All of this is related to the Queen? Qin, let's go, hurry up. Noda, help me find Tokyo locations with Q in their names. Kobayashi is in that place. Wait a second. In Tokyo, there is only one place that has Q in its name. The Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel. Dragon Q Palace. Why are you holding my hand? Qin, don't be scared. I'm not scared. I'm afraid that you might be scared. I'm not scared, you are. I'm afraid that you get scared. That's what I'm afraid of. Enough with the afraid stuff and let go of me. You're grossing me out with your sweaty hand. Help! Help! Help! Help! Miss Kobayashi. Tang Ren! Save me! I'm coming! Tang Ren! Save me! Who are you? And why do you know me? What exactly do you want? Easy with your questions. First of all, there's one last choice to make. What choice? Tang Ren! Save me! I'm here! Miss Kobayashi. Help! Qin! Tang! Tang! Qin! Qin! Miss Kobayashi. This is your choice to make. The valve of the well is wired to my heart pacemaker. The water won't stop until I die. To save Kobayashi, you will have to kill me. Maniac! Why would I kill you? I'm a death-row convict. It's time for you to execute justice. I don't have the right to perform justice! No? You are qualified to do so. It's much easier than committing a perfect crime, isn't it? Stop hesitating, Qin Feng. Just a gentle push, you can save the innocent woman down there. And I am a condemned sinner who's supposed to die anyway. Now you have two lives in your hand. Qin Feng, don't you feel like God? Qin! Qin! Don't hesitate, Qin Feng! Make your choice! Qin! Feeling so quiet This time Drift Into the darkness Let me be endless Goodbye End of my old life No one is luckless When comes the fairness Through the dark a world is waiting Through where no one's ever looking A place that will be called my own So trade that typical for something New and colorful like you say Everything will not be the same Qin Feng, you are under arrest and charged with murder. Qin, Qin. He said he didn't kill anyone. Why are you arresting him? You wouldn't have saved Kobayashi without him. Everyone saw him pushing the victim down! Killing is not saving. Social butterfly! Do something! Think of something! Sorry, there's nothing I can do. How come there's nothing you can do? Aren't you the king of Tokyo? Don't forget that he's here for you. He came here for the case. Whereas you came for the money. I already told you. Never help the Japanese. Please help him then. Help Qin! But you never listen to me. You double-crossing bastards. You think I can't get things done without you? Without you, I'll save Qin by myself! What's with the pinhole on Su Chaiwit's arm? I don't know. Your mind is still on cracking the case? You must remember how Watanabe Masaru was holding the weapon when you saw him. Was it like this, or this? Like this, I think. Okay. I see. Let's go. By the way, your Chinese is good. Qin, I'm gonna get you out. How did it go? Parole denied due to the gravity of the case. Aren't you rich? Just buy out the procuratorate. It's not up to me. Kawamura Yoshiko is the prosecutor. If she thinks Qin Feng is fine, then he will be fine. Excellent! Everyone knows that I'm popular among middle-aged women. Time for me to sacrifice my body in exchange for Qin. Come on! Introduce me! Why are you stopping me? Calm down. How can I calm down? You should go back to Bangkok and lie low. The Black Dragon is after you now. You're not safe here in Japan. I can't just leave Qin here. But you can't help much here. What's this? A boat ticket. You will get caught if you take the plane. Boat? What about your private jets? There aren't that many of them. And they're preoccupied with other tasks. A car has been arranged for you to leave now. Where is the car? Here! Where's the boat? There are so many of them. I mean the boat that is supposed to take me back to Thailand. The luxury liner! That one. Noda Hiroshi you piece of shit! This shitty boat doesn't even require a ticket. Welcome. This way. Follow me. Follow me. No more hesitation, Qin Feng! Make you choice! Qin! Q says hi. Are we admitting defeat? Even so, we still have to find out the truth, don't we? Locked rooms, the ultimate subject that every detective authors wants to explore. As one of the Three Tycoons of the Golden Era, John Dickson Carr, in his work The Lecture of Locked Rooms. divides the locked-room cases into 13 categories. This means our case must fall into one of them. Category one, it's not really a murder but the unfortunate outcome of a series of uncanny coincidences. Category two, the room is equipped with a secret device that kills. Category three, the murderer uses animals or plants to kill. Category four and Category five, people enter the locked-room while the murderer hides behind the door. Category eight and Category nine, the murderer stabs the victim somewhere outside the room. In order to hide from the murderer's chase, Our case is narrowed down to three possibilities. One, the Sham Cham. The murderer operates in a seemingly enclosed chamber which actually has a secret passage for an escape. The locked-room doesn't have any air vent, secret tunnel or trapdoor. Besides, the place was surrounded by gangs so nobody could enter or exit the room. Two, Room With a Device. The murderer stays in the room and launches an attack with a remote-controlled device. There was no trace of any device at the crime scene, and within a sealed space it would be impossible to operation one. Device nonexistent. Category two ruled out. Three, the Hidden Killer. Like Tang Ren's case in Thailand, the murderer didn't leave the scene after the crime but stashed himself in the room and waited till the alert was lifted. In our scene there, was no furniture for hiding. No place to hide. Category three ruled out. With all the possibilities excluded, Watanabe has to be the culprit. But there is still no explanation for the lack of broken glass beneath his body. If the screen was smashed after Watanabe was down, then it's the real murderer who did this. Only Watanabe Masaru and Su Chaiwit were in the room. Su Chaiwit couldn't have stabbed himself. Is there a 14th category? Wait. What did you say? That Su Chaiwit couldn't have stabbed himself. You. Such a time of mistrust. The detective who decodes locked-rooms is now trapped in one. Isn't that ironic, Qin Feng? Murata Akira was just a puppet. You're the one pulling the strings. We finally meet, Q. Q Why do you say so? Before we came to Japan, everything seemed to be manipulated by a pair of invisible hands. Three hours after we received Noda's invitation, Q posted the case on Crimaster. It can't be a coincidence. It was Q's plan all along. Including putting me in jail. But this is not the purpose, I knew he would come to see me. Hence, whoever shows up first should be Q. Q We were right about you. You guys? Of course, Q is not one individual. He is the best of the best, the elite selected from millions of people. Congratulations on passing the test, on becoming one of us. Test? First round, recognition. Second round, capability. Third round, methods. Last round, epiphany. The answer is zero. If these are all tests, what about the case of Watanabe? A coincidence that we borrowed to conduct our test on you. Including framing me? This is not framing you, but showing you the human chaos. And the vacuity of law. To enlighten me on your philosophy, you killed a guy. Murata Akira? His life was worthless. A Wanted Order was the only evidence of his existence. In his last moment, I granted a shred of meaning to his life. He would be grateful. So, Q, Q what exactly do you want? Human history is never written by the witless crowd. It's always been the elites who control the progress of civilizations. In the ancient past, they were deemed as gods. The world was a land of bliss governed by the deities. In order to let the world get back on track, humans need new gods. Do you understand? That's when Q emerged. Qin Feng, you've been pursuing the perfect crime without knowing that perfect crimes are taking place every moment. Those old aristocrats and modern plutocrats, all bear the orginal sin. Yet they all end up being worshipped and revered. Do you understand? That, is the perfect crime. Qin Feng, join Q. In putting the world on trial. Compared to Q's power, you will never beat us. You have your people, I have mine too. You? Us. My baby apprentice. No time for weeping. Kiko wants you to meet someone. Who? Like you? I didn't know you could drive. Buckle up. We're in a hurry. I have seen it all, your shabby little car doesn't faze me. Go inside. The one is inside waiting for you. Uncle. You guys? Who? Tang Ren who fled back to Thailand? Noda Hiroshi who can't be trusted? Or the puffed-chest and brainless Jack Jaa? Qin Feng, all you have is us, not you. Don't hesitate and don't waste your gift. A murderer can be sentenced to death in Japan. So Qin Feng didn't kill the guy. Of course not. Such a pity. What pity? I always believed he had the talent to kill. Does killing require talent? Anything in the world we call art demands talent. So genius, help Qin. Lord, please pardon his sins, save his soul, let him walk away from the dark and into the light. In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen. Sister, it's a good thing you're saving his soul. But I want you to save his ass. What are you doing? You want to kill me? Look at you. Stop pretending to be Qin. What if I decide to join you guys? I got a convict to offer his life to me, surely I can get another convict to walk away as a free man. Join us, you will get out of here in a second. Otherwise, you will never crack the locked-room that you put yourself in. The room that we can never leave. The room you made on our own... So make a choice. I refuse. I'm sorry you said that, Qin Feng The chosen one who is not a friend, will be an enemy. I feel sorry too. I didn't know that Q was not a person. The sixth test. Ready. Go. The sixth test. An extra kilo on the thrust. Acceleration of gravity is 9.978. Landing time 2.54 seconds. The dummy is 1.77 meters tall and weighs 66 kilos which is identical to the victim, Murata Akira. Okay. Now get ready for the seventh test. Okay, no need to continue. I would like to know what on earth you are trying to show me. The Siege Experiment. You didn't know it? We do this experiment to show you that there is a difference between choosing to jump, and being pushed off the edge. You see this is where he landed. If he had been pushed, it would be a totally different landing spot. However, this experiment hardly proves Qin Feng's innocence. What's the reason behind Murata's suicide? The reason is here. Although Murata Akira was a lost soul living in utter isolation, I discovered his tenuous connection to the world. His only family is a daughter out of wedlock in Vietnam. Three days before Murata Akira escaped from jail, his daughter's bank account received over one million dollars. And one day before his death, another million dollars came in. Evidence enough to prove that Murata Akira had made a deal with someone to frame Qin Feng for his own death. Do you have other evidence that shows a direct correlation? Looks like you need my help here. You ungrateful bastard. Hold that for now. Aunt Kawamura. What? I made an exception to come here because your mother and I are friends. Now what else? Speak up. Thank you so much for coming. In order to track down the suspect, I had the 300 million yen sprinkled with tracking powder which can only be detected by ultraviolet radiators and fluorescent lamps. If Qin Feng touched Murata that day, he would have gotten tracking powder all over himself. But he was completely clean. So Qin Feng didn't even touch him. You had it all planned out? You scheming shrewd bastard. I believe Qin Feng and I tick in sync. We both know that the abduction of Kobayashi Anna couldn't be that simple. The mastermind behind it can only be Q. The Queen? We had to keep you in the dark to get him on the hook. It's called the ruse of self-injury. Exactly. Noda contacted us the night Qin Feng was arrested. He might be kind of a dandy, but he's trustworthy. So what do you think, aunt Kawamura? Don't try to dazzle me with your charm. I'm in my fifties and I have had my share of men. Release him. So Qin is all good now? The special thing between Qin Feng and I is that we often draw a similar analysis out of the a situation at the same time. So we both know our mission this time. I track down Q and you save Qin Feng. And Qin Feng will focus on solving the locked-room case. Now he should have reached the bottom of it. You have such confidence in him? Just like believing in myself. Qin! Hos before bros, ha? Where is Tanaka Naoki? He's a step ahead of us. The trial will start at 1 pm. How is your preparation going? Missing the last part. Where is the car that drove Su Chaiwit to the hospital? Because of the severity of the case, the car has been confiscated in the evidence department since the night Su Chaiwit died. We will go there now. Time is pressing, I'm afraid that it might delay the trial. Let's split then. Tang and I will go retrieve the evidence while you and Kiko go to the court to prepare for the defense. Sure, I'll leave my car with you. There's only two hours left, don't be late. Su Chaiwit's murder case will have its court hearing at 1 pm today. The court is swarmed with Japanese Southeast Asian vehemently demanding the punishment be inflicted on the perpetrator. According to the analysis of experts in law enforcement, it's highly likely that Watanabe Masaru will be found guilty of murder. Are you sure it's in the car? I don't know but we have to bet on it. What if it's not there? Then we lose. Tang! Are you alright? I'm still breathing. Qin! Don't move! My leg! I can't make it. You have to take the evidence to the court! How is that gonna work? Stop stalling! Just go! Run! Five of us as PUBG Ling Tong are here. We will end your swagger! Nice to see you again, Qin Feng. How can you start a fight without us? Winner Winner Peace Keeper! And don't forget about our Lu Jingjing! Don't flinch! March! Koji, you guys didn't come for a fight! Take me to court now! We can't wait any longer. Alright. Are you ready to start? The documents are here. Okay. July 24th, 2019 Leaders of the Black Dragon Joint-Stock Company and the Southeast Chamber of Commerce, defendant Watanabe Masaru and victim Su Chaiwit, held a private negotiation in the Watery Hall. Su Chaiwit was stabbed in the upper stomach, on the right, with a broken piece of screen. He died from severe blood loss after being hospitalized. Jam it in. Do... don't... don't be mad. Calm down. I'm trying to save your boss. I'm working on that. Revenge for the boss! Revenge! In conclusion, the prosecutor believes that Watanabe Masaru can be confirmed to be the murderer of Su Chaiwit. And death penalty is applicable due to the vicious manner with which the crime is committed. Defense attorney, would you like to add anything? Then, defendant Watanabe Masaru, do you have an argument to make? Alright. Then, I'd like to announce... Objection! Sorry, you can't come in. Objection overruled. Bailiff, take them out. Your honor, Mr. Qin Feng is the assistant to the defense attorney. He just gathered some new evidence for the case. Please let him present the closing argument. Yes... Now I'd like to hand the court to my assistant... Qin Feng! Yes, Qin Feng. Mr. Noda Hiroshi. Please stop blatantly sending unwholesome signals to me in the court. I think you got the wrong person. Mr. Qin Feng, you have ten minutes. I've placed the best translator for you. Now the stage is yours. The crime happened in the Watery Hall, a natural locked-room surrounded by water on all sides. There were only two people in the room when the crime took place, the victim and the defendant. Now one of them is dead while the other is sitting in the courtroom. The answer appears rather obvious. Watanabe Masaru is the murderer. But is that the truth? Do you really have to drink water at this point? The most questionable point in the case, which is also the inherently contradictory, is that everyone near the crime scene heard the sound of glass shattering as well as the yelling from Su Chaiwit. But photos of the crime scene show no glass debris in the spot where Watanabe Masaru passed out. This indicates that he fainted before the glass screen broke. So, how to explain the cry heard from outside? All of this was a show directed by and starring, Su Chaiwit. What? Bullshit! Stop! You want justice, yes? Yes! Yes? Yes! Bastard! Sorry! Get them! That night, Yoshimoto Yuki slipped Y-hydroxybutyrate in both cups, often called GHB. Su Chaiwit didn't drink the tea at first. We don't know the content of their conversation. But our defendant was so enraged by something Su Chaiwit said that he hit Su with a brass ornament from the table. Su pretended to be smacked down by the blow and dropped to the floor. But it wasn't until Watanabe Masaru passed out from the drug, that this case turned into a mind-blowing spectacle. Watanabe Masaru walked into the meeting room without wearing the dagger that he always had with him. Leaving Su Chaiwit no choice but to abandon his original plan. After Watanabe Masaru fell unconscious, Su Chaiwit smashed the glass screen. He stabbed himself before cutting Watanabe's hand. He took out a blood pouch he prepared beforehand, and created the scene of having been attacked. That's how he got the pinhole on his arm. What are you doing? It's a carefully thought out plan to plant the crime on Watanabe Masaru. What an amusing story. I could hardly stop myself from laughing. If that's the case, according to your hypothesis, what would be Su Chaiwit's motive? Once Watanabe is behind bars, the community of Southeast Asia will regain the development rights of the new Chinatown. Plus they can eradicate their arch-rival, the Black Dragon. One endeavor that yields multiple benefits. So he would risk losing his life just to frame Watanabe? Isn't it a bit too far-fetched? The Lecture of Locked Rooms divides all the locked-room cases into 13 categories. None of the 13 categories fit this specific case. And that's because the culprit created a new type of room, the 14th room: the victim is also the designer of the room. He left the scene with minimal injuries. It's at the second crime scene that he got stabbed. And the real murderer is you who were outside the room, Miss Kobayashi Anna. Are you out of your mind? The coroner's report shows that Su died from severe blood loss caused by a sharp glass object penetrating his liver. However, the lethal weapon wasn't the piece in Watanabe's hand, but a different one. I re-assembled the broken glasses and there's one piece missing. Because someone took this inconspicuous piece out of the room. And used it to stab Su Chaiwit in the car. This is a 3D simulation based on the glass fragments at the crime scene. Obviously one piece is missing. What about the evidence? Don't show us animation, show us the evidence. Don't give me a hypothesis, present the evidence. Everyone look closer. What's the difference between those two CCTV videos? It's obvious that Miss Kobayashi looks sexier in the hospital! But why? Because she's wearing less. What less? Forgive me, Miss Kobayashi. I know that you like me, but my integrity as a detective is telling me to place righteousness over private affection. Reasoning is about magnifying all the details. After I saw the differences of you, I couldn't help wondering: Miss Kobayashi, where did your handkerchief go between the crime scene and the hospital? Because you used the handkerchief to keep your hands from getting injured while you committed the murder. Objection! Objection! Objection to the groundless hypothesis of the defendant's attorney. He has a confused idea about the standing of Miss Kobayashi and himself. Miss Kobayashi is here today as a witness. This is the handkerchief, dagger and blood pouch that we just retrieved from Su Chaiwit's car. Watanabe's weaponless screwed up Su Chaiwit's plan and yours. As there were no pockets on your suit, you had to stash the weapon in Su Chaiwit's pocket to leave the crime scene. And because of that, after you committed the murder, you had to hide the real weapon temporarily in the car. The unexpected happened when the car got seized by the police the same night, which left you no time to get the key evidence back. Enough! Your honor, I plead guilty. Are you nuts? You didn't kill him. Why would you plead guilty? I did! You didn't! I did! You did not! I did! You did not! I did! No! Silence! Where do you two think you are, an open-air market? Defendant Watanabe Masaru, are you sure you're pleading guilty? Yes. I'm guilty. Such being the case. I announce... What's the motive? What? You said I killed Su Chaiwit. What's my motivation? What are you taking the courtroom for? Silence! Now the verdict. Objection! So now anyone can just interrupt me? I haven't announce anything yet. Objection again? Get him out now! Your honor, this is the detective from our side. He might have found new evidence. Please give him time to make an argument. One last time. There is limit to my patience. Thank you very much. Is there a translator for me? English works. You are such a jerk! But you're not the murderer. What? The motive of murder is right here. I continued to find evidence against Watanabe. All his files before his 38 are all blank. And I traced all the way back to the northeast of China. Do you want to get things done? Finish it! Han Jiang, China good. I found your birth certificate there. Also, I happened to find another person's info. Your father, Yan Sheng who was born in February 1946, in Suihua, China. Yan Sheng, was another Japanese War orphan and his parents were Japanese immigrants. Yan Sheng, got this place as the World War's over, and he was brought up by a local farmer. He later got married with a war orphan, and you were born afterward. All you did is to take revenge on him. Your biological father, Watanabe, right? What are you talking about? Where're you from? Shut up. Detective choose to follow the truth instead of side. You bring shame to your country, you hear me? Get out of here! How can you be so sure that I'm the girl based on a birth certificate? The mark on your arm. The BCG vaccine in Japan was conducted with nine-holed needles. The uneven mark on your arm just reads China. And the birthmark on you shoulder. Like this, maybe. Since I saw your birthmark I've been thinking. Watanabe wasn't taking advantage of you that night, but trying to make sure of something. Based on this clue, I tracked back to 1983, when your grandfather found your family and brought you three back to Japan. The first time you were in this country, you were not even three years old. You finish the rest, the story is much too... Yan Sheng, returned to Japan in 1983. Within two years, he married the only daughter of the Black Dragon's Oda Kazuo, Oda Kotoko. Then assumed his Japanese name, Watanabe Masaru. His first wife Lin Nai died in 1988 due to... Enough. Please stop. Why? Cause you don't want people to know what you did? We were so poor. We were looking forward to a new life in the beginning, but everything turned out to be unbearable. Language barriers, nobody cared about us, and no food. Even when my daughter got sick, I couldn't do anything. We could have perished like roadside garbage, and no one would even know. So you just disposed of us like garbage? It was a deal. I beg you! Father! Please lend me some money! Naeko's life depends on it. Your Japanese hasn't improved much. I will study harder. And I thought you could get things done all by yourself. By the way, what are your thoughts on that offer? Father, about that... I can't do it! I can't just leave Naeko and her mother! You loser! An inferior woman and her kid just stopped you! Do you know what this marriage will bring to the two families? If you want the money, you have to disconnect yourself from those two women and marry Kotoko. To save the kid's life or not, it's your call. Ridiculous. You're telling me you did everything for me? I'm not excusing myself. At that time, I was desperate. Do you know the life we lived afterwards? We didn't speak the language, with no identity, and we lost our only support when you left us. Mother had to steal and mug to make sure I'd survive. And I'll never forget that she gave herself to a tramp for a bowl of soba noodles. And for a slice of strawberry cake, she was caught and put in jail. And she died there. You think you saved my life? How many times I've wished I died from that disease at five. Do you know how I grew up? And what have I been through? Why did you bring me into the world if you can't take the responsibility? Ever since mama left me, I died with her. And it was from that day, I started telling myself that I need to seek revenge! That I will make you suffer from the loss of everything and the death in prison! Su Chaiwit was a jerk too! No one would regret both of your deaths! Due to the complexity of the case, I declare a re-hearing of the Watanabe homicide case be held after the evidence is re-organized. Court in recess. Please take suspect Miss Kobayashi. Naeko! So what exactly did Su Chaiwit tell Watanabe that night? Kobayashi grew up without a father, so she yearns for older men. All you have to do is curl your finger, and she will fling herself at you no matter what you do with her. It's the guilt that's been weighing on him over these years. Nobody can touch that, including himself. So he recognized Kobayashi as his daughter that night? I think so. But he didn't know that Kobayashi indeed came for him. You should be happy, man! Because the case is finally cracked. Let's find a Thai restaurant. What do you want? Thai food? Tom Yum Kung! Pad Thai! Let's go to a Chinese restaurant and drink some Chinese liquor. And some dumplings and hotpot. Now we are in Japan, shouldn't I invite you all for sushi and sake? Tom Yum Kung is spicy. We should have Japanese cuisine since we are in Japan. Chinese food have everything! You can have whatever you want. So beautiful. What date is today? Obon Festival. People in this way honor the spirits of their ancestors. May the deceased rest in peace hopefully. May people be free from suffering. World peace, harmony brings wealth! Why are you staring at me? Tang, I've known you for so long, and this is the most insightful thing you've ever said. Of course! Do you know where you're much better than these two? Where? You have me!

Not paper-folding this time? Ring is the token of affection. Why a bracelet? Mobius Strip! What does it mean? She wants to tell me that the good and the evil are not exactly antithetical, but intertwined. Sometimes, it's hard to distinguish between the good and the evil. Don't you think that the band resembles a character? Q! Q Qin Feng refused us. No one has ever refused us. He is either with or against us. It's his loss. Not ours. If not him, there will be others. To future. To future. Someone has said that despite the difference between individuals, the amount of good and evil remains constant. While some take shelter in the darkness, we choose the light. As we believe that the world exists because justice always prevails and light overcomes darkness. As long as vices exist, we won't hold back on declaring war on them!, - Mike! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - What the hell are you doing? - It's called driving, Marcus. Slow down! What? Four minutes? Speed up. Oh, so you want me to speed up and slow down at the same time? Moving southbound on Collins. - Fast approaching 22 Street. - Copy that. Air support has a visual. Mike! I'm about to throw up. Oh, you bett... The hell not. That is hand-stitched leather. You better drink it. Blocking off 6th Street. That was your turn, Mike! Damn it! Look, you are the navigator, okay? That's why you're sitting in that seat. Where are your glasses? You need to put your glasses on. - I don't need glasses. - Marcus, you can't see shit. Oh, sh... Mike. Mike. Mike. - Relax. Relax! - Mike. Bus, bus, bus. Sorry, rich white people. We're not just black, we're cops too. We'll pull ourselves over later. Hoo-hoo! Hey, even the Batmobile don't hold the road like this bitch. - Whoo! - Get me the fuck out of this car. - Hey! - Oh, shit. Come on, man. You can get that buffed out. No. You can get that buffed out. - Miami PD. Make a hole. - Coming through. - Make a hole. Miami PD. - Miami PD. Go! Go! Sorry. Daddy! Joker. You a pop-pop. - Hi. - Oh. Oh. - Oh, baby, look at him. - Yeah. - No doubt. It's in the eyes. - Mm-hm. And the ears. And the name. Marcus Miles Burnett. - But that's my name. - His name too. We decided to name him after you. It was Reggie's idea. Thought it would be a very respectful gesture, sir. - I hope you approve. - That's cool. But you still need to make a honest woman out of my baby girl there. Uncle Mike, ready to hold the baby? Oh, mm-mm. No. Uncle Mike don't want to catch that. Uh-uh, okay? That's that shit. - No, Mike. - Stop. Look at the baby. Stop it right now. Seriously. - Look at the baby. - Okay, you know what? I'll be outside when you get your shit together. Mike. - The baby. - Oh, it's okay. Aretas. Aretas. Mama. Come here, Marcus. Come here. We're here to celebrate and to raise a glass to one of our own. And I sincerely hope that someday your namesake follows in the footsteps of his old-ass grandpa... ...to protect and serve our fair city. To Marcus. To Marcus! May the name Marcus Burnett strike fear into the hearts and minds of assholes for years to come. Thank y'all. Thank... Thank you all. Mike and I, we're going on 25 years of working these streets. And I like to think we made a difference. You all are the best. And I thank you. It's been a real honor. Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Daddy buried that cash deep, huh? If these are empty, you're still gonna owe. - Whoa! - Mamma mia! Buried treasure in the ocean. I heard the stories, pero coo... Should cover the cost of the materials we discussed. And then some. This is what you get to keep. What'd you say? We had a deal. I'm renegotiating. Whoops. Whoops. Come here. Look at me. I don't renegotiate. My family's taking back management of this town. We're gonna need some, uh, loyal employees. Who wants a job? So how's your dental? Say that again. You give yourselves a raise. You start with that pile right there. - Okay? - Okay. You work for me now. Get your people to fall in line, stay out of my fucking way, and I won't kill you. Vamos, muchacho, get this money Dale! Vamos. Vamos! Mama. Armando. I'm done, Mike. Oh, here we go again. No, this time it's different. When I looked into that little baby's eyes, something changed. I want to spend my days watching that little boy grow. Man, Theresa does not want your ass sitting at home, getting fat and breaking shit. You know, Mike, we got more time behind us than in front. It's time to make some changes, for real. You can miss me with that. I'm living my best life. You're dyeing your goatee, Mike. - What? - You're dyeing your goatee. I am not dyeing my goatee. That's Midnight Cocoa Bean. I recognize that. - Go ahead with that shit. - That ain't Midnight Cocoa...? - Go ahead somewhere. - Let me ask you something. You want your legacy to be muscle shirts and a body count? Don't you know family is all that matters? Hey, granddaddy! - Rita. - Oh, no. Pop-pop. He's going with Pop-pop. - Pop-pop? - Yeah. Got pics, Pop-pop? - Oh, you know I do, right? - Let's see. There you go. Oh, my God, the ears! Yeah, my grandbaby. That's my grandbaby. - I love him. - Yeah. And congrats to you, lieutenant. I hear Howard tapped you to head up AMMO. Wow, congrats. What's AMMO? Advanced Miami Metro Operations. A small team trained in new tactics and investigative methods. Gonna replace us old dogs. - Or teach them some new tricks. - Heh. For real, Marcus. So happy for you. Thank you. Hey, guys! Hey! Everyone's here. How are you? Dumbass. - What? - She is perfect for you. Smart as hell. Confident. Ambitious. She just wasn't the one for me. - All right? - What is for you? Dying all alone and sad as shit? You just jealous. How long you been married? Twenty years? - Twenty-six. - Tell the truth. When's the last time you had sex? - None of your damn business. - Exactly. How many great women are you gonna let go? Heh. I mean, you get a lot of loving, but have you ever really been in love? Of course. I mean, yeah, I was... I was in love. One time. A long, long time ago. You never told me. Nigga, I don't tell you all my business. Look, all you need to know is that I'll be running down criminals till I'm 100. You the last brother that needs to be talking about running down anyone after the hospital. The hospital? What you talking about? What happened at the hospital? Running to see baby Marcus. I dusted your ass. You spent that run staring at my one good ass-cheek, Mike. You're saying that you actually outran me? - You beat me in a footrace? - It's been said. Oh, hell, no. Nothing sadder than old men revisiting the past. Whoa, hey, no stretching. Stretching is cheating. - Hey, who you got, Cap? - I got 50 on a torn ACL. I ain't running for free. - What's the bet? - I win, we lay it down. We turn in our papers and we retire. All right, well, when I win, you stop all this foolish retirement talk. We ride this thing till the wheels fall off. - Bad boys for life. - Uh, bad boys ain't really boys anymore. Hey, Cap, just have the ambo on standby. Old boy gonna need fluids and oxygen. - That's him, Cap. That's him. - Okay. On your mark, get set, go! - Go, Marcus! You got this! - Where you at? - You got this! Breathe! - Uh-oh, where you at? Come on, baby! Breathe, baby, breathe! Go! Where you at, baby?! Mike! Mike. Mike! Oh, shit! Get some help! I got an officer down. We're on Ocean Drive, 700 block. - Hold on. Hey. - Gunshot... - Oh, shit. - What happened? - Just get... Get some help! - Who did this?! Who the fuck did this?! Driving a motorcycle... Come on. Don't do this. - Mike, stay with us. - Come on. Get an ambulance! - Come on, Mike. Come on. - Hey, hey, hey. Phone... I got him on the phone. You gonna be all right. You gonna make it through this. Come on, man. Stay with us, man. Come on, Mike. I'm right here. Dear God... it's me, Marcus. You blessed me with a lot of stuff lately. I know I haven't been to church in a while. Probably Easter. But I ain't gonna lie, I wasn't paying attention. I haven't lost faith. It's just... I was ashamed at some of the stuff we had to do. I know ""thou shall not kill,"" but they were bad guys, all of them. You know, Mike hardly had a life yet. No wife, no kids. If you could just please find it in your heart to give him one more chance, man. Straight up, he's my best friend. My brother. If you just spare him, I swear to you, I will put no more violence in this world. A drive-by shooting has a famed Miami-Dade police officer fighting for his life. Witnesses report hearing shots and a blacked-out bike fleeing the scene. Lowrey remains in critical... Guys, let's run Cap through what we got on the case. Kelly, run us through ballistics. So the slugs in Officer Lowrey were SS190. P90 fires that caliber, the Herstal. But these were subsonic 5.7-by-28s, custom rounds. I wanna know who made those bullets. We are watching 4chan and cross-referencing players in the market with the feds' red lines. Mike's like a son to me. I want this asshole. This is personal for me too. Let's bring every single thing we got, all right? You got it. Retired DA Rodrigo Vargas was gunned down this afternoon. The DEA is mourning Jack Weber this evening, a 20-year forensic investigator for the agency in Miami. There you are. In yet another execution-style homicide... Judge Leon Sorenson was shot outside his courthouse late Wednesday. The war on law enforcement continues. Three other law enforcement personnel have been killed that could be linked. - It's a war on the goddamn law. - All the same shooter as Mike. - Connected how? - Traffic cams, witnesses, tire treads all put the same blacked-out bike at the scene. We want to thank you for joining us today. It means a lot to the family. And I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. I really gotta stop crying like this. Hey, you guys are great. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for our first toast. I'm going to bring up Officer Mike Lowrey, affectionately known as Uncle Mike. All right. Let's do this. First off, Reggie, I am shocked that you are even still here. I remember your first date with Megan, and trust me, me and Marcus did everything we could possibly do to make sure you never came back. But I'm telling you, love is hard. And your relationship will be tested. And your father and I have weathered storm after storm. And we have a mantra that we say to each other in our darkest days, and it always seems to bring us back together. And, Reggie, Megan, I would like to share it with you. We ride together, - we die together. - We die together. Bad boys for life! No. - No, what? - You know what. The minute I heard you were still breathing, I've been waiting for this shit to hit the fan. Look at me, Mike. No. You don't know what I'm gonna say. I know you. I know what you're gonna say. AMMO's got this. AMMO? Come on, Cap. AMMO? With all due respect, AMMO is a high school musical... boy band with guns. They don't even have shit. How do you know what they have or don't have? They have! - What do they have? What? - They have. The bullets they carved out of you, they were custom rounds for the P90 Herstal. AMMO's gonna find the dealer - that supplied your shooter. - How? State-of-the-art police work, that's how. Cap, look... All right. - Sir. - Sir? You are desperate. But I can't. Mike, I can't let you - investigate your own case. - All right. Let me investigate the Vargas case. No. The last thing I need is having IAD shoving a Hubble telescope up my ass for a full-on colonoscopy. - You know the rules. - Fuck the rules, Cap. Come on. Put me and Marcus on this shit. Have you talked to your partner? You retired? It's my daughter's wedding. Do we have to do this right now? Uh, yeah. - I told you I was retiring. - Wha...? What? Wait, nah, hold up. We raced, you lost. Now you reneging? What happened to bad boys for life? Yeah, for life. It's off. You died. What? The hell are you talking about? You coded out, Mike, three times. Marcus, look, this motherfucker stole something from me and I need it back. What did he take from you, Mike? You're still here. All he took from you was the legend, ""Bulletproof Mike."" But I saw you on the ground bleeding. You're human, just like the rest of us. Yeah, his ass bleeds too. Heh, I'm telling you, Mike. You go out there for vengeance, you gonna get someone killed. Oh, we definitely bringing some smoke. That fool put holes in me! And you're filling them with hate, Mike. Look, you need to start thinking about your karma, man. This was a sign. A sign, yeah. A sign to turn up. I'm supposed to bow down? Give this bitch a pass? ""Turn up""? What are you, 20? You need to turn that shit off. You know, Mike, heh... Rita called me every day you were in the hospital. There's something still there, a future. My future is hunting this motherfucker. Well, it's not mine. All right. So let me get this straight. So somebody get to dump my ass out in the street and you ain't gonna do shit? You just gonna quit? How dare you, man? I sat by your bedside. I wiped the drool off your chin, Mike. Don't disrespect me like that because you don't know. All right, all right. All right, man. Look, Marcus, I'm asking you. I'm begging you, man. I need this. Bad boys... one last time. No, Mike. No. Mama. Video of a shooting of a Miami detective has surfaced online, going viral in a matter of hours. The video first appeared on the darknet and soon spread to mainstream social media. Authorities believe the shooter uploaded the video himself. Too slow. You're slipping. Still had the key. What's up? Howard told me you wanted back in. Obviously, that can't happen. Says who? Michael... you got shot. Yeah, people keep reminding me of that. Well, why do you think that is? Huh? Oh, you shrinking me now. You say that when you don't wanna get real. No, I always say that when you start shrinking me. Hey, this is the type of case that AMMO was built for. You just have to trust me, that's all. Oh, come on. What? Why you always go there? This don't have nothing to do with me trusting you or not. - Oh, no? - No. Are you even healed? - Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah. - Yeah? - You sure you're fine? - Oh, shit. Rita. - You sure you're fine? Hey. - Rita. Stop. Rita. This is me you're trying to bullshit. If you get involved, you're gonna make mistakes you can't take back. - Hasta el fuego. - ""Hasta el fuego."" What does that mean? Where'd you get that? Until you burn? Until you die? You know me well enough to know not to ask me to quit. It's because I know you, I'm asking. Because I care about you. As a friend. Let us handle this. Shit. Alexa, turn down the volume. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ah! Marcus! You need to get out of the house! Sorry, baby. So sorry. How about a spa day? - Is that Manny's car? - Yeah. - Where's Manny? - He's in the back. Oh, shit. Mike Lowrey. What are you doing here, man? You look like a ghost, man. You know they say you're dead, fuckboy. I gotta show you something. The streets is talking. That cop shit ain't working for you. Come work for me at Manny's Prime Rib. See, look, you get dropped right here. And guess what. You're trending worldwide. Ow! My fucking hand, man! Yo, this ain't no fucking cop shit, man! What happened about reading my rights? This is not how it's supposed to go. You're supposed to ask me questions, and then I tell you, ""Go fuck yourself!"" What the fuck, man? Fuck! Ow! My fucking hand, man. P90 Herstals, custom, who's making them? Mike, I'm not in the game no more. Oh, nah? Okay. My bad. Ah! Mike, Mike, fucking chill, man. So all these vegans in Miami, and you want me to believe that that hot rod outside comes from selling pork chops? I work at Manny's. I'm a family man, - and I'm a hardworking man. - Oh. I got you... Oh, shit. Oh, man. Did you just get pig fat on my suit? Sorry, Mike. Sorry. No! Booker Grassie! That's the name! Booker Grassie! That's the name, man! Yo, Mike! Mike! Yo, Mike! The handcuffs, man! Booker Grassie. Only arms dealer in Miami customizing for the P90 Herstal. - What'd I tell you? - I know. I'm not supposed to investigate my own case. But this fool posted a video of him trying to kill me. I saw it. I can go after him vigilante style, or you can bring me in. Or I could shoot you myself. Fuck me! Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck! - If... - Mm-hm. ...I bring you in, to consult, and you go cowboy on me, I need you to comprehend the level-five shitstorm I will be drowning in. No gold-plated watch. No cop retirement village. I'm sticking myself out on a skinny limb! Scratch that. A twig in an ice storm! Me, on the edge, ""tithering."" You mean, teetering? That's what I said! And picture me very fat! Uh, think I got the image, Cap. - What is he doing here? - He's gonna be helping out. - I don't want him. - I'm not working with her. He's not. You're not. He's consulting. It's your show. - Captain, come on. - Wait. I know you guys got history together, - so let's not make it personal. - Personal? I'm the only one being professional. This is not dtente. I'm informing you of my decision. This is a bad idea. He's gonna investigate this case, no matter what! So this way, we keep him on a short leash, we control him. Uh, I'm standing right here, Cap. Mike will consult. He'll observe. That's it. Now, what do you got? Picked up chatter. The dealer we think customed those rounds, he's making another sale. - Booker Grassie. - Uh-huh. You share any other confidential information? What? Not me. He's the one that told me. Guess my old tricks still work a little bit. You're a distraction. You see that? That's what I like, teamwork. Already a beautiful relationship. The video, presumed to be posted by the shooter... Guys. This is Detective Michael Lowrey. He'll be joining us as an adviser only. Police have no suspects. And the shooter is still at lar... Nice to meet you all as well. - Thrilled to see you've had... - Sweet. I am much better now. Thank you. I am so sorry about that. - You look good, Michael. - Uh, look, she calls me by my whole government name, but everybody... You can just do Mike. - For sure, Mike. - Got it, Mike. Yeah, sure thing, Michael. - Ah, so you're that guy. - Hey, there's always one. - Yeah. Right up till there's not. - What's that supposed to mean? It's Mike Lowrey, okay? Be cool. For once. Let's load up! Ooh. Think I might be able to hang out with you guys after all. Nah, nah, that ain't the one. We're taking The Crawdaddy. Wait until you see the inside. - You need any help, Gramps? - Go ahead somewhere, boy. Look at you trying to be all cool and shit. Okay, everybody is way too serious. Raids are supposed to be fun. They're like field trips with guns. This is not a raid. It's surveillance. Surveillance? Right. Meaning we're just gonna watch the crime. We'll record him in the deal and bring him in facing serious time. Then we'll get him to talk and he's gonna tell us everything that we need to know. Or since he's gonna be there and we're gonna be there, I mean, we could just grab him. Well, thank you for your input. Okay. Listen up. Booker Grassie is the guy that sold the bullets we took out of Michael. Hey, look, um, you think you could stop calling me Michael in front of everybody? It's your name. Okay. Relax and clear your mind. Use God's inspiration to bring people peace and tranquility by penetrating their souls with your heart. We're here. Excuse me, Mr. Lowrey. - Just need to get past, please. - Sure thing, buddy. Uh, you're the tech, huh? Jeez. They just leave you in the van? Yeah, I'm more, uh... More comfortable in here. Got it. Sending in Big Barry. You're not Big Barry? He's our, uh, surveillance drone. Ah, so you send the drone in. Let's fly. I guess Barry gets to have all the fun. There. Black pickup truck. - That's our H-77 Boyz. - Who are they? These guys are definitely from out of town. Trying to step up. I need wide angle, whole deal. Zoom in. Booker's hooking them up with a crate of 5.7-by-28s. - That's Booker Grassie. - There's our deal. Audio. Here it is. These will put a hole through anyone and anything you point your gun at. - I guarantee my product. - He's right there, Rita. - We can grab him. - No. I'm not risking the collateral damage. - Let's move. - Let's wait. - You're the boss. - Yeah, I know. - That's what I just said. - I just confirmed it. - Okay. - You two used to date, right? - Sort of. - Not really. Need to see the cash. - See the cash. - Wait. Back. Go back. Right there. That guy. - What? - I need to see it. The bag is empty. There's no money in the bag. It's a rip. I need to see yours. They're gonna kill... It's a rip. - Michael. - We need Booker alive! Michael, get back here! Shit. Kelly, go. Go! Get me body cams. Michael, do not engage until we have the rest of the team in position. Can we count the cash, or what? This is a nice song. Put it louder. Now! Put it down! Put it down! Can you hear me? I'm gonna need you to lay me down some cover. We're coming to you. All right. You wanna live, you stay with me. Fuck with me and I'm gonna kill you. Coming at you on three. Bring the truck! Grab the merch! One, two, three. Shit. Shit. Shit. Hey. Hey. Booker. Booker, look at me. Hey. Hey. Don't die. P90 Herstals. P90 Herstals, who's the buyer? Oh, shit. - Hey, hey. Booker. Booker. - Michael? Hey, get an ambulance in here now. Get the paramedics. - Booker. Booker. - Uh, Michael. - Just bring them in. - Calm down. Hey, just do what I ask you for once, please! He's dead! - Is that Diego or his twin? - Shh! Yeah, yeah, his twin. Carmelita, no, no, no. - Who this? - It's Carver Remy. Look here, I'm busy, all right? Don't waste my time, Carver. Leave me alone. Come on, man. It's important. Keep an eye on my baby. - Marcus. - I'm retired. Only rats I talk to are in my basement. - Carmelita shot the wrong twin! - Oh, shit. The guy who shot Mike, he's trying to kill me. - What? - I'm serious. A guy on a black bike's been tracking me. The one on the news. It's him. - Bullshit. - Marcus, would I lie to you? Yes. That's why we stopped using your ass as a CI. - I'm telling you, it's him. - What do you want? Protective custody. To not die. Please, man. Use me as bait, whatever. You want this guy? He's coming for me. - You talk to Mike? - I called you. Nineteenth and Miami. Third floor. I'll be waiting. What did I say? No, no. What did I say? I said consult. I said observe. I... Look at this... This mess. It's carnage! I didn't do all this shit. They did this to each other. Wait, wait, wait. You didn't shoot anybody? - You know I shot some people. - Yeah. - Look, they had already started. - What...? Ah, Jesus. Mike, you promised. - No, no, I didn't promise. - You promised. - I said I could picture you... - Yeah. ...on a limb, fat as hell, with sharks and some shit. Right. That's a promise. We were here to watch. What? Yeah, and I saw. All right, Cap, look. The bag is empty, all right? No cash. The guy reached up and scratched his nose. I saw it had no weight to it. - That's very impressive, sir. - Yeah. See, I like that one. If I hadn't come in, Grassie was a dead man for sure. That's a relief, because your guy's in a body bag - and he sure looks dead. - Cap. Ah... Good job, Mikey. Hey, look. Young boy, seriously. Let me tell you something. Stay in a child's place, all right? Spare me the street knowledge, grandpa. Nobody asked. Just because I fucked your mother - don't make me your grandpa? - Oh, oh, oh. - Fucked my mother? - That's enough. - Stop. - You got me fucked up. - Old ass. - Stand down! Let's go. - You better go on. - Let's go. I will knock your ass clean the fuck out. - Knock me out. Hit me. - What am I, a nursery school teacher? Come on, let's go! Shit. I got time today. Cool down. Keep walking. - Excuse me, sir. - Go ahead, man. - Do you guys want a...? - No, go. Just go ahead somewhere. What? What, quitter? This is some sad shit. Where the hell is your ride? Girls took it to the spa. You all right? I'm fine. You all right? Never felt better. I mean, you could, if you wanted to, just do the speed limit. You let a Prius pass us. And what is that? What, you got your balls tucked up in there? Hey. You know what? Neither one of my balls wanna be here with your stupid ass. You brought Little Marcus on a murder investigation? We're dropping him at the spa. Dropping him off at the spa? Carver is scared. He is not gonna wait, man. It's on the way, Mike. And what's the person that shot me want with a snitch like Carver Remy anyway? I'm taking you to find out, motherfucker. Sorry about that, Little Marcus. Pop-pop shouldn't be swearing like that. Only when you're dealing with people like Mike Lowrey, you got no fucking choice. Sorry. There I go again. - Take the baby in. - Oh, I ain't going in there. Then you ain't gonna find out who tried to kill you. See, if I go in there, I know who's gonna kill me. - Theresa Burnett. - Stop fucking around. Take your baby. Go ahead. Mike, Carver's scared. He ain't gonna wait all day. All right. All right. Uh-uh. No. Mike! Mike! Tell Marcus I'm gonna kill him! Go, go! - Go, go, go! - What'd she do? What'd you do? - Is she coming? Oh, shit! - Go, go, go! Mike, you known Theresa a long time. How pissed would you say she was? - What you mean? Like, one to 10? - Yeah, 10 being... Like when I broke up with your sister? No. That was me at a 10. - Why would you bring that up? - All right. I'm just trying to... No, a Theresa 10 would be... Me that time you spilled Frappuccino in my Ferrari. Yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. Uh, she's probably like a nine, then. - A nine? Oh, sh... - Yeah, man. Oh, shit. Better make it a 10. Forgot to give her the baby wipes. Oh, tragedy. Are you stopping? Dude, that was a yellow light. We are in a hurry. Come on... Oh, what? You embarrassed to be seen like this? We got Mike Lowrey here! Mike Lowrey in a Nissan Quest! Nobody gives a shit, Mike. He's... He's my Uber driver! A big part of fighting crime is being ahead of the criminals. You don't have to stop for pigeons. You just drive up to them. They'll fly away. That better be a safe... or a piano. Oh! - This is my wife's car! - And that's fucking Carver Remy! You don't know that's Carver Remy. That could be anybody. - Cover the front door! - I'm retired! I'm a civilian! Oh... This is a sign. It's a sign from God. Oh! Oh, shoot. She knows. She always knows. I need 315 at the Broadmoor Hotel. Fuck! God, I know I asked you to help Mike out before... but he's really getting his ass whupped. Lord, give me a sign. What the hell are you doing? Mike! Shit! You okay? I'm better than you gonna be when Theresa see this car. Armando... Pass it! Pass it! Thattagirl! Thattagirl, Callie! Make them wanna play soccer! - You're done, Mike. - Yeah, I know. No! If she fouls you, you foul her back! - Yes! - Yeah. So there's this... This Buddhist guy, right? And, uh, you know, mountain man, way up high, going down this long winding road. And out of nowhere, this other guy is riding a horse right toward him. He's Buddhist too, I think. Actually, I'm not sure. Just let them both be Buddhist, Cap. Okay, fine. So the guy on the horse is riding toward our guy so fast that our guy's gotta get out of the way, so as not to be trampled by the horse. And the guy gets up, all dusty, and he goes: ""Hey, where the fuck are you going?"" And our guy on the horse, he says: ""I don't know! Ask the horse!"" Ask the horse? Huh. Exactly. Yes! Yes! See that face...? That. That? That's it. That was my face. The horse represents all of our fears and traumas. And it's got us running around a hundred miles an hour, to the point where we can't even answer a simple question. ""Where are you going?"" Where are you going, Mike? No, Callie! Don't pass! Shooters shoot! Kid's got the family curse. Mike... you gotta get control of your life. You gotta grab the reins before your horse runs you off a cliff. Come over for dinner. Callie would love to see you. I'll read you a Buddhist story. I got a book full of them. Wait, you gonna be cooking again? - Hell, yeah. - Ooh... - All right. We'll order pizza. - Yeah, I think I can do that. Bingo. - Cap! - I don't know! Go, go, go! Get him. I can help. What does he need? - Shoot. - Cllate. - Through the bitch. - No, move. - Get behind the car. - I can help. Move! Get behind the car! What's wrong with you, man? You had that shot. No innocents. You crazy, man, you know that? Three-fifteen. Shots fired. Officer down. Jose Marti Park. We need Air One on a three. This is Detective Mike Lowrey. The captain is down. The captain is down. Ready! Aim! Fire! Ready! Aim! Fire! Ready! Aim! Fire! You were right, man. You said if I went out there, I was gonna get somebody killed. One last time? One last time. I ran a suspicious financial report on Booker. All his LLC fronts have the same accountant. Picante Jenkins, CPA. Yep. You don't meet too many Picantes. So we just gonna do a knock-and-talk? Yeah. Whoa! What the hell is all that? What you talking about? Mike, you don't need a grenade launcher. Yeah, but I want one. He's an accountant, Mike. Look, Mike, we're not going in there like that. - Like what? - Hey, look, all our lives, we've been bad boys, all right? Now it's time to be good men. Who in the hell wanna sing that song? Good men, good men What you gonna do?  Well, maybe if you sang the song like you meant it, it'd catch on. Nah. Knock and talk. Yeah. Knock, knock. - Mike! Mike! - Miami PD! Get down! - Mike! Mike! - Get down! - What is happening? - Mike! What happened to knock and talk? Hey, you broke my door. You broke my door! Sir, sorry about the door, okay? A little Gorilla Glue will make that just fine. - Hey, where's your warrant? - I need you on your knees with your hands behind your head right now! Sir, if you keep moving, I'm gonna shoot you in your face. - No, he's not. - Yes, I am! Mike, the man is an accountant. We just need to talk to him. So you wanna have a conversation with a coked-out orange mountain? Here's the latest figures. Look, let me handle this, okay? Just back up. I'm gonna penetrate this man's soul with my heart. What? Yeah. Watch and learn. Hey! Hey, ass licker. I'm gonna fast-food fist-fuck you. Sir, that's just nasty. Now, I recognize that this is a difficult situation. - Don't come over here. - Don't go over there, Marcus. We just need your client's receipts. - What? - Booker Grassie. - Any record of...? - Unh! Mm. Hey. How deep you think you got in his soul? Sometime you gotta suffer for what is right. Don't you turn that other cheek. - Get off me! - All right. Now, sir, I realize that you're scared. Hell, we all scared. You know, sometimes fear just... So, what you thinking? I think you should handle this one. Yeah, me too. Hey! MLK just tapped out. You got Brother Malcolm now. We can handle this by any means necessary. I recognize you. You're that cop that got shot. Bad year you're having, Butterscotch. If you didn't have that gun and badge, I'd fucking eat you. This the only thing that's keeping you from eating me? - Yeah. - Oh. Bring it, big boy. - Left line clear! - Cuff him. What the hell are y'all doing here? I called them. What? What happened to bad boys one last time? This is one last time. But this here's the remix, Mike. We work with AMMO now. That's that shit, okay? You got three seconds before I bite it off. Get your damn finger out my face. So tell us. Judge, prosecutor, criminal informant, the captain, and you. Who do you have in common? Hundreds of investigations, operations... Eight hundred and forty-seven cases in the nexus of the victims. Well, who up there wants to kill you? - Hell, who doesn't? - All right. That just the criminals that we're looking at. I don't trust a person that don't wanna kill him. - Hell, put my name up there. - Thanks. Got it. Appreciate it. What you get out of the accountant? - His records are a mess. - Surprising. But I did manage to get into his Keychain. - So? - All of his social. Boom. Looking at a lot of dick pics but not so many clues. Facial rec for anyone in our system. On it. That's three days before I got hit. Hey, go back to that last shot. The chain. Yeah, zoom in. - Heh. Zway-Lo. - Zway-Lo. - Who's Zway-Lo? - Lorenzo Rodriguez. Goes by Zway-Lo. Used to coach him in peewee hoops before he went for that thug shit. Great player, but I had to bench him during the championship. You benched a 10-year-old in the championship? Yeah. Little fucker called me a dickhead. - Did y'all win at least? - Hell, no. He was our star player. We lost by 40, but I made my point. Okay, there's no ""I"" in ""team."" There is one in ""dickhead"" though. Man, shut up. Look, Zway-Lo's into drugs, weapons. He's one of Taglin's lieutenants. Taglin was found dead the same night Mike got shot. I guess he's someone else's lieutenant now. Lorenzo Rodriguez. No mortgage, not even a bank account. But it is his birthday tomorrow. If he's celebrating, there's three spots for a cat like that. Ditto, Ice 45, Zillion. Can you get into their club records? Pfft, Ice 45 should really up their cyber security. Okay. Ice 45. Ditto. Zillion. There. Rodriguez. - Bam! - The party's tonight. Zillion it is. All right, we meet at the club at 2300, UC, so wear your Sunday best. This is a grab. We're in. We're out. No bodies. This raid is strictly nonlethal. Nonlethal. Has anyone informed the bad guys? ACLU rounds. Rubber. Trust me, you'll enjoy them. You get to shoot as much as you want.  Bad boys, bad boys  - Oh, hell, no. -  Whatcha gonna do?   Whatcha gonna do When we come...?  Hey, hey, hey! Uh-uh. - No, uh-uh. - No! No! Never. Y'all will never do that again.

I feel like I'm locked up since... Hey, Marcus, you know they can hear you? It's too loud. They can't hear us. They can't hear us. Look, look, sometime I go to the Internet, and I see some weird shit on there. - I saw a man put his... - Marcus. - Marcus. - What? We can hear you. Oh! Oh! Ha, ha! That's a little jokey joke. Y'all didn't hear that, did you? - In position. - Setting up. Mike, Marcus, meet you at the top. Mike and Marcus moving, stairs right. Rita on the move, stairs left. - Everybody in position? - Set. - Set. - Set. That dress is incredible, girl. - You got style. - Oh, hi. - Thank you. - Yeah. Stand by. Stand by. Stand by. I can't.

Whoa! - Ugh! - Putting your seat belt on? - Yeah. - That's how we do it now? - You're damn right. Number one's on my ass! Crossing 395 into Overtown. Whoa, Mike. Overtown's a no-go. Zway got people here. Dangerous people. We're dangerous people. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shit, whoa! Damn Nerf gun, rubber bullet bullshit. They shooting slugs, we firing gummy bears. Mike, pull over for a minute. I need to tell you something. - Pull over? - Yeah. One second. Let me see if Zway will pull over. Zway-Lo! Marcus needs to pull over for a second! Hey, can we get a time-out? Damn it, Mike, I need to tell you something! - What? - I made a promise to God. - To who? - To God. What the hell are you talking about? Look, I told the Lord that if you made it through that I would make no more violence. He definitely knew you was bullshitting with that. Violence is what we do. It's about your soul, Mike. Our job is to protect and serve. You're damn right. I'm about to serve this bitch right now. - Oh, shit! What...? - Oh, shit. Oh, look at that! - Damn! - Oh! That is some Elephant Man shit right there. - Yo, you see that? - Oh! - Yeah, I see it. - Hey, stop it. - It's calling me, Mike. - What? Leave it... I can't help it, but it's calling me. Stop it.

Oh! - Get that ATV! I got the six! - Oh! Yes! No! Mike! Mike! Mike! What the hell you doing?! Oh! Lord, I don't wanna die this way! - Mike! - Oh, shit! - My bad, my bad. - Damn right, that's your bad! Oh, shit. Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Ahh! Mike! Mike! - Ahh! - Whoa! Oh, oh! Get out of the fucking way! Haste el fuego. Hey, Dorn. I need you. Hey, hey, look. I been there before. Many times. It's gonna be all right. That's Zway-Lo's phone. Can you break it? - Yeah. What am I looking for? - Who he's talking to. Call logs. And I'm gonna need you to hurry up just a little bit. Okay, but I'm gonna have to go on the dark side. All right. You good with that? Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Let's do it. Dorn, he's a big guy. How'd he get so good at this stuff? - What stuff? - Tech shit. - He looks like a killer. - Is. Used to be a bouncer. Guy one night was getting physical with a woman... Yeah, big man lost it. Hit him. - Bastard dropped dead. - Avoided the fight ever since. Here we go. Give me the last two months. Shit. Mexico. What are you after here? All right. To each one of those numbers, I need you to text the phrase, ""Hasta el fuego."" Done. All right. I got it. Thank you. - You sure? - I got it. Go. We're shut down. - What? - What do you mean, shut down? AMMO's done. I'm sorry. Look, everything's gonna be all right. Trust me on this, okay? Everything's gonna be all right. Mm-mm. Mike. You all right? I think he's my son. What? Twenty-four years ago, before we partnered up, um... Captain Howard pulled me right out of the academy. Uh, nobody knew who I was. He sent me in undercover with the Aretas cartel. Sorenson. Weber. Vargas. Carver. All of the victims were on that case. This is revenge. Yeah, Mike, but you weren't on that case. My name wasn't on it. That's how deep I was. I was Ricky Rollins. Benito Aretas. He's dead, Mike. He ain't after you. Not him. His wife. Isabel. I was her driver. We connected so... deep. We talked about everything. She showed me the whole game. How to walk it, how to talk it, put clothes on it. She made Mike Lowrey. - We fell in love. - Heh. Are you telling me the one time that you...? Isabel Aretas. The one time. Takedown was coming. DEA, ATF, everybody. And I was gonna ghost the whole operation. Me and Isabel were gonna run away with each other. What made you change your mind? They call her La Bruja. The Witch. She is into some dark shit. Santa Muerte. That woman... was a stone-cold killer. So I had to put the woman I love behind bars for the rest of her life. Chose the badge, and I've been choosing it ever since. Mike, you fucked a married witch? So all the shit I just said, and that was your takeaway? No, it's just a lot to digest. You think you know somebody and... Well, hell, now it explains why you dress like a drug dealer. So you wanna hear this shit or you don't? Sorry. But you don't know that's your son, Mike. You don't know who that witch was fucking. Benito Aretas couldn't have kids. Isabel gave birth in prison, eight months after her arrest. ""Hasta el fuego."" He said that to me before I jumped from the chopper. Me and Isabel made that up. It's not even real Spanish. It's some shit we said to each other. It meant like, ""We'll be together until we burn."" - Nah, Mike. - Marcus, he's the right age. He's crazy like me. He's ruthless like me. He's fearless like me. He's the fucked-up me. No, Mike. You the fucked-up you. You jumping to conclusions. All right? Shit's gonna work itself out. You gotta trust that. Yeah... You're right. Oh, man. Aw. I love you, man. I love you, man. - I gotta go. All right? - Mike. Mike. Let me get past you there, sir. Sorry there. Excuse me. Excuse me. That's the right spot for me right there. Oh, excuse me, sir. Seat right there. Let me get by you. Watch your toes. Watch your toes there. It's all right. There you go. No, Marcus. I'm not letting you go on a suicide mission alone, Mike. This is on me. I'm not letting anybody else get killed dealing with my shit. Mike, she's a bruja. She'll make your eyes melt into your stupid-ass head. She'll make your dick fall off. I meant penis. You should be minding your own business anyway. Marcus, please go home. We fly together. We die together. - What? - Oh, no. That's just something we say. It's all good. It ain't... Oh, I can see how that got y'all a little... Uh, where y'all from? Where you from? So, what you gonna do when you see him? You really gonna put your son behind bars? No. I'm gonna kill him. Kill him? You really gonna kill your own son, Mike? I'm gonna put him in a fucking bag. - You mind if we switch seats? - Yeah, please. Excuse me. You realize you will go to hell? - I don't believe in hell, Marcus. - Well, it believes in you. I mean, killing your own son. Brother, that's a darkness that swallows you whole. Well, maybe I already been swallowed. I died, remember? I'm ending this shit, man. I should have known he was your son. Because the way he whupped your ass, Mike. That was a ass-whupping straight from thy own loins. A supernatural ass-whupping. - Mm-mm. - Well... Mm-mm. Can I be the godfather? You know what you can be, Marcus? - What? - Quiet. - Oh, I should be quiet? - Yeah. All right, you just had a warlock baby with La Bruja who's trying to kill your ass, probably mine too, sucking our blood and all of that shit, but I should be quiet. Yeah. Yeah, okay, Mike. How you fuck a witch without a condom? You wrap that shit up, man. Hey, my man. We need to change seats. Yep. Okay. Mike y Marcus. This makes us even for Miami. Yo, we hot. - You called them again. - Hey, Rita called me. - What's up, fellas? - Hey. Hey. Hey. Hola. I feel better when they're here. Yeah, me too. Whoa, where'd you get all the toys? DEA station in Cuernavaca. We capture her, they take the credit. Get ourselves killed, they've got nothing to do with it. All eyes on me. I'm the bait. We meet at Hidalgo Palace. It's an old hotel outside the city. I'll keep her talking till you guys spot the shooter. - What if she just shoots you? - Nah, she's gonna wanna talk. We, uh... have history. Okay. Snatch and grab. We get them, and we're on a plane to the States by dawn. Dorn, get me a floor-plan satellite image. We'll have eyes on the outside and... on the inside. Hey. Nobody touches the shooter. He's mine. Uh, yes, he is. You, uh, coloring a little bit outside the lines today, huh? Don't die. You make sure we both come home. No identifiable threats. Monitoring channels inside. Jamming everything in case they're running countersurveillance. No way she's here alone. It's the cartel. She's gonna have serious backup. Marcus is moving towards the back. Marcus, we're covering your position from the sky. Still nothing. Moving in closer. Hola, Ricky. Hola, Isabel. I'm gonna kill her myself. Keep it. Where is he? This is some real telenovela shit. Ah... Shit! I just lost all comms. - Fuck. AMMO? - Marcus, come in. - Shit. - They're jamming us. They know we're here. This is fucked. - I can't get back in. - Still got Baby Barry on an outside frequency. Mm. It was gonna be a surprise. After we ran away. I'm seeing tactical movement. Twenty to 30 threats forming a perimeter. We gotta go. - Alt points of entry? - Here. That cold airflow could be a laundry exhaust. How could you do this to our son? My son. Who does he think I am? Exactly who you are: The coward, the traitor... Don't do this. Keep it moving, detective. You see that? Drop it. Let's go! Let's go! What you gonna do? - Hasta el fuego. - Whoa. No ""el suego."" That means fire, right? - Cllate. - No, no ""cate."" You and this man need to talk. - It's life-changing shit. - Shut the fuck up. - Easy on the barrel! Easy! - Marcus, relax. Mike, it's lack of communication that got this shit fucked up. He needs to tell you something. You ain't gonna like it, but you need to hear it. Oh, shit! Yo, Mike, they're moving up to the chopper! Marcus! - Put your glasses on! - What the hell was that? That was a bad throw! Yo, Mike, careful! You were right about the glasses. I been telling your ass that shit for years. Shit, this is like HD! Go! Go! Go! Contact! Twelve o'clock! Go! Go, go, go! Hey, Isabel and the shooter went up the stairs. Can you cover us? - Kelly! Flank right! - Copy! - Rafe, pan left! Push! - Copy that! - Dorn, follow Rafe! - Yup! Hey, big man. I'm gonna need you to hurt some people. I'll pay for therapy, all right? I'm gonna need it. Seriously. - Yeah, I got you. - I'll hold the middle. - You push hard for the stairs. - Push hard for the stairs. Yeah. Hey. It's good shit, lieutenant. You too, detective. You ain't such a dumbass after all. On me! Go! Transition! Go! Shit. - Shoot! - Take them both! Right there, right there! Where the hell they getting all these helicopters?

The building's coming down! We gotta move! Mike! Marcus! Shit. On your knees, Isabel. Get down. Mike! Let that be a lesson to your witch ass. Armando... you're my son. You're my son. I don't wanna fight. Uh-uh. Stay down. I said, stay down. I didn't know. If I had known... Mike, what are you doing? I'm trying to penetrate his soul... with my heart. No. No, Mike, no. I was going through something. Who are you? I told you. Liar. Last chance. Who are you? Ask your mother. Hey, y'all see all this fuego? - Can we take this shit outside? - Cllate. - Tell him! - Tell him, mama. Is he my father?! Yes. Kill him. - No, no, wait, wait, wait... - Shit. Lay down. Down. Down.

I can't promise you it's gonna be all good... after all the stuff you've done, but... I can promise you I'm gonna be there, all right? Hey. I'm your Uncle Marcus. But we'll talk about that later. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. - Whoa. Hey. - Hey. There we go. - All right. - Oh, my God. - Wow. - You guys. - There it is. - Yes.

I just started therapy. My therapist thought it'd be beneficial if maybe we could hit up a group sesh together. - It's super sick. - Oh, for sure. - Definitely. - Yeah, we will be there. - Marcus, let me holler at you. - Yeah. Uh, let me think about it. - He want us to go to therapy. - Yeah, I'm not going. Ha, I'm not going. Hey, man, look, um... We don't say this kind of shit to each other, man, but just... thank you. Mike, you don't have to thank me. If you wanna retire, just know that I am not gonna try to stop you. You earned it. And I will support you 100, no matter what. - But you're forgetting one thing. - Hm? - We said for life. - For life, baby. - There's my nephew. - Yes. - Hey. - Little Marcus just woke up. Okay, first things first. Little surprise for you. Three days at the Marion Springs Resort. You know, kind of a little apology for the spa day I crashed. Yes, a little quality time, baby. - Quality time. - Yeah, baby, but Megan and Reggie are on their honeymoon. Oh, I got the baby this weekend. Me and my AMMO squad. You and Theresa go ahead, have fun.

I'll check on you tomorrow. - I'll bring wine. - Rita, stop playing. Hey, no. Y'all all agreed that we were all gonna stay with the baby. Marcus, I'll be in the car. - Just text my mom. - Oh, okay, that's not fun... No. Okay. All right, all right. Shh. Hey.  Bad boys, bad boys   Whatcha gonna do?

Our regiment's location might have been compromised. The commanders have ordered us to halt harvesting and sabotage operations. And break out of the encirclement. Light machine guns. Air burst. Grenade launchers. No heavy weapons. Not quite right, keep listening. Armoured units. West side. The planes are their vanguard. They are smoking us out. Inform every company to withdraw independently. Entire regiment is to rendezvous at Ziya River by daybreak tomorrow. Do you copy? Gone deaf? Copy that, Sir. Grain in Ear. Silent Shrike. I told you it's just an air raid. Japs don't tunnel. Message from Chief of Staff. Japs have discharged the dam. We are not the enemy. Release. - We are not the enemy. - Put down the gun. Put down. Not the enemy, put down your gun. Don't touch my stomach. Put her down. The urgent message is that Japs have discharged the dam. Our only chance of crossing is to detour via Dayin village. Sons of bitches. I want everyone accounted for. Get their finger prints. Every soul. Take it. It's for the road, bro. - No, thank you. - There's more. That's very kind of you, madam. Take it. Thank you, madam. My man gave me the gun. Around early spring he came home and left the gun with me. The name is Xiao Shuncheng. He claimed to be from 23rd Regiment. It's verified. Dachunzi is a military spouse. Been over 9 months. Baby is due soon. How's your neck? It's alright. Nasty scratch. Let me have a look. It's nothing. I said it's nothing. You deserved it for being mindless. Another inch and you're dead. What am I to do? Your family affairs are not my business. I was talking about these folks. What are you talking about? We don't have much time. They'll be doomed if the Japs get here. The river isn't far, but the path is mountainous. Are we bringing them or not? We'll bring them if it's possible, but I don't believe it is. 52 people, most of whom can barely walk. I heard that the Japs have left some villages untouched. Perhaps they can hide underground. You think you're smart and the Japs can't find them like we did? Exactly. We can't just hope for the best. Especially with military families. They will be eliminated. What are you blaming me for? Am I being heartless? Why are you yelling? I'm not yelling. Have I yelled? Japanese armoured vehicles are on our tail. Keep procrastinating and we might as well let Big Guy dig a larger grave for them and us, plus the horses. Mom. Whose child is this? Mom. Listen to me. Bring a few more men. What if you can't find the 3rd Company? Bring Chengfeng along. When it comes to intel-collecting, he's better than either one of us. You trust me with your child. If anything happens to him, how am I gonna tell you? I'm already grateful that Huang Rui is with me. My marksmanship has no rivals in the cavalry and the army. You're almost perfect, except for your bragging. What's the bloody hurry? Make haste. Even if it's the last thing I do, I'll steer this bull to the south. When you have crossed the river, send up a flare. Wang. Stay safe and sound. God is on our side. Dachunzi tried every horse and none was mountable. She said they'll rock her baby out. Can't even complete such a simple task. You think I am not busy? She lost her man. What? Her man is dead. I didn't know what to say when she asked me. A while ago, at Raoyang, the entire 23rd Regiment was wiped out. You. Come here. Can you take care of him? Of course. Sankui. Eat this. Leave them to Big Boss. Listen up, if you want to live, follow us. Big Boss. Be careful. Don't kick his belly. Who is Big Boss? Do as you're told. Obey all military orders. Big Boss. To my father, this horse is more precious than I am. Get moving, old lady. Honey. Honey. Our valuables are under the bed. The Japs have eyes everywhere. When I give the order, everyone is to keep their mouth shut. If you have to fart, keep it inside your pants. Let's go. Keep moving. Enemy aircraft. Take cover. Enemy aircraft. Take cover. Spread out and protect the civilians. Not that way. Come this way. Spread out and protect the civilians. Go. Quickly. Hide underground. Futing and Yupo. Monkey and Jingguo. Mount and shoot. Yang and Long, prepare for ambush. Erya. Erya. Go. Big Guy. Wait till he takes the bait. Grandpa. I know. For your grandpa. Big Guy. For your grandpa. Grandpa. All the other companies have crossed the river except for 3rd. No news about Commissar, Huang Rui and them. No news is good news. Commissar must have led them into the maze. From a young age, I've never been treated like he was. What is this? Mugwort. Rub it over your neck wound. Back in the Combined Arms Brigade, there was this kid from Shanxi and tetanus took his life. He was about your age. You think I'm afraid of death? I fear that you are not. I joined the army in 1925. I've seen too much. I was leading a recon platoon last year, and on Mount Taihang I encountered my first poison gas. About half the platoon, horses and men, their bodies were covered with blisters. My life was saved by Big Boss's speed. I am alive because I'm always the first to charge. When you wanted to join the army your mom went berserk with me. If you want to be a hero, I won't stop you. But my son can never be a casualty. I chose to defend our country but I feel guilty about your mother. If you have to die, die after me. Or else I'll be ashamed to face your mother. He peed on your hand. You did the same at his age. Nothing noticeable. The Japs are finally quiet. Our regiment has crossed the river. - Any news of Commissar? - None. How about this? I'll take a few men to search for them with fast horses. We'll return by daybreak. I heard that. Count me in. You. Without me, how are you gonna get any messages out? I'll take the transmitter and leave the receiver behind. When you rendezvous with the regiment, send up a flare. When I see the flare I'll send you a situation briefing immediately. Let's seize this opportunity while the Japs are taking a nap. Commander. No kicking of his belly. Copy that. What's wrong? An emergency. Once we use the transmitter the Japs will locate us. District Command demands radio silence for all units while operating in enemy-occupied areas. Bloody Japs. That's why we can't shake them off. The Japs are betting big. Looks like a lot of men. We can't outrun them. If we fight how long can we last? Given our firepower, we might last for 30 seconds, or perhaps just five. Grandpa. Anywhere beyond this bend and we'll be made. Bloody Japs. We might die anyway. I say we take some of them with us. Get your weapons ready. Hold on. Radio guy. Colonel. The cavalry's last transmission was from these mountains. Without my orders, nobody moves. All units, forward. Chao. Shoot the flare. What? Shoot the flare. Shoot the flare. Shoot the flare. Shoot it. Good news at last. They've crossed the river. Halt. Halt. Chengfeng's message. Commissar and Huang Rui were killed in action. We Regroup immediately. Colonel, we just intercepted their radio signal, which came from Yechenzuo village. This flare is a decoy. The real target is the village. Move out. What's going on? Why are the Japs withdrawing? Commander, you asked Chengfeng to transmit when he sees the flare. Everyone, get ready to move out. Keep moving. Quickly. Quickly, the villagers have arrived. Mother, there are boats. We're saved. The boats are here for us. Colonel, no more Chinese troops to be found. Thank goodness. We're saved. Thank you so much. We're saved. Go. Our signal triangulation was cracked by the enemy. Colonel, they've tricked us. Looks like they have a death wish. Chengfeng, don't try to be like your father. This battle is not yours to fight. It's still undetermined who'll be the first to charge. Fire. Stop. Baby's coming out. It's a boy. Colonel, the Chinese troops on the hill are defenseless, we will eliminate them soon. Release. Enemy cavalry spotted at our rear. Turn all cannons around. Turn all cannons around. Quickly. Fire. Fire. Quickly. Stop the charging cavalry. Stop the charging cavalry. Stop them now. All weapons free. Fire at will. Bastard. They are coming towards us. Their horses are too fast. Hold the line. Don't fall back. They're getting close. They're too fast. Charge. Charge. I'm Luo Tong. For honor and glory I fight the battles. What do you want? Kid. Commander. It's alright. Here. You are Sankui. Mother. Mother. What's wrong? This is your child? What's his name? What's his name? Chengfeng. No running. Wait till I catch you... Kid, this is not a playground. I'll beat you up! Look at the mess you made. Get out! An explosion! Another explosion! Hurry, if you're too slow, you'll miss it. Get up there! Quick! Wait for me! Get out of the way! Can you see it? I see smoke. Come down! Over there. The data before the test run was fine. I don't know what caused the explosion. Let's send the debris for analysis. Yes. We must pinpoint the explosion point to determine the cause of the explosion. Then we must account for the entire ignition process. Cameras alone are not sufficient. Next time I will inspect it visually, if that's what it takes. Master Yu, I heard your son was in another fight. With whom? With Master Zhang's son. Dont't worry about it. Master, Take a break, please. Smells good. We are having meat today! Wow, meat! Your loss if you don't eat some. Own up to your mistake, or you won't get to eat. I won't eat then. I did nothing wrong. But you got into a fight with Little Four Eyes. Look at him. Clearly, he lost to Four Eyes. He lost the fight. I hit him first. Of course, I didn't lose. Tell your mother that you are sorry. Then you get to eat. I won't. Then I must teach you a lesson. I will ask you one more time. Are you sorry? No. Shush. Are you sorry? No. You dare talk back to me! You're not sorry for hitting someone? That's enough. Let's eat. You should have listened to me. You could have avoided the spanking. Let's eat. Let's. I know why my brother was fighting. Brother Four Eyes said Dad makes firecrackers. Whoever makes firecrackers you could have avoided the spanking. Dad, where's the meat? Stop hiding. Come out. Here, eat this. Dad, what exactly do you do? Do you make firecrackers? Of course not. Then what do you do? I'm a... I'm a poet. My job is to write poems in the sky. How do you write poems in the sky? That's a secret. Children aren't allowed to know. I don't care what you do, as long as you're not making firecrackers. Of course I'm not making firecrackers. If Big Brother asks again whether or not we could die, what do we tell him? Just tell the truth. No, that's too cruel. I don't think he will take it well. But, how can we avoid the topic? Accidents happen. From the first day of our research on solid fuels, since we knew that China was developing from scratch, and that it would take trial and error, we've already understood. What are you writing? A poem. A poem, you? I told our son I'm a poet. Let me read it. It's not finished yet. I'll show you when it's done. Just a quick look! If you're not working late today, go to the village, see if you can buy some meat. Buy meat? To satisfy our children's cravings. I've been craving meat for a long time. Then get more. Wait. The poem I wrote, see if you like it. Brother, I'm scared. Don't be. Get up. Shredded meat! Go ahead. It's delicious! Where did we get the meat? A gift from your father's co-worker. Where's Dad? Where did you two go last night? I will save a piece for Dad. Where did you go, you and Dad? We went to buy meat for you. Be quiet! I now call this meeting to order. I'll speak first. My dad hasn't come home in days. Mom told me he has to put in extra hours. I found it odd too. My dad hasn't come home either. My mom was crying. Maybe he will not come back. What does that mean? It means he's gone to heaven. So he won't come home. Stop catastrophizing, you wimp. You're ruining our meeting. Stop arguing. Rather than speculating here, we might as well go investigate. What do you say to that? - Okay, let's go. - Okay. Let's go. According to Comrade Shi Ruhong's report, prior to his death, plus the data analysis from this accident, we have established that the explosion happened in the engine head. The modified propellant formulation was not good enough. We need to run the test again. The heat insulation layer needs to be partially thickened. For our next test, we need to reduce the engine speed. All these could be major causes of an accident. Who are the comrades from the propellant trimming workshop? Do you think you could improve the trimming accuracy of the propellant surface to under 0.5 mm? Can you do that? Comrade Yu Kaiying. Didn't I tell you to take some time off? I can improve the accuracy to 0.2 mm. Where are you hiding? Show yourself. - Why are you crouching? - Stand up. What are you all doing in the factory? Looking for my dad. Me too. What's your father's name? Zhang Xiaoping. And yours? My father's name... What's my father's name? His father's name is Big Dummy. What are you laughing at? Stand still. Speak when spoken to You... What's your father's name? Shi Ruhong. Come again? Shi Ruhong. Stop going to there to look for your father. He doesn't work there anymore. Then where is he? What exactly does he do? There's a thing called a Kongming Lantern. You light a candle in the middle, and the heated air inflates the lantern. Then it can fly. That's what your father makes. But... He makes something much much bigger. Many times more impressive. And it can lift very heavy objects up into the sky. That's how he writes his poems. He promised to write one for me. This is the poem I wrote. See if you like it. See you tonight. See you tonight. Comrades. Three months from now, the solid propellant engine we are responsible for making will be needed for a docking test with the rest of the rocket. Three months to go, comrades. Gauge the propellant. 0.8 mm, Master. This is a tough battle. But, when we succeed, we will have our satellite in space. 0.6 mm. Here's the poem your father wrote for you. Just one line. 0.4 mm. Here's another poem your father wrote for you. Get up. It's raining. Don't just stand there! Close the window now! They said there would be heavy rain, those of us on overtime were told to return home! Dad! Mom! Brother! Dad is back. Where is he? These houses can't withstand heavy rain! Dad! Mom! Everyone please stay calm! Don't panic! They are sending people over to help! Dad. - Are you two ok? - Mom, what took you so long? I was scared. - I'm here now. - Where's Dad? Don't be afraid. Come here. Stay here. Okay. Where's dad? Your dad is working late. Hey! - Where are you going? - Mom, don't leave me. I'm not leaving. Don't cry. - Point the light in mom's direction. - Okay. Is my father dead? Come inside. Close the door. I won't come in until you tell me. We will talk inside. Tell me quickly! Don't stand in the rain! - Why won't you tell me? - Come inside. We will talk inside. What can't you tell me? I've been going house to house. All their fathers are back. Except mine. Is he dead? Yes, your father is dead. You're lying. My father isn't dead. I want my father. I'm your father now. My father is a man, and you are a woman. I can do what your father did. My father writes poems. You can't. Forget about poems. We need to battle. My father can howl like a wolf. Can you? My father spanks me. You've never spanked me. Don't make me. Hit me then. I don't hit you, huh? What about now? It doesn't hurt. - It doesn't hurt. - Don't you talk back to me. Mom, stop hitting. I didn't hit you because I didn't have the heart to. Has your father really hit you before? My father and my father before him. Are both dead. Mom, stop hitting. Mom, stop hitting. Mom, stop hitting. They're both dead. Does it hurt? You are late picking up your son today. What's the holdup? Long story. The test failed. We will try the new formulation tomorrow. I hope my son was not too much trouble? He's a sweet boy. Then I will take him home now. Maybe let him stay the night with us? He may keep you up. He already sleeps over all the time. I don't want to impose. It's not a bother. Plus, I'm counting on your son to take care of our little one in the future. Go home and get some rest. Okay. Good luck with tomorrow's test. I will take it. I have a favor to ask. Could you help me hide his death from the children? Especially Big Brother. It would devastate him. His biological father also died here. Starting today, could all the male comrades avoid going home? Tell your family that you're working overtime. Before the mission is complete, We... We must not let the children know that their father is gone. Master Are you alright, Master? Do you need a break? We don't have the time. The test is approaching. 0.2 mm. Give me the number one blade. Gauge it. Okay. Run! Are you on a hunger strike? There. The poem your father wrote for you. Now it's finished. My father didn't write it. Listen to me. You are turning ten next month. I want to start treating you as an adult. Let's talk like adults. Can we do that? Brother, can this really fly? I'll count down from three, and we will let go, okay? Okay. Three. Two. One. It's flying! Mom. Please don't die! Please don't die! It's possible that I could die too. You won't die. The thing that your father made is similar to this lantern. Both rely on the fire in the middle to fly to the heavens. My job is to make the fire. But it's a dangerous job. If something bad happens, I'll die too. You won't die. You never know. In case I die, would you regret still holding a grudge against your mother? In our family, you're now the man of the house. When Mom is not around, you have to look after your sister for me. Okay? I'm sorry, child. Your father and your mother may not be there to see you grow up. Comrades. This is our final test run. We won't get a second chance. Are we confident? Yes. Can we complete the mission? Yes, we can. Brother. If only Mom and Dad had lived to see this day, they would be incredibly proud. Their little girl who used to be afraid of everything, and now, she is an astronaut. When mom passed a few years ago, I made a wish. I wanted too, to go up there and write poems. Comrade Commander-in-Chief, Astronaut Shi Tiannuo reporting for duty for this manned mission. We're all set. Waiting for instructions. Manned spacecraft Shenzhou has entered the countdown phase. Astronaut Shi Tiannuo is about to embark on her first trip to space. My children. If I could, I would tell you all the mysteries of this world. I would tell you about our great mountains and rivers. About the rising sun and setting moon. Our honor and dreams, frustrations and sorrows. I would tell you, in making fuel, we light up ourselves to illuminate the dreams of others. In making rockets we give up what is ours, to achieve a collective vision. Life is to be used for a cause. Death is affirmation of life The vast universe makes our death so insignificant. Tiny dust particles are the beginning of the universe. Our small steps today are the beginnings of greatness. And you, my children, give us, ordinary as we are, the will to begin creating a beautiful new world. My Father My father's name is Zhao Pingyang. He's got a big head and a chubby body. Ever since I was little, people have said my father disregards his responsibilities and always tries to find the easy way out. But I disagree. My father is good at learning new things and has great computation skills. A sofa in the furniture store costs? 95.7. My father thinks that's too expensive, so he spent? 0.31 on a carpentry book and drew up blueprints himself. Then he spent? 8.5 on some scrap wood and built a new sofa. But then he ran into yet another problem. While moving upstairs the sofa got stuck in the stairwell. Others said his efforts were wasted but my dad faced the challenge head-on and came up with a brilliant idea. Lift! Up, up! He made a pulley and successfully hoisted the sofa upstairs. Let's go. Watch out. The sofa fit perfectly in our house. My mom was particularly satisfied. What is this? The zig zag bridge at City God Temple? Are you doing puzzles here? In the end the fabric, the springs and the tools cost? 31.06 in total. My dad said that by building this sofa he basically earned? 64.64. My dad is also warm-hearted towards the neighbors and approaches comrades with enthusiasm. My neighbors fought over splitting water bills. So my dad installed individual water meters for each family. The monthly water bill was reduced by? 0.72. The installation cost was earned back in just a year and a half, which the neighbors were happy to pay. And they even praised my dad as a central figure in the realization of the four modernization developing strategies. My dad cares for the people. He took time out of his busy schedule to go to rural areas and visits farmers. After thorough research my dad decided to help them expand their product distribution channels. He was particularly supportive of the duck eggs selling in the production brigade. One kilogram of duck eggs costs? 1.5, and once transported to the city it is sold for? 1.9. 15 kilograms each time, minus 10 % in incidental fees, and he could earn? 5.4. The other day my dad was appointed by his factory to attend the Canton Fair. Unintimidated by neither hardship nor fatigue. He brought back 40 cute tropical fish from Guangzhou, which greatly enriched Uncle Jiang's life after retirement. My dad spent? 0.2 on each fish, which he sold for? 0.5 to Uncle Jiang. Subtracting? 1.7 for the fish tank and? 0.05 the tube, this time my dad earned another? 10.25. My dad is also strict with himself and never wastes money. It takes? 0.04 to make a three-minute call on a public telephone. He keeps an eye on his watch every time he makes a call and hangs up the phone at exactly two minutes and fifty-nine seconds, refusing to spend an extra? 0.04. Hello Six Seven Eight And so because of all these virtues, my dad has become the most pupolar person in our neighborhood. He has told everyone that in the future there will be phones without cords, trains without wheels, bridges over the Huangpu River, and skyscrapers in Pudong. Some of the neighbors don't believe him and say he's speaking nonsense. There is a saying The duck is a prophet of spring when the river becomes warm. The duck what? The duck prophet. I see. So you are this duck. And so from that day on, my dad was given a nickname The duck prophet The duck prophet is coming back. Through his hard work, my family has? 386.5 in savings now. My dad was also appointed as the sales manager at the 2nd Traditional Pharmaceutical Factory. Their product sales have since continuously reached record-breaking highs. I must learn from my dad and train myself to be a useful person to the people. Zhao Xiaodong's essay is lively and vivid, which is something worth learning from. Ms. Qian, He's bragging! We're neighbors. Since his dad was appointed as sales manager, the company's medicinal wine hasn't been selling well at all. If you don't believe me, just go to his house and look. His entire house is packed with medicinal wine. His dad has spent all their money - on buying the medicinal wine - Stop it and their savings dropped into the negatives a long time ago. His dad was also kicked out of their house by his mom. Go live in your father's house or else we get a divorce. And now they're about to divorce. It's not true. You're lying. Do you know who his father is? Who is he? There used to be a man who always sold duck eggs in front of our school gate. And that man is his father. Embarrassed by his father, Dongdong avoided him every day after school. I can pay for it, all right? Duck prophet! Yes! Duck prophet! Stop it! Be quiet! Put it down! Mr. Zhao, I can understand that kids often put their parents on a pedestal in essays. But what kind of person would you like Dongdong to be? You can't let him solely pursue materialistic goals. He must also have spiritual pursuits. You need to encourage him to be more like Chen Jingrun, someone who makes significant contributions to our country even without sitting on a couch. I never prevented him from becoming more like Chen Jingrun. Then what's the deal with all the wine at your house? This Ginseng Longan Wine is produced by our factory - The 2nd Traditional Pharmaceutical Factory. It's made from a traditional recipe with real ingredients. But I'd like to sell it in an untraditional way. Comrade Duck Prophet, as a sales manager at a state-owned factory, please don't focus your attention on such crooked methods. All the students are laughing at Dongdong now. Go home and do some self-reflection. Put it in the bag. That's Dongdong and his dad. Dongdong and his dad. Isn't that the Duck Prophet? Dongdong, come here. Dongdong. Hurry up, Dongdong! Hurry! Dongdong, come up quickly. - Don't push. It's overcrowded already. - Dongdong, hurry up. - Just get off. - Make some room. Come on, come on. - Dongdong. Dongdong, hurry up. - Get off. Dongdong. What's wrong? Are you upset with me? Did I embarrass you? Yes, you did. I'll behave better next time and try to make you proud. When is next time? Next time is just next time. Mom. Let me do it. Honey I'm so grateful for you. Why did he bring you home today? I passed by the school today, so I picked him up and brought him home. Honey. This is your favorite dessert. - I'm not going back tonight. - Cut it out. You and your horrible wine get out of this house together and go to your dad's. What you just said isn't objective. This wine is at the very least made from a traditional recipe, with real ingredients. How could it be horrible? Plus, we already bought a sewing machine, which means our life is pretty good. How dare you say that? Are you out of your mind? If you hadn't promised to sell thousands of bottle of wine in a year, would your factory have overstocked so much wine? And as if that wasn't enough, you continued to bite off more than you can chew. As you know, this house wasn't big to begin with, but now we have got neither money nor space. I went to No.1 Food store on Nanjing road today and convinced them to sell our wine from next month on. The distribution channel is alreadu opened. Just keep bragging! Do you think I'll still believe in you? Let me tell you, Zhao Pingyang. This is my last warning. You must get rid of this terrible wine within a month. Either you drink it all or pour it into the Huangpu River. Does it taste good? Don't worry. It's fine. Your mom has more bark than bite. Are you sure you can sell all the wine? Are you bragging again? How come you don't believe me either? I've already come up with a solution. But to implement this solution, I need you to do me a favor. What is it? Little Fatty. Did you expose Dongdong in school today? Who told you my wine is not selling well? It's... My dad. I knew it was him. I'm running around every day doing actual things, while your dad just smokes, drinks tea and reads the newspaper all day in the office. He's in no position to criticize me. If I sell all the wine within a month, you must apologize to Dongdong. Otherwise I'll cut your big ears off and have them with my wine. Little Fatty's big ears are getting even bigger. It's a sign of good luck. Didn't I tell you to go home and finish your homework? Then why are you still here? Go home. Kicked out by your wife? Absence makes the heart grow fonder. What do you know? You remember the lines, right? Suppose your mom and I actually get a divorce, what would you do? Would you choose your mom or me? Mom. Listen, we're not going to get a divorce. Don't sulk. You must work with me after getting on the bus. Did you hear me? Oh my gosh! Buddy. Please don't knock over my medicinal wine. Mister, mister. Are you holding the Ginseng Longan Wine? Yes. It is. How did you know? My grandpa is very fond of it. He said there is longan, Yu zhu and ginseng in it. With real ingredients, it not only boosts vitality and nourishes blood, promotes fluid production and benefits the lungs, but also relax muscles and improves eyesight. Since he's begun to drink this wine, my grandpa has been eating well, sleeping well, glowing with health and jumping high, as if he's suddenly ten years younger. Really? Then you should definitely tell your grandpa to drink more of this wine. Where did you get this? How much did it cost? The usual price is? 30. But I know someone from the factory so I got it for only? 18 Then if my grandpa buys it from you, could you make it a bit cheaper so he can buy a bottle too? In that case I'll be bankrupt! But on behalf of the admirable care you give your grandpa, I'll make it? 16 for you. Wow, that's a steal. Then my grandpa must buy more. Treasure! What a Treasure! Longan, Yu zhu, Ginseng, with real ingredients. If my grandpa wants to buy from you, please just sell him a bottle. Relaxes the muscles and improves eyesight. Mister, please sell it to me. I need replenishment too. - Boosts vitality and nourishes blood, - promotes fluid production and benefits the lungs. Mister I'm begging you to sell me this. Mister. You are a living Lei Feng, sacrificing yourself for others. Our whole family will remember your kindness forever. Oh my gosh! Is this the legendary Ginseng Longan Wine? Eat well. Sleep well. Jump high. Leap far. Glow with health. Jump high. Do you want some? No. Mister, I must criticize you. Don't you think it's very selfish of you to not sell me any of the wine? Honey, should we buy two bottles of the wine for your dad? It's too expensive. It will make your dad happy, which means you won't beat me again. I'll take two bottles. Duck Prophet. I've been watching you for quite a while. When was your son adopted by others? How did I not know? I can't believe you called him mister. Why don't you call him comrade? Comrade, please don't be fooled. This guy is the sales manager at a pharmaceutical factory. And this boy is his son. What they're trying to sell is in very low demand. It's not! There's nothing wrong with the quality. Nonsense. We have everything we need, right? Yes. Comrades, are you working for the Shanghai TV Station? Are you doing news reporting? We're going to film the retirement home for the Double Ninth Festival. What a coincidence! I work for the 2nd Traditional Pharmaceutical Factory. We're also going to visit the elderly at their retirement home for the Double Ninth Festival. Could you film our visit as well? Sure. Cut. Good. You done? Done. Director, could you film one more shot of me opening the bottle and the elderly drinking the wine and their satisfied smiles? No. No. This is not how we do news reports. Then could you take one more close-up shot and make sure our brand logo is big and clear? Close-up? Do you have any idea how much it costs for a 10-second shot? How much? Enough to buy 25 kilos of pork belly. Our factory can pay for it. It's not something you can just pay for. We are not making an advertisement for you. Advertisement? What is an advertisement? Mr. Feng, the elderly performing Tai Chi are ready. Young Comrade, what is an advertisement? An advertisement is a very short film broadcasted on TV, aimed at promoting and selling products. That's great! It suits us. Can we film an advertisement? We don't have that in China only abroad. Our TV station never broadcasts ads. Never before but never in the future either? I'm not sure. But there are articles about this in the paper and our leaders are discussing it too. Well how about if I hire you to make an advertisement, would you do it? I could. But you'll have to pay for it. Either way Mr. Feng won't agree to it. I'm not asking Feng. I'm asking you. May I have your name please? You can call me Xiao Ma. Director Ma. Advertisement? Do you know anyone who's made an advertisement before? I've talked about it to a senior staff at the TV station. According to reliable sources, it's probable that they'll start broadcasting ads soon. We must seize this opportunity. It could be the first TV advertisement in China. Manager Zhao, I have a TV set in my house which I watch everyday. But I have never seen anything like you described. Do you think I'm stupid enough to pay for something I've never seen before? It won't cost very much. Stop talking. We now have an abundance of wine in stock just because I believed in what you have said. Please think about some practical solutions. Don't shoot for the moon. Do you drink this wine? I don't drink wine. Do you think I can drink it all? Do you know what an advertisement is? What is it? You don't even know what an advertisement is. Dongdong, please listen to me. Your mom has demanded that I sell all the wine within a month, right? There are only 15 days left as of today. So you have to help me get the key to the wooden chest, and take out the household registration booklet inside, in case your mom is going to divorce me in a rage. I don't think you actually want the household registration booklet. You just want me to steal my mom's money for your advertisement. My boy is smart indeed. It's not stealing but simply borrowing your mom's money to make an ad. When the advertisement is done, our family will also be secured. Dongdong. Dongdong. This is the only money we have left. Mom will definitely divorce you once she finds out. I know. Do you remember what I said before The duck is a prophet of spring when the river becomes warm. It is only because the duck isn't afraid to go into the river that it is able to feel when the water becomes warm and able to capture fish. Always be the first duck brave enough to jump into the river. But I feel we're already in the river. Right, Then do you dare to be a brave duck? Yes. My good boy. Mom, give me the key. Where's yours? I left it home. Why didn't you leave yourself home? Finish your homework first and don't mess around. OK. Today is my first date with Zhao. He's a good guy. It's the happiest day in my life. Have another pork chop. I've already figured out the story. A minute and a half in total. The story will be about a family of three that goes to a store to buy the Ginseng Longan Wine as a gift for their grandpa, who is very satisfied after drinking the wine. Manager Zhao, thank you for the noodles. But this is very difficult. You asked for money which I got now. Even if I could get a hold of the camera by using news reporting as an excuse, what about the film negatives? It requires four leaders' signatures to get the negatives. Then we'll buy some. Have you seen a store that sells film negatives? It's not something you can just buy. Without a letter of introduction, you can't even hire actors or book filming locations. Just forget it. Xiao Ma, Director Ma. We had a deal. You can't just give up now. Come on, think about it. If the advertisement is well filmed, then you would be the first TV ad director in all of China. The first one. The progenitor. The founder. I'll take care of the film negatives and the actors. You just let me know what your requests are for the filming location. It should be a place with grandeur. Yes. Style. Yes. And a feeling of natural and harmonious. Then we can do it in my house. Waiter, another bowl of noodles please. Got it. The unexposed head of negative reels are supposed to be discarded, but I think it's quite a waste, so I've been keeping them for years. Luckily, they're long enough for your short film. They're already spliced together. Here you go. Thank you. How dare you come here? The fish you have sold me last time turned upside down within a few days. Not even. They died on the night we bought them. Give my? 20 back. I will give you? 30 and you can keep the change. Just do me a favor. Look. You'll have the opportunity to be on the cover. I've already told you Zhao Pingyang. I've never thought about becoming an actress. You're such a beautiful lady. It'd be a shame if you don't go into acting. You should come too, Xiao Mei. I'll make you a movie star. On your birthday we're going to film at the drugstore in the morning and at our house in the afternoon. What I'm sayning now is very crucial. You have to let your mom take you out to Nanjing Road and stay there for 6 hours. You can't come back home until the time is up It's all or nothing. This is called luring the enemy away from their base. What are you looking at? Nothing. Hurry up! Everyone must move quickly. We've only got 6 hours in total to film the rest of the shots. We must remember the original location of all the furniture and put everything back after we're done My wife must not spot any difference. Dongdong, it's your birthday today. I'll let you have anything you want. Mom. I want to have some pork mooncakes. Sure. The line is so long. Let's go. A long line means the mooncakes must be yummy. I want to have some pork mooncakes. If there's no line, then it's not yummy? Let's rehearse it first. Ready. Action! Father, this is a present for you. Ginseng Longan Wine. May you be healthy, live long and prosper. Cut. That's too pompous. Oh. Be lifelike. Oh. Be natural. Oh. Ok? I got it. Be more lifelike. Sorry. Right. Let's do a first take. Rolling. Action! Dad, This Gingan Lonseng Wine is for you. Sorry I mispronounced words. Cut. Why did you look at the camera? I'm sorry. Don't be nervous. You make mistakes more easily when nervous. Take a deep breath. Adjust my relaxing. No. Adjust my breathing. Just relax. Rolling. Action! Dad, This is a father for you. Don't buy this. Let's go. Mom, I'm still hungry. I'm exhausted. Stop eating. Mom, I'd also like to go to the cinema. Which film do you want to watch? Manhunt. You've already seen it six times with your dad. Then I want to see Mistress Xiang Lin. Do you have any idea who she is? I think She looks like my grandma. Let's go. Your grandma? Dongdong. Watch the car. Cut. This shot is done. Let's do a close-up. Move the light. Director, how many shots are left? Quite a few. Come on. Be quick. Mom, I'd like to watch the film again. Why do you like this film so much? Let's go home. Let's go. What's wrong? What's wrong? Mom, I have a stomachache. Where? Here? Yes. Look at you! You ate so much it's no surprise you have a stomachache. Does it hurt here? Yes, it does. Take it easy. What about here? Yes. It's quite serious. You'll need a few acupuncture treatments. Acupuncture. Mom, I suddenly feel fine. What's the matter with you? That's weird. Oh well I just farted. That is weird. The light is too dim now. Change it to a brighter light. Quickly. I think it's fine. No. It's not. We're running out of time. Little Fatty is coming back soon. We don't have much time. Let's start. You are so annoying. Absence makes the heart grow fonder everyday. Boosts vitality. Nourishes blood. A good wine. Good. Cut. This shot is done. Now let's take the last shot. Great. My wife is sick in bed. Are you guys setting up this search... setting up this searchlight to illuminate her? That's despicable. Stop what you're doing. Sorry. Mr.Fatty. We're making a film. That's none of my business. But you must not disturb your neighbors. And we're neighbors. Please don't be upset. Cut the nonsense! It really doesn't hurt? No. Little Fatty, Why are you sitting here? Dongdong, My parents didn't let me stay home. Can I go to your house to watch the film being shot? What film? What's going on? Fake! Even the vase is fake. You filmmakers always deceive audience with fake things. Shame on you. Shame on you. Mr. Fatty. Calm down. Please don't be mad. Stop talking! I won't allow you to continue filming today. Just give me five minutes for the last shot. I won't even give you one second. Stop filming! I won't allow it! You can wait for the sun. Mr. Fatty! Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Mr. Fatty, I bought this blanket when Zhao and I got married. I've never used it. Are you satisfied now? Can you please give him five minutes to finish filming? Can you? Put the flowers in the vase. I have something else to do. Then let's continue filming. Back to your positions. Then we'll follow your instructions. Xiao Ma. President. I heard that you've made an ad? Yes. Our TV station has been thinking about launching an advertising business. Show me your ad. Yes, okay. President, do we need to report this to the leaders and ask what they think before we proceed? Just in case. I'm afraid we might be accused of making mistakes regarding principle. What mistakes? It already passed the conference vote to expand enterprise production, increase economic efficiency, and improve people's living standards. Those are the biggest principles. Don't worry. I'll take responsibility if anything bad happens. I'll fetch it for you. OK. Don't try to fool me. I've made films before too. Dear audience, today is Sunday 28th of January 1979, the first day of the first lunar month. The following is the main content of the news program Today is the 37th day after the closing of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Cadres and masses from all walks of life organized spontaneously to study the Communiqu? Of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Tell Dongdong to stop watching TV. He sits there waiting for the ad everyday. Dongdong, stop watching TV. This wine won't sell well anyway. I'll take two bottles to your grandpa's to celebrate the New Year. When will the ad be broadcasted? Probably never. I have no idea. Do you think I'm useless? Next time you write an essay, feel free to write whatever you want about me, all right? Are you ready? Let's go. Put on your sweater. OK. Turn off the TV, Dongdong. Zhao Pingyang, grab a few more bottles of wine for you dad. Don't waste good wine. Dad, mom, come and watch the ad. Come. Where? Dad, this present is for you. Ginseng Longan Wine. May you be healthy, live long and prosper. Ginseng Longan Wine. Boosts vitality. Nourishes blood. A good wine for family and friends. Give Ginseng Longan Wine as a present. This Ginseng Longan Wine is really hard to get. It's so hard to buy this wine. It's so hard to buy. Good product. Be quick. I told you it's hard to get. Over there. Hurry up. Hello comrade. How's this wine been selling today? Very well. Almost sold out. Usually just few people purchase it. But for some reason, today everyone's here to buy it. That's because of its traditional recipe and real ingredients. That's true. I remember now, something my dad once said to me. Dongdong, I believe that you'll become a successful person one day. But it's at this momment that I can finally believe what my dad said was true. My father was perhaps indeed a duck prophet. Dad, this present is for you. Ginseng Longan Wine. May you be healthy, live long and prosper. Ginseng Longan Wine. Boosts vitality. Nourishes blood. A good wine for family and friends. Give Ginseng Longan Wine as a present. Since then advertisements have reached every family in China and have become a part of our lives. My dad was not only the first advertiser in China, but also one of the first people who bought stocks, used mobile phones, and bought commodity housing in Pudong. What others regarded as his daydreams turned out all to be true. Many said my dad was the duck prophet, a miraclulous man, able to predict the future. I only finally understood when I grew up that he is not the miracle, but ourselves. Later, I became an engineer. In 2016 I led my team to build the tallest building in China: Shanghai Tower. There are 285 commercial buildings in Lujiazui with 43,000 companies inside. Our generation is also creating a new world full of hope. A bright new world. Son. What are you writing? What's the height of the Shanghai Tower that you designed? 632 meters. Is it the tallest in China? It's the second tallest in the world. Why are you writing it down? For my essay. The title is My Father. Dad, mom, are you looking through the binoculars again? Your dad has looked over 100 times. That red roof used to be our old house. I know. I found it a long time ago. Well, this building you designed is absolutely amazing. Like I said before, The duck is a prophet of spring when the river becomes warm. Always be The first duck that dares to jump into the river. That's right I'm sorry! I will never do that again. Where has gone the hot water? Mom, it was my fault. Where has gone the hot water? I was half way in my shower when the hot water ran out. How dare you to take apart the water heater, huh? Sorry. The fan The hair dryer The vacuum cleaner Besides, What are these? I was wondering why all the appliances in our house keep breaking and breaking after repairs. Now I see. If there is one thing in this house to be fixed, that is you. Kid, say goodbye to your plane. You are not taking apart the appliances; you are tearing our mother-son relationship apart. Mom. The ceiling light fell off by itself. I didn't do anything! As if it doesn't want to live, like the way you don't. Listen, let me explain. For a static object, if an external force is greater than the friction, it naturally moves. And that external force might be the gravity or some unknown, mysterious force. The force is neither unknown nor mysterious. Let me show you. Aren't you familiar? Is this the force you are referring to? Is it mysterious? The ball is mine. Yours? Can you guys keep down your construction noise? It shook off our ceiling light. My mom thought I did it. See the works of her spank. Generally speaking, mothers spank for guiding ways. Then, can you see the ways my mother is guiding? Your mother lost her way. Forget about it You should apologize right now. Your mother spanked you. You should tell your mother to apologize. Give back the ball. Xiaoxiao, stop dragging your feet. You are getting late for school. Don't think about getting your ball back. Fanfan, the teacher said that Empress Dowager Cixi was buried with a priceless jewel in her mouth, the luminous pearl. Yeah, so? It is right here. Didn't the teacher say that it was lost long time ago in some foreign countries? You know, my dad is a special agent, and he brought it back. If you like it, I don't mind if you play it for some days. You, big liar! Come, everybody. Xiaoxiao said this luminous pearl belonged to Empress Dowager Cixi. Empress Dowager Cixi? Must be a fake. Getting things from Empress Dowager Cixi, your dad must be an imperial eunuch. Rebound. Your dad is an imperial eunuch. Bounce back. Your dad is an eunuch. Xiaoxiao's dad is a special agent. Don't believe him. Few days ago, he just said his dad is Yao Ming's coach. Don't believe a word of it. Isn't his dad an astronaut? He changed his job because of acrophobia? I still keep some lunar soil that Xiaoxiao gave me. He said his dad's a scientist. Why haven't you inherited from him? Are you the real son of your dad? Wang Mingtu. I've been putting up with you for too long. I'm Jackie Chan! I'm Jet Li! Stop! Jackie Chan, sit down; Jet Li, go back to your seat! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out here! Looking for cars? Come on in. Come, sir. This way. You sure you want to bring in this guy? Remember, never judge a person's purchasing power by his looks. Get the swipe machine ready! Sir, Sir, the first time that I saw this car, I was as excited as you. You must be a pro. You first check the chassis when looking for cars. I know the chassis is awesome but we can't just keep staring at it. Here. The boss sits in the rear. Give it a try. Sir, we offer different types to fit you the best. Ranging from hundred thousands to millions yuan, our cars cover almost all purposes, whether it is for family, business or... Yes! That is the exact expression that I'm looking for. You perfectly illustrates the mind-blowing luxury experience that is beyond the description of words. This car, features the most advanced battery technologies in the world so far. It has the amazing charge efficiency. Indeed amazing. Why is it out of battery? Emm... Sorry, sir. This car might not have been charged. How about we switch a car? Sure. Let me open the door for you. What just happened was a pure accident. The battery in this car undoubtedly has strong cells, high charge rate, and wonderful capacity. Power-off? Why is it dead again? Where has the power gone? Tomorrow is the Parents' Day. You gonna have your mom come again? Your mom did nothing but cracking sunflower seeds. It will be nice if your dad could come. I wanna see your dad. Xiaoxiao, where are you going? Give me back the ball. Look, is he Xiaoxiao's dad? He looks like a homeless Can I hold your hand for a second? Like a homeless I will go with my dad. Wow, you found my school. Here's the ball. What's wrong? Water... Water... Not waterproof. What's wrong with you? Tell me, quick. Freeze. I know you are a robot, and you are not waterproof. Let me ask you. Robots should look like me. You look way too human. Double chin, potbelly, what are these for? The adipose layer cushions the body and protects core parts. What is this? Why do you want it back so badly? Are you grilling me? No, I'm helping to dry you. I want to save you. Only by using it can I go back to 2050. You came from 2050? Scientists are performing a time travel experiment on me. What is it like in 2050? Are there more people or more robots on streets? Can cars fly? What energy sources are used? I don't know either. I was just off from production line and they brought me here. What are you advanced robots able to do? Don't harm me. And I won't harm you. Don't worry. I can't attack humans. You scared me to death. Why don't you tell me earlier? Wow. Here's the thing: Tomorrow is the Parents' Day. If you come with me, I will give you back the ball. How's that? Even my mom has never seen these. You made all these? Yep. My dad studies artificial intelligence, and I might get it from him. This will be the finale project for tomorrow. Can you help to take a look? How to make higher and further flights? I can't help, but I can take a look. You don't know my mom's temper. If she sees this plane, she will throw it away. Every day, she forced me to practice Mathematical Olympiad, English speaking, and ancient poems recital. All those naggings keep going on and on and on. My head is about to explode. Then, why haven't you? Mom. You can't hide a plane that big. Come here. Who's this? He is Xing Yihao. The blind date that Ms. Wang arranged for you. So, you are into cosplay. Which character are you? Son, go play. Mom, I... Play now or never. Let's chat. My bag, please. As you can see, I have been a mom and a dad for all these years. Every now and then, I'll have to handle some liquor. And I don't want him to see. So I thought about hanging out here till I am sober. Now that he has grown up, and the hardest time has passed. Please go and tell Ms. Wang that don't arrange blind dates for me anymore. Besides, a man of this quality is definitely not my thing. What happened to his father? Ms. Wang has not told you about that? They clicked? His dad studies artificial intelligence. He always says, To make dreams come true, you will have to go through failures thousands of times. Five thousand times of failures will carve out his great technological product. However it turned out that only after the fifth try, he passed away. I'm sorry for your loss. He was gone too soon. The boy got it from his dad, fiddling with all these. I was just afraid if he fell behind his school work, and still he is not cut out for that. His dad's dream is to enable machines to learn autonomously. But you are turning you child into a machine that can do nothing but study. Fly higher. Indeed. I can't let my son live in good times but without a good mom. Alright. Hang in there. I'll go home. Ma Daiyu. Two more rounds? Nope, I'm sober now. Boy, let's go home. Take the plane Ok I wish you could come tomorrow. When you enter the school later, try to be cool, OK? Absolutely Look at that! Roasting under this big summer sun, he wears layers without sweating. How frail. He is cosplaying Leon With that speed, I could hit the target before he knows it. Mom. Oh my boy. I was heavy-handed Do not tell your dad about this. Ah, my boy Please stay there, I will come downstairs. Fretting? If I walk like this, you fret, right? Move quickly, or the Parents' Day would be over soon. You already are the center of attention for kids. You don't need to dress up this formal. Though it's the first time we meet, I have already heard a lot about you. You have been through so much hardships these years; I taught them about going to moon, you brought back the lunar soil; I taught them about Cixi, you brought back the luminous pearl; Have you been in contact with the aliens recently? Despite all the hustle-and-bustle, remember to spend more time with your kid. Come on! Come and defense me. Come on, Yao Ming's coach. Three shots in a row. Three shots in a row, can you? Excuse me. Let me introduce myself. I was a former second-level athlete. Sorry for you Come, show around. My dad was a foregone second-level athlete. My dad was a foregone second-level athlete. Come on. Can you do that? Go for it. Have a try There, there. Follow me. Pose like this, Yao Ming's coach. Dad, you scored! You scored! Dad, you scored! Dad. My dad scored! Xiaoxiao's dad is amazing. My dad won! My dad scored! Dad, try another one. I want to eat dumplings. Here. Come on, come on Dad, I'm hungry I'm hungry Dad I'm hungry I am truly hungry It's not yet lunch time. Dad, I'm hungry Ready? We are coming last in the race. Try harder. Wouldn't it be too fast if I do? As long as we race fast. Cheeky wins. Speed up. Straight up your waist. Go, Xiaoxiao! Xiaoxiao! Go, Xiaoxiao! I won! I won! Why don't you smile? I don't know how. I will show you, like this. Teacher, I applied principles of aerodynamics to make a glider. How impressive, Yihang. I'm so proud of you. Thank you for your encouragement. Teacher, I got inspired for making this plane because my dad irons my mom's clothes. No, the opposite. It is powered by steam to provide perpetual fuel. Teacher, cleared for departure. Departure approved. Dad, the power is gone. What can help it fly? Damn, your dad. It's a bionic plane. How wonderful, Weiwei. You see, in science, we must keep our integrity. Although there were ups and downs, you got to advance forward. Understand? I'm sorry, Weiwei's dad. What a coincidence. Mine is bionic too. Yours is not bionic. Yours is bio-release. Bionics eat this? I intended to buy this pigeon to simulate a bionic plane. I didn't expect this. I was simple minded. Time is so limited that I just made a remote control. Go, Da Cheng. Alright. Xiaoxiao, can your stuff fly or not? Yours are just toys. Mine is a real plane. It hovers vertically like an helicopter, and speeds up like a fixed-wing aircraft. Teacher, it combines the merits of both types, and is forged as a new type of aircraft. It's on fire! Don't gather around. Turn off, please Don't gather around. Xiaoxiao's father, please take the kids away It caught fire. The plane was shot down. My plane flew nicely last night. My dad was there too! If you don't believe, ask him. Surely your dad speaks for you. Last night, I didn't actually see that. I couldn't take my eyes off your mother. Even if it flew last night, it fails to do so now, proving that it's just not good enough. You failed. It failed to fly. Why are you here? I brought back the airplane for you. I don't need it. To make dreams come true, you will have to go through failures thousands of times. Five thousand times of failures make a great product like me. You should follow your father's path to move forward. How can you give up your dream after only one failure? At least your dad tried five times. Who gave up dreams? I gave up on you. You could have vouched for me. But, instead, you didn't trust me on one hand, and accused me in front of the crowds on the other. My dad would never do that. Since he's gone, I think about him every day. The reason I did all of these is to figure out why his study is so important for him, even leaving my mom and me behind. Ever since I met you, I thought my dad was back. But I was wrong. You are a cold-blood machine. You don't have feelings at all. Go away. You don't deserve to be my dad. Xing Yihao Xing Yihao Xing Yihao Somebody help! Help! Help me drag him up here! Aren't you leaving? Who told you to come back? Last time I missed the plane's flight. I want to see it before leaving. Did you see it then? I saw... I saw you paddling in the water. It's time for me to go. Please don't go. Could you stay and be my dad? Just between you and me. I'll protect you. I will never let you get close to water. I have to go back to prove that the experiment is a success. But I don't want you to go. If you really need to go, can you take me with you? I will go home right now and pack my stuff, and bring my mom too. If I stay any longer, I will never be able to go. I'm sorry. I missed this time again. But I'm sure it did take off. Xiaoxiao, You can! Could you please stay? Xiaoxiao, help me put it in. Look at this. You guys made him travel to the past. Thus we see the future. I'm here to announce, the first time-travel experiment by mankind was a complete success. Nice to meet you again. Thank you for giving me an unique childhood memory, dad. YOU made me. YOU are my dad. Wow, what a big hand-made rocket! That's my son. Which one? That one. Ready to go? Yes! Go, my boy! Don't hurry. Son, take your time., Madeleine? You want to eat again? You eat too much because you're depressed. Madeleine! Yes? Madeleine! Yes, mama? I'm thirsty, my angel. I'm coming. - Do you want your medicine? - Yes, my darling. Do you want to play a game?

You can't help looking over your shoulder. - What? - No one is coming. I wasn't looking over my shoulder. - Yes, you were. - No. Are we gonna have a row about this? What are they burning? Secrets. Wishes. Letting go of the past. Getting rid of old things, in come the new. Where did you go to? Today, by the water. Hmm? Tell me. I'll tell you if you tell me about Vesper. Is that why we're here? She's buried at the acropolis. I know where she's buried. Can you forgive her? For us? I left her behind a long time ago. As long as we're looking over our shoulder, the past is not dead. You have to let her go, even if it's hard. You mean, um, if we're to have a future? Mm-hmm. So, I do this, and then... I'll tell you all my secrets. Okay. I'm going to go and do this, and then I'm going to come back for breakfast. Thank you. And then you're going to tell me where we're going next. Home. I miss you. What... Madeleine? Madeleine? Blofeld sends his regards. You know... Madeleine, she is a daughter of Spectre. She's a daughter of Spectre. Your baggage is already down, Mr. Bond. As your wife requested. You were right. Letting go is hard. James. What happened? - What happened? - How did they know I was here? - What are you talking about? - Madeleine, how did they know I was here? - I have no idea what you're... - Spectre. How did they know? What are you talking about? James! I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. We're leaving. There is something I need to tell you. I bet there is. James! Pick it up. Pick it up! It's Blofeld, my love. Your father would be so proud of you. Your sacrifice will be our glory. - I don't understand. - Bravo. - Hello. - Let the sheep out, kid. - Why? - Because otherwise I'll kill you. James, why? Why would I betray you? We all have our secrets, we just didn't get to yours yet. James. James, listen to me. I'd rather die than you think I'm... James! James! Do something. James! Say something, James! Please. Okay.

I... I put it in the bloody... Valdo, you haven't seen a tub of smallpox, have you? This was a good soup. Now it is waste, even if it is joke. There is more complexity in my tomato soup than in both of your brains combined. Valdo, that is so unkind. It's so... One day I will put Ebola in your tea. And then I will watch as your faces sweat blood... ...and I will be laughing. - Nice. Keep your hair on. - Wow. He's got a terrifying imagination, hasn't he? Dr. Obruchev. They are coming. - Who? - Spectre. - Safin. - Do not try to stop them. This is what we've been waiting for. They will ask you to enter Bio Security Level Four fridge and remove the weapon. No one must see what you are doing. They will not kill you. They think they need you. They will not kill me? Transferring the files as we speak. Now... Now it's done. What do I do with it?

Open the Bio Security Level Four fridge. - And, uh... - Give me the weapon. The weap... What weapon? We have, uh... Heracles. It requires double authentication. Which one? Him. Hardy. Hardy! Don't let them. Don't let them. Don't let them, please. Oh. Warning, facility lockdown in progress. All exits are now sealed. Warning, facility lockdown in progress. All exits are now sealed. Oh, what is, uh... It's a safety belt? This? Wow. I... I cannot! There is no elevator! Magnets. Sir, I've just received the most unusual... I've seen it. Oh, Jesus Christ. Sir, what's the Heracles project? This lab isn't on the books. No, it's not. - There were casualties. - It was a gas leak. Shall I alert the PM? It was a gas leak. I'll handle it. Moneypenny. Where's 007? Well, isn't this a surprise, Felix? James. Who's the blond? Logan Ash, State Department. It's really nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. I mean, I'm a huge fan. - Babylon. - Police boy. I need a favor, brother. You didn't get the memo? I'm retired. I wouldn't ask if you were still in Her Majesty's Service. And what does that mean? Our elected leaders aren't playing nice in the sandbox. James. Is there somewhere quiet where we can talk in private? Quiet? Yeah. I was hoping you could pick up a package. - Five. - Four. Where's the package? Short trip. Cuba. You love it there. Oh, I love it there? Hey. Valdo Obruchev. You're gonna say you never heard of him. - Never heard of him. Two. - Three. Ah... It's a good life. You never heard of him? Didn't he defect during your tenure at MI6? Obruchev was kidnapped three days ago from a secret MI6 lab in London. Two days ago, his mug pinged on a facial-recognition sweep in Santiago de Cuba. He's leaving out the best part. Spectre. I have a contact there, says they're gathering. Coincidence? Come on. It'll be like old times. - Three. - Two. You're really the only guy for the job. - You're the guy. - It's my round. Hi. - Scotch. - Yeah, man. Where'd you find the Book of Mormon? Political appointee. Not my choice. Seems intelligence isn't central anymore. He smiles too much. Help us get this into the right hands. Oh, what, and you're the right hands? I'm not just a pretty face. I stopped trusting pretty faces a long time ago, Felix. Yeah, I heard. Bad luck. - Bad judgment. - Yeah. Harder to tell the good from bad, villains from heroes these days. I need you, James. You're the only one I trust with this. I'm not screwing around. I wanna get back to my family, tell them I saved the world again. Don't you? Nice to see you again, Felix. - At least take my number. - I've got your number. In trouble? Constantly. Need a ride? Sure. Why not? Hold on. - What's your name? - Nomi. - Yours? - James. Call me James. - What do you do, Nomi? - I'm a diver. - What do you dive for? - I have a thing for old wrecks. Well, then you've come to the right place. After you. Hmm... Nice house. Thank you. Is that the bedroom? Yes, it is. Well, that's not the first thing I thought you'd take off, but, uh... Yeah. You seem like a man who's gagging - for some action, Mr. Bond. - Shall we cut to the chase? I'm here as a professional courtesy. Well, you're not very courteous, are you? You've broken my car... It's Commander Bond, but you know that. - Double-0? - Two years. - Very young. - High achiever. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - The world's moved on since you retired, Commander Bond. - Perhaps you didn't notice. - No, can't say I had. And in my humble opinion, the world doesn't change very much. You would say that. Look, this all seems like heaven, this little bubble, or whatever. But it's so obvious you're a man who only has time to kill, nothing to live for. So Valdo Obruchev is off-limits. You get in my way, I will put a bullet in your knee. The one that works. You need to ask yourself a few more questions. MI6, CIA chasing after the same man, not communicating with each other, that... - That's not good. - Hmm. You know what? Tell M hello, but... I don't work for him anymore. Tell him yourself. By the way, I'm not just any old double-0. I'm 007. You probably thought they'd retire it. It's just a number. Yeah. See you in Cuba? How's it going, Q? Several large files seem to have been wiped from Obruchev's hard drive. He was working on some pretty advanced algorithm... - Can you retrieve the files? - Trying. Get me everything you can and then destroy the drive. If I knew more about what this was, I could... Thank you, Q. That's all. Yes. One minute. The PM is calling again. Tell them something. Anything. - M, darling. Couple of things. - Bond. - I met your new 007. She's a disarming young woman. So, Obruchev. You kept him on the payroll, didn't you? Stay out of it. This has nothing to do with you. It does. It's Spectre. Mallory, what have you done? - Double-0 trouble? - The CIA have the advantage. Get me Blofeld. Sir, he only speaks to his psychiatrist. I know. The live feed's what I want. They stay straight in the middle. And then they bring him up. He's like this every day, mad as a bag of bees. - It's crowning day. - Good. - What is it? - It's nothing. It's clean as can be. Everyone just wants a party. Yeah, I want them both to hear me. Be a surprise. Felix, I'm in. He's in. There's a young lady in Santiago I want you to meet. Paloma? - You're late. Vamos. - I... Uh, something about a hat? Paris, uh... Huh? What hat? I forget things when I get nervous. This is the biggest job I've ever had. This your room? It's a wine cellar. Okay, come here. Don't you think we ought to get to know each other just a little bit before we, um... Oh... No, no, no, no. Um, no, I'm sorry. Um... - All right. - You do it. Thank you. Do you mind, uh... - This is gonna go brilliantly. - I know. I've done three weeks' training. Let's get a drink. Good idea. Two vodka martinis, shaken, not stirred. Si, senor. So I can hear you. What shall we drink to? - Felix? - To Felix. Remind me to get him a cigar. Vamos? - Sure. - Okay. Will this sample be enough for you? If he has used it, yes. It is now progressing. Oops. Sorry. Terrible, terrible gloves. So slippery. Forgive me. How much longer? A-ha. To happy new future for Spectre. Now, it is ready. You go that way. I'll go this way. What is this? Spectre bunga-bunga? You ever been to a party like this? How do you think I got this job? Don't get distracted, now. Remember, we're looking for our Russian scientist. I'm seeing a lot of Spectre agents. Yes. And it looks like all of them. Wow. Friend of yours? Cyclops. We ran into each other in Italy. That was an eye-opening experience. They're wearing earpieces. Scanning. It'll be clean. It's good. It's as good as can be. - It's my party. - Ah. Found it. Celebrate me, my birthday, my crowning day. Who's the birthday boy? Um... - Ernst Stavro Blofeld. - Is he here? No, he's... Make your way. Follow the music. He's in London in prison. How do you know for sure? Because I put him there. ...feel my warm embrace. Experience a delicious surprise. Let us shepherd humanity with our new power. I've spotted him, our little Russian scientist. - Have you got him? - I'm here. - I got him. - Stay with him. But I see you from my little eye, and my little eye says hi. Now, see, now, we emerge from the shadows as gods on Mount Olympus. Here's to the end of our pariah. Oh, my burden, my brother... James Bond. Goodbye, James. You're popular tonight. You can't run. It's too late. It's already crawling under your skin. Don't be alarmed, it's harmless to us. Just to him. So delicious. Sir! It is working. It is working. Only Spectre are dying. Hello. Are you for my, uh, esco... - Hmm? - No? Oh. Go! - Thank you. I'll take this. - No! - What was that? - Get him! Time to go. Let's go! It's clear. May I cut in? Go get him. I'll hold them off. Cover the exits! Paloma. Don't let them get away! Have you got them? Nearly. No! Down! Get them! Don't let them get away! Paloma, I know you're busy, but the curtain's about to come down on this one. I can get a car. Where do you need it? I'll be right there. Stay down! Move! Huh? Come on! Three weeks' training, really? More or less. We're still gonna need that car. - Salud! - Salud! Where are you taking me? I'm taking you back to Mother, darling. Mother? Oh, no, no, no. Huh. There you are. No! Stay there! - You okay? - I'm great. I'm gonna borrow your plane. Sorry. It's a shortcut. This is my stop. Goodbye. - You were excellent. - You too. - Next time, stay longer. - I will. - Hey, a cigar for Felix. - Thank you. Come on. - Ciao. - Ciao. Come on, let's go. No, no, no, sir, I am not getting on that. Well, that's a shame because we don't have a choice. Let's go. Come on. Okay, okay, what have we got here? Sir, I just saved your life, okay? Please remember that. So, could you please tell me what the hell is going on? Where are you taking me? Somewhere safe. At least make it look hard. Thanks, Felix, you walked me into a trap. Get in. - What trap? - Spectre's dead. Sit. - Who's dead? - All of them. Good. What is this? Explain it to me. I don't have the words to describe to someone like you. Try one. It's perfect. A perfect what? What? Assassin. Thank you, Bond, your mission's done. - Why didn't it kill me? - You don't have to answer - those questions. Bond! - Why Spectre? - Bond, please stop asking these questions. - Quiet! Speak up. Because you were never the intended target. He was a target? Why? I changed the DNA like we decided. Now the plan is complete - and I'm confused. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who is ""we""? Did M make you build this? He is out of line here, Felix. Did M order you to kill Spectre? - Don't answer that! - Is M behind this? - He is out of line! - Felix! Ash, shut your mouth! M. M helped me build it. But please, he does not have the vision - for how to use it. - Well, who does? Who does? Blofeld? How did he know I was going to be there? Oh! I'm with Safin. You understand? Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev. I know who you are. I don't know about you, but I got a feeling in my gut Ash might not be on our side. We need to have a conversation about the company you keep. I'm with you. That's a lot of blood. So, where are we going? Get in the plane, Doctor. This might be my last mission. - What do you think? - I think you're just looking for an excuse not to help me. There you go. Paloma, she gave me a cigar for you to smoke, and you are gonna smoke it. Nice, but maybe you should hold on to that for now. You just stay put. Keep the pressure on that. I'm gonna find us a way out. I'll be over here. You know, Felix, we really need to stop meeting... - Ooh. - Okay. I was such a big fan of his. Felix! This doesn't look good. Come on, Felix, we've been in worse than this. Let's go. It's like back when I was a kid on that shrimp boat. You're from Milwaukee. Am I? I thought I made that up. He got me. Just let me go. Let me go. You got this? Yeah. Yeah. Make it worth it. James, it's a good life, isn't it? The best. Felix. Felix. Felix. - Name? - Bond. James Bond. How's retirement? Quiet. Hi. Where's Obruchev? I thought you two would get along. - Report, 007. - Thank you. That must bother you. Where is he? He left me for somebody else. It's, uh... - So, you lost him? - You can go in. - Thank you. - Thank y... Alone, I'm afraid. Oh, does that bother you? I get why you shot him. Yeah, well, everyone tries at least once. Has this desk got bigger? Or have you got smaller? I can't pretend there weren't some sorry faces when you left us, Bond, but you fell so far off the grid that we thought you must be dead. Now, learning that you were, in fact, alive and well, and... working for the CIA, well... Well, that really was a blow. Well, they just asked so nicely. It's a shame that you haven't lost your touch. We wouldn't be in this mess. This is your mess. Blofeld tried to kill me in Cuba, but someone hijacked his plan. And whoever stole your weapon used it to wipe out Spectre instead. Now your weapon is on the run and nobody seems to know who has it. So you can imagine why I've come back to play. We're looking into it. I can identify the man that took Obruchev. And what do you want in return, Bond? Blofeld. Impossible. He's in Belmarsh. Yes. He ran a Spectre meeting in Cuba from Belmarsh. - How? - No. How? No one has access. No one. Why didn't you shut it down? Why didn't you shut Heracles down? I answer to the interests of my country, not you. - And to Felix Leiter? - I certainly don't answer to Felix Leiter. Perhaps because he's dead. I'm sorry. I had a lot of respect for Leiter. Look, if you have information, I'd be happy to receive it. - Get me into Belmarsh. - No. Blofeld's the only member of Spectre still breathing, - I can't risk that. - Oh, but you will risk developing a DNA-targeting weapon with a corrupt scientist for ten years? There was nothing to suggest that Obruchev was working for anyone else. I had him... My God, you're thirsty at the moment. You have no right to speak to me that way. You have no right to make insinuations about my judgment. If you've nothing left to give, you are irrelevant. You've done your bit and we thank you for your service, again. Goodbye. Moneypenny, send in 007. You can go, Bond. It's definitely the same desk. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Go to Belmarsh. I want everything that Blofeld listens to, looks at and touches scanned. Scan every corner of that cell. Scan the whole prison. In fact, scan the whole damn man. Sir. I'll bring my gloves. James... Uh... What are you doing for dinner? - So, you're not dead? - Hello, Q. I've missed you. Mm! That smells great. Were you expecting somebody? Um... No. What... Excuse me. Oh. This is the first time I've... He'll be here in 20 minutes, I can't take my focus off... I need you to tell me what's on that. No, I need to lay the table. You know, they come with fur these days. I want to be very clear that I am not authorized to help you. - And I have sworn... - It's to do with Heracles. I presume M doesn't know that this is happening. No, but there's something going on, Q. We need to find out what it is. Well, it's never 9:00 to 5:00, is it? Thank you. - Um, Bond? - Yes? Do you know where this has been? Everywhere, I should imagine. Into the sandbox. Oh. Thank you. Um, it's a database. Don't touch that, please. What's the data? It's DNA. Multiple individuals. What was M working on? Something he should have shut down years ago. - Oh, hello. - What? There's more. Hidden files. I was asked to recover what I could from Obruchev's hard drive just after the explosion, and I have a pretty good feeling that... this is what was missing. Yeah. A complete disk. So, Obruchev is working for someone who managed to kill all of Spectre? Not all of them. Blofeld. Can you show me the other files? Mm-hmm. Wait, this can't just be Spectre. Oh, my God. There are thousands. Who are they? They're in categories. I'm gonna need more time to organize... There have been, uh, breaches round the world of databases holding DNA information. - We've been tracking them. - Ours? I can't imagine they're leaving us out, whoever they are. Well, Blofeld will know who they are. Q, you need to get me into Belmarsh. Well, there's only one person he'll speak to. Who? M says no one has access. - Really? - Did he? What's that? Can I just have one nice evening, please, before the world explodes? Who has access? Who? - Morning. - Morning. New patient. He's weird. You can't say that. I'm sorry I'm late. I wasn't expecting a new patient. Sorry if I surprised you. No. I like surprises. You're very attractive for a psychotherapist. Must be dangerous for your clients. They are usually more of a danger to themselves. Foxgloves. Beautiful. - Did you choose them? - Yes. I found them friendly. You know if you eat them they can cause your heart to just... stop. Then I'll make sure not to. Do you know a lot about flowers? My father had a garden. He taught me. He died when I was young, but my interest remained. It's difficult to lose a parent. Especially at a young age. Yes, death has a particular effect on children, doesn't it? What effect did it have on you? Profound. But I saved a life once. I think that had more of an effect. Why is that? Saving someone's life connects you to them forever, the same as taking it. They belong to you. I'm not very good at talking about myself, so I brought a memory box. I thought it might interest you. Sometimes objects can be more evocative than memories. I never forgot your eyes under the ice. They needed me. It is a shock to see them so many years later. They still need me. I am rather taken by them. - What do you want? - Just a favor. You owe me. You murdered my mother. And your father killed my entire family. Parents. I need you to visit someone for me, wearing this. It's harmless to you. You are the only one who can do it. No. Why would I do anything for you? Because I am a man willing to kill the person you love most. I've already lost everyone I've ever loved. There is nothing you can threaten me with. That is very sad to hear, Madeleine. But it is not true... is it? Madeleine Swann, really? Well, yes. We took your information seriously, but that was five years ago. Nothing came up. Well, she's very smart and very good at hiding things. She's a useful asset. She's the only psychiatrist he agreed to speak to. I had to exercise my judgment... Your judgment is the problem. That weapon was designed to save lives and to eradicate collateral damage for our agents. A clean, accurate shot every time. But it had to be off the books. There are enough holes in our national security. If the world knows what this can do... - They'd kill for it. - Mm. Look... If it's an error, it's on my shoulders, fair and square. I've dedicated my life to defending this country. I believe in defending the principles of this... Of this. But we used to be able to get into a room with the enemy, we could look him in the eye. And now the... The enemy is just floating in the ether. We don't even know what they're after. Blofeld. We managed to access a database of their targets. ""We""? Oh, for fuck's sake. I see. And after Blofeld, what do they want? Well, it's hard to say. I mean, I would imagine world leaders, innocent civilians, freedom, you know, that sort of thing. Oh, good, well, just the usual. Just the usual. Blofeld was communicating with his agents in Cuba through a bionic eye which we've now retrieved. You're welcome. Spectre's destruction's going to have huge consequences. Whoever did this is going to be very dangerous and very powerful. We need all the information that we can gather. Sir. Sir. Bond. So the rumors are true. You look well. Tanner. Sir, there's been a development. They were just dropping, one right after the other. It was disturbing, to say the least. Wait till you see what it looks like up close. - Uh, Bond's in the office. - What? Oh, Bond. My God, I haven't seen you in, in, uh... - How is your retirement? - Shut up, Q. I know he's staying with you. And you're not in the clear either. - What happened? - He's been reinstated as a double-0. - Double-0 what? - What have you got? Q has studied the blood samples I gathered from the victims of the funeral. Just look at this. What are we looking at? This is the funeral of one of the dead Spectre agents from Cuba. And here are the members of their family who made physical contact with the corpse. We found Heracles in the blood samples of all of them. Now, that's some good work, Nomi. Thank you, sir. Double-0 what? - What are they? - They're... They're nanobots. Right. Microscopic bio-robots that can enter your system by the slightest contact with your skin. Programmed with DNA to target specific individuals. Heracles was... It was designed to be the most efficient weapon in our arsenal. Passing through people harmlessly before reaching its intended target. But Obruchev modified the nanobots so that they can kill anyone related to the target. - Anyone? - Well, since it's DNA-based, with further modifications, yes. Families, certain genetic traits. Single-nucleotide variants and polymorphisms that could target a range from individuals to... whole ethnicities. You infect enough people... And the people become the weapon. It was never intended to be a weapon of mass destruction. It was... I need to call the Prime Minister. Tanner, quarantine the families from the funeral. - Yes, sir. - And, Q, hack into Blofeld's bionic eye, see what you can find. You've got your wish. Go to Blofeld and see what you can get out of him. And find that cockroach Obruchev. Sir. We don't have a trail. Logan Ash. State Department. Ex-State Department. Find him, you'll find Obruchev. Um... Good luck. Thanks. I'll be outside when you're done with your important preparation. I'll be just a moment. It's fine. Blofeld's eyeball unlocked. Accessing received media stream. I know you and she have a history, but we've kept a close eye on her over the years. She's been very compliant. If Bond does anything weird in there, you'll be doing me a huge favor, so don't make it too easy for him, okay? Okay. He's the most valuable asset this country has. I know you and he have a history, but don't let him get in your head. If you feel yourself losing control... Oh, Tanner, relax. I'm not gonna lose... control. Dr. Swann, good afternoon. Mr. Bond. Six-seven. Special cell two now locked off. Segregation unit secure. This is where we leave you. Good luck. Just get us a name. Must be nice to catch up with an old friend so regularly. We're closer than ever. Oh, that was awkward. Does he have that effect on all women? Fifty-fifty. - It's unpredictable. - Huh. Isolated in HSU. You're shaking. It's not an ideal situation. Open the door. Open the door! - Don't. - What is it? James, you don't know what this is. Don't make me do this. Please. Right. Open the doors. - Open the door. - Open it. What... Where are you going? Home. - I'll get her. - Wait. - He won't talk without her. - Just wait. Special delivery. James. Hello, Blofeld. Perhaps you can help me. Cuba was quite the party. - Happy birthday, by the way. - Thank you. I'm trying to piece together what happened. I mean, there you were, or here you were, with the world's most powerful people, your friends, all in one room, a noose around my neck, and your hands on the most valuable weapon in existence. It's like a... It was like a testimony to your greatness. A celebration of all that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Yeah, James. Yeah. But then it all went wrong, didn't it? My sweet James, what do you want? Your enemies are closing in, Blofeld. And the biggest twist here is that if you tell me who they are, I could save your life. Mm, my avenging angel. My chaser of lost causes. Now you even chase mine. But you're asking the wrong question. Yeah, Cuba was a disappointment, but we all cry on our birthday. You need to ask yourself, why are we here? Accessing media file 472. Hmm. Looking sharp, Bond. 473. 474. 475. 476, 477, 478. 479. Logan Ash. A pleasure to meet you. Oh, my God, that's him. I am sorry for your loss. I believe you know who I represent and work for? We have an opportunity for you. You keep coming back to me. I thought I'd never see you again, but fate draws us back together. Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash. - Go. - Yep. Let me know what happens. Now your enemy is my enemy. How did that happen? Well, you live long enough... Yeah. Look at us. Two old men in a hole trying to work out who's playing tricks on us. She still loves you. Did you know that? And you broke her heart. And she betrayed you. She is irrelevant. Mm, I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss. You said it yourself, she's very good at hiding things. And when her secret finds its way out, and it will, it'll be the death of you. Just give me a name. Madeleine. Please, just... Please, no games. Madeleine. Oh, do you know what? The two of you should come see me. A little couples therapy. I simply have to see your face when she tells you the truth. Just tell me who they are, Blofeld... and then I'll leave. I'll leave you on your own. No, I don't want you to leave. We're just getting reacquainted. Hmm. All right. Come. You were unusually patient. I need to give you something so that you didn't have to make all this way for nothing. Come. Careful, Bond. It was me. - You destroyed Spectre? - No. Vesper's grave. Madeleine didn't do a thing. It was all me. I knew you'd come visit it, I just needed to wait for the bon moment. She led you straight there from the goodness of her heart. And then you left her, for me. - It doesn't matter. - Oh, but it does. She still does, doesn't she? My poor little cuckoo. You were always so very, very sensitive. This isn't working. Keep going. All this wasted time, the life you could have had. And the reason all of this is so beautiful, so exquisitely beautiful, is that you're coming to me looking for answers, whereas the one person who knows it all is she. It's Madeleine. She holds the secrets you need. All of them. I didn't need to kill you. I'd already broken you. I wanted to give you an empty world... like the one you gave me. It's enough to almost make me regret it. Eh, almost. Die. Hmm? Die, Blofeld. Die. Jesus. Open the door. Bond! Bond! Bond! Open the door. Bond! Cuckoo. What the hell are you thinking? Yes, yes, yes, I know how to interrogate an asset. - This interrogation is over. - Tanner, don't lecture me! Bond, you have violated the most important rule in the whole bloody playbook. Don't move. I'm... I'm gonna need those, I'm afraid. He's dead. It's a good thing you're not actually related, or you'd be dead too. - How do I get this off? - Oh, you don't. You can't. Nanobots aren't just for Christmas. Once Heracles is in your system, it's there forever. Did they find the car? We traced it, but she abandoned it. They searched her flat, she hasn't been home. - Is she one of them? - I don't know. James, do you have any idea where she might have gone? No. I don't know her at all. Is that for me? No. Then why did you come? Because you told me to. I didn't think you would remember. I remember everything. You need to tell me who gave you the poison, Madeleine. Is he dead? Yes, he's dead. Good. He told me you didn't betray me. I understand you're not built to trust people. - Neither are you. - Then we were fools for trying. I wanted to. I don't know if you wanted me to come here, or why you tried to kill Blofeld, or who gave you the poison to do it, or how long you've been working for them, but I do know... that for what felt like five minutes of my life I wanted everything with you. And it's not because I didn't trust. It was just that feeling. I know I've come here to find out who gave you the poison. But I'm not going to leave here without you knowing that I have loved you, and I will love you, and I do not regret a single moment of my life that led me to you. Except when I put you on that train. Do you know the worst thing about you? My timing? Don't. My sense of humor? Don't. - What? - You look... You look incredible. This is Mathilde. Um... Hello. I'm James. Sir, we've located Logan Ash. 007 wants a word. - Well done, 007. - Thank you, sir. Permission for a capture or kill. Have we cleared this with the Americans? Granted. And thank you for asking. By the book, sir. Well, your predecessor was less deferential. To be fair, Commander Bond gave me the lead. Well, I'm glad to see you two getting along. Sir. Have you located Dr. Swann? Nothing, I'm afraid, sir. Thank you. If you hear anything what do you do? I hide. Very good. - Good night. - Good night. - Say good night. - Good night. Good night. She's not yours. But, um, the... Okay, the blue eyes, the... She's not yours. Okay. I have something to show you. Another child? What is it with your dad and secret rooms? Talk to me. I wanted to bring you here before. To tell you everything. Blofeld ordered my father to assassinate this family. The boy survived. His name is Lyutsifer Safin. When I was a little girl, he came here to kill my father. But he found me and my mother instead. He spared my life. And now he's back. - And what does he want? - Revenge. Me. - Who were they? - Spectre's poisoners. My father held a banquet for them, used their own recipe in the dessert. Dioxin. They would have suffered horribly. Scarred him for life. The family had an island. They called it the Poison Garden. Oh, so... Blofeld took it from them, and kept running it, and now this Safin has taken it back. Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin. Whereabouts unknown and no recent photographs, but I'm gonna send you some images of him as a boy. And a picture of an island. So, you know, do your best. And I'm gonna need a plane to get there, a big one. I'll send you my location shortly. You're going to find him? There are a thousand reasons why we need to find this man. You just gave me a reason to kill him. I'm hungry. How is it? Not bad. Excuse me. - Yes? - Bond. Did you find the island? Yes, it's part of a chain in disputed waters between Japan and Russia. There's a chemical plant dating back to the Second World War, seems to have had quite a history. Sir, Japanese intelligence have reported suspicious activity on the island. Q, bring up the satellite images I just sent through. These were taken over the last few days. - If that is Safin there... - Then Heracles is there too. Where do you need this plane, Bond? Hang on, Q. Did 007 manage to locate Logan Ash? She's closing in on him. I'll send you her location. I thought she was following Logan Ash, not me. What? She is. James, where are you? Put her in the back. There you are. In here. Watch your head. Where are we going? We're going on an adventure, darling. Hang on. Q, I am gonna need that plane, quickly. I'm near Orland NATO base. You think you can get it to me? Right. Right, yes. We'll be there. - Thank you. - Mama. A mosquito bite me. It's okay. Dou Dou, do you like mosquitoes? Mama. - Do mosquitoes have friends? - I don't know. I don't think so. Hang on. James. Mathilde! They're above us! Get out of here! James! You stay here. I'll be back soon. Anybody comes through that door, you shoot them. Unless it's me. You be quiet, okay? Stay really quiet. Hey! Go! Go! There! Run him over! Nice moves, Bond. You won't be able to stop him... ...so why don't you help me out, brother? I had a brother. His name was Felix Leiter. Need a ride? Where have you been? Chasing after your lead. - Ash? - Dead. They took Dr. Swann. And her daughter. I... I didn't know she had a daughter. Did M get my plane? Our plane. I'm coming with you. Thank you, 007. - Hello, Q. - Bond. Sorry to get you out of bed. The objectives of this mission are threefold. Confirm the presence of Heracles. Kill Obruchev and Safin. Get Dr. Swann and her daughter off the island. And, Bond, I hope they're there. - Thank you, sir. - Sir. Permission for Commander Bond to be redesignated as 007. It's just a number. Very well. Agreed. Good luck. Bond, your watch. It contains a limited-radius electromagnetic pulse. It'll short any circuit in a hardwired network - if you get close enough. - Mm-hmm. And how strong is it? It's fairly strong. ""Fairly strong,"" what's that mean? We haven't had the chance to test it properly, just be careful. Right, this is Q-DAR. It will map the space as you move through it. Don't touch that. And smart blood will track you... Whoops. And your vitals. Bond, you don't mind a shot or two whilst at work? - Shall we? - Well, I haven't had a drink for three or four hou... - Hours. - Wow. Doesn't sound like you. - Ow! - Good. I assume you know how the stealthy bird works. No, no idea. Gravity. Welcome back, Mr. Safin. Welcome to your family. How are you progressing? So, so good, Mr. Safin. So, so good. - My request? - Svetlana? Continue. - What is that? - Insurance. A simple hair falls from your head and now I have your life in my hands. And yours. How damaged you must be to threaten a little girl. You're any less damaged? You love a killer. You bore his child despite his rejection. You've hidden and lied your whole life. You will do anything... To survive. You understand me the same way I understand you. Move. My father's garden. It was his toxic treasure. Let me show her. - Give her to me. - No. I can protect her. Mathilde. Remember what I told you. Don't touch anything. Okay? Mathilde. It's a poison garden... but it's perfectly safe. My father made this. He loved his plants so much, he would sing to them. I want to show you one of my favorites. Some of these plants are very dangerous, but not all of them are for hurting people. I have plants that can do all sorts of things. Mathilde! No. This one makes you do as you're told, so you never misbehave, and you're always good. You mustn't misbehave, Mathilde. And neither must your mother. Ever. - Do you like it here? - No. Well, you will learn to. I grew up here, and you will too. Such a beautiful child. Perhaps we should have some tea. - No. - Make her see the light. No, you can't separate us! - Mathilde! - Mama! Remember what I told you. I'll come looking for you. Okay? Don't worry. You have me. As soon as you have a line of sight on the island, drop altitude, stay below radar. You ever flown one of these things before? Nope. Don't forget to release the chute, and open the wings. Gravity isn't always your friend. Look for a concrete structure on the west side of the island. That's your best bet for getting in. Coming up for air, Q. Right, good. You should be entering a World War II-era sub pen. Doesn't seem to get much activity, but look out for cameras anyway. Use your watch, Bond. - What's going on? - It's the equipment. The cameras are down. The whole lower sector. I'll restart the system. Okay. Ah, there you go. - Sir, they're in. - Yes, we have it. You should be able to see the chemical plant's architecture. - Which one's Bond? - He's the... He's the psi. - He's the trident thingy. - Give us the layout. Right. You're at the edge of a toxic merry-go-round. The main activity should be towards the central hub, which is directly above you. Bond. Bond, there's something... There's something big up ahead, I can't work out what it is. It's... These walls must be thick. Bond. Bond? 007, do you read me? We've lost them. They've entered a blind spot, sir. I can't work out what it is they've walked into. Well, just get them back. Well, will you look at those doors. This was a missile silo. Right. Let's go. Everybody, over there! In the corner! Now! - What? How? - Move! Move! On the ground! Alarm. Down, boy. What... What are you doing? You cannot explode laboratory, please. This is suicide mission. Come on. You will never leave this island alive. That was the farm. And this is the factory. They're mass-producing it. Nomi, come and look at this. Well, look, you cannot stop it, mister. We have big plan, you know. - We have big numbers. - What is it? It's a simulation. They're not just attacking individuals. They're going to kill millions. It will not fit in a suitcase this time, lady. He's really getting on my nerves. Well, shut him up. Ow! My nose. We have to destroy this whole facility. There is no need for violence. Mr. Safin, they use explosives. - Shut up. - Mr. Bond, you have something of mine and I have something of yours. Why don't you come up and we can talk about it? Like adults. Safin, where is he? If I don't come back, blow it all to shit. We don't have enough explosives for that. Yeah, but they don't know that. Huh. He said you must drink. - For your health. - Do you trust him? He made me kill your last master. Why do you think he let you join him? I think he wants you to drink. I want him to give me my daughter back. He said if you behave, you'll see her. Drink. Do you know what this flower does? It makes you blind. Just a drop of this in your eye, and you'll never see again. Losing one eye is a tragedy. Losing two... - No games. - This is not a game. Welcome. On the floor. Your sidearm. Careful. - She is light as a feather. - All right! Please, sit. It's going to be all right. Promise you, it's going to be all right. James Bond. History of violence. License to kill. Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld. In love with Madeleine Swann. I could be speaking to my own reflection. We've made slightly different choices. No. We've just developed different methods for the same goal. Only your skills die with your body. Mine will survive long after I'm gone. And life is all about leaving something behind. Isn't it? Doesn't have to be ugly. You leave my baby alone, I leave yours. What do you think? I think you're right. Thank you. I think we are the same. We both know what it feels like to have everything taken from us before we're even in the fight. It would have been nice to have a chance, you know, don't you think? Just... we all should get a chance. But this thing that you're building, it puts everyone, the whole world on a battlefield. Nobody gets a chance. The thing that no one wants to admit is that most people want things to happen to them. We tell each other lies about the fight for free will and independence, but we don't really want that. We want to be told how to live, and then die when we are not looking. People want oblivion, and a few of us are born to build it for them. So, here I am, their invisible god... sneaking under their skin. You know that history isn't kind to those who play God. And you don't? We both eradicate people to make the world a better place. I just want to be a little... tidier. Without collateral. I want the world to evolve, yet you want it to stay the same. Let's face it... - I've made you redundant. - No. Not as long as there are people like you in the world. And with all due respect to the enormity of your... tidy achievements, all you're really doing is standing in a very long line of angry little men. I'm not angry, just passionate. Disable your explosives, get off my island, and you can take this precious little angel with you. And Madeleine? - She stays. - You know I can't do that. That is a shame. She really hoped you would. She knows it's her only path to survive. No, you have her tell me that. What mother wouldn't sacrifice herself for her own child? Is that what happened to yours? My mother lay at my feet as I watched her die. Wait! Wait. Wait. I'll do whatever you want. Yes, you will. I... I apologize. I'm sorry. Simple choices, Mr. Bond. Like do you want to die in front of your daughter? Or do you want your daughter to die in front of you? No. No. No. No. No. I am sorry. I'm sorry. Look at your father, Mathilde. This is power. I'm sorry. I'm truly, truly sorry. James! Where is she? The first shipment is on the dock, - ready for pickup, Doctor. - Very good. My Dou Dou. Hmm... If you don't want my protection, then... off you go. Move. Our first buyers are arriving. Sir, I've just detected some suspicious activity. Several high-speed transports are headed towards the island. Origin unknown. Still no sign of 007. Come on, Bond. Where the hell are you? This is hopeless situation, lady. Please. Bond. Bond. The party is larger than the reservation. Look, lady, please, please just let me go. I... There was never gonna be a way out. Stop this nonsense. You don't have a chance, anyways. Hey. Hey, I have a good vial for your people, good for West African diaspora. It can be a good thing. You know, I do not need laboratory to exterminate your entire race from the face of the Earth. - Do you know what time it is? - What? Time to die. No! Move! Move! They dropped down to a lower level. There has to be a stairwell down. Mama? I lost my little Dou Dou. Mathilde. Mathilde. I looked for you all over. Where were you? I hid like you told me. I love you. Me too. I love you. We should go. It's Q. Do you read me? Come in, 007, it's Q. Traffic. We have traffic. - I think we just got buzzed. - Those are two Russian MiGs. Traffic. TCAS, you have control. I understand, and I'm doing the best that I can. Just please wait. Sir, I've got the Navy, the Japanese, the Russians, all breathing down my neck, demanding to know why we've got a C-17 circling a disputed island. Don't tell them anything just yet. - Ah, just in time. - Nomi, you know... Madeleine, Mathilde, they're my, uh... - Hey. - Hi. Family? Q. Q, are you there? Yes. Bond. Do we have any Royal Naval vessels - in the immediate vicinity? - Uh, yes. Why? We are gonna need an immediate strike on this location. This whole island, it's a manufacturing plant for Heracles. We don't have clearance for missile strikes, do we? Mm-mm. Bond, there's something else you should know. Several unidentified ships are headed your way. They're coming after Heracles. How far out? Uh, 20 minutes. Q, patch me through. - 007. - M. Our operation is attracting a lot of international attention. We're seeing what we can do. Come on. Let's go. Come on. It's going to get very cold out there, so... I want you to have this. That'll keep you warm. I have to finish this. For us. I know. I'll just be a minute. I've got them. This might come in handy. Thank you. Q, talk to me. Um, our uninvited guests are 15 minutes away. Bond, M here. The situation is diplomatically complex. We don't have a choice. Fire on my mark. If we launch, the Russians, the Japanese and even the Americans will want answers. Well, don't give them any. Rational minds, Bond. I'm trying to save this from escalating to all-out war. Mallory, if we don't do this, there will be nothing left to save. Fire on my mark. 007, there's another problem. - That room you were just in. - Yes, I know, I know. I've got to open the blast doors. Otherwise our missiles will bounce off it like they've hit a trampoline. Yes, I know, I know. Find the control room. It should be in a tower just above the blast doors. The missiles will take about nine minutes from launch. Do you think you can do it before the ships arrive? Plenty of time, plenty of time. Bond. Bond, do you read me? Yeah. Yeah, Q. I read you. Sounds like you're in a rugby scrum. I just showed someone your watch. Really blew their mind. Right, good. Now, did you find the control room? Well, my Russian is a little rusty, but I think so, yeah. Okay, Q. Uh, I've done some research. - Old schematics... - Q, I am gonna need some... Yes? Bond? - Hello? - Power. Power? Right, the infrastructure must go back to the 1950s, so it's going to be an overly complicated and intricate switching system. Now, the order in which you engage it will need to be extremely precise. You're looking for a control panel. There should be a counterweight clutch. So, listen very carefully, 007. The first thing you need to do... Got it. I think. Yep, that's it. Launch the missiles. Not until you're clear. Q, tell M to launch the missiles now. Okay. Okay, okay. Understood. M, Bond says fire. HMS Dragon here. - Admiral. - Sir. - M here. - What are my instructions? You have permission to launch. Roger. Launching the strike. Missiles airborne. Nine minutes out. No. No. No, no! Quite a mess you've made. Like an animal. Now we are both poisoned with heartbreak. Two heroes in a tragedy of our own making. Anyone we touch, we are their curse. A stroke to their cheek, a kiss... would kill them instantly. Yes... Madeleine. Yes, Mathilde. You made me do this, you see? This was your choice. Q. Q, are you there? Bond, there you are. Are they safe, Q? Yes, they're safe. Bond, have you left the island? There's a slight problem with the blast doors. Won't take a sec. No, no, no. Bond, the missiles have already launched. Just get out of there. Q, how do I, uh... How do I destroy this? If the silo doors are open, the missiles will deal with it. No. No, no, no. If you get it on you, how do... How do you get it off? You know as well as I do that you can't. It's... It's permanent. It's eternal. Which is why we have to destroy it. For Christ's sake, James, just get off the island. It's harmless unless you're near to the target. Yeah. Well, that's not gonna work. Oh, God. Oh, God. It's for Madeleine. It's all right, Q. It's all all right. Would you put Madeleine on, please? Yes, of course. How stupid of me. Nomi, come in. Can you put Madeleine on? Madeleine. - James. - Madeleine. I'm here. Where are you? Is it done? - James? - Yes. Yes, he's... He's dead. - Are you both there? - Yes. Good. You're safe. That's good. Have you left? No. Um... I'm not gonna make it. What? - Madeleine. Madeleine. - You promised. Just get off that island. I know you can do this. Everything's good now. There's no one left to hurt us. Madeleine... you have made... the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. She's perfect. Because she came from you. Oh, God. The vial. You've been poisoned. Yes. There must be a way. There must be a way. We just need more time. If we only had more time. You have all the time in the world. I love you. I love you too. She does have your eyes. I know. I know. Very hard to know what to say, but I thought we should gather and remember. And I... I thought this was appropriate. ""The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time."" To James. - James. - James. James. James. Right, back to work. Mathilde. I'm going to tell you a story... about a man. His name was Bond. James Bond. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, We have arrived at the Hong Kong International Airport. Please take all your baggage with you. We have arrived... You're back! Daddy. Miss me? One Two Three Yeah! Leave at once! Due to an emergency at the airport, passengers please leave the airport immediately. Be careful! Go! This way! Due to an emergency situation, passengers please leave the airport immediately. Hong Kong International Airport, sitting on 1,255 hectares and cost $70 billion to build, was blown to bits in an instant, killing thousands. Why did that happen? Anger. Anger can destroy everything. Luckily when all hope was lost, one man overcame his anger and stopped this tragedy from happening. Help! It'll blow. Help! One hour ago, a man armed with a grenade robbed a watch shop. This is a stickup! This is a grenade! Put the watches in the bag. Hurry! Put out your hand! Hold this! Tightly! Don't let go! Or it'll blow. It'll blow up! Help! Help! - Help me! - Stay where you are. Stand still. Don't be afraid. The hole of the grenade is displaced. Can't put the pin back in. The only solution is to detonate it on the spot. Extend the lockdown area to 40m. Yes, Sir! Calling command post! Find an open area and start piling up sandbags. Yes, Sir! Get the sandbags. It'll be over soon. Fung! The sandbags are ready. Let's begin! No! It'll blow. No! No! No! It'll blow up! No! OK! OK! Calm down! You'll be fine. Fung! What are you doing? You took off the suit? Don't worry! Here we go. OK! OK! Give it to me Easy No rush! OK! OK! Very good! Why did you take off the suit? The girl was so scared. I couldn't do anything. Here Covering her with the bomb suit can ensure safety? If the grenade went off, what will happen to you? You'll both fry! Hey! You don't save lives by risking your own. You're right. Saving lives doesn't mean risking my own. But as an EODB (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau) officer, when do we not risk our lives? You're right. There's no need to spell it out. Tung Sir has a point. Because he's Tung Sir! You're taking his side? Over here! Hurry! Over here! Over here! - Police! - What's is it? What's going on? Somebody threw corrosive liquid off the building. We wish to come in for a look. Police! Open up! Get down! Get down! ""Dad : Mom has terminal cancer."" ""Dad : Mom has terminal cancer."" What's going on? We got a call, someone threw corrosive liquid off the building. We went door to door, someone on 7/F refused to open up. We broke the door down, and found the owner hold his ex-girlfriend and her husband hostage and tied them to two bombs. Stay calm, Miss! Sit tight and don't move. We'll get you out ASAP. The bombs are identical. Should be the same design. Detonated by pressure. When she stands up, the bomb will go off. Luckily we caught this in time. We're finished if she gets tired. Are these wires connected to the bomb on your end? Bingo! They're synchronized. If one goes off, the other one will too. If we defuse one bomb, the other will also go off. The wiring is of a basic design. If we cut the power, the bomb won't go off. It's black powder. 100 grams in each pipe that's 300 grams total. Based on Sadovsky's formula, the brisance is that of 3 grenades, the bomb suit will hold. Man, let's get them out first. OK! Miss, please stay calm. I'll now cut the chain for you. After that, go out this door, someone will help you. We're ready to cut the chain. Copy! Copy! Ready? Ready! Don't be afraid. Go out now. Come. Cut the green wire. In sync. The timing no more than 1/4 second apart. Copy. Give me a beat. Fine! On 420. Ready. To! We're ready to roll. Copy! OK! All clear! You can go. I'll wrap up. Thanks! Watch out! Officer down! Send in the paramedic! Tung Sir! Go check on Fung! Yes, Sir! What? I lost a leg, but I still have two hands. I can defuse a bomb with my left hand and hold your hand with my right. I may be the only coolest handicapped EODB officer. Tell the boys, I'll be back soon. Fung said he'll be back soon! Hey! Talk to me! I'll be back soon. ""Gabapentin Capsules for epilepsy/neuropathic pain"" Madam, something for you. What? I love you! 800 m in 2 minutes and 21 seconds. Take a break. I'm not tired. You beat the Police standard, you should take a break. A toast to me, I can walk again. And to you, for your promotion. So you have heard? The boys said we should celebrate with you. Sure thing! I knew you can do it. I was afraid you'd get ahead of me and now you did it. Cut the crap! I wonder when I can go back to work. If I don't start working soon, I think I'll go crazy. Seriously The brass said as soon as you're ready, they'll have a desk job for you. A desk job? A desk job. Are you kidding me? But I'd think the same if I were in their shoes. They don't know how fit I am. Arrange for the fitness test ASAP. Once they see the results, they'll be begging me to come back to work. Come back! Please come back! Like that? Yes! Here we go. 29 minus 8 Very good! Even higher than Police standard! Sir, can I help you? The bombing at the Education Bureau is an isolated incident. There's no specific intel suggesting Hong Kong is a likely target of terrorist attack. The city's threat of terrorist attack is currently assessed to be moderate. The suicide bomber at the Education Bureau was a terrorist, called Cheung Chi Man. He was a grad student working on his PhD. 6 months ago, his girlfriend, who was also a grad student jumped off a building. Inside the computer in his flat, we found a downloaded file from the dark web about a new extremist group called Vendetta and its ""The Guide to Lone-wolf Terrorism"". In the past, Vendetta used the social networking platform of the dark web to provide assistance to those who detest society and engineer lone-wolf terrorist attacks overseas. Our intel shows two people are the masterminds behind the group. One uses the codename Maverick, Ma Sai Kwan, a rich 2G from Hong Kong. When he was at University College London studying Economics and Political Science, he was already an anarchist. In 1997, he was in Seattle for the anti-WTO protests. In 2000, he took over the family business. A year later, along with several foreigners, he trashed up an international fast food chain. Get out of the place! Mr. Ma, about what you're doing, will your family be disappointed? They have no right to be disappointed. My family made their fortune from the Brits selling opium. Their money was dirty. When he was out on bail, he jumped bail and illegally transferred USD$300M from his family's account to an offshore bank. He once said his family fortune was sinful. He wanted to use justice to clean it up. 5 years ago, he used a fake passport and returned to Hong Kong. After that, he vanished without a trace. Our intel shows in his external communications, he often mentioned someone called Davy. INTERPOL believes Davy is another mastermind behind Vendetta. But we have yet to confirm his real identity. Over the past 4 months, they have arranged for at least 30 armed personnel to sneak into Hong Kong. It appears they're using Hong Kong to launch a terrorist attack. I'm now putting you in charge of tracking them down. Find Ma Sai Kwan and Davy ASAP. To prevent any leaks, this operation is classified. Understand? ""Gabapentin Capsules for epilepsy/neuropathic pain"" Sir, meds should be taken with water. Look at that! Sorry, I'll pay you $5,000. Where did you learn how to drive? How about $10K? Money isn't everything. Of course not. I just want to pay you. Sorry! Is this OK? Do you have a license? Of course! - Officer! Sorry! - Well? - Can you settle this? - We're trying. - You wanna pursue this? - Of course! I'll pay for it. I'll jot down the damages of both vehicles. I need you to stand... Are you new here? Yes! I want a staff... Lock down elevator No. 4. Copy! Fighting in elevator No. 4. It's now locked on 5/F, send someone over right away. We reached the elevator. He jumped onto elevator No. 5 and got off on 10/F. Go check it out! Stay where you are! Hey! So noisy! What's going on? What's going on? Open the door! The lighting ceremony of Glimmering Hong Kong is about to commence. Let's have the Chairman of the Real Estate Developers Association, Mr. Leung Chi Choi to come up here for the lighting ceremony. Key! Key! Open the door! Don't move! Check the hotel carefully. Look for any suspicious looking or potential explosives. Yes, Sir! Tung Sir, what kind was it? We think it was C-4. C-4? Madam, a victim was in hotel uniform, but the hotel has nothing on him. He's probably a suspect. Over there! Fung! One Two Three Up! More casualties are on the way. Everyone, standby! Yes! In the Island Hotel explosion, the death toll has increased to 18. According to a reliable source, the Police investigation is skewed towards a terrorist attack. For security reasons, several major events have been canceled. Three Two One Again! Three Two One The bomb had a primer for military use with an instantaneous detonator. Probably the on/off switch of the lighting ceremony. Unlike the Education Bureau explosion 4 months ago, RDX, cyclonite was used. This time, C-4. They're both high performance explosives. The suspect in the custodial ward, any updates? He's still in a coma. We cross-matched his fingerprints and confirmed he's ex-EODB officer, Poon Shing Fung. The CCTV showed him coming out with the on/off switch. He also got in a fight with a security guard. Don't get ahead of ourselves in drawing conclusions. ""Poon Shing Fung is awake"" Chan Sir, Poon Shing Fung is awake. Tung Sir, Poon Shing Fung was your ex-partner. Madam Pong, he was your old friend. You should both stay away. That's why Lee Sir will follow up with Poon Shing Fung. Yes, Sir! Before we have any leads to go on, not a word to anyone about Poon Shing Fung. Yes, Sir! ""Ming Sum Hospital"" Long time no see. Do I know you? Fine! I'm CIP (Chief Inspector of Police) of the Crime Unit Lee Yiu Sing. You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given as evidence in Court. I want some water. Hey! Poon Shing Fung, you're a suspect in an explosion. In 2019, on October 3, what were you doing at Island Hotel? I want some water. I'm asking you about Island Hotel... I don't remember. With other suspects, I'm never this patient. Poon Shing Fung, what were you doing there? Do you have accomplices? Poon Shing Fung? I don't even remember my name. Can you tell me what I am doing here? Sure! Let me jog your memory. You blew 18 people to bits and dozens more are injured. If you refuse to work with the Police, prison is where you'll spend the rest of your life. No way! I had nothing to do with it. It wasn't me. Also, Wong Lai Ling, the cleaning lady. It was her last day, she was retiring. You blew her up. Look again! Get away from me! Start talking! What are you doing? - Speak up! - Lee Sir! The patient had a major concussion that resulted in PTA (Post-Traumatic Amnesia). He had no idea how he ended up here. Can't even remember his own name. Can he fake it? He may be able to fool you, but not this machine. The temporal lobe consists of hippocampus responsible for short term and long term memory. The fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) shows the inner temporal lobe is inactive, which means he lacks memory activities. Obviously, he suffered an injury. Will he recover? It's hard to say. Some have a speedy recovery. For others, external factors may lead to a gradual recovery. But for some, they may never recover. Damage to the hippocampus only affects declarative memory. For example, he won't remember where he has been, what he has done or won't recall people he knows. But for things he's accustomed to, his motor skills, such as brushing his teeth, driving a car or using a computer; what we consider procedural memory, won't be affected. Because this type of memory is deeply embedded in our subconscious as implicit memory, and won't need our consciousness to recall. Someone who suffers from declarative memory loss, may form a new consciousness, exhibit a new temperament, develop new concepts or even form a new outlook on right and wrong. In other words, become a different person. Sir, I have an idea. Salute! Place your men in deadly peril and they will survive. Leave them in dire straits and they're reborn. Boss! My troops. They're willing to die for you. Boys, are you ready? Yes, sir! Good! Let's wait for Davy, and Resurrection Day may proceed as planned. How is Blizzard? Still in the hospital. Resurrection day cannot happen without Blizzard. Yes! Boss! ""Ming Sum Hospital"" We're taking you to do a MRI scan. Please remove all metals on him. Don't move! Be quiet! Don't move! Lee Sir, Poon Shing Fung is doing a MRI scan. Out to all, the prisoner escaped from the MRI room. You in the wheelchair, don't move! Sit tight! We'll break you out! Police! Freeze! Police! Come back! Due to an emergency at the hospital Follow me! please follow instructions from hospital personnel and evacuate at once. Hurry! It's not safe here. Follow me. Get down. Out to all, suspect is in Prosthetic and Orthotic Unit on 2/F. Stay back! What is it? Don't move! Stay where you are! Get back! Get back! Poon Shing Fung, let the driver go. You framed me for killing 18 people. I don't mind adding one more. Drop your weapon! Don't push me! Take it easy! Stay where you are! Drive! Poon Shing Fung, come back! Stop the car! Now! Relax! Just drive! I will catch you. Definitely! Madam, the vehicle is over there. He's the owner. We confirmed it's his car. How much longer will it take? I need to work. That's my wallet. Thank you! Madam! RoadCams spotted Poon Shing Fung in Mongkok. He went inside a cybercafe. ""Siu Ming"" Poon Shing Fung? ""Poon Shing Fung"" ""Poon Shing Fung"" ""EODB officer lost one leg in IED (Improvised Explosive Device) explosion"" ""EODB officer defuses 2,000-pound wartime bomb after 20 hours"" ""Cell phone radio wave or interference may increase risk of explosion"" Hang in there! Seal off the back and guard all the intersections. Yes, Sir! Poon Shing Fung! We located the suspect. He escaped through the back door. He's in a navy jacket and grey jeans. Copy! Poon Shing Fung! Stop! Stay where you are! Come back! Guard the back door! Let's go up! Poon Shing Fung! What is it? What are you doing? Move! Police! Poon Shing Fung! Up there! Poon Shing Fung!

Don't move! You called me. You called me. It's me. I'm calling you. ""Dialing5696 0142"" You still remember my number. Tell me Can you carry on your mission? Why didn't you pick up? I don't take unknown calls. Seal off Sai Yeung Choi Street and the nearby area. Keep looking. Copy. They'll be here soon. Go south on Nathan Road. I'll contact you. Suspect is northbound on Nathan Road. Copy. You're Pong Ling. Drive! What are you doing? You're a suspect in an explosion. Turn yourself in! I don't remember anything. I have nothing to say. Turn yourself in or I'll have you arrested. Go ahead! Don't push me! I'll kill you if I had no choice. Drive! Traffic 34, over! Please check a stolen car. I know we used to be friends. Tell mewho am I? I know different versions of you. We used to go through Hell and back together. You were an EODB officer who saved lives. After that, you became so full of yourself, you drove yourself into a dead end. The current you suffer from amnesia. Which one do you want to know? I lost my left leg in the line of duty? Yes! In that explosion, we both burnt our hands and you lost your leg. That's why EOD fired me? They did not. We all know you don't want a desk job at EODB. So we had a discussion and decided to transfer you to PPRB (Police Public Relations Branch). Sorry, Sir! I believe there's a misunderstanding. I'm an EODB officer, I should be in the field. All officers in the field must pass a strict physical. I have more than passed it. Tung Sir of EOD is waiting outside. He can attest to that. That won't be necessary. I hope you'll understand, if any future incident is caused by the Police employing disabled personnel, we'll have a lot of explaining to do. You still doubt my ability. I'm willing to undertake any fitness test. If I don't pass, so be it. That really won't be necessary. Don't waste anyone's time. I hope you'll understand. What do you want me to understand? You want me to understand you don't want to be accountable? Poon Shing Fung, mind your words. I lost a leg. Why? For work. You won't even give me a chance. You think I'm a waste of your time? UI63660, we're aware of your valor and have been more than considerate. You had a fallout? Didn't you tell them in order to get back to EOD, how hard I have worked? I did. You did not. You don't want me back. Why would I do that? Fine! If I wrote a petition to the CP (Commissioner of Police), will you co-sign it? What petition? You won't! I will! I definitely will. But Tung Cheuk Man is too small a potato to make them change the system. You're right! Absolutely right! On January 15, 2015, colleagues of EODB, Tung Cheuk Man and Poon Shing Fung risked their lives to defuse a bomb and saved two civilians. The Hong Kong Police hereby awards them the MBG (Medal for Bravery - Gold) to commend them for their noble act of risking their lives to save others. Let's have CIP Tung Cheuk Man of EODB. Now, let's have CIP Poon Shing Fung. ""The Police is ungrateful. I'm now dispensable."" No, Poon Sir! Don't do this, Poon Sir! No pictures! Don't do this, Poon Sir! No pictures! No pictures! Watch out, Tung Sir! No pictures! No pictures! Assault! Assault! Assault! Every newspaper mentioned the assault. None reported what I protested against. They don't care about me. Fine! Don't they care about justice? What about the truth? Never mind what they wrote. I'd be just as angry. But what you did was wrong. What did I do wrong? You can go back after your injury, but I can't. I'm only fighting for what I deserved. What's wrong with that? That's what I'm doing. But after what you did, there's no turning back. How long will it take? One year? Two? Three? You're my buddy. You should be on my side. Come with me to protest. - Our job is to serve the people, - We go together. - not serve our own purpose. - Protest. Protestcomplain Hey, get a grip! What kind of a fool do you take me for? Everyone thinks I'm sick. And you are! The world is sick! Back then, you turned a deaf ear to everything I said. You treated the world like your enemy. But when my Mom died, you came to show your last respects. Remember that? Family and friends, all rise! Everyone, please bow your heads. Family, press the button. The ceremony is over. Please step out of the hall. Alone? If I can manage, I'll do it alone. How's business? Tough. People nowadays toss whatever is broken. They don't want to fix things. Congrats! You defused another wartime bomb. Next week, I'm taking the team out to dinner. How nice! If... I were still with EOD, who do you think will be treating dinner? Look, Pong's house-warming. King To's new baby. Look. Congratulate them for me. The team wants to see you. But I don't. Actually Can't think of anything to say? You should leave. Thanks for paying my Mom your last respects. I also want to know who is Pong Ling. She is your ex. She asked me if I can carry on my mission. You saw her? What mission do I have? I don't know. Pick this up at the foot of the mountain. Pong Ling, it's Tung Cheuk Man. Fung just came to see me. He said you told him he had a mission. What mission? Sorry! It's highly classified. I can't tell you. Why did you let me go? You're an UC (undercover) for the CTRU (Counter Terrorism Response Unit). I'm your handler. I don't remember anything. But I remember your face and your name. If you were to tell me we're dating each other, I'll believe you. We used to. I treated you horribly? No, you were great. But after you lost your leg, you became a different person. ""The Police is ungrateful. I'm now dispensable"" Poon Sir! Don't do this! What do you mean dispensable? They transferred you to a desk job with the PPRB. You didn't want it. You're my girlfriend. You should know how I feel. I do. But the disciplinary services require physical fitness. There's nothing wrong with me. With your leg like this, how can you defuse a bomb? How can... I don't defuse bomb with my leg. I use my hands. Other than me, no one can tell me no. You're disabled. How can you protect civilians? Then why can Tung Cheuk Man go back and I can't? His injury is different from yours. How different? You mean he's not handicapped, but I am? That's not what I mean... Do I have to make a bomb, then defuse it to prove myself? Listen to yourself! You're a ticking bomb. Fung, let's go see a doctor, OK? I did. I'm on meds. I'm talking about a psychiatrist. Let's go see a psychiatrist. I'm not crazy. I'm hurting. Do you understand? I do. I do. I don't think we can stay together. Get out! Get out! Get out! No! Fung, calm down. Will you calm down? Yours and Man's injuriesthat was an accident. No one knew it would end like this. Fung! You can't blame anyone. Calm down! Fung! Fung! Fung! Fung! Even though we broke up, I have never given up on you. I knew you always wanted to be a cop. Go away! What's your hurry? I found a way to help you. Try me. I know your anger got the better of you. It finally clicked? Then why didn't you tell them? What makes you think so? I know you want to be a cop again. But they don't want me. That's not true. They need someone exactly like you. We received word from the FBI about an extremist group called Vendetta planning a terrorist attack in Hong Kong. They're actively recruiting people who think alike. After your accident, you began to hold extreme views and became anti-social. These qualities fit their profile. I suggested to Chan Sir to send you to Vendetta as an UC to catch the men behind the group, Ma Sai Kwan and Davy and stop the terrorist attack. Here's the file on Vendetta. Because there are terrorists, you don't think I'm crazy anymore. The Poon Shing Fung I know would never stand by and watch people die. Accept the offer and make an arrest, Chan Sir will agree to reinstate you. Think it over. Hello? I'm in. Before the explosion, you gave me the intel. But we don't want to go public and cause public panic. So we let you in to defuse the bomb. In this operation, everyone thought you planted the bomb. Only I know you went in to defuse it. After the explosion, we found some of your personal belongings. Your phone got wet. Luckily colleagues of Team D recovered the data inside. Judging from the GPS records, you stayed in one place every night. Want to check it out? ""Gabapentin Capsules for epilepsy/neuropathic pain"" You said this one is most comfortable. I hope you can carry on your mission. When you escaped from the hospital, Vendetta sent someone to your rescue, that proves you have become a crucial member of the group. How did we meet? 7 years ago, we met at a Police cocktail party. You accidentally spilled red wine on my uniform. You apologized and I said it was OK. Then you said you did it on purpose. You meant to get my attention. Let's not go into that. This watch has GPS and recording functions. Wear it and it can ensure your safety. Can I hug you? I don't remember much. I can't tell what's real and what's not. If you trust me, you're a cop. If you don't, you're a terrorist. Ask yourself what kind of person is Poon Shing Fung. Your top priority is to contact Vendetta, help us catch Ma Sai Kwan and find out Davy's real identity in order to foil their terrorist attack. Blizzard. After you lost your leg, you became so full of yourself, you drove yourself into a dead end. If I were still with EOD, who do you think will be treating dinner? After you lost your leg, you became a different person. Pong Ling, tell me honestly, what mission can Fung possibly have? Man, I told you it's classified. I can't tell you. He's a suspect in a bombing incident that killed 18 people. He's an armed fugitive. Every cop in town is looking for him. He doesn't remember any mission. You know the kind of danger he's in? You asked him to find terrorists. If you really want to know, talk to Chan Sir. Someone who suffers from declarative memory loss, may form a new consciousness, exhibit a new temperament, develop new concepts or even form a new outlook on right and wrong. He can become a different person. Sir, I have an idea. Madam Pong, I'd like you to meet Professor Wong Ching Yi and Dr. Lam Chi Ming. Hello! Hello! ""Dr. Lam Chi Ming Specialist in Neurology"" Hello! Hello! ""Wong Ching Yi Professor in Clinical Psychology"" You're Pong Ling. He still remembers my name. We can implant memories, but not feelings. You're still inside his subconscious that means he still misses you, though he may not remember what happened in the past. I only want to know if this will affect our plan. According to past research, even though implanted memories need to be substantiated by actual events and not something fabricated, it's also best that someone trustworthy to the subject can verify everything. Madam Pong, I do not doubt you. On the contrary, I need to tell you your relationship with Poon Shing Fung is in our favor when we implant fake memory. You're an UC for the CTRU, and I'm your handler. Do you know why Fung became what he is today? He wanted to be reinstated back then, you rejected him because you didn't want to take the rap. Now that he has amnesia, you had the nerve to tell him he's working undercover? He can't even remember if he's a cop! What's wrong with you people? If we had other options, I wouldn't have accepted Madam Pong's suggestion. In order to close file, you're capable of anything! What if he got himself killed? Will that be in the line of duty, Madam? He has no record with the Hong Kong Police! Fung already lost the job he loved. He lost a leg. He had nothing left. I understand. Sorry, Sir! I don't think you do. We should be helping him. Not lying to him. He was your boyfriend. I wanted to help him. By pushing him off the cliff? To atone for his crime. The explosion at the hotel, based on prima facie evidence, he's likely to get a life sentence. But if he helped the Police take out Vendetta and stop the terrorist attack, we'll have a reason to make a plea to the judge. Or else, he'll always be... ...a wanted man. Atone for his crime? Use his life to save 100 other lives? That's what you call atoning for his crime? You're his buddy. You tell me. How can he ever go back to be the Poon Shing Fung we know? Tell me! The Poon Shing Fung we know, will risk his life to save others. Madam, Poon Shing Fung went inside a coffee shop. In that area, flyovers blocked the roadcams. The black vehicle across the street will pick you up. Madam, we lost the GPS signal. Probably from interference. But we still have audio. Where are we going? ""The Water Margin"" Blizzard, we meet at last! I'm Money. I'm Slave. Sniper. Blizzard, welcome back! Thanks. The Boss is worried about you. After you left the hospital, why didn't you contact us right away? When I woke up, I don't remember much. After I broke out of the hospital, I had the cops on my tail. I didn't want to get anyone in trouble. That's why I didn't make contact. You're always very careful. We have so much to learn from you. I'm sorry! I made a mistake and you had to fill in for me. I almost got you in trouble. You did a great job with the lighting ceremony. They're talking about the hotel explosion. The Boss is tied up. He can't meet with you. He told us to contact him after we picked you up. Blizzard, I'm glad you're back. Our plan will proceed as scheduled. Nothing will stop Resurrection Day. It's probably Ma Sai Kwan. Do a voice analysis and track the signal. Yes, Madam! I already told you Our minds are in sync and we're comrades with the same belief. Vendetta has not let me down. Not now, not ever. Now... Madam, we have voice confirmation. It's definitely Ma Sai Kwan. We have waited long enough for Davy. I have more good news. I just picked up Davy. Davy is here! Do we have the location? Still tracking. See? Yes! After Davy settles down, I'll come to you. Whatever you need, just tell Rhino. OK? We lost the signal. Do we have the location? No! The Boss has a present for you. It's the latest model. You're now a wanted man. You must be careful. Don't go home. The Police locked down the place and it will be heavily guarded. You should know by now, I'd rather die than betray a comrade. No wonder the Boss trusts you and never once doubted you'd be a rat. Let's roll! Out to the open sea! We just lost the voice signal. Here A toast to Doctor. Cheers! Doctor was a hero. But so what? Only we'd remember him. No one else would. Blizzard, you taught me I should place the index finger tip on the trigger of a sniper rifle for a better aim. I'll remember that. But when I pick up a rifle to do something meaningful, I want to go out with a bang. Whether anyone will remember me, I don't care. Maverick told us that being brave is the key to facing life. We all have to die. Yes! Be brave! A true genius will not be KO'd by this sick society. We must fight back! Cheers! Cheers! When I was in the hospital, what have you been doing? We followed your instructions and made bombs. Bombs? Yes! You and Maverick had it mapped out. The prelude to Resurrection Day. Good! Do you have the suspect who placed the bomb? CCTV captured a man wearing a mask who placed it around noon. Should be a lone wolf. 5 kg of C-4 could be deadly. The design of the bomb isn't complicated. But this device has an unusual direction. It's pointing down. We have cables and gas pipes underground. When it blows, the chain reaction will cause a regional airblast that can be disastrous. ""Good guys stay away"" It's the media. Get rid of the drone. Yes, Madam! The best is yet to come. ""Private number"" The phone is ringing. I'm picking up. ""Handsfree mode"" Hello? Calling EOD, what is Tung Sir doing? There's a phone on the bomb. Someone just called. Who? We don't know. I'll put it through. You must be Tung Cheuk Man, the EODB officer. Who are you? Just an ordinary citizen. Unlike you, Tung Sir, I'm not in the news. It's just a job. Cops are very different from civilians. I really want to know, if a cop and a civilian are both shot, who will you save first? I'm working. I don't have time to think. To! Scissors! Yes, Sir! Man. Find cover! Such precision! Stay back! Tung Sir! Your position is too dangerous. Pull out! My suit is bulletproof. Try to save To. Search sniper's location. Don't go out there! I heard you said your bomb suit can protect you. Let's see. Did you find him? No, Madam! Keep looking. Hurry! Sniper's location should be at my 5 or 6 oclock. Madam, out of range. Go! What is it? Police! Stay here. Bomb clear! To! Ambulance! To! To! Stay awake! To! Police! Drop your weapon! Hey! Hey! Sniper down! Place your men in deadly peril and they will survive. Leave them in dire straits and they're reborn. Salute! Ambulance! Hurry! To, look at me! To! Hang in there! Ambulance! To! Look at me! Look at me! Sir, let us take over. I missed you It breaks my heart. I want you to come home. Even though I don't remember who they were. I still feel bad. Where you took me was not my home. I'm a terrorist. Whose idea was it, lying to me about being an UC? Mine. Yours? If I said you were involved in 2 terrorist attacks with a total casualty of 29 dead and 91 seriously injured, how would you feel? How would you feel? But when I look at these dead colleagues, I begin to wonder... ...if my plan was a mistake. Don't blame yourself. You did nothing wrong. If I were in your shoes, I would have done the same. I went back and confirmed I'm a core member of Vendetta. Davy is not a person. It's a U.S. nuclear bomb developed during the Cold War. Davy Crockett, as one of the smallest nuclear weapons ever built, its destructive power is between 10 and 20 tons of TNT equivalent. Resurrection Day is the code name for an operation. The details of which are still unknown. I must carry on with the mission and I'll find out soon. We chose this path together. Even though I have only one leg, you must stick with me and see this through. You must be careful. I will. What was it like for us? You were never in love with me, but I can't tell if it's real or not. The Boss wants to see you. Calling Madam, the barge blew up. They took Poon Shing Fung away. Madam, we still have Poon Shing Fung's signal. He's probably meeting with Ma Sai Kwan. CTRU, let's roll. Hang back! Keep a 1 km distance. Madam, we lost the signal. Probably by a radio interference device. OK! Go! Boys, come on! Hurry up! Hurry up! ""The Water Margin"", never get bored from reading it. Vendetta is like the Liangshan Marsh. I'm Chao Gai and you're Song Jiang. I foot the bill, you come up with ideas upholding justice for Heaven. I just didn't expect our ending would be the same as ""The Water Margin"". Song Jiang accepted the Court's amnesty and betrayed his brothers. Is the prosthetic any good? The lady you were with works for CTRU. She was my ex-girlfriend. I'm a man on the run, she wanted me to turn myself in. We were childhood friends, comrades with the same beliefs. How can I possibly doubt you? By the way, how long have we known each other? I don't remember. I have amnesia. Amnesia? I'll have another go! That's enough! Stop bullying Ma Sai Kwan! We're playing with him. I will always remember how nice you were to me. Why did they punish you for helping someone? They didn't punish me for helping you, but for getting into a fight. But they hit you first. You were protecting yourself... ...and me. I want to give you something. Mastermind? It has 6 colors to choose from to be placed into 4 slots. You must guess the correct color and order. You lost. Let me see. I can't believe it. Wouldn't that be easier to guess? You never said you can use the same color. I like uniformity. I hate people who change. After high school, I went to the U.K. I sent you a Christmas card every year. But after a few years, you stopped writing back. Until one year, the Christmas card I sent was returned. ""Unable to Contact"" was written on the envelope. Then years later, I saw you in the newspaper, standing in front of a bomb with a big hole. You became an EODB officer. Right there and then, I was heartbroken. Until one day, I found out this system finally abandoned you. The world is sick! Do I have to make a bomb, then defuse it to prove myself? Listen to yourself! You're a ticking bomb. This is a society that everything is disposable after use, including human beings. When I read that message, I knew Blizzard is you. Anger is not enough. To turn this rotten system to ashes, we need to be together as one against all others, - break all of their wings and make sure it crashes. - Courier To see a new beginning rise behind the sun, we seek destruction. You finally came out from under that ""you got what you deserved"" mentality. But the price you paid is your leg. My dear friend, long time no see. I hope we can meet up and make some plans to stop this world from getting worse. Ma Sai Kwan? Betrayal is nothing new. Humans are full of weaknesses. But this operation is your design. How can you beat Vendetta? Who are you? I don't know who I am. I only wish to stop the terrorist attack. Davy you told me where to find it. Why did you betray yourself? Remember what you said? I don't remember. What? I want to stop the terrorist attack. You can't! I want to stop the terrorist attack. You cannot! I want to stop it! You designed Resurrection Day. Look! The world was beautiful. But now, it's incurable. All systems are like a tumor. If you have cancer, you need chemotherapy. Use radiation to kill all the cancer cells. Better than waiting for death. Waiting to die is a horrible feeling. Scrap it and start over. Place your men in deadly peril and they will survive. Leave them in dire straits and they're reborn. In the olden days, the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah and the world-engulfing flood. Today, we picked the date for Resurrection Day. We can't stop! I beg you! Stop the terrorist attack! OK? I'm begging you Please? Boss! We're ready to roll. Wait outside. Yes! I remember you said waiting to die is a horrible feeling. Now, I'll let you get a feel for that. ""New York World Trade Center (WTC), 5 Dead Thousands Injured"" International Finance Centre (IFC) ! We're blowing up IFC. I planned Resurrection Day. It was my plan. Where is the bomb? I don't remember. Calling Chan Sir, Vendetta plans to blow up IFC. We don't have details yet. Evacuate IFC at once and lock down the premises. One IFC has 4 floors underground, 38 floors above ground. Two IFC has 5 floors underground, 88 floors above ground. With a floor area of 436,000 cubic meters and 80 elevators, it'll take a while to find the bomb. Mon, get the tools. Yes, Sir! Everyone out! Yes, Sir! Follow me, everyone! Go Go Go! Everybody, hurry up! - Yes, Sir! - Let's go! They were so close. They have very limited resources, and parked the car bomb at the wrong place. In the end, they only blew a hole in the ground. What they failed to do, we'll make it right. Today is February 26. Resurrection Day is modeled after the 1993 car bombing of the WTC in New York on February 26. Back then, the terrorists parked the truck carrying the bomb in the North Tower parking garage. The target was the main column of the North Tower. The intention was to send the taller North Tower crashing into the lower South Tower. We learnt from that incident and decided to use C-4, which is destructive enough to bring down the main column of Two IFC. Two IFC would crumble towards the southwest and crush One IFC. Chan Sir, the bomb should be in the garage of Two IFC, near the main column on the southwest side. Contact the Buildings Department for the IFC building plan. Hurry! Yes, Sir! Tung Sir, here. This bomb is a combination device, made up of 4 components, with a pre-set permutation to stop the timer. Each component is one out of five. That's 625 combinations. You won't have time to disarm it. Madam, I'm in charge here. I'd like you to leave. You should both leave. Let me die alone. If you don't go to IFC, a lot of people will die. Pong Ling, 2 minutes. If I can't do it, I'll leave. Go! I'm Lun Ting Pong of EOD. Evacuate everyone within IFC vicinity. The mall, office building, MTR station and all nearby public space. Over! EOD, split up and look for the bomb in the parking lot! Hurry! Evacuate everyone in the mall. Hurry up! Due to an emergency, the mall will be closed. we need everyone to evacuate at once. Keep moving! Hurry! You said we should not save lives by risking our own. Saving lives is my job. I can be outside in 5 seconds. If I can't disarm the bomb, I can go for the lock. It's a 4-digit lock. No numbers. Red, yellow, blue, green, black and white. 6 colors. Choose 4 out of 6 colors. 1296 combinations. That's even harder. Mastermind! I like uniformity. I hate people who change. He really wants me to remember him. Go for the lock. Single color. I'll try yellow. Wrong. Blue. You never said you can use one color. Red! All red! Run! To IFC! To IFC! Time fuse 20 meters. We need 10 minutes to clear out. Relax! I did the Maths. All trains heading for Hong Kong will terminate at Kowloon Station. No train is allowed to enter Hong Kong Station. All trains heading for Hong Kong Whats happening? We take control here. If they use C-4 to blow up IFC, what about Davy Crockett? I will remember. I will remember. If nobody tries to be a hero, we'll all get out in one piece. Calling EOD, the main column on the southwest side is between parking spaces #150 and #200. Over! Roger! Split up to different levels. Look for parking spaces between #150 and #200. You two go down one level. Fat Sze, give me the tools. - Follow me! - This way! Excuse me Over here! Can't let them find the car. -You can't go in. -This is locked down. Hey! Fat Sze! Keep looking! Yes sir! Go! What are you doing? Stop the car! A car just ran the gate! Sir! Excuse me, this area has been sealed off. Everyone get out! Take the booth! Get on the ground! Get down! Everybody outon the floor, now! Get your heads down! Everybody get down! Open the gates. Hurry it up! Come on! Come on! Hurry it up! Tie them up! Let's go! Give me your hands! Shootout at Hong Kong Station. Alpha Team, stay! Beta Team, follow me across to Hong Kong Station L2. Hurry, get up. Move on! Move it! Shoot them! Stand right here! All cops, stay where you are! If you take a step forward, I will kill all the hostages. Stay back! Don't come in here! We will shoot the hostages! Cops, we will shoot everyone! Cops, stop! Cops stop, stay back! We will shoot you if you move forward. What's the status? EOD is looking for the bomb in the parking lot of Two IFC. Terrorists at Hong Kong Station occupied L2 and put the bomb on the train. I remember now. Resurrection Day is not just blowing up IFC, but also the core infrastructure of the HK Airport. They will hijack the Airport Express. The train has 8 cabins and will be split into 3 sections, each carrying a bomb. When it passes through major infrastructure, they will leave one section behind. The C-4 on the train will blow up Elements at the Kowloon Station and Tsing Ma Bridge. The engine will crash into the Hong Kong International Airport. Davy Crockett will be in the front. The impact from the head-on collision will trigger the wireless detonator, and set off all the bombs simultaneously. Davy Crockett will blow up the whole airport. The radioactive contamination will leave Chek Lap Kok in ruins, and unable to rebuild in at least 20 years. Don't move! Get down! The terrorists hijacked the train. Over. Any way we can intercept it? Over. The Tsing Yi Control Center should be able to. But Vendetta has taken over. Over. Chan Sir, there's a bomb on the train. Lock down the Tsing Ma Bridge and evacuate the airport and Airport Express. Over. Copy! Due to an emergency, everyone must leave the station at once! and evacuate to somewhere safe. Due to a serious incident, please leave the station immediately! Calling Tung Sir! We found the car bomb. It's clear. I don't care how, break into the Control Center and stop Ma Sai Kwan's train on the Tsing Ma Bridge. We move the car bomb out there, then blow up both ends of the bridge and let the train fall into the water. This is the only way to stop radiation diffusion and reduce casualties. Brother Fung. Sir, I'll go with you. No, you stay! Give your gear to Fung. We have C-4, time fuse, detonator and det cord in the back. The Tsing Ma Bridge is a suspension bridge. We split up and attach the C-4 to the 4 vertical cables on the Ma Wan side, then connect the det cord and time fuse and blow it up using the detonator. There's no gunpowder. Here! I'll go to the back and split the det cord into two sections. Be careful! Here Please follow instructions from ground personnel and leave the station at once. Pong Ling, we use a time fuse to detonate C-4 to blow up the bridge. But we must calculate the time we need to leave the bridge. If Davy Crockett goes off in the water, it'll cause a shockwave with a lethal range of 1 km. How long will it take the chopper to reach the safety zone? From when you board the chopper, it'll take 30 seconds. Stop Ma Sai Kwan's train in the middle of the bridge. We'll take over the Control Center ASAP and stop Ma Sai Kwan's train on the bridge. After you reach the safety zone, we'll re-start the train and let it fall into the water. Set the time fuse for 20 seconds. Calling Lee Sir, sniper ready. They're shooting at us! Find cover! They're shooting! I don't want to die! Get out of my way! Help! Get down! A train stopped at Kowloon Station. Pong, there's a bomb on the train. I don't care how, just move it. Copy! Chan Sir, is there a train at Hong Kong Station? Yes! On the other side of the tracks. Get me a train captain to teach me how to operate it. Done! Set the C-4 on the cables. Go! Yes, Madam! ""Kowloon Station"" Tung Sir, I'm pushing the train car from Kowloon Station towards Tsing Ma Bridge. Madam, we are ready. Three Two One Team B, action! Grab the hostages! Watch out for the hostages! Resurrection! Get the lights! Police! Calm down! Stop the train on Tsing Ma Bridge! I'll do it. - Evacuate the hostages. - Hurry! Search the scene. What happened? What's wrong? I can't control the train. The train is still moving. What happened? Check the control system. Hit by a stray bullet. Is there another way? No! Control Center is clear. But the control system is not working. We cannot stop Ma Sai Kwan. The detonator will be set up in 90 seconds. We can get off the bridge in 90 seconds. Ma Sai Kwan is 80 seconds away. I'll hurry! We have enough time to set the detonator, but not enough to reach the safety zone. Then you go ahead. No! We go together. I can do this alone. Why should two people die over this? Then why should you stay and not me? There's no turning back. You should know. Let me do this. Sorry Tung Sir, we need to clear out or we won't make it. Go ahead! I beg you! Buddy, goodbye! Pong Ling, he's still there. Fung! Fung! All set! All set! Attention, all units! Activate ""CBRN"" (Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear) emergency procedure right away! Hong Kong Observatory, activate the radiation monitoring system. Leisure and Cultural Services Department, close and evacuate all beaches. Hospital Authority, set up an emergency radiation treatment center. Fire Services, standby 24/7 with ambulances and ready to conduct search and rescue. Information Services Department, appeal to all citizens to watch out for TV and radio announcements for rescue preparations. Fung! I'll see you in the next life. Fung... ...remember my name is Pong Ling. In the next life If memory can be implanted, can you help me remove it? All of it? Except I'll get something to eat. Sure. Go ahead! Sorry! It was my fault. It's OK. I did it on purpose. What do you mean? No special meaning. I only want you to remember me. But I don't even know your name. How can I remember you? I'm Poon Shing Fung. EODB officer. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, - (WOMAN GROANING) - (BABY CRYING) CRUELLA: Oh, no. We're starting here? Okay. From the very beginning I've always made a statement. Not everyone appreciated that. That's unfortunate. CRUELLA: But I wasn't for everyone. Speaking of statements, here's one. That necklace is the reason I'm dead. But I'm getting ahead of myself. From an early age, I realized I saw the world differently than everyone else. Look! Well, that's not the pattern. You have to follow the pattern. There's a way of doing things. - That's ugly. - CRUELLA: Including my mother. That's cruel. Your name's Estella, not Cruella. CRUELLA: It wasn't her I was challenging, it was the world. But of course my mother knew that. That's what worried her. Remember, you belong here as much as anyone. They're lucky to have you. Agreed. Hey. What do you say to Cruella when she tries to get the better of you? Thank you for coming, but you may go now. Good. Now say goodbye to her. Goodbye, Cruella. And wear the hat. I don't need the hat. Well, be polite. And good. And friendly. CRUELLA: How does the saying go? ""I am woman. Hear me roar."" Well, that wasn't much of a thing back in 1964, but it was about to be. Hi, my name's Estella. Look. A skunk's got loose in the building. BOY: Nice jacket. Hi, I'm Anita. Estella. Ignore them. Just did. But it might not last. CRUELLA: ""Ignore them""? Didn't I just say, ""Hear me roar""? STUDENTS: (CHANTING) Fight! Fight! Fight! CRUELLA: That didn't sit well with some people. This is a blot on your copybook. CRUELLA: Okay, that didn't sit well with a lot of people. Enough. She deserved it! CRUELLA: But I found friends in unlikely places. ESTELLA: Hello. Like this guy. There's a dog? Buddy. I found him. CRUELLA: And not this guy. Her. Anita Darling. What a fabulous name. - (STUDENTS LAUGHING) - (GASPS) You could say I pretty much roared my way through all of primary school. Almost. Well, I think it's clear what happens now. Estella, you are expelled... I'm withdrawing her from your school. I'm expelling her. It's too late because I withdrew her first, so that can't be on her record. I'd said expelled. I'd already said it. Hadn't. Didn't. And might I say, your school seems to turn out horrible children with no creativity or compassion. Or genius. You're out. (SCOFFING) (LOUDLY) Out! CRUELLA: Being a genius is one thing. Raising a genius, however, does come with its challenges. London, here we come! Well, we don't really have a choice. You have no school. It's nothing to celebrate. (SIGHS) Well... Can't be a fashion designer in a small town anyway. Can we go here? Regent's Park? Perfect. When we get to the city, first thing we'll do, we'll go to the fountain, and we'll have a cup of tea and we'll start planning how to make this London thing work. Why are you in your best dress? I need to make a stop on our way to the city. Just ask a friend for a little help to get us on our feet. What friend? Well, a friend because of the situation that we're in. I'll be less trouble from now on, Mum. I promise. CRUELLA: I meant it when I said it. When a girl like me makes a promise like that, you don't take her to a place like this. What is this place? Wear it. It looks good. Looks better without, I think. Be yours one day. It's a family heirloom. - Will you mind it for me? - Really? Come on, Buddy. Uh, Estella. Serious voice. Stay in the car. I won't be long. Mum! I need you to lie low. Lie low while wearing a hat? Exactly. Love you. Love you more. - (SIGHS) - (BUDDY GROWLS SOFTLY) Don't worry, she'll be back soon. CRUELLA: I did try to lay low. Is that fur and chiffon? In the one gown? But as you can see, I broke the promise. Just a little. WOMAN: I am. I'm sure it'll be quite extravagant. It usually is, isn't it? JOHN: Go to the east garden. I'll see what I can do. CRUELLA: I figured while Mum was busy seeing her mysterious friend, I'd just take a little peek. The problem was, that little peek pretty much blew my mind. I had no idea where I was or what it was. I just knew that for the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged. Buddy, unfortunately, did not. Buddy! No! Got ya. Keep the hat on, before anyone sees that. CRUELLA: I could've blamed Buddy for what happened next. I just need a little help, just to get us on our feet. CRUELLA: But the truth is, I did escalate things. - (CROWD GASPS) - Oh, my goodness! SERVER: Oh, crumbs! And I will keep my mouth shut, and I will never come back here. - Mum! - CATHERINE: She's my life. - (WHIMPERS) - (DOGS BARKING) No! CRUELLA: There are no words. BARONESS: There's been the most dreadful accident. CRUELLA: It was my fault. BARONESS: Police Commissioner Weston! A woman... (SOBS) She was threatening me, demanding money. I... CRUELLA: I had killed my mother. I think they were chasing someone. Search the grounds! CRUELLA: And in that moment... COMMISSIONER: Search the grounds! CRUELLA: ...the best I could think to do was run. And I ran for a long time. I made it to London after all. Regent's Park. But no tea. (VOICE BREAKING) It's all my fault, Buddy. No Mum. I never should've gone in. I was an orphan. My necklace. Sad story. Genius girl turns into stupid girl who gets her mother killed and ends up alone. But a new day brings new opportunities or at least a couple of petty thieves. Horace... BOY: Sir, please could you spare some change? No, sorry. CRUELLA: ...and Jasper. Morning. (GASPS) Stay back! Horace was generally annoying. Ow! Go back to your family, little girl! Jasper was the insightful one. She has no family. CRUELLA: Which was also annoying. And Wink was just plain friendly. Again, annoying. - Buddy! - (WHISTLE BLOWING) - Oi! - Come on, Horace. But they were a better option than being in jail. Stop! Police! Oi, you little scallywags! That was close. - I think we lost her. - (GRUNTS) Ya think? Where are we? So, what's your story? Where are your parents? My mum's dead. CRUELLA: I skipped over the part where I killed her. I think you should stay here, be a part of our gang. (WHISPERS) She should what? What, what, what? This has not been discussed. It's being discussed now. And we could use a girl to look innocent and be a distraction. I wanted to be a fashion designer, not a thief. You don't got that many options. Just us. CRUELLA: He was right. I was a fugitive. - (ESTELLA SOBBING) - Is she crying again? Her mum died. You remember what that's like. And there was one thing I knew they'd be looking for. Cripes! I need to dye my hair. I don't know, I quite like it. CRUELLA: Granted, being a thief is not exactly a mother's dream, but she was gone. Don't worry, we're just getting started. There's lots more bad things coming... I promise. Let's go, Buddy. We're on! Before I knew it, ten years had passed. You could even say we had made a home for ourselves. Horace! Heads-up! Two minutes! It's stoppage time. CRUELLA: We were like a family. Horace, let's go! - A family that's good at... - Get dressed! ...stealing stuff. I'm frightfully sorry. Do you know if Piccadilly is the next... CRUELLA: Really, really, really good. - (BELL DINGS) - Oh, this is me. We expanded our business. I designed fabulous disguises. We'd steal. There you go, madam. I'd design. We'd steal. Not your dog! We are not coming back here! Design. It was a beautiful operation. - (SHOWER RUNNING) - (MAN VOCALIZING) I got to do what I love, and we were reaping the rewards. But as good as things were, I felt I was meant for more in this life. That my mum would've wanted more for me. I just didn't know what. Hey! Psst! (WHISPERING) What are you doing? - (SHOWER CONTINUES RUNNING) - (MAN VOCALIZING) Just bored. Bored? Are you kidding? I found a tiny TV. Japanese fellow asleep on the bed. Uh, excuse me, who are you three? Run. Good Lord! MAN: Oi! Thieves! JASPER: Two, three! JASPER AND HORACE: (SINGING) Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Estell-la-la-la-la! Happy birthday to you! And me and Jasper And Wink and Buddy This is the nicest birthday in... In a while. Not for Judy. - Who's Judy? - It doesn't matter. It is no big deal. She just... Oh, Judy. ...might be hungry. - Make a wish. - Thanks, guys. Thanks, Judy. What's this? This is an offer of employment from Liberty of London. Entry-level position. Oh, I hope it's a burger place, right? No, it's the most fashionable department store in the city. How did you do this? Pulled a couple of strings. I love Liberty! Yeah, I know you do. I see you look at it every time we pass. Now, I might have padded out your CV a bit. As in, completely. Invented it. We've all done it. Yeah, we've all done it. Everyone does it. Invented a few references. If they ask you how you know Prince Charles, you just say it's a polo thing. Right. Happy birthday. HORACE: ""Polo thing."" So, what is the angle? There is no angle, other than Estella living her dream. - (CHUCKLING) Right. Okay. - Yeah. What is it really? What's the angle? No, there is... All right, I'll tell you what, the angle is that Estella is way too talented to be doing grifts with the likes of me and you. Thanks, Jasper. It's all right. Mum, I got my chance. The one I always wanted. Trust me, I'm going to keep my head down and make it. Cheers. CRUELLA: (SIGHS) Liberty of London. It was the pinnacle of fashion in the '70s. They carried all the best designers. And now I worked there. Now, you mentioned the scarf as well. WOMAN: On Tuesday? I have it right in front of me here. I told him to be very specific about what I wrote. Ah, excuse me, sir. I had a thought about the front window... I gave you your job description. Don't go outside the boundaries of your engagement. Please. - (INHALES SHARPLY) - Not now. - Ah! Sir... - Not now. No, no, no. Not now. Ah! (CHUCKLES) Sir, I just wanted to say, I really am a dab hand with a needle if Alterations could use anything. Why are you talking and not cleaning? Did you do all the bathrooms according to the regulations I gave you? - Soap, water, mop, bleach, polish? - I did. - In that order? - Yes. But Alterations, you wouldn't... regret it. - Hey. - Hey! Hi. You forgot your lunch. Thank you. No. What? I'm not letting you in that window, so you can try and crack the safe. - That's not the angle? - No. There is no angle. There's no angle. What do you mean, there's no angle? Come on, Wink! There's no angle. JASPER: Horace. Thanks for lunch. Bye, Wink. Really? Perfect. I feel sad that you think that looks good. What? (LOUDLY) I feel sad you think that looks good. Afternoon. Lovely hat. Whatever covers your neck more. You have... a circular slice of banana on your cheek. Other side. - My office. Now! Now, now. - Okay. Before you fire me, I have something to say. Clean my office, top to bottom. And, uh, when you come in tomorrow, try and remember to bring a brain. That seems uncalled for. I believe that lurking underneath that starchy, half-size-too-small, bum-clencher of a suit lies a kind man who wants to give a brilliant kid another shot. (CHUCKLES) Clean, now! I just can't leave you looking like that. It would be cruel. Why'd you go to sleep in a window? Who's... What... Oh... Oh, but seriously, how much better do you look? (HUMMING) No! No! Hello. Out! Out! Oh, farts. (GRUNTS) Come with me. Leave the bag. - Thousand apologies. - (HORACE GROANING) Horace, no! I'm calling the police, vandal. She's coming! The Baroness. She's out front. - What? - The Baroness! She's coming! No! Hello. Is there a, uh, back way out, or... (PANTING) The Baroness. The fashion designer! I want to see her. Find the girl. (GASPS) That's her. Estella, they're distracted. - (SHUSHING) - Let's go! Baroness. Outside. That window display. I'm so sorry. I can explain that. You're right, time to go. GERALD: Sorry, Baroness... Get her. She's the vandal who messed up the whole new window display. Hello. We're dealing with it. All right, easy, easy, easy! So she works here? Oh, no, no. She was fired. Yeah. We try to give these wretches a chance, but, um, breeding. (SNORTS) Need I say more? So she doesn't work here? (CLICKS TONGUE) Sorry. I'm not convinced I know... You're sweating, and I can smell you. Brilliant. Thank you. You. Grubby girl. Yes? Jeffrey, card. Card? You're hired. This address. 5:00 a.m. Don't be late. Teeth. Teeth. BARONESS: You're a fool. That girl put together a better window display than I've seen here for 10 years. Hear, hear! You were right, this is a very good shop. God, it's all so depressing. She liked my window, Jasper. She liked my window! I'm happy for you. It's all thanks to you. No. So... (SIGHS) this was the angle, then? CRUELLA: It's funny how those happy accidents can change the whole direction of your life. Although, looking back, ""happy"" may be the wrong word. Ah, you. Quickly, come on! Right, okay. Come along. Up here. Silence! My last show was a triumph. Shall I read to you from Tattletale? ""Baroness designs stunned with her reinvention of the A-line - ""with a bias cut and higher line that... - (COUGHS) ""...reshapes the silhouette in such an audacious way ""the audience broke into rapturous applause at first sight. ""She really is a genius."" I'll read that bit again, shall I? ""She really is a genius."" A triumph. Take a moment to revel in it. Oh, that's enough. New show. We must be perfect. Now go. Window girl. Grab a mannequin, some fabric, and throw something together. The Baroness needs looks. Looks. Right. It's foolish. Unhinged. Well, you're fired. Pasty, pasty, pasty. Hmm. - (GASPS) - Why are you speaking? I think you nicked me. Just... Fabrics! Can you get me a red like that? Oh. Welcome to Second Time Around, I'm Artie or Art, as in ""work of."" Wow! You look incredible. (SIGHS) I hear that all day, so I guess it's true. How does that look go on the streets? Mmm, some abuse and insults, of course. But I like to say that normal is the cruelest insult of them all and at least I never get that. (SIGHS) I couldn't agree more. Look around, Cinderella. I have everything a girl or boy could ever want. If you can dream it, I can dress it. Dior, 1955, amazing. Chanel, 1950. Spring collection. Ah, you know your gowns. You and I are going to be very good friends, Artie. Baroness, '65, in the window. Winter collection. I noticed that. Grubby girl, get me lunch. Soy salmon, lemon-zest risotto, cucumber sliced into two-inch diagonals at an eighth of an inch width sprinkled with seven leaves of parsley, shredded, not torn. Right. As the department stores that stock your range, we thought perhaps we could give you some input. Feedback. Oh, great. I'll start, shall I? My feedback. You're short, you're fat, you smell like an anchovy, you're color-blind, but you pretend you aren't. You're a man who can't take responsibility. Your revenues are down 15%, your foot traffic by 12 and a half. Yes, I do my own research. Your store hasn't been refurbished since the Blitz. People don't know whether to buy a frock or duck and cover. And most of the funds meant for refurbs are being embezzled by you, stashing them in Swiss bank account number 32254766 to be precise. That's me. Your turn. I'm all ears. Good day. - (DOOR OPENS) - Imbeciles. Lunch, now. Oh. Finally, someone competent. Whoa! And someone not. This is my lawyer, Roger. Although he spends most of his time playing piano in a dingy little bar, actually, he's a good lawyer. Hi. Hi. Piano's nice. Yes. Time for my nine-minute power nap. Box up my lunch, Estella. It could do with a lining. You could use tulle to puff it out, give it some body. That's what I just said. Baroness. Keep up, Estella. Jewels. And, Estella, make the bodice pencil thin. Estella, did you make it pencil thin? All right, how do I look? - Fabulous. - Well, I know that. Show me. Mmm. How would you have done it? Hmm. I think you're... something. Come along. I made this. The Baroness said she thinks I'm something. I think that's good. Everything's going so well, Mum. I'm really trying to be the Estella that you wanted. Mostly. It's working. I just wish you were here to see it. BARONESS: There's something about it that irritates me and I always trust my instincts. I thought maybe if you tighten the silhouette... Oh, you thought, did you? I think it's better. Actually, it is. Your necklace. Oh. Family heirloom. Funny story, actually. An employee once stole it. No, she did not. (HESITATES) Sorry. Slight tone delivery problem. I meant... ""No. She did not."" Did she work for you? Mmm. Once. Years before. She stole this, was stupid enough to come back and then she fell off a cliff and died. How terrible. Yes, it was, actually. It was during my winter ball and her death really overshadowed the whole thing. Time for my nine-minute power nap. Who was the woman? Not really the point of the story. The story's about how lucky I am, but anyway, she had a kid. Kid's a snowflake. Special, blah-blah-blah. It was a basic shakedown situation actually. Maybe she... Maybe she just really loved her kid. Maybe she only had one person to take care of and she failed dismally. - (CLEARS THROAT) - Speak. Baroness, we have that meeting at the Ritz. Oh, for heaven's sakes. Necklace. Roger, shoes. Don't touch the ankle. ROGER: Yes, sorry. It's in. BARONESS: Come along. CRUELLA: My mother hadn't failed dismally, I had. And I wasn't going to fail her again. Told you, she always comes here. Oi. You all right? She called my mum a thief. Said she failed as a mother. What? Your mum? She knew your actual mum? Yeah, it turns out that was her party we were at. Mum worked for her once. I dropped the necklace as I was running away. She must've found it. It's mine. So I'm taking it back. - Taking it, as in... - Stealing it. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... the angle. Her Black and White Ball, that's where we'll do it. It's our biggest job ever. Oi, Horace, attention. ESTELLA: We need to know their security setup. Power nap, nine minutes. ESTELLA: Where the cameras are. Where the guards are posted. And what the schedules are. We need to know every detail and every blind spot. (IN ENGLISH) Okay, the toilet's just on the left, and then go straight down to the end. Thanks. ESTELLA: Then, all we need to do is disable the security system, bypass the cameras, open the safe, steal the necklace during the biggest party of the season. So many people, her security will be stretched to the limit and just to be sure, a distraction, where I get the key to the keypad and safe. Right, so what is the distraction? I've discovered she likes to throw women who offend her sensibilities out of her parties. - Old women. Women in gold. - Ow! - Sad women. - (WOMAN GASPS) - Women who carry poodles. - (GASPS) But also stunningly dressed women who pull the focus off of her. What about one of the elderly broads? Me, Horace. I will be the distraction. All right. Besides, wreaking havoc at galas is my personal specialty. Well, I don't know about that. But here's a problem... Won't she recognize you? That's a good point. - I guess. - And when that happens, won't you lose your job? It's not on the board. - A job I think you love. - Are you thinking? I mean, she sees you're talented, right? Yes. Yes. Well, maybe... Maybe you don't need the necklace. Maybe... Mate, come on! It's the angle. - It's just a necklace. - I want it back! She's the boss. And you're right. You're right. She will recognize me. So Estella can't go to the ball, but I know someone who can. HORACE: Right, let's do it. Yeah. Let's go and ruin someone's day. You mean the Baroness? Obviously, I mean the Baroness. Right. Why? Who did you think I... No, you said ""someone."" - Someone could be anyone... - Let's just do this, Horace. Not tonight, son. Well, you know what? They said it was an emergency. This is a private event. Kind of vermin I deal with, they don't wait for an invitation. What they do is, they get in, they bite posh people who then froth at the mouth, their eyes spin in the back of their heads and then the posh people die. That's a beautiful story, mate. I almost welled up, yeah? Freeze. Freeze. Whatever you do, don't turn around. - (SNARLING) - (SCREAMING) Well, don't just stand there! Get in and get him out! I told you not to turn around. And wash your hands. Heck of a rat, yeah? The size of a dog. But it's a rat. Miss Anita Darling. ANITA: Baroness. I'm so grateful you've given Tattletale an exclusive tonight. Not apparently grateful enough to observe the dress code. No color. Well, my pen must have leaked. It's tools of my trade. BARONESS: No one is interested in what you write, my dear. Just in how I look. You look ravishing, Baroness. Master of understatement, as usual. Here's... to me. GUESTS: To the Baroness! Do you have a light? Get her. Come on, Wink. I'm a wee bit nervous. This doesn't have to be a scene. It really, really does. (CHUCKLES) - (GEORGE GROANS) - (ALL GASP) My arm. I think it's broken. Is there a doctor? - (GROANS) - Oh, no, actually it's fine. I'd like to remind you all that I'm doing this in heels. Ratbane! Abort! They can see you on the cameras. Abort. What? There are six of you, so obviously you'll win, but the first two of you to arrive are going to get very badly hurt. Initiate plan B. No, no, no! Oh! Oh! Look at that one! No. Get out! My wires! So, discuss amongst yourselves who that is, hmm? There we are. (GRUNTS) No, no, no. You hideous freak. (WHISPERS) I didn't mean that, Wink. JASPER: (ON WALKIE-TALKIE) All right, we're good. - (GROANS) - Oh! I'm so sorry. Hang on! We haven't started yet, darling. - (GROANS) - (ALL EXCLAIM) Is that two? I lost count. Oh, for heaven's sake, just bring her to me. - (BARKS) - Oi. Shh. You're supposed to be dead! That's a bit much. Nothing to see here. Horace, how's it going? How's it going? Well, I... Well, I'd say badly. Oh, no. Who are you? You look vaguely familiar. I look stunning. I don't know about familiar, darling. Your hair, is it real? Black and White Ball. I like to make an impact. Right. What was your name? Cruella. - Oh. - Mmm. That's quite fabulous. And you designed this? You did, actually. 1965 collection. Oh, no wonder I love it, it's mine. I fixed it. Oh, sit. Do, I insist. I'm intrigued, and that never happens. Yes. Aren't they gorgeous? And vicious. It's my favorite combination. What do you want? I mean, you clearly wanted to get my attention. I want to be like you. You're a very powerful woman. Let me give you some advice. If you need to talk about power, you don't have it. Well, I don't have it, which is why I need to talk about it, which is why I'm here. Am I going to have to catch you up a lot, or can you keep up? You're funny. It's not just rats. There's mice, lizards... Raccoons. There's a whole mess of different kinds of... Oh, that's a hybrid. Where are you from? Oh. Well, um... Up... north. Well, sort of. It's a bit south, really, of north, which is basically west. All right, that's enough. I've loved our little chat, but I'm afraid that now I'm going to have to have you arrested, um, for trespassing. Oh. (CHUCKLES) Is that a rat? - (BARKING) - (SCREAMING) Oh, my God! Get it off! Get it off! Get off! Someone's stolen my necklace. (GRUNTS) Later, boys. Now it's a party! That dog. Stop! Thief! You're the bravest rat I've ever known. Oh, we need that! Well, here's hoping there's a plan C. Why, what's plan C? Well, what I'm saying is, ""Is there a plan C?"" - Yeah, but... - (TIRES SCREECH) Get in! Yeah. - (WINK BARKS) - A bit quicker! You're a dog! Whoa. Didn't know you knew how to drive. - Whoa... - I don't. HORACE: There's a car! All right. Stop the car! - (PANTING) - JASPER: What's going on? Hey, hey! What are you doing? Where's she going? The Baroness killed my mother. What? What are you talking about? Her whistle, she called the dogs on her, she was... It wasn't my fault. She killed her. Like she was nothing. HORACE: Oh, blimey. CRUELLA: They say there are five stages of grief. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Well, I'd like to add one more. Revenge. We should lay low. Yeah. That was a bit much last night. (SCOFFS) You think? I fell into a cake. Morning, boys. Morning. So, let's begin. You're not gonna kill her, are ya? It's not part of the current plan, but we might need to be adaptable. So, that's a no? If you heard a ""no,"" it is. Now, the necklace. One of the Dalmatians ate it. Not sure which one, so you'll need to kidnap all of them. All right, sorry. Slow down. What? What are we... Darling, if I'm going to need to repeat myself a lot, this isn't going to work out. Why you still talking like that? Grift's over. The necklace went in one end, yes? It's going to come out the other. That's how it works. And what about breakfast? Which is now on the floor. What's the rest of the plan? Where are you going? Need-to-know basis. JASPER: But that's not how we usually... - ...work. - That was rude. Yeah, but it's her mum, innit? We gotta cut her some slack. Help her out. Well, it's not seeming like a lot of fun. - My Krispies are on the floor. - Yeah, I know, I know. Let's just get the dogs. Anita Darling, my darling. Estella, it's been so long. You know, I kept staring at you at the party, and then it came to me. That's Estella from school. It's not Estella. That's the past. I'm Cruella. So you go to parties and you take pictures and you print gossip? That's your job? Yes, well. Not as fun as it sounds. Oh, it doesn't sound fun. It sounds useful. Oh. I'd like to start my own label. Why don't we work together to create some buzz for this old rag that you continually fill with that old hag? You have that glint in your eye. What glint? Well, I'm starting to remember that you have a bit of an extreme side. Well, then you remember what fun that is? Now, I want you to help me tell them who I am. You notice how some dog owners look a lot like their dogs? No. I've never noticed that. What about now? All right, let's have a bit of professionalism, please, Horace. We got a job to do, all right? Wink is a very likable dog. I'm not sure this plan will work. It'll work. Remember, Wink, they can smell fear. - (RINGS) - (DOG GROWLS) Settle, Genghis. MAN: Oi! Told you it'd work. How can you not love this face? It's you. It is. And you're reading about me. And you're in my shop. It's me, (WHISPERS) Estella. Oh, my. My, my, my. You look amazing. You certainly made a splash. I'm just getting started, darling. And I need help. I want to make art, Artie... and I want to make trouble. You in? I do love trouble. HORACE: I'm not the enemy! Stop that! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, now. It's all right. Hey! Hey, hey! Stop that! Hey! - (DOGS BARKING) - Hey! Stop! Hey! Oh, come on! Those aren't yours! You got them. Artie, boys. Boys, Artie. Artie will be working downstairs. He actually knows something about fashion. Dogs are very aggressive. CRUELLA: Well, you have to walk them, feed them. Get that necklace out. Yeah, well, can't you walk 'em as well? There's no ""I"" in team. Well, there is an ""I"" in imbecile. Go! Hey! No, no, no, you can't talk to us like that. We're helping you here. So don't. Oh. (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) Mummy and Daddy are fighting. I'll, uh, set up downstairs. You stop it. Chill. Just chill. Come on, dogs. Regent's Park it is. You could be more polite is all. I don't have time. I have to go to work. I'm a designer now. Seriously? Keep your enemies close. Voil! Cruella was in a box a long time, now Estella can be the one who makes guest appearances. Everyone is laughing at me. Well, they say all press is good press, Baroness. Although they have focused rather on the rats. Did you happen to notice her hair? Coincidence. Apparently all the young people are doing it now. Thank you, John. You're such an enormous... help. - I do my best. - Mmm. She wants you, hurry up. Come on. Ah. Here she is. Late. Grab a pad. (WHISPERS) Excuse me. CRUELLA: Fashion fact. The pinnacle of every London fashion year is the spring collection. Excuse me. My spring collection. I need 12 pieces, and I have... Let me count. CRUELLA: I was going to take the things she loved most... her business, her status... Zero. I need ten pieces that work by 3:00 a.m. CRUELLA: ...her confidence. Go. Thank you. Gratitude's for losers. Oh. Good advice, thanks. What did I just say? - Uh, don't thank you, so... - (PHONE RINGING) Got it. Thank you. - Go. - Going. So, I'll just... Mmm? What do you mean, the dogs have gone? Well, find them! Horace. Game's on. Oh, tournaments... Oh! You're kidding me! You animals! I sleep on that thing. I'm watching the game, forget it. Oh, Tottenham fans. So you're not all bad then. Two minutes. Necklace? No. But silence. That's a start. And of course, ""Thank you for doing all my dirty work, guys."" ""Hey, don't worry about it, we're a team."" REPORTER: Baroness! Over here! ""Cruella."" Cruella. What sort of a name is that anyway? Okay. A proper competitor. I'll just have to destroy her as we have so many before. Find her. And, Roger, find out everything about her. I'm more a lawyer than a detective, I... Yes, I'll do that. - (CAMERAS CLICKING) - (CROWD GASPING) We have no signature piece. And this Cruella person is everywhere. I want ideas. Estella, what've you got? You seem upset. My dogs are missing, my necklace has been stolen and this Cruella creature is... This show has to be the best. Can I get you some cucumber? Thinly sliced. Go. And get your dried-up, desiccated little brain working. Of course. And thank you. Yes, go to lunch, you lazy fools. Hmm. What? Hey! Mmm. Oh, Estella, I am surprised at you holding out on me. But I was on my lunch break in a public space. Yes, I own the alley. Really? You can own alleys? Alleys, designs, people, their souls. Check your employment contract. Well, I seem to have found my new signature piece. How do you like it? We need to sue her, for defamation, false imprisonment, vandalism. Something. Well, having been through the statute and talked to the police, I don't know we have a legal avenue for... I need you to stop talking, Roger. You do? So I have a gap to fire you. There's a gap. You're fired. CRUELLA: Roger always blamed me for getting him fired, but the real reason Roger was fired is because... - Hmm. - ...he's Roger. You'll need more than eyeliner, you plain little thing. You do, however, have an eye for a good shot. Baroness. Who is she? And more importantly, where is she? I don't know. Did you just lie to me? I... No, I... - Don't cry. - (SCOFFS) I'm not. You will. JASPER: Getting anything? (GROANS) Come on! - Nothing? - Nothing! You know, I'm worried about her. - (DALMATIANS BARKING) - What, Estella? Yeah. Oh, she's just playing a part for the grift. Rude part. Hey! Stop that! Where's the beading for the dress? Ordered. Just waiting on this idiot delivery man. Oh, good day to you, missy. Got some fashion items that are most fashionable. Thank you, most handsome delivery man. It's... Stunning. Hmm. I've done it again. Let's go make history. I need a drink. Estella, come. Give it to me, for heaven's sake. - (CORK POPS) - (CHUCKLES) Go. Here's to me. Who the hell else would I drink to? To me? For creating your signature piece? You're helpful to me, is all. As soon as you're not, you're dust. Inspiring talk. Thank you. You can't care about anyone else. Everyone else is an obstacle. You care what an obstacle wants or feels, you're dead. If I had cared about anyone or thing, I might have died like so many brilliant women with a drawer full of unseen genius and a heart full of sad bitterness. You have the talent for your own label. Whether you have the killer instinct is the big question. I hope I do. Hmm. Correct response. Well done. We just have to get rid of this... Cruella person, don't you think? Hmm. I guess you must hate her. Honestly? I'm conflicted. She is good. Bold and brilliant. But she has made it me or her... and I choose me. (SIGHS) Well, this guy's a bit of a blanket. What about... this? Really? (EXHALES) We're gonna have to get invasive. JASPER: It's risky. They gotta know we broke in, Cruella said. - Yeah, she did, didn't she? - (MUNCHING LOUDLY) Yeah, I'm getting a little tired of Cruella. Oh, yeah. What's going on? She tried to break in last night. Who did? Cruella. Well, it makes sense. It's a stunning, ludicrously expensive gown. Cruella could never afford to make it. Hmm. But Cruella has no shame. She may steal my creation. I mean, that's a very good idea, right, if you were... her? Night. Get some sleep. Big day tomorrow. - Play nice, guys. - (TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) Night. What? I miss Estella. Goal! They really would make fabulous coats. JASPER: The dogs? I'm joking. You know what I miss? The Jasper who had a sense of humor. (SCOFFS) Right. You know, we've all had bad things happen to us. Me, him, you. But we've always been there for each other. That's all I'm asking. Is it so hard to back me up? No. Not Estella, that's easy, but to help Cruella, it's a nightmare. And there's that understatement thing you do. Cruella gets things done. Estella does not. And I have things to do. So if you're done chatting. And by ""if,"" I mean you are. I'll allow it. When Estella arrives, escort her to my office and hold her there. Very good. Although I think you're wrong. It's not her. Do I pay you for your opinions or for your obedience? Well, are you asking my opinion? I'll see it's done. Speak. What do you mean, it's stuck? The guests are already arriving. - (CRACKLING) - Oh! There's something wrong with the lock, Your Ladyship. I don't care what you have to do, get it open! That little... HORACE: Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... Cruella! It's got a good beat. The music. She killed my dogs. And made a coat. - (MUSIC ENDS) - (CROWD CHEERING) POLICEMAN: Oi! Get out! Come on! Oh, how lovely of her to thank us for our work. Yeah, real gracious, wasn't she? After all we've done for her. Whatever happened to that cute little girl crying on a bench? She's gone, mate. We should've left her on that park bench. Madam, welcome. - Mmm. Hello. - Anything I can get you, please? - Oh, uh, two lamb korma. - Okay. One tandoori chicken, and rice all round. No problem. No problem. A fashion riot in Regent's Park broke out today. Cruella, some call her a designer, - others a vandal. - Hmm. Questions are being raised over whether her coat was real Dalmatian. Madam, are you celebrating? Oh, indeed I am. The queen is dead! Long live the queen. Cruella. Wow. You really are a psycho. Why, how nice of you to say. You showed promise, as did Estella. Oh, am I late for work? Gee whiz, boss, how was the show? This is between us. Let Jasper and Horace, imbeciles that they are for letting you follow them, let them go. Oh, I shall. They're going to jail. CRUELLA: For what? Dognapping? Your murder. No one will believe that. Well, I'll have to add your charred body to the mix to help the believability factor. Almost. - (GRUNTS) - (HORACE GROANS) GUARD: Come on, you. Come on. Oh, that's nice. You're going to kill me because I upstaged you? Uh-huh. I know you killed my mother. You're going to have to be more specific. What? Who exactly? Just narrow it down for me. On a cliff. You called your dogs on her. Okay. Now I'm with you. Oh, that's why you're peeved. Hence this little show. I'm gonna kill you. And your dogs. I'm waiting. Gents, will you let me go for a moment? Come on. I'm sure she's a terrible boss. - (CRUELLA CHUCKLES) - Enough. Goodbye, Cruella. Dogs. Bad dog, Genghis. I'll tip off the press. I'd love them to know that you went out in a blaze of glory. - (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) - Hold it there. Up there. Move back! It's still a dangerous scene. Please, I need you to move back. REPORTER 1: (ON TV) Breaking news, Cruella, best known for upstaging the Baroness in the fashion world, has died tonight. REPORTER 2: London's fashion provocateur has died. REPORTER 1: The Baroness and Cruella had been going head-to-head... REPORTER 2: The Baroness' competition has gone up in flames. REPORTER 3: Cruella, a shining star in London's West End fashion scene has tragically died tonight in a warehouse fire. What? Tea, Miss Cruella? Why am I alive? Because I dragged you out of the smoke and flames before they consumed you. I have something for you. You found it? In the fire. I can assure you it's been, uh, thoroughly bleached. May I show you something? - I didn't know it had a key. - (BUDDY WHINES) JOHN: Mmm-hmm. What's it to? This. The Baroness has a kid? You. May I walk you through it? The Baron was a sweet old guy. The Baroness, on the other hand, she's a true narcissist. So when she found out she was pregnant... I'm pregnant. JOHN: ...she wasn't exactly thrilled. The Baron was delighted. So much so that he surprised her by giving her a family heirloom. She took the necklace, but she had other plans for you. CRUELLA: Stop. You keep saying ""you."" JOHN: You are her daughter. I was there when you were born. The Baron was away on business, and she ordered me to do the unthinkable. You know what to do. It was a diabolical request. I knew I needed to protect you. But how? - (BABY CRYING) - Then I saw Catherine, the sweetest woman who ever lived. She saved you. The Baroness said the child had died. The Baron, he, uh, wasted away. The point I'm making is, you are the rightful heir to the Baron's entire fortune. The mansion, the title. Everything. That psycho cannot be my mother. No. POSTMAN: Oi! So this is a confusing day. My nemesis is my real mother and she killed my other mother. I guess you were always scared, weren't you, that I'd be a psycho like my real mum? Hmm? That explains all the ""tone it down, try and fit in"" stuff. Love me into shape, I suppose, was the plan. And I tried. I really, I tried because I loved you. But the thing is... I'm... not sweet Estella, try as I might. I never was. I'm Cruella, born brilliant, born bad and a little bit mad. (CHUCKLES) I am not like her. I'm better. Anyway, must dash. Much to avenge, revenge and destroy. But I do love you. Always. (CHUCKLES SADLY) COMMISSIONER: The boys are locked up, but we have a problem. BARONESS: I don't pay you for problems. We didn't find her body. What are you talking about? It's on the TV, the radio. Well, someone tipped them off and gave them the wrong tip. Thank you for your time. Incompetent as always. You're in the way. I still can't believe she's dead. Pull it together, H. You can't cry in prison. Yeah. Let's just remember Estella. - Estella. - Estella. No crying. Forget Cruella. - (VEHICLE APPROACHING) - (HORN BLARES) Shh! Did you hear that? I heard something. POLICEMAN 1: Oi, come here! POLICEMAN 2: Stay behind and keep an eye on the prisoners! What? Hey. - Wink! - Shh! Wink! You ain't barbecued! What in the bloody... Thank you. You're getting kissed right on the mouth! I don't care where it's been! Want a ride? - Yeah, we'll walk, thanks. - You're alive! Oi! Yeah, I've had enough of being treated like a dog, thank you. No offense, Wink. You'll get caught by the cops. We did fine before you showed up, we'll do fine without you. HORACE: Yeah, exactly. I fancy a fry-up. - Yeah, I fancy a fry-up without her. - JASPER: Yeah, me too. There's no easy way to say this. The Baroness is my birth mother. You just blew my mind. It does explain a lot. She gave me away to die. And then killed the sweetest woman, albeit a liar, who ever lived. Well, thank you for the crumpets and the crazy story. - Good luck with that. - (GRUNTS) - I might take a few of these. - CRUELLA: Jasper! We're in a kill-or-be-killed situation here. Yeah, and she's a homicidal maniac, and you're not. (SCOFFS) Well, we don't know that yet. I'm still young. It's funny. Or it would be, if I knew you were being funny. No, not funny. I'm joking, I'm joking! The point is, I can't run. She'll find me, Jasper. You know she will. We have to stop her. I went a bit mad. I'm sorry. You're my family. You're all I have. - She used the family card. - Yeah, she did. It's working. Yeah. All right, fine. So what's the plan? The Baroness' charity gala is this weekend. We're going to need the home addresses and measurements of all the guests. Easy. Artie's tribe of dressmakers, of course. I like him. A black cape, pots of paint. Oh, yeah? Several boned corsets... Should we write this down? I'm sorry. I didn't realize there'd be company. John, this is my family. They'll be staying a while. Hiya. You're out of crumpets. - (SHOPKEEPERS BELL TINKLES) - We're closed. - (DOOR CLOSES) - I was just reading about you, the puppy killer. Oh, well, I do love spots. You didn't. I didn't. But people do need a villain to believe in, so I'm happy to fit the bill. Fabulous. Small point, aren't you dead? I am. Yes. Sad, really. But also helpful. Now, Artie, I have a plan. Of course you do. And you're going to help me with it. Mmm. What do I get? A night of fabulousness and mayhem and possible death. Check, check, not quite sure about the death though. It won't be you. Mmm. I'll get my coat. WOMAN: For me? Heya. Sorry. Big night. Indeed it is. Sure about this? No, I'm being serious. And you're cute when you are. Okay. I know you're in pain. Mmm. And I know that she caused it, but, you know, killing her is not gonna make that go away. I won't. I promise. All right, cool. Groovy. Unless I really, really have to. Thanks for helping me. Yeah, well, I find it very difficult saying no to you sometimes. It's one of the things I love about you. Thanks? HORACE: When I fixed it, I noticed a name. Do you know what this car's called? A Devil! It's DeVille, mate. DeVille. I like that. Come on. Stand to attention. Stand up straight. Good. It's time. Psst! When I said, all those years ago, ""Take care of it,"" what did you think I meant? Well, I was a little confused. I hardly thought you meant you wanted me to kill your only child. And I thought - we knew each other. - (KNOCK ON DOOR) Well? I hope for your sake, she's hidden in your coat. No, Baroness. George, come here. She'll be here tonight. I want her caught before she's seen. Everyone thinks she's dead. She better be that way by the end of the night. I've got a special treat for her. It'll put a shock through her and leave her incapacitated. Give it to me. Hmm. - (TASER BUZZING) - (GROANS) That's marvelous. Oh, I could do that all day! Oh! Just find her, you idiots! Why am I the only one who's competent? Must be very tiring. Should be a memorable night tonight, Baroness. Indeed it should. All right, boys, look alert. First vehicle arriving. Blimey, it's her. - Oh. - I beg your pardon. It's not her. Here she is, here. That's not her. - How dare you touch me! - Sorry, ma'am. What's going on? Time for my entrance, my dears. - Baroness, I... - Is she here? Well, that's the problem, see, uh... Police. How can I help? There's a robbery planned for Hellman Hall this evening. CONSTABLE: Who is this? JASPER: (OVER RADIO) All teams, Baroness requires everybody in the library now. She's angry, boys. I was just looking for the loo. Shh. - (TASER BUZZES) - Oh. Thank you all for coming. What a great tribute to our dear friend who shall never return. Sadly. Touching. - To Cruella. - ALL: To Cruella! - (ALL CHEERING, APPLAUDING) - Bravo! That dog is like a son to me. You're dead! I had him. Did you, though? Where is she? Didn't you just toast her death? Where are my guards? She's here. I can feel it. Find her. Push! (GROANING) Get her! Sit. Hello, Cruella. I hate to ruin your party, but I've come to evict you. (CHUCKLES) Don't be absurd. This is the key that was in the necklace that unlocks the box my birth certificate was in. Hello, Mother. It all makes sense now. What? That you're so extraordinary. Of course, you're mine. I've longed for someone in my life who was as good as me. You left me to die. A mistake. And one we can get past. I know it. I disagree. Good evening. The Baroness asks that you join her - on the terrace. - Lovely. Gentlemen, the Baroness would like to invite you outside, please. You're not here for revenge. You're here because you're a brilliant designer and a wicked genius and you need to be among your own kind. Me. Your real mother. Who made a mistake and let something extraordinary go. We are very alike, I suppose. Good evening. Madam, ravishing as always. The Baroness requests your presence outside. (HESITATES) I'm sorry. You are? I am. Can I hug you? Yes. You're not going to push me off the cliff, are you? (WHISPERS) You're so funny, dear. So funny. I love it. - Idiot. - (GRUNTS) She jumped. Did you see? She jumped. She tried to drag me with her. She jumped, she jumped, she jumped. Why are you looking at me like that? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh. She jumped! What are you doing with those handcuffs? She jumped! CRUELLA: So I told you I died. Estella, that is. Poor thing. She couldn't even get anyone to come to her own funeral. That seemed like an unhappy ending. Murdered tragically by her very own mother. - Idiot. - (GRUNTS) A few things. Before she died, Estella willed her fortune to her dear friend... Cruella de Vil. Can't you idiots see? That Estella person, it's a trick. She's really Cruella. CRUELLA: Cruella de Vil. It's spelled ""Devil,"" but it's pronounced ""de Vil."" You wait, I'll get even. CRUELLA: The good thing about evil people is you can always trust them to do something, well, evil. Estella would die like her mother did. But not quite. A well-cut skirt is a lifesaver, girls. Remember that. She'd go to prison for throwing someone off a cliff. Wrong someone, but there's something about poetic justice that's just so poetic. Goodbye, Estella. She was with her mother now. I'll take it from here. But Cruella was alive. All right, we should put on some music or something. Lighten the mood. She's not actually dead, mate. She's... How can you not get choked up at all this? Oh, man. CRUELLA: And I call that a happy ending. Has, uh, Genghis put on a bit of weight? So, what now? I've got a few ideas. Cruella de Vil Cruella de Vil She's born to be bad So run for the hills Cruella de Vil Cruella de Vil The fear on your face It gives me a thrill Who wants to be nice? Who wants to be tame? All of you good guys Y'all seem the same Original, criminal Dressed to kill Just call me Cruella de Vil Call me crazy, call me insane But you're stuck in the past And I'm ahead of the game A life lived in penance It just seems a waste And the devil has much better taste And I tried to be sweet I tried to be kind But I feel much better now that I'm Out of my mind Oh, there always line in the gates of hell But I go right to the front gate 'cause I dress this well Rip it up, leave it all in tatters Beauty is the only thing that matters The fabric of your little world is torn Embrace the darkness Be really blind Cruella de Vil The fear on your face It gives me a thrill ROGER: Hello, Pongo. ROGER: (SINGING) Cruella de Vil Cruella de Vil If she doesn't scare you No evil thing will To see her is to take a certain chill Cruella, Cruella de Vil <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, Who's in your urn? Baili. Wu Wanli, you little bastard! I'll tell your Dad to kick your ass! Liu Shaoazi, This one's for ratting me out to my Dad! Wu Wanli, get over here. You have a gun? I'm so scared. You're quite heavy-handed. Does it ring any bells? Let go of me! Little Bun, who am I? Qianli. Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom! Qianli... Qianli came back! Dad, Mom. Baili... is gone. Baili. Eat. Qianli, you eat too. What are you doing Mom. In the army? I'm the company commander. How many people do you command? About 150. You're a high official! Yeah, a high official. I heard from Limpy Chen down the river that the government allotted us 0.39 acres of land. In 1947 when we fought in Mengyin County, I saw a house with a front and back yard there with flush gable roof and purlins. The eave can accommodate five nests of swallows. Our family has been floating on the water for generations. When we build a house there, the villagers would certainly see us in a new light. Mom, here's my subsidy. If we start building on February 2 next year, we can finish by the beginning of winter. When I come back again, we can find a good wife for Wanli. You're leaving again? You're still going into battle? Mom, the war is already over. There aren't any battles anymore. No more battles. Show me your gun. Let me see it. Don't point the gun at anyone. I told you not to point the gun at anyone! Order from the Corps Headquarters! Order from the Corps Headquarters! Attention all! Who's Wu Qianli? Present! Emergency! Your leave is canceled. Report for duty first thing in the morning. Roger that! Qianli. Qianli. I'll come back by the beginning of spring. Okay. I'll build the house when I come back. I want to go into battle with you. Baili said he and I fought enough for our family. You don't have to join the army. Little Bun, wait till I come home. Go back now. ""September 15, 1950"" ""Incheon, Korea"" Since July 7 this year, U.S. General MacArthur, leading Marine forces, announced war on North Korea. In sweeping speed, U.S. Air Force carpet-bombed the total terrain of the enemy. Victory is estimated in the brief span of a few weeks. This is AFNK. Bring in the latest news from the front. We're close to the Yalu River southwest factory zone. In position, target locked, ready to drop. Proceed with the mission. Copy. Base control, this is Blade Team. We are over the shooting zone crossing the Chinese border. All targets are open, request action to be confirmed. Over. Blade Team. Just take 8 wings to the second location Our mission is to cut off their supply line by any means necessary. Over. Blade Team, copy that. ""Antung Chinese Border"" Enemy plane! Enemy plane! ""Wolmido Island, Incheon"" Perfect photo op for the press. Is this a part of MacArthur's next presidential campaign? You think he'll become president after this war? He's already tried twice. Not a chance. Look, it's the puking bears. How are you gonna get on the boat back home? If you're gonna barf, do it out of sight. Don't embarrass the regiment. You remember what our regiment did in Siberia, World War 1? And when we helped stop the Japs in the Philippines in World War [1? Our legacy, man! Don't worry, boys, this place ain't no Normandy. This was a cakewalk. Let the 1st Marine Division prance around for the reporters and we'll show these leathernecks what a real battle looks like. We will take Seoul back and make Korea whole! And I guarantee you, this will be a fast war. God willing, it will be over by Thanksgiving. General, does making Korea whole mean that American forces will cross the 38th Parallel? If this is the best thing for Korea and the world, then God will lead our path! Are you confident about this operation, General? Have you underestimated Kim [I-Sung? He has Stalin and Mao behind him. I never underestimate my foes. I have my track record. A stellar 1st Marine Division and the best damn generals and soldiers on the face of God's green earth. I believe we will succeed. I reckon we will have this wrapped up well before Thanksgiving. General, you read my mind. ""BEIJING October 4, 1950"" September 15 to 19, over 70,000 well-equipped U.S. soldiers landed on Incheon. By September 28, the Korean People's Army retreated to the North of the 38th Parallel. The more serious matter is, MacArthur visited Taiwan as early as July 31. According to our reports, the 13th U.S. Air Force will enter and be stationed in Taiwan. This is the biggest move of the U.S. in that aspect since the 7th Marine Fleet put a lockdown on Taiwan on June 26 this year. This is a complete violation of the statement that the U.S. government issued on January 5 this year. On October 3, which was yesterday, the 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Division of U.S. Ground Forces were completely assembled and ready to head north across the 38th Parallel at any time. This completely crossed our bottom line. Did you all hear that? If they cross the 38th Parallel, are they going to cross the Yalu River too? In fact, by being stationed in Taiwan, the U.S. army has already invaded our territory. They are now assembling forces on the Korean Peninsula and threatening our national security. ""October 5, 1950"" ""3.00 AM"" Uncle Peng. Anying, is the Chairman asleep? Not yet. Dad guessed you would be here and told me to wait for you at the door. ""Library of Chrysanthemum Fragrance Come in. A number of battleships will be deployed to join the United States Seventh Fleet. Chairman. Meanwhile, America will strengthen its military power in Taiwan. Peng, you're still awake? What do you think about this situation? I want to hear your thoughts first, Chairman. The country is newly established and thousands of things are waiting to be done. If it's for our current situation, I really don't want to fight this war. But if it's for the future and the peaceful development of our country over a few decades or a century, we must fight this war. The foreigners look down upon us. Pride can only be earned on the battlefield. I agree. I support your decision to aid Korea. I'm relieved. Chairman, I'm thinking, we should have an army on the eastern front as well. It can be stationed at the Lake Changjin to fight against the U.S. army. Uncle Peng. Uncle Peng. Let me guess. I know what you want to say. Let me be your first soldier, Chief Commander Peng. You have two brothers. One of them is lost and still yet to be found in Shanghai, right? Yes, in Shanghai. The other one is sick. You are the only one who can stay by your father's side now. Uncle Peng. That's why you really shouldn't go, son! Hundreds of thousands of civilians' children are going off to war on one command. Why shouldn't I go? Peng, let him go with you. Right now, the most important thing is that on our western flank, I Corps with the 1st Cavalry and 24th Divisions will cross the 38th and take Pyongyang. Mother, this is Fortune 7 Squadron Leader, heading 359-er. We've reached our IP. Beginning bomb run at Target ""Cast Iron"". Time over the target, estimated one minute. In the meantime, the current plan calls for us to take the port city of Hungnam and drive north-west to the Yalu River. Keep in mind we'll be separated from our forces at the Lake Changjin. The U.S. Army marched north and crossed the 38th Parallel. The Yalu River is right in front of them. If we ignore them, our domestic and foreign enemies would think we are weak and gullible. We are in the same boat. The comrades of Korea are asking for our help. Thus, throw out one punch now to avoid a hundred punches in the future. I declare to appoint Comrade Peng Dehuai as the Chief Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as well as the Political Commissar to lead the army on this operation abroad. ""Eastern Front U.S. Temporary HQ"" Gentlemen, our tanks have crossed the 38th and our enemies have been overwhelmed. Seems to me that victory has been set in stone. It's time for us to plan our next move. General, the Air Force has taken control of the air space. The 10th Corps has taken Hungnam Harbor and we're ready to advance the Yalu River. Sir, did the president really order us to proceed to the Yalu? Mr. Truman doesn't send orders, only suggestions. So what about Communist China? They've deployed their soldiers and they're attacking our boys. How should we respond to this preemptive warning and their actions? General Walker, we command well-trained soldiers, not peasants. If we're to end this war, we must strike while the iron is hot. ""Volunteer Army HQ Taeyu-dong, Korea"" Commander, we received a telegram. The U.S. mechanized forces continued to head north at a rapid pace. If this carries on, the enemies will soon be right at our doorstep. Commander Peng, the U.S. 1st Marine Division has already landed at Wonsan. Their division commander Major General Smith is leading their 25,000 heavily-armed soldiers to assemble from the eastern front toward the Lake Changjin. They want to form a pincer attack with their forces on the western front to achieve their goal of fully occupying Korea. Report to the Chairman immediately. I intend to gather our forces on the western front first to defend against the U.S. army. At the same time, request the Central Military Commission to send the strategic forces to Korea immediately and block the enemy at the Lake Changjin on the eastern front. Yes. Send a telegram to Commander Peng explaining that Kanggye and the Lake Changjin should be taken care of by Song Shilun's 9th Corps. Their mission is to lure the enemy in and seize the chance to annihilate them. How many Type 38 Rifles do we have? Sixteen. What about Sten 99s? We got them all. Bring them all back. Yes. Company Commander, Yu Congrong is brawling with some people. With whom? People from the Artillery Battalion. Don't move. Speak louder! I can't hear anything. You just do not capable. Get down. Yu Congrong! Yang, what's going on? Battalion Commander Yang said... Be quiet! Company Commander. Battalion Commander Yang said the battle in Chenguan Village caused the 7th Company to have too many casualties. It's no big deal even if we won. If it wasn't for the Artillery Battalion, we couldn't even enter the battlefield. They should be taking the credit for the victory. Battalion Commander Yang, our 7th Company seized 8 out of the 11 cannons for your Artillery Battalion. We supported you, didn't we? You are really something. What a great honor to end up with SO many casualties! What did you say? Wu Qianli! What are you doing? Attention! Division Commander, we are planning a party with the Artillery Battalion. Stop fooling around, the Commander is here. Attention! Commander, I'm Wu Qianli, Company Commander of the 7th Company. I've heard of you. The hero of our 9th Corps. Your 7th Company is quite famous. People call you the 7th Interpenetrating Company. The Corps' Party Committee was supposed to issue a pennant to you, but now it'll have to wait until the end of the war. Yes! Salute! At ease! Comrades, I met a boy here today. He insisted that your Division Commander allow him to enlist in the army. The Division Commander asked him, ""Why do you want to be a soldier? He said, ""My Dad said the Communist Party and Chairman Mao allotted land to our family. But someone is here to take the land away from them. We can't let that happen. That's how it is. We just triumphed over the entire nation. Before we even had time to rest, the imperialist U.S. started a war with Korea at our northern border. They intend to spread the heat of war to our newly established China. What should we do? Fight! That's right! Chairman Mao and Chief Commander Zhu ordered our 9th Corps to head north, resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, and defend our country! Resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea! Defend our country! Resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea! Defend our country! Go, go, go! Our troops will run toward the sun. Standing on our motherland's ground, we are the hope the people long for. Nobody can shoot us down. Wu Qianli! Present! Bring the 7th Company back. Yes! He's the boy the Commander just mentioned. He said he's Wu Qianli's little brother. I'll hand him to you. Yes! Get in there! How did you find this place? I secretly followed you. How did you find the Division Commander? He must be a high official if he's in a car. You stopped the Division Commander's car? I want to be a soldier. Do Mom and Dad know? No. Get out of here! Go. All companies to the designated location! Load the supplies! One, two, three, four! Mark time! 141 soldiers should have reported to the 3rd Company. 130 soldiers actually reported for duty. The rest are on their way back. 258 soldiers should have reported to the Artillery Battalion. 221 soldiers actually reported for duty. 157 soldiers should have reported to the 7th Interpenetrating Company. Commander! Mei Sheng from the 7th Company reports for duty. 157 soldiers should have reported to the 7th Interpenetrating Company. 157 soldiers actually reported for duty. Fall in! Yes! Company Commander, I need to pee. Report before you speak. If you need to pee, do it here. Qianli. Company Commander, I can do it now! Don't touch me. Go away. Go away. You already left the army. Why are you back? Someone might feel uneasy without me. You mean me? I read the newspaper as soon as I got home. Luckily, I haven't filed the paperwork for my discharge. I rode the bike for 12 hours to get back here. You should give me a massage when we're aboard. Sure. What are you doing? Wait! Someone seize him! Order! All units on board! All units on board! Yes! On board! Wu Wanli, get down! This way! Hurry! Over there. Company Commander. Here. Get up there. Come on, Everyone here? Yes! ""The 9th Corps will head to China-Korea Border"" ""after training and consolidation in Shandong. That new recruit will be listed under the Artillery Platoon. Make an entry and register him later. No. We are not short of soldiers. His name is Wu Wanli. Please instruct him. We are about to go into battle. How am I supposed to teach him? Teach him the same way as you taught me. Teach him how to survive. Lei. You stay with Platoon Leader Lei. What are you looking at? Why? Are you shy? Why do you want to be a soldier? So my brother will take me seriously. What are you talking about? You're only tough enough when your enemies take you seriously. When will I get my gun? You want a gun? Seize one for yourself on the battlefield. Isn't that right? Yes. Congrong. Ping He, take this. Your daughter? Eight years old. Four plus four equals seven to her. Why did you bring back all your medals? You're afraid of losing them? If I leave these in Shanghai, my family will miss me so much. My wife rode her bike for over 100 li to send me off. She cried all the way. She asked me when I would come home. My parents didn't persuade me to stay at all. I promised them I would go home by Spring to build a house for them. He's too serious. Stop teasing him. Come on, little brat. Let me introduce everyone to you. My name is Yu Congrong, The 1st Platoon Leader of the 7th Interpenetrating Company. The enemies are usually ahead when other people charges. When I charge, the enemies are ahead, behind, and all around me. How's that? Don't grab for a weapon. You must regain the respect you lost on your own. The person I'm introducing next is the Artillery Platoon Leader. I'm Lei. Baili and Qianli are all trained under him. Remember, in the 7th Company, he's the daddy. He's Daddy Lei. Call him Daddy Lei. We're going to battle again. What are you thinking? What about you? The reoccurring fear of the battlefield is just like what's written in the books, the fear you feel as a new recruit. It feels just like that. Stop fighting if you can't win. Let go of me! I'll Kill him! The one behind you is our sharpshooter, Ping He. Attention! Get back here! Where are we? The 7th Interpenetrating Company! The 7th Company isn't supposed to be like this. Am I in the wrong carriage? I asked Yu Congrong to test his character. Qianli. They are bullying me. Bullying you? Fight back then! They outnumber me. All the enemies the 7th Company comes across outnumber us by a few times. Can you go tell the enemies that they outnumber us? We're now holding an enlistment ceremony for Comrade Wu Wanli. Salute! At ease! Yu Congrong. Here! You're a seasoned comrade. Tell Wu Wanli how Company Commander Wu Baili passed away. Yes. Company Commander Wu Baili actively attacked the enemy with a small group of soldiers at Huaihai. After overtaking the enemy bunkers, he passed away while protecting his comrades-in-arms. What did the 7th Company do after he died? The 7th Interpenetrating Company annihilated and took captive the enemy soldiers that outnumbered them by six times. The enemy bunkers that were supposed to hold up our troops for over a year only held up the 7th Company for half a day. Our frontline lies behind enemy lines. We may lose many, but because of that sacrifice, the entire army's casualties are minimized. We shouldn't brag about this. The most important thing is to hang on. We cannot be careless. The U.S. army we are going to face has the best equipment in the world. This battle will be extremely arduous. But we need to strive for victory. Do you understand, Wu Wanli? Wu Wanli, you are now the 677th soldier of the 7th Interpenetrating Company. You might say, ""There aren't so many people. There are only over 100 here."" We are counting every soldier since the establishment of the 7th Company, including those who have died or been discharged from injuries. And now you are one of us. I'm the 135th soldier of the 7th Interpenetrating Company, Mei Sheng. The 221st soldier, Yu Congrong. The 280th soldier, Ping He. The 335th soldier, He Changgui. The 572nd soldier, Li Chizheng. The 657th soldier, Liu Zhiyi. The 533rd soldier, Ba Long. The 565 rd soldier, Xuan Qiang. The 162nd soldier, Wu Qianli. The 161st soldier, Wu Baili. The 17th soldier, Lei Suisheng. What about you? Let me tell you again. There is no need. He will remember when it's time. I just wish he would... I don't wish anything from him. Wu Wanli, you're afraid the seasoned soldiers won't accept you. let me tell you. You will only know whether they accept you when you get on the battlefield. An egg that's been cracked from the outside is destined to be eaten. If you can crack the egg from the inside, you might be an eagle. I have an announcement: due to Comrade Wu Wanli's violation of discipline and the disturbance he caused, the original plan for the weapon presenting ceremony has been canceled. Dismissed! I quit! You never wanted me to be a soldier. Fine, I'll leave! Wu Wanli Stop moving! Don't stop me! Do you want to die? Stop moving! You will stand right here as your punishment until the morning. Take this. Your brother agreed. Remember, never point the gun at your own people. You'll take the bunk on top of mine. Let's go. The Company Commander told me to stand until the morning. It's not time yet. You and your two brothers are all so stubborn! Bun... Bun... So good. So good. Time to eat! Hey, what are you doing? Bullets. Go away! You didn't give me any bullets yet. Where are the bullet heads? I'll give them to you when we get to Korea. Don't forget. ""Ji'an East Station Chinese Border"" Station Master, where did you lose your arm? Jinzhou. Squad Leader! Cut that out. What do you want? Out with it. I heard it's extremely cold across the river. That's all you're wearing? Why didn't you change into padded uniforms in Shenyang? There weren't enough. Otherwise, we wouldn't need to bother you. This is all of the insignias and badges for all the officials and soldiers of the 7th Interpenetrating Company. We are turning them in by order. If you can stay for two more days, the 50,000 padded uniforms will arrive. Let me, let me. The 7th Interpenetrating Company is ordered to transport 20 radio transmitters to Korea and wait for orders there. We guarantee that we'll complete the mission! Wu Wanli, look. U.S. aircraft! It's a U.S. aircraft! A scout aircraft. Get on board! Thanks, bro! The padded uniforms! Take the padded uniforms! Yu! Take the padded uniforms! Let's go! Hurry! The padded uniforms! Let's go now! Hurry! 7th Company, get on board! Get on board now! Hurry, hurry! - Where's Wu Wanli? - Wu Wanli! - Where's Wu Wanli? - Hurry! - Get on board! - Is everybody present? The 2nd Platoon present! The 3rd Platoon present! Company commander, look! Take the Padded uniforms! Hold on! Padded uniforms! Get back! Don't come anymore! It's dangerous! Catch them! Watch your step! That's enough! Don't throw any more. Caution! Caution! Padded uniforms! Catch them! Thank you! Take care. Get back! Thank you! Qianli, I saw someone who was killed by a bomb. Without the radio transmitters, we can't communicate with the central government or the frontline troops. Just like if we don't have maps, there's no way to fight a war. Commander Peng, the additional military radios have been loaded onto the train at Ji'an. The 9th Corps is responsible for escorting them to the volunteer army. What about the cipher clerks? They will arrive at the same time. ""China-Korea Border Yalu River Bridge"" Why did the train stop? Track repairing ahead. Rest on the spot for 30 minutes! Take a 30 minutes break. Alright. Comrades, time is valuable! Come on! Speed up. Who is that? Tan Ziwei, the 3rd Battalion's commander. He's from our company. He's the 160th soldier. He enlisted at the same time as Baili. Baili? Yes. He used to be the sharpshooter of our company. An undefeatable hero. Battalion Commander, the Division Commander wants to see you. Platoon Leader, are we there? Yes, we just passed the Yalu River. What? The bullet heads. Oh, that. I'll give them to you when we get on the battlefield. Come on, come to the back with me. They are all sharpshooters. Who's better, Ping He or him? Who's better, your brother or him? Nonsense, I have two brothers. Two against one. What's that? Not gonna tell you. I've just spotted a troop train. Wheelhouse, this is Summer 19. We spotted a train loaded with North Korea troops stopping in the valley. Get inside now! All units get on board and get equipped! All companies grab supplies and get off the train! Decentralize and spread out in battalions! Take cover and cut through Nangnim Mountains and reassemble at the Lake Changjin! Take the radio transmitters first, cipher soldiers get off the train now! How are you on ordnance? I've still got a few GPs left over. Drop them on the train, eliminate that target. The other two twenty-sixes can return to K-2. Wanli, go grab the food rations! Retreat! Retreat from the train! Retreat from the train! Stop unloading! Retreat! Hurry! Hurry! Shan, take some more! Okay. Wanli, stop taking supplies, go! Wanli! Qianli! How can you run while carrying this much? Toss them! Toss them now! You want to be the target? Heading 185, altitude 350. Maries are armed. Check the gears. Instructor, our radio transmitters and cipher soldiers are fine. Great. The enemy planes will patrol this area for sure. There are few plants and no shelters nearby. The most urgent thing is to find a place to hide first and then continue marching in the dark. After crossing this river, there should be places to hide. To make it fast, this is the only route we can take. On guard, 1st Squad. The rest take a break. Wanli, why are you keeping so many shell cases? Platoon Leader said he'll give me the bullet heads when we get to the battlefield. He lied to you. This is just a bunch of useless shells. Really? Why would I lie to you? Great marksmanship! That's nothing. You haven't seen me skipping stones. Did Platoon Leader bully you again? When I first join the Company, he bullied me a lot. Let me tell you, his right ear is nearly deaf because of explosions. I always scold him near it. You should try. Such a liar, hope you get burnt by the cigarette. You bastard! Platoon Leader. Company Commander is looking for you. Wait for me here. Apologies. My mistake. It's the left ear. Don't be mad anymore. You're really something. Of course. Each platoon shall proceed in the 466 battle formation. Protect the radio transmitters and cipher soldiers in between the 2nd and the 3rd platoons. Fighter planes! In which direction? Right ahead of us. We don't have time! Take cover! Get down! Don't move or we'll all die! They're back. Did they notice us? 500 meters. 350 meters. 200 meters. We can't shoot! With an altitude of 30 m and north wind, I can hit it. I believe you. But the other one will call for more fighter planes. Damn it Dutch, let's call it. I'm not seeing anything moving down there. I'm starting to worry about ice forming around my cannons. Hey, you see those stiffs? How about a gun run? Haha, 10 bucks says I strafe""em better! Alright! They made a turn. You owe me 10, Dutch! Damn it! Again, make it 50! How far have we gone? We can't die here! Come on, let's kill those bastards! I'm gonna Kill you! Come on! The 1st and the 2nd Platoons, take the right. The 3rd and the 4th Platoons, take the left. Follow my orders! Escort the radio transmitters and cipher soldiers away first! Roger! Groundhog 2, Groundhog 4, this is Groundhog Leader. Form on me. 7th Marines TAC-P reported troop concentrations South of the 25-Northing. Solid copy. Live targets this time! Let's tear them up! You got it! How are the radio transmitters and cipher soldiers? 8 damaged and 12 still usable. Luckily, the cipher soldiers are all fine. A soldier should never put his gun on the ground. What is this? I'm not telling you. Qianli, Zhang Xiaoshan has died. You'll experience things like this very often in the future. Where's his hometown? Yimeng Mountain in Shandong Province, Linyi City, Gu Town. He is two months younger than you. Let's go. We might encounter enemies ahead. Don't be a show-off. ""Nangnim Mountains"" Sir, I am not detecting any radio transmission activity here. Impossible! With that many Chinese soldiers on the move, they have to be communicating with each other. I know they're down there. This is the last grid square we haven't covered. One o'clock. Fly lower to take a look. Wing 2, you take the east side of the valley. Open the door. Sir, the wind is too strong out there. Open the door! Lieutenant, take us lower! Negative, sir! It's too dangerous! Lower! Give me the camera. Lieutenant, take us to the next zone! Stop! Company Commander, there's gunfire on the other side of the mountain. Notify the Political Instructor. Roger. Looks like it's our comrades. It's our comrades indeed. They are pinned down by the Americans. The enemies are so powerful. If we don't help, they won't survive for more than 20 minutes. You two keep going with the radio transmitters to Taeyu-dong. Make sure you arrive on time. Yu Congrong, Ping He, and the 1st Squad stay with me here. Give me one of your Artillery Squads. I will have 3rd Artillery Squad follow you. Let me join the fight. This is the first time we fight head-to-head with the U.S. Army. I should be here. Plus, I've studied English for two years by myself. Request approved. Fire! Move back! Move back! Attack! Cover them! Where's my M20, goddammit! Fire! Move! Move back! Move back! Go get the higher point and take out the mortars! Attack! Ji Chungeng from the 6th Company of the 172nd Regiment! This is Wu Qianli from the 7th Company, the 1st Storming Regiment. Our mission is to blow up the U.S. signal tower, cut off the connection between U.S. frontline and headquarters in Lake Changjin! The enemy firepower is too fierce and we are suffering heavy casualties! Our dynamiter was Killed right by the cowshed in front of the tower. Platoon Leader, Wu Wanli disappeared! Tell them to stop ahead. Yes. Everyone stop! Is he falling behind? Like hell he's falling behind! That little bastard! Lei, listen. These are reinforcement troops. What should we do? We can't let them pass. Stop them right here. Arrange for one team to escort the radio transmitters and cipher soldiers ahead. Tanks have limited sight. We'll occupy the commanding heights. The tanks can't touch us there. The mortars need to concentrate firepower and take out their troop carriers first. Why are you here? Don't come up here! - There's another one, get him! - Where? Two o'clock, keep shooting! Who told you to come up here? Get inside, now! Yu Congrong! Yes, sir! Let's go get the dynamite pack! Roger! Ask the rest to set the defense and save the wounded! Hurry! Go there! Ye, the knife! Platoon Leader. Take cover! Fire! Ambush from the hill! Strike! Fire! Find some cover, get me the positions of those gook mortars! Move! Move! Retreat! Retreat! Lure them up the hill! Grenade! Hurry! Go! Yu Congrong! I'm okay! Ah! Don't come over! Go! I'll go divert them! Listen for my gunfire! Roger! Watch your back! Instructor, problem solved. Stab him! Stab! Stab him! Yu Congrong! Cover me, I am going after him. Grenade! Come here! Crouch down and don't move! Hurry up! Over here! Stay low. Stevens! Nine o'clock, take them out! Got it! Company Commander! You stay right here and don't go out there. Remember! Here's the grenade. Count to five and release it. Okay. Keep up the rate of fire! Get ready. One, two, three! In the air? One more time! Yu, take your man and go blow up the signal tower! Yu Congrong! Hey Third, push up the embankment! Push up, push up the embankment! Move! Move! Chaos Company, assault through the ambush! Tank 1-1 and 1-2 push to the tower! Go to hell! Go to hell! Goddamnit! My bow gun is jammed! Company Commander! Company Commander Wu, two U.S. tanks and a dozen infantry soldiers are heading this way! Yu Congrong, the U.S. tank we seized from the Battle of Southern Shandong, do you still remember how to use it? Yes! Shit, I can't see anything! Me neither, what was that? Stop! Hang on tight! I can't stop it. Ah! You okay? I am fine. Let's get out. Attack! Watch out! Run! Shit, we gotta get out of here! Go! Go! Go! It's Daddy's fault. I hope our next generation no longer has to live through war. Why didn't you abide by orders? How can you come here on your own? I want to be with you. That's your reason? Because you're my brother. Are you hungry? In the army, you must abide by orders. Your comrades-in-arms might die for your mistake if you act on your own. Do you understand? Go write a self-criticism. What's self-criticism? ""U.S. Airport Hagaru-ri, Eastern Front Hagaru-ri HQ, Whirlybird 1, over. Go ahead, Whirlybird 1. Where do you want us to set down? Over. Go to Pan 1, over. Received, out. Attention! At ease. Sir, here is the report. Sir, General Almond is here. Attention! General Oliver Smith, what the hell is that airstrip out there? I'm building an airport. Because it's essential if I'm gonna be responsible for all the lives here. One coffee. It's a fatal mistake to fight a war without the will to win it, period! Take a look outside, General. Our soldiers are trapped between hellish mountain ranges and freezing temperatures. And now, we have reports of hostile Chinese in the Yunshan. Your orders were to move forward! This is not gonna be the fast war that MacArthur expected. This war is on a schedule! And your task is to keep it, Smith! On the subject of tasks, I'm the chief of this task force, Edward. Where's the coffee? When this all ends, you are going to face the consequences. Yes, we all will, Edward. We all will. November 25, my men will be up on the western line. And if you don't show up, I will have you scalped! I will scalp you with my own hands! One lump of sugar, sir? Ping He, Changgui. Standby. Standby. Are you guys hungry? Of course. Bear with it. Our own people. I see that. Senior Officer, the 7th Interpenetrating Company is here to deliver 12 radio transmitters and 4 cipher clerks by order, please check them. Li, show the cipher clerks in first. Yes. Comrades, bring the radios in. Yes! Guys, come with me. Liu, take them to get some rest. Yes. Thank you, Senior Officer. Wu, please come with me. Thank you. Let's go. Ouch! You won't die. What are you writing? Yu, Yu! Comrades, let me read it for you all. It's Comrade Wu Wanli's self-criticism report. No, no, it's a self-O report. I didn't listen to Leader Lei's O. I went to O my brother. I O. I won't do it again. Political Instructor, our little comrade is growing up. Nice attitude, but there's no sign and it doesn't count. Sign it then. If you peck and crack the egg from the inside, you may have a chance to lay more eggs. Get out of here! And you. You little bastard, who are you to make fun of someone else? Comrades, Comrade Yu Congrong was so afraid that he peed his pants the first time he went into battle. It was me who washed his pants for him. I can testify to that. Everyone, leave your ripped or dirty clothes here. Change into these clean clothes. Thank you for your concern, comrades. You've worked hard. Dachuan, pick out three clean uniforms and take the cotton out to make first-aid pads. Share the rest with our comrades. Wounded soldiers have priority. Yes, wounded soldiers have priority. Working on that little house of yours again? If I can't come back, hand this to my parents. They can't read. Ask the teachers in the village to read it for them. This is taboo. Change it. Cross it out. You didn't have that little triangle on the diagram before. What is it? I buried Baili there. Let me see it. This is nice. This is nice. Comrade, do you have enough to eat? Yes. We have more here if you want. Yu, how many Americans does one have to kill to be a hero? Just two? Add a 0 behind it. I have to kill 20 to be a hero? You are already a hero if you've been on the battlefield. Who is he? Are you staying at my house or not? No. You have no one at your hometown in Yimeng Mountain anyway. If you live with me, you can take Baili's room. You can get married and have two kids there with your future wife. It looks like a pigsty. I'm not going. It's good if it's a pigsty. Lei, if you raise pigs, you can live a good life. Plus, there's food and accommodation. You'll live a happy life. Fine, I can go. Political Instructor, which one is Company Commander Wu? Come on. Commander Wu, he is looking for you. Hi, Commander Wu. Hi. I'm Secretary Liu from HQ. Hello. It's been tough for you. It's my duty. But your company is departing again. We received a telegram from our superiors. The eastern and western fronts will start a general assault together. The superiors ask the 7th Company to arrive at the 1100 highland in Sinhung-ni of the Lake Changjin. When should we leave? Attention, all. In 5 minutes, we will be leaving. Get ready for departure. Yes! Hundreds of thousands of civilians' children are going off to war on one command. Why shouldn't I go? Peng, let him go with you. ""The 9th Corps heads to Lake Changjin"" ""The 9th Corps Frontline HQ Chengfang-dong, Korea"" "" -31  c "" Order from HQ, before we arrived at the designated location, Execute standard radio silence procedures. Did we send the padded uniforms to the combat units yet? No. Without air supremacy, it's very difficult to guarantee logistic support. Plus, our fleet suffered a bomb attack again. Tao Yong, we must find any means possible to send the padded uniforms to our frontline units ASAP! We can't let our soldiers freeze to death on the battlefield. How many days will our food ration last? If we eat one potato a day, it would last us to Sinhung-ni at the most. We should find a way to save some for the wounded soldiers. Take these potatoes. Okay. Take them. ""November 23, 1950"" No cutting, wait your turn. Get out of here. Come on... I just want bacon. Pass them. Here's a soft one. So much for Donald Duck home by Thanksgiving. He sent his Christmas wish list instead. I don't have a goddamn thing to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. That's some list, but all I want to do is go home. Qianli, can I ask why you always bullied me when I was little? Did 1? Yeah. Mom used to give me all the good things to eat. Once you were born, that wasn't for me. Ping He, do you still want to tell the truth about Baili? Keep it in your heart. Watch it, old man. Sir, we have news from the Air Force. My family makes cheese broccoli for Thanksgiving, you want to come and join us next year at home? I will, man. If we make it home. Attention! At ease. Sir. With no signs of our enemy, our pilots reported there was signal interference every time they flew over this area. Here? Yes, sir. ""November 25, 1950"" I don't believe it! You have to leave! Deng Hua! Shut off the radios! Yes! Shut off all the radios! Gao Ruixin! Here! Did you bring the map? Yes. Let's go. The enemy planes are here! - Retreat immediately! - Hurry! Get into the air-raid shelter! Hurry! Hurry! - Boy. - Hurry! Those in the back, keep up! Coming! Hurry, keep up! What's wrong? Hurry, hurry! There's still a map on the wall. We don't have a lot of large-scale maps. Take this! Second Squad, proceed with the mission. Commander, we lost communication with Taeyu-dong. Chief Commander Peng, these were left behind by the martyr, Secretary Liu. Deputy Commander Deng, we don't have any info about Secretary Liu. Who was he? What was his full name? Deng Hua. The day after tomorrow, which is November 27, 1950, the 9th Corps will begin their general assault at the Lake Changjin. Do they... Do they know what to do? Yes. Give me a new command post! Yes! Currently... the 38th, 39th, and 40th Corps have already assembled at the Chongchon River. You must complete deployment at the Lake Changjin war zone quickly. In two days, the eastern and western fronts will begin their general assault at the same time. Song Shilun, remember. Remember! Strike them as hard as you can! The 20th Corps shall separate and surround the enemies in Koto-ri, Yudam-ni, and Hagaru-ri. Make sure the 27th Corps focuses their firepower to annihilate the U.S. army in Sinhung-ni. Yes! After the 27th Corps destroys two large clusters of enemies, immediately destroy the airport in Hagaru-ri and cut off the enemy's aerial communication. Yes. Meanwhile, stop the enemies from reinforcing the north. Yes. Where is the 27th Corps right now? They've already reached the designated location. Command the 27th Corps to take cover and stand by so that we can prevent the enemy from escaping south Where is the 26th Corps now? According to the original plan, they are 100 kilometers outside of Koto-ri. Command the 26th Corps to immediately march 50 kilometers towards Lake Changjin. Yes. The 20th and 27th Corps immediately get ready for the battle and act simultaneously with the western front. Begin the general assault at 4:30 pm on the 27th! Yes! What is the lowest temperature tonight? 40c below zero. We are not only fighting against the Americans. We are also fighting against God. General, we have reports of Chinese attacking in division strength in both Tokchon and Nyongwon. That's far more than G2 has estimated. Four other outfits are also being decisively engaged. The entire front is under heavy attack, sir. Where do they come from? Do they fall out of the goddamn sky? We don't know sir, but the reports are pouring in. ""Lake Changjin, Eastern Front"" Move, move, move! Hey, get more light in there! ""The 9th Company of the Volunteer Army"" Did we receive a command? You there Pick up your feet Hustle up! Get those crates over here! Move faster! Get some more! Right there! Stack them up boys! Come on, pick it up! Hurry up! No, I don't see any sign of enemy. Damn soldier, this ain't North Korea. This is the North Pole. ""The 7th Company of the Volunteer Army"" Let me hold that for a while. What are they singing? Don't fall asleep. Wake up. Merry Christmas. What does that mean? It's an American holiday that happens before the New Year. It's called Christmas. What is it? To be so happy. Their lives aren't so merry after all. That MacArthur even said they were going to cross the Yalu River before the New Year so their soldiers could go home for the holiday. Bullshit, they want to go home for the holiday? I'll give them a reason to go home. Do you miss mom? Qianli, when Baili died, were you by his side? He lost the bottom half of his body from the explosion. I couldn't even stuff his intestines back inside, no matter how I tried. He said he was cold. I held him in my arms. His lips were purple. I couldn't stop his bleeding. He asked me to help him take his life. Qianli, let me stay by your side. If... I end up like Baili, you can help me too. Okay. ""November 26, 1950"" How's it going? Tanks, Half-tracks, and HQ. From the marching direction and speed of the 31st Corps led by the U.S. army we can predict that the enemy's HQ will be established around the 1100 Highland. They are known as the Polar Bears. They fought in Siberia in WWI and in the Pacific in WWII. This is their trump card. We'll show them how tough our fists are then. Why hasn't anything happened? Do you think something went wrong? The 59th, 79th, and 89th Divisions arrived in Yudam-ni on time. The 80th and 81st Divisions are in position in Sinhung-ni. What's the speed of Smith's corps? 3 kilometers per day. They are moving at a snail's pace. According to their line of march and geography, Smith's corps will surely be stretched out. Then we can break their lineup into a few sections. We must annihilate Smith at the Lake Changjin. Let's wait. The 1100 Highland is right ahead of us. If we make it there before sunrise, we can block the U.S. army's route. Let's not waste our time here. Notify all units. Get ready to head out. Yes. Gather your gear and get ready for departure. Attention all! Get ready to depart. Lei. I saved this just for you. What do you want for it? Why do you have such a nasty mind? The situation with the Polar Bears is... a tough battle. Can you let me have Wanli? You're the one who handed him over to me. Now you want him back. What are you up to? He throws with unerring aim. That's useful to me. Take good care of him. When this war is over, he will become my godson. I'm expecting him to take care of me when I get old. You old bastard, if he's your godson, what should I call you? Call me Dad. I'll break those aged teeth of yours. Remember, as soon as the battle begins, you stick by your brother's side. He's more witty and canny than a rabbit. Bullets don't tend to get him. Don't be a show-off. Okay. Let's all try to fight this war nicely. Okay. Those in the back, speed up! ""November 27, 1950"" Commander, Smith's corps haven't arrived yet. No more waiting. Begin the general assault in 5 minutes. ""Sinhung-ni, Lake Changjin"" What? Have we been discovered? No. We're about to initiate the attack. Attack! Attack! Get on the truck! Enemy attack, code Red! Lock enemy assault position. Sir, they are coming from everywhere! Dinner is served! Load the cannons! Load the cannons! Ready, fire! Attack! Attack! Ammo supply! Move, move, move! Need more ammo! Never see ammo go this fast like before! Ammo supply! You gonna pick that up, Glover? Yeah, I got it, I got it! All right, we gotta move! Prepare the second load! They are coming! You guys think we're gonna make it for chow time? Shut up, Costello! We're gonna be lucky if they don't roast our turkeys for dinner. Hurry! Hurry! Right here! Two in the front and three in the back. Hurry! Take cover! Take cover now! Target the center watchtower! Copy! Ready, fire! Lei, where are your mortars? Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Lei, great job! Who called me? I didn't. Hurry! All tanks defend the headquarters! Jesus, Sunny. Go! find the American flag! Destroy their HQ. Yes. Sir, the Air Force is on its way! The enemy is closing in! Emergency orders are required, sir! Aim right at them! Hurry! Send the ammunition to them! Hurry up! Yes. The tank is coming! Go that way! Find cover! Hurry, take cover! Go! Bazooka! Here! Run! Leave me! Hang on! Go! Go! Don't fall asleep, bro. Wait for me. Dachuan! Dachuan! Attack! Charge! Watch out! Up there! Spread out! Spread out! Grenade! 1, 2, 3! Go! Rush forward! Fight! Bro! Spread out! Get down! Hurry! Grenade! Get back! Take cover! Get on! Hurry! Get in the truck! Stop them! A fool who risks his neck will never be a hero! Stay calm! You must stay calm on the battlefield! I order a full retreat! Give the order! All units fall back! Burn everything! Let's get out of here! Go! They are going to retreat! Stop them! Fall back! Sir, the vehicle is ready! Go! Back up! Back up! What are you doing? Only 8 more! I'm about to reach 20! Some shots must be fired. Some shots can be saved. All units, move it to the position. Wait for the order. I repeat. Wait for the order. Move! Move! Move! All units, move it to position. Wait for the order. I repeat. Wait for the order. Sir, calling from Sinhung-ni demanding immediate reinforcements. They are in urgent retreat. Landman, get reinforcements to Sinhung-ni. Move! ""Hagaru-ri"" All units consolidate immediately and count inventory. The 2nd Company of the 3rd Battalion, stay on guard. Stay alert in all directions! The 3rd Platoon and the 6th Platoon, defend the southwest direction. Call him Old Company Commander. Old Company Commander. Not you. Didn't I tell you? I got it, the undefeatable hero. Wanli. How old are you? Nineteen. Little brat, have you seen any enemy aircraft? The plane opens its butt end and pours down bullets and bombs. After that, our men in yellow uniforms will drop one after another. What should we call those brothers who were Killed in action? What should we call those who froze to death after marching for 6 days and nights without any food or sleep? What about those who ran to 10 meters in front of the enemy just to toss their hand grenades? They were killed. What should we call them? There aren't any heroes who will never freeze to death, let alone ones who will never be killed. A soldier only lives for honor and glory. What should I call you? The 677th Soldier, Wu Wanli. ""Wan"" means ten-thousand. Watch out. Sophisticated. U.S. Aircraft are here! Bazooka! U.S. Aircrafts! U.S. Aircrafts! Find cover! God save us! Spread out! U.S. bomb! Are you alright? What's your name? Officer, I'm the 280th soldier of the 7th Company, Ping He. FX Bomb! Spread out! Spread out! FX Bomb! They're going to bombard us! FX Bomb! Spread out! Spread out! IS sighted, vision clear. Ready to drop. Over. Enemy planes! Spread out! I'll send their FX bomb back to them! Bastards. Everybody says that... Everybody says that Yimeng Mountain is the best. The scenery is beautiful on Yimeng Mountain. Lei! Lift the car. It hurts. It so hurts. Don't... Don't... Don't leave me alone here. Why do you want to be a soldier? So Qianli will take me seriously. What are you talking about? You're only tough enough when your enemies take you seriously. ""Lei Suisheng. Lei, It won't hurt anymore. It won't hurt anymore. You've done well, Lei. Let me. When I was back home last time, every time I went out on the street, people would nod and smile at me. I didn't know them, but they recognized my army uniform. Before I left home, my daughter asked me, ""Daddy, why must you fight this war?"" If we don't fight this war, our next generation will have to fight it. We are risking our lives to win them a peaceful life. My mom kept gazing at me without saying a word when I left home. I know she didn't want me to leave. My wife said when I came home again, I had to teach our daughter how to do the math. We have to win the war and bring them home. ""Hagaru-ri Airport U.S. Army's Grand Retreat"" Sir! Your chopper is here, sir. You can leave anytime. The 5th and 7th Regiments aren't here yet and this will be an important evac route. The supplies are on board now. Okay, get ready. You send that chopper to evacuate the wounded. Those men aren't out of danger yet! Hey, clear out! Clear out! Let's get out of here! ""The U.S. Marine retreats from Hagaru-ri towards Sumun Bridge,"" ""passing the 1071 Highlands on the way.""

Take cover! Get down! Comrades, hang on! Battalion Commander, we've already warded off an attack from the enemy again. Our Company Commander said, We must fight! Hand grenades! Who has more? Comrades, we've already stood our ground for 24 hours and warded off 7 attacks from the enemy. Even if we are down to the last one, we will never let the enemies pass under our feet! Fight to the death to defend our front! ""I don't believe in missions impossible to complete. ""I don't believe in difficulties impossible to overcome.""

Well, to be honest, it feels like I've been running my whole life. Is this too much? Am I going too fast? It's kind of what I do... You know what? Let's back up. This is the island where I'm from. It had everything. Sandy beaches, cascading waterfalls, public access to loop-de-loops. And, I never had to catch a school bus because I could run across the entire island in less than two seconds. Also, there was no school. I know, pretty sweet island, right? Yeah! I was born with extraordinary powers and was told to keep them secret. And like any kid, I did the exact opposite. Whoo-hoo! That's Longclaw. She took care of me. She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi... if Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice. Sonic, someone could have seen you. No one saw me. I'm too fast! And I wanted to bring you this. Get down! Turns out, with great power comes great power-hungry bad guys. And I led them right to us. Listen carefully, Sonic. You have a power unlike anything I have ever seen. And that means someone will always want it. The only way to stay safe is to stay hidden. This world is on the far side of the universe. You should be safe there. - I don't want to go without you. - You must. These rings will be your most important possession. If you're ever discovered, use one. Never stop running. Now go! Longclaw! Goodbye, Sonic. No! No! Come on, one car? I'm bored. Tom, do you read me? Are you there? No, Wade, I'm actually on a yacht in Barbados. With Rihanna. OMG. That's amazing. Please send pics. No, Wade. I'm at the speed trap. Already? How did you get back so fast? Barbados is in the ocean! Hang on, I think I got something. Hey, buddy! Where's the fire? Got kids living around here. I thought that was kind of funny. Sorry. What? Tom, we need you down on Main Street. There's been a violent gang shoot-out. Just kidding. A duck stole a bagel. But they do need it back. Whoa, buddy, you almost got yourself killed out there. What are you, some kind of adrenaline junkie? It must be rough being slow all the time. Tell you what. Today is your lucky day. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Have you ever felt so alive? This is great. You're doing amazing. Oh, geez! Good recovery. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Let's keep this our little secret, okay? You never saw me. I was never here. So what were you expecting? A dirty little hedgehog eating berries and struggling to survive? Think again. Because I am living my best life on Earth. I've got a library... a home gym, and a state-of-the-art security system. Oh, no. And, if I'm ever discovered, I'll follow Longclaw's instructions and use my rings to escape to a new planet. A nice, safe little world filled only with mushrooms. Gross, smelly mushrooms. I hate mushrooms. But let's not worry about all that. This is Green Hills. The greatest place on Earth. These are my people and, dare I say, I am their lovable space creature. So what if they don't know I exist? My favorite person is the Donut Lord. Protector of this town and defender of all creatures, big and small. Morning. Donald. Daisy. Daffy. Donut Lord lives with Pretzel Lady. She is super nice to animals and strangely was born without bones. Ouch, ouch, ouch. There is one person in town who's actually onto me. He calls me the blue devil. I almost caught him last night. Say hello to Crazy Carl. We have fun together. I know you're out there! And I know you're real! No, I'm not! Movie night is my favorite. Please, please, please, please, please. Yes! Keanu! You are a national treasure. - When I find you... - Pop quiz, hotshot. There's a bomb on a bus. ""Pop quiz, hotshot."" It's a classic line. Basically, we're like a family. Even though we haven't met yet. You don't zink your prolonged isolation is making you a bit crazy perhaps? Crazy? Me? No way, Doc. You got me all wrong. And despite all these so-called friends of yours, deep down... ...you're still rather lonely? Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever? Uh-uh. Hey! No, no, no, no. Get out of there. Come on. Oh, come on! Get out of there! Get out of there, you trash pandas. Maddie, as Green Hills' most respected veterinarian, what is the fastest way to exterminate a raccoon? Hi, Ozzy. Hello! You're glad to see me. You don't eat garbage, do you? What's that? - Is that what I think it is? - Uh-huh. Open it. Oh, it's kind of small. Is that bad? Just open it. ""Dear Thomas: We have reviewed your application to the San Francisco Police Department, and pending interdepartmental review and background check, we are happy to inform you that you have been selected to join our team."" - Oh, my God! - Wow. Oh, my God. Ta-da! ""San Francisco Sucks."" Oh! Wrong one! Ta-da! - You never had a doubt, huh? - No! Mm-mmm. - I can't believe this. - Oh, I know! You did it. Hey, what are those? Apartments for rent I found on Zillow. I thought Ozzy and I could fly there tomorrow and check out some neighborhoods. I mean, this is all happening so fast. Oh, man... It's the craziest thing. You apply for the job, you get the job. Well, pending a background check. Oh, man. Hope they don't find out about that time you used the neighbor's Wi-Fi. Correction: I'm still using the neighbor's Wi-Fi. But, Maddie, are you sure you're okay with this? Thomas Michael Wachowski, what did you do the entire time I was in veterinary school? I worked a second job to pay the rent and... A third job to pay tuition. You sacrificed for me. I'm happy to sacrifice for you. Babe, are you sure you're okay with this? I mean, there's been a Wachowski protecting this town for more than 50 years. This is a big change. I'm positive. It's time for this guy to get out there and prove himself. I love Green Hills, but, you know, I want to help people in real trouble. I want someone to turn to me in a life-and-death situation and I'll be there for 'em. I get it. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. Mmm! And so it is with a heavy heart, that I tell you all that I've accepted a position at the San Francisco Police Department, effective immediately. It's gonna be tough to leave my hometown and all my friendships. But this is something I feel like I need to do... to grow... as both an officer and a man. What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles? That wasn't so bad, right? Now all I got to do is... tell everyone who isn't a donut. Whoa, the playoffs! Oh! So cool. Bottom of the ninth, tie score. And exactly who you want at the plate with the game on the line: Sonic! But staring him down from the pitcher's mound is the most fearsome southpaw in Green Hills: Also Sonic. Okay. Focus, Sonic. If you win this game, you'll be the most beloved kid in Green Hills. Hit it to the guy in left! He's a real space case. I can't with that guy. Hey, batter Sonic. Hey, batter Sonic. ""Suh-wing,"" batter Sonic. I got it, I got it, I got it! I don't got it. Go home! Go home! Come on! Safe! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! I did it! Did you see that? I did it. I did it. I really am alone. All alone. Forever. I'm sure no one noticed that giant blue explosion, right? - Hey, Wade. - Hi, Tom. Uh, Wade here. What is going on? Well, gosh, I think the power's out. Yeah, no dur! The lights are out. The whole town is freaking out. - What should I do? - Okay, relax. Take a deep breath, call Gil, see if they can locate the downed line, then... call Zim and see if he can get his generator over to the Super Q so the food stays... fresh. Call Zim before Gil? - Call Gil... Hello? - I'll call you back. Wait! Hello? Was that the end of the instructions? Okay, all right. Uh, you can do this. What was the first thing he said to do? Right. Relax. Twenty minutes ago, an energy surge knocked out power across the entire Pacific Northwest. What do we know? Well, our first instinct was it was an EMP. But electromagnetic pulses don't have that kind of power. NASA has ruled out meteor strikes or solar flares. The Department of Energy says it's not a power plant malfunction. Well, sounds like we're really good at figuring out what it wasn't. This could be a prelude to a larger attack. I'm suggesting we scramble the Fifth and Sixth Regiment. No, no, no, no. This needs a much more sophisticated mind. Someone who understands technology. - You want to send in a lab rat? - Not just any lab rat. A lab rat with teeth. You're not suggesting who I think you're suggesting. - I know, he's a little weird. - Weird? - No. No way. - He's a psychological tire fire! But he's also brilliant. Five PhDs, IQ off the charts. And his drone tech is revolutionary! You're sure he can handle this? He has a perfect operations record. - Remember the coup in Pakistan? - No. Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan? - That's not even a country. - Exactly. And you can thank Robotnik for that. I can't believe you're bringing that freak into this. Neither can I, but... we have no choice. What the... Are you in charge here? - Yes, I am... - Nope! - My... - Wrong! - name... - I'm in charge! - is Major... - Me! - Ben... - I'm in charge. You've never seen anything like this before. It says I'm the top banana in a world full of hungry little monkeys. Allow me to clarify. In a sequentially ranked hierarchy based on level of critical importance, the disparity between us is too vast to quantify. - Agent Stone? - The Doctor thinks you're basic. I'm initiating a sweep sequence. Ten miles in every direction should suffice. - Is he still looking at me funny? - Yes, he is. Tell him to stop or I'll pull up his search history. If you don't stop looking at the Doctor, - he'll take a closer look... - I'm not deaf. And tell him his men report to me now. Blah-blah-blah. Excuse me? Listen, pal, I don't know if you realize... I'm sorry, Major. What was your name? - Benning... - Nobody cares! Nobody cares. Listen, Major Nobody Cares. You know why nobody cares who you are? Because nobody cares about your feeble accomplishments. And nobody cares how proud your mommy is that you're now reading at a third-grade level. - Mmm. - Have you finished Charlotte's Web yet? Spoiler alert: She dies in the end. But she leaves a big creepy egg sac. Ah... my babies. Whoo! Look what came out of my egg sac. You know what I love about machines? They do what they're told. They follow their programming. They don't need time off to get drunk and put the boat in the water. Now you do what you're told. Stand over there on the edge of your personal abyss... and watch my machines do your job. - Can you feel it, Stone? - I can feel it, Doctor. It's evolution, Stone. It's evolution! - Agent Stone? - Doctor. Do you see anything useful in this image? - Nothing at all, Doctor. - Of course you don't. Your eyes weren't expertly trained to spot tracks by the Native-American Shadow Wolves. That's extraordinary. No. What's extraordinary is, I've determined the exact height, weight and spinal curvature of this creature, and my computer can't find a single match for it anywhere in Earth's animal kingdom. This blackout was not a terrorist attack, and that's no baby bigfoot. This guy is something else... entirely. Divert all search units to the site of the footprint. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for me. Okay, okay, everything is fine. You played some baseball, got a little upset, lightning shot out of your butt, and now they're coming for you. All right, all right. Earth isn't safe anymore. Time for plan B. Mushroomville. But I gotta take my stuff. Okay, essential items only. Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair gel, night-light. Funny hat. This half-eaten cantaloupe. Oh, and my scented candle. My entire comic book collection. Bean bag chair. Can a bean bag chair fit in a backpack? No, no, no. Of course not. That's stupid. Okay, what else? The rings! The rings, yes, of course. Here we go. Ring time. Mushroom planet, here I come. Oh, no. They're right outside. I gotta go somewhere else. Goodbye, cave. - Hey. - Hey. Whatcha doing? Just coloring with Jojo and Rachel. Ah, that sounds... half-fun. Hey, exciting stuff here. We had a power outage. The whole town went dark. It was like a sign telling me to get out of Dodge. - Wade must have lost his mind. - Yeah. And he does not have much to lose. How's your sister? Did she convince you to leave me yet? No, but she did tell me to check your phone for dating apps. The only apps on my phone are the ones that came with it. - And the Olive Garden. - Ah. - Because when you're there... - You're family. No way. The raccoons are back. And they are in for a surprise. Your surprise better not be my tranquilizer gun. They're just hungry. And also, that's for bears. - Good. Now I know it'll work. - Tom! I'm kidding. I'm just gonna use it to scare 'em. Possibly to death. - Love you, honey, bye! - Tom... D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Okay, I'm in. With minimal damage to Donut Lord's property. Here we go. It didn't work out on Earth, but that's okay. You're going to a safe world. A nice, safe world full of mushrooms. Mushrooms that'll be your only friends. That sounds awful. I can't do this. You have to do it. There's no other option. All right. SFPD... pending background check. Paws in the air! Uh, meow? Ow! ""San... Francisco?"" No. What? The blue devil. - Donut Lord? - It can talk. You're not... You're not here to abduct me, are you? You abducted me. Okay, that's a fair point. What are you? Why are you hiding out in my garage? I needed somewhere safe. And you're the only person I could think of, Donut Lord. Why do you keep calling me Donut Lord? 'Cause you talk to donuts. And then eat them if they get out of line. Again, fair. Wait, wait, wait. Where are all the mushrooms? Why am I still on Earth? What is... Oh, no! I lost my rings. What? What's happening? Is this your mother ship? I'm not in the mood to get probed. You think you're worried? I'm not even wearing pants. What the... - They're coming for me! - Who's coming for you? - What's that got to do with me? - I don't have time to explain, but you have to help me. No, I don't. Why? Well, my legs, which normally would be classified as lethal weapons, feel like spaghetti. I need your help. Please. It's life or death. Fine. Come with me. Uh, little help? All right, stay here. And be quiet. Good plan. Great plan! We're already working so well together. Practically finishing each other's sentences. Okay, bye. Hello there! Can I help you? Good morning, my rural chum. I'm... from the power company, investigating the blackout. If you don't mind, I'd like to take a few readings inside your house? No kidding? You're from the power company? - Mmm. - Oh, you must know my buddy Spencer. - We play softball together. - Ah! Spence. He's a good man. - Yeah. Come on in! - Great. Take all the readings you need. Except, uh... Doesn't the power company usually take their readings from outside the house? That way they can check them even if you're not home. Also, my buddy Spencer works for the gas company, and he's more of an Ultimate Frisbee guy. So you want to tell me why you think I'm dumb enough to just let you walk inside my house? - I'm sorry, Mister... - Wachowski. But everyone calls me Tom. Except my dentist, he calls me Tim. But it's gone on for so long now that it would just be weird if I corrected him. Well, Tom, whose-dentist- calls-him-Tim. You may have noticed that this entire town has been experiencing a power outage. Yep, no lights. Picked up on that. Twenty minutes ago, I tracked an energy pulse with a similar signature to the one that caused that disruption. Listen, uh, Mister... Doctor. Dr. Robotnik. But my dentist calls me Rob. Hmm. Look, uh, Dr. Robotskeez. Um, I'm sure what you're here for is very serious, but it's got nothing to do with me. You can ask anyone in town. - Everyone knows me. - I bet they do. I'm sure you're hella popular with the Jebs and Merles and Billy Bobs, in this glorified gas-station rest stop. Betcha go way back to the days of tippin' cows and playin' in a jug band! And maybe someday you'll achieve your goal of getting a Costco card or adopting a Labradoodle. But the reality is, I surpassed everything you're ever going to do... before I was a toddler. I was spitting out formulas while you were still spitting up formula. I was breastfed, actually. Nice. Rub that in my orphan face. Mr. Wachowski, are you familiar with US Code 904, Title 10, Article 104? - Yeah, who isn't... - ""Anyone... who attempts to aid an enemy of the United States shall suffer death."" And if I'm the one that catches you, it'll be even worse. Worse than death? Okay, I'm a ball, a normal ball. I'm blending in like a ball. Shh. Stop talking. No, you stop talking. Be quiet, Sonic. You be quiet, Sonic. Oh, I hope they aren't scanning me with X-rays. I had kind of an embarrassing lunch. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. I'm freaking out! Why don't you have your staircase carpeted? Compared to what I... - Old pipes. - Yeah. Probably just the house settling. Nothing to see here! Hey! Here's the thing. I'm never wrong. Well, first time for everything, I guess. Would you like some cake? I hear raccoons have the cleanest mouths of any animal that routinely eats garbage. Look at that. I was right. Note the lack of surprise. Shall we try this again? I'm going to give you five seconds to tell me where it is. Five... I don't know what you're talking about. - Four. - Hey, tough guy. I'm a cop, and you're threatening an officer. How can you threaten somebody who never existed? Three... Come on! Rack your brain. You might be able to come up with some lame excuse to go on living in two... one. Wait! Don't hurt him! This feels excessive. Stay behind me. Hiya! Don't worry. I got it right where I want it! Can you believe Amazon is gonna deliver packages with these things? This was a horrible plan! What was I thinking? I'm gonna puke! Come on! We gotta get out of here. Oh, don't tell me that's all you got! I'm just getting started! Let me know if you want to go round two with the blue. Doctor! Are you okay? I saw a guy race out of here and thought... That you should stop them? Open your mouth... and say you thought that you should stop them. No, I thought that maybe I should check to see if you were okay... You know what's hard about being the smartest person in the world? - Everyone else seems stupid. - Stupid, yes! Way to go! You got that one. Whatever this creature is, it's our job to secure it, neutralize it, uncover the source of its power. And if it resists, we take it apart... piece by piece. See what makes it tick. - Stone? - Doctor? Call Optical Illusions. Tell them I need new frames. They know what kind I like. Oh, and bring that quill. Yes, Doctor. All right, pal, you need to start talking right now. Who are you? What are you? I'm a hedgehog! I feel like that's obvious. - And I'm in big trouble. - Oh, you're in big trouble? You're not the one who punched some sort of government weirdo back there. You think you have problems? I lost my rings. Rings? What are you talking about? Okay. Rings are how all advanced cultures travel between worlds. And now mine are on top of a pointy building - I've only ever seen on your skintight T-shirt. - Hey. So, I'd like you to take me to San Francisco, so I can get back my rings and use them to go to the mushroom planet. - Mushroom planet. - Yes! Right. - Okay, pal, out you go. - I'm sorry, what? Look, this is the worst possible time for me to get myself into trouble, okay? You asked me to save your life, I saved your life. Now, please, go find your rings. And your mushroom land. Hopefully I'm gonna wake up in a hospital bed and the doctor's gonna tell me that my colonoscopy was a big success, okay? So goodbye. - Okay. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Why aren't you leaving? - I don't know where San Francisco is. - It's west. - West? Straight shot, can't miss it. Fine. That's cool. I'm totally cool saying goodbye now. So, as I crashed into the cold, dark water of the Pacific, I realized a few things. A, I have no idea where I'm going. B, saltwater stings. C, I shouldn't even be on this planet right now, but I am. Why? Because you shot me! - I know. - You shot me! All right, I heard you the first time. You don't have to pile it on. Good grief. I'm wet. I'm cold. There's a fish on my head! And clearly, I'm not gonna be able to do this on my own. All right, get in the truck. Really? You're gonna help me? I guess it is a little bit my fault that all this is happening to you. Not a little bit. Entirely. It is entirely your fault. Okay, it's entirely my fault. Are you coming? Yes. Road trip! Whoop-whoop! What am I doing? All right, there's gonna be rules on this trip. Number one, do exactly as I say all the time. - Got it? - Got it, Donut Lord. Would you stop with the ""Donut Lord""? I have a name. It's Tom. I'm Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. So you've been spying on us all for years. I wouldn't call it ""spying."" We were all just hanging out, only I wasn't invited and no one knew I was there. I can't believe Crazy Carl was right all this time. Yeah. You should call him Super Observant Carl instead. - Oh, my God, stop the car right now! - What? What? The World's Largest Rubberband Ball? - We gotta see it! - No. No. No, this is not some fun family road trip, okay? The government wants to dissect you. And arrest me. This is serious. Eh, you're right, it was lame. Gift shop was cool, though. I got you a mouse pad. When are we gonna get there? We will get there when we get there. I'm gonna go check in with Wade, see if he knows what's going on. You're gonna see Wade in that glass thing? What is it, a teleportation box? It's a pay phone. It's mostly for drug dealers and fugitives from the law, which is us. Stay in the car. I don't want anybody seeing you. Fine. Huh? Okay, okay. That is the coolest place on Earth, but you have to stay in the car. Be strong. Be strong. Hmm. Hello. Green Hills Police Department. - Wade, it's me. - Hi. I'm so glad that you called. Uh, so, some guys came in asking some questions. Uh, they're a little creepy. Kind of reminded me of the guys from Men in Black, but not as likable or charming as Will Smith. Wait, what kind of questions? Um, questions about terrorism? I told them that I've gone ice fishing with Tom. He doesn't know how to make a bomb. He can't even make bait in the cold. All right, Wade, listen to me. This is really important. Don't tell them that we talked, okay? You know, I think they already know. Mr. Wachowski. Tom. I want you to know that the only other person who ever punched me in the face was the school bully. He hit me in the cafeteria, causing a blunt-force contusion to the soft tissue surrounding my orbital bone. Humiliated me in front of the entire school! And do you know what I did in response? Uh, I'm assuming that you reported him to the principal's office 'cause that kind of behavior is really unacceptable. No. I examined the inefficiency of a world where brawn trumped brain and I used technology to resolve that inefficiency. The boy ate his meals through a straw for a year. And I have never lost a fight again. Until today. Hey, hooray for me then, huh? No, because you're about to become the bully with the straw! I'm coming for you, Mr. Wachowski. And when I catch you, I'll... Hello. Hello? Hello, hello, hello? I think he actually hung up, because I notice that the light isn't on. Thank you, Officer Brainfart. If you give me a second, I can get an outside line. No. Don't be bothered. You just sit there and be ""u""... ...'seless. No one's gonna erase my memory here? I will tell people about this! Okay, not exactly the healthiest meal, but... Sonic? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! - Whoo! - Yeah! Howdy, pardner! I'm not your partner. Come on. We're leaving. But there's a ZZ Top cover band. You gotta see their beards. You're gonna have to catch 'em some other time. Let's go. Get up! If we stay, I won't say another word for the rest of the trip, starting... now. Welcome to the Piston Pit. What can I get you fellas? I want nachos and buffalo wings, oh, and guac. Funny word, isn't it? Guac, guac! Guac. Hey, no kids allowed in here. What's he got on, some kind of mask? Oh, he's actually 43 years old and, um, suffers from a very rare skin disease that stunts his growth and makes him look, uh, like that. The face, I was born with. The confidence, I picked up along the way. - Make his a Mello Yello, please. - Okay. - You owe me one. - I never sat on a barstool before. So squishy! Oh, look at this. It spins. - Yes. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - That's nice. - I feel sick. Are you having fun? Gonna check this off the ol' bucket list, huh? - Big night for you. - What's a bucket list? A bucket list is, uh... It's a list of things you want to do in your life before you, well, kick the bucket. I've never kicked a bucket, either! Oh, I gotta make my list. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, Sonic! Uh-huh. What? What's the matter? There's so much stuff I've never done. And now that I'm leaving Earth forever, I guess I missed my chance. Well, I guess this is the kind of place you could get a lot of living done in a short period of time. I suppose we can spare an hour. What? You're gonna bucket-list with me? - Sure, why not? - You won't regret this. Oh, I'm pretty sure I will. New high score! Yippee-ki-yay! Ah-ha! Wait a second, is this bull missing a head or does it have two butts? This is easy. - Okay. - Ha-ha! Yeehaw! I'm a cowboy, baby! I'm okay. Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! Ha-ha-ha! Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. Nice work, Romeo. Glad you're having a good time. I am having a good time! I'm having the best time. I mean, what could go wrong? Uh... Can we help you? We don't like your kind around here. Our kind? What kind is that? Hipsters. - How dare you. - Oh, hey. You know what? We were leaving anyway. Weren't we? - There's not a problem here. - No, no, no, it's okay. No, no, no, we're leaving. I know exactly how to handle this situation. Pop quiz, hotshot. You just picked a fight with a poorly disguised hedgehog who's seen way too many action movies. What do you do? What do you do? Huh. Am I crazy? It's supposed to break, right? Dink! Dink-dink! Break, please. Break, please. Break this bottle, please. - Please, please, please. - Uh, Sonic? Uh-oh! - Oh-ho-ho-ho! - Nice going! Thanks! It's awesome right? All right, who's next? Who wants some? Who do I get to beat up? Hey! Has anybody seen my waitress? Still waiting on those buffalo wings. Why, you! Ha-ha-ha! Uh-oh! Really? Ol! - So, should we get out of here? - Yeah, time to go. That was amazing! Wait a second. Did we even pay our tab? It doesn't matter! Watch this, watch this. I always wanted to do this. - Get 'em! - See ya, suckers! I can't say for sure, but I think they liked me. Come on! Don't let 'em get away! - Oh, yes! - Yeah! - Yes! - Ouch! He got you pretty good. I'm all right. I've been hit harder. Did you see how much toilet paper I used? The next person that goes into that bathroom will have nothing to wipe with! The floors were sticky. The crowd was rough. And the odds were against us. But there was no stopping Donut Lord and the Blue Blur. Scratch another one off my list. You are a weird little dude. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Okay. So what are we gonna do now? I'm gonna pass out watching TV. I think you should too. But this is my last night on Earth. I want to soak up every last second. All right, well, anything you can find to do in this room, you knock yourself out. Good times. Oh, come on. That's awful. What did you eat? I think it's called a chili dog? You might want to check your fur on that one, buddy. Hey. So, what's this next planet you're supposed to go to like? It's no Earth, I can tell you that. There's no people, just breathable air and giant mushrooms and stuff. Well, look at it this way. At least you won't be the only ""fun-guy."" No. Don't ever do that again. I liked it. I'm really gonna miss this place. I know I have to leave Earth to be safe, but what if Longclaw was wrong? Maybe I could have a life here. All right. We should get some sleep. You sleep. Don't worry about me. I'm gonna stay up all night enjoying Earth while I can. Sure, kid. As long as we're on the road by 8:00. I ate a chili dog. That's why my farts smell. Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing an act of domestic terrorism. Wachowski is considered armed and dangerous. Any information regarding his whereabouts should be reported to local authorities immediately. Did he say where he was going? Maybe. Maybe not. Like I'd ever tell you. Stand down, Agent Stone. This well-meaning citizen obviously doesn't understand the urgency of the matter. Really? Now that's what I call good cop, bad cop. Hoy! Left yourself open. Judging by the quickest route to San Francisco, the approximate speed of their vehicle, and local weather conditions... They should be... right about... here. - That's brilliant, sir. - Thanks... for nothing. - So, what's on your bucket list? - Who, me? Yeah. Everyone has a bucket list, right? Sure, but... I mean, you're the one leaving Earth, and... I'm not planning on dying anytime soon. Don't be so sure. Your best friend is a magnet for danger. Are you anointing yourself as the bestie? Mm-hmm. A little presumptuous, but... I mean... What, no... I like you, of course, but, you know, we're not best friends. You tucked me in last night. Fine, fine, fine. Best animal friend. - That would be my dog, Ozzy. - Okay... let's drop this increasingly humiliating topic of conversation. Bucket list. Give it to me! Okay, there is one thing. In Green Hills, I've always felt, I don't know, more like a babysitter than a real cop, you know? So I want a chance to prove myself, under real pressure. I'm gonna move to San Francisco, become a street cop. And, I don't know, see if I have what it takes. What? Why... Why is your face doing that? You're leaving Green Hills? Okay. B-B-But why? Why would you leave Green Hills? This may be hard for you to understand, but Green Hills is a small town. It's a very small town. Uh, it's not small. There are hundreds of people. That's a small town, dude! It's a perfect town, and the people need you. Please. I clean out their gutters. I jump-start their cars in the winter. They could call anybody to do that. Sure, they can call anybody, but they don't. They call you. Eeny, meeny, miny... mayhem. - You're not making any sense. - Would you calm down? You come from a great town with great people and by my count, zero bad guys trying to kill you! Besides, what could possibly be more important than protecting the people you care about? - Look, I get your poi... - Whoa! Yeah! You know what? I was wrong about you. You're not the Donut Lord at all. You're more like the Jerk Lord. Have you noticed the harpoon stuck in our dash? Sonic! I was forced from my home. Your home is perfect, and you're leaving it. Why would you do that? - Your body! - Oh, no, not again! Hey! Hold on! - Why? - Because I'm gonna do this. Sonic! Sonic! Guess I had a bonus life. Oh, yeah, baby! Sonic, one. Big Tank, zero. I'm sorry. - Did we get that on camera? - How are you not dead? I have no idea. - Do you see me dancing? - Yes, I saw you dance. Is that all you got? No, but thank you for asking. - Uh-oh. - Sonic! Get back in the truck! You go. I'll catch up. Ha! I think that tank just had a baby. Incoming! - It's my turn! - You just had one. It's mine! Hey, stop fighting or I'm taking that thing away! Yeah, right, Dad. Where are you going? Just drive the car. I'll take care of this. And if I don't make it, just ditch me. You seem good at that. Hey, everyone! Welcome back to my livestream. Today we're destroying robots. Step one. Yes, we did it! We did not do it. Who is this guy? Ever wonder where your tax dollars are going? My turn. Here, just keep us going straight. I put it in cruise control. I feel just like Vin Diesel. ""It's all about family, Tom."" Quick suggestion. Roll up into a ball and smash him with your body. Whoa! Where'd you learn how to drive? Here. In this truck. It's happening as we speak. I can't reach it. Bring him in closer. - What? - Bring it in closer! - Hit the brakes. - Oh, you mean this one? The other brakes! Ha-ha! Whoo! Oh! Give me a big, fat break! Aw, this one is cute. Let's keep him. Aah! Oh, come on! How could something so adorable be so terrible? You've got car insurance, right? Buzz off. That doesn't sound good. - No, beeping is bad. Get rid of it! - I'm trying. Throw it out the win... Throw it anywhere! - I can't get it off. - All right, I'm pulling over. - Did I get it? - Nope. Here. Hold still. It's going, it's going... It's still here. Get off me. Ha-ha! Nailed it! Sonic! No, no, no, no, no. Hey. Come on. You're all right. Wake up. Wake up. Did we get 'em? Oh. No, there they are. They are real survivors, those two. Can we have a moment? Pin yourself to the wall. You know, I won't miss you when you're gone. Human beings are unreliable and stupid, and I care very little about them. But my machines are diligent, relentless. They're everything to me! Huh? Mmm? Come on, buddy. You're gonna be all right. You'll be all right. - Is Maddie here? - No, no. - Not today. Goodbye. - It's an emergency! - Bye-bye. - Rachel, stop! Maddie! Don't do this. This is important. - Oh, my God! Rachel, let him in. - I am calling the police. No, I am calling the FBI. I am calling the CIA. - Stop. Don't do that. - I am calling your mother. - Okay, got it. - Maddie, can we talk? Tom, what's going on? You're all over the news. I've been trying to call you. I had to ditch my phone so they couldn't track me. - Ditch his phone? - Track you? - Uncle Tommy! - Jojo! Hey! Now your niece is an accessory to treason. - No, she's not. - Calm down. Calm down? I will not calm down! - Enough. - Yes, calm down. Stop talking. No. Ozzy, please. Good to see you too. Oh, little Lord Baby Jesus. What is that, Tom? Is that plutonium? Is it e-mails? Yes, it's plutonium. Can we please go in the other room and talk... Stop it, Ozzy. Quit it! This is why I told you he was no good. - I'm not engaging. - No, Ozzy, quit it. Ozzy, no! Ozzy, no! Oh, catch me, Jojo. Oh, thank God. Can I get a glass of water? I just thought you might like a latte with steamed Austrian goat milk. Who do I look like, an imbecile? Of course I want a latte. I love the way you make them! Ready the prototype. With this kind of power, my machines can finally reach their full potential. He's gonna be okay, Jojo. Oh, thank God. He's gonna be okay, right? I'm a vet, Tom. I don't even know what I'm looking at here. He's a hedgehog. Or so he says. - It talks? - Almost constantly. Okay. - Holy... - What? His pulse is super-fast. That actually might be normal for him. I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie. I don't know his physiology. He doesn't seem to have any broken bones. He's just really banged up. Oh, look at his poor little feet. Hang in there, buddy. You're gonna be all right. Jojo? Untie your mother. Jojo! Untie Mommy. Sweetie. Jojo! I have to go to the bathroom. - He's gonna be okay, right? - Uh... He'll snap out of this. He'll wake up soon? Oh, smelling salts! Don't you have, like, vet smelling salts, like for cats or parakeets or something? No. They don't make cat smelling salts. - They should. - I have human smelling salts in my human first aid kit. Okay. - Here we go. - Come on, buddy. Gotta go fast! - Whoa. - Where am I? What year is it? Is The Rock president? Whoa, buddy, you're okay. Calm down. Oh, hi, Pretzel Lady! Hi. - Tom? - Yeah. Can I talk to you, please? Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest. You got it. I am great at resting. I rest faster than anybody. Still talking. Uh, first of all, can we take a moment to acknowledge how under control I've been? - Amazing. - Didn't freak out. - No. - Totally calm. - Thank you. - Ahh. Second of all... What the heck is going on? Is that thing an alien? Okay, so, remember how Crazy Carl is always going on - about the blue devil? - The blue devil! - That's him? He's real? - Yeah. What is he doing here? What are you doing here? I... kinda sorta... shot our little blue friend with your tranq gun. - No, you did not. - I didn't mean to. This is kinda hard for me to explain. And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy. He has to get to the Transamerica building, and I promised I'd take him. Uh-uh! Aliens? Maddie, your husband's lost his mind. Use this as an opportunity to leave him. No one would judge you. So you won't hurt your feet anymore. - Really? - Uh-huh. No one's ever given me a gift before. I gotta check that off my bucket list. All right! Looking good! Okay. You said you wanted to help people in real trouble, right? Well, that's what you're doing. Blue alien hedgehogs still count as people. Right? - I think so too. - Yeah. - I think. - Okay. I love you. Did I tell you that already? I don't deserve you. You know that? I know that. So, you're supposed to be Tom's best friend that he won't shut up about. Well, I don't see the appeal. Stop! That is very gross. - Hey. - Hey. So, my truck still runs, but it's pretty much totaled. You think your sister would mind if we borrowed her car? You have got to be kidding me! - She'll be fine. - Yeah, let's do that. Mm-hmm. This is my house! Coming through! Whoa, whoa! Now this is my turn, and I go around you. Sorry! And... - perfect park. - What are you, crazy? Is there anything you didn't hit? Why did we let the alien drive? Hey, I got us here. And please, five stars. - So, this is it? - That's it. That's your pyramid. Wow, look at that thing! What happens now? - Oh. He's... gone. - Yep. No good. You need a special key to get to the roof. What now? Time for me to abuse the power entrusted to me. We got a jumper on the roof. Gotta get up there fast or we're gonna have a human pancake on our hands. You came all the way from Montana. Yeah. That's how serious it is. Okay. You just saved a life. How much longer? I can't breathe in here. Hello? Anybody there? Do you have your child in that bag? No. I mean, yes, it's a child, but it's not mine. It's not your child. Relax. I'm a cop, okay? Plus, he likes it in there, don't you, buddy? Why would I like it in here? This is worse than the dog cage you had me in earlier. Such a kidder. - Okay. - No, I'm scared of the dark! Is anybody there? What were you keeping in this bag? A jar of pickled farts? All right. What are we looking for? This. Okay. What happens now? Now all I have to do is think of where I want the other end of the ring to appear, and I throw it. So that's it? We did it? Yeah. We did it! Hey. Sorry we didn't get to do everything on your bucket list, pal. It's okay. I did the ones I needed the most. You two are so cute. - Oh, please. What? - We are not. No. We're not cute. We are a couple of loose cannons just living by our own rules. Exactly. - Really? - Yeah. And our rules include expressing heartfelt emotions. If you say so. - Okay, then. - All right. - Um, you gotta go, right? - Yeah, I gotta go. I gotta go. We gotta go too. See... All right, bye-bye. Just one more thing. I'm sorry I was so hard on you. I know it's a tough decision for you to leave Green Hills. Walking away from something you care about has to be painful. You're not sure you really want to go, huh? I don't want to go, but I can't stay. As long as I'm here, I put everyone in danger. I can't do that. I just want you to know that these last two days have been the best two days of my life. You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually gonna miss you, you little blue devil. I'll miss you too, Donut Lord. Thank you. For what? For saving my life. Okay. Did someone leave their ""Find My Phone"" on? Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. Wachowski. Are you enjoying the clam chowder? It's the government wack job who keeps trying to kill us. Unsuccessfully! Nice of you to swing by on your way to Comic-Con. Yeah, what are you wearing? It's a flight suit, designed to modulate my body temperature and reduce drag. Yeah, and yet you still are one. Ooh-hoo! Good one. You are catching fire, Thomas. Oh, and speaking of heat, I see you've taken a lover. Does she have a name or should we just call her ""collateral damage""? Hey, watch your mouth. Unless you want a little more of what I gave you earlier? I punched him in the face. Oh! He punched him right in the face! It was awesome! The time for talking is over! It's time to push buttons. Your flying eggs are pretty impressive, Mr. Eggman, but let's face it, you'll never catch me. Confidence! A fool's substitute for intelligence. - That's not good. - Uh... Sonic, I know you got the super-speed and everything, - but Maddie and I... - Totally defenseless? Probably gonna get blown up? Pretty much, yeah. Don't worry. I know exactly what to do. I was not expecting that. But I was expecting not to expect something, so it doesn't count. Pew, pew-pew-pew, pew-pew-pew-pew! Oh! Come on! Come on, come on, come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no! Oh! Hi, Tom. Glad you're here. Could use some help. Old Bessie's about to give birth. Give me a minute. Aah. Can I give you one genius piece of advice? Don't run. It'll only hurt more if you do. And it's bad for your joints. They've proved it. All right, Eggman. You wanna get fast? Let's get fast. The hard way it is. That was an illegal left, by the way. So, here we are again. We've been through so much together. Now you understand why there's a psychotic robot doctor chasing a supersonic blue hedgehog. Want to know how it ends? Yeah, me too. How is this possible? No one's ever caught up to me before. Coming through! Sacrebleu! Excusez-moi, monsieur! Here we go. Room to open it up. I can't lose him! If you can't beat 'em, blind 'em. Lost visual contact. You're not allowed up there! It's one of the Seven Wonders! Get out of here! You're an astonishing little creature. It'll be fun to take you back to the lab for a litany of invasive exploratory procedures. Any last words? Guac. I like that word. I don't have to tell you how many scientific breakthroughs have been made possible by animal testing. You're being very selfish. Going my way? What the... Who the hell do you think you are? I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a... Autopilot, adjust. Why? Why would you throw your life away for this thing? That's why I don't have friends. Next thing you know, you're somebody's best man. They want to have the wedding out of town. Like nobody has anything better to do! Anyway, where were we? Oh, yes. You were about to die. That's our sheriff you're messing with. And our blue devil... who as everyone can see is a very real creature, and not at all invented by me. - Oh, careful. - Just... Just put it away. Tom? I don't mean to be indelicate here, but someone should get some ice, keep the body fresh. He's just a silly little alien. He didn't belong here! That little alien knew more about being human than you ever will. His name was Sonic. This was his home. And he was my friend. He's all yours. Everyone, get back! I think you have something that belongs to me. Whoa. This is my power. And I'm not using it to run away anymore. I'm using it to protect my friends. Ooh! Now you've done it! Guess what, Eggman? I'm not leaving Earth. You are. Donut Lord? - I told you, you got this. - Hey, we got this. - I think these belong to you. - Thank you very much. No more pushing people off of buildings. You know I can't promise that. - You did pretty good, space hog. - Thanks, Donut Lord. You're gonna have to explain this ""Donut Lord"" thing. Nope, sorry. That's for me and the little guy. Right? - We got our thing, you got your thing with your... sister. - Oh, my God, my sister. Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast. Jojo, put on my Fitbit... so I can at least get some steps. We can never go back there. I mean, are we? 'Cause it kind of feels like we're home right now. Really? I kind of feel like I checked the ""save a life"" box off my bucket list. Now all I want to do is spend my life with the people I care about. I want to check that box. Okay, I like that. All right, everybody. Nothing to see here. Let's disperse. Just another ordinary day in Green Hills. Carl, I'll take that chain saw. Come on. Let's go! You act like you've never seen a fight between an intergalactic space rodent and a robot with a doctorate. You got enough there? - Yes, Mr. Manager. - Need any more? You get that away. Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski? Yes? A token of appreciation from your government, for keeping quiet about recent incidents, which never occurred. Wow! - Wonder what it is. - Money to fix the house? - Letter from the President? - You'll see. Okay. - Olive Garden. - Hmm, yeah. The way you said ""You'll see"" made me think it was something better than the things we said. Have you tried their Never Ending Pasta Bowl? It never ends. - That sounds... fancy. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, thank you. We appreciate the gesture. Oh, hey. I guess we can close the file on that Robotnik guy, huh? Just disappeared. I'm sorry, but no such person exists or ever has existed. I wish that were true. You haven't by any chance been in contact with a certain alien creature since the incident, have you? Uncle Sam would love to have a chat with him. Very casual. Brunch, perhaps. Oh, you mean the little blue guy. - Mmm. - No. - No, nothing. No. - Mm-mmm. - Doubt we'll ever hear from him again. - Mm-mmm. Very well. Okay. - Thank you. - Great. Mmm. Yep. To be honest, I'm pretty pumped about the pasta bowl. So, do you guys wanna watch a movie or what? Sorry, buddy, it's a school night. It's time for you to go back to your cave. What? It's 3:00 in the afternoon! You know how you get when you're tired. Come on. Me? I'm not like anything. - You guys are so uncool. - Yeah, yeah, we know. Hey, buddy, where you going? You said I have to go back to my cave. We did. Oh, my... Are you kidding me? I can't believe it. How did you... It's... It's all here. Look at this! Are you kidding? And the beanbag? No way! How did you even get this? And you got it all the way over... Oh! I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it! Well, welcome home. Thank you, so much. Oh, no, you don't. No second-best animal friends allowed in my room. Wait. What are you doing? Stay away from me. Stop it! I'm warning you. I've got nunchucks! Hey, stop. Okay, you can stay. My grasp on sanity remains... absolute. Isn't that right, Agent Stone? Why don't you get a head start? Do some rock-connaissance. Rock-connaissance! Come on! That's hilarious! What's the matter with you? Here's the ""sitch."" Uninhabited planet. No resources, no supplies, no apparent way home. A lesser man would die here. I'll be home by Christmas. Rock-connaissance! Come on! Cheer up! If these readings are accurate, he's here. I found him. I just hope I'm not too late. Subtitles by explosiveskull www.OpenSubtitles.org, There once was a peculiar doctor, known for his extraordinary ability. He could talk to animals. Dr. Dolittle's reputation spread far and wide. Even the queen of England called on him. So grateful for his help, she gifted him a wondrous sanctuary, whose doors were open to all creatures. His days belonged to the animals, but his heart belonged to one woman: Lily, the fearless explorer. They traveled the globe going on great adventures, defending creatures who could not defend themselves. They made an extraordinary team. Soon, that team became a family. With Lily by his side, Dolittle never felt more alive, until one day, she left on an adventure. Lily died at sea. Heartbroken, he locked the gates of the manor and completely retreated from the world. As for me and the animals whose lives he'd saved, we were left to wonder... could anyone save his? Until one morning, a most unlikely creature found its way into Dolittle's life. A very special boy. In a time where people thought of animals only as possessions, food or sport, this boy felt quite differently. This way, me scattered squirrel. Right. Junior flushes 'em. You shoot 'em. Yeah? Right. Good plan, Dad. Get ready. - Shoulder your gun. - Do I have to, Uncle? Come on, boy. Duck! Duck! Duck, duck! - Duck! Duck! - There, there they go. Shoot, shoot, shoot. You got him. You got him. You got him. Shoot, shoot, shoot. - Oh, oh, no, I can't. - Shoot, shoot, shoot! You can't keep missing on purpose. Oh, look. He hit something this time. Oh, no. We have to help him. Aye. We never leave an animal suffering. Not on our error. Here you go. He's a very odd boy. Follow Poly. ""Home of Dr. John and Lily Dolittle. We treat all animals."" Ah-ah. Follow Poly. Secret entrance. P-Poly? Where'd you go? Good... good... good dog. Big, hairy... It's not good. As far as I'm concerned, I'm the only human here. Just ignore them. There's no getting past a Kalahari snare, Doc. It's an ingenious design. I think you just caught yourself a boy. Let me see. Wait, I don't want to see. Just make it go away. Deep breaths, Doc. Dab-Dab's got your back. Don't be afraid, John. It's just a boy. This is an opportunity. Oh, this is a nightmare! - Oh, come on. - Pardon me. Whatever are you doing up there? I've come from Buckingham Palace on urgent business. Can you tell me if this is the home of John Dolittle? Who are you? You may call me Lady Rose. And you are? Stubbins. Could you help me down? This goes against Dolittle's rules. Why are humans against the rules again? If you let humans too close, you'll get hurt more than you would if you didn't let them in at all. Isn't that right, Doc? That's enough, everybody. Back to our routine. - We have a very full day. - John! Pull yourself together. You can't ignore people just because they're... people. What if they need help? Possum. Play dead. This is ridiculous. Chee-Chee, will you answer the door? You're the only one with arms. I think chess was enough pressure for one day. Chee-Chee, boy, this is what we trained for. Be brave and get rid of 'em. And don't forget your mantra. I am not a prisoner of fear? You are not a prisoner of fear. Have you been here before? The queen's told me all about it. It's a most unusual place. I'm prepared for anything. Wonderful. A gorilla answering the door. Just as the queen said. Oh, wait a minute. I have an injured squirrel. I should never have let you go. Hello? Oh, look at you. Aren't you peculiar posing as a twig? Move, please. This is my hiding spot. Not here. Are you all right down there? Yeah. Fine. - Go on. - Dr. Dolittle? - Yeah, right. - You have been summoned to Buckingham Palace by the queen herself. Hoo-ha. Go on. You should know, she's fallen gravely ill. Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I'm saying? Go... on. Go on and be gone! I don't care about anyone, anything, anywhere anymore. The birds will show you out. Right, everything's tidy. Lunch will be served in a minute now. Mmm! Smells lovely, Doc. Thanks very much. Hey, Doc, save some for us this time. Sorry, Doc. Guess I'm scared of kids, too. Don't worry about that. Come on, let's eat. I'm going to be offering today a brothy soup. You'll never believe what we caught in the net. The queen has asked for you by name, sir. Are you hard of hearing? I told you, I'm closed for business. What business? Treating humans. Intruder alert. Don't worry. I'm fine. Well, I'm not. My house is descending into chaos. I-Is he yours? I don't own anybody. Yoshi had an issue that he came to me with. He's always cold. I have an injured squirrel. I don't know what to do. How was he injured? I... I-I shot him. What? I can't hear you. I shot him, but it was an accident. Of course, an accidental firing upon. Humans never change. He's very hurt. Please help him. Take that. And this. I... I... I... I'm too beautiful to die. Oh. Yes? He's with us. Dab-Dab, Jip, light the lamps and disinfect the surgery. You will not tend to a squirrel while the queen of England's life hangs in the balance. Oh, you don't know me very well, do you? Don't drop him. We got a code red. Code red, code red, everybody. The doctor is back! Hang on, little buddy. Whew! I haven't done this in a while. Let's get everything the way Doc likes it. Don't worry. We got you, pal. Righto. Let's save this squirrel, shall we? Okay. When you wake up, everything will be fine. If I die, I swear I will haunt your house. Sterilize the scalpels. Do not lick any instruments. Patient's condition has stabilized. They're understanding him, and he's understanding them, in their own languages. Going through the left ventricle... it's brilliant. Wow. Dab-Dab, forceps, please. Here you go. That's a piece of celery. Forceps, Dab-Dab. Oh, sorry. Here you go. Still celery. Forceps? - Carrot, that is. - Forceps? That's a different piece of celery. Got it. Forceps. No, still celery. Never mind. I'll get it myself. I want to know how to talk to the animals. Chee-Chee, brow. My brow as well, when you've got a second. Right. Sorry. I'm going to come here and be Dolittle's apprentice. Her Majesty has designated this land a nature preserve. If she dies, the deed will be owned by the Treasury, and this place goes away. - Shut down? - Mm-hmm. There you are. Whoo, still got it, Doc. Oh, wow. Ah. There, Cheech. That's the spot. Keep an eye on Kevin, shall we? He may be prickly when the anesthetic wears off. Revenge. Okay, okay. Enough with the pampering. You need to go and help the queen. There are things I no longer do: work with humans or leave the house. - Or bathe. - Oh, exercise. Express emotional vulnerability. Wake up, John. If the queen dies, the Treasury takes the deed, and we'd lose this house. You're talking out of your tail feathers, Poly. The deed was for life. The last time I checked, I was very much alive. The queen's life, John, not yours. Look at that. It just rolls off my back. I knew I shouldn't have let monkeys proofread the contract. Elliot, Elsie, you are fired! It gets worse. We'll be thrown out of these gates right in the middle of hunting season! - What? - No, no, no. Breathe, Chee-Chee. We get kicked out if the queen dies? - We're gonna be hunted! - Everybody, calm down. - Look at the state of him now. - Fear not. I have an in at, uh, Regent's Park Zoo. Everyone, pack your bags! Ah-ah. You help the queen, or we are leaving. - You're bluffing. - Don't make me count. Don't make me count. One. Three! Two. All right! I'll do it. Marvelous. Right, let's get you ready to go, honey. - I'll go as I am. - Not looking like that. - Just grab my doctor's bag. - Get him. Apologies, Doc. Hold still, now. Take your paws off me! - This isn't gonna hurt a bit. - Let's clean him up. How dare you. - Whoa. - Oh, hey, guys. Arthur? How long have you been living in there? I don't know. What year is it? Dab-Dab's got the razor. That's still celery. Nighty-night, Doc. Dolittle used to travel all around the world. Look. Rummaging through my private projects, is it? How is he? Well, first things first, the squirrel's name is Kevin. Expect a full recovery. And after some violent grooming, it's been decided. We will accompany you to Buckingham Palace after all. Hmm. You are going back to whatever burrow you emerged from. Try not to shoot anything on your way home. Maybe I-I should stay here. I don't do well in crowds. We'll look after you, Cheech. But we all go together, just like the old days. Oh, don't forget Doc's forceps. That's a leek, Dab-Dab. Sure it is. Styx? No. Where are you? Oh. So, uh, would you care to come along? I know. I had other plans as well. Hurry up. Hurry up. Shh! Prepare my ride. Today's gonna be a good day. I'm gonna do nothing... just prance around, think my own thoughts and... - Oh, he's walking this way. Not a great sign. - Oh, uh... He's got no beard. He looks motivated. Uh, no. Plimpton, don't be alarmed. People only say that when they're about to be alarming. - Look, I know it's been a while. - Sorry about this. - And sorry about that. - All right. I'm unavailable. Unavailable for the man who changed your life? We're going to save the queen, bro! I am not your bro. You should be an Eskimo's rug by now. - Ow. Claws. - Ow! Beak! - Claws. - Beak! Now, now, gentlemen. Oh, you've gained weight. Why are you riding me? There's, like, four horses in front of us. Cheer up, angry bird. Kick back and enjoy the ride. I am the ride. Buckingham Palace. We've hit the big time! Full speed no longer required! Whoa. Welcome home, milady. Guards! Guards! Your ladyship, Rose. They are the queen's own guests. Treat them accordingly. You better give us a wide berth. Make way, boys. Plimpton, don't. Stop. - Don't stop? Odd decision, but... - Stop! Whoa! Aah! Can't see! Oh, my God. Oh, uh... Okay. I blame the hat. Dr. Mdfly. Lord Badgley. My lord. I come from the House of Lords. There is great concern for Her Majesty's health. I shall continue to leech to circulate the vapors in the bloodstream. She'll be lucky to last the week. This is not the first time Dr. Dolittle's been here. You got a dying queen? Not for long. Dr. Dolittle is in the... Oh, uh, wait. Wait for me! A stowaway, my lady, who claims to be Dr.... Dr. Dolittle's apprentice. It's quite all right, Gareth. Well, if he was my apprentice, he should fetch my bags and keep his gob shut. - A bird. - A duck. Animals in the queen's chamber? I demand their immediate remov... Ah, Lady Rose. My apologies. Please forgive me. I didn't realize that you were part of... John Dolittle? - Is that Blaine? - Blair. Poopfling? - No. - It was Mudflap? - No, it's Mdfly. - It was... Mdfly. - With an umlaut. - Yes. - From the German. - Of course. - From the Germans. - Why is he here? Her Majesty has personally requested Dr. Dolittle. Well, then, let's get to work. All right, Jip, give her a good sniff. - That dog is licking the queen. - Don't worry, my love. This is outrageous. Oh, bark. - You all right, fellow? - Something smelled wrong. And that's coming from a guy who loves the smell of butts. Oh, you do love butt. I detected a whiff of something else. Floral, with earthy... I'm perplexed, Doc. I've never smelt anything like it before. Uh, clearly, Jipsy and I are out of our depths. - May we consult? - Well, of course. I'd be more than happy to help illuminate... John and I were students at Edinburgh years ago. Some thought he had a gift for observation. One minute. Oh, sorry about that, Mini. Stay here. Dab-Dab, clear out the humans. Boyo, fetch the ""Botanical Index"" and the tea tin. Everyone out. Do you understand the words coming out of my bill? What do you smell, Jip? Elderberries? Hemlock? Negative. Negative. Aye, aye. What have you found, Dolittle? Well, quite possibly, the answer to everything. Exposure to toxic... God, he was like this at school. ""Lean in, lean in. I'm saying something interesting."" I am interested. The queen's symptoms are due to the effect of a rare Sumatran plant known as the nightshade flower. A solar eclipse will occur on the 17th of this very month. If she has not received the antidote by then, she will perish. Is that a Turner? Must be. What a fine painting. I say, Dolittle, what is your plan? The plan? Uh, I suppose we do need one. Well, the queen's only hope is a cure that's never been tested, from a tree that's never been seen, on an island that's never been found. Sounds ridiculous saying it out loud. But regardless of that... ...we have no choice but to embark on this perilous journey to obtain the fruit of the Eden Tree. What? Eden Tree. Oh, my. Fantastic. The Dolittles with their Eden Tree Island. - Isn't it enough that your wife... - Shut up, Blair! Sorry, I-I meant to say: ""Lovely to see you again, Blair."" We're off now. Ta-ra. Oh, its fruit is said to cure every malady known to man, grant eternal life, even restore the hair on your head. You must let nothing pass her lips that hasn't been made and served by you. Clear? Yes, I'll see to it. That's us to the carriage. Jip, you need to stay behind and guard the queen. - Very important. - Right, guard dog mode. Stand back, everyone, while I secure the perimeter. Excuse me. I do so admire how you don't give up. The queen is counting on both of you. Good luck. Right. Chop-chop. We got a long voyage in front of us, and the boat isn't gonna sail itself. Deep breath, Yoshi. We haven't got all day. Seems like she's full up. Maybe we could squeeze in one more. Plenty of room. - Oh, no. - Uh, Plimpton. I mean, one more stop, good fellow. I can't hear you, because I am not here. Well, I believe it's time to go our separate ways. Uh, I'm going with you. Certainly not. It's far too treacherous. I'm your apprentice. You? No, no, no. Oh, you have an apprentice? You don't need an apprentice and an ostrich. I'll go home. I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I pretended you belonged. I was helpful in there, wasn't I? - Hmm... - The animals like me. I don't take up much space. I think I belong here. Don't make me go home. Please. What is that around your neck? Come on. I'm worried about the boy, Bethan. Give him time. Time is all. We're hunters, Bethan. Hunters. It has a certain... We hunt things. He frees things. Like rabbits and mice. He carries spiders outside. Nobody likes spiders... not even spiders. I don't know how your sister put up with him. Ugh. Ugh. Poly? What are you doing here? Making sure you don't miss the boat. A-Am I talking to an animal, just like Dolittle? Oh, no. I'm speaking human. Better than any parrot ever has, actually. Now, let's pack some clothes. Come on. But Dolittle said I belong here. Little help, Tutu? Well, I never heard him say anything of the sort. There's something special about you, Stubbins. Something I've only seen in two other humans. You belong with us, kid. And you let me worry about Dolittle. That's my job. So, are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime? I'm in. Of course you are. Poly, let's move. We got a boat to catch, and we're burning daylight. Fret not, ma chrie. We have the perfect plan. New plan! New plan! Come on! Don't let them get away! Why are they chasing us? We're not criminals. Speak for yourself. We're wanted in three forests. And it's not an escape mission unless you're being chased. Whoa! That tickles! Which way, Tutu? - Down! - Whoa! Clear the way! Hey! This way! Get off the road, ma chrie. See you later, suckers. Whew. We've done it. We've done it. We... Missed it. Okay, boss, what's our next move? We cut our losses, change our identities, ditch the kid in the river. Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy. Wh-Wh-What about that bridge? Yes, the bridge. Uh, that was my next suggestion. Let's go! Come on, Doc. At least get out of the hammock. Your seasickness will wear off. Try some of this ginger root. You'll get your sea legs back. You look terrible. Ah, button it. Who put me in this hammock? I am the captain of this ship, right? Raise the blasted sails, will you? Uh, that's a big bite. Everyone, look. Is that the boy? He's coming to finish the job! He won't rest till I'm dead! He's obsessed! - John, slow the boat down. - No. - I want to go faster. I want... - Sorry, kid. Doc says no. We're going to miss all the good current! - I hope you make it. - Me, too, Dabs. - All right, Bets, moment of truth. - Okay. Oh, big hole, 12 o'clock! Maybe this is a bad idea. - Let's go, Stubbins, let's go! - Come on, kid. Get on the boat! Get on the boat! I've run out of track! But not courage! - Fly and be free! - Whoa! Vive la rsistance! - Whoa! - Is that thing up to code? Whoa. Whoa. No! No. Jump, murderer. You got this. Oh, I can't look. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Do it again! Do it again! - Do it again! Do it again! - Yes! - Crushed it, kid. - Do it again! Do it again! You made it. Why y'all cheering for the kid who shot me? Ah, he's all right. Darling. - Can I have a word, please? Huh. - Glad you came around and saw things my... What was she thinking? The boy nearly killed himself. Oi! This is my ship, right? And I'm its sovereign. And there are consequences... To ignoring me. - Is that what you were going to say? - No, no. Don't mince my words. And stop messing with my routine. But look at the state of you. You're sick as a dog. Uh, but actually, I have my medicine. See? This licorice root is working a treat. Sit down, John. Don't embarrass me in front of the crew. I'm sparing you embarrassment. You need a trim. All right, all right, be quick. It's important to maintain my status, yeah? This ship is dangerous... no place for a... Ow. - Ow! - What? - Huh? Hurts, man! Private conversation. - Oh, okay. - Okay. - Sorry. I know this particular voyage is hard for you, John. It is for me, too. I brought you Lily just when you needed her, and now you need one of your own kind again. Someone without feathers or fur. Fine, the boy can stay, but it'll be on my terms. And I'll keep him quite busy. You'll do it with a smile on your face. Crew! Seems you got a new shipmate. As I just told Poly, we are a bit shorthanded after all, so... You won't regret it. Welcome aboard. I hear you could be a big help... ...by cleaning this up. That, too, if you wouldn't mind. Oops. Those as well. And that. I got these. Careful with that medical equipment. Because a parrot's in charge of my ship! Brilliant! He's absolutely thrilled to have you. Hmm. Hello there, little squid. You don't understand me, do you? That would be preposterous. - Mdfly. - I wasn't talking to the squid! I'm dispatching a frigate, the Britannia, to follow Dolittle. But you must not support him in his foolishness, my lord. England has enemies everywhere waiting for the slightest sign of weakness. Entrusting beloved Britain to a child queen? That is lunacy. So, while I remain here ensuring no one prevents me from taking the throne, you will be on the Britannia making certain Dolittle never returns. Great. Round two, yeah? You got me on the ropes, you have, Cheech. Come on. One, two. Jab, jab, cross. The best form of defense is attack. I really don't want to fight you. We're not fighting, are we? It's a therapeutic session. I-I think I'm getting this. I'm actually starting to understand. Stop worrying, John. Every step is planned out in my journal. I'll be back before you even miss me. Are you all right? I think I'm beginning to understand a little bit of what the animals are saying. Seems you are, boyo. What kind of polar bear works on their tan? Well, what kind of bird... Wait, are you even a bird? - Of course I am. - Well, can you fly? - No. - Can you swim? No. Well, what can you do? - I can run. - I can run. What bird stuff can you do? Well, what bear stuff can you do? You win this round. Ro... Pickles? Oh, you were saying ""warship."" Weird time to be asking for pickles. I mean, who could eat when we're under attack? Enemy, starboard aft. Elliott, you and Elsie ready the machine. We're gonna need speed. Send out the call. Which way are the lifeboats? This whole thing is a death boat. Mini, mind the lookout. Stubbins, boy, I need you now more than ever... - to stand still. - I surrender! We surrender! Oh... hello, Blair, you chinless wonder. He said something about my chin, didn't he? It's a magnificent chin, sir. We're in their sights. Cannons are taking aim. Let's turn this ship! I'm on my way. It is time for me to slip into something less comfortable. Hello...! I bought a front-row seat to crazy town. Once Humphrey's been secured, you pull me out on Yoshi's signal. Me? No, I-I can't handle that type of pressure, Doc. I'm a ""cheer quietly from the sidelines"" kind of gorilla. Don't worry, Cheech. You'll rise to the occasion, huh? You're stronger than you know. Now, remember, courage is not the absence of fear. Wait. You got cut off. I-I can't hear you. I need the second part! No time, Cheech. Let's go. Oh, look, look. They're already abandoning ship. Boom! Oh, this is gonna be cold. But I'm coming in hot! Humphrey here. Let's hook it up. Where we headed? South. Okay, I can do this. I can do this. Full steam ahead! Go, Humphrey, go! Are they pulling away? Do it, whale, do it! Whoo-hoo! - It's working! - How is this possible? - Well, sir, it appears Dolittle and a polar bear have harnessed a whale... It was a rhetorical question. Just fire! I dropped the rope! I failed. I knew I couldn't do it. - Yoshi! - Hang on. I'm coming, kid! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! - You're doing great. Oh, this is gonna murder my back. Quit complaining, you oversized flamingo. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. - Oh, no. - Oh, no. - Oh! - Yes! I let you down, Doc. Look at me. I'm fine. We're all fine. - I froze. - No, no, no, Cheech. It's okay to be scared. Mm-mm. You saved me, did you? Fair play. Thanks very much. Well done, everybody. Feel like you belong now, kid? I guess I do. - We lost 'em. - I guess I do. Great work, gang. Eat our dust, Mudfly. - They've gotten away, sir. - Oh, really? I thought they disappeared into thin air. I'm afraid not, sir. They've escaped. Read the room, Lieutenant! I can see they've escaped. But not for long. It's a miracle. That must mean I am the chosen one. I'm gonna change the wor... Whale power. Dolittle had to write a paper about it, which, of course, nobody took seriously. This one even theorizes the existence of dragons. Just preposterous. Sir, I'm afraid your obsession with Dolittle is... What obsession? I'm not obsessed with Dolittle. You're obsessed with Dolittle. You're the one obsessing about my obsession with Dol... I'm loath to admit it, but he's more valuable alive for now. But luckily, I think I know where he's going. Kevin's log, day seven. I'm now totally isolated. The enemy has ingratiated himself with the captain and crew. No sign of promised tropical island or the magic fruit. But I will endure. Take the wheel, Stubbins. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. I have to calculate our route coordinates. The bees are buzzing about you. Seems you are getting a rudimentary grasp of their language. 35 degrees portside. Well, I-I have noticed when they fly in a zigzag pattern, they sort of go... Which means: ""Back off, kid."" But when Dab-Dab goes, uh... That means: ""Look at this."" Mm. ""Look at me."" - Oh, close. - Not bad, though. Oh, uh... No, when Chee-Chee says... When Chee-Chee says... That means: ""Where's my... blanket?"" Very good. Is that the map of Eden Tree Island? The Eden Tree cannot be found on any map. And to call it an island is to suggest that it is of our world, and it is anything but. That is why we must first go to Monteverde, birthplace of the only person to ever chart a course to the tree. Her name was Lily. She wrote the route in a journal, but on her voyage, she was shipwrecked. The world lost the greatest explorer I've ever known. The journal from that expedition was all that survived. Elliot, Elsie, do you mind? So, anyway, you get the picture. To have any chance of finding the tree, we have to go to Monteverde and steal that flippin' journal. Steal the journal? Did I say that? Well, what's the worst that can happen? Don't worry. I know an omen when I see one, and that was not an omen. Stealing the journal is not a big deal. In fact, Monteverde itself is not a big deal. The stop at Monteverde was a very big deal. After all, this island of bandits and thieves was once a place Dolittle, Lily and I called home. Until the doctor made an enemy of the island's notorious ruler, King Rassouli. And just our luck... his most prized possession was the very journal we needed to steal. So Dolittle needed a disguise. While I was left watching over the rest of the crew, Dolittle and Stubbins snuck into the palace. I'm about to die! Once inside, their path ended at a heavily bolted door, naturally. But Dolittle still had questionable contacts on the island. Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut... The opening bid will suffice. You have my attention. Don Carpenterino, I'm here on behalf of these humans. They will pay you handsomely for your family's lock-picking skills. You come to me for this, on the day of my daughter's wedding? Wait a minute. Which daughter? It's not... Sh-Sheila? My Sheila? She's getting married? - To a scorpion named Dylan. - Sorry, Boy Scout. I guess Sheila's into bad boys now. We were gonna spend the rest of our life spans together. Move on, James. What's your human's best offer? Two more now... and two later. Huh? Okay. You have yourself a deal. See you around, Boy Scout. Guys, I'm no Boy Scout. Also, what's a scorpion got that I don't got? - Besides a massive stinger. - Get over her, James. You dated for two weeks. These bars are new. Totally messing up my plan. I can fit through them. No, no, no. It's too dangerous, man. Can't go in there on your own. Let me take him in, Doc. I need something to distract me from this Sheila reveal. Are you sure your head's in the right place, James? Oh, yeah. I'll get the kid in and then fly headfirst into a brick. Just kidding. I'm fine. Aye. All right. James will look after you. It's fine. Listen closely. Get the journal and get out of there. Go through the room quietly. Look for the tiger's eye. Go down the hidden staircase. And most importantly, keep your disguise on. There's just one little thing you should know. Rassouli loves his cats. But that's no problem for us, 'cause we can just fly right over... Wait. Uh, I see the mistake I made here. You can't fly. Hey. Oh. Watch out. Kitty cat on your six. Oh, God. Oh, oh! Whoa, whoa! Hey! Slick move, kid. We make a pretty good team. A real couple of bad boys. Okay, partner, you know where to go. I'll keep watch on these lions. That's what a bad boy dragonfly does. Would Dylan get this close to a lion? Would he get this close? How about this close? Oh, sh... This is bad. This is... very bad. ""Lily... Dolittle."" We got the journal! Open up! Just kidding. He blew it. - Bye! - Oh, dear. Stubbins. Former resident here. - Don't move. - Huh? Don't touch. All I wanted was my daughter to marry wisely, and instead, I got the ringleader of a circus. I never understood what Lily saw in you. A common complaint the world over for fathers of beloved daughters, but in this instance, I think we can all agree it is particularly accurate. Come here. Come here. Come here. Um, so, you didn't mean any of that. It was her journal. The only thing of hers my men found in the wreckage. It belongs here. All you had to do was never show your face again and even at that... you failed. Now you'll pay for taking Lily away from me. You knew what would happen if you returned. Yes. Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! Barry! You should go. Come on, Barry! It's my past that's caught up with me, not yours. - Yeah? - But you're my friend. Go. Don't look back. You're better off without him, kid. Um... I'm in compliance. Yes! Finally, some action down here. Boy, was it getting boring. You know, Doc, I hate to tell you, but you're going down, my friend. You'd do well to keep your buckteeth together. What is that smell? Hey, fellas, I think Dr. Dolittle did a little doo-doo. Did Dr. Dolittle do a little doo-doo? Perhaps when I'm out of here, I'll teach you some manners and accept your lucky foot as payment. Oh, this lucky foot? Don't worry about it, Doc, 'cause both of my lucky feet are gonna be tap-dancing on your grave when my guy's done with you. Taking bets over here. In the right corner, wearing golden stripes, with a sparkling record of 872 kills, Barry ""The Butcher"" Bernstein! Dr. Dolittle, remember me, your old patient? It's Barry. Barry. How could I forget you? Oh, but you did, Doc. We were just starting to make progress, and then you run off with Rassouli's daughter and abandon me. Well, uh, I'm back now. Uh, perhaps we should just pick up where we left off... Enjoy the feast. What will happen to Dolittle? Oh. Well, he's a dead man. Yeah. He'll think he can talk his way out of it, but, uh, Barry has gone completely nuts. But you... you are one of us now. To Dolittle's death! - Psst. - Hey, it's you. You made it. I need you to get a message to my friends on our boat. A message? Sure. When have I ever let you down? All I hear day after day is: ""Oh, Barry, you're such a disappointment. ""Why can't you be more like your brother? He eats poachers for a living, you know."" ""Yes, Mother, I know! The whole jungle knows."" Oh, my head. Your migraines are brought on by severe maternal issues and compounded by sibling rivalry. Please make it stop. Oh, no, no, no, no. - Lie down. - Oh, my head. We could resume your treatment. Oh, the stress is unbearable. I... I just want to be a good boy. I just want to make Mummy proud. There we are. No one I eat will ever be good enough. There's the release. Release it. I will never be good enough. Unless I eat you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Because every mother wants their son to grow up and eat a doctor. You're a sick kitty. Come here, Doc. I'll make it quick. I've got another one of these in an hour. Give up, Dolittle. You can't outsmart... Oh, what was that? Oh, wait. Now it's over there, huh? And now it's over here. Now it's back over there. Got it. And now it's over here. Oh, I lost it. I've got to get it. A cat is still a cat. - I got it. - Easily distracted. New game, Doc. Get back down here. Come on down, Doc. Okay, James, you can't let this kid down. You got to deliver this message. Oh, no. It's James. From now on, no more focusing on relationships and... Whoa. Poly? - Is that you? - James? - Ooh, your feathers really filled out nice. - James, James! - What happened, James? - Oh, right. Message. My bad. The kid's been captured by Rassouli, and Barry's about to have Dolittle for lunch. Looks like we're going ashore after all. Be a darling and grab my dynamite, will you? We need to split up if we're going to pull this off. Chee-Chee, you're coming with me. Where are we going? No, no, no, don't tell me. Just tell me when we get there. Yoshi, create a distraction. Hope this is enough. We are being attacked! Come on down, Doc. Therapy's the answer. Oh, no. Worse than I expected. - I got you, Doc. - Back off, Barry! Poly, don't! An appetizer. I got you, Poly. Any final diagnosis, Doc? Don't you want to be the best Barry you could be? Oh, I'm about to. I am not a prisoner of fear! I'm not a prisoner of fear? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay to be scared. - Ow, ow. - Oh, oh! It's okay to be scared. - You should be scared. - It's okay to be scared! - Give him a good hiding. - Okay, we're doing this. We are doing this. We're not doing this. Hit him in the low area. Down there. Ah. Ooh, that's got to hurt. Ow! My Barry berries. That will work. Cheap shot, ape. Wait. I... I haven't finished my treatment.  Go to sleep, baby tiger  Time to put those claws away.  Anyway... You need this more than I do. Tell me I'm enough, Mummy. I had 50 grand riding on that. Well, I won't pay that. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. Thanks for sticking with me, Doc. I have it. - I have the j... - Stop! - Halt! And now I'll have it. Hmm. She had such a sure hand. Exactly what the doctor ordered. What did they offer you, Mudfly, to murder the queen of England? Quite a few things, actually. Knighthood. Windward House. Chair of the Royal College. In no particular order. Oh, and the icing on the madeleine will be the scientific accolades that accrue from the proper study of the Eden Tree. All thanks to Lily Dolittle. Actually, no, that's still madeleine. The icing is knowing that you know I won. Oh, and, Dolittle, I'm so sorry for that hole in your boat. What hole? Abandon ship! Everyone, overboard! Oh, not good. Don't look back. Help! I'm on it, Doc. I can't fly. And I can't swim. Got you, buddy. Plimpton, I'm not losing you, bro. Step away from the light. There is no light. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive, thanks to you, Yoshi. You've always been so kind. It's difficult to say goodbye. Please don't say that. It's all right. You've done your best. Your queen is proud. Where are you, Dolittle? Hey, big bird, you doing okay? No. Nothing about me is okay. My father was right about me. I should have been an omelet. I know how you feel. My dad said he was going out for a pack of seals one night and never came back. I guess we got something in common after all, Plimpton. What is this feeling? I'm all warm and fuzzy inside. That's friendship, bro. Huh. Not bad... bro. I'm not crying. You're crying. Right. Gather round, shall we? Huh? Let's have a look where we are now. That's the spirit, John. Oh, this is gonna be good. I'm already getting duck bumps. - We are finished. - What? Is this a pep talk? 'Cause it's a weird one. I can sniff defeat like a truffle pig. This can't be the end. - Yeah. - We... - I smell it. - We can still save the queen. - Nope. - We can still save your house. I believe in you. We can keep going. Oh, you got a point there. Except the journal's gone, we have no way to find the Eden Tree, and our boat is sunk. He makes a strong argument. On the plus side, you are all cured. Chee-Chee, you are brave now. Plimpton and Yoshi are getting along. Ow! Remember, back! Back! Sort of. And, Stubbins, you've made friends, and you can even talk to 'em. You don't need me. I'll stay here and offer medical services to this island of random bandits and outlaws. The doctor's here! Seeking new patients. - Cash only. - Ladies, gentlemen, who'd like to dance? I got a bad case of dancing fever. So, watch out, it's infectious. Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cha! - Come on, Doc. - Can't help him. That explorer you told me about... she would have never given up. She was your wife, wasn't she? You want to know the ironic bit? I don't know what ""ironic"" means. Irony is when you find a woman and she makes your life more wonderful than it had any right to be, and then, poof, she's gone, and it's all your fault. This journey was my chance to finish what she started. Lily insisted I care for the animals at home, so I stayed behind. Rassouli's right. I should have been with her. Now all I have left of her is the ghost I see when I hold our rings. So, you see her, too? Not only did you lose my daughter's journal... ...but your polar bear blew up my village. No. We don't know that. And your gorilla beat up my tiger. No good. - Let's go. - No, no. Stay. No, no, no, no, no. Mm. Yeah. Irony... is me wanting to kill you with every fiber of my being... ...but loving my daughter more. I miss her, too. She would have wanted you to... to keep going. So! Get going... before I stop feeling sentimental. She's saying we don't have a ship. Well, uh... I have the perfect vessel for you. Bit of a fixer-upper. It's got good bones. At least it floats. We'll just have to make the best of it, won't we? Ooh! Company. Uh, who's that? Hi. I'm Jeff. Crikey. If Lily's research was correct, then Mudfly was well on his way to Eden Tree Island. All we needed to do was track Mudfly. But how do we do that? Whales, boyo. Whales. I can't believe you're flipping him off. I know. That man has no chin. Ah. We found him. Follow us. Eden Tree Island. - Yeah! - Oh, wow. - Wow. - Extraordinary. This must be it. The map points us directly into the center of this mountain. Don't look down. Let's keep our beaks up, shall we? Trying to stay positive. What the heck are we doing up here? Going in the back way, my feathered buddy. What are you complaining about? This is the widest branch I've ever scurried on. Don't look down. Look at me. Whoa. A big cave. Stay close. Keep quiet. Kevin's log, day 12. Some force beyond my comprehension still compels me to follow this crew of lunatics, the squirrel killer and their deranged leader. Perhaps it's the magic tree that draws me. - Rifle troop! Fall in! - Hide. They're close. Turn it down now. Stay down. Fox fire fungus. We must be near it now. Look, Doc. It's lighting a path all the way... to the man who wants us dead. Stay right there. Oh. Go on, then, soldier boy. Spoil yourself. Hello, Blair. Get over there! Looking for a tree, is it? Trees don't often grow in caves. Didn't you pay attention in botany class? No, but pay attention to this, Dolittle. I beat you. You filthy animal... Move it. Come on, beasts. ...hoarder! So... where is it? Where's what? The Eden Tree. Truth is, I haven't got a clue. Don't be ridiculous. You're John Dolittle. You get everything you want. Not today, I don't. You really don't have any idea, do you? How does ignorance feel? Oh. Well, very freeing, actually. One must hug uncertainty, don't you think? That's how Lily lived her life. Embrace the unknown, and... the answers will be revealed. You sad, misguided nut, Dolittle. Give that to me. Give me that. I will find this damn tree on my own, and by God, history will remember me. Yeah. Something interesting going on now. My God, that feels a lot larger than all of us. Let's go! - What is that? - Something's moving! Look out! Retreat! Down over here! The lot of you! Come on! Yoshi, stay down. He saved me. I have a second chance to live a life of-of kindness and-and-and generosity and... Take him, not me! I'm a good person now. Tell you what we're gonna do... we're gonna make a run for that ditch while she's distracted... - Yoshi! - Get this off of me! Cheech. Help me! Plimpton! I'll save you, bro. Right. Think fast. Uh... Get this off of me! This will likely upset her a bit. No! Doc! - No! - No! - John! Dolittle! Dolittle! Help! Is he speaking dragon? You may be able to speak my language, but that does not make you worthy of the fruit. I know protecting the tree's your duty, but you won't be able to continue much longer... considering the damage you've taken and the pain you're in. Oh, you know nothing of my pain. But I do. I've felt it as well. The kind that doesn't come from a bullet or a blade, but cuts much deeper. And now in every moment and every movement, you feel that pain again. Yeah? It's hard to carry on... ...when you've lost the one you love. Just leave! Uh, what just happened? Oh, broken hearts. What the heck are you doing here? Don't worry, guys. I got this. We're both dragons. Hey, just wondering, you know, dragon to dragon, if you wouldn't mind telling me where... Ow, ow, ow! She's really mad. I'll wait for whoever survives outside. John, let's just get out of here while we still can. No. I think we're here to help her. Yeah. - We haven't got much time. - Hmm? I-I imagine it's a bit tender here. Oh... I'm unarmed. I pose no threat to you. The emotional stress over the years has done damage to your stomach. Get away from me. You have a severe impaction of the colon, and if I don't manually fragment it, it'll go septic. You won't be able to protect anything anymore. Ooh, that sounds like some tummy ache. Tell you what, give us five minutes. If you don't feel better, you can fry us all. Stop talking. Just get on with it. We have to get you on your side. We need to perform an emergency extraction. Extraction? Uh, what are we pulling out? - Go get 'em, gang. - Got your back, Doc. It's showtime. Three, two, one. Turn. Chee-Chee, chuck me the forceps. Knew it would come in handy. Told you! Everybody knows what to do. Just breathe. Works for me. It's okay. Just hold on to my wing, sweetie. Dab-Dab's here. Oi. You are my apprentice. You keep her calm. Did you know the leek is the national emblem of Wales? And very useful it is, too. You might feel a bit of pressure. I got her. Oh, good heavens! Oh, no, you didn't. Oh, my gosh! Just clearing the way. Is that armor? You got the whole Spanish army in here. Give us a deep breath. Hold it. Word of warning. What's up, Doc? When removing the blockage... Yoshi, now. ...there may be an initial release of wind. Ach-ah-vee! Respect. It's all right. Nobody heard that. Nothing to be ashamed of. We all do it. We're all animals. I can taste it! - Okay, I'm back. - Right. What did I miss? Oh, my gosh! This is the big one. We're in the homestretch now. Cheech, get behind me. I'm with you, Doc. On your call. Heave! Oh, it's breaching. Blood rushing to my head. Everything turning red. One last push, madam, if you please. Thank you. We did it. Teamwork makes the dream work. That was a lot, but we did good. To put it simply, more leafy greens and less armor in your diet. I've seen armies of every kind, but nothing like you. What unites such a group of creatures? Well, we may not look it, right, but somehow... - Who's a good boy? Good boy. - ...we just belong together. Now let me help you. Lily would have loved it, John. We would never have found it without her. Wow. I just got the chills, and I'm not even cold. Thank you for showing me the way, my love. We know, O Lord, that there is no word impossible to thee; and that, if thou wilst, thou canst yet raise her up and restore her to a longer continuance amongst us. O Father of mercies and Lord of all comfort... I'm sorry we couldn't save you, Your Majesty. ...her disillusion draweth near. It is with great sadness... Wait a minute. I smell something. It smells like... Hope. ...that I have to announce... ...that the queen is no more. Somebody call a doctor? My mates! A very dramatic entrance, boys. Well played. - We've arrived. - Dolittle! Clear a path. There isn't a moment to waste. I have procured that which is said to not exist. Behold, the fruit of the Eden Tree. I said clear a path. Seize them! Sorry but... sorry. I got him! - Go. - Seize them! You were born for this moment. I born. Mini, take flight. Get him! Freeze! Go, go, go! No. No, no, no, no! Kevin's log, day unknown. The killing has ended. Let there be life. Lady Rose. Is there a giraffe in my bedchamber? Yes. Oh, yes. And a polar bear and a gorilla and a parrot and a duck, an ostrich. Our humble thanks be to God. And well done, Dr. Dolittle. Not quite done, are we? Interesting. Carry on, Styx. I'm all ears. What's that? Uh, Styx here agreed to stay behind, keep his 12 eyes on things. He's just catching me up. Like all leaf insects, he speaks in eight-syllable phrases, and he states... ""Lord Badgley did poison the queen."" What? He did? Really, Dolittle, this is too much. You're certain? Well, this would be the time. No. I'm sorry. Styx is quite adamant. ""In his right pocket, the vial."" Ugh, that's only seven. Oh, ""in his right pocket, the vial of deathly nightshade."" Let's have a look, shall we? You can't possibly believe that he's talking to an insect. Well, I've... I've spoken to ladybugs. Making a wish before they fly away. Let's have a look. Ooh. No one messes with my family. Take one more step, and I'll rip you a brand-new a... Come on. Get... Hah. To the Tower with him. Oh, someone's been a bad boy. Come on. And I don't know why you're all standing there. Nobody's died. Leave me in peace. You, too. Your Majesty. Not you, Dr. Dolittle. A moment, if you would, please. Lady Rose, who is this person, and why is he staring at me? He's Stubbins. I-I want to be an animal doctor. He saved your life. Thank you. It's good to have you back, Doctor. Poly. Anything you'd like to say to me? Aye, you were right. I suppose it is nice to get out of the house every once in a while. Stubbins, Mini. Enough. We have far less important places to be. Our story ends the way it began. I have a letter for Dr. Dolittle! Somebody get me down! Mostly. There once was a peculiar doctor... ...who found he was at his best when sharing his extraordinary ability... - ...with others. - Excellent. Soon, Dr. Dolittle reopened his gates, as Lily would have wanted. Three more in the queue, gang. Copy that. Dolittle discovered his place in the world once again. After all, it's only by helping others that we can truly help ourselves. Subtitles by explosiveskull www.OpenSubtitles.org Oh, and in case you're wondering... Psst. You bats. Show me the way out of here. Psst. Bing. You understand me. No, wait. Wait, wait, wait., It is time. It's beautiful, isn't it? I'm Ikaris. I'm Sersi. Thank you, Ajak. Shit. Excuse me. Excuse me. I know I'm late, Charlie. ""In this broad Earth of ours, ""Amid the measureless grossness and the slag, ""Enclosed and safe within its central heart, ""Nestles the seed Perfection."" The poet's hope and optimism in humanity... echoes our recent universal victory, the return of half our population... And, thank God, there she is. Our brilliant museum scientist, Ms. Sersi, the person who will be... and was always supposed to be giving you your presentation today. Thank you, Mr. Whitman. Sorry I'm late, everyone. Today, we'll be learning about the importance of apex predators in a balanced ecosystem. Poetry? I completely ran out of things to say, and these kids make me nervous. Well, I thought you were very charming, Professor. See you tonight. Ooh! ""See you tonight."" All right, settle down. So... who can tell me what an apex predator is? Animals that hunt their prey for food. Very good. Apex predators do hunt their prey for food, like all predators. But one thing that sets them apart... is that there are no other animals in their habitat strong enough to hunt them. Who can give me an example? Lions. -Wolves. -Correct. Earthquake. Get down. Get down! It's an earthquake, everyone. Get down! Under the tables! Let me help you. Don't worry, it'll pass soon. It's all right. Come here. You're all right. You're all right. I like this song. Me, too. Do you wanna dance? Wait, what the hell? Your hand! You've had too much to drink. I gotta go. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Dane Happy birthday to you -Hip, hip! -Hooray! Is this from the Middle Ages? It has your family crest. It must have cost a fortune. I'm a good eBay bidder. Thank you. Happy birthday. So, have you given any more thought to us moving in together? Yeah, I thought about it. I can't move in with you. Yeah. Thought you'd say that. I'm sorry. And I think I know why. Are you a wizard? What? Yeah, like Doctor Strange. No. I'm... I've noticed some unusual things happen when I'm around you. Like our water always turns to coffee whenever the waiter ignores us. That's your caffeine addiction talking. And Sprite says things... like you and your ex-boyfriend broke up a century ago. She said that? And he can fly. He's a pilot. Get a room, you two. Can we go now? It's past my bedtime. Are you really in love? What if I am? You better tell him the truth, then. I'm working on it. You guys wanna get pizza? No, thank you! He won't live forever, you know. Move in with him. I live with you. Dane. Shit! Is that a Deviant? Dane, run! -Sersi? -Let's go. -What is that thing? -A Deviant! You said you killed them all! You told him that? -You believed me? -I do now! What are you doing? Keep Dane safe! Sersi, wait! What? You're fine, dude. Sprite! No. Stairs. Run! Go! Go! -Go! -Come on! It knows where we are! How? I don't know! Sprite! Sprite! Ikaris! Evening, ladies. Watch out! Wizard. Sorry. Did it just heal itself? Ikaris. It's good to see you. It's good to see you, too, Sprite. I'm Dane. Hello, Dane. Well, I guess you must be the pilot. We're Eternals, from a planet called Olympia. We came here 7,000 years ago on the Domo... our starship, to protect humans from the Deviants. We thought we killed them all five centuries ago, but now they're back. Look, if you don't want to move in with me, you could just say. Dane, this is serious. I know. I'm just still getting over the fact you're not a wizard. I was hoping you could change me into a giraffe. I always wanted to be a giraffe when I was a kid. It's too bad I can't change sentient beings. You would have made a very cute giraffe. Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos? Or any war? Or all the other terrible things throughout history? We were instructed not to interfere in any human conflicts... unless Deviants were involved. Why? If we'd protected humanity from everything for 7,000 years... you'd never have had the chance to develop in the way you were meant to. But if the Deviants were eradicated a long time ago... why are you still here? We've been waiting... to be told we can go home. So... Ikaris. The boy who flew too close to the sun. Sprite made that story up when we lived in Athens. In the fifth century BC? How long were you two together? 5,000 years. I guess you can call that long-term. What happened? He left. I always thought he'd come back, but... he never did. So, I moved on. I'm glad you did. I'm sorry. I have to go. This morning, an unprecedented global earthquake... swept nation-states across the world... causing damage and panic. Many have speculated its connection with the Blip. The UN has called for an emergency meeting... That Deviant healed itself. They could never do that before. And it was coming after us instead of humans. What's going on? I came to check on you because of the earthquake. That Deviant is news to me. Something's happening to Earth. Can't be a coincidence. We need to find the others. I haven't seen some of them for centuries. I doubt much has changed. I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi. But we need to stick together. And once I know you're safe, I'll leave you alone. Let's go to Ajak first. She'll know what to do. You hear that, Sprite? Family reunion. It's about time. Hey, that one was mine! Never mind. Ajak. Arishem. We continue to keep Babylon safe from the Deviants. More people have come to seek refuge. It is now the largest city on Earth. The Eternals serving their missions across the galaxies... will learn from your success. Thank you. I respect your grand design, Arishem. But I have noticed something special about this planet. And I fear that maybe this time the cost may... Do not become attached to this planet. You must focus on the true purpose of your mission. I understand. I will not let you down. Phastos. Did you go to the party last night like I told you to? The party, yeah. -Yeah, it was... -He worked all night. Who was talking to you? Get a life. And where is Sersi? Late as usual. I'm sorry, but I have something very exciting to show you, okay? Wait till you see this. What is it? It's an engine. It moves steam from high pressure to low pressure. It'll help them till their fields at an incredibly fast rate. It's gonna freak them out. I mean, they only have had the wheel 1,000 years, so... You know, we could do that thing where you use your mind to control them... and then they could do it quicker. Ajak, you listening to this? Phastos, this steam... -Engine. It's a steam engine. -It's too soon. And there she is. What did I miss? Nothing. Just the screams of my deep disappointment. I am sure you have something simpler. Simple. Okay, let's see. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... the plow. 'Cause that's what it does. Plows dirt. I met another group of settlers who are building their homes in the northern fields. They'll need to plant their own crops. -Thanks, Sersi. -Listen... humanity may be coming along slower than some of us want. But there is no telling what wonders they will discover as they advance. I just saw that. There's so many other chairs, man. You know, I could use my powers... Come and have a drink with me. No. I can't let you go and fight Deviants on your own. -We need to guard the city. -Get out of my way. I didn't come to this planet to cower behind walls. We need to trust Arishem's design for this planet. Thena. It's an honor to fight alongside you. And you. My beautiful Makkari. You're late. Well, she also says that stealing is very, very bad. Deal. I promise I won't let my feelings for Sersi distract me from my mission. Humans are far from being able to protect themselves from the Deviants. We still have much to do. Your faith in Arishem is strong. I can feel it. But you are allowed to live a life, you know? Go tell Sersi how you feel. Try. Sorry. I'm making a mess. Well, not bad. It matches your eyes. You're learning their language now? If I want to spend more time with you... I need to get to know them. Wait, what did I say? You said, ""I am very beautiful."" You... You are very beautiful, Sersi. I'm yours, Sersi... if you'll have me. I love you, Ikaris. I love you, Sersi. Hello? Ajak? Ajak! It was a Deviant. Our love And our devotion Were as deep as any ocean It was the last time I saw her. Ajak asked me to check on Sersi, so I went to London. Turned out, both of us were lonely and we needed each other. I guess, in her way... Ajak never stopped trying to take care of us. Bye, Ajak. It's the first time in 7,000 years one of us has died. I think the Deviant that attacked us in London... killed Ajak and absorbed her power. Deviants have never done that in the past. It healed itself just like Ajak. I swear, I almost heard it speak. Arishem. Sersi. It is almost time. Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay? What happened, Sersi? The sphere that Ajak used to talk with Arishem... it came out of her body and went inside me. Did you talk with Arishem? Yes. He said... it's almost time. Can you try talking to him again? I don't know how. But she chose you to replace her. And she gave you the sphere. Hold on, Sprite. Are you sure you talked with Arishem? What else would it be? Mahd Wy'ry. Where are the others? There were more Deviants than you said. Well, I'm sure that was a lot of fun for you. It was. Once the others kill these last Deviants... we will have eliminated them all from the planet. Don't. We don't interfere in their wars. This isn't war. It's genocide. Their weapons have become too deadly. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea helping them advance, Phastos. Technology is a part of their evolutionary process, Druig. It's not exactly something that I can stop. No, you can't. But I can. It's too late. -Thena? -Everyone is going to die. Are you okay? Thena? -Thena? Thena, no! -Thena! Don't listen to your head, Thena. Listen to my voice. You are safe. You are loved. You're our Thena. Hey, Thena! Hey! Stop, stop, stop! -Is she okay? -Yeah. Sersi. Thena, please. Come back to us. Okay. I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth. There is no cure... so no one really talks about it. What happened? Thena. You attacked everyone. Wounded Sersi, Phastos... you nearly killed Makkari. I don't remember. You have Mahd Wy'ry. Your mind is fracturing under the weight of your memories. And all I can do is erase them so that you can start over. I will have to inform Arishem and take you back to the ship... where we have the technology to help you. What if it happens again? She could've killed you. She could have killed all of us. Please. Please, I want to remember. I want to remember my life. Thena, I love you. But listen to me. It's not important if you remember or not. Your spirit will remain. You will always be Thena deep inside. Trust me. Why should she trust you? You're asking her to let you erase who she is. Druig, I know you're upset, but... Upset? We've trusted you for 7,000 years, and look where you've gotten us. I've watched humans destroy each other when I could stop it all in a heartbeat. Do you know what that does to someone after centuries? Could our mission have been a mistake? Are we really helping these people build a better world, huh? We're just like the soldiers down there. Pawns to their leaders. Blinded by loyalty. It ends now. Let them go. You're gonna have to make me. Stop. If you wanna stop me... you're gonna have to kill me. I'll watch over Thena. Let her keep her memories. One day, when she attacks you... you might have to kill her. We'll take that chance. You may all go. The Deviants are gone. There is no reason for you to stay with me. Shouldn't you ask Arishem first? We're a team, we should stay together. I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris. Do not forget your place. This is where we say goodbye. You are free to go. I want you to go out there. And live a life for yourselves. Not as soldiers. Not with the purpose you were given. Find your own purpose. And one day, when we see each other again... I want you to tell me what you found. Come my way {\an8}Get the evil away You came to save And now you're here Now you have come home Give it all to me You would risk it all For my victory Waiting for you Scarcely can I I am Karun Patel. Kingo's valet. It's truly an honor to be in the presence of the great Eternals. The ring of fire Like the sun You have risen Mighty one Cut! Okay, everyone, that was good. But we could do 10% better. That was beautiful. Very, very good. Really, so good. My friends from college are here. Hello, boss! Perfect timing! Welcome to the set of... I'm playing you! -You like the costume? -We need to talk. Tell the director I have some notes for him... We need to talk to you in private. Oh, Karun, he's worked with me for 50 years. I trust him completely. Actually, when we first met, he thought I was a vampire... and he tried to stake me through the heart. I have apologized so many times. Not quite enough times. Very close, though. I'll let you know. I have to get ready for the next scene. Come to my tent, we'll talk there. You guys are gonna love the next scene. I come in on a wire 'cause, you know, I can't fly. Wait, are we getting back together? We need to talk. I've been waiting for the day... the world learns the true identity of the Shadow Warrior. Ajak's dead. She was killed. It was a Deviant. The Deviants are back. We don't know how many there are. You need to come with us. I can't just go. I mean, all these people depend on me. We just started shooting this movie. It's the first of a trilogy. We just got BTS to do a cameo... Sir... -may I say something? -Please don't say anything. I think you should go. I just said don't say anything. ""Life affords no greater duty than to protect one's family!"" Remember? It's your favorite line... from The Shadow Warrior 2: Voyage of Time. Your family needs you. Seven thousand years. That's how long the battle between Eternals and Deviants has raged for. You think I'm a movie star. Well, I am. But I am also... an Eternal. Kingo, what are you doing? I think we should be remembered, so... I am making a documentary about us. You are about to meet my fellow Eternal, Sprite. Sprite, tell them about yourself. Oh, wait. Okay, well, we'll circle back to her. This is Sersi. Sersi... tell them about yourself. We're rolling. Well... I can change a rock into water. I could turn a rock into wood. Or a rock into metal. Actually, one time, I turned a rock into air. Cut. You know what? Why don't you think about it, and we'll get back to you, okay? Let's go. Sprite says you're addicted to this thing. Oh, this? Look at this. You know, seeing as we don't age. I think you look quite good. Don't you? Nobody ever wonders how you managed to be the leading man for over 100 years? I don't know what you're talking about. That is my great-great-grandfather... that is my great-grandfather... grandfather... father, and me. I'm part of the greatest dynasty in the history of Bollywood. Pretty impressive, right? You abandoned me in Macedonia. Okay, I got sick of moving every five years. People freak out when they notice that you don't... age. I thought we were friends. Do you know why I love movies? Because of you. I missed sitting in the audience, listening to your stories... watching your illusions. We should've all stayed together. Ajak would still be alive. She should have never let us go. This is the Deviant you fought in London? It's different. There must be more out there than we thought. Is this a Deviant, sir? Yep. It's a beautiful creature. What? This? This? No. It's hideous. You've never had one try to bite your head off. Roll. You're about to meet two of the greatest warriors the world has ever known. Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable. And her trusty friend... Door. ...a mighty powerhouse of strength... the fearsome Gilgamesh! Gilgamesh! What took you so long? You look younger today, Sprite. I have the same apron. Who the hell are you? I'm Karun. Kingo's valet. Oh, valet. Like Alfred in Batman. Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back. No shit. I could have used some help. We were attacked by a Deviant in London, too. Even Ikaris couldn't kill it. You couldn't? I was distracted. Sure, man. Hey, you guys wanna try my pie? I'm sorry, Gil. Ajak's dead. It's true, buddy. We lost her. Sersi. The attack triggered her. She's no fun to be around right now. Hey, Thena. Look who's here. Give me your hand. Thena. Everyone in Centuri-6 is going to die. Give me your hand. It's too late. We can't save them. Thena. Thena. We came to Earth together on our ship. You're an Eternal. The greatest warrior of Olympia. The legendary protector of Athens. The goddess of war. Remember who you are. Remember. -Thena. -Hi. Hello. Hey, who's your gardener? This is just what you guys eat every day? -Yeah, this is amazing. -Every day. -Thank you for this. -Oh, you're welcome. Help yourself. This one is a trio of wine, beer, and mead. Made for all the soldiers in the battle of Troy. That's so thoughtful. Should she be drinking? No, hers is non-alcoholic. For kids. I gave you the same thing, Sprite. For kids. I was just kidding. Yours is a secret brew Odin taught me as a thank-you... after we helped defeat Laufey's army in Tonsberg. What? I'm a big baby. Very mature. Can you stop? -Stop. -Speaking of Odin... Thor used to follow me around when he was a little kid. Now he's a famous Avenger and won't return my calls. So, now that Captain Rogers and Iron Man are both gone... who do you think is gonna lead the Avengers? I could lead them. I figure I'd be good at that. Yeah, you would. Ajak didn't even choose you to lead us. Ouch, Gil. Ouch. -Harsh. -I'm gonna let that one slide... because, you know, you've always been bitter that I can fly and you can't. So what, you can fly. I'm better-looking, everybody knows that. Where you going? I'm just gonna get some air. This is really good, Gil. You know, I could sell this. Put my face on it, move some units. I made it from corn. I chew each kernel myself and ferment it in my spit. Is this the Centuri-6 Thena was talking about? Yeah, it's a planet. She thinks she used to live there until it was destroyed. Always talks about massive quakes ripping it apart. Everyone died, including herself. We had an unprecedented global earthquake three days ago. Oh, that's what that was. I thought I was drunk. Ajak chose me to lead us, but... I can't even figure out how to speak to Arishem. I've tried so many times. Maybe you're trying too hard. Sometimes, you just have to listen. Sersi. Arishem. Ajak was killed by a Deviant. We think it absorbed her power. And something unusual is happening to Earth. It is a side effect of the emergence. The emergence? It is time for you to learn the true purpose of your mission. You were sent to Earth to bring forth the Celestial Tiamut. Every billion years, new Celestials must be born. I plant Celestial seeds into host planets across the universe. The planet Earth was chosen to host the Celestial Tiamut. In order to grow... Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy from intelligent life. The Deviants prevented this by consuming humans... until the Eternals eliminated them. Now, the human population of this planet has reached the required amount. It is time for the emergence to begin. But... everyone on Earth will die. The end of one life, Sersi... is the beginning of another. Our universe is a constant exchange of energy. An infinite cycle of creation and destruction. Celestials use energy... gathered from host planets to create suns... generating gravity, heat, and light... for new galaxies to form. Without us... our universe will fall into darkness. All life will die. Ajak knew the truth? She has helped many Celestials to emerge over millions of years. So have you. Earth was my first mission. I was home, on Olympia. There is no Olympia. This is your true home, Sersi. The World Forge. It is here that I built and programmed the Eternals. Everything dies except us... because we were never alive. Why don't I remember any of this? Because your memories are erased and reset after each emergence. They are stored here. Why do you keep them? I keep them in order to study the Deviants. I created the Deviants, Sersi... for the same purpose I created you. Every Celestial host planet has its own predators. I first sent the Deviants to exterminate them... so intelligent life could grow. But there was a flaw in their design. They evolved. Became predators themselves. And I lost control of them. I built and programmed you, Eternals... to be synthetic beings and incapable of evolution... to correct my mistake. Sersi, Ajak has chosen you to take her place... as the Prime Eternal. Do not fail me. So, you're saying we're basically fancy robots? And our past memories are stored somewhere... in space? And Arishem made the Deviants. I'm sorry, Thena. You tried to warn us. The last time Arishem reset your memories, something must have gone wrong. What do you mean? Well, that's what Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it? All this time, Thena was remembering all the other planets we were sent to... and everyone dying during the emergence. I thought we were heroes. Turns out we're the bad guys. We're not the bad guys, okay? We've helped the Celestials expand life across the universe. That's not what bad guys do. That's what good guys do. Every time innocent lives have been sacrificed for the greater good... it turns out to be a mistake. We have to stop the emergence. Sersi, we have no right to stop the birth of a Celestial. There has to be a way Tiamut can emerge without destroying the Earth. We just have to delay it until we figure out how. Could Druig control its mind? Maybe put it to sleep? ""Put it to sleep""? Are you serious? Gilgamesh asked Druig to put me to sleep once. So I could take a vacation to Fiji, you know? -We're talking about a Celestial, okay? -We have to try. Come on, we're not gonna let everyone on Earth die, right? Right. I'm human. I'm a little biased. And do what? Watch TV? When I could be with the Earth's original superheroes... as they try to save the world? Fine. If you want to, stay. Thank you very much, sir. Gilgamesh... could you please get rid of the saliva beer? I thought you liked it, man. We need to go. Now. Find the others. Once we're all together... we'll decide what to do about the emergence. It's very nice here, sir. Don't be fooled. Ignorance is bliss. Hello, Sprite. I missed all of you. Please, make yourselves at home. You've given me a lot of bad news in one go, my lady. Will you help us? I am glad that... Hey, what's your service? I'm not getting any bars. Do you all remember this forest? Beautiful. It was the last place we all lived together. I've protected these people for 20 generations now... from the outside world and from themselves. Your kind, my friend, you will be responsible for your own extinction one day. Don't you think? I think we must learn from our mistakes and do better, sir. You must not give up hope. Oh, no, you didn't. Okay, new rule, no more possessing people's valets. Where is your sense of humor, Kingo? I'm sorry, sir. Don't apologize, it's not your fault. You are not a god. You know that, right? How ironic. Kingo, the movie star. I've directed some things, too. Oh, yeah? Like what? Some Internet content. How many views? I don't do it for the views. Let's go. He's wasting our time. -We need him. -Ikaris. I missed you. Are you gonna charm me or threaten me? I mean, there's a third option, if you prefer that. It must be heartbreaking to find out that you're not Mother's favorite. And I'm sure she'd be real proud of what you've been up to. Druig, this is serious. I'll tell you what's serious. I've just been told I've been sent on a suicide mission for the past 7,000 years... and that my entire existence is a lie. So, excuse me for not giving a shit about your plan right now. Druig sucks. He does, sir. I don't like this place. Druig needs to think, and Sersi wants us to wait, so... we wait. I couldn't recognize myself in Sprite's illusions. Those were the good old days. What if I can't fight anymore? Of course you can. What if I hurt you again? Come on. You know who you are. You're Thena, goddess of war. Thank you. For what? For always taking care of me. I'd do it again. On any planet. I like watching him, too. Jeez. I don't think it's creepy at all. Have you read Peter Pan? Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter... Sersi is Wendy, you are Tinker Bell, for obvious reasons... and the rest of us are the Lost Boys. What's your point? Tinker Bell's always been in love with Peter. And it's hard for her 'cause she can never be with him. I'm sorry, Sprite. Kingo... why did Arishem make me this way? I don't know. I thought you broke it. Always bring backups. You have a very angry family, sir. Yeah, it's a big issue. What about King Midas? Everything he touched turned to gold. -Was that you? -Dane. -Confucius? Aristotle? -Call your uncle. What? My uncle? No. You've always wanted to make amends with him, right? Now is the time. Trust me. Sersi, you're so weird. Dane? Dane? You're breaking up. You're breaking up? How did he take the news? Couldn't bring myself to tell him it was the end of the world. There's nothing he could do. Sersi. I'm worried about you. If Arishem finds out you're trying to stop the emergence... I'm not powerful enough to protect you from him. I'm not afraid. This violent cycle has to end. Hey, stop worrying about me. Old habit. Why did you leave? I told myself... something must have happened to you. So, I waited. Days became years... and you never came back. Sersi... I've missed you. I didn't want to leave. There's something I have to tell... Ikaris! Ikaris! Watch out! Clear the camp! Get behind me! One of them took Ikaris. It's an ambush! Very nice, sir! Are you mental? Hide! We need action sequences. Sir! Sprite, get Karun out of here. How many cameras did you bring, young man? Kingo! Come on! This way! Quickly! Come on! Get in! Get in! Ikaris! I've fought that one before. It's stronger than the others. No. Terrible timing, Thena. Thena! Stop, Thena! Let them go. Now is not the time, Sersi. Please. I know you're better than this. Druig. Go! Get to the river! Gilgamesh. A little help here? Stay here. Say it. Stay here. Good. You're okay. They're headed for the camp. Go. They need you. Go, Ikaris. Sprite, buy me some time! Can you hurry up? Now! Dishoom. Karun! Did you get that? I did, sir! -Kingo! -Just go. I'm not leaving you. Sprite! Ikaris! Sersi! Are you all right? How did you do that? I don't know. Stop, stop, stop. Thena. No. Gilgamesh. Stay back. Ajak... Her memories... I understand now. I can see what she saw. So many planets. So much life destroyed every time a Celestial is born. Arishem used us... and left us to die with each emergence. We just wanted to survive. And then he sent you. I will kill you all for what you have done to my kind. You are not saviors, Eternals. You are murderers. Ikaris! Thena. Hey. Remember. No. No. I'll remember. I'll remember. I'll remember. When I left... I thought about taking over the minds of every human on this planet. Violence, fear, greed... all gone. Why didn't you? Because without their flaws... they wouldn't be human. Please, Druig. You can't stay here anymore. These Deviants are trying to keep us from killing their own kind. They have a conscience now. That makes them more dangerous. No, Sersi. That makes them us. Eternals and Deviants. Arishem's children. But you are asking me to take control of a mind of a Celestial. I do not have that kind of power. We'll need Phastos. Well, good luck. He gave up on humans a long time ago. I did this. If my technology hadn't helped them advance... Druig was right. Our mission was a mistake. These people... they're not worth saving. Oh, Phastos. They're not worth saving. -Thanks. -Give me a good one. -All right. -Over here. And... -Oh, that's great, man! -Yeah! -Yeah! -Oh, yeah! -Nice. -Good one. All right, ready? Throw! So close. -Daddy, Daddy, watch this. -Yeah, okay. -Watch this. -Let me see. Let me see it. Dad. I'm only a starter. Hi. Hello. Can we help you? Throw it again. Hey, Jack. Ben. Hey, guys. These are my friends from college. This is Sylvia and Isaac. That's Isaac. -Isaac. -Dad, that's Superman. -Dad, that's Superman! -Jack... That's really funny, Jack. -No, no! He is Superman. -That is definitely not Superman. I saw him on TV. He was in London, fighting a monster. And you were with a cape and you were shooting laser beams out of your eyes. I don't wear a cape. -Oh, sorry. -Okay, well, we should just go inside, right? Can I call you Clark? Is that what you go by now? Because, you know... You've called me worse. You got it, Jack? Way to go. -Yes. -All right. Show me how it's done. Round and round and round and round and round. -Yep, you got it. Keep going. -Come on. Yeah. Incredibly natural, guys. So, after all these years... even you fell for Ajak's lies. No need to rub it in. It all makes sense why she wouldn't let us interfere with human conflicts. Conflicts lead to war... and war actually leads to advancement in lifesaving technology and medicine. So our mission was never to... make a peaceful or harmonious world... but to increase the population at all costs. Just farming humans as food for the Celestials, right? That's bleak. Well, so is telling your husband and your child... that they could be dead within a few days. Thought you'd given up on humans. I got lucky. Okay? I have a family now. They've given me faith again. And I see the good in humanity in them every single day. So, look, I cannot help you. -I am never leaving them. -Phastos... I'm sorry, Sersi. It was wrong for me to use my powers... without thinking about the consequences in the first place. So, now, I choose to use my hands to fix my child's bicycle, okay? Do you? I don't use my powers anymore. You sure? What are you... What the hell is wrong with you? My child is right down the hallway! That looks like someone's been using his powers. -Oh, my God. -I bet you've built the perfect safe house. What is this even made of? Vibranium? Don't! Fall collection. IKEA. Ass. How did you even deal with this guy for over 5,000 years? If you stay here, you might as well invite the Deviants to dinner. Never mind waiting for the end of the world. He has a point. No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up in my life and expect me to go with you. -I'm not gonna... -You should go, habibi. You want me to go? You know what my mom would say to you right now, right? He's a chronic procrastinator. I'm not leaving you two. No way. I'm not happy about it... but if there's a chance for us to watch Jack grow up to live a life of his own... we should take it. The Domo. Wow. A foreboding atmosphere fills the air. An eerie stillness chokes our lungs. What are you doing? You know you're creeping us out. You know that, right? Oh, God! Stay calm, T, please! Chips. It's just chips. As you can see, being an Eternal does not preclude you from having human emotions... such as cowardice. What has she done? Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab? This is Makkari. Or should I say Miss Havisham? None of us have seen her for centuries. Is that the Ebony Blade? Excalibur. Arthur always did have a crush on you. That, and the world is ending. Have you seen my movies? DVD? It's all about streaming now. You know, what you need is a Kindle. Do you know what that is? It's like a... You know, I just realized that if you don't know what an iPad is... there's almost no way to explain it. So, how did you end up scoring this Emerald Tablet... my beautiful, beautiful Makkari? Did you miss me? I'm sorry, what are we watching? Because this... -Is this new? Because I hate it. -Are you two... Phastos, I need to control the mind of a Celestial. Okay, get ready for it. Bracelets? You made us bracelets? So, here's a little Celestial 101. Celestials are the most powerful energy generators in the universe. When Arishem made us, he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy... to keep our bodies regenerating. The bracelets, in theory... shut down our regeneration process. And once that happens, our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy. What for? Well, if the Deviants can absorb our energy... what if we can absorb each other's energy as well? If I can find a way to connect us all... one of us could become immensely powerful... pulling the accumulated energy from the rest... forming... a Uni-Mind. ""Uni"" meaning ""one,"" ""mind"" meaning ""mind."" Oh, no, we heard you the first time. -Terrible name. -We'll brainstorm... ""Brainstorm""! -That's a way better name! -No, I invented it... so I'm calling it whatever I want. We find humans a new home on another planet. Are we building a big ship, too? Take a pair of each animal? Well, you know what's never saved the planet? Your sarcasm. Space colonization could take decades. It can happen quickly with our help. What if we end up accidentally killing Tiamut? We could be responsible for billions of lives not being created across the universe. Boss, am I right? Say something, Ikaris. You don't think we should be doing this. Ajak chose Sersi to lead us. Sersi should decide. Forget who Ajak chose. You're the strongest. You should be making this decision. Fine. Just keep lying to yourself. Sprite. Okay, this is not... -Ikaris. -Don't run after him. Kingo, I... You guys. Hey. Don't sweat it. Sprite's always cranky. I used to hear her complaining even when she wasn't there. I'm okay, Kingo. If you think we should do this, I trust you. I will follow you to the end, like I always have. What did you say? I will follow you to the end, like I always have. I'm not who you think I am. How long do we have? Seven days. Good. We completed our mission. Where is she? London. She has a good life there. I'm sure she's missed you. If I'd gone back to her, I would only have told her the truth. She would've suffered... knowing this world she loves would end one day. Ikaris. We have to tell them the truth. What? -Why? -Because together... we might be able to stop the emergence. ""Stop the emergence""? Listen... -Ajak, I know it's hard at the end... -Listen to me, Ikaris. I have followed Arishem for millions of years. And I have never doubted him. -Until now. -Why now? Why now? Five years ago, Thanos erased half of the population of the universe. Delayed the emergence. But the people of this planet... brought everyone back with the snap of a finger. You know, after I let you all go... I traveled the world, living among them. I have seen them fight and lie and kill... but I have also seen them... laugh and love. I've seen them create and dream. This planet... and these people... have changed me. The cost of Arishem's design, it's not worth it. Not this time. I trust you, Ajak. I'll follow you to the end... as I always have. Thank you. We have to bring everyone back together. There's something I have to show you first. It's just up ahead. They must have been trapped in the ice for centuries... and broke free last week when the glacier started to melt... as the Earth's core heats up for the emergence. They killed an entire company of oil workers. I tracked them here. I suspected you might have changed your mind. I can't let you betray Arishem. Why don't you just kill me yourself? When the others realize something is happening to the Earth... they'll come to you. When they find your body, they'll know the Deviants are back. It'll keep them busy until the emergence. I've been loyal to you, Ajak. Kept your secret for centuries... lied to everyone I cared about... but never have I doubted my purpose to serve the Celestials. Oh, Ikaris. I've led you down the wrong path. It's the only path I know. Thought I'd find you here. I've thought about this place a lot. Amazing how things change over time. Maybe we're the ones who've changed. I know you don't agree with our plan. I've always thought of the Celestials like the ocean. They give life and they take life away without bias. If they were gone, this universe would eventually end. What you're trying to do is free humanity from the natural order. It's not natural to allow all life on an entire planet to be destroyed. Arishem's way is archaic and violent. I don't want to fight, Sersi. It'll all end soon. Except there is no end, is there? We'd carry on without our memories... or free will... for eternity. You're afraid. I wouldn't mind leaving this world. I only wish that when we do... I would be able to remember you. I'm in love with you, Sersi. I'm grateful for the life I've lived with you. Ikaris. Sersi? It's started. Oh, no. My God. What about the Uni-Mind? I haven't figured out a way to connect us, but I'm close. -I'm very, very close. -How much longer? I don't know, Sersi! Find the point of emergence. You always knew the end was coming. It must be a relief. That Deviant is still tracking us. Revenge won't bring peace for you, Thena. But killing it might. Ikaris? What are you doing? I wanted you to leave this world in peace. Without knowing about the emergence. But I failed. I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you. I'm close to figuring it out. Boss, what are you doing? I've let this go on long enough. Don't hurt him! He lied to us. He already knew about the emergence. No, he didn't. Ajak told me everything when we left Babylon. What? You were never gonna let us stop the emergence. No. I only wanted to protect you from the Deviants. If Ajak wanted you to take her place, why did she choose me? What have you done? He killed her. I had to. She loved you. -Did she? -She loved you. Do you think it was easy to live with the truth? To know that one day all this would end? To keep on lying to you? If we gave humanity the choice... how many of them would be willing to die so that billions more could be born? We're not giving them a choice. Is this why you're willing to kill? You are so pathetic! I'm an Eternal, Phastos. I exist for Arishem. As do you. It's who you are. I wouldn't change a single thing about who I am. Born or made. But I do not exist for Arishem... I exist for my family! Then you are making the same mistake Ajak did. -No! -Makkari! Get out of here! Kingo. You do not turn against your family. Gilgamesh died because of you. You won't succeed against me. And I will kill every one of you if I have to. Wait. I'm going with you. Sprite... What is this? Because she loves him. Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that? He really fooled us, didn't he? Karun, let's go. Wait, where the hell are you going? I can't help you guys. I still think Ikaris is right. So, that's it, huh? Just gonna follow him? I love the people of this planet. But if you stop this emergence... you are preventing so many other worlds like this one... from being created. I still have faith in Arishem. But I refuse to hurt any of you for my beliefs. Even with my help, we're no match. It's Ikaris. But... I hope to see you on the next planet. Look... if I'm gonna get myself killed going up against Ikaris... we'll need to have a backup plan. All of our powers, even if they're amplified... are not enough to kill a Celestial, so... Well, Sersi did turn a Deviant into a tree. I'm sorry, what? You didn't wanna tell me that? I don't know how it happened, okay? And I'm pretty sure I couldn't do it again. Well, now is the time to try, don't you think? Phastos, that Deviant is dead. Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep, not to kill it. I can't kill a Celestial. Sersi. Sersi. We can't! We can't. It's okay, Sersi. I got this. There's no time for that. I didn't see the lies right in front of me. I'm not even sure why Ajak chose me to lead. I asked Gilgamesh once... why he chose to protect me. He said... ""When you love something, you protect it. ""It is the most natural thing in the world."" You have loved these people since the day we arrived. So, there is no one better to lead us now than you. Sersi. Get up. Ajak chose you for a reason. Sersi! Sersi! Sersi. We need you! I already gave that speech. What? You did... What... Sersi, the sphere inside of you... it creates a connection between you and Arishem. Maybe I can repurpose it... and create a connection between... well, all of us. And that can activate the Uni-Mind. -Great. -Yeah. But... I have to take it out of you. Okay. Do it. Okay. Don't kill her. Thena... Do it. Will it work? It has to. I'm glad you're here. Thank you, Sprite. Protect the emergence. You're really gonna kill them? Where's Druig? He's busy. Thena, play nice. You've never had to fight me. But I've always wanted to. It's time to put a god to sleep. I should've done this five centuries ago. Druig's gone. It's over. Phastos. I have to try and stop this. I need to get closer to Tiamut. -Keep Ikaris busy. -We've got you. Go. Enough. Thena, stop! Why are you helping Ikaris? We can't let it absorb our powers. Too late. Thena, he's trying to goad you. Don't... Makkari! Where's Sersi? You always did underestimate her. Oh, no. Not so fast. Boss. I don't know about you, but this is really satisfying, right? Let me go, Phastos! I can't let her do this! I don't think so. I've been wanting to clip your wings for a long time, Ikaris! Thena. Oh, you've changed. You're broken. Damaged. Useless. You can't protect any of them. Sersi. You're not powerful enough to do this. And you won't. You're not a killer. Maybe I've changed. And is this really who you are, Sprite? Are you really willing to let everyone on this planet die? I'm sorry, Sersi. I've always envied you, Sersi. 'Cause you get to live as one of them. And I never could. You know why I hated living with humans? Because they reminded me of things I didn't even know I wanted. Because of them, now I wanna know what it feels like to grow up. To fall in love. To have a family. And to know, in the end, I've lived. It's all over now. We get to start over somewhere new. Well, that was very moving. Druig. I can't do this. This is your fight now. Thena. It's me. Gilgamesh. Look at me. Gilgamesh? Stay here. Say it. Stay here. You'll be okay. Give me your hand. It's a shame. You and I... we're just tools of a god. Built to kill. Thena. Remember. I remember. Come on, Sersi. Come on. It's beautiful, isn't it? I'm sorry. I know. How? How did you do it? When I touched Tiamut's palm, I felt energy surging into me. Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind. I always wondered how we survived... the destruction of other planets that we were on. By being connected to the Celestial as it emerged. Is he gone? Sprite. I still have energy from the Uni-Mind. I think I can make you human. All the things you said you wanted, you can have them. But your time will be fleeting and you'll die one day. Are you ready for that? I am. {\an8}The sudden appearance of an enormous stone figure in the Indian Ocean... {\an8}...has left more questions than answers for authorities. U.S. and Australian naval ships are maintaining defensive positions... but at this... You guys did that? I love you so much. Are you okay? I get confused sometimes. Yeah. Me, too. So, Dad said you're the goddess Athena. ""Thena."" Drop the ""A."" What's your superpower? Can you just... Look... One second. Okay. All right. See, that thing is... Okay. Almost gave you a shave and a haircut, didn't she? Stand behind me, actually. You remember earmuffs? Remember how we practiced earmuffs? Thank you so much. You know that your babysitting privileges are completely revoked, right? Like, it's done. Thank you. Violence... Hey. Violence is never the answer. Right, T? You gotta always use your brain. Like you did fighting on the beach? Your dad... spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy... and he had no choice but to listen to me, so no violence. When are you guys leaving? When is that happening? That's happening soon, right? Yes, there's Druig. Don't go anywhere near him. Yeah! Okay, that's far enough, Jack. Wow, Dad, the Domo's so cool. Your dad fixed that with his bare hands. Can we go to space, too, one day? Let's wait till you get your learner's permit, okay? Hey, Phastos. Take care. This world is lucky to have you. Thank you. I know you're not a hugger, so... Okay. You think when we find the other Eternals out there... that they'll accept the truth the way we did? Told you that thing was addictive. Please visit? I'll try. When I get time off from school. Oh, wow. Listen, it's gonna be good for you to be in a human environment. You'll pick up some social skills. Oh, you didn't think you needed those? That explains so much. Gonna miss you. Me, too. Madam. Thanks, Karun. Sometimes I wonder if we did the right thing. Killing Tiamut. It's too late for that. But you followed your heart. We all did. Even Ikaris. Looks like someone's waiting for you. He's a lot cuter in person. So, after all that, you still can't change me into a giraffe? Well, I could next time I'm connected to a Celestial... during an emergence whilst performing a Uni-Mind. Yeah. That sounds like a ""no"" to me. What'll you do now? Not sure. This planet's my home, but... I can't pretend to be human anymore. I love you, Sersi. I don't care what you are. Remember when we talked about no more secrets? I have no more secrets, I promise. Actually... I have one I want to tell you. What is it? It turns out my family history is... complicated. Sersi? Sersi, what's wrong? Sersi? Sersi? Sersi? Sersi! You have chosen to sacrifice a Celestial... for the people of this planet. I will spare them... but your memories will show if they're worthy to live. And I will return for judgment. You all right, Ted? Did you see that? Arishem. We have to go back. What? Wow. My ears. My eyes are numb. No more drunk teleporting for you. Hang on, hang on. Behold... the royal prince of Titan... brother of Thanos, the Knave of Hearts... defeater... -...of Black Robert... -Roger. Defeater of Black Roger. The great adventurer... Starfox of Mystery Planet. What a pleasure to make your acquaintance... my fellow Eternals. You know, you really don't have to do the whole thing every time. Everything you do is impressive. -What am I gonna leave off the list? -No, I know it's impressive. Who are you? I'm Eros. This is Pip. And you are as beautiful as legends say, Thena. What do you want, lads? Pip and I are here to help, aren't we? Your friends are in big trouble. And we know where to find them. You can do this. You can do this. I'm sorry. I have to try. Sure you're ready for that, Mr. Whitman? <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, Oh, crap! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! That was purely reactive. Whoa! Whoa! No! No! Come on! Nate! Come on. I got you. Help! I'm falling! I got you. Come on. - I got you. - Oh, my God. - Hey, hey. Keep it down. - Oh, my God. Hey. Hey. What part of ""wait for me"" did you not get? I said I'm coming with you. Okay. Okay. We're looking for the Age of Explorers exhibit. So be quiet. Bubble Yum? That's my last piece. Let's split it. Hey. Punk. All right, smart guy. Who's this? Too easy. Ferdinand Magellan. First guy to sail around the world. Wrong. Magellan never made it all the way around. He just took all the credit. Holy shit. There it is. - What? - Shh. Come here. First map of the whole world. You know what Magellan was really looking for? Gold. But he never made it home. So all that gold, it's just gone? Whoa. Lost. Not gone. There's a difference. If something's lost, it can be found. But lucky for us, we got pirate blood in our veins. Descended from Sir Francis Drake himself. At least, that... was what Mom and Dad used to say. You know, sometimes I think they're out there somewhere. Like they're just lost. They're not lost. They're gone. All right. This map is worth a fortune. Here goes nothing. Come on. - Let's go. Hey. - Hey! - You two! Don't move. - Hey! Hey! Oh, crap. We came here first out of respect, Sister B. But this is his third strike. Go get your things, Sam. You can't just let them take him away. Say your goodbyes. What the hell? I'm not letting them lock me up. No way. I'm coming with you. Not this time. Come here. You see me go anywhere without this? No. So you know I will never leave it behind. I will always be with you. It says ""sic parvis magna."" ""Greatness from small beginnings."" That's you and me. Let's go, kid. I better get going. I'll come back for you, Nate. Promise. Never forget, you're a Drake. I love you. Oh, well, well, well, if it isn't the late, great and formerly employed Nate. Well, at least you got the ""great"" part right. Hey, Goldie, I brought your stuff up. - Thank you. - Hey, how was last night? - Great. - Yeah, he was cute? - Very cute. - Nice. - Hey. - Hi. Excuse me. Sorry. Hey, what can I get you? - A vodka tonic. - Vodka tonic? Come on. It's my first drink of the night. Test me a little. Uh, I don't know. A... A negroni. A ne-what? Uh... I'm kidding. The negroni. First made in 1919 for Count Camillo Negroni when he swapped the soda water in his usual drink, the Americano, for gin. Haven't seen you in here before. It's not really my neighborhood. Not your neighborhood? Where are you from? - Greenwich. - Greenwich. Sounds nice. Bartenders up there don't give history lessons. Well, bartenders in Greenwich don't make negronis like this. You want to leave it open or closed? Open, probably. It's only Daddy's money. The cigarette. Invented by Alfonso Cigaretti in 1462. I'm kidding. I don't... I don't really know who invented the cigarette. You're kind of weird. But kind of cute, too. Well, then I'm kind of offended, but I'm also kind of flattered. Here. - Come on. - Y-You know what? It's for the best. I've been trying to quit. Well, maybe it's a sign. Or maybe you just need to get one that works. This old thing? Oh, it works. That trust fund ingenue... She was the right mark. Don't know what you're talking about. Sure, you do. You're going slow, playing it safe, not lifting too much at once. I mean, stop me if I'm wrong. Well, you're wrong. And we're also closed, so take off. Victor Sullivan. You can call me Sully. Thank you. I won't, but thank you. I got a job coming up... a big one. I need another set of hands on it. So this is what you do? You stumble into bars, trying to pick up an accomplice? I'm offering you a real ticket out of here, a chance to see places you only read about in books. What do you say? You missed the read, Victor. I'm not a mark in some bar. And some of us here would really like to go home, so... get out. Fair enough. Bye-bye, now. Hey, Goldie, let me get a beer. Sure. Son of a bitch. Hey, hey, hey, get your head - out of your ass. - Whoa. I'm so sorry. I didn't see ya. Hey. I see patience ain't your virtue. Surprised to see me? Not even slightly. I made you a drink. Shirley Temple. That's hilarious. And the bracelet? It's in the first drawer there on my desk, if you want it. But I think you're here 'cause you got bigger fish to fry. Nah, I'm just here for the bracelet. You done? No. Oof. This looks valuable. Now I'm done. Why the map? Of everything in here, that stopped you. Because it looks like it might be authentic. Oh, not might be. It is. Holy shit. This line here shows the path that Ferdinand Magellan took to sail around the world. First guy to do it. You know your history. Yeah, only he wasn't the first guy to do it. Magellan died in the Philippines on a random beach somewhere. It was his captain, Juan Sebastin Elcano, finished the trip with 17 others. Also known as the Infamous 18. I know the legend that his voyage wasn't about exploration... it was about finding that gold... but it's just a story. No. I beg to differ. These trips were hugely expensive back then. The king of Spain couldn't afford it. There wasn't gonna be any trip until a private financier stepped in. House of Moncada. Yep. Bankrolled the Crusades, the Inquisition, Franco's fascists in the '30s and just about every horrible thing you can think of. They offered Magellan his grand voyage of exploration so long as he came back with that gold. How much gold? Today's dollars... Five billion, easy. It's the biggest treasure that's never been found. Look, I've been dreaming about this since I was a kid, but somehow you already knew that. You know, when Sam said he had a little brother who was just as into this Magellan stuff, I thought, ""There's no way."" Wait, you know my brother Sam? Oh, we were practically friends. That's saying something, considering the company I keep. Look. Look at him. He has a beard. Where is he? When was this taken? Almost two years ago, San Sebastin, Spain. We were getting close to Captain Elcano's tomb, where Sam was sure we'd find his journal and in it the location of that gold. Then he disappears. Doesn't call, doesn't answer my texts, nothing. He ghosted me. Yeah, that sounds like my brother. Oh, so he hasn't been in touch? Sam? No. Not even a postcard? No, not a postcard, phone call, text message, email, nothing. Hey, look, I don't know what happened between you two, but I think if we find that gold, there's a real good chance we find him, too. What do you say? Sam left when I was 10. He would call every once in a while, swore he'd come back, but he never did. The Sam that I knew disappeared a long time ago. So, nah, you'll have to find somebody else. Wow. I'm really losing my touch. Wish you were here, bro. There's a whole world you haven't seen, but you will. I promise. Hey, kid. What took you so long? So, when do we start? There's an auction coming up. Biggest collection of Spanish Renaissance art and artifacts anywhere this century. One of those items is La Cruz de la Hermandad. Only it's not a cross. It's a key... a key that unlocks the chamber where the Infamous 18 hid their gold. Very cool, but the legend said there are two keys, one for the captain and one for the crew, so no one man could steal the gold by himself. One key doesn't do us any good. You ever get outside when you were a kid? I mean, how do you remember all this shit? Only one thing: I already have the captain's key. Second one's in there. The Augustine... it's an auction house. It's very exclusive, but I got us on the list. Look, all I need you to do is kill the power during the auction. That'll trigger the main alarm, - and then I can do my thing. - Okay. And how am I supposed to kill the power? Well, shit, that's up to you. I mean, you got to bring something to the equation. I'm not cutting you in for fun. Actually, that's a good point. We haven't spoken about my cut yet. I assume we're 50-50, right? Fifty-fif...? On what, the gold? - Yeah. - Are you high? You know this has been years of my life? You get ten percent, - and that's me being generous. - Wow. That's awfully generous. What are you gonna do with that kind of money? You still working on the tie? I just can't figure out the length. I just keep making it all fat. Come here. You know what you're doing? Yeah, my dad was a Navy man. I could do this one-handed with my eyes shut. You served, too, didn't you? Dishonorable discharge. Hey, you did some homework, huh? - Of course I did. - I flew helicopters. I was preserving some artifacts from a museum in Baghdad. I was over the max load weight, crashed pretty hard. They got all upset, kicked me out. Bit of an overreaction, but what are you gonna do? You say ""preserving,"" but you mean looting, right? Well, if I didn't take 'em, somebody else would've. - You asked for that. - Thank you. And what's with the cat? Oh, the cat? She's just for you. - What? - Yeah. Your life seemed super sad. No, no, no, I'm not gonna keep this thing. They're gonna shit all over my floor. - Hey, wait for me. - Hey. These people can tell a fake when they see one, all right? You have to believe the lie you're selling. You belong here. You're one of them. Or you can just go with the Bubblicious. Jesus. No, this is Bubble Yum. It's the same thing. Here, put that in your ear. No way. Hello? - Hello? - I can hear you. I'm sitting right next to you. Oh, shit, I think I pushed it in too far. - Is it okay? - Let's go. Oof. Look at that car. Bet that ain't cheap. Shit. Santiago Moncada. - Like the House of Moncada? - Yeah. He thinks the cross is his by birthright. If he buys it before we can grab it, you kiss that gold goodbye. Welcome, sir. What can I get you? You know what, I'll have a martini. Yes, sir. - A martini? - Yeah. Why not? That'll go great with the bubble gum. You should actually put the gum in the martini. You'd have a bubble gum martini. - That's actually not a bad idea. - Yeah. My God, this girl is totally flirting with me. - Where? - There. The woman with Moncada. Look, she's flirting with me. Hi. It's not flirting, all right? Not with you. That is Jo Braddock. You ever see her coming, you need to run the other way. I'm serious. She's coming this way now. Look. Yeah, then you know what to do. You'll thank me later. Hello, Victor. Oh, what's the matter? Feelings still hurt after San Sebastin? You're something else. So, what ridiculous scheme have you cooked up this time? Well, if I tell you, it'll ruin the surprise. Well, you do tend to ruin everything, don't you? I'm not the one working for Moncada. I mean, that's low... even for you, Jo. Whatever gets me the gold, right? Well, you taught me that, Victor. Increble. Whoa, Jesus. Oh, sorry. It's pretty cool, huh? Well, it's a one-of-a-kind solid-gold altar crucifix. Handcrafted in Barcelona in the early 16th century, so it's... yes, yeah, it's pretty cool, yeah. Wow. You know your crosses. My family has been looking for this one for a very long time. No way. So have I. Y-You are a collector? I dabble. I don't dabble. This cross has a very tragic history. 18 men died trying to hold on to it. So much blood so needlessly spilled. Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please. Good luck to you. Would you please take your seats? The auction will be commencing very soon. Hey, Bubble Yum. You done chatting up our archnemesis? I'm pretty sure he just threatened to kill me. Don't touch your ear like that. You look like an idiot. Get a move on. Now, most of you may be well aware of the fact that... Gonna make my way upstairs. ...are made from some of the most exciting items, many of which are exceedingly rare, from our Spanish Renaissance collection. Uh, your girlfriend seems pissed. Is that something I should be worried about? Just stay focused. So, once again... Keep an eye on him for me. ...if you would, please come and take your seats. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Okay, let's get started, then, with lot number one. A magnificent oil on copper, ""Our Lady of Good Counsel"" by Bartolom Prez. Hello? 600,000, going once, going twice... Sold to the lady in the back. Thank you very much. The cross is up next, kid. Um... Sully, don't worry. I got it. Ow. La Cruz de la Hermandad. Now, most of you will know this was made in Barcelona circa 16th century. It is truly a gorgeous piece and representative of Spanish Renaissance gold work. So, we're gonna start off tonight's bidding at 200,000. Do I have 200,000 in the room? Thank you very much. I have an opening bid of 200,000 from Mr. Moncada. Okay. Here we go. Do I hear four? How we doing? We're doing great. 500,000 it is. Do I have six? I have six. Thank you very much, madam. - I don't have all night. - Do I have seven? 700,000 from Mr. Moncada. Do we have eight? No takers? So, fair warning on 700,000. That is 700, going once... Don't make me do this. ...700, going twice. And... There we are at the back of the room. Thank you very much, sir. We have 800,000. 800,000 is the bid, ladies and gentlemen. Do I have nine? I'm spending money I don't have. Okay. Here goes nothing. Oh, God! Ya shouldnae come out to play with the big boys, wee'un, 'cause you're about to get a proper Scottish welcome. I'm sorry? Mr. Moncada, it's back to you now... 1.9. Mr. Moncada makes it an even $2 million, ladies and gentlemen. Well, train's already left the station, right? Why not? 2.1. Thank you very much, indeed. Mr. Moncada, over to you. Any advances on that? 2.2. We have 2.2, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, God, here she comes. I said ya shouldnae come out to play with the big boys, wee'un, 'cause you're about to get a proper Scottish welcome! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I literally have no idea what you're saying. You little... 2.2 is what we have. Do I have 2.3? He goes with it. Mr. Moncada takes it to $3 million. Stupid door. Okay. Um... Oh, God. Sully, I think you're just gonna have to buy that cross. Fair warning. $3 million it is, going once... You better do something now. Kill the power, fake a heart attack... I don't give a shit. ...going twice... And... Ah, this is gonna suck! Get back here! Get on him! Come on, come on! Well, that was something. - What's your plan now? - Well, at least you fat-asses can't come out here and get me. There is a small situation, but I'm sure we'll have it sorted out - in just a second. - Come on, careful. Can we secure the cross, please? - Thank you very much. - Grab him by the trousers and get him by the balls! Security, can you go down and find out exactly what's going on? You're doing great. Hang in there. Oh... Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Hey, Trent, Addison wanted me to take that to the vault pronto. - Okay. - Thanks. Everybody, remain calm. Sully, where you going? You can't leave me. There's only one rule in this game, kid: Don't get caught. Excuse me, sir. We need to ask you a few questions. I think that's a little rude. I think I should be asking you the questions, if I'm honest. Actually, you know what? I'm-a do you one better. I'm-a get my lawyer to ask the questions, starting with: Who installed that handrail? I mean, look at that thing. - Hey! - Hey, get back here! Hey! Even more ridiculous than I could have imagined. I don't know. I think it was going pretty well so far. Funny. I think that belongs to me. Jo, come on. Save it, Victor. - Save... - Oh, thank God. Guys, she's trying to steal the cross. Just put down the case and step aside. Yeah, put down my case. Step aside. I'll get this to where it belongs. Good luck. All right, lady. Stay calm, all right? Sorry sons of bitches. All right, let's get out of here, Tony. Hey. You surprised to see me? Well, you proved yourself again, kid. That was some swan dive you took. You were just gonna leave me back there. Well, it wouldn't do any good having us both locked up. Somebody had to get the cross. Holy shit, you got it. Hey, maybe I should hold on to that for... What, you don't trust me? Oh, is that supposed to be funny? Here. Tony, take us to Teterboro. Unless you want to get dropped off somewhere else. Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Sorry, Sully, but I'm all in. Hey, Tony, Teterboro. Wow. Captain's journal. This is amazing. There's some crazy shit in there, huh? It's unbelievable. I mean, it totally confirms the legend. Magellan did find tons of gold in the Philippines. They hid the gold in Barcelona and then told the Moncadas that the trip was a bust. Okay, well, you have any bright ideas on how to use the keys? Yeah, here. The captain wrote, ""The path begins in Barcelona where the keys turn into pine."" And then there's a sketch here of a pine tree. Here. So we're looking for a tree. - Really? - Yeah. Wow. That's your expert analysis? Well, you just gave me the book like an hour ago. What am I supposed to do? I mean, I got that far on my own. I've seen the picture of the tree. Where's the gold? Is it under the tree? Is it in the tree? - I don't know. Could be. - Look out the window. There's a lot of trees in Barcelona. All right, anything you need in Barcelona, Chloe Frazer can get it. I didn't tell her about you yet, but she's cool. Hey, Chlo. Who the hell is this? I'm Nate. I'm a friend of Sully's. Sully doesn't have any friends. I should know. I'm one of them. That's not true. People love me. And what's with the spy games? Why couldn't we meet at the house? I was making sure you weren't followed. Come on, you don't think I can spot a tail? Mate, I've been on you since the airport. Really? All the way from the airport? Look, it doesn't matter. Why is he here? Why am I...? Why are you here? Clearly, you didn't tell him. Chloe has the other cross. - What? - Did I not mention that? - No, you didn't. - Are you sure? Well, look, - it's mine, basically, all right? - Okay. So we're all gonna be partners on this thing. That's the way it's happening, so get used to it. No, we're not. Look, word to the unwise... everything out of this one's mouth is an exaggeration, a half-truth - or an outright lie. - You know what? That is not true. See ya, Sully. That's... Come on, Chlo. She'll come back. She has to. I don't think she's coming back. So? - Where's the cross? - It's in my bag. Check your bag. Do it now. Shit. You let her take the cross? You let her take the cross. - Shit. - You better get that cross back! You got to be kidding me. What a rookie mistake. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Whoa! - Could you move any slower?! - I got a bad ankle, kid. I can't be running around out here. Oh, shit! Move! Out of the way! Move, move, move! Move! Listen! You don't know where you're going with them keys! Look, you're looking for a tree, right? Piss off. Listen to me. The 18 were willing to wait years to go back for the gold. They wouldn't have picked a tree as a marker. They would have picked something more permanent. You're full of shit. Hey. Let her go. She knows where to use the keys, then she doesn't need us, right? Okay. Be my guest. Get out of here. Thank you. Bye. If it's not a tree, what is it? At the auction house, Moncada called it an ""altar crucifix."" I didn't think about it then, but it means that the cross was originally made to stand on an altar. In a church. Which church? God, you guys never stop, do you? Look, if we want to get the gold, we're gonna have to figure out a way to trust each other. So give me the key. Which church? Santa Maria del Pi. Saint Mary of the Pine. This has to be it. You might just be a genius. ""Genius"" is a stretch. Oh, yeah? Look at that. Now you know why I brought him. Hmm. Okay. Good work. I'll go see when we might have a private look inside. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't even think about it. - What? - Well, you don't catch on too quick, do you? She's not to be trusted. You met her for two minutes, she already stole the cross from you. She's coming back. There's a midnight mass tonight, so tomorrow's the earliest we can poke around. You got our gear at the house, right? Yeah. Come on. Father. You said we were going to discuss this. I changed my mind. I'm allowed. It's not yours to give. You built none of it - they did. Our fortune is dipped in blood. And giving it all away will release that stain? I should have cut you off years ago. Ms. Braddock. Welcome to Barcelona as my ancestors knew it. Quite something, isn't it? Yes, it's truly an impressive excavation. Yeah. This competitor of yours, Victor Sullivan... maybe he's the one I should have hired. Victor Sullivan is a liar and a fraud. Any deal you make with him is worthless. Perhaps. But I've been told, uh, he was seen in the Barrio Gtico. Maybe you should look into it. Yes, sir. Good. I found my cross in a crypt in Genoa, but I didn't know it was a key to a much bigger fortune. Sully knew. Doesn't say what happens after we turn the keys. ""Trust in your fellow man, for one will go to heaven and the other to hell."" Well, it's ironic, seeing as the only point in having two keys was that the 18 didn't trust each other. Well, good thing they didn't, or we wouldn't be here, right? Like one big happy family. Toast? All right. Arriba, abajo, al centro y pa' dentro. Hey, kid, slow down. That's a vintage rioja, all right? You might want to just taste it, savor it. Or chug it down like you're on spring break. All good. I'm onto you, you know. Sully. What? He's Sam's brother, isn't he? Oh, wow, you cracked the case. Great job. Does he know what happened? Not yet. I-I'm gonna tell him. When? Who's still thirsty? I found another bottle of red. Hey, kid, you think she's okay? - Who? - My cat. You have a cat? The man from the app said he was gonna feed her, but he didn't text me back yet. I don't know what's cuter... your concern or the fact that you just said ""the man from the app."" Stop. Do you come here to ruin the one place I find peace? Father, you can't give it away. Tell me it's not too late. You can't change my mind. I'm making the arrangements. This scavenger hunt is over. Padre. Do you really have no faith in me? In Him I have faith. Who the hell are you? Get out of my car! Santiago, what are you doing? Forgive me, Father. Oh, great. Nuns. Why's it always got to be nuns? All right, let's just split up and figure out where the keys go, huh? Okay. Never thought I'd be back in church, but this one's special. Hey, Sully. What? Nothing. Hey, guys. Come here. Look. ""JSE."" Juan Sebastin Elcano. The 18 were here all right. Look, if that's the cathedral, then these must be the stairs, and they lead... that way. Thoughts, altar boy? ""Caelum."" That's, um, Latin for ""heaven."" Says in the journal, ""Trust in your fellow man, for one shall go to heaven, the other to hell."" So, if heaven's up there, then hell has to be around here somewhere. I hope. Hey, I got a skeleton with angel wings. That's kind of between heaven and hell, right? Does Mary look a little off to you? Yeah. No way. Hey. Come on, open it up. I'm not gonna do that. We're in a church, man. Come on, have some respect. Scared of a little old nun? Well, you haven't met Sister B, have you? Hold that. Here. Okay. Well, there's hell. Whoa! Holy shit. You found 'em. Hey, what does that look like to you? A keyhole. Wait, which way should we turn, left or right? I don't know. Uh, what does the book say? Um... oh, right here. Both-both of you, uh, turn your keys clockwise at the same time. Three, two, one. Turn. Shit! Thanks a lot. You almost got me killed. Clockwise, Sully? Well, it was 50-50, so I made a guess. A guess? That could've been our heads! Well, clearly, you should turn the keys the other way. Kid, I don't even have my glasses. I can't read this shit. Yeah, clearly. Just be careful, all right? You're gonna get somebody killed. Okay, come on. Counterclockwise. Just look away from it. Ready? Here we go. Three, two, one. Turn. Whoa! Look at that. I was right the second time, huh? Like, an opening back here. You want to help, Sully? Oh, kid, I'm watching our back. What if the nun comes down to get you? Chloe? There you go. All right, we're making some progress. - Let's go. - No, wait. Hang on. What does the book say? Uh, heaven and hell. One of us goes up, the other goes down. - Exactly. I'll go down. - Yeah, I'll come with you. - Really? - What? - Well, that was quick. - What are you talking about? What, are you just gonna follow her down there like a puppy dog? What, you want me to come with you, - hold your hand? - You know what? It's fine. Give me your cross. Not giving you my cross. Why would I do that? 'Cause I'm probably gonna need it up there. You have your girlfriend's cross, don't you? You don't need 'em both. Okay, good point. Well, give me your phone. - No. - Sully, just give me your phone. - For what? - What, you don't trust me? I don't trust anybody. I thought I told you that already. Thank you. I thought you knew better. Oh, my God. You have so many apps open. What is wrong with you? Tinder? - Really? - I-I own that. Okay. Now you can track us. Try and stay on top of us, okay? - There you go. - Have fun in the haunted tunnel. - Yeah. - Enjoy. Oh, we will. This is amazing. I mean, we're the first ones down here in 500 years. Find the other two. I've got Sully. Aye. Hey, I got an arrow pointing this way. The Eye of Providence. I say we go with God. But there's literally an arrow that points this way. Suit yourself. But the arrow. I'm gonna go this way. Yeah, we should go your way. We should go your way. Um... Ah, great. Here we go again. Do you want to work your magic? So, uh, when did you decide to become Indiana Jones? When I was a kid, I liked to go exploring. One day, I found a bronze statue covered in gems buried under a bridge. I'll never forget the feeling, you know? I ran and showed it to my father. I thought he'd put it in a museum. But instead, he sold it. He kept all the money. We never saw him again. Wow, that sucks. I'm sorry. Why? I'm better for it. Here. I got just the tool. You see that? Sure, when the big bad nun's not around. Does this look right to you? Well, I don't really know what the path to ancient treasure's supposed to look like. - More ancient? - I guess. Hey, Sully, do you see anything weird up there? You're gonna have to be more specific. Do you hear that? What the hell? Hey, what's going on down there? Hey, this can't be right, can it? I can't hear one thing you're saying. Come on, let's go. Yeah, this definitely doesn't look right. Look, above the bar. ""Infernum."" Isn't that Latin for ""hell""? Yeah, it is. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - It's Braddock's backup. - What? We better keep moving. - What are you doing? - Blending in. Yeah, it's not a bad idea. Hey, listen, I'm not really much of a dancer. - Let's go. - Okay. Hey, two Commonwealths. Okay. What are you doing? I'm causing a distraction. Oh, for God's sake. Do you think it's another puzzle? Well, whatever it is, you better figure it out fast. I'm-a try and buy us some time. - Hey, can I get you a drink? - Gin and tonic, por favor. This definitely isn't a gin and tonic, but it is on the house. Gracias. Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me guess. Pia colada? The Eye. You think you're a comedian, do you, sunshine? Okay, I got it, I got it. Sex on the Beach. Nate! Oh, shit. Nate, this is not a time for shots. Let's go! God, those guys suck. Where the hell are we? Well, well, well. Look for a way out. Think I found one. Uh, almost caught up. Hey, you got that key? Yeah. - Water. - A lot of water. Oh, my God. Um, this has to be a test. The 18 must have built an escape, right? What did the journal say again? Uh, it said, ""Trust in your fellow man, for one shall go to heaven, the other to hell."" ""Trust in your fellow man, for one..."" - Sully! - Sully! Uh, Sully! There has to be another keyhole up there somewhere that opens this door! I'm, like, literally in a Papa Johns right now. Sully, we're running out of time! I found it. Excuse me, guys. I'm gonna need a minute. Sully, we do not have a minute! Hand it over, Victor. Oh, shit! Give me the cross. Come on, Jo. You know I can't do that. You haven't said ""please."" Now. Okay. Didn't I tell you you should've said ""please""? Oh, come on, Sully. After all we've been through? Sully! Hurry! Shut up. I'm working on it. I'll shut up when you get us the hell out of here. Oh, sh... What's going on?! Sully, if you don't turn that damn key, we're gonna drown. It's gonna take a little longer than I thought, kid. You got to help me. Gonna try to get this grate up, okay? Okay. I can't believe you walked out on me, you son of a bitch. Why? Did you miss me? Sully! It's now or never, buddy! We're running out of options down here! Nate, look at me. - We can do this. - Okay. - We can do this. - Deep breaths. Did you miss this, Victor? Hmm? Chloe! Chloe. Chloe, please. Come on! Okay. It's okay. Here, I'm gonna lift you out. Hey, guys. Say something. Tell me you're alive. Yeah, we're good. We're still alive. All right, then what are you waiting for? Get a move on. Thank you. You had it. - Yeah. - Yeah. - You good? - Yeah. Hey, Sully, you still up there? I'm here. What do you got? Not much. It's dark as hell in here. I always wanted to try this. You need to give that thing up already. Oh, come on. Ha. See? That's all I ask. Little faith. I see a light. Is that you? Yeah, that's us. We're in some sort of... Roman antechamber. Whoa. Hey, you got that key? Thank you. Okay. No, it doesn't fit. Sully. Okay. Sully, we're missing something. See if you can find anything up there. I can't get the grate up. Forget the grate and look. I see something. Looks like a ladder or something. I think I get it. I think it's the two keys put together. What? I said I think it's the two keys put together. Throw your key down! Hey. You two think you're gonna double-cross me? Hey, Sully, you want the stupid key, or you want the gold? Come on, this is it. Throw it down. I'm coming down there for this. You hear me? You ain't gonna play me. Typical Sully. He'd rather lose the gold than... Thank you. Does that look like a ladder to you? Yeah. Okay, ready? Three, two, one. Did you see that? What are you waiting for? Whoa. What the...? - What's happening? - We found it. Is the gold there? Talk to me. We're in an old Roman storehouse. It's got to be at least 2,000 years old, and there are these giant urns that are like eight feet tall. Are they intact? Yeah, they're perfectly preserved. So, what are you waiting for? Open them up and get the gold. Give me a lift. Here we go. Three, two, one. Go. Okay. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. - You good? - Yeah. You see anything? Uh... Chloe? Salt. Chloe? I think we have a problem. Chloe? They used salt to store food, but... I don't know why they'd put... - What's happening? - No. It's got to be here. Yeah, or why all the tricks? Answer me, guys. What do you got? The gold's not here. Oh, my God. What? What is it? They never brought it back. The path to the gold starts here in Barcelona, but it ends somewhere over here in the East Indies. Hey, Chloe. Give it to me. You're kidding, right? I'm not getting screwed on this one. Pick up the map and give it to me. Nate, what's going on down there? Slowly. Hey, tell me what's happening. Sully, I got this. Look, you don't have to do this, okay? Don't... try anything. You can trust me. Just put the gun down. You have no idea who you're partnered with, do you? You don't even really know what went down. Went down with what? Sam. Who do you think? What are you talking about? Ask Sully. No, no, no, no, no. No. Chloe, please tell me what happened to my brother. Please. You're a good guy, Nate. Too good. Hey, Nate. Wake up. Got you pretty good, huh? I tried to warn you about her, but you didn't want to listen, did you? What happened to my brother? Stop thinking of the next lie you're gonna tell me. Where's Sam, Sully? I should've told you before. But your brother... he's gone, kid. No, he's not. You said he ghosted you. He's gone. He didn't ghost me. We went down to the captain's tomb together to find the journal. And it was there, right where Sam said it would be. We were on our way out, and Braddock and her guys, they cut us off. They opened fire, and... and Sam got shot. So you just left him there to die. I saw a way out, so I took it. So you just left him there to die. What was I supposed to do, get shot, too? Nothing I could do. How could you not tell me this? Well, I knew if I told you, you never would've come with me. And why is that so important, huh? The hell am I doing here and not somebody else? Your brother believed that there was a final piece. All right? A last trick the 18 played. I thought maybe he said something to you or sent you something. I mean, shit, all he ever did - was talk about you. - So that's what this is about. You dragged me all the way out here, let me believe that I might see my brother again because you think that I know something? Yeah. Do you? Did you really just ask me that? You said that money changes people... makes them greedy, makes them selfish... but you know what I think? I think that's just who you are. I don't think there was ever a better version of you. And whatever this is... now I'm done. Kid. Mr. Moncada. We've run into some difficulties. The gold was never here beneath the city. Yeah, I know. It's quite embarrassing, huh? I believe there was a clue left down there, and we know who has it: a Miss Chloe Frazer. My people are out looking for her now... Oh, you mean the big guy who doesn't talk and his sidekick, the Highlander? Yeah, they didn't find me. Diversified investment. I hired Miss Frazer the same day I hired you. Of course, she will lead the operation from here on out. I haven't forgotten my promise. Remember, if something's lost, it can be found. I know where she took the map. Moncada. Right? I mean, think about it. Who else is gonna have the resources she's gonna need? And Braddock and her goon squad just so happened to find us at the church? He had to have somebody on the inside. You hate me. All right, I get it. Look, I'd hate me, too. But Braddock, after what she did to your brother? She shot him in cold blood. All right? We can't let her win. She... Oh, Sully, will you please just stop trying to play me for like five minutes? For years, I told myself that Sam would come back. That he wasn't gone, that he was just lost. But instead, I'm stuck here with you, so this is how this is gonna go. I'm gonna finish what my brother started, and then we go our separate ways. All right. It's a deal, kid. Hey. Be careful when you load her. I don't want her getting scratched. Yes, sir. Nice car. Yeah. My father gave me this car when I turned 18. It's been my good-luck charm ever since. The map. You know... it's natural to feel some conflict. You made a difficult decision but the right one. I don't really do regret. Neither do I. Shall we? When you're right, you're right, huh? You don't have to apologize to me now. She only cut us out because she knew you were gonna cut her out. You're still harboring feelings for that girl who knocked you on your ass, huh? Wow. Let's go! Move it in, lock it down! All right, come on. They're getting ready to go. Maravilloso. Now, who is ready to make a little history? I overlaid the map with modern satellite imagery. We'll drop our supplies from the air, land in Kiamba, Philippines, where we'll be met by our local forces. We should find the pot at the end of the rainbow here, in Cala de Oro. Vmonos. Approaching drop zone. Lowering cargo door. To the victor... the spoils. Ah, come on. Give it to them. 500 years ago, my family was betrayed. Yes, a small band of explorers, they found the world biggest fortune. And you know what? They hid it. Uh, for centuries, people search for it, all in vain. It was left to me to recover my family's gold. Nobody thought I could do it. And certainly not my... my father. Now, today... is the day I restore the Moncadas' fortune. And I bring honor back to my house. And I earn my place in... Daddy was right... you don't have what it takes. The House of Moncada dies with you. Where's Frazer? No loose ends. That was literally the worst ten hours of my life. You want to get caught, just keep talking. Oh, good job, Jo. Oh, shit. It's hard to find a good partner in this game, huh? Well, maybe you'll learn to appreciate me a little bit more. All right, let's find some parachutes. - Parachutes? What? - Unless you know a better way to jump out of a plane. It looks like the lassie's boosted. Hey. Don't even think about it. I can't just let her get away with it. This is not the place to pick a fight, okay? I'm trying to protect you. Put one of these on. Let's go now. Hey! Did you kill my brother? I said, did you kill my brother, Sam Drake? Nate! Come on! Whoa. Whoa! Oh, God! Hey, Braddock! We found your loose end. Now get rid of her. Oh, crap! We can patch this up, Frazer. Drop the gun. I don't think you've been counting. You've only got one shot left. I got to give it to you, Frazer. A fighter to the bitter end. This is a very bad idea. But this is the end. Whoa! - Nate? - Oh, come on! What the hell are you doing?! You just hit me with a car! - You don't have a parachute? - You don't have a parachute! - Follow me! - What? Come on. Whoa! Oh, shit! Pull the cord! Nate, come on! I'm trying! Hold on. Hold on! I'm not gonna apologize, if that's what you're waiting for. I could probably forgive you for what you did in Barcelona. Maybe even for knocking me out of a plane with a car. But Braddock? Really? You really think there's any difference between them and you? You and Sully were just as eager to screw me over as they were. Look, I'm not Sully, okay? Hallelujah. One's bad enough. Nate? Do you see what I'm seeing? Well, if what you're seeing is endless open ocean, then yeah. Holy shit. Whoa. What the hell happened to you two? Fell out of a car that fell out of a plane. Huh. Hey, you know, something like that happened to me once. Ah. Okay. Good luck. And here is your card back, Mr. Sullivan. Please, call me Victor. Come on, I spent ten hours in a trunk with him. I couldn't help myself. Let me show you to your room. Thank you. Moncada's money has bought us everything we need. All right, let's get to work. Hey there. - Hey. - What are you doing? Are you sure these dimensions are the same as the actual map? To the exact millimeter. Why? Braddock isn't gonna find the gold. Well, not where she's looking, anyway. You mean we still have a chance? The captain left one final clue, and Sully seems to think that Sam knew what that clue was, and he might have tried to tell me what it was. These postcards are the only thing I've got from Sam in the last ten years, so if he did try to tell me something, it... has to be in these cards. For the love of God, please be trying to tell me something, Sam. Is it something in the images? Or something in the writing. Like an anagram or a cipher. We used to do that all the time as kids. Well, let's start with the images. - Do blue. - Colors. - There's a lot of blue. - Okay, okay. Um... There's one card where he spells everything wrong. - Weird. - Where is that? - T-H-A-R... - Um... - Hills. - H-Hills? Hills. So try writing, uh, this out. - ""Wish you were here, bro."" - ""Wish you were here..."" And then for every letter you write down, find the corresponding letter. So, ""Wish you were here, bro."" I'm gonna go to sleep. Come on, Sam. What are you trying to tell me? What are you trying to tell me, buddy? ""There's a whole world you haven't seen, but you will."" ""There's a whole world you haven't seen..."" ""Haven't seen."" Okay, come on. Come on, come on. ""There's a whole world you haven't seen, but you will. Promise. Sam."" ""The keys are your compass."" ""The keys are your compass."" ""The key..."" Okay, okay, okay. Some compass, my ass. Holy shit. Blue goes there. And red goes there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Chloe. Okay. - Get out. - Okay. Jump. - Let's go. - Not bad. Very good. Chloe? I'm sorry, Nate. I like you. I really do. But I learned the hard way the minute you start to trust someone, you lose. Yeah, well... too bad you're headed in the wrong direction. What the hell? Lost. Not gone. There's a difference. If something's lost, it can be found. We did it, Sam. We did it. Cloves. You know, back then, spices were worth nearly as much as gold. Why am I not surprised? I keep too many apps open, remember? - I knew you'd figure it out. - Figure what out? The puzzle in Sam's postcards. - So, what is it? - Does it matter? I already found the gold. I don't see any gold. Oh, it's here. It's a false top. Old pirate trick. Here's your gold you've been looking for. You happy now? Holy shit. You got to be kidding me. Well, look at that, huh? It's almost more than we thought. Plus the other ship. Plus the value of the ships themselves, which you can't even put a price on. We did it! We actually did it! Sully, we didn't do anything. Okay? There is no ""we."" There's only you. Because there's not a person in your life that you wouldn't betray for a piece of this. You made that real clear. I thought that's what we wanted. No, I wanted to do this with my brother Sam, not with you. I know. I'm sorry. But look around, kid. You did this. He'd be proud of you. - It's Braddock. - Shit. We'd better get small. - Or, in your case, smaller. - Hey. You're only like one inch taller than me, max. I think it's a little more than that, kid. Come with me. I know where to go. Magellan's ships. Oh, they're more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. Find the gold. If you see Sully, do not let him open that mouth of his. Kill him and Drake on sight. - Aye. - Be careful, gentlemen. These ships are worth a fortune on their own. You put a hole in my boats, I put a hole in you. - Oh, I'm not going in there. - Hey, look. You could stay up here and get shot in the head or come down here for a quick cuddle... up to you. - I'm going down. - Oh, God. You see anything? All clear, sir. Braddock. We cannae find them. They're nae on board. They must have filled their pockets and fled. Keep an eye out anyway. Sully's a cockroach when it comes to gold. Wind is one-five-zero-one-five-nine. Hold TRQ at 4.2. All right, who's clear? What is it with you and small spaces? Got this thing jamming up my ass. - Wow. - Don't even think about it. Oh, I'm thinking about it. Oh, my God. All right, come on. Oh, Jesus. She's flying the ships out? And us with them. What do you mean, she's flying us out? Victoria, this is Trinidad. Are you ready to receive? Over. Roger that. Victoria standing by. Let's bring her home. You ready up there, Scotty? Aye. Hold TRQ at 4.2. Two degrees south. Geez, Sully, come on. The boat's full of that stuff. Just in case. No. Hey. You want to go show 'em what's what? That's nice. Let me see it for a second. - Yeah, nice, huh? - Yeah, real nice. Hey. Holding steady. You ready for a mutiny? Why not? Whoa! Whoa! Oh, shit. That one's a little more your size. Yeah, cute. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not my gold! Oh, shit. Okay, you go to go hijack that helicopter. Right to the point, huh? All right. You know the drill, right? You don't have to touch it with your finger to use it. Hey, Sully. - Don't crash. - Just what I needed. Positive reinforcement. Thanks. Hey! All hands on deck! Raise the anchor! Hoist the mainsail! Hey, Jack Sparrow, stay sharp. Oh, come on, man, I've been waiting to do this my entire life. Hey, guys. Hey! All right, Victor, you got this. Come on. Easy. Hey, Jo. Follow that ship. Hey, Sully, I think your girlfriend wants her boat back. Yeah, I'm aware. - Try to get the... - Load 'em up! - Go! - Go! Come on. - Clear! - Go! All right, let's see what this shitcan can do. Shite! Hang on, kid. I'm-a get us out of here. Okay. Okay. Gunpowder. Look at that. There we go. Come on, baby. I think that did it. I still got it. Oh, shit. Hey, you still with me? Barely. Yes! You got to do something. They're coming right at us. I think I have an idea. Okay. What's going on?! Sully, will you please just shut up? I'm working on it. Okay. That's your idea? No. Ah, come on! No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Oh, God! Oh, shite! What a shot! Mother Mary! We're home free. You did it, kid. You did it. Yeah, Sully! If I lose, so do you. Hey, Sully, this ain't over. Damn it! What's going on? Come on, we're so close! Ah, shit! No, no, no! No! Damn! Say hi to your brother for me, will you? You first. Sully! Sully, no! Please! Shit. Hey, Braddock! Nate! Come on! Trust me. I got you, kid. I got you. Come on. Look at her. You can't put a price on that. Yeah, you can, actually. Like four to six billion. We could just get a diving rig. Not before those guys. It's property of the Philippines now. Hey. I just wanted to say thank you for what you did for me back there. You know, ever since my brother Sam left... Oh, you... Oh. Can you hear me? - I can now. - I was... I was just saying we should get out of here. You got it. Hey. Is that who I think it is? Bastards. Yeah, I might have let her steal the wrong coordinates. Hey, you're starting to figure it out, kid. Yeah, I learned from the best. You got a heart of gold, Sully. Real funny, wiseass. - What, too soon? - Forever is too soon. Here, maybe this will help. I got you something. Are you kidding me, kid? For real? Yeah, look. I got this... You got to be kidding me. - ...and these. - You got more? - I got loads of it. Look. - Oh. Keep it coming. You'll like this one. Here you go. Here you go. Aw. This means a lot to me. That was my last piece, man. Come on, let's just get out of here. All right, hang on. - You're late. - Sorry about that. Why do you want the map? I'll tell you... if you tell me what Roman wants with my ring. Because he knows it means something special to you. Okay, let's have it. Now... you're gonna tell me what's so important about an old Nazi map. Hey. Put 'em down, boys. Nice and slow. What... What is that thing on your face? Hey, puberty's right around the corner, kid. You can grow your own. You got what you want. And I got what I want. Montecristo. I'm impressed. You're gonna be dead before you can smoke it. Hey, it's always a pleasure doing business with you. And, um... would you look at that? I got friends everywhere, Drake. Oh, yeah? I can't wait to meet 'em. Hey, you were supposed to be here yesterday. Did you know you need special papers to bring an animal on a plane? - I did not know that. - You trying to tell me I almost just bought it because you brought your damn cat? Hey, I go everywhere with Mr. Whiskers, okay? Let me see the map. This is the big one, kid. - You ready? - Yeah. Let's go. Oh, crap., This is Free City. Look at this guy. He's one of the sunglasses people. And the people who wear sunglasses are heroes. They have a devil-may-care attitude and they run this town. You are so hot. Oh, I know. See? That's not even his car. Or his wife. For the sunglasses people, they get to do anything they want. They go on all sorts of missions. They got cool hair, cool clothes. I mean, laws aren't really laws to them. They're more like mild suggestions. Like, I don't think he's gonna return that car. Or that nice lady. See what I mean? Hero. My name is Guy, and I live in paradise. Good morning, Goldie. I've lived here in Free City my whole life. I've got a best friend, I've got a goldfish, and I work at the bank. What more could a guy want? Sunday should be warm and sunny with just a scattering of drive-bys. Great day for the beach, but not Hitman's Beach, which will be mined and sprayed with high-caliber fire from a renegade gunship stolen by... And every morning, I start my day with the most delicious coffee in the whole, wide, whole world. Medium coffee, cream, two sugars. You know it. Mmm. Mmm! That is unexpectedly hot. Jeez, that's good. It's like losing my virginity, but in my mouth. Thank you for making this with such love. You're welcome. Officer Johnny! Have a good one, Guy. Don't have a good day, have a great day! Hold the fudge. You mean to tell me that nobody snabbed up those bad boys? Today is the day. - Like every other day. - I'll be back for those. Oh! So close. Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee of all time. I wanna write a song about it. I wanna dance to that song with my body. I love my life. There's something about finding your lane and just staying in it. That's why they call 'em comfort zones, they're so damn comfortable. Oh, Joe! Mondays, am I right, Joe? - You said it, Guy. - Yeah. In Free City, I have everything I need. Don't have a good day... have a great day. Thank you. Take care. Except one thing. Seem happy. Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy. You gonna find someone. Oh, it's okay, Bud. Feel like I've been looking for her forever, you know? Maybe it's not meant to be. Everybody down on the ground! - I know the woman I'm looking for. - Oh, let me guess. - A woman with an offbeat sense of humor. - Sense of humor. An obsession with feel-good diva pop. Diva pop. Yes, that's her. She's rented space in my brain and she won't move out. And you know what? I don't want her to. Well, guess what? She won't move either in or out. You know why? 'Cause she doesn't exist. - She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy. - That's cruel. You're cruel. - You're being rotten right now. Rotten. - I'm being real. Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon. So how about it? Beers on the beach after work? Of course we're going for beers on the beach after work. That makes me so happy. Me too. What have you got? Proof of a secret level. That's what you're looking for, right? You got a video or a screen grab? Nope. But I know who does. Wanna know what I do to people who waste my time? Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play. Hey, you really British, or is that an accent filter? 'Cause maybe we could meet up later. I don't have a burning desire to see your mum's basement, thanks. Got jokes, huh? Well, I got a map, shows the location of his stash house. Don't know how you'll get in, but if you do, clip 56 might interest you. Now, I got a question. What's so special about this video clip anyway? What's special is I kill people who ask questions about it. Mmm, I see. Fun. Yeah, that's fun. Damn, girl, you're so feisty. But seriously, is it loot or is it just the experience? Those are questions. Did you see the sneakers on that last robber? The 2:30? No, the 4:00. The three-quarter high-top, gorgeous foam soles. I could barely feel it when he stepped on my face. - Oh, man. - Wow. Life in the big city. Ain't nothing like it. Give it to me! Looks like rain. Has anyone seen my cat? You know something, Guy, people say it all the time, like, ""Guy can take a shoe to the face better than anybody I know."" I mean, when you put it on there, you act like it's not a shoe in your face. Don't have a good day, have a great day. Love that song. That's a new one. Hey! That's her. Her who? That's my dream girl, Buddy. She exists. - I'm gonna go talk to her. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses. So? Whatcha mean ""so?"" So, people with sunglasses don't talk to people like us. - You know that! - I gotta try. Look, Guy! Guy! Guy! What about beers on the beach? Excuse me! Hey! Hey! Coming soon... Free City 2! Bigger! Badder! Radder! Free City 2: Carnage. Pre-order today and get the bonus Mayhem Pack. You done? Sorry. Are you closing? Yes. We usually don't put the chairs on the tables, one-small-coffee- over-four-hours girl. You really like that game, huh? My 12-year-old nephew's addicted. Seems like everyone's obsessed with it. Oh, Free City? Ah. No. I, uh, have a lawsuit against the publisher and the evidence that I need is in the game. - So then I had my codes... - Oh... I wish we weren't closing so I could hear more about this. Good morning, Goldie. Medium coffee, cream, two sugars. Medium coffee, cream, two sugars. Actually, I think I'd like to try a cappuccino today. Ooh. ""Cappuccino."" I enjoy saying that. It's like a waterfall made of letters. Excuse me? I'd like to try a cappuccino. - Please. - But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars. That's what you get. That's what everyone gets. Every day. Always. - Well, I... - Somebody's about to get shot. Officer Johnny. I just thought I'd try something different today, you know? Whatever. Right? Yeah? Hi. Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes. Coffee, cream, two sugars, please. I'm joking. Just keeping you on your toes. I was kidding. He was just kidding! Oh, you think I'd deprive myself of your baristic artistry? No way, no how. Mmm. That's hot. It's like Jesus washed my tongue... but right before he finished, he finally told my dad, ""He's good enough."" Thank you so much. Officer Johnny! Have a good one, Guy. Cappuccino. Don't have a good day... ...have a great day, I guess. Okay. Good day to you. Everybody down on the ground! Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon. That's the girl. We've been over this. You tried to talk to her yesterday, it didn't work. It will never work. She's wearing sunglasses. We don't mess with the sunglasses people. Maybe I'll get some sunglasses of my own. What? What are you talking about? You can't do that. Oh, my God. What am I doing? Hi. What'd you say? Hi. I'm gonna need your sunglasses. Ooh. Ow. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna need your sunglasses for a sec. What the hell do you think you're doing? Go back to your side, man. He's just an NPC. Waste that mother... Okay, just need to borrow them for a sec, okay? - Back off! I said, don't! - Just real quick. Real quick. Stop! You broken or somethin'? I'm the robber! You're the guy who lies down and takes it! Please, just stay down! I said, stay down! Guy, you don't do this, man. This isn't you. You don't do this. Maybe I do. What is wrong with this... stupid mission? I told you to smoke his ass. Let go! I'll give them right back. I said... Guy? He's just resting. In pieces! That man is dead! He's so sleepy. I'm just gonna put your gun down... right here... for when you wake. - Okay? - Guy. Guy! Where you goin'? Excuse me. Do you see this? Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday. Whoo! Oh! Giddy up! I feel brand new. Loser. What is happening? So much money. Hey, Mouser, check this out. What's up, Keys? What am I looking at? Okay, so this user, he gets his glasses stolen and then killed. The guy was smoked by a non-playable character. An NPC? That's impossible. Yeah, exactly. Nobody can equip an NPC skin on their avatar. Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass noob and ban him for life, you're done. I tried that, but I... I can't trace him. Whoever it is, they're good. Hmm. You gotta be better at your job, buddy. I'm pretty good. I'll see you on the inside. Select your skin. Hey, Keys, what skin are you going with? The ushe. Dirty stripper cop, big guns, bigger mustache. Hmm. Little dirt squirrel. I like it. Almost scared to ask, but what are you going with? Uh, full body mustache, hot pink. You should be very afraid. I'm terrified. Let's do this. Seriously, man. I'm just being honest, I think the bunny suit is just a little much. Excuse me? Right. Rabbit. Okay? My fault. Hey, 40-year-old virgin! Get over here! Let's go! Uh-huh. Captain Khakis. - Come here. Come on, bud. - Go, let's go. - Closer. - There he is. Blue shirt guy. Blue shirt? Yes. Hello, Officer. Rabbit. Nice skin. Thank you. That's sweet. How'd you get it? Well, uh, mostly genetics, I think. I'm pretty lucky. I have naturally dewy skin. Listen up, Neutrogena. You know you can't go around looking like that. The rules are clear. And another thing. - You can't hack the NPC avatars. - No, sir! - It screws up the mission load... - Screws it up! ...and it makes the game look bad. - Horrible! - Yeah. I got, like, 5% of that. Lose the skin! I... Lose? How am I supposed to get rid of my skin? Take it off, man. Just take it off. What are you doing? - What? - Seriously. - The whole thing. The face, the outfit. - How? - Everything. Ditch it. - Take it off. If you don't, we're gonna kill you. - Why? - And we're gonna keep killing you. Still why? Until we do find out who you are... and then we're gonna ban you for life. Okay. No, no. Okay, I want to comply. I just find the order of those threats very confusing. - Somebody's about to get shot. - Light him up No. Come on, Blue Shirt. Oh! Didn't see that one coming. Did you see that one coming? Scared me a little bit. We're coming for you, Blue Shirt! Coming to get ya. We're coming to get ya. Wait! Wait! I can explain everything. I found these glasses and then I can see things now. Things that... Whoa, whoa. Things that aren't there. Except they are there. I know that sounds crazy, but it's true! You can run, Blue Shirt, but you cannot hide. Come on, Blue Shirt. You can't escape the rabbit. We're apex predators. All we do is bone and brawl and slit throats. Too high! Too high! Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt? Watch this. I tire of these games, Keys. It's time I went god-mode on this beyotch. Okay, bring it. Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go. I'm so, so good at this. Time's up, bank teller! Nope! I can't die! I'm never gonna die! Whoo! And that was the heartbreaking story of Blue Shirt Guy. The end. - Doesn't make sense. - What? I just checked the server stats. We killed Blue Shirt and the number of players online didn't change. It's just a glitch, man. - It's not a big deal. - I know, I know. It just seems like that's something new, you know? Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay? You should not talk to Antwan. I just think it's important to be transparent, okay? Uh-uh. No. Antwan is deep in the sequel launch. He's either not gonna care or he's gonna get pissed and then he's gonna blame us. So, I don't know what you haven't figured out about the whole situation. Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius, indie game designer? What are you doing down here dealing with complaints? That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic story involving failed dreams, desperation, and a mountain of college debt. You do not wanna hear about that. You're absolutely right. That story sounds horrible and boring and full of white privilege. Don't talk to Antwan. We never dreamt this would've happened. I mean, Life Itself, it's essentially a fishbowl game. People aren't playing it, they're watching it grow. It's a strictly observational experience where computer generated characters interact and evolve. I thought we'd be lucky to give it away. That's what's so charming about Keys, he's clueless about his own genius. Uh, no, Millie is the genius. Uh, she built the AI engine from the ground up. So, to get a little personal, what's the thing that gets you up in the morning? Medium coffee, cream, two sugars. What's the other thing? Oh, yeah. An insatiable thirst for validation. - She's not kidding. - I'm not. How about you? - Code. - Code? - Code. - Code, yeah. Here we go. 'Cause it's not just zeros and ones, it's hidden messages. I like to think of myself, actually, as not a code writer, but an author. I just use zeros and ones instead of words 'cause words will let you down. But zeros and ones, never. Zeros and ones are as cool as shit. - He's not kidding. - I'm not. Now, I've gotta ask. There is a lot of chemistry between the two of you. - Has this evolved into more than... - No. - No way. No. It's strictly platonic. - No, no, no. We're friends. - We're like best friends. - Friendship. And now your game is gonna be released by Soonami, one of the biggest publishers in the world. - It's crazy, actually. - It is, yeah. It does seem a little bit like an unlikely pairing, though. Yeah, I didn't totally get it either. But Millie's got a real instinct for these things... Antwan is a genius. He's brash and obnoxious, but he's really good at what he does. It's a chance for our work to be seen by a wider audience. - God, those two were young and dumb. - Jeez. So we're breaking and entering now? How does it feel working for a galactic black hole of frozen shit? You have to leave. I can't talk to you. Aw, shame will have that effect. No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you. I can't even see you. I'm literally focusing on background objects because looking at your lips move violates my NDA and it could get me fired. Aw, fired by Antwan, the guy who stole our work? No, he bought it and then he shelved it. All right? You're living in the past. You are stuck. You gotta move on. How can I move on? How can you? Antwan swiped our AI engine to use in his dumb shooter. Did he, Millie? Because honestly, I'm not so sure. Our game was complex and beautiful and interesting and Free City, it may be popular, but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry. Then stop defending him and help me beat his ass. - Millie, I'm... - Come on, Keys, he stole from us. And now he's lying about it so he doesn't have to give us the credit and the royalties that we deserve. Millie... I found a clue. It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house. All I need from you is to get me in there. Millie, I care about you... but you need to leave. Today is gonna be different, Goldie. What are we lookin' at? Who are you? Okay, okay. Okay. We ran into each other the other day, you were humming that great song. Oh, yeah. I thought you were an NPC. How did you find me? I waited outside by the murder train, then I followed you. Shit! Should I come with you? Yes. Holy hell, what just happened? What just happened is you almost blew my mission. No, I mean, how did we get from there to wherever this is? You mean the portal gun? Portal gun? That sounds expensive. Wow, you are a special kind of noob. Thank you. You too. Turn around. Okay. Oh. Is this the North Pole? Listen, dude. - Guy. - Guy. Whatever. Props on the NPC outfit, but I'm busy trying to figure out how to steal something. Maybe I could help you. I work alone. You have beautiful grenades. Besides, if you want to have any chance of making an impact here, you need to have a higher level than that. - That's tough. No. - No. Higher level? Good Lord, rook. See? - Oh. - That's mine. And that's yours. Oh... What, is one the best or the worst? There is literally nothing lower. Well, how do I get to a higher level? - Really? - Really. - You know, get stuff. - Yeah. - Are you kidding me right now? - Okay. - Experience, guns... - Yeah. - Put that down. - Uh-huh. Money. This is Free City. You could rob a store, carjack someone, punch a pedestrian in the face. You'll figure it out. Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people. Hmm. I've got to admit that is kind of refreshing. Sometimes I forget not everyone you meet on here is a sociopathic man-child. Thank you. Wait. But the world isn't that bad though, is it? Oh! It's pretty bleak. If you ever met the dick responsible for this world, you'd agree. Are we talking about God? You've met God? And he's a dick? His name's Antwan, and yes, he's an absolute troll. Trolls exist? Look, I don't know if anybody does it, but you could rack experience points up by being a good guy. - Like a hero. - Ooh. Easy, tiger. If you don't wanna shoot people, you could steal their guns. All that shit makes your level go up. Go be the good guy. Okay. No, I'm gonna be the great guy. Ooh! Ooh. Okay, well, enjoy your lifetime supply of virginity. Off you go. Okay. Wait! How will I know that I've leveled up enough? - Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk. - Whoa. - Bye now. - That's so much more than one. - It's like 99 more... - Bye now. Okay. Hi. Thanks, Guy. Good morning, Goldie. Good morning, Goldie. Good fucking morning, Goldie. I have three words for you. Blue Shirt Guy. BSG is leveling up and at a record pace by playing the hero. It's got people all over the world asking, ""Just who is this guy?"" I don't know who this guy is, but he's out-skilling all these players. And here he is, taking out Beefoven, a level 102 from Clan Ragnarok. This is bullshit. Who is this guy? I don't know, but he's good. Yeah, he's good. He looks like an NPC but he's running around, leveling up crazy fast by being the freaking good guy. ""This colorful character in the video game Free City ""has been turning heads by being the good guy."" - Piper. - Who is Blue Shirt Guy? You're absolutely right. Blue Shirt Guy. Who is he or she indeed? Whoo-hoo! There's a worldwide craze that has captured kids' hearts-- Blue Shirt Guy! Hello, Hinata. You have a great outfit. Don't have a good day, Have a GREAT day! Crazy awesome!!! Well, well, well. Look who decided to come to work today, huh? Look, where have you been? I've been worried sick about you... What is this shirt? Where's your collar at? Where's the rest of the buttons? And it's not tucked in. You look sloppy. Matter of fact, you look horrible. Did you pick up some muscles, too? Or is somebody outside pumping you up? I'm sorry that I haven't been around, Bud. I've been figuring some stuff out. Whatcha mean, ""figure stuff out""? It is nothing to figure out. Okay? You go to bed, you wake up, you get some coffee, then you come to work. And then you repeat the same thing tomorrow. - The girl. - Oh, my God. I talked to her. I talked to her. - The one with the sunglasses? - The sunglasses, yes! I talked to one of the sunglass people and now I'm one of the sunglass people. Me. Everybody down on the ground! You're so hot. What if I could tell you that you could be more? Your life could be fuller. That you're free to make your own decisions. Your own choices. Yo, dumbass. We are in the middle of something. Uh... - That's my gun. - Quiet time. These puppies changed my life. And they're gonna change yours, too. Come on now, you know we don't wear sunglasses. We do now. Mine now. Are you kidding me? - Put 'em on. - No. Life doesn't have to be something that just happens to us. All right? Just put the glasses on and you're gonna see. You're gonna see. Come on. I can't, okay? I'm sorry. I'm keeping these, asshole mouth. Now get out of here. Go be nicer. Beat it. Go, go, go. Don't walk, run. And you... Ugh. Sorry. Um, you could do so much better than that guy. You could be with, like, a good guy. Or maybe I don't have to be with any guy. Right? Exactly. Most of them are awful. - They really are. - Terrible. Yeah, do whatever you wanna do. You're my best friend, Buddy. And you don't have to be scared. If you change your mind, I'll be around. Yo, Keys, our Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere. I know. Who is this guy? I'm here. I really appreciate this, Keys. Okay. Just to be clear, all I'm doing right now is opening the door. If this clip really does prove that Antwan reused our code illegally, go find it and get out. Player's doing the jewelry store mission in midtown. That gives you 5 minutes. And go. Keys, you're a goddamn genius. Really? I'm sitting on the toilet right now, stealing user codes, so I don't exactly feel like one. Oh, you never have. Good thing I know better. All right. The clip you're looking for should be on the wall to your left. - Thanks for the assist. - You got it. I hope it has the proof you're looking for. Keys! I need your help! He's got that place booby-trapped with spawn points. Millie, I can't help you. Blue Shirt Guy? It's a Henley. Was that cool? It felt really cool. You look really pretty. Wow, this house is so nice. What are you doing here? I was trying to steal a video clip, now we're trying not to die. Who are you talking to? You know, that player in the NPC skin. Millie, there are no other players in that house. That actually hurt my hand. Get down! I'm sorry! Oh, God! We're doing great. Wow! We should definitely go! Oh, shit! - Is that a Glock in your pocket? - No. - What? - It's two Glocks. Oh! I don't suppose this thing can fly. No. Jump. Wow! Whoa! Oh, shit. Good morning, sheeple! Oh, you are fired. There is some concern with the bloody zombies, retailers won't carry the game. Cut it. It's out. Never even happened. Next. It's your lawyers. They need to get your deposition... Speak. Which lawsuit are we talking about? Millie, Millie Rusk? No sweat. That will never see the inside of a courtroom... because she's got no proof and her ex-partner works for me. We're golden. Antwan, hey. You look great. Uh, I thought you were still at Burning Man. Oh, does it look like I'm still at Burning Man? You, you, you... No. So, shut your stupid, bearded face and listen. You heard about the asshole running around in the game who looks like an NPC? Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy. But we're gonna get rid of him. Don't get rid of him. People like him. It's all over social media. No. In fact, know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna use the skin in Free City 2. Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right? 'Roid him out. Make him a hitman or something. Antwan, we're already way behind porting over the skins from Free City 1. Skins? Don't even worry about that. They won't be usable in Free City 2. Antwan, you told the fans... Free City 2 is backwards compatible. It was in the commercial. You said there'd be the same characters in the sequel. Well, here's the thing. When I said that, I was lying. Listen, Antwan, the game is already buggier than ever. I got a stack of user complaints, like a mile high. Look, I know it sucks. But the IP recognition is rock hard. Okay? So don't even worry about it. I'm just saying, we could make an original game. What? Make an original? Why would I do that when I could make a sequel? A sequel. So we can make it better? IPs and sequels, that is the thing that people want. - Let me ask you a question. - Okay. You love Kentucky Fried Chicken, right? - Mmm-hmm. - No. If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken, and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken, and I know that you love Kentucky Fried Chicken, why would I make another restaurant called, uh, I don't know, ""Albuquerque Boiled Turkey""? - Okay? Makes no sense, homie. - Mmm-hmm. No sense. What am I gonna give you? A sequel. Kentucky Fried Chicken-Chicken, Part Two. Uh, yum. Drop the deuce on him. Come on. Come here. Come here. I don't want you to stress that glorious shampoo commercial head of yours about it. Free City 2 is gonna be jumunjious. That's not a word. You sure you don't wanna bump up to programming? I know you got the brains for it. No thanks. I'm good right where I am. Love it. Fear of flying. Can't say I can relate. But all good with me if I don't have to pay you more. Antwan out. Who is this guy? Wow! I took your advice. I leveled up. Impressive. Why are you doing all of this? You know, I guess I felt... trapped. You know, in my life. I just felt so... Stuck. Yeah. And then I saw you. Then I saw you. Who are you? I'm Guy. No, who are you really? Still Guy. All of this, leveling up so fast. Giving this whole world the finger. How are you pulling this off? I've never given anyone any of my fingers. You work at Soonami, don't you? - No. - You've got an inside track. - I work at the bank. - Right. The bank. So, you're just this incredible hacker who happens to work at the bank. Yes, I work at the bank. Where did you get that skin? It's always sort of been there. Why do people keep asking me that question? I don't know, why do they? No, no. Not doing that. I... What's happening right now? I don't know, but I don't buy it. No. - Okay, fine. I'll forget it. - Fine. Good. - I'll let it go. - Yes. Great. We all have our secrets, I guess. Yes, we do. Hey. Do you like ice cream? I can't believe I've never been here. Well, it's sort of a secret. That's why me and my buddy, Buddy, always come here. It's quiet and safe. Yeah, it makes sense. No missions here. Oh, you gotta try this. You're gonna think I'm crazy. This is my favorite flavor in the whole world. We'll take two of the usual, please. You got it, Guy. It's bubble gum flavor. You think I'm crazy, don't you? Guy... Get out of my brain hole! I love bubble gum ice cream. No, you don't. Are you making fun of me right now? No! Nobody likes bubble gum ice cream. No, I do. I had a relationship end over bubble gum ice cream. - No way. Here. - Yeah. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mmm. How good is that? You can taste it? Taste it? It's like my tongue had a baby with a sunrise. - Mmm-hmm? - Mmm. Coffee used to be my favorite food, but compared to this, it tastes like liquid suffering. What? Nothing. You're funny. - I am? - Yeah. Weird funny. But that's kind of my speed. Weird funny, that's totally my speed, too. - Great. - Yeah. I know a joke. A weird funny joke. You wanna hear it? - Please. - Okay. A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair are trying to murder a very small child... - The cripple says to the homosexual... - Whoa. Stop, stop. Stop! Where did you hear that? A robbery. The gunman told it to the driver who thought it was hilarious, so I memorized it and told everyone. Word of advice? Don't crib your jokes from the trolls of Free City. Trolls? Is that a swing set? Holy... Okay, this is too weird. Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice cream, and now swings? - This is too weird. - I thought the same thing, too. I thought the same thing. When I was younger, I was obsessed with swings. Growing up in my family, it was... You don't wanna hear this. No. Oh, I wanna hear everything. Oh. Growing up in my family, it wasn't good enough to be great. You had to win, and that pressure, you know, it was just constant. But when I was in the backyard on that little swing... You know that moment, that split second between rising and falling, when you're totally weightless, it feels like you're free. In love. Free. What you said. Yeah. I really wanna kiss you. Is that weird? You want to kiss me? I wanna kiss you so badly. You want to kiss me badly? - No! - No? No, no, no, no, no. I wanna kiss you well. I mean, I'm an idiot, so I say things like an idiot sometimes. No, you're not. You're not. I mean, um, uh, if you know how to, go for it. I know how. Okay. Here it goes. That was so much better than ice cream. Whoa! I think someone's at the door. I'll say. Well, this was great. - Yeah, it was. - Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah? Yes. Definitely. Maybe in the real world. What? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. Bye. - Okay. Bye, Molotov. Hey... my real name is Millie. My real name continues to be Guy. Millie, open up! Millie, it's me, it's Keys! Open up! Come on! Millie! It's me, open up! - What? - You were right. - You were right. - Oh, come on in. You were right. Our code, it is in Free City and, Millie, it works. Yeah, I know. But we don't have proof. Just forget about that for one second. I'm saying that our game, Life Itself, where characters would grow and change and feel real... - Yeah? - ...worked. - Keys. - The AI worked. It's the reason why Free City is so realistic and people love it so much. And of course it doesn't look the same. There's no waterfalls, there's no butterflies and unicorns, all the characters have different skins. Of course they do. But the underlying code in the game is the same. Our code. And Guy, I mean, he has evolved way further than we thought was even possible. Wait, are you talking about the hacker in the NPC skin? Millie, I'm talking about the fact that Blue Shirt Guy... Yeah? ...is not a player. He is an algorithm who thinks he's alive. I mean, hell, technically, he is alive. He is the first real artificial intelligence. - No! No. - I know. - No, no, no. - Yeah, yeah. - Guy? My Guy? - Guy. - One who has been... - Your Guy? - Holy... - This is a good thing. No, it's really bad. Millie, his code, it's thousands of times the size it should be. We did it, Mills. We did it. Everything that we wanted to create, it actually happened. Okay? Did you know that the NPCs have private lives? One of the baristas learned how to make a cappuccino through trial and error. I mean, that's really difficult. I can't even do that. I can't even froth my own oat milk in the morning. And the Bombshell character in the game wrote a memoir that's a searing indictment of gender roles, the patriarchy... It's a little preachy in parts, but overall, it's pretty good. Millie, we have to celebrate! - No, this can't be happening. - What are you talking about? - This is what we've been working for! - No, I let him kiss me! So, yeah. I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you? Guy. Guy? The first time I kiss a non-toxic guy in like forever and of course he's not even real! Uh, there's not a button for that. Oh, he found the button. - Okay. - Yeah. - I am... I'm so confused. - Why is it so hot? And surprisingly curious. You let an artificially intelligent - video game character kiss you? - Oh, okay, can you just stop saying it like that? And then you thought that would be... Because you have got to meet him, Keys. He's funny, and he's sweet, and he's so handsome. Oh, my God, now I'm saying it out loud. Also, Millie, food for thought, he's like four. - Really? You're gonna do that? - Really. Wow, you just made that really creepy. Millie, put all that aside. Weird or not, when people find out about this, you could win a Nobel Prize. Oh, God. What? Oh, my God, if they see this... - What? What is it? - Oh! Antwan. What else? He's lying. He lied about using our code, he's been lying about the game being backwards compatible. I think he's lying about Free City 1. What are you talking about? Look. You see? There's not one mission, not one location... I mean, there's not even a single character from Free City 1 on here. Free City 2 is not an update... - It's a replacement. - Exactly. So when Free City 2 launches on Monday... Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code, everything will be deleted. He can't do that. I mean, this is artificial life we're dealing with. I mean, that's insane. We're screwed. Maybe not. If we can find our original build in the game, it'll prove that Antwan used our code without properly licensing it. And we just have to find it before Free City 2 launches. We have 48 hours. I've looked, Keys. You know I have. I know you have. But now that we both know about Blue Shirt Guy, maybe he can help? That would mean I'd have to tell him. Millie, he's not gonna exist once the sequel launches. His whole world's about to end. Don't you think he'd want a chance to save it? - Here you go. - Thank you. - You got it. - Guy? Hey! Hi! Guy, we need to talk. What's going on with your voice? Where's your Australian accent? British. I think I know an Australian accent when I see one. I turned off the accent filter. This is me. Good. Look, I have to tell you something really important. Are you married? No. Oh, God. That would have been like the worst thing ever. Maybe not the worst thing. Huh. I have to show you something. Okay. Wow! I always wondered what was in here. Tune in to the Kill Cam for more of today's highlights of every bloody, bullet-ridden corner of Free City. Has anyone seen my cat? Hey, that's Phyllis. She's always losing her cats. And there's Joe! He's my friend, I know that guy. I don't get it. What is this place? There is no easy way to say this, but this city is a game. There's no easy way to say this, I know it's a game. You taught me how to play it. Boop-boop. Yes, you're right, I did. But it's not just that it's like a game. It is a game. It's a video game. And that's all it is. So the entire world is a game? Yes. And we're all just players in the game? Not exactly. I'm a player. All these people here are players. We live in the real world. But you only exist here. It's why you can never leave Free City. You're what we call an NPC. NPC. The policeman and the muscular bunny rabbit, they called me that. What is an NPC? - Let's take... - Just watch. ...another look at that leaderboard. Everybody get down on the ground! Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon. I don't understand. You're a non-player character. - Non... - A background person. Someone designed to make the game more fun for real people. Wait, hold on a second. Just stop for a second. I wanna make sure I'm getting this straight. I just wanna fully understand here. So, I'm fake? The entire world is fake? I'm not even a main character, I'm just this idiot who's in the background? Millie, why are you even saying this? I love you. You only think that because it's in your programming. Guy, I need you to listen to me. In two days, the game is gonna shut down. For good. When this sequel launches, this whole city, you, all the people in it who aren't players, they'll be gone forever. You need to listen. My whole life, I felt like there had to be something more. And then I saw you. And I knew I was right. I was right! And for a second, I felt amazing. - I know. - Except you don't know. Because we're not the same. Isn't that what you said? You said that. We're not the same. You're real. And I'm what? I'm what? You're not. You're not. Well, I may not be real, but for a second there... I felt pretty alive. It's all a lie! Have the quarterly reports on my desk by Friday. Quarterly reports. My, what specific business lingo. Wow. Life in the big city. Ain't nothing like it. Until it crushes your soul. Has anyone seen my cat? Has anyone seen my... Your cats? No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them. But here's a revolutionary idea... close your goddamn door. It's not like they're climbing on top of one another, forming a little kitty tower, and then jimmying the locks. They don't have thumbs, Phyllis. No thumbs! Don't you get it? Don't any of you get it? None of this matters! None of it! It's fake! We don't matter! That building, that's fake! This street... It's fake! That car... Officer Johnny! Have a good one, Guy. Oh, hey, uh... Come in. Here you go. Thank you. Buddy, what would you do if you found out that you weren't real? What do you mean? Pretend with me. Okay, so... Can I pretend I'm a ghost? Sure. Oh. Do I look like how I look like now? Or whenever I die? Like, do I have a funeral outfit on? - This is kind of funeral... - Doesn't matter. ...but even though it's a work uniform, 'cause I got a tie on. Let's move on from the concept, okay? Got it. I'm not a ghost. I'm very disappointed, - but I get it. - Yeah. I'm me, who I am right now, and I'm just trying to help a friend. I say, okay, so what if I'm not real? I'm sorry. ""So what?"" Yeah. So what? But if you're not real, doesn't that mean that nothing you do matters? What does that mean? Look, brother, I am sitting here with my best friend, trying to help him get through a tough time. Right? And even if I'm not real, this moment is. Right here, right now. This moment is real. I mean, what's more real than a person tryin' to help someone they love? Now, if that's not real, I don't know what is. Do you know the other security guards? I know 'em all. Why? Hey, Buddy... let's not have a good day... let's have a great day. Guy, what are we doin' here? We're here to get a video clip for my friend Millie. Does this look intimidating? I don't know, Guy. How do you hold this thing? You have something I want. And you're gonna hand it over. How'd you get in here? Easy. I know your security guard. Jimmy? His name is Luigi. So if you took some time to learn his name... maybe he wouldn't turn on you so quick. I need a video clip, and you're gonna give it to me. Wait a minute, are you... Are you Blue Shirt Guy? Yeah, maybe. Holy shit! You're Guy! You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you! - Yeah. - I love you. - You do? - I mean... I'm like a fan. You're awesome. You can have anything you want. Wait, hold on one second. Gamers, listen up, this is Revenjamin Buttons here. I'm here with Guy. The Guy, he's in my stash house, and he's here to rob me. Can I get a little... - ""what-what"" for my followers, Guy? - What? Perfect. All right, so what's happening is... Guy's looking for a clip... showing a walkthrough I did to get to the secret level. Who are you talking to? I'm sorry. Who am I talking to? It's just such a classic Guy line. Right? You're good. Oh, anyway... And you, you tried to steal it from me with that Molotov chick. Her name's Millie. - Yeah. Wait, who? - Millie. I think it's going really well. I know. This is literally the first time I took my gun out the holster. Totally. Right? Guy, I tried to go back through, but the glitch is patched. And I never found it again. So I'm the only one that ever saw what was on the other side. But it's all here, check it out. It's pretty cool actually. It's like a whole other world. - This is it? This is the game clip? - Yeah, that's it. Can you do one, single, just one solid for me? - One thing, I'll stop asking, okay? - Yeah. Just say my catchphrase. My viewers will just banana cream sandwich all over themselves if you say it. I love banana cream sandwiches. Maybe not this banana cream sandwich. Yeah, this one. Okay, perfect. Okay, so just say, ""You know what time it is?"" - You know what time it is? - You know what time it is? You know what time it is? You know what time it is? You know what time it is? You know what time it is? You know what time it is? It's crime o'clock, baby. Yeah. It's crime o'cl... But, no, I can't say that. That's... Okay. It's all right. I'll say it myself. - All right, you know what time it is? - No. It's crime o'cl... Mom! Mom! Are you serious with the... vacuum right now? You really have to do that here? I'm saying my... catchphrase! Everybody's watching! - God! - You're 22, living in my house, there is no God! Sorry, Guy. Thank you, Mr. Buttons. We're gonna go. No, no, no! No, you gotta kill me. - I'm sorry, what? - You gotta kill me. Please kill me. Give it to me, Daddy. Give it to me! No. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. We're not gonna hurt anybody. I'm a good guy. What? What'd you say? That's deep. No, it's not. That's like I can taste you, deep. I want your help, Buddy. I don't have the safeword. I know what you want. I don't want that. Yeah, you do. That's touching. - They're touching. - Yeah. I know what you want. Yes, I do. You want a little bit of that Free City Itchy Kitty. - No. - Uh-huh. Yes, you do. The way you move, it's almost dirty. What about a little Thanos Glove... into a little bit of Thanos Snap? - Oh. That looked like it hurt. - Yeah, a little bit. A little Sunday Drive. You have a beautiful home. - Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man? - Bye, Mr. Buttons. Come on, give me one snake! Just come on, man. Mom! Do not touch that sock! I swear to God, if you touch that sock... you will be in therapy for the rest of your life! No! That's my special sock! Put it down! Millie, please. Please wake up from your standing coma. Look, I know this world is just a game to you and you can come and go, but to me... this place, these people, that's all I have. And if I can help you save it, I wanna do that... but you gotta wake up, please. Millie, I'm sorry for running away. Guy? Oh, that's so scary! It's just terrifying. I know, I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, you may have started out living in the background, but so did I. We're done with that. I got you a present. I didn't have time to wrap it. What? They say over a billion NPCs are killed every year. Now, I'm not gonna lie, that's at least 50% my fault. I used to shoot all the secondary characters when I was bored, you know? And then, I'd teabag 'em a little bit. Who the hell even knows who this Blue Shirt Guy is? But I'll tell you this, he's got me thinkin' about NPCs and how I play the game. The game wasn't even made for someone like this, for a player to be a good guy. He's also a really cute guy. And not just the face, you know, like the whole thing. And, honestly, it's got me realizing... maybe we've been thinking about NPCs wrong this whole time. I think Blue Shirt Guy's like a symbol, you know? Like, maybe people can be whatever they want. He's like an icon. Is that the right word? Like, he reminds us of what's possible. Also, he's like crazy hot. Oh, my God, totally. I'd hit those pixels hard. We should all be more like Blue Shirt Guy. Maybe we just stop the killing. He's dead! You hear me? The guy, put him up here. Put him up here on the screen. Put him on the screen. Make me see him. There he is. Yes. There he is, the little do-gooder. I thought you liked Blue Shirt. Don't say words to me! People are so busy watching this loser on Twitch and YouTube. You know what they're not doing, guys? Buying Free City 2. - Pre-sales are down 16%. 60. That's bad. Oh, we are 48 hours from launch. Yeah, he's gone viral. Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass and ball cancer at the same time! Inoperable! You know, this whole good guy routine... it is a bad influence, and is bad for the franchise. I want him gone. I don't care who it is, boot him. You can't. Oh, I'm sorry, what? You can't. Why not? Because he's not a hacker, Antwan. He's an NPC. You're tryin' to tell me that all this shit about a self-aware NPC is real? Yeah. I don't know how or why, but he's real. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. What to do? What to do? Got it. And kip-up! So we can't kick him out of the game. How do we reset his AI? Ideas, people. Come on. Hit me. Ideas. You could just reboot the server. Keep talking. If we reboot the server... then he's just gonna revert back to a regular non-player guy. - Solution. - Antwan. Antwan, you're talking about terminating... the first confirmed artificially intelligent life-form right now, okay? Honey, honey. Shush. He's losing me money. So, I don't care if he's Arnold-Frickin'- Schwarzen-Vader. Terminate him. Reboot. - On it. - You can't do that. Reboot! Order up and drown your bloodlust... with a tall glass of murder juice. Here's this week's highlights. He's very expressive with his body. Clearly. What is that? It's a whole new world over there. Some kinda paradise and shit. Oh, my God, that's it. It's our original build and that build is proof our code is in the game. You have no idea how long I've waited for this. I've seen this place. What? Yeah. What do you mean? How could you have possibly seen it? Millie? Millie? We're dark. Free City is offline. What is happening? Bye-bye, Blue Shirt. No, no, no. It's okay. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Good morning, Goldie. Front of warm, dry gunfire... mixed with late afternoon stabbings... could leave you in the streets wet with the blood of innocents... by early Tuesday night. What really is the difference between a light roast and a dark roast? Nobody knows. Don't have a good day, have a great day. Guy, can we talk? How does the sunglass girl know your name? I don't know. Keep walking. Come on, Guy! You know me. You know this. You said this clip showed a place you'd seen before. I need to know where. The data's been erased, but it's in your head. Please try to remember. This is really important. Please, Guy, think. The ice cream, the swings? Oh, my Guy loves swings. At Free City Harbor Park, there's a great swing set there. - Have you been? - Yes. We had bubble gum ice cream. OMG, I love bubble gum ice cream! He loves the bubble gum ice cream. Yes, I know. We had it together, remember? Please, Guy, you're all I've got. I'm sorry, lady. I think you have the wrong guy. Don't have a good day, have a great day. Hello? I might've found something. I've been going through Guy's code and there is something there... even now, after the wipe. What's the point? Guy was, like, a one-in-a-billion miracle. We can't replicate that. I tried, okay? You were right, it's over. No, Millie, Millie, you're not listening to me, all right? A reboot, it doesn't erase his AI coding... you literally would have to destroy the servers to do that. His AI is still there, it just needs to be accessed. I've seen him, Keys. He's forgotten everything. Just look at the trace log I sent you. It'll explain everything. Now, from the beginning... Guy's behavior is much more complex than it should be, thanks to our code. But he's still stuck in Free City. He's still stuck in this life, this loop. And then, something changes. He comes to life. Why? And then I remembered. One of the characters from Life Itself was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn. And he was someone who was designed to never meet the right person. It was essentially the building blocks of the character. But he never stopped hoping that he would meet ""the girl of his dreams."" So I had to base this girl off of someone... and who better than the person that I was sitting next to every day? You. But then, one day... he meets you in Free City, and once he sees you... he can never be the same. He was supposed to feel doomed, but instead, he feels alive... until eventually, he is alive. You changed him, Millie. You changed his code. And I think you can do it again. You brought him to life, Millie. You brought him to life. And he was alive because he met the one person... Don't have a good day... have a great day. Thank you. Take care. Everybody down on the ground! Nobody try to be a hero. This will all be over soon. Okay. Everybody except you. Door, door, door. I got it. Please, I have a goldfish. Look, I don't have long. I just took you hostage, so there are three badges on me. Badges? Is that like a Girl Scout thing? What is that? There is something inside you, Guy. What? I don't want anything inside of me. They stuck you in that bank and... - expected you to just follow the rules... - I love the bank. ...and do the same thing every day. You are so much more than that. I don't wanna be more than that. No, and I need you to remember it. Why have you been following me and how do you know my name? Put these on. I don't have to do anything that I don't wanna do. True. The choice is totally yours. Okay. Okay. Fine. What is that? What are these? Trick glasses or something? Listen carefully. In 24 hours, this world, everyone you know, it's all gonna disappear for good. Can you please just let me go? I mean, I haven't really even seen your face. I mean, I've seen the general area, but I'm not really good with descriptive words. Not really good with words in general. - Screw it. - What? Oh! I remember. Welcome back. No. I remember everything. Come with me. I do this every day so much, I'd forgotten why. Do you see that? Right there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Antwan hid our original build past the horizon, making it invisible... but he forgot to scrub the reflections. It's still out there, Guy. We just can't see it. If we can get there, that is the evidence we need. You can't go past the water line. I tried. We need help. Antwan found a way to hide it in plain sight in the one place no one can even get to. I can't even believe he's smart enough to be this diabolical. Keys, I need you to focus. Okay. So, the reflection shows the build past the southern horizon. But the game physics won't allow you past the beach. But you think you can find a way to get us past the collision mesh? We're gonna need a bridge. You just get to Hitman's Beach and I'll figure out the rest. And, Millie? Be careful. Antwan may be an asshole, but he's not stupid. He'll figure out what you're up to and he'll throw everything he's got at you. You're right. Um, hi, Millie, and other person I can't see... well, I have an idea. What if he has nothing to throw? Everyone! Gather around! Thank you for coming. Now, you know me, I'm Guy. Hi, Guy. Hi. What I'm about to say may be hard to understand. Really hard to understand. But, are you sick of living in the background? Aren't you sick of being shot at? Enough. - Taken hostage? - No more. - Run over? - We done with that. Robbed? Stabbed? Used as a human shield? We are tired of being stabbed! - Buddy! - Sorry. What are you trying to say, Guy? I'm tryin' to say that things in this city don't have to be this way. Things can be different. Different how? - For starters, you can put your arms down. - Yeah. There you go. You got it. Yeah. Keep pushing. There you go. Breathe through it. There you go. Do it. Do it. Do it. No, not gonna happen. Nope. That feels unnatural. I mean, what about when someone runs in with a gun? Having my arms up is just a real time saver. Except, what if the guy with the gun doesn't come? - What? - What? There's always a guy with a gun. So many guys with guns. People, what if our world doesn't have to be so scary? What if we can change it? Millie! How many times a day are the banks robbed in your world? Hardly ever, Guy. What about corpses, Millie? - What? - You see a lot of those? How many an hour? None per hour, Guy. What about gun violence? See a lot of gun violence in your world? Actually, that's a big problem, Guy. It's a massive problem. I didn't see that coming. It's true. It really sucks. The point is, we don't have to be spectators to our own lives. We can be whatever we want. We can't all be you, Guy. That's not true. What's inside of me is inside of you, too. What? It's inside of each and every one of you. You're growing. I need more in my life than drip coffee. I want to make... A cappuccino. A goddamn difference in the world. Much, much better. And a green tea boba. - Holy shit! - That's right! You go, girl. Oh, my God, you're amazing! If I could just make it out past that water... there's a world out there where we can be free. Where we get to decide who we wanna be. Where we can matter. But we have to fight for it. We have to fight together. Yeah! You guys have always done what's expected of you. But that shit ends today. Yeah! I don't even know what's happening right now! But I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it, too! Come on, guys, get in here! Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do! Everyone in! Everybody get down on the ground! Hello? Where the hell is everybody? Hello? Where are all the NPCs? Look, I've been playing Free City for, like, three years now. I've never seen anything like this. Up until recently, I don't even know if I'd have noticed a few NPCs going missing. And I don't know if this is just some whack Reddit theory... but some people are saying that Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player. - That he's actual AI. - AI? Actual AI. You know, alive. It's why Blue Shirt Guy is trending everywhere. Antwan, if you're watching this, please fix the game. - And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt. - Oh, my God. My God! Antwan, you should see this. And you, you tried to steal it from me with that Molotov chick. - Her name's Millie. - Who? Millie. Got her. Got her! Got you! Got you! Mouser! Put him up on the screen. Now. Put him up. That's it. Come on, quicker. Yes, there he is. He's joyriding around Free City with some player called Molotovgirl. AKA Millie Rusk. Millie Rusk? Isn't that Keys' old partner? Yeah. Also the one who's trying to hit me with this bogus lawsuit... 'cause she's desperate for a piece of Soonami Kwan. Boot Molotovgirl now. I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I can, but her account's spoofed. This woman is exceptional. Then kill her in the game. ""What?"" Yes, I said that. Kill her. Throw everything at them, all right? Five badges, G. Yeah, just one problem. We don't have anything. Whatchu talking about, Willis? We don't have any defenses. We don't have police, military, no nothing. It's what I've been trying to tell you. It's like every NPC went on strike. Got a tall, half-caf, double foam oat milk, matcha latte with cinnamon! - That's me. - Hey. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Cheers. Go get 'em, Guy! It's like a digital walkout. No, it's not. They're doing this on purpose, it's part of their plan. You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna kill them in the game. Turn off respawn, kill them dead, now. But that means any players who die will be done for good. They'll freak out. I don't care. Sir? Sir, just to be clear, are you telling me that it's go time? Are you looking for some sort of banter thing 'cause you think we're friends now... and we're in some sort of gang together? Yes. Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for. Cool, we're a team. We should come up - with a catchphrase, okay? - All right. - On three. One, two, three... - One, two, three... Get back to work! Someone find me Keys! All right, people, you heard him. It's go time! Okay, that's not good. He knows where we're going. All right, I got him. I got him. Don't worry. Want some four wheels to the face? Take that. Boom! Rabbit's coming for you. Apex predator. Whoa! Here we go. Y'all watching this? I'm about to end this fool. Come on, come on, come on. Keys, if you're there, a little help, please. God! Okay, who did that? Who is doing that? Don't play with me! Seriously! I'm under way too much pressure! Come on! Go, go, go! I just checked with security. Keys hasn't left the building. Oh, sounds like you've done everything possible. Time to give up? You wanna give up? No, I'm sensing you want me to keep looking. - Go. - I'll be back. I have no idea where these fools are running to. I do. Southern shore. Hitman's Beach. Well, that's stupid. There's nothing out there but water. Game physics won't even let you get past the shoreline. Unless there is something out there. Antwan, is there something there? Screw it. Art nerds. Time for Dude. We're still working on him. I worked on him myself. He's perfect. Drop in Dude now. Just do it. He's got, like, half a brain... he's barely written, but sure, start the upload. What are we supposed to do now? Now Keys finds us a bridge. Come to collect those knives you stabbed in my back, bro? You've been helping Millie Rusk this whole time. She's looking for your build. What build, Antwan? It's not like you used our code anyway, right? And if you didn't use our code... then how can our original build be in the game, right? Or am I missing something? Leave us. Okay, Keys, let's have a real talk. If I'd put out your dumb game, it would have bombed. Antwan, you don't know it would've failed. Yeah, I do know. I looked at the numbers, the tracking, the focus groups. Has it ever occurred to you that some things matter more than numbers? What matters more than numbers? Money? Yo, news flash, bro, money is still numbers. Nothing matters more than numbers! You should be thanking me! I should be thanking you? What about the profits that you got from our work? You chose your side, little Padawan. And now, it's time for you to take your place next to the Emperor. You get me, bro? Yeah, I get you... bro. Which leads me to this. Thanks, Keys. What the hell was that? Hey, Antwan, things are getting hectic. Oh, I thought you were smarter than this, Keys. You're obviously fired, you know that. And you, what is she still doing in the game, man? Boot everyone. Hold up. You want me to boot all the players? Boot them out of the game, now! Cancel every player account! And where the hell is Dude? Security! Kick this punk out. Guy! - Millie! - They're taking me out. What's happening? It's on you now. Everybody's watching. You gotta keep going. Wait, wait, wait! Will I see you again? You will if you make it across that bridge. Show the whole world our build. That's the proof. You do that, Antwan is done. I'll make it. I'll make it. What the hell? What's going on? All right, let's all remember this moment, before we were fired. Oh! Wow. Catchphrase. Catchphrase? What? I haven't had time to think one up yet. Although ""catchphrase"" as a catchphrase is a pretty cool catchphrase. Whoa. Get up, Guy. Get up. Oh, no, no, no. Guy, I came to save you. - Who is this? - I don't know. He's glorious. I mean, he's just like you... but way better. Way, way better. - Thank you. - No, that's not a compliment. I wouldn't touch him if I were you, Buddy. What do you mean you don't think I should touch him? You don't mind this, do you? 'Cause I'm your buddy, too. Yeah, I think he's gonna... hit you. He punches so hard. But yet his hands are so soft. - Be strong. - Okay, bye. Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him. Whee! Ha-ha! Oh... No, no, no! No! Get up, Guy, get up! Playtime's over. Catchphrase. I don't know what that means. Come on, man. Get up! Get up. There are three things I love in life. Kickin' ass, TBD, third thing here. Oof! Oh, shit! Activate death blow. Bye, Guy. Oh, shit, that's a death blow. Get up! Mom, he's coming in with a death blow! Get up, Guy. Oh. What the shit? That was dope. - Hold on. Is that... - That's a... Yes! That's a lightsaber, Dude. Mm-hmm. - Is that a lightsaber? - It is. Oh! Guy! Yes! Yes! That's right. Get up, Guy. Come on. There you go. Do you see them all now? Yeah? - Uh-huh. - Yeah? Yeah, shiny things everywhere. Yeah, there you go. Go get it. Just lots of little snacks. Yeah, not a dancer. No. Run free, better me. Let's go. Where are we going? We can't let them get across that bridge. You wanna finish this out with me? Look, I don't even know what's going on, but hell yes, I'm with you. Ha-ha! Let's go! Antwan, come on, man. What are we doing here? Where are the servers to Free City 1? No. Antwan, what the hell are you doing? If they get past that horizon to the build, I lose everything! Wait, so you did steal their code. Welcome to the conversation, genius. Now, where are those servers? It's all of these, but hold on. I'm trying to wrap my head around this. All these? This one? Right, this one? Yeah. How did you... Run. Antwan! Stop! Officer Johnny! - Come on! - Come on! Which server has the ocean and the rest of the bridge? I'm not gonna tell you. You're just gonna destroy it. Yeah. 'Cause it's my game. Except it's not. It's Keys' game. You didn't do shit. And guess what? Keys is my boy. Security! Please escort this former employee off the premises. He can call you by your real name. Guy! - Buddy! Buddy! - No, no! Keep going! Go without me! I've been scared my whole damn life. But I'm not scared anymore. I'm sorry. I'm not. It's been the best day of my life. You get to that build. You show 'em we matter. That security guard right there was a goddamn hero. You did it! Yes! Yes! Suck it, Antwan! Whoo! Antwan, stop! It's over. He made it. Got your game's original build out there for everyone to see. Probably win your lawsuit, huh? Looks likely. Cool. And here's the thing, bro. Here's the thing. Right here, I got everything you care about. The sliver that's left of Free City, all your little background friends... including your digital boyfriend. Last server. Look, I just want the world that I built and the people in it. What's in it for Antwan? Everything else. Meaning? Pretend I'm dumb. You have the rights to our code, keep all the profits... just give me what's left of Free City. Let me build my own world from there. What about Free City 2? Free City 3? And all pursuant spin-offs? All yours. Just put down the axe. You know that this is, like, the dumbest deal in the history of dumb deals, right? I mean, you're talking about giving up millions of dollars. Why would anyone do that? 'Cause Keys and I made something great. And I don't need money or fame to prove that to myself. I'm done playing your game, Antwan. It's time I played mine. Deal? Popping today and not in a good way. Sales for Free City 2 continue to slip... with numerous reports of bugs in the code and lagging online play. Embattled Soonami game founder Antwan Hovachelik finds himself in the crosshairs. Crosshairs. He's in the crosshairs and embattled. We're too busy to gloat. I'm a victim! I'm a victim! Speaking of busy, we just doubled the amount of unique visitors we can handle. It's amazing. Who'd have thought that so many people... would just wanna watch video game characters instead of shoot at them? Hmm... Oh, yeah, we did. Yeah. You know, you're pretty cute when you brag. Antwan out! Meanwhile, the game Free Life is quickly becoming the little indie that could. Players are swarming to this observational, fishbowl game... where they interact peacefully with the one and only Blue Shirt Guy... and is now no longer in the background, a digital friend. Uh, hey, Mills... Do you wanna come grab a coffee with me? Actually, I'm gonna jump back into the game. - Oh. - Coffee? Okay. Yeah. Sounds good. I'll just, uh, grab you one. Oh, Keys, uh... I know, medium coffee, cream, two sugars. Yeah. Hi, Randy. Milton. Hmm. I was wondering when I'd see you again. Yeah, life has been pretty crazy lately. You should see it in here. We're talkin' free bubble gum ice cream for life. Wow. Hey, guys. Look, Guy... Wow, this is harder than I thought. Then let me do it for you. Guy... you are dreamy. Your taste in blue shirts and five-octave musical superstars... it's deeply, deeply attractive to me. But I can't keep spending all my time with you. I created this world, but I can't live my life in it. See? Was that so hard? So, what are you gonna do? Anything I want. Thanks to you. I'm not stuck in a loop anymore. Neither are you. I love you, Millie. Maybe that is my programming talking, but guess what? Someone wrote that program. I'm just a love letter to you. Somewhere out there is the author. You brought him to life. You brought him to life. And he was alive because he met the one person he'd been waiting for his whole life. And I had to make it realistic, so... I based it off of... you. The woman of his dreams... she was the same as mine. So she liked bubble gum ice cream and swing sets... and she had this very cute but oddly specific habit... of always humming this classic Mariah Carey track. Like, all the time, she would... repeat. Finally! Keys! What are you... You okay, little guy Guy? You seem adjective. I'm great. I'm great. You could put me down, by the way. Thank you. That was nice. No, I'm great. You're great, Dude. I just miss my best friend. We used to do the same walk together every day. Except he wore a shirt. And could complete a full sentence. I can bench press a sentence. Yeah, that's totally not the same thing at all. Harder laughter! Oh... Guy? - Buddy! - No! Oh, my God! Guy! Buddy! I thought I'd lost you! You didn't! One minute, I'm running on a crazy bridge to nowhere... thinkin' my sweet mundane life is over. The next minute, I'm like in some type of flyin'... and some like fairy dust, pixie dust... and then I plopped down into this slice of heaven. Man, I love it here. In fact, a couple of days ago, I rode a centaur. Now, it might sound weird... I took a piggyback ride on a half-dude and a half-horse... whatever a centaur is, I did it. I rode a dude, too! Friendly gesture! So friendly! Come on, bring it in! - Are we gonna hug? - I'm coming for you! - No, you're not. I'm coming for you. - Yes, I am! - You come here! - I'm coming to you! I'm reeling you in. I'm reeling you in. Buddy, I missed you! Hey, so where's the bank? There is no bank. So what do we do? Whatever we want. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Guy. <font color=""#ffff00"">Provided by explosiveskull</font> https://twitter.com/kaboomskull, Hey! We live in a twilight world. We live in a twilight world. And there are no friends at dusk. You've been made. This siege is a blind for them to vanish you. But I established contact. Bring you in or kill you. I have two minutes. Make up your mind. Where's the package? Coat check. Stay. No friends at dusk, huh? You'll do. Get him to the rally point. Swap clothes. The Ukrainians are expecting a passenger. I've never seen encapsulation like this. We don't know how old it is, but it's the real deal. Did you have an out? Service tunnel to the sewer. Take this. Take him. Take his exit. I don't trust ours anymore. Can you defuse that? It's centrally synchronized. Are there more? Covering their tracks. - Taking out the audience? - They're just the cheap seats. That's not our mission. Mine now. Walk away. You don't have to kill these people. That wasn't one of us. I'll take the help. Go, go, go. A man can be trained to hold out for about 18 hours, so your colleagues will be clear by 7:00. He didn't last 18 minutes. He didn't have anything to hide. You were smuggling a nobody. It's risky. Or were you counting on this? Death. CIA issue. Spare yourself, once they clear. Almost 7:00. Uh-oh. It's running fast. We have to put it back one hour. Get it out! Welcome to the afterlife. You've been in a medically-induced coma while we got you out of Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth. The suicide pills are fake. Why? A test. A test? They pulled my teeth out. Did my team get clear? No. Private Russians, we think. Somebody talked. Not you. You chose to die instead of giving up your colleagues. We all believe we'd run into the burning building. But until we feel that heat, we can never know. You do. I resign. You don't work for us. You're dead. Your duty transcends national interests. This is about survival. Whose? Everyone's. There's a cold war, cold as ice. To even know its true nature is to lose. This is knowledge divided. All I have for you is a gesture in combination with a word. ""Tenet."" Use it carefully. It'll open the right doors, but some of the wrong ones, too. That's all they've told you? That test you passed? Not everybody does. With a high-vis vest and a clipboard, you can get almost anywhere. Almost. An obscure tenet. No small talk. Nothing that might reveal who we are or what we do. I thought I was here to find out what we do. You're not here for ""what,"" you're here for ""how."" ""What"" is your department and not my business. Well, to do what I do... I need some idea of the threat we face. As I understand it, we're trying to prevent World War III. Nuclear holocaust? No. Something worse. Aim it and pull the trigger. It's empty. Aim it. Check the magazine. How? One of these bullets is like us, traveling forwards through time. The other one's going backwards. Can you tell which is which? How about now? It's inverted. Its entropy runs backwards. So, to our eyes, its movement is reversed. We think it's a type of inverse radiation triggered by nuclear fission. You didn't make it? No, we don't know how yet. So, where'd it come from? Someone's manufacturing them in the future. They're streaming back at us. Try it. You have to have dropped it. How can it move before I touch it? From your point of view, you caught it. But from the bullet's point of view, you dropped it. But cause comes before effect. No, that's just the way we see time. Well, what about free will? That bullet wouldn't have moved if you hadn't put your hand there. Either way we run the tape, you made it happen. Don't try to understand it. Feel it. Instinct. Got it. Why does it feel so strange? You're not shooting the bullet, you're catching it. Whoa. I've seen this type of ammunition before. In the field? I was almost hit. Then you were exceedingly lucky. An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating. Not pretty. These look like today's. They may have been made today and inverted years from now. Where did you get them? Came with the wall. I was assigned it, like all the material I'm studying here. Do you have an analysis on the metals? Sure. Why? The mixture of alloys can tell me where they might have been made. Look... I'm not seeing Armageddon here. The bullet may not seem like much, but it's a simple machine. Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder. If they can invert that, I see no reason they couldn't invert pretty much anything. Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future. An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well. Now that we know what to look for, we're finding more and more inverted material. Remnants of complex objects. What do you think we're seeing? The detritus of a coming war. - Yep? - We live in a twilight world. No friends at dusk. I was told you left the building. Even the dead need allies. Specifically? I need an assist in Mumbai. I need to get to Sanjay Singh. Singh? He never leaves his house. And his house is... - his house. - Yes, it is. I'm looking right at it. I'll see who's on deck. Bombay Yacht Club in two hours. It seems you need an introduction to a prominent Mumbai local on short notice. I'm Neil. I need an audience with Sanjay Singh. That's not possible. Ten minutes tops. Time isn't the problem. It's getting out alive that's the problem. Would you take a child hostage? A woman? If I had to. I'm not looking to make much noise here. Yes? Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke. What? You never drink on the job. You're well-informed. Well, pays to be in our profession. Well, I prefer soda water. No, you don't. How's your parachuting? I broke an ankle during basic training. Singh's house isn't tall enough to parachute off of. It's bungee-jumpable. I don't think ""bungee-jumpable"" is a word. It may not be a word, but it may be our only way out of that place. Or into it, for that matter. I know you're tired. I'm also very tired. Stay back. I was almost taken out by a very unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine. I want to know who supplied it. My name is Sanjay. And you are? No chitchat? There's no one at the other end. No one who's gonna help you, anyway. Don't let it get cold. Why should I know who supplied it? Combination of metals is unique to India. If it's from India, it's from you. - Fine assumption. - Deduction. Deduction, then. Look, my friend... guns are never conducive to a productive negotiation. I'm not the man they send to negotiate. Or the man they send to make deals. But I am the man people talk to. I can't. I can't tell you. You're an arms dealer, friend. This may be the easiest trigger I've ever had to pull. To say anything about a client would violate the tenets he lives by. If tenets are important to you, then you can tell me. Everything. Not while you have a gun to my husband's head. Sanjay, make a drink for our guest, please. Cheers. - Priya. - Hmm. This is your operation? A masculine front in a man's world has its uses. The dealer you're looking for is Andrei Sator. The Russian oligarch. - You know him? - Not personally. Made his billions in gas. Moved to London. Said to be on the outs with Moscow. Very good. Except the gas he made his billions from was actually plutonium. None of which explains how or why you sold him inverted munitions. When I sold him the rounds, they were perfectly ordinary. So how did he get them inverted? We believe he's functioning as some sort of a broker. Between our time and the future. He can communicate with the future? We all do, don't we? E-mails, credit cards, texts. Anything that goes into the record speaks directly to the future. The question is, can the future speak back? And I'm supposed to find out? To get anywhere near Sator would take a fresh-faced protagonist. And you are fresh as a daisy. Get close. Find out what he's receiving and how. Is it safe to involve British Intelligence? I have a contact who's out of Sator's reach. You must've had a plan for getting out. Not one I love. May I help you, sir? I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch. I presume you mean Sir Michael Crosby's lunch. Presume away. If you'll follow me. Started without you. Hope you don't mind. I'll catch up. Same for me, please. I'll send the waiter. No, just pass on the order. I gather you have an interest in a certain Russian national. Anglo-Russian. So I have to watch my step. Indeed. He's tapped into the intelligence services. I've warned them he's feeding them rubbish... but they don't seem to care. Tell me about him. I assume you're familiar with the Soviet-era secret cities. Closed cities, not shown on maps. Built around sensitive industries. Most of them have been opened up and renamed as regular towns. Not the one Sator grew up in. Stalsk-12. In the '70s, it had a population of about 200,000. Thought to be abandoned. Abandoned? Some kind of accident. After which it was used for underground tests. Two weeks ago, same day as the Kiev opera siege, we spotted a detonation in northern Siberia, just where Stalsk-12 was. Sator emerged from this blank spot on the map with ambition... and enough money to buy his way into the British establishment. Through his wife? Katherine Barton. Oldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton. She works at Shipley's. Met Sator at an auction. A happy marriage? Practically estranged. Well, how do I get to Sator? Well, through her, of course. You may have an inflated idea of my powers of seduction. Hardly. We have an ace in the hole. You're carrying a Goya in a Harrods bag. It's a fake by a Spaniard named Arepo. One of two we've confiscated from an embezzler in Bern. What happened to the other one? It turned up at Shipley's. Authenticated by Katherine Barton. Put on auction. And who do you think bought it? Her husband? Mmm-hmm. Does she know it's a forgery? Oh, it's hard to say. Rumor has it that she and Arepo were close. Uh-huh. Look, no offense, but in this world, when someone is claiming to be a billionaire... Brooks Brothers won't cut it. I'm assuming I'm on a budget. Save the world, then we'll balance the books. Can I recommend a tailor? I'll manage. You British don't have a monopoly on snobbery, you know. Well, not a monopoly. More of a controlling interest. Could you box that up for me? Certainly not. Goodbye, Sir Michael. How can I help, sir? Sorry, I wasn't notified of any appointments, Mr... Goya. Mr. Goya. No. I'm told you're the person to see about Goya. That's extraordinary. What's it worth? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Lots of work to do before any kind of valuation. Provenance, microscopic examination, X-rays. But what does your heart tell you? Sir, where did you say you acquired this drawing? Tomas Arepo. I bought my Goya for cents on a dollar from an irate Swiss banker. Traced it back to Arepo, then realized I scored a bargain when he told me who paid top dollar for another one of his pictures. - Your husband. - Where's your bargain? Your drawing's an obvious fake. My drawing's a very good fake. You know that better than anyone. The information's the bargain. The information that I helped defraud my own husband? He and I are in related businesses, but he's a very hard man to meet. If you and I were to make an arrangement... Arrangement? You mean blackmail. Don't be afraid of the word. My husband isn't. I'm sorry to tell you he got there first. He knows? And he's never done anything about it? Why would he? He paid $9 million for it. Barely cover the cost of the holiday he just forced us on. Where'd you go, Mars? Vietnam, on our yacht. His yacht. You've got the suit. The shoes, the watch. Think you're a little out of your depth. People who've amassed fortunes, like your husband's, generally aren't okay with being cheated out of any of it. The drawing is his hold over me. He threatened me with police. Prison. The works. He controls me. My contact with my son. Everything. Leaving would never have been easy but now it's impossible. You can't fight. Just beg. In Vietnam, I tried to love him again. Thought if there was love there, he might give me my son back. We sat on that bloody boat watching the sunsets, imitating some earlier time in our lives. He seemed happy, so I asked him. And he made me an offer. He'd let me go if I agreed never to see my son again. I expressed myself. I took Max ashore. He called us, contrite. And when we got back, I glimpsed some other woman diving off the boat, and he'd vanished. I never felt such envy. You don't seem the jealous type. Of her freedom. You know how I dream of just diving off that boat? But you share a son. That's my life now. Did you know the drawing was a fake? No. Tomas and I became close, maybe too close. I failed. Andrei can't conceive of failure, only betrayal. But I didn't betray my husband. Retrospect, maybe I missed my chance. And he let Arepo walk free. If you'd actually met Arepo as you claimed, you'd understand he no longer walks anywhere. We spoke on the phone. He can't do that either. - Where's the drawing? - Why? Get me an introduction. I'll take the drawing out of the equation. No picture, no prosecution, no more hold over you. I might just be your second chance. No, I don't need redemption. At betrayal. Friends of your husband's? You knew this was going to happen? Don't worry, they won't kill you. Andrei dislikes tangling with local law enforcement on that level. You must've really not liked the look of me. The look of you's fine. It's best to get to the nasty part before I care one way or the other. There's a number in your left coat pocket. Don't call from home. You won't be taking my call. I might surprise you. I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago. Can we get going? Please? He wants you to see. And he gets what he wants. Not always, apparently. Anna says we're going to Pompeii and see lava. We will. We'll go together. I'll be there, too! Told you I'd surprise you. He's a cute kid. He's everything. Where's the drawing? Oslo. At the airport. The airport? Do you know what a Freeport is? A storage facility for art that was acquired... But not yet taxed. We started a network. Rotas, this construction company, built them. I brought in the clients. The facilities are tax havens. The clients can view their investments without importing them, so they avoid paying tax. It's sorta like a transit lounge for art? Art, antiquities. - Anything of value, really. - Anything? Anything legal. But it's not unlike the Swiss banking system. Opaque. As I'm sure you are aware, most Freeports are just warehouses. But here we ensure that you can actually enjoy... Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport. I'm guessing it's there. And this way to the vaults! - Guessing? - Guessing? We make trips there four, five times a year. - To view art? - And whatever it is he does. Turns out art's of no importance to Andrei. But the Freeports are. The structure of the vaults is based on the Pentagon. Each vault a separate structure within the others. Damage to one structure won't compromise the others. Some of our clients opt for biometric access, straight in... off the tarmac. From the terminal? From their private planes. Of course. Our logistics department ships to and from any other Freeport in the world without customs inspection. What are you hoping to find in there? You really wanna know? I'm not sure. Bring some lead-lined gloves. Jesus. It's nuclear. When you're on the tour, pay attention to the fire precautions. Documents are vulnerable to... Fire? Absolutely! No, I was going to say water damage from the sprinkler systems. We don't use sprinklers. The facility is flooded with halide gas, displacing all the air within seconds. Can you show me? If I did, we'd suffocate. What about the staff? Halide only fills the vaults, they just have to get into either corridor, and there is a 10-second warning. At least you give them 10 seconds. Well, sir, our clients use us because we have no priorities above their property. Blimey. All doors are fireproof. Hydraulic closers, simple key and electronic triggers. Surprisingly easy once there's a lockdown. Why a lockdown? Power switches to fail-safes, sealing the outer doors, but inner doors revert to factory settings. And pickable locks. - Hmm. - It's child's play, really. Child's play? They're inside airport security. They have to worry about climate control, not armed raids. So, how do we get enough firepower through the perimeter to trigger the lockdown procedure? Back wall of the Freeport. You've got something? Not gonna like it. You wanna crash a plane? Well, not from the air. Don't be so dramatic. I want to run a jet off the taxiway and breach the rear wall and start a fire. Well, how big a plane? Well, that part is a little dramatic. This is Mahir. His team'll work the plane. There can't be passengers. Norsk Freight. They use the hangar on the west side of the Freeport. You want to crash a transport plane? What about the crew? We pop the slides, chuck 'em off. On the move? What's the problem? They'll be fine. Well, it seems bold. Bold I'm fine with. I thought you were gonna say nuts. And if you get caught? We won't. And if you do? Everyone assumes terrorism, but no one's died, so swift extradition then lost in the system. It'll barely make the news. Oh, depends on the size of your explosion. Well, actually, the gold bars might get some play. Gold bars? Norsk Freight ships Treasury gold once a month. Blow the back. Drop it out on the runway. No one will be looking at the building. I guarantee you. The space in the center of the pentagon is too big. There's something there. Can't figure it out, it's just not marked. That's 45 seconds. Ample. Won't you be running? All right, it's your turn. Start packing. Gentlemen, if you would, through the detector, please. Sir? Oh. And, sir. I can offer you, perhaps, a coffee, water? No, I'll take an espresso. - Sir? - No, thank you. Excellent. Is everybody on this plane vegetarian? Because all I got here is vegetarian. So that looks like meat, but I think that looks vegetarian. I think they both look vegetarian. I don't really know. It's confusing, ya know? Okay. This way, gentlemen. Gentlemen, your assigned compartment. Carry on. Not the radio. Let's go. Uh... Yoga. Let's go! Now! Go, go, go! Right. Um... You said 10 seconds, right? There's someone in here with us. - Need a hand? - Actually, yes. Don't touch them! The hell happened here? It hasn't happened yet. Don't kill him! We need to know if we've been compromised. Why are you here? Who are you? How'd you know we'd be here? We need to go. What happened to the other guy? Took care of him. Well, I've seen too much. I'm still alive, which must mean you've decided to trust me. Or maybe I lost my edge. Edge is still intact. There's a cold war. Nuclear? Temporal. Time travel? No. Technology that can invert an object's entropy. You mean reverse chronology. Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion that a positron is an electron moving backwards in time? Sure, that's exactly what I meant. I have a master's in physics. Well, try and keep up. The implications of this are... Beyond secret. Then why'd you bring me in? I thought we'd find a drawing and a couple boxes of bullets. Not as surprised as I was. I'm going back to Mumbai to get some answers. I'll set you up as a go-between. But remember, to you... it's all about plutonium. And when we're done, they'll kill you. Won't you have to do that anyway? I'd rather it be my decision. So would I. I think. Your work? What did you find in the vaults? Two antagonists. One inverted. We took out the regular one, but the inverted one got away. Both emerged at the same moment? Yeah. They were the same person. Sator's built a turnstile in that vault. Turnstile? A machine for inverting. You've told me that technology hasn't been invented yet. It hasn't. He's been given it by the future. For what? You have the best chance of finding out. - Have you met him? - I was close. What if you have something he needs? Such as? Plutonium-241. Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev. He got the team. Not the 241. Who did? Ukrainian Security Services. It's moving to Tallinn in a week. Helping an arms dealer steal weapons-grade plutonium is unacceptable, Priya. I'm just gonna take him out. No, no, no. Sator has to stay alive. He has to stay alive until we know his part in things. Leverage the situation, without losing control of the 241. It's too dangerous. A terrorist's bomb, even one that can kill billions, is nothing compared with what will happen if we don't stop Sator. From doing what? We are being attacked by the future. And Sator's helping. You have to find out how. I saw the news from Oslo. Do you have the drawing? You don't have to worry about it anymore. You destroyed it? I didn't think you'd want it back. Does he know? Not yet. So sit tight. Sit tight? Every day my son spends with that monster, he thinks a little less of me. It won't be long. In the meantime, introduce me. As what? I'm a former first secretary from the American Embassy in Riyadh. We met at a party last June. We were at a party in Riyadh, but I don't think it was in June. It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30. Salmon was on the printed menu. Swapped for sea bass on the night. Sator left early. That's when we met. I came into Shipley's in London. You ran into me here and wanna show me your yacht. He'll think we're having an affair. Then he'll wanna meet me. Or have you killed. Let me worry about that. Did I look worried? Sleeps 70 with crew. Two helicopters. Missile defenses. Afraid of pirates? Andrei lives playing one government off the other. The day they turn, that's his refuge. May I join you? Not sure Volkov's taking passengers just now. Then we'll take mine. Max! Who's the American? He's a friend. The man from Shipley's. Who you tried to have beaten up. I ask again, who is he? We met in Riyadh last June at the American Embassy. Good with fists for a diplomat. Paranoia's your department, Andrei. He seems nice. I invited him to the dinner. Max? He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum. You just sent him off? I promised him I'd go with him. I explained you were busy. With your friend. Hey, easy, fella. Where I'm from, you buy me dinner first. - Mr. Sator. - Don't bother. Just tell me if you've slept with my wife yet. Uh... No. Not yet. How would you like to die? Old. You chose the wrong profession. There's a walled garden up the road. We are going to take you there, cut your throat. Not across. In the middle, like a hole. Then we take your balls and we stuff them in the cut, block the windpipe. Complex. It's very gratifying to watch a man you don't like try to pull his own balls out of his throat before he chokes. Is this how you treat all your guests? We're finished. Do you like opera? Well? Not here. You sail? I've messed around on boats. Be on the dock at 8:00 ready to do more than mess around. 8:00 a.m. Max has missed too much school this year. I'm taking him back to England. The school won't be okay with him missing so much of the term. - Yes, they will. - Can I finish? You have all the trappings of a king. We both know you're a grubby little man playing power games with a wife who doesn't love you anymore. You seem... spirited today. - Do I? - Yes, you do. Were you worried it had been destroyed? Rest assured, instinct told me to remove it from the vault. I've always had instincts about the future. That's how I built this life you no longer value. Sailing or diving? Rising! What do you know about opera? In 2008, a remote Russian missile station was overwhelmed and held for a week. When the station was retaken, 241 on one warhead was three quarters of a kilo lighter. The missing 241 surfaced at the opera house siege in Kiev on the 14th. Coming about! What do you propose? Partnership. I wouldn't partner with you. You can take care of yourself. You have no record. Someone in the arms trade, with training, who knows how to cover his tracks. Not that shocking. For an intelligence agent. Right! Burn in hell, Andrei. You can't jibe a boat like this! You can if you have to. - Kat... - Why didn't you let him drown? I need him. What, to sell guns? I'm not who you think I am. Well, that I know. He showed me the drawing. I'm sorry. I had to get close to him. I don't know what you think your husband does... Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer. He's so much more. What, then? Andrei Sator holds all of our lives in his hands, not just yours. Mr. Sator wants to see you. Okay. Now. Uh, he wants to see me without pants? - Trust me. - Save it. I'm not falling for it twice. You have a better option? Whatever it takes to get what you want. Not a second's thought for me or my son. What do you think he's gonna do to me now? Try not to use it. On anyone. Enough. See? Pulse of a man half my age. Drink with me. It seems I now owe you my life. It's nothing. My life is not nothing. And I don't like to be in debt. Then pay me. No retribution against your wife. You think she released my harness? It was my own mistake. Then help me steal the 241. I need resources. It's weapons-grade plutonium. That means special handling, containment facilities... I know what it means. You lecture me about radiation? Andrei Sator, digging plutonium from the rubble of my city as a teenager. Where? Stalsk-12. My home. One part of a warhead exploded at ground level, scattering the others. They needed people to find the plutonium. It became my first contract. Nobody else even bid. They thought it was a death sentence. But... one man's probability of death... ...is another man's possibility for a life. I staked my claim in the new Russia. Even now, my company is the only one to operate in the ruins. The 241 is being transported through northern Europe, on its way to the long-term nuclear storage depot in Trieste. I'm told you have resources in Tallinn. Stay with us tonight. I insist. What do you want? We're going to talk about today. No, we're not. No? We'll see. Don't think for a second you can treat me like you treat your other women. And, uh... how do you imagine... I treat these other women, huh? You think I force them into conversation? You wanna be quiet, fine. You can bite down on that. Even a soul as blank and brittle as yours needs a response. Is fear and pain enough, Andrei? That's all I have to offer you. Well, that will have to do, then. Why didn't you just let me go? Because... if I can't have you... no one else can. And if you touch me, I scream so loud he hears. You think I let him interfere? If he tried, you'd have to kill him. End of deal. So you leave me alone. Not now! Ninety-eight. Not bad for such exertion. He was at the window. I was curious. My property shouldn't concern you. Who are you? How do you come by your information about the opera? You wouldn't do business with someone who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited. Hell, the CIA provides two thirds of the market for fissile material. They're usually buying, not selling. But we do live in a twilight world. Is that Whitman? Pretty. Next warning's a bullet in the brain. No balls in my throat? There will be no time for such things... in Tallinn. You make your way there. I want Volkov on your team. No. I spring the material. You pay me off. Your wife does the exchange. I never involve her in my business. Yeah, that's why I trust her. Put him ashore. How do I contact you? You don't. How do you advance me the funds? Handle the plutonium better than that. What did you find on the gold? No franks, no mold marks. Nothing. - How? - Dead drops. He buries his time capsule, transmits the location, then digs it up to collect the inverted materials they sent. Seemingly instantaneous. Where's he bury it? Some place that won't be discovered for centuries. What did the soil samples show? Northern Europe, Asia. Radioactive. Everything salvaged from Oslo's been shipped here. Why am I here? I don't trust anyone else to assess the pieces. Via convoy through downtown, what's the thinking? Crowded. Unpredictable traffic patterns. It's almost impossible to plan an ambush. They have a point. Is the convoy monitored from the air? Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn, in come the cavalry. We need big guns. Guns that make the point without being fired. We need a fast car that doesn't look fast. Four heavy vehicles. All different. Bus, coach, 18-wheeler. One of them has to be a fire truck. Most of all, we have to set this up with nothing in the record. Nothing electronic, nothing paper. I don't want Sator ambushing us once we spring the material. His ignorance is our only protection. You see, Kat? Some of my favorites. Singed but, uh, salvageable, wouldn't you say? - That's not my area of expertise. - Ah, that's right. You would never have anything to do with such things. But this is where our worlds collide. What is this, Andrei? You know perfectly well what it is, Kat. The filthy business that put those clothes on your back and our boy in his school, that you thought you could negotiate your way around. Time to go. I'm not going anywhere with him. Look at me! And understand, you don't negotiate with a tiger. You admire a tiger until he turns on you and you feel its true fucking nature! Don't. You stay right there. Green. Two minutes. You are not going to kill me. I already tried. You pushed me off a boat. You are not going to shoot me in cold blood. My blood's not cold, Andrei. No, but you're not angry enough. Because anger scars over into despair. I look in your eyes... I see despair. Vengeful bitch! Living off me! Thinking that you're better! Enough! Tell me everything as it happens. Seal me this side. Yellow, 60 seconds. 60. Check. Blue, 45 seconds. Blue, 45, check. Okay, Red. Coming to you. Watch everything. Give me all the details. All right, everyone set? And five... four... three... two... one. Go, Yellow! We got a problem! Backup, we need backup! Shit! Check the radio chatter. I've seen samples of encapsulation in every weapons class. This is not one of them. That's what he's after. Can't understand this. You said you spoke Estonian. It's not Estonian. It's backwards. The hell is that? Go, go, go! Don't give it to him. This isn't plutonium. It's worse than that, God damn it! Sorry. He's getting away. He left her in the car! Go after her, go! Go, go, go! Pull up alongside! Come on, come on. Closer! Keep it steady, keep it steady! Hurry up! Please! All right, sit tight. I'm calling the cavalry. What cavalry? If you are not telling the truth, she dies. I don't know what you're talkin' about. You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right? - Who told you that? - Just tell me now, is it really in the BMW? I don't know. Tell me or I'll shoot her again! Leave her alone! Kill him! I don't have time to negotiate. - Listen to me! - Three. I can help you. - Help me! - Two. Please! - Don't! - One. Next one's a bullet to the head. - No! - One. Two. Three. Okay! Okay. The car. The BMW. I left it in the BMW. We're going to check this is real. It's in the glove box! Where did you leave it? Car or fire truck, which one? Which vehicle did you leave it in? I need to know before I go out there. I already told you. I believe you. You wanted her here, I hope you'll be happy... Clear! Wheeler, go check the other side. You two. Where did he go? The past. It's in the glove box! We're going to check this is real. - Three, two, one. - Okay, okay... Next one's a bullet to the head. - No! No! - One. - Listen to me. - Two. Three. I can help you. I don't have time to negotiate. Tell me or I'll shoot her again. - Leave her alone! - Tell me now, is it really in the BMW? I don't know. You left it in the car, not the fire truck, right? Who told you that? If you're not telling the truth, she dies. I don't know what you're talking about. - Medic! - Check in. She's been shot? Bring her back, this side. Was she shot with an inverted round? This is Ives. He's one of us. ""Us""! Who are these guys? Priya's. Ours. How did Sator know about the ambush? It's posterity. An ambush in the middle of the street can't stay out of the records. Bullshit! He knew every move we made! Every one of 'em. Somebody talked. Who was it? - Was it you? - No. No. At every stage, you've known too much. I'm going to ask you again. Did you talk? Nobody talked. They're running a temporal pincer movement. A what? The pincer movement. But not in space, in time. Half his team moves forward through the event. He monitors them, and then attacks at the end moving backwards, knowing everything. Except for where I stashed the plutonium. Which isn't really plutonium, is it? I told you it was what he was after. And you just told him where it was. I lied. Jesus. You lied about it? He couldn't verify inside the room. He'd have shot her anyway. Lying is standard operating procedure. It's spread too far. Meaning what? She's gonna die. Standard operating procedure. Can't you help her? Can we do something? Can't we stabilize the inverse radiation by inverting the patient? Takes days. Let's go. We took control of this machine minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's. How long is she gonna live on this side? Three hours, tops. I'm taking her through. I'm not gonna let her die. I'll take my chances. There's no way of bringing you back. We find another machine. A week ago? Where? Oslo. That facility's inside an airport security perimeter. It's impregnable. Mmm... It wasn't last week. We're going in. You might as well help us. This is a proving window. As you approach the turnstile, if you don't see yourself in the proving window, do not enter the machine. Why not? If you don't see yourself reverse-exit a machine, then you ain't getting out. - Is that gonna work? - Yeah. See for yourself. There's your answer. Let's go. She's stabilizing slowly. I'll clean and close, but the rest is time. How long does she need? Four, five days. A week to be sure. Hey, Neil. Find a way to get us to Oslo. I'm going back out there. To do what? To stop Sator from getting away with whatever it is I just gave him. You didn't. You lied about where it was. Wait. You're going out there for her. He threatened to kill her in the past. If he does, what happens to her here? That's unknowable. If you're there to make a change, you're not here to observe its effect. What do you believe? What's happened's happened. We need to save her, here and now. If you go back out there, you might hand him exactly what he's after. Don't let them take her back through there. Okay? We can't stay here. We don't have a lot of time. So why don't you find us a nice, cozy shipping container that's just come off a ship from Oslo? This is cowboy shit. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into if you go through that door. Well, I'm going, so any tips would be welcome. Wheeler, brief him. You'll need your own air. Regular air won't pass through the membranes of inverted lungs. Number one rule: don't come into contact with your forward self. It's the whole point of these barriers and protective suits. We don't have time. Well, if your particles come into contact... What? Annihilation. That would be bad, right? When you exit the air lock, take a moment to orient yourself. Things will feel strange. When you run, the wind will be at your back. You encounter fire, ice will form on your clothes as the transfer of heat is reversed. Gravity will feel normal but appear reversed for the world around you. You may experience distortions in your vision and hearing. This is normal. - Can I drive a car? - Cowboy shit. I can't vouch for the handling. Friction and wind resistance are reversed. You are inverted. The world is not. Was the transponder on the case? We've tossed that case. I'm moving backwards. It's the ball I have to follow. Give me the reader. Okay. You ready? The material's not in the case. Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter. He was lying. It wasn't in the BMW. So, where is it? I saw the handoff. You made me shoot her for nothing. You did get my pulse above 130, no one's done that before. Not even my wife. You left Ives and his team a hell of a cleanup. Heat transfer was reversed. You might be the first case of hypothermia from a gasoline explosion in history. At this point, nothing surprises. We're headed back to Oslo? In a Rotas shipping container. He's got the material, Neil. I handed it to him on a plate. I warned you... What's happened's happened. I get it now. But it's hard to take things on trust from people speaking half-truths. That's not fair. You were a part of this before we met. Were you working for Priya? No. Who recruited you, Neil? It can't possibly do you any good to know that right now. When this is over, if we're still standing, and you still care, then you can hear my life story, okay? I'm sorry I involved you. You need to tell me what's going on. Apparently Neil here knows more about it than I do. Good luck, pal. By telling Kat anything, we're compromising her in Priya's eyes. In Priya's eyes, she's already compromised. She has the right to know why she might die. Am I gonna die? Not if we have something to say about it. And we do. Who are you? Let's start with the simple stuff. Every law of physics... The material's not in the case. Get the other sections of the algorithm to the hypocenter. You injured? What's the algorithm, Neil? 241 is one section of it. One out of nine. It's a formula rendered into physical form so it can't be copied or communicated. It's a black box with one function. Which is? Inversion. But not objects or peoples. The world around us. I don't understand. As they invert the entropy of more and more objects, the two directions of time are becoming more intertwined. But because the environment essentially flows in our direction... we dominate. They're always swimming upstream. It's what saved your life. Inverted explosion was pushing against the environment. Pissing in the wind. And the algorithm can change the direction of that wind. It can invert the entropy of the world. And if that happens? Oh... End of play. ""End of play."" Can you be a little more precise? Everyone and everything that's ever lived, destroyed. Instantly. Precise enough? Including my son. The more you sleep, the faster you'll heal. On a truck. Shouldn't be long now. I've been thinking. We're their ancestors. If they destroy us, won't that destroy them? This brings us to the grandfather paradox. The what? If you went back in time and killed your own grandfather, how could you have been born to commit the act? What's the answer? There's no answer. It's a paradox. But in the future, those in power clearly believe that you can kick grandpa down the stairs, gouge his eyes out, slit his throat, without consequence. Could they be right? Doesn't matter. They believe it. So they're willing to destroy us. Can I go back to sleep now? No. I thought of something else. Great. This reversing the flow of time. Doesn't us being here now mean it never happens? That we stop them? Optimistically, I'd say that's right. Pessimistically? In a parallel worlds theory, we can't know the relationship between consciousness and multiple realities. Does your head hurt yet? Yes. Try to sleep. Shit. They didn't take us inside. What do we do? We use the breach. The chaos right after impact. Get ready. She healed enough? I don't know. I've never done this before. The fire crew's there. You take Kat through the breach, I take care of Sator's men and secure the vault. Then you bring her in. How's your arm? Not good. We move as soon as we hear the engines. - Hold on, hold on. - What? You're bleeding. All right, let me take a look at it. Ready? Wait here. I'm going in. Come on! Go, go, go! Go! You knew it was me coming out of that vault. Why didn't you say? That's a lot of explaining when someone's about to put a bullet in their own brain. But afterwards? Thing's the same, I knew you'd be okay. What's happened's happened. If I told you and you acted differently, who knows? The policy is to suppress. Whose policy? Ours, my friend. We're the people saving the world from what might've been. Kat? I'm here. It'll be quite a scar. You'll be okay. Did it. You did what? Andrei has the algorithm. You don't know where he is. Or when. - Get Priya here to Oslo. - Why? If I don't do something, in two days, she tells me about the 241. Nothing can change that. We'll see. Just get her here. Hello, Priya. What's going on? Where's Neil? Nursing Katherine Barton, who almost died because of you. What did I do? It's what you're going to do. In two days, you're gonna have me dangle plutonium-241 in front of the world's most dangerous arms dealer. Now, I wanna know why. You let Sator get hold of 241? No, I let him get ahold of the algorithm. So, tell me about it, Priya. It's... It's unique. The scientist who built it took her own life so she couldn't be forced to make another. A scientist in the future? Generations from now. Why does she have to kill herself? You're familiar with the Manhattan Project? As they approached the first atomic test, Oppenheimer became concerned that the detonation might produce a chain reaction, engulfing the world. They went ahead anyway and got lucky. Think of our scientist as her generation's Oppenheimer. She devises a method for inverting the world, but becomes convinced that by destroying us, they're destroying themselves. The grandfather paradox. But, unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels, splitting the algorithm into nine sections and hiding them the best place she can think of. The past. Here, now. There are nine nuclear powers. Nine bombs. Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world. The best hiding place possible. Nuclear containment facilities. Sator's lifelong mission, financed and guided by the future, has been to find and reassemble the algorithm. Why do they choose him? Because he was at the right place at the right time. The collapse of the Soviet Union. The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons. How many sections does he have? After the 241, all nine. Jesus Christ. And that's why you're going to do things differently this time. To change things? So Katherine won't get hurt? So Sator won't get the algorithm. If that universe can exist... we don't live in it. Well, let's try. You're going to warn me. No, I'm not. Ignorance is our ammunition. Come on. If you had known what the algorithm was, would you have let it fall into Sator's hands? You want Sator to get the last section. That is the only way he'll bring together the other eight. I was supposed to steal it... then lose it? Mission accomplished. You used me. As you used Katherine. Standard operating procedure. You've done your part. My part? I'm the protagonist of this operation. You... are a protagonist. Did you think you were the only one capable of saving the world? No. But I am. Because I haven't told you where he's assembling the algorithm or when. You're about to. No, I'm not. So, deal us in. ""Us""? Why would you want to involve her again? Because she can get close to him. Does he still trust her? He thinks she's dead. But he used to. You have started looking at the world in a new way. And now, it's your turn. Assuming she makes it out alive, whether or not you feel she knows too much. I can't. If you don't have the authority, then talk to whoever's in charge of loose ends. I need your word that she and her son will be safe, Priya. What good is someone's word in our line of business? They'll be safe. There's a rally point offshore at Trondheim. Get yourselves up there. Ives has a team ready to invert. You have a turnstile? The exact technology that we're trying to suppress. Fighting fire with fire's a treacherous business. But there are some people, in the future, who want to continue the algorithm's journey into the past. You see... Tenet wasn't founded in the past. It will be founded in the future. Can't get over the birds. How're you feeling? Tell me you're gonna kill him. I can't. Why not? Bet you've probably killed a lot of people. Not with a dead man's switch. The fitness tracker he wears. He's obsessive about his health. It'll be linked to a switch, probably a simple e-mail burst that reveals the location of the dead drop, set to fire if his heart stops. His death activates the algorithm. He dies, the world ends. No one dares kill him. No, you've missed the point. He's intending to end his life. Why? He's dying. Inoperable pancreatic cancer. And he's taking the world with him. If he can't have her, no one can. He gets to choose the time and place for the end of the world. What moment? What does he choose? You told me about a holiday where you let him feel loved. Vietnam. You said he vanished. What day? I went ashore with Max and he flew off, but I don't know what day it was. It was the 14th. Ten days ago. He was in Ukraine. At the Kiev opera siege. How do you know about that? The point is, he wasn't on his yacht, so that's his window. To go back to that golden moment and have it be his last. Everyone's last. We have to lift the algorithm from the dead drop without Sator knowing. If he believes it's there, he kills himself. And not the rest of us. Where's the dead drop? Knowledge divided, my friend. You're not gonna tell me? Ignorance is our ammunition. But I need you back on that yacht, Kat. Why? You have to stop him killing himself until we know the algorithm is out of the dead drop. But if I'm caught there, my son sees. I don't want those moments to be full of anguish if they're gonna be his last. They're not. It's time. We're working our way back to the 14th, but without knowing where the dead drop is, there's only so much I can do to prepare. You know what a hypocenter is? It's ground zero for an underground nuclear test. Sir Michael Crosby told me about a detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th. The dead drop is at the bottom of the hypocenter. That explosion seals up the algorithm. Well, then we better pull it out of that hole before the bomb goes off, eh? Line it up. Move forward. Next. Line it up. Where's Neil? He must've gone through already. I didn't get to say goodbye. This is goodbye, isn't it? I'd like to say... that you don't have to do this, Kat... Worst thing Andrei ever did to me was that offer he made me. Let me go if I agreed never to see my son again. I shouted and... swore. But he'd seen it on my face, just for an instant. I considered it. I don't know if I hate him more for what he's done, or because he knows that about me. Oh. A chance to help save my child. You can't know what that means to a mother. No. You've killed people you've hated before. It's not usually personal. Well, he's dying anyway. Maybe it doesn't even count. It always counts, Kat. You're not there to kill him, you're the backstop. If we don't lift that algorithm and he kills himself, he takes us all with him. You just keep up your end, okay? Today's the 14th. Offshore of Siberia. Time for us to go. You keep going back another day, give you some time to get back into Vietnam. And who gets me on the yacht? I've got somebody good lined up. When it's over, when you're raising your boy, carry this. There may be a time and place you feel threatened. Hit ""talk,"" state your location, hang up. Who gets the message? Posterity. Stalsk-12. Hidden from the world is a city where anything can happen. And today, ladies and gents, for ten minutes, it most assuredly does. You've been divided into two teams for a temporal pincer movement. We're Red Team, moving forward. In order to distinguish the teams, you'll wear these. Our friends over there, Blue Team, led by Commander Wheeler, are inverted. Why don't they let us see them? Maybe we won't like what happened. One hour from now, they had this briefing. Then, were dropped on the ridge above the hypocenter, as close in time to the detonation as possible. Their objectives were clearance and clarification. Now, this briefing has the benefit of their experience. Both teams have countdown watches. Ours counts down from ten, from landing to zero to the explosion. - Blue Team is reversed. - Everybody, look to your left. If you are not at the LZ at zero, you are not leaving. Do you understand? We drop in, clear LZs for Blue Team evacuation. We make our way into the city proper. These buildings are abandoned, but we learned there is a turnstile. Expect a bitemporal response. They'll have inverse ordnance? Inverse, conventional, forward antagonists, inverted antagonists, they have it all. On the other side of the city, the ground rises to the ridge above the hypocenter. A splinter unit will take this tunnel from the city to the floor of the hypocenter. Blue Team located an entrance here. The bomb is in this rock, high above, to trigger a collapse, sealing the cavern. How do we defuse the bomb up there? We don't. The explosion takes place as planned. Now, our job is to fail to defuse that bomb while the splinter unit achieves its task undetected. Which is? Need-to-know, and you don't. Any other stupid questions? Good. Well, let's go. Let's get ready. I wanted to be on the first wave. There is no first wave. Red Team and Blue Team operate simultaneously. Look, don't get on the chopper if you can't stop thinking in linear terms. Now, you wanna be on the team that lifts the contents of the capsule? Absolutely. Yeah, that's us. We're splinter unit. Just us? No one who knows the contents of that capsule can leave the field. I thought we'd manage ourselves. It's 40 feet from the private deck to the water. Can you jump it? I can dive it. Until you see my signal, you don't let him die. Thirty seconds! Go! Go! Go! We're coming in on a shockwave. Hang on, people. On your feet! There! Ma'am. We thought you'd gone ashore. Well, I snuck back to surprise Andrei. Oh, the boss left. Well, have Mr. Sator find me here. And don't tell the others. I'll get the mess. Mines! Mines! They told me you'd gone ashore. They told me you'd flown off. I came back to see you and Max. Max is on shore with Anna. We need time, just you and me, after what happened. I was joking. It was a stupid joke. You think I'm a terrible mother. We both know my opinion of you is higher than yours of me. I want things to be better, Andrei. Take cover! Get me a goddamn AT4! Take him out, now! Provide some cover! Move, move, move! Let's go! Move, move, move! Wheeler! Get outta there! Come on! Ives! Splinter unit. Here. You know, it's going to be a beautiful sunset. I'll get Max brought back. We should share the moment with him. I'll make you a drink. Bring my son back to the boat. We're runnin' out of time, let's go! If they see us, it's all for nothing. We need a distraction. Don't worry about that. On my mark! RPG, hit the base! That building on my mark! Three! Two! One! Fire! Fire! Move! Move! We're committed now. Come on. What's that? I borrowed it from the CIA. What is it? The way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper. I don't understand. When I take this, it's all over. Then don't take it yet. Why not? Because we have the sunset coming. And a little vodka left. And Max will be here soon. They said they thought it was you, not Anna, ashore with Max. So long as you can tell the difference. A moment's business, my love. Mahir, do you copy? Not clear. I repeat, not clear! Copy that. I repeat, not clear! Neil! Neil! Go! We don't have anything big enough to blow this. Try him. See if he's got a grenade. Anything? Nah, nothing. Here, you try having a look. Can you pick it? I hope not. I paid a lot for that lock. How do you like where my journey began and yours ends? Little radioactive for my taste. My fate was always bound up with radiation. We'd work where no one else would. I made a bargain with the devil. Money for time. We sold our futures. And now you're about to make the same mistake for the entire world. It wasn't a mistake. I made the bargain I could. What was yours? You fight for a cause you barely understand... with people you trust so little, you've told them nothing. When I die, the world dies with me. And your knowledge dies with you, buried in a tomb like an anonymous Egyptian builder sealed in a pyramid to keep his secret. Your faith is blind. You're a fanatic. What's more fanatical than trying to destroy the world? I'm not, I'm creating a new one. Somewhere, sometime, a man in a crystalline tower throws a switch and Armageddon is both triggered and avoided. Now time itself switches direction. The same sunshine we basked in will warm the faces of our descendants generations to come. How could they wanna kill us? Because their oceans rose and their rivers ran dry. Don't you see? They have no choice but to turn back. We're responsible. Knowing this, do you still want me to stop? Yes. Each generation looks out for its own survival. That's exactly what they're doing. But not you. You're a traitor. Bringing death to all, because you have no life of your own left. When I'm done, life continues. Not your son's. My greatest sin was to bring a son into a world I knew was ending. You think God will forgive me? Wait! Wait! God... Cover me! Go! Go! Go! You don't believe in God, or a future, or anything outside of your own experience. The rest is belief. And I don't have it. Without it, you're not human. You're just a madman. Or a god. Of sorts. Like I said. Don't. Jesus. Our time is up. I'll give your love to my wife. You're forgetting. I haven't met her yet. That's right. After you meet her, she dies. I'll just give her my love instead. Don't do... Volkov... Enough business, my love. You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? But it sounds terribly important. Where are you going? Aren't you hot? What are you doing now? I spilled sunscreen. - So what? - Slippery! Just come here. Turn over. You'll like it. I can't do this. - I can't let you think you've won. - Don't spoil this moment, Kat. I'm not letting you go to your grave thinking we're coming with you. You're dying alone, Andrei. Come on, come on, come on! Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed. Mahir, do you copy? Yeah. Hold. I repeat, hold! Look in my eyes. Which do you see? Despair or anger? I'm not the woman who could find love for you even though you scarred her on the inside. I'm the vengeful bitch you scarred on the outside. No! Shit. Ives, she's killed him. Ives, do you copy? She's killed him. She jumped the gun. She killed him. Come on, come on! Do you think they made it? Ah, screw it. Kat! You jumped the gun! I couldn't do it. I couldn't let him die thinking he'd won. I knew you'd find a way. Wait, you found a way, we're okay, right? Yeah, found a way. Be safe. Thought you were inverted. Changed gears halfway. Looked like you needed help here. Here? We needed help down there. How'd you get that lock open? Wasn't me. Didn't your team need you? I'll get 'em on the next pass. All right, Ives? Once I've caught my breath. No one who's seen this leaves the field. All right. We hide it. We end our lives. That's the only way to be sure. As to when... maybe that's every man's decision to make for himself. You're not gonna kill us? If I ever find you, I will. But you won't look too hard? Yes, I will. You're not going back to London to check on Kat, are you? No. It's far too dangerous. Even from afar? Even from afar. Ives! Wait. Are you really going back in? I'm the only one who could've got that door open in time, right, Ives? Well, I don't know any locksmiths as good as you. See? It's me in there, again. Weaving another past in the fabric of this mission. Neil, wait! Just saved the world. Can't leave anything to chance. But can we change things if we do it differently? ""What's happened's happened."" Which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the world. It's not an excuse to do nothing. Fate? Call it what you want. What do you call it? Reality. Now let me go. Hey, you never did tell me who recruited you, Neil. Haven't you guessed by now? You did. Only not when you thought. You have a future in the past. Years ago for me. Years from now for you. You've known me for years? For me, I think this is the end of a beautiful friendship. But for me, it's just the beginning. We get up to some stuff. You're gonna love it. You'll see. This whole operation's a temporal pincer. Whose? Yours! You're only halfway there. I'll see you at the beginning, friend. We're the people saving the world from what might have been. World will never know what could've happened. And even if they did, they wouldn't care. 'Cause no one cares about the bomb that didn't go off. Only the one that did. Do it before the boy comes out. That's your idea of mercy? You gave me your word. And I told you then what it would be worth. Here, today. How did you know? Cannon Place, 3:00. Probably nothing, I'm... Posterity. Cannon Place, 3:00. Probably nothing, I'm... I told you you'd have to start looking differently at the world. - I have to tie up the loose ends. - That was never your job. Then whose was it? Mine. I realized I wasn't working for you. We've both been working for me. I'm the protagonist. Then you'd better tie up those loose ends. Mission accomplished. It's the bomb that didn't go off. The danger no one knew was real. That's the bomb with the real power to change the world. Subtitles by explosiveskull www.OpenSubtitles.org"
