"Good morning, Mr. Kirby. Good morning. - Good morning, A.P. - Good morning. Good morning. - No pictures. - New York Times, Mr. Kirby. We'd like a statement on the business outlook. The newspapers should know that Mr. Kirby never issues any statements. Come on, come on. Let's go up. I got your telegram, Mr. Kirby. They're all waiting in your office. Good. - Hello, A.P. You're looking well. - What can I say? - How was the trip? - Good morning. - Hi, Dad. - I'm glad to get home. Hello, Tony. - How are you? - Good. - How's your mother? - She's fine. That's good, I nearly sent for you. I thought you might like the White House. I'm sorry you didn't. How do you like being a vice president? Painless so far. He still talks as if he were having a tooth yanked. - What happened in Washington? - Yes, what did you find out? A.P., how do we stand? - Get me some bicarbonate of soda. - Yes, sir. How do we stand, A.P.? Well, gentlemen, there'll be no interference from the powers that be. - There won't? That's marvelous. - Are you sure? What about the senator with the anti-trust complex? I said there'd be no interference. We're going ahead exactly as we planned. It'll be the largest individual monopoly in the world, gentlemen, if we're smart. Particularly now that Ramsey is lined up. - Ramsey, too? - That's impossible. No, the administration would never stand for that. Why, we'd control every type of war material. That's exactly it, gentlemen. With the world going crazy, the next big move is munitions. And Kirby and Company are going to cash in on it. It's unbelievable. Why, a war wouldn't be possible anywhere without us. A.P., if I know Ramsey, he'll never let himself be absorbed by anybody. - He won't? - No. Well, we'll see if he will when I hand him a little surprise. I own every inch of the 12 blocks that completely surround the Ramsey factories. - No! - News to us! Well, we certainly didn't know anything about that. So, how is he going to fulfill his contracts without us? Now, you'd better get busy. Complete all your negotiations with the others. I'll handle Ramsey myself. - We'll hop right to it. - Right on. I have a meeting with my nitrate group this afternoon. Good. Ten thousand a year for doctors and I'm still taking this stuff. - Well, son, what do you think about it? - Don't ask me. You know my cockeyed sense of values. Get me that sour-faced real estate agent on the phone. What's his name? - Blakely. - Yeah, yeah. Private line. Dad, how do you feel? Rotten. It's my stomach. Yeah, I thought so. These trips to Washington are getting me jittery. But it's the last one. From now on, they come to me. Say, Tony, do you realize there won't be a bullet, gun or cannon made in this country without us? Dad, now don't tell me you've forgotten the slingshot market. Mr. Blakely on the phone. Hello, Blakely. This is A.P. How's it going? You what? What trouble? Now, wait a minute. Don't bite my head off. I've got all 12 blocks, everything, with the exception of one little lot I can't get the man to sell. Those 12 blocks are absolutely useless to me, unless I get every inch of them. But I'm up against some kind of an old crank. His house isn't worth over $25,000. I've already offered him $50,000, but he's standing pat. If you can't get it with money there's certainly other ways of getting it. Now, that's up to you. Now, remember this, Blakely, unless you buy up the whole 12 blocks, you won't get a penny commission. That man has got ice water in his veins. Well, the description fits only one man. I've simply got to get a hold of that property, Bill. You can't force a man to sell his home, John. I've got to. I'll make him sell if I have to drive him out with stink bombs. Listen, a fortune has been invested in those 12 blocks. And behind it is one of the most powerful men in the country, and a silly old man, with that silly little house is holding up the whole business. - Now, how do you like that? - Excuse me, John, but I think it's great. What did he say when you offered him $50,000 for his place? Well, I'm not sure, but I think someone began singing. Someone else danced and Grandpa Vanderhof sat down and played a mouth organ. Played a mouth organ? - What are they, a bunch of nuts? - Fascinating ones. - It's the old army game. - I doubt it. He's not interested in money. Mr. Vanderhof is here. Have him come in right away. How did you get him to come here? Not interested in money? Miss Jones, just a minute. Don't send him in yet. Have him wait a while. Let him cool his heels. Yes, sir. - He'll just be a minute, Mr. Vanderhof. - Thank you. You imagine that guy wanting me to split commission three ways. - What are you doing? - What? My goodness. I made a mistake. First time in 20 years. That calls for the building to collapse, I suppose? - Have some. - No, thank you. It'll spoil my appetite. What are you doing that for? I have to add up these figures to see if they're right. Why? Why? Because they have to check against these figures. - Do you like this? - Like it? - This work you're doing. - No, my goodness, no. Land's sakes, what am I saying? Well, why do you do it? Look, they're very strict in this office and I... Tell me, isn't there something else you'd rather be doing than this? No. Go along with you. I don't believe a word you're saying. Go on, tell me, what would you rather be doing than this? I make up things. - Poetry? - No. Just things. Go on. Let me see some of them. Say, that's kind of cute. It is, isn't it? I made it up myself. Yes. I have a lot of other ideas just like it. Well, what do you mean fooling around with those dull figures? It seems to me, Mr.... ""Poppins."" Yes. It seems to me, Mr. Poppins, that is the kind of work you ought to be doing. Someday I'm going to do nothing else. Someday, when my ship comes in. How'd you like to come over to our house and work on your gadgets? Over to your house? Well, I don't know. Thank you, but... Go along. You'd love it. Everybody over at our place does just what he wants to do. Really? That must be wonderful. But how would I live? The same way we do. The same way. Well, who takes care of you? The same one that takes care of the lilies of the field, Mr. Poppins. Except that we toy a little, spin a little, have a barrel of fun. If you want to, come on over and become a lily, too. A lily? Me? A lily of the field? What's that? Just a little something Mr. Poppins whipped up. Why, Mr. Poppins. Hey, Ethel, come here. Take a look at this. Alice, George, John. - Isn't that the cutest thing. - Did you do that? How in the world? - Isn't that clever? - Aren't you clever? Where is he, Miss Jones? What's going on here? Well, well, welcome, welcome, Mr. Vanderhof. Come right into my office. - No, thanks, Mr. Blakely. I was just going. - Going? - Hello, Mr. Hughes. - How do you do? What's happened? You were all right last time I saw you. One of my granddaughters dared me to slide down the banister. Too bad, is it serious? No, just a sprain or something. The thing I like most about it is the crutches. I've been wanting to walk on them ever since I was a kid, haven't you? Yes. Yes, yes, must be a lot of fun. Well, Mr. Vanderhof, I believe we understand each other. Now, I'm ready to do business. Say, that's a bad twitch in your eye. You've been working too hard. You ought to take a vacation. Well, if it's all the same to you, Mr. Vanderhof, let's quit playing games. I'm a very busy man. Come... A couple of weeks fishing will fix up that twitch, Mr. Blakely. Well, I've got to go to the graduation exercises over at the university. Look, I have a check here for $100,000. Now, if you're interested... - Have you been to one lately? - No. They're a truckload of fun. You ought to hear the speeches. Well, I'd better be going. I'll be late. Look out for that twitch, Mr. Blakely. Coming, Poppins? I'd like to, but I don't think... I'd better not. - Yes, sir. - This is all your fault. You and your toys. You... Wait a minute, please. If you leave, Poppins, you needn't come back. Wait. Wait, wait. The die is cast. I'm a lily. Have some popcorn. Did your grandpa go to the graduation exercises, Miss Essie? Guess so. I wonder how many folks Grandpa's gonna bring home for dinner tonight. I don't know. It all depends on whether he goes walking in a park. Well, let him bring 'em. I'll be ready for them. Mother, will you taste a Love Dream for me? Not now. I'm busy. Do you have to make candy today, Essie? It's so hot. Well, Ed went out and got a bunch of new orders. How does it taste to you? If this keeps up, you'll be opening a store. That's what Ed was saying last night, but I said no. No. I want to be a dancer. Finish your second act yet, Mrs. Sycamore? No, I've got Cynthia just entering the monastery. I'll be right down, Mr. DePinna. I just want to show my wife these new firecrackers we made. Look, Penny, we can make up a lot of these before the Fourth of July and sell them for 10 cents a string. Watch. Watch, Penny. Nice? Yes, Paul, dear. I tell you, the kids will go for those like hotcakes. Mr. Sycamore, I'm afraid we've got the powder chamber too near the balloon. Let's go down to the cellar and try it. Where's Grandpa? Let's ask Grandpa. I ain't done nothing, but I'm sure tired. Yeah, you always tired. From what? You was born tired. Here, take this, you're just in time enough to set the table. I don't see why I got to do your work just because we're engaged. Donald, were you ever in a monastery? No, I don't go no place much. I'm on relief. Hello, Momma. What do you say, Donald boy? Well, I delivered all the candy. Where's my beautiful wife? Lordy. Here's a new one, Ed. Taste it. - I'm calling it Love Dreams. - Boy, you're a whiz. Wait 'til you listen to this tune. It's been ringing in my ears all day. - Come on back a minute, Essie. - What tune is it? This is sure a beauty. I think you gonna like this hymn. Let me turn the little do-jigger on here. I like that, Ed. Yours? No, Chopin. Got a lot of you in it. What do you say there, Donald? Well, you should have been there. Everybody should have been there. Hello, Grandpa. How's your foot? How's my foot? Is that all I get? Big class this year, Grandpa? How many were there? There must have been two acres. Everybody graduated. The speeches were a lot funnier this year, too. If you want to hear a good speech, you ought to hear Father Divine. Don't you worry. They'll have him there yet. See if this sounds any better to you, Mr. DePinna. Mr. Poppins, excuse me. This is my granddaughter, Essie, and this is her husband, Mr. Carmichael. Hello. What do you say, Mr. Poppins? How do you do? Help yourself to a Love Dream, Mr. Poppins. They're over there on the table. And this is my daughter, Mrs. Sycamore. - This is Mr. Poppins, dear. - How do you do? Have a chair, Mr. Poppins. Were you ever in a monastery? In a monastery? Well, I... What's the matter, Penny? Stuck? Yes, I sort of got myself in a monastery and I can't get out. It'll come to you. Remember how you got out of that jail? That's fine, Ed. Is Alice coming home to dinner? She didn't say. I think she ought to stop working in that millinery shop. They make her stay so late. Penny, she hasn't been there for five months. She hasn't? Isn't that a shame? She was going to get me a hat I liked. She works for bankers now. Bankers? That's wonderful. Essie's dancing teacher wants to borrow $100 on his car. Do you think she could fix it? Sure, Kirby and Company just loaned somebody $80 million. I must speak to Alice about it. Mr. DePinna was right. The powder chamber was too close to the balloon. - Try a Love Dream, Father. - No, thanks. Mr. Poppins, this is Mr. Sycamore, my son-in-law. - How do you do? - How do you do? We're just testing a new skyrocket and Mr. DePinna was saying... Knew it all the time. You can't have that powder chamber so close. Mr. Poppins, Mr. DePinna. - How do you do? - How do you do? Mr. Poppins is going to stay with us a while. Really? How wonderful. Just for a short time. You see... Yes, that's what I thought, that day nine years ago when I delivered the ice. Nine years ago? You were the ice man. Mr. Poppins makes up things. - Really, what sort of things? - You do? Say, that's wonderful. Did you make that all by yourself? That beats all. I have other ideas, too. Better ones. - You have? - Yes. - Let's go down to the shop. - Yes, yes. You have a shop? That's marvelous. Mrs. Penny. Why don't you write a play about ""ism"" mania? ""Ism"" mania? Yes, sure. You know, communism, fascism, voodooism, everybody's got an ""ism"" these days. I thought it was an itch or something. Well, it's just as catching. When things go a little bad nowadays, you go out and get yourself an ""ism,"" and you're in business. I've got it. It might help Cynthia to have an ""ism"" in the monastery. It might at that. Only give her Americanism. Let her know something about Americans. John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams. Washington, Jefferson, Monroe. Lincoln, Grant, Lee, Edison and Mark Twain. When things got tough with those boys, they didn't run around looking for ""isms."" Lincoln said, ""With malice toward none, with charity for all."" Nowadays they say, ""Think the way I do or I'll bomb the daylights out of you."" Why don't you go back to your war play, Mrs. Sycamore? I like that one best. Really, Rheba? Well, maybe I will. Hello. Miss Alice Sycamore, please. You know, every once in a while I get a very strange sensation. I seem to hear a ringing in my ears. Me, too. I thought for a moment it was the telephone. Yeah. I hear voices, too. Voices that say, ""If you don't kiss her soon, you're a chump."" You know, if I were really clever, I could answer the phone without the use of my hands. I saw it done in a circus once. Good. That's wonderful. You'd be a sensation on a trapeze. Mr. Anthony Kirby Junior's office. Now, that's clever the way you say that. Hello, Rheba. No, Rheba. Were you ever in a monastery? Monastery. No, but I'm the fellow that got caught in a cave once. - Really? - Yeah. Whatever happened to you? Well, the cave caved in and I haven't been heard from since. Mrs. Kirby. Hello, Mr. Hammond. I'm just going in to see my son, Tony. Well, he's a very busy man nowadays. I doubt if you can see him. Dinner? Just a minute, Rheba. Wants to know if I will be home for dinner. - No, no, no. - The man says no, Rheba. Tell Grandpa that I love him just as much as ever, but a terrible, young vice president has me in his power. Of course I'm struggling, Rheba. It would do your heart good to see me struggle, Rheba. Hello, Mother. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll visit with your father for a while. - Busy, wasn't he? - Definitely. Goodbye, Rheba. The ceiling just fell in. Would you be so kind as to give me the want ad section of the newspaper? I'm sorry, Alice. Checks to be countersigned, Mr. Kirby. I wouldn't mind his carrying on right in the office, but he's getting serious about her. Why, Miriam, it'll be bigger than steel and can together. Talked to me for hours about her last night. Answer those. - Who? - Tony. Talked to me for hours about his secretary. Told me he was... - Yes? - Mr. Ramsey to see you. Well, I'm too busy. - He says he's in trouble. - I don't care if he is in trouble. Anthony. Yes, yes, about Tony. Well, I'll speak to him. That was Ramsey. Just found out what's up, and is he screaming for help. But in the meantime, what about this girl? No. What sort of a family is she from? - Who? The secretary? - Yes. Not steel or can, or Ramsey, or... All right, all right. Don't get so excited about it. The girl's a stenographer. Boys like Tony don't marry stenographers. Anthony, we've got to do something about this girl. All right, I'll fire her. This isn't a business deal. You can't settle anything by firing the girl. All right, then I won't fire her. Hello. No, no, no, I didn't mean you. - You weren't going out, were you? - Yes. I thought I... We had a date, don't you remember? I'm sorry. I forgot. Yeah, we ought to discuss where to go, don't you think? - Well, I... - Yeah, yeah, we can't just pop out of the building with no place to go. That's a very bad idea that, you know I... I knew two people that did that once. They went out of the building. They were uncertain, so they just walked and walked, and walked and finally they just died of hunger. Now, you wouldn't want anything like that to happen. Because if that happened... You're so beautiful. Sometimes you're so beautiful it just gags me. Maybe you're not real. Maybe you're a phantom or something. I keep expecting you to vanish. Look, you better sit down over here, I think, for a while. Phantoms don't vanish very often in a sitting position. There. Now, wait a minute. Here. Here. Now, let's see. That's a very lovely picture. - Tony, I... - Now, wait a minute. Don't say anything. Now look, phantom. Last night I informed that irate lady that was just in your office a minute ago that I was going to marry you. I don't remember you telling it to me. No, well, you didn't ask me. That's right, I didn't. No, but she did. I talked about you so much that she finally said, ""Well, now the next thing I expect to hear from you ""is that you're gonna marry the girl."" And I said, ""Yeah, that's it exactly."" - What did she say? - Nothing. Nothing. Just fainted dead away? No, no. No, she took it standing up. You know, if you scratch under the surface here you'll find a proposal lying around. I admit it's kind of left-handed. I can't help that. I'm sort of a left-handed guy, you know. Tony. What about them? Mother and Dad? Did you see the way she looked at me? I know just what she was thinking. Now, Alice. Now, listen now. There seems to be the impression around here that the Kirbys are ogres or something. Well, if they are, that doesn't make any difference to me. They're just putty in my hands, Alice. I never in my life wanted anything that I couldn't get if I just yelled loud enough. Worked like a charm when I was a baby, and since then I've had so much practice that I'm terrific. Here, I'll give you a general idea. Tony. There's one little detail I forgot to mention. I love you, Alice. - Hello, Grandpa. - Hey, Grandpa. Yes, I have some Love Dreams. There he is. That's him. The man with the crutches. - You've got to get something on him. - What do you want us to do with him? I don't care what you do with him, just so you make him sell that property, that's all. Hello, Grandpa, how's the foot? Hello, Mac. Fine, thanks. Say, what's the meeting over at Jensen's bakery? They're all excited about having to move out or something. - Move out? - Yes, that's what I've heard. They're coming over to see you now, I guess. Did you hear about it, Grandpa? We maybe all have to move. Who said so? - Maggie just... - Everybody around here is talking about it. Somebody's buying up everything here. I hear they're trying to buy it up for a big factory or something. My landlord told me he wouldn't have sold only they offered him so much money. Nobody wants to move, Grandpa. You know that. - Emil put up some new shelves. Cost $60. - I've been here for 20 years, Grandpa. - I think we ought to see somebody about it. - Now, wait a minute. Don't get excited. We've all been neighbors for a long time. I know that. But if they're buying this property up for a factory, they'll need every foot of ground, won't they? I guess so. Well, now, suppose I won't sell 'em my place. What are they going to do? - That's right, you own your place. - Sure, I do. And they're going to need it, too, won't they? You bet they will, and it'll take more than money to make me sell my property. That's my boy. Go on, get back to work and stop cluttering up the street, or we'll all be arrested. I'm sure we need more displays this year. We've got nothing exciting enough. Mr. Sycamore, if I may suggest, why not the ""Russian Revolution?"" There's plenty of fireworks there. The ""Russian Revolution,"" the clash of the colors, the reds and the whites. Mr. Poppins, you've hit on something brilliant. I don't understand. A letter for me? Must be some mistake. It had your name on it. Where is it? - I don't know. Where's Grandpa's letter? - What, dear? I said, where's that letter that came for Grandpa last week? Last week? I don't know. I remember seeing the kittens with it. Who was it from? Did you notice? The United States Government. Really? I wonder what they wanted. There was one before that that came from the same people. I can't imagine what they'd be writing me for. It seems to me that you could put your printing to some practical use. Wait a minute. I have another idea. That wasn't very loud, was it? We can get it louder than that. What is your idea, Mr. Poppins? - Well, may I tell it? - Yes. Go back to work, Jim. Go on, back to work. Why shouldn't Ed print something about the fireworks and put it in the candy boxes? That would advertise the Revolution, wouldn't it? Say, ""Watch for the Revolution. It's coming soon."" How's that? ""Watch for the Revolution. It's coming soon."" Now I can use my big type. We've got plenty of these Red Flags. You can write about them. The Red Flag will sweep the country. ""Get your Red Flag from Sycamore."" Ed made up a beautiful song today by Chopin. Hello, Miss Alice. Anybody get hurt when the ceiling fell in? Forks on the left, forks on the left Forks on the left, forks on the left Rheba, Rheba forks on the left ""Get your Red Flag from Sycamore."" How's that sound, Alice? Gather 'round, everybody. It's the town crier. - The town crier. - What is it? Gather around, everybody. Where's Grandpa? I have an announcement to make. Well, what is it? A young gentleman is calling for me. Is that all, Alice? Wait a minute. Maybe he's a special young gentleman. You may go to the head of the class, Essie. Well, what's special about him? Has he got horns or something? - Maybe he's handsome like Ed. - I'd better put a tie on. - Where'd you meet him? - Rheba, Rheba, set another place. No. Mother, we're going out. I thought he'd better take you in easy doses. And, Mother, please, don't read any of your plays to him the first time he comes, because, well, I like him. Essie, I wouldn't dance for him if I were you, because we're going to the Monte Carlo Ballet later. Anybody know what time it is? Well, it was 5:00 about two hours ago, wasn't it? Never mind. - Where's Grandpa? - He's upstairs. Incidentally, the young man's name is Tony Kirby. Let me know the minute he comes. - Tony Kirby? Say, that's the boss's son. - Really? Yes, and she told me they've just made him vice president. Isn't that wonderful? We could have the wedding right here in this room. Now, wait a minute, Penny. This is the first time he's called for the girl. Well, you only called for me once. Well, I know, but young folks are different nowadays. I don't know. Look at Ed and me. He came to dinner once and just stayed. That's right. Yeah, and the whole Alabama football team would have stayed, too if you'd had 10 more Essies. How am I doing, Essie? Well, there's a lot of fuss being made about a young man taking you out to dinner. What's so exciting about that? A proposal is exciting. Proposal? Well, that's something very different. Move over there and give me some room. Stop messing with that package. And let's get down to cases. In love? Well, well, I... ""Well, I,"" my foot. Either you are or you aren't. Let me look at your eyes. Yes, of course. Now, come on, tell me all about it. What kind of a boy is he? Do you have fun together? Well, that's no answer to any question. Is he nice? Can't even talk about him, can you? Not rationally. Who's asking you to be rational? Listen, when I was courting your grandmother, it took me two years to propose. You know why? The moment she'd walk into a room, my knees buckled. The blood would rush up into my head and the walls would start to dance. Twice I keeled over in a dead faint. Why, Grandpa. Yeah, she finally dragged it out of me when I was in bed with a 104-fever and in a state of hysteria. The moment she accepted, the fever went down to normal and I hopped out of bed. The case was written up in all the medical journals as the phenomenon of the times. There was nothing phenomenal about it. I just had it bad, that's all. And I never got over it either. No, sir. Right up to the very last, she couldn't walk into a room without my heart going thump, thump, thump. You darling. I wish I'd known her. What was she like? Look in there. This was her room, too. Did you ever notice the peculiar fragrance in here? Yes, but I never knew what it was. It's hers. It's never left here. She hasn't either. I can still hear the tinkle of her thin little voice and see her eyes laughing. That's the reason I've lived in this house so many years and could never move out. It would be like moving out on Grandma. You go on back to that infernal package of yours. Now, wait just a minute. It's for you. - For me? - Yes. Why, bless my soul. It's a new harmonica. - That's for your birthday. - My birthday? How do you know when my birthday is? I don't even know myself. Anytime I get an impulse to buy you a present, that's your birthday. Well, thanks, darling. Grandpa. Grandpa, I hope you like him. Anybody you fall in love with is all right with me, Alice. - You know that. - Thanks, Grandpa. Incidentally, what's his name? Tony Kirby. - Not the son of ""the"" Kirby? - Yes. Pretty snooty outfit, aren't they? Yes, but it's all right. Tony told his mother all about it. It doesn't matter, I'm so happy. I can't think about anything. You go right on being happy. Yes, I think I'll go downstairs and take a whack at this. I wonder where Alice's boyfriend is. - Isn't that the doorbell? - Doorbell's ringing. - Get the doorbell, somebody. - Want me to go? Never mind, everybody. I'm coming. I'll answer it. It's all right, Rheba. I'll go. Grandpa, he's here. Alice's young man. Now, remember what she said. Everybody be nice to him. That's the first time that doorbell's rung since Halloween. Pipe, pipe. - Welcome to our little home. - How do you do? I'm Alice's mother. Come right in. Everybody's dying to know you. Now, here we are. That is Grandpa, and that is Alice's father, Alice's sister and her husband, Ed Carmichael. Let me take your hat and make yourself at home. - I'm afraid there's been some mistake. - How's that? My card. ""Wilbur G. Henderson. Internal Revenue Dept."" Well, for heaven's sake. - I'm looking for Martin Vanderhof. - Right here, sir. Excuse me. I've got some work to do. Mind if I sit down? Sit right down, sir. Sit down. Mr. Vanderhof, the government wants to talk to you about a little matter of income tax. Income tax? Is that Mr. Kirby, Mother? No, dear, it's an internal something or other. Pardon me. Mr. Vanderhof, we've written you several letters about this, but we've received no reply. That's what those letters were. Did you hear that, Penny? This is the party that's been writing to me. Well, it's not me, Mr. Vanderhof. You see, the Internal Revenue Office... - That must be him now. - Doorbell's ringing again. - I heard the doorbell. - Are you all right? Want me to go? Pipe, pipe. - How do you do, Mr. Kirby? Come right in. - Thank you. We've been expecting you. - You are Mr. Kirby, aren't you? - Yes. Well, thank heavens. Here he is. This is really Mr. Kirby. This is Alice's father, her grandfather, her sister Essie, Essie's husband. Won't you sit down, Mr. Kirby? Yes. - Mother, is that Mr. Kirby, Mother? - Yes, dear. He's lovely. I'll be right down. - She'll be right down. - Well, thank you very much. Well... - Do y'all play football? - A little, yeah. Gosh, you're... You're awful young to be a vice president. Well, you know what that means, vice president... All I have is just an office with my name on the door. Is that all? I have a secretary. A very lovely secretary, too. Isn't that sweet, Ed? How about salary? Don't you get any salary? A little. More than I'm worth, I'm afraid. I beg your pardon. Well, I suppose you're ready to settle down and get married now? Come now, Penny. I'm sure Mr. Kirby knows his own mind. You mustn't rush him, Mother. All I meant was, he's bound to get married, and suppose the wrong girl gets him. Mr. Vanderhof, I've got to be going. Too bad. I'm sorry you can't stay to dinner. Drop in again. If you don't mind, I'd like to settle my business before I go. He's selling something for the government. What can I do for you? Mr. Vanderhof, our records show that you've never paid any income tax. - That's right. - Why not? I don't believe in it. You don't believe in it? Mr. Sycamore, I can't get these things to go off. Look. Not now, Mr. DePinna. No, no. Not now, Mr. DePinna. Grandpa's busy. - Mr. Kirby. Mr. DePinna. - How do you do, sir? Mr. Kirby, of course. Didn't I read something about your father? He was indicted or something, wasn't he? No, he just testified before the Securities Commission. - I thought the cops had got him. - No. Come along, Mr. DePinna. Come on. Now see here, Mr. Vanderhof. Whether you believe it or not, you owe the government 22 years back income taxes. Hey, wait a minute, mister. That's too far back. That's outlawed, ain't it? - What's your name? - What difference does that make? - Did you ever file an income tax return? - No, sir. What was your income last year? - I don't know, about $85, wasn't it, Essie? - I don't know. Well... Now, Mr. Vanderhof, that's a very serious thing, not filing an income tax return. Now, suppose I do pay you this money. Mind you, I don't say that I'm going to, but just for the sake of argument, what's the government going to do with it? - What do you mean? - Well, what do I get for my money? For instance, if I go into a department store and buy something, why, there it is. I can see it. But what are they going to give me? The government gives you everything. It protects you. From what? Well, invasion. How do you think the government's gonna keep up the Army and Navy - with all those battleships? - Battleships? Last time we used battleships was in the Spanish-American War and what did we get out of that? Cuba. And we gave that back. Why, I wouldn't mind paying for something sensible. Something sensible. What about Congress and the Supreme Court and the President? We've got to pay them, don't we? Not with my money, no, sir. Now... Now, wait a minute. I didn't come here to argue with you. Hello, everybody. - Hello, Tony. - Hello, Alice. - Is everybody acquainted with everybody? - Yes, indeed. We've had a most delightful talk about love and marriage. - I'm sorry. I tried to hurry. - No, come on, wait. Look, Mr. Vanderhof. All I know is you haven't paid an income tax, and you've got to pay it. What was that? I said you've got to pay it. Well, you've got to show me. We don't have to show you. I just told you. Who's going to pay for all those buildings down in Washington and interstate commerce and the Constitution? The Constitution has been paid for years ago. And as for interstate commerce... What is interstate commerce anyway? There are 48 states, see? And if it weren't for interstate commerce, nothing could go from one state to another. See? Well, why not? Have they got fences? No, they haven't got fences. They've got laws. Holy smokes, I never ran across anything like this before. Well, I might pay you about $75, but it isn't worth a cent more. You'll pay every cent just like anybody else. Now, listen to me. You'll go to jail if you don't pay, do you hear that? That's law. If you think you're bigger than the law, you've got another thing coming. You're just the same as anybody else. And the sooner you get that through your head, the better. Holy smokes! My father makes fireworks in the cellar. - How did that sound to you? - Pretty good. Thanks. Well, I guess we'd better be going, Tony. - Say, he was pretty mad, wasn't he? - He certainly was. That might get you into an awful lot of trouble, Mr. Vanderhof. No, not me. I was only having fun with him. I don't owe the government a cent. - Well, we're going. Good night, everybody. - Good night. Hello, everybody. Hello, Kolenkhov. You know, never have I seen you look more magnificent. Thank you. Mr. Kirby, this is Mr. Kolenkhov, Essie's dancing teacher. - How do you do, sir? - I do not know you, - but you are a very lucky man. - Thank you. I practiced today, Mr. Kolenkhov. My Pavlova. Grandpa, I am in time for dinner, no? You are in time for dinner, yes. Well, goodbye, Mr. Kolenkhov. We're going to the Monte Carlo Ballet. The Monte Carlo Ballet? It stinks. Yes? Well... - Well, good night, everybody. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Bye. The Monte Carlo Ballet. Dinner's ready. My little Rheba, what would I do without my angel? Only three shirts this time, but they must be washed by your beautiful little hands. And would you sew on two little buttons on one of them? Monte Carlo Ballet. Sergei Diaghilev. Then you have ballet. Quiet, please. Quiet. Well, sir. Here we are again. We've been getting on pretty good for quite a while now. We're certainly much obliged. Looks like Alice is going to get married, and I think she'll be very happy, because we just met the boy you sent her and he looks fine. Remember, all we ask is just to go along the way we are and keep our health. As far as anything else is concerned, we leave that up to you. Thank you. Well, Kolenkhov, did you bring me any Russian stamps? No. Nobody writes to me. They're all dead. I was just thinking about that family of yours. Living with them must be like living in a world that Walt Disney might have thought of. Everybody does just as he pleases, doesn't he? Yes, Grandpa started it. He just suddenly left business one day. He started up in the elevator, turned 'round, came right down again and never went back. He could have been a rich man, but he said he wasn't having any fun. That's wonderful. Then he started collecting stamps, because that's what he liked best. You know, he gets paid just to appraise collections. - He's an expert. - That's marvelous. My dad, he makes fireworks because, well, because he never grew up, I guess. And, Mother. Do you know why Mother writes plays? Probably likes literature and good books. No, because eight years ago, a typewriter was delivered to the house by mistake. No... If it had been a plow, she'd have taken up farming? I'm sure of it, if she'd liked it. This is making conversation, but weren't we supposed to go to the ballet? Yes. Well, let's see. Yes, second seat over, miss. I can talk and I can listen, or I can just sit. What will you have? Well, I think I'd like to have this first. Well, Mr. Moody, what are you thinking about? Me? No... That family of yours. Boy, they knocked me for a loop. I don't know. It just seems like, in their own way, they've found what everybody's looking for. People spend their whole lives building castles in the air and then nothing ever comes of them. Wonder why that is? Well, it takes courage. Everybody's afraid to live. You know? You ought to hear Grandpa on that subject. You know, he says most people nowadays are run by fear, fear of what they eat, fear of what they drink, fear of their jobs, their future, fear of their health. They're scared to save money, and scared to spend it. - You know what his pet aversion is? - What? That people who commercialize on fear, you know, they scare you to death so they can sell you something you don't need. Yeah, I agree with him. So he kind of taught all of us not to be afraid of anything and to do what we want to do, and, well, it's kind of fun, anyway. Yeah, well that's it, but that takes courage. Especially that do-what-you-want-to-do department. I remember in college, another guy and I had an idea to... Mind if I talk about myself? If you don't, I will. Well, this guy and I had this idea. We wanted to find out what made the grass grow green. Now, that sounds silly and everything, but that's the biggest research problem in the world today. And I'll tell you why. Because there's a tiny little engine in the green of this grass and in the green of the trees that has the mysterious gift of being able to take energy from the rays of the sun and store it up. You see, that's how the heat, and power in coal, and oil, and wood, is stored up. Well, we thought if we could find the secret of all those millions of little engines in this green stuff, we can make big ones, and then we could take all the power we could ever need right from the sun's rays. You see? - That's wonderful. I never knew that. - Yeah, yeah. We worked on it and worked day and night. We got so excited we forgot to sleep. If we'd make just one little discovery, we'd walk on air for days. Yeah, then what? Well, then we left school. And now he's selling automobiles and I'm in some strange thing called banking. I saw him a couple of weeks ago. Poor guy. Bob Smith is his name. Got all excited again, wanted to talk about nothing else. And? Well, he's married, and his wife just had a baby. Didn't think it was fair to gamble with the future. Anyway, that's his excuse for lack of courage. Don't say it. What's my excuse? Well, the Kirbys have been bankers for 9,000 years or something. And that line just can't be broken. Now, that's been pounded into my head until I have softening of the brain. That's my excuse. Tony, that's kind of silly, you're pretty young to... Besides, I resent what you said about your brain. I think it's beautiful. You do? You don't say. That's probably the first thing you noticed about me, that you liked my colossal brain. Well, no. No, it was the back of your head. - Back of my head? - Yes. - Nothing but a big bump back there. - The shape of it. Well, what happened when I turned around? Well, I figured I'd just have to get used to that. You figured? I figured it might not take very long, but I figured I'd just... - You just figured that you'd get used to it? - Yes. - I'm glad you figured. - Yes. What do you say, mister? Want to learn to do the Big Apple? - That's against the law, you know? - So is necking. - How much is it? - Ten cents. Wouldn't do it for a nickel, would you? I get it. Can you do the Big Apple? - No, can you? - No. All right. I'll take a chance. There you are. What do we do? You just watch them. It's a lead pipe cinch. Okay, Red. You and Snoopy. Make it hot. Let her go. You just watch them. Yeah. Okay. Dorothy, you take this man. - Come on, wiggle. - Wiggle? Point your toe. - Which toe? - That one. Come on, wiggle! It's no good unless you wiggle. That's right. Wiggle. - Swell. - Swell. The winner. - Come on. - Take it easy, Alice. - You ready? - Ready. - You all set now? And... - Yep. Shuffle, and shuffle, and move around. Break, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Step, kick, step, kick, one, two, three... Come on, sister, loosen up. You're too stiff. Yeah, Alice. Loosen up. That's it. Very good. The new champion. All right. Grab your partners. Wonder whatever happened to Astaire and Rogers. Jiggers, the cops. Some swank. I've never been here before. Good evening, Mr. Kirby. Good evening. Say, we seem to be attracting a little attention. No. It isn't you they are watching. It's Lord Melville. - Lord Melville? - Yes. - Where is he? - At your table with your father. Now, Tony, don't ask me to go over there because I won't. - No, no, no, Alice. It will be all right. - No, I... I want you to meet a four-star blueblood. Come on. Good evening. - Hello, Mother. - Hello, Tony. - No, please. Please sit down. - Please be seated. My son, Tony, and Miss... - Alice... - Sycamore, Sycamore. Alice Sycamore. Sycamore, of course. I never could remember names. Lord and Lady Melville. - How do you do? How are you? - How do you do, sir? Governor Leach and Mrs. Leach. - How do you do? - Glad to know you. How do you do? Nice party. - A couple of chairs, please. - No, just a table for two. - Yes, sir. - Just want a table for two. What do you have there, sir? A new game? No, no. I was just seeing how far I could trace my family tree. For some reason your mother was interested. I thought all that family tree stuff went out with the buffalo. - Good. - How can you be so absurd, Tony. Why, America is more and more conscious of its background. It cost me $5,000 last year to trace my family tree. Really? And you, Miss Sycamore. Have you a family tree? - Me? - Yes. Why... Why... My dear sir, don't you know that a sycamore is a tree? No comment. Good night. Good night. Good night. Boy, there are going to be some questions asked about my family, and their tree. - I can just feel it. - Good, I know all the answers. You know, if we're honest now, we're gonna save ourselves a lot of embarrassment later. Tony, I want you to invite them to my house. So that's what has been on your mind? Give them an opportunity to meet everybody, and then they'll know us. All right. I think I can arrange that. Let's see now, I can put each member of your family in a separate cage and then put tags on them and the Kirbys can parade up and down like this. Tony. Well, do you think I'm going to put you on exhibition like a circus? - I don't mind. - Well, I do. I'm just not going to bother. We've got to. To them, I'll always be just a stenographer who... Look at your mother. She's still staring at me. Well, who wouldn't stare at you? Tony, promise you'll do it. You know, every time I think how lucky I am, I feel like screaming. Tony, please promise you'll invite them. I feel a scream coming on right now. You know, we'll have to face it sooner or later. It's starting right now in my toes. Sort of a tingling sensation. - We can invite them for Wednesday. - It's creeping up around my knees. It's going up my legs. Traveling faster and faster. - You're not really going to scream. - It's in my stomach right now. - I'm afraid it's got me, Alice. - Not with your mother here, Tony. - Now it's going up. It's all over my body now. - Please don't. No. It's in my throat now. What can I do? It's fighting to get out. I can't hold it any longer. Here it goes. No! - What happened? - What happened? - A mouse went right past there. - A mouse? In this place? A mouse. What do you mean a mouse? - It was a rat that long with hair on it. - A rat with hair on it? Yeah, about six of them. Weren't there six or seven of them? - Where? Where? - Where? Where? Where? Right under that table. There they go! Mr. Kirby, I'm terribly sorry, terribly sorry. - Yes, Henri. Buy yourself some mousetraps. - Thank you. Are you ready, Anthony? Are you serious about taking me on this slumming tour? The more we fight him, the more he'll resist. It's the only thing to do. Pretend, at least, that we are willing to be reasonable. She's probably from some dull, middle-class family. As soon as Tony sees us all together, he'll quickly realize how impossible the situation is. Yeah. That, I take it, is what is known as being subtle. Yes. Come here a minute, Donald. Donald, look and see if you can see a man standing in front of the house. What are you so excited about, Ed? There's a man been following me the last three days when I'm out delivering candy. Well, maybe he wants a piece of candy. What's the matter, Alice? Are you jealous? Do you want to break your leg, too? Have to do it without holding. Essie. Mother, let me have a piece of paper, will you? I have to make our list for Rheba for tomorrow night. Essie, darling. Now, let Rheba have the kitchen all day tomorrow, won't you? She'll need it. Yes, Alice. That's why I'm making my Love Dreams now, so I'll be way ahead. Thank you, darling. Now, Mother, look, tomorrow, before the Kirbys come, let them put everything down in the cellar, the typewriter, the kittens, the vibraphone... The Kirbys are certainly going to get the wrong impression of this house. I guess I'd better have cocktails about 7:00. Dear, I wonder if I ought to let Rheba cook the dinner. Stop worrying, Alice. From what I've seen of the boy, the Kirbys are probably very nice. And if things aren't too elaborate tomorrow night, why, it will be all right, too. Darling, I'm not trying to impress them, or pretend we're anything that we aren't. We'll do everything we can to make it a nice party. - Will you, Mother? - Of course, dear. - Does Richard know where to go? - Yes, I told him, Dad. Why did it have to be tonight? I have more important things to do. Well, I didn't want to trouble you, but Alice wants you to meet her family. There you are, Anthony. She may be very nice after all. Why, Mother, you're breaking down. Heaven only knows what they'll have to eat. You know how sensitive my stomach is. Do we have to go there for dinner? There are sure to be some vegetables, Anthony. Probably raw. Mine have got to be cooked. - Mrs. Sycamore. Mrs. Sycamore. - Yes? Look what I found. It's my painting of you as the discus thrower. - Look, Grandpa. - You remember, over eight years ago. I always meant to finish it, then I got started on my plays and I never painted again. It's just as well. I'd have been the next one to strip. I wish you would finish it, Mrs. Sycamore. I'd kind of like to have it. Would you? Well, perhaps I will. Right tonight. Is the costume still down in the cellar and the easel? Sure. I saved them. You go and get them, Mr. DePinna. - And I'll find my palette and brushes. - Boy. - Hello, everybody. - Hello, Kolenkhov. - Well, Grandpa, I am in time for dinner, no? - Of course you are. That is why I like to come... What is that? That's a picture of Mr. DePinna. Penny painted it. It stinks. I'm sorry to keep you, Mr. Kolenkhov. My Love Dreams were on the stove. But I'll get into my dancing clothes and be right down. My Pavlova, you are like a beautiful swan. Essie making any progress, Kolenkhov? Confidentially, she stinks. As long as she's having fun. My, it feels nice to get into my art things again. You're a breath of Paris, Madame Sycamore. Thank you. Well, it happened again. A man followed me every place I went. I'm ready, Mrs. Sycamore. Where are you going to work? - Right here. - All right, Grandpa? I'd forgotten that costume was so classical. Now, your expression, Mr. DePinna. There. I'm ready now, Mr. Kolenkhov. Good. We go to work. Come, let's roll up the carpet, Ed. Yes, sir. I got a new piece. Can I play it? There are no new pieces. Play the Brahms' Hungarian Dance. I feel so good. Life is running around inside of me like a squirrel. Well, my Pavlova, now we work. Kolenkhov always said art is 110% sweat. That is better. - Ready, Eddie? - Yes, sir. Tempo. Faster, Eddie. Mrs. Sycamore, please. Mr. and Mrs. Kirby. - Faster. - Mrs. Sycamore. Mrs. Sycamore. Hey, faster. - Mrs. Sycamore. - Go away, Rheba. I'm busy now. - Pull your stomach in a little, Mr. DePinna. - I know, but, Mrs. Sycamore... My. Darling. Please, take all those... Here, dear. Take that. - Are we too early? - I'll say. It's perfectly all right. Why, of course. Only we thought it was to be tomorrow night. - Tomorrow night? - That's funny. - Really, Tony, this is most embarrassing. - No, we weren't doing a thing. Why, no, just having a quiet evening at home. Yes. Don't let that bother you. Please, come in. Come in, won't you? - This is Alice's mother. - How do you do? And this is Alice's sister and Mr. Carmichael, her husband. And this is Mr. Kolenkhov. And the discus thrower is Mr. DePinna. - How do you do? - How do you do? Excuse my costume. I'll take it right off. Jim. Jim. Alice. Alice. What is it? Will you come down? We have a big surprise for you. Be right down. Well... Won't you take your things off? Will you hang your father's coat up over there? Shall I... I'm very uncomfortable, Tony. This is all very embarrassing. Now, anybody can get mixed up. A chair for Mrs. Kirby. Get that out of the way. The rug, dear, the rug. That one for Mrs. Kirby, I think. And that one for Mr. Kirby. Ed, get that chair. Thank you. - Thank you, Ed. - Yes, sir. What about some dinner for these good people? After all, they did come to dinner, you know. - Please don't bother. - It's no trouble at all. Ed, tell Donald to run to Murphy's and get half a dozen bottles of beer - and some canned salmon. - Yes, ma'am. Wait a minute. Mr. Kirby, do you like canned salmon? Don't trouble, please. I'm not hungry. We're having frankfurters, but I don't think there will be enough now that you've come. Make it frankfurters, and tell Donald to get... Tell Donald to get a dozen more and an extra can of corn. - See if Rheba has enough sauerkraut. - All right. - Tell Donald to hurry. - Yes, ma'am. It won't take long. Murphy's Delicatessen is right next door. The pipe. This is Alice's father. Mr. and Mrs. Kirby. - How do you do? - How do you do? I hope you'll pardon my appearance. I couldn't find my other pants down in the cellar. It's quite all right. Without holding! My. What do you think, Alice? They thought it was tonight. Tony, don't you remember what... - Have you all met? - Yes. Dear, I'm so confused. You see, I had such a nice party arranged for tomorrow night. Perhaps we can come back again tomorrow night. Yes, of course. - Sit down, Mr. Kirby. - Thank you. Mother, I guess we'd better see about getting dinner. That's all done, Alice. He didn't touch second. Mother, what did you send out for? Mr. Kirby should have told you that he suffers from indigestion. Now, now, Miriam. It isn't as serious as all that. Perhaps it is not indigestion. Perhaps it is stomach ulcers. Ulcers? Don't pay any attention to Mr. Kolenkhov. He's Russian and the Russians are inclined to look on the dark side. All right, I'm Russian, but a friend of mine, a Russian, died from stomach ulcers. Mr. Kolenkhov, Mr. Kirby has indigestion and that's all. All right, let him wait. Please, folks. Let's not discuss Mr. Kirby's ulcers. Grandpa, please talk about something else. Ask Mr. Kirby about business. I'll be right back. As a matter of fact, Mr. Kirby, how are business conditions? What? Well, that depends on what side of the fence you're on. Personally, I find an improvement. There are two schools of thought on that subject, and I have no ulcers. You wait. - Do you mind if I smoke a cigar? - Not at all. Of course not. What about the unemployment problem? Unemployment? Unemployment is not the main problem, Mr. Vanderhof. - No? Why, that's I funny. I'd have thought... - Yes, I know. But that sort of viewpoint is purely emotional, not economic. Now, for instance, in 1929... My goodness, that's wonderful. It really frightened you, didn't it? Mr. Poppins. Mr. and Mrs. Kirby. - How do you do? - How do you do? Mr. Poppins makes up these masks as a sort of hobby. Really? I think he ought to warn people before he pops up in front of them like that. Now, let me see. What can we talk about? - Have you any hobbies, Mr. Kirby? - Business is my hobby. - Grandpa plays the harmonica. - Really? Did you ever try one, Mr. Kirby? Well, I... He used to be champ. He won first prize at amateur night. Told me so himself, didn't you, Dad? Say, I bet you and I could do a mean duet. I'm too busy a man to fool around with harmonicas. Here we are. Did you get everything, Donald? Yes. They didn't have anymore weenies, so I got pickled pigs' feet. Just take everything into the kitchen. Mr. Kirby, I'll have some scrambled eggs made for you, and a plain salad. - Will that be all right? - That'll be fine. Thank you. Forgot the mustard. That's that, I guess. Fine impression we're making. Tony, how could you make such a dreadful mistake? You knew it was for tomorrow night. Yeah, I guess it wasn't such a hot idea. You mean you did it on purpose? Tony, that's dreadful. How could you do such a thing? Alice, you know I didn't want to bring them down here at all, but you insisted. But if they have to meet you, I want them to meet you as you are. Not on some trumped-up evening with everybody acting unnaturally. There's nothing unnatural in wanting them to like us. If they don't like you the way they are, it's just too bad. It doesn't make any difference to me what they think. If you'd just left things alone, everything would have been all right. But, no, you had to go and get funny and spoil everything. It was a pretty stupid idea, I know. But, Alice, I'm just trying to be honest about this thing. I brought my family down here just as they are, stuffed shirts and all. I'm not trying to put on an act with them. Why should you have to with yours? Look, I'm trying to be honest, too. Can't you understand? I've got to get their approval. I'm not going to stand for your mother looking at me as if I were a thief or something. What do you think I am, a goop? Start the eggs, Rheba. Have you any hobbies, Mrs. Kirby? Well, as a matter of fact, I have. I'm a student of occultism. - What's that? - That's spiritualism, dear. Spiritualism? Mrs. Kirby, I'm surprised. - Everybody knows spiritualism is a fake. - I beg your pardon? Now, Penny. You mustn't criticize other people's hobbies. - You got one or two of your own, you know. - Yes, but not silly ones. Well, I... The perfect hobby should improve the body as well as the mind. The Romans were great people. Why? What was their hobby? Wrestling. In wrestling you must think quick with the mind and act quick with the body. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. I agree with you. When I was young, I was pretty good at it myself. - But, unfortunately, as one grows older... - Foolishness. Once a wrestler, you never forget. I have not done it for six years, but I forget nothing. Look. What's happening in here? Sit down, Mr. Kirby. - Where are my glasses? - Here they are. Mr. Kirby, they're broken. I am sorry, but when you wrestle again, Mr. Kirby, you will of course not wear your glasses. - I do not intend to wrestle again, sir. - That was very silly, Kolenkhov. I'm sorry you did that. I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby. If you don't mind, I think we better be going. - That's the best idea I've heard yet. - Please don't go. You're absolutely right, Mrs. Kirby. I think you should go. The whole thing was a mistake. I'm terribly sorry for everything. Alice, let me stay. I want to talk to you. No, I'd rather you wouldn't. There's nothing to talk about. - Good night, Mrs. Kirby. - Good night. Good night, Mr. Kirby. I hope you didn't get hurt. No. It's a pleasure to have met all of you. - Tony, come on. - Alice, I... - Will I see you tomorrow? - I don't know. - But I... - Good night, Tony. Good night. - Stay right where you are, everybody. - For heaven's sake. What's this all about? - Which one is it? - That one over there. Who? Me? What do you mean? - Look here. We don't belong in this house. - Keep your mouth shut, you. What's your name? Ed Carmichael, and I haven't done anything. See here. This seems very high-handed. - What's it all about? - Police Department. J-men. - G-men, Penny. - Ed, what have you done? Nothing. I told you somebody was following me. But these people don't belong here. Please let them go. Don't let anybody out that door. This is outrageous. Do you realize who I am? - What's your name? - Beton Batopevitch Kolenkhov. - Where are you from? - Omsk. - Where? - Omsk. - These stairs lead to the cellar? - Yes, they do. Look out, Chief. - What do you call this? - It's called the New Monster. Playing boogieman? Yeah. Get over there. My goodness. He must've gotten out of the wrong side of the bed this morning. Mike, Bill. Take a look. Come here, you. - Ever see these before? - Yes, sir. I printed lots of them. - You print this stuff? - Yes, sir. And you put them into candy boxes to get them into people's homes? - My Love Dreams. - But I didn't mean anything. - You didn't? - No, sir. - ""Watch for the Revolution."" - Radicals. ""The Red Flag will sweep the country."" I didn't mean that. I just like to print, that's all. See here. The government isn't in any danger from Ed. Why, printing is just his hobby. That's all. Why he'd print anything. It's just like a play, isn't it? Now, look here, young man. Don't be so silly. I must get my pipe. We were right, Chief. There's enough gunpowder down there to blow up the town. - But we only use that... - Shut up. Everybody in this house is under arrest. What's that? Stay right here. - I tell you I must get it. - You stay right where you are. It's lit. - What's that? - The fireworks. Jim. - Anthony. - Miriam, run! - Alice! - Grandpa! Keep your shirts on. The Revolution! Home again. Just like Siberia. Only it stinks. It was fun being fingerprinted, wasn't it? Mr. Kirby didn't think so. It took three men to hold him down. Never a dull moment, that's what I say, never a dull moment. I can walk alone. I never heard of anything so outrageous in all my life. Never mind the argument. Stop pushing me around like this, you fools. I'm Anthony P. Kirby. You hear that? Okay, pal, I'm George Washington. I want a telephone. I want to telephone my attorneys, you numbskulls. We've made two calls for you already, mister. Keep your shirt on. - But this is Mr. Kirby, the banker. - Yeah, well, that ain't my fault. Night court's in session right now. He'll have to wait his turn. - I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby. - You're sorry. That's something after what I've been through. After all, you did come on the wrong night. The mayor will hear of this and so will the commissioner. - I'll have you all fired! Every one of you. - Dad, don't get excited. - In a couple of hours... - In a couple of hours... I hope you're satisfied with your mother in there with a lot of cheap, common... Pipe down, big shot. We want music. Hit it up, Pop, and make it hot. Listen, Matron, I'm Mrs. Kirby. Mrs. Anthony P. Kirby. I'll give you $100 if you'll get me a private room. Private room? We keep those for the insane cases. Please do, she doesn't belong here with us. Have her throw a couple of fits, lady, and I'll try to fix it. Mrs. Kirby, please, believe me, I'm so sorry to have gotten you into all this trouble. I'll appreciate it if you'll leave me strictly alone. Don't let her get you, sister. They're getting tougher every place. Say, where you been operating? You got class. That's the kind of connection I'm looking for. Wasn't it exciting in that car with the sirens screaming? You better sit on your hands, Mrs. Kirby. It gets kind of cold after you sit awhile. All right, but don't say that I didn't tell you when you begin to feel it. Good heavens. Why don't you come down off your high horse, babe. I might be able to do you some good. If you don't mind, I don't need anyone to do me good. Never can tell, sugar plum. I know a good... Please, let her alone. Can't you see she's a lady? A lady? They sure get around nowadays. You needn't waste your time trying to protect me. That won't help you. If you had any sense, young woman, you'd stay where you belong and stop being ambitious. Shall I sock her, Alice? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Spend a quarter of a million dollars a year for attorneys and I can't get one of them. Young man, will you get me some bicarbonate of soda? What flavor? Well, I've got you to thank for this. I hope it will teach you a lesson. Fooling around with stenographers. - Now, listen, Dad. I intend to marry that girl. - Yes, I know. I know. I was going to marry a waitress once, fortunately my father knocked it out of me. If you'll excuse me, Mr. Kirby. I don't believe anyone has the right to interfere with young people in love. - Why don't you relax? - Relax? With my son practically being stolen from under my nose. Me being locked up like a common criminal. ""Relax!"" You know what'll happen if the newspapers get a hold of this? It'll jeopardize the biggest deal of my career. Stop worrying. If I know my granddaughter, she isn't going to marry Tony without your blessing. The only thing you've got to be concerned about is this big deal of yours. What if it does fall through? What if all your deals fall through? - Might be a good thing for you. - Man, you're crazy. Well, maybe I am, but I used to be just like you once. Then one morning, when I was going up in the elevator, it struck me I wasn't having any fun. So, I came right down and never went back. Yes, sir. That was 35 years ago. Admirable. And you haven't done a thing since? Yes. Just the things I wanted to do. Collected stamps. Went to the zoo when I got the notion, took up the harmonica again and even found time to notice when spring came around. This would be a fine country if we all spent our time in the zoo and played the harmonica. You used to play one yourself. Tony said so. Maybe you ought to take it up again. Maybe it would stop you trying to be so desperate about making more money than you can ever use. You can't take it with you, Mr. Kirby. So what good is it? As near as I can see, the only thing you can take with you is the love of your friends. Why don't you go out and get yourself a pulpit somewhere? Well, I'm sorry. - Which one is Vanderhof? - Right here. Hello, Mr. Vanderhof. Remember me? Twitch-face. Yes, I heard that you were in trouble and came over to see if I could help you out. Why should you want to help me? To tell you the truth, I thought that if I did you a favor... You're wasting your time, Mr. Twitch, Mr. Blakely. - I have no intention of selling my home. - We'll see how long you can hold out. Wait 'til a few more things happen to you. - So you arranged this arrest? - Yes, and it's just a starter. By the time I get through, you'll be willing and glad to sell. So you did this? Why, Mr. Kirby. You blockhead. Do you know what you've done? But, Mr. Kirby, I never dreamed that you knew these people. I told you the police were on their trail and you told me to go ahead and make them sell. You blithering idiot, get out. If you've got an ounce of sense left, you'll dig up my attorneys. - I've been here for hours. - Yes, sir. I'll phone them all. So, you're the one that's been holding up my deal? - Yes. Kind of funny, isn't it? - What's funny about it? The idea of you engineering this whole thing and being caught in your own trap. Maybe it won't be so funny when I take that house away from you. Now I begin to see what's been going on. That's a fine trick, Mr. Vanderhof. Using my son to get information, and then making me pay through the nose. - Wait a minute... - Nobody will make me pay for anything - unless I want to. - Now you've got those all wrong. I'll show you how to do business the Kirby way. Business? You're not a businessman. You're like a lion in the jungle. Yes, and I've got the longest and the sharpest claws, too. That's how I got where I am, on top, and scum like this is still in the gutter. You're an idiot, Mr. Kirby. - What? - A stupid idiot. - You can't talk to me like that. - Yes, I can. Scum, are we? What makes you think you're such a superior human being? Your money? If you do, you're a dull-witted fool, Mr. Kirby. And a poor one at that. You're poorer than any of these people that you call scum. Because I'll guarantee at least they've got some friends. But you, with your jungle and your long claws, as you call them you'll wind up your miserable existence without anything you can call a friend. You may be a high mogul to yourself, Mr. Kirby, but to me you're a failure. A failure as a man, a failure as a human being, even a failure as a father. When your time comes, I doubt if a single tear will be shed over you. The world will probably cry ""good riddance."" That's a nice prospect, Mr. Kirby. I hope you'll enjoy it. I hope you'll get some comfort out of all this coin you've been sweating over then. I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby. I haven't lost my temper like that in 30-odd years. Don't know what came over me. I didn't mean anything I said. I wish you'd told me to mind my own business. If there's any way I could make up for it I would. Here, how'd you like to have my harmonica? It's a new one and good, too. You might want to play it sometime. After all, who am I to criticize anybody? All right, everybody out for night court. Have your slips ready. I'm Mr. Kirby's attorney. Where is he? - Kirby. - Yes, Kirby, Kirby. Yes. Just going to be arraigned. Right through there. Wonder what he's so excited about. Attorney for Mr. Kirby. Has he been arraigned yet? - Not yet. Right through that door. - Thank you. Kirby? Anthony P. Kirby. - Is that Anthony P. Kirby, the banker? - It's Kirby, the banker, you know. Just a minute, please. Yes, that's Anthony P. Kirby. That's all we wanted to know. Boy. - What did you say your name was? - Anthony P. Kirby. Psychopathic ward. I sentence you to 31 days in the city jail but I'll suspend 30 days of that sentence if you give me your word that as soon as you get out tomorrow morning you'll go back to your folks in Kansas. - Thank you, sir, thank you. - That's all right, run along. Your Honor, would you take the Vanderhof case next? Why? We just found out that one of them is A.P. Kirby. - The banker? - Yes. What are the charges? Disturbing the peace and manufacturing fireworks without a license. Fireworks? You mean to tell me that A.P. Kirby has been held in the drunk tank? Well, well, well... Is that why all these spectators are here tonight? No. They are Vanderhof's friends. I didn't know anybody had that many friends anymore. The newspapermen heard about Kirby yet? - I don't think so. - That's good. What a holiday they'd have if they knew A.P. Kirby was in the drunk tank. Well, bring them in right away. No use crucifying him. - Bring in the Vanderhofs. - Vanderhof case next. Get away from me. Have you seen the... Hello, Grandpa. Order. Order. Quiet. Order. Your Honor, in arresting Mr. and Mrs. Kirby and their son, a grave blunder was made and we would suggest... - Do all four of you represent Mr. Kirby? - Yes, Your Honor. Quite an array of talent for a misdemeanor. If there's any objection, Your Honor, to Mr. Kirby being represented by counsel... Not at all. Not at all. In fact, this court feels quite flattered. - Thank you. - Yes. The charge is disturbing the peace. - How do you plead? - Not guilty, of course. Of course. Mister, are you represented, or any of your people, by counsel? No, sir. I guess we were disturbing the peace if anyone took the trouble to make a complaint against us. And if it's against the law to make fireworks without a license I guess we're guilty of that, too, because we've been doing it a long time. I don't feel guilty, do you, Essie? Order, order, please. Mr. Vanderhof, on the charge of disturbing the peace you and the rest of your family are, by your own plea, guilty. - However, I shall suspend sentence. - Thank you. But, the manufacturing of explosives without a license, I'm sorry I'm forced to fine you $100. One hundred dollars? That's a lot of money. Your Honor, Mr. Kirby, who is noted for his charitable work would like to pay the fine for this poor unfortunate family. No, thank you. I couldn't let you do that. No, you don't. Grandpa don't need your money. We'll pay that fine. Order, order! Order in the court. Order, order. No, it's all right, Officer. It's all right. Let them come in. We'll pay the fine. We don't need your money. A whole hat full, Grandpa. A whole hat full. We'll get it, Grandpa. There you are, Judge, is that enough? Yes, I think so. Take the money over to the clerk's desk. Mr. Vanderhof, you're a very lucky man to have so many friends. Yes. - How about it, Lieutenant? - You can't come in here. Come on, will you? Let us take just one flash. Now, gentlemen. I'd like to dismiss the charges against the Kirbys of disturbing the peace but unfortunately they were present at the time of the arrest and if these people were guilty then I must naturally assume that the Kirbys were guilty also. But Your Honor, that's absurd. Unless, of course, they can explain what they were doing there. Don't say a word, Anthony. I'm afraid they've got you, Mother. Do you realize, Your Honor, that this gentleman is Mr. Anthony P. Kirby? I've been made to realize that fact. Perhaps Mr. Anthony P. Kirby himself can explain what they were doing there. - Well, Your Honor... - I don't think that that's important. Haven't we been embarrassed enough? It seems to me a little more respect should be shown for our position. Your Honor, this charge is absolutely ridiculous. Failing a satisfactory explanation, I shall be obliged to have them stand trial. - But... - They have the right to be heard. Your Honor, please. Mr. Kirby came to see me about buying my house. - About buying your house? - Yes. You see, he's been interested in the property for some time now and... Well, he just came there to talk a deal over. That's all. Why, of course that's why we were there, and I don't see why we should be held accountable for anything that these people might have done. - That's not true. - Now, Alice. Grandpa, I won't stand for it. I won't stand for our being humiliated like this. They're ashamed to tell you why they were there. They're ashamed to admit they came to look my family over to see if I was good enough to marry their precious son. I never heard anything - so ridiculous in my life. - Now just a minute, Your Honor. - She's right. That's the reason we were there. - It's about time you spoke up. I've decided that it's your family that isn't good enough. Why, I wouldn't be related to a bunch of snobs like that for anything in the world. Your mother's all in a dither because of her social reputation. - That's telling them, Alice. - Who do they think they are? Order! Your reputation's safe as far as I'm concerned and so is your son's, and so's your old man's. What's up? Cinderella just told Prince Charming to go take a flying leap. - How about us taking a flying leap? - That's a good idea. Order in the court. Order. Officer, put these men out. The next time you want to go slumming, stay away from our neighborhood. Alice, please. Order. Order. Dang gummit, Alice should've let us know where she was going. Don't you think so, Essie? Any word from her yet? I've been all over town. The detective agency worked all night on it. They've checked every hotel for 100 miles around. Mrs. Sycamore, won't you please tell me where she is? I don't know, Tony. Even if I did, I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you. - If I wrote her a letter would you see... - You don't understand, Tony. She doesn't want to see you. That's why she went away mostly. There's no use in your coming here anymore, and trying to find her. You'll only make things worse for her. For us, too. Well, I guess that's that. - We're all awfully sorry, Tony. - Thank you, sir. Boy, I sure do feel sorry for Tony. Rheba say you want something to eat, somebody? No, I'm not hungry, are you? I ought to be cleaning up the cellar. It's in an awful mess. Look here, everyone. Here's a letter from Alice. Really? - How is she? - Where did you get it? Ned, the postman, chased me down the street and gave it to me. He recognized her handwriting. I've read it, Penny. Read it aloud, Penny. - Where's it from, Mother? - Wait a minute. My hands are shaking. She's staying with Helen, that school friend in Riverside. That's in Connecticut, isn't it, Grandpa? Read the letter, Mother. Now, let me see. ""And I was so miserable and confused I had to do something. ""I do hope you'll understand. ""It's peaceful here and I've thought it all out. ""I know now the situation between Tony and me is impossible. ""Mrs. Kirby was right. I should have stayed in my own backyard. ""Don't worry about me, Mother. I'll get over it. ""My darlings, I'm so lonesome for you. ""I don't know how I can stand it. ""Last night I cried myself to sleep, and that helped a little. ""But this morning when I woke up and realized I wasn't in my own bed..."" ""I wish I could rush back home. But how can I, if I want to forget? ""The newspapers, Tony, and a million little things make it impossible. ""Forgive me, my darlings. ""I promise to write every day, sometimes twice or even more. ""Please, everybody, take good care of yourselves. ""Don't let anything happen to you. ""All my love, Alice."" Sounds to me like she's not coming back. Mr. Blakely, please. Mr. Blakely? Dad, you don't mean you're thinking of selling the house? Alice is right. She can never come back here. It would only make her miserable. I won't let her live alone. We'll find a place up there with her. Mr. Blakely, this is Vanderhof. Do you still want to buy the house? You'll only pay $25,000 now. Well, all right. Certainly, today. All right, that's all. Goodbye. Well, we had to leave this house sometime, anyway. I had a hard time, but I made the old codger sell. - Mr. Kirby's got all 12 blocks, solid. - All right, Henry. We can go ahead. We've got the Vanderhof property. Line up Kincaid right away. If that old gent hadn't sold, the whole deal would've been blocked. What a spotty head, the sucker. To all tenants in the 12-block area. Notice. You are hereby notified that... ""You are hereby notified that 10 days from this date your premises must be vacated."" - That's the same as I've got. - That certainly doesn't give us much time. - Does it? - No. Look. The Jensens must have gotten their notice. Let's go see. - Mr. Jensen, did you get one of these? - Sure. We have to get out in 10 days. - We all have to move. - I can't understand it. Grandpa said if they couldn't buy his house, nobody would have to move. Look. Sorry, Mr. Kirby can't be disturbed. I think it's all over, don't you? Hello? Sorry, Mr. Kirby's not available. Hello. He's not answering his phone. Sorry. I've just been upstairs. All our board members are there, and so are the heads of those six little companies. Boy, is this merger going to make history! I hear the market's going crazy. They don't know whether to buy or sell. I hope we're right. I have everything I own sunk in this. - Stop bellyaching. We can't miss. - Let's get this over with. Where's Kirby? In there. We've been waiting half an hour for him. Who's with him? Nobody. He's probably taking bows in front of the other Kirbys on the wall. Hello. No. Tell the senator to keep his shirt on. - Kirby wants him to stay in Washington. - No newspapers until after the meeting. - Ramsey make trouble for us? - You're crazy. He's broke. He's finished. Kirby hasn't even left him carfare. You've got to hand it to the old man. How he squeezed down on old Ramsey, beautiful. I saw Ramsey this morning, you know. It wouldn't surprise me if he were to blow his brains out. I tell you, they're waiting up there. Let's get Kirby and get this thing over with before something happens. - Good idea. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You know he doesn't like that. Good heaven, man. Look at the time. I'll get him on the phone. Maybe he won't mind that. Get me Mr. Kirby in the conference room. Hello. Yeah. Certainly. Well, come on. What are you waiting for? They're waiting upstairs. We'd better be getting up there. - Good. Have you got your proxies? - Right here. Including Kincaid's. He was tough. But when we offered to make him president, he jumped at it. When you offered to make him what? I explained to him that all you wanted to be was the chairman of the board of directors. Tell him it's a mistake. I've already chosen the president. - But we were saving... - Anthony Kirby, Jr. is going to be president. - Tony? He's much too young, A.P. - Yes. Is he? - What about our promise to Kincaid? - You've got his proxy. Forget about him. - But A.P., we have our obligations... - I say, forget about him. Come on. Now, please, Mr. Ramsey, Mr. Kirby is very busy... Well, Mr. Kirby, I suppose you're very proud of yourself. Another victory. The greatest of your career. What do you want, Ramsey? You know something. I actually thought of coming here to ask for mercy but I couldn't figure out a basis on which to do it. Certainly not friendship. Once, a long time ago, that might have been possible but you destroyed that, Anthony. Remember? Look at me, Anthony. Tomorrow the world will read that Ramsey is broke. Doesn't that please you? I've seen men jump out of windows for less, but I'm going to fool you, Anthony because I've suddenly realized that I haven't lost a thing, that I never gained one moment's happiness out of it. And I warn you, Anthony, and neither will you. In spite of your victories, you can't shut out every decent impulse and survive. You're top-heavy with power right now, Anthony, but you're going to crack under it. You're bound to crack under it. And do you know what is going to happen, Mr. Anthony P. Kirby? You'll scream for help and suddenly find yourself alone in the world. You'll wriggle on the hook and find that nobody gives a hang. I know because that's what happened to me. And it will happen to you. That's what happens to all men like us, Anthony. It's coming to us, it's coming to... - He's taking it kind of hard. Isn't he? - Always was a weak sister. Sounded crazy to me. - They're waiting upstairs. Let's get up there. - Come along, A.P., come along. Go upstairs and start things. I'll be up in a minute. - But they're waiting. - I'll be up in a minute. - Hello, Dad. May I come in? - Hello, Son. Come on in. How are you? Glad to see you. Sit down. I want to talk to you. You know what I always said about the Kirbys and Tennyson's brook? They go on forever. If you're talking about the meeting upstairs, - I know all about that. Congratulations. - Thank you, but that's nothing at all. There's more to it than that. When I get through with them upstairs, there will be a new president. - Do you know who that's going to be? - Dad, I know you're going to be busy, so I... I'm quitting. You're quitting? I just handed in my resignation. I've been thinking about it for a long time... So, you're quitting. What are you going to do? I don't know. I think I'll go away for a while. Try and get myself organized. I'm was going to hang on to my job until this thing with Alice got all straightened out but that's all over, so... There's no use waiting around for that. I don't know, I... I thought, maybe after I get back, I could start to work on that grass thing. You remember that thing Bob Smith and I fooled around with in college? Yes. Dad, if you think it's funny, I'm sorry. I came in here to say goodbye. Goodbye? - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. I don't want any part of this, Dad. I never did. You can't do this, after all the plans I made for you... Dad, if I can just make you understand this. I think this business is great. It's good for you because you like it. I don't. And I never will. I've tried to talk to you many times about it, but I just couldn't get it out. I used to be able to talk to you, Dad, but lately... I'll probably be gone before you get home tonight. Goodbye, Dad. Goodbye, son. Maybe when I get back, we can sit down and have a good old-fashioned gabfest. Yeah, yeah. - Yes. - It's about Mr. Ramsey, sir. They just found him dead in the washroom. The doctor said it was heart failure. Yes? - What did you say? - They just found Mr. Ramsey dead. A.P., they're getting impatient upstairs. I can't hold them any longer. Boardroom. Get everything set. We're on our way up. Hello, Mr. Kirby. Fifty-second. Fifty-second. Fifty-second, sir. Take me down. - Down? - Down? - Where you going, A.P? - We can't postpone this meeting. - Take me down. - We've been waiting on you for hours. What's the matter, Mr. Kirby? Is there something wrong? Darned if I don't think they enjoy this moving. Don't be silly. It's killing them. It certainly is going to be gay around here when you leave, Grandpa? Grandpa found the cutest place near where Alice is, right on the ocean. - Lake, Penny. Lake. - That's what I said, lake. We're going to invite you all up to go deep-sea fishing. - Gee, Mr. Kolenkhov, isn't it exciting? - Exciting? With you moving and the Grand Duchess out of a job, where do I eat? - Hello, Mr. Vanderhof. - So you're here again. Why won't you tell me where she is? Because there's an unwritten law in our family against snitching. But look, Mr. Vanderhof, I just sort of feel I can talk to you about this thing. I've left my job and I'm going away tonight, and I... But I love Alice. And she loves me. This whole thing is ridiculous. I'm convinced, young man, but you're not marrying me. After all, Alice is the woman. Yeah, I guess you're right. I just thought I'd take a parting shot before I left. I certainly have messed things up beautifully, haven't I? - Yes. - Well, goodbye, sir. The trouble with young squirts nowadays is they have no imagination. They don't use the old bean. Well, I'll do anything you say, sir. - You want to see Alice again, don't you? - Yes. - And we can't tell you where she is? - Yes, no, sir. There's a big trunk of Alice's upstairs and they're going to take it right where she is. Just don't say another word. Grandpa! Grandpa, I came just as soon as I got your telegram. I'm too late. You've already sold the house. Of course I've sold the house. I got tired of it. That's all. Grandpa, it's all my fault. Alice, dear. Alice, we were coming to you. Now everybody on the block has to move, don't they? And Grandma. What about her? You're walking out on her. Aren't you? Now, don't be childish, Alice. The thing is done. Now, go on upstairs and pack your things. Alice, will you give me a chance to talk to you? Well, they wanted the house and they got it, the mighty Kirbys. - No, no. Wait. - What are you doing here anyway? - Why don't you leave us alone? - Now wait a minute! I have something to tell you. I want you to listen. Go ahead and scream. That's the way you've gotten everything since you were a baby. Scream your head off and see what it gets you now. Alice, Alice. Alice. Alice. Alice. I sure feel sorry for Grandpa. I walked in the room and he was looking at a picture of Grandma and he was crying. Crying? Yeah. He got kinda sore, too, because he caught me looking at him, and threw something at me. There's only one thing worrying me. Have they got relief up there? Sure they have. They've got relief everywhere now. - There is? - Yeah. Let's get on up there then. Well, I guess we've moved everything out of here. Yes, that's about all. Here's one that didn't go off. Be careful with it. Especially the typewriter. I have a feeling I'm going to do my best work at our new place. Dad. Now, Penny, we've had enough wailing for one day. - Do you mind if I come in? - No, no, not at all. Come right in. We aren't quite prepared for visitors, but... Donald, put that chair down for Mr. Kirby. Let me have that stool, too, will you, Donald, please? Thank you. - Mr. Vanderhof, could we be alone? - Sure. Penny. Thank you. I don't know, Grandpa is talking to him. Mr. Vanderhof, you once told me I was a failure as a father. - I didn't mean that. - I know, but I am. Tony's walked out on me and it's just about made a wreck of me. Mr. Kirby, you're beginning to act quite human. Look, you know about these things. I don't. - I need your advice. I'd give a fortune to... - Now, there you are, you've got to stop thinking in terms of fortune. You know what I do when I run smack into a crisis? I just take out my harmonica and I play on it until that crisis just fades away. - Now, please don't joke about this... - I'm not joking about it. You asked my advice and I'm giving it to you. I think that if we played a duet together, you and I, on the harmonica... - You brought it with you, didn't you? - What? Well, I... Yes, fine. Now, let's play a duet good and loud. And you'll be surprised at what might happen. Let's see, what shall we play? Do you know Polly Wolly Doodle? - You ought to know it. - Polly Wolly Doodle? We drove you almost crazy with it once. You know it, of course you do. Now, come on. Let's play it, good and loud now, and swing it. What's that, Grandpa? Come on, Essie, let's get hot. Come on. My Russian wrestling friend. Magnificent, magnificent. Thank you. - Is my son here? - You'll be surprised. Anthony. Hello, Mother, come on. You do the Big Apple, too. Mr. Sycamore, you show her how to do the Big Apple. Come on. Why not? Quiet, please. Quiet. Well, sir, here we are again. We've had quite a time of it lately, but it seems as if the worst of it was over. Of course, the fireworks all blew up, but we can't very well blame that on you. Anyway, everything's turned out fine as it usually does. Alice is going to marry Tony. Mr. Kirby, who's turned out to be a very good egg, has sold us back our house and he'll probably forget all about big deals for a while. Nobody on our block has to move. And with the right handling I think we can even thaw out Mrs. Kirby in time. We've all got our health, and as far as anything else is concerned we still leave that up to you. Thank you. Bring it on, Rheba. Now it is two easy lessons, Mrs. Kirby, I will teach you... No holds barred. I hope you like it, Mr. Kirby.

You know, honey, when I did my act... and had a figure like yours, every man in town was at my feet. At your feet? I'd rather have them around my neck. Got me hooked up? I feel a draught. I've never known a woman who had so many gentleman friends. You certainly know the way to a man's heart. Funny, too, because I don't know how to cook.   Ladies and gentlemen... I am about to introduce the attraction of the evening... a lady who is the greatest sensation... of our 19th century. And tonight, ladies and gentlemen, you are about to see her... in the most beautiful act... it has ever been my privilege to offer. Miss Ruby Carter in My American Beauty.  Now listen, you guys, no rowdy talk when she's on. I'll respect her like me own sister. The one in the reformatory?  CROONER:  Sometimes you are like a gorgeous butterfly Sturdy hearts are shattered as you flutter by They say you're a vampire playing at love's game You may have too many beaus But to me you're a beautiful rose My American Beauty Please don't be a thorn in my heart I shall love you, dear Until my life's breath shall ebb You're the spider I'm the fly that's caught in your web My American Beauty Let us grow a honeymoon for two I'm attracted to you Like a moth seeks a flame North and South and East and West The country proclaims you My American Beauty Sweetheart of the red, white, and blue I've been waiting for you, Tiger. Up to your old tricks again? You two think you're pretty smart. Am I your manager or not? I wish you'd manage to leave us alone. - You ain't making a monkey of him. - Who wants to? I like him the way he is. She's a swell gal, but all she thinks about is having a good time. I don't only think about it. - I ain't gonna argue with you. - No, he won't argue. The parties, late hours, this has got to stop. Listen here, you, I don't like your attitude. And remember, I'm a lady, you worm. - You better go, Kirby. - I will not, I'm gonna wait here for you. Persistent, I'd call him. Or just plain ignorant. Escort me, Tiger. Remember, you're fighting Friday night. Friday night? He'll be there. Kirby's always butting in, I'm sorry it happened, Ruby. Makes me feel like I ain't doing you right. Don't say that. You know how I feel about it. Don't worry about Kirby, he ain't so hard to forget. - And I can always manage you, honey. - Yeah.  What are you doing? Looking me over? Yeah, these are swell, Ruby. - That was when I was with The Bonton Girls. - Yeah? Hey, who's this guy? That was before I knew you, dear. My banker friend. Yeah? What was his intentions? He wanted to put me on the Board of Directors. Who's this guy? Don't wear yourself out there. Sit down. Here's to you, Ruby. Here's to both of us. You don't know how I hated to leave town for the fight the other night. RUBY: I'm glad you won, honey. TIGER: That was nothing. I knocked him out in a hurry so I could get back to you. I always did like a man with masculine supremacy. I could do anything for you, Ruby. You're the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me. - You make me want to do great things. - You mean I'm inspiring. Yeah, that's it. Look, honey, after this next fight, you and me are gonna have a grand time. Why wait? Maybe you won't have to work no more, then. You mean you want me to give up my art? You will if you love me enough. If I love you enough, I'll have to.  Holy smoke, it's raining. - It's got to do that once in a while. - But Kirby, he'll get wet. Oh, throw him an umbrella. Hello, operator? Give me the police department. Yes, the police department. I'll fix this guy. Hello, police department? There's a suspicious looking character down in front of 441 Olive Street. You better come and get him before he does something desperate. Thanks. Fix him. Kirby'll kill me for this. - What do you care? - I don't. Absence does make the heart grow fonder, doesn't it? You don't stay away too long. You don't mean you were with some other guy while I was gone? Oh, honey, you ain't jealous. Ruby, if I catch some guy trying to fool around with you, I'll bust him in half. I couldn't blame you, but you got nothing to worry about. Promise me you'll never think of another man. - That depends on you. - Ruby, I'll love you always. Who could ask for more? OFFICER: What are you doing here? KIRBY: I'm only... Oh, yeah? KIRBY: Now, wait. TIGER: Good night, dear. I've got to get the kid straightened out, and that's the only way I can do it. KIRBY: Did what I tell you penetrate your thick head? MAN: Yeah, sure. KIRBY: All right. Now don't forget the name and the number, and lay it on thick. There's a five-spot in it for each of you. I'll show that dame there's more than one way to skin a cat. Now, I ain't the kind of guy... Real nice of you to drop around. Supposing you get into your gym clothes and get busy. What's the rush? I just sat down. When do you plan on training? After the fight? I don't need training for that. Don't kid yourself. Kramer's a fast boy, and he's strong. Don't worry, I'll stop him quick. I got a date after the fight. You may keep you date earlier if you don't watch yourself. I'm doing all right. If you don't like... Don't say it, kid. I don't want to have any hard feelings between us. I'm sorry, I'm a little jumpy this morning. You're right, I'd better do some training at that. Davenport 7000. Hello? Yes, this is Davenport 7000. Hello, Ruby. How are you, honey? This is your bunny boy. Bunny boy? I don't know any rabbits. Who is this? I ain't seen you lately. What's the matter? Somebody been filling my shoes? Nobody could? That's what I wanted to hear. I'm just crazy about you, baby. You're crazy about me? All right, I'll take your word for it. What? Why don't you break your date with the chump, whoever he is... and I'll see you tonight. You will? I'll be there, honey, and what I mean, I'm feeling fancy. BUNNY BOY: Hey, how about a little kiss? Boy, what a kiss that was. What's wrong, Tiger? STOGIE: Miss Carter, New Orleans is the town for you. Why, they'll go wild about you down there, you'll be a sensation. Excuse me, Stogie, what were you saying? I said you'd be sorry if you didn't take Ace La Mont's offer. How do I know I won't? Because he can make you one of the richest women in New Orleans. I've heard things like that before. With your talent he can do it. You'll have New Orleans at your feet. - When they like you, money means nothing. - Well, it... - Pardon me, what were you going to say? - It sounds all right. It's perfect. I got the contracts all made out. All you have to do is sign them.  RUBY: Come in. Hello, Ruby. RUBY: What do you want? There's something important I gotta talk to you about. Private. If it's so important. RUBY: Help yourself to a drink. STOGIE: Thanks. RUBY: Come in here. What's it all about? I heard that you and Tiger had a little scrap. - You heard? You're sure you didn't frame it? - Wait a minute, Ruby. Miss Carter. I got the Tiger's best interests at heart. I don't ask you to do anything for me. But if you really think anything of him... you'll let him alone until I can make him champ. I ain't got a heart of stone, I can listen to reason. Maybe it would be the best thing to let him go on thinking the way he does. That's nice of you. If you only knew what this meant to me. I've worked on him for months trying to make him champ... building him up, then you came along. If he were to lose this championship on your account... Get out of here before I stick a hatpin in you. RUBY: Give me those contracts. STOGIE: Here you are. When do we leave? There ain't anybody in town that don't know she's coming, by now. I've seen to that, just like you wanted, Ace. Only hope Stogie didn't slip up on his end. ACE: He knows better than to slip up. ACE: Wait until you see her, boys, what a woman she is. We knew you wouldn't bother with her if she wasn't something special. ACE: You're right. ACE: How about the preparations, have my instructions been carried out? Absolutely. ACE: We'll see, come along. Well, my dear Molly. Why this extraordinary curiosity about me? From you of all people, I have no secrets. I'll see you later. - Ace, I must talk to you now... - I said I'd see you later. I wouldn't mind being a woman myself and have a place like this. I'm afraid you haven't the necessary charm. Very nice. Where are the flowers? Confound it, where are they? I don't know, they were ordered. - Get them here immediately. - I'll attend to it myself. In less than an hour, the lovely Ruby Carter will be occupying this room. She's all you say she is, Ace. She's more. ACE: See if you can catch sight of Stogie. MAN: There he is! MAN: Hi, Stogie! ACE: I'm happy to welcome you. RUBY: Thanks. - We're all happy to welcome you. - Thank you. ACE: Take care of these men. RUBY: Yes, give them all my address. MAN 2: That's the way. Our carriage is waiting, shall we go? Sure, but you'll have to show me the way because I'm just a babe-in-the-woods. Great town, St. Louis. ACE: You were born there? RUBY: Yes. ACE: What part? RUBY: All of me. BROOKS: I beg your pardon, but you've dropped your glove. Thank you. Perhaps I could do something for you sometime. Yeah. Home. RUBY: Where's that? ACE: The Sensation House. The Sensation House? What a home that must be.  This is a pretty classy spot. I had everything carried out in French architecture. I always did like French art. And the house has plenty of atmosphere. Good or bad? ACE: There's no denying, it's a perfect setting for a woman like you. Yes, I guess I could do things in a place like this. Of course, it won't be all work. - You'll have moments of your own. - I do have my moments. - You have? - Yeah, but they're all weak ones. RUBY: Lovely painting. RUBY: What is this? One of your ancestors? ACE: No, but it's very valuable. This one in particular is an old master. Looks more like an old mistress to me. I trust you'll find I've left nothing undone to make you comfortable. I want you to enjoy every minute here. Of course, I'll be right here in the house all the time. A man in the house is worth two on the street. Gorgeous layout. Your idea, of course? I believe I may accept that compliment. By the way, where's Jasmine, my maid? Another carriage is bringing her, and your luggage. I've thought of everything. I bet you have. Driving you here has been very pleasant. - Yeah? - Yeah. I just can't wait till I see you again. You've got to wait. MOLLY: Ace, what about this woman? I won't have you bothering me at a time like this. There's too much to do. - I think we're gonna like it here. - Yes, ma'am.  Come in. MOLLY: So you're Ruby Carter. The only thing my mother told me. Everything else, I found out for myself. I'm Molly Brant. I guess you've never heard of me, but I'm Ace La Mont's sweetheart. - You understand? - That's fine. He's a swell guy, you want to hold on to him. - I guess I can do that all right. - Then what've you got to worry about?  Big crowd tonight. You're lucky you reserved a table. This Ruby Carter's certainly packed the place. - You've he heard of her, haven't you? - I was on the same boat with her. - Really? What sort of a person is she? - I only saw her for a moment.  Now the most important announcement in the history of the Sensation House. I have spared no expense in bringing, to New Orleans and you... the queen of all entertainers. Ladies and gentlemen, I take great pleasure in presenting to you, for your enjoyment... the artistic talents of a lady, whose fame has travelled far and wide. A lady who has made St. Louis the most famous town on the Mississippi. Miss Ruby Carter.    When a St. Louis woman comes down to New Orleans When a St. Louis woman comes down to New Orleans She'll be wearing more diamonds than Uncle Sam's got Marines I had a good man in Memphis but the fool, he laid down and died I had a good man in Memphis but the fool, he laid down and died Because his old woman she hung a knife in his side Now he was her man but he came to see me sometimes I said, he was her man, but he came to see me sometimes I lived six flights up and he sure was willing to climb When it came to romancing my man, he sure knew how But that narrow-minded woman she had to start a row And so you see he's no good to either one of us now So bring on your papas from down in New Orleans Bring on those fancy-loving papas you got in New Orleans 'Cause I just came from Missouri I guess you know what that means I've never seen anyone like her. She is simply divine. If she is as interesting to meet as she is on the stage... she is just the inspiration I need. MAN: Well spoken. Gentlemen, I want you to meet Miss Ruby Carter. How do you do? These gentlemen are all friends of mine. A pleasure. Friends of yours are friends of mine. - Won't you join us at the bar? - We beg of you to join us. You have a nice way of asking. I you will excuse Miss Carter now... I'm sure she'll be happy to join you later at the roulette table. - We'll be anxiously waiting for you. - Yes. Lovely. - At the roulette table. - Yes. Marvellous, wasn't it? I guess that's the word for it. - And it's the word for you, too. - Thanks. Ruby, I'd like to have a little talk with you. I'm listening. - You and I could go a long way together. - How do you mean? With your beauty and talents, and my business ability, we could make a fortune. Sounds interesting. Of course, you know why I brought you down here, don't you? I got a rough idea. You're the kind of a woman I've dreamed about, always desired. I'm wild about you. Some of the wildest men make the best pets. - Ruby, please. - Wait a minute, Ace. - What about this dame Molly? - Molly? She doesn't mean a thing. Just a passing fancy. Maybe you think I'm a passing fancy. - You couldn't be. - You bet your life I couldn't. ACE: Ruby, please. RUBY: Listen, Ace, I like you and all that... but I ain't stepping into another dame's shoes. I never took a man away from another woman yet. Not unless she done me dirt. It's a principle with me. But I wish you forget your principles. Ruby, I must have you. Your golden hair, your fascinating eyes, alluring smile, and lovely arms. - Your form divine. - Wait a minute. Is this a proposal or are you taking inventory? Am I to understand that you're rejecting my proposal? Oh, no. I just want little time to figure this out. You see, I'm in the habit of picking my own men. - In that case I still have hopes. - Oh, yes. Get your bets down, ladies and gentlemen, the wheel is now going. Do I bother you if I look over your shoulder? No, do I bother you? Twelve on the red wins. Are you in town for good? I expect to be here but not for good. BROOKS: I beg your pardon. CROUPIER: Twenty-three on the red wins. How do you do? I'm glad you remember me after our rather informal meeting. CROUPIER: All bets down, the wheel is now turning. Make your play. I had almost forgotten. CROUPIER: One on the red wins. That's too bad. Well, that's roulette for you. DOORMAN: Good night, sir. MAN: Good night? MAN: You mean good morning? DOORMAN: Good morning, sir. RUBY:  Some like short men some like them tall I'm funny that way 'cause I like them all Tell me how long do I have to wait? Can I get you now? Or must I hesitate? I hate to wait SPECTATOR: Bravo! MAN 1: May I offer you a New Orleans Fizz. Permit me to call you an old dear. MAN 1: A New Orleans Fizz for the lady. BARTENDER: Yes, sir. I'm so glad to see so many men here. The kind I like, too. You flatter us. May we ask what types of men you prefer? Just two, domestic and foreign. Won't you tell us where you're stopping during your visit here? Stopping at nothing.  French toast. It's all right. Drink to her who long has made strong men sigh... to the girl that gave to song what gold could never buy. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. It's better to be looked over than overlooked. MAN 2: Won't you sing once more for us? RUBY: I'm sorry, gents, but I have to retire. Please sing. The fun's all over if you go to bed. All right, I'll sing. - What will it be? - Sing St. Louis Woman again. No, why not sing your own favourite? My favourite? All right. Play it, boys.   My old flame I can't even think of his name But it's funny now and then How my thoughts go drifting back again To my old flame My old flame My new lovers all seem so tame For there never was a gent More magnificent or elegant than my old flame I've met so many who have fascinating ways A fascinating gaze in their face Some that took me up to the skies But their attempts at love were only imitations Of, ah, my old flame Just can't think of his name But I'll never be the same until I discover what became of my old flame  JEWELLER: This one is less expensive, Mr. Claybourne. But I think she will like this one better. - Very well. - Put this card with it. JEWELLER: Thank you very much, Mr. Claybourne. Why, you can see for yourself what's on her mind. She's been out with this Claybourne every afternoon for two weeks. He's up here every night gambling. But it's just to see her. Maybe you noticed she was wearing some more new diamonds lately. - It's another present from him. - And why are you telling me this? Just thought you'd like to know. Thought maybe you'd appreciate what you got... instead of wanting something you can't get. RUBY: Oh. ACE: Come in. What's the matter with her? What's the matter with you? Don't seem like you're in a very good mood. That's too bad. - I was just gonna ask you something. - Is that so? What is it? I was just thinking, I ought to have a little vacation. - Vacation? - Yeah, just about a week or so. Why, that's impossible. You're my main attraction. - Business is just picking up. - I know it. I haven't noticed you overworking yourself. Well, I never overwork myself for anybody. In fact, the only reason I work at all is to pass the time. ACE: I suppose you're going driving with young Claybourne. RUBY: How did you guess? ACE: Did he suggest this vacation? I don't know what you see in that inexperienced young blade. Experience isn't always necessary. Of course, I don't want to argue with you. About the week off, do I get it or don't I? - You don't. - All right... if that's the way you feel about it. You know, I don't have to do this for a living. Don't have to work at all. Send in Slade or Dirk or anybody. Ace, you're in a mess. You got the champ signed to fight in two weeks, haven't you? - Yeah. - And he'll fight Lefty Dougan. - You ain't got Lefty Dougan. - What? - You ain't got Dougan. - No? - He ran out. - Ran out? That is a mess. To have the match all set, and the contender backs out. That's the same thing with different words. Let's go down to the gym. - Hi, boys. - Hello, Mr. La Mont. Don't forget you're coming to my party tonight. ACE: Hi, Jim. JIM: How are you, Ace? Hey, Ace! Ace, what do you think of that guy Dougan? I'm not through with him. Wait till he tries to get another fight. I'm gonna get in touch with every promoter... What you gonna do? Call it off? If I call it off, I got to pay the champ anyway. The kind of money he gets, it's... Who is that fellow? That's my boy, the Tiger Kid. Hello, Kirby. When did you get in New Orleans? I just got in this morning. - So that's the Tiger Kid? - Yeah, that's him. - Ace, can I see you a minute? - Yeah. Now believe me, Ace, the Kid is good. Why, he's been knocking over everything that come along. - I've seen a lot of fighters in my time... - And I've heard a lot of talk. You mind having your boy go a couple of rounds with Joe Savage? No! I'd love it. - Joe. - Hey, Tiger. ACE: Now don't go easy with him, give him all you've got. It's all right with me if you get him with the first punch. Go on. TIGER: Hi, Mr. La Mont. ACE: Hello, Tiger. ACE: I'd like to have a little talk with you. Come over here. I like the way you handle yourself, you got class. Thanks. I'll see you in the dressing room in just a moment. I think I found a fighter who can beat the champ. And I think I found the answer to something else, too. Now that Ruby Carter has all those diamonds Claybourne gave her... - she is very hard to handle. - You're right, boss. See you later. That's great, and bet plenty on me, you'll double your money. - You only got two weeks to train. - I'm in shape, I could fight him tomorrow. You're not talking about money, are you? If you're talking money, talk to me. I'll settle that part with you later, Kirby. I wanna have a talk with the Tiger. All right. I hope you appreciate what I'm doing for you. I sure do, Mr. La Mont. Maybe someday I'll be able to do something for you. I'm coming to that. You know, Kid, it takes a lot of money to stage a championship match. Yeah, I know. And I had plenty when I signed the champ, but... - well, women are my weakness. - You, too? To tell you the truth, Kid, I sunk practically all I had on a woman. That's bad. She's got something on me, you know how that is, she makes me pay. That's worse. And I have showered her with diamonds and jewels galore. But she's the type of woman that can't play fair. - That's tough, Mr. La Mont. - Tough? Why, it's terrible. If I could get some of the jewels back, why, it would be a cinch to put on the fight. - I was thinking if you would... -  Oh. - You want the title, don't you? - Yeah. But she ain't got it. There'll be nothing to it. I'll have everything arranged. - Who is she? - You don't need to know that. I'll be driving her along the lake tonight, and all you have to do is... This is quite the thing to do, drive along the lake like this. ACE: You and I should make a habit of it. RUBY: One bad habit is good as another. I didn't know you liked diamonds so well or I'd have draped you with them. RUBY: Why didn't you? ACE: You haven't encouraged me very much. ACE: Besides I hesitated because... RUBY: The man that hesitates is last. I haven't given up hopes yet. RUBY: I thought you took me out here to talk business. ACE: On a night like this I prefer to talk... RUBY: But I'd told you... TIGER: Stick them up! TIGER: Give me the rocks. ACE: Now see here. TIGER: Shut up! Come on, hurry it up. Give me them bracelets. TIGER: Come on, give me them. Hurry up. And the thing off your neck, too. Come on, don't stall me. TIGER: All right, now get going and don't stop. This is an outrage. No one can do a thing like this to Ace La Mont and get away with it. I'll get that fellow if have to scour the country for him. Say, it's funny he didn't take your ring. Yes.  - I didn't know she was in town, did you? - No, I didn't. See here, you're not gonna fall for her all over again, are you? - Lf you are, maybe we better not go in. - Don't worry about me. Come on, Ace is expecting me. Coming, bunny boy? Yeah, sure. - Where is the party for the fighters? - Right in there. - Ace there? - No, he's upstairs. Thanks.  ACE: Nice work, Kid. Just as smooth and easy. TIGER: I hope it stays that way. Jails are draughty this time of the year. Don't worry. No one would have known you in a million years. I hardly recognised you myself. TIGER: Swell stuff, Ace. I'll put it away and we'll join the party.   Folks, I've just come down Down from Memphis town That's where people smile smile at you all the while Hospitality They were good to me I couldn't spend a dime I had the grandest time I went out dancing with a Tennessee dear They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear While the white folks gently swayed All those darkies played real harmony I never will forget the tune that they call the Memphis blues Oh, those blues They've got a fiddler up there who always slickens his hair And, boy, he sure do pull some bow And when the big bassoon seconds to the trombone's croon Oh, yeah No one can make it like that piano man They got a hot cornet that you could never forget Oh, play it, boy When the drum goes wild Mother, come and get your child  I brought them here 'cause I couldn't bear to lose those Memphis blues There's too much fuss being made over this woman. Don't think you're fooling me. You're in love with her. ACE: That again? Yes, I was good enough for you till she came here. You're working here and getting paid. If you're dissatisfied, get out. - Ace, you can't do this to me. - You're getting to be a nuisance.  TIGER: Hello, Ruby. I didn't expect to meet you in this town. - No? - No. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. You don't mean to tell me you actually missed me. More than that. I can't get you out of my mind, Ruby. - I think about you all the time. - Oh, yeah? Did you ever give me a second thought? Do you suppose I could forget a guy as good as you? - You mean that? - Of course. BUNNY BOY: Why don't you join the party? They got wine, they got whiskey, they got... Who's your friend? - You don't know him? - No. You don't know her? I'm glad you mentioned it, I was gonna tell you about that. You were gonna tell me about it, huh? I'll be back in a minute, Ruby. BUNNY BOY: Look, it was a joke. TIGER: A joke? BUNNY BOY: Me and Kirby... TIGER: You and Kirby fixed it, eh?  - Hi. - I'll be right over with you, boys. There's lots of things I would like to talk over with you, Ruby. - But there's not much privacy here. - You're right. You might have known you could trust me. Ruby, you don't realise what you've done to me. Been so long since I was alone with you, since I had you in my arms. Said you had a lot to tell me. I'm waiting to hear it. - What's the matter, Ruby? - What've you been doing lately? Yeah, I forgot to tell you. I'm gonna fight the champ. I just put over the deal with Ace. - I've been doing all right lately. - Well? RUBY: You've been doing all right? TIGER: Yep. TIGER: I'm on my way to the top. TIGER: What I want to know is if I made the grade with you. What do you think? Honey, I'm not feeling sentimental. What's wrong, Ruby? You have changed. I can't figure you out. - You will. - Is there some other guy? No. From now on, you're gonna be my special problem. And I ain't gonna neglect you. TIGER: That's what I wanna hear you say. TIGER: When can I see you again? Anytime. - Good night. - Good night, Ruby.  Good night. Trying to outsmart me, what a laugh that is. Fooling with one of the smartest dames he ever put his arms around. I sees you and Mr. Tiger is together again. You think we're together, you're a bad judge of distance. Why, if he was the last man on earth, I wouldn't... - I wouldn't... - The last man? Maybe I'm taking in a little too much territory. EBEN: Who's the cause of all sickness? ALL: The Devil. EBEN: Who's the cause of poor crops? ALL: The Devil. - Who's the cause of all evil? - The Devil. - What did the Devil ever do for us? - Nothing. Not a thing. I'm going to take up a collection to fight the Devil. And I want you all to show me how much you hate him.   - Where's that music coming from? - That's Brother Eben and his flock. He preaches bad sass to the Devil. I was thinking if you won't be needing me, I'd like to go to that meeting tonight. - You can go after I'm dressed. - Yes, ma'am. Mr. Brooks sure been good to you. Wasn't you just a little bit nervous when he gave you all those presents? No, I was calm and collected. There was no reason for him giving me all those wonderful presents. I don't know him much better than I know Shakespeare. Shakespeare? I don't remember any Mr. Shakespeare calling on you. - That was before you came with me. - I see. It's gonna hurt, but I'm gonna give all those jewels back. RUBY: That is if I get them back. JASMINE: What? I'm saying I shouldn't have taken them in the first place. When it comes to refusing jewellery, I got about as much willpower as a flea... that's weak. JASMINE: All my life I've been looking for a man... that's big, handsome, and got plenty of money. What you've been looking for is three men. - Are you in love? - Uh-huh. JASMINE: What kind of husband should I get? Why don't you take a single man? Leave the husbands alone. RUBY: And that's one to remember. JASMINE: Yes, ma'am. I still don't understand why you is giving Mr. Claybourne all those jewels back. I'm going to stop this thing before it goes too far. I could like him very much. I don't think I'd make him happy. And people would talk. JASMINE: What could anybody say about you, Miss Ruby? People get reputations from people talking about people... when they don't even know the people. Yeah, saying things that ain't true. Give me my pocketbook. When you go to that prayer meeting say a little prayer for me. Yes, ma'am, I sure will. Here, put that in the collection, and be sure not to take any change. No, ma'am. EBEN:  Pray, children Pray, pray children and you'll be saved WOMAN 1: Preach it, brother, preach it. MAN 1: Tell it now, tell it now. EBEN:  Pray, children Bow down, bow down. WOMAN 2: Yeah, Lord, yeah, Lord.  Bow down, bow down. WOMEN: Tell it, now, tell it now.  Oh, I'm gonna drown down in those troubled waters They're creeping round my soul They're way beyond control And they'll wash my sins away before the morning They say that I'm one of the Devil's daughters They look at me with scorn I'll never hear that horn I'll be underneath the water Judgement morning Oh, Lord, am I to blame? Must I bow my head in shame if people go round scandalising my name? I'm gonna drown down in those troubled waters They're creeping round my soul They're way beyond control And they'll wash my sins away before the morning  Preach it, brother, preach it.  Oh, Lord, am I to blame? Must I bow my head in shame if people go round scandalising my name? I'm gonna drown down in those troubled waters They're creeping round my soul They're way beyond control And they'll wash my sins away before the morning EBEN: Are you a sinner? WOMAN 4: No, I'm not! WOMAN 5: Yes, yes! Hallelujah! MAN 2: Yes, my soul is God's. JOE: Come on, Tony, hurry up. We'll be late for the fight. All right, Joe. Come on, give me my furs. What are you doing there? Watching that gambling man. He may cheat on dice but he won't cheat on me. RUBY: You want him to be a good man. JASMINE: He is a good man. RUBY: You mean he's a good man. JASMINE:  That's it. Yes, ma'am. I hopes you enjoy the big fight. I will, if everything goes the way I want it to. I know you is dying for the Tiger Kid to win. That reminds me... Brooks Claybourne has been losing a lot of money gambling. RUBY: I want you to tell him not to bet on the Tiger Kid... because the only way to get even is to bet against him. Understand? - Yes. - Yes, what? - Yes, ma'am. - No. What did I just tell you? JASMINE: You want me to tell the Tiger Kid he can't win. No, no. JASMINE: I knows. You want me to tell Mr. Brooks to bet on the Tiger Kid. Never mind. I'll attend to it myself. - Go get my jewel case. - Yes.  Come in. ACE: I see you're all ready. RUBY: Yeah. Got the seats? In the Tiger Kid's corner. That's where you wanted them, isn't it? Betting heavy on him, ain't you? Never made heavier bets in my life. It ought to be easy money for you today. - Shall we go? - Yeah. Now, Ace, I want you to put these in a safe place. I've been robbed once. Oh, yes. I don't feel like wearing them and I don't want to take any chances. All right, I'll put them away. - All right. - Yeah. Just a minute. - Ready? - I'm more than ready. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen... the main bout this afternoon for the Championship of the World. In this corner, introducing the champion, Battling Burke. In this corner, the challenger, from St. Louis, the Tiger Kid. The referee.  SPECTATOR: Get in that fight.  You're doing swell, Tiger. - Got a lot of money on you. Get it over with. - Just a few more rounds. Give the crowd their money's worth. Sure, this is only the 27th round. Ace, give him time. Go after him fast this round, champ. You can nail him. Yeah, if I can find him.  Ruby, looks like a knockout.   - Give him the bottle. - Oh, Tiger. Ace, have you heard any more about my diamonds? No, I haven't, but I ought to hear something any day now.   What's the matter with you, Tiger? Get up. With only four seconds to go. Can you imagine? You could knock me over with a feather. I've got three down on him. BROOKS: Gentlemen, I was very lucky. MAN: I'll say you were lucky. Might've been different if Ruby Carter hadn't told you who to bet on. MAN: Glad I didn't bet any more. BROOKS: Thank you, gentlemen. MAN: I've got a few dollars left anyway. I'd like to figure this thing out. You're a smart guy, Ace, you ought to be able to do that.  - They're all here, Ace, waiting to be paid off. - All right. Hi, Ace. Hello, boys. I'll be down in just a moment. Too bad you lost, I feel sorry for you. That's the kindest thing you ever said. I'm starting to think you like me at last. I'm just starting to find out what kind of guy you are. - I wish you found that before. - Why before? - I'm desperate financially. - You mean you're broke? As bad as that if I pay off those fight bets. I have the money to meet them, but it'll clean me out. That could have happened to anybody. I've decided I won't hold the bank for that phoney fight. Why should I turn over all my money for some rotten bets I shouldn't have lost? What're you gonna do? With the money I have here in my safe, you and I could open up somewhere else. Now that I know you like me pretty well... I don't mind telling you, if I pay off, this whole thing will cost me $200,000. - Yeah? - Suppose this place was to burn down. Suppose it got out that all my money and assets were destroyed in the fire. No one could blame a man who couldn't pay off. - Pretty smart guy, Ace. - We could go to Havana. What do you say? I'll make you the queen of the gambling salons... clothe you with diamonds, lay the world at your feet. - You impress me. - You do like me, just a little, don't you? Come on, we got to get out of here. All right. You get everything packed. I'll be right back. RUBY: Jasmine. JASMINE: Yes? Pack my things. Mr. La Mont and I are leaving. You mean you're going away with Mr. La Mont? I'm surprised at you going away with him. I'm surprised you think I would. Why, the guy's no good. He never was any good, never will be. He was born that way. His mother should've thrown him away and kept the stork. Come on, let's go.  CROUPIER: Molly, Ace. Will you wait here, I want to talk to you in a little while. - What is it? - I just realised, I've neglected you lately. And I'm going to see that you get what you deserve. Later, dear. Never mind. You go and finish the packing. I got things to do. Yes, ma'am. You fellows are sure lucky dogs. But I'm a good loser. See the boys have a drink, will you? STOGIE: With pleasure. ACE: Make yourselves comfortable. I'll have your money in a few minutes. I must get it out of my safe. Excuse me. Go get yourself dressed. Get those bags down the back way. And have a carriage wait at the side door. - You sure seem different tonight, Ace. - Yes. Things are going to be different from now on, my dear. What're you laughing at? Don't laugh like that. It frightens me. I'm thinking how much easier I'll let you off than I did the others. You said you didn't want to be treated like them? All right. - I'll treat you differently. - What do you mean? I'll show you. No, don't run away. MOLLY: Ace, don't. Let me go.   Seems like a lot of things been going around here. I'm getting even with two guys that are so low, they could walk under the door... without taking their hats off. Let me tell you something. Don't let a man put anything over on you. Outside of an umbrella. Yes, ma'am.  Come in.  RUBY: Sorry you lost. I lost, but you ain't so sorry. I heard you did pretty good for yourself. - I always do. What's it gotta do with you? - Nothing. It's funny, you telling Claybourne to bet against me. I hear he bet some of your money, too. You're wrong. Whoever said that was misinformed. Tell him I said so, too. What do you know about that fight that I don't? - Why come to me? Ask Ace about it. - He wouldn't know anything. - Ask him why he's leaving the joint? - Leaving? - He's getting ready to clear out. - What's that got to do with it? - I'll smarten you up. - What do you mean? I'll tell you.  TIGER: You mean I was drugged? RUBY: Something like that. You remember when Ace gave you that water bottle? You know what happened to you right after that. Yeah, he did give me that bottle. Why, that dirty double-crosser. He ain't gonna get away with that. - Where are you going? - I'll get him and tie him in knots. Right this way. It's a short cut. - I've been robbed. - Yeah, I got robbed, too. And you did it. - What do you mean? - You'll find out what I mean. I'll show you how it feels to be knocked out, you dirty... ACE: Tiger, you're crazy.   He's croaked. And you did it. I didn't mean to do it. I knocked him down. I guess he hit his head. You're not only a thief, but a murderer. I got you where I want you. I'll have a ringside seat at your hanging and I'll wear these. Recognise them? Take a good look, it's the last time you'll see them or me, either. - I'm leaving here right now. - You got to listen. You're wrong. I saw you hand those rocks to Ace myself. TIGER: I didn't know it was you. I thought it was Molly. - It's a good story. - I didn't know it was you. - Keep it up and you'll believe it yourself. - Wait. I thought I was doing Ace a favour. He told me about a dame blackmailing him... I don't know why I want to believe you, but... - We got to get out. - I can't do that. - Why? - The law would catch up with us. I gotta stay and face it or I'll be held for murder. - It was an accident. You didn't mean it. - Nobody will believe that. Wait a minute.  TIGER: What's wrong? RUBY: That's Molly. See if he's got the key in his pocket. He was gonna burn her. I didn't think he was that cold.  Give me the fire department. TIGER: We got to go. RUBY: I'll be right with you. Take her down the back way. Yeah, the fire department. What? Do I mind holding the wire? No, I don't mind. I'm in a burning building. Yeah, Ace La Mont's Sensation House. Yeah, you better tell him. Because I got to go. I did the best I could.  Get back. FIRE CHIEF: Who is that? Ace La Mont. - Unconscious? - Dead. - Too bad, he was a great fellow. - Yeah?  JUDGE: By the power vested in me... and by virtue of the solemn promises you have here made, one to another... I hereby pronounce you man and wife. - Thank you, Judge. - I want to wish you a lot of happiness. - Good luck to both of you. - Thank you. And I want to wish you the same. I'm the best man. You're the best man, huh? That's what you think.   Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, HEY, MOM! WHAT IS IT, SON? LISTEN.

Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Isn't it time to stop this travelin', for it dark and the child shiverin'? We will not. And us not two hours, or maybe three, from Chicago itself? ""Ha, ha,"" says I. Get along with ya, ya lazy devils. I'll be layin' me whip on your backs. Chicago will not be movin'... and us living there for the rest of our days, God willin'. I'll not be held back by your tongue. A fine city waiting there just over the rim of the land. ""I'll rest there tonight,"" I said to myself. And so I will. 'Tis a mighty city will be built here. The hub. Yes, the hub of the country... fillin' all this prairie land... and you boys living to see it. Huh, indeed. Come on. Get along with ya. Look, Pa. It's a train. Come on, Pa. Let's race her. By the twinklin' stars of heaven, I will. - Come on, boys. - You'll do no such. Go on, Pa! You can lick it! We're licking it! We're licking it! Whoa! Whoa there! Hold on, boys! Whoa, boy. Whoa there. Whoa! Whoa, boy. Holy Mary, Mother of God. - Pat. Pat! - Pa. Pat. Jack, fix the water, quick. Dion, my petticoat, tear it. - Ma. - Shh! Dion, take off your coat and put it under his head. - Is he hurt bad? - How should I be knowin'? Pour a little water over his head. That's enough. Dion, get the whiskey. Never mind me. Are the rest unharmed? - Not a scratch. - Heaven be praised for that. 'Twas me own fault and no other. Ain't it the devil's own doin', though... to be draggin' me down and then bumping the life out of me? Just when the smell of Chicago's in me nose. Jack. Dion. Bob. Come closer here, the three of ya... and mind what I have to say. 'Tis a grand new place, this Chicago. And them that grow with it will be rich and strong... like I was always minded to be. 'Tis a boom, and you'll boom with it. Someday you'll be fine, big men... a credit to me name... and everybody speakin' with respect of the O'Learys... and how they grew up with the city and put their mark on it. You're wastin' yourself, Patrick. You with your fine talk. It's me last breath I'm usin', and I'll have me say. - Help me put him in the wagon. We've got to find a doctor. - No. No, it's no use. Just bury me here... and let Chicago come to me... that couldn't come to it. Molly... Patrick. - Patrick. - Ma! Holy Mary, Mother of God, help my Pat rest in peace... him that was so restless on Earth, for he was a good man... for all his fine ambitions. And if there ever was to be food to be got or shelter... or you wanted someone to laugh with or have a bit of a good time... you didn't have to look any further than Patrick O'Leary. But I need not be tellin' you all this... who know it better than I do. Amen. Get the horses ready, boys. Good-bye, Pat. Someday, I'll be sendin' the priest... to speak the proper words. Ma, I'll take care of ya. I'll do what he said. You know, about Chicago and... Sure, Ma, we'll take care of ya. I'm gonna make a lot of money and get ya things and... Hush it, the both of you. Get in the wagon. Giddap. Ho! Ma, we've gotta find someplace to stay. - We can't keep on living in a wagon. - Time enough for that. - It's a job I'm looking for first. - Look! There's a theater. Maybe I could get to be an actor. You an actor, and your father not cold in his grave. - But we've gotta do something. - It's school you'll be going to, the three of ya. School, at my age. Whoa. Look. Right under my very eyes. Wait here. I won't be a minute away. And keep your eyes off this picture... - and her in tights or worse. - All right, Ma. Gee! Look at them horses. Ain't they beauts? - Look. They're stuck. - Yeah, in the mud. Young man. I mean you. Could I bother you to assist us ladies to the sidewalk? I'm sorry, ma'am, but I got on my new store-bought pants. Whoa, boy! Whoa, whoa! Ladies, if me and my brother here can make a saddle, maybe we could get you out. - Saddle? - Yes'm, like this. All you gotta do is hold on. Why, that's marvelous. Ada, you try it. That's gonna be grand. Now mind your dress. Dion.! Jack.! - Up to The Hub. - We just slipped. You little brats! - I'll... I'll... - And who will you be hittin'? - Look at me! - A bit of mud, and it behind. A pair of tender hands and plenty of soap, it'll be as good as new. You don't know what you're talking about! There's not a washerwoman in this town that could save this dress. Is that so now? And what would you say if I told you... that I could do it myself, if it was worth me time? All right. You're so smart. You save this dress, and I'll give you... I'll be namin' the price, and you providin' the soap and the tub. Hey, Ma.! Ma, I'm back.! I got three from Gil Warren and two from Mrs. Palmer. - She says a pair of her whatchamacallems are missing. - Oh, she did? You can tell the fine lady she'll get 'em back when she pays for the soap she owes. - Yes'm. - And put up the horse. Give her some oats. And be sure the barn door's fastened. And then get your hands and face washed before it's supper. Yes'm. Gretchen. Ja? - Look out! - The milk! - It's gone! - Oh, it's all right. No use crying over it now. It's spilt. She might've kicked you. I told you never to milk her without putting that bar between her legs. That's what it's for. Daisy, you hussy! Mrs. O'Leary! What will she say? - Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it with Ma. - Ja? Ja. Aw, gee. Ja. Gut. - Thank you, Daisy. - Ma.! Ma.! - Out here, Jack. - I thought you were coming down to court to hear me. With all Chicago waitin' to be washed? Get along with ya. - Where'd I get the time? - I sure made 'em sit up and take notice. - Did you now? - I told 'em just what I thought about 'em. ""My client is right,"" I said, "" and you know it. But what do you care about people, as long as you can fill your pockets?"" No wonder they say this is the worst city, with politicians like Gil Warren running things. - And how did the fine gentleman like that? - Oh, he was sweatin' plenty. - "" Sure,"" I said. "" What do you care about Chicago being bad... - Take the handle. ""as long as business is good and you've got all the beef and pork in the world? ""But I'll tell you this. It takes more than those things to make this a great city. ""It takes people with some sense of decency... to make this not only the biggest city in the world, but the best. "" It's a fine silver tongue you ha'... and your father would be that proud of you. And I told him... Here you are! Well, good-bye, boys. Don't let 'em keep you too long. If you see my old lady, tell her I'm sitting up with a friend that was took sick. Have a cigar, Jim. Thanks for the ride. I'll do the same for you. Thanks, lad. Anytime you're coming our way, let us know. - We'll be glad to have you with us. - I'll remember that. Watch the mud on your shoes, Pickle. You know Ma. Hey, Ma! It's me! - Hello, Ma! - Howdy, Mrs. O'Leary. - Hi, Jack. - Hello, Pickle. - Sorry you lost your case, Jack. - Lost? Sure. I, uh... I forgot to tell you. The judge dismissed it. Heaven help me. And all the time I thought he'd won it. Don't worry. Warren won't hold it against you, as long as you lost. I heard about it. A fella said Jack had the courtroom hypnotized. Yeah, everybody but the judge. Had him too, only Gil Warren put him on the bench. Keep your hand away from that. But, Ma, it's just the right size. - Ma, for the last time, will you quit this laundry business? - Why should I be quittin'? 'Cause I don't want my best girl bending over a washtub all her life. - Go along with you now. - I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get you a new place, out of the Patch, set you up like the finest hussy in town. Huh? Look. Look, Ma. - Where did you get that money? - A fellow paid me. You're lyin'. You've been gambling at that racetrack again. There wasn't any gambling to it, Ma. There are only eight horses in the race... mine and seven others. - All we had to do was shoot the other seven. - Hmph! Huh, indeed. Come on, Ma. How about it, hmm? - I'll not be livin' on money that isn't honestly got. - Give us a kiss then, huh? - Now, Dion, get along with ya. I've got my work. Dion! - Aw, come on. Won't wash out. Look at it. I told that Gil Warren... I wouldn't wash any more tablecloths they'd been drawing pictures on. - Send it back. - Wait a minute. This looks like a map. Maybe Warren's gonna hunt for a buried treasure. Hunt for it? He's already found it in the city treasury. Something about Randolph Street... and... and Madison. This looks like the tracks for the horse car line. I know what it is. This means they're gonna run the car line along Randolph Street. You're crazy. They've already surveyed Madison for the tracks. Sure, they have. That's exactly what makes me think they're gonna run along Randolph. - By golly, maybe you're right. - Of course I'm right! That's the way they cheat the people... get them to invest on Madison Street... and then switch the line by their own property. - What an idea. - You're right. This information is worth a fortune. - Ha! Listen to him. - And I'm gonna get part of it. You with your fine talk and your grand plans... not a penny ever honestly earned to your name. Maybe so. But if I had this corner here... where all the traffic meets, I'd put up the biggest saloon in town. - Saloon? - And free beers to you, Mrs. O'Leary. I wouldn't be stepping my foot inside. Then I guess we'll have to keep on rushing the growler for you. Oh, but look. There's a name already scribbled in right on my corner. B- F-A-W-C-E-double ""T."" - B. Fawcett. - Ever heard of him? No. It's a new one on me. - Stop it! Stop it! Are you out of your mind? - I've gotta have this name. We'll go down to Gil Warren's and see what we can find out about this Fawcett fellow. - You've ruined it! - There was already a hole in it, Mrs. O'Leary. The scamp. Hello, Rondo. - Where's Mr. Warren? - The other end of the bar. - Hello, Mr. Warren. - Oh, hello, son. - Howdy, Mr. Warren. - What can I do for you? - I'd like to talk to you for a moment. - Sure. Go ahead. It's kind of private, and I thought that, uh... Not now. Not now. Little later, perhaps. Stick around. Glad to have seen you. Whew! - What a woman. - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. - Is she new? - Yeah, she's new, new as far as Chicago's concerned. She was the biggest hit Niblo's Garden in New York ever had. A sensation. And I'm paying her a bigger price... than any entertainer in this town ever got. - That's Belle Fawcett. - Oh, Belle Fawcett. B. Fawcett? Ladies and gentlemen, as an added treat tonight... the proceeds to go to the widow and orphans... or our late bartender, Aloysius O'Malley... who was shot in front of this very door... my little girls are going to give a special performance of our famous classic... Living Statues... an artistic divertissement straight from New York and Paris, France. And remember, gentlemen... it's all for sweet charity, and no tights. What am I bid? - One dollar. - One dollar? Do I hear two? - Four dollars. - Four, the gentleman says. - Who'll make it five? - I'll pay five. Five. Now we're getting somewhere. Who'll make it six? Speak right up, handsome. What is it? Six? I'll pay $100 to charity if Belle Fawcett plays Venus. We have a comedian in the house. - Go ahead. Take his offer. - Sold to handsome for $100. Come on. Let's see the color of your money. Fifty, 70, 90, 100. Whiskey! Right through that door. I'll be with you in a moment. Thank you. Hey, what's this? Wait a minute! Yes, Miss Fawcett. Your carriage is here. Will you tell Mr. Warren I'll meet him for lunch tomorrow at the Palmer House? - Yes, Miss Fawcett. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. - Oh! - Get in.! Let me go! - Shut up! - I won't! Let me out of here! - Shut up. - Let me out of here, or I'll jump! Go ahead. Jump. Oh, it's you. Driver! Driver! - No use yelling at him. I fixed him. - Oh, you're crazy! Maybe. But I was sane enough until tonight. Then I heard you sing, and something happened to me. Something swept over me I've never felt before or ever expect to feel again. - What are you talking about? - I'm in love with you, Belle. - Get out, or I'll call the police! - They can't stop me from loving you. Maybe not, but they can sure cool you off, brother. I know it sounds crazy... and I apologize... but it's true. Right now, my heart's pounding so. - Listen to it. Ow! - Oh, you fool. I'm trembling all over. And I wanna be calm and cool so I can make you understand. Say, are you on the level? Absolutely. - But I don't even know who you are. - Does that matter? It does to me. And I'll tell you another thing. - I didn't like that cheap trick you pulled on me. - I had to talk to you alone. What gave you the idea you could make love to me like this? Just give me a chance. I'll tell you the whole story. All right. You can stop here and buy me a drink. No, not here. It's too crowded. Since you've taken me by storm... the least you might do is to take me to your place so we can really talk. Very well, but your story had better be good. All right, George. You can drive to Miss Fawcett's home. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. - So this is where you live? - Yes. Way up there on the second floor. I think I can make it. Back to The Hub quick! Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Whew! What a woman. - Let's tell Ma. - Ja. You want to? Do you reckon she suspects? I was never that surprised in all me life. All this hand-holdin' and goo-goo eyein' and sighin' and gigglin'. I'm all wore out tryin' to look the other way. - Aw, Ma. - Now, I suppose you'll be tellin' me... you want to get married. - Why, sure. - You scamp. Takin' the best ironer I ever had. Well, if it's love you're after... I guess a few shirts and tablecloths can't stand in the way... but I won't have you sittin' around and waitin' and not eatin'. You'll be gettin' married right away and I want no back talk about it. Now, give me that pail. And I'd be ashamed, with a fine spring moon outside... and you in a barn puttin' ideas in the head of a temperamental cow. - So, you're in love at last. - Sure, Mike... with you. And are you now? And I suppose it's for me that you're slickin' your hair... anticipatin' yourself in front of a mirror until it's half wore out. Well, you want me to look nice, don't you? And I suppose you'll be holdin' her hands, maybe stealin' a kiss... and her tellin' ya how grand ya are and callin' ya pretty names. Here, let Ma do it. And you believin' her. That shirt! I thought so. Take it off. Oh, but, Ma, it's a beaut. Look. ""D.V.S.""... Who's that? His name is Swift and he sells pigs. Now take it off. - It needs to go back in the morning. - Oh, come on, Ma! Take it off. Take it off. Oh! Who's the best darn washer woman in the whole bloomin' city of Chicago? Ma! Say, Ma! I won my first case! - I knew you would! - Congratulations. The jury wasn't out more than 15 minutes... and the judge said it was the finest speech he's heard all session. So did the lawyer from the other side. And... yippee! Congratulations. I always knew you had it in your tongue. A fellow from the Tribune said he's gonna write it up. - You're gonna get your name in the paper? - Yes! - How much did you get? - Huh? - How much did you get? - You did get paid for it, didn't you? The fellow only makes $10 a week, and he's got a wife and a family. Ten dollars a week? That's just $10 more than you make. - I couldn't take his money, could I? - I give up. I've got one son that steals my laundry and spends his money heaven knows where... another a lawyer and wins cases and don't get paid for them. I should have brought the two of you up as Irish bricklayers, and every Saturday payday. Don't mind her, as long as she can keep her job. - Night, Ma. Don't sit up for me. I may be late. - Hmm. Huh, indeed. Where's he going all dressed up? Where is any of us going? And where is it all going to end? For one thing, we can be going in to supper. I wish you could have heard what that judge said. - That you, Miss Belle? - Yes. - Any messages for me? - No. Nothing except a heap more flowers and some champagne from that same gentleman. Lord, honey, you sure got him snortin' in his sleep. I hope you threw them out. I throwed out the roses, but you knows what a mess broken bottles make. Did you tell him not to come around here anymore? I done told him that till I'm black in the face. These corsets are so tight, I can hardly breathe. As long as the men folks likes a small waist, us gals has got to suffer. - You want anything else, Miss Belle? - No, thank you, Hattie. - Good night. - Good night. - You can call me early tomorrow afternoon. - Yes'm. Get out of here. - Get out.! - But listen... - Get out.! - I'll tell you, I wanna... - Get out of here! - Belle, I wanna talk to... - Get out.! - Listen, Belle. Don't act like that. - What do you mean by breaking into my place? - Don't be like that. - Don't act like that. I want to speak to you. - Get out of here! - Get out of here! Hey! Help! Help! - I want to speak to you. Hattie! Hattie! - You calling me, Miss Belle? - Hattie.! Help! Let me... Police! Murder! Help! Police! Police! Hattie! Let me go! Oh, you! - Now, won't you tell me what this is all about? - I love you, Belle. I mean, really. - Well... - I want the truth. - You have a piece of property on Randolph Street. - Of all the... I thought if you and I were to put up a place like Warren's... only better, more class... we could make a lot of money. But I really meant that about being crazy about you. Why didn't you say so in the first place? I'm a businesswoman. I'd have listened to any proposition... without all this foolishness. - You would've? - Of course I would. What a woman. Right through this way, Mr. Police.! Sorry, boss... but it looks like the fire's out. Now, look, Senator. Gil Warren controls... the Patch with all its votes. You need votes. Now, as long as Warren goes along... with no opposition, he has you and your interests just where he wants them. Who knows, but the day may come when Warren... gets other ideas that'd be embarrassing. - We have an offer to make you. - Now, I have the greatest... attraction that ever came to Chicago... Miss Fawcett. Now with your backing and your money to get us started... we'll open the greatest saloon Chicago's ever known... on the busiest corner in town... and I'll control the Patch... I'll tell 'em how to vote. And what's more, Senator, you see this floor? You see those real silver dollars that Potter Palmer put in there? Well, every month after we get started, Senator... they'll be 1,000 of those for you. What do you say? Are you in? I'm always in the market for marketable goods. Go ahead. Full protection for me, security for you and your family... and a hundred dollars in cash every Monday from now on. Young man, are you trying to bribe me? Why, Commissioner, how can you say such a word? Mrs. Kelly, good evening. Welcome to The Senate, and I hope you enjoy yourself. Good evening, sir. Good evening, Mr. O'Shaughnessy. Welcome to The Senate. Hey, you mugs, where do you think you are? Take off your hats. Keep on your coats and shake hands with the boss. - Where do you think you're going? - Now listen, shorty. You're taking the wrong ""altitude""... 'cause this is the only saloon in town I ain't been thrown out of. I'll give you just five minutes. I can do it in three. That's tellin' him. - Captain Jamison. - Captain Jamison, welcome. - And this is my daughter Ann. - Miss Colby. - How do you do? - How do you do? I've been begging Father to bring me here for the opening. - I'm glad he did. - It's marvelous. - I've never seen anything like it. - Thank you. - May I show you to your table? - Please do. Gentlemen, you give me The Senate, I give you Chicago. Father says you're the smartest young man in Chicago. That's because he knows I'll deliver the Patch on Election Day. He says you have a great future, as big as Gil Warren's if you do as he says. He's the boss, and one of America's finest. - And now... I must change my costume. - Allow me. I want to talk to you, my boy. I have some great plans in store. Surely not tonight, Senator, when you have so beautiful a daughter to entertain us. Father won't talk business if I ask him not to. Will you, darling? I can't imagine the senator doing anything that you asked him not to. That's right. She wraps me around her finger all the time. Uh, excuse me, please. - I'll be right back. - We'll expect you. He's nice-looking, isn't he? I mean, for someone from the Patch. - Hello, Warren. - Why, hello, son. - Mr. O'Leary. - Jim-dandy place you've got here. - Thanks. - Nothing like it in Chicago. I'm proud of you. - You mean, you're not sore? - Why, no. I've come over to bury the hatchet. Live and let live... that's my motto. - Come on. Have a drink. - Matter of fact, I wanted a word in private with you. - Oh, sure. Come on in my office. - See you in a minute, Rondo. Rondo, step up to the bar. Anything you want, on the house. Thank you, Mr. O'Leary. - How old are you, son? - Old enough to vote. Why? I was just thinking, you've come along mighty fast. When I was your age, do you know what I was doing? I was rounding up runaway slaves and practically starving to death. - Sit down, Gil. - Take it from me, times have changed. - Everything's youth today. - Well, you seem to have done pretty well, Gil. I've managed, but you've got a great future ahead of you. Mark my words. Well, I hope you're right. I don't blame you for taking Belle. She's a great woman. I'd have married her if I'd had the chance, but she never cared for me. - It was just a business deal, and you outbid me. - What's on your mind? What would you say, son, if I told you I was gonna close The Hub, quit? I'd say you were up to something. What is it? I'm thinking of running for mayor. Mayor? I've been electing them long enough. Now I'm going to elect myself, if you'll ride along with me. - How do I come in? - You're a smart young fella. If you watch your step, you're going to be a big power in this town. I could build a bigger place and give you trouble, but I've had all I want of this. - You say the word, and I'm through. - You close The Hub? Exactly, and give you an open field. Now, we either work together politically or fight it out. It's up to you. It's a nice place you have here, but, like a tinder box... touch a match to it, and it'll go off like a Roman candle. But what the devil? Chicago is big enough for both of us and more. Together we could run this town and run it right. You, Belle and me pulling together, it'd be a lead pipe cinch. Yeah. Sounds all right. But naturally there's a little expense involved, and right now with the... I took the liberty of bringing my check for $10,000. There'll be more between now and election time. I think we'll manage very well, Your Honor. Now I could use that drink you were talking about. Come on. Now, Belle, you've got to come to my table right now... and have a bottle of wine with me. I'd love to, but you'll have to excuse me for one minute. Belle! Hello. I thought I saw you come in here. I was just telling Dion what a great place you've got. I never saw you looking so beautiful. - I always did say she was the best looker Chicago ever saw. - Thanks. Better watch yourself, son. I'll get her back if I can. - But it looks like it won't be to The Hub. - Gil's closing The Hub for good. Really? Why? There's the music for your song. Better hurry. Dion'll tell you all about it later. Whew! What a woman. Yes, that's exactly what I said the first time I saw her. Remember? Oh, I'm... Miss Colby, Miss Fawcett. - How do you do? - How do you do? So sorry. You'll have to excuse Mr. O'Leary another few minutes. I'll send him back. - That'll be very sweet of you. - Thank you. - Is that the woman? - Why, yes, I believe so. She's pretty... in a way. - Women like her have all the advantage, don't they? - All except one. I wasn't thinking of marriage. - So you're taking his money? - What's the matter with his money? - The check's good, isn't it? - You know how he feels about us, the threats he's made... I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Ever since I left his place, he's schemed to get even. Now he's trying to do it with your own help. - He knows that if he's mayor... - What makes you think he's gonna be mayor? - But you took his money. - Sure. Sure, and I'll vote for him myself, if necessary... but I didn't say how the Patch'll vote. - Why, that's... - Politics. He'd knife me if he could, and I simply mean to beat him to it. Why, you dirty dog. - You love me? - Certainly not. Go on. Say it before I break your back. Who was that little doll-faced blonde you were smiling all over yourself about? Senator's daughter. I have to be nice to him, don't I? Why weren't you breathing down his neck? Stop it. You and The Senate and Warren on the run. In other words, Mr. O'Leary is rising in the world. Mr. O'Leary and present company. Chief, Mitch is here. Come on in and shut the door. Is it true that you were caught registering under a false name? Gee, chief, how was I to know that guy was already registered? I told you this bozo don't use his head. Oh, have a brain, you. Getting caught with an election coming up... and that reform crowd already yelling its head off. It would serve you right if I let them send you to jail for life... but, no, I've got to sit through a trial and figure a way to get you out. I oughta... Oh, get out. Yeah! Come on out! Now, where were we? Oh, yes. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Everything fixed? - The district attorney said if you're worried... he'll let us have witnesses to prove Mitch hasn't been in Chicago in two years. That's the kind of prosecutor I like. - What'd you give him? - The usual. Chief! It ain't fair! It ain't fair! - It ain't fair! - What's the matter? The district attorney... and after we had him all fixed. - What are you talking about? - Well, he fell down... and broke his ankle and he ain't here! - The fool doesn't know how to walk? - And the judge appointed... somebody to take his place and I don't know who. - What's this mean? - It means it ain't fixed. Oh, come on. In view of the unavoidable detention of the district attorney... the court has appointed a special counsel... a representative of the Election Reform Committee... in the case of The City of Chicago v. Edward Mitchell. Mr. O'Leary, are you prepared to proceed? - We're ready, Your Honor. - Oh, yes. - Is the defense ready? - Uh, Your Honor... Your Honor, certain matters have come up. New evidence have been uncovered that compels me to... Go ahead with the trial. - Go ahead? - Proceed. The defense is ready, Your Honor. You may proceed, Mr. O'Leary. Your Honor, it is no secret that multiple voting... for years has been a common practice... in that section of Chicago known as the ""Patch. "" So common, it has come to be regarded as one of the minor evils... in that district. Men who occupy the highest offices in this city... openly and brazenly bid against each other... for that very vote. Any mention of it is dismissed with an indulgent smile... as something that should not be talked about. There are men in this very courtroom, Your Honor... who control every election in this city... with such illegal votes. Men who sit in their fine saloons... surrounded by every luxury that money can buy... or that they can steal... while public officials bow and smile before them and fight for their favor. Until today, nobody has ever obtained sufficient evidence to convict them. Now, however, we have an eyewitness... who was actually present when the defendant, Edward Mitchell... was caught attempting to register under four different names... The last time, as the beloved Bishop Cornwall himself. You know, he's really good. - Some day he'll be a great lawyer. - I think he's all right now. Mr. Clerk, call Carrie Donohue to the stand. Carrie Donohue take the stand. - She can't do this to me. - Shh! Quiet! Stand up. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth... - so help you God? What's your name? - I do. - Carrie Donohue. - Sit down. - Miss Donohue, you know this defendant? - Do I know him? - Hmph! That big squirt. - None of that now. - I'll haul off... - Quiet! - Order in the court. - Refrain from personal remarks. Tell the court what you know about this man's registration. - Well, my gentleman friend's... - Face the judge. hired to watch the registration and I'm keeping him company... when this big squirt walks in. - Well, he don't see me and I don't say anything... but when he keeps comin' back, I get suspicious... and I'm just about to tell my friend that something funny's going on... when, sure enough, back he comes again... and, this time, he says he's a bishop. Well, that's too much even for me. Order in the court. - That's what you get for marrying 'em. - You married to this woman? - What? - Can you imagine it? - Ever divorce her? - No! - Your Honor! May it please the court, we ask that this woman's testimony... be stricken from the records... and this case dismissed on the grounds that the law says... a wife cannot testify against her husband! - That woman is my client's lawful-wedded spouse.! - Madam, is this true? - Well, I married him once, if that's what you mean... - but I can tell you... - That will do. - Well, I mean that he... - That will do. Well. Hmph. Mr. O'Leary, you distinctly told me... that you had had time to familiarize yourself with all the facts in the case... and, yet, you take up this court's time allowing your only witness... to testify, although she's clearly unqualified. Your Honor, I assure you, this is as much a surprise to me as it is to you. I ask the court's pardon. Case dismissed. - Tough break, kid. - Yeah. - Congratulations. - Aw, you can never tell about these women. They'll put it over on you every time, if they can... but you were great yourself, I was proud of you. Wait'll I go after the big fish, the higher-ups... - then you'll really hear something. - That's the way to talk. - How about meeting Belle? - It's about time. Belle, this is brother Jack. Jack, Miss Fawcett. - How do you do? - I've been looking forward to this for a long time. - You have? - Yes. Dion isn't the only admirer of beauty in the family. Thank you. - That was a very nice thing to say. - I couldn't help... but look at you all through the trial. Maybe that's why you lost your case. - Uh, can we drop you someplace? - Oh, no. No thanks. I've, uh... I've got some things to do here in the building. You know, it seemed kind of funny, you and Dion on one side... and me on the other, fighting each other. When we were kids, we were always fighting. I bet if any other Irishers tried to horn in... it was the O'Learys against the world. - Oh, you said it. - You two must've had fun when you were little. - We still do. - Even though we don't always see eye-to-eye. Well, I've got to leave you here... but I'll tell ya what you do, Miss Fawcett... - or shall I call you ""Belle""? - Please do. Let Dion bring you up the house some time for dinner, meet Ma. Well, I'd be delighted. I wanna show you some pictures of Dion... in his First Communion suit at the age of nine. And some of you without any suit at all at the age of six months. I wish you'd keep an eye on this fellow for us. He's getting up in the world so fast, it might go to his head. I'd kind of hate to have to knock it off. I'll try. Good-bye. See you soon. Good-bye, Jack. - You know, I like him. - They don't make 'em any better. That was nice of him, wanting me to meet your mother. Well, yes. I've been thinking about that myself. Oh, don't. I understand how she feels about me. Oh, Ma's all right... A little old-fashioned, perhaps. Oh, please. I had no idea he was so... so human. Oh, sure. Takes after me. You know, there's something almost normal about him. He just looks so real, you know he believes everything he says. Honestly, it just makes me sick to think of a man like Gil Warren... trying to run Chicago when there are men here like your brother. Can you imagine the mayor he'd make if he had the chance? Well, if he hadn't gotten mixed up with that reform crowd... Wait a minute. - I've got an idea. - What? I just thought what do with that check Gil Warren gave me. Back to The Senate. In brief, we've come here to ask you to run for mayor. - What? - We have canvassed the field, and you're the man we want. Well, this is all very flattering, gentlemen. May I... May I ask whom you represent? The respectable people of Chicago... citizens who want a new deal in our city administration. We're organizing a reform party. - I'm not sure I'm the man. - We're willing to take that chance. - It's a great opportunity. - Decent people are waiting for an honest program. You'll carry every district, except, perhaps, Gil Warren's Patch. I'm not so sure he won't get that too. Your brother's influential there. Surely he'll support you. I'm afraid you can't count on my brother. You see, we O'Learys are a strange tribe. - Then we'll win without the Patch. - Chicago needs you. - Yes, Mr. O'Leary. - Will you do it, sir? Thank you, gentlemen. I'll run. What did he say when you suggested that I would support him? He said he's afraid he couldn't figure on you. Well, at least he's agreed to run. That's the first step. What worries me is, can you control him once he's in? He's a pretty stubborn young fellow. You leave that to me. We O'Learys are a strange tribe. - How's that? - Not bad. Of course, it doesn't look much like you. ""Jack O'Leary, candidate for mayor. Reform ticket. "" That's a great thing for Chicago. I'd like to help. - You help me? - Sure. Why not? If other people say you're good enough to be mayor, I'm not going to say no. Of course, I couldn't support you openly. You know how I feel about the Patch. Oh, of course. No strings attached. - The fact you're my brother wouldn't mean a thing. - Stop arguing, will you? If you stood in the way of something I felt oughta be done... I'd go after you as fast as I would after anybody else, maybe faster. Because I'm in dead earnest. I see Chicago as a great city people can be proud of. I'd wipe out all this mushroom growth... start all over on a sound basis, with steel and stone. You don't have to make speeches to me, Jack. I just wanted you to know where I stand. - Well, how much do I owe you? - I'm two games up on you. Ah. Twenty cents. What a gambler. It's in the blood. It's in the blood. Say, why don't you get Belle and come to the house tonight and take her and Ma for a drive? - Ha! You know Ma. - We'll get a couple of beers under her belt. Well, heaven help us if it doesn't work out. - To His Honor, the future mayor. - To Chicago! And to herself, the first lady of the city! Oh, to the lot of you! - The compliments of the season to you, ma'am. - Oh, go on. More presents. You should see the grand house we're gettin' for you. Inside plumbing. - And a butler in short pants. - Heaven help me. It's himself. - Pa.! - It looks just like him. Sure got my nose. I can remember the day we took it like it was yesterday... and the trouble we had puttin' the collar on him. - Well, Ma, where are we gonna hang him? - Hang him? You'll do no such. He's gonna spend the rest of his days on this organ. If he only could have seen it himself. Isn't he beautiful? I want the baby to see it. Look, that's your grandpa. Aw, Pat, would you believe it? And Bob just a baby himself. If you turn out half as good as the blood that's in you, I'll not complain. You know, Ma, it looks like Pa had... sort of a roving eye for the ladies. I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head. Roving eye, ha! I'd like to catch him. Look. You're so good to me, the lot of you. You'll have me in tears. - Oh, Ma. Beer always did make you cry. - Listen to him. We'll play him a tune, his favorite one. - Come on, Ma, and play it. - Come on, the four of you. We'll show him a thing or two. The O'Learys against the world. The O'Learys against the world! - We will. Come on, Ma. You should've seen your father dance, as light as a canary... and stealing a kiss before you could shut your eyes. And the fair Molly Callahan loving it, I'm thinking. And why shouldn't I be loving it? Himself as fine a man as ever stood up with a girl in front of an altar. And that's what you should be doin'. - That's what I was telling him today. - Is it herself, you mean? I met Miss Fawcett. She's a fine woman. You oughta know her. Hmm. I will not. And her workin' in a saloon like any hussy. - Oh, that's not fair, Ma. We're living in modern times. - That's right. Don't forget, things have changed since you were a girl. This is 1870. Times may have changed, but I haven't changed. And I don't want any daughter-in-law that's the talk of the town... and kickin' her heels in the air for anyone to see. When you were a little one, no bigger than that, and me over a tub... I used to dream of the day when you'd bring me home a sweet one... and her all blushes, and present me with fine grandsons... as would be like sons of my own, only sweeter. It's my own life, Ma. Who'll have some more beer? - Me. - I wouldn't mind another drop. Here, Ma. Put a head on it. Good evening, Mr. Jack. Will you tell Mr. Dion his buggy's here? - Oh, thanks. - He'll be right out. Now, Ma, drink your beer and forget about it, and let's go for a ride, huh? Oh, sure. How about it, Ma? - That I will. - Oh, fine. I'll get your coat and hat. Aw, Ma. There you are. Drink it all, Ma. Come on, Ma. Now, First Lady, I've got a real surprise for you... two of the fastest fillies you ever sat behind. Now, close your eyes and get inside. Close 'em. Up one step. There you go. Inside. Ma, this is Miss Fawcett. This is Belle. - Hmm! So it's a trick. - No, wait a minute! You're going to meet Belle, so you might as well get used to the idea. - The devil I will. Let me out. - Ma, you always were so stubborn. If you don't stop it, I'll give you the licking of your life. - Well, you don't think I'm gonna ride with her! - Oh, come back here! Sit down! Driver, drive on! Drive on! Let me out! Let me out, I say! - Sit still! - Let me out! Stop it, I tell you! I won't be treated this way! You Irish lunkhead! What do you think you're doing? My son an Irish lunkhead? How'd you like to be treated? You with your grand manners. Just as any woman who's going to be his wife has a right to be treated. He'll never marry you. And now, if you'll stop, I'll be takin' my leave. - Stop here. - Whoa! - Wait. I'll get out. - You'll do no such. It's you who'll be saving the wear and tear of walking. - Ma. - Hmm! How could you? I'm sorry. I didn't think Ma would act like that. Take me home, please. My friends... this campaign has resolved itself... into one clear-cut issue. Shall the Patch run Chicago... or shall Chicago run the Patch? I promise you that if I am elected... the Patch will either be cleaned up... or it will be wiped out like that. Hooray for Gil Warren.! - Who said that? - Shh, shh. - Oh, it's a shame. - The trouble with him is he looks too honest. People never trust an honest man in office. Well, I wish he hadn't tried it. He'll never beat Warren. Never say never about politics. What are you up to now? Well, I was just wondering what would happen... if all Gil Warren's ward heelers and poll watchers and repeaters... failed to show up on Election Day. - What do you mean? - He wouldn't stand much chance of being elected, would he? George, drive to Commissioner Beavers'. Gil Warren's my friend. I won't do it. I can't. I won't do it! I can't! I'll be ruined forever. For doing your duty? Oh, come, come, Commissioner. Be a man. He'll kill me. Besides, what you're asking is against the law, against all my principles. You've been getting $100 a week for doing what I tell you. Every cent I got was in cash. Sure, I paid you in cash, but I always sent it by a different man. What? What do you mean? Those 15 or 20 people would make fine witnesses if you ever got any ideas. Blackmail, eh? All right. I'll fight. Go ahead. Fight. And you'll be back pounding the pavement so quick, it'll make your head swim. Come on. He'll be there. Hey, you! Where's your ticket? - I'm with him. - You know this guy? - I never saw him before in my life. - One of us is in error. Outside, before I cloud up and rain all over you. - That severs our relationship. - One of them Reform guys. They got no manners. Belle, when you were working for me at The Hub... I bet you didn't think you'd be having the first dance with the future mayor, did you? Are you counting your chickens before they're hatched? - It's a lead pipe cinch. - Oh. You looking for me, Commissioner? Hey, look what you done to my suit! - Hey, what's the idea? - Stop it! Stop them, somebody.! Stop them, somebody.! Stop them.! Ladies and gentlemen! The house is pinched! Stay back! Get back! You can't get out this way. Can you beat that? And just when we were beginning to have a little fun. You let me catch you with that Colby woman again, and you won't call it fun. Come on, come on. Inside. Inside. All right, take it away. - What about it, chief? - Yes, what about it? It's all right, boys. It's all right. You haven't got a thing to worry about. I'll have you out of here in no time at all. - What about the bail? - If it's bail they want, I've got it! Better hurry, chief. The polls are open already. Don't worry. You'll be at your posts in 30 minutes. All right. What's the bail? Sorry, Mr. Warren. Orders are to hold them 24 hours without bail... - On suspicion. - What kind of suspicion? - Suspicion of what? - Just plain suspicion. You can't do that. This is Election Day. They're my workers. By the Eternal, you've got to let them go! - It ain't up to me. - I'll get the commissioner! I'll get Senator Colby! I'll get my lawyer! I'll tear this town wide open! - Where's Commissioner Beavers? - Gone to the sanitarium. - What sanitarium? - I'm not allowed to give out his address. Doctor's orders. - Where's Judge Bender? - Oh, the jud-jud-judge... - I've got to see Judge Bender! - Judge Bender left... on a h-hunting trip this m-morning. All the jud-judges in town went with him. They're o-organizing a h-hunting club. - Then I've got to see Senator Colby. - I'm afraid that's imposs... You can't do it. See, S-Senator Colby... It's 12:00! The polls have been opened six hours, and I'm tied hand and foot! Every man in that jail controls at least 10 votes, enough to swing the election. - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna stop squawking. - What's that? - You're through. I've sold you out. Don't try anything, Warren. And now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go and vote for my brother. We O'Learys are a strange tribe. Look at him. You know, he really looks like a mayor. Gee, I bet Ma feels great. Dion, look at this! Huh. Huh, indeed. Belle, we're friends, aren't we? I hope so. I've got a proposition to put up to you. It may startle you at first, but I think you'll see my point. I'm gonna clean out the Patch. I want to be sure Dion doesn't oppose me. - And you want me to help you? - Exactly. But after all, what has it to do with me? You know how things are down there. Everything that's rotten in Chicago comes out of the Patch. The whole thing is an atmosphere of vice and crime. It's getting out of control, and I'm gonna wipe it out. How? The law gives us the right to condemn property. The courts will have it appraised and set a fair price. It's what they call the right of eminent domain. It's perfectly legal and fair. But all of Dion's money is tied up in The Senate. Mine too. That's what's worrying me. If he won't see it our way, there'll be trouble. I don't know what to say. Dion's a great person. He can go anywhere, do anything... if he only gets on the right track. Belle, I want to see him marry you... have a home and children, get something real out of life. Don't you think that's what I've been hoping for? That's what he wants too, if he can only see it. What do you want me to do? He couldn't stand a public investigation. You know how he operates in the Patch. I couldn't do a thing like that. Believe me, Belle... if I can't bring him to his senses any other way... I'll start an investigation that'll crack this town wide open. I'll use you as chief witness against Dion... let you tell the whole rotten story of how he operates in the Patch. How do you feel about that, Belle? I just wanted Belle to understand my position... same as I want you to understand it. - Dion, listen to Jack. - I heard him. I know now where he stands. You knew exactly where I stood before the election. I told you and I told the people of this city. - I elected you, not the people. - You? Sure. It was my idea. I sent that committee to see you. I paid for it, ran it, framed it, threw Warren's men into jail. I even voted for you. I don't believe you. Is that true? - Yes. - I just wanted it to look hunky-dory. Why did you want me to be mayor? Oh, a lot of reasons. I wanted to see if I could do it. Or maybe it was because I wanted to see the smile on Ma's face... when she rode with you in the carriage election night. All right. You elected me, but I'm mayor. Yes, you're mayor, but I'm Chicago. I'd hate to have to kick you out. Don't try it. A lot of people like what I'm doing. - What are you going to get out of this? - Nothing. But I happen to have sense enough to see what Jack's after, even if you haven't. - Now, wait a minute. Don't you two start... - You keep out of this! Well, of course, since you've gone for Reform... I guess we won't be seeing very much of each other. You're not gonna walk out on Belle like that. It seems that she's the one that's done the walking out. Dion. Dion! Oh! A grand jury investigation.! Terrible.! Terrible.! How did you ever get involved in such a mess? I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you weren't... in for a bit of sweatin' yourself, Senator. You've been milkin' the Patch for a long time. Me? Why I'll give you to understand, sir, that my life is an open book. Open or shut, brother, your shirttail's out with the rest of us. It's my daughter I'm thinking of. I'll have to take her to Europe, get her away from here. - The trip would do her good. - I'll have to ask you... not to see my daughter again ever. - To think I should be so deceived in the character... - I've always wanted to see... what a senator looks like... when he gets a good, swift kick in the pants. - Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you? - I'm hurrying, honey. Miss Belle, you want this old plush? Yes. No. Throw it away. I don't care what you do with it. Oh, this just fits in my trunk. Now, Miss Belle, ain't a bit of use in you carryin' on like this. - Ain't no man worth it! - Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you? I'm hurryin', honey. - Get out of here! - I'm gettin' out, honey. - Get out of here! - Belle, don't act like that. Belle, I want to talk to you. Hattie, get out of the way! - Get him away from me! - Get out of here, white man! - Hattie, help me! Help me! - Murder! Police! Help! - Get out! - Belle, please. I'm sorry, but I had to come. Just let me say one thing, then you can put me out. I won't care. - Oh, please go. - I don't ask you to forgive me. I've said and done things no woman could ever forgive. But you've got to believe I love you, Belle. I always have and I always will. Oh, why talk about it? But you said you loved me. That's over. You can't change in a moment any more than I can. We can't do without each other. I can. I'll make myself. Oh, we've fought, and maybe we'll go on fighting, but we'll do it together. We were meant for each other. Belle, marry me. Now. Tonight. I've got the license and the ring. We'll go to Jack, have him marry us. Will you, Belle? Oh, my darling! Come on, Mr. Policeman. Right in here. She... She's done backslid again. Do you realize that 75% of the buildings in the Patch... are made of pine? There are no sewers, no hydrants. Nothing but filth, cesspools. But worst of all, it is a veritable firetrap. Now, that sort of thing may have been excusable when Chicago was just beginning... but that time has passed. Today it's a menace to a great city... a cancer that must be cut out. Now, I propose to condemn the whole district... wipe it out and start all over again. Yes, what is it? Tell him I'll be right out. Will, uh, you gentlemen go ahead with the discussion... and excuse me for a little while, please? Yes, Mr. Mayor. Well, Jack, you've won. - I've won what? - I've been a fool. I wouldn't take a million for this moment. Now it's really the O'Learys against the world. Well, here's the little lady who's responsible. As if I didn't know it. As the mayor of this great and noble city, can you marry people? Marry? Why, sure! Wait a minute. I'm not so sure. But I'll find out. What a mayor. Is there anything in the charter about whether the mayor can perform a marriage? - I don't know, sir, but I'll find out. - Hurry up and find out! ""Having taken these pledges of your affection and vows of fidelity... ""I do, therefore, by right of the authority in me vested... ""by the laws of the state of Illinois... ""pronounce you, Dion Patrick O'Leary... ""and you, Belle Catherine Fawcett... lawfully married, husband and wife. "" That makes us kissing kin, doesn't it? - I don't have to tell you how lucky you are. - That's right. - I just want to say congratulations. - Thank you. I wish you every happiness and... good night. Congratulations. Good night. You'll never know how much all this means to me. Remember that day I told you he wasn't so bad? The O'Learys are a strange tribe. Right. Now, let's go home and tell Ma, huh? Sure, but first there's just one little matter I'd like to clear up. And now, Mrs. O'Leary, suppose you go ahead and testify against me? Listen to him. You didn't think I was gonna let you two get away with it, did you? - Why, Dion! - Go ahead with your grand jury investigation. She's my wife, and you know the law... A wife cannot testify against her husband. Oh! Belle, where are you going? What do you think of that? Why, you dirty... I haven't licked you since we were kids. Of all the low, disgusting tricks you ever pulled, this is the worst. Well, you won't get away with it. I'm gonna wipe out the Patch and you along with it! - Johnson! - Yes, sir. I've sent for the police. I don't want the police! Get the city attorney! Tell him to start the condemnation proceedings. And you get out of here! I never want to see your face again! Get the police commissioner. Tell him to swear in 500 special deputies. Get the newspapers. Tell them that when I get through with the Patch... - there won't be a stick or stone left standing. - Yes, sir. Hey, one at a time. Quit that nudging. You'd think you never been fed before. You're so full already, you oughta be sleepin' it off on the parlor sofa. Mutter, Mutter, komm schnell! Stop that heathen jabbering and talk sense! Dion, Jack, they fight! Bitte, Mutter, komm.! The devil you say! You can take one more nip while I'm knockin' their heads together. - Dion married Belle Fawcett. - What? Yeah, Jim Fellows just came by to tell us. Dion and Jack have had a knock-down, drag-out fight about the Patch. - And them grown-up and brothers. - I'm gonna find 'em. Wait. I'll go with you. And wait till I get my hands on that Dion... fightin' and marryin' that creature behind my back. Mrs. O'Leary! Mrs. O'Leary! Oh, Mrs. O'Leary! Your barn! Look! Look! I didn't put the bar between Daisy's legs. Fire! Fire! Get Daisy and the calf and the horse! Get that baby back into the house! Fire! Turn the alarm! Fire! Turn the alarm! Fire! Come on, boys! Never mind the barn! Let it go! Save the house! The house! Mrs. O'Leary, I'm gettin' out everything that I can. Mrs. Donovan, your own house is a-goin'! Me own house? Mrs. O'Leary, me own house is a-burnin'! - Get that cow! - Come on, Daisy! Come on! Get a hose over here.! Come on.! Giddyap. - Chief! - Dion! Here I am, Pickle! Dion, oh, Dion! - What's the matter? - There's a big fire in the Patch! - Yeah? Where? - DeKoven Street. The whole street's goin'! You suppose that's some of the mayor's doings? Sure. The mayor's burning us out. - He said he'd get us. - Said he wouldn't leave a stick or a stone standing. - Looks bad, boy. - Yeah, burning us out, huh? - Couldn't even wait for condemnation proceedings. - I'll go with you. No, you stay here. I've gotta find out how Ma is. Give the boys a drink. I'll be back in half an hour. He's asked for a fight. Well, I'll give it to him. Well, what'll you fellas have? - I'll take some of this. - Mighty funny business. - What? - Well, I'm not saying anything... but I haven't got much faith in these fights between brothers... not when they're O'Learys. They've pulled some pretty smart tricks in the past... and I wouldn't put it past 'em to do it again. You heard what Dion said! No one's gonna burn him out, brother or no brother. Well, I hope not. When I was running things, nothing like this happened. - Hmm! Come on, fellas. - All right, boys. You heard what he said. Spread the word. We'll have something to say about bein' run out of the Patch. Wait a minute. Get the boys together. - Tell them that I said we'll meet at the armory. - We'll get this Jack O'Leary! Back up! Back up! I've gotta get through! Back up! Here, I think I can make better time on foot. All right, boys! Put her on the other roof! - Mommy! - Mommy! Mommy! Mary! All right, boys, pump! It's moving might fast in this wind, leaping ahead blocks at a time. The Patch is like tinder. There hasn't been a drop of rain for nearly three months. We've got to keep it away from the gas works. We gotta keep it south of the river. Have you any suggestions, General Sheridan? Yes. Make a firebreak at the edge of the Patch. Blow up that entire section along Randolph Street. - Fight this fire with dynamite! - I authorize you to do everything possible to stop this fire. Commissioner, mobilize your whole force. Swear in as many deputies as you need. Clear that whole area. - Requisition all the foodstuffs you need. - Yes, sir. Donovan, you and Johnson get in touch with Milwaukee, all the surrounding cities. Ask them to send us all the fire apparatus they can. Wire Washington. Tell them we're gonna need relief... money, medicine, troops. - Keep me advised. I'll be with Gen. Sheridan. - Yes, sir. Miss Belle, pull yourself together! Come on, honey. Let's get outta here. Come on, baby. Pull yourself together. Let's get out of here before judgment day gets us. Come on, honey. Come on. Bob! Bob! Where's Ma? She's gone to the North Side with Gretchen and the baby in the wagon. They had to go. Our house was the first to burn. - Our house? Why, that dirty... Where did they start it? - In our barn. Ma heard about you fighting, she left the lantern in there and Daisy kicked it over. I thought Jack did it to burn out the Patch. That mob thinks so too. We gotta get to him. - Well, where is he? - I don't know, but we've gotta stop that mob. - Back up, I tell you! - How can I back up? Why can't you look where you're going? Get that flea-bitten thing out of here! Come, darling, get out. We have to walk. Wait! I'll just be gettin' it. I'll not be leavin' his picture. It's all I've got left. That fool cow! Look out! The wall! It's falling! Mutter.! - Gretchen! Gretchen! - Mutter.! Gretchen! Don't waste any time. Get those people behind the line. - Captain! - Yes, sir? Take all of your men you can spare. Use some of mine if necessary. Search every building. See that no one is left behind. No one! Quickly! Yes, sir. Sergeant, move all police lines back one full block and let no one through! Hey, where are you going? - I've got to get through to The Senate. - Nobody's going through. Mayor's orders. The streets cleared. They're gonna dynamite. - Dynamite? - Yeah, to make a firebreak. Come on, open up! Get back! Back to the next corner! - Come on. Back to the next block. - What are you gonna do? I don't know. Jack! Jack! Get back! Come on! - I've gotta get through.! - Jack! Jack, I... Turn him loose. I'll take care of him. Get away from here, you dirty, contemptible liar. I've stood for all I'm gonna stand from you. I've got work to do, and nobody is gonna stop me.! You've got to listen to me! Gil Warren and his mob are out to get you! Everybody down here thinks you set fire to the Patch. They're organizing against you. It's my fault. I thought so too. - You lowdown, good-for-nothing... - Jack! Until I got home and found the house burned to the ground... - Ma, Gretchen and the baby gone. - Where are they? I put 'em in a wagon and started them for the North Side. They oughta be across the river by now. I'm sorry. I should have known better. Jack, you've got to believe me. There's Gil Warren and his gang now. What the devil do I care about Warren and his gang now? The only thing that matters is that we're together and thinking alike. Come on! There they are, men! Just like I told you. The O'Learys. The three of'em together. You men, hold that line! Don't let anybody through. Keep those people back. I don't care how you do it, but keep them back! Right. Men! Listen! Listen, men! The fire was an accident. My brother didn't have anything to do with it. That's what you say, but we know different. We've got to dynamite. It's our only chance to save Chicago! Let it burn.! Men! Men! Think! That's just what we're doing. Thinking. Thinking it's another O'Leary trick. - Mayor O'Leary.! - Yes, General? Have your men move this crowd back to the end of that street. - The dynamite is set. We're ready to light. - All right, move that crowd! Push them back! Get 'em back! Oh, no, you don't! We're not moving! No one's running us out. We got rights too, and we know where we stand. You're not gonna blow us up. You don't dare. We're not gonna let 'em destroy our homes to save their own. We're staying right here. We'll show 'em who they're dealing with. They don't own Chicago. They're... What? Hey.! Look.! Look.! Stop him, somebody.! Dion! Dion! Don't move an inch, men. We've got our rights. - Dion! - Jack, light 'em. Light 'em! - You're hurt. - It's just a scratch. Get back, you fools! All of you! And keep back! Light 'em. Dion! Dion! Get back, and keep back.! Get him, Rondo.! Rondo, get him.! Get him, Rondo.! Get those fuses out.! Pull 'em down.! Pull 'em down.! Get 'em down.! We're too late! We're too late! Run for your lives, men! - We can't put 'em out.! - Run for your lives! Where's Jack? Jack! Open up! Help! Help! Help! On to the lake, folks! Cast off! Let go of that forward line and get this boat away from here! There's 10,000 barrels of kerosene in that warehouse. If this boat catches fire, the warehouse is sure to go... and we'll take the whole North Side with us! Try to get through to the North Side! On to the lake.! Bob.! Bob.! Bob.! That's Gretchen! - Bob! - Gretchen.! Bob! Gretchen! - Bob.! - Gretchen! Bob! Bob! Gretchen! Take your foot off that picture! Oh! Mrs. O'Leary! I thought I saw you. Lean on me. - Go on. Save yourself. - Please, Mrs. O'Leary. - Oh, it's you. - Give me your arm. - I will not. - You'll be killed! I'll not be owing my life to you! Hattie! Hattie! Hattie! Come on. Get up, please. Please. Come on. Come on. - Go on and save yourself. - I won't leave you. Hattie! Hattie! - You married him. - Hattie! I married him, but it's all over now. He only married me to save the Patch. You're lyin'. He loves you, and you turned him against his own people. - He doesn't love me. - But you love him. Hattie! Yes. Yes, I love him. - Try, Mrs. O'Leary. - I can't do it. - Please. - No, it's no use. I'm done for. Please help me. Please help me, won't you? Won't you, please? Dion, any word of them? No. No, I've been all over the North Shore. There's not a trace of them. You stay with Gretchen. I'll look. No. I'm gonna try the South Shore. Mommy! Mommy.! Mommy.! Mommy.! Mommy.! Ma. Ma! Ma! Ma! Heaven be praised! It's Dion! Oh, Dion! - Oh, Ma! - Dion! - Oh, Ma! - Oh, Dion, Dion! - Ma! - Are you hurt? Come on. Come on up out of the wet. - Oh, my child. - Ma. Where are the others? Bob and Gretchen and the baby are all right. And Jack? Oh, Ma. He's dead? - Did you make it up with him? - Yes. Then I'll not be weepin'. It's the livin' that need lookin' after. Belle... - Belle? - What kind of a woman are you... with that kind of a heart and him your husband? It's gone, and my boy's gone with it. But what he stood for will never die. It was a city of wood, and now it's ashes. But out of the fire will be coming steel. You didn't live to see it, my lad... no more than your father did before you. God rest the two of you. But there's Dion left, and his children to come after. He'll have his dream, Ma. Nothing can lick Chicago, any more than it could lick him. Aye. That's the truth. We O'Learys are a strange tribe. There's strength in us. And what we set out to do, we finish. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, She isn't coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto. Aunt Em! Aunt Em! Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto... Dorothy, please. We're counting. - But she hit him... - Don't bother us now, honey. The incubator's gone bad and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks. Oh, that poor little thing. But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake... ...because she says he chases her nasty old cat every day! - Seventy. Dorothy, please! But he doesn't do it every day! Just once or twice a week. He can't catch her old cat anyway. - And now she says she's gonna... - Dorothy. Dorothy, we're busy. Oh, all right. How's she coming? Take it easy. Ow! You got my finger! Get your finger out of the way. There you are. Right on my finger! Lucky it wasn't your head. Zeke, what am I gonna do about Miss Gulch? Just because Toto... Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in. Dorothy, you ain't using your head. You'd think you didn't have any brains. - I have so got brains. - Well, why don't you use them? Don't go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble, see? Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all. Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know. Say, get in there before I make a dime bank out of you. Listen, kid... ...are you gonna let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you? She ain't nothing to be afraid of. Have a little courage. I'm not afraid of her. Next time she squawks, walk up to her and spit in her eye. - That's what I'd do. - Oh! Oh! Oh! Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here! Help! Oh! Oh! Are you all right, Dorothy? - Yes, I'm all right. I fell in, and Zeke... Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am. You gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you? Look at you... What's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done? I know three farm hands that'll be out of a job. Dorothy was... I saw you tinkering with that contraption. - You and Hunk get back to that wagon. All right. But someday they'll erect a statue to me... Well, don't start posing for it now. Can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers. Gosh, Mrs. Gale. Just fried. You see, Dorothy toppled into the... It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty! Feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia! - Yes. - Auntie Em... ...you know what Miss Gulch said she was going to do to Toto? - She said she'd... Stop imagining things. You always get in a fret over nothing. You just help us out today... ...and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble. Someplace where there isn't any trouble. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away. Behind the moon... ...beyond the rain... Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds Are far behind me Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll... ...find me Somewhere over the rainbow Bluebirds fly Birds fly over the rainbow Why then... ...oh, why can't I? If happy little bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow Why, oh, why... ...can't I? Mr. Gale. Howdy, Miss Gulch. I want to see you and your wife about Dorothy. - What has Dorothy done? - What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg! - You mean, she bit you? - No, her dog! Oh, she bit her dog, eh? No. That dog's a menace. I'm taking him to make sure he's destroyed. Destroyed! Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you? Of course we won't. Uh, will we, Em? Please, Aunt Em! Toto didn't know he was doing anything wrong. I'm the one that ought to be punished. Send me to bed without supper. Hand over that dog or I'll bring a suit that'll take your farm! The law protects folks against dogs that bite! How about if she keeps him tied up? He's gentle. - With gentle people, that is. - That's for the sheriff to decide. This order allows me to take him. Unless you wanna go against the law. Hm. Yes. We can't go against the law. I'm afraid poor Toto has to go. - Now you're seeing reason. - No. Here's what I'm taking him in, so he can't attack me again. No, No! I won't let you take him! - You go away or I'll bite you myself! Dorothy! You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto. I've got an order! - Let me have him! - Please stop! Put him in the basket, Henry. - The idea! - Don't, Uncle Henry. Oh, Toto! Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county... ...doesn't mean you can run the rest of us! For 23 years I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you! And now... Well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it! Toto, darling! Oh, I got you back! You came back! I'm so glad! They'll be coming back for you in a minute. We've got to get away! We've got to run away! Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh? And who might you be? No, no. Now, don't tell me. Let's see. You're... You're traveling in disguise. No, that's not right. You're... You're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we... You're... You're running away. How did you guess? Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows. Now, why are you running away? No, no. Now, don't tell me. They... They don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands. Big cities, big mountains, big oceans. Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me. Toto, that's not polite! We haven't been asked yet. Oh, he's perfectly welcome. As one dog to another, huh? Now, let's see, where were we? Why can't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of Europe? Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing. Yes. Well, uh, I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's go inside here. We'll... Just come along. I'll show you. That's right. Here. Sit right down here. That's it. This is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal... ...used by the priests of Isis and Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs... ...in which Cleopatra saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony. And so on, and so on. Now... ...you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment... ...in order to be better in tuned with the Infinite. We can't do these things without reaching out into the Infinite. Yes, that's all right. Now you can open them. We'll gaze into the crystal. Ah. What's this I see? A house with a picket fence... ...and a barn with a weathervane... ...of a running horse. - That's our farm! - Yes. Yes. There's a woman. She's wearing a polka-dot dress. Her face is careworn. That's Aunt Em. Yes. Her name is Emily. That's right. What's she doing? Well, I can't quite see. Why, she's crying. Someone has hurt her. Someone has just about broken her heart. Me? Well, it's... It's someone she loves very much. Someone she's been very kind to. Someone she's taken care of in sickness. I had the measles once, and she stayed right by me every minute. Uh-huh. What's she doing now? Yes, she's... What's this? Why, she's putting her hand on her heart! - She's dropping down on the bed. - Oh, no, no! Well, that's all. The crystal's gone dark. You don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? - Oh, I've gotta go home right away. - I thought you were going with me. No, I have to get to her right away! Come on, Toto! Come on! Goodbye, Professor Marvel. And thanks a lot! Better get under cover, Sylvester. A storm's blowing up. A whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry. Poor little kid. I hope she gets home all right. Get them horses loose! Where's Hickory? Hickory? Doggone it! It's a twister! It's a twister! Dorothy! Everybody in the storm cellar! Henry, I can't find Dorothy! She's out in the storm! We can't look for her now. Come on, get in the cellar! Hurry up! Auntie Em! Auntie Em? Auntie Em! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! Auntie Em! We must be up inside the cyclone! Oh! Miss Gulch! Oh! Toto... ...I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. We must be over the rainbow! Now I know we're not in Kansas. Are you a good witch or a bad witch? Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. - I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas. - Oh. Well, is that the witch? Who, Toto? Toto's my dog. I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch... ...just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are... ...and that's all that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East. What the Munchkins want to know is, are you a good witch or a bad witch? But I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all. Witches are old and ugly. What was that? The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North. You are? Oh, I beg your pardon! But I've never heard of a beautiful witch before. Only bad witches are ugly. The Munchkins are happy because you freed them... ...from the Wicked Witch of the East. - But if you please, what are Munchkins? The little people who live here. It's Munchkinland... ...and you are their national heroine, my dear. It's all right. You may all come out and thank her. Come out, come out Wherever you are And meet the young lady Who fell from a star She fell from the sky She fell very far And Kansas, she says Is the name of the star Kansas, she says Is the name of the star She brings you good news Or haven't you heard? When she fell out of Kansas A miracle occurred It really was no miracle What happened was just this The wind began to switch The house to pitch And suddenly the hinges Started to unhitch Just then the Witch To satisfy an itch Went flying on her broomstick Thumbing for a hitch And oh, what happened then was rich The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch It landed on the Wicked Witch In the middle of a ditch Which was not a healthy situation For the Wicked Witch The house began to pitch The kitchen took a slitch It landed on the Wicked Witch In the middle of a ditch Which was not a healthy situation For the Wicked Witch Who began to twitch And was reduced to just a stitch Of what was once the Wicked Witch We thank you very sweetly For doing it so neatly You've killed her so completely That we thank you very sweetly Let the joyous news be spread!

I thought you said she was dead. That was her sister, the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West. She's worse than the other one was. Who killed my sister? Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? No. No, it was an accident. I didn't mean to kill anybody. Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents too! - Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers? - The slippers. Yes! The slippers! They're gone! The ruby slippers! What have you done with them? Give them back to me or I'll... It's too late! There they are, and there they'll stay! Give me back my slippers! Only I know how to use them. They're of no use to you. Give them back to me. Give them back! Keep tight inside of them. Their magic must be powerful... ...or she wouldn't want them so badly. Stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well! Oh, rubbish! You have no power here. Begone, before somebody drops a house on you too. Very well. I'll bide my time. And as for you, it's true I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like. But just try to stay out of my way! Just try! I'll get you, my pretty... ...and your little dog too! It's all right. You can get up. She's gone! It's all right. You can all get up. Oh! What a smell of sulfur! I'm afraid you've made an enemy of the Wicked Witch. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear. Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether. But which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came. No, that's true. The only person who might know... ...would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself. The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked? Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you? - No, I'm afraid I didn't. - Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment... ...or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West. But how do I start for Emerald City? It's always best to start at the beginning. And all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road. - But what happens if I... - Just follow the Yellow Brick Road. Goodbye! My! People come and go so quickly here! Follow the Yellow Brick Road Follow the Yellow Brick Road? Follow the Yellow Brick Road Follow the Yellow Brick Road Follow the Yellow Brick Road Follow, follow, follow, follow Follow the Yellow Brick Road Follow the Yellow Brick Follow the Yellow Brick Road You're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was If ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because Because, because, because Because, because Because of the wonderful things he does You're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz Follow the Yellow Brick Road? Follow the Yellow...? Now which way do we go? Pardon me! That way is a very nice way. Who said that? Don't be silly, Toto. - Scarecrows don't talk. - It's pleasant down that way too. That's funny. Wasn't he pointing the other way? Of course, people do go both ways. Why, you did say something, didn't you? Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind? That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind. I haven't got a brain. Only straw. How can you talk if you haven't got a brain? I don't know. But some people without brains do a lot of talking, don't they? Yes, I guess you're right. Well, we haven't really met properly, have we? Why, no. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Very well, thank you. - Oh, I'm not feeling at all well. It's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back. Oh, dear. That must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down? Down? No, you see, I'm... Well, I'm... Oh, well, here. Let me help you. Oh, that's very kind of you. Very kind. Oh, dear. I don't see... Of course, I'm not bright about doing things... ...but if you'll just bend the nail down, maybe I'll slip off and... Oh, yes! Whoops! - There goes some of me again! - Does it hurt you? Oh, no. I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again. My! It's good to be free! Did I scare you? No, no. I just thought you hurt yourself. - But I didn't scare you? - No, of course not. I didn't think so. Boo! Scat! Boo! You see? I can't even scare a crow. They come from miles around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face. Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got a brain! Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one? Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could... I could while away the hours Conferring with the flowers Consulting with the rain And my head I'd be scratchin' While my thoughts were busy hatchin' If I only had a brain I'd unravel every riddle For any individ'le In trouble or in pain With the thoughts you'd be thinkin' You could be another Lincoln If you only had a brain Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near the shore I could think of things I never thunk before And then I'd sit And think some more I would not be just a nothin' My head all full of stuffin' My heart all full of pain I would dance and be merry Life would be a ding-a-derry If I only had a brain Whoa! Wonderful! Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas could do that... ...the crows would be scared to pieces! - They would? - Where's Kansas? - That's where I live. I wanna get back there so badly, I'm going to Emerald City... ...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me. - You're going to see a wizard? - Mm-hmm. Do you think if I went, this wizard would give me brains? I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now. - Yes, that's true. - But maybe you better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble. Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything! - Except a lighted match. - I don't blame you for that. But I'd face a whole box of them for the chance of getting some brains. Look, I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing. And I won't try to manage things, because I can't think. Won't you take me with you? Why, of course I will! Hooray! We're off to see a wizard! You're not starting out very well. Oh, I'll try! Really, I will. - To Oz? - To Oz! We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz We hear he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was If ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because Because, because, because Because, because Because of the wonderful things he does We're off to see the wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz Oh. Apples! Oh, look! Oh! Ouch! What do you think you're doing? We've been walking a long ways and I was hungry and... Did you say something? - She was hungry! She was hungry! How would like to have someone come along and pick something off of you? Oh, dear! I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas. Come along, Dorothy. You don't want any of those apples. Hmm. Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be? Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green worms. Oh, you! I'll show you how to get apples. Oh! Oh! Hooray! I guess that did it. Help yourself. Why, it's a man! A man made out of tin! Yes! Look! Did you say something? He said ""oilcan. "" - Oil can what? - Oilcan? Oh, here it is. Where do you want to be oiled first? He said his mouth. The other side. Mm... Mm... Mm... My goodness! I can talk again! Oh! Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows. Here. - Did that hurt? - No, it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Goodness! How did you ever get like this? Well, about a year ago... ...I was chopping that tree... ...when suddenly it began to rain. And right in the middle of a chop, I rusted solid. And I've been that way ever since. Well, you're perfect now. My neck. My neck. Perfect? Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead, bang on it! Beautiful! What an echo! It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart. - No heart? - No heart? No heart. All hollow. When a man's an empty kettle He should be on his mettle And yet I'm torn apart Just because I'm presumin' That I could be kind of human If I only had a heart I'd be tender, I'd be gentle And awful sentimental Regarding love and art I'd be friends with the sparrows And the boy who shoots the arrows If I only had a heart Picture me A balcony Above, a voice sings low Wherefore art thou, Romeo? I hear a beat How sweet! Just to register emotion Jealousy, devotion And really feel the part I could stay young and chipper And I'd lock it with a zipper If I only had a heart Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! - Are you all right? - I'm a little rusty yet. Oh, dear! That was wonderful! You know, we were wondering why you couldn't come with us... ...to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart. Suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there. Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already. You call that long? Why, you've just begun! Helping the little lady along, are you, my fine gentlemen? Well, stay away from her... ...or I'll stuff a mattress with you! And you! I'll use you for a beehive! Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball? Fire! I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get safely to the Wizard, whether I get a brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me! I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart or not. Beehive! Bah! Let her try and make a beehive out of me. Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had. And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time. - But I couldn't have, could I? - I don't see how. You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you? And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time. Still, I wish I could remember. But I guess it doesn't matter anyway. We know each other now, don't we? - That's right. - We do. - To Oz? - To Oz! We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz We hear he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was If ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because Because, because, because Because, because Because of the wonderful things he does We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz I don't like this forest. It's dark and creepy. Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter. Do... Do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals? We might. Animals that eat straw? Some, but mostly lions and tigers and bears. - Lions! - And tigers? And bears! Lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my! Lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my! Lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my! Oh! Put 'em up! Put 'em up! Which one of you first? I'll fight you both together, if you want. I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back! I'll fight you standing on one foot! I'll fight you with my eyes closed! Oh, pulling an ax on me, eh? Sneaking up on me, eh? Why... - Here, here. Go away and let us alone. - Oh, scared, huh? Afraid, huh? How long can you stay fresh in that can? Come on, get up and fight, you shivering junkyard. Put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay! That's getting personal, Lion. Yes, get up and teach him a lesson. What's wrong with you teaching him? Well, I hardly know him. Well, I'll get you anyway, peewee. Shame on you! What did you do that for? I didn't bite him. No, but you tried to. It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but picking on poor little dogs... Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? Is my nose bleeding? Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making! Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are... You're nothing but a big coward! You're right, I am a coward! I haven't any courage at all. I even scare myself! Look at the circles under my eyes. I haven't slept in weeks. Why don't you try counting sheep? That doesn't do any good. I'm afraid of them. Oh, that's too bad. Don't you think the Wizard could help him too? I don't see why not. Come along with us. We're on our way to see the Wizard. To get him a heart. - And him a brain. - He could give you some courage. Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion? I would. No, of course not. Gee, that's awfully nice of you. - My life has been simply unbearable. - Oh. Well, it's all right now. The Wizard'll fix everything. It's been in me so long. I just gotta tell you how I feel. Well, come on! Yeah, it's sad, Believe me, missy When you're born to be a sissy Without the vim and verve But I could show my prowess Be a lion, not a mouse If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dandy lion A fate I don't deserve - I'd be brave as a blizzard - I'd be gentle as a lizard I'd be clever as a gizzard If the Wizard is a wizard Who will serve Then I'm sure to get a brain - A heart - A home The nerve! Oh We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz We hear he is a whiz of a wiz If ever a wiz there was If ever, oh ever a wiz there was The Wizard of Oz is one because Because, because, because Because, because Because of the wonderful things he does We're off to see the Wizard The wonderful Wizard of Oz So you won't take warning, eh? All the worse for you, then. I'll take care of you now instead of later! When I gain those ruby slippers... ...my power will be the greatest in Oz! And now, my beauties... ...something with poison in it, I think. With poison in it. But attractive to the eye and soothing to the smell! Poppies. Poppies! Poppies will put them to sleep. Sleep... Now they'll sleep. There's Emerald City! Oh, we're almost there! At last! At last! It's beautiful, isn't it? Just like I knew it would be. He really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that. Come on, what are we waiting for? Nothing! Let's hurry! Yes, let's run! - Come on! Come on! - Hurry! Hurry! Oh, look! Come on! Come on! Look at the scenery. It's wonderful! Emerald City! Oh. What's happening? What is it? I can't run anymore. - I'm so sleepy. - Give us your hands and we'll pull you. Oh, no, please. I have to rest for just a minute. Toto. Where's Toto? You can't rest now. We're nearly there. Don't cry. You'll rust yourself again! Coming to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad. - Don't you start it too! - No! We ought to carry Dorothy. I don't think I could, but we could try. - Let's. - Yes. - Now look at him. This is terrible! - Here, Tin Man, help me. Oh, this is terrible! I can't budge her an inch. This is a spell, this is! It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do? Help! Help! It's no use screaming at a time like this. Nobody will hear you! Help! Help! Help! It's snowing! No, it isn't. Yes, it is! Maybe that'll help! Oh, but it couldn't help! It does help! Dorothy, you're waking up! Oh. Oh. Unusual weather we're having, ain't it? Look! He's rusted again. - Oh, give me the oilcan, quick! Here. - He is rusted. Here. Here. Quick! Oh! Oh! Curses! Curses! Somebody always helps that girl. But shoes or no shoes, I'm still great enough to conquer her. And woe to those who try to stop me! Come on, let's get out of here. Look! Emerald City is closer and prettier than ever! You're out of the woods You're out of the dark You're out of the night Step into the sun Step into the light Keep straight ahead for The most glorious place On the face of the earth Or the sky Hold on to your breath Hold on to your heart Hold on to your hope March up to the gate And bid it open To the Emerald City, as fast as lightning! You're out of the woods You're out of the dark You're out of the night Step into the sun Step into the light March up to the gate And bid it... ...open Open Who rang that bell? We did! - Can't you read? - Read what? - The notice! What notice? - It's on the door! As plain as the nose on my face! Oh... Uh... Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk. ""Bell out of order. Please knock. "" Well! That's more like it! Now, state your business. We wanna see the Wizard. The Wizard? But nobody can see the great Oz. Nobody's ever seen the great Oz! Even I've never seen him! Well, then, how do you know there is one? Because he's... Oh! You're wasting my time! Oh, please. Please, sir. I've got to see the Wizard. - The Good Witch of the North sent me. - Prove it! She's wearing the ruby slippers that she gave her. Oh! So she is! Well, bust my buttons! Why didn't you say that in the first place? That's a horse of a different color! Come on in! Cabby! Cabby! Just what you're looking for. Take you any place in the city, we does. - Would you take us to see the Wizard? - The Wizard? The Wizard? Yes, of course. But first I'll take you to a little place... ...where you can tidy up a bit. - Oh, thank you so much! We've been gone such a long time, and we feel so mess... What kind of a horse is that? I've never seen a horse like that before! No, and never will again, I fancy. There's only one of him, and he's it. He's the horse of a different color you've heard tell about. Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho! And a couple of tra-la-las That's how we laugh the day away In the merry old land of Oz Bzz, bzz, bzz! Chirp, chirp, chirp! And a couple of la-di-das That's how the crickets crick all day In the merry old land of Oz We get up at twelve And start to work at one Take an hour for lunch And then at two we're done Jolly good fun! Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho! And a couple of tra-la-las That's how we laugh the day away In the merry old land of Oz Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! That's how we laugh the day away With a Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha-ha! In the merry old land of Oz Pat, pat here Pat, pat there And a couple of brand-new straws That's how we keep you young and fair In the merry old land of Oz Rub, rub here Rub, rub there Whether you're tin or bronze That's how we keep you in repair In the merry old land of Oz We can make a dimpled smile Out of a frown Can you even dye my eyes To match my gown? - Uh-huh Jolly old town! Clip, clip here Clip, clip there We give the roughest claws That certain air of savoir-faire In the merry old land of Oz That's how we laugh the day away In the merry old land of Oz That's how we laugh the day away With a ha-ha-ha In the merry old land of Oz Who's her? Who's her? It's the witch! She's followed us here! ""Surrender, Dorothy. "" Dorothy? Who's Dorothy? - The Wizard will explain it! - To the Wizard! Dear! Whatever shall we do? We better hurry if we're gonna see the Wizard! Here! Here, here! Everything is all right. Stop that now, just... It's all right! Everything is all right! The great and powerful Oz has got matters well in hand. I hope. So you can all go home! There's nothing to worry about! Get out of here. Now go on! Go on home. Go home. We want to see the Wizard right away. All four of us. Orders are, nobody can see the great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow! But, please! It's very important. I got a permanent just for the occasion. Not nobody, not nohow! But she's Dorothy! The witch's Dorothy? Well, that makes a difference. Just wait here. I'll announce you at once. Did you hear that? He'll announce us at once. - I've as good as got my brain. - I can fairly hear my heart beating. I'll be home for supper. In another hour, I'll be king of the forest. Long live the king! If I were king of the forest Not queen Not duke Not prince My regal robes of the forest Would be satin Not cotton Not chintz I'd command each thing Be it fish or fowl With a woof! And a woof! And a royal growl As I'd click my heel All the trees would kneel And the mountains bow And the bulls kowtow And the sparrow would take wing If I If I were king Each rabbit would show respect to me The chipmunks genuflect to me Though my tail would lash I would show compash For every underling If I If I were king Just king Monarch of all I survey Monarch Of all I survey If you were king, you wouldn't be afraid of anything? Not nobody, not nohow! - Not even a rhinoceros? - Imposserous! - How about a hippopotamus? - I'd trash him from top to ""bottom-us. "" - Supposing you met an elephant? - I'd wrap him up in ""cello-phant""! - What if it were a brontosaurus? - I'd show him who's king of the forest! How? - How? Courage! What makes a king out of a slave? Courage! What makes the flag on the mast to wave? Courage! What makes the elephant charge his tusk... ...in the misty mist or the dusky dusk? What makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage! What makes the sphinx the Seventh Wonder? Courage! What makes the dawn come up like thunder? Courage! What makes the Hottentot so hot? What puts the ""ape"" in apricot? What have they got that I ain't got? Courage! - You can say that again. Huh? The Wizard says go away! Go away? Looks like we came a long way for nothing. And I was so happy. I thought I was on my way home. Don't cry. We're gonna get you to the Wizard. We certainly are. Auntie Em was so good to me... ...and I never appreciated it. Running away and hurting her feelings. Professor Marvel said she was sick. She may be dying... ...and it's all my fault. I'll never forgive myself. Never, never, never. Please don't cry anymore. I'll get you into the Wizard somehow. Come on. I had an Aunt Em myself once. Wait a minute, fellas. I was just thinking, I really don't want to see the Wizard this much. I better wait for you outside. - What's the matter? - He's just scared again. Don't you know the Wizard will give you courage? I'd be too scared to ask him for it. Well, then, we'll ask him for you. I'd sooner wait outside. Why? Why? Because I'm still scared! - What happened? - Somebody pulled my tail. You did it yourself. - Oh. - Here. Come on. Come forward! Tell me when it's over! Look at that. Look at that! I wanna go home! I am Oz... ...the great and powerful! Who are you? If you please... ...I am Dorothy... ...the small and meek. We've come to ask you... - Silence! - Oh! Oh! Jiminy crickets! The great and powerful Oz... ...knows why you have come. Step forward... ...Tin Man! You dare to come to me for a heart, do you? You clinking, clanking, clattering... ...collection of caliginous junk! Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor. You see... ...a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road and... Quiet! And you, Scarecrow... ...have the effrontery to ask for a brain... ...you billowing bale of bovine fodder! Yes, Your Honor. I mean, Your Excellency. I mean, Your Wizardry! Enough! And you, Lion! Well? You ought to be ashamed of yourself... ...frightening him like that when he came to you for help! Silence, whippersnapper! The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests. What's that? What'd he say? Huh? What'd he say? But first, you must prove yourselves worthy... ...by performing a very small task. Bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West. But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it. Bring me her broomstick... ...and I'll grant your requests. Now go! But what if she kills us first? I said go! ""I'd turn back if I were you. "" I believe there's spooks around here. That's ridiculous! Spooks. That's silly. Don't you believe in spooks? No. Why, only... Oh! Are you all right? I do believe in spooks. I do, I do, I do, I do. I do believe in spooks. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do! You'll believe in more than that before I'm finished with you. Take your army and bring me that girl and her dog. Do what you like with the others, but I want her alive and unharmed. They'll give you no trouble. I promise you that. I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them. Take special care of those slippers. I want those most of all. Now, fly! Fly! Bring me that girl and her slippers! Fly! Fly! Fly! Help! Help! Go away now! Toto! Toto! Help! Help! Help! Help! What happened to you? They tore my legs off and threw them over there! Then they took my chest and threw it over there! That's you all over. They sure knocked the stuffings out of you. Don't stand there. Put me together. We've got to find Dorothy! Now, let's see... What a nice little dog. And you, my dear. What an unexpected pleasure. It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness. What are you gonna do with my dog? Give him back to me! All in good time, my little pretty. - All in good time. - Please give me back my dog. Certainly, certainly... ...when you give me those slippers. - But the Good Witch told me not to. - Very well. Throw that basket in the river and drown him. No! Here. You can have your old slippers, but give me back Toto! That's a good little girl. I knew you'd see reason! I'm sorry! I didn't do it. Can I still have my dog? No! Fool that I am, I should have remembered... ...those slippers will never come off... ...as long as you're alive. But that's not what's worrying me. It's how to do it. These things must be done delicately... ...or you hurt the spell. Run, Toto, run! Catch him, you fool! Run, Toto, run! Run, Toto, run! He got away! He got away! Which is more than you will! Drat, you and your dog! You've been more trouble to me than you're worth. But it'll soon be over now! Do you see that? That's how much longer you've got to be alive. And it isn't long, my pretty. It isn't long! I can't wait forever to get those shoes! I'm frightened. I'm frightened, Auntie Em! I'm frightened. Dorothy! Dorothy! Where are you? It's me. It's Auntie Em. We're trying to find you. Where are you? I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em. I'm locked up in the Witch's castle... ...and I'm trying to get home to you, Auntie Em! Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away! I'm frightened! Come back! Come back! ""Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"" I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty! Look! There's Toto. Where'd he come from? Why, don't you see? He's come to take us to Dorothy. Come on, fellas! I hope my strength holds out. I hope your tail holds out. What's that? What's that? That's the castle of the Wicked Witch. - Dorothy's in that awful place? - I hate to think of her in there. - We've got to get her out. - Don't cry now. We haven't got the oilcan, and you've been squeaking enough as it is. Who's them? Who's them? - I've got a plan how to get in there. - Fine. He's got a plan. - And you're gonna lead us. - Yeah. - Me? - Yes, you. - I gotta get her out of there? - That's right. All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy. Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch... ...guards or no guards, I'll tear them apart. I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there. - There's only one thing I want you to do. - What's that? Talk me out of it. - No, you don't! - Oh, no. - Now, wait a minute. Up! Shh! Shh! Shh! Come on, I've got another idea. Do you think it would be polite, dropping in like this? - Where do we go now? - Yeah. There! Wait! We better make sure. Dorothy, are you in there? It's us! - Yes! It's me! She's locked me in! We gotta get her out! Open the door! Oh, hurry! Please hurry! The hourglass is almost empty! Stand back! Oh, Toto! Toto! Oh, Lion! I knew you'd come! I knew you would! Hurry, we've got no time to lose! Going so soon? I wouldn't hear of it. Why, my little party's just beginning. Trapped. Trapped like mice... rats. That's right. Don't hurt them right away. We'll let them think about it a little first. Seize them! Seize them! Stop them, you fools! Seize them! Seize them! There they go! Now we've got them! Half of you go this way, half of you go that way. Hurry! Hurry! Where do we go now? This way. Come on! Back! Back! Well! Ring-around the rosie, a pocket full of spears! Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you? The last to go will see the first three go before her. And her mangy little dog too! How about a little fire, Scarecrow? Help! I'm burning! I'm burning! It's burning! Help! Don't throw that water! You cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting! Melting! Oh, what a world! What a world! Who would've thought a good little girl like you... ...could destroy my beautiful wickedness? Look out! Look out! I'm going. She's dead. You've killed her. I didn't mean to kill her. Really, I didn't. It's just that he was on fire. Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead! Hail! Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead! The broom. - May we have it? - Please. And take it with you. Oh, thank you so much! Now we can go tell the Wizard the Wicked Witch is dead! The Wicked Witch is dead! Can I believe my eyes? Why have you come back? Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her. Ah, you liquidated her, eh? - Very resourceful. - Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir. Not so fast. Not so fast! I'll have to give the matter a little thought. Go away and come back tomorrow. Tomorrow? Oh, but I wanna go home now! - You've had plenty of time already. - Yeah. Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz! I said come back tomorrow! If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises. Do you presume to criticize the great Oz? You ungrateful creatures! Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow... ...instead of 20 years from now! Oh! The great Oz has spoken! Oh! Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. The great and... Oz has spoken. Who are you? I am the great and powerful Wizard of Oz. You are? I don't believe you. I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me. - You humbug! - Yeah. Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug. You're a very bad man! Oh, no, my dear. I'm a very good man. I'm just a very bad wizard. What about the heart you promised Tin Man? And the courage you promised Cowardly Lion? - And Scarecrow's brain? - And Scarecrow's brain? Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth... ...or slinks through slimy seas has a brain. Back where I come from, we have universities... ...seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers. They think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have. But they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma. Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me... ...by the Universitatus Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum... ...I hereby confer upon you... ...the honorary degree of Th. D. - Th. D.? That's Doctor of Thinkology. The sum of the square roots of two sides of an isosceles triangle... ...is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh, joy! Rapture! I've got a brain! - How can I thank you enough? - Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend, you're a victim of disorganized thinking. You are under the delusion that because you run away from danger... ...you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come from, we have men who are called ""heroes. "" Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs... ...and parade it down the main street. And they have no more courage than you have. But they have one thing that you haven't got. A medal. Therefore... ...for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor... ...conspicuous bravery against wicked witches... ...I award you the Triple Cross. You are now a member of the Legion of Courage. Shucks, folks, I'm speechless. As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart. You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. But I still want one. Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds. They are called phil... Good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours. But they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial. Therefore, in consideration of your kindness... ...I take pleasure at this time in presenting you... ...with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend... ...that a heart is not judged by how much you love... ...but by how much you are loved by others. Ah. Oh! It ticks! Listen! Look, it ticks! Read what my medal says. ""Courage. "" Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth! Oh, they're all wonderful. Hey, what about Dorothy? Yes, how about Dorothy? - Yeah. Dorothy next. I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me. You force me into a cataclysmic decision. The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas is for me to take her myself. Oh, will you? Could you? Oh! But are you clever enough to manage it? Child, you cut me to the quick! I'm an old Kansas man myself... ...born and bred in the western wilderness... ...premier balloonist par excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company. Until one day, while performing feats of stratospheric skill... ...never before attempted by civilized man... ...an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair. - It did? - Weren't you frightened? You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death... ...sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified. Suddenly the wind changed... ...and the balloon floated down into this noble city... ...where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the first wizard deluxe! Times being what they were, I accepted the job... ...retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway. And in that balloon, dear Dorothy... ...you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum. My friends. I mean, my friends! This is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown... ...be that as it may. I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta... ...am about to embark upon a hazardous... ...and technically unexplainable journey... ...into the outer stratosphere! To confer, converse... ...and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards. And I hereby decree that until what time... ...if any, that I return... ...the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains... ...shall rule in my stead... ...assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart... ...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage. Obey them as you would me. Thank you. Oh, Toto! Come back! Toto! Don't go without me. I'll be right back. Stop that dog! This is a highly irregular procedure. This is absolutely unprecedented! - Ruined my exit! Come back! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back! I can't come back! I don't know how it works! Goodbye, folks! Goodbye! Oh, now I'll never get home. Stay with us then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go. That's very kind of you... ...but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do? Look! Here's someone who can help you! - Will you help me? Can you help me? - You don't need help any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. - I have? - Then why didn't you tell her before? Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself. What have you learned, Dorothy? Well... I think that it... ...that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. And it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again... ...I won't look any further than my own back yard... ...because if it isn't there... ...I never really lost it to begin with. Is that right? That's all it is. But that's so easy! I should've thought of it for you. - I should've felt it in my heart. - She had to find it out for herself. Now those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds. - Toto too? - Toto too. - Now? - Whenever you wish. Oh, dear. That's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's... It's gonna be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here. Here's your oilcan. - Goodbye. - Now I know I've got a heart... ...because it's breaking. Goodbye, Lion. I know it isn't right... ...but I'm gonna miss the way you used to holler for help... ...before you found your courage. I would never have found it if it hadn't been for you. I think I'll miss you most of all. - Are you ready now? - Yes. Say goodbye, Toto. - Yes, I'm ready now. - Then close your eyes... ...and tap your heels together three times... ...and think to yourself: ""There's no place like home. There's no place like home. "" There's no place like home. Wake up, honey. - There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no... Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling. Oh, Auntie Em, it's you! - Yes, darling. Hello there! Anybody home? I dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big... - Well, she seems all right now. - She got quite a bump on the head. We kind of thought she was gonna leave us. But I did leave you. That's just the trouble. And I tried to get back for days! There, there, lie quiet now. - You just had a bad dream. - Sure. Remember me... ...your old pal, Hunk? And me, Hickory? You couldn't forget my face, could you? No. But it wasn't a dream. It was a place. And you and you and you... ...and you were there. But you couldn't have been, could you? We dream lots of silly things when we... No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place. And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice... ...but most of it was beautiful. But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, ""I want to go home!"" And they sent me home. Doesn't anybody believe me? Of course we believe you, Dorothy. But anyway, Toto, we're home! Home! And this is my room... ...and you're all here. And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again... ...because I love you all. And oh, Auntie Em... ...there's no place like home! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Get to it.

It's about an hour, 40, with traffic till we get there. - Really? - Yeah. Think we can find something around here? No, I'll find something. I'll find something. How's your kid? How old is he now? - He is 17. - Fuck me. And he got a scholarship to play baseball in college already, man. - Wow, that's great. - I'm proud of him. My little guy is not so little any more. I don't wanna go home. Wish I could find you a spot. - Sorry, Jack, I don't know this area. - Would you make a right here? - You sure? - Yeah. All right. Here we go. That looks like a fucking bar. - Here? - What's that say? ""Bleu Bleu."" Here, let me just try this. Oh, shit. Wait, wait. - My man, my man, I... Aren't you like... - This is a bar, right? - Yeah, but not your kind of place. - They got alcohol? - Well, yeah, but... - Oh, it's my kind of place. Oh, shit! This is crazy! How are you doin', papo? How am I doin'? All right, if I can get a drink. - You good? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. There's the bar. - This is my home girl Giselle. - How you doin'? - Oh, yeah. That's Jack. Can we get this man anything he wants, please? Can I get a gin on the rocks... Papo, wow. Oh, my gosh. I'm freaking out right now. - Hey, is this a drag bar? - Yeah, papo. Yeah, yeah. But, look, we do this every Friday night. Yo, it's crazy. It's so lit, though. I thought maybe I was in some sort of hallucinogenic state. - Or something. - No, no. All are welcome. A dress or something. Gonna have something? Let me get you a drink. OK. Yeah, um, wow. You better kill 'em tonight. All you ladies, kill it tonight, OK? - I'm ready. - I always do!

Yeah, I was just talking to Nicki. You know Nicki? - Hello, Nicki. How you doin', baby? - She's telling me her life story. - Fascinating. - My home girl's about to perform. Y'all know her well because she used to work here as a server. But, tonight, the only thing she's serving are some fabulous, French live vocals. Is she really singing, or is it one of those karaoke things? No, she's really singing, papo. I promise you. Watch this. Watch. Would anybody like some French tips tonight? Yes, baby! Yes, baby! Oh, fuck. - Oh, papo, you crying? - A little bit. You have... You have to meet her. - What's that? - You have to meet her! - Oh, no, I can't meet her. - Yes! Come on. Donte, you got a rag, honey? Thank you. Miss Ally, now you sang in French, you gonna pick something else next week? - I don't know. - Look at her, doing languages. - Do Moroccan. - No! - This is my friend, Jackson Maine. - Hey. - This is Jackson Maine. - Hey. How are you? - Hey! Oh, my God! - Right? This is my friend, Ally. - Hi. - Hey. - I thought that might be you. - What'd you say? - I thought that might be you. - That's me. Thank you! Do you wanna sit down? - No! You've been on your feet all night. - No! You're our guest. - You sure you don't mind? - A little drink? - I'm here watching the show - you guys. - Word. - Yeah, yeah. - Sign my boob? - Sure. Yeah, I can do that. - Oh, my God! - Give me a sharpie! - You know, it's BYOB around here. - Yeah? - ""Bring your own boobs."" Oh, God! Oh, those aren't really her boobs? Wow! So, why are you in here, hon? - Sorry? - What brings you here? I was playing right around here tonight. I'm a musician. - How'd your show go? - I think it went all right. - OK, here we go. All right. - Thank you! - That's all right? - Oh, my. - Aahh. - Which one should I do? - Do 'em both! I don't care! - Slut! - Why don't I do it across? - Bitch, Jackson Maine! - I'll just... - Oh, my! Ohh, she will stop at nothing. - You gotta blow on it! - I did it pretty big. Oh. - Oh, you got it. OK. - Thank you so much! You all gotta go home but you know the phrase. You gotta get the hell up outta here! Cos I'm not losing my virginity or my liquor licence over you bitches, so pack up! - That's right! - That's enough cocktails! Clear it out! Hello, goodbye, Roger. Have fun! - Bring the drinks on out! - Do you do that often? - Do what? - The show. Yeah, yeah. The girls are so nice to me here. I mean, they would never normally let a girl sing at one of these shows but they've always loved my voice. They used to beg me to sing. It's an honour, really. I get to be one of the gay girls. Is that your real eyebrow? Um... No. No. I... I make it out of tape. - Oh, so it's, like, stuck on? - Mm-hm. Can I try to take it off? Uh... Yeah, sure. It's incredible what they do. - Look at that. - Yep. There it is. - I should put her down somewhere. - OK. There we go. Why are you covering your eye? Just cos I don't have my eyebrow on any more. Oh, no, no. The whole point is I can see your face. Yeah, there we go. Why did you come back here? Your friend brought me back here. I'm glad he did. Can I buy you a drink? Oh... I... I gotta change, and I've got paint in my hair. - And my eyebrows are... - That's not your real hair? No, my hair's like your colour. - Oh, OK. - But I paint it with this... - ..makeup. - I'd love to see what that looks like. I'll wait for you. Um... Yeah, OK. Sure. Yeah, if you wanna wait, I'll come have a drink with you. Sure. Bitch, can you get down off that stage and come help me close this bar, please? Don't talk to me like that in that bus driver wig, girl. Oh, I know you did not. What, you have a street appointment tonight, sister? Excuse me! Mr Maine, would you mind? Uh... What do you want me to do? Just come play a little song for me. - I don't know. - Can you leave the man alone, please? I showed you mine, you show me yours. Come on. He already signed your tits, honey. Say, ""No, sir."" - Show off for me a little bit. - Only because you already performed. You're so nice. Thank you. Lord, the man is here for Ally. Not for you, sister. - Oh... She's nice. Yeah. - Isn't it cute? Little arts and crafts. - Yeah, and light. - Mm-hm. - Did you do this yourself? - Yeah, all me. Looks great. Does this mic work? Oh, yeah. Fuck, all right. What do you want me to play? I don't care, just look at me while you do it. - Oh, Lord! Somebody kill me now. - Let me see what I can... All right. You're ready? - You know I would! - OK. - It's a cop bar. - Cops? Yeah, that's why they serve all night long. - Can I ask you a personal question? - Oh. Sure. Do you write songs or anything? - I don't sing my own songs. - Thank you. Why? I just... I just don't feel comfortable. Why wouldn't you feel comfortable? Um... Well, cos, like, almost every single person that I've come in contact with in the music industry has told me that my nose is too big and that I won't make it. - Your nose is too big? - Yeah. Your nose is beautiful. - Are you showing me your nose? - Yeah. - I've been looking at it all night. - Oh, come on. I'll be thinking about it for a long time. - You're full of shit. - I'm telling you the truth. - You're full of shit. - Can I touch your nose? - Oh, my gosh! - Let me just touch it for a second. - You're very lucky. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. - Yeah, not really. My nose has not made me lucky. I could've had maybe a hit song if it wasn't for my nose. - That's fucking bullshit. - Yeah. No, it's not bullshit because you go into these rooms and there's all these fucking men in there and they're just staring at you, listening to your record, going, ""Oh, you sound great, but you don't look so great."" You know, I had a thing when I was little... I was born with this thing in my ear. Couldn't hear. What do I wind up being? A singer. So, you never know. Look, talent comes everywhere. Everybody's talented. Bet you fucking everybody in this bar is talented in one thing or another, but having something to say... and the way to say it so people listen to it, that's a whole other bag. And unless you get out there and you try to do it, you'll never know. That's just the truth. If there's one reason we're here, it's to say something so people wanna hear it. - Understand what I'm trying to tell you? - Yeah, I do. I don't like it, but I understand it. Oh, I think you like it a little bit. I think I'm getting through a little bit. I can see it. No, you can't. It's a good thing we met. - Yeah. - For both of us. - Trust me. - I don't know what is going on. - Honestly, what... - Who does? I'm in a cop bar, with Jackson Maine. It's, like... - Jackson Maine! - I'm gonna wake up in a minute. When you get famous, people start saying your full name. - Well, what do you want... - Just ""Jack"". Speaking of... Come on. - What? - Did you put that on? You put that on. When did you even go to the jukebox? Oh, God! I hear that song, and I just wanna turn it the fuck off. - Jack Maine! - I fucked that song up. - No! What? Come on. - Oh, my God! Hey, I know that we're not supposed to do this. I know that we're not supposed to bother you. That's all right. You got your camera? I don't have mine. Excuse me, one sec. - My ex-girlfriend was fucking this guy. - OK. - Who looks like you, she said. - Shut up. But I gotta take a picture of you to send to her to show her that you look nothing like that fucking guy. - Jack, I'm sorry. - Take a picture. Will that help you? Will that make you happy? - OK. Take a picture? - Want someone to take the picture? - No. It's OK. - Excuse me. - Get the fuck off, you little whore. - What? What? - Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah. - What? - I got you. - I'm sorry, Jack! - It's all right. - Oh, my God! Why did I... I'm fine, honestly. I'm OK. This is so stupid. No, you gotta get ahead of the swelling. Just trying to find some... - This is so embarrassing. - ..peas. Here we go. Yeah, put that on there. Gotta wrap something up with it. Find it. - You like Cheetos? - No, like gauze. - Some gauze or something. - Gauze? Try to do that. With that hand. And do that hand. You play piano? - Yeah, we gotta take care of this, then. - Oh, OK. Thanks. And that's it, yeah. Keep that on there. Hold on. Can you do that? Yeah. Did you get it? It's already gotten warm, hasn't it? - Should we have gotten two? - No, it's OK. Thanks. I'm sorry. I... I had to. That's all right. - It's not really all right, though. - Have a good one. Be careful, she'll hit you. These rings are gonna get stuck if you don't take them off. - Does that hurt? - Yeah. That's OK. - May I? - Yeah. Safekeeping. - Put this on there. - You're a sweetheart. And we'll just wrap it up. You'll be good to go. How the hell do you deal with that all the time? - What's that? - People just...talking to you like you're not a real person, or taking your picture. - Is that too tight? - Ah, it's OK, thanks. - Whoo... That hurt you? - That's fine, it's OK. There we go. Now you're mobile. Swing it around. - I look like a pirate. - Right? I told you it was worth coming here. How do you do that? - Do what? - Don't change the subject. - Is that what I'm doing? - Nobody ever asks you about you, huh? - Not sure. - Where are you from? Arizona. - Arizona boy. - Mm-hm. Dad had, like, a midlife crisis, I think. So I've been told. Made his way to Arizona, started working for this family on a pecan ranch. - A pecan ranch? - Yeah. Knocked up the family's daughter. She was just shy of 18. Uh-oh. That's when I came into the picture. - OK. The son of an 18-year-old. - Yeah. Well, she died at childbirth. - Then, my dad... - I'm sorry. He... He died when I was 13, so I guess... my brother would tell you that he raised me, but... ..I don't know. I don't know who was raising who. Just 127 acres of nuts, Navajo, and nowhere to go. Is that me? That's you. - Did you just write that now? - Yeah. It's pretty good. I started writing this song the other day, and... ..maybe that could work, like as a chorus or something. I have to think if I can remember it. Ah... Holy shit. What is this? Was this supposed to help me? Can I tell you a secret? I think you might be a songwriter. But don't worry, I won't tell anybody. But I'm not very good at keeping secrets. You're a real gentleman. I think. Thank you, sir. It's on the right. - Right there? - Which one? - This one. - Oh, yeah. - What's all this? - Oh, it's my dad. It's a long story. What's he, a sheikh? No, he's a driver. Hey, I got a gig. You wanna come? - When? - We're headed to the airport now. - Tonight. - Tonight? No, I can't. I gotta go to work later. I gotta go to bed. Who's gonna take care of your hand? I messed it up. - Me. - No, no! - I'll take care of it. - It's my fault. - That's OK. - No, listen. Hey! - You have my number. - OK. All right. - Hey. - What? I just wanted to take another look at you. Maybe I fucked that up. No. - Hi, Dad. - Pretty late, pretty late. - Oh? Is it late? - Yeah. Look at you. You don't even know where you're walking. - Come on. - Well, I wanna go to bed. No, come in for two minutes. It's Wolfie's birthday. Come on. - Two minutes! - OK. - Wolfie! - Yeah, sweetheart? - Who was the guy in the car? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Hey, Ally. - How's it goin'? - Happy birthday. - ""Happy birthday""? - Yeah. - It's not my birthday. - What do you mean? Come on. - No, I was just saying... What the hell happened in here? My God! - This place is a mess! - ""Starting gate"" is ""shuppatsu geto"", - and ""bad beat"" is ""warui bito"". - What's going on? Leave the butter out? Who the hell's betting on horses at breakfast time in Japan? - It's not breakfast time. - They're loading! - Joe, come on! - You're crazy! Have a sizable investment on this. What did I say about smoking in this house? - Outside! - Who are you? - It's my house. - I know it's your house. - But you smoke too. - All right, forget it. Sweetheart, you're happy here, aren't you? I'm happy, Dad. I'm just saying, she's got no space. - What are you saying? - Sweetheart. - She's got no space. - Wait a minute. I want my friends to look at you. Take a good look. With a voice like from heaven, but you know what? It's not always the best singers that make it. You know? I knew a couple of guys could sing Sinatra under the table. But Frank, he'd come on stage with the blue eyes, the sharkskin suit, the patent leather shoes... he becomes Frank Sinatra. And everybody else, all these other guys... that really got it, that really have it inside... ..just a bunch of nobodies. OK. Everybody, let's go. Time for work. Unfortunately, you keep blasting the hearing... it's not gonna come back. I think it's time we reconsider the in-ear monitors. We talked about that with Bobby a couple of weeks ago. If we put the in-ear molds in, we can use those to amplify the high frequencies. - OK, great. - Cut down the sound. - Yeah. - I'm gonna talk to Bobby - and get something set up. - Sold. I'm sold. - All right, Jack. - Yeah, call Bobby. - Stubborn son of a bitch. - Ready. One, two, three, four. - We're trying... - You gotta put 'em in, man. I told you, I can't wear those. When I wear 'em, it's just in my head, and I need to be here. The doctor said it's the only way to manage this thing, Jack. You're not gonna get back what you lost. It's the only way we can manage what you still got. Oh, wow. Ha! I think we're managing pretty good. What do you want me to do? - The door's wide open if you wanna go. - You know what? Don't start that shit. Show a little fucking pride in what you're doing, buddy. I just wanna know if she's on her way or not, that's all. Who's coming? What the fuck? Who's here? I have no idea. He won't tell me. - Hi, Ally. I'm Phil. - Hi. - We met last night. - Yeah. - Jack sent me to take you to the gig. - Oh, my God. Um... But I gotta work. - I can't go. - He's really looking forward to this. I appreciate that, but... I can't leave, so I'll be in my car right down the street. Tell him, ""Thank you, but no, thank you."" Say it like that. - Wait, Ally. What are you doing? - The fuck is that shit? This is crazy. - This is great. - What the hell's going on? Look, a guy like that invites you to a show... - It could be a great opportunity. - Dad, don't start with me! Listen. Does he know you sing at all? Did he hear anything from you? - I gotta go to work. - It's the opportunity of a lifetime. I don't have the same disease you have. You get around celebrities like they're gonna rub off on you. - What are you talking about? - ""Oh, you know who I drove?"" Like magic, now you're famous. - And you're not. It's not magic, Dad. - Sweetheart. He's a drunk! You know all about drunks. Sweetheart, he's still there. You fucking hit a cop? Yeah, he was being an asshole to Jack, so I fucking popped him in the face. That is so gangster! Then we ended up in a parking lot and he put peas around my hand to fix it. Then he was singing and I was singing. I don't know what's going on. Now he's got his driver following me around. He's been following you from your house to work? - Yes. It's crazy! - You're fucking late. I'm what? I said you're late! Are we doing this? Hey, Bryan, I'm out. - Find somebody else. - Bryan, I'll be back. - Papo, I promise. - See ya. I won't. - Did you see Bryan's face? - Hey, great! Let's do this. Let's go. What are we doing? You know, if I didn't know Jack... I would call you a stalker. Yeah, sorry about that. Yes, man! Lay on that couch right now! I'm gonna take my shoes off. - Oh, my God! - This is nice. How this shit works? - They just told you no. - Oh, OK. I'm so sorry. Oh, shit! I could get used to this shit. You need to date more rock stars, baby girl, you know? We're not dating. Hi, Ally. I'm Gail. - Hi. - Hi. Leave your bags. We'll grab 'em in a sec. - Ready? - OK, sure. - OK. Yeah. - Thanks. - Did you have a good trip? - Yeah. Passes. - Thank you. - Put 'em around your necks. Ear plugs. You'll need these. It's loud up there. Yeah, I got 'em. We're coming in. I'll bring you guys to the side stage. Guys, guys, guys. This way. Wrong way. - Sorry. This place is so big. I'm just... - Come on, this way. Oh, watch yourself. You guys good? Hey, boys. He's so excited that you're here. Thank you very much. That was great. There's a friend of mine who came a long way to be here and she wrote a great song, and I'd like her to sing it. I think it's pretty fucking good. - How are you? - I'm good. Hi! - It's so good to see you. - How are you? - You were so good. - The trip was fine? - Yeah. - Phil didn't bother you? Gail was so nice. So, listen, we're gonna sing that song, all right? I did an arrangement - kind of not so great - - but stick with it. - No, I can't. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, you're coming. Please. It's not funny. Jack, don't fuck around. All you gotta do is trust me. That's all you gotta do. I'm gonna sing it either way, so... - Steve... - ""Trust me."" OK. - You have to go sing. - I'm not going out there, no. - Oh, my God! There's so many people. - Pretty fucking good, man. Pretty fucking good. The way the guitar started... I thought maybe I set it in the wrong key, and the tempo was too fast. - No, it was so beautiful, and... - I wasn't sure... - Ally, you OK? - Jack? Jack? You. You, move! - Isn't that the girl who sang? - Good concert, man! - Thank you, yeah. - Love you, man. - Thank you. - Hey, Jack. Killed it. - Really? - Yeah. Hi! Oh, my God! Where's my key? I don't fucking... Ah! Ha-ha-ha. Oh, fuck! I'll be right back. OK? Just give me one second. Is this the bathroom? Where's the fucking... OK. Hey. Jack? I don't know, wake him up. - I can't wake him up. He's drunk. - Yes, you can! Shake your titties in his face or some shit, and just fucking... Know what I'm saying? Take two shots. Thank you so much for your help. You are so helpful. Let me know how it goes, baby. Come on, pal. He's out. You think maybe he drinks a bit much? Sweetie, you have no idea. Tell you one thing, though. He's never brought a girl on stage before. And it's been a long, long time since he played like that. Well, that's good to know. One time, my brother came home, I was playing on this upright we used to always have in our den. And I was, like, in my own world. No-one was ever home, and then he comes home to take care of my dad, who was sick. And he's sittin' there, and he's looking at me. I swear to God, he looked at me like I was special or something, and it just kind of filled me up. I should've never told you that. I don't know. Why? - Cos it's embarrassing. - It's so sweet. Cos you're nothing like my brother, let me just say. - Yeah, I don't look like your brother? - He's a fucking old man, OK. My dad had me when he was 63 years old. 63 years old? - And we have different mothers, so... - Huh. What's that number down here? That is how many people looked at it. Get the fuck out of here. How do they know how many people looked at it? I think it's... They call it an algorithm, or... What's an algorithm? It's like a beat. - A beat? - Yeah. Yeah. - Like in music, a beat? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think, I don't know. - Do you believe this? - No. - Wow. - And you see this? - Yeah. - That's how many people have watched. - Yeah, we're just telling... - They was telling him. - How the fuck do they do that? - I've watched it 200 times myself. - I'm 200 of those people. - Go, Pops. Oh, jeez! My God, you're so fast! Jack! French toast is gonna come out. First one to hit the bed. - Beautiful. You wrote this with him? - He's so talented. - Can I watch it again? - Yeah, it's good. One more time. - I'll be up all night watching this. - Or 500. Come on! Christ! Oh, my God. How did you get in here? Your dad let me in. What? I don't feel this way about everybody. Well, good. Then we're on the same page. You come and sing with me. Where? Well, first stop's Arizona. I'm never getting on that thing with you when you've been drinking. I haven't even thought about drinking or anything else. We'll see how long that lasts. Go wait downstairs. Actually, when I was in my 20's and 30's, I was like a crooner. As a matter of fact, a lot of people thought I was... better than Sinatra. Frank Sinatra? What are you writing down in here? That's my songbook. I usually use a typewriter, but... I had this idea on the bike... and I didn't wanna forget it. How do you hear it? Aren't you excited to be home and play for all your Arizonian fans? I don't really come back here. - You avoid your home? - I don't know. It's like the hot air and... ..the history, I don't know. Bought the ranch, though, I grew up on. Gave it to my brother. We buried Dad there, and so I wanted to make sure that nobody... paved over his grave or... - any of that kind of shit. - Is it around here? It's not far. Why don't we just go there? It's nearby. Mm. Mm. Mm. Jack? Yeah, if he shows up! These guys have been vamping out there for a fucking half an hour. It's time to fucking get on. Don't you get tired of being... You sold Dad's ranch! They turned it into a fucking wind farm! I bought that for you. Where's his grave? He washed away in a fucking storm. His grave isn't there any more. I told you, but you were fucking drunk. You were fucking loaded... and already pissing yourself a swan song. Fuck if you shed a tear for that piece of shit you idolise for no goddamn fucking reason. All Dad ever did for you... ..was make you his fucking drinking buddy. And you'd be right there with him if he was still alive and you fucking know it. What did you think... that I was gonna fucking take care of it... ..while I'm fucking cradling your ass all over the goddamn world? Yeah. That's a good excuse. Raising a little brother so you don't have to deal with the fact that you were no fucking good. If I was no good, why'd you steal my fucking voice? - Huh? - Cos you had nothing to fucking say. You were too proud to sing any of the songs I ever wrote. Well, I got something to say now, pal. I'm done being your fucking errand boy. I quit. Yeah, my voice just got up on me a few months ago and... ..another shot of steroids is better safe than sorry. Thank you for that. We should be good. Hey. - You OK? - Yeah. Well, let's play. All right, I got an idea for the end. - Sorry... - That's OK. - It's gonna be a little different... - Cheers. Where's that joint? We're gonna be a little different for the end, OK? - Do the encore and the thing that I said. - OK. All right? Come on, let's go back out and do it. - What are you doing? - Go, go, go. All right, listen to me. Here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna do the song that I said I wanted you to do. - The one that I love. - No. I'm not. - Please! - Do the one that I love. It'll be great. - Jack, please... - I said I always... - You promised to do it. I love you. - I always say... Always remember us this way. Everybody, we're gonna bring out Ally to bring us home... and she's gonna sing an original song. Thank you. Ally! Ally! Ally! Ally! That was fucking beautiful. No, you were fucking doing it. I was there, I fucking... - Our car's over there. - Ally, that was unbelievable. - Thank you. - That was unbelievable what you did. Thank you. I don't know if you know about me, about where I've come from. I'm Rez Gavron. I know who you are. What you have right now goes way beyond just this. There's people who need to hear what you have to say musically. This is not normal stuff. It's really amazing what you're doing. I think you have it all. I do. And the question to you is, ""What do you want?"" I'm in that position, to put you wherever you want to be. I... I don't... I don't have... I gotta talk to Jack. He said that he thought Interscope Records might really wanna sign me. And he said that he has this wonderful studio with a beautiful live room and these amazing producers he wants to bring in to record my songs. And he loves Look What I've Found. Remember the song we did in the diner? - Remember, when we were driving? - Yeah. Yeah? I mean, it was so nice talking to him, and he really believes in me. - You all right, Jack? - He's OK. He's fine. He does this all the time. Hey, Jack. Thanks. What's going on? Hm? What are you doing? Oh. You jealous fuck. I'm so happy for you. Oh, you are? Oh... Jackson! Oh, my God! Jack. Stop! Why are you so jealous, boy? Hm? What are you doing? What's wrong? You upset? You want me to make you less... I know, do you wanna play? OK, let's play. What the hell is this? - I'm so sorry. - No, you're fine. - You sound great, OK? - You're doing great. We'll do it again. I'm gonna cue you in. One second. Listen to my cue. We'll come right in, OK? So, should... Well... I'm sorry, but will I sing in the beginning? You're gonna hear the second line, and then I wanna start recording. I think I got an idea that might help out, all right? - Please. Be my guest. - That was really good up to that point. - I'm gonna go in there for a second. - All right, Jack. - I've never sang with a track before. - I think you need your piano. - If you're playing it and singing it... - Yeah, I always play it on the piano. I'm gonna have them fly one in, and we'll try it there - and see where it goes. - You think that's OK? - OK. Thank you. - I got you. You're doing great. - You OK? - No, I'm so nervous. - You look so beautiful. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh, so you guys have already met the new girl, have you? - Rez! What's the plan? - What's up? Thanks for doing this, man. I appreciate it. This is pop music, kids. We have a battle to do, OK? You are the troops, so if I call you ""troops"", just know that we're going into battle. What is my lyrics, Ally? This is just fine-tuning and creating an image. I know. I just don't wanna lose the part of me that's...talented. I'm not gonna let you lose that piece. I'm not gonna let you lose that piece. OK. What are we gonna do with you? What are we gonna do with... Oh, he's beautiful! - ""You can't send me back. I'm too cute."" - Hey, he's got your eyelashes. He does. He's got your eyelashes. Hey, bud! This has never been done before, just so you know. It actually has been done before. Would you please... Please. Do it for me. No, I can't in the water. Mm. You comin' with me to Memphis? - What are you talkin' about? - I gotta go do this... You know, it's one of those paid things. Soul-crushing work, really, but it's kind of never what I thought I'd wind up doing, maybe. I don't know, but... I've made peace with it, though. Anyway, if you wanna come, I thought... we could have a laugh, at the very least. Rez wants to keep me here because, you know, they rushed out the single and they were so excited that they want me to finish the album. - So I'm working on that. - Listen to what you're saying. Listen to what you just said. People wanna hear what you have to say. That's the stuff. - I... I can't... - Hey, hey. Take it in. Thank you, by the way. - Thank you for what? - Giving me a home. This place never felt like one before. Oh, fuck. Jack, you OK? Jack? Is there a reason why you're not up there? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my... Oh, my... Hey! - Pretty incredible. - Did Jack show up? - I haven't heard from him. - What do you mean? - I haven't heard from him. - I can't find him. I called him three times. What happened with the dancers there? I just thought that I should do it alone cos it's so overwhelming. OK, but you can't go rogue on me. You have to understand that this is what I do and you have to trust me, OK? So, if I give you a couple of dancers, don't not use them and then miss a couple of steps, OK? We also have to change your hair. We have to change the colour of your hair. What's wrong with my hair? - I'm thinking platinum, or... - I don't wanna be fucking blonde. I am who I am, and I'm worried about Jack. I will find Jack, OK? I will find him. Jack. I feel like we've done this before. Didn't think we'd do it so soon, man. Come on, bro. Get up. All right. There we go. In my mind, I made it to the door. I almost didn't wake you. You looked so comfortable. - How you doin'? - I've seen better days, I guess. I apologise for... - disrespecting your property... - Not necessary. - ..or whatever I did. - You want some coffee? Put some on, and we'll come in in a minute. OK. That's him, right? That's your boy. Jack, he's as old now... ..as you were when I met you. Saw you on YouTube. - That video with the girl. - Yeah. It made me happy, man. You looked like you. You were just... just doing it, bro. She writes too. - She wrote that tune? - Yeah. Bunch of others too. Got hooked up with some manager guy, wants to... You know. - She's good, bro. - I know. Maybe she's a way out. Ain't nothing to be afraid of, bro. You know, it's like... I don't know... You... You float out... ..float out at sea, and then...one day, you find a port, say, ""I'm gonna stay here for a few days."" A few days becomes a few years. And then you forgot where you were goin' in the first place. And then you realise you don't really give a shit about where you was going, cos you like where you're at. That's how it is for me. I like where I'm at. I didn't even realise I liked it so much... ..till I saw your ass sleeping in the grass this morning. Yeah, come on, man. You can rest in my daughter's room, bro. I thought of, like, a million things to say to you on the plane... and I can't remember. Jack... Glad you're here. You make it to Memphis after all.did  Fuck. I won't do this again. I won't come and find you. Next time, you can clean up your own mess. You understand me? How was the show? It was fucking awesome. I cut the dancers. - Dancers? - Yeah. Ah. Good. Fucking dancers. All you do is need to sing. - You made me so upset. - I'm sorry. I saw that video on YouTube. - Oh. - It was great. Thank you so much. Excuse me one second. - What's going on? - Do you have, like, a plier? Jack's OK? I wanna cut the guitar strings, not too crazy. There used to be pliers or something like that. Ah... Yeah, yeah. I don't know where my mom is. - Yeah. I understand that. - I think you're pretty. Me? You think I'm pretty? Thank you. I think you're pretty. It was real great, and then Jack tells me you wrote the song. Yeah, he got me to start singing my own songs again. - He has a way of doing that. - Yeah, he does. Does anyone want some more mac and cheese? Yeah? Here, sweetheart, you want some? Ah. There he goes. What's up, man? I understand what you said. What the hell are you... Are you kidding? - That stupid? - No. - It's not stupid. - It wasn't a stupid thing I just did? Is that what you were doing when you left the table? He told me he was looking for some pliers. I didn't know what he was gonna do. I didn't think he was gonna ""do it"" do it. Oh, she has another ring! Well, that's just temporary. No, no, no, no, no. Jack, wait a minute. Let's anoint this. Let's do it today. - Yo, for real. - It's a good idea! No, you get the dress. I'll call my cousin right now. It's Saturday. Nobody's gonna be in there. - Let's go. - You really wanna do that? That place has a magical quality to it. It what? It has a magical quality? - It does. - What do you mean? - That church is special. - We can go. - I'll take you to get a dress. - There you go, right there. It'd be great! OK, you're coming with us for sure because you're... I can't believe this. What am I doing? OK, sure. - My brother. Good to see you. - Hey, hey! - Jack! - Good to see you, my man. - Thank you so much. - Welcome to the Lord's house. With the power... I think that's how it goes. Do you take him... Do you take him? I do. I do. Congrats, man. - I listened to what you said. - I'm glad you did. I can't believe he did it. - One thing at a time, OK? - What? Oh! I didn't understand. - Lot of people downstairs? - Yeah. - She better come out before they leave. - Want me to check on her? Well, I think we're gonna have to go pretty soon, so... All right. Ally. I'm coming in. What are you doin' in the tub? This is so weird. I don't know who the hell I think I am. I... One song is fine, but... ..to put out a whole record, I don't know what the fuck I was thinking. I don't know about all of that, but you definitely look like a star. - Really? - Yeah. What do you think of her hair and the look and the...? - I discussed it with her. - Yeah. - It looks great. - Was that your choice? No, it was actually hers. - No drink? - What's that? No drink? No socks? Touch. Touch, mate. Yeah, I could never get used to that, the idea of not wearing socks. - Your feet get all... - No, actually I am wearing socks. They're these kind of little female insert socks - that work with these shoes. - Oh, you are. You're hiding them. Yeah, I'm just hiding them. That's right. OK, now is this thing... Yeah, there it is. Oh, that's a good light. Here, hold this for me, baby. Hey, Ally, girl! Wait, hold on. Come on. Sookie, Donte. Come here. I put my Jackson titties on! Hi! Baby, listen, we just wanted to say congratulations. - Congratulations! - We love you! - I love you too. - Girl, please come back soon. We done put Etta in your station, girl. - The queen is here! - Stop! - Wow! - What do you think? Well, it's beautiful. You. SNL. Alec Baldwin hosting. - Did you get it? - Season finale. - No fucking way. - No, got it.you  - No way! Oh, my God! - No, got it.you  Oh, gosh! - That's incredible! Thank you. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Bitch! - Oh, my gosh! - Get downstairs. - Everyone's waiting. - OK. Can I just talk to her for one second outside? Just one sec, sorry. Just be a second, yeah. It doesn't do you any justice, I'll tell you that. You always said you liked my nose. - I love your nose. - It's real big up there. I wish it was bigger up there. The whole thing should just be your fucking nose. Fuck all those people who ever said anything. Just put a billboard of your fucking nose up there. Just the nose? That's so ridiculous. Listen, if I just don't say this, I'll never forgive myself. What? If you don't dig deep in your fucking soul... ..you won't have legs. I'm just telling you that. You don't tell the truth out there, you're fucked. All you got is you, and what you wanna say to people. They are listening now. They're not gonna be listening forever. Trust me. So you gotta grab it. And you don't apologise, you don't worry about why they're listening or how long they're gonna be listening, you just tell 'em what you wanna say. Cos how you say it is the stuff of angels. Pop! Six to the right, and hah! Ball, change. Down. Hah! Ball, change. - Attitude. - Whoo! - The last part. - I know. All right! 30 seconds. Red mark. Alec in 20. Stand by, guys. Here we go. Ready? Song one. Stand by, Alec. - In ten, nine... - Alec in ten. - eight, seven, six... - Ready 4. Dissolve 4. Alec in five seconds. - Four, three, two, one... - And go 4. Dissolve 4. - And cue Alec! - Ladies and gentlemen, Ally. Dissolve 1. The caterpillar becomes the butterfly. What the hell are you doing here? I'm in town for a gig. Been working for Willie. - I've been working for Willie. - No shit. Yeah. Thought I'd stop by and check her out. Is it gettin' worse? Nah, I've just been with my wife, and it's goin' real good. Funny to run into you, cos... ..I was thinking about asking you to come back out with us. I gotta say, it's easier without you. Listen. You run into any trouble... ..call me. Thank you! That light's beautiful. Oh, God, here we... Yeah, that's it, Ally. Yeah, that's it. That's it, Ally. That's it, I love that. Oh, my gosh. It's so early. I've been here all night. - Early for me, late for you. - Hi, it's nice to see you. - How you doin'? - I'm kind of... - He's amazing. - What do you think? These fucking photos. - They're so beautiful. - Look at that! Look at that! - That's incredible. - It doesn't even look like me. You've just been nominated for three Grammys. Including Best New Artist. They just announced it now. Everybody! Grammy-nominated artist. Have you been drinking? Are you fucked up right now? I'm out a couple. It's the morning. Yup. Hey, buddy. You're nominated for three Grammys, and it's fucking great. Thank you. How did you find that out? Bobby told me. He called. He said that... ..they wanna do some Roy Orbison tribute. They want me to sing and shit. - Great. - Some, like, supergroup thing. But the point is, you got nominated, and it's great. I'm just trying to figure it out, that's all. ""Why do you come around me with an ass like that?"" - My lyrics? - ""Why do you walk around in jeans?"" ""Why do you come around with an ass like that?"" Yeah, that's my song. What about my song? I fucking listened to it over and over in the fucking... You're not making any sense. Yeah, just keep drinking. - That'll give you the answer. - Maybe I fucking failed you. - That kills me. I'm sorry. - You what? You failed me? Yeah, you're embarrassing, and it's just... - I'm embarrassing? - I feel bad for you. - Yeah... - I'm not embarrassing! - I have to tell you. - You're embarrassing! You're so embarrassed of your fucking self that you gotta put me down. You're worried that you're ugly, and you're not. So you need to get approval by all these people. - Why can't I just be enough for you? - I don't need approval. I'd like for my boyfriend to love me. For my to love me.husband  Who's your fucking boyfriend? You have a boyfriend? - Yeah, I've got a boyfriend. - That hurts. - I have a boyfriend. - Call me your fucking boyfriend. You're my boyfriend. You're my boyfriend if you don't treat me like your wife. I don't even know what that fucking means. It means clean your shit up. You're fucking messy. - That's what it means. - Well, that's not true. - Oh, it isn't? - Uh-uh. Let's go. You wanna be my drinking buddy? Wanna practise? - I don't think you could handle it. - You don't? Let me see. Know why? Cos you're too worried about what everybody else is thinking. Here we go, Jack. You want me to be your dad? - Be your drinking buddy? - Yeah. Yeah, you couldn't be my dad if you fucking tried. He had more talent in his finger than you have in your whole body. So don't even fucking go there about that, all right? - That's over the fucking line. - Why don't you have another drink and we can just get fucking drunk until we fucking disappear, OK? - Do you got those pills? - You're just fucking ugly, that's all. - I'm what? - You're just fucking ugly. Get the fuck out! Get out! I said, get out! Fine. Good evening. Seven and eight and huh. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, up! Pull it! Six. Come on, feel it. Ooh-huh. Down, up! Hah! Swing it! - That was great. - What are you doin' here? Something fell through, so I was able to come back a few days early. I think I might have said some things... Just...how I acted. You hurt me. You really hurt me. Sorry. You haven't been drinking. What'd you say? I said you haven't been drinking. I can tell. No, I haven't. No. - I have to get back to rehearsal... - Oh, yeah. Can I watch? Yeah, OK. Meet me at home. Or I can wait and drive you home. - Just meet me at home. - OK. What do you mean, they don't want me to sing? They hired this fucking kid at the last minute. They didn't tell me a fucking thing. Look, we've been on that other side before. More than once. Yeah. Truth is, I didn't deliver. Well, it's a good thing I know the... ..how to play the guitar. It's fine, I'll do it. - You're gonna do it? - Sure. Hey, where's the wedges? Can't fucking hear with the... But, yeah, like I said, it's a real, real honour. Yeah. Oh, honour's mine. Yeah, you're great. It'll be fun. - Yeah, hope so. - Yeah. Who coulda been a crooner? Right? You remember what Paul said. Paul Anka told me I had more natural talent... - ..than Sinatra. - ..than Frank. - That's it! Do not... - Direct quote! Know what Paul Anka actually said? - No, what did he say? - He said... ""Would you please pull the car over and let me out over here on the kerb?"" All right, but... Oh, my God! Sweetheart. This is unreal. The Grammys. - Hey, look at everybody. How are you? - Hey, there he is! - Oh, thanks. - How are you? Are you OK? - What's that? - Are you OK? - Are you OK? - Oh. - I'm great. - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm great. They have me going in early, so I gotta go now and then... But I made sure that they tell me where you're sitting so I can go right after. - OK. - I don't wanna miss the award. - OK. - It's right before it. You just got that look on your face. I do? Watch. It's gone. Amazing. Gonna get to see you perform tonight, get to see you sing. Hey, Jack, that's an incredible... collection of vinyl you have in there. Take whatever you want. It's yours. - Take whatever I want? - He just said, ""Take whatever you want."" He's talking to the wrong guys. I thought he was supposed to be singing. Oh, it's over? It's over? - You good? - I'm fine. And the nominees are... - Right here? - Roxy Carlile. Hi. Are you OK? Come on, baby. Sit down, sit down, sit down. - Hi. You OK? - I was trying to go to the men's room - and they rushed me over here. - OK, put your legs inside. - I had to go to the bathroom. - Put your legs inside. They're announcing your fucking category. Keep quiet. - And the winner is... - Yeah... Oh... This is exciting. How great. Ally! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What happened? - We won! - Is that why everybody's... - Yep, that's right! Where are we going? Just stay right here. Go sit back there. Go sit back there. I'll stay here. Oh, my gosh, thank you! You look beautiful. Thank you! Oh, wow! Oh, my gosh! I can't believe I'm holding one of these. Thank you to Rez Gavron, my manager. - Thank you for believing in me... - Wait, did you win? ..and telling me to get back from behind the piano and onto the stage. Did you just win? Thank you to my...my... to Jack Maine, my husband. - Should I come up there? - I love you so much. I always wanted to be a singer on a big stage and because of him, I am. - We're having a lot of fun tonight. - Yeah. - I... - Shit. Look. - If I haven't thanked you yet, just... - Did you see you're up there? Yeah, I do. I started out singing with this beautiful man and I'll sing with him for life. - Right, baby? - Yeah. I'm so blessed to be in the company of such wonderful musicians. This is a dream come true, and all I can say is... ..believe in yourself and don't give up because there is a spot on that stage for you. - Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. - Good night. Oh, I think I peed... - I think I peed myself. - Turn around. Oh! - I think I... - Baby, baby, can you... - That's a bad come down. - Holy shit! - Take him to the shower. - Follow me, Wolf. Ally, go inside, OK? - It's on the left, Dad. - I got it. - Go inside! - They got him. - They got him! - It's my job! - Don't do this to my daughter! - Hey, hey! What the fuck is wrong with you? Get off! Damn it! Watch his fucking head. Watch! Watch! Bobby'll take you there. You have Bobby's number? No, Jack, you gotta sit up. I don't want you to choke, baby. Sit up! Sorry, I...I might've taken too much. - You all right in there? - I'm fine. He's fine. So, everybody has their journal... and we remember the homework assignment - the three things that I wanted you to write down. - Jack, hey. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. You can't be late, Jack. Understood. Sorry. Good. Where's your journal? - It's in my room. - No, no, no, no. No. Sit down. So, it's all agreed. Nobody's ever late here, right? OK. Good. Anything you wanna tell us? Um... I'm grateful to... ..to be here and... ..trying to hold it together. I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic. Jack. Drug addict. Oh... - This is all my fault. - You don't have that kind of power, Dad. Eat your dinner. Eat your food. Sorry. I don't even know what meal it is. Go on, have some fruit. How many times did you carry my piano up the stairs? How many times did you sit there while I wrote a song? - Always. - OK, it's OK. It's OK. You didn't do anything. It's not your fault. You're just the greatest person in the world. How long have you been here now? Two months. Can it be fixed? Well, you would know that, don't you? Once it's gone, it's gone. - I don't know what you have. - Oh, the tinnitus, they say, once you... - Well, tinnitus can't be fixed. - Right. Well, I just hear that tone, that's all. The tone, yeah. The ringing. - I have hearing aids on, as you... - I know. That's why I asked you. You know, I'm convinced that... ..it happened when I was younger. I used to... My dad had, like, a Victrola, you know, an old record player. My head was just about the size of it when I was a kid, and I used to love to just put my whole head in there. He was big into the blues, so... Cos you gotta figure, it's just me and him all day long. My brother's out there tryin' to make something of himself. So I took one of his belts. I put it around the... ..ceiling fan and... ..tried to do the deed. The whole fucking fan came out of the ceiling. Had a big cut on my fucking forehead. I was more mad about that than it not working. And he didn't even notice. He didn't even fucking notice. - Cos he was drunk? - Yeah. That fucking fan stayed on the floor for about half a year. How old were you then? I was just shy of 13. Oh... You smell good. You smell good, and you look good too. - I've been swimming. - You've been swimming? - Yeah, there's a pool. - I love that you're swimming. - That's a great pool there. - Yeah. How's Charlie? Oh, Charlie's sweet. He just sort of sits by the door like this. Waiting for Daddy. We're both waiting for Daddy. What, three weeks? You gonna come back, right?are  - What do you mean? - You gonna come home when you're done? - Do you not want me to? - No, I want you to. - I'm just wondering if... I just... - Where else would I go? - I don't know. I guess I just thought... - Why... - ..there's Jack... - Wait, wait. - Wait. Why would you say that? - I don't know. I guess... I wondered, without the booze, if you would want to come home. Cos when you met me, you were drinking, and now you're not. I wasn't drunk the whole time we were together. I know, but... But it got bad when we were together. It's OK. I mean, it's fine. I just was wondering, that's all, and whatever you want is OK. Whatever I want? I wanna be with you. - That's why I'm here. - OK. I know, I know. I just want you to be happy. I'm working on that. I need to stick with you. I brought something. I wanna know... ..what this is. ""My Love."" You hiding love songs? No, I wouldn't... I wouldn't say I was hiding it. I just um... I started puttin' it down to paper when we were at home. I don't know, it sort of fell out of me, I guess, and onto this page. And I put it in here, and I thought... I thought maybe you'd find it when... ..when you came back to you, maybe. Well, I found it. Listen. Um... Um... I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK. It's not your fault. I'm sorry I did that. It's OK. It's not your fault. It's a disease. No, but I embarrassed you. - I embarrassed you, and I... - I'm not embarrassed of you. It was so wrong. And then your...then your dad... My father loves you. It's OK. I know, but I... - It's OK. - I know, but I... It's OK. It's OK. I have figured out what I think is the best solution for both of us. Jack should come out on tour with me. We'll start with our duets. I know he's gonna be able - to play by himself. - You realise that's not an option. He's... He's so inside of his art in a way he has never been. - He can hear himself again. - Ally, there is no way that you can take Jack on tour with you. There's no way. Do you understand what I'm saying? If you can't make that happen, then fucking cancel the tour. I don't know what to tell you. I think if we had a better band name, we might've made it. Or maybe it was cos we looked like a father and son duo. Not many of those around. I was not a good look for you, that's for sure. Not my fault I couldn't find a better guitar player in the whole goddamn state. Where in the fuck is it? Right here. Thanks for the ride. Sure thing, Jack. Hey, you know...when I... ..when I said I... you know, when I... ..took your voice, you know. It was you I idolised. It wasn't Dad. Come here. What was that, guy? Hey. Hey. I wanna know how you hear this. That sounded unbelievable, what you were playing. - Thank you. - It's nice to hear it. Thank you, and I had the beautiful backdrop of you and Charlie. I only heard it in my mind for so many weeks, so it's good to hear it... You know. - The words are beautiful. - ..in the real thing. In the real thing. - Well, you want me to do that? - Mm-hm. Oh, God, I don't know. I knew you were gonna ask me. Back from the dead. - Hey, sorry. Were you waiting long? - No, no. Uh... Ally's not home. No, I told her I'd meet her here, if that's OK. Of course, yeah. Here you go. Hey, thanks for taking care of my girl when I was gone. Anything for her. She told me about that European leg. That's a hell of an accomplishment this soon out of the gate. Shit, I remember it was like...ten years before I even went across the pond. It was summer, 2004. Shit, was it? We're not exactly friends here. While you've been away, we've been back here in serious triage, trying to clean up your fucking mess. Barely finding our way through it. You almost single-handedly derailed her whole career. You understand that? She's never gonna say this to you. She loves you too much. Just by staying married to you, she looks like a joke. It's embarrassing. Let's be honest, we both know it's only a matter of time before that's pushed aside again for the real thing. And when that happens... ..I don't want her anywhere near you. Hey. I have some good news. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. I'm not gonna go to Europe. We're gonna cancel the rest of the tour, and I'm just gonna be here all summer. Isn't that great? - What happened? - Nothing happened. The label just loves the record, and it's doing so well and they wanna keep with the momentum and have me make another one. Rez is super psyched, so it'll be great. So tonight's gonna be my last show. Going out with a bang at the Forum. Great. Yeah. Why don't you come with me? We can sing Shallow together. The fans will go crazy to see you. Come on, cowboy. Yeah, why not? OK. Yeah? OK, good. I'll have a car come get you. When I... Once I get there. I'll go meet you there. I'll see you soon, OK? Hey. What? I just wanted to take another look at you. Bye, honey. Bye. Come here, Charlie. Come here. Thank you so much for bringing us all here together. Please look over all of the dancers tonight and the band. And my husband, Jackson. We're so excited for him to be here with us. We got a big night. We're at the Forum, LA. Let's do this. - Is he here? - He's not here. - He's not here? - We have to do Shallow regardless, OK? The guitar's up there. Everything's gonna remain the same. - What? - The guitar's up there. Everything's gonna remain the same. Both verses. - I'm sure it was just a bit much for him. - Please send somebody to the house. - I'm doing it right now. - I have 15 seconds. Give it up for my husband, Jackson! I can stay, if you want. Aargh! Some kid started singing one of his songs in a bar I was in the other night. They're playing his songs everywhere. At first I got angry. I don't know why. I guess I felt like... ..""How can any of these people feel like they knew him?"" Who he really was. But then something changed. And it soothed me. That it wasn't... wasn't all for fucking nothing. The last thing I did was lie to him. Listen to me. It isn't your fault. It just isn't. You know whose fault it was? Jack. That's it. No-one else. Not you, not me. No-one but Jack. I just keep... ..going over and over it, over it in my head. Jack talked about how music is essentially 12 notes between any octave. 12 notes and the octave repeats. It's the same story. Told over and over. Forever. All any artist can offer the world... is how they see those 12 notes. That's it. Hm. He loved how you see them. He just kept saying... ..""I love how she sees them, Bobby."" Hello, I'm Ally Maine. Thank you for being here tonight to honour my husband. He wrote a song for me. I'd like to sing it for him tonight. And, with your help, maybe I can. Thank you. Really. Thank you.

To call for hands of above to lean on  Wouldn't be good enough for me   To...  - We're still unpacking, but you get the idea. - Your mother chose the fittings. - It's like a display home. - Good, that's exactly what it is, so keep it clean. - And we're what, the display family? - Something like that. - Oi! Get out of it! Hey, this is private property! Neighbors. - Come on, Amy.

Thank you. - We need a cleaner. - Yeah, not that one. What? Where there's one teenager there's a hundred with booze and pills and dirty shoes tracking over the floors. You really want a repeat of the last house party? Fuck's sake! Well, if they want to fly first class from Shanghai, fly them first class. Well, if we don't move those plots soon, you can say ""sayonara"" to the whole deal! Yes, I know that's not a Chinese word. Just make it happen. There's some potential buyers flying in in a couple of days. Need to make a good impression, yeah? - You can get your hair cut if you want. Maybe hit the stores for a new outfit? - Great. - Great. - I liked her. That, uh... that local girl. - Hmm? Zoe? - Chloe. - Chloe. Right. - What is that? - It's just the house. She's making an effort. - Don't we know it. - Hey. You're a great Mum. - Hey, I'm at the bridge, how far are you guys? Call me back. Em? Fuckheads! - Hey, it's Em. Leave a message. - Em, were are you? Em, pick up. I know you're there. Em? - No, it's Rosie. - Oh, um, hey. Hey. Hey Rosie. Um, where are you guys? - We're at Em's. We haven't left yet. - What do you mean, you're still at Em's? Fuck. - Now's not a good time. - Well, can I talk to-- - She can't talk to you right now. - Why? - I mean, you can't force her into anything. - I never forced her into anything! - Are you fucking high? - What-- - You know what a bad influence you are? - Yeah, I'm the bad influence? Hey, fuck you, Rosie! - Oh, fuck you. Enjoy your night. - No no no-- Fuck! - Amy? - ( Amy shrieks ) - Amy! - Help! Help! - Okay, okay. Grab onto me. I've got you, okay? Use your feet. Come on. Okay, okay, hey, hey look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's Chloe. I'll take care of you. - You look like shit. - Since when do you work here? - Since I saved your arse. I said you were drunk. That's all. - We're not here to judge you. We just want to understand why. - I don't know. Guess I'm just bad. - What if the police found you? You know the deal. No drink, no drugs, seven o'clock curfew. - Yeah, I got the memo, thanks. - They'll send you straight back to jail. - There's all kinds of jails. - Oh, Amy, come on. - Don't touch me. - Hey! - You're to stay on the property! - I'll get her. - Chloe, wait! - Oh, leave her. She might listen to her. - Amy, stop. Amy! Where are you going? - Away. - You've got no shoes on. Amy look, if you uh... If you want to talk about anything, you know, seriously, if you need a friend. - I've got friends. They were going to pick me up last night until you stuck your nose in. - Amy! Amy, stop! - Fuck! - I told your folks I'd bring you back. - Well, that was dumb. And they're not my folks. - You're adopted? - Not just a pretty face, huh? - What are you doing? - Getting the fuck out of here. - Hey! Come here! Mojo! Mojo! Come here. Come on! Fuck sake. Come on, boy. - Don't you fuckin' dare. - Pull over! Amy! - Fuck! Who leaves their car on empty? What, are you sulking? Come on, that was fun. - Yeah, until we get arrested it's great. - Where are you going? - To tell your folks. - Kiss-arse. So what, you're just gonna abandon me? Hey! Hey! Don't think I'm just gonna let you waltz right back into your cushy cleaning job. Car thief. - Fuck, if you wanna leave, just leave. There's a bus that goes through town every afternoon. Get on it. Or are you all talk? - I just stole a fucking car. - Yeah, how's that working out for you? - What time's this bus? - I don't know. 3:00? - Fuck. - Here, let me. There's glass in it. - No, I just can't do it. The whole happy families routine. They're number five. Been with them since I was twelve. Part of Michelle's Catholic guilt trip. - Sounds fair. - Well it's true. They, um... They adopted out a baby girl when they were at Uni, and Michelle couldn't have kids after that. I'm her penance. - You're really working that angle, aren't you? - Yeah. I had this party at the old house and it all got pretty loose. Like we trashed the place. - Hey, it's all here. - Michelle called the cops and I glassed one of the pricks when he crash tackled my girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. Hey, um, come with me. - I can't leave my folks. Good luck. - Where am I gonna go? - Did you ever try to find your real folks? - Fuck, who says folks? Nuh, they didn't want me then. Why would they want me now? - Friend at school did. - And? - Yeah, he said it helped. - I don't need help. - Right. - When was the last time you heard that? - Can Chloe stay for dinner? Her Mum said it's okay. - Sure. - What? - You're wearing my clothes. - Yeah, I'm sorry. I hope you don't mind. I can... I can change if you want. - It's cool. I just wish I looked like that. - Tell us about yourself, Chloe. What do your parents do? - Oh, they're um, they're farmers. - Oh, what kind? I studied vet science, then I got married. - Oh, just you know, cows and sheep and stuff. - And what about you? You going to stay on the farm? - No, no. Um... I really like fashion and design, so I'd like to study interior design. - Mmm. - Yeah. - What's with the twenty questions? Just let her eat. Amy Samantha Anderson. 17 years old. That's disgusting. - Eating meat's disgusting. - Okay, so you're a vegetarian. - I eat pussy. - What do you want to say about yourself? ""I'm a high achieving straight A student. My hobbies are horseriding and swimming."" - I'm looking for my parents, not a date with somebody called Chad. - You gotta grab their attention. - Okay, ""My adoptive parents fully support me on this. ""If you're out there, Mum and Dad, I'd love to get in contact with you."" - There's two Ps in support. And why'd you capitalise ""Adoptive Parents""? Move. Oh, or is it better if they think I'm dyslexic? Okay. - Send it. - Amy? - No! - It's late. - No, it's not. - I should go. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - You sure you don't need a lift? - Oh no, there's a shortcut over the hill. Actually, you can see the river. I should show you sometime. - It's a date. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - You think her parents'd swap? - Don't! You could ask. - Shit. - Hey. - CHLOE: Hey. Hi. - I got an email. - CHLOE: From who? - My parents. - CHLOE: Bullshit. No way. - Fuck, Chloe, they... They want to meet. - Hello! What have you done with Amy? - Ah, Chloe invited me over. Just for a few hours. - Okay. Just so long as you're back before dark. - Hey! Yeah you, princess! - I told you, this was private property! - Yeah? And so is our fuckin' car! - Where is it? - Where's what? - The car. - Hey. - Hey, leave her alone! - I'm gonna count to three. - Good luck with that. - One... - Do something. I dare ya. Come on. - Two. - Amy! Amy! - Fuckin' stay there. - Piss off, you dickwads! - Fuck off! - Go on! - I'll see you soon. - Fuck off! - You're fuckin' all talk when we're walking away, aren't ya? - Fuck you, mate. - Amy, what car? - I don't know. - So I can report this? - Do whatever you want. - Like I'd steal their shitbox anyway. - It wasn't Amy. She was with me all day. I'm sorry about them. Are you guys okay? - Yeah. Michelle just went all tiger Mum on those dickheads. Sorry, dickwads. - You ready? - Uh, yeah. - Say hi to your parents. - Okay. - Since when you and Michelle friends? - Why do you care? - I don't. - Andrea and Bob Kovack. Jesus, they could be anyone. - Yeah, like your real parents. - Yeah, but how will I know? - You just do. There's this connection. - How do I look? - Better. Here. You're nervous, come on. To Andrea and Bob, bless em. - What if they don't like me? - They can take a ticket and get in line. - What do you think? - Yeah, could be. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Ah, you're the Kovacks? - Sorry? - Um... - Look, don't worry. You just got here. Okay? - Yeah. - What am I doing? - No, come on. - Fuck this. Let's go. - Come on, let's have another drink. - Nuh. - Shit. Walk. - Oi! - Fuck! - It's more than trespassing, it's harassment. Well, what if it was your daughter? Right. Serpentine's finest are going to give the neighbors a caution. We'll see. - Hey there. How was Chloe's? - Good. - Amy? We're meeting the investors in the city tomorrow. I'd like you to come. I don't want you here alone. - Fine. - Everything okay? Family tradition says I should wait till you get married, but, um... I guess we're not a traditional family, are we? Can I? - Um... - It's beautiful. You can tell me anything. You know that. - Thanks. For the thing. - What? - CHLOE: I saw them. Your folks. They're checking into a room at the hotel. - Bullshit. - No, seriously, I'm there right now. I'll show you. - AMY: How can I trust you? - I thought we were going to be arrested. I freaked. I'm sorry. - What room? - Room six. You're sure? - You ready? - No. Is that Michelle's? - Kiss it out, bitch. That's pretty. - Family heirloom. - Oh. - They're not here. - Come on. Help me jiggle this door. - AMY: What are you doing? I thought you were a good girl. - Not always. - Chloe. - Fuck em! They are. Send 'em a message. Go on! Feel good? Hey. To, uh, bad girls. - Whatever. - Oh shit. - Why do you have that? - Show me how to use it. - No way. What if someone comes? - Come on, show me. FYI, this is a penis. What? - It's dumb. I just... I just really wanted them to be here, you know? Just to say, ""Hey, I'm here. I exist."" - Hey. Hey, look at me. You exist. - Ah, fuck you, you motherless bitch! - What? - ( alarm beeping ) - Shit! - It's cool, it's cool. It's okay. - Fuck, Chloe. - Where are you going? - Home. Home. - Shit. - You ready? We're leaving soon. - Yeah, I'm kinda feeling a bit crap. - Really? Oh, you don't have a temperature. - Well... It's just everything catching up with me. - Okay. Just keep the doors locked and if those idiots come on the property, call the police. I mean it. - Hi, this is Chloe. I'm not here right now, but please leave a message. - Hey, please tell me we didn't leave the pipe at the hotel. My prints are all over it. I'm going back now before they open up the room. Call me back. Fuck. Get the fuck off our property! - Christ! Didn't you hear me knock? Amy Anderson? - Why, are you a cop? - Is that a yes? - Look, I don't have to answer anything without a guardian or a lawyer present. - So you're alone? - This is bullshit. I didn't do anything. - Detective Daniels. I'm looking for her. - Jessica? - Or Jessie? - No, I don't know a Jessica. - Right. What about your Mum and Dad? - Nuh. We just moved in. - Right. - What'd she do? - Hurt someone. - She turns up... Call. She's trouble. Think quick. - Mr. Buchanan? - You're here to see Chloe. Hey, Chloe! You got a visitor! - Ah, sorry. Hey, uh, you need to call me. - Oh God! - Fuck! - Where...what are-- what are you doing here? I thought you were in the city. - Me? What are you doing here? - I'm cleaning. Michelle rostered me on. - Cleaning? - Yeah. Ah, the hot water's out at our house, so... What's wrong? My phone was dead. - There was someone here asking about you. Who? - A detective. Some tough old bitch. - What'd you tell her? - Well, what's to tell? All I know is you live a K up the road, third house on the left, yeah? - Okay, look, don't tell your folks but some money went missing at this house I used to clean. I mean it wasn't me but, you know, try telling the owners that. - Fuck, you're good. Who's Jessie Cooper? - Uh... Well, um... She's... I... This is it. - How long have you been here? - A couple of weeks. - Fuck. Why didn't you say? - I didn't want you to hate me. Why would I hate you? What's this? You're pregnant? - Check the name. - Fuck off. This isn't you. - Isn't it? - No way. You're serious. But you haven't told them. - I didn't have to. I mean, they know. - How? - There's this connection. I mean, I just felt it the first time I saw them-- - That's bullshit. So, what, you're adopted too? Well, that's convenient. - Yeah, see, we find each other, you know. It's weird, right? - Yeah, it's weird because you kept it secret for so long. - I didn't want you to freak out, you know and you kind of are-- - Yeah, it's because you're full of shit. Fuck, is... Is anything about you real? - Amy. - How do I know these aren't fake? - Michelle had them stashed at your house. - Oh, cool. So now you're going through our stuff. So you're a thief and a con artist. - Amy! Amy! Amy, Amy please, I'm telling the truth. - Who is, Chloe or Jessie? Maybe I'll just ask the detective. - Amy? Hey. Hey, I'm sorry. - Ow-- - Shh, shh. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm going to take you to the hospital. - Just rest. - Mum? - Perfect time of day to show it off. Designed that way, of course. - The door's open. - This is very nice. - Buy the other plots, I'll throw it in for free. Well, for cost at least. Should we take the tour? - What? - The Beamer. - Peter! Jesus. Amy! - Holy shit! We'll deal with it. Just get them out of here. - Amy! - You said she was clean. - She is. Just go, please. We'll talk about it tonight. That's it. - This is Amy. Go fuck yourself at the beep. - You win, Amy, okay? You want out, you're out. You come back here, I will haul your arse to the cops myself. Fuck! Hey, come on. We have to be strong. - If I was strong we wouldn't have moved! - Michelle! - Didn't I say she'd hate it here? - Don't you dare. This is not our fault. We have bent over backwards for that girl. - Oh, just move on, right? Get over it. - Fuck it. Yes. Why should we all suffer because you feel guilty? We could have adopted a baby but no you had to choose the most fucked up kid you could find. - You're talking about our daughter. - She wants out, Michelle. Let her go. Where're you going? - To find her. - Michelle! Hey, Michelle! For fuck's sake! - This is Amy. Go fuck yourself at the beep. - PETER: Amy, it's Dad. I'm sorry about what I said before. Please come home. We love you. Anything? - I checked with all her old friends. The ones she told us about, anyway. - We have to report her missing. She's going to end up in detention one way or another. Better for breaking parole than on some drug or burglary charge. She turned up to see Amy. - I don't know if it's anything, but I found this in her room. - Did she ever say anything about leaving? - Not, uh, not leaving. - What? Chloe, if you know something... - The night that I, um, found her on the bridge... I think she was gonna jump if I hadn't... you know, gotten there. It's not your fault. - Amy? - Shit. - Peter. Oh my God. - Stay back. - Hey. Amy! Darling! Amy! - Amy! - Hello! - Amy? Amy! Amy! - Amy, darling, please let us know you're okay. We're so worried. - Amy! Amy! - Hey! - What is it? - It's Amy's. She sent me a message. - ""Tell Mum and Dad not to freak. I'm okay. In town, trying to get a lift."" - We can still catch her. - What? - ""Mum and Dad""? - Hey! Wait! - If we can't find her, we're going to the police. You don't mind giving a statement? - What... What do I say? - Just anything that can help us find her. - But I told you everything I know. - Oh, come on. Come on come on come on. - Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck. - Ah, can I help you? - Yeah, I need to use your phone. - I know you. You're famous, right? You're the girl off the TV. - Come here you little vandal! - Fuck! Hey! Hey, hey are you going down there? Hey! Hey! Pete! Hey! Peter! - I really... I don't... I don't feel good. I need to... I need to get out. Please, stop. - What about your statement? - I really don't feel well. We can do it another time, right? - Listen, it's okay, it's okay. - The police station's just here. - She's gonna be alright. - Yeah. - What was that? - I don't know. She's upset. Amy's her friend. - Amy! Hello? - ( muffled crying ) - Hello? - Hon, is that you? - I'm sorry, Mum. - Where are you? - Please, I'm safe. Don't look for me. - No Amy, hang on. Who are you with? Amy-- - ( phone beeps ) - Call her again. - Fuck me. Hello? Detective Daniels, this is Amy Anderson. We spoke yesterday about Jessie. Um... You said to call if she-- - ( door opens ) - Amy, I know you're here! Are you all right? - She's here. - Amy, I'm sorry. Amy? My God, we're all freaking out. Amy? Amy? Amy? Amy, I'm sorry. Amy, please just tell me-- - Get the fuck out of my house. Get out! - But I didn't mean any of this to happen! - Now! Go! Get out of my house! Go! - Amy, you're not thinking straight. - Get out! - You're not thinking straight. I'll make you some food. I'll get you some coffee. - No, you're not listening to me. I want you out of my house. - It was an accident, Amy. - Bullshit! You've been trying to get rid of me from the start. The cops at the pub. Fuck, my biological parents? Where did you get that photo? - Why would I do that? - Stop lying! - Okay fine, I got the photo from a magazine, okay? You were talking about leaving. I was trying to help you. - By trying to kill me, you psycho cunt? - Okay, see, I knew you'd hate me. - Gimme back my necklace. - No. - Why? - I can't. Mum said it should stay in the family. - Mum? - I'm sorry, Michelle. That's what you call her, isn't it? - Help! Help! Help! - We don't want her charged, just found before she hurts herself. - We've checked with all her friends. - And what about anyone local? - There's only Chloe, but she was here this morning helping us clean up. - Chloe Buchanan? Okay. I thought I saw her working at the supermarket. - Amy! Amy! Amy, stop! Amy! You'd better run, you bitch! They don't want you! Nobody does! - I'm sorry about your house. - Oh, fuck the house. Come here. - Chloe! - Amy, she's out there. She tried to kill me. - Jesus, this is going to need stitches. - Where is she? - Ah, she's still out there. - Come here, come here. - Amy! - No, wait, no you can't... She said she wanted to kill us. We've gotta call the police. - She did this? Why? - I don't know. I think she's high. - Where did you get this? - Amy. She gave it to me. She said she felt like the family pet. That it was your leash around her neck. I'm so sorry, Mum. I've wrecked everything. - Hey! Hey! Stop! - Come on, Chloe. Chloe, open up. Chloe! - This is bullshit! She's playing us. - Why would she? - I don't know. Nice house, we've got money. She wants in. - Come on. - Chloe, come on. Open the door. What if it's her? Hey. Oh God. - I don't feel very good. - Please, I need... You have to get me home. - Are you all right? - I need to get home, please. - No, no, no, please don't-- - Dog. - That's for the fuckin' car. - I thought she would want a sister. But when I showed her, she... She freaked out. She said I was trying to steal her family. I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have gone through your things but I needed some proof. - You said the Buchanans were your parents. - No. No, I never lied to you. I never. I just... I didn't know how to tell you the truth. - How did you find us? - I saw you in a magazine outside one of your houses. I could just tell. - From a photo? - Why keep all of this a secret? - I didn't think you would want me. - So you don't live here. And your real name's? - You tell me. You must have given me a name. - I know it's hard to understand, but we were young and broke and I got really sick when you... When she was born. - Michelle! - It's okay. I'm here now. - Oh. - I told you she was trouble. - Are they really her parents? - Open the glovebox. See if you recognise anything there. She fixates. This is not the first family that she's tried this with. - Detective Daniels, huh? - Uh-huh. - I've always wanted to live in a place like this. Big house. Big yard. - What about parents or guardians? Surely there's someone we can call. - It's just me. - Chloe, you can't just move in with us. - Please don't make me go, Mum. - Jess. That's enough. - Amy! - Time to go home, love. - No. - Yes. - I don't know this woman. - You're a lying bitch! Please, I'm your sister! - Give me it! - Get off her. - Give me it! - Please, please! I'll do whatever you tell me to. Please don't make me go! - Hand her over. She's not well. - Yeah, no shit! - She's a con artist. What are you today? A cop? A lawyer? She lives in fuckin' fantasy land. - Okay. Her name is Jessie Cooper, okay? She is seventeen years old. She was born in Castlemaine Hospital on the 15th of February. Here's where they dragged her out of me. Is that real enough for you? Let's go. - No. - Come on. - No, she's a drunk, old fat loser. You're my folks, right Mum? - Fuck this! Call the cops! - What, and tell them how you stole the car and how you trashed the hotel? And how you tried to fucking kill me? You're next.

Coco Chanel could smoke where she liked. Chanel was... Sorry, but there's no comparison there. Why is that? Why is that? - I raised a kid on my own... - Give her a lighter. - I don't have one. - Go get one. And an ashtray. Yes, Sir! - What's your profession? - I'm a nurse. - Hmm. -""Hmm""? What's with the ""hmm""? - Beoause you think I failed as a mother? - Have you? Are you taking me for a fool? I already said everything to your dumb colleagues on the phone. My daughter left home when she was 16, and we haven't been in contact since. And why is that? - Do you have Children? - No. Then stop looking down on me and annoying me with that hypocritical look of yours. - Finally! - Here you are. My colleague will be taking over. Let us know if she gets in touch. Of course. - Are you out of coffee? - W hat? Coffee? No, Kim. Look after her for a bit longer. I'll pay you for it. I can't right now. I don't know how long.

Please, be quiet. I have to think. Why are we here? - What's going on? - You're staying here. What? Why? Wait, you can't just... When will you be back? You are coming back, right? You can't just leave me here! - What if something happens? - You'll be out of my life. Stop! Come back! You can't just leave me here! I'll scream until someone hears me. Quit that! I'll come back for you. You're lying! You're going to leave me here to die! I'll scream until the cops come. I'll tell them everything! - Oh, God! No! - Shit. Hello? Hello? Mom! Come here! The perp may have stolen jewelry worth half a million euros according to Ingrid von Kaiten, head of... Oh, God! Oh, God. I can't take it anymore, Harry. I can't take it anymore. What's wrong with her? Don't tell me this is normal! - Oh! What's up with her? - Ask her. - Her poop was green. - Was it foamy? - What? - Her stool. - No. - It's fine, then. Everything except purple poop is normal. - Careful there. Careful. - See? Everything except purple is normal. Oh, no... - What? - Quack, quack. - Are you stalking me? - Have you made a decision, wimp? Find yourself another gorilla. Am I invisible? You're not. Why doesn't she let the hostage go? - No idea. Maybe she's not a hostage at all. - Yeah, you should go investigate. - What's the plan? - To dye your hair. What? Why are we dyeing my hair? Because they'll recognize you and I can't have you with me. Where will we dye it? No. No. No way. Forget it. I'm not sticking my head in there. It's full of truck driver pee. I have to try and find a new buyer because of you. And I hate not being prepared. I have no idea what you just said, but I'm not dying my hair. - You're a real top prize, aren't you? - Why'? You in a rush? That was really fucking mean of you! - Don't! I hate when people are too close! - Oh, really? You have aggression issues. Stop crying. I had no choice. How can we prevent your panic attacks? Your mom has panic attacks. It's just stress. Pull yourself together. You might not believe it, but I'm the only person you have. Yippee... I play ""Banana Kong"" when I'm stressed. -""Banana"" what? - Don't you speak English? - I'll shoot you if you call someone. - I know. - What are you doing? - Playing... - With sound? - It's calming. Okay. I'll do the talking and you stay quiet. Got it? If they ask, we're partners and we work for Gatsky. Okay? - Who's Gassky? -""Gatsky"". Our protection. If they realize we're just two girls on our own, we're screwed. What? I've Changed my mind. I'm out. Pull yourself together! Oh, God! Does Brad Pitt live here, too? What if he asks me something? I can't lie. Okay. Get down. Down. Thank you. - Who's that? - Shit. What are you doing? - Give it back! - Shut up. You're staying in the car. It's Mel. - Sweetheart! - I've got something for Enno. It's worth 500, but it's yours for 300. - And it's from Gatsky? - Yes. It's not my field of expertise. Who says it's real? - I do. - Oh... It's now or never. If you're in, then Gatsky will have more deals for you. Look what I found. Hey! Let her go. Come here. - Boo! - Hey! Quit that! Why are you sweating? Scared? Don't be scared of me. - I told you to leave her alone. - We're just chatting. We're with Gassky! Gassky's team. Gassky's team... Let her go. You're not Gatsky's team. Come on! Come on! Shit! This way. Shit! Get in! Get in! Oh, God! Oh, God! Shit! You dirty rabble! Shit! Oh, God! Oh, God! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I emailed you the information about our hostage. Oh, God... It's your hostage. What do you want? Oh, my God, Leine! We were a good team. Don't be like that. For one mission that we messed up? It wasn't a mission. He was my friend. Have you been to his house? To see his wife and kids? No. That's not really your thing, is it? Look at what I've sent you. I'm not your partner anymore. Get it? Finally! I know that, you asshole. Fuck! Thank you. You're welcome. Kim, are you okay? Is Holly okay? No, everything's fine. I just wanted to make sure. What's wrong? What was that? What's wrong? Please, tell me... - Piss off! Piss off! Piss off, dammit! Leave me alone! What? What... What do you mean? Just go. Piss off! But... I don't know where we are. Where shall I go? No idea. Home? Don't start crying now... I can't stand your crying. But... You can't just tell me to go, just like that. I'm sorry that you're in this mess because of me and I'd really like to make it up to you and help you. You can't help me. ""Strength isn't doing everything alone, but about asking for help."" What? ""Strength isn't doing everything alone, but about asking for help."" - Where did you hear that shit? - From some ""say 'yes' to a 'no'"" calendar. I'm not going. Sorry for getting you involved in all of this. It's not so bad. I had no plans anyway. What's your name, anyway? Mel. Mel? ""Mel"" like ""Mel Gibson"" or something? Yes, that's it. 442. Disorderly conduct at ""Desir"". Could you go check it out? Sorry. Yes, we're on our way. What? - Where to? -""Desir"". ""Desire""? It's in the sticks. Who keeps filing complaints? 'Ll I can't take her to ""Desire . She'll be traumatized. Take the baby and go. I'll go alone. Thank you. I've read that whatever happens in your first two years, becomes so ingrained in your subconscious... She'd become a prostitute. - I owe you one. - Close the door. - Close the door. - I will. - Close the door, okay? - Say ""bye"". The door... My name's Franziska. - Great. - But call me Franny. I hate my name. I... - You look like shit. - Oh, really? Did it... Did it... Didn't it turn out well? Careful. - Hey, Mel. - Hey. - Have you also done all that? - Stay here and don't do anything. - Don't talk to anyone. Got it? - Yes. No talking. - Why is she here? - Gatsky will be happy. Tarek, calm down. The guy's been banned. You can't keep causing a fuss. Coco. Harry's thirsty. Get him a drink. - You look like shit. - Yeah, thanks. Get yourself a missus. Your bad mood is too much to handle. What about you? Go get Changed. I'm all done. - Is she new? - Who'? - Her. - What? She's way too old and has no tits. I'll go get my things. Don't go anywhere. I don't want to harm your kid, of course. I'm not a monster. How did you imagine it? You want to stop working for me, take on anyjob you can and go solo? And you use my name? I need the money. What's your plan? I want out. I want to stop. I want out of here. Come on, Ingrid. Mel'? Mel'? It burns! Fuck! I can't see! I can't see! It's simple. It's the same as always. If I'm involved, then I want my share. 50/50. Those are the rules. But you already know that. I can't give you your share. I don't have it. I've lost it. - What? - I've lost it, okay? Then make sure you find it. I want my share. If you don't, you'll be my woman at last. For her, I'd make an exception. I miss you so much. Stop. Think about it. Could you make us a drink? - What's that? I can't see. - Sit down. Come on. It burns. It burns. It burns. Thanks, it's been lovely, but I'm in a rush. Stay here. Okay. Yes, okay. But I don't want to talk. I've got nothing against strippers. I really don't. You're cute, but I don't have any money and you must be expensive. Yeah. Drink something first. Your outfit looks so fake. It's such a turn-off. I'm not a stripper. I'm a police officer. Yeah, right. I bet you have handcuffs and a loaded gun. Flirting isn't your thing, is it? Excuse me. - It's okay. I'll CONTACT YOU REGARDING YOUR HISTAGE - Hey! - Where were you? I was looking for you. - Hey! - Franziska! Hey, Harry? Hello? Harry? Hello? - What? He was a stripper! - He knows your name! - No, he doesn't! - He just said it! He's a cop! I left you alone for five minutes! - He started it! It wasn't my fault! - Are you crazy? Sorry. You can trust me. Normally, I'm reliable. Shit! I'm leaving a trail! - Get in and drive! - Why me again? - I have no idea! It won't go into gear! - Are you nuts? - The handbrake is on! - What's wrong with it? The handbrake! - Shit! You're so aggressive! - Go left. - Yes, I know. - Just drive! Turn right. See? He was a stripper. - Oh, God! That wasn't him! It wasn't! - Stop the car! Oh, God! We can't just leave him there! What if I've run him over? Calm down. I'll go check. - You stay here. - Okay. Okay. Come on. Move. - Are you done? - I don't know. Is he alive? No, he's all crushed. Tell her you're alive or she'll puke all over my car. - I'm still alive. - Louder. I'm still alive! I'm so sorry I ran you over. - You didn't. - I didn't mean to. I even liked you. Must've been a road bump. It wasn't me. - I panicked... - You didn't run me over. - I've never done that before. - Just a bump. Enough! Tie his hands behind his back. But... - Do it! - He's a cop! You have to do something about your aggression problem. You two a team? - No. - Why was she alone in the club then? I told her that if she ran off, I'd find her and kill her. Find his cell. I'm sorry. You're bleeding. Yep. Back left pocket. Back left pocket! You can't take a cop as a hostage! Why is he on my case then? Why is a cop on my case? - Why all the shouting? - So you can hear me! There's no need to shout at me! - How did you know we'd be there? - I didn't. - So you were there out of frustration? - That's shockingly true. I was just on patrol. What's Kaiten like? The task force boss. You'll be meeting her soon. - I'll be right back, okay? - Okay. Okay, then. - Okay, then... Undress. - Very well. - Wait. I've nearly got it. - Yeah, yeah. Calm down. Okay. Are you the brain or the body? I haven't figured it out yet. Am I the Hulk? I know, darling. It won't take much longer. I'll be home soon. Hey! Don't cry. I'll sing you a song. What would you like me to sing? I'll sing you the tramp song, okay? Are you all tucked in? Okay.

I'm o s o r r y I'm o s o r r y Can I have a sip? - I hate cats. - W hat? My mother gave me a cat so I wouldn't feel alone at night when she wasn't there. She always bit my feet, and every time I hid, she'd scratch at the door. 80 creepy! - I couldn't sleep until Mom was back. - Where was she? I told you. On the other side of the door. - Oh, God! - No. I meant your mother. Oh! I have no idea. Looking for men. - She thought that would fix her life. - Maybe she didn't want to be alone. Alone with you. Oh, that's awesome! Are you for real? Why? It's great. Please, don't... Come on! Come on! Come on! Come! Come on! Timmsen! - You'll be the end of me. - I can't reach Leine. - What does he have to do with this? - I checked his cell data. Of course you did! Just like that. He called and sent me a cryptic text. ""It's about your histage"". I don't get it. He never calls at night. Something's wrong. Yeah... He meant to write ""hostage"". - What? - He meant to write ""hostage"". He mistyped it. He meant to type an ""0"" instead of an ""I"". - He was at ""Desire' .Gatsky owns it. - You mean ""Desire"" . Okay... Frank Gatsky. He's in the club business. He was in Luckau-Duben prison between 2005 and 2009. For robbery. He specialized in robbing... jewelers. We have to go. Okay. Where to? And him? Does he have to pee? Do you have to pee? Shake it well. Franny! Did you lay me on top of the cop? - Should I be worried? - What? No. I won't start anything with him. - Why should I? You nuts? He looks like... - Can I trust you or not? - Yes, you can trust me. - Good. What do we need these for? Did you think we'd just sit and drink coffee? - Thank you. - Thank you. Bye. - It's all too brutal. - You wanted to come along. - I don't even know how to shoot. - I'll teach you. Oh, right. Got it. Yes. Okay. Okay. Very good. Okay. Thanks. No video surveillance at the gas station. But we know what they bought. If it was even them. Plastic gloves, bananas, cola, shoes, size 7... Kinnert's size. They've checked. - He gets to drive that and I get a Golf? - What? Who? Isn't it great? We sacrifice our lives and drive VWs. Mercedes. We drive a... Mercedes. It's... Oh! Aren't we going to go inside? Was he here yesterday? Ingrid... Tell us, or I'll stick it right in and you'll be swallowing bullets. Got something to say? I don't understand a word. He was at the bar and then ran after Gatsky's ex. - What's her name? - Mel! That's all I know! Mel. ""Mel"" like ""Mel Gibson"" or something? -""Melanie""? - Oh, Timmsen. You're so sweet. Since we're talking, who's this Gatsky? - Nobody. - Your mom's a nobody. Were you an item? We get the diamonds and he gets his share. 50/50. That's the deal. Now, shut it. - W hat? - We do the dirty work and he gets 50%'? - You're so clueless. - And you can't negotiate. - Shut up. Okay, but I have to do something first. Careful. - Thanks. - Welcome. Is he being sprayed, too? There was a hole. Sorry. Regarding that ""nobody""... Will he just let you 90 once you've given him his share? - One can't leave such an association. - Association? - Gang, mafia... Whatever. - He won't harm me. Were you an item? - It's complicated. - Your mom's complicated. - All that mom-talk is so awkward. - Your mom's awkward. I feel embarrassed for you. - Your mom's embarrassed. - His name is Frank and we were an item. -50% is too much. - You'll negotiate next time then. Okay. Your mom's a chicken. - I'm hungry. - We only just ate! What a wonk. Yo! Melanie Rossbach. Oh, yes. Of course. Listen up. She was put into a home at five, parents lost custody, she didn't finish school, etc. She worked for Gatsky in one of his ""security"" companies. - Is she in the system? - No. - Okay. You can leave now. - Okay. Oh, she has a 5-year-old daughter. Lucky kid. I'll go check the workshop. Can I leave you two alone? Sure. What? Nothing. What workshop? Why are you still only on patrol? Can I have some, too? Sure. What's your plan? Got any gunshot wounds? Is that why you're only a beat cop? I don't talk about that. Are you sad you're just a beat cop? When this is over, want to meet up again? We could go for dinner or to the movies. I mean, what are your plans? Hello. He always does that. When he drinks, then... She doesn't talk to strange men. Women can be bad, too, you know. Yes, but I didn't like him. Wait a sec. Why don't you have the key on you? - Hi. - Detective Squad. I'll call you back. Oh, God. Stop! Bring in the forensic dudes. Hello! You can't just... Hello? Hello! Have you even got a search thingy? - Where's Ms. Rossbach? - No idea. How long have you been looking after her kid? What happened? I have no idea. I'm having a mental blackout. What's going on? Don't touch me! Has something happened? We met at the playground. That was yesterday. She paid me for looking after Holly. Waiting for someone? Are you going on holiday? Did your Mom ask you not to tell anyone? Will she be coming back? Here's your frog. I almost feel sorry for her. So, she didn't mean it and accidentally took a hostage? - No, but take a look around. - Quit winging. Send her pic to every motel, hotel and campground in and around Berlin. How did you know I was here? Relax. Let's go grab a bite. Get in. Come on. A new dress? But why? No one watches you on TV anyway. I bought it so I could be prepared. We're out of candy. There's some toffee in my pants. ...a one-of-a-kind company. Isn't that great? - There's some toffee in your pants? - Yes. Some toffee. I don't believe in horoscopes. Yet, you believe that a girl in Playboy... - There's no toffee in there. - And these are not my pants. Let's take a look at your horoscope. When's your birthday? We've sat here before. Remember? On these same seats. This is where I first saw you. That was a long time ago. Made a decision yet? I'll have your share tomorrow. You think you can manage on your own. Call home. The cops were there. Enjoy your gin and tonic. Fuck it. - Untie my hands so I can use them. - I like it like this. We can run off together. Untie me. They all still think you're a hostage. Do you always talk so much? Seriously, now... What will happen once it's over? Think she'll take you with her? I'm not in the mood anymore. Sorry. Okay, Kim. Who was there? Kim, calm down. There's an envelope with 1,700 euros in Holly's case. Take Holly to Bim Bum Land tomorrow morning with her case. Repeat what I said. With her case. Okay. Put these on. We're off. I didn't untie him. - What are those for? - He won't run. Because you took his dick hostage? - Why are you being so bitchy? - What's the plan? Quit it. This isn't some sort of adventure trip! Are you really taking her with you? - Why are you so flustered? - What is she to you? - Is she your chicken? - Chicken? No, she's not. - What chicken? - To distract them and get shot instead. - Am I your chicken? - You're nothing to me. This was a mistake. You don't know what it means to be needed. You throw yourself at men. Did your mom teach you that? It's all mom's fault. Why blame yourself? You'd rather spend your life running. That's right. Ms. I've-Seen-It-All. I'm not as stupid as you. At least I put a condom on them and don't have an abandoned child. Hey, sweetheart. It's me. Nice piece. Know what one can do with it? Give me the code to the safe. You're quite a funny pussy commando, aren't you? Fuck, man! Are you nuts? Are you crazy, you cunt? - God! Stop it! - The code. I don't know it! 13-07-19-00! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Oh, man! - Why are they loose? Are they all there? - Cunt! - You've already called me that. - You slut! I'll get you! You cunt! - Okay. At what time exactly? -11 pm. - Hey. - Forensics are on their way. They're useless, anyway. They had pizza. Stay calm. Stay calm. I'm going to remove the tape now. Don't scream. You really think I'll let you go? Hand over the diamonds. ""I'm big, strong Mel. I can do everything alone. I'm made of steel. No one can help me. Especially not someone with a pussy name like 'Franny'. My name is Mel, like Mel Gibson."" Oh, my God. What was that? - What was that? - Shit. What happened to Mel? Okay... I'm unarmed. - Nice and easy. - Hands on the car. We must go to her. We have to get her out of there. - When I say ""now"", start running. - Okay. Just run, okay? Now! - You've been shot! - Just a flesh wound. Come on. Come on. Behind that. Come on. Come on. - Okay. Stay here. - Okay. Okay. - Harry, she moved! I must go to her. - Hey! Wait... Get out of here! Go! I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Where's your gun? Where's your gun, Mel? Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! Oh, God! Screw it. Is he dead? He's dead. He's dead. Do you hear me? It's all over. - I'll call an ambulance. - Okay. - You must pick Holly up from Bim Bum Land. - What? You must pick Holly up from Bim Bum Land. Ingrid, it's Leine. There's been a shooting at the abandoned power station. I wasn't able to until now. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Why explain now? Just come here. Come on. Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? - I'm getting her out of here! - No, you're not! You were simply a hostage. You can just walk away. - I'm sorry. - What's wrong now? We have to pick up her kid from Bim Bum Land. Bim Bum Land? What's Bim Bum Land? We have to pick up her kid from Bim Bum Land! Put her legs in the car. - Okay. Close the door. - No. I can't protect you anymore. Shit! This is just shit! Timmsen! Send their pictures to every hospital. I want to know if two women ShOW up. - They killed Gatsky? - Self-defense. - Are they working together? - No idea. Don't bullshit to me. Are they? Who cares what I say? You never listen to me. What do you want from me anyway? I'll call you back. I need to get back to work. - Happy shopping! - I know. - Shall I take your case? - No. She's coming out without the kid. Are you hurt? But a friend of mine is. I need your help. - What's up, pumpkin? - Kinnert's mother... Isn't she a nurse? Timmsen! Give her one every six hours. Keep an eye on the wound. You need to keep an eye on it. A doctor has to look at it. By tomorrow. And Franziska, you... Hey! Bingo! An ambulance has gone missing! Wait a sec. - Hey, Timmsen. - What is it? - Give me your phone. - Huh'? Hey. I need you to do me a favor. Franny? Yes? They know who I am. You have to stop. I'm not going to stop. Screw that! I've got the diamonds. We'll get Holly and we'll manage somehow. I bet they've got Holly by now. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God. Highway 101 is closed off. Get ready to raid the vehicle. Lower your weapons! They have to lower their weapons! Relax. They won't shoot. - Franny'? - Stop bugging me. I'm negotiating. What are you doing? Ingrid! The call center received a call. It's Kinnert and she'll only speak with you. We need a radio here, damn it! - Ingrid von Kaiten. Who am I talking to? - This is Franz/ska Kinnert. The hostage-taker wants to talk to you alone in the ambulance or she'll shoot me. I'm scared. Your mom's scared. And the mother is involved in a police investigation? - Yes, but that's all I can say. - And, if I may ask... No! You may not. That's the thing. What are you staring at? Yes! Men are fathers too! Come along. Awesome outfit, by the way. - You can't go in alone! - Leine. Can I go in there alone? - Yes. - Anything else you want to tell me? Be nice. Ingrid von Kaiten. I'm unarmed and coming in. What's your ideal scenario? What's yours? Why isn't anyone saying anything? We can't hear anything, damn it! It was a stupid idea! Let's go in! Leine! Shit! It's showtime, ladies. Ready? - I hear something! - There's a video. He sent it to her, as a threat. Frank Gatsky? Yes. I wanted out, but he wouldn't let me go. He blackmailed her. Into robbing the jeweler? Yes. Let's go, Timmsen. Just send the paramedics. What? Why? I'll fill in the gaps in the story later. You'll still have to be arrested. Have a lovely evening, ladies. Bye. There's nothing there for you. You were right. I feel sorry for Rossbach. - But they're all loose! - Too bad for the insurance. They were robbed. Isn't that funny? Yippee ki-yay. Motherfucker... Thank you. Annett! Stop hiding. You're taking over. I'm out of here. SIX MONTHS LATER Look who's here! - Mom! - Oh, my God! Come here! You've grown so much! - I missed you. - Mom, I was here only yesterday. - What's that? - Why'? - Are you for real? - Yep. Think I gave them all to Kaiten? That's a bad deal. I told you I never wanted to see one again. Do you ever listen? I earned it. I have needs. - You're so annoying. - Your mom's annoying. Oh, my God! I'll drive. - Why did you even want them? - To go to Sweden. What? Sweden? Why Sweden? - I wanted to build a campground. - A campground? - Yes. - In Sweden? - Yes. - That's so corny. - Your mom's corny. - So corny. Your mom's corny. Subtitles: Georgina Avgerinou et al.

Ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard Miss Frances Langford singing: ""You Are My Lucky Star"" from the forthcoming musical production... ...Broadway Rhythm. And now the Apex Brush Company again brings to you that cracked columnist... ...of the New York World Tribune, Bert Keeler, the voice of Broadway. Giving you the inside dope on what's what among the who's who. - Take it, Bert. - Good evening, you little scandal lovers. This is Bert Keeler speaking, the voice of Broadway. Coming to you with all the late indoor-sport results. And am I hot tonight. Flash. New York, New York. The Park Avenue Bradley Masons are anticipating a blessed event. It's a boy at the William Tuckers. Flash. Two dozen safety pins were ordered this morning by the Howard Van Pelts. Washington, D.C. There's a rumor that Congress, to help balance the national budget... ...will put a tax on all divorces. Are you listening, Reno? Heh, heh. Imagine all those lawyers going back to work. It's good? Flush. Or flash: It's quintuplets at the Tenth Avenue Angelo Pasquales. This is their 16th blessed event. Hmm, the stork must be using the spare room. Crash. It's a 72-pound boy at the home of the Leslie, Park Avenue, Rockfords. Flash: The stork left by aeroplane at midnight... ...for the home of the Sidney O'Hares in Baltimore-Happy landing. Boy. Call Bert Keeler. Tell him to see me as soon as he finishes his broadcast. Yes, sir. - Hi, chief. How'd you like the broadcast? - Rotten. Can't you write or talk about anything else except who's gonna have a baby? Why, chief, don't you like my baby talk? No. Your column reads like a clinical report. Listen to this, ""The stork is flying high over the Conrad Barnums. A bundle of joy from heaven at the Bartons. A blessed event threatens the Campbells."" It's old stuff. But the public loves babies. So do I, but I'm running a newspaper, not a birth forecast. Don't you think it gives my column a homey feeling, sort of a domestic touch? That's not Broadway. Now get this, Keeler. I want the stuff you get looking over transoms and peeking through keyholes. You can't get stuff through keyholes. Sometimes the people aren't home. Then you find out where they went and why. Suppose I find them and they're doing nothing wrong? People are always doing something wrong for a good reporter. I see. You want the kind of stuff that'll get me a sock in the nose. That's right. And you won't be making good until people hate you. I want everybody in this town looking for your scalp. Mmm, nice journalistic future I have. Don't worry. The minute I hear people calling you a rat, I'll raise your salary. All right, I'll be so big a rat you can put a saddle on me. Give that stork a rest. Put your nose to the ground... ...and dig up some news that's hot, and remember: One more blessed event in your column and you're through. Okay, chief. The only births I'll mention from now on will be on Pullmans. Bert, who do you think is gonna have a baby? - Who? - My mother. - From now on nobody's gonna have babies. - You can't stop my mother... - ...from having a baby. - I can stop it from having it in my column. What I'm driving at is we gotta stop watching the stork and pay attention... - ...to keyholes and transoms. - Why? Because I'll lose my job. And if I lose my job I've got to let you go. - Why? - Why? Because when I'm out of work, I don't need an assistant. Oh. I gotta get the lowdown on something important. - Well, ain't babies important? - The boss don't think so. We gotta dig up some dirt. What banker was seen with what chorus girl. Does it have to be a banker or a chorus girl? No, but it's gotta be somebody important who's doing something he shouldn't do. Hey, looks like there's something hot going on down there. - Thanks. - You're welcome. It's Bob Gordon, the guy who's producing Broadway Rhythm. - He's talking to a dame. - Who is she? I think it's Lillian Brent. - Lillian Brent? - Yeah. Say, she's got more dough than you and I will ever have. I'd like to help you out. Investing money in a show is risky business. - I wouldn't advise it. - I like taking chances. - I'd get a kick out of it. - I can't let you do it, Lillian. - Don't you believe in your show? - I do. - It's the best thing I've ever written. - That's good enough for me. Look... ...who told you that I needed money? What's the difference? Well, I just didn't want you to think I'd take advantage of our friendship. You haven't. You had nothing to do with it. I like the idea of putting money into your show and I'm going to do it. But... ...we don't have to be too brutally businesslike about it, do we? It's a business proposition. - Won't there be anything personal in it? - Mm-hm. - What? - Your personal check. Oh, Bob. I know the show's gonna be a great success and I want it to be, for your sake. But, darling, please don't become so interested in it... ...that you'll forget all about me? How could I?  I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a feelin' you're having fun   I'll get a go-by when you are done   Foolin' with me   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a notion it's make-believe   I think you're laughing   Right up your sleeve   Foolin' with me   Life is worth living   While you are giving   Moments of paradise   You're such a standout   But how you hand out   That hocus-pocus From your eyes   I got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a feelin' it's all a frame   It's just the well-known old Army game   Foolin' with you   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a feelin' you're having fun   I'll get a go-by when you are done   Foolin' with me   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I got a notion it's make-believe   And you are laughing right up your sleeve   Foolin' with me   Life is worth livin' while you are givin'   Moments of paradise   You're such a standout   But how you hand out the   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a feelin' it's all a frame   It's just the well-known old Army game   -No foolin'   -No foolin'   -No foolin'   -No foolin'   -When I'm foolin' with you   When I'm foolin' with you   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a feelin' you're having fun   I'll get a go-by when you are done   Foolin' with me   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a notion it's make-believe   I think you're laughing   Right up your sleeve   Foolin' with me   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a feelin' it's all a frame   It's just that well-known old Army game   Foolin' with you   Life is worth living   While you are giving   Moments of paradise   You're such a standout   But how you hand out   That hocus-pocus from your eyes  - Snooper, do you know what this means? - What? Anytime a wealthy Park Avenue widow gets chummy with a Broadway guy... ...the public wants to know why. - Why, is that wrong? - Not at all. But one of them's got something the other one wants. It's the same in the Bronx. - See Mr. Newcombe. - Thank you. - Is this Robert Gordon's office of Albany? - What's that? I say, is this Robert Gordon of Albany's office? Albany office? No, no. New York office. Yes, I know. But what I mean is... ...is this Robert Gordon's office in New York of Albany? See if this is it. You wanna know if this is Albany's office of Robert Gordon's New Yor... Now you got me doing it. Don't go away. I'll unravel you in a minute. Hello? No, sorry, he isn't in. Now then, let's start from scratch. - Just who did you want to see? - Bob. Bob? You mean Mr. Gordon? Yes. - What's your name? - Irene Foster. - Of Albany. - Why, yes. How did you know? - I'm psychic. - Really? - You know, Bob's from Albany too. - Is that so? We haven't seen each other since he left high school. For heaven's sake. We were sort of... - You know what I mean. - Oh, you weren't. Mm-hm. See this? It's his school fraternity pin. - Hmm. - He gave it to me five years ago. Gee, I'm dying to see him again. Is he in? Not yet. Have you an appointment? Oh, no. I wanna surprise him. He may not remember you after five years. Oh, he'll remember me, all right, especially this. - What's that? - We used to do that in school. - You did that to each other? - Uh-huh. Why? Well, because we were both born in January. Oh, I get it, the goat sign. - A couple of goats. - That's right. Excuse me. I'm Bert Keeler of the World Tribune. - I'd like to see Bob Gordon. - Oh, Mr. Gordon isn't in right now. Well, maybe you can help me out. You ought to know something about this. Confidentially, who's banking Gordon's show? Mr. Gordon isn't in right now. It's, uh... It's Lillian Brent, isn't it? - Mr. Gordon isn't in right now. - Mr. Gordon isn't in right now. All right, I'll wait. That's the eyes and ears of Broadway, with his nose in everybody's business. Hey, pardon me. If you're asleep, you forgot to close your eyes. Oh, I'm not sleeping. I'm just practicing my... Rehearsing my specialty. What specialty? Well, I'm sort of an expert on snores. I've been trying to see Mr. Gordon for a month. What about? Snoring. I want to get into his show. Snoring? Precisely. Of all the human sound phenomena... ...perhaps the most inhuman... ...to other people are the snorers. Well, I agree with you. It is a very unpopular indoor sport. In discussing the human snore, or what we call in scientific terms... ...soft-palate calisthenics... ...I need scarcely point out that the basic snore... ...is the common or Pullman car form. Like this: Just an ordinary snore. Yeah, it would be silly to waste a good snore in a Pullman. Snores are produced by two movements of the breath... ...and so they may be classified under two general headings... ...varied inspirational forms and varied expirational forms. We'll take up the latter first. Go right ahead. It's very interesting. All of these expirational forms are dependent upon type one... ...which you've just heard, for their inspirational element. And so we have type 2-A... ...the labial or ""ah-poo"" variety. You know, my... My grandmother used to snore like that. And 2-8 is the frictional or non-lubricated form. A little oil would help that one. And 3-A is the sad or melancholy form. Which often merges into 3-B... ...the conversational or troubled-conscience variety. I'm sorry, but I don't think my readers would be interested in an organ recital. But you haven't heard the air-brake whistle snore... - Hello, Gordon. - Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Gordon. Good morning, Mr. Gordon. Call the costumers and have them send over the sketches for that ballet number. Get in touch with Basil. I'd like to start rehearsing as soon as possible. Oh, yes. Yes, Mr. Gordon. He just didn't recognize you. I know he didn't. Why didn't you give him this? I forgot to. Well, it... It's always best to write for an appointment. I guess you're right. Ask Mr. Gordon if he'll see me. I gotta get back to the office. Bert Keeler of the World Tribune wants to see you. Yes, sir. He said he saw you on the way in. Yeah? Well, ask him how I looked. No, wait. Tell him I want some news on the show. This is publicity. He wants some news on the show, Mr. Gordon. He said it's publicity. Yes, sir, I'll tell him. What did he say? He said when he wants publicity he'll hire a publicity man. Mm-hm. Well, he won't need one. This is one thing Lillian Brent won't have to pay for. Tell him to read my column.  Sing before breakfast   Help the birdies along   Before you have that buttered toast   Have a song   You've got to sing before breakfast   Green a tune and rejoice   Before you use that coffeepot   Use your   The whole world may seem funny   But it is good enough   If you run out of money, honey   Put it on the cuff   And sing before breakfast  - Oh, hello. - Hello. Oh, please go right ahead. We were just working up a little appetite for breakfast. I didn't mean to interrupt, I'm sorry. That's all right. Come on over and join us. Thanks. This is my sister, Sally Burke. - How do you do? - Hello. And my name is Theodore. But just call me Ted. - What's your name? - Irene Foster. That's a good name. For a girl. - Have you had breakfast? - Oh, yes. Well, sit down and have some more. I usually eat breakfast in the morning. Well, we usually eat breakfast at noon, it saves lunch. It's cheaper that way. - You just moved here today, didn't you? - Yes. - Where you from? - Albany. Albany? Hey, that's a swell town. We played there once. - Were we a panic in Albany. - I'll say. - What'd I do with those clippings? - Ted? Remind me to show you those clippings. Terrific. Oh, then you're in show business? Yeah. What line are you in? Well, I really came to New York to see Robert Gordon. - I thought he might give me a chance. - Did you see him? Yes, I saw him. But he didn't remember me. Was he, uh, supposed to? Well, he should. We went to school together. Oh, I get it. You're kind of that way over him, huh? Well, kind of. You're going back to see Mr. Gordon again, aren't you? - Never. - Oh, you've got to. Yeah, you got to. Look, you can't let a little thing like that upset you. - Coffee? - Thanks. - Well, I really don't feel much like eating. - Oh, trouble never upsets my appetite.  You got to sing before breakf--  - Never sing before breakfast. - I don't believe in that stuff. Look, you've spilt the salt. Don't you pick some up... - ...and throw it over your shoulder? - No, I pick it up and throw it over my eggs. But that's bad luck.  Don't be a superstitious dope   To walk beneath a ladder   Can never make you sadder   Things people fear to me bring hope   Thirteen's a lucky number   If you wake from slumber   And sing before breakfast   Help the birdies along   Before you have that buttered toast   Have a song   You got to sing before breakfast   Green a tune and rejoice   Before you use that coffeepot   Use your voice   The whole world may seem funny   But it is good enough   If you run out of money, honey   Put it on the cuff   And sing before breakfast   Never cry at a thing   Before you eat that shredded wheat   Sing, just sing   - And sing, sister, before breakfast   - Sing, sing, sister, before breakfast sing   - Sister, before breakfast sing, sister   - Before breakfast   Open your mouth and sing   You got to sing before breakfast   Green a tune and rejoice   Before you use that coffeepot   Use your voice   The whole world may seem funny   But it is good enough   If you run out of money, honey   Put it on the cuff   And sing before breakfast   Never cry at a thing   Before you eat that shredded wheat   Sing, just sing   And sing, and sing, and sing   And sing  Well, I'll see that he gets the message. Yes, sir. Miss Corbett, where did this come from? A girl left it. Said to give it to you. A girl? Mr. Gordon, are you from Albany? Yes, I am. Why? And did you use to do this to a girl you went to school with? Sure, I remember. - Irene Foster. - That's it. - Where is she? - She's gone. Gone? Where did she go? - I don't know. - Where's she stopping? - I don't know. - Didn't you get her address? - No. - That's a fine way to conduct an office. Find out where she lives. Go on, get busy, find her. And hurry it up. - Is Bob Gordon in? - Yes. Thank you. - Have you seen Bert Keeler's column? - No. Why? Well, listen to this: Flash: Dan Cupid shoots a Park Avenue arrow into the heart of Broadway. Lillian Brent and Bob Gordon are billing and cooing. He's cooing until the billing for his new show... ...is backed by cash in the bank."" How do you like that? Wait a minute. Get Bert Keeler on the phone and tell him I want to see him. Right away, Mr. Gordon. How dare Bert print such a thing in the paper. That guy's been getting away with murder lately by guessing lucky. Somebody told him I was putting money in the show. - Did you? - Don't look at me. - I didn't crack to anybody. - It won't happen again. - But the damage is done. - I'll say. Oh, Mr. Gordon, Mr. Keeler says if you wanna see him... ...you'll have to come to his office. Oh, he did, did he? All right, I'll do that. Don't go, I'll be right back. How do you like that? Ha! Gordon wants me to come up to his office. - He's a big guy in this town, isn't he? - So am I. The secret is to write about big shots, not mingle with them. I wonder if he'd be mad about that sock you took at him. Who cares? The more those guys burn, the bigger I become. Snoop, you know when a columnist is sure he's a success? - When? - When the people he writes about... ...get sore and wanna see him. Scully is right. Get them mad. Make them tremble when they pick up the paper. - And that makes you a success, huh? - That's right. And furthermore, I'm doing a lot of good. You may not realize it but I am. People aren't likely... - ...to go wrong for fear I'll print it. - Yeah? Yeah. You know, Snoop. I'm a reformer in a sense. What sense? Copy boy. Copy boy. Copy boy. Copy boy. Hello, Gordon. How is the show coming along? Glad to hear it. You know Snooper... - ...my assistant that digs up the dirt for me? - Not all of it. Keeler, I want a retraction of that item. You mean that, uh... That little boost I gave you in today's column? I mean this cheap attack you made against a friend of mine. Why, Bob, that's publicity. I usually get something for that kind of stuff. That's okay with me. All right, Keeler, put that in your column. Listen, when you hit him, you gotta hit me too. - Hey, Snoop. - Yeah? Remind me to ask for a raise tomorrow. - Give me a napkin, will you? - What's the matter with you? - Don't you know how to dunk a doughnut? - Sure, I just lost control, that's all. - Look, what do you think that hole is for? - Ventilation. No, you're thinking of the holes in cheese. It's for your thumb. - Now, look, you put your thumb here... - Yeah. ...your forefinger here and you do this. I gotta run down to the office. - If you hear any news give me a buzz. - You forgot your check. Yeah. Uh, excuse me, that was Bert Keeler sitting here, wasn't it? Yeah, why? - Is he a friend of yours? - Sure, Keeler and I are like that: This is me on the bottom. - He could do me a big favor, if he would. - Yeah? - Your order, please? - Coffee and doughnut. What about a favor Keeler could do you? Well, the girl my boss is looking for reads his column. - Who's your boss? - Robert Gordon. Do you know him? - Oh, yes, we've met. - Good. - And who's the girl? - Irene Foster and I've got to locate her. Listen, Keeler's a great guy, he'll help you. And besides, he does anything I say. Then will you please tell him to put in his column... ...that Robert Gordon would like to locate Irene Foster? - Listen. Do you wanna be a regular guy? - Give me a match. What is it? Put in your column that Bob Gordon is anxious to get in touch with Irene Foster. - Who's Irene Foster? - A girl. Yeah, I imagine that. Now what? You see, she's from Albany. That's Bob Gordon's hometown. She checked out of high school and came to see Gordon... ...but he didn't recognize her. So she ankles out of his office feeling bad. High-hatting his old friends, eh? - No, he's sorry now. - Where did you get all this? - I got a connection in the office. - Yeah? Look, will you put it in your column and mark it down as a favor to me? The pleasure is all mine. - Gee, you're a regular guy at that, Bert. - Thanks. And everybody in town thinks you're a heel, but I don't anymore. Well, thanks, Snoop. I... Come in. Mr. Keeler? - Yeah. - You remember me? Oh, yeah, you're the guy that goes around snoring at people. Snoop. Snoop. I want you to meet Mr., uh... Mr... - What's his first name? - I don't know. - He wants to get into Gordon's show. - Yeah? What do you do? I snore. Oh, you're part of the audience. No, I... You see, I'm really a research professor of sound phenomena. Hey, why don't you give him a sample of whatever you're talking about? Well, certainly. Well, for instance, there's... ...the light and thin or blond type of snore: Or the larger and fuller or brunette variety: And there's the ascending diapason: And the descending diapason: And of course the double diapason: - That's good. - Yeah. But, uh... The evident sign of the experienced and accomplished snorer... ...is type seven, the interrupted inspiration... ...or static lag variety: You know, I've been all through this. Which merges and extends itself ultimately... ...and I think I may say, without fear of successful contradiction... ...almost inevitably into type eight... ...which might be called the last word in snoring. This is the auto-resuscitation, or self-awakening variety: Uh, shall I go on? No, you stay and I'll go on. I'll go with you. Hey, why don't you come too? 'The Main Stem' by Bert Keeler. ""Gardenias to Irene Foster for walking out on Bob Gordon. Cabbages to him for not recognizing the Albany beauty. Some guys are like that. They prefer widows, especially if they are rich."" How do you suppose he ever got a hold of that? What do you care, as long as your name's spelt right? You can't keep any secrets from Keeler. - Oh, I think that's awful. - What do you mean awful? Yeah. Say, onions from that guy... ...are better than chrysanthebubs from anybody else. Better than what? Chrysanthemums. - Why don't you go back and see Gordon? - I will not. You came here to see him, didn't you? Yes, but I still have a little pride left. So has Gandhi but he's getting awful thin. You know, if you could only do something besides dance. Gordon can buy hoofers a dime a dozen, but if you could do, say, a bubble dance... ...or a dance on a tightrope. I remember a fellow once that had an act. He used to dance and while he was dancing he'd spin a rope with one hand... ...and play a saxophone with the other. And in the meanwhile... Oh, hello, what's your name? My name is Eva Lovelace. Of course I haven't done very much, just a little stock in Boston. Oh, that isn't really my name. I just use that for the theater. But it does have a sort of melodious sound, don't you think? Eva Lovelace. Oh, I can see my name in lights now. Oh, I do so wanna be a great actress. A really, truly great actress. Tell me, did you know Ellen Terry and Sarah Bernhardt? How I should love to be like Sarah Bernhardt... ...and have my name in the hall of fame. That's Katharine Hepburn in Morning Glory. Who do you think it is, Shirley Temple? Tell him that he'll never know what he's done for me. Not really. Our lives are like two rivers now, running into one sea. And that to be a great actress, one must experience every emotion in life. Oh, I know, don't ask me. I just do know that I love him. Really, I do. That's very good. Now, with this fellow with the rope and the saxophone. In the meanwhile, the girl... Oh, you. And another thing, the circulation of the paper is growing and what's doing it? - Your column. - Right. You know, Snoop. I'm gonna be syndicated. Spread all over the country. Hey, listen, if you hit him you gotta hit me too. Keeler, I'm warning you. One more crack like that in your column and I won't be so easy with you. - Hey, Snoop. - Yeah? I can take it, can't I?  I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a feelin' you're having fun   I'll get a go-by when you are done   Foolin' with me   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a notion it's make-believe   I think you're laughing   Right up your sleeve   Foolin' with me   Life is worth living   While you are giving   Moments of paradise   You're such a standout   But how you hand out   That hocus-pocus from your eyes   I've got a feelin' you're foolin'   I've got a feelin' it's all a frame   It's just the well-known old Army game   Foolin' with me  Girls, leave your name and address with Miss Corbett. Those we select will be notified later. All right, line up down front here. Come on, now. All right, can you sing or dance? I sing but I can dance in a pinch. This is not a pinch, this is a show. I'll take your name and we'll call you in a pinch. All right, next. - Well, how tall are you? - Oh, about up to here. Okay, see Miss Corbett. But I've had no experience. You won't need any. Name, please. My name is Irene Foster. I'm 5'5"" in my stocking feet... ...and I've had one very unpleasant experience. - What are you...? - Shall I see Miss Corbett? No. You better come over here and see me. Thanks. Hmm. Looks like that's all for today, girls. - Well... - Well? Well. - Well... - You just said that. Yeah, I know, but... You're all grown up now. I mean, you look older. Well, I am older. That usually happens to a girl between the ages of 16 and 22. Yeah, now that I look at you, you haven't changed so much. I recognized you instantly. Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that. My office is the last place in the world that I'd expect to run into you. You knew I'd get there someday. We used to talk about it. You were going to be the great producer and I'd be a great star. What funny, goofy dreams kids have. That is a great gag, your standing in line with those girls. That wasn't any gag. I wanted a job. Say, did you ever run into my friend, Henry Schultz? What's he doing now? Oh, he's running a delicatessen store. Bob, won't you give me a chance? You didn't come to New York to become that great actress you talked about? - That was one of the reasons. - What was the other? - I... I've forgotten. - Well, I'll bet it was a lot more important. Remember that summer in the Adirondacks when we lived next door to each other? I remember every day and... And every night of that summer. Up to five minutes ago, I'd forgotten all about it. Now I can't remember anything else. Bob, you came to New York and you made good. Now, I've come to New York and I wanna make good. I want everything we ever planned and dreamed about to come true. So do I, Irene, but New York and Broadway, they're not what we thought they were. They're hard and cold. A lovely creature like you wouldn't have a chance here. - Oh, Bob, you're wanted in the office. - Later. I'm busy now. It's important. - Okay. Don't run away. I'll drive you home. - All right. - Basil. - Yes. Who is it? - Lillian Brent. - Listen, tell her I'll see her later. She's been waiting all afternoon. - She has, huh? - And she's plenty burned up. - Well, what'll I tell her? - Never mind. I'll see her. - Sorry to keep you waiting so long. - You should be. - Well, I was detained. - So I understand. In an empty theater with a chorus girl. She isn't a chorus girl. She's an old friend from my hometown. Don't you think I'm more important than anyone else? Yeah, sure I do, Lillian. You ought to know that.  In my imagination   I live the things I like to do   In my imagination   Make believe it's really true   In my imagination   I paint a scene of ecstasy   In my imagination   My hero sings these words   To me   You are my lucky star   I saw you   From afar   Two lovely eyes at me   They were gleaming   Beaming   I was starstruck   You're all   My lucky charms   I'm lucky   In your arms   You've opened heaven's portal   Here on Earth for this poor mortal   You are my lucky star   I saw you from afar   Two lovely eyes at me   They were gleaming   Beaming   I was starstruck   You're all my lucky charms   I'm lucky in your arms   You've opened heaven's portal   Here on Earth for this poor mortal   You are   My lucky star  Miss Foster. - Miss Foster. - Oh. - Oh, hello. - Boy, I wish I could concentrate like that. - Is Mr. Gordon still busy? - Oh, yes, he is. He sent me to tell you that he's busy... ...and he won't be able to take you home. Oh. - He's terribly sorry and so am I. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. And another thing, if I'm to be in your new show... ...I demand all the attentions a leading lady deserves. - Leading lady? - Yes. You haven't one, have you? - No, not yet. - Well, darling, you have now. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You know as well as I do that this part needs a name. If I can only get a star, the show's bound to click. And if you don't? What then? Well, I'll postpone production. Why take a chance? Listen. If I'm willing to take a chance, you should be. After all, darling. I am putting up the money. Mm-hm. - Is that the way you feel about it? - Exactly. All right. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll gamble with you. If I don't get a star for this show in two weeks, I'll give you the part. Do you really mean it? - Positively. - Oh, Bob. Did you ring? Yes. Book passage for me on the first plane leaving New York for Los Angeles. - Yes, sir. - But, Bob, why? I'm going to Hollywood. I'm gonna find a star for this show if I have to steal Garbo. - There's a plane leaving for the coast at 9. - And I'll be on it. - Anything else? - No, that'll be all. Lillian, I've got an awful lot to do. May I take you somewhere? Yes. You can take me home. - Oh, Miss Corbett. - Yes, sir. Don't tell anyone that I'm leaving. - I want that kept quiet. - Yes, Mr. Gordon. - Good night. - Good night. Hello. - I ought to have you arrested. - For what? - For snooping. - I didn't hear anything, honest, I didn't. Except why Bob was talking to Lillian... If you tell Bert Keeler what you heard, I'll choke the socks off you. - I never tell Bert Keeler anything. - Promise me. Well, I will if you'll have dinner with me tonight. I'll do it just for meanness. Is this your idea of a dinner? We'll have more doughnuts and then I'll take you to a restaurant. Oh, you're too good to me. Hello, Snoop. Hi, Bert. - Hello. - Hello. - Well, any news? - No. - Oh, secrets, huh? - Honest, it's nothing you ought to know. Just the kind of stuff I print. What is it? Why don't you shut up? Well, I ain't said nothing. Yet. I guess you're looking for another punch in the nose. Yeah? Gordon won't ever do that again. - Not if he's in California. - No. Oh, so that's it. Gordon's going West, huh? What did you promise me, Snoop? Yes, Snoop. what did you promise the lady? I promised Kitty I wouldn't tell you that Gordon had a fight with Lillian Brent. - Snoop. - What about? It's nothing, it's just that he can't get a leading lady for his show. Mmm. You ought to have a zipper on your mouth. I don't know how to play one. So Gordon can't get a leading lady? Yeah. If he can't get one, he's gonna let Lillian Brent play the part. Well, why doesn't he get that French star? - What French star? - That... Oh, what's her name again? La Belle Arlette, that's it. - La Belle Arlette? - Yes, Mademoiselle La Belle Arlette... ...from the Comdie Franaise in Paris. Never heard of her. Oh, my dear child, don't say that. Everybody's heard of Arlette. Haven't they, Snoop? Oh, yeah, sure, certainly. - What's she like? - Tall, beautiful, blond. Maybe Mr. Gordon'd be interested. I have to be going. Oh, thanks for the banquet, Snoop. Anytime at all, Kitty. Don't forget to tell Gordon about Arlette. Hey, Bert, who's Mademoiselle Arlette? Just a cigar. Well, I can't get the angle of you trying to kid her. It isn't her. It's Gordon I want to rib. She'll go back and tell Gordon all about Arlette. - Then I'll build her up in my column. - But there is no Mademoiselle Arlette. Nobody knows it but you and me. Now I'm sorry you know it. Not since the arrival of the Statue of Liberty has France sent to this country... ...such a glamorous, beautiful and talented personality... ...as Mademoiselle La Belle Arlette. In this correspondent's opinion... ...it won't belong before Mademoiselle La Belle Arlette's beauty, talent... ...charm and, uh... ...mildness will make her the talk of the town. Flash. - Hello. Glad to see you back. - Thanks. Anything new? - Plenty. Hello. - Hi, Bob. Have a good trip? Terrible. Come on inside. Miss Corbett, will you come in, please? - Well, what happened in Hollywood? - Nothing. Those movie stars are guarded like a Turkish harem. That makes things tough. What are you gonna do? That's what I'd like to know. Everybody's in pictures. It's impossible to cast a show anymore. Why, haven't you heard about Mademoiselle Arlette? - Who? - Here, look. - Haven't you read about her? - No. Who is she? I don't know, but Keeler's been giving her boost in his column. Why, every manager in town's after her. Arlette? - Where's she from? - Paris. - What's she look like? - I don't know. - You haven't seen her? - No. - Where's she stopping? - I don't know. Why? What have you been doing while I was away? Nobody knows where she is. It's a mystery. We've gotta get in touch with her. Check every hotel in town. Yes, sir. All right, mademoiselle. Relax. Hey, when can I get out of this harness? My feet hurt. You look about as effeminate as Wallace Beery. Now, look, Snoop, all you have to do is sit here all day and answer the phone. - Now, can you talk like a dame? - I can try. Let's hear it. Buy me a Rolls-Royce, Daddy. You're thinking like one anyway, but you gotta get your voice higher, higher, way up. Look, Snoop, if there's any soprano in you, this is the time to bring it out. - Now, try it again. - Buy me... Ahem. Buy me a Rolls-Royce...! I can't. Then we're stuck. Say, maybe you better be a man. What do you mean maybe? - As Arlette's secretary. - I'll feel more natural. All right. What are you going to say? - Remember, you're a French secretary. - Yeah. What are you gonna say when Gordon asks for Mademoiselle Arlette? - What are you going to say? - Well, I'll say, ""Bonjour, oui, oui. Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy. She is very, very busy with the rehearsal."" How's that? Very good. The other 50 million Frenchmen must be wrong. Well, does the dame have to come from Paris? Certainly, the publicity is out. Gee, I wish you could speak French. I speak French. Si, Si, seor. That's Spanish. Imagine that. I speak Spanish too. Hello? Hotel Carlton? Have you a Mademoiselle Arlette registered there? Oh, may I speak to her? Wait. Wait a minute. Now, hold it. - Now, listen, you talk just like a secretary. - Bonjour. This is Robert Gordon's office. May I speak to Mademoiselle Arlette? Oui, oui. Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy. She is very, very busy rehearsing. - Hello. - Oh, Mr. Gordon... ...Arlette's on the wire. She's singing. It's Arlette. Shh. It's a cinch, it's not Crosby. Hello? Hello, this is Robert Gordon speaking. May I speak to Mademoiselle Arlette? Hey, it's Gordon. I am sorry. Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy. She is very, very busy rehearsing. - Oh, Mr. Gordon. - Miss Corbett. I want you to send a telegram to Arlette. Arrange for an interview. Tell her that I must see her. Yes. sir. And, Mr. Gordon, Miss Foster's here. Oh. Well, yeah, all right. Have her come in. All right, Miss Foster. You can come in now. - Hello, Irene. - Hello, Bob. Gee, I'm glad you dropped in. I've been wondering if you were still in town. Oh, I want you to meet two friends of mine. - Ted and Sally Burke. - How do you do? The Burkes? Say, I remember you. I caught your act in Detroit. You used to work with a trained duck, didn't you? - That's right. - You still got that act together? Everything but the duck. You know, it's been a kind of a tough winter. - You mean you ate the act? - Last Christmas. - Oh, what are you doing now? - Nothing since the duck died. Mr. Gordon, this is Irene's appointment. We just came with her. She wants to go in your show. She's got talent, plenty of it. All she needs is a chance. And you can give it to her. - That's quite a compliment, Irene. - Really, Mr. Gordon, Irene is clever. We know. Don't we, Ted? - Sure do. - Well, I'd like to think it over, Irene. - Casting a show is a very important matter. - That's right. Say, how'd you like to go in my new show, both of you? Take it easy, Mr. Gordon. I got a weak heart. Really, we didn't come here to talk about ourselves. - It's about Irene. - Oh, that's all right, Sally. - But you don't understand... - Wait. I'm offering you a job. - Don't you want it? - We do. - Well, then, it's settled. - Oh, I think it's wonderful, Sally. But what about you? Mr. Gordon, what about Irene? I'll talk with Irene alone. - Come back, Ted. We'll talk about money. - You won't find us hard to deal with. That's fine. I'm glad you dropped in. See you at the house, Irene. - Goodbye, Sally. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Gordon. - Goodbye, Ted. Well, how do you feel now? I feel terrible. Terrible about what? We go in to get her a job and we come out with it. I told you we didn't need that duck. Well, I don't know what to say, Irene. I want you to... Well, I want you to understand how I feel about all this. I want you to go back to Albany. - But why, Bob? I've just come from there. - That's what you gotta understand. I know how it is. You worked hard at what you were doing... ...saved your money and deprived yourself of a lot of things you should've had. So you could come to New York and get a chance at what you wanted. - I did that. - I know you did. But it isn't worth it. What you get isn't what you came after. I know that too. Look, there's nothing for you here in New York. I could give you a bit in my show and maybe you'd get another and another... - That's all I want. That's enough for me. - Yeah, but not for me. If you were anyone else, okay. But you're not. I know what'd happen to you here in New York. I know how cheap and selfish this town is. The easiest thing for me to do... ...is to give you the chance and put you away and forget about it. But I can't. So I'm taking the hard way. Won't you go back to Albany? - Without even one try of what I want? - Without even one try. - Bob, do you honestly think it's best? - I know it is. All right, I'll go home. Oh, say, by the way... ...whatever happened to the fellow who gave you this? I don't know. I haven't seen him for years. He's probably forgotten all about me. Well, I imagine he ran off and died somewhere, don't you? I imagine so. Well, uh... ...will you wear it for me? Uh, I think you'd better go home and pack. I'll pick you up in an hour and drive you to the station. Well, did you do yourself any good? - I'm going back home. - Why? Well, he thinks it's best for me. Oh, that's too bad. But that's the way it goes in this racket. - Are you sure you're not just stage-struck? - Of course not. Oh, I know I could do something if I only had the chance. You know. I've heard that a million times but... Well, for some reason or other, I believe you. You're the only one that does. - Yes, sir? - Why don't you answer when I ring? - Come in here. - Coming. Oh. Stick around a few minutes, honey. I wanna talk to you. Yes, sir. Miss Corbett, get me a ticket and a compartment... ...on the afternoon train for Albany. It's for Miss Foster. Oh. - She's an awful nice kid, isn't she? - Of course she is. Mr. Gordon, why are you sending her back? You don't think I want her to stay around this place, do you? I think she'd like to. Listen, will you stop worrying about my private affairs? Yes, sir. Have you been able to get in touch with Arlette? I've been ringing her all morning. All her secretary can say is: ""Mademoiselle, she is busy rehearsing. Mademoiselle, she is having her face lifted."" She's the busiest dame I ever saw. All right, ring her again. - I've gotta get in touch with her. - Yes, sir. Hello. Hello. I'd like to speak to Mademoiselle Arlette if she's not baking a cake. Bonjour. Oui, our. Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy. She is very, very busy rehearsing. Doesn't that dame do anything but rehearse? I wanna talk to her. It's urgent. This is Robert Gordon's secretary. Hi, Kitty. Say that again, you. Hello! - Good luck with the show, Bob. - Thanks, Irene, I need it. - I wish I were going back to Albany too. - Oh, Albany is no place for you. An amateur like me, maybe, but not you. You've arrived in New York. - That's where you belong. - I know. I'd like to see the old place again. What could possibly interest you in Albany? Well, you're going to be there. Well, it's nice to know I'd interest you in Albany anyway. Do you know my address, in case you come up for a visit... - ...or if you wanna write or something? - 560 Washington Avenue. - Hmm! Quite a memory. - I spent all last night trying to remember it. Board! - Goodbye, Irene. - Goodbye, Bob. Board! - You know something? - What? I wish this train weren't pulling out. Oh, I bet you tell that to all the girls. - Mail this letter when you arrive in Albany. - Yes, ma'am. - You won't forget? - No, ma'am, I won't. Thank you. Come on. Hurry. I've got a taxi waiting. It's time for promenading And I'll be with you soon All the best folks are parading On a Sunday afternoon We'll rent a horse and carriage And I'll be proud of you We'll talk about a marriage On the busy avenue And then we'll ride To the countryside I'll burst with pride In your Sunday gown You're the talk of the town Now, you can have the twilight And you can have the moon Give me those happy moments On a Sunday afternoon Now, you can have the twilight And you can have the moon Give me those happy moments On a Sunday afternoon Well, Bob, what do you think of it? Well, the routine's okay. What I'm worried about is finding a star for this show. - I'd like to talk to you. - Hi, Lilly. I just found a very cute little poem about us in Keeler's column. I'd like to read it to you. Lilly was an amateur Who had a lot of dough Bob was just another guy Who longed to do a show Now Lil has the role she wants And Bobby has his million The woman pays, the woman plays And Bob is stuck with Lillian Can't you stop Keeler from printing such stuff in his column? If I continue writing this column, I'll need a bodyguard. - You're not yellow? - No. But can't you put me on ""Advice to the Lovelorn"" ...or ""How to Bake a Cake""? Listen, your column's going strong. You're a success. People hate the ground you walk on. Everybody in town wants to see you hit by a taxi. Think of it. Boy, am I hot. Everybody hates me. - Ain't that swell, Snoop? - Yeah. Five people phoned me today and called you a rat. Isn't that sweet? That entitles me to that raise, doesn't it? - You get your raise. - Fine. I'll buy some accident insurance. Keep up the good work, my boy. I may give you a bonus. Thanks. Looks like I'll die a rich man. If I live long enough. Well, Snoop, here's another boost for my friend Gordon. This is the crowning point of our career. Say, we've been crowned twice already. That's applause to a good newspaperman. Get this. 'Bob Gordon's efforts to get Mademoiselle Arlette for his new play have failed. People are asking why. Maybe she read his play. It's our guess that he will have to sign up Lillian ""No Talent"" Brent as his lucky star. This move should make Gordon Broadway's public enemy number one."" - How do you like that? Right on the nose. - Yeah, but whose nose? Oh, you're not a bit optimistic. That man is here again. Hello, we were expecting you. What's on your mind, Gordon? Unh! Hey, listen... - Hey, Snoop. - What? Get off. This is as far as we go. What's the matter, hedging? No, I'm not. But this show means everything to me. Oh, come on. Be regular. Give me a few more days. Listen, you promised me the lead... ...if you weren't able to find anybody in two weeks. Your time is up. - Be reasonable, Lillian. - No. We made a bargain and I expect you to live up to it. All right. There's your contract. Sign here. I suppose you know that if the show flops, I'm ruined and you're out 60,000 bucks. Yes, my sweet. I know all about that. Now you sign, right under mine. - Mr. Gordon. - Yeah? Mademoiselle Arlette, she wishes to see you. - Arlette? You mean she's here now? - Yes, sir. Sign this contract and stop stalling. Not if there's a chance of getting her for the part. - All right, you have her come in now. - Yes, sir. - Oh! - Oh! Don't you get jittery. - What'd he say? - Don't you begin getting nervous. I've lost 8 pounds since we started this thing. - Who's nervous? - We'll both get the electric chair for this. What's worse, I'm liable to lose my job. Forget about that. I'm all right. You'll see the best Frenchwoman... ...any high school dramatic society ever turned out. If this were only a high school society. Do you know your name? - Irene Foster. - Oh, no, you're Mademoiselle Arlette... ...and you're from Paris and you've been very busy rehearsing. Mr. Gordon, you sent for me, yes? Yeah, well, it sounds a little Swedish but I guess you'll get by, I hope. Mr. Gordon, you sent for me, yes? Yes, of course, I did, mademoiselle, some time ago... ...but, well, I'd given up hope of ever seeing you. You see, I have been very, very busy rehearsing. Yeah. Pardon me. May I present Miss Lillian Brent? And why not? I am always happy to meet people. - How do you do? - Delighted. If you don't mind, Bob, I'll run along. Would you kindly ask Mr. Gordon to call me tonight if he's not too busy? - I'll make a note of that. - Thanks. - Snoop. - Yeah? Get a load of this. ""Bob Gordon signs Mademoiselle Arlette for new show Broadway Rhythm. The beautiful and talented French actress, Arlette... ...has signed a contract to star in Bob Gordon's Broadway Rhythm production. The young producer is to be complimented for having secured the services of Arlette. Rehearsals start today."" What do you think of that? Hey, that's a beautiful dame. But how can Gordon sign Arlette when there is no Arlette? That's what I'd like to know. - Snoop. - What? Have you spoken to anyone since the last time I was here? Yeah, a lot of people. What did you say? ""Mademoiselle Arlette, she is busy... "" No, no, no, Snoop. Did you say anything else? - Yeah. - What? - ""She is very, very busy."" - No, no. Look. Look, Snoop, I want you to think. Look, I don't want you to strain yourself. I just want you to think. About what? Is there anyone in particular you remember speaking to while I was away? - Yeah. - Who? Kitty Corbett, Bob Gordon's secretary. What did you say? ""Mademoiselle Arlette, she... "" Besides that? I said, ""Hi, Kitty."" - What? - But I hung right up. - You know me, trigger judgment. - Oh, you hung up? Whenever I'm through with the phone, I hang up the receiver. That's smart. Have you seen her since? - Yeah, she was here. - Here? What did she say? I don't know. I was asleep. Asleep? - She was here and you were asleep? - Yeah, I dozed off. She left this. - Well, of all the dumb guys... - Don't worry about Corbett. She won't tip the gag off. She said so. Just the same, I gotta find out who this dame is that Gordon's got signed up. What do you want me to do? Go down to the ocean and pull a wave over your head. Well, that's not so good, but I guess it'll have to do. Take five minutes' rest. Five minutes' rest. Who is it? - Mademoiselle Arlette? - Oui, monsieur. Mr. Gordon's ready to see your number. Trs bien, I come, toute de suite. All right. Hey, keep your fingers crossed. Oh, my. Ah, ban/our, Monsieur Gordon, you ready for me, yes? - Yes, mademoiselle. All ready. - Merci beaucoup. You know Mademoiselle Arlette's music, yes? Why, no, mademoiselle, I don't. Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk. Too bad. Then you play for me something like... How you say, like...? Like: - Oh, no, no, no, monsieur, no. - No? Something with the... Ah! With rhythm, n'est-ce pas? - Yes? - You mean hot. Yes. Oh, no, no, no. No. Ah! Very good. No, no, no. No. That is all wrong. Don't play anything. Oh, monsieur, I am so sorry. You see, he does not understand. Well, mademoiselle, may I get you another pianist? Oh, no, no, no. I tell you, I do for you like I did in Paris without any music. It is much better that way. Ah! You like this one, no? You got him, sister. You got him. This Arlette you've been spreading all over your column... ...do you know who she is? Yeah. She's a 5-cent cigar and a very bad smoke. Maybe so. But there is a Mademoiselle Arlette living in Paris... ...and she threatens suit. Read that cable. What are you gonna do about that? Don't worry, chief. I'm killing Arlette tonight. - Killing her? - Everything will be taken care of. There won't be any bloodshed, just a nice quiet assassination. And don't send orchids. Oh, no, no, no, Monsieur Gordon, I never, never go out in public. Tonight you've got to make an exception. I've invited the press and the cast. The whole party is for you. Why, the publicity alone will put the show over. Oh, come on, please say you'll go. Trs bien, if you insist. Ha, ha, swell. Hello? It's for you, mademoiselle. Merci. - Hello? Oui? -This is Bert Keeler of the World Tribune. I wanna see you at my office right away. If you're as smart as I think you are, you'll grab a taxi and hurry over. I come at once. Anything wrong? - No, no, no, nothing of importance. - Oh, whatever it is, I'd like to help you. Monsieur Gordon, you will excuse me, please. I must go. Can't I go with you? Oh, no, man chri, this is one time, Arlette, she must be alone. All right. Au revoir, until tonight. Monsieur Keeler, you sent for me, no? I'm Keeler and I sent for you, yes. Oh, I'm so sorry. You see, I have been very, very busy... - ...rehearsing. - Rehearsing. If you're a French, I'm a Chinaman. - That is possible. - Sit down. You know, I'm very happy to meet you. - Oh, monsieur. - You can call me mister. What made you think you could get away with a gag like this? Gag? Well, what is it, gag? Now listen, sister, if you wanna play games with me, I'll send out for some Parcheesi. I don't like cheese. - Well? - Well? All right, I'll handle it another way. Get Bob Gordon on the phone. Don't do that, please. Okay, skip it. Now, talk fast. I wanted to get into Bob's show and this was the only way to do it. - Why? - He wouldn't give me a chance... ...under my right name. But as Arlette, he thinks I'm terrific. He may be right and that's what I'm afraid of. Well, the party's over. I'm sorry I have to ruin a perfectly good racket. - Why? - Why? I build up a phony Arlette as a gag. You step in, Gordon cashes in on the publicity... ...and I'm the biggest chump on Broadway. - And everybody lived happily ever after. - But not on me. Now, listen, I made Arlette and I can break her. I got a paper behind me that'll print anything I write. Here's my column for tomorrow. Get this. ""Arlette refuses Gordon's ridiculous offer and sails for France today."" And everybody lived happily ever after. Without Arlette. You'd deliberately ruin Bob Gordon's show... ...just to get even for a couple of harmless blows on the jaw? Harmless? My getting into this show means a lot to me but it means much more to Bob. And I'm going to protect him. I don't care what you write about me in that column of yours. Get this straight. You can't stop Arlette from opening in that show tomorrow night. - Oh, excuse me. - Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you don't think I can do it, maybe the real Arlette can stop you. The real Arlette? There isn't any real Arlette. That's what I thought. Here's a cablegram we got from Paris. ""Unless you discontinue publicity... ...in your column and expose person masquerading as Arlette... ...my attorneys will bring suit against you and Gordon. Mademoiselle Arlette."" What do you think of that? Gordon's giving her a banquet. If she doesn't show as Arlette, we're in for another sock in the nose. I can't help that. I'm sorry, kid, I had to do this. Just a minute. You know, you're not in such a healthy spot yourself. Whatever Bob and I have done was based on your phony information. Now, you listen to me. - I can't understand why she isn't here. - I can't understand... - ...why she didn't come with you. - She'd rather come alone. - Go phone the hotel. See if she's left yet. - Right-o. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Keeler. - Good evening. This way, please. - Good evening, Mr. Gordon. - Hello. Irene. Oh, hello, Bob. What on earth are you doing back in New York? I didn't go home. I've been here all the time. Why didn't you let me know? I really didn't think you were interested. Pardon me, Bob, but Miss Foster is my guest for this evening. Come, Irene. Sorry, Bob. I'm terribly nervous, Mr. Keeler. Yeah? How do you think I feel? You know, this wasn't my idea. Bob, get a load of this in Keeler's column. - Another one of Keeler's ribs. - At your expense. - What? - I've checked everywhere. I can't locate her. - Call her hotel. She's there. - I've called twice. She's not there. They said she checked out late this afternoon. Don't you think we ought to tell him? Say, how would you like a sock in the nose? Now, go ahead. You've just got time to make it.

Stop press, flash a new lead mainstem column: ""What Bob Gordon will lead which Irene Foster down the bridal path... ...after premiere of Broadway Rhythm? What unidentified body, named Bert Keeler... ...was chosen as best man by popular acclaim? Question mark, exclamation point."" That sounds to me like the 2-A, the ah-poo variety. No, no, I think that's 7-3, the super-static lag. Oh, Mr. Keeler, you're both wrong. That was 5-A, the wah-wah...  I saw you from afar   You are my Shearer, Crawford, Hepburn   Harlow and my Garbo   You are my lucky star   You are my lucky star  Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, - How's Florrie? - She's okay, Joe. - Take her to the hospital? - We didn't have time. - I want to see her. - Your public's calling, get back out there. Thanks, folks. It's been five years now since you've said hello to me and Florrie... ...but this time she asks to be excused. Joe, it's a boy. Go on. Well, it looks like I've got a son. Born in the Palace Theater. Here's a toast to vaudeville, the greatest entertainment in the world. It made me what I am today, a papa. And it's pretty nice, I tell you. Having that little home down there on Long Island... ...where you can take the wife and kiddies. Where you can lay off all summer long... ...in the country instead of a crowded boarding house in the roaring '40s... ...where there's nothing but streets to play in, like I had when I was a kid. What other business is like that, I ask you? There ain't none. Vaudeville, boy, you're something. Listen, you mugs, quiet. With so many of the best in one bunch, I'm tempted to warn you. There's a shadow coming up, may change things a whole lot. It's getting taller, that shadow, and wider, very fast. The motion picture. Shadow is right, making faces. Flash in the pan. Motion pictures change things? Not until the Hudson catches fire. - Yeah. He's right. - Okay, okay, boys, I hope you're right. Here's to 40 weeks, may it last forever. I tell you, Joe, there's no vaudeville anymore. Now, take the Palace Theater... ...go there any day in the week, even Monday, what do you see? A lot of people buying tickets for a talking picture. I don't know what to make of it. Something's gotta be done. Every vaudeville performer in Seaport is broke, and owes everybody in town. I never thought that pictures would take the place of vaudeville. - Maybe if you and Mom had a new act. - New act, new act? You talk like your brother. - Where is Mickey? - He's in town at the music publisher's. He wrote a song last night. He'll write another tonight, like last night and the night before. Kids have to go through their song writing age, I remember when you did. And I wrote some pretty good ones too. And what did it get me, nothing. Mickey is wasting his time. He'd better learn a trade and forget about show business... ...or he'll wind up like me. - There must be some theaters left, Dad. - A lot of empty ones. But, darling, with a good bill you could open them. There's a lot of good acts here that would be tickled to death to have the opportunity. Say, that's an idea. A road show with a lot of old-timers. So a guy's got to do it himself, eh? Okay. I'm going over to Brice's and see what he thinks. And that 10-percenter said that vaudeville was dead. Not with a lot of troupers like us around here. - Will you okay this lyric? - Wait a minute, I want to hear this song. Good morning, good morning We've danced the whole night through Good morning, good morning to you Good morning, good morning It's great to stay up late Good morning, good morning to you When the band began to play The stars were shining bright Now the milkman's on his way It's too late to say good night So good morning, good morning Sunbeams will soon smile through Good morning, my darling, to you Here we are together A couple of stayer-uppers Our day is done at breakfast time And starts in with our suppers Here we are together But the best of friends must party So let me sing this parting song From the bottom of my hearty - Good morning - It's a lovely morning - Good morning - What a wonderful day - We've danced the whole night through - Danced the whole night through - Good morning, good morning to you - Good morning, good morning to you - How do you do, do, do? - I said good morning - See, the sun is shining - A good morning Hear the birdies sing - It's great to stay up late - It's great to stay up late - Good morning, good morning to you - Good morning, good morning to you When the band began to play The stars were shining bright Now the milkman's on his way It's too late to say good night Good morning, good morning Sunbeams will soon smile through Good morning, good morning Sell it, Ma, sell it. Good morning, my darling, to you - How was it? - Where did you swipe that? Oh, quit your kidding. Words and music by Michael Z. Moran. Why, it'll sweep the country. Won't it? - Nothing very new there, Mickey. - Oh, what good is new? It's the same old rose you see every year. But it's just a little fresher, but it's the same thing, isn't it? - How many have you brought me, Mickey? - I brought you five that you didn't publish. But I ain't mad, I'm gonna give you another chance, see? You can't be wrong all the time, nobody is. - How much do you want for it? - The usual, 1000. I'll give you 100. - A hundred. - A hundred. - Honest? - Oh, that's wonderful. Mickey, he's gonna publish it. He is. Oh, he's fainted. Quick, get some water. He's... Get some water. Oh, Mickey, please speak to me. Wake up. Oh, dear. It was too much for him. He couldn't believe it. Good thing I didn't say yes to the thousand... - ...or he'd have dropped dead. - Yeah. Are you all right, Mickey? Speak to me, Mickey. - What happened? - Mr. Randall's gonna publish your song. Look, here's your advance check for $ 100. Gee, Mr. Randall, you don't know what this means to me. I'll never forget you. You know, you can always be my publisher. I'm telling you that. You better get him home before he passes out again. - Don't have to worry. - I understand. I'm not ever gonna get the big head like... - You can always be my publisher. - Okay. Wait a minute, friend, you've got my head. Didn't hurt, though. Didn't hurt. - See you later. - It's all right. You know, it's just like coming home from a big battle the winners. - Yeah, it was a tough fight, Ma, but we won. - Oh, Mickey, I'm so proud of you. But think of all the time lost because my stuff wasn't recognized before. Oh, well, all geniuses have trouble getting started. Sure, that's what makes them geniuses. Oh, Mickey, aren't they pretty? Wait a minute, I wanna pick some. Just think of it, Pat. My first 100 bucks. - And it's only the beginning too. - Is it really the beginning? Does it mean that I'm really on my way in the theater? - I want success so. - And you'll have it. I know you will, Mickey. Just think when our names are up in electric lights. You, the big composer and producer, and me, the singing star. Oh, and I'll work hard for you, Mickey, honest I will. Yeah, then when we go on our vacations to Europe... ...you know, like you read in the paper. - Our folks won't have to worry. - No. We can pay the bills then. Pat, sometimes do you ever feel older than your folks? Lots. Especially when they talk about 40 weeks on the road. Yeah, and making a comeback. Gee, it must be terrible to be a has-been. Don't talk like that. It scares me. We gotta work hard and make a lot of dough for our folks. That will be fun. Oh, won't it be fun, Mickey? Oh, with both of us in there pitching, it certainly will be. It's got to be. Pat, I'd like to buy you a little something out of this 100 bucks, but I... oh, we gotta pay our grocery bill too. Well, I... Just the same I'd like to show my appreciation some way. Would you like my pin? It's your music class pin. Well, what do you want me to say? You know what I want you to say. Well, I won't. All right then, don't. Oh, Pat, I do. You do what? I do, what you want me to say and I won't. Very much. - Well, that settles that. - Yeah. Gee, you know, it's good for a man to have responsibilities. Your act is just as sure fire as it was when you were knocking them in the aisle. Say, Dad. Dad, what's going on here? Mickey, we're going on the road, all of us. - Oh, gee, that's swell, Dad. When do leave? - Mickey, none of us kids can go. None of the kids can... What do you mean, Dad? Well, you see, son, it's only the acts that go, no excess baggage. You call talent excess baggage? Dad, there's a lot of entertainment on this side of the room. You folks are responsible for it. We're your kids, chips off the old block. Most of us were born in theaters, greasepaint in our veins. You say you don't want us to go on a stage. No. You want us to be lawyers and brokers and your girls to marry rich guys. - I suppose that's bad being a broker. - Clark Gable ain't on relief. - You're too young, all of you. - Oh, yeah? I suppose I'm too young to sell a song I wrote. Look, 100 bucks in advance. - What? - Mickey, you sold your song. - Yeah, Mom, and it's all yours too. - Oh, Mickey, I'm so proud of you. - Thanks. - Of course, I always knew you had talent. Well, so do the other kids. I've seen them do their stuff. Take our sister for instance. What a voice, a natural. Two more years and she'll be in the Met. Patsy and Don Jr. And Dody are swell dancers. - But our acts are routine, they're standard. - I'll say they're standard. So standard that when you miss a line the audience can prompt you. All right, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be fresh, but I've got a new slant on things. Got my finger on the pulse of the public. You wanna hear something? Molly and Patsy come on over here. Look out. Spread out kids, give us room to work here, will you? Get set. We'll show them whether we got talent or not. Wait, until you hear, this will send you solid. Now, come on, kids, give your all. To look at us you'd never dream The two of us were twins In fact it's quite ridiculously odd But speaking pedagogically And not too biologically We're really just like two peas in a pod We both like to swim And we both like to dance We both could fall in love with Gable If we had the chance Our tastes are just the same Except for just one thing I like opera I like swing We both like to eat But it pains us to discuss The fact we like potatoes But potatoes don't like us But when we want to sing a song We're really on a spot For I sing sweet And I sing hot You are my lucky star My darling, you're my lucky star I saw you from afar Rudolpho Robert Taylor Minneapolis and St. Paul You are My lucky star Once there was a barber A barber who lived in Spain He was a barbering fool, A shaving fool, shaving fool from Spain He was kind of crazy, He was always singing in the rain His name was Figaro The barber of Seville Figaro Figaro Figaro was Spanish Every time there's a bullfight He quits Shave and a hair cut, six bits Hi de ho Figaro, Hi de ho Figaro Hi de ho ho de ho fig fig Figaro Hi de ho Figaro, Hi de ho Figaro Hi de ho ho de ho fig fig Figaro Figaro Figaro Figaro We're gonna break it up tonight Stand back Give them room - You've gotta clown - Yeah, you gotta clown on old Broadway Broadway rhythm, it's got me Everybody dance Broadway rhythm, it's got me Everybody dance Out on the gay white way And each merry cafe Orchestras play Taking your breath away with that Broadway rhythm, it's got me Everybody sing Everybody stand right up and dance - Hey, Pop, how did you like that? - Oh, it was fine. Grand, son. Great, but you see, for instance, that number, it just wouldn't fit in. - Well, for Pete's sake, why? - Because we're doing a comeback show. The kind of acts we did on the big time. They've got value, a selling point. Oh, I get you, Pop. I've gotta show you, just like the rest of the world. I thought we could help you, but you don't want us on the stage, do you? - Just because you're all... Just because... - Wait a minute, Mickey. All right, I hope you're all a big success. Mickey's sort of excited, that's all. - Wait a minute, Mick. - Don't mind what the folks say, Mickey. - We're with you. - Sure we are. - Everything will be all right. - Buck up, Mickey. I shouldn't have shot my mouth off the way I did. It's all right, they understand. I wouldn't wanna hurt Dad for all the show business in the world. - Forget it. - Certainly, our time will come. - You bet it will. - Sure, sure. Listen, you kids, I think our time has come. - What do you mean? - I'll tell you. Might as well face it, our folks are up against it, and up against it good. I've been snooping around... - ...know what I found out? - What? There's a frame up to get the actors and their kids out of it. Our houses are mortgaged unless payments are up to date by July 1 st or out we go. Yeah, I know something else too. Miss Steele of the Welfare Society... ...is getting a petition to send us to a state work school. - Work school? - Are you kidding? - Can I go too, Mickey? - Quiet, will you, Bobs? She thinks we ought to be learning a trade instead of the theater. She's against show business. Just be her chance, while our folks are on the road. We can't go on the road. No, we're too young. We're excess baggage. You willing to stick together and pull yourselves out? - You bet. - I've got an idea. Our folks think we're babes in arms? We'll show them whether we are or not. I'm gonna write a show for us and put it on right here in Seaport. The most up to date thing these hicks here have ever seen. Opening night, we'll have Max Gordon, Sam Harris down to give us the once over. How about it, kids? We'll get every kid in this town on our side and we'll start now. What do you say? All right. Come on kids, let's go. They call us babes in arms But we are babes in armor They laugh at babes in arms But we'll be laughing far more On city streets and farms They'll hear a rising war cry Youth will arrive Let them know you're alive Make it your cry - They call us babes in arms - We never dance - They think they must direct us - Got no chance - But if we're babes in arms - To find romance - We'll make them all respect us - Why our arms? - Why have we got our arms? - And what's our eyes? - What have we got our sight for? - Our sight for, fight for. Play day is done We've a place in the sun We must fight for So babes in arms - To arms - To arms To arms, babes in arms - We don't wanna go to county farms - No Come on, you babes in arms Stand up for your rights We're coming, we're coming Come on, you sons and daughters We gotta fight We're coming, we're coming George Washington was just a kid When he chopped down that tree But if they'd locked him up for that Where'd this country be? - We gotta stand - We gotta stand - We gotta stand right up - We gotta stand right up We got to stand right up And tell them that we're right Yeah, we gotta fight. Yeah, we gotta fight Fight, fight What do we cheer for? What are we here for? Why were we born? What do we cry for? What do we die for? Why do we mourn? Life doesn't stop, life doesn't wait It goes on We've got to step We've got to skate into the dawn It's a new day It's a new day, our flag's unfurled Come on, let's tell it to the world On city streets and farms You'll hear a rising war cry Youth will arrive, let them know you're alive Make it your cry They call us babes in arms A tisket, a tasket, Who wants your yellow basket? They think they must direct us Babes in arms are growing up, Growing up, growing, growing But if we're babes in arms Going around the mulberry bush Who wants to go around the mulberry bush? We'll make them all respect us Hooray, hooray, it's Emancipation Day - Why have we got our arms? - We got arms so we can fight What have we got our sight for? Play day is done We've a place in the sun We must fight for So babes in arms To arms In the beginning, we will see Patsy singing... ...the most recently published song number ""Good Morning,"" followed by... Where is the other piece of music? What are you doing, son? Oh, nothing. Just scribbling. - Another song? - A show. You're so much like me, you're funny. - I am? - Exactly. You know, I used to troupe with your grandpop, was he stubborn. I used to try to get him to put new things in the act. You know, like you do to me? - Wouldn't he do it either? - Not a chance. - What happened? - What happened? He was the greatest headliner in vaudeville, right up to the day that he died. Yeah, I know what you mean, Pop. You know, Mickey, you're like a lot of kids. You think your old man is finished, washed up. Why, Dad, listen here. They don't come any better than you. Anyway, your mom and me are leaving in the morning. I'm sorry you can't go along the way you used to. I'm going to miss you, a lot. Yeah. I know, Dad. But I'm depending on you to stay here and take care of things. - I hope things break real big for you, Dad. - Thanks. - Is Judge Black in? - Yes, ma'am. I wonder what cause she's agitating for now. I never saw a woman get so excited over other people's business. My duty is concerned with those poor children. And something has got to be done about it. I want my nephew to tell you what he knows. Go on. Well, the vaudeville kids kind of run in a gang. They seem to be cooking up something. Next thing you know, we'll have a series of filling station robberies. - Who's the ring leader? - A tough little kid named Moran. There's no doubt about it, judge, he's a bad influence around town. - Do you know him very well? - No. Just to speak to. I go to military school upstate. Just step outside, Jeff. I want to talk to Judge Black alone. As you very well know, John, I'm head of the welfare board here. And I'm serving notice on you... ...that I'm not gonna let innocent children be the victims of society. Their parents have no income. We don't know if those youngsters eat regularly. We know they stay away from school half the time. They're undisciplined. They haven't a chance of learning an occupation that'll support them. I call that criminal. But, Martha, you'd be taking them away from their homes. Homes? Those poor little things haven't any worthy of the name. Martha, my whole life's been lived in this town. I saw the actors come in. They built their homes here. They built the church, the library. Why, their taxes even paved the roads. They're sweet lovable people. Just grownup children. And we ought to thank God... ...for the pleasure and laughter they've given us in our drab lives. Right now they're having hard times. And you want me to help you torment these poor folks... ...by taking their children away from them? I won't do it, Martha. - You mean, you won't...? - And that's final. You'd sacrifice the children for the grownups. All right, John, I accept your challenge. I'll see this thing through alone. Our bankroll will only stand two Cokes. I never drink anything but Cokes anyway. Two great, big, large, wonderful, expensive Cokes. - Here. - Patty, look, let's pretend. All right, where are we? We're in the Stork Club in New York City and it's after our opening night. - I'm in tails and a white tie. - And I have on an ermine coat. Oh, Mickey, I've just got to have an ermine coat. Oh, sure, sure. And the Cokes here, this is champagne. Oh, aren't you just mad about champagne? Yeah, but if this was champagne, I'd rather have the money it costs instead. Now, don't worry about it. You thought up that big parade to advertise the show... ...and anybody that can think that up... - ...can think up anything. - Thanks. Just think when those New York producers sign us up. You know, I've been thinking, maybe we should get us an agent. Sometimes you get worse than I do. I'm worried about getting the show on. I never realized how much a piece of cellophane and a yard of cheesecloth cost. What have you planned? Our folks owe the stores a lot of dough, I'll say: ""If you want to collect that money you've got to put dough into our show... ...so we can be a success then pay you back."" I don't understand, but it sounds wonderful. I got the ideas out of a paper. Seems a lot of countries are borrowing money... ...so why can't an American go in and borrow money the same as anybody else? Sometimes I think that being a great Broadway producer... ...isn't going to be big enough for you, Mickey. Here comes trouble. Do take the darlings, Alexander. Let them walk around a bit. In California, we have drive-ins. You stay in the car. - Who's the girl with him? - I think it's... It is. It's Baby Rosalie. - Remember the kid movie star? - Oh, yeah. Hello, Patsy. Miss Barton, this is Miss Essex, the once famous Baby Rosalie. How do you do? I remember you very well. Really? Did you see my biggest success, The Queen's Little Daughter... ...or did you see my smash hit, The Baby General? Well, let me see, I... It all seems so long ago. Sauerkraut juice, please. - I watch my weight very carefully. - Yes. I hear you're going to produce a show. Oh, he is. This is Mickey Moran. - How do you do? - Anything for me in your show? I'm dying to get back in the harness. You? In... Why, I think that would be swell. And with your name and all... You don't wanna fool around with a punk like this. You be quiet. You wanna come over to my place for dinner and talk it over? - Tomorrow night? Oh, I... - Say, listen. My aunt's gonna put you in the state work school where you belong. Why, you...! - Please, don't fight over me. - Stop it. Mickey! - Don't worry, it's a pleasure. - Stop it! Stop it! Oh, my perfumes. Hey, get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here, all of you. Get out. Come now, come now, quiet, please. This is not a picnic. This is a very serious matter. Proceed, Mr. Marks. And when these young roughnecks finished up... ...my drugstore looked as though they'd taken an ax to it. I want you to know that seven bottles... ...of my most expensive perfumes were busted. Forgive me if I say I told you so. Martha, my faith in human nature would be shattered if you didn't. Why doesn't somebody tell what he said to my brother? I'll tell. I was there. He told Mickey his aunt was gonna put him in the state work school. I hope you see how this proves every point I made. Even with provocation, wrecking this man's shop... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Young man, I'll trouble you to step into my private office. There are things I'd like to clear up. The rest of you will kindly wait here. - Mickey. - Well? Let you in on a little secret. I don't need those glasses any more than a rabbit. But in times of stress, they're the best safety valve I ever had. Gives me time to think too before acting. - You ought to find something like that. - Oh, I got it. You mean I ought to think first and then bust-up drugstores afterwards. Come over here and sit down. - Quit school, huh? - Yeah, last fall. Tried to get a job. Started writing songs, you know, show numbers. Where's your father playing now? Schenectady. Good booking? I'm so worried about my family, judge, I'm sick inside me. Miss Steele might be right, Mickey. It's not fair for you youngsters to be carrying grownup burdens. I'm wondering if you were my son, if I wouldn't rather see you in some school... ...getting an education. Yes, I think if I were your parents, I might sign Miss Steele's petition. No, no, no, judge, you don't understand. She don't understand either. Why, she don't mean no harm to us... ...but we're not her kind of people or yours either. We belong in show business. We gotta start young so we can get some steel in our backbone. Well, gee, we're developing it. You couldn't teach us a trade. We got one. And you couldn't do without it. We're only kids now... ...but someday we're gonna be the guys that make you laugh and cry. Think that there's a little stardust left on life's dirty old pan. She don't understand. Why, she'd put butterflies to work making rubber tires. I'm not saying I hate her, but why can't people leave other people alone? Defense sustained. Case dismissed. I'll give you 30 days probation to square yourself with Mr. Marks. Here he is now. - What happened, Mickey? - Was it all right? Oh, everything's swell. I guess I showed you, twerp. The judge bought out the whole front row. Look at that. Come on, kids, we got some rehearsing to do. Isn't that marvelous? It seems we stood And talked like this before We looked at each other In the same way then But I can't remember where or when The clothes you're wearing Are the clothes you wore The smile you are smiling You were smiling then But I can't remember where or when Some things that happen For the first time Seem to be happening again And so it seems that we have met before And laughed before And loved before But who knows where or when Come on, put some life in that song, will you? Patsy, will you hook my collar in the back for me, please? So you're going to dinner with Rosalie tonight? Don't go getting jealous. We haven't got time for that. - She made eyes at you. - Oh, you're crazy. I'm not. She's practicing to be a glamour girl, so she can get back into pictures. If those two sing that song like that, the audience will think it's a lullaby. It seems we've stood And talked like this before We looked at each other In the same way then But I can't remember where or when That's right. With feeling like that. I figure you have to know what you're singing about... ...before you can give the idea to others. Don and Molly don't know what they're singing about? They're just bashful in front of people, that's all. Come on, let's go out and see if we can't needle them up a bit. And so it seems that we have met before And laughed before And loved before - But who knows where - But who knows where - Or when - Or when That's what the audience will be doing if you sing the song like that. - We were just rehearsing. - Yeah. Well, that's no excuse. Molly's heard pop say a million times, do your best always if you wanna improve. Wait until Dad's suit fits you before you try to talk like him. The coat fits all right. I can button it up so nobody can see how loose the pants are. I wanted my white pants, but wouldn't they be at the cleaners? She'll be so busy talking about herself that she won't notice. Maybe not, but lay off me. You gotta get some feeling into this. This show is all business. - Get in there and try the number again. - Do we have to do it in the canoe? It's cramped in there, you can't move. All right. Then come on, do it over here... ...so long as you get some feeling into it. Spread out. Kids, get back to your places. We're gonna try the number again. - Bring that settee down here, please. - I wish they would make up their minds. Spread out. Give them plenty of room to work. Start the number back of the settee here and later on you can come around in front. For goodness' sake, put some real feeling into it. All right, Antonio. Give them the introduction. It seems we stood And talked like this before We looked at each other In the same way then But I can't remember where or when The clothes you're wearing Are the clothes you wore The smile you are smiling You were smiling then But I can't remember where or when Some things that happened For the first time Seem to be happening again And so it seems that we have met before And laughed before And loved before But who knows where Or when And so it seems that we have met before And laughed before And loved before - But who knows where - But who knows where - Or when - Or when Swell. Swell. That's the way to sing. In a few minutes, go over the number again... ...so you'll be sure you got it perfect. Tony, listen. Go over that interlude again, that was terrible. Well, I gotta go, kids. Good night, everybody. Come on, Pat. Send them all home at 9 and tell them to be here at 10 in the morning. Okay. I hope you have a nice dinner. Oh, this is all business, Pat. You look wonderful, Mickey. Thanks, for always saying the right thing. I can lick wildcats now. - Good night. - Good night. I beg your pardon, sir. Whom do you wish to see? Baby... Miss Essex. - I'm afraid she'll be unable to see you, sir. - Why not? Miss Essex is expecting an important theatrical impresario. Hey, that's me. Oh, I don't believe I heard the name, sir. I know you didn't, because I didn't say it. It's Moran, Michael Z. Moran. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Won't you... Won't you step in, sir? Thanks. Oh, Michael. I hardly expected you so soon. So nice to see you again. Yes, nice to see you too. I know I kept you waiting. No, you haven't kept me waiting. I mean, that is... ...I have been waiting to see you ever since I met you in the drugstore. You're just as impetuous as I thought you were. I am? Dinner is served, Miss Rosalie. Thank you, Bartlett. Oh, I almost forgot. You haven't met my darling yet. This is Kai. - Cute, isn't he? - This is Mr. Moran, Kai, baby. You give him a nice wet kiss. Oh, I hope he didn't frighten you. No, no, no. No, he didn't at all. He's an affectionate little fellow, isn't he? Now, you run along and play, Kai, darling. He has temperament, just like me, daddy says. Gee, the crickets are pretty thick out tonight, aren't they? I've never tasted a tastier... Miss Essex. Oh, don't call me that. Call me Baby, everybody does. Well, all right. What do you do with yourself, Baby? I study voice, French and dancing. That's why I didn't go to Maine with father. You see, I'm preparing for a comeback. I don't see why I should accept failure. Why I should let them tell me I'm through. Do you? Heck, no. That's why I think my production would be perfect for you. Do you think so? Oh, I was praying you'd say that. Oh, Michael, don't tell me you're going to give me my chance. Well, if I had the dough, I would. How much do you need? Well, let me... Let me see. We're gonna use a barn some actors used last summer, turn it into an outdoor theater. I figured if we all pitched in together... That is, for the scenery and the costumes and everything, it would run us about $287. Have you got it yet? No. Well, you have now. Move over here where we can talk. - Oh, it will be exciting. - Yeah, yeah. I can hardly wait. We'll work together wonderfully, you and I. How about an orchestra? We can have the Rangerettes in for nothing. Enchanting. It'll be a great show. Shall we drink to that? Why, you bet. Good luck. I hope so. Cigar, sir? Oh, do have one. They're daddy's best. Well, I can't pass up anything like this. I suggest, sir, it would draw better if one bites the end off. How could I make a mistake like that? Don't draw the cigar smoke in, Mr. Moran. Blow it out for your own sake. This is... This is delightful. When does the show start rehearsing? Well, as soon as I can get it... When? Well, I'll phone you. I'll phone you tomorrow and let you know. You'll have to excuse me, please. I've got another appointment. Thanks for the dinner. It was swell while it lasted. - Hey, Mickey, here's your pants. - Where have you been? Go on, get up there in your place, would you? All right, kids, that's enough. Take a rest. We'll try the dance later on. In the meantime, we'll take a reprise of this ""Where or When"" number. Pass the parts out. We'll take the other in a little bit. - Hey, Mickey. - What do you want? Have you told Patsy yet? No, I've tried to get it out a million times. I just can't do it. Well, she's on her way in and Baby Rosalie will be here any minute now. Well, I guess it's gotta be now. - Come on, take over, will you, Don? - Sure. Oh, Mickey, I've practiced until I'm nearly hoarse. - Gosh, isn't it wonderful? - Yes, it sure is, Pat. But come over here, I... I wanna talk to you for a minute. What is it? - We're in a tough spot, Pat. - Yeah? Yes, we've gotta have a lot of dough to put on this show. Well, we need an angel, you know, and... Can you take it? Dish it out. Well, we found an angel. But in order to keep her, we have to give her the lead in the show. Sing my songs? The songs you wrote for me? Say my lines? Oh, Mickey... We were gonna do it together. This was gonna be our first show. You and me in there pitching, just like you said. Yes, I know, but what can we do? I can't bear it. Oh, don't cry, Pat, because if you do, then I'm just gonna call the whole thing off. Because, I mean, this is too much for me. Who's crying? Don't be silly. Pat, would you punch me right in the nose if I asked you to understudy? Katherine Cornell did it. I should be proud. It's gonna be a tough job, kid... ...because this Baby Rosalie is just a bundle of temperament. Will you help me keep her quiet, and will you stick in there and pitch? Put her there. Pat, you're... You're the tops. Hello, there. Hello, everybody. Hello. Alexander, do take the little darlings for a walk. Thanks. Just getting the kinks out. All right. Come on, kids, let's try the Antony and Cleopatra sketch. And I want the scene set just like we're gonna have it with props and everything. A little pepper now. Stand up, honey, so I can brush you off. It's so close today. Yes, it is sultry, isn't it? - May I get you a glass of water? - Thank you, my dear. Isn't she a sweet little girl? All right... ...bring the window up in position. Over the divan, please. There, that's fine. Okay, give me the parts now, will you? There, that's fine Bobs. Don, here's your part. Sid? - Yeah. - Miss Essex, please. And I'd like Miss Essex's headdress now. This is the gate here and the guard keepers right there. Now, this Cleopatra's throne room. A very luxurious layout overlooking the Nile. This is a swell divan covered with satin cushions and ostrich feathers... - ...jewels and pearls, things like that. - Glorious. Don, you entrance from over here and you see Baby reclining... Will you recline, please, Miss Essex? That's fine. Now, look. This Mark Antony is a sort of a man about town. Very... Very suave, see? You, Baby, you're Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt. Very beautiful, lovely and... And suave, see? You hardly know him. He's busted up your army... ...so the only way you can keep your throne is to have him fall for you. Listen, Don. You're a... You're a Clark Gable-type. Very modern, polished, and, well, full of suaveness. You see what I mean? - Yeah, you mean we're suave. - Yeah, that... Come on, now. Let's try it once everybody. From the beginning now, from the curtain. Ready? Curtain. - Greetings, Mark. What's new? - Your Majesty. No, no, no, that's not quite it, Miss Essex. Look, do you mind if I show you? Stand over there. Now, watch me. You're down here. You're reclining here. You watching? Now, I want you to get up and I want you to slink. Slink, a regal slink. Sort of bouncing-like, see what I mean? All right, go ahead, Don. Your Majesty. - What's your name? - Just call me Baby, everybody does. Just call me Baby, everybody... No, what I meant was, what was your line? The only man in the world who I would go to meet. You're the only man in the world I'd go to meet. See? More... More... - Suave? - Yes. Well, go on. Now, let's try it again. Come on, right from where we left off. Here we go. You're up there, Baby. That's it, fine. Your Majesty. I have a feeling I'm going to find Egypt fascinating. Terrible. Terrible. Don, terrible. - I didn't think so. - It's the way you read the lines. There's no feeling to it or anything. Maybe we'd better try it here on the couch. Don, come and sit beside her. I want a more virile approach, like Clark Gable would do it. Come on, do it once for me, will you? Your Majesty, I have a feeling I'm going to find Egypt fascinating. No, no, that's still not it, Don. Let me show you, will you? Just stand up there for a minute. Look. Now, see here, Cleo. You've stalled me for the last time. You can't push Mark Antony around like that and get away with it. Last month, I took over the south side. Now, I'm taking over the palace. And what's more, I'm taking over you, see? Get your things packed. We're taking a honeymoon on the Nile. I've got a barge waiting with the motor running. Now, you see? That's more the way Gable would do it. - Well, Gable and I work differently. - Yeah, that's why he works more often. Okay, Sid, it's your cue. Don, you're over here now. Cleopatra, who is this man? - Who's this? - Well, that's your uncle, Croesus. But Cleopatra didn't have an uncle. Well, she has now. - Shall I keep going while I'm hot? - You're as cold as an ice cube. Look, I want this uncle to be a violent character. Like Lionel Barrymore would play it. I mean, when he comes into this room... ...and finds his niece here with a strange man, he's... He's gotta be... - Suave? - No, furious. Look, Sid, let me show you what I mean, huh? Now, this is the way Barrymore would do it. Now, watch, Sid. Now, see here, Cleo. This isn't by chance one of your latest admirers, is it? Why, uncle, I don't know what you mean. Don't try to act innocent, my child. The whole town's talking. Now, see here, sonny, we don't like strangers hanging around this place. I'll give you just 48 hours to get out. Pardon me, Don. When I go, Cleo goes with me. I love her, you see? Out of the way, uncle. We're leaving. Now, look here, Cleo. I'm your uncle. I love you as if you were my own niece. But this man is marrying you just for your money. She's going with me, understand? Do you love me because I'm worth $50 million? Nonsense. I'd love you if you only had $40 million. Money isn't everything. And I love you. Yes, that's fine, Miss Essex. That's just right. Here, Don, you take over from there. Come on, Clark Antony, finish the scene. Well, if you insist. - Is this the sleeper bus for Schenectady? - Yes, sir. Have you seen a little girl about? Oh, never mind. Oh, Pat. Patty. Look, let me talk to you. - Will you listen to me, please? - No, I won't. Wait a minute, that's acting like a big baby. I'm not a baby, Mr. Moran. - Then why are you going to Schenectady? - I wanna see my mother. - Why? - None of your business. Wait a minute, Pat. Listen, I'm doing the best I can. Oh, you're doing grand for Baby Rosalie. - Whatever I've done, I've had to do. - Did you have to kiss Baby Rosalie today? Well, that's my business, honey. I'm a director. Then you'd better get to work, Mr. Ziegfeld. The Girl Scouts are just clamoring for you. - Oh, you don't have to talk... - Here. I suppose you want this too. Indian giver. Listen, how can I be an Indian giver...? Oh, Pat, listen. Won't you let me explain? Hey! Hey, Patsy! Give me a chance to explain, will you? Will you let me...? I cried for you Now, it's your turn to cry over me Every road has a turning That's one thing you're learning I cried for you What a fool I used to be But I'll find two eyes Just a little bit bluer I'll find a heart Just a little bit truer I cried for you Now, it's your turn to cry Over me I know I'm no glamour girl like Baby... Like her. But maybe someday, you'll realize that glamour isn't the only thing in this world. If your show's a flop, you'll find you can't eat glamour for breakfast. Anyway, I might be pretty good-looking myself... ...when I grow out of this ugly duckling stage. And you're no Clark Gable yourself. But that's all right. You go your way and I'll go mine. Don't worry about me. I'll recover. Time is a great healer. But in the future, if we should meet again at the opera or at a ball... ...and I'm dazzling in my diamonds and pearls and ermine wraps... ...and surrounded by lords and dukes and princes... ...you'll probably be sorry. And you'll probably realize that life is... ...just an idiot's delight. And as I speed through the dark night into the abyss of oblivion... ...I can only say thanks. Thanks for the memory. I'll find two eyes Just a little bit bluer I'll find a heart Just a little bit truer I cried for you Now, it's your turn to cry Over me - George, everybody in? - All but Eddie. - He'll be here shortly. - Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes. - You're on seconds, folks. - Okay. - Who opens the show tonight? - You fellows do. We do? What's the idea...? Hey, Joe, why do we open the bill? Listen, we've gotta take turns in opening the show. - We're all headliners. - But we got a terrific finish. - You want to see anyone? - Yes, I wanna see my mother, Mrs. Barton. - Okay. Dressing Room Number 4. - Thank you. We'll try it that way tonight and we'll see how it works. - For the love of Mike, Patsy. - Hello, Mr. Moran. - What are you doing here? - I got kind of lonesome for my mother. Things got so tough you had to come up here, huh? - Oh, no. Everything's just fine. - Lillian, Lillian, I got a surprise for you. - Look what I found in the hall. - Why, Patsy. Why, did the house burn down or something? Can't a girl come to see her mother without everybody thinking she's crazy? Hello, Mrs. Moran. - Hi, Patsy. - When did you get in here? Patsy, tell me, what's Mickey doing? What's Mickey doing? He's got a lot of kids together and he's gonna put on a show, a wonderful show. - He's doing what? - Dear, don't get excited. - He didn't say anything in his postcard. - Is Junior in it? - How's Dody? - How Frankie's dance? - It's grand. - What's this baloney about a show? It's the truth. He wrote it, and now he's gonna produce it. And he's got the Rangerettes and Baby Rosalie and... oh, he's got a lot of kids. No kidding. It's gonna be swell. Why did Mickey do this? Miss Steele said that we weren't having the proper care... ...and she threatened to send us to the state work school. - What state work school? - An institution? How do you like that? Our kids in a work school. Listen, folks, let's give up this silly tour and go home. - I'm going home. - Right. George, we can't do that just because the going is tough. - I know business will pick up next week. - You told us that last week... I'm gonna put you all out of here... - ...because I wanna talk to Patsy. - Right you are. Everybody get out of here. Mickey's show sounds elegant. Where did he get the money? - I don't know. - Isn't Baby Rosalie the movie baby? - She's the star of the show. - Wonderful. Now, dear, tell me, why aren't you in it? Oh, I thought I wanted a theatrical career, but I changed my mind. Why? Too many heartaches. - Now, what do you know about heartaches? - Well... You and Mickey quarrel? You did, didn't you? And you quit the show and came up here to see me? You shouldn't have done that, Patsy. Well, he took all my songs and gave them to her. Doesn't matter. - Why not? - Mickey was doing it for everybody. Patsy, your daddy was a minstrel man. So was his daddy. They did plenty of crazy things, but they never walked out on a show. But, Mother, Mickey and I were... And she kept putting her arms around him and I just couldn't... Sid, girls, what are you standing around for? Hurry up, get ready. Aren't you finished with that? I may be a sap about the men I pick, but I'm no quitter. So there. My family are all troupers and we don't walk out on any show. Who said anything about walking out on any...? Oh, women. See who it is, Millicent. - Is Miss Essex dressed? - Come in, Michael. Oh, how's our little star? Fine, I hope. - A little nervous. Sit down. - Thanks. - How's our director? - I'm a little nervous too, and then some. That's a sign of a good trouper. Then I must be great. Gee, I wished I hadn't plastered my name all over everything. - You'll get used to it. Look at me. - Well, maybe. Get out of my way or I'll put you in jail where you belong, the lot of you. My father! Well, there you are, young lady. - Where's this Michael Z. Moran? - I'm him. So you're the smart twerp that was going to exploit the prestige of an important name. - Why, for a nickel... - Wait a minute... Wait nothing. Here, young lady, get into this coat. We're getting out of here. - But she's the star of the show. - Don't make me laugh. I'm grooming her for a comeback. Millicent, you pack up. Come on. - But, father, I've got a great part. - Listen, you can't take her away. - Take her. She's a pain in the neck. - Come on. - Listen. Will you listen? - Father, dear... - She's got money in the show. - Kiss that goodbye. I'll tell you when you have a great part just as I always did. - What are you gonna do? - What about the audience? - Are we gonna give a show? - What's gonna happen? Quiet, will you? I don't know what I'm gonna do? Give me a chance to think. Come on with me, Patsy. Everybody out but Patsy. The show is going on. The curtain goes up in seven minutes. Now, snap into it, will you, kids? Get your makeup on. I wrote this show for you, see? Get out there and show them I wasn't crazy when I did it. Don't think things have changed between you and me. Go out and sell it. - Oh, Mickey, you're... - Never mind. I know what I am, an Indian giver. What's the delay, Mickey? I didn't know you could have so much trouble. Would you do me a favor? Would you make a speech...? Mickey, here's your makeup. You'd better hurry. Tell them that Patsy's going on instead. - What's happened? - Tell you later. Would you do that for me, please? - All right, Mickey. - Thanks. My daddy was a minstrel man When minstrels were the thing When Mr. Bones and Mr. Jones Danced the buck and wing When Eddie Leonard was so great And Primrose was the king Gee, I'd like to be a minstrel man I'd like to black my face Put on a stovepipe hat Get out an old banjo And go once again down memory lane With an old-fashioned minstrel show Going to run all night Going to run all day I'll bet my money on the bobtail nag Somebody bet on the bay Here they come. Hurry, we go on in a minute. I'm hurrying. Come from Alabammy Come from Alabammy Come from Alabammy Come from Alabammy Come from Alabammy With my banjo on my knee I come from Alabammy With my banjo on my knee I'm going to Louisiana For my true love to see Now, it rained all night the day I left The weather, it was so dry The sun so hot I froze to death Susanna, don't you cry Oh, Susanna, oh, don't you cry for me I've come from Alabama With a banjo on my knee Oh, Susanna, oh, don't you cry for me I come from Alabammy With my banjo on my knee Gentlemen, be seated Mr. Bones, Mr. Bones I've a question to ask - There is something that I want to know - Well, tell me, sonny Mr. Bones, will you tell me And answer me right Who's that lady You were with last night? Now, Mr. Interlocutory You are a curious man But I will tell you if you want to know Now, so help me, Moses And upon my life That was no lady, that was my wife Hallelujah upon his life That was no lady, it was his wife Mr. Tambo I've a question to ask you tonight And with all your fancy knowledge You should know Mr. Tambo, will you tell us And give us a treat Tell us why does a chicken Cross the street I has studied up my geography Studied up my history Studied up my poultry with pride And I am here to repeat A chicken crosses the street Just to get on the other side Mr. Rooster, don't you hide The chicken crossed the street To reach the other side There's a grand old minstrel man Whose name we hold so dear I know that you'll remember him The moment that you hear Ida, sweet as apple cider Oh, sweeter than all I know Know, know, know, know, know, know Come out, oh, won't you come out In the silvery moonlight Of love we'll whisper so soft and low We were sailing along - We were sailing along - On Moonlight Bay Down the silvery bay We could hear the voices ringing They seemed to say - You have stolen my heart - A maiden's heart - Now, don't go away - Don't you ever go away As we sang love's old sweet song On Moonlight Bay I am here to state I am here to relate To explain and make it plain That I'm just wild about Harry And Harry's wild about me The heavenly blisses of his kisses Fills me with ecstasy He's sweet just like chocolate candy Or like the honey from a bee Oh, I'm just wild about Harry And he's just wild about... Cannot do without He's just wild about me I'm just wild about Mandy And Mandy's wild about me I'm just wild about Harry And Harry's wild about me The heavenly blisses of his kisses Fill me with ecstasy He's sweet just like chocolate candy And just like honey from the bees Wait a minute, folks! Don't go. Please stay. Don't leave. It's only a little shower. Well, you'll have to admit, it took a hurricane to stop me. Mickey, that was a fine effort. Where's Dad? Mom, where's Dad? You have to keep pounding on the piano? Nobody can hear himself think. - Nobody can think in this house anyways. - You're so smart...! Children, please. Gee, I'm sorry, Mom. Don't worry, he'll be home. He'll be home? Say, what is this? You two trying to keep something from me? Something happen that I don't know about? Where's pop? Mickey, don't shout. I'm nervous, that's all. - I wish your father was home. - He didn't come home. He didn't get up and go out before I did. - Where is he? What...? - Mickey, quit picking on Mama. If you must know, well, we're afraid Dad's been drinking. - Dad? - No, no, it isn't that. - I'm quite sure he's looking for work. - What? For the act? - No, he's through with show business. - Through? That's all he knows. That's all he's good for. He's trying to find something steady. Something we can depend on. Maybe you could sell Mr. Randall a couple of your songs to tide us over. - I was over there this morning. - Well? They got enough songs on the shelf to drive the country crazy. I'll still keep on trying. Maybe Dad is right. Maybe he is through. But I'm not. Show business owes us something and I'm gonna collect. Is that so? We're through. All of us. Starting over. And if ever I hear show business, song writing... ...or that word vaudeville mentioned here, I'll kick the tar out of you. You didn't raise me on that kind of talk. I'll take that rap. I didn't know any better. I do now. Come on, take it easy. Take it easy. The theater is full of promises, great promises... ...so long as you hand over your heart and soul. Then something new comes along, you're tossed in the ditch. The procession goes on. Well, I got a job. I start tomorrow. Doing what? - Running an elevator. - Listen... - At least we'll eat. - Yeah, that counts me out. - What do you mean? - I'm getting out on my own. - No, you're not. - No? You just try and stop me. - Mickey. - Well? - Mr. Moran. - Yes? I've brought the papers. Papers? What papers? After you've signed them, return them to Judge Black's office. Have the children there at 9:00 on Friday morning. Hey, what...? What is this? - Haven't you told them yet? - I'll take care of this, thank you. I'm sorry. Dad... Dad, you've... You've turned against us. - You, you... - It'll only be for the time being. You'll get education there. I can't do it no other way and I won't let you be a tramp in the streets. Listen, son, you gotta be something. You'll thank me someday, I know you will. Quit talking like that. It makes me sick to hear you. Go on, sign the papers! - But that Steele, she'll never get me! - Shut up. All right, Dad. Here comes Mickey now. - Wait a minute. - What's happened? - What's the matter? - Something the matter? - What's up? - Anything wrong? They're gonna sign us to the state work school. - They are? - Oh, no. - Did you near that? - Hey, Mickey, here's a letter for you. The mailman just brought it. It's from Harry Maddox. - Say, that's the big producer. - Read it, Mickey. - Yeah, go on. - See what it says. You read it, Don. ""Dear Mickey. Your friend, Judge Black, talked me into coming to see your show. It was the only time I came near being drowned and liking it. Drop in and discuss your production with me. Sincerely yours, Harry Maddox."" Say, anybody got a dime that I can get to New York with? - Here, I got two bits. - Oh, what a pal. - Come on, let's go to the station with him. - All right. Look what it says in the paper about the show. ""Babes In Arms..."" Come on, get back on the stage. We got a lot of rehearsing to do. Come on. Hello. Yes, this is the Harry Maddox Theatrical Productions. Yes, ma'am. Yes, we're casting children for the new show. You're welcome. Stage mother. Why doesn't Mr. Maddox produce Ibsen instead of kid shows? You got me. Sorry, Mr. Maddox is busy. You'll have to wait. Hello. Yes, Mr. Maddox. No, he hasn't come in yet. Yes, sir. - I beg your pardon. - Only casting children today. I'm Joe Moran. Mr. Maddox sent for me. Mr. Moran. Oh, yes, he's expecting you. Please come right this way. Hello, Joe. By golly, it's good to see you. Thanks, Mr. Maddox. Cut it out. Where did you get that Mr. Maddox stuff? - Well, you're a big shot now, Harry. - Apple sauce. You know show business, up today and down tomorrow and back up again. Sit down, sit down, I wanna talk to you. Say, Joe, do you know it's taken me a month to find you? Well, Florrie and me have got a place down near the job. - You know, the kids went out on their own. - Yeah. Yes, I know. They'll... They'll do that, kids will. What I wanted to see you about was this. - I'm in a spot where you can help me out. - Oh, no show business. The world has been changing so rapidly in the last few years, it's kept us all dizzy. The public... The public is like the Frenchman's flea... ...you put your finger on them and boom, they aren't there. They're always hungry for something new. I'm not interested in the public. Didn't talk like that the night Mickey was born, back in the Palace Theater. When everybody in the audience got to be your brother and your sister. Gee, they were great that night. Remember? - Yeah, they were. - A lot of that's come back, Joe. Old-fashioned sentiment's not taboo anymore. And, Joe, a song-and-dance man as great as you are... ...is just as much of a miracle as he ever was. Leave me alone, Harry. I want no part of it. I stood on Broadway corners and watched the business I grew up in... ...that I was good in. I watched it pass me by like I had no place in it. Never turned around to see if your feelings were hurt. Kids had nothing. Home gone. I got up out of the rosin as often as I could. I'm tired. - I'll stay where I am. - You... Kidding yourself that you can live without doing what you were put here for. You mean to say that you think you can keep away from show business? No. Joe, I'm offering you a job. A job where you'll see the people crowding, sure they're gonna have a good time. You get to the theater, you meet your pals... ...you get your makeup on. You hear the orchestra tuning up. The stage manager calls, ""First act places, please. Curtain's going up."" Then the curtain goes up. Oh, boy, what a thrill. No, Joe. You and I, we can't ever live without it. We know too much about it. What's your proposition, Harry? Well, I've got a show. A new show. A bunch of kids, see? As fresh and sparkling as anything that ever hit Broadway. But, well, they don't know as much about song and dance as they think they do... ...so I want you to teach them. Show them how. Yeah? What do you say? - All right, Harry. - I knew you would. You run home and tell Florrie all about it. And listen... ...you and she are having dinner with me tonight, just like old times. Joe, by the way, there's somebody in the show that you know. Who? - Mickey. - Mickey. Now, now, now, don't get excited. Just keep cool. The kid is swell. No fooling, he's immense, but he needs you, Joe. He needs you more than anything in the world. All right, call your rehearsal. I'll make a trouper out of him. A real trouper. Give my love to Florrie. Gee, I didn't think you were gonna be able to make it. What a man. Thanks, Mr. Maddox. You see, Mickey, I've loved your father much longer than you have. I'm gonna make good for him too. - You'll make good for a lot of people. - Who? For the kids who never had a chance. For the kids a lot of wiseacres are telling... ...there is no such thing as an American dream. Well, those kids have got their eyes on you. Because you're being given your chance... ...and by the bones of Bacchus, you'd better make good. Gee, it's bigger than just a show. Say, it's everybody in the country. Look at that kid, will you?

Tonight's episode: The Thirty-Year Pin ( small classical ensemble playing ) Police. Police! Yeah. Thank you very much. Why didn't you press him? Nah. After all the favors you done for him, the least he could have done was answer a few questions. Well, maybe he didn't have the answers. He was waiting for you to press him. Some other time, when I really need him. Why is it everybody always owes you a favor and you never collect? Look, are you gonna talk or drive? DISPATCH ( over CB ): Unit 512, we have a 211-217. 2944 Columbus Avenue. See the man. Fifty-four rolling. Columbus Avenue. That's Charnovski's beat. The Charnovski, your old buddy? Uh-huh. Well, let me ask you something. When Charnovski was breaking you in, did...? Unit 12, Unit 44, proceed code three to 2944 Columbus. Two-seventeen-oh. Two-seventeen-oh? Somebody shot Gus. Come on, move it. He's a goner. Like hell! Now, you put him in that van, and get it in gear and move it! Come on. Come on. Come on, stand back. Let them get through, please. Stand back. Get him in. Listen to me. Get the robbery detail and have OIE report to me at the hospital. Pick up Stella Charnovski and bring her too. Mike, they said he's dead. He's alive. He's gotta be. Hold on, Gus. Hold on. If you're there, Gus, hold on. This is Mike, Gus. Now, you've got a hole in you. It's not small. But it's not big enough to stop an old harnessed bull like you. Gus. Gu... You're alive, Gus. You're in the trauma van. Yeah... We're rolling down Jefferson. We'll have you on that table in just three minutes. You hear me, Gus? And you give those fellas an extra five, and they'll fix you up as good as new. You know that, don't you? Stell's on her way, Gus. She's not gonna let you get out of that trip you promised her. Hang in there, fella. We're on the Embarcadero now. Gus. You're steamed, aren't you? Huh? You're steamed at that punk who shot you. Market. We just crossed Market, Gus. One more minute. You hear me, Gus? One more minute. And then you'll take a few days to recover. And I'll wheel you into that banquet room in a wheelchair. And then you'll pick up your 30-year pin sitting down. Bryant, Gus. Here we are at Bryant. Gus? Gus, it's your buddy. Stell's on her way, Gus. Potrero, Gus. We're here, Gus. Gus? Gus, we're here. You hear me? Here, doc. Outside, Mike. I stay. Sandy, give me a mask. Outside, Mike! Hold on, Gus. Hold on, Gus. You hear me? Now, let's move. This man's going under. Do you know Gus? Just through Mike. I gather they're pretty close though. To hear them tell it, they're brothers. You known Mike long? Since I became a detective about two years ago. They go back 30 years. They walked the Tenderloin together then. It's a rough part of town. They worked dogwatch six nights a week, and you couldn't keep them apart on the seventh. They do miracles with that trauma unit, Mrs. Charnovski. Really. Thank you. I just hope we won't need a miracle. Joe? Stone. Give me McCready. NURSE (over speaker ): Calling Dr. Westo. Dr. Westo. Mac? Stone. What have you got on Charnovski? What do you mean nothing? No, I won't take it easy. Have you got Gus' reports on your desk? NURSE: Dr. Marsden. Well, where are they? Huh... I know, but he knew every punk in his district. Who's he got heading this robbery detail? Yes, I... I told him to report to me at the hospital. I don't care if I'm overstepping my authority or not. I want some action! Well, he's alive. He's hanging by a thread, but... he's alive. I heard what you did. The... steward told me he was a sure DOA, but you kept him with us. Oh, that's a lot of baloney, and you know it. Whatever happens, happens in there. I thank you for it. Well, I think he heard you. Mrs. Charnovski? Yes. He's not in good shape, by any means. He has a hole in him, and... needs a lot of blood. Will he live? Well, he's... He's responding, but... I can't make any promises. Thank you. Excuse me. Oh, Mike. I'll make you a promise, Stell. No matter what happens... I'll get that punk who did it. Come on, sit down. Let me get you a chair. Take it easy. Relax. And if you need anything... Steve will get it for you. I'll be all right. Where's Devitt? He said he'd be here. When? As soon as he could. He's already had half an hour. Mike... Mike, he's... He's here. Hello, Mike. How is he? Not good. What have you got? Let's see. Well, the suspect is 5'10 "", 5'11"", weighed about 150, Caucasian, approximately 30 years old. Tan shirt, dark trousers, dark shoes. Entered the shop from the rear. Pulled a gun on the owner at approximately 4:40 p.m. Wore a stocking mask over his face. Took $324, cash drawer, and $110 on Beeman's person. Officer Gustave Charnovski entered the shop from the rear approximately 4:45. Suspect fired at the officer and then he fled. Beeman couldn't give us anymore. No jewelry taken? Well, then how did he get away? The... back door, the front door? Run? Walk? Vehicle? How? Still checking, Mike. I've only got two men. Well, no good, Roy. What do you mean, no good? You've got nothing. Come off it. Come off it? I'm coming on it. I'm taking this case. Wait a minute... This one's mine, Roy. And don't say it. Don't say a word. Don't say that I'm overstepping my authority. And don't say that you've done the best job you could so far, because you did nothing. A rookie cop could have gotten more information than that. Well, how much time do you think we have?! Let me tell you something, Roy. If this punk gets away, it's because you blew it. Where do you come off anyway? Somebody appoint you commissioner? If you don't like what I'm doing... Don't like it? That's right! If you don't like what I'm doing, then you just file a complaint. MAN: Who is it? Lieutenant Stone, Homicide. Open up. Can't it wait till tomorrow? I'm not a young man. And after what happened today... What happened today might have kept you from getting any older... if the best cop in the city hadn't laid his life on the line. I'll just be a minute. I told your Robbery people all I know. Where were you standing when that punk came in? Um... there. Uh, facing this way? Uh... Uh, no, uh... And he came in through the back? Uh, yes. And you heard nothing? Uh, sure I heard him. I, uh... Uh, turned around and, uh, there he was. And what did he say? Well, I, uh... I-I... I don't remember exactly. Oh, come on, think. Try. Well, I think he, uh... Uh... D... ""Don't move, and,"" uh, ""don't reach for anything."" Then? Uh, th-then he told me to, uh... Uh, pull down the blind and, uh, put up the closed sign. How did he talk? Huh? Did he have an accent or anything like that? Uh, uh... No. No. Okay. Then what? Uh, then... Then he told me to stand there. Where? Here? Uh... And then he took the money. Who opened the cash register? You or him? Oh, h-he did. How? Which finger? Which finger? Yeah. Which finger did he use to open the cash register? Uh, well, I-I... I... I think it was this one. Are you sure? Uh, I think so. Right-handed? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Because he shifted the gun to his left hand, uh, whi... While he took the money. The money that you had in your pocket, how did he get that? Well, he asked for it, and I gave it to him. How? I put it in his hand. Here, like this? Yeah. Then you were close to him? How about his breath? Could you smell it? Oh, I... I don't remember. I... Booze. Maybe beer. Tobacco? No. No, no, I don't... The mask. What about the mask? What color was it? I-I don't know. Now, you're a married man. You know about women's stockings. Now, what color was it? Black, white, tan, green, red? What? Oh... Tan. Light or dark? Uh... Uh, light. And what about the toe, and that, uh... That band around the top? How should I know? All right, all right. You say he was in a shirt? Yeah. Short or long sleeves? Uh, sleeves? Uh... Long. Shoes. Black or brown? Uh... Uh, brown. What kind? Lieutenant. Come on, now. What kind? Uh... Uh... Well, uh, new... Like, mod-like with, uh, brass buckles, uh... All right, there's more about the shoes. What? Yeah, the, uh... The toes seemed, uh... Go on, go on. Scuffed. Uh... Uh... And the only reason I noticed it, it was like my kid's shoes used to be. Good, good. Now... how about the brand? Um, uh, Italian maybe. Uh... Uh... Square-toe, like they, uh, show in the bootstrap shop. Anything else? His trousers, the pants. They were baggy in... In the knees. Uh... Not as expensive as the shoes. Uh-huh. Oh, I didn't realize I noticed so much. Yeah, now... Mm-hm? How did he walk? Like an athlete or a lead foot? Oh, uh... about average. And his attitude? Was he calm, cocky, uptight? What? Nervous. He shot Gus, didn't he? Yeah, yeah. Mustache? No. No, no. No mustache. Uh... Sideburns, uh, maybe. I think. Good. Good, Joseph. Come on, let's get you home. I hope I was of some help. How long ago did you get the Charnovski slug? Oh, hold. Just now. In 15 minutes, I want a make on that gun. Figures. I better go now. Yeah. Hey. Mike. We gotta talk. Okay. I'll run this through the computer. Fine. Now, listen... No, you're right, Roy. I was way out of line. But a policeman's been shot. A brother. And there's some born scum out there who's laughing about it right now. And I wanna see him nailed. Yeah, I understand. I just wanna make sure that... the law... stands by a man who spent his whole life trying to make it work. Well, okay. You call the shots. And I'll tell Malone. Thanks. I'll see you in Stats. You want some coffee? Just black. Wiley... the car. Someone spotted a blue '69 Ford Coupe leaving the scene. Now, get a make on every registered owner within a mile answering that description. Sharp, mug books to the jeweler's. At this hour of the night? He's awake. I just left him. Now, get the car witness and anybody else in the neighborhood who may have seen anything, and have them here at 8 a.m. looking at the mug books. Lessing. I want you to... check ballistics against gun sales. And, oh, yes. Pick up six more men. Recanvass the whole area. There must be more eyewitnesses. Right. Here. Thanks. What do you want me to do? Here, take this. Check the hospital. See how Gus is doing, will you? Oh, Mike. These cards just came through, so I've... punched up a couple dozen junkies, ex-cons, and all-around losers in the neighborhood. We're checking everything, Mike. Yeah, thanks. Mike! Are you all right? Mike, Gus is conscious. Take it easy, Mike. I held on, Mike. How you feeling? Uh. Hurts. Yeah. How much did he get? About 400 in cash. No jewelry. Hm. He was 5'10"". Light hair. Long. A tan shirt. Dark trousers. Dark shoes, scuffed at the toes. .38 Special. He was right-handed. Listen. I just wanted to make sure you weren't trying to walk out of here again. Now, you take it easy, you understand? We'll talk about this later. He has to live in the neighborhood, Mike. This was a seat-of-the-pants operation. A junkie? He didn't... feel like a junkie... but... why else? Why else would a guy rip off $400 in cash and not touch a case full of jewelry? Yeah. That's for my noodle. You got a trip to plan. Take it easy now. Yeah. Oh... Nurse. Oh. I'm sorry. Where have you been? I... I've been leaning on that bell for five minutes. Charnovski's hurting. Thank you. You're welcome. I'll see to him right away. My friend, you're blowing it. Are you trying to tell me something? Yes, I'm trying to tell you something. Somebody's got... Mike, how many times do you try to tell me that finding the truth's a head game? You gotta keep your fists in your pocket, your feelings out of the way. Come on, let's go. Look... Look, I'm with you. Anywhere, anytime. But I gotta know what you're doing. And what's more important, you gotta know what you're doing. Now, this isn't like you, Mike. I mean, you've always got a plan, some form of action. Well, if you got one now, let me know about it. Don't just send me off to run errands. You're a bright boy. Be bright enough to read me and stay out of my way on this one. You're gonna do this alone? Give me the keys. Oh, Mike, come on. Give me the keys! You can only find chicks like this at Coke's. You gotta see 'em to believe 'em. All right, honey, that's enough. Your timing's fantastic, fella. Show's just starting. You gotta see 'em to believe 'em, folks. You can't see 'em on the outside, you gotta go on the inside. Say, fella, your timing's fantastic. Suslow? Eddie Suslow? Lieutenant Stone. I gave at the office. How about going over to my car and talking this over? Some other time, okay, man...? How about that liquor-store holdup on 23rd and Folsom? Okay, okay. And the supermarket? I already told you guys all I know about that. Man, I get bounced from this gig, what's left? There was a robbery today. Jewelry store over by Ghirardelli. I want the man who did it. You got the wrong cat. I know. My man is 5'10"", sandy hair, sideburns, right-handed. He used a .38 to cut down a cop. Shot a cop? He can't be all bad. Okay. Take it easy. Now you know what's walking, running and crawling. You know who's hard up and who's holding on. I want you on the street with your ear to the pavement, and I want the name of that punk who pulled that trigger. You just call me every hour on the hour. Or what? You just be two minutes late. I'll show you ""or what."" Coke's is the place, folks. The home of the blue movies. You gotta see 'em to believe 'em. You can't see from the outside, you gotta step on the inside, folks. STONE: Jarvis. Police. What do you want with me? I'm clean. Where were you at 4:45 yesterday? Why? Because I'm asking. You're not asking. You're... Where? You got no right hassling me like this. Then what are you hiding? I told you, I'm clean. You'd starve to death trying to keep clean. Open the closet. What? Open it. I just wanna see your wardrobe. You wanna show me, right? Now, where were you at 4:45 yesterday? And you better have an airtight alibi. You can't take nothing. You got no right taking that. Give me that gun. Gun? I got no gun! Hold it! All right, over there. Come on, get over there! Come on. Hands down, feet apart. Get 'em apart! He's clean. He's got three counts of armed robbery, and that junk downstairs is a fresh buy. Bring him here. Come on. Go! Come here! Move. Mike. I say you pay for that with Gus' blood. Let him go, Mike. Let him go! Gus is all right. He's asking... He's asking for you. He's all right, Mike. If you had your radio on, you'd know. Been trying to get you for the last hour. Gus is a...? Yeah. He's...? I got him, Mike. I got him. All right. Put your hands behind your back. Get 'em behind your back! ( grunting ) I got him, Mike. Hold him for me. He's out of his skull, that guy... Let's go. He was gonna kill me, man! It was self-defense. I could just see it coming, you know? You got a fresh score, huh? I don't have to say nothing to you. What's with somebody getting killed? You're gonna try to pin that on me too? An officer was shot. Cop. Get up there. We'll see if you get off. You think I did it, huh? The lieutenant does. Well, he's wrong, man. I never killed nobody. He said something about a time. What time? Yesterday, 4:45. Man. Yeah, quarter to 5, I can prove where I was. I was with people. Good. Who? A bunch of guys. We were throwing dice. Where? At a bar over on Union, in a backroom. That near Ghirardelli? Yeah. That's where the guy got killed. Now, get up there. No, man, come on, I'm leveling. I never left that game, I swear. Well, you better hope you can get somebody else to swear... or you're in a lot of trouble. Come on. Hi, Mike. I hear he asked for me. Hey. Buddy. Gus. No one asked for me? No. I'll be back in a few minutes. But we're glad you're here. Give us a minute. Huh, Stell? Okay? Sure. You gotten anything? I think so. Good. I'm not gonna make it. Oh, come on now. What are you talking about? Truth. Truth, Mike, remember? What we spent our... whole lives looking for. I'm checking out. Naw. Listen, Gus, you're just tired. No. No. Help, Stella, huh? She... She thinks she can handle it, but she can't. Funny. You know, it... It... It makes me... feel easier some way... knowing... Help her, Mike. She's a good woman. Help her, huh? Mike? Oh, Gus, you... You... Oh, damn. Oh, what happened to the time, Gus? I... I have so much I wanna say. Yeah. This... This guy you got. You... sure he's the right one? Well, I'm gonna find out. Truth, Mike. Remember... Truth. That's the first thing you taught me, Gus. It's the last thing I wanna forget. Get Stell. Stell. Stell. Lieutenant Stone, we're holding a call at the desk. Thank you. Get Dr. Ford in there. Certainly. Yeah. Stone. KELLER: Mike. I think we got something. Jarvis? No, no. He can prove he didn't do it. But his proof turns up some names and maybe a motive. Now, when Gus got it, Jarvis was shooting craps at a dive on Union Street, five blocks away, with six, maybe eight guys, right? Now, get this. One of the guys was losing big, he taps out and splits. He comes back in less than half an hour with 400 bucks. What? That's right, $400. And the scuffed shoes... Remember those scuffed shoes? Maybe that explains it. A roller. He's on his knees, shooting. And the time fits, 4:30 to 5. What do you think? Guy's losing big early, needs more money, he takes off... Got a name? Yeah. Fisher. Cal Fisher. You know him. Mike? Yeah. I said you know him. You busted him once on an assault with a deadly weapon. So, what do you wanna do? You want me to wait for you here? Listen, I got his address. It's a boarding house on Mariposa. Just this side of the Slot. Mike? Yeah, sit tight. ( ominous melancholy theme playing ) KELLER: Sure. No, I understand. Right. Of course. As soon as he comes in, Mr. Suslow, I'll tell him. ( phone rings ) Right, okay. Thank you. Who's this, uh...? This Suslow? Some guy Mike pumped. And he must have done a heck of a job, because this guy sounds off like an alarm every hour on the hour. Anything? Nothing. What about that name Jarvis gave you? I gave it to Mike. Well, but where is Mike anyway? Don't know. He should be here by now. I called him at the hospital about 20 minutes ago. Gus Charnovski died about 20 minutes ago. Yeah. Mike ever talk about Gus? No. Good cop, Gus. Helped Mike Stone be a good cop too. What do you think it is makes a guy stay on the beat that many years? Well, beat's the best duty on the force. If you're big enough and strong enough, and smart enough to hack it. Charnovski hacked it. Yeah. Mike comes in, ask him to stick his head in, will you? I don't think he's gonna come here, Roy. Why? Well, you know how he's been acting, uh...? And I know how I'd feel if it was Mike they just put under a sheet. And I think I blew it, because I just gave him the name Jarvis told us about, the guy we're looking for. No, no. No, he's too experienced. He's not gonna get himself wasted. What's wasted if he cuts down a guy he should bring back alive? Maybe you'd better give me that address, and you get rolling. And I'll get backup. That one. MAN: Hello? Mr. Garland? Lieutenant Stone, San Francisco Police. Open the door, please. Get back in there. It's open. Who's there? Police, Mr. Fisher. ( suspenseful action theme playing ) Up there. Number five. They were shooting. But they're gone. Uh, down the back stairs to the alley. Evans, stay here. Ike. Get around. Take the alley. You come with built-in radar. I could hear you running. He's in here somewhere. We have the next couple exits sealed off. He's unarmed, Mike. STONE: Fisher! You just do that. Get up here. Cuff him! Let's go. How is she? Okay. That's gonna be tough. She grew up tough. Hey, what time you got? Quarter to 1. I'll blow us to a lunch. Go over to Mama's. I've got bread. Aren't you the guy who kept telling me to know when to call in my IOU's? Yeah. So, what have you got against a good clubhouse sandwich? Nothing. I just don't see you owing me anything, that's all. Maybe you're right. I ought to make you pay after that... con job you pulled on me. What are you talking about? Gus wanting to see me. Yeah. You did all right. You didn't lose your head. It's a good thing too. I guess I wasn't using mine much, was I? But you had a reason. Nah. I was way off base. Don't ever let me catch you off base that far. That's no way to operate. You know... there's one thing you've always gotta remember... Mike, if I let you buy me lunch, can I skip the lecture? Well, how are you ever gonna learn anything?

Sister, we're all aware of the book of revelations. You can twist those words to mean almost anything. Right here in Los Angeles, 15 people have been brutally murdered. All over the country, Cult killings are spreading. They're signs of his work. Sister, this is the 20th century. So one mustn't mention Satan in polite company. His power is growing. His power is growing. All of these bodies have been marked... Inverted pentagrams... his sign. We appreciate the intensity of your beliefs. But the last thing the church needs Is to stir up more sensationalism About devil worship. Otherwise, we may all end up on Geraldo. No, I believe it's best If you return to your convent, And in seclusion, meditate less on the devil And more on the virtues of our lord Jesus Christ. Especially the virtue of humility. Thank you. Yeah. I know where he's going next. Listen, lady... The marks are always exactly 6 inches in diameter. The wound is always at the center. Keep going. One condition... No killing And no death penalty either. Ok. Whatever you say. Swear it. You got it. What's your name? Near sunset boulevard. The south entrance to elysian park. When? Soon. Don't forget your promise, Logan. Sleeper? Nothing. Even a psycho fucking killer is smart enough To stay out of the rain. To stay out of the rain. How are my lovebirds doing? Hey, Carmen, How about a nightcap later? Dream on. It's too bad, Carmen. Watching your ass Is the only thing keeping me awake up here. 3-Lincoln-7. Franklin. All positions clear. See? 3 nights of this shit. Everybody's burned out. The broad on the phone is his girlfriend, Setting us up, ok? You know these serial freaks love mind games. Trust me. She wasn't his girlfriend. He'll show. That's all you've been saying for 3 days. ""He'll show."" You ought to put that to music. You know what your problem is, Ollie? All this mumbo-Jumbo occult bullshit's got you spooked. Shh... Guy's got you thinking he's the bogeyman Or the ku klux klan. Fuck you. That's ""fuck you, sir."" What the fuck? What the fuck? Pull it over. Is this a stakeout or a fucking parade? That what you call it? I call it a jerkoff. Russ, you asked for 72 hours. I gave 'em to you. Nothing happened. Look, I told you I didn't know when it was going down. But this location fits the pentagram pattern. My informant says This is where he's gonna strike next. I can't risk it anymore. It's too thin. I got 18 men sitting here, But he's liable to hit on the west side tonight. Hey, Russ. They lost Carmen. Park side, north of sunset. Park side, north of sunset. Jesus. Well, she's probably just taking a piss. Well, she's probably just taking a piss. Heaven in art, which father our... Shh. It's all right. I don't want you to be afraid. If you're afraid, I won't be able to help you. Pulled her into a car. Pulled her into a car. Nobody came down toward sunset. Up there's the entrance to the park. Park? Yeah. It's locked. We're just... Going to go through a very small door... Here. Here. Here. We're going to go through backwards. That's why I say the prayers in reverse. Heaven, in art which father our... Our father, which art in heaven. Do you understand? Do you understand? Take the road. Shh. Shh. It's all right. Piggy, piggy. Aah! Aah! Aah. Aah! Hyah! You son of a bitch! You motherfucker!

Good-Looking broad, nice threads, Doesn't look like a nut, Says she knows who did it, And she'll only talk to you, man. Let's give the lady what she wants. Detective Logan, miss... Detective Logan, miss... Seaton. Tess Seaton. I didn't want to come here, But I didn't know what else to do. Well, you did the right thing. Sit down, please. Why don't you tell me what you know About the officer's death. You seem frightened, miss Seaton. You really don't know, do you? You really don't know who killed her. Why don't you tell me? The pentagram killer. Patrick Channing, the pentagram killer. I don't have time to play games. Games? You talk about games? I saw you on TV Celebrating a man's execution Like it was a party. Bye-Bye, Patrick. Adios. Good riddance. Except he's back. You might have executed his body, But his spirit has been released. Oh, I see. His spirit. Yes, his spirit. And I am frightened. I am very frightened. Thanks for coming in to see me. Don't patronize me. I'm not some crackpot. I am a professional psychic. I helped the St. Louis police department Find a missing child... This isn't about a missing child, is it? No. It's murder. And it's not going to stop. You're not dealing with a man anymore. He's become a force. I promise you Ill do the best I can. You've already broken one promise to me. You promised no death penalty. You lied. That was you? It's certainly a pleasure to meet you, miss Seaton. I've been looking forward to this. Actually, I wanted to thank you. How well did you know Channing? I didn't. Then how did you know where he was going next? I try to stay away from police work, But when I saw the picture of the little girl he killed... But when I saw the picture of the little girl he killed... I opened myself up to him, And Ive never felt such blackness and rage. So you used your psychic powers To figure out where he was going next? I suppose that's also How you got my home phone number. I have a friend who works at the phone company. Look, I helped you, And you broke your promise to me. And now he's not just after you. He's after me, too. How do I reach you? You call me, Logan. Soon. So that's it? After all this time, She just walks in like that? Mazza, don't let her out of your sight. With pleasure. We're on a roll. They nailed Carmens killer. They just brought him in. You killed my friend, asshole, didn't you? Didn't you?! He's been like that since they found him In an alley across from the park. Had the murder weapon in his hands. Looks like a slam dunk. Who is he? No I.D. Just some junkie With tracks all over his legs. I don't know what this guy's vegged on, But he's ready for the salad bar. See you around, buddy boy. See you around, buddy boy. What did you say? I didn't say anything. You ok? Hey, Russ. Did that guy look Like he could kill anybody to you? Well, that's... Hey, maybe he did it and went into shock, man. Yeah. And Perkins loves you like a father. And just by coincidence Our little psychic shows up today... Bullshit. It's a setup, man. Let's go. Man, it wouldn't hurt if we had a warrant. We'll just tell the judge we had a psychic hunch. We'll just tell the judge we had a psychic hunch. Hey, kiss my black ass! Looks like the psychic business pays pretty well. Forget it. You wouldn't look good in a turban. Shit. I don't know. It's too bad the chick doesn't have a view. Hmm. Hmm. Ollie, Look at this. Look at this. It's got my name on it. It's your horoscope, man. Hey, you better look out, man. 'Cause she might have A voodoo love doll of you around, too. You looking for something? What? You've been following me the last 2 blocks. You're crazy, lady. Don't bother lying. It's all over your aura. My what? If you're lonely, Try computer dating, but leave me alone, Or Ill call the cops. My name is Andrea Gregg. Nancy Rosenberg says you're the most accurate psychic She's ever seen. I'd like to set up a private reading, please? My number is 555-0511. Uh, hi. It's Paul. I'm not going to come over Friday night. You're just too spooky for me, Somebody who knows what Im thinking before I do. I should have said this to your face, But I guess Im too chicken shit. Bye, Tess. Looks like the score is pentagram 16, LAPD 1. Nah. Not even 1, huh, Logan? How about a romantic rendezvous? Church across from lover street. Buenos dias, buddy boy. Church across from lover street. Buenos dias, buddy boy. Buenos dias,buddy boy. Come on in. We're gonna have a little chat. I don't believe this! You've been going through my things? Take a listen to this, Ollie. Those are private! You can't do that! I can do anything I damn well want. Somebody who knows what Im thinking before I do. I should have said this to your face, But I guess Im too chicken shit. Bye, Tess. It's the next one. What was it? He was on there. There were 3 messages on that machine. Machine says 2 messages. Maybe you erased one. No, I heard him! Who? Channing! I mean, somebody imitating his voice. Guess again, Logan. What if it was Channing? Listen to me. No more horseshit. No more goblins or tooth fairies. Tell me about your friends. What are you talking about? This yuppie psychic routine just doesn't cut it. I'm thinking you two were part of the same cult. I bet it was your cute little idea Leaving that zombie in the alley, Make it look like he killed Carmen, right? You found the killer? You surprised? No. Probably some poor soul that he possessed And then abandoned. Oh, yeah. Don't fuck with me! Let go! A woman's dead, and you're involved! Let go of me! Russ, cool out, man! Russell. You're in danger. Lady, he's not in danger. You are. Where are you taking me? Lover street. That's what the machine said. A romantic little rendezvous? Let's go. He's here. Channing. Great. Russ, excuse me. What are we doing down here, Russ? ""Church across from lover street,"" That's what the voice said. What voice? There was no voice on that machine. All right, so maybe I did erase it. I don't like the feeling of this. It's spooky. And the chick is spooky, you hear? What if she's on the level? Come on, Ollie. Give me a break. I'm serious, man. You see how she was looking at me? She said I was in danger. We just need to calm down. Let's check out the area. Let's check out the area. Come on. Aqui tenemos carne asada. Ayyyy! Logan, it's him! Aah! Ollie! Stay back! I saw him, Russ. It was him. Ollie. Ollie! Get an ambulance. Hey, watch it! Me and your friend will be right back. You're doing exactly what he wants you to do. Logan! Piggy. Hold it! You move, and you're dead. See you around, buddy boy. Where did he go? Who? The guy who just jumped off the roof. Jumped off the roof? What you been smoking? We could use some. All right, Russ. Let's try it again. All right, Russ. Let's try it again. What for? Because I want to know How a guy jumps off a 10-Story building, Waves at you, And then just walks away. And then just walks away. Where's my witness? Oh, you mean the woman Whose house you illegally entered, hmm? Who you then abducted And recklessly endangered the life of During a high-Speed auto pursuit? Her lawyer came and got her. You want to hear the size Of the lawsuit he was talking about? It's too bad about your suspect, Logan. Maybe he flew away... Like a little birdie. Tweet tweet. Look, Russ. Yeah. I know. Sir? Yeah. They got Mazza. They got Mazza. How'd they get him up there? Get him out of here. Get him out of here. Lieutenant grimes, I want you to take over the investigation immediately. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. God, I hope I am going nuts, al. 'Cause if Im not, Grimes isn't gonna do much good. Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. How long since your last confession, my son? It's been a long time. We had kind of a... Parting of the ways. Holy mother, the church, accepts all Who return penitent to its fold. I don't know if Im penitent, father. I don't know much of anything anymore. I thought I knew where things stood, but... Please go on. My dad was shot, And after that, I guess I just said ""forget it."" I mean, if there was a god, How could he take my dad, Who never did anything wrong in his whole life? My mother went crazy. She never stopped praying. She never stopped saying that my dad's death was... God's will. Look, father, Ive seen a lot of dead bodies, And when someone's dead, they're dead, right? Maybe I am going nuts, but I need some answers. What is your question, my son? Can the spirits of the dead return And take over the bodies of people still living? You mean possession? Yes. How can they be stopped? Before I answer your question, It is necessary That I ask you one of my own, my son. What is it, father? How's the stomach, buddy boy? Logan! Logan! Hey! Are you ok? Well, what about the bottle? Where's the priest who just came in here? Priest? I didn't see any priest. There it is! There it is! Pull over! There it is! Pull over! Logan! Logan! Channing. No, Logan! Tess! Tess! What the fuck? This is an emergency. Move! Look, Im not an anti-Cop type. You need help with some creep... Shut up! Aah! Aah! Oh! Aah! Call this number And ask for inspector Perkins. On second thought, Talk to lieutenant grimes. He'll take care of your damages Personally. Any time, officer. Look, miss Seaton... Tess. Tess. Right. I want to... You don't have to thank me. Would you quit finishing my sentences for me? Sorry. I forget sometimes. God, I could use a drink. God, I could use a drink. All right. Tell me again from the beginning. What the hell is going on here? I don't really know myself, Logan. All I know is that he's a spirit now, And except for mind games, Like making you see or hear things, A spirit can't really do anything In the physical world without a body. So Channing possesses bodies. She just got out of the hospital. Might want to put her back in there. Ok, he possesses bodies, But I saw him. I saw him. He wants you to see him. That's his game. He can reveal himself to you, Or he can hide. And what am I supposed to do? Look, I spend most of my time Telling people about their love life Or if their TV show's going to be renewed. I have heard of a woman, though. Maybe she could help us. Yes? Hi. We'd like to see sister marguerite, please. Sister marguerite doesn't see visitors. Could you tell her That it's a matter police business, sister? I'm afraid that will mean very little to her. Tell her it's a very important Spiritual matter. All right. Wait here. I'm surprised you didn't pull your gun on her. Thank you. Thank you. Sister marguerite, We need your help. An entity has returned and is killing. How did the entity die? Execution. Sister, What can you tell us about the first power? The church doesn't allow us to discuss that. Sister, I don't mean to be disrespectful, But I really don't care what the church feels. People are getting killed. Forget the first power. It's not to be played with. It's not to be played with. Sister marguerite? Come on. You heard the lady. She just can't cut it. So what's your next hot lead? You know, you're not doing so great yourself, Logan. Thing only thing Ive heard out of you so far Is that you need a drink. Would have done me more good Than seeing the flying nun. Fine. Pull over. What? I said pull over. I'm thirsty. Hi. 2 scotches. Doubles. Look, I don't know what you're trying to prove. What's the matter, Logan? I never heard of a cop Turning down a free drink. Should have told me These were the spirits you were looking for. Again. Maybe this time I could have it straight. That was straight, lady. Well, then, McGuire, You got a leak in your roof 'Cause this stuff's so watered down It tastes like a god damn Perrier. I ain't McGuire. Ill do it. You drink like a vice cop. That's seriously going to fuck with your vibes. You should slow down on that stuff. I'm trying to get through to you, Logan. I'm trying real hard, But you've got this shell around you. It even started in a place like this, Didn't it? Come on, Logan. Talk to me. It was 2 guys in ski masks, right, And your old man by himself, Closing up the bar? I don't need this shit from you. He died for no reason. That's when you stopped believing in anything. You've got to believe in something, And it can't be vengeance. Otherwise, you're just like Channing. Otherwise, you're just like Channing. You've gotta believe in this. You always talk this much? It's no wonder your boyfriend split. Wasn't my boyfriend. We just went out a few times. Amazing it lasted that long. Amazing it lasted that long. Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey! What? I was an asshole. I shouldn't have said that about your boyfriend. It's all right. It's all right. That's my problem. I can tell everybody else What to do with their life, But my life is a total wreck. We have to go to Channing's house. I know he's returned from the grave, But do you really think he's moved back in? Mrs. Channing... We're from the post. We really hate to bother you, But these new pentagram killings Could prove that Patrick wasn't guilty after all. We'd like to talk to you if we could. We'd like to talk to you if we could. All right. All right. Is it too dark in here? Light hurts my eyes. Cataracts. No, it's fine. Well, sit down. Well, sit down. What made you decide Patrick was innocent now? Why didn't you see the truth sooner? That's why we want to get the real story, Mrs. Channing. That's my husband Louis. He was a good man. He was a good man. The good always die young. Our daughter Sarah. She was Patricks mother. She died when he was 7. What about Patricks father? Patrick never knew his father. Oh, that's right. He was illegitimate. He was not illegitimate. He didn't mean anything. We loved him very much... Especially Louis. Oh, Im just talking on. Where was Patricks room? Why? We'd like to see another side of Patrick. I guess it would be all right. What could it hurt? I don't care what anybody says. He was a happy child. You tell them. Tell the world... What a good boy he was. A murderer? That's just nonsense. He was always so quiet and considerate. Oh, he came in here at night. Oh, he came in here at night. He was drunk. Mommy! No, grandpa, no! Grammy! Grammy, you have to make him stop! Help us! Patrick. What's he doing? Not me. It's not me. It's my mommy. Patrick, is he hurting her? Grandpa, don't touch her! I want you to leave now! You were there, weren't you? You saw it happen. You let it happen. I don't know what you're talking about. You let him molest his own daughter? Patrick never knew his father? I think he did. It was his grandfather, wasn't it? Wasn't it? Wasn't it? I know who you are. You're not a reporter. You're that cop! You're a killer! A killer! You're the real murderer! Eternal punishment will be yours! Burn in hell! Burn in hell! Tess! Tess? What's down there? What do you see? Hey! Hey, you! What the hell do you think you're doing? Homicide investigation. Get that out of my face. I don't care who the hell you are. Can't stay down here. It's unsafe. Why? What is this place? Part of the city's old water system. Got shut down After major earthquake damage in '71. Hey. Don't touch that. Those things still work. It'll come flooding in. Kid got drowned down here A couple of years ago. That's why these things were blocked off. Channing used to come down here, Didn't he? Hey, that was before me. Come on, you guys. We gotta leave. He's mad that we're here. This is his place. It's the only place he ever felt safe. He's...he's laughing at us. He's going to kill again and again. He's going to kill again and again. I never thought you'd go this far, Marguerite. People came to me for help. I turned them away. I can't do that anymore. But that doesn't excuse The theft of a sacred church icon. Is it theft to use this for its real purpose? I believe Satan has granted one of his disciples The first power. Resurrection? Marguerite. Marguerite. Marguerite. Ill pray for you. We have to hurry. I don't know who, But he's going to kill someone else close to you. Did you see where? It's an area I recognize. It's off the Santa Monica freeway. Attention, all units. Officer needs assistance. 2130 Julian, near alameda. Attention, all units. Only a few blocks from here. 3-Lincoln-43. I'm on it. Hold on. Stay here. Attention, all units. Officer needs assistance. 2130 Julian. You know which officer needs help, Don't you, sweet cakes? It's Logan. Aah! I thought I told you to stay in the car. Logan, he's here. Channing. I heard him on the radio. You what? Piggy, piggy. Over here. Over here. This way. Come on. Check it out, buddy boy. Logan? You're holding it upside down. You can't go on killing forever, Patrick. You want to bet? Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Hey, asshole. Are you trying to tell me That grimes tried to kill you? What do you think, al, I dragged him up there And dropped him on that spike for nothing? All right. Yeah, he was a drunk and a total prick, But he was also a lieutenant in the LAPD, And I do not believe... And I do not believe That he suddenly went fucking insane Or was secretly a member of some fucking cult. Sir, chief is here. Yeah, yeah! Ill be there. You gotta give me some more time, al. You gotta give me some more time, al. Ok, but get that fucking girl and get out of here, And you don't talk to anybody. You understand me? Go out the back way. Maid's day off. What are we gonna do? A buddy on the bomb squad Gave me this stuff for a rainy day. Channing can't do anything to us Without using somebody's body. So everyone he sends at us, We're gonna send right back. That's great. What are we gonna do, blow up the whole city? What do you want me to say? Tess, every time you kill the fucker, He bounces into somebody else! I'm sorry. What about grimes? How'd he get into him? You said grimes was an alcoholic. And people like that and junkies, They have less of a hold on reality, So they're vulnerable to him. Oh, terrific. That narrows it down to half of L.A. Logan, I don't know how to stop him. He...he just keeps getting stronger and stronger and... Oh, Logan, what are we doing? This is crazy. It's probably just my old refrigerator. It's probably just my old refrigerator. Russell! What? What is it? The bag lady, She was outside the window. Tess, there's nothing out... Aah! Aah! Don't you think I look pretty, Logan? Not nice to hit a lady. Whee! Hi, cutie. Oh, good. A game. Hide-And-Seek. I'm it. Ill count to 10. Where are we going, Logan? There's nowhere to go. Hi, Logan. Did ya miss me? Hi, Logan. Did ya miss me? Give me a kiss. Whee! Come on. Pucker up. Aah! Whoo-Ee! This is fun! Whee! Whoo-Hoo! Ooh, look! There's a big truck. Ooh, look! There's a big truck. Tess! Tess. Open up! You want to hide out from the rest of the world In this little rat hole, I don't give a damn. But he's taken Tess, and Im not leaving here Until you tell me how to find her. Until you tell me how to find her. You don't have any idea what you'll be facing. I don't care. If it's not too late, He will have taken her to the dark place Where he performed his rituals. I know where that is. Tess felt it. How do I stop him? It's not just stopping him. It's stopping a being who has the first power. There are 3 powers That can be bestowed by god or Satan. The third power is the ability To take over another person's body. Your friend the psychic has the second power, The gift of knowing the future. The first power is resurrection. Immortality. Look, sister, I don't understand these things. All I know is that I have to help her. There's just one way... Through the only soul in history Who had all 3 powers. Aah! Bitch! Ha ha ha. En nomini patri, et matri Et spiritus sancti. Are you all right, sister? Yes. Logan. Hurry. We have to get out of here. We have to hurry. He's still here. I feel it. Sister marguerite! Keep going. Sister. Take my hand. Gee, thanks, Russ. Gee, thanks, Russ. Let her go, Patrick. So soon? So soon? I just got here. Come out and face me, you son of a bitch. Don't hide behind her. Don't you know that cursing is a sin? You won't shoot a nun. You won't shoot a nun. Not a good little catholic boy like you. Sister. Oh, Im afraid she's not here. Keep fighting him, marguerite. You can beat him. Don't give up. Don't give up. He isn't powerful. He's just a scared little boy Who used to run and hide in the dark. You're pathetic, Logan. Tell me something, Patrick. It's just a wild guess... But I bet the first one you killed Was your grandfather. Or should I say your father? Shut up! You didn't know I knew that, Did you, Patrick? You had to watch him, didn't you? That was it. Shut up, Logan! You can beat him, marguerite. It's just you and me, buddy boy. It's just you and me, buddy boy. Aah! Aah! Logan! Aah! Aah! Aah! Time for your acid bath. Time for your acid bath. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Freeze! Drop the knife! Drop the knife! No. Please. Ohh! Aah! Aah! Russell. Please come back to me. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

Bring us some beer. You're looking like a million, baby. - Did you ever learn long division? - Never even learned short division. - And I'm doin' all right without it! - Ain't she a beaut? Hey, Bill. - Here are the fellas I was tellin' you about. - Hiya. - Did the other outfit show up yet? - Yeah. They just got thrown out. Just wait a minute. Say, boss. These boys play great. You oughta hear 'em. - Tim Dolan send 'em over? - No, I told 'em to come over. This one... This one here, his uncle's a cop. A friend of mine. Mind your own business from now on. You're paid to draw beer. - Are you beginners? - Yes, sir. - We've all gotta begin sometime. - We're pretty good, too. We've been rehearsing for weeks. Wait till you hear us. - Why aren't the others in uniform? - You see, I was dressed for a concert. Oh, we can hire 'em for you if you want 'em. Eh, you don't look so hot to me. But all right. I'll give you a try. - One piece. - Oh, thanks! - Thanks, Bill. - We're in! Ooh! - What's the matter? - The music. - What? - It's gone! - But you had it. - I must have left it on the streetcar. - You couldn't have done that. - What are we gonna do? - Well, are you guys gonna play or not? - Oh, sure. Here. Take this. It's music. - Brand-new. Just come from New York. - Music, you'd better be good. If they start throwing bottles at us, I'll meet you boys on the ferry. - All right, fellas. Just the chorus. - Hey, I don't get it. (# tentatively attempts ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' melody) What kind of time is this? Four quarter. Every bar a quarter rest. It's crazy. Come on! That's it, boys. Swing into it. My music! The dirty crooks. - What's the idea of swiping my music? - I beg your pardon? Don't pull any of that ''pardon'' stuff on me. You in that monkey suit. The minute my back was turned, trying to set yourself in here with my stuff, huh? All right, kids. That's dynamite. You're in. - Who's in? - All of you. Say, don't hook me up with this outfit. I came here to get a job for myself, not for this bunch. It was my music and my singing that put them over. - Yeah, but listen... - They don't know to play. They're rotten. Oh, and I suppose just because you can stand up here and shout, that you know everything about music, huh? Fight it out among yourselves, but it's all of you or nothing. Beer on the house for Mr. Alexander and his Ragtime Band. - My name is not Alexander. - It's Alexander to me. Come on with that beer. - So I don't know music, huh? - No. Well, maybe I don't know the tripe they play up on Snob Hill, but I know what they like down here and that's more than you'll ever know. And if you think that I'm gonna work with you, you've got another guess coming. Oh, what made you think that I'd want you with my band? Your band?! - Oh, give me my music... - Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. This is a situation. Let's try and figure it out. Oh, I've got it all figured out. And I don't want any more to do with you. Is that plain, fancy-pants? - Always a pleasure to meet a lady. - You bet it is. - Say, you were good. - I know it. - Let her go. - Girlie! Gee, look at what you've done. Everything's going along swell and you have to start an argument with her. - That girl's a whiz. Wait a minute. Let's be reasonable. Reasonable? Say, what do you think I am? A half-wit or something? Don't pay attention to him. He didn't mean it. He was just shooting off his mouth. Come on back. Let's pretend it didn't happen. We all need the job. Oh, say, I wouldn't go back there if it was the last job on earth. I've seen all I want of that stuck-up pain in the neck. - Yeah, but look... - Let go of me. There he goes again, playing my music. Opening tonight, Alexander's Ragtime Band! The hottest music on the coast! And the queen of ragtime, Stella Kirby! With the finest fish dinner in town! Opening tonight, Alexander's Ragtime Band! Not bad, boys. These openings tie me up in knots. I'm shaking like a coochie dancer. You call this an opening? You should have seen the outfit I was with the night we opened at the Crystal Palace. That was an opening. Hello, Martha? It's Roger. Listen, I've got to talk to Aunt Sophie. I'll try. Will you hold the phone, please? It's Roger again. I have nothing to say to him. I'm very sorry, Roger. She won't talk to you. All right. Thank you, Martha. Good night. Alexander! - You, Alexander! - Yes? Thank you. Professor Heinrich! - So your name's Alexander now? - Yes, that's right. Uh, won't you come in and... sit down and have a glass of beer? Not tonight. I just want to know if you're really serious about all this. Oh, yes. Very. But Roger, you spent your whole life preparing yourself for something fine. How can you throw it all away on this... this ragtime? But I like ragtime. I believe in it. And besides, I have what I've always wanted: A band. Won't you stay and listen? See for yourself. No. You know your own mind. You always have. - Good night. - Good night, Professor. Hey, come on, come on! Let's have a little life around here. - Bring on that girl. - Right away. - Who is it? - It's me. - What do you want? - I want to see how you look. Oh, I look swell. - Do you mind if I see for myself? - No, come on in. What do I care? It cost me my last dime. - Very nice. - Oh, thanks, Mr. Astorbilt. But you know, you shouldn't try to cover up your lovely throat with those feathers. - Hey, wait a minute. - Oh, and look at those flowers. You don't really need those. That's just gilding the lily. Oh-oh. And look at those ruffles. Now, that might be all right for some skinny little girl, but not for a girl with a gorgeous figure like yours. - There. Now, see what I mean? - Hey, wait a minute! Oh, and the very idea of trying to cover up that beautiful hair! - There, now. - Why, you two-by-four snob! Look what you've done. You've ruined my dress. Now, listen to me. You're not dressing for your sailor friends now. This isn't Dirty Eddie's. I'm trying to build a band with class and distinction, and I'm beginning right now. Oh, so you're a know-it-all about women's clothes too? Well, let me tell you something. I know how to dress myself and you or nobody else is gonna tell me what to wear. Understand?! You're not going up there looking like a comic valentine. And stop shouting! I'll go out the way I want to or I won't go out at all! - All right! That suits me too. - Well, it's good enough for me. Pickleface is throwing a fit out there. We'd better hop to it. - Are you ready, Stella? - I'm not going. - Oh, now, Stella... - Oh, let her go, and good riddance. I don't want a woman with the band anyway. Come on, Charlie. Oh, what a sap I was to let you talk me into this thing in the first place. Oh, I knew how it would end with that conceited... Well, I'm surprised at you, letting him get your goat. He didn't mean anything by it. He was just a little excited tonight - new place, a couple of new boys. - You can't let us down now. - There you go, sticking up for him again. Why, look where he threw my flowers. I should have slapped his ears down. You can do that tomorrow. You've gotta sing now. Pulling out my feathers, and giving me all that baloney about my neck and my figure and my hair. - Why, I'll see him dead first. - You're absolutely right. Don't sing for him. Sing for me. Why, you dirty dog. Taking advantage of my sweet nature, huh? That's a girl, Stella. Just remember the Three Musketeers. All for one... Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck. Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck. Three Musketeers, my... my foot. Ah! There you are, my tender little dove. We were just coming to call on you. - Well, I'm in a hurry. - Stop being a stubborn, ornery female. You and the maestro are gonna get acquainted. Say, I know all I wanna know about him. And no back talk. Get in there, the both of you. Take those chips off your shoulders. You're both all right if you don't expect too much. And remember, I'm staying right outside the door here, and if I hear any yelling or screaming, I'm coming back in here and knock your heads together. Well? You and I have entirely different points of view, Stella. But we are grown-up. I don't see why, with a little common sense, we can't work together. A simple business arrangement. Listen. You're out to set the world on fire. You're all hopped up with the idea that you've got something to give and you're gonna do it or bust. Well, that's your business. All I want is a job, and one job's as good as another. As long as I can pay my own way, and you leave me alone. You have a great voice. And a great future too. If you'd only realize your possibilities and try to make something of them. Say, I'm doin' all right. I am what I am, and I'm not gonna let you make me over into something else just to fit your plans. I guess I have been unreasonable, only seeing my side of it. But all this means so much to me. This music, having my own band. Whether we like it or not, we're together. We couldn't have gotten this job without you, and you probably couldn't have gotten it without us. So doesn't it seem sensible that we should try to meet each other halfway? Well, it's all right with me. Well, now! You see how easy it is. Something tells me I'm sticking my head in a noose. Come on! - Good afternoon, Miss Kirby. - Good morning. Good afternoon, Miss Kirby. Good afternoon. Oh, hello. My, you look pretty. Another new outfit? Mm-hm. But I think it's a little too loud. It makes me feel like a stop sign. I wonder if you realize how much you've changed in the last few months? What do you mean, ''changed''? Just because I pay more for my clothes and let my hair go natural? - Well, that may be part of it. Oh, you mean I'm getting to be a lady. More refined and agreeable. You're wrong. I'm just doing it to save myself a lot of arguments. Oh, sure. You're the same stubborn witch. You wear these good-Iooking clothes just for business reasons. It burns you up to get prettier every day. It'd just about break your heart if anybody told you you were blossoming into the most beautiful, - the most charming... - Why, I'd call him a liar to his teeth. What's that? Just a little hit tune I've been working on. - You mean you wrote it yourself? - Mm-hm. - Do you like it? - Like it? - Why, it's great! It's got everything. - Oh, take it easy. No, on the level. Imagine you having that in you. Why, it'll make you famous. I wrote it for you, Stella. If it's any good, that's why. Oh, thank you, Charlie. I'd love to sing it. Has, uh... His Highness heard it yet? Nobody's heard it... but you. Well, say, this is too good to keep. - Come on. - Wait a minute. Stella. Oh, come on. What would the waiters think? All right, fellas. Let's try that introduction now without the brass. Alec! Alec, look. Charlie's just written a swell new song for me. What? Holding out on me, huh? Oh, it's nothing. Probably won't sell more than two million copies. - Well, let's hear it. - All right. - Late again, huh? - Who, me? I was on the ferryboat... Now listen to me. And this goes for all of you. When I say 2:00, I mean 2:00. These rehearsals are just twice as important as any performance. We may be tops in this town, but we haven't even started yet. Now, if you fellas wanna stick with me, try to get somewhere, like New York, you're going to have to work. Now, come on, let's snap into it. Don't forget that this is an opening night. You've gotta be better than just good. Cut that. - Go ahead, Charlie. - (plays ''Now It Can Be Told'') Start over again from the beginning, Charlie. Louie. Bill. Take the melody. You take the counterpoint. All right, fellas. Let's fake it till we get our orchestrations. Take over for me, Charlie. Imagine, you and me like this. Imagine. - What happened? - Don't ask me. The roof fell in on us. The minute I started to sing that song... The whole world stopped for me. I'm afraid I even forgot to take a bow. Let me look at you... for the first time. That's for tonight. And that's for all the times I've wanted to break your neck. And that's for all the times I've wanted to slap your ears down. Do you suppose we've been in love with each other all this time? Me? In love with that awful person with the platinum hair and the loud mouth? Heaven forbid! Say, you were no Christmas package yourself, you know. Oh, darling. Don't you understand? I'm an artist. - Like Pygmalion. - Like who? Oh, just a Greek who took a hunk of marble and molded it and polished it into a beautiful woman. Then fell in love with her. Then you mean that you've just fallen in love with your... with your... - Handiwork. - Oh, that isn't so. You loved me from the first day you saw me. Platinum hair, loud mouth and everything. I guess you're right. This is the real thing, isn't it? It's the realest thing that ever happened to me. - Don't say a word. - What? - Hello, Charlie. - Don't apologize, don't explain. I know all about it. I was there when it happened. I pour out my heart in a song to some dame. She takes the song and pours out her heart to the boss. Well, I told you it was a good song. If you hadn't written it, the little lady and I would have probably gone on through life slugging each other. - Well, when's the wedding? - Don't be so practical. He's just started courting me. There, go buy me some flowers. The long-stemmed ones that cost $20 a dozen. - The kind I've never had. - I will not. Next you'll be wanting a Kodak, and then a leopard coat, and then a tin lizzie. - You'll get ham and eggs, and like it! - Ham and eggs and champagne. - Champagne for breakfast? - Certainly. This is a champagne breakfast. - Good morning. Three? - Please. This way, please. And while we're guzzling it, we'll have to do a little figuring. - You know who's in town? - No, who? Charles Dillingham. The big boy himself. Alec, this is the break you've been waiting for. Yes, sir. - Bring me a phone, please. - At once. This is Mr. Dillingham's secretary. Who's calling, please? I'm sorry. Mr. Dillingham is busy. No, he's not granting any interviews. But this is a very important matter. My name is Alexander. I have a very fine band, and I'm sure Mr. Dillingham would be interested in... Hello? Hello? Well, that doesn't seem to be the proper approach. Why don't we go down to the hotel, grease a few palms? Get everybody talking about Alexander's Ragtime Band: The elevator boy, the chambermaid, the barber. Din it in his ears. Oh, but that would only make him suspicious. I'm gonna get him to the Cliff House if I have to drag him. You know, those big guys all like to eat. Give me that phone. Stella, you're marvelous. Uh, Evergreen 2435. I was reading an interview of his in The Post last week. Uh, hello. Uh... Mr. Dillingham's suite, please. But you won't be able to get through the secretary. I got an idea.  Hello, may I speak to Mr. Dillingham, please. Well, then, will you tell him this is Henri? Henri! I was for many years the chef at the Astor House. I used to cook Pompereau Henri special for Mr. Dillingham. I read he's in town and I would like to fix for him some baby lobsters  la Henri. - Baby lobsters? - What's that? Oh, a chef named Henri wants to cook some baby lobsters for you. He was formerly at the Astor. Baby lobsters in August? Must be first of the season. Splendid. Find out where he is. Where am I? Where would I be? Chef at the Cliff House, of course. Then I can expect him tonight? Oh, thank you very much! Kiss Papa. Hey, wait a minute. I'm the guy that did it. Hey, Davey. - What did you say? - I'll lay you ten to one he doesn't show up. Yeah? You got yourself a bet, brother. And no welshing. You welsher. Hey, boss, how about me doing my number for the old boy? - That'll land us all on Broadway. - Yeah. Sitting right on our curbstones. Come on, let's give 'em everything you got. The clowning can come later. It's nerves, maestro. We're about to be discovered. - Oh, teacher, will I be discovered? - Yes, right now. The number 11, boys. - Oh, but Mr. Dillingham ain't here yet. - That's the idea. Or that was the idea. Oh, let it ride. I've been double-crossed before. - What are you doing here? - Listen, Ruby. Quick, lend me ten bucks. What did you do with that ten I gave you last night? Oh, hurry up, hurry up. Come on. I'll pay you back. I'd think you'd be ashamed, taking my hard-earned money to lose in a crap game. Say, you oughta be glad to lend me ten bucks! Suppose war is declared and I gotta go to the front and get killed in action? You'd be very happy to know that you were the one who lent me ten bucks when I needed it most. Stop. You're breaking my heart. Look, look! Dillingham! - Oh, boy. - Oh. - Good evening, Mr. Dillingham. - Good evening. - You won't need a check. - Thank you. - Must be... - He's here! He's here! The gray-haired man. - Alex, let's do the new one. - How about me? I'll slay him. - Get Stella to come out. - Ah, Stella. Frank. Frank! - Check on those baby lobsters right away. - Yes, sir. - And don't forget that whistle trick. - You got it. - Any special wine, Mr. Dillingham? - I'll leave it all to Henri. - He knows what I like. - Yes, sir. (# ''When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam''') Pardon me. Won't you join me? Oh, thank you, but I'm not allowed to sit with the guests. Well, I'm Charles Dillingham. - Mr. Dillingham, the theatrical producer? - Yes. Oh, well, I really shouldn't, but... I'm sure Mr. Alexander won't mind this time. - I'm sure he won't. - Thank you. - He's rising for the bait. - Leave it to Stella. - She'll have him eating out of her hand. Look. Champagne. - Won't be long now. - Yeah, she'll be in his lap any minute. Another crack like that and I'll throw you right out that door. If he's talking business, why isn't he talking to you? Or is she managing the band now? Alex will be there when the time comes. Come on. All right. Come on. Let's hit it. Don't let him think we're too anxious. - You'll like New York. - Oh, I know I will. Henri, your chef, is a great friend of mine. No food like his in the world. He's cooked me some baby lobsters. Won't you share them with me? Oh, no, thank you. Thank you. Mm! Superb. My compliments to Henri. Thank you, sir. He'll be pleased, I'm sure. Oh, I'm sorry, I must be going. I've got to tell Mr. Alexander. Excuse me, please. Take over for me, Charlie. - What did he say? - He wants me to go to New York! - What did he say? - He wants me to go to New York! - New York? He's gonna make me a star. Oh, darling, isn't that the most wonderful thing you ever heard? - Everything you've wanted for me. - What about the band? He says he can't use the band right now but I know he'll find a place for you later. Oh, isn't it marvelous? I can't believe it's true. - Pinch me. Then you really are going? Of course. This is the biggest chance I'll ever get. Oh, that's swell for you, Stella. She might at least have talked to me about it first. Not just go and say yes without even thinking about us. Oh, but Alex, this isn't going to make any difference with us. We can still be together. You can come on to New York with me and I know Dillingham will find a place for you before long. Oh, yeah. That'd just be great. But you told me over and over again that I could make something of myself if I tried. And now that it's happened, you're all burned up. I should have known better than to expect anything from you. Oh, Alec! Well, of all the selfish little tinhorn sports. You're jealous because he wants me and not you. - Now, Stella... - Well, just remember, I didn't want to go with your band in the first place. And all that polishing and molding - you weren't doing that for me. You were doing that for yourself, just because you thought it would help you get ahead. And now that it's backfired and helped me, you're yelling murder. - All right. Go on. Get out! - Alex... - Go to New York! Go with him! - Don't think you wouldn't do the same... Stella! Alec! Don't leave her like that. Go back and tell her you're wrong before it's too late. Siding in with her again, hey? I'm wrong and she's right. Sure. You don't own Stella. You can't order her around. She has a right to decide for herself. She doesn't owe this band a thing. We're liable to be stuck here for the rest of our lives. - Is that the way you feel about it? - Exactly. Well, then what are you sticking around for? Why don't you clear out, too? That's a good idea. Well, maestro, when does Alexander's Ragtime Band hit Broadway? There isn't any Alexander's Ragtime Band. What? Left... turn. Left... turn. Platoon halt! Just what did you do before you joined up in this man's army? - I was an orchestra leader, sir. - Yeah, I was a drummer. We had a swell... About face. Left turn. There ought to be such a thing as being too proud to knit. - Boy, I'm dying. - I'm dead. - What'd happen if we resigned? - We'd get shot. It'd be a pleasure. Of course, if we'd have been smart enough to get in the Navy... - Listen to this. ''Boom Boom a sellout.'' - What's Boom Boom? That's a show the Navy's putting on in New York. Pretty soft for those swabs. No more guard duty, no more bayonet drill. No more sore feet. Why didn't we go in the Navy? - A show in New York? - Yeah. Let me see that. Theatricals? You're crazy. - I told them it was no use. - Ridiculous, I said. I said this wasn't the theater. They're in the Army now. - But the Navy did it, sir. - The Navy. - They have time for such tomfoolery. - Besides, they have the talent. Talent in the Navy? Nonsense! If you can find talent in the Navy, you can find it anywhere. Right here in this camp. All right. Go ahead. Thank you, sir. (# ''I Can Always Find a Little Sunshine in the YMCA'') - Everybody on stage. - Everybody on stage. On stage, you fellas. - Come on, you! - On stage, everybody! If the Navy show can run a week on Broadway, we can run a month. And we'll do it. Our train leaves tomorrow at 6 am, for New York. Attention! - Colonel Roberts. - At ease, men. At ease. Give me a hand. Now remember, men, when you go on that stage in New York City on Sunday night, the honor of the Army will be at stake. So give it to 'em, boys. Give 'em everything you've got. Let's go over the top and beat the pants off the Navy! Three cheers for the Army! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Army! Come on, fellas! You greaseballs. - Come on, you hobnail heroes! Come on, get out of there! - Wake up, sleeping beauty! - Rise and shine! - Yeah, I'll go, I'll go. - Hit the deck! Everybody outside! (# ''Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning'') - How about a cigarette? - Righto, Colonel. - Get Captain Davis. - Yes, sir. Oh, but I've got to see him. I tell you, it's terribly important. Well, I'll tell him you're here. Will you wait out there? Sergeant, there's a Miss Kirby at the stage door to see you. - Who? - Miss Stella Kirby. Tell her I'm busy. - Sergeant Alexander! - Yes, sir? Assemble your entire company on stage immediately. - Yes, sir. Corporal! Everybody on stage. - Everybody on stage! Everybody on stage! Everybody on stage! - Get out of here. - We're not in this act. You think you ain't. You're in the Army now. I said everybody on stage, and right now. - Everybody on stage, tout de suite. - Aw, get out. We got 15 minutes. I said tout de suite. And them's orders... sister. I wonder what this is all about? Men, we cut the first and second scenes out of the last act. Go right into the finale. Now, there's a change of business, too. Instead of going down the side aisles and coming back to center, boarding the transport on the stage as we rehearsed it, at the beginning of the second verse, we march down the center aisle in a column of twos. Keep right on going to the trucks outside that are waiting to transport us to the docks. All you men will report to your respective organizations on boarding ship. Strike this set. Get ready for the finale. - I know it, I know it. We're going overseas. - Overseas? I can't go now. I'm coming up for exemption next week. Well, you just write a nice, long letter to Uncle Sam and tell him all about it. Oh, shut up. - This is certainly a long intermission. - Yes, I wonder what's delaying the show? Program says eight minutes. More like half an hour. - Attention! - Maybe that's it now. - So long, boys. I'll see you later. - So long. Forward... right! - Goodbye! We're going to France. - No! Alex! Alex! - Alex! All right, folks. That's all until tomorrow morning at 8:00. Clear the stage. Everybody except Miss Kirby, clear the stage. All right, boys. You can get your picture now. Please give the boys a picture. How about leaning against the piano, Miss Kirby? All right boys, set 'em up. Miss Kirby. All right, boys. - Thank you, Miss Kirby. - You're welcome. - Has anyone a cigarette? - Will you try one of mine? - Alex! - Hello, Stella. - Well, where in the world... - I saw your name out front. Thought I'd just drop in and say hello. When did you get back? Oh, a couple of days ago. - Are you all right? - Sure, sure. - Did you get up to the front? - Oh, off and on. But you... you didn't get hit? Oh, this? No, no. Just a fad I picked up on the other side. Without my stick, I'd feel completely undressed. No, no. I didn't get a scratch. Oh, it was all so horrible and useless, wasn't it? Not altogether. It did me a lot of good. Made me see what a stupid ass I've been. Kicked my silly little world right out from under me. - Will you forgive me, Stella? - Why, of course, Alec. - I've never stopped loving you. - Alec. Come on. Let's get out of here. I can't just stand here talking to you. I've gotta kiss you, I've gotta put my arms around you. Alec, please. You don't know what it's been like, wanting you every second. You've never been out of my mind, ever. I don't care what's happened before, and neither do you. We belong to each other. - But... don't you know? - Know what? Well, Charlie and I have been married for more than a year. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you knew. No, I... I didn't know. Stella! Down here, Charlie. - Mr. Dillingham... - Here's Alec. Alec! Hello, Charlie. - How are you? - Fine. Say, you fellas put on a great show over there. Yeah, that's what the Kaiser thinks. I got as far as Hoboken and they called the whole thing off. Yeah. I see you've done the songs for Stella's new show. - Congratulations. - Oh, thanks, but... blame it on Stella. She cracked the whip. It's been great seeing you two again. - Well, can't you have lunch with us? - No, sorry. I, uh... - I got two fellas waiting out front for me. - Oh. - Well, goodbye. - So long. Goodbye. - Well, he hasn't changed much, has he? - No. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. What did you say Mr. Dillingham wanted? Boy, have I been busy. I got ahold of Jim and Dirk and Reagan and the others. We're all set for rehearsal. We can use the sample room in the basement, but that's not the half of it. Wait till you see the surprise I got for you. Uh, Jerry! Hit it, babe. - What a pair of pipes. - Jerry Allen's the name. How do you do? - Wait till you hear her put over a song. - It'll probably knock you out. It did all the agents. Out every time I called. - Sit down, Jerry. - Thank you. Well, we're practically set. Alexander's Ragtime Band back in the running. - Bigger and better than ever. - What's all the hurry? What do you mean, what's the hurry? We gotta get jobs. - Why? - Well, we've gotta eat. - Why? - Well... What? Say, what is this? Listen, the bankroll is getting thin. Time enough to worry about that when it's all gone. Here. Ice? Here, drink this. - Are you crazy? - Yes. - Do you mind? - Certainly not. I'm a little cracked myself. Oh, there you are. You see, she understands. She knows that we heroes have to have a little time to adjust ourselves. A lot has happened while we've been making the world safe for democracy. Oh, cut it. You know very well those guys won't sit down and wait for you to get in the mood. They'll get other jobs. Then where'll we be? I'll bite. Where will we be? Nope, nothing doing. - Sorry, Jerry, no jobs today. - Well, that's all right with me. I'll always compromise for a good steak. Boy, didn't I tell you that Jerry could put over a song? That's right. Well, anyway, it's swell music. It sure has changed, though. It's got a new rhythm. - Nice and slow. - Yeah, like syrup. - And it's sweet and sticky. - What do you do with a guy like that? Oh, just relax and put your mind on your drinking. Stop trying to maneuver him into talking business. Business? What's that? You know, the thing you do to take your mind off your drinking. - Come on, Alex. Doesn't that adjust you? - Sorry. - Would a dance adjust you? - Sorry. Don't mention it. Good evening, Mr. Dwyer. Mrs. Dwyer. - Isn't that Bill? - Looks like him. - Bill! - Bill! - My goodness! And he's a father! - What do you know about this! Say, what are you doing in New York? - And out with a baby this time of night. - Oh, nothing. Say, how are you folks getting along? You look fine. Well, the same to you, Bill. Let's have a look at him. - Might be a her. - Oh, not Bill. - He wouldn't have any feminine offspring. - I don't think it's much to look at. ''It''? Why, I bet she looks just like her... Oh, why, Bill, it's the image of you! - How old is it? - Well, there ain't no way of telling that. - Imported? - Yeah. All the way from Hoboken. Right off the boat. Probably scraped off. You folks have sure been doing fine, haven't you? I caught your show, Stella. You've come a long way. Right up on top. - And your music's all right, too. - Thanks, Bill. Don't forget, Bill. You had a hand in all this, way back in the beginning. Say, it's funny, ain't it. You and Charlie over on Broadway and me and Alec down in Greenwich Village. - Alec in the Village? - Sure! Him and Davey. They got a swell band down at Scarbi's. I got 'em the job. Run across them once when they was broke. Come on down sometime when you think about it. Ask for me. I'm there every night. ''Bill Mulligan, interior decorator.'' - My nom de plume. Anytime you feel like you'd like to play with the baby, just give me a call. - I can be over in about 15 minutes. - All right, Bill. - We certainly will. Well, goodbye. - Goodbye. - Been grand seeing you, Bill. - Likewise. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Imagine Bill in New York. And bootlegging. He's probably making plenty of money at it. It's kinda funny at that. Him and Alec and Davey together again, down in the Village. I thought they were going back to San Francisco. So did I. What do you say we drop down and see them sometime, just for old times' sake? Oh, I'd rather not. Those old times are over and... there's no use trying to rake them up again. It never works. Would you like a highball? No, just some milk. All right, I'll get it. Here you are. Oh, this is fine. Make me sleep like a baby. So will this, if you drink enough of it. Tired? - I'm all right. - Come on, Charlie. What is it? Well... I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. Making up a lot of pretty speeches about marriage, life and fate. Very profound stuff. But it all seems kinda silly now that I'm sitting here talking to you like this. Somehow doesn't go with you. You're too honest and direct. Come on. Out with it. All right. Here goes. What do you say we call this marriage off? - Charlie! - Mark it up as... experience. A grand adventure while it lasted. But let's not spoil it by beginning to pretend a lot of things we don't feel. You're still in love with Alec, aren't you? Oh, I suppose so. I thought I was over it, but... Oh, I don't know. I guess you can't turn those things off and on. No. Course not. That's what I'm getting at. - Oh, but Charlie... - No buts about it. I'm a lucky guy to have had you as long as I have. I'm grateful for every minute of it. But I want you to be happy. Now, now, now, now. Don't go feminine all of a sudden. Just keep your mind clear. Go get a nice, quick, cheap divorce. I'll make the alimony light on you. And if you need any witnesses, I can arrange that, too. And you two hotheads can pick up where you left off. You haven't left me with a word to say. That's good. People talk too much anyhow. Now will you change your mind about that highball? Yes, I will. And a great, big one. - Hey, Stella! - Bill! What do you know about this? I've been wishing you would show up. This makes it unanimous. - Hey, you look positively handsome. - I'm dressed up for the party. - Party? - Sure. Come on! - Stella! - Davey! Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Boy, are you terrific! You look like you were born on Fifth Avenue. You look pretty swell yourself. How've you been, anyhow? Never better. And where's that old son of a gun Charlie? - I ain't seen him in years and years. - He's out of town. Oh, that's a shame. He's the only one of the old gang that's not here. Well, come on! This calls for a drink. Attention, everybody! Our own personal gift to Broadway, Stella Kirby. It's like old home week, isn't it, maestro? Just in time for the celebration. Won't you sit down? - Uh, Miss Allen, Mrs. Dwyer. - How do you do? - How's Charlie, Stella? - Oh, fine, thanks. That's good. - Stella Kirby! - Hello, Stella. - Oh, don't you look elegant! - Oh, thanks, Ruby. Yeah, Stell, she hooked me at last. I like that! After the way you ran after me begging me to marry you! - You two are married? - Uh-huh! Ah, that's what the celebration was for! Oh, congratulations. That's not the only thing we're celebrating. We're all leaving for Europe tonight. We're going to Paris and London and everywhere. Yeah, we're just getting ready to get poured on the boat. - You're leaving for Europe? - Yep. One of those horseshoes finally hit us and we landed a contract. Oh, that's wonderful. But it's rather sudden, isn't it? Well, they needed an American jazz band in a hurry, and we were just lucky. Oh, lucky nothing! Why, he's got the hottest band in town. And you should hear her sing. - You're with the band? - Yes, I am. - She took your place. Didn't she, Alec? - Oh, Jerry's great. One of the best. Yeah, we wanted to make it a double wedding yesterday, but Alec was too busy seeing about passports. Weren't you, Alec? We almost called the trip off after we got a look at our passport pictures. The boys look like gangsters and I look like a washed-out moll. Say, a couple of friends of mine from the press want you to give 'em a story about Alexander's Ragtime Band. Oh, it'll only take you a minute. They're just sitting right over there and it'll be good publicity for the speak. Sure. All right. Will you excuse me? You better hurry and get your drinking done. We got less than an hour. Yeah, hurry up, everybody. - Sorry I missed hearing you sing. - Thank you. I enjoyed your show very much. - How long have you been with the band? - Ever since they started. In fact, I was one of the charter members. Then you must have met Alex soon after he came back from the war. Yes. He was still in somewhat of a daze from it. I stepped in and sort of helped him snap out of it. - That was very fortunate for him. - Yeah, and for me too. Let me tell you something, Stella. There's one swell girl. Why, everything Alec is now, he owes to her. You know how Alec is. Moody and funny. And when he found out that you and Charlie were married, well, after all, that was kind of a sock on the nose. Why, if it hadn't been for Jerry, he might have turned into a no-good tramp. But she caught him just in time. And now look at him! On his way to Paris! Compliments of the party over in the corner. They wanna know if you'll sing a little song for them. - You know that one you did Sunday night? - I'm on a vacation. They're big spenders. They're sure gonna be disappointed. - Sorry. Not tonight. - Oh, please do. I'd love to hear you. - All right, Bill. - Thanks. All right, hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Get ''Blue Skies'' ready. Ladies and gentlemen! This little lady, before leaving for Paris, France and abroad tonight, is going to favor us with a beautiful ballad one that I know that you'll all enjoy as much as I have. And that's saying a lot 'cause I've heard 'em all. So here goes, folks! The one and only, the tops, Miss Jerry Allen! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a great celebrity with us here tonight. I want you all to meet her. Miss Stella Kirby! Sing! Come on, Stella, sing! - Come on, Stella. Come on, come on! Come on, everybody sing! (# ''Pack Up Your Sins Sorry to keep you waiting, Stella. Mac, I'm leaving the show. - You're what? - I can't continue on. You're tired. You've been on the road for ten weeks. But you're in Chicago now. We should have a long run. In another week, you'll feel like a new person. Oh, no. It's more than that. I'm only messing things up and ruining the show. I just can't stay on, I tell you. But Mr. Dillingham has great plans for you, Stella. You can't throw opportunities away like this. I'm an old hand at throwing things away. Stella, this is something that I can't decide. Mr. Dillingham will have to do that. You wait here. I'm going to get him. Gesundheit. I'm gonna take you home, put your feet in mustard water and give you a good dose of castor oil. Over my dead body. I knew you were crazy wanting to walk in this rain. Come on, get out of the wet. There'll be a taxi along in a minute. Someday I'm gonna take a good sock at you. Go ahead. Right on the button. Jerry. Let's get married. Have you got a fever? You sound delirious. No, I mean it. Now, tonight. Oh, no, thanks. You really don't wanna marry me. You're just trying to avoid the bachelor tax. - Don't you think we'd hit it off together? - Course. We always have. - Then why not? - Because you're not in love with me, Alex. I used to think you might be, someday. But I was wrong. - You mean an awful lot to me, Jerry. - I know I do. But that's not enough to marry on. Oh, I'm not complaining and I'm not asking for a thing. When this is over, it'll be over. There'll be no weeping at the bar, as far as I'm concerned. Just remember that. You think much too straight for me, Jerry. Like the rest of you modern, clever women. Come on, here comes a cab. You can't talk yourself out of taking that castor oil. Oh, Mr. Alexander! May I have your autograph? Certainly. It's a shame to bother you like this. It'd bother me a lot more if you didn't. - Mine too, please. - Thank you. Pardon me, Mr. Alexander, but we're ready when you are for the audition in room B. Thank you. I'll be right along. - Whose is this? - Mine. That's swell. Good comedy, boys. - But I want a ballad for Miss Allen. - We've got a million of them. We'll be back tomorrow with a ballad that'll tear your heart out. - Thanks very much, boys. So long. - Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Will you come in, please? Well, Charlie. You old son of a gun. - Hello, Alec. - Say, this is great. How are you, anyhow? - Fine. Fine. And you? - Swell. Come on. Sit down. Gosh, I've been reading plenty about you. You must have had all Europe for a press agent. Oh, they just happen to like American music over there. Don't try to kid me. I've heard you on the radio. Good old Charlie. How are they going, anyway? Oh, fine. Still pounding them out. As long as ''moon'' rhymes with ''June,'' I'm OK. - I guess we're both pretty lucky. - Yeah. At least we didn't have to go back to Dirty Eddie's. Say, remember the night you played the concert on Nob Hill and I lost the music? That was a great night. Will you wait a few minutes? I wanna talk to you but I got some people waitin' outside for audition. - You're auditioning? - Yeah. Then I guess you're the fella I'm supposed to see. I'm one of that few that's waiting. - Next on the list, too. - You? Sure. I got a couple of ballads. One of 'em's pretty good. - Oh, great. Let's hear 'em. - OK. Ah, gee, I'm glad to see you, Charlie. Don't think I'm not glad to see you. - How's Stella? - I don't know. - What? - I haven't heard from her in a long time. She left town right after our divorce. Divorce? You and Stella divorced? Well, sure. It just didn't... didn't pan out. I... I knew she wasn't in show business anymore, but... I thought maybe you and she were leading a quiet life somewhere and raising a family. No. Not Stella. You know how selfish she is. How unreasonable. What a double-crossing two-timer she can be. Now, wait a minute! Stella's the swellest girl I ever knew. She never two-timed anybody. - So you're still in love with her, huh? - Well, what of it? That's all I wanted to know. Because she's still in love with you. Same old Charlie. And you're the same old hothead. You were gonna sock me, weren't you? You don't know how close you came to having your ears slapped down. Seems to me I've heard those words before somewhere. Well, what are we standing here waiting for? Let's go find her. I'm sorry I can't help you. Miss Kirby left the show in Chicago and I haven't heard anything of her since. - Thanks. Thanks very much. - Why don't you try Equity? - They'll know where she is. - Thanks very much. Mr. Alexander, Mr. Dillingham would like to talk to you. He has a place for you in his new show. I'm sorry. I haven't any open time right now. Perhaps later. Goodbye. Tickets, please. Have your tickets ready, please. - Yes, Miss? - Does Bill work here anymore? - Bill? Bill who? - Bill. Used to be sort of a manager. - Oh, you mean Bill Mulligan? - Yes. - Why, he owns the place. - He does? - Could I see him, please? - Just wait over there. I'll call him. Stella Kirby. Bill. Oh, you look positively handsome. - Where have you been? - Oh. Around. I've been seeing the country. And a very big country it is, too. - What have you been doing? - Singing. Cabarets and cafs. Anyplace. You, Stella Kirby, singing in cabarets? No. Lilly Lamont. I changed my name to fit the personality. When I see some of these phonies making good today and think of you... Joe, bring us a bottle of champagne. - No, thanks. I feel more at home with beer. - Just for old times' sake. - Seen Alec? - No, I haven't. - But you're going to his concert? - I don't think so. He'd be the happiest man in the world if he thought you was out in that audience. He's looked everywhere for you. - Just let him think of me as I was. - Oh, that's silly. You're going to that concert with me. I got a box. No, I'm just killing time until my train leaves tonight. - Will you have dinner with me? - Sure. Good. I got something to do, it'll take me about 20 minutes. I'll come back, and you and I will listen to the concert here, on the radio. - All right, Bill. - Save mine. - Wish me luck, Aunt Sophie. - Roger, there's nothing to be afraid of. This is something you've been doing all your life. Something you believe in. Just think how proud Professor Heinrich and I are of you, darling. - Good luck. - Thank you. Thank you. - Where's Alec? - He'll be here in a minute. - Here he is. - Well, here we are. - It's just like Dirty Eddie's. - Except the customers have clean collars. - Well, maestro. It's your night. - Our night. The Three Musketeers. We fellas better get out there. And don't forget to be good. Ruby! Ruby! - Ruby! Stella's back! - Stella? Where? - She's over at my place. - Well, why didn't you bring her? Don't argue! Now, listen. When this concert's over, get ahold of Alec and tell him to beat it down to my place. - I'll hold her there. - All right. When Bill... I mean Mr. Mulligan comes back, would you tell him I couldn't wait? Why, uh... Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you. Taxi, ma'am? Taxi? I guess so. - Where to? - Anyplace. - Just wanna go riding, eh? - That's right. - How about the park? - Doesn't matter. Would you like some music? - Where's that coming from? - Carnegie Hall. Alexander's Ragtime Band. Sure can swing it, can't he? You want me to turn it off? Oh, no! - You may leave it on. Park's kinda pretty tonight, ain't it? Sort of springlike. - Are we still in the park? - We're just turning into 59th Street. Nice just cruising around. You take most fares, always in a hurry, always wanna get someplace. - Sure you ain't tired of this music? - No. Swell music. That's where it comes from. That's Carnegie Hall right there. But I didn't ask to go to Carnegie Hall! I know, but we gotta get out of the park some way and this is where we landed. Driver, stop here. I think I'll get out and walk. You bet. Nice night for walking. How much? - One dollar. - Is that all? Haven't we... One dollar even. No more, no less. - Thank you. - Night. - One, please. In the balcony. - Sorry, miss. The house is sold out. - Then I'll stand. - No standing room left either. Thanks. - Ruby, she's gone! - Who's gone? Stella. When I got back to the place, she'd beat it. - Well, didn't you leave anyone with her? - Yeah, the taxi driver and he's gone, too. Well, of all the stupid, clumsy things to do... Grand Central Station. That's our only hope. You couldn't find her if you stumbled over her. I'll attend to this myself. Come on. Hop in. - No, thanks. I think I'll walk. - Come on! Come on. Get in. You might as well hear the rest of the concert. Taxi! - Grand Central. - Sorry, lady, this cab's taken. Oh, for goodness' sake. Taxi! You shouldn't have done that. I could have gotten out. I don't feel like driving anyway. I wanna listen to the music. Well, looks like that's the end. Yes. That's the end. You can turn the radio off now... and drive on. I've heard all that I wanna hear. You gotta listen to ''Alexander's Ragtime Band.'' You can't go without hearing that. But I don't wanna hear it! Turn it off, I tell you. - Why don't you wanna hear it? - Because I can't! That's why. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to play ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' for two reasons. One, because I consider it the first, and best, of all swing songs. And second, because it means more to me than any other piece of music. Hearing it may take you back. Playing it takes me back, too. And so, if you'll forgive me, I'd like to play this song not only for you and for the people with whom you may associate it, but also for the people, and especially the one person, with whom I associate it. Did you hear that, Miss Kirby? - How did you know? - Oh, I heard you sing many a time. - And you remembered me? - Sure! You was great. Listen. Sing. Sing.

Amen No, my dear. We doctors can't do everything. Oh, my dear Dr. Chambers, you've done a great deal. Yes, but now it's your turn. You've got to help. You've got to want to get well. Oh, if I could, I'd be downstairs now having dinner with pa and the others. But if you shut a person up in one room for years on end... ... you can't very well expect to find her bursting with life and vigor. Tell me, Miss Elizabeth, have you ventured on your feet at all lately ? No, hardly at all. Sometimes when I'm feeling venturesome, my maid supports me across the room. You know, the fact is a change from these surroundings would do you a world of good. Italy is the place for you. Italy... Oh, no, doctor. This is my Italy. Rubbish ! That's just it. You don't want to go anywhere, you don't want to see anybody. Confounded, my dear. Isn't there something you want to do ? Yes, and I'm doing it. I'm writing poetry. And there are those who think it isn't such bad poetry. Mr. Robert Browning has sent me several kind letters of approval. Browning ? Never heard of him. Oh, you will, some day. I daresay. Well, I'm glad at least there is something you care about. Eve if it's only poetry ? Yes, only don't overtax yourself. All right. One small verse to be written an hour after each meal with a little water. Oh, doctor, that reminds me. Sit down a minute. Do you remember papa suggesting to you that a certain kind of beer called Porter might do me good ? Yes, and an excellent suggestion, too. Oh, forgive me. But it was nothing of the kind. I've had to drink it twice a day and in consequence my life has become one long misery. Bless my soul. I'm not exaggerating, one long misery. You poor little lady. It's no use my appealing to papa But if you did, Dr. Chambers, suggest to him that something else might be equally beneficial... What would you say to a couple of glasses of hot milk as a substitute ? I hate milk, but I'll drink it all day long if you'll only rescue me from Porter. Come in. Beg your pardon, Miss Elizabeth. May I take the tray now ? Yes, Wilson. Well, goodbye, Miss Elizabeth. Goodbye, doctor, and you won't forget... Eh ? P-O-R-T-E-R. I'll speak to him about it now. Oh, thank you, doctor, thank you. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, old man. Good night. Thank God, away with it ! What, miss ? The Porter, Quick take it away and never mention the word to me again. Very good, miss. Since you haven't had your Porter... I told you never to mention the word to me again. Now, take it away, please. Please. Very good, Miss Ba. Hello, dear. May we come in ? Yes, come in. How was dinner ? Was papa... ? He was, and dinner was awful. Awful awful, awful. Oh, Ba, dear, I do hope for all our sakes that Dr. Chambers' report of you isn't too good. It won't be. Oh, darling. Forgive me, dearest. You know I didn't mean it, don't you ? But any good news seems to depress him so. It isn't pa's fault, I suppose. In his way he loves us all. In his way... 8 o'clock ! Oh ! Captain Cook ? Is he nice ? He seems quite nice. I can't tell, of course. He isn't allowed to call. Do you think it's serious ? Oh, Ba, I hope not. Do you remember when young Mr. Paul Frey wanted to marry her two years ago ? The dreadful scene with papa. He's there. Oh, Ba, I wish you could see him. So drawn. So soldierly. I can imagine. It's so mean. He'll wait there for hours. Just hoping that I can slip out for a moment. And so I will. But Henrietta. Papa ? Oh, I know. It's dreadfully imprudent, dear. And not very ladylike. I don't care. I don't care ! I... Hello, Ba dear. I've just cccome to see how you are and to wwwish you good night. Come in. Come in, Henry. Ba, my dear, how are you ? Better, thank you. How's our dear tonight How's our dear Ba tonight ? Alfred. How are you, Ba ? I do think you're looking a little better. Do you think so ? What do you say, Charles ? What ? Looking better. More herself. Well, Septimus. How's Ba tonight ? The doctor's just been here and I'm afraid he wasn't too pleased with you. No ? Not looking quite so well, is she, Albert ? On the contrary, I think she's looking considerably better. So does Charles. don't you, Charles ? What ? Come in, George. My dear. How's the world's greatest poetess ? The world's greatest poetess is much better, thank you. Hello, Flush, old chum. Come in. A note for Mr. George. I wonder what's in the note. A note ? From the master, sir. Thank you. When papa starts sending out notes from his study... ... the crowds must draw. Read it for us ! Hear ye. Hear ye ! Hear ye ! This is undoubtedly a royal decree. Given at our study at 50 Wimpole Street on this the 19th day of November, 1845. God save papa ! What is it, George ? You'll all be interested to learn that papa is going to Plymouth on business this weekend... And what ? Go on ! And that he's not expected to return for at least a fortnight. George, will you Polk ? Not a chance. Well, I'll Polk. Ha ha ha you and me little brown jug don't I love thee Ha ha ha you and me little brown jug don't I love thee My wife and I lived all alone in a little brown hut we called our own She loves gin and I love rum tell you what don't we have fun Ha ha ha you and me little brown jug don't I love thee Ha ha ha you and me little brown jug don't I love thee Ha ha ha... Good evening, papa. I am most displeased. I think I have told not once but several times that in your sister's very precarious state of health... ... it is not advisable for more than three of you to be in her room at the same time. You all of you know that she must avoid every kind of excitement... ... and yet I find you rumping around her like a lot of disorderly children. I am gravely displeased. I am not aware that I have said anything amusing, Henrietta. I beg your pardon, sir. May I ask what you were doing as I came into the room ? Showing Ba the polk. How to... to... dance the Polka. I see. Well, Ba, I think I'll say good night and... I'd be grateful if you allowed me to finish speaking. Sorry, sir. I thought you www... were done. Are you being insolent, sir ? No, indeed, sir. I assure you... Very well. Now... Papa. I like nothing better than a little noise occasionally. Perhaps you won't forgive my saying, Elizabeth, but you're not the best judge of what is good or bad for you. And that brings me to what I came here to speak to you about. Dr. Chambers has just told me... ... that you have persuaded him to allow you to discontinue drinking Porter. It needed very little persuasion, papa. I said I detested Porter and he agreed at once that I should take milk instead. I questioned him closely as to the comparative strenght giving values of milk and Porter... ... and he was forced to admit that Porter came decidedly first. That may be, but when you dislike a thing to loathing, I don't see how it can do you any good. Your likes and dislikes are quite beside the point in a case like this. But Dr. Chambers himself... I have told you what Dr. Chambers said. But, papa... Did you drink your Porter at dinner ? No. Then I hope you'll will do so before you go to bed. No, papa. That's really asking too much. I can't drink the horrible stuff in cold blood. Of course I have no means of cohersing you... ... but I intend to give your better nature every chance of asserting itself. A tankard of Porter will be left at your bedside and I hope that by tomorrow... ... you will be able to tell me that you have obeyed your father. Sorry, papa, but I shan't drink it. Henrietta, go and fetch a tankard of Porter. No. I beg your pardon ? It's sheer cruelty. You know how Ba hates the stuff. You're just torturing her because you like torturing. I have told you to fetch a tankard of Porter. I won't do it. Must I ask you a third time ? Obey me this instant ! Papa ! Go and fetch it, Henrietta. Go at once. I can't stand this. Oh, no, Ba... Please. You had all better say good night to your sister. Good night, darling. Good night, Ba, dear. Good night, darling. Give it to me, please. No. You may go. Good night, darling. You may go ! Elizabeth, why do you look at me like that, child ? Are you frightened ? No. You're trembling. Why ? I... don't know. You're not frightened of me. No, no. Don't say it. I couldn't bear it. You're everything in the world to me and you know that. Without you I should be quite alone and you know that too. If you love me you can't be afraid of me, for love casts out fear. You love me, my darling ? You love your father ? Yes. Then you will prove your love by doing as I wish. But I don't understand. I was going to drink... Yes, out of fear, not love. Listen to me, my dear. I shall never in any way reproach you. You shalll never know by deed or word or hint of mine... ... how much you have grieved and wounded your father by refusing to do the little that he asked of you. Oh, papa. Let us get this over with and forget it. I can't forgive myself for having made the whole house miserable over a tankard of Porter. You're acting of your own free will and not... Yes, papa, yes. You're not feeling any worse tonight, my darling. No, papa. Just tired ? Yes, just tired. I'd better leave you now. Shall I say a little prayer with you before I go ? Please, papa. Almighty and merciful God... in thine inscrutable wisdom thou hast seen fit to lay upon thy daughter Elizabeth... ... grievous and heavy afflictions. For many years she hath languished in sickness... ... for many years, unless in thy mercy thou take her to thyself, she may languish on. Give her to bear her sufferings in patience. Give her to fix her heart and soul on thee. And on that heavenly eternity which may at any moment open out before her... Amen. Amen. Good night. Good night, papa. Better see your bed now, Miss Ba. Oh, what a pity. These flowers are dead, just since this morning. Why don't they live longer ? Nothing lives in this room. What was that, miss ? Oh, Wilson, I'm so tired. Tired, tired. Will it never end ? End, miss ? This long, long gray death of life. Oh, Miss Ba, you shouldn't say such things. No, I suppose I shouldn't. Is it a fine night outside ? Yes, it cleared up nicely after the rain. And there's such a lovely moon. Moon ? Do you think I could see it from here ? Mm, I don't know, I'm sure. Pull back the curtains. There you are. The moon is right above the chimney. Yes. Please put out the lamps, Wilson, and leave me for a little while. I don't want to go to bed quite yet. Very well, Miss Ba. Be careful. Don't talk to me. The woman opposite is watching. Listen. But don't look at me. It was kind of you to come so far. And in the snow. I wish I could ask you in, but I daren't. Aren't you freezing ? Don't answer me ! You're so tall. I wish I could see you in full uniform. Could I ? Don't tell me ! I daren't stay any longer. It looks so odd. And in this weather. I'll come again tomorrow. You'll wait for me, won't you ? Don't tell me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Miss Barrett. Hush ! But I say, Miss Barrett... If the thing were only in the proper footing... If you'd permit me to call on your father... You mustn't think of it. You'd be ordered out of the house. But if I made it quite clear ? My intentions are perfectly honorable and all that. But that would make it worse. Ever distinctly fatal, don't you see ? I can't say that I do. Papa would never permit any of us to marry. A marriage in the family ? He just almost goes insanely angry if you talk of it. Yes, but I mean... Oh, I say ! I proposed and I thought it would be so difficult. Oh, yes, Wilson, I'm quite ready for my lunch. You've had your lunch, Miss Ba. Oh, yes, of course. I enjoyed it very much. Let's keep covered up. These cold days are are that treacherous. No, it's quite beyond me. I give it up. Beg your pardon ? Wilson, have you noticed anything strange in me today ? Strange, miss ? Yes, strange. I mean stupid, thickheaded, idiotic. Good gracious, no, miss. Very well. But now listen carefully and see what you can make of this. And after, for pastime, if June be refulgent with flowers in completeness. All petals, no prickles, delicious as trickles of wine.. ... poured at mass time And choose one indulgent To redness and sweetness. Or if, with experience of man and of spider, June use my June-lightning, the strong insect-ridder, To stop the fresh film-work... why, June will consider. I call that just lovely, Miss Ba. Yes, but do you know what it means ? Oh, no, miss. Does it convey anything at all to your mind ? Oh, no, Miss Ba. Well, thank heavens for that. But then, real poetry never does, miss. Least ways not real poetry like what you make. Oh, but I didn't write that. It's by Mr. Browning. Oh, he must be a clever gentleman. Oh, Ba. Cousin Bella is here. May she come in ? Yes, dear. Oh. And Ba, just think. She's engaged. She's going to be married. Cousin Elizabeth ! Dear, dear cousin. Bella, dear. What's this I hear, engaged ? Yes. I just had to run right over and tell you. Well, congratulations, dear. Isn't it too thrilling ? Harry couldn't come, but I'll bring him next time. May I ? Oh, you'll love Harry. I'm sure we shall. Harry who ? Harry Bevan. Oh, Henrietta, the very person ! I want want you to be one of my bridesmaids. Bridesmaid ? Yes, you simply must. Cousin Bella's engaged. She's going to be married. I want you te be a bridesmaid. Oh, yes, it's your wedding. Thank you. It's going to be a great big wedding. Twelve bridesmaids. You must help me to pick out the dresses. And I'm going to wear mother's wedding veil. Don't you just love weddings, Henrietta ? Yes, I love weddings. And we're going to Paris on our honeymoon. And then to Rome. And then we're going to take the dearest, sweetest little house. It'll be just too thrilling for words. And I'll be so happy to have you for a bridesmaid. Thank you, Bella. Of course, I'd love to if papa... Oh, I don't see how he can possibly object. Object ? Isn't she funny, Ba ? You're only being asked to be a bridesmaid, not a bride. Yes, I know, Bella. Oh, it's so hard to explain. What's the matter ? You know what's the matter. It's simply that nothing at all can happen without papa's assention. We've got to obey his least will. We can't move hand or foot without his permission. We haven't got a soul of our own, not one of us. Henrietta ! Or have we ? Have we, Ba ? I tell you, Bella. He'll more than likely refuse to let me be your bridesmaid... ... and just because he's in a beastly temper. Oh, gracious, cousin Henrietta, you mustn't say such things about uncle Edward. And I'm afraid we're disturbing poor dear cousin Elizabeth. Poor, Ba. So pale, so fragile, so wisteria. One has only to see your dear face to know how near you are to heaven. I wouldn't quite say that, Bella. Oh, yes, you always have a look in your eyes... ... as if you already saw the angels. I really must be going. Goodbye. I'll come again and bring Harry. Yes, do. Oh, you mustn't tell anybody about my getting married. It's to be a big surprise. And don't worry, cousin Henrietta. I'll manage uncle Edward. Men are really so easy to manage. If you just know how. But, of course, you girls have had so little experience. Goodbye, dear, dear cousins. Well, why don't you say something ? What do you want me to say ? Nothing. Oh, Ba, darling. Don't disown me. I deserve it, I know. But I couldn't help it. I'm so miserable. Miserable, dear ? Yes, and so wildly happy. Oh, Ba, darling. Do you mind if I tell you about it ? I oughtn't to, I know... ... because if papa ever found out you knew about it he'd spend half his anger on you for not warning him. What are you talking about, dear ? Surtees has just asked me to marry him. Surtees ? Captain Cook. I've told you about him. The guardsman, you know. Yes, I remember, dear. And of course I expected him and said that I couldn't... ... and I had to tell him we must never never see each other again so when we meet tomorrow... You're not talking sense, child. What really has happened ? I don't know, Ba. Except that we both love each other. Terribly. Oh, my darling. But Henrietta, papa... Do you think I haven't thought of that ? He'll never consent. Never. I know. Ba, dear, is there anything at all to be said for papa's attitude towards marriage ? Can it possibly be wrong to want a man's love desperately and... long for babies of my own ? Love and babies are something I don't know much about. I know, dear, you're a woman apart. But love and babies are natural to a normal girl like me. And what's natural can't be wrong. No... And yet the holiest men and women renounce these things. I daresay, Ba. But I'm not holy. It's different for you. You're a great genius. Oh, yes you are. You've got your work, your studies. But do you know, Ba ? Sometimes I wonder. Are you completely satisfied ? Is it enough just to correspond with Mr. Browning, for instance ? Don't you sometimes wish that you could see him ? If I could see and not be seen. Why ? Because at heart I'm as vain as a peacock. He thinks my verse is stately and beautiful. Probably thinks me the same. It would be so humiliating to disillusion him. Oh, don't be silly, Ba. You're very interesting and picturesque. Isn't that how the guidebooks usually describe a ruin ? Oh, Ba, I didn't mean it. Of course. Tell me, is your friend very nice ? Surtees ? Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, Ba, what are we to do ? Ba, do you think it would be wiser if we were never to see each other again ? I think it might be wiser, dear. Oh... But at your age one shouldn't be too wise. Oh, Ba. Come in. A gentleman just brought this, dear. A gentleman ? Yes. And he said he would wait for an answer. Really ? Who is it from ? Henrietta ! A moment, dear. Oh ! Oh, Ba, dear, whatever is it ? Oh, really ! Please tell us, darling. Why, Ba, you're blushing. No wonder ! Listen to this. ""Dear Miss Barrett, I am unable to restrain my impatience to meet you... ... and have taken it upon myself to select February 15th""... that's today... ...""for that important occasion. And I am at this moment seated in your front hall awaiting your permission to present myself."" Wait a moment, there's more. ""I might add that I shall continue to sit here until you gratify the earnest desire that prompts my impertinent persistence. Sincerely yours, Robert Browning."" Robert Browning ! Oh, Ba, I like this Mr. Browning. You must see him. No, I can't. At least not today. But you should. It can't do you any harm. Why not ? I don't feel up to it. Really I don't. Another time. I shall go and see him myself and I'll send him up. No, Henrietta ! Stay here. I can't see him. I really don't feel that I could see him now. Arabel, tell Mr. Browning that I am very sorry but I'm not well enought to see him. But Ba, that's not true. You can't send him away. But I'd much rather not see him. Oh, fie. You're not a silly schoolgirl, I'll bring him up myself. Is my hair tidy ? Yes, dear. You look quite nice. Arabel, fix the covers. Yes. Flush, get down dear. Arabel... Yes, dear ? No... yes. No, never mind. Yes, dear. Thank you. Arabel ! Arabel, do I... Yes, darling. You do. Really. Mr. Robert Browning. Miss Barrett. Dear Miss Barrett, at last. At last ! How do you do, Mr. Browning ? I've had to put off the pleasure of meeting you much longer than I wished. Yes, that is it. I beg your pardon ? That voice. I've heard that voice a thousand times. How strange. I've not been at all well this winter and I... Won't you take off your cape ? Thank you. Wonderful ! Wonderful ! You may think, Miss Barrett, that this is the first time that I've been here, but you're quite wrong, you know. But... Oh, yes, quite wrong. I've seen this room more times than I can remember. It's as familiar to me as my own little study at home. Before I came in I knew just how your books were arranged. Just how that tendril of ivy slanted across the window pane. And those portraits of Homer and Chaucer are quite old friends. No, really. You know, I could never make out who those other fellas were on the top of the wardrobe. Oh, come, Mr. Browning. I can't believe that one of my friends has bored you with a description of my poor little room. I have pestered them for all the details I could possibly get. And my imagination supplied the rest. Directly after I read your brave and lovely verses I was greedy for anything and everything I could get about you. Oh, what they must have told you ! Oh, nothing they told me about you personally had the slightest interest for me. Because I knew it already. And better than they. Oh, Mr. Browning. Do my writings give me so hopelessly away ? Hopelessly, utterly, entirely. To me. Of course I can't speak for the rest of the world. I'm afraid it will be quite useless... ... my ever trying to play act with you. Quite useless. I shall always have to be just myself ? Always. But you, you're never yourself in any of your poems. It's always somebody else speaking through you. Yes, and shall I tell you why ? I'm a very modest man. I am. really ! We didn't question that, Mr. Browning. So modest, I fully realize that if I wrote about myself my poems would be intolerably dull. Oh, but those poems. With their glad and great-hearted acceptance of life. You can't imagine what they mean to me. Here I am shut in by these four walls and... ... and they troupe into my room, those wonderful people of yours. Out of every age and country and... ... and all so tingling with life. No, you'll never begin to realize just... ... just how much I do owe you. You really mean that ? Of course you do, or you wouldn't say it. You don't find me difficult, obscure ? Many people do. Surely not. Yet, to me it's simple and easy as the rule of three. And to you ? No, not quite always. Sometimes there are passages that... I've marked one or two in your Sordello which rather puzzled me. Ah, Sordello. Somebody once called it a horror of great gothic. I've done my best to forget it. Here it is. All right... But then, a passage torn from its context... All petals, no prickles... No prickles like trickles... Well ? Well, Miss Barrett... ... when that passage was written, only God and Robert Browning understood it. Now, only God understands it. What do you say ? Shall we lighten this great darkness by pitching it on the fire ? No, indeed, we shall do nothing of the kind. Please give me back the book. I love Sordello. You would. Of curse you would. And shall I tell you why ? Because it is a collossal failure By a failure you mean an attempt. Yes, you're right. That's just why Sordello appeals to my very heart. I too am always making collossal attempts. And always failing. But is not one such failure worth a hundred small successes ? Oh, a thousand and more. You think so too ? But of course. I knew that. Miss Barrett, you smiled when I told you that your friends had no need to describe you because I knew you already. But what you've just told me about success and failure proves to me finally how right I was. Tell me, did your fancy paint my background with a very gloomy brush ? The background possibly. But the portrait of you I had painted with the true soul of you. Ardent and lovely looking out of you. Ardent and lovely. Oh, Mr. Browning, you think you know me. Too often impatient and rebelious. Oh, what of it. I've no love for perfect patience under affliction. My portrait is the portrait of a woman, not a saint. I suppose people have told you that I... ... that I'm a dying woman. We are all of us dying. And you find me a very pitiful object ? I find you as I pictured you. Full of courage and gaiety. And yet I'm not at all sure that my colors were too somber. But... No, no, listen to me. Those colors are not yet dry. They must be scraped off. The whole background must be repainted. And if only you will allow it, I must have a hand in that splendid work. But this is... No, listen. I'll get my brush in the sunrise, the sunset and the rainbow. You say my verses have helped you but they are nothing. It's I, I who am going to help you now. We've come together at last, and I don't intend to let you go again. Give me your hand. I've more strength than is good for one man. Up to now I've spent a little of that surplus energy in creating imaginary men and women. But there's still so much to give. Mayn't I give it to you ? Don't you feel in your life tingling and prickling up your fingers and arms right into your heart and brain ? Oh, please. Mr. Browning, please let go of my hand. Well ? You're really rather an overwhelming person... ... and in sober truth I... Don't tell me that you're afraid of me. You're not. It's life you're afraid of, and that shouldn't be. Life ? Yes. When life becomes a series of electric shocks I... Was it as bad as all that ? Indeed yes. Do you affect other people in that way ? They've often told me so. No wonder I hesitated about meeting you, much as I wanted to. You know, you'll laugh at me, Mr. Browning, but when my sister told me you were downstairs... ... I was so panic stricken that I almost sent a message down saying that I was too unwell to receive you. I think I must have been quite as nervous as you at that moment... ... and I'm anything but a nervous man as a rule. But that moment was the climax of my life. Up to now. Miss Barrett, do you remember the first letter I ever wrote you ? Yes, indeed. It was a wonderful letter. You may have thought I dashed it off in a fit white out right out enthusiasm over your poems... ... but I didn't. I weighed every word of every sentence. And of one sentence in particular. This sentence: I love your books with all my heart. And I love you, too. Do you remember ? Yes. I thought it was charmingly impulsive of you. But there was nothing impulsive about it. That sentence was as deeply felt and anxiously thought over as any sentence I've ever written. I hope I have many readers like you. It's wonderful to think I may have good friends all over the world whom I've never seen or heard of. I'm not speaking of friendship but of love. It's quite useless your trying to put aside the word with a smile and a jest. I said love and I mean love. Really, Mr. Browning, I must ask you to... I'm insanely in love as any man alive. In all these months since I first read your poems I've been haunted by you. And today you are the center of my life. Mr. Browning... If I were to take you seriously it would have caused me the quick finish of a friendship which... ... promises to be very pleasant for both of us. Why ? You know very well that love in the sense that you apparently use the word... ... has no place, and can have no place in my life. Why ? For many reasons, but let it suffice... as I told you before... ... I am a dying woman. I refuse to believe it. If that were so, God would be cruel. And I know that He's compassionate. And life would be dark and evil, and I know that it's good. You must never say such a thing again. I forbid you to. Forbid, Mr. Browning ? Yes, forbid. Isn't it only fair that if you forbid me to speak with you as I fear and I accept your orders, as I must... ... that I should be allowed a little forbidding as well ? Yes, but... Dear Miss Barrett, what a splendid beginning to our friendship. We've known each other a bare half hour and yet we talk infinitely of art, and life, and death, and love. We've oredered each other about and we've almost quarrelled. Could anything be happier or more promising ? With your permission, I'm going now. I promised myself to make my first visit as short as possible. Strangers are undoubtedly tiring. Not that I am a stranger. Still I could see that you're tired. When may I call again ? I don't quite know. Will next Wednesday suit you ? Yes, I think so, but perhaps it would be better... Next Wednesday. At half past three again ? yes, but I... Au revoir, then. Goodbye. Au revoir. Au revoir. Thank you. Splendid, splendid. Really remarkable. Once more, dear. My dear Miss Barrett I congratulate you. Now sit down. You've done wonders, doctor. The real healer is no one but Miss Barrett herself. The will to live is better than a dozen physicians. The will to live. Mm. Yes. Well now, Miss Barrett, about the future. I fully agree with Dr. Chambers that another winter in London must be avoided. I see no reason against your travelling South by October, say ? Travelling South. The Riviera, or better still, to Italy. Italy ? Oh, Doctor, do you really mean it ? Why not ? I've taken the liberty to tell the doctor of the only real difficulty, and he's quite prepared to deal with... him. Quite, and drastically. Oh, but I don't think it will be necessary. Papa may not raise any objection at all. It all depends on how he's feeling at the time. Oh, fiddlesticks, my dear young lady... ... Mr. Barrett's feelings are neither here not there. What matters is his daughter's health and happiness. And I intend to make it clear to him, quite clear. What a beautiful day it is... I must be going, Miss Barrett. Don't get up, don't get up. I'm delighted with your improvement. Delighted. I'll put a little talk with your father. Goodbye, Miss Barrett. Goodbye, doctor. Italy ! Italy ! Italy ! And you are coming too, Flush. We'll see Rome together. Rome, Venice and Naples. See Naples and die... Only I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die. Yes ? Mr. Browning is here, Miss Ba. You may ask him to come up. Very good, miss. No, wait. Don't trouble, I'll go down. Oh, Miss Ba. You won't think of it. I shall not only think of it, but do it. What's more, I shall do it alone. You must let me help you. It's not safe. You've not walked downstairs for years. Let me alone, Wilson. I shall be quite all right. I can do anything. You see ? Oh, Miss Ba. Mr. Browning. It is you ! Why this is magnificent. Magnificent. I... well I... And I did it all alone. I walked down those stairs alone. A hundred of them. A hundred ? Well, fifty. This is only the first step. In a little while you'll be able to drive, to walk in the park. In the sun and fresh air. Come, come sit down. Oh, wonderful Wonderful. Here. Sit here in the sunlight. Careful. There we are. There. Now, that's the setting I've dreamed for you. The setting I'm going to keep you in. Now tell me. Tell me quickly. I've been in suspense all day. You've seen the doctors. What did they say ? Dr. Ford-Waterlow was quite taken out of his grumpy self with astonishment over my improval. Say that again. Oh, must I, the whole sentence ? I should like to see it in letters of fire burning at me from each of these four walls. This is the best moment I've had since the day I gave myself permission to call on you. How many years ago was that ? Three months. So... we've always been friends. I've known you a lifetime, you know. So he was almost taken out of his grumpy self with delight, was he ? Splendid. Of course I never once doubted that you'd turn the corner some day. I've told you so a hundred times. And Italy ? Both doctors agreed about your wintering there ? Yes. This is wonderful. I'm quite off my head with excitement. Unless, of course, papa should withhold his consent and... Oh, that I just refuse to anticipate When do they think you'll be fit for travel ? The middle of October. Unless there is a relapse. Relapse ? Why, there isn't such a word. October ? That's extraordinary. You know, October suits my own plans to perfection. Your plans ? Don't you remember my telling you that had thought of wintering in Italy myself ? Well, now I'm quite decided. Oh, papa, isn't it wonderful ? I walked downstairs. So I observe. A miracle, sir. Nothing more or less than a miracle. Did your doctors authorize this amazing imprudence ? No, papa. I should not have been surprised if they had. Aren't you proud of me, papa ? I thought there should be dancing in the streets. A general holiday. Mr. Browning, my daughter's health has been my main concern for many years... You'll permit me to remind you that I'm much better informed on the subject than an outsider ? I shall carry you to your room. Oh, no, papa. I don't need you, really. Surely, Mr. Barrett... Mr. Browning, I must say goodbye. Thank you for calling. Elizabeth. Elizabeth. You can't do it. Elizabeth. There, my child. I'm all right, papa. I could have done this. You ought to rest to regain your strength. All this talk and activity is most harmful. I'd appreciate it if you tried to get a little sleep. Papa. Well ? I'm all right, really I am. Dr. Ford-Waterlow said I was. Didn't he tell you ? Dr. Ford-Waterlow talked, if I may say so, a great deal of nonsense. But papa... I'm naturally more than gratified at your improvement, I'm delighted, of course, my poor child, but it's unlikely you'll ever be a normal woman. But I do feel so much better. Perhaps it's the wonderful weather we've been having. I always thrive in warmth, sunshine... Rubbish ! Last time it was sweltering and you've never been worse than then. No, to my mind there is only one whom we have to thank... ... though this doctor whatsisname would probably sneer if I mentioned him. Him ? I mean Almighty God. That's all I have to say at present. Papa. What is it ? Didn't he tell you that I should avoid spending next winter in England ? Well... And that he thinks I should be able to travel to Italy in October ? If you... So ! ... it's out at last. And how long has this precious plot been hatching, may I ask ? You've discussed your plans with all your friends and relatives, I suppose... ... with this Browning fellow too. And I, I alone am left out of my favorite daughter's confidence. Treated like a cypher, insultant. Insultant ? I'm cut to the heart that you, the only one of my children whom I trusted implicitly... ... should be capable of such underhand conduct. No, papa. No ! If returning health must bring with it such a sad change of character, I should be driven to wish that you were once more lying helpless on this sofa. There's nothing more to be said. But there is more to be said. And I must beg you to listen, papa. How many years have I lain here ? Five, six ? It's hard to remember, each year seemed like ten to me. And all that time I've had nothing to look forward to or hope for but death. Death ? Yes, death ! I was born with a large capacity for happiness. You remember me as a little girl. And then when life brought me a little happiness and much pain I was often impatient for the end. Elizabeth ! Then this miracle happened. Day by day I'm better able to take and enjoy such good things that everyone has a right to. Able to meet my friends, to breathe the open air, to feel the sun and see the grass and flowers beneath the sky. When Dr. Chambers first spoke to me about Italy... I put the idea from me. It seemed too impossibly wonderful But as I grew stronger, it came over me as a revelation that Italy wasn't an impossibility at all. That nothing stood in my way of going. That I really had a right to go. Right ? Yes, every right ! In my eagerness, I may have acted mistakenly, stupidly, tactlessly... ... but to call my conduct underhanded, deceitful is more than unkind. It's unjust. Cruel. Self, self, self. No thought, no consideration for anyone but yourself. For anything but your pleasure. Didn't it ever once occur to you that all through the long dark months... that you propose to enjoy yourself in Italy your father would be left here utterly alone ? No. Utterly alone. Your brothers and sisters might as well be shadows for all the companionship they afford me. And you, oh my child, don't think that I haven't noticed that you too are slowly drawing away from your father. That's not true. It is true. New life, new interests, new pleasures, new friends... ... and little by little I'm being pushed into the background. I who used to be your whole world, I who loved you... ... who love you. But papa... No, there's nothing more to be said. You want my consent for this Italian trot. I shall neither give it nor uphold it. If you go I hope you will sometimes spare a thought for your father. Think of him at night, stealing alone in this empty room which once held all he loved. Think of him kneeling alone by the empty sofa imploring the good Shepherd to have... Who's that ? I shall come to you again when you've had time to consider the wisdom of my words. Well, Flush... It seems we aren't going to Italy. Cousin Elizabeth. Hello, dear. I brought Harry to see you. This is my fianc, my dear, dear Harry. Mr. Bevan, Miss Elizabeth Barrett. Delighted, Miss Barrett. Charmed. No, no, Harry. You must take her hand. Such a little hand, so frail, so spiritual. Yes. And a hand that pens so much that is noble and eloquent. Oh, thank you. I am honored, Miss Barrett. So nice of you to come. Thank you. We'll only stay a minute. I trust you're not too weary of being congratulated upon the prize you've won. Thank you, Miss Barrett. A prize indeed. Dear Ba. And doesn't Henrietta look lovely ? She'll be quite the prettiest of my bridesmaids. Indeed I'm afraid she'll draw all eyes from the little bride. At any rate, all the gentlemen's. Oh, Bella, dear... If I hadn't spoken to Uncle Edward myself I should never have had her for a bridesmaid. Yes, my dear, you certainly have a way with you. Spoken to papa ? I like that. While you sat on his knees and stroked his whiskers. And why not ? Isn't he my uncle ? And besides that, I think he's most frightfully thrilling. I adore that stern and gloomy type of gentlemen. Oh, come, come, my pet. And I must tell you, Ba, how much I adore your poems. It's best when dear Harry reads them. He reads so beautifully. And he too adores your poems. Which ought to please you, as he's dreadfully critical. Not at all, not at all. Dear Harry is so frightfully earnest. Yes ? Excuse me, Miss Elizabeth. Mr. Browning is downstairs. Oh... Ask him to wait, please. Oh, no, dear cousin. Ask him to come right up. We have to go downstairs and have tea with Uncle Edward. And besides, we wouldn't dream of interrupting your tte--tte. Isn't it thrilling, Harry ? Mr. Browning, a poet. And Elizabeth a poet. Isn't that a coincidence ? So quaint, my pet, quaint. Ask Mr. Browning to come up now, Wilson. Yes, and I'm quite sure that the tea is ready. Arivederci, dearest Ba. May I come soon again ? Yes. Come whenever you like, Bella dear. Next time I shall want you all to myself. Without Harry. But why must I be excluded ? Because I keep the lids to tell dear Ba about a certain big, big man who might easily grow convinced if he heard me. Oh, come, come, my pet. It has been a pleasure, Miss Barrett. Nice of you to come and see me. Not at all. I have long been looking forward to the honor of meeting you. Good day. Au revoir, darling. Auf wiedersehen. Good day. Oh, Mr. Browning. I'm so thrilled to see you. It is Mr. Browning, isn't it ? It must be because I've often heard him called the handsomest poet in England. Of course you don't know poor little me. Nevertheless, madam, I thank you. Isn't he wonderful ? Isn't he divine ? The loveliest little shivers are running right down my back. Come, come, my pet. I've been unable to think of anything else. What about Italy ? Have you asked him yet ? I'm not to go to Italy. In spite of the fact that both doctors... The doctors may have proposed, but the decision lies elsewhere. But didn't they make it clear to him that this may mean all the difference between life and death ? I believe Dr. Ford-Waterlow spoke very forcibly and... In heaven's name... It's rather hard to explain to seomeone who doesn't know all the circumstances. Papa is very devoted to me... Devoted ? Very devoted to me. He depends a great deal on my companionship. My brothers and sisters, they don't... Devoted ! Miss Barrett, may I speak plainly ? Oh, do you think you'd better ? I know more or less how you feel but... Very well. I shall say nothing. You tell me he's devoted to you. I don't understand. I don't understand a devotion that demands favors as if they were rights. I don't understand a devotion that spends itself in petty tyrannies and gross bullying. I don't understand a devotion that grudges you any ray of light and glimpse of happiness. Doesn't even stop at risking your life to gratify its collossal selfishness. Devotion ! Give me good, sound, honest hatred other than devotion like that. Mr. Browning, I must ask you... Forgive me but I won't be silent any longer. Even before I met you I knew that sickness wasn't the only shadow on your life. And all these months I felt that other shadow deepen and I have stood by and looked on. But I'm done with pretense from today on. It's not just your comfort and happiness which are at stake now. It's your very life. And I forbid you to play with your life. And I have the right to forbid you. No, please don't say any more. The right. At our first meeting you forbade me to speak of love. But I knew well enough, we both knew, that I was to be much more than just your friend. Even before I passed that door I loved you. And I've gone on loving you. And I shall love you to the end. And beyond. You know that. You've always known it. Yes. Yes, I've always known it. And now, for pity's sake, for pity's sake, leave me. If my father had the least suspicion that you were more than a friend, both our lives would be made unbearable. I love you and I shall never leave you. And I love you, Robert. And yet you ask me to take my marching orders and go out of your life. Yes, Robert. But what have I to give you ? I have so little of all that love asks for. I should have refused to see you again after our first meeting. For I loved you then though I would have denied it even to myself. I love you. Oh, Robert. Do you know what you've done for me ? I could have laughed when Dr. Chambers said that I'd heal myself by wanting to live. Oh, I wanted to live eagerly, desperately, passionately, but only because life meant you. You, the sight of your face, the sound of your voice and the touch of your hand. Oh, and so much more than that. Because of you the air once more was sweet to breathe. And all the world was good and green again. And with those words singing in my ears, I am to turn my back on you and go. Yes, Robert. For how is it to end ? What have we to look forward to and... I love you. And I want you for my wife. Robert, I can't marry you. How can I with... Not today or tomorrow. Not this year perhaps, or next. Perhaps not for years ro come. I may never be able to marry you. But what then ? If you remain to the last beyond my reach, I shall die proud and happy... ... in having spent a lifetime fighting to gain the richest prize a man was ever offered... No, no, no. Robert, if we were to say goodbye today... ... we should have nothing but beautiful memories of each other to last to the end of our lives. Is it you who are speaking ? What do you mean ? Here's life. Life offering us the best that life can give. And you dare not grasp at it for fear that it will turn to dust in your hand. I don't know you, I never thought you were a coward. A coward ? Yes, Robert, I'm a coward. A coward through and through. But it's not myself that am afraid. I know that, my dear. What's another disaster, great or small, to me who have known it would disaster all my life ? But you're a fighter. You were born for victory and triumph. Oh, what if disaster came to you through me ? Yes. A fighter. But I'm sick of fighting alone. I need a comrade in arms to fight beside me. But not one already wounded in the battle. Wounded but not defeated. Undaunted. Unbroken. What finer comrade could a man ask for ? But Robert... No, no. But Robert. No. Dear Uncle Edward, don't you think that your attitude about love and marriage... I repeat that I do not care to discuss that subject. Of course, dear Uncle Edward. Of course. You aren't angry with me, are you ? Certainly not, child. Then why that gloomy frown ? Sit down. There. There. All gone. Oh, come, come, my pet. If my children were as bright and open and affectionate as you are... I should be a much happier man. You mustn't say such things or they'll hate me. You're a very charming little person. Anything wrong in that ? I didn't say so. What's that scent you've got on ? Scent ? Me ? Don't you like it ? I abominate scent as a rule, but yours is different. Nice ? It's delicate and subtle. Still, I'd prefer you not to use it. Why ? Never mind. Oh, uncle, you're a darling. You call me bright, and open, and affectionate... ... charming, and fragrant. All within a few minutes. You may kiss me. You know who's upstairs, Uncle Edward ? Mr. Robert Browning, the poet. Isn't that thrilling ? I see nothing particularly thrilling in it. Mr. Browning's respect for my daughter's intellect seems to justify continuation of their friendship ? Oh, yes. Such a nice intellectual friendship. Two poets. My, my, wouldn't it be frightfully interesting if only dear Flush could speak ? Not as interesting as if you could keep silent. Oh, I'm just joking. And besides, I know that in his great big heart Uncle Edward is really on the side of romance. In the part of true love and all that. What do you mean ? If you could just have seen her face light up when Mr. Browning's name was announced. Bella, you... Isn't it beautiful ? Yes, miss, them wisteria is most certainly beautiful. Isn't it though. Oh, is that Mr. Browning over there ? Shouldn't be at all surprised, miss. Miss Barrett, I believe. How do you do, Mr. Browning ? How do you do ? How do you do, Flush ? Wilson ? Isn't this a coincidence ? We were just enjoying the beautiful wisteria But it's much more exquisite over there. I'm afraid, however, you shall have to go on foot. Miss Ba, you mustn't. Miss Wilson, I'm perfectly able to walk any distance. If you would care to go with me... Yes, thank you. Wilson, would you wait here ? And you too, Flush, dear. Miss Ba, what would the master say ? When my father returns to town I shall be very pleased to tell him myself. Shall we ? Greatest of pleasure. You'll pardon us, Flush. Oh, it's so beautiful. I'm delighted that you like it. You can't imagine the difficulty I had in getting that particular tree to grow that particular position. And as for the sunlight, well, my dear, you won't believe the trouble I have with the sun. It just won't stay still a minute. So you got the sun to stay there just for me. Oh, it was nothing at all, I assure you. Wait until after we're married. Please, Robert. Not today. Let's just have today as a day of nonconsequential subjects. Agreed. Now, in here we have some very rare specimens. The choicest and most exotic beauties in the floral kingdom. For instance, ... here we have the Orchidaceae Stictophyllum. How exquisite. Here, by a curious coincidence, we have two chairs. Also very rare. And here, my dear, you have a man who loves you. Also very rare. Very. Has it got any feathers ? No ! A tiger ? No. No. A dragon ? No. Think of something you're more afraid of than anything else in the world. Hm. Is is a gggg..girl. I know ! It's papa ! Yes ! Listen, Ba. Do you remember that, Ba ? Yes, dear. You wrote the words and I always loved it. Yes, dear. Let BBBBa play it. I haven't played it in years. My arm, madame. Make way for the prima donna. I'll turn the pages for you. Oh, you're making me nervous. Henrietta, dear, you should really play this. No, darling, you play it. Oh, I don't think I seem to remember it. Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine... ... to lie along with thine ? As a little stone in a running stream... ... it seems to lie and pine. Now drop the poor pale hand, Dear, ... unfit to plight with thine. Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine... ... to lie alone with thine ? That's lovely, Ba. Look at Henrietta, she's cccrying. I just think it's so lovely seeing Ba sing again. Bless you, dear. Sing it again, Ba. Yes, do. I will if you all join me. Will you ? Yes. Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine... ... to lie along with thine ? As a little stone in a running stream... ... it seems to lie and pine. Now drop the poor pale hand, Dear, ... unfit to plight with thine. Wilt thou have my hand to lie along with thine... ... to lie alone with thine ? Good heavens, you'll be a success. No... Come on, let's have another game. Its my turn to go out. Beg your pardon, Miss Elizabeth. This letter's just come. Special letter just brought. It's from papa. But he was to return tomorrow. Perhaps he's been detained. Do you think so ? Oh. What is it ? ""This is to let you know that we shall be leaving London within a fortnight... I've taken a furnished house at Bookham in Surrey, six miles from the nearest railroad station... You will benefit by the country air and complete seclusion of your new surroundings."" Hurry up, aren't you ready yet ? Oh, poor Henrietta. We mustn't let her know. Poor Surtees Cook. ""I have thought for some time now that your present feverishly restless mode of living in London will, if continued... ... affect you harmfully both physically and morally..."" ... my feverishly restless mode of living... ... no wonder he doesn't describe me as a recklessly dissipated woman.. ""You will inform your brothers and sisters of my decision and tell them that I decline absolutely to discuss it when I return home."" He doesn't say when. Oh, Ba, you poor darling. He made my going to Italy impossible and now we are to be cut off from any little pleasures we find here. I see that he finishes up with the characteristic touch of humor. Humor ? He signs himself ""your loving papa"". You see what this means ? Yes. Perhaps better than you do. Oh, you're wrong. You don't know papa as I do. He's growing jealous of my life here. My pleasures and my friends... and I'm slowly and surely to be parted from them. Oh, Robert, it will soon be made impossible for me to see you at all. This precious letter of your father's means a great deal more that you as yet haven't been able to grasp. Great deal more ? It means that you will be in Italy before the month is out. Italy ? Yes. And with me. Robert ! It means we must be married at once. Do you know what you're saying ? Yes, I know what I'm saying and I repeat it. We must be married at once. Oh, Robert. It's no use deceiving ourselves. It's not only papa who stands between us. It's I. It's I. However stronger I may become I shall always remain an invalid. Oh, Robert, as your wife, dear, I should be haunted day and night by... by thoughts of all the glorious things you would have done but for me. Freedom, adventure... ... and passionate love. I... ... I could never really satisfy. No. No, listen. Oh, Robert. I should be haunted by the ghosts of your unborn children. When I read that letter my world seemed to fall to pieces. But now I thank God that it came while I was still free. I have the strength to shake hands and say goodbye. On the whole I think this will be our best plan of campaign. We'll meet at Marylebone Church on Saturday and be married quietly some time in the morning. I'll see about the license at once and interview the vicar. Robert ! The packet leaves the Royal Pier on Saturdays at midnight. We must catch the 8 o'clock express at Vauxhall. It arrives at Southhampton at 11. Dear. Come along, come along. And I always thought that papa was the most overbearing man in the world. And yet you've known me for quite some time now. I know, darling, but I mustn't give way. I mustn't, I daren't. There's one other thing, my darling. You can't possibly travel without a maid. Do you think Wilson would be willing to come abroad with us ? Robert... Have you ever thought that my strenght may break down in the journey ? Yes. So as I were to die on your hands. Are you afraid, Ba ? Afraid, You know I'd rather die with you beside me than live a hundred lives without you. But how would you feel if I were to die like that ? And what would the world say of you ? I should be branded as a little better than a murderer. What I should feel, I leave you to imagine. And yet you ask me to come with you ? Yes. I'm prepared to risk your life and much more than mine. Get you out of that dreadful house and into the sunshine, and to have you... ... for my wife. You love me like that ? I love you like that. Robert. Yes, dear. Will you... will you give me a little time ? Time is short, my dear. Yes, I know. Your father is expected back... Not till next week You shall know before then. You promise me that ? I promise. Oh, Miss Ba, I was that worried about you. Out in the rain and everything. Rain ? Oh, yes. Quite a shower. The sun's shining and lovely now. Contrary thing. Oh, is anything wrong, miss ? Wrong ? No, no. Ba ! Oh, Ba, you must see him at once, you simply must. Him ? He's in full regimentals. He's just been to St James to receive whatever you call it, ... his adjunctancy or something, from Queen Victoria herself. Oh, he's wonderful, he's gorgeous. I'm talking about Captain Cook, you know. Yes, so I've gathered. Darling, I'm swooning out now. I've just been out and I'm quite tired. But some other time will do just as well. No, no. I told you, he's in full uniform. Oh, he's just on the landing outside. Please see him, Ba. All right darling, bring him in. Come up, Surtees. Careful or you'll wreck yourself. There. Attention ! March ! Captain Surtees Cook, Ba. My sister Elizabeth. Your servant, Miss Barrett. Captain Cook. Twice honored in one day, you know. First by Her Majesty, then by you, Miss Bartett. Really, I don't know what I've done to deserve it. That's right, you've just come from the palace, haven't you ? I've never seen the Queen. Tell me, what is she like ? Very little lady, mam. But royal every inch of her. Surtees, you haven't got your sword on. Not etiquette, as I told you, to wear it indoors. Oh, bother. I shall get it. I want Ba to see you in full war paint. Where did you leave it ? Well, it's in the hall. I'll fetch it. No, look here, Miss Barrett doesn't want to... But indeed I do, Captain Cook. I don't think I've ever seen an officer in full war paint before. Indeed ? Won't you sit down. Oh, yes, Wilson, I think you'd better take Flush out. He always gets so excited when there are a few people in the room. Oh, yes, of course. Miss Barrett... Yes ? Miss Barrett... Yes, Captain Cook ? I say, Miss Barrett... You want to tell me something about Henrietta, don't you ? Just so, Miss Barrtett, just so. Exactly. You know, Miss Barrett, you know... Yes, Captain Cook, I know. And believe me, you have my heartfelt sympathy. Thank you, oh, thank you, it's more than I deserve. Thank you, Miss Barrett. Never was such a girl, you know. Henrietta, I mean. I don't know what I've done to deserve it. Captain Cook... Did he tell you something while I was out of the room ? Don't tell me he really managed to get it out. Well, perhaps not quite... Well, still you know, like most ladies, quick in the uptake. Yes, I understood. Listen, my dear. Don't ever let anything keep you from doing what you think in your heart is right. Remember that. Quite aware I'm not much of a match, Miss Barrett. Poor man you know. Surtees, let me buckle on your sword. Oh, I say... Ba thinks that poets are the flower of manhood, a certain poet at any rate. I mean to show her that she's mistaken. You've got it wrong, you know. I have ? The sword hangs from the left hip, you know. Why ? Well, it's sort of... Papa ! You're back sooner than I expected, papa. I don't think I have the privilege of this gentleman's acquaintance. Captain Cook, may I introduce my father. Papa, Captain Surtees Cook. Your servant, sir. Captain Cook is a great friend of George and Octavius. Indeed. My sons are very rarely at home at this hour of the day. The fact is, sir, I was just passing the house and... ... I thought I'd look in, you know, in the off chance of finding one of them in and all that. I see. Captain Cook has just come from Buckingham Palace. And Henrietta thought I should like to see him in all the splendor of his regimentals. Indeed. Nothing much to look at, of course, sir, but... ladies like a bit of color and I thought... By Jove, it must be getting late... It is 19 and a half minutes past twelve. By Jove, it's high time that I was moving. Goodbye, Miss Barrett. Goodbye, Captain. Goodbye, Miss Henrietta. I'll see you out. Your servant, sir. I'm seeing Captain Cook to the door. The servants will attend to that. This house is fast becoming a rendez-vous for half London. This was the first time I had the pleasure of meeting Captain Cook. Indeed, but I infer from what I saw as I came into the room ... ... that Henrietta's acquaintance has a somewhat longer standing, or am I mistaken ? I've known Captain Cook for some time now. Oh, since when has it been your custom to buckle on his accoutrement ? I'd never seen him in full uniform before. And I think it improbable that you will see him in full uniform or otherwise in the future. But papa... Captain Cook to be forbidden to visit us because I helped him on with his sword.... You received my letter ? Yes, papa. What has just happened fully confirms me in the wisdom of my decision. Fortunately our new home is so far from town that your London friends are not likely to trouble us. Our new home ? I don't understand. Are we leaving Wimpole Street ? I have taken a house in Bookham in Surrey. Why ? I am not in the habit of accounting for my actions to anyone, least of all to my children. But one thing I've the right to ask you, papa. Is Captain Cook to be forbidden the house because of what just happened ? I understood you to say Captain Cook was George's friend and Octavius'. Yes, and my friend too. Ah... come here. Yes, papa ? Come here ! What is this man to you ? I told you, he's a friend of ours. What is he to you ? A friend. Is that all ? Yes. You liar ! Papa ! Papa, let me go. What is this man to you ? Answer me. Please, papa, please. Answer me ! No. No. Answer me ! He's... he's... Oh, papa, I love him ! Ah... Oh, you... you... you... You... you... ! Papa ! Papa ! Let her go ! I won't have it ! Let her go at once. You and this filthiness ! I've known that Henrietta loved Captain Cook for some time and I've given her all my strength. You dare to tell me ! Yes ! I would have given her all my help too if I had it to give. I'll deal with you later. Get up ! Papa, listen to me, please... I'm not a bad girl, I swear to you I'm not. I know I've deceived you, I'm sorry. I love him. I love him. He's a good man. It can't be wrong to love him. I want love. I can't live without love. Papa, remember how you loved mama and she loved you and you'll understand and pity me... Get up ! Sit there ! How long has this been going on ? Do you hear me ? How long have you been carrying on with this fellow ? I've known Captain Cook for over a year. You've been with him often ? Yes, Alone ? Yes. Where ? We met in the park, and... In here ? Yes. Here and alone ? Have you been with him in this house alone ? Yes. So clandestine meetings under my own roof and abetted by one whom I beleived to be holy, chaste and good... How dare you, papa. Now listen to me. Unless you give me your solemn word that you will neither... ... see nor have any communication with this man again, ... you will leave my house at once as you are with nothing but the clothes you have on. Once outside my doors, you can go to perdition any way you please. But you will never be admitted again as long as I live. I think you know I never go back on my word. You have your choice. Take it. Is it nothing to you that I shall hate you for this to the end of my life ? Less than nothing. Will you give me your word neither to see nor to have any communication with this man again ? I have no choice. Elizabeth, give me your Bible. My Bible belonged to mama. I can't have it used for such a purpose. Give me your Bible. No. You refuse ? Yes. Come here. Place your hand upon the Book. Repeat after me. I give you my solemn word... ... that I shall neither see nor have any communication with Captain Cook again. I give you my solemn word that I will neither see... nor have any communication with Captain Cook again. You will now go your room and remain there until you have my permission to leave it. Henrietta. Henrietta. Do you remember what I told you ? Just what did that mean ? I was reminding Henrietta what I told her a short time ago. I begged her to fight for her happiness. You dare ! Yes, yes ! For years I've crushed down my doubts. I tried to persuade myself that in spite of all you loved us. But at last I've been forced to face the truth. You're like a shadow over our lives. I command you to be silent. I won't stand by and see you wreck her life if I can save it. You may be too strong for me, but at least I'll try. I'll try... Elizabeth ! You might have had the love of all your children. But instead you have fear. Fear and hatred. Elizabeth ! Hatred, I tell you. Hatred and mine too. Hatred. It will be hard for me to forget what you have said. I shall leave you under my extreme displeasure. When you have repented your wickedness and are ready to ask for God's forgiveness, ... and mine, you may send for me. Come in. Wilson, shut the door, please. Wilson... Are you my friend ? Your friend ? Yes, I'm very much in need of friendship and help at the moment. Oh, I'm that fond of you I'd do anything to help you, miss Ba. Good. I'm going to marry Mr. Browning. Marry ? Shhh. Does he know ? No, and he mustn't. Nobody must. I should just think not indeed. Oh, Miss Ba. I'm that glad. After we're married we're going to Italy. And Mr. Browning would like to know if you'll come with us. To Italy ? Yes. Will you come ? Well, miss, I don't see as how I can help meself. Not that I hold to foreign parts, I don't, but... husband or no husband, you'd never get to Italy alive without me. Thank you, Wilson. Now, I want you to take a letter right to Mr. Browning. You'll have to take a cab at once. A cab ? Yes, go and get all your things. I'll have this finished by the time you're ready. Hurry ! But Miss Ba... ... is it to be at once ? No, probably not for a month or so. Be quick, though. Yes, miss. But Miss Ba... If it's not to be for a month... Yes, Wilson, I know I'm absurd... but I made up this courage. Besides, I believe Mr. Browning will be glad to get my letter. Oh, I'm sure he will, miss. Miss Wilson, has anything happened ? What is it ? Miss Ba sent this for you, sir. Oh. Oh, it's all right, sir. Wilson, I... I was afraid that... perhaps... If you don't mind, sir... I think it's splendid. Oh, thank you, Wilson, thank you. Thank you, Wilson. If you don't mind, sir. Wilson, I knew she'd do it. I had no right to be afraid. I wasn't really afraid. Oh, no, sir. Wilson, do you realize that you are the bearer of the greatest good tidings since they brought the good news from ------ ? You wait here, Wilson. I'm going upstairs and tell the good news to my mother. I'm going to tell it to everybody. Oh I wouldn't do that, sir. You wait here and then we'll go back together in triumph to Wimpole Street. Perhaps we'd better have music, a band or something. You're not to do that, sir. The master's come home. What's that ? Mr. Barrett, sir. He came home. Oh, Miss Ba. Shhh. Oh, Miss Ba, you can't imagine... What did he say ? Well, miss, he's a most unusual man. There he stood giving me orders. Telling me what you and me was to do. Really, miss, I don't know what your married life is going to be like. Wilson, was he pleased when he read the letter ? He was that pleased, miss. What did he say, how did he look ? I want to know everything. Well, miss... He couldn't say a word at first. He seemd all kind of choked up, like... Oh, Wilson. Wilson, he was happy that I... Yes, miss, he was that happy. You should have seen his face. And then he started running around with timetables and those things. And he says you are to wear your ordinary travelling clothes to the church. Church ? Yes, miss, you're going to be married tonight. But, Wilson. That's absurd. Tonight ? How can we ? I don't know. But we're going to. He's going to get a vicar and a special license. And as soon as we're finished packing, we're to meet him at the church. So I might just as well start packing. But Wilson, how can we ? Don't ask me, ask him. What dresses are you going to pack, miss ? Wilson, do you want to drive me mad. You know we can't. He says you can. Oh, miss. There's a lot I'd give to be here... ... when the master finds out you've gone and got married. Don't Wilson, don't. The very thought terrifies me. Wilson, put back those things and give me time to think. You know it's out of the question. I'm not prepared and I... Wilson ! Put back those things. Oh, miss, you did give me a turn. Be quiet. Ba ! What on earth is the matter ? Why, nothing. Nothing. It's just... ... it's all been so upsetting. I don't believe that's all. Look at Wilson. You've startled us. Wilson, will you come back in a little while ? Is there something you want to say to me, dear ? Yes. Papa threatened to turn me out of the house unless I swore on the Bible not to write or see Surtees. Well, I'm going to break that Bible oath. Are you, dear ? Yes, and I shall glory in breaking it. I shall see Surtees every day when we leave. And when we're in the country I shall write to him. And if papa asks me, I'll go out of my way to lie to him. I see. Why do you tell me this ? Because I want you to say that I'm a wicked, deceitful, perjured, loose woman... ... so that I can fling the words back in your face. Oh, Ba. Ba, darling, I didn't mean that. I'm not myself. I'm all love and hate. I don't know which is the worse torture. Oh, my dear. You think I don't understand, but I do. I do. And I implore you, dear, never lose hope. Never lose courage. Never. The master. Ba, there is something. You're as white as a sheet. What is it ? Is there anything I can do ? No, no. Don't speak, don't ask me anything. You know nothing, you understand ? Nothing, nothing. What's the matter with that woman ? Wilson ? Yes. And you. Nothing, papa. Where have you been ? Nowhere. Where are you going ? To Aunt Hedley's. Is that the truth ? Yes. Remember your oath. Yes. Are you going to keep it ? Yes. I want to speak to your sister. You may go. Do you know why I've come back ? No, papa. Because I cannot bear to be estranged from you. You should have come to me to beg my forgiveness for your wicked and cruel words. But in spite of my sense of right and justice and duty I had to come to you. And I despise myself for coming. I despise myself, I hate myself... Oh, no, no, no. Oh, papa, can't you see, won't you ever see that strength may be weakness ? And that your sense of justice, duty and right are all mistaken and wrong ? It's been my heavy cross that those whom I was given to guide and rule have always fought against the right which I knew to be the right. And was in duty bound to impose upon them, even you. Even your mother My mother ? Yes, your mother. You, my eldest child, were born of love and only love. But the others, long before they came, love died out and fear took its place. No, no... Fear. And all because I saw the right and did it. Not that she ever opposed me ever once. Oh, dear God, what she must have suffered. Ba, my dear, don't, don't. I shouldn't have spoken about it. Take your hands from your face. Don't look at me like that. You don't understand, how should you ? You know nothing of the brutal tyranny of the senses and how even the strongest and best are driven by it to hell. Would you have abetted your sister... Henrietta's in love ! You dare speak of it in the same breath ? Her, love ? You ignorant little fool, what do you know about love ? Love. Desire. It's time a little reality were brought into your dream of life. I won't listen to you. You must ! You shall ! Do you suppose I should have guarded my house like a dragon from this so-called love... ... if I hadn't known from my own life all it entails of degradation and remorse ? With the help of God and through years of tormenting abstinence I strangled it in myself... ... and so long as I have breath in my body I'll keep it away from those I was given to protect. Do you understand me ? Yes. I understand you. I understand you. Very well. This has been a painful necessity but I had to speak plainly lest your very innocence... ... should smirch the purity I'm utterly resolved to maintain in my household. You're cold as ice. Why are you trembling ? I shall never forget what you have said. For the love of heaven, my darling, don't let this raise any further barrier between us. I cannot play the coward's part and take the easier way and shirk my duty. I'd rather be hated by the whole world than gain love that way. Oh, papa, you don't know how I pity you. Pity ? I don't want your pity. If ever I should lose you or your love... My darling, in our new home we shall draw close to each other again. Nothing and no one can come between us, my child, my darling. You want me to be happy. The only happiness I shall ever know is all yours to give or take. You must look up to me and depend on me and lean on me. You must share your thoughts with me, your hopes, your fears, your prayers... I can't bear it, I can't bear any more. Let me go papa. Please, let me go ! Forgive me, my dear, I was carried away. Shall I leave you now ? Please. Shall I see you again tonight ? Not tonight. I shall pray for you. Pray for me tonight ? Yes. Pray for me tonight if you will. Did he find anything out ? Wilson, I'm going. I must. Now, at once. Oh, Miss Ba, what's happened ? But we haven't packed. Well, we must go without. But we won't have as much as a nightgown. We can buy them. Miss Ba... I can't stay here, Wilson. I'm frightened. I'm frightened. Fetch your cloak and bonnet. But, Miss Ba, if he did catch us... He can't stop me. I don't belong to him anymore. He could kill me, but he can't stop me. Oh, Miss Ba, I daren't just now. I daren't. Let's go to the other room. Oh, we can't do that. Wilson, I must. That's all I know. I must go. To Robert. But, miss Ba... Wilson, until today I've never really known my father. I've even hoped I might confide in him, but now I know t would be hopeless. He'd crush me as he crushed my mother. Oh, miss Ba... He's cruel, Wilson, cruel and pitiless and I'm afraid. If you want to draw back you needn't ever reproach yourself. But I must go to Mr. Browning now. I'll fetch my cloak and bonnet at once, miss. Wilson. Oh, miss Ba. They're all down to dinner now, miss. The master's just gone in. All right, Wilson. Come, Flush. Henrietta ! I'm going to call Arabel, papa. Take your place and be seated without her. Almighty Father, giver of all good gifts... ... who of thy thy divine providence has provided thy unworthy servants... ... with all things necessary to their bodily sustenance. Grant, we beseech thee, spiritual grace... ... that we may enjoy it in quietness of spirit as proof of thy bounty... ... and render unto Thee most humble and hearty thank. Amen Amen. For heaven's sake, what is it ? Tell us at once ! She's gone. To be married. What do you mean ? Arabel ! Arabel, pull yourself together at once ! Where's Ba ? Answer me, where's Ba ? She's gone. She left this note. Read it. It's true. It's true. She sends us her love and will write to all of us from Italy. Italy. Look ! This letter is for papa. Papa. What's to be done ? Someone must give him Ba's letter. Let me. I should love to. What is the meaning of this ? Who was making that hideous noise ? Where is Elizabeth ? You hear me. Where is your sister ? She left you this letter. Left me ? What do you mean ? She left a letter for Arabel. And this for you. Oh, papa, you must forgive her. Not for her sake, but for yours. I thought I hated you, but I don't. I pity you. And if you have any pity for yourself, forgive her. Elizabeth. Yes, yes, her dog. Yes, I'll have her dog. Octavius. Yes, sir. Her dog must be destroyed at once. What ? You will take it to the vet tonight. Do you understand me ? Tonight. Do you understand me ? Heavens, I don't see what the ppp...poor little beast has done. Do you understand me ? In her letter, Ba writes that she has taken Flush with her. For as much as Robert and Elizabeth have consented together in holy wedlock... ... and have witnessed the same before God and this company... ... I pronounce that they be man and wife together. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost... Amen. God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost... Bless, preserve and keep that ye may so live together in this life... ... that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting. Amen.

This will be an anxious Christmas for you. l think this one will do. Let's try this. -ls it your only son? -No, ma'am. l had four, but two were killed and one is a prisoner. You've done a great deal for your country, sir. Not a mite more than l ought, ma'am. l'd go myself if l was any use. Thank you for the overcoat. Wait a minute. l hope you find him better. Thank you, ma'am. God bless you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Mrs. March, will you sign this so l can get it off? Why, what's the matter? When l see things like that poor old man... ...it makes me ashamed to think how little l do. But, my dear, you're doing all you can here, and your husband is there. Yes, l know. His last son is lying ill, miles away... ...waiting to say goodbye to him, forever perhaps... ...while l have my four girls to comfort me. And a real comfort they are, too, aren't they? l couldn't bear it without them. -Meg and Jo are working, you know? -Yes? Meg is a nursery governess. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Remember, Lily, Santa Claus is watching you. Come on, Tony. ''We know as well, what are the baneful fruits of selfishness... ''...and self-indulgence. Bad habits take root with fearful rapidity... ''...even in the richest natures. ''They grow... ''...and ripen and bear their fruit... ''...like southern vines and weeds... ''...almost... ''...in a single day and night. ''Crush them, pluck them out pitilessly from their very first appearance... ''...and do not weary... ''...of the labor of plucking them out... ''...again and again.'' Goodbye, goodbye! Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! Go on, Josephine. Josephine! Where are you off to, Miss? l didn't think you'd mind. lt was nearly time to leave and the girls said they'd be home early... ...so we could rehearse my play for Christmas. Never a thought about my Christmas. Flying off without a word of cheer or greeting for your poor old aunt. l'm sorry, Aunt March. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Here. lt's a dollar for each. Well, take them. Thank you, Aunty. Never mind thanking me. Just spend it wisely, that's all l ask. Although it's more than l can expect when you're so much like your father... ...waltzing off to war and letting other folks look after his family. There's nobody looking after us. And we don't ask favors from anybody. l'm very proud of Father and you should be, too. -Don't you be impertinent, Miss. -l'm sorry, Aunty. lt isn't preachers that are going to win this war. lt's fighters! Yes, Aunty. -Can l go, now? -Yeah, go on. -Did you clean Polly's cage today? -Yes, Aunty. Did you wash those teacups and put them away carefully? Yes, Aunty. -You didn't break any? -No, Aunty. -What about the teaspoons? -l polished them. Yes. Very well then. Wait, just a minute. Come back here. Look at this. You haven't dusted properly. l want this stair rail dusted and polished before you leave here. Yes, Aunty. Higher. Thank you very much, ladies. And now l wish you all a very merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! School is dismissed. Amy March! You may close the door. That'll teach her not to cut up didoes. -lt serves that stuck-up Amy March right. -What's he going to do to her? l can see there's nothing for me to do but to stop by and show your mother... ...how instead of doing your sums, you cover your slate with sketches. And most uncomplimentary sketches. Please, Mr. Davis, l'll never do it again, sir. And she'd be so disappointed in me. Please. Please. Well, l should hate to spoil her Christmas... ...and for that reason alone, young lady, l shall overlook it. Thank you, Mr. Davis! You may go. Thank you, Mr. Davis. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you, sir. Here she is. -What did he do? -What did he say? Come on, tell us. What happened? l just said that if l ever told my mother the way he treated me... ...she'd take me out of his old school. She's never been ''reconciliated'' anyway... ...since my father lost his money and she's had to suffer the ''degaridation''... ...of me being thrown in with a lot of ill-mannered girls... ...who stick their noses in refined people's business. Little tiny pussy, l'll tell you a long story. -Hannah, is it teatime? -Yes. -l'll set the table. -Thank you, Beth. lt'll be a help to me 'cause my bread's raised. The girls are getting home early. -Are they coming? -Just passing the Laurence house. -Christopher Columbus! -Jo, don't use such dreadful expressions. Here comes old Mr. Laurence. What if he heard you? l don't care. l like good strong words that mean something. Oh, bother. Now we're going to have to speak to him. How do? lt makes my knees chatter just to look at him. l feel sorry for that poor boy, shut up alone with such an ogre for a grandfather. -Look, there he is. -Where? Don't point, Jo. He'll think you're waving at him. He's gone anyway. Well, what if he does? Jo! Come along, Amy. -How's my Beth? -lt's cold outside! Jo just did the most terrible thing. Beth, come over here. -He waved at us. -ls tea ready yet? Merry Christmas from Aunt March. -For me? -Yes, darling, for you. We got one, too. -What are you going to do with it, dear? -l don't know. Marmee said we ought not to spend money for pleasure... ...when our men are suffering so in the Army. A dollar couldn't do the Army much good, so l'm going to buy Undine and Sintram. l've wanted it long enough. l'm sure Marmee would approve if l got some new gloves. l've darned my old ones until l can hardly get them on. She always says a real lady is known by her neat gloves and boots. l shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils. l really need them. Then l'd like to spend mine for some new music... ...that is, if you don't think Marmee would mind. Let's each buy what we want and have a little fun. l'm sure we work hard enough. l know l do. lt's not the work l mind so much. lt's having to tell Flo King how pretty she looks... ...in things l know would look as well on me. What would you do if you were shut up all day with an old crosspatch... ...who flies off the handle every move you make? Jo, don't use slang. Besides, don't forget she gave us the dollar. l'm sure neither of you suffer as l do. You don't have to go to that nasty old Davis' school... ...with impertinent girls who laugh at you and ''label'' your father 'cause he isn't rich. ''Libel.'' Don't say ''label'' as if Papa were a pickle bottle. l know what l mean and you needn't be ''statirical'' about it. lt's proper to use good words and improve your ''vocabilary.'' Aren't we elegant? You'd never be thought so with your slang. l hope not. l don't want to be elegant. -You needn't whistle like a boy. -That's why l do it. -l detest rude, unladylike girls. -And l hate affected, niminy-piminy chicks. Birds in their little nests agree. Really, you're both to blame. You're old enough to leave off boyish tricks and behave better, Josephine. Now you are so tall and turn up your hair, you must remember you're a young lady. No, l'm not. And if turning up my hair makes me so, l'll wear it down till l'm 100. Jo! As for you, Amy, your absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang. Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow into an affected goose... ...unless you take care. lf Jo is a tomboy and Amy's a goose, what am l, please? You're a dear and nothing else. We're three ungrateful wretches who don't deserve you. Wait until l become a famous author and make my fortune. Then we'll all ride in fine carriages, dressed like Flo King... ...snubbing Amy's friends and telling Aunt March to go to the dickens. Let's rehearse. We'll start with the fainting scene. You're as stiff as a poker in that, Amy. Well, l can't help it. l've never seen anyone faint... ...and l don't intend to make myself black-and-blue tumbling as flat as you do. lt's easy if you'll only watch me. Come on. -lf l can drop gracefully, l'll.... -Now, when l come in... ...you'll see the horrible look in my eyes and you shrink back trembling. Go ahead. Get into the mood, Amy. Now, when l start toward you, with wicked intentions.... Oh, Amy, you... ...draw back in horror, covering your eyes with your hands. ''Roderigo, Roderigo! ''Save me, save me! '' There, now you see? Now, it's easy. Now, here l come. ''Roderigo, Roderigo! ''Save me, save me! '' -You were marvelous. -That was lovely. Glad to find you so merry, my girls. -Darling. -Marmee. -How is your cold, Meg? -Much better. Beth, dear, kiss me, baby. Thank you, Jo. Thank you, dear. -You look tired to death, Jo. -No, Marmee, l'm not tired. -Your slippers are all ready now. -That's my Bethie, dearie. Did you have a hard day, Marmee? No, very pleasant, dear. But it's good to be home. -l have a treat for you. -A letter from Father? Three cheers for Father. ''Give them all my dear love and a kiss. ''Tell them l know they will remember all l said to them: ''That they will be loving children to you... ''...they will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely... ''...and conquer themselves so beautifully... ''...that when l come back to them, l may be fonder and prouder than ever... ''...of my little women.'' l am a selfish girl... ...but l'll truly try to be better and not waste my time in school... ...so that Father may not be disappointed in me. l'll try and be what he loves to call me, ''a little woman''... ...and not be rough and wild, and do my duty here at home... ...instead of always wanting to go to war to help Father. l'm not going to be envious anymore, if l can help it. Now, we'll save the rest till after tea... ...for it's such a lovely long letter. l know everybody must be hungry. Let's get something for Marmee with our dollar... ...instead of for ourselves, shall we? That's like you, Beth. What shall we get? -l'll get her a nice pair of gloves. -New slippers, best to be had. Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed. A beautiful little bottle of cologne. She'll like that, and it won't cost much... ...and then l'll have some left over for my pencils. l've finished with Asia. And here is Europe. -Three stitches and you can have Africa. -Not too long stitches, dear. lf you pass me the scissors, l'll give you America. There, you see? You did finish it after all. You wanted to put it off until tomorrow. But we never should have if Jo hadn't made a game of it... ...and thought of talking of the different countries as we worked. lt was a nice idea, Jo. Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim 's Progress when you were little? l can see us all now with your ragbags tied over our backs for burdens. You have real burdens now, instead of ragbags. According to what l heard before tea, except Beth. She didn't say. Maybe she hasn't any. Yes, l have. Mine is dishes and dusters and being afraid of people... ...and envying girls with nice pianos. A piano is a burden. Good night, my precious. Good night, Marmee. -Good night, Jo, my girl. -Good night, Marmee. -Good night, darling. -Good night, my baby. -Good night, Marmee. -Good night, Bethie. -Merry Christmas, Hannah. -Merry Christmas! Where's Marmee? She just went down the street, but she'll be right back. She wants you to have your breakfast when l can get it dished up. Come round here. Hide them. Get close. -Where have you been, Amy? -What have you been doing? Don't laugh, Jo. l only changed the little bottle of cologne... ...for a big one. l gave all my money to get it. -Amy. -Darling. That was unselfish of you. You're some pumpkins, Amy. l felt ashamed, thinking only of myself. Amy, my prettiest rose. And l'm so glad, because mine is the handsomest now. -Where is Marmee? -She'll be back any minute. Breakfast! -Hannah, l'm so hungry. -Hannah, what is it? Sausages! Popovers! They are my favorites! Coffee! Oh, Hannah, you've beat the Dutch. No need to make such a fuss about it. l remember when l used to serve it on your father's table every day. No? -Hannah, were we really that rich? -How was l dressed? l'd like to tell Jenny Snow all the pretty clothes l used to wear. -l can tell her. Diapers! -Jo! Two each. -lsn't this marvelous? -Look at all the popovers. She's coming! Hurry, Beth, strike up. Amy, open the door. Come here, Meg. We'll cover these up and it'll be a surprise. Enter, Marmee. -Merry Christmas, Marmee! -Merry Christmas, my.... Oh, darling! Oh, Meg, dear! Thank you! And handkerchiefs from Bethie. Thank you. Hannah, did you see? Amy, my precious, thank you! These are from me. Jo, my girl. Thank you, darlings. Thank you. Oh, my girls. l can't tell you how happy l am. Well, l can tell you how hungry l am. Come on, everyone. Pass me those plates. -Sit down, Marmee. -Marmee, look! Sausages. Wait a minute, girls. l want to say one word before we begin. l've just come from a poor woman with a little newborn baby... ...and six children huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. They are suffering cold and hunger. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present? l'm so glad you came back before we started. l knew you would. May l carry some things? We shall all go. Take the coffee, Hannah. -l'll get some firewood. -l'll take the cream. l'll take the bread. l'll take the popovers. Here we are, Mrs. Hummel. Gott in Himmel. Good angels come to us. Funny angels, in hoods and mittens. Do you want some bread to eat? Here, l'll give you some bread. Strange that Roderigo is not here. His note says ''promptly on the hour.'' ''And why....'' And why Black Hugo's castle for the tryst? l am afraid. Who comes here? Your Highness, 'tis Mona the hag. Black Hugo hath betrayed thee. l must fly. Zara will be waiting. My proud beauty! She will be mine! Black Hugo approaches. Withered crone, begone! Roderigo, Roderigo! Save me, save me! And now to carry out my fell design. What a fake. Well, l told you l wasn't going to make myself-- Have pity. Oh, have pity! Bring not upon me the worst of shame! Silence, else you'll rue the day you spurned Black Hugo's love. Make thyself ready for the wedding. l shall return within the quarter. Ah, me! Heaven protect the helpless! Zara ! My beloved! Roderigo, durst l believe my eyes? ''The pale stars are twinkling ''The fair moon is rising above ''My guitar is tinkling ''But the notes are not sweet Till they bring me my love'' Courage, my fair. The good padre waits at yonder gate with the horses. See, the ladder. All is arranged. Liberty! Fly with me. Fly with me, my love. l will assist you. l will.... lt's all right, everyone. Stay where you are. Young ladies. Will you all please come in to supper? Christopher Columbus! What's this? ls it fairies? -lt's Santa Claus? -Mother did it? -Aunt March had a good fit and sent it? -All wrong. Mr. Laurence sent it. -No! -Who is Mr. Laurence? The Laurence boy's grandfather. He lives next door. He heard what you did about your breakfast... ...and sent me a nice note... ...saying he hoped l'd allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children... ...and send them a few trifles in honor of the day. The boy put it into his head, l know he did. He looks like a capital fellow and l'm dying to get acquainted. l'm going to, too. l wish Father were here. l'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we are. Hello. How do you do? l wanted to thank you. We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present. What's the matter? Are you sick? Just a little cold, but grandfather's made me stop indoors for a week. That's too bad. Can anybody come to see you? lf they would. Wait, l'll ask Marmee. Close the window now. -How do you do, Miss March? -How do you do, Mr. Laurence? Mother was so sorry to hear that you'd been ill. My sister, Meg, sent you some of her blancmange. lt's soft and will slide down easily without hurting your throat. Thank you. And Beth lent you these until you're well. l know boys don't like kittens, but she was so anxious l couldn't refuse. Maybe they'll help to liven things up. lt's as dull as tombs over here. Won't you come in? No, l'm not to stay. Please. Just for a few minutes. l've ordered tea. Christopher Columbus! What richness! lt's just like summer! This is marvelous! lt's so roomy. How many, please? Two, please. Three. How do you like it here after living in Europe so long, Mr. Laurence? l'm going to Europe. -Really? When? -l don't know. My aunt has rheumatism and the doctor thought the baths.... Not that she hasn't a bath. She has a very nice one. Did you take any baths while you were there? -l mean, for rheumatism. -No, l'm not troubled with rheumatism. Neither am l. But she thought that baths wouldn't do me any harm. l mean, that is to say, while l was there. You see, l've always wanted to go to Europe. Not for the baths, of course, but for my writing. You see, my aunt.... But you don't know Aunt March, do you? Well, never mind. What were you saying, Mr. Laurence? l'm not Mr. Laurence. l'm only Laurie. Laurie. How do you like it here after Europe? lt's strange after living in schools all my life... ...but it will be all right when l get used to Grandfather. You know, he.... Yes, you should have seen him before you came. -lsn't he a holy terror? -You ought to see Aunt March. lt's too pretty to eat. l wish we had things like this over here. And l wish.... lt is nice, isn't it? My little sister put on the geranium leaves. She's very artistic. -Amy? -Yes. How do you know? l often hear you calling to one another... ...and when l'm alone over here.... l beg your pardon for being so rude... ...but sometimes you forget to put down the curtains... ...and when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture... ...to see you all around the table with your mother. You always seem to be having such good times. We'll never draw that curtain anymore. And l give you leave to look as much as you like. l wish instead of just peeping, you'd come over and see us. We'd have jolly times together. Would you let me be in a play? l saw some of it the other night. That was terrible. l want to put on Hamlet and do the fencing scene. l could play Laertes. l took fencing lessons at the academy. -Really? -Yes, look. Look. En garde! -Splendid! -Here. ''Come, for the third, Laertes, you but dally.'' ''Say you so? Come on.'' -''Another hit; what say you?'' -''A touch, a touch, l do confess.'' What is this? What on earth? What's going on? l don't know, sir. ''Have at you now! '' l say.... -Are you hurt? -No. -No, nothing ever hurts me. -l'm sorry. l forgot you were a girl and l'm afraid l got a bit too rough. What are you talking about? l had you bettered if l hadn't slipped. That's a good picture of your grandfather. He looks pretty grim, but l shouldn't be afraid of him. Though l can see how his face might frighten some people. l'll wait upstairs, sir. His eyes are kind and l like him even though he does bark at you so. Thank you, ma'am. So you're not afraid of me? No, sir, not much. But my face will frighten some people? -l only said ''might.'' -And l bark, do l? No, sir, perhaps not all the time. But with all that, you like me? Yes, sir. l do. l do. And l like you. Grandfather, you should see her fence. Come on, let's show him. -No. l've been here too long now. -l'll see you home. No, you stay indoors, young man. l shall see Miss March home. l want to pay my respects to your mother... ...and thank her for the medicine she sent my boy. l can see it's done him lots of good. You get upstairs and do your sums. Brooke is waiting for you. And see that you behave yourself like a gentleman, sir. Goodbye, Jo. Here they come. All dressed up and looking as pretty as pictures. Amy, how dainty. You look lovely. l wish Laurie hadn't asked me to his party. l know l shall be frightened. You wouldn't want to hurt his feelings when he's been so kind. Meg, the dress is lovely. Thank you, Marmee. Jo, you look splendid. l feel perfectly miserable with 19 hairpins... ...all sticking straight into my head, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die. Does the patch show much? lt does a little, Marmee. But she's going to sit down or else stand with her back against the wall. Jo, where are your gloves? l've stained them, so l'm going without. You wear gloves or l don't go. l tried to clean them, but it only made them look worse. l'll carry them and hold them crumpled up in one hand. -Nobody will see them. -Jo! l'll tell you. We'll each wear one of your nice ones... ...and carry one of my bad ones, then the effect will be fine and easy. All right, only be careful of it, and don't stretch it. And, Jo, dear, do behave nicely and don't put your hands behind your back. Good night, Marmee. Above everything, don't say: ''Christopher Columbus! ''... ...and disgrace us all. Hold your tongue, Miss Baby. l'll be as prim as l can be and not get into any scrapes, if l can help it. May l engage you for this dance, Miss March? No, thank you, l'm not dancing. -There's that Kitty Ford. -Where? There in the pink dress and blue sash. l don't see why she's allowed with the grownups and l have to stay up here. That beautiful piano. lt's as big as our kitchen. What's this? Why aren't you young ladies downstairs dancing? Mother said we weren't to go down with the grownups. But can you see anything from here? How about you? She just likes to listen to the music. You just come down with me where it's playing. -No, sir, please. l.... -Why not? What's the matter? She has an infirmity. She's shy. l see. lf it weren't for that, she'd be simply ''fastidious''... ...because she plays beautifully. She must come and play for me sometime. No, she never would. lt wasn't that l wanted to hear her. But that piano down there is simply going to ruin for want of use. l was hoping one of you young ladies would come and practice on it... ...just to keep it in tune. -But if you don't care to come, never mind. -Sir. We do care. Very, very much. So you're the musical one. l'm Beth. l love it dearly... ...and l'll come if you're quite sure nobody will hear me and be disturbed. Not a soul, my child. Not a soul. You come, too, young lady... ...and tell your mother l think all her daughters are simply ''fastidious.'' Beth, isn't he elegant? This is the German, and l'll be hanged if l'll let you refuse me all of them. Don't you like to dance? Yes, l love to dance, but l can't. -l mean, l promised l wouldn't. -Why? -l may as well tell you. You won't tell? -Silence to the death. You see, l have a bad trick of standing in front of the fire... ...and l scorched my frock and l burned this one. Where? You can laugh if you want to. lt is funny. l'll tell you how we'll manage. There's no one in the hall. We could dance there without being seen. -You're a trump. -And l think you're just perfectly splendid. Hello. What are you doing up there? Come on down. No, they can't. Have you had refreshments? No, thank you, we really don't care for-- We'll bring some right up. Come on. Then when Laurie goes to college, what becomes of you? l shall turn soldier as soon as he is off. l am needed. l'm so sorry. l mean, l'm so sorry for all the mothers and sisters... ...who have to stay home and worry. l have neither and very few friends to care whether l live or die. Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal. And we all would be very sorry if any harm came to you. Would you? Here we come. Jo! Now you've done it! -Look at me. -lt's a shame. What a blunderbuss l am. What are you going to do? l'll ask Marmee. Have you two been hiding? l've been looking all over the house for you. Hannah's here. -ls it that late? -Time slips away. -Good night, Mr. Brooke. -Good night, Miss Margaret. Miss Margaret? -Goodbye. l'm glad you came. -We had an elegant time. Good night, Amy. Good night. -Good night, Laurie. -Good night, Miss Margaret. Laurie! Good night, everybody. -Don't forget your ice skates tomorrow. -l won't. -Good night. -Good night. There, l've done my best. lf that won't do, l'll have to wait until l can do better. Why, what are you up to? lt's a pair of slippers l worked for Mr. Laurence. He's been so kind about letting me play on his beautiful piano. l didn't know any other way to thank him, Jo. -Do you think they're all right? -They're beautiful. And l think you're sweet. Hey, isn't that Amy's hair ribbon? Yes, but l think she was going to throw it away. You think? You'd better vamoose before she catches you. Now l'll find out why you come to this hole every day. ls that why you never have any time for me anymore? Laurie Laurence, give that to me or l'll never speak to you again! All right, take it. You're a fine one. l thought we weren't to have any secrets from each other. Well, this is altogether different. l beg your pardon. Of course, it's different. Just like a girl. Can't keep an agreement. Oh, bilge! You'll be sorry. l was going to tell you something very plummy. A secret. All about people you know, and such fun. -What? -lf l tell you, you must tell me yours. -You won't say anything at home? -Not a word. -You won't tease me about it in private? -l never tease. Fire away. l sold my story to the Spread Eagle. Hurrah for Miss March. Hurrah for Miss March! The celebrated American authoress! l didn't want anyone to know until it's out. -Won't it be fun to see it in print? -Now, what's yours? -l know where Meg's glove is. -ls that all? -Wait till you hear where it is. -Where? -How do you know? -l saw it. -Where? -Pocket. -All this time? -lsn't it romantic? ''Romantic''? Rubbish! l never heard of anything so horrid. l wish you hadn't told me. Of all the sickly sentimental.... Why do things always have to change just when they're perfect? Meg always used to tell me everything. Now she keeps things to herself. She thinks brown eyes are beautiful and John is a lovely name. He'd better keep away from me or l'll tell him what l think of him... ...trying to break up other people's happiness and spoil their fun. lt doesn't spoil any fun. lt makes it twice as good. You'll find out when someone falls in love with you. Soft summer day. Sun setting through the trees. Your lover's arms stealing around you. -l'd like to see anybody try it. -Would you? l'll get you! Now l've got you. Wait! Look out, look out! Let me in, let me in! -Hey, look out, Laurie. Don't act like that. -l'm sorry, Meg. l'd have beaten her though if l hadn't tripped and fell. You should have seen.... -lt's been a most enjoyable afternoon. -Thank you. Paying visits has never been quite so much fun before. l hope we may do it again very soon. Goodbye, Mr. Brooke. Come along, Meg. -Good afternoon, Mr. Brooke. -Goodbye, Miss Margaret. -Good afternoon, Laurie. -Goodbye, Jo. -Coming, Laurie? -All right. See you tomorrow, Jo. l've never been so embarrassed in my life. When will you stop your childish romping ways? Not until l'm old and stiff, and have to use a crutch. Jo! -Hello, Bethie. -Hello, Jo. How's my girl? There's a surprise. -Come on and hurry up. -Come on, Jo. What is it? Stop yelling. What is it? Christopher Columbus! For me? lsn't it the most beautiful piano you've ever seen? Look, this came with it. -Quick, read it. See what he says. -l'll read it. ''To Miss Elizabeth March. Dear Madam.'' How elegant. ''l've had many pairs of slippers in my life, but none that suited me as well as yours. ''l like to pay my debts, so l know you will allow me to send you something... ''...that belonged to the little granddaughter l lost. ''With hearty thanks and best wishes... ''...l remain your grateful friend and humble servant, James Laurence.'' Oh, Bethie! -lsn't he a really sweet old man? -Look at these lovely brackets. Look, it opens! -You'll have to thank him. -Yes. l'll go right now. Well, l wish l may die! She'd never have gone in her right mind. Come in. l came to thank you, sir. ''But when the piece began, the dogs, the dames and private ends went mad... ''...and bit the man. ''Around from the neighboring streets the wondering neighbors ran... ''...and swore the dog'd lost his wits to bite so good a man. ''The wound seemed sore and sad to every Christian eye... ''...and while they swore the dog was mad--'' Look, Marmee. Ms. March! Ms. March. lt's one of them telegraph things, ma'am. lt's Father. He's in the hospital. l must go to Washington at once. Put those in the corner, dear. What on earth is keeping Jo? This is all packed, Marmee. -l don't believe l've forgotten a thing. -Thank you, dear. While l'm away, don't forget the Hummel's. -We won't. -We'll do our best, Marmee. Here we are. Here's some excellent port for your husband. -Thank you. How generous. -l hope you find this dressing gown useful. Everything's arranged and Brooke will go with you. There's no need. l'll be fine. He's all prepared. He has commissions for me in Washington. -He'll be of help to you on the journey. -How thoughtful of you. lt's such a relief to know that Marmee will have someone to take care of her. Thank you, very, very much. Not at all, Miss Margaret. My kind friend, l can't thank you.... Laurie's outside with the carriage. We'll wait for you. The train leaves in an hour. Here, ma'am, you'll need this. -l couldn't. -Please, Marmee, take it. Where is Jo? -Jo, what kept you? -Jo, whatever took you so long? Here's the money from Aunt March. And there's my contribution. $25. Where did you get it? -My dear! -lt's mine, honestly. l only sold what belonged to me. Your hair! Jo, you shouldn't have done it. Aunt March croaked, as she always does, when asked for nine pence. Marmee, she only sent you just money enough for the ticket. l knew you would need more... ...so l happened to be going past a barber shop... ...and l saw some tails of hair hanging in the window... ...with the prices marked on them... ...and l thought it would do my brain good to have my mop cut off. And so l did. Thank you, dearie. Are you ready, Marmee? We'll have to hurry to catch.... Christopher Columbus! Well, it's boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order. -Marmee, you'll miss your train. -Yes, Marmee, come on. -Now, girls, go on with your work as usual. -We will, Marmee. Can't we go to the train with you, Marmee? No, l want you all to stay here and comfort each other. Meg, dear, watch over your sisters. Be patient, Jo. Jo, don't do anything rash. Beth, dear, help all you can. Amy, be obedient. No, l want you to stay here. l want to carry away a picture in my mind of my brave little women to take to Father. -Goodbye, my darlings. -Goodbye, Marmee. God bless us and keep us all. Jo, are you awake? Jo, you're crying. No, l'm not. Don't cry, dear. Father will be all right and Mr. Brooke will take care of Marmee. l'm not crying because of that. What then? My hair. ''Yet 'tis whispered that when the gondolas glide through those fatal waters... ''...they still run crimson with the blood of Lady Viella and her gallant lover... ''...slain by the phantom hand. ''The End.'' lt gives me the shivers. l'm pins and needles all over. lt's so exciting and so sad. Who wrote it? Your sister. -Really, Jo? -What? Let me see. -And l knew it all the time. -lsn't that wonderful? Here it is: ''By Miss Josephine March.'' Oh, Jo! l can't believe it! Beth! Jo's written a story and it's in the paper. lsn't that marvelous? -Really? -Look! Don't come near me. Something's wrong with Beth. What is it? -l don't know. -Where is she? ln Marmee's cupboard. What's wrong? What's going on? Darling, what is it? Bethie, what is it? -What's wrong, Bethie? -What is it? The baby's dead. -What baby? -Mrs. Hummel's. lt died in my lap... ...before she got back with the doctor, Jo. Now, there, there. The doctor said it was scarlet fever. -Scarlet fever! -Hannah! You don't think l'll get it, do you, Jo? Oh, no, Bethie, of course you won't. But Amy must keep away 'cause she's never had it. How does it start, Jo? With a sort of a headache and sore throat... ...and queer feelings all over? l don't remember. Laurie, give me that doctor's book. Jo, l think we'd better get her to bed. Come along, Bethie. l'll find out what to do. -l'll be all right. -Of course you'll be all right. Here it is. Go get Dr. Bangs, will you, Mr. Laurie? Have him come over as soon as he can. You stay down here, Amy. You're to go off to Aunt March's for a spell, just in case. l won't! l'll stay right here with Beth. Be quiet for once, Amy! l'm not going to be sent away. l advise you to go, Amy. Scarlet fever's no joke. Well, l don't care! l'd rather get scarlet fever and die than go to Aunt March's. Now, Amy, be a good girl. l'll pop around there every day and tell you how Beth is. l'll tell you what. Every day, l'll come and take you out driving. -Well, yes. -That's our girl. Oh, Bethie, if you should really be ill, l'll never forgive myself. l let you go to the Hummel's every day when l should've gone. No, it's my fault. l'm the oldest and l should've gone. l promised Marmee l'd look after you. Don't you think we ought to telegraph her? No, we mustn't. She can't leave your father and it'll only make her all the more anxious. Please don't telegraph, Jo. Hannah knows just what to do. l feel better already. lf Mrs. March can leave her husband, we'd better send for her. The girls had the telegram all ready, but l wouldn't let them send it. And now, the poor lady. Oh, Mother. What if she shouldn't get here in time? ls it that bad? She doesn't know me. She doesn't look like my Beth. How are we going to bear it? Mother and Father, they seem so far away. l'm here. Hold on to me. Jo, dear. Poor Jo. You're all worn out. What does the doctor say? We're sending for Marmee. lf she were only here. She will be. Grandfather and l got fidgety and thought your mother ought to know. She'd just never forgive us if Beth.... Well, if anything happened... ...so l telegraphed yesterday. She'll be here, on the 2:00 train tonight, and l'm going to meet her. Oh, Laurie! Oh, Marmee! l beg your pardon, but you're such a dear. l couldn't help flying at you. Fly at me again. l rather like it. Laurie, you're so silly. l'd better go. Well, to the railroad station. And l shan't spare the horses. Bless you, Laurie, bless you. lf you really want Bethie... ...please wait until Marmee comes home. But, God, please don't... ...because she's so.... Please don't. lf God spares Bethie... ...l'll love him and serve him all my life. lf life's as hard as this, l don't see how we shall ever get through it. What is it? What is it? Goodbye, my Bethie. Goodbye. The fever's turned. -She's sleeping naturally. -The Lord be praised. Marmee's here. She's come. lt's so wonderful to have Bethie with us. Come on, everything's all ready. ls she all right? She's not very heavy, is she? lt didn't tire you, did it, dear? See the lovely flowers Mr. Laurence sent you. And my birds. l've never been so happy. Begging your pardon, do the Marches live here? Wait till she sees what l brought for her. Father, dear. Father, is it really you? l can't believe she's walking. -Oh, my dear. -She hasn't walked since she was ill. Are you expecting someone? Why, no. What do you mean? Why can't we stay as we are? Do you have to go and fall in love... ...and spoil all our peace and fun and happy times together? You're not like your old self a bit. And you're getting so far away from me. Meg, don't. Don't go and marry that man. l don't intend to go and marry any man. And if you mean Mr. Brooke, he hasn't asked me. lf he should, l shall merely say quite calmly and decidedly: ''l'm sorry but l agree with Mother that it's too soon.'' Oh, Meg! Hurrah for you! You're a trump. My hair. Then things will be as they used to be, and now that Father's home-- l'll go. l'll get out of the way. Now don't forget. lf l could only see his face when you tell him. Why, Mr. Brooke. Good day, Miss Margaret. Won't you come in? l came to get my umbrella. That is to see how your father finds himself today. Why, he's here in the rack. l mean, it's very well. l mean.... l'll tell him you're here. Oh, please. Are you afraid of me, Margaret? How could l be when you've been so kind to Father? l only wish l could thank you for it. You can. -Shall l tell you how? -No. Please don't. l only want to know if you care for me a little, Meg. l love you so much, dear. Thank you, John. l agree with Mother, it's too soon. l'll wait. l don't mind how long or how hard l have to work... ...if l can only know l'm to have my reward in the end. Please, give me a little hope. l'm afraid l can't. Do you really mean that? What's this? What's he doing here? Get along. What's going on here? Who is that? Mr. Brooke. The Laurence boy's tutor. Then it's true. He might hear you. He's been so kind to Father. Well, he'll be much kinder if he goes about his own business... ...and leaves you alone. l won't stop. l'm only thinking of your own good, Margaret. You should make a rich match to help your family. This rude person has no money, no position in life. That doesn't mean he never will have. So he's counting on my money. He knows you've got rich relatives. Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing. My John wouldn't marry for money any more than l would. l'm not afraid of being poor. And l know we shall be happy because John loves me and l love him. Hoity-toity. Remember this, young lady: lf you marry this rook or hook or crook, he'll take care of you. Not one penny of my money will he get. My darling, did you mean it? l came back for my umbrella and l couldn't help hearing. Then you will give me leave to work for you and love you? Yes, John. ''And there to have given and pledged their troth each to the other... ''...and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and by joining hands... ''...l pronounce that they are man and wife. ''ln the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. ''Amen.'' ''God the Father, God the Son... ''...and God the Holy Ghost... ''...bless, preserve and keep you... ''...that ye may so live together in this life... ''...that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting. ''Amen.'' The first kiss for Marmee. Well, John, you've been a traitor. l hope you'll take care of her. You're a lucky fellow, John. -Goodbye, Amy. -Goodbye. Don't mind, Jo. You've still got me. l'm not good for much, l know... ...but l'll stand by you... ...all the days of my life. l know you will. You don't know what a comfort you are to me, Laurie. -Jo-- -No, don't say it. l will, and you must hear me. lt's no use, Jo. You've kept away from me ever since l got back from college. l studied so hard and l graduated with honors, all for you. -l know, and l'm so proud of you. -Then won't you listen? Please. l've loved you ever since l've known you. l couldn't help it. l've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me. Now l'm going to make you hear it and give me an answer... ...for l just can't go on so any longer. l know l'm not half good enough for you. But if you love me, you can make me anything you like. As though l'd change you, Laurie. You should marry some lovely, accomplished girl who adores you. Someone who would grace your beautiful home. l shouldn't. l loathe elegant society and you like it. And you hate my scribbling and l can't get on without it. And we should quarrel. -No, we shouldn't. -Yes, we always have, you know. Everything would be horrid if we were ever foolish enough to-- Marry? No, it wouldn't, Jo. lt would be heaven. Don't disappoint us, dear. Don't. Everybody expects it. Grandfather has set his heart on it. And l just can't go on without you. Please, say you will. l can't. Laurie, l'm sorry. So desperately sorry. l'm so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you. l don't know why l can't love you the way you want me to. l've tried, but l can't change the feeling... ...and it would be a lie to say l do if l don't. Really truly, Jo? Really truly, dear. l don't think l'll ever marry. Yes, you will. You'll meet some good-for-nothing, no-account idiot... ...and you'll fall in love with him, and work, live and die for him. l know you will. lt's your way. And l'll have to stand by and see it. Well, l'll be hanged if l do. Where are you going? To the devil, and l hope you'll be sorry. Laurie, please.... Why aren't you in bed? lt's late. Mother, l want to go away. l mean, just for a little while. l don't know. l feel restless and anxious to be doing something. l'd like to hop a little way and try my wings. Where would you hop? To New York. l've thought about it a lot lately. You can spare me now. l could go to Mrs. Kirke's and help with the children as part of my board. lt wouldn't cost much, and l'd see and hear new things... ...and get a lot of new ideas for my stories. l don't doubt it. Jo, nothing's happened between you and Laurie? Don't be surprised, dear. Mothers have to have sharp eyes... ...especially when their daughters keep their troubles to themselves. Oh, Marmee, l'd have told you, only l thought it would blow over... ...and it seemed kind of wrong to tell Laurie's poor little secret. lt's only that he's got a foolish romantic notion in his head... ...and l think if l go away for a time, he may get over it. l see. And how do you feel about this ''foolish romantic notion''? l love him dearly as l always have. l feel as though l've stabbed my dearest friend. And yet, l don't want to make a mistake. You're right, Jo. l think it would be a good idea for both your sakes. Now, come to bed, dear. l'll talk to Father about it. And if he agrees, we'll write to Mrs. Kirke. -Good night, dear. -Good night, Marmee. Now, my dear, l think l've told you everything... ...and it will be a great load off my mind knowing the children are safe with you. l'm very busy so l'll have Mamie show you to your room. Mamie! l've given you a little inside room. lt's all l had... ...but it has a table and you can use it for your writing. That's great. Mamie! You must come down here some after dinner and be sociable. l promised your mother l wouldn't let you be homesick... ...and l have only the most refined people in my house. Mamie! Here l am, Ms. Kirke. Mamie, this is Miss Josephine. Will you take her up to her room and find the children? l'll see you later, my dear. Right this way, please. Children, children! They ain't a bad lot but, my stars, they take a deal of handling. Jimmy! Kitty! You heard me. Come on out, l know where you are. The bear's going to eat my baby. Save my poor baby. My baby! Don't eat my baby! Professor! l beg your pardon. Please. l'm so sorry. This is Miss Josephine what's got you in charge now. -Hello. -How do you do? -And this is Professor Bhaer. -How do you do? -Come on, let's finish the game. -l want to play some more. That is for Miss Josephine to say, but we've frightened her already. Oh, no, but l didn't expect to meet a grizzly bear in the upper hall. Mamie, wait. The back is too young to carry such heavy loads. Come on, children, let's play soldiers. Tina, you are the general. You're the captain. And here, Lieutenant. Forward march! He's such a lovely man. l know he must've been a gentleman sometime or other... ...but he's as poor as a church mouse now. What does he do? He's a professor, see? He learns them how they talk in foreign countries. l don't know what good it does them when they're living right here. Good evening, my little friend, good evening. Please, don't stop. lt was beautiful. l've heard you play it often and wanted to ask you what it was. l'd so like to send it to my little sister. Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt. The words are by Goethe. Do you speak German? Then l'd better give it to you in English. Let's see now. ''Only who knows what longing is ''Can know what l suffer ''Alone and parted far from joy and gladness ''My senses fail ''A burning fire devours me ''My senses fail ''A burning fire devours me'' l know how he felt. Tchaikovsky did, also. That is why he wrote this beautiful, heartbreaking music. lf only l could write something like that. Something splendid that would set other hearts on fire. That is genius. Do you wish to write, my little friend? Yes, that's my longing. l've sold two stories already since l've been here. That is very good. l'd like to read them. May l? Would you? l'd so like to know your opinion. l would be very happy. You have the ardent spirit. l like that. What shall l ask for at the music shop? l think l'd better write it down for you. Well, now, here is a teacher without a pencil. Let me sew that button for you before you lose it. No, l sew on buttons. Not very well, evidently. Well. -Who was Goldilocks, a little girl? -Yes. ''And she... ''...went into their house... ''...and saw three chairs. ''Three chairs. ''One was the baby one, one was the daddy one... ''...and one was the mommy one. ''So she sat down in the big one.... ''And it was too hard.'' Miss Josephine, you're to go to the parlor right away. Someone to see you. -Who is it? -l can't tell you. lt's a surprise. All right, children, that will be all for today. Now run along and wash your hands and faces for tea. -l'll finish the story tomorrow. -All right. -Who is it, Mamie? -l can't tell you. lt's a surprise. Are these some of your new stories? Oh, they look... ...creepier than The Duke's Daughter. Can l read them? Yes, if you want to. '' The Place of the Coventrys or The Secret of a Guilty Heart... ''...by Josephine March.'' Then it's true. -Amy! -Darling! -Aunt March! -Josephine. l'm so glad to see you. What took you so long to get down? Tell me everything. We can't stop now. We've got to get to the shipping office before it closes. Shipping office? Aunt March, Europe? l'm taking Amy with me. Well, maybe you can go next time. Next time? Tell me, is Meg all right? And Marmee and Father? And how's my Beth? She's better again, but she isn't rosy as she used to be. Oh, my poor Beth. Why doesn't she get strong? And Laurie? Didn't you see them when they were here? He and his grandfather have been in Europe for weeks. Laurie in New York? And didn't come to see me? l'm sure you can't blame him after the way you picked up... ...and trotted off without so much as saying goodbye to any of us. l think you've treated everybody shamefully. Come along, Amy. Jo, dear, l wish it were you. l know how you've always longed to go. No, darling. lt's your reward. You've always done sweet things to please Aunt March. Think of all the wonderful things you are going to see: The Turners, the Raphaels and the Leonardos. You seem to forget waiting cabs cost money. That's the trouble with folks who never had anything. Easy come, easy go. We'll be right back, Josephine. Goodbye, darling. Miss Josephine? Yes, Professor Bhaer. l have read your stories and l would like to return them to you. Will you please come in? Yes, thank you. Did you like them? Well, Miss March, l must be honest. l was disappointed. Why do you write such artificial characters... ...such artificial plots, villains, murderers and such women? Why don't you write a.... Miss March, please. l am so sorry. l didn't want to hurt you. l wanted to help you. What a blundering fool l am. lt isn't that. Please, don't pay any attention to me. Forgive me, please. Come, sit down. Forgive me. No, it's just that everything seems to come at once. The rest doesn't matter so much. l can bear that. But Laurie, l can never get over Laurie. Herr Laurie, your friend. -Something has happened to him? -Yes. No, something has happened to me. He came to New York and he didn't even come to see me. What a fool he must be. No, it's my fault. But l thought that.... What does it matter what l thought? l've made a mess of it as l do of everything. But l have tried and when l think of Aunt March taking Amy to Europe... ...when she always promised she'd take me... ...not that l begrudge Amy the trip, but.... l suppose that's just what l am doing. That trip to Europe that you so looked forward to. That is too bad. That is a cruel disappointment, l know. On top of it, that stupid professor. He comes blundering and makes things worse. No. lf l can't stand the truth, l'm not worth anything. l didn't think those stories were so very good. But you see... ... The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill... ...and the Curse of the Coventrys was the blessing of the Marches... ...because it sent Marmee and Beth to the seashore. Yes, that is what l have thought. And then l have said to myself: ''l maybe have no right to speak.'' But then again, l said to myself: ''l maybe have no right to be silent.'' Miss March, you have talent. -Do you really think so? -Otherwise l could not say. And you know that. And l say to you, ''Sweep mud on the street first... ''...before you are false to that talent.'' Say to yourself: ''l will never write one single line which l have not heard in my own heart.'' Say to yourself, ''While l am young... ''...l will write these simple, beautiful things that l understand now. ''Maybe later, when l am a little older and l have felt life more... ''...then l will write about these poor wretches... ''...but l will make them live and breathe like my Shakespeare did.'' -Will you do that, my little friend? -Yes, l'll try. But l don't think l'll ever be a Shakespeare, do you? But you can be a Josephine March. And l assure you that is plenty. And now, don't be disappointed about that trip. -Here. -Peppermint, good. Those of us who have been all over the Old World... ...can find many things in the New... ...that are beautiful and young. Miss March, it would give me great pleasure... ...if l could show you some of these things while you are here. lf you would care to have so. Thank you. Then you are not angry with the blundering professor... ...who takes the wrong times for his lectures? How could l be? Auf Wiedersehen, my little friend. Did you really like it? -l never had such a.... -Happy, my little friend. She was divine. l don't want to be a writer anymore. l want to be a wonderful singer and thrill thousands of people... ...so that they cheer and throw flowers at me like that. Bravo. Bravo. But l wouldn't make up my mind so soon... ...because at the art museum you wanted to be a sculptress... ...at the circus you thought the bareback rider... ...was the most beautiful thing in the world. l know, but to sing like that! l forgot. Something inside me tonight makes me want to shout. What would you shout? l'd say, ''Look at me, world. l'm Jo March and l'm so happy.'' My little friend, you are happy. You haven't missed much lately your home and your old friends? But you're responsible for that. Maybe they haven't missed me so much either. They're so busy with Meg and those blessed babies. Yes, how are those remarkable twins? Wonderful. Meg's so proud of them. Have you heard from Europe? Nearly every boat brings a letter from Amy. And your friend... ...Herr Laurie, have you heard from him? Only through Amy. They met at Vichy and had a wonderful time together. Miss March, l am bold to ask a favor. Would you give me the address of your father? l wish to write him and ask him something. Why, yes. He'd be so happy to hear from you. They almost know you. l've told them all about you. And they always ask after you in their letters. -Really? -Yes, now l'll show you. This is so nice. Not l hope.... lt's Beth. She's.... l must go at once. My friend, can l do something for you? l'm sure there is something l can do. No, there's nothing. Thank you. Oh, Jo... ...to think you're home. lf Amy were here, we'd all be together. She'll be home in the spring, darling. And l'm going to have you all well and rosy by then. Poor Jo, you mustn't be afraid. Doesn't that sound funny... ...me saying that to you when you've always said it to me? You've always reminded me... ...of a seagull, strong and wild... ...and fond of the wind and the storm... ...dreaming of flying far out to sea. And Mother always said that l was like a little cricket... ...chirping contentedly on the hearth... ...never able to bear the thought of leaving home. But now... ...it's different. l can't express it very well. l shouldn't try to, to anyone but you... ...because l can't speak out to anyone but my Jo. l'm not afraid anymore. l'm learning that l don't lose you, that you'll be more to me than ever... ...and nothing can part us, though it seems to. Oh, Jo. l think l'll be homesick for you even in heaven. The little loves. -l'm afraid they're tiring you. -Oh, no. lt's time for my little regiment to take its nap. -They're sweet. -Yes. l think l can sleep now. Look, Jo, my birds. They got back in time. -Bethie! -Mother! My daughter! Bethie! Oh, Marmee. We mustn't cry. We must be glad she's well at last. No, Marmee, don't cry. lf only there were another boat leaving sooner. Now, my dear, you've been so brave, you must be patient. We're going back on the very first boat. l still think you should obey your mother and stay. l know. But l'm sick for home, Aunt March. l hate all this now. lf it weren't for this, l'd have been there, at least to say goodbye. Laurie, l knew you'd come. My child! Mr. Laurence! Amy, we were in Germany, and Marmee's letter had to be forwarded... ...but l came the moment l got it because.... Well, you must comfort me now, too. l'm so thankful you're here. l haven't known what to do with the child. Perhaps you can persuade her to stay. -The elegant young matron. -Hello, Jo, dear. l've Sally Moffat's carriage. l'm making some calls. You want me to mind the demons while you're gone? No, l want you to go with me. Jo, dear. lt's a lovely day and l want to talk to you. Talk to me now. You know l can't bear calls. -How's your story coming? -Sent it off yesterday. -Without us reading it? -You can read it when they send it back. -l had a letter from Amy. -So did Marmee. They're in Valrosa now and she says it's paradise. Jo, l'd like to ask you something. l've been wondering... ...how would you feel... ...if you should hear that your Laurie was learning to care for somebody else? Meg, who? Amy? l don't know. l can't be sure. l'm only reading between the lines. Then you wouldn't mind? No, Meg. How could l? l think it would be wonderful, don't you? Yes, but l wasn't quite sure. Forgive me, dear... ...but l have so much and you seem so alone. l thought lately that maybe if Laurie came back-- No, dear. lt's better as it is. And l'm glad if he and Amy are learning to love each other. You're right about one thing though. l am lonely and maybe if Laurie had come back... ...l might've said yes. Not because l love him any differently, but because... ...it means more to me now to be loved than it used to. Laurie. Oh, my Laurie! Jo, dear. Are you glad to see me? Glad? My blessed boy! Words can't express my gladness. And where's your wife? They all stopped in at Meg's, but l couldn't wait to see you. They'll be along presently. Let me look at you. Don't l look like a married man and the head of a family? Not a bit, and you never will, although you have grown bigger and bonnier. But you're the same scapegrace as ever, despite that very elegant mustache. -You can't fool me. -You have to treat me with more respect. Jo, dear, l want to say one thing, then we'll put it by forever. No, Laurie, please. l think it was always meant to be, you and Amy. lt would have come about naturally if only you'd waited. As you tried to make me understand. But you never could be patient. So then we can go back to the happy old times? The way you wanted it, when we first knew one another. We never can be boy and girl again, Laurie. Those happy old times can't come back. We shouldn't expect them to. We're man and woman now, we can't be playmates any longer. But we can be brother and sister, to love and help one another... ...all the rest of our lives, can't we, Laurie? There they are. You look very well, Aunt March. After the money spent on my rheumatism, l come home on a day like this. Heaven's to Betsy. lf she ain't dressed in silk from head to foot. Where is she? Where is Jo? -Jo! -Amy! Doesn't she look marvelous, Jo? l'll never forgive myself for staying away so long... ...and leaving you to bear everything all alone. Darling. To think that only yesterday we were pulling our hair and buttoning pinafores. And now she's a grown-up married lady with a bustle. You must be famished. l'll help Hannah with the tea. No, you won't, Marmee. You'll sit right here. l'll help Hannah. lt's fun, isn't it, Bethie? Now that we're all together again. Oh, dear. l've got to get some milk. l haven't enough for my babies. l'll go. -But it's raining cats and dogs. -l love it. Sakes alive! There's the front doorbell. -ls this the residence of Miss March? -Why, yes. -Miss Josephine March? -Yes. May l speak with her? She's out, but l'm expecting her back any minute. -Won't you come in? -Thank you. No, thank you. She has guests, no. Thank you very much. But will you please give this to her and tell her Professor Bhaer left it? Thank you. Professor Bhaer. Thank you very much. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Herr Professor. -My little friend. l was just here to leave your book. l wanted to tell you my friend published it, and he has great hopes. -He thinks-- -Never mind what he thinks. Did you like it? My little friend, it has such truth, such simple beauty. ln English quick, l cannot tell you what it gives my heart. But you were going without telling me. lf l hadn't come back, l never would've seen you again. -Come, you're getting wet. -l couldn't intrude. You have guests. No, only my family. My sister has just come home. She is married to that boy l told you about. -Herr Laurie? -Yes. This is the first time we've all been together for a long time. Please, just one moment before.... l had a wish to ask you something. Would you.... l have no courage to think that.... But could l dare hope that.... l know l shouldn't make so free as to ask. l have nothing to give but my heart so full and these empty hands. Not empty now. Heart's dearest! Welcome home., - Did you bring my band of Indians? - Indians? Yes, American Indians, musicians to play in my caf. - Oh, you mean Indians with feathers? - Yes, with noses. - Like on the American five cents? - Yes, yes. - Have you got them on board, yes? - No. Thank you, monsieur. Indians? Indians? Are you the Wabash Indians Band? Are you Voyda? I am Alexander Petrovitch Moskovich Voyda. Let's pick it up from there. We're the boys you hired to play at your caf. - The Wabash Indianians. - Indianians? Is this the same as Indians? Well, yes, in a sense. You see, we don't wear our feathers in warm weather, do we, boys? - No. - No, never, never. - Well, when do we start, Mr. Voyda? - You don't start. I cable for Indians and I want Indians! No pale American face is going to make me a fool of myself. Did you ever heard of Alexander Petrovitch Moskovich Voyda? - Sure. - Yes, and how, and how. As a matter of fact, we hear you're one of the cleverest fellows in Paris. In Paris and all Europe. The whole world. Well, I was coming to that. I just wanted to prepare you, that's all. You got a great bet in these boys, Mr. Voyda. - They'll be a knockout in your caf. - They shall never see my caf. I ordered Indians, and what do I get? Wait, Mr. Voyda. Huck, do the organ number, quick. Come on, boys, give us the organ number. Get the gloves out. - Oh, Mr. Voyda. - What? Aren't you going to give these boys a chance? No, why should I? Sorry, Mr. Voyda, but I'm afraid you've got to listen. Just submit quietly and we'll both keep out of jail. Well, how did you like that, Mr. Voyda? You see, you almost made a mistake. I made a mistake? You made a mistake. You are not Indians! The cable mentioned a short engagement. Well, it was a nice trip over. It'll be a nicer trip going back, stoking coals. Come on, boys, the train for Paris. A grand total of $13.78. And a button. Well, boys, at the rate we live, that'll last us about two months. Mother told me there would be days like this. Say, listen, they dance in Paris, don't they? All we have to do is find out who pays the fiddler. Does anyone know anyone in Paris? That top sergeant brother of mine gave me some addresses. Quiet. Wait! I know somebody, a little girl who used to live next door to me. Gee, I was crazy about her, too. She's a sensation in Paris, she's a star of some show or something. - She'll help us. - Well, what's her name? What was her name? Gee, I could find her like that if I could only remember her name. Anybody else you know you can't remember? Yeah, but I can't think who they are. I know, it's Lizzie, Lizzie... Elizabeth Gatz. That's it. Elizabeth Gatz. What a beautiful name. Whether you find your Lizzie or not, I've got an aunt in Paris. Aunt Minnie. Can Aunt Minnie use a band? Probably not. She's a dressmaker. Well, I've knitted and tatted all my life, but I've never sewed. - She's very rich and famous. She might... - Why didn't you say so before? She's Roberta. Roberta? - This Roberta? - Yeah. They tell me in Paris if you don't buy your gowns from Roberta, you're not dressed at all. I see, nude if you don't, and nude if you do. Grab my bag, will you? Listen, ask your aunt Minnie if she knows where we can find Lizzie Gatz, will you? - Okay. I won't be long. - All right. You fellows pick yourselves some comfortable easy chairs. Hey! Hey! What am I supposed to do here besides pray? Or can't you speak English? Well, the old trap won't go. Oh, what's the use? Just a dumb foreigner. Oh, here, here, here. You mustn't do that. You might be killed. Oh, you speak English. Ladislaw. Oh, don't go away. I want to thank you. Gee, you saved my life. I'm ever so much obliged to you. Oh, it's nothing at all. Oh, I mean you're welcome, of course. Do you know where I can find Madam Roberta? Yes. Come with me. I didn't really mean that about a dumb foreigner. I forgive you. Gee, that's swell. You speak English beautifully. Long ago I went to school in England. Did you like it? Oh, yes, I like the English. And the Americans, too. Gee, that's swell. - I'm an American. - Gee, that's... I mean, I thought so. Will you sit here, please? Thank you. But Minnie, you've made a mistake in the year. You don't look a day over... - Stephanie! - How do you do, Lord Henry? My dear. I saw your cousin, Prince Peter, last week in Rome. He asked after you most solicitously. I hope you told him I had gone to work and he should do the same. When all you titled aristocrats get jobs, maybe Europe can settle down to a few years' peace. What is it, Stephanie? There's a young gentleman outside from America, waiting to see you. Young gentleman from America? John. John! Bring him in, Stephanie. Bring him in! No, wait. Don't let him come until I've powdered my nose. Give me that compact, Henry. Quick, quick, the compact! How does he look? He must look all right. - Send him in, Stephanie. - Yes, madame. - This ""John from America"", who is he? - My nephew. I met him when I was there a few years ago and took a great fancy to him. He's quite famous in his way. ""All-American halfback"" or ""three quarters back"" or something. - Really? - Yes, you know, it's queer, but when you happen to like your relatives, you like them better than other people. - And if you hate them? - Don't be obvious, Henry. He was the only one of the whole tribe who was polite to me during my entire visit. I like him, Henry. He's like a big, affectionate, blundering Newfoundland dog. I'd like to see him grow up. - How big is he now? - Oh, about 6'2"". John, my dear, I'm so glad to see you. It's swell to see you, Aunt Minnie. - Here he is, Henry, here is my... - Newfoundland dog? I was telling him about you, John. This is Lord Henry Delves, a really grand person. And this is Stephanie, my able assistant whom I couldn't do without. Well, young man, I think your aunt should be very much complimented. When I was in Paris at your age, I didn't spend my time visiting my aunts. Maybe you didn't have any aunts like Aunt Minnie. Very prettily said, John. There aren't any like your aunt Minnie. Well, goodbye, young man, I'm off to catch a train, but in a fortnight I'll be back. And then, as I understand is the custom in your country, we'll go places and do something. Goodbye, Minnie, miss me just a little, won't you? A very great deal, my dear. Nice old duck, isn't he? Oh, he isn't so terribly old. Oh, I didn't mean in years, Aunt Minnie. I meant I like him. Do you? Then you're a good judge of men. Now, tell me about this young lady you wrote me about. What was her name? Sophie. She's given me the air. What? We had a row. Oh, I thought she'd given you an heir. She must be very stupid. Oh, no, she's brilliant, really. She speaks German and French and everything. Here's her picture. It isn't very good of her, though. She has her points. I take it you're smarting over this air she has given you. Well, I'm still in love with her. But she says I'm just a hick. - A what? - A farmer. I've got hay in my hair. I can't talk on any subject, - I can't dance, I can't even dress myself. - Ridiculous. And I don't know anything about women's clothes, and when I have to order dinner it's always meat, potatoes and pie. Oh, she says that, does she? Well, we'll show her she's wrong. Gosh, John's been in there a long while. Oh, why didn't we go to a hotel first? Man, I'm hungry. Come on, Mac, give him the call. That's my gang. - I came over with a band. - A band of what? An orchestra. They're the Wabash Indianians, hired for a job in Paris and fired through a misunderstanding. Now they're looking for an engagement. They're a swell bunch. They do that rather prettily. Madame, Scharwenka wants to see you. She doesn't like her tissue. She doesn't like the model, she doesn't like the fit, and she doesn't like the price. Oh, you mean she doesn't like it. Yes, madame, what will you do about it? Do about it? Let her go. She'll come back. She's the rage here right now, and she's got the best figure in Europe, but she has to have it dressed, at least partly. I'm afraid she intends to start her screaming. If she does, stick a pin in her. Oh, I'd rather use an ice-pick. This time I left the door open. Who is she going to stick a pin into? Scharwenka, a Polish countess who has spurned the hollow mockeries of society and gone in for nightclub entertaining. You can see she's talented. Do you allow her to make such a noise? - lf she enjoys it, why not? - Well, suppose the police come in? Good, they can take her away. But she must be insane to make such a row. Stephanie may not be safe with her. - You feel inclined to stop her? - Yes, I do. No, no, no, no, no! You are not the only couturier in Paris! I am a good advertising for the house that dresses me! I do not know why I come to Roberta anyway! You... Will you quit pushing me? I... I beg your pardon. You can't behave like that, you know. You big beautiful American! You are very strong. You do not understand. These Latin races must be shouted at. I'm not a Latin and shouting doesn't impress me. Hey. I shall never set foot in this place again. You do not know how they have treated me. This horrible old woman here. The greedy old diable. Easy, she's my aunt. Oh, well, I was not blaming it on her. She is really a genius, but that little shrew who runs the business. That Stephanie... But Stephanie is swell. What, you are her lover? I've never seen such a place. No one thinks of anything but being somebody's lover. Well, have you never thought of it? What happened? Your nephew has done most admirably, madame. What did he do? Where is Scharwenka? On his neck. Oh, I see. Does he like it? Not particularly. But I don't hear him shouting for help. There's that cuckoo band again. Scharwenka! Do you think she'd do something for my nephew if he asked her? I don't think he'll even have to ask her. No, no, no. I mean something for this band of his. She could get them an engagement and if they're John's friends, they're a swell band. I must show you Paris, and I want you to love it. - I've seen the Eiffel Tower. - Oh, no. My dear Countess. I understand there are a few things wrong with the gown. You shall have a new model, at a new price. Oh, there's nothing wrong with the gown. I'll be back tomorrow for another fit. May I present my nephew, John? Oh, he presented himself most charmingly. My nephew is paying me a visit en route to London, he has a band which is playing at a private party for the Duke of Wattingham. I should like to hear your orchestra sometime. Now. There's no time like now. Now, hang on to your hat. Hey, fellows! Strike it up. It's a job. Come on, boys, let's give them the Let's Begin number. - Come on, get over here. - Come on, man, get over there. All right, boys, let's swing it. Now that you've got me going what you gonna do? Is it up to me or is it up to you? What kind a game is this we've begun? Was it done just for fun? Don't forget since we've met There's no reason for vain regret. Oh Is this to be a case of ""fall and glad I fell, kiss and never tell ""Folly and farewell?"" Which is going to be ""might have been ""Lose or win? Let's begin"" I'm here to tell you, let's begin Now that you've got me going what you gonna do? Is it up to me, or is it up to you? What kind of game is this we've begun Was it done just for fun? - No - Realize that I'm wise And please stop rolling those big blue eyes Is this to be a case of ""Fall and glad I fell ""Kiss and never tell, folly and farewell?"" Which is going to be ""might have been""let's begin Let's begin - I think I saw... - Huck, it looks like you're all set. - You remember the girl I told you about? - She likes the band. Well, I was out there dancing. I looked up and I saw... Quiet, quiet, quiet! - You're going in to meet a Polish countess. - I don't want to meet any countess. - But she can give the band a job. - I don't care what she can... - Who, who can? She can? - Yeah! - Well, that's different. - No cracks, now. I think they're very good. Aunt Minnie, this is my friend Huck Haines. My nephew has told me about you. Countess, may I present Monsieur Huck Haines? Countess? - Well, if it isn't... - Huck is for Huckleberry, n'est-ce pas? Yes, and a couple of n'est-ce pas. Mr. Haines is the piccolo player I was telling you about. Ah! Piccolo player. How charmant. No, no, no, madame. Pas de piccolo. I play what you call a filthy piano. May I present myself, Le Marquis de Indiana. Ah, Indiana, a province in the south of Greece, eh? No, no, no, Madame la Comtesse. Just west of Pittsburgh, babe. Hey, ix-nay acking-cray. These Americans are what you call fresh guys. No, no, no. Refreshing. Oh, mais oui. Refreshing. Pardon, monsieur. It is nothing, toots. I should like to talk to this refreshing, filthy piano, alone. Oh, certainly, certainly. Is he a lunatic? Oh, no, that's merely his way of making her feel at home. Oh! Now, listen here, Huck Haines... No, no, no, no. What a charming surprise. This little tete-a-tete with you, alone. Huck, please. What's the racket, Liz? Did you marry the title or just lift it? Be a pal, will you, Huck? It's just a stage name. You've got to have a title to croon over here. I know. Gee, Lizzie, you look grand. Look, I promise to get you a job if you won't tell on me. - Okay, Liz. - And it's not Liz. I'm sorry, Princess? Baroness? Oh, what is it? You may call me Tanka. - Tanka. - You're welcome. It's swell seeing you again, Tanka. But what about that job for the boys? Madame Roberta is having tea in her sitting room, and she would like you to join her, if you'd care to. Oh, I am so sorry. But you will tell Madame Roberta that I have an engagement with the Marquis de Indiana? Yes, Countess. Well, now, I guess I've got you to add to my worries. It's time for your nap. Stephanie, my child, I'm adding to your many duties. We're going to make John over. I think he's very nice as he is. A good tailor never hurt a man, no matter how nice he is. That's Ladislaw. The doctor makes me take a nap every afternoon and Stephanie thinks that music helps me go to sleep. Ladislaw is our doorman and a prince. A prince, your doorman? A Russian prince. If there were such a thing as a restoration, Ladislaw would be in line for the throne. Ladislaw, I hope you're in good finger today. - This is my nephew, Mr. Kent. - Glad to know you. Are you comfortable? I want a drink of water. Don't stand there, Ladislaw. Play something. Play something. You'll wake her. You're darn right, you will. I'll be hard to handle I promise you that and if you complain here's one little Jane that will leave you flat I'll be hard to handle What else can I be? Just ask my dad the trouble he had controlling me I have faults, to be specific In a temper, oh I'm terrific I throw chairs and tables and I never miss Oh, I'm as cold as any shellfish I tell lies, I'm mean, I'm selfish Think it over, my warning is this I'll be hard to handle, I'm making it plain now just be a dear and scram out of here cause I'm gonna raise Cain I'm as cold as any shellfish I tell lies, I'm mean, I'm selfish Think it over my warning is If you want me sweet and hot Oh, I'll be hard to handle I'm making it plain Now just be a dear and scram out of here Nice work, Countess, nice work. Oh, well. That was pretty good, boys but listen, Candy, give me a better pick-up after that second break, will you? Okay. Okay, boss. You know, this reminds me of the old days when we used to give shows in your barn. Yeah, we used to fight over who handled the gate receipts. You remember the valentine I sent you? The one with the arrow piercing the heart and dripping blood? Oh, yes, I remember that. I think that's the only valentine I ever received. It's the only one I ever sent. Those were the happy days, weren't they? Do you know, I think I was in love with you then, Huck. - I know you were. - You. Me. And what's more, I was madly in love with you. - Oh, we were funny kids, weren't we? - Oh, I suppose so. Remember that beauty contest I won? - Oh, you got a trip to Kansas City. - Yeah, well you won it for me. How did you get all those men from the overall factory to vote for me? That was easy. I showed them a picture of Lillian Russell. Lillian Russell? What was the matter with my picture? Well, if you must know, we got a lot of votes from the farmers with a picture of a prize heifer. Oh, you. He is coming now. Listen, Huck, give it to him and make it sweet and hot. Come on, boys, the big boss is coming. Let's jam it. What's that? You want an orchestra. I have got one for you. You are tearing your hair to get good music, I bring it to you. I take them away from the Duke of Wattingham, just to give it to you. You give it to me? How much does it cost? What does it matter? Listen to them. They are good. They are very good. They are hired. I am glad I didn't take those white-faced Indians. I think maybe sometimes I am wrong. But this orchestra is superb. And who did it for you? Little Tanka. The palefaces! Who did it? Little Tanka do it for me. It's a frame-down. That's what it is, a frame-down! - Well, up or down, do we stick? - Stick? You're right, you stick a knife upon my back. - Voyda, what is wrong with them? - What is wrong for them? I cable for Wabash Indians and what do I get? Indianians! Get out! No job! - I do not get it. - Neither did we. Very well, let them go! Then I go with them! Oh, yes? Where you going to? Now, what was the name of that club that made you the offer yesterday? Oh, oh, the Club Antoine. Oh, I could go there today. They offered me a six-month contract and I could take the band with me. You go, you go. You are not bluffing with Voyda. Indians. Now, listen, Mr. Voyda. I think you're making a big mistake by letting the Countess go to the Caf Arman. I mean Antoine. I think you ought to try and make her stay here, if possible. After all, Mr. Voyda, your money is just as good as no money. I mean, anybody's money. That Caf Antoine. I hold you to your contract with me. I have your cable accepting it. As for you, I can pay you as much money as Antoine can pay you. Everything is fixed! I go and telephone my lawyer! Boys, we're working. Hurray! Vive la France! Vive la Russia, you mean. Hello, Stephanie. Stephanie, how's the Newfoundland pup? - The all-American nephew? - You won't recognize him. Since you've been gone, Stephanie has made a man of the world of him. He's positively arresting. You ought to see him, Lord Henry. Your tailor has surpassed himself. He looks wonderful. But then I think he has the knack of wearing clothes. Not every man has, you know. And he has a positive flair for languages. The way he's taken hold of French is amazing. You should have heard him tell a taxi driver where to go last night. And Stephanie and I have given him a few pointers it would take most men a lifetime to acquire. What a start for a young fellow. Au revoir, my dear. You never looked lovelier in your life than you do this minute. Until tomorrow. It's always nice to know I shall see you tomorrow, Henry. You've been saying very pleasant things to me, lately, Minnie. - Not really ill, I hope? - No. - Stephanie. - Lord Henry. - Where is John? - Taking his French lesson. Haven't you heard them? No. La winner! Come on, boys, come in. - So long, prof. - So long, prof. Can I get you something? No, thank you. Not even a drink of water? No. Sing, please. Yesterday Yesterday Days I knew as happy sweet sequestered days Olden days Golden days Days of mad romance And love joys were mine to take Mine to give Free and gaily flaming life was mine to live Sad am I Glad am I for today I'm dreaming of yesterday Joys were mine to take mine to give Free and gaily flaming life was mine to live Sad am I Glad am I for today I'm dreaming of yesterday - Sophie, Sophie. - What's the matter? Here's an article about John. He's turned dressmaker. Can you bear it? lmagine John Kent in a smart dress shop? He wouldn't know a smart dress from last year's awning. Well, the first place I'll make a beeline for in Paris is going to be Roberta's. It's all right, Fernande. I was just saying goodbye to a room in which I've been very happy. But you are not leaving Roberta's, mademoiselle. Goodbye, Fernande. Bonjour, Monsieur Fullback. I wish to place an order. Would you mind hemstitching two dozen touchdowns for me? Oh, lay off. Would run up for me two field goals and a bias, with the score tied in the back? Kind of a halfback. I don't get sore often, but I will in a minute if you two don't shut up. Do you plan fitting the ladies yourself, John? What a picture. Tape measure around the neck and pin-cushion on the hip. I ought to spank the two of you. Now, don't lose your sense of humor, Johnny. Why don't you let a guy alone when he's trying to figure things out? She just wants to know what you're going to do. - That's all. - I'm going home. - But you can't. You're Mr. Roberta. - I'm not. Stephanie is. I mean, well, Aunt Minnie left no will, so her property comes to me. But she always said the shop was to be Stephanie's. - Stephanie's going... - Yes. We are astonished. Well, I'm not astonished. You mean you're going to give the whole shop to Stephanie? Yes, right away. That's what Aunt Minnie wanted and that's what I want. You're giving it to her without any... strings? What do you mean, ""strings""? Oh, she just means strings. Well, you make yourselves comfortable. I've got to find Stephanie. I was looking for you. - Well, hello. - No, no, no. Can you tell me why no will can be found? - Well, because there isn't any. - Why haven't you been able to find it? - It must have been destroyed. - So you admit it? Admit what? For years Stephanie has worked to build this business. It was hers as much as Roberta's. Madame could not destroy that will. - Are you trying to say I did? - I will not say yes or not. But it looks queer, very queer. You... Why, you Russian prince! I'm still boss of this outfit, and you're fired! No, no, I am not fired. I am perfectly cool. I mean you're dismissed. You think you can get rid of me so easy! - Get out! - You think no one will protect Stephanie. - Stephanie doesn't need your protection. - While Stephanie stays here and remains here, I will protect her. Aren't you ashamed to be quarreling like two silly little boys? Please go, Lad, I'll meet you downstairs. The Russian nobility burns me up anyway. They're always sticking their noses in other people's business. - You don't like the Russian nobility? - No. I don't like his hanging around you. I was going to give you the shop anyway. Oh, you are very magnanimous, giving me something I don't want. - You don't want it? - No. And who are you to give me gifts? - Wait a minute, you mustn't act like this. - I'll act the way I choose. It's your shop, you run it. Goodbye. Hey, wait a minute, Stephanie. I'm sorry, but I can't be a dressmaker. I couldn't half carry on the business. - Maybe you could carry it on half. - How do you mean? Well, I mean - maybe we could be partners. - No, no. You like it, you take it, Stephanie. I've got a football team to coach. No, I wouldn't accept anything except in partnership. Not on your life. That's out. - All right, then I'm out. - Oh, wait a minute. Pardon, mademoiselle, may I finish this now? Oh, yes, yes. Oh, wait a minute. May she? I mean, yes. Certainly, my good woman. You'll make a very nice partner. It isn't generally known that Madame has been letting me do all the designing. So we'll have to startle them with daring styles. - Partners. - Partners. Oh, John, look. We've had a brainstorm. Instead of you going home, why don't you and Stephanie become partners? Huck, you're brilliant. What do you say, Stephanie? No, not on your life. That's out. You'll make a very nice partner. It isn't generally known that Madame has been letting me do the designing. We'll have to startle them with daring styles. - Partners. - Partners. Countess, you shall be our first customer. Yvonne. This we call le Petit Trianon. If you don't like any of these, say so, won't you? Gee, I think they're swell. And this is le train bleu. Oh, that one's a honey. That's the one I'd take. Do your ecstasies refer to the gown or the girl? Oh, I hadn't noticed the girl, but now that you mention her, - I'd take... - Yes? The gown. Less upkeep. This is called la sirene noire. Does not she look wonderful in that? Marvelous. Just like a peeled eel. I don't like that one. Liane... Albert. Maybe we could do something about it. Albert, do you suppose we could raise this back a little? If you don't mind, I'd like that dress out. - As bad as that, huh? - Worse. All right, then it's out. Take it away, Albert. This is le ciel gris. That is the one I will take. And tall, handsome gentlemen with large bank accounts will be asking for my telephone number. And getting it. And won't they be surprised when I answer? Well, so long. Tell the Countess I'll be waiting for her. Where? Oh, either on the right side of the Left Bank, or the left side of the right bank. - I think you're swell not to be angry. - Angry? I hope we're good enough friends for you to express an opinion. And I hope we're good enough friends for you to dine with me tonight. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Tomorrow night. I'm very sorry. I'll tell you, the night Huck opens at the Caf Russe. All right. Gee, that'll be swell. Yes. I've always been interested in newspaper work. Have you anything more to say? I think he's said enough. I haven't any more paper. Oh, we have reams and reams of it here. Oh, thanks. A football player owning a dress shop is news, isn't it? Good news. Well, that's what I say, almost too good to be true, and that's why we want you to have it first. So that you can write it in your own sweet charming way that you've made famous, Miss... We want you to introduce it in your own inimitable style, Miss... - Jones. - Jones. Jones. But I'm still sore about all those silly jokes they're printing about me. Yes, but they print it. Every time they make a joke, a million francs pour in. It's a pretty expensive joke on somebody else, I think. - Now, when Mr. Kent designs clothes... - When I what? Does Mr. Kent design clothes, too? - No. - Oh, modesty, modesty. Mr. Kent's idea is to introduce the football motif into dress designing. The outdoor flavor will make the evening clothes look healthier. Oh, wait till you see our end-around-end evening creation. You know, the one with the dash-off center. Has Mr. Kent any more ideas? - No. - Oh, yes, thousands and thousands. As a matter of fact, Mr. Kent's main idea is to design women's dresses the way men think they should be. And how do you men think they should be? Not so naked. Well, well, he means that if clothes are to clothe, they should clothe. It's more stimulating to the imagination, if clothes clothe. That's very unique. Yes. And pockets in all dresses, especially in the evening ones, so the women can pack their own junk. The bulging pockets of the male will disappear forever. Women will not have to depend upon their male escorts. They'll be much more independent. As a matter of fact... As a matter of fact, pockets will make the female more female. Very nice. And gloves attached to the dress, so they won't get lost. They'll be worn on a jeweled... Around the neck. Brilliant! Well, I really must be going now. - Oh, that's too bad. - That's fine. - Have you had enough? - Yes, I think I have quite enough. - Now tell me, what paper will this be in? - Paper? Why, I'm Miss Jones. I'm syndicated. When you talk to me, you're telling the world. How was I, toots? Pardon, monsieur, a lady to see you. - Another newspaper woman? - An American, I think. A Miss Teale. Sophie! Send her in, please. Huck, she's here. That's great, and just when you were getting along so swell. You don't appreciate her. I know she seems a little hard and sophisticated. But underneath she's a pearl. And a pearl, so I am told, is the result of a chronic irritation on an oyster. What do you know about anything, anyway? - I know about everything, every way. - Then you must know Sophie's swell. John, every day you act worse, but today you're acting like tomorrow. - Hello, John. - Sophie! You're awfully hard to see since you became a couturier. Not for you, Sophie. When did you arrive in Paris? This morning. How long are you going to stay? Oh, hello, Huckleberry. Hello, Soph. Mother and I are going to Switzerland on Saturday. Goodbye, John. I'll see you Sunday. Don't mind him, he's only clowning. Thank you, dear. Well, so you're here now. Yes. - Aren't you pleased to see me? - Sophie, I've tried to forget you. And have you, John? I thought I had, but now I know I haven't. Gee, you're swell. John, you have a line that just sweeps a girl right off her feet. Yeah, sure. When are you going to show me Paris? You'd be bored seeing Paris with a small-town hick like me, who only knows how to order meat and potatoes and pie. Oh, please forget I ever said those things. I only said them because you were going away. I didn't want you to go. - I loved you so much. - It was a funny way to love me. But, John, darling, don't you ever say things you don't mean? No. Well, maybe I do. Don't cry, Sophie, I don't like it. I can't help it. I'm so unhappy. I came all the way to Paris just to see you. - Only to find you don't love me anymore. - But I do, Sophie, honest I do. Oh, John. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, come in, Stephanie. May I present Miss Sophie Teale? My partner Stephanie. How do you do? When I come in for a new gown, may I ask for you? Oh, that'll be swell. Well, I'll run along. I know how busy you are. - No, I'll see you to the door. - No. No. Business before pleasure. But I'll save Wednesday for you. Lunch and dinner and the evening. That's fine. It's a date. Goodbye, miss. - Stephanie, I want to... - Why, when you have time, - I wish you'd look over these materials. - But I want to tell you about Sophie. - She's very lovely. - Yes, that is... I mean she... Holy smokes, haven't we a date for next Wednesday? Oh, have we? I'm sure we haven't. This we call le lys dor. If I weren't going out with Johnny, I wouldn't be so particular. But I'm sure he'll want me to have something that expresses my personality. Suppose we have Johnny come in and help you select something. He knows so much more about your personality than I do. Oh, no. No, please. I want to surprise him. You know, he's really just a little boy in spite of his man-of-the-world exterior. Yes, I suspected that. I'll see what else I can get for you. - Oh, hello, Huck. - Hello. If you're looking for Johnny, he's in conference with his lawyer. Well, then, maybe you'll have lunch with me. - Are you busy? - Very. I'm trying to find something to suit the personality of Miss Sophie Teale. Then you are busy. Liane. Excuse me, won't you? Liane, that dress was discarded. Why do you have it on? Albert wanted to make a new top for it. Oh, all right. Fine. - Is Miss Teale's personality in there? - Yes, right in there. I'll go and torment her a while. Is that beautiful. And just made for you, Soph. - Oh, hello. Do you really think it suits me? - Oh, certainly. A little longer sleeves, it would make an ideal straitjacket. Some day, by sheer accident, you're going to say something funny, Huck. Oh, Soph, now don't be like that. Do you mind if I sit here and help you pick out a gown? No, I'm trying to find something that John will like on me. Something startling. John loves to be startled by girls' dresses. Here is a gown that might please you, Miss Teale. This gown has both chic and good breeding. I'm more interested in its chic. I can supply the breeding myself. I know the dress. Look, Stephanie, you know that one that... It sort of begins and then in the... You know, the black one. - The black one? - Yes, the one you put aside. Oh, no. No, I can't. Oh, yes, you can, Stephanie. Show it to Miss Teale. - I know she'd like it. - Oh, no, Mr. Kent wouldn't... I'm quite sure Mr. Kent would want me to see any model you have. Please have it shown as quickly as possible. That's it, Stephanie, please have it shown as quickly as possible. Just because it's been set aside for a marquise, doesn't mean that it can't be shown. Very well. Anna, have Liane model la sirene noire at once, please. Oh, thank you, Huck. Now we're getting someplace. - She'll probably like that dress. - She's going to like it. When John sees her in it, oh boy, he's gonna make her walk home, ocean and all. - No, he won't. He's in love with her. - He only thinks he is. If he were, would you mind? I am minding, Huck. Terribly. Can't you hurry that model? Yes. Yes, Miss Teale. Well, now that's the smartest thing you've shown me. I like it. It's been discarded. It wasn't put aside for anyone. - Huck was mistaken about that. - Oh, I see. Well, I think I'll have it just the same. What shall I do? You're doing fine. - How much is it? - It's only 1,000 francs. It's hardly worthy of you. I'm afraid she's right, Sophie. You know it may not be so becoming. You're not a very good saleslady. Maybe I'm wrong, Miss Teale. That dress might suit you very well. This is the bit of international diplomacy I shall boast about to my grandchildren, the nasty little demons. I'll take the dress. But I want to try it on first. The more I think of it, the more I am sure the dress will bring out something elegantly alluring in you. Well, I always know the moment I see a dress whether it'll be right for me or not. I'll take this drink and then the food. - Gee, I'm starved. - Me, too. - Hello, hello, hello. - Oh, hello, Huck. - Hello, Soph. - Hello. Oh, say, Huck, will you take care of Sophie for a minute? I want to see about a table. Pardon me, Sophie. - Here's a drink waiting for you. - Oh, thanks, John. Thanks. - Got the new dress on, Soph? - Certainly. You don't know it, but this is a great moment in my life. - Oh, thank you, Huck. - Thank you. Don't you think this dress does something for me? - It'll do something for me. - Oh, now, Huck. - A dress like this depends on... - I know, it depends on that shoulder strap. Has John seen it yet? - Afraid he won't like it. - And why not? He thinks everything I wear is perfect. If I ever ask him how he likes a dress, he just looks at me with calf-eyes and says, ""Gee, darling, you look swell."" I bet he won't say it about that one. I'll bet you $100 he says, ""Gee, that looks swell."" - Make it francs, and it's a bet. - Sold. Look, John, we want you to settle a little bet. Sophie has a very important question to ask you. Gee, that's swell. How do you like it? Isn't it a knockout? It's the worst-looking thing I ever saw. Gee, darling, you look terrible. - Who sold it to you? - Your partner. She thought it brought out something elegantly alluring in me. Oh, she did, did she? I'm sorry I said anything, Sophie. It isn't your fault, you send it back. I will not send it back. It's the smartest thing in your shop. But what do you know about clothes anyway? You make yourself ridiculous by even discussing them. I knew enough about them to order that thing out of our line. Let me tell you something, John Kent, now that you think you know something about women's clothes... - Please. - Now that you are carrying on - with your dressmaker. - Shut up. I won't shut up. You're in love with her. I could tell it the minute she came into your office. Let's go home. I'll go home and I'll go home alone. Suit yourself. - What? You'd let me? - Why not? And now we're getting down to cases, here's something I want to tell you. You've bawled me out for the last time. I've stood for all your knocking and criticism because it sounded so cute coming from such a little snip. And because I thought I loved you. - Oh, you thought you loved me? - Yes, and what a sap you've made of me. Well, it certainly didn't take much effort. And don't you ever come crawling back to me again. Because I'm through. Through! Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Sure, but I thought you said you were through. - Well, I am. - Well, goodbye! Goodbye! Noisy. - Give me a dozen brandies. - A dozen? Yeah, and line them up right here. Is there anything I can do for you? No. Think of what you're losing by constantly refusing to dance with me You'd be the idol of France with me And yet you stand there and shake your foolish head dramatically While I wait here so ecstatically You just look and say emphatically Not this season There's a reason I won't dance Don't ask me I won't dance Don't ask me I won't dance, madam, with you My heart won't let my feet do things they should do You know what? You're lovely And so what? I'm lovely But oh, what you do to me I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor Ah, but when you dance you're charming and you're gentle Especially when you do the Continental But this feeling isn't purely mental For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos And that's why I won't dance Why should I? I won't dance How could I? I won't dance, merci beaucoup Won't you? I know that music leads the way to romance And if I hold you in my arms I won't dance Bravo! Bravo! Good work. I won't dance, ta-da-dah I won't dance Get the musicians, quick. I want a drink, ta-da-dah I want a drink, ta-da-dah I want a drink, ta-da-dah Your Highness, this is a great honor. Broken down prince rates a lot of trumpeting. - What is it? - You are going to sing for us. - Oh, am I? - Yes. All right. They asked me how I knew My true love was true I of course replied Something here inside Cannot be denied They said someday You'll find all who love are blind When your heart's on fire You must realize smoke gets in your eyes So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed To think they could doubt my love Yet today my love has flown away I am without my love Now laughing friends deride Tears I cannot hide So I smile and say When the lovely flame dies Smoke gets in your eyes They said someday you'll find all who love are blind When your heart's on fire You must realize Smoke gets in your eyes So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed To think I could Doubt my love Yet to... my love - Nice of you to join us. - Now, don't try and high-hat me just because you happen to be with a broken-down prince. - Please go away, John. - No, I wanna talk to you. - You're not yourself. - Yes, I am. I'm twice myself. I wanna talk to you. What do you mean selling that dress? Didn't I tell you to throw it out? - I didn't intend to. - You did, too. It was a dirty trick to play on a friend of mine. - Please go away, Mr. Kent. - You stick to your own business. - Laddie, please. - Well, what have you got to say? - I've nothing to say. - Oh, you have nothing to say. Well, I have. And I think it was a sneaking thing to do. Telling Sophie she looked elegantly alluring in an ugly, vulgar... - Please, John, tomorrow. - No, I want it out, now. All right, I'll tell you. I sold her that vulgar, tasteless dress because I thought it suited her perfectly. I think she suits you perfectly. I think you're perfectly matched. And after this, you'd better count on running your business without me. - Stephanie, I... - Now, will you please go? So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed To think they could doubt my love Yet today my love has flown away I am without my love Now laughing friends deride Tears I cannot hide So I smile and say When the lovely flame dies Smoke gets in your... Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know, but look, this is no joke. I didn't say I'd take care of your silly dressmaking business indefinitely. But you can't give it to me. I won't take it. - You've got a band to look after. - I've got a band to look after. I know, but John, Stephanie isn't here, either. - Monsieur. - What? Yeah, the one with the spots. What? Well, how do I know were she is? I only agreed to do this thing to help you out, you know. But it isn't my racket either. - Tell him you've got a band! - I've got a band! And both the band and the shop will be on the rocks this way! I don't care which one you use. They're both terrible. What? Yeah, that was the Countess. Well, what about it? - Yes, but don't you think... - I don't think... Look, use the other one, the both of them. The whole flock of them. Out. Out. What? Look, John, if I knew where Stephanie was I wouldn't be wasting my time with you, babe. I know, but somebody's got to come and take this ridiculous business off my shoulders. In the four days I've been here, my voice is beginning to change. John, but wait. Don't hang up. He won't come back. Now what am I gonna do? - You're not asking my opinion, are you? - Yes. No. Pardon, monsieur, but do you think we should use matelass for the ""after twilight"" number or paillettes? And what about the tippet? - Well, what do you think? - I wouldn't know, monsieur. Well, personally, I go in for the simple things. - Which is the simpler? - There is no difference, monsieur. Well, then, use whichever we have the most of. We have plenty of all. Oh, we have? - Well, then use a little of each. - A sort of a patchwork quilt. Yeah. No. It will be newer that way and have much more chic. Tell Madame Blanchard that's my final decision. Stephanie. - I knew you'd come back. - I came back to tell John Kent he's insane. Where is he? Look at those. How do you think women are going to react to those? Where is Mr. Kent? Oh, he's not here. He's been staying away, too. - Who has been running the business? - Did you say running or ruining? Well, someone had to do it. You and John left it flat. But I thought surely he was here. Well, if he were, he doesn't know any more about it than Huck does. Not as much. You are the one who is needed, Stephanie. Well, that's impossible. Why? Just because you and John are in love with each other? Don't be fantastic, Huck. John isn't in love with me. Is it fantastic when a man is eating his heart out for you? When your name is continually on his lips? When he stands around dark street corners just to get a glimpse of you? - He doesn't. - He does, and more. Everyone around here knows it but you, Stephanie. And maybe John. - But he's always quarreling with me. - Well, what more can you ask? Oh, that's nothing. People in love are always quarreling with each other. Now you take Liz and myself for instance. Liz? Who is this Liz? Oh, a little country girl from back home that I'm thinking of marrying. You know, big feet, dumb, simple. Oh, very simple. Well, the simple and dumb ones make the best wives sometimes. Well, forgetting about this girl of Huck's from back home, with the big feet, what about Roberta? What about John? Yes, Stephanie, you must come back for Aunt Minnie's sake. No, I'm sorry. I can't. Stephanie, you must. Come in. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, mademoiselle, I am so happy. Now you can... Give those to Mr. Haines, Albert. Well, there are some dresses that men will fall for. - I practically designed those myself. - I've seen worse, darling, but not much. And what do you think, Stephanie? Are they as bad as that? Well, the men may like them, but I'm sure the women won't. Well, maybe you're right and maybe you're wrong. - We'll just have to try them out, I guess. - But, Huck, you can't. Roberta's never put out clothes like those. Roberta's is in new hands now. But this is like the mode two seasons back. I know, but I liked them better then. But nobody will buy them. Well, you'd be laughed out of Paris if you did a thing like that. The trend is away from such styles. - I'm not interested in the trend. - But you've got to be. You don't understand. You're giving a fashion show next week. Every couturier in Europe is going to be watching. You can't afford to show models like those. Well, of course you cannot. Stephanie is right! What does it matter as long as they're pretty? But clothes must be more than pretty. Look, the trouble with that is it... It fits in the wrong places. Such a pity. The famous Roberta to go second rate. - Roberta's will never go second rate. - Who is to stop it? The fashion show next week will be a colossal flop. Maybe we should call off the fashion show. I think so. - We might better put on a good one. - Now you're talking, Stephanie. We'll put on a better-than-good one. We'll give them some entertainment, too. - How about your band? - That's a great idea. - Yeah. - We'll bring over my band. - A musical fashion show. - Yes, that's it. - It'll be marvelous. - And you can make the new designs. We endorse this polo rig, of course And for an added 1,000 francs we furnish horses Or if you're doing splits on skis at St. Moritz You'd be the best-dressed ""faller-downer"" on the courses Now take the dowager who is glad to leave her watchman for tea She'll wear this patriotic plaid and meet that Scotchman for tea When summertime begins this costume always wins When 50 million little Frenchmen clap their fins For hunting grouse or quail Roberta ran up this suit The modest price includes the bag, the gun and two ducks to shoot And should Amelia Earhart care to get a breath of air this is the last thing in the world she'd ever wear - Ladislaw, are we gathering later? - The Princess begs to be excused. We are leaving for Rome immediately the showing is finished. It is the hour for dry martinis The park is full of little Fords and Isotta Fraschinis The Ritz bar is serving caviar and weenies Madame is there And from Roberta she has something that is too divine on The sort of thing your jealous friends would love to spill their wine on For your inspection, our cocktail collection Clothes must play a part To light an eye, to win a heart They say a gown can almost speak If it is chic Should you select the right effect you cannot miss And night and day He is sure to say Lovely to look at delightful to know And heaven to kiss A combination like this Is quite my most impossible scheme come true lmagine finding a dream like you You're lovely to look at It's thrilling to hold you Terribly tight For we're together, the moon is new And oh, it's lovely to look at you Tonight You're lovely to look at Delightful to know And heaven to kiss Heaven to kiss A combination like this Is quite my most impossible scheme come true lmagine finding a dream like you You're lovely to look at It's thrilling to hold you Terribly tight For we're together, the moon is new And oh, it's lovely to look at you Tonight So lovely to look at Delightful to know And heaven to kiss A combination like this Is quite my most impossible scheme come true lmagine finding a dream like you You're lovely to look at It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight For we're together, the moon is new It's lovely to look at you Tonight I have never seen Princess Stephanie look so lovely. Yes. We shall miss her now that she and Prince Ladislaw are leaving Paris. Oh, did she marry him? At night when madame leaves the quiet of her hall room To drag her very weary feet around the ballroom Her clothes and jewels must be a monument of power I mean, the monument they call the Eiffel Tower We'll show you the gown we made Marie, Queen of Romania We also ran up three of these for Mrs. Smudge, Pennsylvania The lights are low, here we go Lovely to look at, delightful to know And heaven to kiss A combination like this Is quite my most impossible dream come true lmagine finding a boy like you You're lovely to look at It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight For we're together, the moon is new And, oh, it's lovely to look at you - Oh, my. Oh, my. - What? - I said, ""My, oh, my."" That was lovely. - It went well, didn't it? - I guess I'll have to give in to you. - To me? But I didn't say anything. But I thought you were about to want to marry me. - Well, I was. - Well, I accept. Well, thanks very much. Well, you're quite welcome, my fine feathered friend. Hey! Hey! - Hey, do something about this. Will you? - Just a moment. You stay right there. Well, where do you think I can go? - John. - Stephanie, I... - Stephanie, are you happy? - Tremendously. - Then I am, too. - Well. Haven't you anything more to say? No. Only congratulations and have a good time and goodbye. I'm sailing for New York tomorrow. You're being very heroic about something. What is it? Oh, I was just thinking it must be fun to suddenly find yourself a princess married to a nice prince. I was born a princess. I'm not married to Ladislaw. He's my cousin. And you're still a big blundering, Newfoundland fullback. - Where are you going? - Down. - Why? - Because I pushed the button. - But I want to talk to you. - That's what you're doing. Just let me tell you I love you. - What does that mean? - I love you. Gee, that's swell. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, There she is, Mr. Drake.

Oh, won't the landlady Be glad to see you, too? Hmm? How she likes you. She likes me? Does she. She kept asking me, ""when in the world Will Mr. Lane be home?"" She's A fine woman.

Gee whiz, The way you spend it, I'll bet you haven't Got over- Over 6,000 or 7,000 left, Have you? Not over that, Dear. Well, it's a lot more Than $10, isn't it? Remember the night We only had $10, darling? Boy! Uh, gunner tells me You got home all right. Yes. Here I am. I'm home. Yeah. That's right. Kind of a lonesome trip, though... Probably. Better than Mrs. Benson's. Yeah. I'm sorry, ann. I'm broke. I'm asking for your Hand. I want to shake it. I know you're broke. I was only teasing. But I know Mrs. Benson Isn't broke. That was lovely Of you, pal. I'll bet you were funny when You were giving it to her. I wish I'd been Behind the screen. Hey! What? You're some girl! Oh! I see. I see now. You do? What? I see what you are. You're all right. And listen, you know What I'm going to do? I'm going to do something That'll surprise you. I'm going to show you What I think of you. I'm going out and grab Some wine and drink to you. What a surprise! Don't kid yourself. Any dame That accepts things like that Isn't a dame. She's something else. Is that joint open on the corner? Never mind. I'll break in if it isn't. I'll be back with the bacon. I'm drinking to a woman. I'm drinking to your mother, I'm drinking to your father, And I'm drinking to the whole Cornfed state of kansas. I've been around him A long time. That's the first time I ever heard Him praise anything but himself. I can't believe it. But you've got it coming. It was fine. Why? What else do you do When there's nothing to do? It's easy to be gallant When you're doomed. What do you mean, Doomed? You should Ask me that. Who said I was a sucker When he was on fire? I've had 5 days To think, haven't I? Don't you think I know He has to get drunk? Don't you think I can think with you? And don't you think, Mr. Gunner, I've tried to walk out? I've got a ticket in My pocketbook, even. I've packed my bag so Many times it's worn out, But I didn't go, And now I'm going To be drunk to. But, ann, you shouldn't Think like that, Because - because it's no way to think. It's crazy. Well, This is crazier. 3 roads face us, and there's Doom at the end of each. Suppose He didn't drink, He slapped her Back again, And he sits around, his Nerves screaming with triumph. He sits around Drinking sarsaparilla with ann-me. How he would Love me. The second road Is worse than that. He's retired from flying And works on the ground. Imagine a man with His heart in the sky Living with a woman On the ground. He wouldn't like Himself very much, And I wouldn't like him, either, gunner. Oh, no. He's in love With a woman with wings. She's got him. I've No way to cut her out. But there's Another road. Yes, there is, And we're on it. We go on as if nothing had happened. He goes in the next race, another bat, Another race, Another bat, Until someday, when he's Not quite so young and quick, She slaps him out, And Mrs. Benson takes Another man home on the train. How do you like it? You know, don't you? No, no, I don't know. I've Only had it for 10 years, And you hit it right On the nose, too. You just sit And wait for it. What do I do it for? Because there's nothing Else to do. He gets you. There's no fun being With anybody else. What's fun about waiting For somebody to die? Every ticktock Of the clock- Still living, Still living, Still living, Still living. What for? I won't do it. I won't love him That much. What do you think I'm made of? How can you expect Me to do that? You didn't say I was a sucker. You said I was the champion of them. Well, I won't be. Haven't I the right To live my life Without being tortured every second? Haven't I? Haven't I?! What's the matter? I'm leaving you, that's what It is, on the next train. You'll never See me again. Don't blow on me, ann. Right now. Give me a chance to make Up for this, will you? No. Come on. Give me a chance. I'm Not used to being married yet. No. But I'll pick up. I never asked anybody To do anything For me before. That's a good start, Isn't it, ann? I won't do it. I've been looking forward to Seeing you all day. Ask the gunner. I don't care. And listen, dear, I'm going to Prove a lot of things to you. We started on that Last party together. I can see your face Before me right now, Sitting there Through all that smoke. We were even flirting, Weren't we? Sure we were. That party is going to End up with you. You go in the kitchen And make some sandwiches, And we'll make believe there Were no 5 days in between. Just you and I On a little blowoff. See the idea of it, ann? Please see. No. Take it easy, pal. It's all right. You Can't blame her, I guess. All that talk of sweden And all that. You know those things Are disappointing. And she tried hard To forgive me, didn't she? I wish she hadn't made me Believe it, though. She was kind of sweet the Way she talked at first. Well, that's all right. A lot of angles To it, boy. Yeah? There's just One angle to it, boy- She doesn't love me as much As I thought she did. That's the ticket when You get right down to it, And there's nothing You can do about that. Yeah, and that's All right, too. Oh, I don't know. Yeah? Well, She fooled me good. I thought I rated higher Than a few days drunk. I'm sorry I asked her To stay now, Because I did ask her. You Were in the room. You heard me. I actually asked her To stay. I did something I never Did before in my life- I begged a girl To be my girl. Hmm! And I didn't beg her once. I begged her twice. Me! A little country girl Off of a kansas farm, And I begged her. I ought to go in there And tell her right now! I'm packed. See all my things? You just happened To come back At the wrong Moment, dear. I was telling gunner how Lonesome I was, that's all. After this, I'll understand. Your life is yours, and the Loudest applause you'll hear of all Will be me in the stands. So, do you still want me To come to the party? I'll make a cheese sandwich if you do. I do that very well. Gee, I'm glad To see you, crazy. Did you really see my Face through the smoke? How's your sky girl? Have you Slapped her since I've seen you? Yes, dear. I know you don't want me To get out of here now. There's that funny look coming over Your funny mug Again. See it, gunner? I don't see why that's Funnier than any other. See? Gunner thinks You're funny, too. You're a big clown, Baby. No other face ever made me Laugh so much before. And she calls me crazy. I ask you. Listen, nuts, I'm going to Do more than look at you. I'm going to Settle down. Yeah. I'm going to surprise You. I'm going to settle down. How, dear? Settle how? Just the way you want it. Jim. I'm going to get That dough back So fast you won't know What hit you. Drake's got jobs that No one wants any part of, All the way from pursuit Jobs to seaplanes. That-a boy. That's a cute Little place to settle down. What do you Mean, pal? I mean, right in the middle Of the atlantic ocean. Oh. Say, who do you love, kansas? You, so help me, the whole ocean full. I'm so crazy About you. Yes. I'm nuts. I must be. Ha ha ha! I wish you could have Seen Drake's face When I told him I was settling Down. He thought I was drunk. You're not fooling Anybody. Wrap it tight, pal. I'm going to Give it the works up there today, And I don't want it To pop open. I'll wrap them. You fly them. What's eating on you? You think I'm going to get drunk tonight, too? You think so? I didn't say that. No. You didn't say Anything. Listen, I meant every word I told her last night. From now on, I'm going to Attend to business. I used to take jobs When I felt like it, But from now on, I'm going to Take anything that comes along, And all the dough - I'm going to put it right in her lap. Will that Please her! Baby! Do you really want To please her? Just watch me. Quit flying and go Into a shoe store. Did she tell you that? I'm just Saying that. Yeah, and you're just Saying nothing, as usual. That just shows you What you know about women. A shoe store! I should give up The trade I love for a woman. She'd hate me. You heard what she said- She'd be the loudest Applause of all. Why don't you go Drown yourself? Is that Tight enough? Yeah, but I'm not Going to be tonight. I'm going to take her To a show instead. And who do you love, Honey? I love you. Yeah, And I love you, too. Come on. Cut it out! Sweetheart, You didn't kiss me. Come on. Let's go And kiss the army. Yeah. All right. Well!

I don't see why we got to keep sweeping these streets. They look pretty clean to me. I don't know what you're complaining about. I think it's swell. To be dumping garbage and sweeping streets. It's great training. Great training. For what? - Sweeping streets. Henry Wood. Yes, sir. - James Butler. Yes, sir. Assigned USS California. Wilbur Mullins. Here sir. - Chester O'Connor? Here sir. Assigned USS Arizona. The first break I've got in this broom-pushing outfit. The time you've spent here, ninety days, have been short. And the lessons, many. We hope you remember them. And we hope that you bring credit to the station. Now goodbye, good luck and a pleasant cruise. Take charge, sir. - Aye-aye, sir. There is a guy named Martin on the Arizona. And I'm going through all this to catch up with him. And here it is. Attention! Take up your bags. Right and left. Face. Forward, march! Ahoy! Hello. - Alongside. Crew for Arizona reports for duty, sir. - Very well. Messenger. Yes, sir? Have the Master at Arms take charge of this detail. Take these records up to the executive officer. Aye-aye, sir. Have them disembark. Disembark! Take these men to the Exec's office for assignment. Aye-aye, sir. Pick up your bags and follow me. He likes us already. - I think he's cute too. Say, you got a guy named Martin on this ship? You mean Chief Martin? - Yeah. He's ashore. That's too bad. Now I got to postpone my date with him until tomorrow. Alright, thanks. Have you got twenty bucks? Yeah, sure. - Would you lend it to me? Is it for a dame? - Well yes. In a way. Well then, you don't get it. I ain't going to work like no slave just to have you spend it on some twister. Yeah, I know. But this is different. Different, my eye. Look at me. Just because of a bone and a hank of hair. Look where I am. Will you wait a minute and let me say something? Don't try to tell me nothing. Dames is out of my life. From now on every frail is just going to be a straw ride. Yeah, but this ain't no dame. It's my mother. Next week is her birthday and I want to surprise her with a set of false teeth. If I knew her size I could order them here and send them to her. But the doctor says she's got to have them. Because she got to eat meat. Well, that's different. I never knew you had a mother. Well, everybody has got a mother. Oh yeah? Well here .. for Mama. Thanks. I wish they'd give us ladders in the Navy. No, no, no, no. What do you think this is, an excursion boat? Come on! Heave out! You, move. What? Well if it ain't you. Well. I've been waiting ninety days for this. Come on, clear the decks for action because I'm coming to get you. Now wait a minute, sailor. Wait a minute. Take it easy. You overlook one thing. When you came over that gangway aboard this ship all private battles stopped. When I'm ashore I'll gladly accommodate you by taking off this coat .. And settling our little fight. But when you're aboard, remember you're in the Navy and I'm your senior officer. Now, rise and shine. And after this, when you address me treat me with respect. Now pick that up. Find a handle to it and go on up and manicure the deck. And from now on .. call me ""Mister"". Now I know why they had us sweeping streets at the training station. This ain't no broom but it's the same motion. Yeah .. they got us in training to be janitors. Anyway, I'm glad we've got liberty tonight. The first thing I got to do is send my old lady the dough for her choppers. Is my brother on board? - Yes, Miss. He's up on deck somewhere. Messenger, locate Martin. - Aye-aye, sir. Thank you. Holy smoke, look at the trim lines on that destroyer. Ain't that just my luck. She would come aboard. And me with the ugliest part of me nude. Now when are you going to stop being a sucker? Why don't you profit by my experience and lay off of them dames? Why? Did one of them do you wrong? Listen, fellah. I had a piece of silk give me a joyride, keep me flat broke, get me beat up .. And then thrown out of my job, in the bargain. Boy, that's what I'd certainly call a sad life. And then to add insult to injury .. She ties up with the guy that put the lug on me: Biff Martin. It's why I won't have anything to do with them again. I don't blame you for being sore and only going for the pick-ups. He couldn't have done it if that dame hadn't distracted my attention. Hit me when I wasn't looking. Big game guy. Hello Biff. - Hello, Dot. Well there is something that will curl your hair. Pipe that. Hello kid. Gee, I'm glad to see you. What are you doing aboard? I had to go to work this afternoon. I had to see you about something. What's that guy got anyway? Just what the doctor ordered as far as the dames is concerned. Ah, you're full of canal water. You can pick up fleabags like her easier than picking lint off a blue serge suit. I'm telling you. I knew a guy up in Seattle. One of the swell-est guys you ever saw in your life. Excuse me a minute. Alright, lay off the speakers table. Bend down on those brushes. He tells me he knows a fellow in Seattle. Yeah, I know. Come on, get going. Oh yes. Hey. Did you say that dame was hard to get? Why, she even looked at us like we was a couple of boots. Uhuh. Hey, sailor. Tell me something. Where does that dame hang out? That one there. She works at the telegraph office over in town. Huh? That's a break for you and your old lady too.    - Why? Because Mama gets her money for her choppers wired to her tonight. Awfully sorry to have kept you waiting. Not too sorry. Did you want to send a wire? - Yeah. How much would it cost to wire a party in Walla Walla twenty bucks? That's in Washington. 326 Summer Street. My mother. That will be exactly 24 dollars and 61 cents including tax. Oh that's tough. We've got only 22 bucks between us. Well. We'll have to mail the dough to your old lady the next time we come ashore. I'm awfully sorry. Oh .. forget it. Sure, forget it. Say. Wasn't you on our ship today? - Hmm. Don't you remember us? Sure, you remember him. That's the guy with the quarter of three trilbies. Like that. I'm sorry, but I have to close up now. That's the third time you've been sorry. Maybe you're sorry we came in? Maybe I am. Say. Why don't you go and pick up those botany books at the library. Sure. Well. Suppose you weren't sorry? Then what? Oh nothing. I suppose I'd walk home just the same. Alone? I always walk home alone. That's all I wanted to hear. Now look. This is just supposing, just supposing. Supposing some nice guy was to ask to walk you home? What would you say? I suppose I'd say .. No. Oh, like that, huh? Now wait, wait .. Well, if you didn't let a guy walk home with you .. I don't hope you'd give him your phone number? I certainly wouldn't. Well in case you did. I mean this is just in case. It wouldn't be San Pedro, say, 3142? No, not if he wanted to get me it wouldn't. How come? Because my phone number is San Pedro 9697. Aha. San Pedro 9697. I don't suppose if a guy come over on liberty tomorrow night he'd .. He'd have any chance of calling you? Well, where do you suppose he'd call? At the office or at the house? Because I'm not working tomorrow night. I was just thinking that the Navy land is so close to the telegraph office .. I wouldn't have to use a phone. I could just holler over. Well, here is where I live. Goodnight. Now wait a minute, kid. Wait a minute. Say. What are the chances of stopping in and picking up a pencil? I'm sorry. I keep all my pencils at the office. Well, there wouldn't be any harm in my stopping in and .. Having a cup of coffee with your old man would there?       - No. No, there wouldn't be any harm in that. - Well then, it's alright? Not tonight. - Why not? You see, Papa doesn't live here anymore. Oh, Miss. Hey!     Hey. In case I want to call. Just in case. What do I ask for? If you want me, ask for Dorothy. Alright, Dorothy. Goodnight, - Goodnight. Did you ask her if she had a girlfriend for me? Girlfriend? Just the one, just the one. All you got to do is whistle. Whistle right there.   Oh, getting fussy, huh? Wait a minute. Hello there. How are you? Hiya, baby. Me, I'm swell. Say .. Where we going later? - Let's not go out any place tonight. I have dinner on the stove. Wouldn't you like to come up for a nice home-cooked meal? Would I? She asked will I go to dinner there tonight. Try and keep me away. Will be there in a half hour. Yeah. A half hour. Alright, baby. Bye-bye. What's doing? - It's all over but the shouting. Me and her is having dinner at her place, and we're staying in. Did you ask if she had a girlfriend for me? Oh .. I didn't think of it. Ain't that funny. You always forget to ask that. Yeah, that's right. But I promise, next time I will. I promise you that. Say, listen, You got any of that twenty bucks left? Oh, sure. Well, can you slip me ten of it? - Uhuh. Attaboy. - My mother's choppers. That's alright. Write and tell her to stay on oatmeal for another week. It's okay. Come on. I hope I'm not keeping you waiting. That's up to you, baby. Me? - Yeah. Come on over here and I'll tell you all about it. Now. What? - Come here. I can't, Chesty. I have to watch dinner. - Come on, sit down. I'm sorry, Chesty. No. What? I guess it's my fault. What is this? I suppose it looked like just what you thought .. When I invited you up here tonight. You're kidding. Chesty, I did want to like you but .. I guess we both had the wrong idea. You'd better be going. Well. If you're on the level it's okay with me. I can't shove off fast enough. Goodnight. Oh. So you're trying to give me a fast exit? - Well .. You know, this is funny. I don't usually go so far wrong on a dame. Don't you think you owe me an apology? Yeah, sure. And if you .. Show me how to make one and tell me what to say, I'll be glad to do it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dorothy. - Dorothy. Alright. Now I'll say it again. I'm sorry .. very sorry. Dorothy. Was that hard? - No. In fact it isn't enough. You're one of the swell-est girls I've met in my life. I'm a chump. So from now on anything you want to ask to even things up, you just name it. Chesty, that's the sweetest apology a girl ever got. And it's all the nicer because you made it yourself. The potatoes. Chesty! Going bad? - Not too badly.  There's the bell, Chesty. Will you answer it please. What do you want here? Get up on your pins, sucker. Get up! I'm up. Biff. Chesty! Keep out of this, Sis. Keep out of it. - Let him alone. I invited him up here. You invited him up here? - What's this mug to you? My brother. Now, will you both try to be gentlemen. You brother? - Yes, her brother. Let him alone. I'm ashamed of both of you. You might have a little respect for me. Come on. We'll finish this downstairs. - That's alright with me. Biff, if you go out there I will never speak to you again. Well okay, quiet down. I'll stay. But you get this. I'm not going canary. I'm just trying to give her a break. If I catch you within eight blocks of this place I'll go to work on you. And I won't fool around about it. Oh yeah? - Yeah. Well I'll see Dorothy whenever I like and as often as I like. And nobody is going to stop me, see. Sorry, kid. Your company has spoiled my appetite. Hard-headed little wharf-rat. Biff, won't you listen to me. Sure I'll listen if you can give me half a reason why you invited him up here. Because I enjoy his company. Honest Biff, you'd get a great kick out of him if you knew him. Knew him? I know him well enough to know that he's not fit company for you. What is it that you have against him that makes you hate him so? Well, plenty. Met him in Seattle. I scrapped with him in a cheap dance hall where decent people shouldn't go. What were you doing there? Well, I was .. uh .. going to meet .. How did I know what the place was like until I got inside. That's beside the point anyway. Now look, Biff. Tomorrow onboard ship. I want you to apologise to him and invite him back to dinner. I want you to be friends. Sure. I'll send him a gold watch and chain too. Do I look that daffy? Now listen, Dot. I never tried to tell you what to do did I? You heard what I said at the door and it still goes. I don't want you to see him again. I'll see him as much as I want. No matter what you say or think. I like him and I hope he likes me. Well, I got to hand it to you. Out of all the guys in the Navy, you pick him out. Hey O'Connor. Telegram. Oh. Thanks. What is it, a telegram? Why, how do you like that? You mean they didn't spell ""liberty"" right? It's from my girl you dope. She wants to see me tonight. It's important. How am I going to get off ship? - A pass. No, I had liberty last night. Well, show them the telegram. Hey, that's an idea. Just because it comes from you, I don't like it. I thought you was the guy that was going to give dames the quick shuffle. I can change my mind, can't I? Or is that privilege going to be taken from me too? Oh, it's okay. Only I let you give me the idea that we was going to pick them up, play and run. Yeah, you're just one of those guys that would acquiesce. ""Acquiesce"". Agree. Become a partner to. Give it the nod. You mean say yes? Boy, here I am wasting time at a moment like this. I got another idea. Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Wait a minute, will you! Wait a minute! Hey! Wait a minute! Hey, wait a minute! I beg your pardon, sir. I'd like special liberty tonight, sir. It's very important. You rate liberty? No, but my girl needs me. I just got this wire from her. This doesn't seem very imperative. But if you can get relief. And the Master at Arms gives you a clean ticket I've no objections to your going. Aye-aye, sir. - Martin. This man wants special liberty. He's got this telegram from his girl. What about it? Why this man is a liberty hound, sir. I'd like to see him kept aboard. Special liberty not granted. - Aye-aye, sir. O'Connor. Listen, Cinderhead. I thought I told you to keep away from my sister, didn't I? What do I have to slug you with to make you savvy? You and your whole Navy couldn't keep me away from her. What you say to that? You won't see her tonight. No?             - No. What makes you think so? Because Romeo, I'm putting you on the fo'c'sle watch from 8 to 12. Oh yeah? Well alright, puss. And I'll be on your neck from 12 o'clock on. You look sore. I almost think you didn't get it. - Well, I didn't. Besides, Martin put me on watch for tonight. Well, can't you do something? Like ..? Talk to the Admiral. I'm going to do plenty. Me and this man's Navy is parting company for good. I never want to see water again. Before I'll see one of these battle wagons. You aren't hinting that you're going to swim ashore, are you? I'm going just the way I came. In a liberty boat. And if you don't believe me .. Come and watch. Hey, cookie. You've got liberty tonight, ain't you? - Sure have, sir. Want to make some dough? - How much? Three bucks for your liberty card. I would like to oblige you Mr Chesty, but I've got a date. I'll make it five. It's a lot of dough for one night's liberty. Doggone, I almost come. But I just can't disappoint my honey. She won't be disappointed. Yes sir, she will. Well look, I'll make it ten bucks. Look, got ten bucks on you? Got my hand right on it. I knew what was coming. Here you are, look. A nice new crisp ten dollar bill all for you. What you say? You know, this thing does things to me. I guess you got me. Listen Chesty, if my mother don't get those china teeth .. She'll lose her job as well as her health. What's her racket? - She sings in a choir. Can't she hum? - Hum? Yeah, hum. Tell her to hum until we play our next crap game. Hum, hum, hum, hum. That's alright. Hum, hum, him. Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum. I like it. Hum, hum, hum. Hum .. hum .. hum.   Now lay up .. all the liberty party. Attention! Open ranks. Forward. Front rank. About face! What have you got there? - Shoes, sir. Alright. Remember, men. Liberty expires at midnight. - Yes, sir. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Liberty expires on the dock at midnight. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Nice work, Chesty. Hello! Hello, baby. It's me, Chesty. Oh my gracious, not even your own mother would know you. Yeah, I know. I had to smear this stuff on my face so I could get ashore. Come on, tell me. What's up? - Well, it's Biff. He is trying to make me promise not to see you anymore. Oh yeah? Well look, let's go someplace and I'll wash this stuff off my face. We'll talk it all over. Come on. Well, supposing I got a job in some other place? Would you come? Are you going to be transferred? No. I'm quitting the Navy tonight. You're just fooling, Chesty. I'm not kidding. I mean it. I know what's wrong with you. - What? You're just sore as you can't get even with Biff. You're taking it out on the Navy. I'll admit that's part of it but I don't like the rest of it either. You can take the Navy and put it right in your eye. The only way to get me back into it is to send me back in a box. What's the matter? Nothing. Come on, tell me. What is it? Chesty, I just can't like a deserter. I never dreamed you were a quitter. I ain't quitting. I don't like the Navy. Isn't that enough for you? It is for me. I'm tired. Let's go home. Am I being a chump again? - Not yet. But you will be if you run away. Alright, I quit. I'll go back to the ship and stick it out. Oh honest? Will you promise, Chesty? I'd promise you anything. Hey, mister. Oh, go away will you. Go away. The two dollar bill you gave me is all ridden out. But the crowd out there. Are passing the hat to keep you riding all night. Is it okay? And Biff. I want you to know if you'll shake hands .. And Biff. I want you to know if you'll shake hands .. I'll forget the past and try to be friends. What's more, I'll try to be a better sailor. Now wait a minute. That last .. Sounds kind of abracadabra. You know, lah-di-dah. It's out. - Well .. Then I'll watch myself and try to be a credit to the ship. Alright. I'll say that. Oh Chesty, I'm proud of you. I want you to know. I wouldn't do it for nobody else in the world but you. Nobody but you. Oh, honey. Wait. Goodnight, baby. - Now don't forget. I won't. Goodnight again. Hey, skipper. I jumped ship. I must get back. Will you take me out for a couple of bucks? Sure, but it costs three. - Right, let's go. Alright, Bob. Shove off. How you going to get back on board if you jumped ship? You know it's much tougher getting back on than it was getting off. It's a tough rap. You're liable to get about ten days in the brig for this. Hey, do me a favor, will you. - Yeah, sure. When we get close to the ship, slow down and switch off your lights. Will you do that? - Yeah. Sure. O'Connor. O'Connor! Yes, sir. Mullins, what are you doing here? I'm on watch. See, Chesty wasn't feeling very well. As a matter of fact he was sick and he said to me, he said .. ""Droopy"", he said .. He wasn't feeling very well. You feel fine, don't you? You're not a very good liar, Droopy. - Yes, sir. No, sir. I know where he is. - What will I do? Stay on watch until you're relieved. I've got some watching to do myself. Alright, Bob. Slow down. Help .. help! Man overboard! Man overboard. Man overboard! Man overboard. Port side. Man overboard, port side. Help. Help! Man overboard. Lower away. Together. Is there anything I can do to help? - Yes. Keep out of the way. Who is it? I hope it's who I think. Aha. It is. What happened? - Why .. I was leaning against the side when my foot slipped and I fell into the water. Yeah. Your foot slipped alright. Well, stupid .. You brought this on yourself. You'll be reported for being absent without leave. Ahoy, Arizona! Did that dumb sailor who just jumped off this speedboat get aboard alright? Okay skipper, we got him. Alright. What's your name? - Chesty O'Connor. Seaman 2nd Class, sir. The man is AWOL sir. Furthermore he jumped his watch tonight and let another man substitute for him. O'Connor. That's a very serious offence. You're restricted to this ship. Awaiting action of the Commanding Officer. Aye-aye, sir. Martin. You've been called here to testify in the case of seaman O'Connor. He's charged with leaving the ship with no authority on the night of April 2nd. Also, on the same night of leaving his station and duty without any authority. Tell the court what you know of the case. I was on duty on the night in question, sir. And I had assigned seaman O'Connor to the 8 to 12 fo'c'sle watch. On inspection I found that he'd gotten .. Seaman Mullins to stand his watch for him. Well, I immediately searched the ship and .. Found O'Connor was not aboard. About. One o'clock in the morning. I was standing on the fo'c'sle deck. When a shore boat came close in to the bow and I heard a splash. Shortly afterwards, I heard a man yell .. ""Man overboard"". We found the man to be .. O'Connor. However sir, he did not fall over from the fo'c'sle deck because .. The only two on the fo'c'sle deck were .. Seaman Mullins and myself. Does the accused desire to make a statement? Yes, sir. Martin has had it in for me for a long time. He's just making this thing worse. Just to make it tough for me. Well go ahead and sentence me. And when it's all over. I'm going to get off this wagon. I don't like the sea and I never have. I want to go into some other branch of the service. And as for you, gumshoe .. - Silence! O'Connor you're only making yourself liable for further discipline. Orderly. Take charge of the prisoner. - Aye-aye, sir. Halt! Left. Face. I have the court-martial papers, sir. Very well. O'Connor. Uncover. O'Connor. The court before which you were tried has found you guilty. And this is the sentence of the court. To be confined to the limits of the ship for a period of two months. And to lose 24 dollars per month of your pay. For a period of three months. A total loss of pay amounting to 72 dollars. Signed by all members of the court. Approved by the commanding officer. And the immediate superior in command. Master at Arms. Take charge of O'Connor. Aye-aye, sir. Division. Dismissed. Too bad, Chesty. That's really too bad. Hey listen, O'Connor. I'm sorry about that. Now wait a minute, hothead. You've been in the Navy long enough to know what I did was in the line of duty. Any trouble between you and my sister and me has got nothing to do with it. Onboard ship I do my duty just as I see it. But you get this through your skull. I'm no squealer. Alright. Gangway. No, he's no squealer. So that's the way they do it in the Navy, huh? Shipmates. If that's the way it is, I don't want anything more to do with any of it. And that goes for the whole outfit and anybody in it. You're nothing but a lot of whip-dogs .. Boot-licking and kowtowing to a flock of mugs in uniform. Who push you around like a lot of rag-dolls. A wrong guy. Sure, sure. You guys wouldn't laugh if you heard my mother sing this song in Walla Walla. I can see her now sitting in a rocking chair waiting for me to come home. And as I step in the door she'd say .. Drunk again. Thanks, guys. To show you how that song gets me. Once I heard a mother singing it to her kid while she was feeding it. You know what it made me feel like doing? Having a baby. Why did those guys leave when I came in? I've been trying to learn the words to that song for eight years. I know one mistake I've been making. Instead of singing .. ""The violets of early spring"". I've been singing .. ""Sweet peas on a pearly string"". I asked you. Why did those guys get up and leave when I came in? You know what I think I will do? I'm going to have it tattooed on me. Then it will stay with me. Answer me! Why did they leave? I don't want to tell you, Chesty. - Come on. Well they got the thumbs down on you. They think you're a wrong guy. Because of that speech I gave them? Yeah. They like the Navy. Well if that's the way they feel about it, it's alright with me. The further they're away from me, the better I like it. And that goes. ""Oh promise me that someday you and I .."" Charlie. Oh, wait a minute. Hello. Oh, my sweetheart. ""Sweet violets of early spring."" ""Oh promise me that someday you and I .."" Baby. Not here. Biff will see us. Boy, I'm glad to see you. It seems ages. Here, sit down. Well? What do you think of that big brother of yours?       - What? What he did to me when I took your advice and came back to apologise. I'm certainly not proud of you Chesty for what you said after the summary. Why did they want to give me such a stiff jolt for? Lots of guys go AWOL and get extra duty for only one day. But you jumped your watch. Well I do it because I want to see you. I don't want you to neglect your duty no matter how much I want to see you. Well, whatever I did he shouldn't have turned me in. He had to do it, Chesty. It's his duty. He's sick about it. What are you always sticking up for him for? He is the only one I have left in the world. Naturally I defend him because I love him. Maybe you don't need nobody else? Don't talk like that. Well, if he's such a big-shot with you maybe I'm wasting your time. Do you really feel that way? - Yes, certainly. If he's that man, I might as well bow out of the picture. Whatever made you think you were in it? Oh. So it's one of those things, huh? Anyway, I wouldn't marry you. Not while you were still a 2nd Class seaman. Hmm. A snob. Why didn't you wait until you were asked? What's the use of prolonging it? If this ends it, at least let's talk as friends. Yeah, sure. It's been nice. You can't even be a good sport, can you. Go on home, will you. You've said your piece. - Not all of it. I'm going to tell you something though you don't deserve it. You've signed up for four years. And you'll spend them either on board ship or in naval prison. But you will still spend your four years. Go on, blow will you. Blow. And how you spend them depends on you. You certainly started out wrong. You can fool a CPO. You can annoy a Captain. You might even trouble an Admiral. But there is one thing neither you nor anybody else can do. And that's whip the Navy. Everything alright? That's fine. All hands take stations for getting under weigh. Anchors aweigh. Anchors aweigh, bridge. I don't see why we got to wash this thing. It's coming right out of the water. We got to wash the germs off it. - For what? They're going to use it in the officer's mess to crack nuts. Bugler, sound general alert. Aye-aye, sir. My range. 8-0, double O. My range, 178 double O. Coming on the range. One minute to go. Alright boys, remember we're out for the fleet record. Let's go. Stand by. Load. One. Two. Three. Four. Ready one. - Ready two. Ready three. Three. Four. That's five. Ready. Ready one. Watch it men. Fire. Fire! Control, control! Fire in gun room number one turret! Close those plugs. Don't turn those on. Get that powder out of here. How do you feel, Chesty? - Alright, kid. You sure? - Yeah. Well you certainly are a big-shot. You ought to hear what the guys are saying about you. Yeah? What did they say? Well, they think you're a swell fellow. And you must be a great guy to risk your life to save all those men. And you are an amazing character. You're going to be recommended for a decoration. Ah, bull. I'm the same guy they gave the goodbye to, ain't I? Well they gave it to me once and I don't want to have no truck with them now. I did it to save myself. And I want them to know that. You oughtn't to feel that way, Chesty. You are going to get a medal and everything. Times up. Take good care of yourself, Chesty. And do everything they tell you. Not much chance of doing anything else. How about it? Is he convalescing? Not while I was in there. What did he say when you said the boys were all for him? It ain't fit to be repeated. I get it. All hands aft, sir. Seaman 2nd Class C.J. O'Connor. Front and center. Sir, Seaman O'Connor is present to be decorated. Publish the order. Salute. Two.

To join with the Navy department in commending your conspicuous courage. My congratulations and best wishes. Thank you, sir. My pal. Station officers take charge. Dismiss divisions. Divisions, dismissed! Chesty, let me congratulate you. I'm glad I know you. There ain't many guys got one of them things. I'm not envious mind you. But I certainly wish I had one. Like it? - Sure.     - Alright. It's all yours. Now. Feel like a hero? What are you crabbing about? You ought to be tickled to death. - Ah, what is it? Nothing but a tin novelty you can buy in any hock shop for a dime a dozen. What do I get out of it, for getting my eyebrows singed? It's the two bucks a month that goes with it that interests me. So here. Send that to your Mama with my compliments. O'Connor is a good man but I guess he needs a change of scenery. He's already asked for a transfer of duty to lighter-than-air craft, sir. Oh. Well, I'll see if I can't help it along. You sent for me, sir? O'Connor, I have received orders from the Bureau of Navigation. Detaching you from this ship. You are ordered for duty to lighter-than-air craft. I hate to see you go. But you seem to be headed wrong in this ship. The Navy tires to make men, not break them. You've got the stuff. I wish you a happy cruise at Sunnyvale. Thank you, sir. The first break I've had since I've been in this man's navy. The next break you'll get will be your neck. Don't you kid yourself. The neck to be broken will be Biff Martin's. The first time I meet the guy ashore I'm going to break every bone in his skull. I've heard that so many times it's getting to be a monopole. A what? You know, one guy talking to himself. - Oh. Look, Chesty. - Yeah? Would you like to make a nice gesture? How? - Well .. My mother ain't got her false teeth yet. And like I was telling you, her choir singing job ain't so secure. 0kay, kid. Here. Here is ten .. Ten. Twenty bucks. Buy your Ma a new set of porcelain fangs and dedicate the upper plate to me. I wish I could be there for the opening. Look. I .. I got something for you. 0h yeah? - Yeah. Well, you might not like it. I thnk you'll appreciate it. Because it is nice. Ah. Now what did you want to go to all that trouble for? If you don't like it you can make a calendar out of it. You know .. there's one nice thing about it.                 - Yeah? What? There is no doubt in your mind as to who it is from. The boat is ready, Chesty. I'll be right there, kid. - I'll take the bag, Chesty. Alright. Well, there goes your hero. If you want to say goodbye to him you'd better do it now. He won't speak to me, Biff. Give him this. Goodbye, old pal. Bye, Droopy. The old ship ain't going to be the same without you. It couldn't be any worse. Say, what's the matter? You got a cold? No, it's my voice. I think it is changing. Oh. I certainly wish I was going with you. - Oh, you'll be alright. Now look, don't forget what I told you. Right? O'Connor. I never had any man go over the side for the lasts time without being friends. Come on. What do you say? Okay hothead, if that's the way you feel about it. Here. That's for you. So long, Chesty. - So long, kid. Good luck, old boy. How can .. How can you figure a guy like that? Woo, switch! What are you two guys? A couple of violets? Ah, mind your own business. Goodbye, Chesty! Here's a lug for your whiskers. I get a letter from a pal of mine. He tells me about everything but the ship. What a mug. What do you expect? Those sailors are all dumb. Oh, is that so? Listen, I want you to know the boys on the Arizona are the best in the world. Well, all except one. All present and accounted for, sir. - Very good. ""United States Fleet."" ""Aircraft battle force."" ""26th October."" ""Movement order."" ""Number 1734."" ""Task organisation: A.""

The Arizona has been detailed to provide this ground crew for the Macon. Which lands at Mines Field today. Take charge. - Aye-aye, sir. Right, face! Light smoke bomb. What did they do that for? - To see which way the wind is blowing. I always do this. Left rudder. - Left rudder, sir. Steady. - Steady, sir. The wind seems a bit gusty. I think we can make it though. This old bag is going to have a tough time landing today. Better get the hatch ready for dropping those trails. Okay. Open up. You said it. That wind is getting stronger. Those ground monkeys better watch themselves. We'll try it. - Aye-aye, sir. Steady as she goes. - Steady as she goes, sir. Come left. - Come left, sir. Drop the trail. - Drop the trail, sir.

It's nothing to worry about. It's easy. - I can't risk it. Aye-aye, sir. Steady. Hey O'Connor, what are you going to do? I hope he can hang on. Gangway. - Where you going? To pick that guy off that rope. - You chump. You'll break your neck. Well, I'll try it anyway. Well good luck, kid. - Happy landings. Can you hang on another minute? Well if it ain't flatfoot. I might have guessed it. The only guy in the Navy dumb enough to hang on to the end of a rope. Alright? Put both arms around me. Both of 'em. Right? Alright. One. Here we go. Two, three.

You will see a show of amazing... stupendous and cataclysmic proportions. Your two bits will do the work of a sawbuck. From the inside, folks, you're gonna see, right before your very eyes... without the aid of cheaters or a microscope... - Joe, the Turtle Boy. - That's it, the picture. Jail me, folks, if I ain't telling the truth. He walks, eats and sleeps just like a turtle... but talks the English language as well as you and I. And shaves himself with a safety razor. And as an added attraction folks, Joe plays the zither. Believe it or not, folks, he plays the zither. That's what you'll see when you go inside. What did you get? Not much. Them birds have to work for a living. These tickers look like a lot of heirlooms. Look at them. And that, folks, is only a sample of what you're gonna see for the one price. Now look, folks, you've got to give me your undivided attention... because I want you to hear each and every word that I'm going to say. Over there, Tira, the beautiful Tira! Dancing, singing marvel of the age! Supreme flower of feminine pulchritude! The girl who discovered you don't have to have feet to be a dancer. Boys, just push right in there, you're gonna have a better view. All right, boys, the lumber. Drag it out! Pull ahead, men! If I wasn't a married man, I could go for you, baby. No wisecracks, now. A penny for your thoughts. Tira, boys! Tira! Just look at those eyes. I dig those eyes. Boys, she can assume shapes that will astonish a chiropractor! And next to her a wiggling worm looks paralysed. Get the idea, boys? I can say without fear of contradiction... that if Tira had played the town at the time... Noah would have missed the boat. You follow me? Boys, with the right kind of encouragement... she'll throw discretion to the winds... and her hips to the north, east, south and west. It's the only show on earth where the tickets are made of asbestos. And now inside, Tira, the girl who makes your dreams come true. Step right up, men. Does she do her stuff? You bet she can do it. Oh, mama! I know just how you feel, honey. - Is that elegant or is that elegant? - Elegant. They call me Sister Honky-Tonk I've got the face of a saint On the level, it ain't paint Beware of these eyes I'm a devil in disguise And they call me Sister Honky-Tonk Get over dirty They call me Sister Honky-Tonk Just play a passionate strain And I'll be low down again It's fire and it's flame So be careful of this dame They call me Sister Honky-Tonk I got to scram now Am I making myself clear, boys? Suckers. Tomorrow night at the same time: Tira! Tira, you're gonna be a good girl and work them lions tonight, ain't you? No, I'm gonna be a bad girl and go home to bed. - No. - I'm tired from tossing my hips. - I know, but... - Besides the cat act's on too late, anyway. I'll work them tomorrow night if you put them on earlier. Sometime you'll ask me to do you a favour and I'll... So what? - Hello, honey. - I've just been working on you. Oh, yeah? - What have you got to tell me tonight? - I have your horoscope. - I hope you got some good news in it. - Good and bad. Go ahead, I got my fingers crossed. You were born in August. - Yes, one of the hot months. - It was on the 17th... under the sign of Leo, the lion. King of the beasts, huh? Today is not lucky for you. I can't complain. So far it's been perfect. Tomorrow will be very lucky. But tonight, be careful. Something told me not to work that lion act tonight. You are very wise. I profit by my experience. Now listen, honey, you just tell me about my future. You see, I know all about my past. You have a wonderful future. I see a man in your life. What, only one? But this is one very particular man. He is very wealthy. Enormously wealthy. You mean a millionaire. What does he look like? I see he has brown eyes. In fact, I see two men. You don't mean twins? No. Two different men. In the near future I see a change. What, a change of men? Not yet. I see a change of position. Sitting or reclining? But it's all left me. I can't help you anymore tonight. I can't. Thanks, Rajah. It's all right, I'm in a hurry anyway. - Give me my thing. - Horoscope. Keep this where you may consult it frequently. All right, I'll take it to bed with me. What are you playing me the chill for all of a sudden, baby? Because I ain't exactly in the mood. Seems like I can't put you in the mood, lately. I guess you're right. Barton wants you to get in the cage and wrestle them lions tonight. Not tonight. I told Barton. Tira, you've got to. The show is walking on its heels in this town. What's the rush? You seem awful anxious to get somewhere. - Pulling something funny, if you ask me. - I ain't asking you. I'm asking you. What do you want to stay in a hotel in town for? Why don't you stay on the lot, same as the rest of us? 'Cause I ain't the same as the rest of you. I'm sick of people worrying about what I do. I get about as much privacy around here as a goldfish. Getting high hat, huh? What did you do? Got you a haircut or have your ears moved down? It's a wonder you noticed. Miss Tira. Come in, honey. A gentleman gave me this note for you. What's your name? My name is Frederick, but they calls me Otto. All right, honey, you tell the gentleman it's okay. Yes, ma'am. - Who's the boyfriend? - Wouldn't you like to know? I tell you, you go mixing up with any guy and I'll bust his jaw. I'll break him in two, you hear? I'll give him the works. If you ain't careful, you're liable to hurt somebody. Take that as a warning. You take it and bury it, maybe it will grow lilies. - I'll see you later. - The later, the better. Tira, can I come in? Come on in. See, I just felt I had to talk to somebody. I'm in a rush, but go ahead and talk. You look terrible. What's the matter? Everything is the matter, with me anyhow. - Barton again? - Yeah. That guy is a habit with you, honey. Why don't you step out? A change will do you good. - That's what I'm doing. - What about Slick? He's all right. If he kept his hands out of other people's pockets. What is it gonna get me hanging around him? I got ideas. Somewhere there's a guy with a million waiting for a dame like me. Rajah said so. Tira, you always have such swell things. How do you do it on your salary? It's a gift, honey. Them beads is pretty. They are kind of pretty. He gave me them. Genuine amber. The beads, I mean. And these here handkerchiefs, genuine Madeira. No, he gave me the pillows. Here, here's the baby. He gave me them. And this here sailor, he gave me this here jade set... he got in Shanghai, genuine jade, he said. Here. Tira, they're beautiful. - You like them? - Yes. Try them on. If they do something to you, you can have them. Thanks. Don't mention it. I'd like to stick around and show you the rest of my stuff, but I got a heavy date. I gotta be leaving you. - Tira, how can I ever thank you? - Don't. Why, you look better already. Say, you're a good-looking dame. There is a lot of guys that would go for you in a big way. Always remember, honey, a good motto is: ""Take all you can get and give as little as possible."" Don't forget, honey, never let one man worry your mind. Find them, fool them, forget them. Thanks again. Hello, how's the joints tonight? Fine. Swell, Tira. Hello, Tira. This is the first chance I've had to talk to you. - When are we going out again together? - Almost anytime you say, Harry. I got to see you more often. - You know, I'm kind of crazy about you. - Oh, yeah? - Can't get you out of my mind. - That's bad. Better not be thinking about me when you're up there in the flying rings. - Something's liable to happen. - Not a chance. How about us going somewhere after the show tonight? Not tonight, I gotta see my aunt. Tira, us fellows are worried about Harry here. He don't eat enough, won't even sleep enough. Love, you know, is bad for an acrobat. Don't worry. I ain't gonna hurt him. I only wanna feel his muscles. Bye, Harry. I never met anybody just like you before. You're different. Anything different always costs more but it's worth it. By the way, you married or single? Married five times. Five times. Wedding bells must sound like an alarm clock to you. I don't' suppose you believe in marriage, do you? Only as a last resort. What do you do for a living? I'm sort of a politician. I don't like work, either. I like to get around and travel. Believe me, I've been places and seen things. I've been things and seen places. That sort of evens us up, eh? Sit down. I didn't get your name. I don't give my name to everybody, but it's... Don't tell me it's Smith. No. - Brown. Ernest Brown. - That will do. What colour are you eyes? I don't know. You like them? Lovely. Where did you say you are from? Don't think I've said, but I'm from Dallas, Texas. Dallas, huh? I see. Pardon me. Dallas, huh? There we are. Dallas, huh? No one loves me like that Dallas man Bet your life no one loves you like that Dallas man. Kisses sweet like honey Oh, yeah? Smiles that big and sunny No one loves me like that Dallas man Why, folks, he's got backbone He's a Texas cyclone No one loves me like that Dallas man Why, brother, he's a wild-horse trainer With a special whip Gals, you'll go insaner When he gets you in his grip Strong arms made for loving Heat like from an oven No one loves me like that Dallas man You just put your heart and soul in your dancing, don't you, honey? You've certainly given me the time of my life, baby. Don't say ""given,"" I don't like that word ""given."" Do pretty well for yourself, don't you? That's nothing. Ever take a crack at show business? That's one business I never tried. You ought to do great in that racket. In front of the tent, the big boss. You mean with a cigar? You catch on. Maybe I can fix it up with Mr. Barton to sell you an interest in the show. Then I can take the leading lady out all the time, huh? That's the angle. We'll talk that over later. Remember your five wives. You're the baby that can make me forget them. Kiss Papa. Give me a long one. You ain't the only girl I've ever kissed. You got a lot to learn even at that. What do you mean by busting in here like this? What are you doing here with my wife? Your wife? He's lying, I ain't his wife. You can't get away with this. Listen, you're in a tough spot. Wait, let me get this straight. You got it straight. It's gonna be just too bad for you when I call the cops. You can't shake this guy down. Here I am about to promote him for dough, you come in to spoil it. Don't give me that. I get it. You all don't have to talk it over. I reckon I'm leaving right now. No, you ain't. There's a business matter to settle first. I won't give you a nickel. You picked the wrong one. I got connections in this town. I'll see that you get what's coming to you. Now wait a minute. I've laid out bigger chumps than you, you mug. - Now try and get out of this. - You're in it with me. As fast as you pick them up, I'll drop them. Yeah? He ain't doing so good. You better look him over. - I think he's croaked. - Ain't that nice. I told you them barroom tricks of yours will get us in trouble. Come on, we gotta lam. What? Leave him here in my place for the cops to find? I ain't taking any rap for something you've done. You like me to get sent up, so you can have a free hand with the boys. What a good time you'd have. Listen, you may be tired of me, but I ain't tired of you. There ain't no time for that now. Get him out of here. Where am I gonna put a stiff in this joint? Put him out in the hall. They can't tell who did it then. Hey, lay off. Ain't you got no respect for the dead? Come on, let's blow. Is he dead? He's coming around. Got a crack on his head. Wonder how. Did you people hear any noise? Sure, I heard a phonograph playing. That's it. Take it easy, partner. Got any idea who did this? It's one of them circus fellows. - Pick him out? - Sure I can pick him. - Say, I've been robbed! - Are you sure? I had a diamond that big in a ring on my finger. We'll get some of the boys to pick him up if he ain't left town. - Can you make the grade? - Sure. Right this way. That's him. Through the tent. Move, boys. That's him. That's him, men, hurry up. There he goes. Don't let him get away. Catch him, men. You're not going to pull that on me. Help! None of that. Don't start no riot. - That's him. - Go ahead, frisk him. Come on. That's it. You sure? I can prove it. Take him along. - But it's mine. - It's evidence, give it here. Come on. - Our phone working? - Yeah. Thanks. - Hello. Give me long distance. - Long distance? - Ain't you never heard of it? - Anything wrong? Cops picked up Slick for knocking over a guy and lifting his diamond ring. He pulled that job here? Don't worry. You're safe. It's me that they... Hello. Long distance? I want to talk to Benny Pinkowitz. New York City. I don't know. He lives around 88th Street and Riverside Drive. Pinkowitz. Pinkowitz, I said. All right, I'll spell it for you. ""P"" like in pansy. I- N-K-O-W... ""W"" like in witch. No, witch! Dame misunderstood me. I- T... ""T"" like in tomato. ""Z."" Put them all together, they spell ""Pinkowitz."" All right, you'll ring me? Okay. Why are you calling that shyster? He helped me beat one rap, and he can do it again. How're you mixed up in this? Like an olive in a martini. Hello. That's service. Hello, Benny? Benny, this is Tira. Hello, Tira. It's all right. You didn't disturb me. What is this time? Can that be the truth? All right, I'll catch the first train out. Maybe for you, Tira, I can do something. But as for Slick, I ain't so sure. Say, have you got any money? It will take a nice piece of change to square up everything. About myself, I ain't asking a nickel. Don't worry, Benny. I'll have the money when you get here. Only work fast. Leave it to me. Goodbye. See you later. Hey, operator, listen... I don't accept reverse charges. Yeah. Bill, you gotta let me have some dough. You're asking favours of me now? All right, you win. Give me a light. If you'd been nicer to me and worked the way I wanted you to... why then... It's either one thing or the other. You fix me up with dough or I gotta get out of town. If Slick goes up, he's gonna drag me with him. I want the dough, and I'll pay you back as soon as I can. I wanna help around here. I'm willing to do my share, more than my share. I'll work them cats like they've never been worked. If it'll make you happy, I'll even stick my head in the big cat's mouth. Think it over. She'll stick her head in the big cat's mouth? This is big. If she'll do that, your fortune's as good as made. The Big Show would grab that act in a minute. They've been all season looking for an attraction like that. They've been wanting something big. This is it. Can't you see it? The 24 sheets, ""Dame Sticks Her Beautiful Head in a Lion's Mouth."" The jaws of death! I mean, it's stupendous! Don't you realise you'd be a chump not to cash in on it? Give yourself a break. If I can't sell that act to the Big Show in 10 minutes, my name ain't Flea Madigan. Tell them we can handle them cats like nobody else. She's safer in that cage than in bed. I don't doubt it. - Tira, I've changed my mind. - Does it work any better? I've got your money. It's a drop in the bucket to what you'll get. There is a Santa Claus, but why the great joy? We can sell the act to the Big Show. That was a great idea you got. - What idea was that? - Sticking your head in the lion's mouth! Who's sticking whose head in whose mouth? You! It's marvellous, it's stupendous! It's lousy. You can't back out on me. What do you think I am, screwy? Sticking my head in a lion's mouth. Don't make me laugh, I ain't in the mood. He'll let you stick your hand in, why not your head? You're crazy if you don't grab this chance. It means a fortune. Think of it, all the dough you can use! What is the proposition? The Big Show, playing big cities. Your name in 1,000-watt Mazdas. No more worrying, no more doubling, all the clothes you want. What good will clothes do me without a head? It's a cinch for you, Tira. Big Boy will never hurt you. He's young, you'll never have to use another cat. The Big Show, playing in all the big cities. The silk hats, the Rolls-Royce cars... the clothes, the jewels, the smart money. Meeting the swells, huh? Boys, I think you got me sold. The only trouble with a trick like that... if it don't work the first time, you don't get a second chance. - How much dough you got? - A couple of grand. Let's have it. I may need more later. Here, sign. What's the matter, don't you trust me? I wouldn't trust my own mother, you know that. I'll hop that first plane in the morning and I'll... Joe, open up this cage. I'm going in. All right. Now listen, honey, there's a little something I wanna talk over with you. Now this is what you got to do. - When does this lion tamer appear? - Few minutes. - 9:45, to be exact. - How do you know? Why, it's here on the programme. Ladies and gentlemen... I take great pleasure in introducing to you... Tira, the million-dollar beauty! You see her? She is something special, isn't she? I'll say, she's fascinating. Where were you last night? Give me a peek. Come on, talk to me. Come on, get up. Come on, speak up for yourself. What's the matter with you? You gotta be sitting? Get up. Yeah, you'll end up as a rug. Come on, you're holding up the works, you mug. Come on, get up there. Give us a peek. Romeo, what's the matter with you? Come on, get up there, that's it. And now, ladies and gentlemen... for the first time since Nero threw the Christians to the lions... you will see feminine beauty, triumphant and unafraid. Miss Tira will defy death by placing her head... in the jaws of the king of beasts. Miss Tira! If them lions don't show some sense, I'm going down and bite her myself. Come on, handsome, say, ""Ah."" Come on, big guy. That's it. Remember my contract, baby. - That was great, wasn't it? - I didn't see anything great about it. Look here, I happen to know her publicity man. - How would you all like to go back... - I'm for that. Oh, no. Let's do, Alicia. We don't care about seeing the rest of the show, do we? - No. - And it'll be a lot of fun knowing her. It's absurd to make such a fuss over an ordinary circus performer. - Are we going, or aren't we? - We certainly are. Well, let's go. Very well. I suppose I must bow before the general enthusiasm. Beulah, that's another performance under my belt and I still got the face. Bless you, child, I hopes you always keeps it. It's my fortune. When I was born with this face, it was the same as striking oil. Yes, ma'am. You sure do believe in that horoscope, don't you, Miss Tira? It tells me everything. I wouldn't make a move without it. Yes, indeed, Tira enjoys meeting people. You'll find her a regular fellow. She has to be in the mood. That is, her work is very strenuous and stars will be temperamental at times. - Yes, so I've heard. - Yes. Excuse me just a moment. See who that is. Evening, Mr. Madigan. May I see Miss Tira, please? Yes, sir. Come in, Flea. - Are you in the mood? - For what? Silk hats. I can get that way. Okay, Beulah. Step right in, please. Thank you. Just make yourself right at home. Miss Tira'll be out directly. That's nice. Appreciate it. Thank you. Mr. And Mrs. Fletcher, Mr. And Mrs. Bond. How do you do? Mr. Lawrence and Miss Hatton. Pleased to meet you, won't you sit down? Thank you. Won't you sit down? If you don't mind, I'd rather wait in the lounge. Pleased to have met you, anyway. Now, let's see, where were we? I was about to say, we really came back to tell you what a thrill you gave us. Thank you, I'm glad you liked my act. It is kind of unusual. I don't see how you get up enough courage to thrust your head in that beast's mouth. I often wonder myself. It seems terribly dangerous. It is, that's why I have to carry a rod, I mean a gun. I had to shoot a lion once. Really, was he mad? He wasn't exactly pleased about it. Would you be so good as to autograph my programme? Love to. I should think you dread every new performance. It is kind of wearing on the nerves. Of course, I don't intend to do this all my life. - Thanks. - And mine? I don't believe after all this excitement, that you'd enjoy being idle. I'll be doing something. Say, I've got a great idea. Why don't you have supper with us? We'd love to have you. Thanks, but I've previous engagements. That's too bad. - It's been such a great pleasure to meet you. - Thank you. Permit me to say, I think you're perfectly wonderful. Coming from a woman, that's a big compliment. Delighted. It's been charming to meet you lovely people. Have a lovely evening. Good night. Anyway, you've been awfully kind. I'll never forget you. No one ever does. - Good night. - Good night. Swell person, isn't she? I'm so glad we met her. How about taking a look at the lion she works with? Good idea. We'll wait for Alicia. Yes. We'll join you later. Until then. Don't be long. All right. Beulah, remind me to tell Flea Madigan to get that blue book in here... with the 400 in it. So I'll know who's who and what's what in this town. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Lawrence, huh? Did you have a nice visit with your lion tamer? Alicia, she's marvellous. You really should've stayed. - Such good fun. - Nonsense. I can't see why everybody's so absolutely gaga about her. She's obviously a person of the commonest sort. Not at all. Of course, she would impress the men. They all have low minds. And she's certainly low enough to appeal to them. Alicia, how can you say that? We all have a right to our own opinion and I think she's cruel... and a very ill-bred person. I've never been so... I must get out of this place before I scream. Can you imagine that broad discussing me in that manner? Say, I like them brocades. - Order me six more pair in the morning. - Yes, ma'am. - Is you in to anyone else? - I'm meeting all comers tonight. Sorry, I believe I left my cane inside. He says he left his cane. Come in, Mr. Lawrence. Let's find it. It isn't necessary, I know right where I left it. - You got a good memory. - I ought to, since I left it here on purpose. You mean you planted that stick? Sure. Had to find a way to see you alone. I've seen your show three times and I think you're wonderful. - You're dazzling, beautiful, gorgeous... - Wait a minute, take it slower. What I mean is, let's get better acquainted. You know, we can have a lot of fun together. You'll like me when you know me. I'm not half bad. If you're half the man I think you are, you'll do. - I am. - Oh, well. Come on, let's go out tonight. I'll ditch the crowd. - I told you I have a previous engagement. - Break it. - You'll never regret it. - No. I'd love to, but I've got to meet my aunt. These relatives are a nuisance at times. What about tomorrow? For breakfast, lunch, dinner, anything. Let me see. Breakfast I have in bed, so that's out. I don't eat lunch, and dinner... We'll make it supper tomorrow night. That's a date, then we'll go out. I like sophisticated men to take me out. I'm not really sophisticated. You're not really out yet, either. You got me. Have I? I guess I'd better be going before they come in here and get me. - Tomorrow night, then. - That's the night. Beulah, bring me my horoscope. - Here it is. - That's service. That man sure is crazy about you, ain't he? Crazy about me? The guy's a pushover for me. Thank you, Mr. Lawrence. That will be delivered to Miss Tira today. We will deliver the card to Miss Tira on Wednesday. All right, Miss Tira, Mr. Lawrence has arranged for the account. Yeah? Now let me see. My, oh, my! Look at that. I always love to be in bright lights My streets are paved with gold I found myself a new kind of man Sing it, honey. He's mine to have and hold And how. I'm in my glory when he's around Yes, ma'am. Found a new way to go to town - Miss Tira, you got something. - Something not bad, huh? Not bad? I've never seen such presents as this here Mr. Kirk Lawrence done give you. You sure skinned him pretty. You only knowed him a week. Yeah, but what a week! He's crazy about you, same as all the rest. I don't see how any man could help loving you. I don't give them any help, they do it themselves. You do keep me busy keeping track of your gentleman friends. I want to make it easy for you, Beulah... I'm thinking about putting in a filing system. Yes, ma'am. Men don't mean a thing to me. Be careful with that million-dollar foot. I don't know, but me and men do pretty well together. What kind of men do you like, Libby? I'm just crazy about dark men. Dark men? You ought to have a big time in Africa. Yes, ma'am. Don't get those nails too short, or they'll think I bite them. Miss Tira, I've been under the impression you is a one-man woman. I am, one man at a time. Beulah. Yes, ma'am. Fetch me that importation. You mean this one? Yes, that Parisian one. Yes, ma'am. I play to win the game of romance With high cards in my hands But I've been trumped by an ace of hearts That feeling's oh, so grand Give me my parasols and fancy gowns I found a new way to go to town I'm high Yes, ma'am. I'm low Takes a good man to break me Sure does. No man can shake me Until I let him go Oh de lum Come on. Is it a flash or is it a flash? That's beautiful. I know it's beautiful, but I'm asking you is it a flash? It's a flash, all right. - Kind of daring, huh? - Not for you, it ain't. That's all I want to know. If that's that house detective, tell him I'm... I never will get used to this joint. - Show the gentleman in. - Yes, ma'am. Get me my beads. You mean that pretty necklace you just had give to you? Yeah, the necklace. I will say beads. - Pretty, ain't it? - I'll say it is. I just wonder how much money that costs? I couldn't tell you right now, but I have an idea... It ain't no he, it's a she. Says her name is Miss Hatton. - Miss who? - Miss Hatton. - Pardon me. - Yes, ma'am. So it's you. You know why I'm here. Hardly. You see I'm a lion tamer, not a mind reader. Then it might refresh you to know that I'm Kirk's fiance. Nothing refreshing about that. - I want to know just what you intend to do. - What do you mean? You know you're making a fool of him. He ain't any different than when I first met him, not much. Everyone knows we're engaged and yet you're deliberately interfering. I ain't interfering with nothing. - If Kirk prefers my company to yours... - No, he doesn't, he only imagines he does. I'll admit the boy has got a great imagination. It's perfectly obvious what your intentions are. Kirk has lots of money... Wait a minute. Whatever you're thinking, you're wrong. I only like him like a brother. You ain't got nothing to worry about. - You're a liar! - Say, listen you... a better dame than you once called me a liar... and they had a sew her up in 12 different places. You're lucky I'm a little more refined than I used to be. And if you were as much a lady as I am... you'd get out of here before I get real sore. - You haven't a streak of decency in you. - I don't show my good points to strangers. I'll trouble you to scram. Just a minute. I realise there's only one thing that will influence you to leave Kirk alone. How much? Beulah. Yes, ma'am. Peel me a grape. I can't wait any longer. You'd better go. - I'm not going to Texas. That's final. - You're being ridiculous. This mad infatuation of yours for this... lion tamer, will ruin your life and Alicia's, too. Don't you worry about Alicia. You seem to forget that you're an engaged man. Jack, it's no good arguing. I'll handle my own affairs. - You're gonna continue with this woman? - Indefinitely. - You're mad. - Right. Leave that where you found it. Well, hello, baby. Here I am. So I see. When'd did they open the pearly gates for you? Yesterday. Glad to see me? Sure, don't I look it? - And you ain't sore. - Why should I be? You've done the time, not me. How did you happen to come up here? The show was laying off this week, so I looks up Barton. He tells me what a swell joint you got here. You've done pretty nice for yourself. From a tent to a penthouse. Yeah, this is a great layout. This is one place you ain't laying out in, honey. I guess that sort of means I don't exactly fit in around here. I wouldn't say that. The whole trouble with you, you got nervous fingers. I'm all washed up with that. What are you figuring on doing for a living? I don't know. I'm sort of up against it. I thought maybe you might... Pulling the sob on me? No, I... I'll do something for you... if you promise to keep your hands in your own pockets. - Baby, I'd promise you anything. - But would you keep it? - Do you want me to swear? - Never mind, I can do that myself. Listen, go see Barton. Tell him I said to find something for you to do over there. And here, take this. But don't make a habit of it. Get yourself some clothes so you start looking normal again. Say, you're a pal. - You know there never was a dame like you. - Forget that. Okay, but I just want you to know I'm still warm for you, baby. - Maybe I'll be seeing you. - Make it soon, will you? Get going. That guy would show up now. Excuse me. - Miss Tira's apartment? - Yes, sir. Just say if she can spare the time, Mr. Clayton would like to see her. I will if I can remember it, if not, I'll just say he's here. Perhaps that will do as well. Take the gentleman's hat and coat. Thanks. I hope I haven't disturbed you. Not so far. Anything I can do for you? Yes, there is, but first I better introduce myself. That's not necessary, I know who you are. I've heard Kirk speak of you. Good, that simplifies matters. It's on Kirk's account I'm here. I see. Let's sit down and be comfortable about it. I hope I can come right to the point. About this situation between you and Kirk... he's neglecting important business on your account. And there's Miss Hatton, his fiance, to be considered. She's a novel twist. Of course, I know you have no liking for Miss Hatton. She came in here, got nasty, I had to put her in her place. Yes, I heard you had some slight misunderstanding. Do you mind if I get personal? Go right ahead. I don't mind if you get familiar. It's all in the family. Well, then, do you really care for Kirk? I mean, do you love him? I don't know. See, my horoscope says so. I'm afraid I don't understand. I'm afraid I don't understand it myself sometimes. You see, it describes a guy, I mean, a man like Kirk. Surely you're not being serious. Why, I certainly am. My whole life is ruled by astrology. Well... What colour eyes have you got? I don't know. Fine. Well, as you were saying... You're telling me simply because Kirk fits some description in your horoscope... that you'd deliberately break up things between him and Miss Hatton? Maybe it would be a good break for him. Surely you wouldn't let personal dislike destroy their engagement. Unless, of course, you have serious intentions. What if I have? I'm afraid that's impossible. Listen, with me nothing is impossible. That may be. But I'm here to tell you, if you're thinking of marrying Kirk, you better not count on it. Kirk sent you up here with that line? He doesn't know I'm here. I get it. You figure the family honour needs protecting. A circus dame would be sort of a red leaf on the family tree, is that it? Please understand that it's been difficult for me... to come here and talk to you about what you no doubt consider is none of my business. That's all right, I don't care. If someone's got something on their mind, I like them to get it off. - You're an unusual sort of person. - I've been accused of that. As a matter of fact, I'd much rather have met you under pleasanter circumstances. Same here, there's no hard feelings. Of course not. I shouldn't want you to feel unfriendly toward me. I shouldn't want you to get the impression that I'm just an adventuress. - I didn't think that. - What did you think? I had no definite idea what you would be like. I've seen newspaper pictures of you. Yeah? Ever seen this one here? There's one of my favourites. - It looks just like you. - It should, I posed for it. - You like it? - Yes. You can have it. No, thanks, I wouldn't want to deprive you... It's all right, I get them by the hundreds, frame and all. Well, in that case... Won't you stay? I'll ring for tea. No, thanks, really, I must be going. You've been wonderful. You've been kind of wonderful yourself. Thank you. Now you'll consider all I've said and try and bring Kirk to his senses. I can't promise anything right now, but... you have started a new train of thought in my mind. I'll think it over and let you know what I decide. - You'd be doing a fine thing. - Yeah? Fine for who? For all of us. You're kind of unusual yourself. I've been accused of that. Now you can reach me there at any time. And I want to thank you for the way you received me. And you can reach me there at any time. You'll hear from me. That will be fine. You fascinate me. You'd better go. Good night. Hello. Miss Tira calling. Good. Put her on. Mr. Clayton? I've been thinking over everything you said and... I've made my decision. Good. I'm glad you made up your mind quickly. I'm very quick in a slow way. You see I can't discuss it over the phone. It's got a lot of angles to it. You better come up and see me. I'll be glad to. In fact, I'll come over right away if it's convenient for you. Most convenient. I'll tell you this much... you're gonna like what I got in mind. I'll be ready. Goodbye. - Hello, honey. - Good evening, Miss Tira. If anyone should call, I'm indisposed. Yes, ma'am. You know what I mean, don't you? Yes, ma'am. Come here, dear. I haven't had you alone all evening with all those people. My public. Let me take a good look at you. You were wonderful tonight. I'm always wonderful at night. Yes, but tonight you were especially good. When I'm good, I'm very good. But when I'm bad... I'm better. Don't go away, I'll be right back. No one loves me like that New York man You must've had a good time, you seem so happy. If I wasn't, you'd know it. Get me another gown, Beulah. I've danced this one around all evening. I gotta give it a rest. Yes, ma'am. Which one? - That lucky one. - Yes, ma'am. - That guy's got rhythm, eh? - Yes, I know what you means. Bring out a couple of drinks and then you two dames can retire. - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. Open up that door. Here goes my big moment. Don't stop, honey, you put me in the mood. It's good to be here alone with you, dear. I kind of like it, too. The only thing I've got to be jealous. - Of course, if I could only trust you. - You can, hundreds have. Do you know I'm mad about you? I could tell you'd be, the first time I saw you. Say, I must be transparent. Honey, you're just wrapped in cellophane. Come on, darling. - Be serious. - You want me to? - Sure I do. - All right, now I'm very serious. I adore you. Yes, ma'am. How am I doing, Beulah? You're doing fine, you're doing grand. I'll do better when you are gone, you rascal, you! Yes, ma'am, I know you will, ma'am. Great gals, huh? Honey, I wonder if you realise just how much you mean to me. - I've never been so happy in my life. - You mean that? I guess love is a wonderful thing. Yes, I've heard it highly praised. No one could be half as nice as you What have you done to me You're simply grand You worked your spell on me So make your demand I want you, I need you Your love must be mine oh, baby, baby To have you would be paradise divine - Move over, honey, and don't stop. - I'll never stop. Want you, need you To call you my own To have you would be paradise I know Please won't you believe me Darling, you can never guess how much I love you. I'll never guess, you've got to you show me. - Just give me the chance. - You'll get it. To have you I could be your slave. I guess that could be arranged. What have you done to me? You're simply grand What have you done to me? You ought to know. So make your demand I want you, need you Your love must be mine oh, baby, baby To have you would be paradise What are you gonna do about it? What's this in the paper about you marrying this rich guy, Clayton? If it's publicity it's great, and if it ain't, it's no good. I'm quitting the show. - You're quitting? - Yeah, I'm sick of this racket. I found the right man, I'm gonna get married. You can't quit. - You got a five year contract with me. - Yeah? Did you ever read it? It says for a good cause you could give a two week's notice. - I'm giving you that notice now. - But you ain't got no good cause. Marriage is a good enough cause for anything. You can't do that to me and get away with it. No? What's my picture doing by that skunk? I figured it belonged there. What do you mean? Everybody used to call me ""The Bull."" You may be the bull to them, but you're just plain skunk to me. I got everything set. You get to the apartment and see everything's clear. All right. But suppose Tira gets back before we spring it. I got the chauffer fixed... so there'll be trouble with the car on the road. Now, get going. Every minute counts. Can't you hurry and get that thing fixed, I gotta get back. I'm expecting Mr. Clayton at the apartment. Doing the best I can, ma'am. Your best is no good, try your worst. Yes, ma'am. Say, where are we? I thought we were in Jersey. We're in Jersey, ma'am. You sure you didn't take the wrong road and land in Brazil? No, ma'am. Come on. Yes, ma'am. Tira. What do you want? You're Clayton. I know all about you and Tira. But that's all finished. I've been away, but I'm back again and she ain't wanting no change. We're going on just the same as before. - Get it? - No, I don't get it. - Where's Miss Tira? - She ain't here now. She knew you was coming and she didn't want to see you. What're you talking about? She didn't like to tell you herself, so I'm doing it for her. Ain't that enough? Yes, I guess that's enough. This is the right thing to do, Jack. With a woman of her type, this would have happened sooner or later. If you ask me, I think you're lucky. Maybe you are right. Frank, get a messenger and send that at once, will you? I'm gonna be out of town for three or four weeks. In the meantime, I'm out to all callers. Everybody, understand? Is that message for Miss Tira, too? Yes. But I understood you were to be married this month. We're both mistaken. Yes, sir. What have you done to me You're simply grand You worked your spell on me So make your demand I want you, I need you Your love must be mine You sure gonna make a gorgeous bride. I know I'm gonna make a nervous bride. I ain't never done this before. Marriage is a new kind of racket for me. I've been married four times. You ought to do well in the wholesale business. I don't wanna see anyone but Mr. Clayton. Yes, ma'am. That Mr. Clayton is sure a wonderful man. I'll say he is. I never knew I could go for anyone like I have for him. He made me feel like a different dame. I ain't just a ""Sister Honky Tonk"" no more. You're a lady now. Thank you. Some messenger gave me this note to give you, Miss Tira. Yeah? You can go. This is Miss Tira speaking. I'm sorry, madam, Mr. Clayton's gone away. Gone away? When is he expected back? I couldn't say definitely but I'm sure not for several weeks. - Is that the only message he left for me? - Yes, that's all. Thanks. Hello, Tira darling. Benny. How are you? You look so marvellous. Come right in, sit right down and make yourself at home. Let me look at that beautiful smile of yours. You know about me getting married? Sure. Congratulations. Too late. It's all off. Sue the guy for breach of promise. Certainly. - The lowlife. - No, he ain't, Benny. The first guy I ever really loved. - I thought he loved me, too. - What a tragedy. We start proceedings immediately. How much is he worth? Millions. Millions? We sue him for damages. I ain't damaged. I just want you to sue him for breach of promise. I got all the proof you want, letters, wires, newspaper stories, even my trousseau. For that trousseau alone we collect plenty. It's a cinch. When do you want the case tried? Let me see. I go on the road with the show and... I'll be back in a few months. - Better start then. - Easy. Got the case. Darling, you give me a few details and I'll serve him with papers right away. Okay. First, I'll tell you how I met the guy. But remember in anything I say I ain't got any real animosity for him. Of course. - If I was a home girl, I'd be heartbroken. - Yes. Miss Tira, I understand you've had a rather colourful past. I gotta admit I've been the love interest in more than one guy's life. I don't see what my past has got to do with my present. We shall show that to the satisfaction of the court, I believe. Nevertheless, the fact remains that you've been on... friendly terms with several men. All right, I'm a sweetheart of Sphigma Psi, so what? You must answer questions directly, please. Pardon me, Judge. Proceed. Do you know a man named Wiley... generally called Slick? Yes, I know the... The gentleman. And you recall the man you see there? If I'm not mistaken, you mean that Dallas man. And you are also acquainted, aren't you, with Mr. Kirk Lawrence? Yes, I had the pleasure. And no doubt you recall those five gentlemen... seated in the first row right inside the railing? Mr. Blake, Mr. Larson, Mr. Willard... Mr. Foster, Mr. Harris. I do recall their faces but them ain't the names they gave me. Pardon me again, Judge. It's all right. That's all, Miss Tira. Does the plaintiff's attorney wish any further questions? I would like to request recess for about 10 minutes. Is that agreeable to the defence? Perfectly. This court's adjourned for 10 minutes. Why did you admit that you knew all these men? I do know them. You don't want me to commit perjury? Yes, why didn't you tell me there was so many men in your life? Why shouldn't I know guys? I've been around. I travel from coast to coast. A dame like me can't make trips like that without meeting any of the male population. Listen to me, Tira. You know me, I'm a smart lawyer. Give me that much loophole and I'm through it like an eel. With what all those guys, all those riffraffs, pardon me... going up to the judge and telling all they know about you and them. - It's curtains for us. - You mean we're finished? Yeah, sure, drop it. You had enough publicity. What those guys are gonna tell the judge won't read so nice in the newspapers. I ain't gonna drop it. Listen, Benny, have I a right to question witnesses myself? Yeah, sure but... - That's what I'm gonna do. - You don't mean it. Now Mr. Brown, just tell the jury in your words, what took place. I was watching her dance and I seen her looking at me. I kind of looked back and she flirted and made a date with me. So, I took her out for a ride in my car... and she asked me up to her hotel room where she was living. We had a couple of drinks... and she put on a phonograph record and we danced. And while we was dancing, she kissed me. And how long were you with Miss Tira in her hotel room? - Close to a couple hours, I should say. - That's all, Mr. Brown. Cross-examine. My client begs the permission of the court... to question the defence witness herself. It's a little unusual, but quite within the plaintiff's right. She may question the witnesses. If you please... the court should warn the jury not to be swayed... by any theatricalism by the plaintiff. The jury in weighing the evidence will bear in mind the defence's warning. Proceed. Lovely tie. Mr. Brown, aren't you the man that had the five wives? Yeah. And you was married to one when you were with me, wasn't you? - Yes. - Cheating. You made it sound nasty the way you spoke about us two... being alone together in my place. And you know nothing happened that you couldn't tell your grandchildren about. Well, I... In other words, it was just a harmless little social date, wasn't it? - Yeah. - Okay, I'm through with you. How am I doing? Any further questions? You're excused, Mr. Brown. Next witness. Mr. Kirk Lawrence. Mr. Kirk Lawrence, take the stand. Quiet, please. Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Take the stand. Aren't you well-acquainted with the plaintiff? - Yes. - In fact, you were intimate friends. Yes. Isn't it true that you once seriously contemplated asking her to marry you? Yes. Now, I understand that after knowing you only a week... the plaintiff accepted several thousand dollars worth of gifts from you. Such as a diamond bracelet... Gowns, a fur coat... That's correct. And almost immediately after accepting these gifts... she became engaged to Mr. Clayton, isn't that so? Yes. And after becoming engaged she refused to talk to you, even on the telephone. Yes. Mr. Clayton has more money than you have, hasn't he? That's true. What construction did you place upon this woman's treatment of you? In plain words, I felt she simply played me for a good thing. Thank you, Mr. Lawrence. Your witness. You're not looking to get those presents back, are you, Mr. Lawrence? No, of course not. - I don't expect you to return them, anyway. - You're right, I wouldn't. You gave me those presents because you liked me a little, didn't you? Yes. I didn't ask you for them, did I? I don't regret giving them to you, if that's what you mean. Thanks, I didn't think you did. Now, you was engaged to marry a girl... just at the time you started running around with me, wasn't you? Yes. And you know your fiance came up to me to see me... to ask me to break it off with you, don't you? I heard so. All right, I broke it off. So what are you crying about? Your Honour, this sort of questioning is most irregular. The plaintiff, not being a practicing attorney... may put her questions as best she can. Thanks, Judge, you're regular. I'm doing my best to be legitimate. That's all with you. Any further questions? Defence is ready for the next witness. Excused. Proceed. Miss Beulah Thorndyke. They had nerve enough to call my own maid to squeal on me? You are Miss Tira's personal maid, aren't you? I was, but I ain't sure now. As her personal maid, it was your duty to answer telephone calls... and admit visitors to the apartment? Yes, ma'am... Yes, sir. Miss Tira often had gentlemen callers, didn't she? Quite some. During the time Miss Tira and Mr. Clayton were engaged... did she have other men visitors? Not that I recall. You have a very convenient memory. That's all. Cross-examine. Shadow, what are you doing here? I don't know. They done subpoenaed me. - Beulah, tell the boys the truth. - Yes, ma'am. After Mr. Clayton and me became engaged... did you ever hear me talk about any other man... or did you ever see me with any other man... - outside of my manager, Mr. Barton? - No, ma'am. Did you ever hear me make any cracks about Mr. Clayton's money? - No, ma'am. - Did you hear me talk about Mr. Clayton? Oh, yes, ma'am. What did you hear me say? - You said... - Just a minute. Tell the jury. - Is that all right with you, Judge? - Yes. Proceed. You said that you never knew you could love a man like you love him. I kind of forgot I said that. And you said you had fallen so hard for him that it hurt. Wait a minute. Answer one question at a time. I just telling the truth like you told me to. Yes, but you're telling too much of it. I ain't never seen nobody so brokenhearted as you was... when you and Mr. Clayton done bust up. That's enough, Beulah. You're ruining my character. I object, Your Honour. This witness' testimony is entirely irrelevant. I move to strike it from record. Motion denied. Any more questions? No. You're excused. Next witness. Call Mr. Slick Wiley to the stand. Mr. Wiley, Mr. Slick Wiley, please take the stand. - Bob, do you have to question this man? - Of course, Jack. He'll win our case for us. She can't laugh him off. Don't mention the night I found him at her apartment. I've got to ask him about that. That's what I'm depending on. I don't want you to mention it. All right, I'll keep it as clean as I can. When he gets through with Slick, we haven't got a chance. Mr. Wiley, you know the plaintiff, Miss Tira, very well, do you not? Sure, we've been like that. During the time... the plaintiff was engaged to the defendant, Mr. Clayton... were you friendly with her? Never better. Isn't it true the plaintiff used to give you sums of money at times for your own use? Yeah, sure. She was always a good for anywhere from $10 to a C-note. Isn't it also a fact... that you kept personal belongings in the plaintiff's apartment? And that on at least once you were seen in her apartment only partly dressed? You mean in pyjamas? Yes. Yeah, I always kept two pair there. Silk ones. One green and one purple with yellow stripes. Mr. Wiley, did the plaintiff ever suggest to you... her interest in the defendant was principally because of his wealth? Yeah, sure. She always looked to hook some guy with a lot of dough. That's all, Mr. Wiley. Cross-examine. Where were you on the night of June 7? I don't remember. All right, I'll give you a choice, where were you any night last June, July, or August? Come on, make up your mind. In stir. That's it, speak up so they can hear you. He was in stir. That means, in other words, gentlemen of the jury, he was in jail. Tell the gentlemen how many other jails you been in the last 10 years. I don't remember. He can't remember. And what's this about you owning silk pyjamas? You know it's a lie. You forgot to tell these good people... the only time I gave you money was when you got out of jail... you were broke, and walking on your heels. You heel. As for you sitting in my apartment in silk pyjamas... you never sat around my apartment in nothing. And you know it. Answer me, did you? Sure, I did. - And I was seen there, too. - Why you... You perjurer. I object to the witness being harassed this way. Who's harassing who? I'm just asking for a square deal, that's all. I'm asking good, honest, and intelligent people not to take... the word of an ex-convict against a good, honest and innocent woman. I object, Your Honour. Objection overruled. You're right, Judge. There you are. She's got the jury and the judge under her arm. They'll hand her the case on a silver platter. - Don't be unfair. - Unfair? You've got so much money, you don't mind losing this case. But my reputation means something to me. If ever there was a case I wanted to win, this is it. I told you not to put the man on the stand in the first place. You'll have to take stand and tell your story. I'll do nothing of the kind. If you feel that way about it, why did you contest the case at all? I'm sorry I did. If any right-thinking man will believe what a crook and a jailbird will say... then there's nothing I could say that'll make any difference. I'm through with this guy, Judge. Do you wish to question the witness further? Yes. I have a few questions I should like to ask. - Mr. Wiley... - Stop. Sit down. That's enough. Call it off. - I'll settle for the amount asked. - You're absolutely mad. I don't want it to go any further, do you understand? All right, have it your own way. If you want to make a fool of yourself over this woman, I can't stop you. Don't try to. Your Honour... my client has requested me, for some peculiar reason of his own... to cease contest of this suit. He's prepared to settle for the full amount of the case. How extraordinary. I'll say it is. - What is this, Benny? - Don't ask me, I'm paralysed. Sounds like a trick. Does the plaintiff accept this motion as satisfaction of this suit? Okay, the plaintiff accepts it with pleasure. In view of the agreement between the parties... the jury is discharged with thanks. Case dismissed. Court's adjourned. I'm glad you won your case, Miss Tira. That's our pleasure. Wait a minute. Boys, now, take it easy. I'll give you all the breaks in the worid but don't crowd. Pictures first. Miss Tira, would you stand up? Of course, if it'll make you happy. Look this way, please. Wait a minute boys, one at a time. I'm not twins. Hold that pose, please. That's it. All right. Hold for me, please. Thank you. - Will you answer a few questions, Miss Tira? - Of course. You've won the case. What do you intend to do? Carry on the same as before. Why did you admit knowing so many men in your life? It's not the men in your life that counts, it's the life in your men. Do you feel you've done right? Show me a woman who can do better. You were right, Judge. - It was nice of you to come up. - Thank you. You've been charming, my dear. Very charming. - I'm glad you found that out. - Of course. Well, goodbye. I see you've that hand trouble, too, huh? - Goodbye again. - Goodbye. Hello? Juror Number 4. Yes, I remember you. You were the one with the nice, kind face. I know you were for me. I wanna thank you for those beautiful flowers. They were lovely. And don't forget, come up and see me sometime. Mr. Clayton, how is you? Yes. All right, goodbye. You said things in the courtroom that led me to believe you loved me. That you still love me. Did you mean them? - What difference does it make now? - All the difference in the worid. You didn't believe me before. Because I didn't understand about Slick being up here that night. So that's it. I didn't understand it myself till I found out it was all a big frame-up. To keep me from leaving the show. Then let's forget the whole thing and go on together. - You sure you want it that way? - You know I do. Sit down. You're everything to me. Beulah. Yes, ma'am. Bring me my jewel case. - You're more fascinating than ever. - I get better as I go along. Here, Miss Tira. Got something for you. I'm glad to know it wasn't the money you wanted. You got a lot of other things it takes to make a woman happy. I'm crazy about you. I did my best to make you that way. Look, darling, you need a rest, and so do I. - Let me take you away somewhere. - Would you call that a rest? - What are you thinking about? - The same thing you are. Baby, I can warm you with this love of mine I'm no ngel Oh, let me feel my fingers running through your hair I can give you kisses till you Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, This is the day!

I haven't wash my body all at once since the new year! That won't do starting a new woman like this! Tea in the morning water in all this wasting! - Father? - Well, what is it? I'll be grateful to you if you... would please you to ask my friends for a feast tonight? - No! - A very small feast? - It's only this one? - No no no no no! Spend for a feast, make way for a famine. Good morning father Wong! It's going to rain! It is unlucky to mention it! I haven't said it would rain! I haven't said it! Here's some very bad wine for the bridegroom. This gift is much too good for my son. Oh is miserable wine! Where's the bridegroom? He's washing his whole body! Is that my friend Wong Loong? Shing! That's my son! Wasting good water before the rains come! Uh but the rains will come! And what's on the top of the water to you, a man who lives to see his grandson. Young men and fools are alike, until the gods teach them wisdom. And asking your few friends for a feast tonight. A very small feast, if you'll come my son will be honoured. You were boys together. Shing! This is the day! Chickens! Good buy! Eat! Good your blood and pure your liver! Peaches, 6 for 2 coppers! Now then what? I'm Wong Loong, the farmer. Well, and Wong Loong the farmer what? I'm coming... I'm coming... Are you seeing that? I see you a fool! There's a woman to be... Ha ha ha! So you're he! You're the bridegroom! I thought you're the peddler! Why do you bring a basket? Are you gonna carry that the whole day? The bridegroom! He comes! The bridegroom! He comes! The bridegroom! He's here! The bridegroom! He's here! The bridegroom! You fool, get up! Your farmer's come, he smells like a stable! Nobody giggles! Is all wreck crack yours? Open it! Open it! To see what's in it. There's a thief in every kitchen. When did you steal these? My mother gave'em to me. Save it for your own brats! Pick up your eggs! Hurry! This dress, the kitchen slave. This woman came into my house when she was a child. Her parents were farmers but during the famine they sold her to me for food. She has a strong body, and will work well for you in your house and your fields. Take her and use her well! Ou Lang! Over him! And bring him many sons. Bring the first son for me to see. Well? Go go go go! Take the box! Peaches! Fresh peaches! Good peaches are the friend! Good your blood and pure your liver! Peaches! Fresh peaches! Thank you! Peaches! Fresh peaches! They're yours! Eat for yourself. A tree will grow from the seeds. Hey, hey! Let him be! For very silent says she's a good cook! An excellent cook! I am an old man and I have never tasted such food before! Oh no it's very poor food! Very badly prepared, the woman can't cook at all! My friends, my poor farm barely produces enough to keep my family alive. But tonight, I rejoyce that my brother's son has been favoured by him. Are you, you, how beautiful it is, and how pretty, nephew? Forgive me! Poor Zon! He faked and shaved and hope we will all go home! No no no no! Your presence delights him! Then we'll all stay till cockcrow! May you have many grandsons! And she might beg for the first one! You want my old bones! Brother, your joy is mine! Nephew! Now that the woman will work in the house, you might help your old uncle in the fields? Alas I... Good night! Good night! Good night! Good night! Good night! Night! Night! It will grow! This is good land! An old one, my ancestors came here long ago! And they sleep in it! My father ploughed it, and it's mine! The best the man can have! Now it belongs to us both! It's raining! Why did you put up your hand? Were you afraid? Afraid of me? Were they cruel to you in the Great House? No one will be cruel to you here! I am with child. Enough for the day, We'll tell old father. Why have you left the field? She is with child already! Hey hey! She want me to be a grandfather. I shall prepare food now. Yes! Food! Food! Food! I know nothing of these things, when the child is born you need a woman. Perhaps there's a woman in the Great House. Someone you knew in the kitchen! Not in that house! Well... we're only two men here! There must be someone in the Great House... I'll never go back, in that house It will be with my son in the house I'll have a red coat on it, and a red flower trousers, and a hat with a buddha and tiger, and I'll go into a kitchen where I spend my days as a slave, and into the great hall where all the mistress sits with their pipe and I'll show myself and my son to all of them. Well! You know, I... I haven't heard you speak so many words... since you came into this house! Now then, why are you not in the fields today? The wheat must be cut! Today I shall not go into the fields. Look! Dark clouds! Rain? We'll loose the harvest! We'll starve this winter! Bring the others! Hey hurry with the wheat! There's hail in that storm! Let's go! Help me load the cart! What is it? Is it the child? I get a woman. No! Go back to the wheat! I play my king correctly! No you didn't! You lost every game correctly! Of course! How did I know what he had? You might have looked over his shoulders. But I didn't! You gave me the wrong sign! Hey! What did I tell you? And you made me play another game while this was happenning! Is it a man? Is it a man? A man! A man-child has been born! Behold we have a son! A man-child! A man-child! I'm a father! And you're a grandfather! I never could get my wife to work the way that woman did, with a child about to be born. If it weren't indignified, I'd tell her that she's a good wife! Nephew! I rejoyce with you! It's nothing that I lost my own wheat helping with the child, nothing! Hear him! Huh huh! I'll get eggs, and dye them red for the whole village. Everyone must know I have a son! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh my son is very pleased! Oh it was a dismal noise! No no! Very good noise! Now then! Those cakes are not to be eaten! Well! And I am poor but at least I can be honest! My dear nephew, please add this fowl to the little coloured eggs which you hadn't offered me! But they are gift for the Great House! Very bad for the stomach, only fit for rich people, if they are not too rich to accept them Those people are not as rich as you think! They are feeling pinch this year. I've heard that they are selling land. Land? Selling land? I heard it yesterday from their agent, At the gambling, at the tea house. Well, am I asked to fill my cup in this house of properity? Huh... please please! Ha ha ha ha ha! What have I not thought of... A good new year, a triumphant new year! Good night! Good bye! We could buy land, from the Great House! Rice land! Now then, if we lost our wheat we'll have no money. But we haven't! But how close it was! Between this money and nothing Not even food! When a man has 2 fields, or 3 fields he can loose his wheat and still have food. That rice land is sure! Had to be sure again I'd even go to the Great House and buy it! Do you think They'd kill me? Well, well! I'm not afraid! I go to the Great House to say, to tell'em I have important business. Money is concerned. What is a fair price, I have it in my hand! Well it was a good thought But what use is a good thought then? If no one agrees with it? And the child! A beautiful child! A beautiful boy! Boo boo boo boo! Ha ha ha ha ha! Here's the son of Wong Loong! Here's the son of Wong Loong the farmer! He's a man-child! He's a man-child! Miss Oh Lang, Wife Wong the farmer and her son you will announce them to ancient one. And you say her child would be a female. Ha ha ha ha! A female! Quiet! I'll cut off your own hands! Um! He has a sickly look. Very pale and green. Let's hope he won't die before Spring! Ha ha ha ha ha! Stop that cackles! Hurry woman! Must I waste the whole day? Hey hey hey! He's a beautiful child! He's a beautiful child! Hey hey hey! You won't believe she laughed! And say he's a beautiful child! She said those words ""a beautiful child""! Well she said no more than the truths! And I saw not one slave in all that house with a new coat like mine! And why should you go about like a wife of a common fellow? I can afford a piece of cloth I think! Now I have 2 fields! I bought it today from the Great House! - The land? - They said it was less than an inch. And took all that silver as if it were nothing! And the foolish clerks who don't own a foot land laughed the goose clack at me 'cause I couldn't write my name! But I'll buy again and again! Until my land is more than an inch! Even in a house of a prince! Look here farmer! Someday all this will belong to you! And you'll be a prince too! And I'll buy more land and more land and... What a pity! We're so poor! We have nothing! And the child is nothing! Yes yes! Is less than nothing! And it's only a female, and it's covered with small pox as well! Yes yes! Only a female, and covered with small pox, as well! You mighty gods! You wise gods! You've been good to me, for many years you've been good to this humble person; I had only 1 field, now I have 5! I had only 1 child, now I have 3! My eldest son planted his first rice today! My youngest son is big enough to lead the ox! My third child is only a female, but I won't reproach you for that! Excuse me! Now we haven't forgotten you! We brought you fine new rogues of red paper so you won't forget me! You send me rich harvest this year also and you persuade my uncle, to work a little now and then. And not ask for money so often And if he does, please allow my husband to refuse him! I'll do that anyway! Very gracefully! Wong Loong! Come up! Wong Loong come up here! Wong Loong! Wong Loong will know, he'll know what it is! Wong Loong! How would he know? He is as slow witted as my woman! Hey hey! Well! And what now? Look! Look! An army! No! Virgins perhaps? So many? People from the North! But why? There must be famine in the North! They're going south where there's food! Famine!? Ha ha ha! What ideas you have! The woman is right! I have seen it before! That's what happens when a man has only 1 field! But I have 5! We must thank the gods for giving me so much foresight! What talk is this!? Forgive him! My son he's young and stupid and talks too much! It was famine that made me a slave! It dries even if we carry it! Well if the vines starve, we'll all starve! The wheats' gone! And the rice! The more my fields I have only this handful of beans! Mother! Mother! You know we're not thieves! But the ox is mine! We're hungry! Our children are hungry! You should help us! If I have money I would help you! My nephew! You can sell your land! Sell my land? Yes! But then the money is gone, and the land! At least we could live well through the famine! What good is this land now? You're young, you don't know what a famine is like! My father knew years of famine, but he kept the land. I must keep it for my sons! The earth is good, if we work it would feed us. But how am I to live? How am I to live? Work! As I do! I'll not rob my sons to feed you! You, you! Must we go hungry while you have land? This land that you won't sell! I'm not selling my land. It's my life, it's mine! I'll never sell it, I'll dig up the earth first and feed it to my children! Yes! And you'll bury them in it! He's my friend. My friend! We're not hungry! Mercy on me you powerful ones! I starve and my woman starve, and there's no one to give me a handful of rice! There's one who has plenty, but he's a rich man! And rich's hardened the heart, soften his heart o powerful ones, that he may give me a little out of his abundance! Would not a man sell his lands unless he has foods to give his children? He has food! And I starve! He has food! And these good men starve! Well, what? You have food! We're starving! You have food! Food! I have nothing! I dig for roots, for my children. You have food hidden! Food and silver! Food? Find it! He's got it he's got it! Wong Loong has food! I told you, he has food! But... it's earth! It takes hunger, and it's warm. Ching! Hunger makes man mad! Come come! You're little man now! You won't cry! Look! Your sister doesn't cry! Little one she never cries now What is it? Why? If you could have a little food you'd have the strength to bring the child I'll find it. Tomorrow I... When have you had food? There's a thing in me that hurts, and not hunger, that a man has no words. No words, but I know! Oh Lang, the earth has forgotten us! The earth... I hate it! I'll sell it! No! For a constant length! No! No not the land! Not the land! We're ready nephew. Are you safe? Yes... safe. Huh! Another mouth to feed. My poor man! For the sake of your children, we'll give you a better price for your land than you can get anywhere else in these times. We'll give you 12 pieces of silver. What? 12 pieces? For all my land? Huh! I... I paid a 100 times that much! But who was starving then? Please! Please! And well you know I must sell. No! Not the land! We'll not sell the land. We'll keep it, we'll go south. And when we return we'll still have the land. But I've arranged it! I brought these men here, you must sell! Is it your land? Did you buy it bit by bit? The land is our life and it's better to go south, or die walking, than to give it to you, for nothing! What a pity! What a pity! How can you walk anywhere? With the child? The child is dead! Dead? But I heard it cry? The child is dead! What do you say father, shall we ride in this fire wagon? It ain't safe for your old back. He said it crawls on these iron poles! Grandpa says it's a god of fire! These wagons chained together. Do it again find a thing? We sit in it while it walks off! With these mats we can build a home. Well then get to work! Get to work all of you! You'll look at me and listen! Take the bowel in your right hand so and hold it out to everybody that passes and cry out to them: !A heart good sir! A heart good lady! A good deed and you shall prosper! The small cash, a coin you throw away! Feed us starving child!"" Have a kind heart! A good deed that bring you fortune! The small cash the coin you throw away give for the child died! Have a kind heard! A good deed to bring you fortune! The small cash feed the starving child! Feed the good fortune! Bring you a good heart! Small cash for starving! Poor little child! Feed the good fortune! Bring you a good heart! Small cash for starving! Hey hey! Have a kind heart good sir! A good... Well? - And today? - Nothing! No work of any kind! For things a beast should do, there were a 100 men, fighting! It would have been better to starve, in our own land, than to come to this great city, where there's no work for a man's hands! It will come! Now then must I wait for my meat any longer? Meat? Hey hey hey! It's the first we've had since we killed the ox! You must have begged from a prince today! It's mine! Where did you get meat? I took it from an old woman! You stole it? You thief! Thief! Thief! Meat is meat. Do we have to steal or beg for it to live? A man can't stand it here! Our land is all in the north! In times like this, my parents found a way to go back; they sold me to the old mistress in the big house. You could sell little one? I would sell her, to take you back to the land. If it wasn't for me, you would die before you'll sell her! We won't sell her, not if I spend my life in this wilderness. What is it? What happened? He was pulling timber, he fell and died! Where did he work? Where did he work? At the great market! Where are these soldiers going? They say there's a revolution coming! Revolution? What is a revolution? I don't know, but it has something to do with food! Things are growing again. You were a farmer? I own land in the north! So did I! 10 years ago! Why don't you go back? You gotta have an ox! You gotta buy seeds! You gotta live, till you make the crop. I tried saving up for 10 years, I'll never get back, and neither will you! I'll get back! If I can pull that thing I can pull a plough; ox or no ox! Listen my brothers! Before the peasants close my mouth! In a few days China will be a free country; the day of tyranny is over! The revolutionary army is on its way; they've been marching 30 miles a day! Fighting in the rain in the north Hey! You hear him? Yes! But what does it all mean? It's raining in the north! Everyday in the south as come to revolution! All of China will soon be free! Don't let them drag you from your homes; that famine has driven you off course! Soldiers! Soldiers! Run! Soldiers! What is it? What is it? Why you shouting? It's free! The revolution's here! China's a republic! Republic? What is a ""republic""? Hey what do they want? - Where are they going? - Into the great house of Lang! It's all over the city, a man can do what he like! Aim! Fire! No! No! I was hungry! Mercy! No! I was hungry! Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! Aim! Fire! Captain! Prepare to march! Follow in! Let them be a warning to you! Free publicans are not bandits! Order must be maintained throughout the city! You may go, but remember anyone caught looting will be shot! What haven't I seen? What have I not seen! I could never tell you! Such things! Crowds! Oh I got through! The city is mad! They're robbing the rich! Killing'em and burning'em! The soldiers have come down from the north! Huh! It's well you were here, it's well you were here! Look! We can go back, we can go back to the land! Home! We are home! - Home! - Home! Come! Hey! Down with you! Run to uncles home, tell'em Wong is home! Tell all our friends, tell'em I have great hungs! Away with you! Ha ha ha ha! This is yours! Thank you! Take what you need! Please! Take it all! The sack! All! Thank you! All! There's food for all until the harvest! We'll have more crops! Thank you! Bye! If you need more, come back! We have plenty! - Ching! - Wong Loong! I see no face in the city like yours, my friend! These belong to you; I kept'em in our house. Kept them? But it was starving! Why don't you sell them? I have no ploughs to... But keep it! Tomorrow I'll bring my ox and'em, to help plough your field! I have no field, I had to sell it! Sell them? Well you can come and work for me! I've had luck in itself, I have the mind to buy more land! Will you come? I'll come gladly. Nephew! Brother! My loved ones! I predicted it! I predicted it! I always said if those southeners had anything, my nephew would bring it home with him But it's too late to help me, I've had to sell my daughters Well uncle, anything you want and I have... Nothing, nothing. Still, if you could let me have a few pieces of silver, 2 or 3, say 4? 4? Why? Take 10! Why not? I have this and more! I have jewels! Jewels! A handful! All colours! Red ones white ones, come! I want to feel my toes in the earth again! - But there's something... - Well? Are you going to sell the jewels? To buy the land? Sell them? Why of course! And what else would I do with them? If I could have 2, only 2 small ones, 2 white ones... The pearls? You? I wouldn't wear them, I'm much too plain-looking. Oh I've never noticed it. But I could hold them in my hands, sometimes. Thank you! It's nothing! Nothing! After all you, helped to find them. And you must wear them, yes, and you must dress in a way becoming to them, not as a poor farmer's wife! We'll see to that! We'll look after you! We'll come and live with you! We'll rebuild the house! No this house is enough! But no we must make it bigger! We must have rooms for a household! No no we were happy here! We'll be happier! We'll have men in the fields, slave in the house. No slaves! Nothing! But you must have a slave until you're well again. I'm well now, see! It's cured me; coming home. But you shall rest and have everything! We'll live well and in comfort, We'll be safe from hunger as long as we live Longer! Longer! My nephew you're rich! You can live like a great lord! Why you can even pick a second wife! Listen to him! Listen to him! But why not? You have 2 oxens? No! No but come along! It is further agreed that the above named seller, Wong Lung, shall deliver to the respected merchant, Liu Fong Kee, the set wheat as and when same harvested Cost of transportation to be born by the seller. It is agreed between the above mentioned parties, that the price of this wheat is to be as follows: ""For each bushel of wheat, 4 pieces of silver In the event of damage to the crop, from storm, pest or other cause, the worthy purchaser, Liu Fong Kee, shall be held free of any liabilities to accept this wheat"" Read that last paragraph. Mr Wong, I'm delighted to pay you such a high price for your wheat, even though my profit might be slight. Very kind of you to buy my rigid grain. The contract's ready father. Well it is time. But this contract is wrong! This is the radical for wood, it should be the radical for water. Change it then. We'll not put our names to anything wrongly written! Mr Wong, 2 clever sons like these, are the better half of your wealth! They're stupid worthless preachers, If anything was driven to their big bright skulls it was by beating them! I told that teacher to beat them! He beat them so well, that this one's going to the university. - Indeed! - If I'm not too unworthy. I hope to win a degree in agriculture! A degree!? Agriculture!? That's somekind of paper that will make it rain just enough. But not too much! And you? You going too? No sir! I'll stay on my father's land, when my brother returns he'll show me what more can be done with it than we have done! Now then that's talk enough, take the money home. My ignorant daughter! A beautiful girl! Oh she has a wretched appearance! Now you two might mix your blood in one bowl! Oh but your daughter is much too good for my son. Oh no! But you would never come decend to such a marriage! Oh but I couldn't presume to look so high! It's impossible! Quite impossible! But, it might done. Yes indeed, if you'll be good enough to consider it in due time. I should think of it night and day, good bye! It would be modest of me to say that this idea was mine. Good bye! Ah! What a beautiful day! That music! It seems to draw me inspite of myself! - I'm not used to these places. - Eh? I have no clothes! I'm only a farmer! I have work to do... Work? Work! You must learn to enjoy yourself! There's more in the world than earth and crops, there're songs and dancing! And girls who do these things elegantly! Watch! That must be the stairway! Yes. - Shall we see what it feels like? - No no no! No, I... I've never been off the ground all my life! She's like a dream person! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Quiet! I told the thing not to wake me till this time. Another feast? The dragon feast, woman! It's my duty to observe the old customs My nephew insisted on it. Old customs indeed! There's more than that with your nephew! When the farmer buys silk, robes and washes his whole body everyday, there's a woman that should work! But the rich man may have 2 wives! But the wife must cling to her husband, that is as it should be That's right! A woman of love and one is mistake! Of course! Now then, it is said you may see a tea pot with 4 tea cups, but did you ever see a tea cup with 4 tea pots!? It is also said, do you ever see 2 spoons in the same bowl that do not nod against each other!? Well What is it? What is it? Excuse me father, but you look like the lord of the Great House. Well! And that is not as strange as you think! I just... tell your mother I wish to see her. Yes father. Can you spare me a moment? I must know what seed to prepare for the Summer planting. Why trouble me about it? Prepare the seed my son gives you! These flowers are dead, Little One! Your sister knows only happiness. Mother! Is it a letter from your brother? No mother! Father wishes to see you. Forgot how chilly it was! Are you well? Your pain, is it bad? No it's nothing! You sent for me? Well, there's a thing I've done, I bought the Great House! The house of Loo! Courts and land! I'm the new lord there. Well? Have you no thanks? I thought it would please you to be mistress in that house, where you lived as a slave. Our sons were born here... They must have wives! We'll have grandchildren, there's room in that house to all! You'll have a high place with money to spend for slaves. You must make yourself becoming to it! Look at your hair! Your clothes! You disgrace me! One would think you're still the wife of a common labourer! Wear the pearl you have. The pearls? I have them! You would never wear them. Why... I look at them sometimes. I need them, give them to me. I know that I'm ugly, and not to be loved. All that we have now came from you. That is the truth and I say it. But, but now... But now? There's a woman, not such a one as you; not as good as you, it's like a sickness! When I'm with her, it's not enough! When I'm not with her, there's nothing! Even the land is nothing! Then it will be better when she's in your house. You'll say that? Is it your wish? Yes. Let it be then! Ou lang, what is there more to say? Nothing. Who is it? Who is that man going out the gate? He look something like my son, Lung! Now then what? I'm Ching the farmer. Well, Ching the farmer what? I have business with Wong the farmer. Wong the farmer? This is the great house of Wong! He's the lord here! There's a bad woman in the house! There's a bad woman in the house! Bad woman! Father, hush! It's his second wife. I say it's a bad woman! I had but one woman... and my father had but one woman, and we farm the land! Come father, it's he and his second wife! I'm tired, I want my tea. The old man is childish, nobody listens to him, but he shall be kept away! I'm hated in this house, how can I be happy here? But... what can I do? I have to sit here, shut in all day, if I stood out there they whisper and look at me hatefully! Where can I walk in the evening? If I had the garden, if I had the garden all mine; with singing birds in the pavillion, the fountain too, with fish. But the money... - Then it's money that you love. - No no! Little Flower! But it will not be easy until the harvest. I must see, I must see, my younger son keeps the accounts. But these're few little things. If you love me, if I please you. It shall be done! Anything! Anything! Be careful! My pearls! I may come in? Does my music disturb you? Oh no! No I like it! I listen sometimes. I play it because I'm lonely. I have so much to talk and laugh, but there's no one. I'm sorry, I'm very sorry! You must excuse me, I... I have some business with the grain merchants. - If you'll please I must go! - Then you'll pass by the shops? Yes? Would you mind giving him these for a bottle? With silver? Why... Yes! Yes! But you won't misunderstand. Why should I? When a woman gives her slipper to a man? But I shouldn't tell you. Oh no please! Well then... it means he's taking her fancy. But you ask me to have it guilded? But the bottle doesn't need guilding, it's pure silver! Here's a letter from your brother, will you read it to me? Of course mother! Now then, we'll hear what our scholar has to say ""First, I am ashamed of my ignorance. But I am not ashamed to inquire of my teachers. Each day I learn new ways of bring about nature's facts in case nature herself should fail us"". What does he say? He says he's learning many things to help us. But is he happy there? Does he say he need anything? No mother. ""I miss my beloved father and mother deeply. And I'm eager to share the happiness of our new home"". Mother, I want to go away too! Go away? To the wars! I'll be a soldier! Now then what madness is this? Well I've heard stories of war and plunder and battle, and I hate this house! And I'll go! I wish she'll stop that music! Now this house is full of silences. I was reading mother a letter from the older brother. - Would you like to hear it? - If he's well it can wait! But there's more in your face than the letter! He'll be a soldier. A soldier! Now then, men don't take good iron to make an ail, nor a good man to make a soldier. It would be a disgrace to me a man of serving land to have a son who's a soldier! But I'm nothing in this house! If you're lost in this house go back to the land! Help Ching until the harvest. Put an alert on yourself! That's good for any man! Well if the land isn't fit for you anymore it isn't fit for me! Now all these stuffes I don't know. He's come to the age of tempers and weeping. When I was a lad I had no such tempers! You worked on the land; but he's like a young lord! And he's been alone here. And you worry his age to have a bride But I was given a sla... My marriage cost my father nothing! The boy's our son! He would be better dead than here with this woman! What? You're dreaming! Even she hears it who has nothing else; it feels all this house, that woman cause and she's bored and your son is young... Enough! Gossip! Kitchen gossip! That's where you came from! Where you wished to live, live there then! Eat 'n sleep we will, but between you and me there's nothing! Nothing! The man is loon here. What are you doing in the house? There's work to be done in the fields. But, what is it? You're weeping, and you must do it and man can be sorry, But why do you weep? There's food for everyday. And fire! Sometimes a man gets a longing for his fields. Well, if it pleases you to come up again and working them, they're yours! No it's better for my son to come; in the house he pulls against the yolk. He has all the freedom here he wants! Where is he today? He comes and goes! Sometimes one day, sometimes two. I thought you knew. I knew nothing! I spend my time in town! Why don't you tell me you slow witted ox! Why should I tell you what everyone's been saying? For weeks! What? Well... Well speak! If you have eyes and ears you'll know. Know? Know what? That the second wife and your son is... Liar! Get off my land. Well... it's been a long time with us. Take what belongs to you and go. I came to you with nothing, I'll go with nothing. Good day master! Good day! - Ah! - Father! Get out! Out of my sight! Good bye mother. Mother! Mother, you're ill, you should have a doctor. It's nothing. Where you go you ought to tell me. They say there's a war in the north. Sometimes in wars there are those who die. Well if that's best, let it be! When I'm gone, you must see to the harvest we almost did it already, the clerk will tell you how much. I will see to it. If you must go, there's a thing to be done. Speak to your father. - No, no, I can't! - You're his youngest son. Father. Father? I... I am going away. I... I only want to tell you that I... how I... if you could forgive me... But go! Nephew! We're ruined! Everything's gone! And I predicted it! I predicted it! What's happened? I knew it, I ran miles to tell you. - What is it? - I forgive everybody. - What is it? - This! - Locusts! - The flying plague! Well! Let them come! But the lion, the harvest! What can we do against the gods? It's not the gods! It's a thing of nature! We can fight it! - Have you ever seen a plague of locusts? - No but... I have! They come in millions. The air is black with them and stinky. And where they come down there's nothing left! Not a green of wheat! Not a blade of grass! Not a leave nor flower! Nothing! And can you fight that with your book? Forgive me! I mean no disrespect for my elders, but I speak for what I heard at school! And I heard this: ""That a man is a slave to the earth, or its master and when it turns against him, he must fight it!"" We can fight these creeping things! If we save but one field, it would a new thing in all this land, and the best in a thousand years! This thing can be done? Show us how to do it! If it'd please you, come on to the fields! Now look! The locusts will come down here, the wind blows between these hills. There! Like a whirlpool, if it blows the locusts they'll come down there and no other place! I saw it! As a boy! They came down there! And they were gone, with a change of wind But the crops, were gone with them! But that's the thing! We can hold them off till the wind changes! We must take a fire break along these hill tops. Make a wall of fire! But my wheat lights on fire in a fire wall! And mine! And mine! And mine! I'll pay for what is eaten and what is burnt! We'll get kerosene, bring it in carts! The fire stuff, it makes a quick, high flame. We can fight everything behind this wall! If they break through, we'll wind the ditch behind the fire; a wall of water! It will fail! If it fails, we'll fight them with torches! With noise! With our hands! If we can hold them off until the wind picks them up again, we can save at least those fields! - It can't be done! - It must be done! All you have and all I have depends on it! You think I'm rich? But if I lose this harvest there's nothing! If I save anything I'll share it! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Let the men dig and women, let the old men and boys make torches, gather all things that'll make a noise! Bring the fire stuff! Get the oxens and ploughs, sickels, spades! - Everyone! Hurry! Hurry! - Useless! Useless! I'll stay where it's safe! Faster! Faster! Make that thing wider! Up here! Hurry! Hurry! Bring the fire stuff! Come on men, hurry! Torches. Millions! Millions! My god! See! They land in one place! Yes, they fall! Hey! Hurry with the fire stuff! Load the fire stuff from here! Get them! Get the torches! Get the torches! Light the fires! All fire stop! They are smothering the plains! It's breaking through, just as I predicted it! Just as I predicted it! - Bring the water! Fill the ditches! - Fill the ditches! They'll be eaten, there's no doubt about it now! No doubt about it! That ditch will never hold them! We must fight them with our hands! Ourselves! Anything! Move! Chen! Keep fighting! Don't give up! We must keep fighting! Everyone! We can! There's the wheat! Save it! The wind! The wind! The wind! The wind! We beat them! We beat them! We beat them! Yeah! We beat them! The farm! Victory! Victory! We've done it! The young master, it's wonderful! He did it! The son and his father, the son to be proud of! The father to be proud of! The wise man in 3 generations! But it's nothing! Just a matter of oil and fire, something we learn from books! But I'm worn out! Worn out! But we saved the crops! The harvest is saved! The gods are good! What's the matter? I'll call your husband. No, no! Say nothing. He's on the land again, with his sons, and this day's his, and it must be! You shall bring in the harvest, and lead the workers! Both of you! And Ching is my steward! Well! There's work to be done! Yeah yeah yeah! The harvest! Food! Food again! And another thing must be done, and you must do it, quickly! I? Work? Go to the banker, as a commisioner to be had, and if you rob me a little, it will be yours! For old time's sake! I will sell the Great House! Sell? But why? The harvest is saved, you'll have money! You can live like a lord! All that is finished! I will sell the Great House! It's a wedding again! But who? It's your grandson's wedding! And soon there'll be great grandsons! Many of them! Many of them! Please! Please! Let him be! Let him be! His cheek is as red as this excellent wine! Excellent indeed! My stomach is very pleased! Perhaps it's the lost of memory, but I've never eaten such rice! It's very bad rice. The worst I've ever bought! Grandchildren! Great grandchildren! Have all the guests had rice? Yes, yes! Is the sweet rice is hot, with lard and sugar? And the 8 fruits? It's just as you wished. Mistrss! Your son's bride! Well, and she's beautiful! My daughter, look to your husband, and your husband's father, and his granfather, and you'll have no duty... to any of them. You must rest! Everyone be here not smiling because of me. Let them be, for the bride! In good time! In good time! For you'll be well again. Well... This thing is waiting. You can't speak of that, and please me. I'm content, and what must be done, you've done! Bridegroom hasn't heard a word! He's wishing we go home! No! No indeed, I should be honoured if you stay the whole evening! Do you remember? Yes! If a man could speak, there're things... Some are forgotten. But now I know that you're the one, that the best a man can have. Ou Lang! Ou Lang! This I cannot bear! I'd sell all my land if I could heal you! No! I would not let you! For I must die, sometime. But the land will be there, after me. I beg you! Stay here with me! I can not! Forgive me! Ou Lang... you are the earth! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Twelve-year-old boy driving an automobile. l think your father's as much to blame as you. Father don't know about it. -You said you had permission. -l did. l got permission from Eddie Cooper. -lt's his car. -His car? You mean it was his car. Now it's a pile of junk. And a law-abiding farmer's tractor is damaged to the extent of $30. So, Mr. James MacMahon, Jr... ...this court sentences you to 90 days. Ninety days, Mr. Watkins, of working for you after school. Weeding turnips or sawing wood or any other form of labor to make up your loss. Jimmy, you tell your father about this mess. Dad? He'd just about skin me alive. l vaguely suspected something of that sort. This court will recess for 30 minutes while l try a case in chambers. Am l late, judge? l came the minute l got your call. That's quite all right, Mary. Quite all right. Sit down. Now.... The way this thing looks to me... ...it appears that you... ...Mrs. Harry Tompkins, purchased an expensive radio on an installment plan. lt appears, Mary, that you're three months in arrears in the payments. l thought l could pay from the household money. The store wants to attach your husband's salary. You just can't let them take Harry's salary. He'd never forgive me. Besides, Mary, employers, they don't like that sort of thing. That's why l called you. Now, Mr. Barnes, l shall delay issuing a warrant in this case for 30 days. ln the meantime, this court will guarantee full payment. That suits me fine, judge. We don't like this sort of thing, but it's business. -l know. l know. -Good day, judge. -Good day, Mr. Barnes. -Good day, Mrs. Tompkins. Even with 30 days more, l don't see how-- Your husband's always bragging around at lodge meeting... ...what a miracle of a cook you've got. Augusta? She's the best cook ever, if l know anything about cooking... -...and l was raised in my mother's kitchen. -Splendid, splendid. Now, when you get home... ...tell Harry to give you the wages he used to pay the cook... ...and you cook from now on. Thatll give you the money you need for the payments. Judge Hardy, do you think it's fair that Augusta loses her job... -...just because l've been foolish? -Mary, for a long time... ...l've been trying to get up the courage to tell Mrs. Hardy we should have a cook. For 30 years she's cooked with her own hands every meal l've eaten. She's gonna be furious. But l'm putting my foot down. -Send your cook to my house tomorrow. -l'll never be able to thank you. And on your way home, drop in on Mrs. Hardy and just mention crabapple jam. She's preserving. lf Harry likes them, tell him you know where he can get lots more. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Mary. -Goodbye, Miss Forrest. -Goodbye, Mary. l can't help it, Milly. l'm glad to give the stuff away. All the pleasure's gone from putting up preserves. Guess l'm getting old. Emily, why don't you get a girl to help you in the kitchen? Why, l'd never dare suggest it to James. He wouldn't touch a mouthful of food unless l cooked it myself. l thought it was unusually quiet around here. Andy's usually home by this time. Wonder where he can be? There's $ 1 2. l'll sign a promissory note for the other 8. Of course, you know, you can't have the car till you pay the full $20. -Nobody pays cash nowadays. -Then bring me that promissory note... ...signed by your father. Why, l can't make Dad sign a note, because-- Because he don't know you figure on buying this car. Sure he does. That is, he hasn't had time for me to let him know about it. -All right. No $8, no automobile. -Oh, look, please. l'll get the money to you somehow. But in the meantime, can't l come down and do a little work on it? Certainly. ln a way, it's your car. Thanks, Mr. Dugan. l'll have the money by the 23rd. Because l need the car on the 24th. Or l'll be a social outcast. -Hi, Polly! -Hi! -Hi there! -Hello. You're two hours late. l'm sorry, Polly. l have bad news for you. l can't go to the country club dance on Christmas Eve. You can't go? You've got to. You don't know the sacrifices l'm making. lt's impossible. We're going to my grandmother's tomorrow for the holidays. A whole year to visit her and you pick Christmas. Can't be helped. And me with a new evening dress. lt's got a low neck and practically no sleeves. -Yeah? -lt would have been fun... ...going to the dance with you. At the club, there's a lot of little places where you can sneak out between dances. Really, l think we're getting much too old for that sort of thing, hugging and kissing. l ain't ever too old for hugging and kissing. You didn't act no 90 years old last night on the porch yourself. Why, Andrew Hardy! You kissed me last night by force. Well, it's good that way too. Polly, let's get dressed and walk home the long way through the trees. Andy. You'll take some other girl to the dance, l suppose. No, l won't. There's no other girl l'd ask. l'm going stag. That's sweet of you, Andy. Sit down, Polly? Polly, when l say goodbye to you tomorrow... -...will you wear your new evening dress? -ln the daytime? -That's ridiculous, Andy. -Oh, please, Polly? The one l'm not gonna see at the dance. With the low neck and practically no sleeves. l certainly will not. lt might get mussed. You mean l'm gonna get to kiss you tomorrow? Well, l will be gone for three weeks. Oh, boy, oh, boy. But just supposing, Polly. Suppose that l'm about to leave and... ...l'm about to kiss you, one of the girls walk in. And why do we have to be supposing that? Well, what l mean is, suppose l kiss you now. We won't have to worry about anyone walking in. l thought so. All your fine talk about... ...taking the long walk home because of scenery. You're gonna be gone and l'm gonna be all alone. Doesn't a man resist temptation better... ...if his own girl kisses him goodbye? Why do you want me to wear my new dress? l'll bring a camera, take your picture and keep it with me at the dance. Oh, you're a darling. Tomorrow, Andy. Don't forget your camera. -Hello, Andy. -Oh, hello, Dad. Just thinking. A wonderful age we live in. They didn't have airplanes when you were a boy, did they? No, l was quite grown when men began to fly. They didn't even have automobiles, did they? No. When you were young, everybody rode horses. That's so. -Did you have your own horse? -Yes, indeed, l did. That's fine. Now, today, everybody rides in automobiles. No. No, not everybody. Maybe not everybody. Maybe not children. But look, Dad, l'm not a child anymore. A fella's just gotta have a car. -Does he? -Yes, sir. l casually discussed the used car business with Mr. Peter Dugan, and he-- He agrees that every young man should have a car. Yes, sir. There's a peach of a job down there for 20 bucks. -''Dollars.'' -Dollars. l thought if you might help-- Now, Andy, we've been over this before. On occasion, in emergencies, you've driven the sedan. You drive very well, though goodness knows where you learned. When you're 1 6 years old, l'll allow you to take the car out. One night a week. That way l'll have some control over the situation. Gee, Dad, other fellas have cars. Don't l have as much sense as the other kids? l think you've got a lot more. But l've got to decide this. When you can pay cash for a car out of your own money... -...that's something else. -Do you believe in the partial payment plan? No, no. Not unless you have an assured income of your own. -Come on home. Dinner's ready. -l'm gonna buy some film. Polly wants me to take her picture. You know how girls are. ''Emily, times have changed. Today, no woman should be tied to her kitchen....'' Excuse me. Could you tell me where number 27 is, please? -Right next door. -ls it the Draper house? Right you are, young lady. -l don't know if anyone's home. -They'll be home. They're expecting me. Mr. and Mrs. Draper are my grandparents. Well, well, well. You're Betsy Booth, Martha Draper's baby. l've come for Christmas. Mother's doing a musical comedy in Chicago. l'm gonna be on the stage too when l grow up. l'm studying for it. l hope you're a bigger success than your mother. So we're gonna be neighbors, eh? l'm Judge Hardy. ls Andy Hardy your son? l have heard something to that effect. Grandma always writes about him. Oh, he's so polite, and he always runs her errands for her. She says he's the nicest boy in the neighborhood. Christmas with Andy Hardy next door! -l hope you won't be disappointed. -Oh, l won't. -Well, goodbye, Judge Hardy. For now. -Goodbye. Don't forget, we're neighbors. Here, here, here. What's all the--? Oh, Dad. lt can't be that bad, Marian. Nothing's that bad. l'm just so mad, l-- Weren't you having dinner with Wayne? Dinner? l never want to see him again. Let's us go in here, huh? Now, tell me. What's the matter? Dad, l'm through with Wayne. l never want to see him again as long as l live. Never. You mean never until he calls to apologize. No, Dad. Never. Dad, he's-- Wayne went out with another girl. That horrible Maxine Fort. Well, honey. Half a woman's love is faith. l'm through with Wayne. l'm through with all men. l'm never going to marry as long as l live. Never. Well, that's rather a large order, honey. Maybe l'll do social service work. That's it. l'll be a settlement worker. And very commendable too. But you want to remember, honey, there's no new sorrow in the world... ...nor a trouble that a lot of other people couldn't match. ''Emily. Ever since you were a young bride, cooking in your first kitchen--'' -Hello, Mother. -Hello, dear. l didn't hear you come in. Mother, l want to talk to you. James, you're in trouble. Can't l just talk to you without it being anything special? Well, what is it? Mother, the day of the pioneer and the covered wagon is unfortunately over. You're not going camping at your age. No, no, no. Of course not. l mean, times have changed. Once we did all our own work. Once we used horses, now we have cars. -lf you've bought another automobile-- -No, no. Certainly not. l mean, horses were all right in their way, but cars are better. Same with housework. Now we have different stoves-- -lt nearly burned. -But-- lt's all right, dear. l'm listening. You were talking about horses. -l wasn't talking about horses. -You just said that-- l'm talking about cooks! -l'll go. -No, let Milly answer it. She's probably getting fixed up for dinner. l'll go. Good evening. Telegram for you, Mrs. Hardy. -For me? -Yes, ma'am. -Will you please sign here? -Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. l'll sign for it, sonny. There you are, boy. Here you are. -What are you afraid of? -But a telegram, James. When we were young telegrams were new, expensive and exciting. -Today they're as ordinary as postal cards. -l don't know, James. Mother, you're the same sweet girl l married. You haven't changed a bit. But times have. Telegram's here to stay. You may as well get used to it. Oh, dear. What is it? Mother had a stroke this morning. She's still in a coma. -James, l'll have to go to her. -Now, Mother, you just relax. l know it's a shock, but.... Now, now, now, Mother. Here. You just sit down a minute. Can't be as bad as you think. Never is. That's right, have a good cry. Make you feel better. Then you must go right upstairs and rest. But Milly, our mother.... James, l have to go to her. l'm the oldest, you know. There's a train out tonight. -Andy will get you a timetable. -l can't leave you. l'm a big boy. l can take care of myself. -Milly will go with you. -Thanks, James. -She'll want to be there. -l'll put some of our things together, Emily. James, l can't leave you and the children alone. Who will take care of the house and fix your meals? Well, Emily, Providence sometimes moves in a strange way. l hired a cook this afternoon. Oh, James, l've wanted to ask for one for the past five years. Yes, so did l. l was afraid you'd think l didn't like your cooking. Best cook in the whole world. Aunt Milly just told us, Mother. What can l do to help? Here's your chance. You can start your settlement work right here in the family. We're used to having a woman look after us. Don't worry, Grandma Forrest will be all right. And l'll take such good care of Dad. As for Andy, if he once steps out of line, l'll-- Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Social service isn't dictatorship. l hear what you're saying. You won't ride any high horse while Mom is away. Now, children, children. -l'm sorry, Mom. -l'm sorry too, Mother. l promise to treat Andrew with the consideration that you do. l don't like the smell of that. l'll let it pass. Mom, l won't be any trouble to Marian or Dad. l'll keep my room clean. l'll wash before meals. l won't be any trouble to anyone in the world. The age of miracle has not passed. -Find a timetable upstairs. -l'll get it! Oh, no, you won't! Dad told me to get it. Everything's under control, Mom. lnstant service. Timetable as good as here. Andy! That's all right. Everything's under control. Everything's under control. Hey, Marian. Ain't grub ready yet? You'd let a guy starve to death. lf you thought to help while Mother's away... ...you'd be up at 7:30 this morning, as l was. Sorry, l'm starving. Ain't grub ready? -''lsn't.'' And if you mean breakfast-- -Excuse me. Would you inform me whether l can partake in my morning nourishment? -Come in and find out. -Such talk! Good morning, Dad. Good morning, son. Sleep well? Perfect, perfect, perfect. -ls it that bad, Dad? -No, no, no. Not at all. That's excellent coffee. -Just scalding hot. -Oh, l'm glad. l know how fussy you are about your coffee. lf she made good coffee, she must have got it out of a cookbook. She calls that coffee? Tastes like she put mucilage in it. -lt's the worst l've ever tasted! -Take it easy, Andy. She did the best she could. We don't want to hurt her feelings. Leave it to me, Dad. Marian, this is the best coffee l've ever tasted. Honestly, Andy? That's sweet of you. -l'll get another cup. -Never mind. Don't bother. -Oh, it's no bother. -One cup is sufficient for a growing boy. All right. You saved my life. lf there's anything l can ever do, say the word. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you. There is something you could do for me. -Just name it. A favor's a favor. -The car's about due for a washing. Yes, sir. That just about makes us even, all right. Mother left a note for you to take some preserves over to the Drapers. -Don't forget. -Oh, yes. They have a visitor. A new playmate for you. Playmate? What do you think l do with my spare time, dress dolls or something? Excuse me, Andrew. A companion. -Their granddaughter from New York. -A new girl? -Yes. -How old is she? Oh, l think about 1 2 or 1 3. Just a child. l realized something. l'm older than my years. -Must have been Washington that done it. -''Did'' it. -Did it. -Nevertheless... ...you'll have to humiliate yourself and deliver the preserves. l understand the little girl next door sings. Twelve years old and sings? l'll go, Grandma. How do you do? Good morning. l'm Betsy Booth. Won't you come in? My mother just sent these over to your grandmother. -You're Andy Hardy, aren't you? -l live right next door. l.... -l sing, you know. -l know. l heard you. Oh, that wasn't singing. That was only practicing. Well, go and practice. Don't let me bother-- Oh, it's no bother. l love to.... l mean, l'd love to sing for you. Some other time. You just keep on practicing. Music isn't the most important thing to me. -l play tennis. And l swim. -Swell. Well, look, l gotta be going. l gotta do something for my dad. Wash the car. l mean, tune it up. Wash the carburetor and the spark plugs. l might even look at the motor. l bet after you work on it it'll pass every car on the road. Well, l wouldn't be a bit surprised. Well, l gotta be running. Well, maybe-- Could l help you? No. lt's a special job. My father won't even do it. l'll see you later. Goodbye. l'll never be able to get a man, much less hold him. No glamour. No glamour at all. Betsy, who was that? Some of Mrs. Hardy's preserves for you, Granny. No glamour. That's my trouble. -Hi, Andy. -Oh, hi, Beezy. Say, l've gotta talk to you. Very private and confidential. Just when l was getting ready to go to work. Oh, well, come on. -Good morning. -Good morning. -l'm Augusta, the new cook. -Oh, of course. Come right in. -Hello there. -Hello. Say, did Andy go into the house? l saw him sneaking down the street with Beezy. And if the car isn't washed, he's going to catch it. We're far enough away. They couldn't hear us holler. -What's on your mind? -Andy... -...l'm in love. -Who is it this time? -Cynthia Potter. -That dizzy dame? -Say, listen-- -There's no accounting for taste. Go on. My folks are taking me away on a trip. Three weeks! l'm in the same boat. Polly left today. Andy, l don't suppose, as sort of a favor, you'd date her up? Keep the other guys away. Me? Go after your girl? Sure. When l get back, you drop her cold. -Then she's still my girl. -That's a terrible trick to play. -Andy, you've got to help me. -No, no, no, no. Look, if you do it, l'll pay you for it. Well, l suppose if you paid me it'd make it more respectable. -Just a straight business proposition. -Sure. You keep other guys from dating Cynthia until l get back... -...and l'll pay you four bits a week. -Four bits a week? Expose myself to a redheaded vampire for four bits a week? -Listen, l'll make it six bits. -Look at you. You're in love, and all she means to you is six bits? Beezy, you don't know what love is. Look, l'll go one dollar. That's as far as l'll go. lt's a pleasure taking out Cynthia. No, Beezy. A dollar's not enough. Well, how much do you want? l need-- l want 8 bucks and expenses. -Expenses? -Think l want to ruin her reputation... ...having everybody say l'm a cheapskate? You win. 8 bucks for the job and 50 cents a week for expenses. -Give me the 8 bucks. -l haven't got it right now. -Then the deal's off. -When Mom gives me Christmas money... -...l'll mail you the 8 bucks. -When? She'll give it to me a week before Christmas. Word of honor, l'll have it before the 23rd. -Word of honor. -lt's a deal. Leave it to me. l've got a system with women. After l give Cynthia the air, she'll be tickled even with you, Beezy. Hey, wait a minute. How do l know you'll go through with it? l know. Ask Cynthia to the Christmas Eve dance now. And if l know Cynthia, you'll have to go through with it. Say, that's not a bad idea. After all, a redhead's a redhead. l get into my tuxedo for a cotillion in Washington-- Washington? This little French girl sees l'm a very good dancer. She says, ''Pardonnez-moi.'' That's French for ''Excuse me.'' -She asked me to teach her the Big Apple. -That's marvelous. -Do you really like to dance? -l sure do. But that's with the right partner. l'll bet you could dance swell. Some girls like a fella to hold them tight. l bet you're different. Fella would be too afraid. Well, l am really delicate, but.... Well, it depends on who my partner is. Well, would you like me if l was your partner at the Christmas dance? Why, Andrew! You'll really take me to the Christmas Eve dance? l'd better go in. Mother will wonder why l'm out so long. Goodbye, Andrew, darling. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. Say, she's my girl. Don't forget that. You hired me, didn't you? -You didn't have to kiss her. -l didn't. She kissed me. That's it. You start your system and she kisses you. lt was a kiss of gratitude, like a dog licking your hand. Besides, l've gotta do my wooing my way. She's just 8 bucks and expenses to me. You might at least wipe my girl's lipstick off your face. Hello. Say, did you notice anything around here about washing this car? Yes, l had Mother's chauffeur do it. -Mother's what? -Mother's chauffeur. -l heard your sister say you'd catch it. -You've got a chauffeur? Mother has. The one that drives the town car. -Town car? Here? -Sure. lt brought me. -How do you think l got here? -How do l think she got here? What kind of a car? How many cylinders? -Two hundred. -Two hundred? -Listen, no car has 200 cylinders. -Hasn't it? No. Oh, then it's 200 horsepower and only 1 2 cylinders. Only 1 2 cylinders and 200 horsepower. Children that don't know what's what trusted with town cars. Betsy? Your name is Betsy, isn't it? Betsy, l'd like to repay the favor. l'd like to take you to the drugstore and buy you an ice cream soda. Will you, Andy? But it's kind of far, and it's liable to snow before we get there and dad's using our car. Mother's chauffeur can drive us down before he starts for Chicago. That's right. l never thought of that. Let's go! Yes, sir. Some boat, all right. The radiator cap alone would make you feel like you was a millionaire. Hello, folks. What'll it be? Chocolate soda with vanilla ice cream, please. -Make it two, buddy. -You bet. Something about ice cream sodas makes a fella feel... ...as though he's wasting time with meat and vegetables. Ain't it the truth? -Hello, Cynthia. -How do you do, Mr. Hardy? Hey, Cynthia, wait a minute. -Cynthia! -Pardon me, Mr. Hardy. l'm not in the habit of being practically knocked down by casual acquaintances. Casual acquaintances! What are you mad about? There are plenty of boys l could go around with. No, you can't go around with anybody but me. l don't even have to go to the dance with you. Oh, yes, you do. You promised. l wasn't crazy about Beezy... ...but at least he didn't go out with other girls. Oh, her? Oh, she's just a little kid visiting next door. Dad told me to be nice to her. lt won't happen again. l'll see you every day, every minute. l'll monopolize you. -This afternoon? -Whatll we do? Beezy could always think of something for us to do. We could go and watch basketball practice. l don't like basketball. -l used to like to roller skate. -l don't like to roller skate. l don't suppose you'd like to play a set of tennis. Why, l'd love to. Oh, l have the loveliest new sports outfit. Well, you be at my house at 2:00. -Excuse me for running away, Betsy. -lt's all right. You see, l can't afford to fight with Cynthia. -ls she your girl? -No. l gotta be nice to her till after Christmas. You expecting her to give you a special present? No. Look, this is a secret: l bought a car. l paid 1 2 bucks down on it and promised to pay 8 more by the 23rd. That's why l gotta be nice to her. -l don't get it. -Cynthia's Beezy Anderson's girl. He's away, and he promised to pay me to keep the other fellas away from her. She's just an installment on a car to me. Polly Benedict's my real girl, but she's away too. Sometimes l wonder if it's all worthwhile. Twenty bucks! Mother said in case l needed extras... ...so if you wouldn't mind, Andy, l'd like to pay for the sodas. -No. l asked you. -Please? Why, l don't do things that way. Andy... ...you need that 8 bucks pretty badly, don't you? You're darn tooting l do. l'd love to give you the $8, Andy. No. l couldn't take money from a woman. Not even if she's just a child? l couldn't even borrow it from you. -You wouldn't have to be nice to Cynthia. -You don't understand. Polly being away, the girl l take to the dance has gotta be sensational. l'll bet Cynthia's got a sensational evening dress. No, l can't afford to fight with Cynthia, not a man in my position. Then it isn't the $8. Well, it's both the $8 and Cynthia. l gotta take Cynthia to the dance to get $8 for the car... ...and l gotta have a car to take anybody to the dance. Well, then you won't really enjoy taking Cynthia? Well, even if she dances like a horse... ...it's an awful long ride home in the dark. Augusta, you must realize we're accustomed to the best of everything. l want you to pay particular attention to the coffee. You call that coffee? That's mud. That's what it is, mud. Augusta, do you realize you are being insulting? l quit. Any house that calls that mud coffee, l don't work in. -Oh, but, Augusta, l-- -Marian? Well, well, well, what seems to be the difficulty? -She insulted my coffee. -Mud. Any house that calls that mud coffee, l quit. l don't work there. But, Dad, you said yourself it was excellent. lt is. lt's fine coffee. Yes, Augusta, it's fine coffee. Of course, only amateur coffee. l know you could do much better. l'll try, Your Honor. We'll reserve that ''Your Honor'' for the courtroom. Okay, judge. Come along, Marian. We ought to write to Mother. Anyhow, it was mud. That's what it was, mud. But, Dad, the bathroom was filthy. The towels were black. Where he accumulates such filth and grease-- You can't please her. She hollers if l wash and hollers if l don't. He has no more conception of cleanliness than-- -Than a tomcat? -Exactly. You see? She wants me to lick myself clean. lf he thinks l'll clean up after him, he's wrong. Oh, l'll do that. lt'll be easy after twins at the Tompkins' . Thank you, Augusta. l'll go. Everybody spoils Andy because he's the baby in the family. Baby? Dad, am l gonna have to be insulted until l'm 80? lt won't happen again, Marian. Special delivery. She all right, Dad? Mother's well and sends her love. They don't know about Grandmother Forrest yet. Pretty serious, l guess. What do you say, with Grandma Forrest so sick, we give up our social engagements? Well, what is it that Grandmother Forrest always asks you when you visit her? ''Are you having a good time?'' l think that's your answer, Andy, in Grandmother's own words. l'll get it. Hello? Just a minute. -lt's for you, Andy. -Who is it? The same one. Cynthia. lt's the fourth time today. -She ought to move here and save money. -Oh, smart cracks. Hello, Cynthia? Yes, Cynthia. Well, anything you wanna do. Why, sure, l'd like to. Yes, ma'am. l mean, certainly, Cynthia. All right, Cynthia. Goodbye. Well, l don't think you're very amusing, Andy. What else is there to do at a pool except swim? lf you can't think of anything to amuse me-- Okay, okay, watch me. Andy! Stop it, Andy! Stop! Really, there's no need to practically drown me. l'm sorry. Come on in. The water's swell. No, my hair would get wet. Oh, well, can't you dry it? Andrew, l haven't ordinary hair like some girls. Special hair like mine is a great responsibility. l never get it wet. You'll get wet if you swim, get muscles if you play tennis-- -Other boys would be glad of a chance-- -Don't get mad... ...but you don't need a bathing suit to sit. Can't you think of something else to do? Well, we.... We could take a walk. Say, that's not a bad idea. l know just the place. lt's a little longer than the regular way home, but.... Well, l finally found something you like to do. Well, doesn't it interest you? Well, l'm not exactly doing you any favors. Would you rather be swimming? What do you think? Hey, Andy! Andy, come in a minute, l wanna talk to you. All right, but l can't make it long. lf l'm late for dinner, l'll catch it. -What's up? -Come here. l got something to show you. What is it? lt's a-- Must have been that jelly sandwich that l had. Come on in here. What's all the mystery? l got you a present. l hope you like it. Well, what do you know? Do you like it? Why, it's the best present l ever got. l'm glad. l guessed you wanted one, so l ordered it. lt just now got here. lt'll make my car look like a million. Gee, thanks, Betsy. Some girls don't know what to get a guy, but this is swell. Why, Cynthia, she'll be crazy about it. And Polly, she'll go wild. l'm sure they'll like it. l'll drop by before the dance and show you. That'll be nice. Dinner's almost ready, so l better be going along. -Thanks again. Goodbye. -Bye. Aren't you going to practice, Betsy? Yes, Granny. l know, but men just don't seem to be as important as when l was a young girl. Well, if it isn't the old ladies' sewing circle. -Hi, Andy. -Hello there, Andy. -Did you enjoy your games? -Games? With a bit more practice, l might be able to make the Potsy team. -What's that? -Nothing, nothing. Oh, all right. You're going to have secrets, so can l. There are ways of handling mysterious children. Just because you're the only woman here doesn't make you my mother. lf you act that way, l won't give you your telegram. Telegram! Oh, my dearest sister... ...if l've offended you in any way, l beg you to forgive me. After all, we children, we just-- We just don't understand. Gee, thanks, sis. Thanks. Two girls. Two girls for the same dance. Good morning, Dad, Marian. Any word from Mom? No news is good news, son. Well, in case you're at all curious, l finished my Christmas shopping today. Me too. And l wanna thank somebody for that extra money l found on my table. That's all right, honey. Christmas comes but once a year. -Well. -Special delivery for Mr. Andrew Hardy. l'll sign for it. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Good morning. Special delivery for Mr. Andrew Hardy. Thanks, Dad. Francis Bacon Anderson. Why, that's Beezy Anderson. -Want me to read it to you? -Good old Beezy, real pal. Right on time, just like the Pony Express. -Goodbye, children. -Bye, Dad. Open it. Let's read about the teddy bear Beezy's getting for Christmas. Oh, no hurry. l know what's inside. And l know who that is. ''This is Miss Potter speaking. May l please speak to Andrew?'' Kindergarten society. Hello? What's on your mind, Cynthia? Oh, don't worry about the dance. l wouldn't miss it for anything in the world. Oh, you got your new formal dress? Sensational, huh? No back in it at all? Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Well, l'll be seeing you soon. All right, dear. Bye-bye. Hello. ls Miss Polly Benedict in, please? Listen, will you tell her Mr. Andrew Hardy called... ...and he's unable to take her to the dance? He remembered a previous engagement. Thank you so much. Bye. -Hello. -Hello. l spent all my money except 60 cents, and l still got two presents to buy. Gee, l'd like to help you, Betsy, but l've got a very important deal to close. Beezy came through like the Marines landing. Then it's all fixed up about your-- Your car? -Oh, l'm ruined. -Andy, what's the matter? -Are you sick? -Oh, l wish l was sick. Oh, how l wished l was sick. Beezy's gone and fallen for another girl. He said l could have Cynthia. The whole deal's off. l'm cooked. Well, we've gotta do something. We gotta talk to Mr. Dugan. Come on. Come on, Andy. Come on. All right. No 8 bucks, no sports-model roadster, my friend. Gee, Mr. Dugan, couldn't l-- You gotta pay for this car by tomorrow noon or-- You're Judge Hardy's son, aren't you? Yeah, sort of. l'll go to court and get an order to show cause. And you know what that'll mean. Yeah, l-- l got a rough idea. Well, there you are. Andy. l've only got 60 cents... ...but l've got a fur jacket, practically new. We could pawn it and pay Mr. Dugan. But we just can't let this happen. Betsy, you're the best friend l ever had, but l couldn't let you do that. lt's-- Well, it's more than a car now. Yes, but if l did get the money, no one would know. l gotta do this myself. Dad used to recite me a poem. lt's all about a tangled web you make when you start deceiving people. l know what it means now. When you do something phony and it turns out good, it's still all wrong. -Maybe if l explained to your father. -No, l've gotta do my own explaining. Of course, l never told him any real lies. l just can't seem to be able to. But, gee, he'll start thinking that sometimes not actually telling a dozen lies... ...is worse than really telling one. No, l've gotta tell Dad. And there's no telling what'll happen. Did you want to be alone, Dad? No, not at all, not at all. Sit down. Dad? What's an order to show cause? ln case someone wants to start a lawsuit against you... ...they ask the court to direct you to show cause why they shouldn't be granted relief. Like being arrested? Technically, you're in custody. Why this interest in the law? Going to follow in your father's footsteps? No. A friend of mine got himself mixed up in one of them show causes. Too bad for your friend. -Dad? -Yes, Andy? l'm in an awful jam. Well, that's too bad. What's the trouble? l.... You see-- Start from the beginning. Well, to tell the truth, you're partly to blame for it all. l am? You and Polly Benedict's grandmother. You just tell me how l'm guilty. When l asked you for the money to get a tuxedo... ...you gave it to me. lf you hadn't, l couldn't... ...go to the dance where you had to wear a tuxedo. When you wear a tuxedo, you gotta take a girl... ...and you've gotta have a car to take her in. l see. Well, what about Polly Benedict's grandmother? She took Polly away for the holidays, so l couldn't take her to the dance. Because l couldn't take Polly, l got mixed up with Beezy's girl. -Beezy's girl? -Cynthia. The one that's calling all the time. -Dad, can l talk to you man-to-man? -That's the way l always want it to be. Well, man-to-man, Dad, can a guy be in love with two girls at once? Both are estimable young ladies? Oh, well, we just do a little hugging and kissing, Dad. l mean, good, clean fun, just like Polly and me. Object matrimony? Matrimony? You don't have to worry. l'm never gonna get married, ever. That's a momentous decision. Well, not at least until l'm middle-aged, you know, 25 or 26. That's a sound idea. -Dad, l don't understand these modern girls. -ln what way? Polly, for instance. Sometimes she won't let you kiss her. But this Cynthia, she'll let you kiss her whenever you want. She doesn't wanna swim, play tennis, go for walks. All she does is wanna kiss you. l'm a nervous wreck. Well, of the two degrees of kissing, which seems the most desirable to you? When you wanna kiss a girl and she won't let you, you wanna kiss her all the time. But this Cynthia.... Do you think it's wrong for a guy not to want a girl kissing him all the time? Well, what would you say? l don't know. When l only had three days to go around with Cynthia... ...l felt like a free man for the first time in weeks. Three more days? Yeah. l promised l'd date her up for Beezy till Christmas, to save her for him. For 8 bucks-- For 8 dollars that l needed for.... Remember, now, this is man-to-man. You'll know anyway tomorrow, so l might as well tell you. l gave Peter Dugan $ 1 2 out of my bank account for a down payment on a car... ...and promised to give him the remaining $8 by the 23rd. Was this before or after we had our little talk about cars? Before. l wouldn't have done it after... ...but l was already stuck for the 1 2 bucks-- Dollars. And, well, now Beezy isn't gonna send me the 8 bucks... ...and Mr. Dugan's going to your court to get an order against me... -...and here l am, and l'm sunk. -l shall issue the order. Mr. Dugan can serve me... ...and l'll take whatever steps l think necessary as proper punishment for you. Why, you can't do that! You mustn't do that! lt isn't human. Dad, why do you have to be an old crank, way behind the times? This is 1 938! You made easy money in Washington. l don't see why you can't give me $8. Andrew! Come back here. All right. Man-to-man. You've asked me a question, and l'll answer it. That money, that unexpected windfall, must never be touched. -Do you know why? -Why? That's to guarantee you a college education... ...so you, your sister and your mother will have resources to take care of them... -...in case l'm not able to. -ln case you lose your job? No. But a man doesn't live forever. Too frequently, l hear of men l went to school with that have passed on... ...and l'm shocked to learn that they leave boys like you... ...and girls like your sister and wives like your mother with nothing, not a penny. Dad, don't you dare talk about dying. -We must plan for it. -l can't stand it. l can't let myself think about you not being here. All right, Andy. Do you want into that kind of money... ...or shall we let it all remain in the bank? Give me a good licking. l'd rather have that than more talk. No, that's why l used words instead of a slipper on your pants. Are you feeling all right, Dad? Yes, l feel all right. -Have you been to the doctor lately? -No. What are you-- -Here. l'll get you a pillow. -No, no. There's nothing wrong with me. Oh, l understand. Well, don't you worry. Barring accidents, l expect to be with you for a long time yet. Maybe you'd better take a tonic. Once or twice a day. Maybe you don't get enough sleep. A little castor oil would do the trick. No, no, no. There's nothing-- Let's just dismiss our problem. Remember that your mother is a long way from here... ...and she's got a serious problem all her own. Why? Did you get a telegram from her? No, but l have a feeling Mother's not very happy at this minute. Did you get a message... ...kind of a thought, a telepathy? lt doesn't matter what you call it. After two people have lived as close as your mother and me after all these years... ...you sense things about each other. Why don't you send her a wire and make sure? They haven't any telephone. Besides, a telegram is always so startling to your mother. l'd give anything to let her know we're trying to help her. l know how we could get word to Mom without upsetting her. By using a ham. -A ham? -A ham outfit. A radio. Jimmy MacMahon's got one. We could have him-- Wait a minute. Hold on. l don't believe Jimmy MacMahon would be very eager to-- Why not? Because he was in your court once? Dad, kids don't hold a grudge against old folks just because they punish them. -No? -Certainly not. lf they did, everybody would be hating their father. Which, of course, they don't. Don't they, Andy? -You ought to know, Dad. -Yes, l know, son. l know. Tell me, now, what about this Jimmy MacMahon's ham? What do we.... Dad, write the message. Soon as he gets it-- All set? Quiet, please. Here we go. This is W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada. W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada. Emergency. W8XZR calling anybody near Brigham, Canada. Okay. Come in, Brigham. You mean to tell me that he can-- He contacts some bird with a ham radio near Grandmother's farm... ...and then this fellow, without disturbing anybody... ...goes and gives the message to Mom. -Amazing. -There's nothing amazing about it. -Kids are doing it all over. -We once got a guy in Australia... ...when the telephone people couldn't find him. Relax, because it takes quite a while. This is W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada. W8XZR calling CQ, CQ, CQ. This is W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada. W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada. W8XZR calling CQ, Brigham, Canada. Okay, come in, Brigham. This is VE3A VS at Brigham, Canada, calling W8XZR. Got him! This is VE3A VS calling W8XZR. Come in, W8XZR. This is W8XZR. Listen, Brigham, get this right. Emergency. Will you take down a message and get it to the Forrest farm near Brigham? No telephone. Sickness, maybe death in the place, so don't disturb anybody. Take this message. This is message number 247. To Mrs. James Hardy, Forrest farm, Brigham, Canada. ''Dear Mother: Send you all our love and hope and trust. We are here praying for you. God bless and keep you and yours. Father, Marian, Andy.'' Okay, VE3AVS, come in. Okay, W8XZR. Ill report back. Stand by. There you are, judge. There's nothing to do but wait. Well.... l never expected to see anything like this in my life. You're still alive, Pop, and you're seeing it now. This is VE3A VS calling W8XZR. Here we go. VE3A VS calling W8XZR. Come in, W8XZR. This is W8XZR. Go ahead, VE3AVS. I got in through the back door of the Forrests to cook in kitchen. Cook delivered message to Mrs. Hardy. Have a message from Mrs. Hardy to Judge James Hardy, Carvel. Take it down. Message number 329 to Judge James Hardy, Carvel. """"Darling husband and children: Inexpressibly helped by your dear thoughts. Grandmother very low. We wont know worst... ...until crisis sometime tonight. Hold the good thought... ...for we need it badly. All my love, Mother Hardy. """" Okay, W8XZR. Is that satisfactory? Come in, W8XZR. This is W8XZR. More than satisfactory, old man. Thanks a million. l'll do the same for you sometime. Say, who are you? How old are you? Where's your place? Come on in, VE3AVS. Hello, W8XZR. This is VE3A VS. My name is Basil Gordon. Im 1 2 and I work on my fathers farm near the Forrests. And I built this set myself. Drop me a QSL card. Come in, W8XZR. All right, Basil. Thanks again. So 73 and lots of DX. This is W8XZR signing off for the night. Twelve years old. l wouldn't believe it. Well, Dad, boys are good for something after all, aren't they? Jimmy... ...l'm going to send a check tomorrow for the damage to that tractor. And man-to-man, thank you. That's all right, judge. Thank you. And as for that tractor smashup, well, l had it coming. Heaven only knows what this generation has coming. -Oh, hello. -lt's Betsy. Excuse me, Judge Hardy. l just came over to see how Andy-- Marian said l could wait here until you got back. -Where is Marian? -Going over the household accounts. She can't figure out why food costs so much. About that other business, do whatever you think l deserve. l'll tell you what l'm gonna do about that, Andrew. l'm going down to Peter Dugan's place tomorrow morning... ...and get you your car. -Gosh! Thanks, Dad! -Andy, you'll have your own car! Sure! l got my new car! -Good night, Betsy. -Good night. Good night, and thanks again. lt's swell when both fellas think the other guy done him a favor. -''Did.'' -Did. And how. -Good night, Betsy. -Good night, Dad. -Andy. -Yeah? What are you going to do about your two girls? Gosh-all hemlock. l can't take two girls to a dance. We've gotta figure out how to settle things without any trouble. l wanna take Polly. She's the best-looking girl in Carvel. But l can't get rid of Cynthia. Cynthia's a stunner. She's gonna wear a sensational dress. But if l take Cynthia to the dance, Polly will never speak to me again. Andy, what if Cynthia accidentally learned about Polly... -...and Polly about Cynthia? -Don't even speak it. Then l'd have no girl. We couldn't have that, could we? But suppose you found another girl that Polly wouldn't be jealous of. You don't understand. Sensational girls don't come a dime a dozen in Carvel. Well, does she have to be so awfully sensational? Does she have to be sensational? To drive up in my new car... ...me in my tuxedo, to say nothing of the opera hat? Does she have to be sensational? l see. l guess no girl in the world would be sensational enough for that. -Good night, Andy. -Good night, Betsy. How long does it take for a letter to get from Carvel to Chicago and back? l don't know. lt depends how quickly it's answered. Why? Nothing. l was just wondering why Mother hadn't answered my last letter. -Good night, Andy. -Good night, Betsy. Polly, if you're still my girl after this mess is cleared up... ...l'll never go in for polygamy again. There's a lot of power, but l can't let her out all the way yet. Yes, l can feel it straining at the leash right now. Wait just a minute, Dad. l'll get it. l'll get it. When l put my new radiator cap on, we'll go for a long drive. l think l'd better stay close to the house in case there's word from Mother. lt's kind of a tough day before Christmas, ain't it-- lsn't it? Especially for Mother. After that business in the drugstore, l had to explain to you. -Awfully sweet of you. -You mustn't ever be jealous of me. Andy's simply thrilled he's taking you to the dance. -He says you're different. -l don't know. You have an important social position... ...and with a big formal dance, he couldn't afford to take you any old way. Well? So he bought a car so he could bring you in style. l wish l could be there to see you looking gorgeous in a new evening dress... ...driving up with Andy in his own car and everybody staring and.... -Have you seen the car? -Yes. He showed it to me at Dugan's... ...where he's buying it. Well, this is Dugan's now. And here's Andy's car. They've got it all fixed up and ready for him. Does he expect me to ride in this junk heap? Your dress might get dirty, but he'll cover the seat with a piece of carpet-- Me, in a thing like this. Well, l'll have a few words to say to Mr. Andrew Hardy. Of all the nerve. Well! Ive never been so insulted in all my life. You aren't fit to take a girl out who's been used to the very best. Don't you ever try to see me again, Mr. Hardy. Riding in such a wreck. Its insulting! Dont ever come to my house again. And dont you ever try to see me again, ever! lf you don't stop hollering, you're liable to get big muscles all over your face. Hey, Betsy! Oh, boy, oh, boy! What do you think has happened? -What? Tell me! -Cynthia won't go to the dance! That's a shame. She had such a sensational evening dress. We're gonna go and square it with Polly. l don't think l'd better. l don't know Polly. You'd love Polly. l'm sure she'd like you. Come on, she adores children. Come on. Come on, Betsy. Come on in. Hello, Polly. -l see you got my message. -Yes. The butler gave me your message, and it was very clear. Don't be sore at me. l can explain everything. lf you can explain this, you're smarter than l think you are. Smarter than l thought you were. Can l come in and talk to you for just a minute? l suppose one can't very well turn a former friend from the door. l only took the other girl out while you were away. You weren't gonna be here-- You didn't know until the day before l left. -You gotta be polite to people, don't you? -Did you take walks with her? No. A fellow has gotta have a little exercise. -Did you put your arm around her? -No. Maybe just a little bit. You-- You kissed her too. Polly, you make it sound-- l didn't like it. Honest, l didn't... ...very much. Don't be mad. l don't like any other girl except you. All the time, l was wishing you were here. Who's the girl? l can't tell you, Polly. Andrew Hardy, you tell me who she is. Cynthia Potter. That awful red-headed creature? -Andy, how could you? -l don't know, Polly. l must have been out of my mind, but l needed $8. Beezy said he'd give it to me if l'd date up Cynthia for him. -What? -You see, it was only for financial reasons. For money? Andrew Hardy, that's the most contemptible, the most-- You're nothing but a gigolo. l never want to see you again as long as l live. Polly! Polly, wait a minute. Besides, when l got your message, l made a date with a man from New York. And he's wearing full dress and a silk hat. Wait till you see who he is. Polly. Well? She never wants to see me again. l doubt if Thomas Edison himself could have done better. lt's lovely, Dad, but l do think Andrew might have helped a little. He's sitting in, walking around, polishing and pouring out his heart to his new car. But it is about time he came in. Well, anyway, the tree's done. Well, why don't you sleep out here... -...or take the car to bed with you? -l wouldn't get to sleep anyway, Pop. l guess l was just too smart for myself this time. First l had two girls and no car, and now l got a car and no girl. There just isn't any justice. Andrew... ...for years l've been administering justice as l thought the guilty ones deserved it. You'd be surprised at the number of people who define justice... ...as something they think they'd like to get. -Why don't you go to the dance alone? -Stag? No. The fellows would think l couldn't get a girl. l'd be ruined. l just can't take any girl. She's gotta be a knockout. Well, that's not exactly a new thought either. -Well, don't stay out here too long. -l won't. Betsy, you've grown up. Am l sensational? l'll say. Andy, even though l'm only a little girl, even little girls can see ahead. l was afraid there might be trouble, so l wrote Mother. She always understands. She's the one that sent me this sensational dress. She said that just once before l left Carvel l could be grown-up. She even sent me a wrap. That's for the long drive home in the dark... ...even though l'm not Cynthia. This will be a world's record! l'm gonna go put on my tuxedo and my opera hat. Maybe l'll shave! See that it's parked. And mind the fenders. Yes, sir. Tonight's my big night, Andy. l hope l don't break my neck. These heels are two inches high... ...and they're killing me. l'll tell you about that later, Alan. This is not like the swell shindigs in Washington. There are so many ambassadors, any time you do a Big Apple... ...you insult half of Europe. -l think it's grand. -Well, it's pretty swell. Do we seem provincial, Dennis, after all the wonderful parties you've played for? Of course not. l think the party's charming. Hope they like our music. -Hello, Andy.

You gotta be smart to get into as much trouble as Andy does. Betsy, l'll never be able to thank you enough for last night... ...the radiator gadget, you wanting to pawn your coat, Polly-- No, Andy. l've gotta thank you. You know what l'm gonna do? Write an Andy Hardy page in my memory book... ...and read it every day for five years... ...because on account of you l was grown-up for one night. Just like Cinderella. With an evening dress... ...and high heels and leading a grand march. You see, Andy, now l know how wonderful life's gonna be when l'm 1 8. And you did it all.

Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Step right up to the platform, ladies and gentlemen. You will see the greatest show on the midway for only 50 cents. These little ladies are entertaining you now, but in just a moment... ...Little Egypt will turn on her stuff. She has danced before all the crown heads of Europe. She makes blue blood turn into red. Ladies and gentlemen, step right up... ...and buy your tickets for Sandow, the strongest man in the world. He juggles pianos. He plays marbles with cannonballs. He lifts 10 times his own weight with one arm. He can even raise his own salary. Now, folks, step right this way. You are looking at the sensation of the fair, the eighth Wonder of the World. Ladies and gentlemen, this way. This way. This little lady has wiggled herself... ...from the desert to the shores of Lake Michigan. And she's about to give you an exhibition absolutely free. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the dance that Little Egypt does inside... ...but to prove our generosity, we're going to give a demonstration... ...of that famous dance, the hootchy-kootch. Egypt, wiggle. That's sufficient. Now, ladies and gentlemen-- He's a masterpiece of manhood. Step up to the box office and buy your tickets. The show's about to begin. --phenomenon. Ladies and gentlemen, this-- Well, how's business, Ziggy? And now, ladies and gentlemen, Sandow concludes this performance... ...by lifting, with Herculean strength, the largest dumbbell in the world. An unusual feat, ladies and gentlemen... ...for inside this huge dumbbell, there are other dumbbells. Ladies and gentlemen, look. There you are. Aren't they beautiful? Aren't they glorious? A total weight of 750 pounds. Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it marvelous? Let's give him a big hand. What made you bring me to a show of this kind? Well, you wouldn't let me see Little Egypt. I'll bet a heifer against a mare the weights ain't on the level. Seven hundred and fifty pounds, my foot. - I wonder what her total weight is. Oh, Bill? - Yes, sir. - Open the curtains, will you? - Open up those curtains. Hey, Bill, you know, it seems to me that this platform-- Oh, hello, baby. Want some candy, Jane, huh? Bill, we ought to have this platform built higher. There ought to be more steps. The people in the back row can hardly see. But, Mr. Ziegfeld, there's never anybody in the back rows. Well, nevertheless, I want this higher. There ought to be a lot more steps. Okay, Mr. Ziegfeld. I'm sorry I lost my temper, Florenz... ...but I am awful disappointed. I hope you never get downright disgusted. What is wrong? Why don't they come in? You're the attraction, and you're asking me? Maybe you would like to cancel my contract. Oh, no, Sandow. When I make a deal, it's a deal. I like that. I like you. Well, I like you too. If you want to pay me some of my back salary, I take you to dinner, yeah? Well, I'm not very hungry. You're not worrying about your money, are you? - You don't think I'd ever walk out on you? - No, no. Nobody do that to Sandow. - Maybe I better take you to dinner. - That's fine. Hands up, mister, and give me all your money. Well, I can't give you anything with my hands up, sweetheart. All right, fresh, 23 skidoo for you. I'll help myself. Oh, no. Oh, I see you got my little surprise. This morning. Gee, ain't it swell? - Were you really surprised? - Well, wouldn't you be? - Yes. - If you expected a diamond ring. Oh, don't be-- Tell you what we'll do. - We'll go to the Little Vienna Restaurant. - Oh, I'd like that. - Telegram, Mr. Billings. - Oh, thank you. Just wait a minute. There might be an answer. Let me see. - Oh, well, I'll be. - Bad news? No, it's from Ziegfeld. He's across the midway. He can touch me, but he has to send wires. Listen, ""In Little Egypt, you have the best female attraction of the fair. In Sandow, I have the greatest male attraction. Why not fake a romance? The people will eat it up. Then we can show them together, and I'd be willing to split 50-50."" - Well, that sounds like a great idea. - Oh, yes, great. I'm selling out every performance, he's going to be thrown out... ...and he's willing to split 50-50. Give me your pencil. I'll answer this one. - Jack? - Yes. - Is Ziegfeld a good friend of yours? - Oh, yes, we've been pals for years. - But you wouldn't like him. - No? No, he's up one day and broke the next. If he got $ 10,000 tomorrow... ...he'd spend it on the girl he liked tomorrow night. Wouldn't want to waste your time meeting a fellow like that. - Not if I met him on the right night. - On the right--? Oh, don't you-- - Shut up! And just send that collect. - Yes, sir, and I'll deliver it too, sir. Because every time I take Mr. Ziegfeld a message, he gives me 50 cents. - Oh, he does, does he? - Sure. Yes, well, that's probably why he's always broke. Come on, dear. This cheese is so strong it could walk over and say hello to your coffee. Well, it had better not. This coffee's too weak to answer it. Florenz, you're wonderful. You make jokes even when you're so worried you can't touch your cold cuts. I got no appetite neither. No? Message for you, Mr. Ziegfeld. - They told me I'd find you here. - From Billings. So soon he answers? He must be crazy about your proposition. - Yeah. - Read it to me, Flo. Read it. ""Dear Ziggy, your proposition interests me."" What did I tell you? ""But why fake a romance between Sandow and Little Egypt? Let's make Sandow marry Little Egypt, and I'll split the children with you 50-50."" That message was collect. - Fifty cents. - Have you change for a dollar? - Sure, but you always.... - Keep it. Gee, thanks. Florenz, I love you. I will break chains for you... ...I will lift buildings for you, but I will not have children for you. But if I have children, I will not split them. - Oh, hello, Ziggy, I got your wire. - I just got yours too. Patterson tells me he's putting you out Saturday. - He tells me too. - How do you do, Mr. Ziegfeld? How do you--? - How do you do, Miss...? - Yes, Blair, this is Mr. Ziegfeld. - I'm very happy to know you, Miss Blair. - I'm so happy to meet you, Mr. Ziegfeld. And this is Mr. Sandow, the strongest man in the-- The strongest man in the world. Jack tells me the loveliest things about you. Oh, yes, I imagine. - I could tell you lovely things about you. - He's only just met you... ...and he's going to tell you all about yourself. - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - Oh, but no, we've got-- There's a table-- - I've seen you many times... ...on the midway. - Fibber. I bet you never even noticed me. - Yes, I have. Yesterday, you were wearing a red dress trimmed in black lace. - Yes. - And a yellow hat, and it was atrocious. - Oh, indeed? - Each was all right in itself, mind you... ...but the combination.... And last Sunday, you were wearing a blue gown and an orchid hat. - Well, yes. - And you were wrong again. Well, aren't we the observer? Do you always check the right combinations for women? - Always for beautiful women. - Oh, well, that's nice. Thank you. - How do I look today? - Well, I don't like your hat. - It shades your eyes, and I like your eyes. - Thank you. He ought to be packing his own clothes instead of selecting yours. - Come on, Ruth, we've got to go. - Yes. Well, goodbye, then. - I'll be seeing you around the grounds. - Yes. Well, not after Saturday, you won't. - That fella Billings makes me mad. - Yes? Even that music from his Little Egypt drives me crazy. You won't have to listen to it much longer. Wait a minute. Come away. For five weeks you've been touching that elephant for luck... ...and now in five days, we get put out. I know it's superstition, but an old Hindu told me... ...that if you touch an elephant's trunk, and he raises it, everything will be all right. Wait, wait. We know we got hard luck without that elephant should tell us. Say, I know what's wrong. You should touch him. You're the attraction. - Me? - Sure. Go on, go ahead. It sounds silly, but all right, I'll do it. Look, Florenz, would he do that for me? The Great Sandow. Sandow. So that's what you call good luck, yeah? Look, Sandow, you've got to expect a little rain with the sunshine. That was very embarrassing, Florenz, very embarrassing. Don't get your dander up. Who knows? Maybe that little shower will bring us oodles of luck. Well, I hope it brings us so much business like that Little Egypt. Look at those peoples, how they crowd in to see that woman make wiggles... ...when yet they wouldn't come to see me lift weights no other man in the world can. Sandow, I'm afraid your trouble is you developed the wrong muscles. What you say? Every muscle in Sandow's body is developed... ...even the toes, like that. With one arm I make a better dance than that Little Egypt with the whole body. Look, boss. Good heavens! - Are you Mr. Sandow, the strongman? - Yes, madam, this is the Great Sandow. Oh, look at those huge shoulders. Aren't they marvelous? - Yes, dear, come on. - And that big chest. - I never saw a chest like that before. - Oh, come on. And his waistline, oh, it's simply magnificent. - Precious, come on. - Just a minute, dear. Mr. Sandow, I think your muscles are simply astounding. Perhaps madam would like to feel the muscles of Sandow. - Oh, I'd love to. - Sandow, your arm. - Florenz, is she dead? - No, she's only fainted. - But, oh, what an idea. Come on! - What? Wait a minute. What's wrong? - Where are you going? - The papers. To the newspapers. I'll fill them so full, women will fight to see you. Not to watch you lift weights, but simply to feel your muscles. Why, you've got more sex appeal in your one arm... ...than Little Egypt has in her whole-- Sandow, the modern Hercules. The miracle of strength. Watch his muscles quiver in musical rhythm. Sandow, quiver. Sufficient. And now, ladies, if you want to see more of the Great Sandow... ...if your hearts are strong enough to stand the thrill... ...step up and buy your ticket. The show starts in five minutes. - Folks, this is the show-- - How's business, Jack? All right? - Doesn't it sparkle? - Yes, doesn't it? - You like it? - I certainly do. I'm glad. - Dr. Ziegfeld. - Yeah? Can't I play my piece for you now? I get awful tired of this.... I don't blame you, Mary Lou. So do I. Go ahead, then. Go on, play your little piece now. - Dr. Ziegfeld? - Yes, dear. - Do you know I was mad at your son? - What? Mad at your best fella? Oh, but why? Because he left us for that old World's Fair. Oh, well, darling, you know the fair closed yesterday. And is he coming back here again? Well, I hope so. Go on. You go on with your lesson. - Dr. Ziegfeld. - Yes, dear. Did you know I was going to marry your son? Well, well, this is so sudden. - Are you? - Oh, yes. We got that settled months ago. Oh, yes, Father, didn't you know Mary Lou and I are engaged? Well, don't I get a kiss today? Not even a smile? Well, Father, what do you think of that? My future wife won't even kiss me... - ...and I brought her a present too. - What? - Kiss first. - No, present first. No, kiss first. I'll tell you what. We'll both give at the same time. How's that? I'll count three. Ready? One. - Two. - Same time, remember. Three. Thank you so much. Dr. Ziegfeld, isn't it lovely? - Beautiful. - I'm going to open it right now. - Right now. Yes. - Oh, well, well, well. Well, Florenz, what have you decided to do? Well, I'm going to New York tomorrow, Dad. With that Sandow, that strongman? Father, I don't really belong here. No, I don't like it. You don't like it, huh? The greatest music conservatory in the country. I built it all myself. Students from all over the world are coming here... ...and you-- You don't like it. You realize that maybe somewhere in one of these rooms... ...we find a future Beethoven or Liszt? And you, my own son, all you want is a circus. A circus with a fellow that can throw cannonballs. Well, now, Dad, don't be upset. - Sandow is a means to an end. - Yeah, to your end. When you was a little fellow, since then, I've educated you in music and art. From your mother, you got the refinement, taste, culture. What good has it all done? What has it done you? What are you now anyhow? A muscle manager. A beef exhibitor. Then you got to go on the outside, and you gotta be.... You gotta act like a dog outside. You act like a dog. Wait a minute, what do you mean, a dog? You know what I mean. I don't mean you're a dog, I mean you got-- You gotta go outside and be a barker. That's a dog, ain't it? Now let me tell you something. If you go away from here... ...I'll never speak to you again as long as I live. - Oh, Dad, you don't mean that. - Yes, I do mean it. And I mean-- I mean every word of it. Hey, wait a minute here. Now, you just stop that crying. Now, you tell your fellow why you're crying. If you're my fellow, why are you going away? What--? Now look here, you sit right up here, and I'll tell you all about it. Now, I'll be honest with you. - I'm not really your fellow. - You mean you don't like me anymore? I not only like you, I love you. But you know, I'm the funniest kind of a fellow. I love all the girls. How can you do that? Do they let you? Well, you didn't quite understand what I mean, darling. Look.... Some people like beautiful paintings. - Like that one? - Like that one. Some people love beautiful flowers. - Like those? - Like those. Now, I love beautiful little girls like this one. - You know what I'm going to do someday? - What? I'm going to take all the beautiful little girls like you... ...and I'm going to put them together and make pictures with them. - Will I be in a picture? - Well, I should say you will. But in the meantime, I think that we ought to break our engagement. - Why? - Well, because... ...there are going to be lots of boys... ...who want to take you out and buy you sodas. If you're engaged to me, you can't go with them. - Why can't I? - Because if you're married to me... ...I'm not going to have you running around with other boys. I couldn't stand for that. - You couldn't? - Well, of course I couldn't. - Well, what are you laughing at? - At you, you're jealous. Well, you can just bet I'm jealous. Well, now I've got to run along. Florenz. - Will you be home to dinner tonight? - Yes, Dad. Well, I'll see you then. And in the meantime, son, remember: Anything you do, I wish you luck. I knew you would. Hold it, Mr. Ziegfeld. Thank you. Thank you. Greetings. Greetings to San Francisco... ...from my troupe, including the strongest man in the world, Sandow. Humane Society? Say, what's this I read in the papers about a lion and a bear? Is your society going to tolerate such an atrocity? Are you going to spill the blood of animals over the good name of San Francisco? Well, I didn't think you'd permit such cruelty. Why, it would be a crime to send a poor grizzly bear... ...into a cage with a man-eating lion. Crime. - What's so funny? - Oh, you wouldn't understand... ...because you don't know Ziegfeld. Police are after him... ...and this paper's two weeks old, so he's probably in jail by now. - But do you know him, Jack? - Oh, yeah, he's a pal of mine. Hello. - Well, Jack, this is a surprise. - Yes. - Certainly glad to see you aboard. - Yes, well, I'm glad I-- Pardon me, I'll be back in a few minutes, darling. I thought perhaps you were-- - Hey, who is she? - You'll never know. What happened in Frisco? Did you really send Sandow in against a lion? Sure, but the lion wouldn't fight. Wouldn't or couldn't? To tell you the truth, Jack, I didn't stay for the finish. - I sort of thought that.... - Yes, I know. Well, where is Sandow now? He's in New York. He's going into the legitimate. - He's with Lillian Russell in As You Like It. - Yeah, well, I don't think I'd like it. What are you going to Europe for, another strongman? Oh, no, no. Just a little vacation. - London? - Well, Monte Carlo first. You're gonna lose all the money you made on Sandow, huh? - No, I'm going to double it. - Oh, yes. What are you going for, another Little Egypt? Oh, no, just a rest. Of course, if I see any exceptional talent, I'll pick it up. Well, naturally. So will I. Oh, you got anybody in mind? No, no. Why, have you? No, no. Only the greatest artist in Europe, that's all. Say, who's that? If I told you, you'd cross me before we crossed the ocean. Beg pardon, sir. Miss Carlisle wishes to know whether there will be three for tea or just two. Just two. Yes, just two. - Miss Carlisle, huh? - Yes, sir. Oh, thank you. You're.... - You're Mr. Billings' man, are you? - Yes, sir. Well, you're very efficient. - What is your name? - Sidney, sir. Sidney. How much does Mr. Billings pay you, Sidney? One hundred a month, sir. Only-- Well, that's not very much, is it? I hadn't thought of it, sir. Well, think of it, Sidney. London Evening News. London Evening News. Oh, take care of the luggage, will you? And tip the doorman, Sidney. Yes, sir. You have a reservation for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr? - Yes, sir. Will you register, please? - Surely. Is Mr. Billings still here? - Yes, sir, on your floor. - Oh, yes. Boy. Rooms 325 and 26. Thank you. Sidney. Well, you ingrate, you deserter-- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Well, why didn't you tell me you were dissatisfied? I-- - You pirate. - Now wait a minute, Jack. Gentlemen don't quarrel over gentlemen's gentlemen. - Oh, you-- - Let me tell you the whole story. If you're still angry, Sidney can go back with you. - Oh, I-- - Look, Jack, it was this way. I've always envied you. Your dress, your style, the way you look. So that when I saw your valet, and I realized... ...that it was he who took such magnificent care of you... ...well, I just couldn't resist the temptation of hiring him for myself. You mean, you wanted to look like me? Well, that's right, Jack. I wanted to look just like you. You faker. What are you doing here? I thought you weren't going to be in London for weeks. Well, that's a long story. You know, I was going to break the bank at Monte Carlo. Yes, I know. But the bank broke you, huh? - What did you lose? - Fifty-thousand dollars. - What have you got left? - Fifty cents. Fifty cents. Well, I'll see you later. But, Jack, wait a minute. Lend me 5000, will you? Well, would you--? Would you make it 2500? If I gave you $2500, by the time you tipped six bellboys, you'd be broke again. Look, Jack, I really need it. I'll tell you what. I'll give you $500 if you'll catch the next boat back to New York. There's one leaving in the morning. Fair enough? It's fair, but not enough. Will you sail with me? Oh, no, Mr. Ziegfeld, I have business in London. Oh, haven't you got the world's greatest artist yet? No, not yet, but I will have. Who is it, Jack? Go on, you can tell me now. I'm broke. I won't tell you till I have her name on the dotted line. It's a her, is it? Yes, and a beautiful her too, and she's signing the contract tonight. - Goodbye, Mr. Ziegfeld. - Goodbye, Mr. Billings. I say, doorman, did Mr. Billings come out? Just this moment drove away. I've got a very important message for him. - Do you know where he went? - Palace music hall. - Is it a good show? - Not so much, sir. Except for the French actress. She's truly wonderful. She has eyes this big, sir. Every time she blinks them at you, you jolly well blink yourself, sir. - Have you seen Anna Held, sir? - No, no, I haven't, but I will tonight. Thank you, sir. I say, sir, do you realize you gave me 5? Yes, I'm trying to lose weight. Isn't it magnificent? For me, Marie? From whom? Whoever gathered all the orchids in the world just for me? I do not know, but they must've cost thousands of francs. Was no card with it? Oh, yes. - Marie, this is very strange. - What, madame? I learned the English words, I sing the English songs, yet I cannot read English. What shall that mean? Please read it to me. ""My dear Miss Held, it is very important to your future... ...that you see me before signing any contracts. I shall be waiting at the stage entrance immediately after your performance. Florenz Ziegfeld Jr."" - Who's this Florenz Ziegfeld Jr? - I do not know, madame. - And why is it junior? Is he a little boy? - I do not know, madame. I will not see this Mr. Ziegfeld Jr. You will see Monsieur Billings, oui? Oh, Marie, these flowers are very nice. I think I am polite and see this Monsieur Junior Ziegfeld. But Billings is coming to talk to you about the great American tour. Has madame forgotten his cables? Oh, yes, that's all right, but these flowers are very beautiful. Well, Jack, she's all right. Yeah, I know she is without you telling me. - I wish you wouldn't keep following me. - All right. - Well, good night. - Good night. I wish you wouldn't annoy me. Miss Held is expecting me. - I'm going to sign the contract tonight. - That's great. - You bet it is. - I said it was. - Yes, well, good night. - Good night. Will you stop shadowing me? I'm not following you. I just happen to be going your way. You've got a date with a chorus girl, I suppose. You're going to spend that $500. I can't spend it. I've spent it. - Oh, you've spent-- Well, good night. - Good night. I beg your pardon, sir, but-- I have an appointment with Miss Held. - Is Mr. Ziegfeld out here? - Oh, no-- Yes, my dear. I'm Mr. Ziegfeld. Mr. Ziegfeld, Miss Held would like you to come in, please. Would you mind that for me? Well, good night, Jack. Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld, your orchids. They are the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen. Won't you come in, Monsieur Ziegfeld? Your flowers are so beautiful. I could not resist the temptation to thank you. Miss Held. Do you mind my telling you... ...that you should never wear so many jewels on your hands? - You think so? - Some women, yes. But your hands, no. Oh, that's a very nice compliment. Did you hear that, Marie? - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. I did not know Americans could be so gallant. Tell me, Monsieur Ziegfeld, are you in the theater? Yes, I'm a producer. Did you hear that, Marie? Monsieur Ziegfeld is an American producer. Do you know Monsieur Billings? Billings? - Billings. - He's American producer too. Oh, is that so? - No, I've never heard of him. - No? Of course, not in New York, that is. America's a big country. We still have producers in the West putting on shows for the Indians. - Indians? Do you mean the savages? - Yes. Did you hear that, Marie? - I do not think I will like America. - Oh, you'll love New York. - Would New York love me? - I think so. You only think so? Did you not like my performance? Yes and no. - Yes and no. Does it mean yes or no? - Well, both. - Did you not care for my singing, no? - Yes. A trifle nasal, I thought, but yes. And you did not like my costumes either? I thought one dress was very effective, but the rest, no. Monsieur Ziegfeld, I think you are very rude. Please go. Marie, open the door. Monsieur Ziegfeld. Yes? Come back, please. Sit down. You know, you are very honest. I like you very much. Your note says it is important to my future to see you. Why is that? - If you want to play in New York, it is. - I have many offers for New York now. I've no doubt, but so have many others. There's foreign talent going into New York every day. - What happens to them? - What? Well, they open at Tony Pastor's theater, and they get the hook. The hook, what is that? Hook, a little thing you catch fish with. You know, a hook. Now, if I take you over, I'll present you on Broadway. In a great show, in the best theater, to the best people. I'll exploit you from coast to coast. Exploit? What is that? I'll put you over, I'll sell you. - Sell me? - To the public. And I'll make them pay for you. And how much will you pay me? I'll advertise your name from every corner. Women will be wearing Anna Held hats, shoes, corsets. Even the children will know you. But how much will you pay me? More publicity than you've ever dreamed of. Yes, that's all right. But how much money will you give me? I'll give you the greatest opening night that New York has ever had. You'll see the Goulds, the Astors, the Vanderbilts. ""Diamond Jim"" Brady, Lillian Russell. - Lillian Russell? - Yes. - Oh, I would so much like to see her. - Well. No. First you must speak about the money because I have so many offers now. I'll meet your biggest offer. Really? Well, that is very nice of you. But maybe when you hear how much it is, you don't think I'm worth so much. How much is it? They are all very good, but the highest one is that of Mr. Billings. He says he will give me 50,000 francs besides my salary, which is very big... ...just to sign the contract. That is how much in American money? - $ 10,000, madame. - $ 10,000, monsieur. - Ten thousand dollars. - Oui, that's a very big amount. And even if you would give me the $ 10,000 and I sign with you... ...you still would have to wait till I finished my London engagement. I couldn't do that. You couldn't even wait for me? I couldn't even give you the $ 10,000. - You think it's too much, huh? - I think it isn't enough. But I haven't it. What, you expect I should sign a contract for America with you... - ...and you don't even have $ 10,000? - I haven't even 1000. I did have before I stopped at Monte Carlo, but right now, I haven't even 100. - But I'll spread your name all over-- - It is enough! You're just trying to make the fool of me. You are the impostor. You are no gentleman. Please go. Marie, open the door. Monsieur Ziegfeld. Come back, please. Sit down. You know, you're very honest. I like you very much. Mr. Vanderbilt's carriage. Mr. Van Rensselaer's carriage. - She has big eyes. - But I couldn't understand a word she said. - I'll take Lillian Russell. - Mr. Astor's carriage. - Did you like her? - Cute. Did you notice the empty seats? Miss Russell's carriage. - I think she's charming. - Why, there's Lillian Russell. Mr. Thaw's carriage. Never mind, I don't want a carriage. The show's all right if they had an American star. Mrs. Harriman's carriage. Mr. Stuyvesant's carriage. You made a bad bet, Jim. - May I have your carriage called, Mr. Brady? - Yes. Oh, Ziggy. Stanford and I just made a little wager. He bet me 5000 that I wouldn't get back the 10,000 you borrowed... - ...to bring Anna over here. - Mr. Brady's carriage. I'll split your end 50-50 with you, Mr. White. I told you so. I told you so. Well, what's a few thousand dollars anyway? Mr. Chandler's carriage. Mr. Saks' carriage. Balcony 22. Well, Sampston, what's the loss this week? The show earned a profit of $ 1340.32. You drew $2550... ...which gives us a loss of $ 1209.68. That's terrible. We can't keep the show running with losses. - Say, where's Sage? - Upstairs. What a press agent, never around. Take a wire to him. - But he's just upstairs in his office. - I know it. Take a wire anyway. How can you do business without publicity? Stop. Anna Held was the sensation of Europe. Stop. Appeared before kings and queens. Stop. Yet you get nothing in the papers. Stop. You're ruining me. Stop. If you're a press agent, I'm President Cleveland. Stop. Beg your pardon. Pardon, madame. It is not jolie. It is jolly. Jolie, that's what I said, jolie. Pardon, it's my mistake. I mean jolly. Jolly. Good. Please, let's start again. Jolly. No, no, no. I won't sing today. I can't sing today. I'm much too much inside here. Much too much. Marie? Marie. It's so silly for Anna Held to take singing lessons. But Ziegfeld did not ask me to teach you. I simply want to help madame to lose her French accent. But your accent is much more than my accent, and I don't want to lose my accent. Marie, did you try to get Monsieur Ziegfeld again? - He is not home, madame. - Please try it again. - And the reporters? - They are still in the lobby. Tell them to go away. Tell the hotel to push them out. Tell them we are going back to France. That's what we will do. We are going back to Paris. - Shut up, Pierre. - I'm too happy, madame. - Happy about what? - We are sailing for Paris. - No. - No? No, I changed my mind. Marie, go unpack my things. - You see, it's true. - It is not. - It is. - No. What is true and what is not true? Pierre says madame is in love with Monsieur Ziegfeld. Did you say that, Pierre? - Why did you say that, Pierre? - Because I'm afraid it's true. Why are you afraid? Don't you like Monsieur Ziegfeld? Oui, madame, that's the trouble. Everybody likes him, especially the ladies. Oh, madame, you'd never be happy with him. You'd never be able to hold him. Why, he attracts women like the flowers attract bees. Like the flypaper attract the flies. Well, that's all right. I've seen the flies on the flypaper... ...and it seems to me they stick very well. - But, madame-- - Pierre, please. How can I love someone who puts terrible things in the newspaper... ...has millions of reporters annoying me? Pardon, madame, but the newspapers have been very nice to you. Why don't you want to see the reporters? Because I know exactly what they want to ask me. - You do not understand, no? - Frankly, no, madame. Oh, then I will tell you what happened. Two months ago, Monsieur Ziegfeld says: ""Anna, from now on, I'm going to send you, every day, a big present."" I say, ""Thank you so much, Flo--"" I mean, ""Mr. Ziegfeld. But already you send me orchids every morning."" Those are from him. But he says, ""No, Anna, this is something much more important."" So naturally, I cannot wait to see what he sends me. And the next day, what do you think I get? - A diamond ring? - No. - A bracelet? - No. Four big cans of milk. - Milk. - Twenty gallons. - Twenty gallons of milk? - Twenty gallons of milk. - Shut up! - Twenty gallons of milk. - Oh, please. - No. I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Well, that night I say to Flo-- I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld: ""Flo, why do you send me so much milk?"" And he just laughs and says, ""Anna, that's a great idea. You get it from now on every day."" ""Every day, 20 gallons of milk?"" I say, ""Flo, who can drink so much milk?"" And do you know what he says? ""Don't drink it, bathe in it. And you will be a big success."" - No! - Well, I'm too angry to speak. In Paris, I was a big success because they liked my voice. In London, because they liked my singing. But in America, to be a big success, I need 20 gallons of milk and must sit in it! - Well, do you bathe in it, madame? - No, of course not. But every day, we get the milk and take it in... ...because Monsieur Ziegfeld says we must carry out his idea. And what happened? Did you read this morning, the paper? - No, madame. - Please. - ""Ziegfeld is sued for Anna Held's milk bill."" - On the front page. - Twenty gallons of milk. - Oh, I'm so ashamed. Marie, please call him again. If he's not there, leave the message. Tell him I do not want one can more of milk from him. And I don't want the orchids either. - Hello? - Oh, those reporters again. Tell them no. I do not want to speak to them. Madame, it is Monsieur Ziegfeld. I don't want to speak to him either. I never wish to speak to him again. Where is he? Downstairs in the lobby, madame. Tell him to come up. But if he brings one of those reporters, don't let him in. No, Pierre. Let them on the floor. I want him to see them there. I make him pick them up. He embarrasses me, I embarrass him. Madame, if you will take my advice, you will not appear so excited. Yes, you are right, Pierre. Pierre, play. Play. I sing for you, yes. Just like he's not here. We'll let him wait till I'm finished. Come on, play, play, play. - Your missus is in lovely voice today, Marie. - Oui, monsieur. You will see. Marie, someone has apparently spilled the orchids. Now, will you phone Sidney for me? Have him send up another dozen immediately. Well? Why do you not pick these up? Because fallen flowers, my dear, are like fallen stars. They soon lose their luster. Marie, pick them up. No, I cannot sing today. I'm much too angry to sing. I'm sick of watching you roll your eyes like I do. Please go home. I give you your notes. Please take them. Go home, yes? Go. So I'm a fallen star, yes? I have no luster, no? Oh, yes, you have, my dear. - But do you know what it comes from? - I don't care. What? Milk baths. Or at least that's what you must tell the reporters. I'm so hurt. The front page of the paper says you are sued on my account. If you send milk, why don't you pay for it? If I did, it wouldn't be in the papers. Can't you tell them I just used the milk without buying it and being sued for it? They wouldn't believe it. Now it's a matter of record. Besides, they don't care whether I ever pay the bill. All that interests them is that in two months, you've used 1200 gallons of milk. This is terrible. - Ask the reporters to come up. - Do nothing of the kind. Anna, you must not insult the press. If they come up, I tell the truth. No, at first, tell them nothing. Desk, please. Pretend embarrassment. Pretend it? I was never so ashamed. Are the gentlemen of the press still waiting for Miss Held? What are you doing? Oh, yes, if you will, please. I will say I never in my life took a milk bath. I will tell them it is all a press story. I will go back to France. Marie, pack the things. Quick. This time I mean it! You cannot make a circus of me. I'm not a strongman like Sandow. I'm a real artist, and I never, never, never will say that. Yes? Oh, ask them to come right up, please. No! Anna, don't you realize that if we put this story over... ...your name will be in headlines from coast to coast? Every woman in the country will be talking about you. I don't care. I do not have to be a cow to be a success. And before I make such a fool of myself, I tear up my contract with you. So... ...where is it? And besides-- Besides-- And besides, you do nothing as I like to have it. It must always be your way. I ask you 1000 times to have costumes like Lillian Russell. She has not to take milk baths to be a success. She is beautiful. But, no, I cannot have gowns like her. There now. Tell the reporters about that! - Anna. - I mean it. I'm determined. Anna. You let the reporters come up, yes? All right, I tell them everything. Anna? Well, I should tell them, no? No. Now, you do what I ask you to, darling... ...and I'll do whatever you wish. You mean, you'll let me have gowns like Lillian Russell? Oh, no, darling. You're not her type. - But I'll tell you what I will do. - What? I'll put eight Lillian Russells on the stage behind you. Isn't Anna beautiful? I wonder if the milk baths really make her skin so nice. Oh, they most certainly do. I've been taking them for a long time. Oh, Marie, were they not wonderful tonight? And the girls! Don't they look gorgeous? Marie. Look. From my Flo. Oh, my Flo. Oh, Marie! Marie! You read what he says. Oui, madame. Read it to me, quick! What does it say? ""My darling. I never knew that one long year could seem like one short moment. You are magnificent, my wife. Flo."" Oh, Marie. - Marie, did you hear that? - I just read it, madame. No, no. Did you hear what he says? ""You are magnificent, my wife."" Oh, madame, look! Look! Marie! Come on, help me. Oh, isn't it gorgeous? Oh, madame, look, look! Here's another one! Oh, Marie! Oh, that makes me so much inside. Here. Much too much. First, he gives me all the flowers in the world... ...and now he takes the stars from the heavens, just for me. ""You're magnificent, my wife."" - Am I magnificent, Marie? - Oui, madame. No, no, no. He's magnificent, not I. Marie! Marie, I must show them to the girls! I come back immediately! And when Mr. Ziegfeld comes, please tell him he shall wait! Girls, would you like to see something wonderful? Oh, what is it? - Look! And this! - Diamonds! - From my husband! - May I try the bracelet? - Yes, sure. - That's gorgeous. Audrey, are you not interested in my presents? I would be if they were mine. But, Audrey, you will have many of them someday. Maybe you have to work a little, to suffer a little. - But what is that? - I'll work, but I won't suffer. - Here you are, dear. - Thank you. Isn't it beautiful, Audrey? I'll say it is. I'd give my soul for one like it. That would be a very bad bargain, Audrey. All right, that's fine! Tie it off! You're better with your feet than your broom. Mr. Ziegfeld, you think so? I wish you'd give me a chance. I've got talent. I'd like to get away from shifting scenery and moving props. - How long have you been a property boy? - Five years. But my heart hasn't been in it. You've been working a long time without your heart. - That tickle you? - It does. And this weekly return tickles me more. Look, a profit of $5000. If you'll just be conservative, I mean, live reasonably. Don't incur any fresh obligations, forget you have charge accounts... - ...and you'll soon-- - You're right. - I will. - Darling! Oh, Anna. Anna. You're the sweetest husband in the whole world. Mr. Sampston! Look. From my husband. On our anniversary. This and this. Are they not gorgeous diamonds? Yes, indeed, Miss Held, gorgeous. Good night, Mr. Ziegfeld. Good night, Sampston. He didn't seem very happy about my presents, oui? Anna, men who keep books are never very happy. Marie, you go out for a while. He is my maid tonight. Go, go, go, go. - Oh, I am, am I? - Yes, you are. Later, I count the diamonds in the bracelet and necklace and kiss you for each one. What about the orchids? Don't I get anything for them? For each petal of each orchid, another kiss extra. So.... Take off my stocking, please. You know, this might get to be a habit. Flo, you're wonderful. Do you know that? I suspect it. Everything you promise me, you do. Everything you say will happen, happens. And now I am a big success in America, thanks to you. Flo! Why do you do that when I am trying to say nice things to you? Besides, you're a very bad mate. But I love you. - Flo? - What? Flo, are you as happy as I am? Happier. Why do you ask? Because sometimes I think I am too happy. Sometimes I get afraid it won't be always like this... ...working only for you while you do the show just for me. Couldn't I do another show without spoiling our happiness? Of course you could. Don't be silly. Do you want to do another show? Well, darling, now that you've made such a tremendous success... ...I have a little idea that I'd like to carry out. Idea for a show? - The biggest kind of a show. - With music and girls? - Beautiful girls and-- - And without me, oui? Well, darling, you couldn't do two shows at once, could you? Now, Anna, see here. Suppose we go down to Rector's and celebrate our anniversary? - No, I don't-- - Just us and a bottle of wine. - I don't feel like it. - Come on, now, dear. - No, I'm so nervous. - It'll be good for you. I'm so tired. I'm so disappointed in you I could scream! - Now, Anna-- - I mean it. I thought you loved me more than anything in the world. I thought I am your one ideal, your only ambition. - Anna-- - No. I think only of you, and I thought you will only think of me. But it is not so. You have big plans without me. You will do a big show. You will go broke again! Anna, you're jealous. - No, Flo! - Yes. Don't say that, no, no, no! I hate jealous people, and I don't know what's.... I'm angry, and I wish you would go. Please, please. Please go. Go! Go! Marie! Marie. Flo. - Good morning, Mr. Billings. - Good morning, Miss Drake. Messages? Nothing important, except Mr. Erlanger wants to see you today. Mr. Ziegfeld is in your office. Well, why in my office instead of out here? I thought he'd be more comfortable in there. Well, I-- Oh yes, I see. To what do I owe the honor of this visit, Mr. Ziegfeld? Mr. Billings, if you've ever had it in for me, you've certainly avenged yourself. This is positively the worst cigar I've ever smoked in my life. How are you, Jack? - All right. How are you? - Never better. Sit, won't you? Thank you. Nice of you. I'm here to do you a great favor. I'm sorry, I can't take advantage of it. I'm broke. That's why I'm hooked up with Erlanger. Oh, well, that's fine for me. He's just the man I need. Jack, I want to do a new show, a big show. I'm willing to split it 50-50 with Erlanger, and all he has to do is put up the money... - ...and furnish the theaters. - Oh, that's all? That's all. Of course, you'd furnish the star. Oh, this isn't for Anna. Anna's show is all set. No, in this one... - ...I want to star the girls. - Don't be ridiculous. Without personalities, you haven't got a chance. I'll have personalities, all right, Iots of them. But they'll mostly be blonds and brunettes. What are you going to call this opera? I'm going to call it the Ziegfeld Follies. Follies. Follies, all right. What's the matter? That's a good title. What's so unusual about a girl show? We've got plenty now. I don't mean that kind. They're way out-of-date. You're using the same scenery you used 20 years ago, wood wings and flats. I want to do a show with silk drapes, with lace, with beautiful girls. I won't dress them for the men in the front... ...but for the women in the back. I want to surround them with glamour, glitter. Glorify them. Say.... There's a good word, Jack. ""Glorify."" Sounds all right if you know what it means. It'll look all right too. ""Glorifying the American Girl."" Where you gonna find these beautiful girls? I'll take them from homes, from stores, from shops-- From offices. I beg your pardon. Mr. Erlanger would like to see you now. Oh, all right. - Yes, well, that'll do, Miss Drake. - Yes, sir. Now, listen, Ziggy, not her. She's the best stenographer I ever had. - All right, Jack. - Here, here. - You will buzz the little giant? - I'll tell him... - ...but I doubt he'll be interested. - He's missing a great opportunity. Yes, I know. But, well, I'll drop you a line about it. Perhaps tomorrow. Wire me, will you? Well, if you'd rather hear the sad news sooner, I'll wire. Yes. What's that? They won't give us our share of the profits? All right! Open him in Boston... ...jump him to New Orleans, and then on to Frisco. Funny thing, Billings. You just can't be nice to some people. Yes, that's what I was thinking. Ziegfeld was just here. What did he want? Remember when he stole Anna Held right from under my nose? Then, so I couldn't get her back, he married her and made enough to retire. Now he comes back, broke again... ...asking me to ask you for the money to put on a new show! Well, that's nerve. What do you want me to do? Give him the money. - Cantor and Will Rogers! - $50 a pair! - Best show in town! - Tickets, boys? And gentlemen? Standing room only. Come on, girls, come on, come on! Get up those steps! Come on! You realize this is opening night? You take that brace and put it down here! What is it? I've only got two minutes. You ready to go in with those steps? I've built so many steps for Ziegfeld, they go in by themselves. - What follows this number? - The-- I know, Greg Williams. Have the finale costumes arrived? Mr. Sampston's talking to the costumer now. Oh, I see. Trouble again. You can't do this! It's an unheard-of procedure! I'm very sorry, Mr. Sampston, I want my money. It's preposterous! Ridiculous! - No money, no finale costumes. - It's a holdup! Oh, hello. You can't do this to Mr. Ziegfeld. Wait here a minute. - Allen! - Yes, sir. - Where's Ziegfeld? - Haven't seen him in 10 minutes. - See if he's in the front. - Yes, sir. No, no, I'll go. No, no, you go. - No, no, send somebody else. - Yes, sir. Joe! Tell him I must see him immediately. The show depends on it. This is going to be the death of me. This is awful. Wait here for me. You will wait? You bet I will. Yes? - Hello, Sam. How are y'all? - Mr. Rogers? You look kind of worried. What's on your mind, Sam? I was looking for Mr. Ziegfeld. Just a minute, Sam. Mr. Ziegfeld, it's very important. The costumer's-- Will, the audiences love to hear you talk. Well, shucks, Flo. I can't talk any more than I do. Gotta get the rope tricks in, don't I? I think they like to hear your wisecracks better. Perhaps they do, but what will I talk about? I ain't got anything to say that's funny. - Mr. Ziegfeld-- - Now wait a minute, Sam. Your wife tells me you keep her laughing all the time... ...just about things you read in the papers. I catch on. Betty's been putting you up to this, huh? Well, I got a sort of a habit of telling her all I know is what I read in the papers... ...and she says that's what I ought to tell the audience. Just sort of be kind of a running gag item. - She's right. - Oh, sure, Betty's always right. But she don't have to stand on the stage and catch those overripe tomatoes... - ...if the gag don't work. - Mr. Ziegfeld, I must interrupt you. - The finale costumes are here. - Oh, good. - Will you do it? - I might. - They won't leave without the money. - Give them a check. - Will you do it tonight? - They want the cash. They sent the costumes for this show COD? No, sir, not this show. They want some money on the last show. Reckon you got your shows mixed up? Well, I reckon. A little. If I can help you out on anything, why, let me know. Thanks, Bill. I'm all right. Well, tell me if I can. Of course, I don't suppose it makes a lot of difference, because... ...even with the costumes on, girls in this show... ...ain't exactly overdressed. You save your wisecracks for the audience, Bill. - Hey, buddy! Hey! - Yes? Your opening night, your big chance, and you're still moving scenery? I can't help it, Mr. Ziegfeld. It gets in the blood. Besides, I don't know how I'm gonna go over tonight. I don't wanna lose a job till I'm sure of the other. When I hired you as an actor, I fired you as a stagehand. Better make good. You'll find yourself without any job. - Well, what seems to be the trouble? - No trouble, I hope, except-- Except he's holding us up! - He refuses to leave the costumes unless-- - Unless he gets some money, and he's right. Let me see them first. At once, Mr. Ziegfeld. Open up the basket. I tell you, Mr. Ziegfeld, these dresses are wonderful. The finest work I have ever done. Look, Mr. Ziegfeld, isn't it stunning? Perhaps you made a mistake. This isn't for me. Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld, for the finale. Not my finale. Mr. Schutz, this is the New Amsterdam Theatre. This is the Follies. I know, Mr. Ziegfeld, and this is the costume for the finale. Well, not for my show. Why, I couldn't let my girls appear in a thing like that. That's horrible! Oh, take it away. But, Mr. Ziegfeld, they were made from the sketches of your own designer. You yourself made the changes on the sketches when you gave me the order. I never ordered that. That's terrible! Take it away, take it out of my theater! But, Mr. Ziegfeld, I worked over three weeks on these dresses. I have plenty of money invested in them. I'm sorry, but I can't help that. What do you want to do? Disgrace me? No, no, Mr. Ziegfeld. But please do not disgrace me. I mean, Mr. Ziegfeld, please let your girls wear my costumes tonight. No, I wouldn't humiliate them. If you aren't satisfied, I'll make it up to you, but please don't make me take them back. All right, but just this once. Send them up to the dressing rooms. See me in my office next week. - Next month. - Next month. Thank you very much, Mr. Ziegfeld. - They are beautiful, aren't they? - Awfully expensive. All right, girls, places for the melody number! He's singing very well tonight, Mr. Ziegfeld. He's all right, but there's too much white. Merv, he's too white. Bring up the pink in your footlights. Are the steps high enough for you this time, Mr. Ziegfeld? No, I don't think so. We could use more, a lot more. - I'd like to see them higher. - How's that, Mr. Ziegfeld? That's perfect now. Keep it that way the rest of the number. Ain't that something? Don't you like your flowers, honey lamb? - They're beautiful. Was there a card? - Oh, sure. Here it is. And there was a package too. I done unwrapped it for you. - You've done looked at it too, I suppose. - Oh, no, honey lamb, I never. - Pour me a drink, Flossie. - Another? Ain't you all forgetting... ...you got a midnight show to do on the roof tonight? And ain't you all forgetting to pour that drink? Well, scratch my back, honey. Is them diamonds, or is them stars? - Who sent them to you, honey lamb? - Who do you think? I know. They's from Mr. Zieg-- - Here he is. - Tell him to come in. Yes'm. Audrey. - You were beautiful tonight. - Thank you. Flossie, pour us a drink. No, no, no, please, dear, no. I just came to tell you-- Somebody else thought you were beautiful too, oui? From an old friend. Not too old, I hope. What a beautiful bracelet, Audrey. Is this from your old friend too? - Do you like it? - Yes, it's charming! You know, your friend must have very good taste... ...because this is just the sort of jewelry Flo would like. I told you someday you will have lots of diamonds, didn't I? Yes, you did. And I told you I wouldn't suffer, remember? Yes... ...I do. Well, congratulations again, Audrey. I'll see you later. On the roof, oui? She's really quite beautiful, Flo, oui? - Yes, she is, isn't she? - You're very much interested in her, oui? I'm interested in all my girls, dear. But maybe a tiny, little bit more in her, oui? A lot more. - She's very unusual. - Yes. I could make a great star out of her, if she'd only let me. Ladies and gentlemen! On behalf of the rest of the company, I've been asked to make a little speech. Well, you see, I have a confession to make. Little Audrey is a wee bit tight tonight. No, but seriously, you really shouldn't applaud all of us... ...because everything we've done we owe to Flo. You see, I was just a little chorus girl when Flo discovered me. He taught me how to walk and how to dress... ...and how to smile. So.... Well.... Here's to Flo. I am afraid you must forgive Miss Lane tonight. She just passed through many weeks of very tedious rehearsals. And the nervous strain of an opening night. She's not really herself. On behalf of my company, I want to thank you. You've been very kind to my girls and my stars. And speaking of stars... ...there's a young lady here tonight who, in my opinion... ...is destined to reach the top of her profession. She doesn't work for me, I'm sorry to say... ...but I'm very proud of her. She's here tonight with her producer, lucky fellow. And if she will, I'm going to ask Sally Manners to take a bow. Sally Manners. Nice of him to pay my star a tribute, isn't it? Yes, it is. I hope you've got her on a long contract. - Are you ready, Mr. Ziegfeld? - All ready. Now, you'll be signing the contract but look in the camera. The picture wouldn't be right without the Manners smile. All right? All right, shoot! Those things horrify me. - I think we're both to be congratulated. - I feel it's a great opportunity. - Thank you. - Sage, if you'll take Miss Manners... ...and the boys into your office, I'm sure she'll have things to say. - I could tell them how happy I am now. - May I congratulate you? - Thank you. - Right this way, Miss Manners. - Ms. Manners.... - Come along now, boys. - Where's that girl you said was my friend? - Here I am. I didn't want to disturb you. You told them out there that you were a friend of mine, huh? Yes, I did. Well, I see. Just to get into my office, huh? - Smart girl. - Well, I am a friend of yours. Have you forgotten me? No, no, of course not. I.... I remember you very well. Who am I? - As if I didn't know. - Do you? Of course. I always remember the time, the place and the girl. It was.... - Atlantic City. - Nope. - No? - No. Well, that's funny. I seem to remember a chair on a boardwalk... ...you beside me and.... Are you sure it wasn't Atlantic City? It might have been Atlantic City, but it wasn't me. Now I remember! Why, it was right here in this office. You came up to see me about a year ago. Oh, now it all comes back to me. Well, how are you? Where have you been? No. - No? - No. You don't seem to remember... ...the time, the place or the girl. Well.... Perhaps this will help you. Mary Lou! Well, how's my girl? How's my fella? Well, my little Mary Lou is a big girl now, isn't she? Yes! Yes, indeed, a very big girl. - Aren't you glad to see me? - Yes, I certainly am! Even if I wasn't at Atlantic City with you? Don't be silly. I knew you all the time. Now, fibber.... - Well, how long you been in New York? - One day. - One day. You seen my father lately? - Yes, just before I left. Oh, that reminds me, he told me to give you a big kiss. Well. You know, I think that in all fairness... - ...I should tell you I am a married man now. - Yes, I know. I read about it. It nearly broke my heart. But being married in New York doesn't mean anything, does it? Oh, yes, it does, young lady. Now, why are you here, and what can I do for you? Well, first of all, I want to give you a big kiss for all the candy you sent me. You've already done that twice. Now, what else? - Well, I want to go into the Follies. - You do? - I've been taking dancing lessons two years. - Yeah? - How do your father and mother feel? - I haven't a father and mother anymore. I'm so sorry, my dear. Of course, Jimmy won't like it. - Who's Jimmy? - Just another fellow I've been engaged to. Oh, well.... - All right, I think we can look after you. - Do you think we can have dinner tonight? Well, no, no, I'm afraid we can't. - Oh, Alice! - Yes, sir. Take this lady down to the stage and tell Julian to put her on as an extra dancer. - For the time being. - Oh, gee, thank you! Mary Lou is an old friend of mine from Chicago, and she's a stranger here. - So I'd like you to sort of look after her. - Yes, sir. - This way, dear. - Oh, may I say one thing before I go? - Well, yes, of course. What? - I forgive you for not marrying me. - All right. Goodbye, dear. - Goodbye. - Hello. Pardon me. Hello, Alice. - Say, Flo! I know! You got a new song. I'll say we have. Play him the melody, Danny. Oh, you'll go crazy over this, Flo. Mr. Ziegfeld. I must interrupt you. This is important. - I got an idea. - How much will it save? - This has nothing to do with money. - Feeling all right? My usual headache, but this is about talent. - Good and cheap, no doubt? - Exactly. A young lady, the name of Brice. - Fannie Brice. She's working in burlesque. - I've seen that gal, Flo. - Pretty? - Well, yes and no. Shut your eyes and listen, yes. Open them and look, no. - But a great performer. - We should see her at once, tonight. - Shall I take your coat? - Why not? You bought it for me. I gave it to you because you've been behaving yourself this week. What are you going to give me next week? - Watch the show. - I don't see how you can find... ...great stars in a place like this. Some of our greatest stars have come from places like this. Well, of course, not being a star yet, I wouldn't know. You can, if you behave yourself. - What's on now, Fannie? - Jim Boss. - If that guy's funny, I'll be a-- - That guy's gonna be a big star someday. - He can make you laugh and make you cry. - Yeah, and he can make me sick. Comics bore me. You give me a pain in the neck too, always telling me who's gonna be a great star. Once in burlesque, always in burlesque. Unless you got looks or a voice or something. - Well, that's what I got, kid. - What? - Something. - On the level... ...you don't hope to get out of burlesque? You're good here because these people are from 10th Avenue. How good do you think you'd be on Fifth Avenue? Half as good. Another silk stocking gone. I'll never buy anything from those stage-door peddlers again. That's what you said before. What'd you let the fella in for? Here. He told the stage doorman his name was Belasco. And you thought it was the Mr. Belasco, the producer. - Calling personally to see you? - Well, maybe I was a little optimistic. Miss Brice, Mr. Ziegfeld is here to see you. Another peddler. First it's Belasco, now it's Ziegfeld. Tell Mr. Ziegfeld I'm not in, and if I was in, tell him I wouldn't see him. And if I did see him, tell him I wouldn't buy a thing. - Yes, miss. - Thank you. Miss Brice? I hope I'm not intruding. - I'm Florenz Ziegfeld. - Is that so? Sarah, this is Mr. Ziegfeld. Mr. Ziegfeld, this is Sarah Bernhardt. Not the Sarah Bernhardt? Well.... - A pleasure to run into you. - If you run into your friend Belasco... ...tell him about the runs in his stockings. - Do you know David Belasco? - Better than you know Ziegfeld. Well, come on, what do you want for it? I'm not interested. Miss Brice, I am here to offer you a great opportunity. That's what they all say. What kind of fur is this? This? - That's mink. - That so? And what's the price? Well, the original cost was $2700. Who cares from originals? Copies is just as good. Come on, I'll try it on. Yes, of course. As a matter of fact, it ought to fit you very well. Don't give me the talk, just tell me the price. I don't wanna buy it, but I'll give you $50 for it. - And not a cent more. - Miss Brice, the coat is yours. - Stuck again. - Fannie! Are you really gonna buy it? If I can give Belasco 4 dollars for silk stockings made of cotton... ...I can give Ziegfeld more for a mink coat made of skunk. Besides, a bargain's a bargain. Here. Here's your $40. Get out before I change my mind. Thank you. Fannie! - Fannie! - What? Fannie, look! - What? Moths already? - No, feel! It's real mink. How do you know? I've been promised one often enough to tell. It's real mink, all right. It's probably stolen goods. - You mean it's hot? - Of course it's warm. - Then I'll be arrested if I keep it? - Of course you will. Call the stage manager! Call the police! Call my mother! Come in. Message for Miss Brice. You read it. I'm dying. ""Dear Fannie Brice. I can't accept your $40, but you can please me by accepting the coat. I shall expect you at my office in the New Amsterdam tomorrow... ...as I want to engage you for the Follies. Florenz Ziegfeld Jr."" Fannie, it was him! It was Ziegfeld! How do you like that? I like it. Fannie! Fannie! Have you fainted? Can't you see I have, you chump? Get me some whiskey! - Oh, Miss Brice? - Yes, sir? - We're ready for you. - I'm coming right down. Yes, sir, I'll be right down. I'm coming as fast as I can. I thought I had more time. Don't lose your nerve, kid. This is your big chance. Be a trouper! Look at you. You're working for Ziegfeld now. And you look like a million dollars. For the first time in your life, you're class, you mug. Wait a minute! Ho! What in the--? Fannie! What in the world are you made up for? Veronica? Clarence? Anything I can do, Mr. Ziegfeld? Yes. Come here, will you? Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld? Will you rip off that train? - But, Mr. Ziegfeld! - Go ahead. Take off the hat. Get rid of this boa constrictor. Now, will you get me a shawl? An old shawl. Yes, sir. How do you expect Miss Brice to sing a sad song about her man... ...dressed up like a nightingale? I find personalities, you try to destroy them. I didn't engage Miss Brice as a showgirl. - Is that all right, Mr. Ziegfeld? - Well, that's all right for now. Tomorrow, buy her another outfit. Go to a secondhand store and get her an old dress. She's supposed to be an apache, a poor French girl, an urchin. So to work for Ziegfeld, I gotta be an urchin. Even in burlesque, I was middle class. Now... ...let me see this, Fannie. Fannie? Sing the song. Now! Vic? All right. Let's go. If she can turn those tears on in front of an audience, she'll be a sensation. Look. Look at the girls. Mr. Ziegfeld, shall we get back to that conference? The boys are still waiting, you know. Yeah, yeah. Tell them I'll be right up. She's all right. She's gonna be great. - Who's that? - Brice. Fannie Brice. - I've got a great spot for her in this show. - And I discovered her! That's right, Sam, and you deserve a raise. And I'd give it to him, but I'm afraid he wouldn't approve of the expense. - How's it look, Gene? - It's the best we've ever done. You're the best author. Herbert's the best composer. Julian's the best director. Joe's the best artist. Sam's the best bookkeeper. I'm dying to hear it. Every line he writes is a laugh. We open on a street in Cairo. Didn't I tell you every line was a laugh? We open on a street in Cairo. Along comes a man leading an elephant. Wait just a minute, Gene. - Can you boys stand a shock? - Well, what do you mean, Flo? I hate to tell you this because I know how hard you've worked.... - But I've decided not to do another Follies. - What? I'm going on with this new edition with Brice... ...but after that I wanna do a story. Something with a plot. Something with all the glamour of the Follies, around a sweet, simple story. Something that will fit this little girl Sally Manners. We might call it Sally. Oh, Jerry. Hello, Flo. How are you? - I was just thinking of you. - It's nice to be thought of. - Hello, boys. - Hello. Remember that melody you played at my house a few weeks ago? - I played several. - And they were all beautiful. But this one was.... You remember? You were going to send it to me. Oh, I know. ""Look for the Silver Lining."" That's the one. Come on, play it. Do you mind? Sure, I will. I've got the lyrics right here. Fine. Get this. ""Look for the Silver Lining."" See what I mean? That's what I want. A story just as simple and sweet as that tune. Sing it, Jerry, will you? Ziegfeld... ...these gentlemen are pestering me about money for scenery, costumes and whatnot. And I wanna tell you in their presence, I have no interest in this show... ...and in no way am I concerned with it. Our agreement is for Ziegfeld Follies and nothing else. You understand that, gentlemen? Nothing else. Mr. Ziegfeld, this is very unpleasant at a rehearsal... ...but we insist on at least 50 percent of our money before opening. - We are selling a lot of tickets. - Sampston, that's our best proposition. - Mr. Ziegfeld, we're ready for the finale. - All right, Benny. Boys, what are you worried about? Have I started anything I couldn't finish? Don't my curtains always go up? Why, if I owed you 100 times the amount I do, you'd get it. - Come to me tomorrow, I'll pay you. - 50 percent, Mr. Ziegfeld. A hundred percent if you want it. Maybe I can give you an advance on the Eddie Cantor show. I'm doing a story with him too. Eddie Cantor? How are you gonna do it? - I don't know. - Finale. Mr. Ziegfeld, Audrey Dane is visiting backstage... ...and she brought a lot of champagne with her. - Well.... - Yes, sir? Never mind. - It looks very good, the show, huh? - Yes, it's wonderful, really. - I'll be back in a moment, darling. - All right. Hello. I wanna see every one of you in my office in the morning. Get out. Audrey, you know I've forbidden drinking in the dressing rooms. Oh, Flo, don't be mad at me. I just asked the girls up to have a drink. It isn't their fault. You see, it's my f-- Now, Audrey, please. Please stand up now. I can't. I wanna get down, but I can't get down. Lift me, Flo. Audrey. Oh, don't put me down. Don't put me down. Audrey, you've broken your last promise to me. Flo! You should have at least closed the door. Wait! Anna! Anna, please don't misjudge me. I couldn't help it. She's drunk. Do you always do that when she's drunk? The members of your company must enjoy that very much. Oh, Anna, don't say that. Don't you understand, dear? When one of my girls-- Poor Flo. You have so much trouble with your girls, oui? Anna! Aren't you going to eat your grapefruit, sir? No, nothing, Sidney. Well, we know now why she didn't come home last night. I'm sorry, sir. - Did you send the flowers? - The minute I learned the address. - A dozen orchids as usual. - Good. Mr. Sampston called again, sir. He says the bank positively refuses to increase your loans. - Thank you, Sidney. - Yes, sir. - Miss Dane, sir. - Here? Undoubtedly she's read the paper, sir. Show her in, Sidney. Well, Flo, congratulations. - On what? - I just saw the headline. I don't think I'm to be congratulated, Audrey. Little Audrey is speaking out of turn again. - And I was a bad girl last night too. - I don't think you should have come here. So that's how you feel. - Going to Atlantic City tonight? - No. - Isn't the show opening there tomorrow? - No. Broke again? Yes, broke again. - Please don't turn the elephant, Audrey. - Afraid I'll spoil your luck? So... ...nobody thinks enough of your new star to loan you money. I don't blame them. Why didn't you star me in the show? You, with all your promises. ""Audrey, if you'll just behave yourself, I'll put your name on Broadway."" ""Audrey, if you'll only stop drinking, I'll have great shows written for you."" Why didn't you make me a great star? - I couldn't depend on you, as I could on-- - Yes! Well, all right. Depend on her now. Go on, star her. Do anything you like with her. I hate you! I'm never gonna see you again. I'm quitting you and your show. I hope you don't get the money to open it. And if you do, I hope it's a flop! That's how I feel about you! And this is how I feel about your elephant! - Sidney? - Yes, sir? Take a wire to Mr. Billings. Will that be all, Mr. Billings? Yes, that'll be all, thank you. - Miss Jones, take care of that right away. - Yes, sir. I got another telegram from Ziegfeld. He can't open his show unless we help him. We won't help him. I told him so yesterday. I'm not interested, and I won't loan him 5 cents. - Send him a wire-- - I just did. - Did what? - Wired him the money. Isn't that Mr. Ziegfeld? Say, Flo, why don't you go put on the costume... - ...and get into the spirit of the dance. - I'm tired, Gene. Come on, Flo. Don't lose interest in everything. No, I'm going home. Good night. - Let me have that megaphone, honey. - Yes, sir. - Willie. - Flo, you're not leaving. - Yes, I am. - We're starting a Paul Jones inside... ...and I promise whenever you get a pretty girl, I'll blow the whistle. Not tonight, Willie. Say, who is that girl with the gorgeous red hair? Why, that's Billie Burke. Thanks, Willie. - Good evening, Jack. - How do you do? Come on. Willie. - Yes, Flo? - I'm staying for the Paul Jones. Whenever you see me with Miss Burke, blow the whistle. Okay. Take your places for the Paul Jones, everybody. The Paul Jones! - Well, do you think we ought to? I-- - Oh, yes. I love the Paul Jones. - Perhaps we could both go the same way. - No, we can't do that! Oh, Well, I.... Miss Burke. Mister...? It doesn't matter. Oh, no, I'm supposed to-- I've got to-- We're not-- - Oh, no, this is our dance. - Oh, is it? - Miss Burke. - We meet again, Mister...? It still doesn't matter. Won't you tell me? - Tell you what? - Your name. - Why don't you ask Mr. Billings. - I will, if I can find him. But you seem to stand in with the whistle. Oh, yes, when I was a little boy, I used to love to whistle... ...and a whistle never forgets. - Aren't you getting bored? - No. Are you? - I'm afraid not. - Tired? - Are you? - No, but I'd much rather just talk. - Would you mind? - No. Don't you love the lights of New York? For me, they're more beautiful than any landscape. - More beautiful than the mountains? - Yes, I think so. - Are you too cold out here? - No, indeed. I'm enjoying it. That is, I.... I mean, the electric signs fascinate me. ""Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Fleischmann's Yeast, Ziegfeld's Follies."" - Do you know Ziegfeld? - No, I don't want to. - I understand he's a horrible person. - Horrible? Yes, they say he's a terrible lady's man. Well, I suppose that's forgivable. He's surrounded by so many beautiful women. Yes, yes. Strange you've never met him. I don't want to. I love his shows. They're so beautiful and in such good taste. It would disappoint me to meet him... ...and find him to be a fat, pudgy man with a big stomach. He's not fat and not really so pudgy. - No? You know him? - Oh, yes. Yes. He would like you. - How do you know? - Didn't you just say he had good taste? Well, you're sort of a lady's man yourself, aren't you? I think with you as the lady, I could make Ziegfeld look like an amateur. - You haven't told me your name yet. - If you don't mind, Mr. Ziegfeld... ...Miss Burke, with the permission of her producer... ...came here with me tonight. And if you've no objection, I'd like to have one dance. Mr. Ziegfeld? Well, you were right. He isn't pudgy. - Shall we go in? - Yes! - Don't I get one more dance? - I'm afraid not. I imagine it's Mr. Frohman you're really afraid of, isn't it? - Oh, I'm.... - Perhaps. He doesn't want you to appear too much socially. Frankly, no, he doesn't. And you don't like me very well anyway, do you? - Frankly, no, I don't. - No. She doesn't! You put him in his place, all right. What would Gen. Grant think if he knew we were using... ...the very shadow of his tomb as our meeting place? Well, I never knew the general personally, but I have an idea he'd approve. I don't know. Nobody else seems to. At least, Mr. Frohman doesn't. And why not? Why can't we meet where we like? Go where we want? Just because he has you under contract... ...is no reason he should dictate your personal life. - I'm here. - Yes, and so am I. But it must seem like kindergarten to you. Why? The great Mr. Ziegfeld, producer of the Follies... ...surrounded by hundreds of beautiful women... ...sitting on a bench, holding hands... ...watching the riverboats go back and forth. - Doesn't sound a bit like you, does it? - No, it doesn't. But here I am, sitting on a bench... ...holding hands and watching the riverboats go back and forth. And regretting all the years I haven't known you. Didn't Anna Held take up a few of those years? Yes, Billie, she did. She was truly a wonderful woman. I love you for saying that. Look, there's another ferryboat going across to the Palisades. Will you keep your eyes on it while I tell you something? Must I look at a ferryboat to listen to you? Yes, or I won't be able to tell you. You mean the great lady's man is bashful? Strange as it may seem, in your presence, he is. All right, I'm looking. I love you, Billie. The ferryboat. I haven't anything to offer you, because there's nothing you really seem to need. You've made the most of yourself unassisted, and that's grand. Ferryboat. You're a great star already, so there's little I can offer you. Nothing I can give you, except my love. That isn't enough. I'd expect part of your ambition, half of your trouble... ...two-thirds of your worries and all of your respect. Here's your medicine, madame. No, thank you, Marie. I'm tired of it. - But, madame.... - No, no, no, no. Perhaps you would like to go to Paris? No, I'm too tired to go anywhere and to do anything. Marie.... Look at the paper... ...and tell me where did they go on their honeymoon? But they couldn't go anywhere, madame. Miss Burke is appearing in a play here. We saw her only two weeks ago. You insisted, madame. You remember. Oui, I know. And we enjoyed it very much too. She's a lovely actress, Marie, oui? She has such twinkling eyes... ...and such a funny little twitter when she speaks. Yes, I can well imagine Flo being in love with her. Marie? Call his office. I will congratulate him. Hello? Brian 3093, please. I should wish him luck, oui? - Oui, I should. - Mr. Ziegfeld, please. - Miss Anna Held speaking. - No, Marie, hang up! - I cannot speak with him today! - Mr. Ziegfeld? He's on the telephone, madame. He is? Hello, Flo. Yes, here's Anna. I'm so happy for you today. I could not help but call on you and congratulate you. Wonderful, Flo. Never better in my whole life. I'm so excited about my new plans. I'm going to Paris. Yes, for a few weeks, and then I can get back... ...and then I'm doing a new show, and I-- Oui, it's all so wonderful. I'm so happy. Yes, and I hope you are happy too. Yes? I'm so glad for you, Flo. It sounds funny for ex-husband and ex-wife to tell each other how happy they are, oui? Yes, Flo. Goodbye, Flo. Goodbye. If you love him so much, why did you divorce him? Because I thought it would bring him back to me. I was sure that it would bring him back to me. Goody, goody, goody! Is that all for me? That certainly is, every bit for you. And that isn't all. Sidney? Yes, sir? Now, if you don't like the view from this side... - ...then-- - I don't. - That's the chimney Santa came down. - Yes! - That's where the reindeer stopped. - I wonder how they kept from sliding off. Probably the bricks stopped them. See, Mommy, it's almost big enough for me to get in. - It is! - It's almost big enough for us all to get in. - Oh, yes! Sidney.... - Yes, sir? Hasn't Santa Claus brought the elephant yet? Not yet, sir, but he, she-- It may be here at any moment, sir. - You didn't buy an elephant? - I did. - A live elephant, Daddy? - A great big, live elephant. I beg your pardon, sir, madam. In behalf of the help, and as their spokesman... ...I wish to express our thanks for your thoughtfulness and generosity... ...and to wish you a very merry Christmas. - Thank you. - That's very nice, Sidney. And may we wish a very merry Christmas to all of you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam. Merry Christmas. And to you, Miss Patricia. Same to you, Sidney. Now, how about opening your presents? With all this extravagance, I'm a little afraid to. Nonsense, darling, that's what Christmas is for. Come on, now. - Oh, Flo. - Now. - This isn't all for me? - Well, who else? - I don't know which one to open first. - Well, suppose you try this one. Oh, Flo! A crown of diamonds. How beautiful. This proves that America is not a republic. Because you are the queen, and queens always wear crowns. A bracelet for the regal wrist. A pendant for the royal throat. - And.... - Flo! A cloak for Her Majesty's shoulders. - Darling! - And.... - Oh, no, Flo. Nothing else! - Yes. A kiss from her most humble subject. Darling! Oh, everything's so lovely. - But you shouldn't have done so much. - Oh, well, I.... I hadn't anything to do with it. It was Santa Claus. He brought everything. Yes, I know, but Santa Claus was far too extravagant. You should take some of it back. Oh, Mama, I don't want Santa Claus to take back any of my presents. Don't worry, he won't. No, and he won't take back any of your mama's either. I'd cry if he took my circus back. - You would? - Why, darling? - You like it better than your other presents? - But I wish it was a real, live circus. Well, I guess you'll have to do a circus, Flo. Could you, Daddy? Well, I don't know. Let's see. I've never had any experience with circuses. But I can try. I'll tell you what. Let's make a chorus in front of these two wagons. Who's this fellow? That's the ringmaster in the center, where a ringmaster should be. Now, we'll put these two acrobats up next to him... ...then we'll put this Tyrollean fellow there. Put the clown next to him. He's a funny fellow, and there's the lion-tamer. Gosh, I bet he's a brave fellow too. And there's the drum major. And here is the strongman. We'll call him Sandow. - And who is this? - Well, that's.... Oh! Of course. That's little Harriet Hoctor. I've always wanted to give her a chance. I'll tell you what. Now, you hold her for a minute, and we'll bring her on later. Now... ...let's put it all back of a curtain, just as I do in the theater. Now, this is the curtain. - What's the laugh, Jack? - This article on Ziegfeld. Says he's broke and can't borrow a nickel from any bank. He wouldn't have to borrow if he'd commercialized. He'd never send out a number two company. He wanted the public to see his best production. Why doesn't he stick to his Follies? That other show is terrible. - Guess the old boy's washed-up. - He's been slipping for years. - White and Carroll have got it all over him. - Bob.... Let me have a cold towel, will you? Well, the guy's getting old. Yeah, and broke. He won't have another hit on Broadway. - Isn't someone making a theater for him? - Yeah. It's to be his monument. It's about time. He could use a monument. - I don't know you fellows. - You got nothing on me. I don't know you. You ought to. You've been burying me for five minutes. I'm Ziegfeld. You're right. I'm not gonna have another hit on Broadway. I'm gonna have four. Four at one time. You get that? Four! And all hits. Oh, Mr. Ziegfeld! You forgot your tie. He's gonna have four hits, and he hasn't got a tie left. Flo. Darling. Why did you come upstairs without saying hello? Are you trying to elude me? Well, I'm not feeling very well, dear. Poor darling. You're just tired. Where's your tie? What do you think of that? I.... I must have left it in the barbershop this afternoon. And you've been around without it ever since? Darling, that isn't like you. What's wrong, Flo? Billie, I'm all through. - Through with what? - Everything. I'm slipping. I'm... ...getting old. And who told you that? - Three men in the barbershop. - That's why you forgot your tie. Yes, I've never done anything like that in my whole life. Isn't that tragic? For the first time in your long career, you forgot a tie. It's a calamity. - Who were those men, Flo? - I don't know. I never saw them before. They said I'd never produce another hit. And what did you say? I told them I'd have four on Broadway at the same time. - Sounds more like you. - Yeah, but it was only a bluff. I'm sorry, dear. I don't mean to worry you. Where's Patricia? She's having her dinner. - You came home very late, dear. - Yes, dear. I'm sorry. I.... I've been so worried. The play is such a terrible failure. But you're not, darling. Afraid I am. - Well, shall we have some dinner? - Flo. I'm disappointed in you. I didn't think you'd ever lose confidence in yourself. But I must be the failure, not you. - Oh, Billie. - No, I mean it, darling. Before we were married... ...you never thought of failure even when you were broke. It was your sublime superiority more than anything else... ...that made me admire you so much. Please don't change, Flo. Don't let Patricia and me become a worry to you. We don't expect you to reduce your life to just us. I want you to go right on being just as you always were. I would never be jealous... ...because with your love of beauty, you could never be cheap or common. So in whatever you do... ...you need never fear me. And what is more important... ...don't be afraid of yourself. I'm not gonna be afraid, Billie. All right, young man. I'll give you a chance to prove it. In my vault, I have all the jewelry you've ever given me... ...even the queen's crown... ...and some very good bonds. They're all yours... ...on one condition. That you keep your promise to those three men and have four hits on Broadway. - Is that a bargain? - Oh, Billie. Mr. Ziegfeld. Just a minute. Mr. Ziegfeld, it's Police Inspector Doyle. He says it's important. - Why didn't you say so? Send him in. - All right. All right, Mr. Doyle. Mr. Ziegfeld. Hello, inspector. - We got them, all right. - You did? That's wonderful. It is wonderful, with the descriptions you gave us. - Where are they? - Right outside. - Bring them in. - All right, sir. Bring those birds in here. - Here they are. - What's going on? - Pipe down, pipe down. - What's the charge against these men? - Murder. - Murder? Yes, murder. About a year ago, these three gentlemen killed me and buried me. - Killed? Buried? - Yes. In a Times Square barbershop. - Remember? - Oh, yes, I remember. Don't you? Now, I'm going to give each of you a box to all four of my shows. Four hits, all in one season. And then I want you to tell me whether or not you still think I'm washed-up. I'm sorry, but this is the only way I could locate you. I knew that if you were to be found at all, Inspector Doyle was the one to do it. Sam, have Goldie take their reservations for whatever nights they wish. - Good day, gentlemen. - This way. - Thank you. - That's getting even with a vengeance. That's not a bad ending for a practical joke, is it? Goldie, take these gentlemen's names and addresses. Don't you realize what you may have let yourself in for? - What? - They can sue you for false arrest. - And the police department. - Don't you realize we have nothing... - ...to worry about anymore? - I hope so. No need to hope. You know what I've been doing? - What? - Buying stocks. I've bought over a million. - Outright? - No, on margin. But all solid securities. When I've paid for them, I'm gonna buy another million and another. - Sam, I'm going to be really rich. - I hope you're right, sir. But the market's been behaving very queerly these last few days. - Yes? - Croydon & Company on the phone. - Put them on. - Been trying to get you. They're my broker. Hello? Speaking. Oh. Well, what happened? Down 20 to 40 points? How much? - Three hundred thousand?! - What is it? Oh, no, no, no! Don't do that! I'll cover. I'll get the money to you in just a little while. - Will you put Holloway on the phone? - Flo, what is it? The market, Sam, it's crashed. I've got to get $300,000 in cash, immediately. - How are we gonna do it? - I don't know. - Maybe I could borrow it from a bank. - On what? On your shows. It's too late. I've already mortgaged the shows for the first payments on the stock. What's that? But you've got to locate him! Yes, I'll cover. I'll get the money to you in a while. Just hold the wire. - Sam, get Billings. - Yes, sir. Try his house, his office, anywhere, but get Billings! Mr. Nagus, we haven't received your check, and your margin's wiped out. Hello, Mr. Billings. I'll be right with you. No, we can't, Mr. Nagus. I'm sorry, but we can't hold your stocks any longer. Mr. Billings, we've had to sell you out too. Well, that takes me back to my second childhood consistently. I was a poor kid when I started. - Mr. Ziegfeld's on number six for you. - Excuse me, Mr. Billings. Hello? Oh, yes, Mr. Ziegfeld. Yes, we had to sell you out about half an hour ago. Yes. I know it is, and I'm terribly sorry. - I didn't know Ziegfeld was in the market. - Yes, very heavy. - He'll lose everything. - Everything? Everything. Well, this is one time he can't get it from me. Yes, madam. Yes, madam, it is. The doctor left about 10 minutes ago, madam. He seemed very happy about Mr. Ziegfeld. Said he might stay up for a while longer. Oh, he did so enjoy sitting up to dinner with you and Miss Patricia. - No, madam. - But don't let him stay up too long. Yes, I know, but the more he rests, the sooner he'll be well again. And tell him I'll be home immediately after the performance. - It's time for your entrance, Miss Burke. - Yes, yes. Sidney, be sure to call me right after the second act. Yes, about 10:05. Yes, madam. Madam was very happy about you, sir. Oh, my poor Billie. I wish she weren't working. But it does help some, Sidney. - Get those wires off as quickly as you can. - Yes, sir. Were you able to reach Eddie Cantor by phone? The Los Angeles operator's been trying for some time, sir. Tell her to keep on trying. - Sidney? - Yes, sir? When you get him... ...tell him that I want him for a new show. Tell him I'll start rehearsals the instant he can get away from those pictures. Tell him I need him. - I haven't had a real show in two years. - Yes, sir. - Wasn't that the bell, Sidney? - Yes, sir. Well, why don't you answer it. Yes, sir. - Mr. Billings. - Hello, Sidney. How's Mr. Ziegfeld? Well, he's much improved, sir, but he's very nervous. He will be glad to see you, sir. If we could get him started on a new show, sir. - Yeah. - I mean to say, if he had the money, sir. Yes, well, we'll see that he gets it. My valet isn't as efficient as you used to be, Sidney. He lets me neglect things. All right for me to see him? - Yes, sir. I wouldn't stay too long. - No, no, no. Well, hello, Ziggy. How are you feeling? Hello, Jack. I'm feeling much better. - Thank you. Sit down, won't you? - Yes. Let me look at you. I don't think you've been sick. Just playing possum so your creditors can't find you. No. No creditors. No. No creditors. - When are you gonna be up and around? - Well... - ...pretty soon now, I hope. - Hurry up. I'm expecting you to go to Europe with me. Oh. Well, when are you sailing? In a couple of weeks. We'll stop off at Monte Carlo. You can break the bank again. And then we'll go to London. Maybe we can find some new talent together. Does it interest you? Yes. Yes, I'd like to go to London. Yeah? Why? - You got someone in mind? - No. - Why, have you? - No. But I wouldn't tell you if I had, not if you were 10 times as sick as you are. Oh, those were great old days, Jack. Yeah. Remember the fair? Do I. Little Egypt. - Sandow. - Yeah, and then Anna Held. Yes. Oh, I'm sorry, Ziggy. Why is it, Jack, that in a world so old... ...life must be so short? Short? I feel as if I'd been here 1000 years. And I'm gonna stay 1000 more. And you'd feel the same way if you'd snap out of it and get a new show started. Yes. Yes, I'd like to do another Follies. Why don't you do it. Don't you think it's about time that you and I split 50-50 in something? I'd love to, Jack. But it'll take a lot of money. I've never refused you before, have I? No, but... ...that was all in the dark ages. Before the Depression, I mean. - I heard that the market got you. - Me? Why, I.... Don't be silly. I'm too smart for any stock market. Oh, I lost a couple of thousand or so, but I got out in time. - Really? - Yeah. How about you? Did it get you? Oh, no. No, I.... I never played the market. Oh, I may have dropped a few hundred, maybe... ...but nothing to speak of. Well, how much money do you suppose it'll take, Ziggy? - A couple of hundred thousand. - A couple of hundred thousand? Well, okay, it's a deal. Pull yourself together, get well, and I'll give you money. Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Ziegfeld? Doesn't that make you feel better, sir? Yes, that makes me feel much better. Jack... ...you're a real person. Yeah, well, you're.... You're not a bad sort yourself, Ziggy. Well, I'll drop in tomorrow. Yes. Do that. And, Ziggy, if you just put your mind to it, I think you'll be up and around in a week. Don't let me rush you, because while you're here convalescing... ...I'll be picking out the gals for the new show. - Well, he looks all right to me, Sidney. - Undoubtedly he will be, sir. Thanks to you. I hope so. Take good care of him, Sidney. Because if anything happened to Ziggy, I.... Well, take good care of him. Mr. Ziegfeld. Mr. Ziegfeld. I wouldn't tax my strength if I were you, sir. Sidney... ...I've got things to do. I must get Cantor, Bill Rogers, Bill Fields. They must come back to me! I'll have all my old stars together in one great show. I must do the biggest Follies of my whole life! I.... Oh, Sidney, I'm so terribly broke. But Mr. Billings, sir, isn't he going to help you? Sidney, he hasn't a nickel. He was lying to me just to make me feel better. We're both broke. I wouldn't worry about that, sir. You've been broke before, sir. Yes, I know. I've always laughed about it. But I can't laugh anymore, Sidney... ...because I've been wrong. I've got nothing. Nothing to leave anyone. Nothing, sir? You leave them the memories... ...of the finest things ever done on the stage, sir. You'll leave them a name that they can be proud of all their lives. You'll soon feel better... ...and then you can do more beautiful things than ever before, sir. It's nice of you, Sidney, to say that. I must call madam again now, sir. It's after 10. The memories... ...of the finest things ever done on the stage. Chicory 5161. Hello? Get me Miss Burke's dressing room, please. Yes. Oh, Miss Burke. He seems to be resting comfortably. Yes, I thought you'd like to know. Yes, Miss Burke. Yes, I'll deliver your message. Mr. Ziegfeld. Mr. Z-- Hello. Is Dr. Hassel still in the building, please? Would you ask him to come up to Mr. Ziegfeld's apartment at once? Yes. Hurry, please. I've got to have more steps. I need more steps. I've got to get higher. Higher. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Darling, l've got Lord and Lady Ferncliffe. They'll come to dinner next Friday. l just had a radio from them on the boat. Wasn't that brilliant of me, getting the Ferncliffes? Yes, that was very brilliant of you, if you want the Ferncliffes. But l do. You remember them, darling. They entertained us in London. l remember them well, and very dull it was, too. Australian mutton... and a lot of people who'd been buried for years... and got up just to eat that mutton. You don't realize how important it is, Oliver. Everybody will be after them. l thought you and Ferncliffe had lots in common. lsn't he interested in shipping, too? Mr. Oliver Jordan accepts. Of course, it's terribly short notice. Thank you, Gustave. Let's see. Lord and Lady Ferncliffe... the Talbots: the Doctor and Lucy. l saw that your precious Carlotta Vance arrived on the Europa yesterday. Carlotta? Fine, let's have her. Of course, she goes with a different crowd than the Ferncliffes over there. All those impossible fast people. At her age, too. Nonsense. Carlotta has no age. Oliver, just because she was once your favorite actress. Dad, l thought you'd gone. Well, if it isn't her ladyship. Don't look at me, l'm a sight. Didn't sleep a wink. l thought l heard you moving around in your room. Couldn't you sleep, either? - Nerves? - l don't know. l suppose so. Say, pips, there isn't anything really wrong, is there? Now, how can the shipping business go on if the owner's tie isn't straight? Paula, l'll want you and Ernest for dinner next Friday. When does his boat land? l don't know, Mother. You don't know? Aren't you being awfully vague about your fianc? l certainly hope Ernest is more excited about this wedding than you seem to be. And don't forget, we're going shopping this afternoon. l can't this afternoon, Mother. l'm sorry. But you've got to. You've simply got to. Do you realize you're being married in a month... and you haven't got a stitch of trousseau? Why can't you go shopping with me this afternoon? - l've an engagement. - What engagement? l'm going to a concert. A concert. That reminds me. When Cousin Hattie comes in this morning... l want to give her our Philharmonic seats for Thursday. Whom are you going to the concert with? Hello. Dr. Talbot's residence? Mrs. Talbot, please. Mrs. Oliver Jordan calling. Paula, what concert.... Lucy? How are you, my dear? Listen, Lucy. Lord and Lady Ferncliffe arrive from London tomorrow... and l want you and Wayne a week from tonight. Yes, dinner at 8:00. - Mr. Jordan's late. - He probably stopped at the dock. - Where'd you put those invoices? - What invoices? For the Castilian. What's the hurry? She's not sailing till tomorrow. Good morning, Mr. Jordan. Good morning. lt's cold outside. - Why, l thought it was real pleasant. - Not down on the dock. - Cold down there, all right. - Yes. Just a minute. The Castilian isn't going to sail tomorrow. - What? - Not sailing? No use sending a boat out without enough cargo in her... to keep her down in the water. My, my. No Jordan boat has missed a trip in 60 years. l know that. Will the Santa Clara sail next week? Cheer up, Fosdick. lt's just as good a line as it ever was. The best in the world. Right you are. Some other people think so, too. Wish l knew who it was that's trying to buy up our stock. You're not going to lose control of the line, Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan, your father, your grandfather-- No. Of course not. And we're going to put up a fight they wouldn't be ashamed of, either. And the first step in that. Did you get ahold of Mr. Packard? - He's coming in this morning. - Good. Mr. Jordan, Miss Carlotta Vance is here to see you. Carlotta? Here? Outside? Oliver! Ducky! l never was so glad to see anyone in all my life. Carlotta, this is a surprise. Why, you look marvellous. Do l? l do, don't l? Divine. Oliver, actually, you're looking handsomer than ever. - A little gray. - Gray? Nonsense! Distinguished. Come on over and sit down. - Oliver.... - Let me look at you. What are you doing over here? Trying to mend my shattered fortune. You picked a nice day for it. ln the right part of town, too. There are our financiers sitting on those benches out there. Now, come along, Carlotta. Who did you come down to the Battery to see? Not me. No, sir. l'll not deceive you. l came down here to see the United States Customs lnspector. lsador J. Greenbaum, the son of a.... Say, why shouldn't l own six fur coats? Why not, indeed? lt's perfectly reasonable. And when l was standing in the Customs office, what did l sight? ''Jordan Line.'' Says l to myself, says l, ''Maybe the old gentleman is in.'' And here you are. l'm very grateful to Mr. Greenbaum. Oliver, l'm as flat as a millpond. l haven't got a sou. Carlotta, go along with you. What about all those gilt-edged securities and your theater? That alone ought to bring you enough to live on. My chief reason for coming to this country is to get rid of that rattrap. What's the matter with it? For six months, they haven't taken the lock off the door. lt's now known as the ''spiders' rendezvous.'' Can't collect rent from them. When old Starfield gave me that theater... l thought it was very magnificent of the old boy. Now l wish l'd taken a sandwich. Lotta, you always exaggerated. l bet you're rolling in wealth. What have l got? Railroads, oil, cotton. That's what they gave you in my day. l only could take what they had. And you know what's happened to those things. You are down to cases. ''lnternational star returns to stage.'' Never. l'll have my double chins in privacy. l've seen too many hardened arteries dragged out to make a first-night holiday. Oh, no. Now, Carlotta, your stock must bring you in a little something. lt can't cost you an awful lot to live over there. No? You saw how it was like at Antibes. You and Millicent. 10 and 20 for luncheon, cocktails. Most of them staying on for dinner. Very same thing at my house in London. Everybody popping in. Noel, Winston, and once in a while, Wales. l didn't do so badly for a little girl from Quincy, lllinois, eh, ducky? But it all takes money. Why don't you get rid of all that, live over here for a while? l've been in New York four days, the first time l've been back in 10 years... and l'm lost already. No, everything's changed. l couldn't stand it here. l'd die. l belong to the Delmonico period. Table at the window looking out on Fifth Avenue. Boxes with flowers, and pink lampshades... string orchestra and l don't know.... Yes. Willow plumes, lnverness capes... dry champagne and snow on the ground. They don't even have snow anymore. - Pardon me, Mr. Jordan. - Miss Copeland? - Mr. Eton is outside. He wants to see you. - l'll go and see him. Will you pardon me a minute, Lotta? Let me get that for you. Thank you, my dear. Miss Vance, l.... l just want to.... l hope you won't mind... but l can't help telling you how exciting it is seeing you right here. How sweet. l shall never forget it. l saw you when you played in Trelawney. You were wonderful. Yes. That was the last thing l did. Yes. l remember it as plainly as if it was yesterday... though l was only a little girl at the time. How extraordinary. - lt's wonderful seeing you like this. - Yes, it is. You know, we must have a nice talk about the Civil War sometime... just you and l. l got rid of him. What do you think about me selling my Jordan stock? l'd rather you didn't, just at this time. We've been hit, just as everyone has, of course. l'm afraid you wouldn't get what it was worth if you sold it now. l'd expect to lose something on it. But you know, ladies must live. You see, Carlotta, it's like this. The Jordan stock has never really been on the market. As a matter of fact, it's very closely held. Only six or seven people in all. Of course, you've got a very small block of it. Let's see, what did you pay for it anyway, do you remember? Why, Carlotta, you're marvellous. No. l remember because it's the only stock l ever paid for myself. But then you said it was good. And yes, it was for nearly 20 years. The last two or three or.... Oliver, you wouldn't want to buy it back yourself, would you? Yes, l would, Carlotta. But l'd find it rather difficult just now. Why, Oliver... l always thought of you having all the money in the world. l thought so, too, for a time. When l think of Oliver Jordan lll.... l dropped that years ago. Dear Oliver, you were sweet. So serious. So respectful. l was very fond of you, Oliver. l was very much in love with you, Carlotta. You were the most entrancing creature in the world, and l was at your feet. So was all New York. lf you went to a restaurant, it was made. lf you wore a certain hat, it became the rage. l was rather gorgeous, wasn't l? Remember? They named everything after me. Cigars, race horses... perfumes, battleships. They were a little previous on that. But one thing l shall always remember. The day you were 21 ... you asked me to marry you, Oliver. What a young fool you must have thought me. No, l thought it very sweet of you. You see, l was 30-ish. l remember l went home and wept a little. They didn't often ask me to marry them. You broke my heart when you refused me, Carlotta. So l buried my grief in the shipping business. Dear Oliver. Mr. Packard is here now. Tell him to come right in. Do you mind, Carlotta? He's quite a fellow, Dan Packard. Used to be a miner. Big Western stuff, you know. How interesting. l'd like to meet him. All right, Mr. Packard. That's no elevator, that's a birdcage. Jordan, what kind of a dump is this, anyway? l beg your pardon. Dan Packard. This is Miss Carlotta Vance. - Miss Vance. - How do you do? Wait a minute. Not Carlotta Vance? Yes. Why, l know you. Jordan, you old son of a gun, you. Yes. Saw me when he was a boy. Nursie held him up so he'd get a good look. Your picture was on the wall of every mining shack up there in Montana... right alongside of John L. Sullivan. Sutton's Opera House. What was the name of that piece you were in? You wore pants. Still do. That's my exit cue. When will l see you, Lotta? Soon? Millicent called me up this morning. l'm dining with you next week, Friday. Fine, of course. l'm just dying to see Paula again. l'm sure she's crazy to see you. You were so sweet to her when she was in London last year. But where are you staying? l'm stopping at the Hotel Versailles. The old Versailles. -O-O-O-O'Brien. -That's it. Goodbye. Toodly-oo, Lochinvar. What did she call me? Sit down, Dan. - How've you been? - Just fine. l can only stay a minute. Running down to Washington. Seems like the President wants to get down at the bottom of things. The reason l asked you to come over, Dan, was l wanted to put something up to you. Sure. Go ahead. lt's about the Jordan Line. Say, who put up this building, Peter Stuyvesant? Looks more like a museum than an office. lt was the last word when the old gentleman built it. lt's been like this for 75 years. l hope those old tubs of yours don't date to this office. What do you got on your mind? You know all about our business. l don't need to go into that. Of course, this Depression isn't going to last forever. But if it takes a little longer than we figure... l want to know if you and your associates... would be in a position to sort of tide us over. l appreciate that l'd have to turn over some of my holdings to you. l'd rather not disturb the other stockholders. l don't know anything about your business, Jordan. But it looks to me like it's gone to seed. All l have to do is look around this office. To tell you the truth, l don't think you have much to offer. Now, look here, Packard. Our ships have traveled the ocean for a century. We started from clipper ships. We're not going to stop. We're not through. l'm sorry, Jordan. l didn't mean anything. You know, l'm a businessman, and everybody's bothering you. - l apologize, Jordan. - That's all right. Now, l may be wrong. Tell you what you do. You get me some figures on this thing: the assets, the stockholders, a list of them, and the holdings.... You submit it to me, l'll give you an answer within 24 hours. That's very kind of you. - What's the matter? Got a pain? - Oh, no. - lt's a little indigestion. - lndigestion? Half a lemon. l get it all the time. Half a lemon in hot water. l got to travel, l'm in a hurry. You send me all the dope. l'll do whatever l can. So long. Mr. Jordan, l wouldn't trust that man as far as l could throw a bull by the tail. l hope you're wrong. l hope we're both wrong. Why, what's the matter, sir? l'm all right. Hello. Mrs. Jordan, sir. Hello, dear. Oliver? Darling, l'm simply out of my mind. l'm still shy one couple, and l just can't find an extra man. What am l going to do, dear? You can do something for me, dear. You can invite Dan Packard and his wife. You're joking. Ask that common little woman to my house? And that noisy, vulgar man? He smells Oklahoma. Oh, no, they're not as bad as that. Anyway, it would be an enormous favor to me if you did. Of course, if it will help you, dear. Hattie, you can't imagine. Hattie just came in, dear. Maybe she can help. But do try to think of an extra man, won't you, dear? l will, dear. Goodbye. Those Packards. Really. Another dinner party? Only a small one, darling. Otherwise, l'd love to have you and Ed, you understand? No need to apologize. A cousin is a cousin. And Ed hates functions. Ed hates anything that keeps him from going to the movies every night. l guess l'm what's called ''a Garbo widow.'' Hello? Who is it? Mrs. who? Jordan? Mrs. Oliver Jordan. Just a minute. Who's that on the telephone? A Mrs. Oliver Jordan wants to speak to you on the phone. - Who? - Mrs. Jordan. - Mrs. Oliver Jordan? - Yes. Holy cat! Hand me that telephone, you nitwit. Hello, Mrs. Jordan. Of course l remember you. l've seen you at the races. Mr. Jordan and l are giving a small dinner for Lord and Lady Ferncliffe... two very dear friends of mine from England. Gee, that sounds swell to me. lt's awful nice of you to ask us, Mrs. Jordan. We'll be glad to accept. Goodbye. Don't you want to know the date? Sure, honey. Friday, a week from tonight. Dinner at 8:00. Thanks. Goodbye for real this time, Mrs. Jordan. Tina, get my engagement book. lt's around here somewhere. Take this down. Next Friday evening... at the Oliver Jordans', dinner at 8:00. Me eating with Lord and Lady Ferncliffe. You don't have to write that down, stupid. Listen, Tina. Don't crack about this to Mr. Packard. l want to spring it on him at the right time. That slug never wants to meet any refined people. Clear that away, Tina. Wait a minute! What did Dr. Talbot say? What time's he coming? He didn't say exactly. He asked, ''Was there any symptoms?'' And l said, ''No, l didn't think so.'' He said, all right then, he'd be over sometime today. l got a cold, and my legs ache all over. - You didn't tell me to say that. - You should have known it. - Here's your new hat. - Goody. Higher, you fool. - Don't it look cute? - Swell. Tell Oscar to pack. Just overnight stuff, that's all. You in bed again? What's the matter? l don't feel good. What's the idea of the hat? Going out? What do you eat all that sweet stuff for? Why don't you get up and do something? You don't care what l do or how l feel. Look at me. l was never sick a day in my life, and why? lt's because l do things and get out and get to moving. Oscar, l don't want any dinner clothes. That's the reason. Dr. Talbot says that you're an extrovert and l'm an introvert. A what? An introvert, you dummy! That's why l've got to be quiet a good deal and have time to reflect in. Reflect in? What have you got to reflect about? l have to think and act at the same time. You know why l'm going to Washington tonight? Because the President wants to consult me about the affairs of the nation. - That's why. - What's the matter with them? Everything's the matter with them. That's why he's sending for me. You know, l wouldn't be a bit surprised but what he offered me a Cabinet job. What do you know about that? Where'd that buffer get to? You ought to be married to some of the guys l see. They'd give you something to reflect about. l called on a fellow this morning who can't handle one little business... and l juggle 50 things at once, and he doesn't handle one. Here's the blowoff. He's got the layout l've been looking for, for two years... and the sap lays it right in my lap. Dan Packard owns the best shipping line between here and the tropics... and Mr. Oliver Jordan is out on his ear. We're invited there for dinner next Friday night... and l'm going to wear my new silver with the white fox. - We're not going. That's out. - How do you get that way? - Why not? - l can't go and eat his dinner. lf he's a sucker, that's his funeral. No. Presidents in Washington and all those rummies... but you can't go anywheres with me. Once in our life, we get asked to a classy house. l got a new dress to knock their eye out and we're going! - We're not going! - We are so, you big crook! You pull a dirty deal and it ruins my social chances! - You can't get away with it! - Go lay an egg. Danny.... Kitty wants to go see all the great big lords and ladies... in their big, beautiful house. lt's for Lord and Lady Ferncliffe. - Who said so? - She did. Why didn't you say so in the first place? Because you were mean to poor little Kitty. Ferncliffe, you know who he is? He's the richest man in England. - Goody, you'll go? - Certainly l'll go. l've been trying to meet him for two years. That ties up with the Jordan stuff. - See, and l did it for you. - You know what l'll do? l'll buy up that Jordan stock through dummies. l'll use Baldridge and Whitestone, fellows like that. - Keep my name out of it. - Out of what? Dr. Talbot's come. Good. He'll take care of you all right. Ferncliffe. What a break. - Goodbye, kitten. See you tomorrow. - That's fine, goodbye. Come on, Oscar, let's go. Tina, quick, get me that other jacket, the one with the fur. Hurry up, you nitwit! Clear the things off the bed and fix it up a bit. Tina, leave me my book. You know, the fat one that Dr. Talbot gave me. lt says Aspects of the Adult Mind. - Here it is. - Leave it here. Now, show the doctor in. Well, what's this? Hello, Doctor. l just ran into your husband downstairs. He tells me he's going to see the President. Yes, he's going to help him fix things. What's wrong with the little lady? Doctor, l don't know. l kind of ached all over and felt funny and.... You got to be careful of the flu, and l thought maybe if l stayed in bed.... You never come and see me anymore unless l send for you. Now listen, Kitty, l've been very busy. But l'm so lonely for you, Wayne. You know how l need you. l don't do anything all day except just long for you. Why don't you try and read? l know. You're tired of me. - No, l'm not, honey, but you know - Wayne, darling! Look at you, quivering with pride. Just 'cause you're going to be ate tonight by Lord and Lady what's his name. The aspic. - lt's too divine, Mrs. Wendel. - Thank you, ma'am. lt was the only thing l was worried about. No, l think that's better, Mrs. Wendel. What is it, The Wreck of the Hesperus? lt's the British lion in honor of Lord Ferncliffe. lt will just make the dinner. lsn't that Aunt Emma's vegetable dish? Yes, isn't it lovely? - This just came, Mrs. Jordan. - Thank you, Dora. l can still remember when a telegram always meant bad news. - Good heavens! - You see? Freddy Hope, my extra man, he's got pneumonia. Of all the thoughtless, selfish.... On the day of my dinner, too. What am l going to do? Why do anything? l never could understand why it has to be just even, male and female. They're invited for dinner, not for mating. l don't know where to find someone who'll fit in with the Ferncliffes. Nothing but a rubber plant would fit in with the Ferncliffes. Why don't you get an actor for Carlotta? - An actor? - A movie star. Aren't there any movie stars around? l've got it. Larry Renault. He'd be too marvelous. - l wonder if he's still in town. - He was in town yesterday. Ed, the movie hound, read me an interview with him in last night's Telegram. He's leaving pictures and going into a play. And he knows Carlotta. We met him at her place in Antibes three years ago. He was a sensation. The girls fighting to get into his car. And on the beach... well, my dear, he wore even less than the girls. Ed says he isn't so hot since the talkies. You can't fool Ed about the pictures. He remembers John Bunny and Francis X. Bushman, Henry B. Walthall. l don't suppose he'd even remember me. l wonder where he's stopping. - The Versailles, that's where he is. - That's where Carlotta's staying. - Are you sure? - Yes. l remember the whole interview. He was wearing a two-piece dark-blue flannel lounging suit... with a cunning white monogram on his upper pocket. Let's see, l'll put him between Carlotta and the Packard woman. See if you can get him first, and let nature take its course. l do hope he's free for tonight. ''Free, white, and 45,'' Ed says. l'll say this for him. ln his photographs, he has the most heavenly profile. - Hello. Mr. Renault, please. - Good luck, dear. Hello, Mr. Renault? This is Millicent Jordan. l don't suppose you'd remember me. Antibes? Yes, of course l do. How do you do, Mrs. Jordan? Dinner, tonight? Let me see. l'm afraid that possibly l can't. You see.... l have another engagement, of course... but l might be able to break it. And Paula, my daughter, you know, she'll be so glad to see you again. l don't suppose you'd remember her at Antibes? Of course, dear lady. lt sounds like a very amusing evening. l shall certainly try to come. At 8:00? Thanks very much. - What do you know about that? - Darling, please, you must come. l don't know. l'd feel kind of like a heel. Larry, please. lt will be such fun. To be at dinner with you in my own house. Darling, they aren't so stuffy, really. - They'd be crazy about you. - Sure. l mean.... - You know - And, darling... while l was dressing for dinner, l could be thinking ''Larry will be here.'' Darling, it's so awful not to be with you every minute. What? l'm awfully jealous of the play. Are you really going to act in it? My agent's bringing Baumann up here this afternoon. l might as well sign the contract. Baumann's as good a producer as there is, l suppose. l'll have to sit in the audience... and watch you make love to another woman. l hope it flops. That's what l hope. The play is not much. But l think l can put it over. l play the only male character. Not another man? There's a small male part for a bit actor. - He's a beachcomber. - A beachcomber? Yeah. He has one small scene, but l dominate that. l love you so. May l use your comb? - Where have you been all this time? - Came as quick as l could. Wait a minute. Where is my change? Had to go to a new place. Cost half a dollar more. Who told you to go to a new.... - A little drink. - Any reason why l shouldn't? No, of course not. Except, at Mother's tonight... l want them to see you at your best. Larry, don't. Paula, mind your own business, will you? - Don't talk to me like that. - l'll do as l please. - Darling, let's not quarrel. - l'm sorry. l'm kind of on edge today, deciding about this play... and everything. lt's my fault. l'm a little jumpy myself. Ernest gets back from abroad this evening. Ernest? Will he be there at your mother's? Poor Ernest. l'm awfully sorry for him. He's so sweet. l can't understand yet what's happened. Less than a month ago, l thought l was in love with him. You were one of those million-dollar movie stars. - Paula, l want to tell you something - l know. Ernest is just the sort of young man l should marry. And you're the sort that girls are always warned against. l don't give a hoot what people say. l know all the things you've done. l know how many times you've been married. - l'm still married. - l don't care. l'm sick of hiding my love for you. l'm sick of scheming and pretending. Do you think l can go on with Ernest? After all we've been to each other? You don't know anything about me. - You've known me a month. - Larry, how can you? A month. As though time were important. lt is important. There are other things important. You're a kid of 19. You're 19 and l'm 47.... l'm almost 40. You'll be telling me next l'm not old enough to know the facts of life. You don't. Not the real facts. You can't. Everything has been too easy for you. You don't know what it means to be up against it. Keep fighting them every second. To pull yourself up, hand over hand... while they're waiting with a knife to cut the rope. l'm not through yet. l'll show them. lf they think l'm finished.... Larry, make sense. What's that got to do with our love? Love. You want to know the truth, Paula? l love you. As much as l can love any woman. But it isn't real love anymore. There have been too many. l've been in love a hundred times. l've had three wives. - You want to know about them? - No. There was Violet. She was a vaudeville hoofer. Rooming houses, dirty kimonos, fried-egg sandwiches. We fought like wildcats. Then l broke into pictures and l left her. Then l married Edith. She was crazy about my profile. Always kept talking about it. She was society. We were happy for about six months. Then Hollywood dazzled her. You know what happened. Out in her car one night, drunk as the devil... over the cliff. Were you in love with her? As for Marcelle, you know about her. She's the top of the heap now. Biggest draw of any woman in pictures. Ambitious. l've never known any woman like her. She'd do anything to get along, and knife me to get there. Always telling me someday she'd be bigger than l was... and now l'm.... There they are, the three of them. l won't tell you about the others. They swarmed on me. Every age, kind, and description. What do you want with me? l love you. You're young and fresh, and l'm burned out. This is the first decent thing l ever did in my life. You listen to what l'm telling you. l won't listen. l love you. lt's no use, Larry. Nothing you can say will make any difference. l'm going to tell Mother and Dad and Ernest... - and l'm going to tell them tonight. - l tell you you're not! That's Mac, my agent. - Paula, l want you to promise me. - No! For the love of heaven, Paula. lt's no use, Larry. My mind's made up. Don't you ever get up? You know my agent, Mr. Kane? Miss Jordan. - Sure. How is the little lady? - Splendid, thank you. You? Top of the bottle. Am l butting in? Not at all. l was just going. Goodbye. Pearls in your oysters. Paula, please think of what l've said. Oh, dear. - Goodbye, Larry. - Goodbye. - Paula. - l must, Larry. Now, aren't you ashamed? For 15 minutes, l walk you around the block so you.... And then you come right in here.... Momsy's sorry. She doesn't give a darn for the old man's carpet. No, l'm awfully sorry. How is the great profile today? You been out or sticking around here? No. l didn't feel very well. l slept rather late. l'm going out to dinner. Why don't you go up to McDermott's and get a workout every day? Get yourself in shape. What is this, cinnamon toast? l'll be all right. As soon as l get into rehearsal, l'll get into shape. Sure, just keep on with that. That'll fix you up. Did you see Baumann? l thought perhaps he'd come up here with you. Baumann? No. He didn't come up. Did he give you the contract? Look, Larry... l got some disappointing news for you, kind of. What's the matter? You know how these managers are. This way, that way. You never know when you got them. Well.... For the love of.... Come out with it. l'm telling you. l go in to see Baumann this afternoon. He's sitting there, a face down to here. l start talking about the play. What does he do? He tells me he's got to go south for a month. He's sick. What does that mean? There you are. He's got to go south. You can't do a play when you're south. But he's got to do it. lt was all settled. lt was talked over, but it wasn't really.... You know. Unless you get it down in that old black and white.... Even then sometimes it's no good. We'll take it away from him. There are other producers. The cheap crook. Sure. Baumann's no good. That's how he got where he is. But that's not the point. What does he do? He goes and he turns the play over to this Joe Stengel. l rather like the idea of going with Stengel. They tell me he does those highbrow plays. lbsen. - ''l want the moon, Mother.'' - Yeah. Now, look Larry. He understands l'm to be starred, of course. - That's just it. - What? Now, look, Larry. Don't blame me. l've been plugging for you for months. What are you trying to tell me? Don't go up in the air about it. There's sure to be something else. You mean l'm out? You dirty double-crosser. Do you mean l'm out? Larry, l'm telling you, nobody knew about this. Nobody. Who's going to play the part? This Cecil Bellamy. That piffling little.... He's English in the first place. The part says ''English Explorer.'' l can be English. English as anybody. l've been waiting six weeks for this play. l could've had a million things. Personal appearances, radio, vaudeville Sure you could. You can get them yet. But the thing for you is a part in a play. You know, get back in that old public eye. Yes, but where's the vehicle? l was thinking about this play again... and you know, Larry, l never said anything... but l never thought that part was so hot for you. You know the part that l'd be crazy to play if l was an actor? - What? - That beachcomber. Beachcomber? You're asking me to go on... and play a part that isn't.... Get out of here. Go on. Get out. Larry, don't make a mistake. Get out before l kick you out. Have it your own way. Wait a minute. Close the door. What makes you think this part isn't right for me? lt's no good. They're going to get tired of him. Now, this beachcomber. He comes on once. Swell scene. He goes off. They keep waiting for him to come back, and he never does. What a part. - Yes, his one scene is very nice. - lt's a pushover. You know what's gonna happen? When that final curtain hits the floor... and what's his name, this Bellamy, when he comes out to take his bows... they're all gonna be yelling, ''Renault! Renault! '' - You think so? - lt's a pushover. l tell you what. l'm going to see Stengel. He's a friend of mine. Wait a minute. Don't let on you talked to me about this. Just tell him maybe you can get me to play it. Leave it to me. l might be able to get Stengel to drop up here as a favor to me. l used to be Joe's office boy. How long you going to be here? A long while. l'm not dining till 8:00. lf l can get him to come up, l'm good. - Goodbye. - Mac. Here's a funny thing. l wonder if you could let me have $5. Taxi fare. l didn't get down to the bank. l'm going to this dinner tonight and what do you suppose l got? Seven cents. lmagine that. Look, l just got enough to go down to the office myself... but l'll bring it to you when l come back. Come in. Can l take the table now? Waiter. lt just occurred to me, l haven't had anything to eat since breakfast. l'm not dining until 8:00. Bring me up a cup of coffee. Good and strong. And l think l'll take a caviar sandwich. Yes, sir. That's all. l'm very sorry, Mr. Renault, but were you going to sign for it? Why? Excuse me, but my orders are... if you sign for it, l cannot serve any more food here. Not serve? Get that order up here at once. l'll speak to the manager. Get it up. Hello? No, l didn't call. Hello. Wait a minute. Yes, l did. Send up a bellboy to go on an errand. Send up Eddie. The one who always goes out for me. There's six in the waiting room. Mr. Jordan wants to know if you'll see him. l suppose so. Did you see Mrs. Talbot? She wanted to talk to you. No, l didn't. Dr. Talbot's office. Who is it, please? Who is it? l'm sorry, but l'll have to have a name. Yes, Mrs. Packard. He's in. Just a minute. Doctor, Mrs. Packard's on your private wire. All right. Hello. Yes. Now, Kitty. Kitty, listen.... Kitty, would you listen a minute? No, l can't come over. These are my office hours, you know that. There's nothing the matter with you. l've been busy. l'll see you tonight at the Jordans'. Of course you can go. Of course l do. l think you're very sweet. No. Of course there's no other woman. Now, Kitty, you're driving me.... Yes, l think you better sleep for an hour and rest... and then take a mild bromide. My office is full of patients now. You must excuse me. No. There's no cause for alarm. Goodbye. Hello, Lucy. Hello, Wayne. How are you, dear? l'm fine. And you? l'm all right. - Anything new? - No. Just the same old thing. What? l mean, unreasonable women patients. Yes. She's not really sick. Women with a lot of time on their hands. l prescribed a sedative, but she doesn't really need anything. How about an apple a day? What's that? Don't bother. What? Don't bother because l know all about it. What are you talking about? Wayne, dear, l'm not going to make a scene. You know l never do, do l? Remember how nicely l behaved about the others? Mrs. Whiting and that Dalrimple girl... and the Ferguson woman, Dolly, and.... Where are your files? You're quite wrong. Now, dear, l knew just when it started. Now she's at the insistent stage. lt's all just a great bore, isn't it, darling? Don't think l don't mind. But l can't let it tear me to pieces the way it did the first time. lt was just before Wayne was born, remember? l thought the world had come to an end. The noble young physician... was just a masher. Surely a little more than that. A great deal more. That's why it's so pathetic. You're two people, really. One's magnificent... and the other's so shoddy. You're right, Lucy. l don't know why you've stayed with me all these years. Because l'm still in love with you. lsn't that funny? You'd think l'd have more pride. l love you, Lucy. lt's never been otherwise. You know what l think? l think you're still a little boy living over on Tenth Avenue... a little bit in awe of the girl from Murray Hill. And that's why, forgive me... these glamorous women in your life... have all been a little common, a little bit Tenth Avenue, too. These other women, why.... lt's like gambling, drinking, or drugs. You just keep on. A habit can be cured if the patient wants to. The patient wants to. Of course, you mustn't stop too suddenly. Lucy, darling, it's you and l. lt's always been you and l, and always will be. Now, you must believe that. Doctor.... l'm sorry. Mr. Oliver Jordan's here, and he seems very ill. Have him come right in. - l'll see you later, dear. - All right, dear. - You're all right now, Mr. Jordan. - Why, what's this, Oliver? Here, come right over here and sit down. - Take it easy now. - Come on. Come quietly. That's right. There you are now. That's it. - lt's right here. - Nitrate of Ammo, quick. Here. Sniff this. There. That's better. l'm all right now. How long has this been going on? Have you ever had it before? No. Not exactly like this. lt's probably indigestion. What did you have for lunch? l didn't have much of anything. l'd like you to come in tomorrow for a more thorough examination. All right. 2:15? l'll be at the hospital till 4:00 so you better make it 4:15. All right. l feel great. l may fool you and not come at all tomorrow. You show up here. Broken appointments are charged double. l never pay them anyhow. What are you doing tonight, Oliver? You're dining with us. That's right. Couldn't you arrange to sneak away and go to bed early? We're going to the theater. Now, you avoid any excitement... and stop worrying about business. - Old pump out of order? - No. lt's a bit weary. - Just a little tired, that's all. - l see. - See you later. Dinner at 8:00? - l believe so. - Goodbye, Oliver. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Thank you very much. - lt's all right. You're not fooling me. How bad is it? Coronary artery. Thrombosis. How long will he live? A few years, months... days, even. Are you sure? Positive. You can tell it like that. Poor fellow. Yeah. - Ready? - All right. All right, Mrs. Bedwick. - Excuse me, ma'am. - Yes, Mrs. Wendel? Why, what's the matter with your face? lt's that old tooth again. What seems to be wrong? lt's the aspic for the dinner tonight. The aspic? l had to drop it on the floor. - You had to drop the aspic on the floor? - Yes, ma'am. You see, the butler and the chauffeur were fighting... and l had to get between them. Ricky and Gustave fighting? - What about? - Dora. Dora? What do they mean by fighting in the kitchen? l don't know, ma'am. But we can't use the aspic for dinner tonight. Of course not, if you dropped it on the floor. 5:00. This is terrible. l particularly wanted the aspic. lt's so dressy. Send for some crabmeat. You can cook it Newburg. - Yes, ma'am. - Send Ricky for it at once. But l can't send Ricky, ma'am. Why not? You see, he's been arrested. He's in jail. - Excuse me, madam. - ln jail? For what? For stabbing Gustave. Excuse me, madam. Miss Carlotta Vance is calling. Tell her l'm not here. Where is Gustave? You see, they took him to the hospital. The doctor's sewing up his eye. Millicent. - Oh, dear. - Where are you? - ln here, Carlotta. - Will that be about all, ma'am? - l hope so. -Thank you, ma'am. Millicent. Ducky. l never was so glad to see anyone in all my life, my dear. - Dear Carlotta. - You don't mind me rushing in on you? - l just popped in to see Oliver. - Really? How nice. - l'm afraid - No, l'll wait. Anything to get out of those streets. May l have a whiskey and soda? You don't mind, do you? Millicent, really, l'm just dying. - Why, of course. - Oh, my. l'm absolutely cracked up. Yeah. Simply depleted. l've been in every office building from the Battery to the Bronx. Millicent, you don't mind if l take my shoes off, do you? What a relief. Oh, me. Oh, my. No. Please do. Thank you. lt's that big toe. What a city. l left the hotel at 11:00 this morning... a young and lovely girl. Now look at me. l took on 10 years trying to get from the Versailles to Times Square. And then l had a restful, nice luncheon with four lawyers. On the 88th floor of the what's-it building, the Sky Club. A cloud floated right into my soup plate. Yes, it's terrible, but we get used to it. The minute l see Oliver, l'm going back to my hotel... and pop myself into bed, and l'm not going to get up until tomorrow at noon. Thank goodness l don't have to go to one of those dreadful dinners tonight. But you're dining here. How enchanting. Of course! The Ferncliffes. That means a nice little cozy game of bridge. l can always keep awake for that. But we're going to the theater. Now, won't that be delightful? Yes. l always like to see a new play. What are we going to see? We're going to see Say lt With Music. Yeah. That will be enchanting. Yes. l thought it was so amusing. What? You've seen it? Yes. Two or three times. That's nothing. No. l'm used to that. Funny man. With a cigar. Should l mix it for you, madam? Thank you very much, my dear. That'd be very nice of you. Oh, dear, let me see. Now, that's enough. How complicated life is. lf ever.... No, my dear. Wait a minute. Don't spoil it. - Oliver. - Oliver, ducky. Hello, Carlotta. - Carlotta. - Carlotta wants to talk to you. - l'll not keep you a minute. - l've got to get a new butler for tonight. l do hope the agency will send me one who doesn't drop things. Optimist. lf it's not asking too much. l tried to get you.... Oliver, sweet. You won't be cross with Carlotta, will you? l told the man... that l wanted to ask you first, but he said, ''No, it must done today.'' A meeting or something. Then l couldn't reach you at your office and l went ahead. Then l sort of got worried about it. Carlotta, what are you trying to tell me? You see, Oliver, sweet, you know, Carlotta's so broke. lt was such a chance, and l sold my Jordan stock. l hope you won't mind. That's what l came here to tell you. Who did you sell it to? A most charming man. He had such nice manners. Let's see. His name is ''James K. Baldridge.'' - l hope you don't mind. - No. lt's all right. Oliver, l did try to reach you. You know, you said you didn't want to buy it back yourself. Along came that nice Mr. Beanbridge with all that beautiful money. - See, it's certified. - Hello. Mr. Kingsbury. Oliver Jordan speaking. You are cross. l'm just devastated. l wouldn't have done it for anything in the world. - l'd rather go barefoot and hungry - Kingsbury? Sorry to disturb you at home. Have the Scatterlee sisters sold their Jordan stock? You sold it this afternoon. Would you mind telling me who bought it? Baldridge. Thank you very much. l guess l'll be trotting along. l'll see you at dinner. Say goodbye to Millicent for me, won't you? No. l'll see you to the door, Carlotta. Hello. Yes. This is Mrs. Jordan. Lord Ferncliffe's secretary. Yes? What's that? But you must be mistaken. But they can't. They can't go to Florida. They are coming here to dinner. l'm giving the dinner for them. They've gone. When? But people don't do such things. l don't care how sudden it was. You should have let me.... All l can say is, l never heard of such a thing in all my life before. - Mother, l want to talk to you. - What? lt's about Ernest and me. l want to talk to you Paula, don't bother me now, for pity's sake. - l can't listen to your - But, Mother, you don't understand. - This is terribly important. - Paula, shut up, l tell you. Let me think. Millicent, would you mind awfully if l didn't go to the theater tonight? l'm feeling pretty rotten. - lf l could just go to bed - What's that you're saying? l'm feeling pretty rotten. l'm up against a business thing. A business thing. At a time like this, you talk to me about a business thing... and feeling rotten. This is a nice time to say you're feeling rotten. You come to me with your.... And you whimpering about Ernest. Some little lovers' quarrel. l'm expected to listen to Ernest, business, and headaches... when l'm half out of my mind. Do you know what's happened to me? l've had the most ghastly day anybody ever had. No aspic for dinner... and Ricky in jail and Gustave dying, for all l know... and a new butler tonight, and that Vance woman coming in. And having to send for crabmeat. Crabmeat! And now, on top of everything else... the Ferncliffes aren't coming to dinner. They call up at this hour, the miserable cockneys. They call up to say they've gone to Florida. Who can l get at this hour? Nobody. l've got eight people for dinner. Eight people isn't a dinner. Who can l get? You come to me with your idiotic little.... l am the one who ought to be in bed. l'm the one who's in trouble. You don't know what trouble is, either of you! How you coming, kitten? How you coming, kitten? l've told you a million times... not to talk to me when l'm doing my lashes. And don't you talk to me when l'm shaving. l think these are the handsomest ones you ever bought. Will you take those back? l'll tell you when l want them. Put them in the icebox, nitwit. Tomorrow, Oliver Jordan can go and buy himself a little rowboat... and start all over again. He'll never know who done it. You're so smart, you're going to land in jail some day. Tina, where are my slippers? l'm just beginning, tootsie. Whose wife's got any bigger bracelets than you've got? Remember what l told you last week? l don't remember what you told me a minute ago. About Washington. Don't you remember that? How'd you like to be a cabinet member's wife? Mingle with all the other Cabinet members' wives and ambassadors'? Nerts. You're not going to drag me down to that graveyard. l've seen their pictures in the papers, those girlies. A lot of sour-faced frumps with last year's clothes on. Pinning medals on Girl Scouts and pouring tea for the DARs... and rolling Easter eggs on the White House lawn. A swell lot of fun l'd have. You go live in Washington. l can have a good time right here. Listen, stupid. lf l get that appointment to Washington, l'm going. And if l go, you go. That's that. - You mean you're really going to get it? - Certainly l am. - l won't go. - You will go! No, l won't! You can't boss me. l can yell just as loud as you can. You've been acting very strangely lately, my fine lady... and l'm not going to stand for it. Yeah. And so what? So what? l'm the works around here and l'll give you orders what to do. Who do you think you're talking to, your first wife out in Montana? Now, you leave her out of this. That poor thing with a flat chest that didn't have nerve enough... to talk up to you, washing your greasy overalls, cooking... and slaving in some lousy mining shack? No wonder she died. - l'll sock you in a minute. - You can't get me that way. You're not going to step on my face to get where you want to go, you big windbag! Listen, you little piece of scum, you.... l've got a good notion to drop you right back where l picked you up: in the checkroom of the Hottentot Club... - or whatever the dirty joint was. - No, you won't! And then you can go back to that sweet-smelling family of yours... back of the railroad tracks in Passaic. And get this. lf that sniveling, money-grubbing, whining old mother of yours... comes fooling around my offices anymore, l'm going to give orders... to have her thrown down those 60 flights of stairs, so help me! Give me that! - You pick that up. - Pick it up yourself. You pick that up! Bracelets, eh? After l pick you out of the gutter, this is the thanks that l get. Thank you. Thanks for what? Listening to you about what a big guy you just been or you gonna be? Listen. You never sent me a flower in your life. When l want flowers, l gotta go buy them. What woman wants to buy theirselves flowers? You never talk to me, or ask me what l've been doing, or how l am, or anything. Why don't you get something to do? l ain't stopping you. You bet you ain't. You think l sit home all day, looking at bracelets. Of all the dumb bunnies. What do you think l'm doing while you're out pulling your dirty deals? Waiting for Daddy to come home? What are you driving at You think you're the only man l know, you great, big noise? You aren't, see? There's somebody that just knowing him... has made me realize what a stuffed shirt you are. You don't like that, do you, Mr. Cabinet Member? Somebody else put over a deal. You've been putting it over on me with some other man? Yes, and what are you going to do about it, you big gasbag? You tell me who it is, or l'll break every bone in your body. You can kill me, and l won't. l'll find out who it is. - Tini! - She don't know. Who's been coming to this house? - You don't know, do you? - You shut your trap! - Who's been coming to this house? - l ain't seen nobody. Yes, you have! You tell me, who came here while l was in Washington? Nobody. Only the doctor. No, l don't mean him. Who's been coming here behind my back? l ain't seen a soul. Get out, you dummy. What did l tell you? l'll divorce you. That's what l'll do. You won't get one cent. - There's a law for what you've done. - Yeah, you got to prove it first. Yeah? l'll track him down. l'll find him, and l'll kill him. That's what l'll do. Then l'll throw you out just like you were an alley cat. Yeah? So you want to go to Washington. You want to tell the President where to get off. You want to go into politics. l know about politics, and l know all about the crooked deals you bragged about. Stealing from Brown, the Thompson business, and gypping old man Clarke... and now this Jordan thing. When l tell about those, it will raise a pretty stink. Politics? You couldn't get into politics. You couldn't get in anywhere. You couldn't even get in the men's room at the Astor. Why, you poisonous little rattlesnake, you.... Listen. l've got to go to this Ferncliffe dinner tonight. Ferncliffe means more to me than you do. l'm clearing out of here after tonight. You can sit here and get flowers from your soul mate. We're through. No, you ain't! Now you're going to listen to me while l run off at the mouth. You're going to let that Jordan stock stay right where it is... because if you don't, l'll broadcast the whole rotten deal. And if l open my trap, they can hear me clean back in Montana. lt's the first chance l ever got with decent society people... to see my name in the paper with somebody that ain't mixed... in your dirty politics, and if l miss it, you'll pay for it with everything you got. - So you'd make a sucker out of me? - l certainly ain't trying to make... a gentleman out of you, but l'm gonna be a lady if it kills me. - Why, you dirty little - Don't say it. So-and-so. - Tina. - Yes, ma'am? Pick that bracelet up. lt fell. - My, it's pretty, ain't it? - Give it to me. Look, it just fits me. Give it here, will you? You got so many bracelets. l don't see how you can use them all. What are you driving at? Nothing. Only, l thought with you having so many... maybe you might want to give me one. Come in. Where have you been? You know l was waiting here, you silly Larry, l brought up Mr. Stengel. This is Larry Renault, Mr. Stengel. Larry, this is Joe Stengel. - How do you do, Mr. Stengel? - Mr. Renault. This is quite an occasion. The meeting of two celebrities. - We should have the newsreel men here. - Yes. Of course l didn't realize it was a full-dress affair. l just came as l was. Mr. Renault has got a dinner date with some of his Park Avenue friends. You know, these big picture boys, they're pretty social. Yes. l've heard. Look, Mr. Renault. l haven't got an awful lot of time. Larry, suppose we get down to brass tacks. All right, my dear fellow. Stengel, you're going to produce this play... and you want me to act in it? - Well, l - Larry, this is just getting acquainted. He's just crazy to play the part. Just a minute. Let's get this thing straight. l understand from Mr. Kane here that you wanted to know if l'd be willing... to portray the beachcomber in this thing. - Wait a minute. Not so fast there. - Now, Larry. ln the first place, if l consent to play this part, and l don't say l will... it will have to be built up. Built up? The fellow's got one scene... and they find him dead on the beach. This isn't a play about spiritualism. Don't forget, l'm Larry Renault. - Larry, for heaven's sake! - Shut up! Now, listen, Stengel. l'm a name, and l know it, and so do you. And l'm not going on to play second fiddle to any cheap English ham. $8,000 a week. That's what l got, and l was going to get $10,000... till the talkies came in. So don't think you're doing me a favor by asking me to play in your ratty show... because l'm doing you one. l think maybe we're keeping you from your dinner, Mr. Renault. - Joe, he doesn't mean - Yes, l do! And just because it's Mr. Joe Stengel, it don't mean a thing to me. l'm still good, better than l ever was. Good night, Mr. Renault. Listen to me, old-timer. l'm drunk, and l know l'm drunk... but l know what l'm talking about. For heaven's sake, Mr. Stengel. lt's all right. l'll see you tomorrow. l wouldn't be in your rotten show. Not Larry Renault. You know why? Because l'm an important artist, and you're a cheap pushcart producer. Pushcart! You cockeyed, drunken fool. l bring him up here. l go down on my hands and knees to do it. And you! You.... Well, that's that. Wait a minute. l got something to say to you, too. Telling him l was crazy to play the part. You got this play away from Baumann and you gave it to Stengel... you double-dealing chiseler. l've been suspicious of you all along. You're in with the managers. You've been taking my money and working for them. You don't say. l'm working for the managers, huh? Taking your money. Me? Me that you're into for $500 in touches. You think l've been lying to you all the time? All right. You're going to get the truth now. Renault, you're through. Get out. l'll get out and l'll stay out... but get this first. l never worked so hard in my life to put anybody over as l did you. You think l told you all the things that l tried? No! Because l couldn't come to you and tell you what they said. l felt too sorry for you. You were sorry for me? Vaudeville. Every time l walked into a booking office, they leaned back and they roared. They called me ''Mac, the Grave Snatcher.'' Last night, l sent another telegram to the Coast. l knew it was no use, but l sent it anyway. You want to see the answer? No. ''Thank you. When we're in the market for bit players, we will let you know.'' You're trying to throw a scare into me. Oh, no. l'm just telling you the truth. You know, you never were an actor. You did have looks, but they're gone now. You don't have to take my word for it. Just look in any mirror. They don't lie. Take a good look. Look at those pouches under your eyes. Look at those creases. You sag like an old woman. Get a load of yourself. Wait till you start tramping around the offices, looking for a job... because no agent's going to handle you. Sitting in those anterooms hour after hour, giving your name to office boys... that never even heard of you. You're through, Renault. You're through in pictures and plays and vaudeville... and radio and everything. You're a corpse, and you don't know it. Go get yourself buried. They don't want that junk. They wouldn't give me nothing on it. Why, it's a silver frame. The buckle's solid gold. You take them. l lugged them to every pawnshop on Sixth Avenue. You little liar. You never took them anyplace. Say, who you calling a liar, you down-and-out ham? You filthy little rat, how dare you talk to me like that? - Okay. - Wait a minute. l didn't mean that. l'm sorry. Listen. l got to have some liquor. l'm sick. Lay it out for me like a good kid. l'll pay you back. What kind of a sucker do you think l am? l got to have it. l got to. l'll pay you back tomorrow. Baloney. How do you do, Mr. Renault? l've not met you before, though you've been with us for some time. l'm Mr. Fitch, the manager. Mr. Renault, we find ourselves in a very awkward predicament. We've just had a communication from some very old clients of ours... Mr. and Mrs. Sherman Montgomery. They've always occupied this particular suite. You know how people are. They say it's just like home to them. They're coming in tomorrow. ls that right, Mr. Hatfield? - Yes. Tomorrow afternoon. - There you are. Under the circumstances, l'm afraid that we shall have to ask you for these rooms. What other rooms can you give me? That's just the trouble, you see, we're so terribly full up. The horse show and.... Mr. Hatfield, is there any place that we can put Mr. Renault? - l'm afraid not, Mr. Fitch. - lt's quite all right. As a matter of fact... l was just about to notify your office l was leaving. Some friends of mine, private car... Palm Beach. - When would you want me to - There's no hurry. Shall we say noon tomorrow, Mr. Renault? -Sure. Good night. -Thank you very much. So sorry to have inconvenienced you in this way. Ed. Ed, where are you? l'm coming. - She's got music. - l hear it. - Now, Ed, it isn't going to be so terrible. - Not so terrible? Get into this uniform to meet a bunch of fatheads l don't want to know... and miss that Greta Garbo picture l've been waiting for, for two months. What's your idea of terrible? Don't you want to meet Larry Renault? That's better than going to a movie. - That has-been. - And Carlotta Vance. And Jenny Lind. ls she coming? Now, Ed, Millie's done a lot of things for us. Helps me with my clothes. Besides, who can you get at 6:45 but relatives? All right. l'm a relative and l'm here. Come on. Let's get it over with. - Be careful of the steps. - l know. That's very nice, but do you mind? Not quite so loud. There will be people in there talking, you know. Thank you. Hello, Ed, hello, Hattie. Where's Oliver? Upstairs. He's got a headache or something. Me, too. - How nice. So lovely to see you. - How are you, Mrs. Jordan? - You know Mrs. Packard, l believe. - Of course. How lovely of you to come. - So nice of you to ask us, l'm sure. - Mrs. Packard, may l present my cousins... Mr. and Mrs. Loomis. Mr. Packard. - l'm pleased to meet you, l'm sure. - How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Loomis? You know, for a minute there l had you wrong. l figured that maybe you were Ferncliffe. You're close. l'm pinch-hitting for him. What's the matter? l'm so sorry to disappoint you... but Lord Ferncliffe was taken frightfully ill with neuritis this afternoon. l am so sorry. Do you mean to say that Ferncliffe won't be here? Yes. lsn't it terrible? They had to rush him off to Florida. l don't care for Florida. Do you? Have you ever been to Florida? l love it. We're not going down this winter. - Are you? - l don't know. Are we going to Florida this winter, sweetheart? l wouldn't count on it if l were you. l'll miss it so. lt's so wonderful to have nothing to do, just to lie all day in the sun. Yes, but you've got to be awful careful that you don't get blistered. You know, my skin's terribly delicate, and l don't dare expose it. Pardon me. - Hello, Lucy. - Hello, Millicent. - My, you look charming. - Lucy, you know everyone, don't you? - Hello. - Glad to see you. Haven't seen you around the house lately. What's the matter? Did the patient get well on you? She's getting along very well without me, aren't you, Mrs. Packard? l get along better when you're looking after me. Millicent, darling. Do forgive me. l had to bring him. He wouldn't stay at home. He cried and he cried. Didn't you, Tarzan? lsn't he sweet? Carlotta, you know Mrs. Talbot, don't you? And my cousin, Mrs. Loomis. What do you think of Bunny Ferncliffe? Dashing off to Florida and ruining your whole dinner party. You know, l went to the hotel and found his telegram. ''Off on a fishing trip. Love your America. ''Never felt better in my life."" ''Caroline and l want you to join us. Wire Palm Beach. Bunny.'' lsn't Bunny a swine? l'd rather go away in the winter than in the summer. l love New York in the summer. Where's Paula? l'm just dying to see her again. Ernest came back tonight. They're in the library talking. They're going to be married, you know? Ernest DeGraff. DeGraff? l think l knew his father. l did. l think l'll barge along... and talk to Paula alone in the library. My dear. You poor little man. You look so lonely. Here. Tarzan will keep you company. And then l had a little time, so l went to Budapest. Say, there's a place we've got to go on our honeymoon. Ernest, while you've been away, there's something.... There you are, you two turtledoves! -Paula. -Carlotta. And this is Ernest! l'm Carlotta Vance. And don't tell me that your grandfather saw me when he was a boy. How did you know that l was Ernest? l can tell an Ernest 20 feet off. Do you suppose you two could stop billing and cooing just long enough... for me to have a little word with Paula? All right. The next billing and cooing will take place at 8:45. Dear. He's charming, isn't he? So like his father. l hope he'll be as generous. Why haven't you been to see me, Paula? - l'm at the Versailles. - The Versailles. Yes, of course. l must come. That's on East 48th Street, isn't it? Not quite. East 53rd Street, l believe. Yes, l was thinking of something else. Yes, l suppose you were. You know, l'm on the eighth floor. Curiously enough, just down the hall from.... You've seen me, then. What of it? l'm not ashamed. - No, dear. - Go ahead. Tell Mother. l'm going to tell her myself. lt's funny. l should think at least you would understand. l haven't said l don't understand. Do you? Then for heaven's sake, help me. Talk to Father for me, will you? You can help me. l'm sorry. l can't. Not now. All right. You want me to give him up. l won't. You're just like all the rest of the old people. l'm sure l am, but You think you know what's best because you're old. You think you can tell me what to do with my life. You can't, because it's my life. l'm young. l've got a right to go to the man l love. l'm sure you have, dear, but.... But what? What could you possibly say that could keep me from going to him? Simply that he's killed himself. That's not so. lt can't be. They found him just as l was starting to come here. Poor Paula. l'm so sorry. - Where are you going? - To him. No. Listen, Paula. l realize that l'm an old woman... and young people have a right to do what they want... but at this time l think you should consider someone else. Your father. My poor Larry. He's dead, Carlotta. And nothing can be done. That's the unfortunate thing about death. lt's so terribly final. Even the young can't do anything about it. Really. Listen, darling. Don't. Paula, listen. l wonder what's keeping Oliver. What would you say he's missed... by not being in this room the last 10 minutes? l don't know. l guess German pictures are all right if you like German pictures. Say, Mrs. Talbot, l've just been talking with your husband... and l find that we have a lot in common. - Yes? - Yeah. We're members of the same golf club. How nice. l wonder when we eat. - Pardon, madam. - Yes, Dora? Will you please come upstairs? Mr. Jordan isn't feeling well. Very well, Dora. l don't know how l... l've got to Maybe l'd better go up and see him with you. - Perhaps you'd better. - Yes, surely. Oliver. l'm all right, Millicent. Don't worry, please. lt's something l had for lunch. - Talbot? - Certainly. Have you any spirits of ammonia? l think there's some in the medicine chest. l'll get it. l'll be right back, Oliver. - l'm all right. - There, there, now. Take it easy, old man. That's right. Here you are, dear. You do this. You can do it much better than l can... and remember, we must not spoil Millicent's dinner. They probably won't know anything about this news until tomorrow. l'm all right now. Thank you. Of course you are, my dear. Now Ernest won't notice a thing. l don't want to see Ernest. l don't want to see anybody. Yes, you do, dear. But l want to tell you one thing. Don't ever let him know anything about this... 'cause if there's one thing l know, it's men. l ought to. lt's been my life work. l can't ever love another man. No, of course you can't, dear. But if you should, you know, someone like Ernest... he won't want to know anything about your past... as long as you keep it in the past. Come on, dear. Why, Millicent, what is it? l had to tell her, Oliver. Oliver, my poor No, don't, dear. Please. Sit down, Oliver. That's it. Here. Drink this. Why didn't you tell me? Dear, it isn't as bad as all that. ls it, now? No. Not at all. Dear heart, l would have told you all about it. No, you wouldn't. And l've been too busy to notice... while you've been suffering. Oliver, l do love you, and l've always loved you... even though l have turned into a silly... stupid, useless wife. Now, but you haven't, Millie. As a matter of fact, you've turned out a much better wife... than l have a husband. - No. - Yes. You see, the thing that's troubling me most, Millie... is that... l'm afraid the Jordan Line is gone. - Gone? - We're broke. But everybody's broke, darling. Don't let that worry you. We'll economize. That's what we'll do. We'll economize. Now, let me see. l don't have to take a box for that charity thing Saturday night now... you know, for backward orphans or something. And l'll cancel my hairdresser's tomorrow. You leave everything to me. And with Paula married to Ernest, we'll take a smaller place somewhere. Hello, Embassy Club. This is Mrs. Oliver Jordan. l want to cancel my table for after the theater tonight. Thank you. And you go to bed right after dinner, darling. Darling, we're going to be happier than ever. You'll see. l like it in New York in the summer. l've had some swell times on penthouse parties. All my life, l've wanted to be a penthouse girl. Yeah. You'd be good at that. l'll be seeing you. - Joseph. - Yes, madam. You can announce dinner in a few moments. Yes, madam. - Hello, Hattie. - Hello, Oliver. - How are you, Ed? - l'm fine. - You all right? - Fine, thanks. Oliver, l've missed you. l'm sorry. l had to telephone. Some business. You're not cross with Carlotta, are you? You know l love you. - Go on. Tell Jordan. - Shut up. - Go on and tell him. - Shut up. lf you don't, you'll be sorry as long as you live. Shut up. - How do you do, Mrs. Packard? - Glad to see you, l'm sure. - Oliver, how are you? - Glad to see you. l'm delighted, l assure you. We'll go in to dinner. Seems rather rude not to wait for Mr. Renault. But after all, it's nearly 9:00. You're not going to tell him? - Mr. Jordan, l've got - l'll tell him. Dan never will let me talk to anyone that's attractive. Oliver, l've got something very important to tell you. l've got some news for you. News? When a man bites a dog, that's news. l hope you'll like that stuff l brought from Paris for you. One of them is a knockout. You came near losing the Jordan Lines this afternoon. A dirty crook by the name of Baldridge tried to pull a fast one. - You don't mean - Yes, but l saved it for you. We headed him off. Say, old man, l've been awfully unfair to you. Oh, no. l was reading a book the other day. Reading a book? Yes. lt's all about civilization or something. A nutty kind of a book. You know, the guy says that machinery... is going to take the place of every profession. My dear, that's something you need never worry about. Say, l want to sit next to Oliver!

Shoot them, can't you? Shoot them. Hey! You're crazy? You want to kill somebody? Get down. Why? What have they done? They haven't done anything. Using horses is wrong. It's wrong killing horses. Come on, let's go, boys. Get up. Up. Come on, boys. Everybody here? Huh? Link up, boys. A taste of the real thing. You'll get used to it. You ready? All right. Well, you're almost getting to be soldiers now. You stick with Kat and you'll be all right. 'We have been at the front for a year. We are soldiers now. 'We know this place well. 'We are at home. 'Only Kemmerich is dead but we keep hearing about others in our class; 'dead, wounded. 'If a shot comes, all we can do is duck, 'because we can never know where it will fall. 'I can be smashed to bits in a bomb-proof dugout, 'of I can survive ten hours unscathed out in the open. 'Of course, every soldier believes in chance and trusts his luck. 'But no soldier outlives a thousand chances. 'We call them corpse rats. 'They have shocking evil faces and even on our empty stomachs, 'it is nauseating to see their long naked tais. 'The bait is bread, so rotten even we won't eat it. 'they'll come among us to snatch them away. 'It's a way to pass the time.' Gas masks. Gas masks. 'Gas, the most feared, most obscene weapon of all. 'We remember the awful sights in the hospital. 'The gas patients who, surfocating, 'cough up their burned lungs in clots. 'Better take your chances in the open 'than stay in the hollows where the vapours settle.' 'The new recruits are more trouble than they are worth. 'Between five and ten get killed to every old hand. 'And they get killed simply because they are so inexperienced. No, don't! No! Get him. Hand me a rifle. Hand me a rifle. Kat, wait! A baby. Just a baby. They're in position. - Nearby? - Yes, sir. 'How long has it been? 'Weeks, months, years? Only days. 'Yesterday we were under fire. Today we can rest. 'Tomorrow we go up to the trenches again.' Boys, boys, come here. Look, you boys go on that side. Over here. This way. Easy, easy. Get around, get around up there. This way. It's gone. Quick, he'll get away. Get him, get him, get him! Someone eat the liver. I'm on a diet. and the sturfing would have been something very special. But all considered... A feast. I feel like a king. Ah, not bad, not bad. Like I say, it's not a bad little war. You never answered my question, Joseph. What question? What we'll all do. Get drunk. Of course he'll get drunk. Then it's back home and mama and all that. But what ese? Well, tell him, Joseph. Don't be ashamed. I'm not ashamed. He's going to theology school to be a minister. A year here and you haven't changed your mind about that. Is God still in his heaven? Nothing ever changes that. What about you? Back to the cobbler's bench, eh? And the children. How many you got? Don't ask. Good thing I'm a shoemaker, of I'd go broke just buying shoes. More coffins. A bigger load than usual. That means a bigger offensive. How considerate they are at headquarters. Come on, get this one down. Haul them up. Careful, careful. How old are you? Sixteen. Next year, fight out of the cradle. Did you notch this bayonet? Yes, sir. Who told you to? - At the training camp... - Training camp, eh? Sonny, if the enemy ever caught you with this, they wouldn't kill you, Nobody uses these things any more. It's by mutual agreement, on both sides. I didn't know. - First time? - Yes, sir. Don't 'sir' me. I'm a private. Sorry, I thought... Don't think. Just listen. Yes, sir. Your spade is better. You hit a man under the chin. Take his head off. It's a good club, too. Cos it's heavy. Hit a man between neck and shoulder. Right here. Split him right in two. - Mother of God! - It's cleaner. Bayonet gets stuck in ribs, you have to kick him to pull it out. Time it takes, you're a dead man. Understand? Now, where is your platoon leader? Corporal Himmestoss said he'd meet us here. Ah. Corporal who? Himmestoss. From Oldenberg training station? Yes, sir. I don't believe it! Vengeance is mine. No, sir. He got into trouble. Overdid it with two trainees on the muddy field. You know the field? Do we know the muddy field? He went too far. Almost killed them. He didn't see the son of the local magistrate watching. So, he's here. Of course he'd spoil it for himself. Oh, Lord. I can hardly wait. Oh, well. Look who's here. Well, we meet again. Kropp, isn't it? You remember me, Corporal Himmestoss. Mller, you here too? Oh, yes, I remember you very well. Lehr, Behm, Baumer...Baumer. Nothing wrong with my memory! You've all managed to stay alive. Not Kemmerich. Kemmerich? I don't remember Kemmerich. The rest of you seem to have learned your lessons pretty well. don't you turn your back. What did you say? So this is the great Corporal Himmestoss? And who are you? I asked you a question, soldier. Himmestoss. There's a latfine down the road. Why don't you take a jump? Do you want to be court martialled? Stand up straight, hees together, when your superior officer speaks to you. All of you! Squad, attention! Right...face. Right turn, forward...march. Left, left, left, left. Left, left, left, left, left, left. Easy, boy, easy. It'll be all right. Ah, you see the way he blows up? Boom, like that. Want to kill Frenchmen? You'll be all right, boy. You'll get used to it. To soften us up so we can't sleep. Huh, then when they attack, we won't be able to fight back because we're too tired. Two days and nights. How much longer? Not too long, not too long. Why don't they stop? Where are you going? I'll be back...in a minute. No, just relax. Wait. It'll be over soon. Come on, sit down and relax. Let me go. I must get away. Sit down and calm down. Now, go and sit down. Behave yourselves. Be easy, quiet. I said... Come on, let's go. Come on...come on. 'No longer do we lie helpless, awaiting destruction. 'We can destroy and kill to save ourselves and to be revenged. 'When we see their faces, we become wild beasts. 'We turn into thugs and murderers. 'Into God only knows what devis. 'If your own father was with them, Forward! Fire. What the hell is this? Come on, let's go. Come on, you all. Come on, move. You too, soldier. Come on, let's go. let's go, let's go. What's happening down there? Come on. Come on! Come on! 'How long is it? Days, of weeks, of months, of years? 'Attack, counter-attack. And the dead pile up. 'Winter, summer... The days are hot and the dead lie unburied. 'The shels will bury them. 'But when the wind blows, it brings the smell of blood, 'which is heavy and sweet.' No, shh...shh... Shh! Shh! No, no... - No, shh. Je vous... Je vous...help... I want to help you. Ohh! I didn't want to kill you. But you jumped in here like that. What would you have done? It's... face to face. I just saw your rifle... your bayonet... grenades. If we threw all those away... we could be brothers. But they never want us to know that, do they? They never want us to know. We each have mothers... fathers... the same... fear of death. The same... pain. The same... everything. Everything. Forgive me, comfade. I could write...to your family. Yes... Yes, I'll write! 'Gefard Duval, compositeur. 'I have killed Gefard Duval the printer.' Battalion, attention! Present arms! Eyes left! Battalion Commander, sir.

Not fair to the gifs... No. One of us will have to make the supreme sacrifice. Mmm? Bottoms up, Tjaden, you're not keeping up with us. Maybe we should draw lots? You lose. - Bonsoir. - Bonsoir. This looks like the right line-up, huh? I'm all for this one. You like yours, Albert? Yes. Paul? Mais tu es blanc comme neige, je crois. Er... Est-ce que je me trompe, petit bon homme. Oui! Mon petit soldat. Non, non. Ici. - Quelle age a-tu? - Eh? - Ton age? - No... - Quelle age a-tu? - Ah! I'm 19. 19... Oh! Vingt-cinq ans? Vraiment? Look out! Look out! Take cover! - My leg! - Come on, Albert! Up! Up! Come on, boys, a little bit more. Down! Stay down! I'll be right back! Hey! Paul! Take care! Kat. Kat! Kat, come on! - All right. - Easy, easy. - From Kat. - What is it? - It's a long ride. - Oh, bread and cheese! He could find a lobster dinner in the middle of the desert! Goodbye. - Take care, Paul. - Bye. 'Albert and I are in a Catholic hospital. - Won't see him again. - Why not? The ""Dead Room""? What's the Dead Room? The Dying Room, whatever you call it. It's in the basement. It's convenient really. It's next to the mortuary. No one ever comes back. 'The beds empty quickly, and new occupants take their places. 'It is going badly with Albert. He is in much pain. 'Last night one of our wardmates awakened with a severe haemoffhage. They won't take me! No! NO! We're taking you to the bandaging room. I won't go to the Dying Room! We're not going there. Then why take his tunic? - I'll be back. I won't die! - Why are you taking his tunic? I'll come back! I won't die! I'll come back! Liars! They're lying. LIARS! I'll come back! I'll come back! I won't die... Stop it! Stop it! Stop that! Orderly! Get the orderly! Doctor! Orderly! Orderly! Why didn't you leave him alone? You are doing so well, Paul. Soon we'll throw away the cane. - Sister. - Yes? I'm worried about my friend. I think...he is making a very good recovery. He worries me. Since the operation, he... He's in a terrible state of mind. He hardly speaks to me any more. There is always such a reaction after an amputation. Always! Now, stop worrying. Albert will get over it. Go, tell him your good news. That should cheer him up. Albert? How do you feel? Albert, they're giving me 16 days convalescent leave. I'm going home. They'll be sending you home, too. Is there anything I can get you? A gun. A what? You want to get me something? Get me a gun. - Will you get me a gun or not? - No! Don't talk nonsense! No, you talk sense. Albert... I'm sorry. Paul? Paul! Why didn't you tell us you were coming? Mother. Mother! Paul? Come up. Give me your handkerchief. How is she? She's in bed. She's sick, Paul. What is it? We don't know. But...Dr Bradermeier thinks... it's probably the cancer again. Thank God. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Are you wounded, Paul? No... No, I'm just on leave. - Oh, Paul. - How are you? I'm going to try to get up a little today, I think. Good. My Paul. My Paul. Look. Bread. And cheese and...butter! They feed you enough where you are? Not always enough, but we manage. Is it very bad there? No. Not so bad. Heinrich Bradermeier was here and said it's terrible out there, with the gas attacks and all the rest of it. It's just talk. Just talk. Look at me, I'm well and fit, aren't I? Yes. But then... It's more comfortable, Father, that's all. But I...I want to show off our soldier boy to the fellows at Max's. You look well, Paul. Fit. War agrees with you, eh? - I suppose, in a way. - Have a cigar. If you're old enough to kill Frenchmen, you can smoke. Hans, another beer for our young warrior. What's the spirit like out there? Excellent, eh? The enemy has many reserves, Mr Hollerstein. You only see your little sector, The important thing is the breakthrough, here in Flanders. This is Frenchie, this is us. We have to come found the Belgian side and fam through. There's no other way. Before we beat them on the Hindenburg line? It is borders that are important. You're quite wrong. Good soldiers never stay planted on borders like turnips... You're lying to me, Paul. I know you are. I swear to you, he died instantly. - You promised he wouldn't get hurt. - Mrs Kemmerich, I... Why are you living when he is dead? Why? What right have you? Tell me again. Did you...see it? Yes, I was fight there next to him. He died at once. He never suffered. I know that you're trying to comfort me, I want to know the... I want the truth! I have to hear it! Mrs Kemmerich, I promise, that's exactly how it happened. His face was quite calm. - Do you swear it? - Yes. By everything that is sacred to you? By everything that is sacred to me. He died at once. May I never come back... if he wasn't killed instantly. Carry that lesson to the front lines You are dismissed. Baumer. Paul Baumer! Baumer! - Here, have a cigarette. - No, thank you. You still haven't picked up the habit. Well, that's good. It's not a good habit but a man has to have vices. How does it go? All work and no play... You remember? How is it, Baumer? How...how is the spirit? Excellent, eh? Excellent? Behm is dead. Behm? Josef Behm. Oh. You know, I didn't think he would enlist. But he went. Yes... Kemmerich is dead, too. I was told. And Kropp has lost a leg. Er... Oh, Albert Kropp, yes. I don't know about all the others. We were separated, but Leer's alive and Mller is alive and I'm alive. I'm glad to hear that. Tell them... Tell them I'm proud to have taught them to be good Germans. To know that you have all done your duty by the Fatherland. Imagine how that makes me feel? You were a good class. Good boys. Good boys all. - And this class? - This lot? They haven't got your spirit, Baumer. Not the Iron Youth, eh? Mm? I'm sorry...? No Iron Heroes? Just boys. Want to play. Laugh. To stay alive. Only boys. Mother, it's late. You should be asleep. Did I wake you, dear? I'm sorry. You'll catch cold here. Go sleep. I can sleep enough later. Are you very much afraid? No. I'd like to tell you to be on your guard against the women in France. They're no good. Mother, where we are there aren't any women. - Yes, I will. - I pray for you every day. I know, Mother. Perhaps you can get a job that is not so dangerous? Perhaps in the cookhouse. That could be easily done. Do it, then, and if others say anything... I won't let that bother me. Now, you must sleep, Mother. Come on. 'Mother, I used to live in this room. All my things are here. 'All my books, my beloved books, 'but they no longer speak to me as they used to, 'for I am not what I was when I lived here. 'I am a soldier. My business is not reading, it is killing. 'My knowledge of life is limited to death, 'and I know now I should never have come back. 'because it has no meaning. 'My companions at the front are the only truth I know. 'I depend on them and I depend on nothing ese. 'Mother, it's a terrible thing to say, 'but I feel I am now going back to my real home.' Paul! - Well, you're back, my boy. - Yes, I'm back. You're a fool. I'm glad to see you, anyway. I'm glad to see you, too, Kat. They're getting younger and younger, Paul. Our hands'll be full just taking care of them. Hey! The old deserter's back! - How was your leave? - Good. Where's Mller? - When was it? - A week ago. Was it quick? Shrapnel in the stomach. He lasted two hours. Damn! Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Leer! No, leave him! He's gone! He's gone! Leer! Come back! God! Oh, GOD! GOD! GOD! GOD! - Ready! Charge! - Let's go! 'There isn't much. We are all going hungry. We are all tired. 'We are all hopeless. But the war goes on.' Why don't they just let it end? Ah, who knows? We're finished. Our bread is nothing but sawdust. You see anybody that hasn't got dysentery and colic? Artillery's burned out. Damned barres are so worn down Too many guns, tanks. Now the Americans are pouring in. New guns, aeroplanes, fresh troops. Lie still. - Just as it's ending! - Be quiet! - After four years. - Stretcher! - Stretcher bearer! - Just as it's ending. It's all right. Just lie still. Don't worry, it looks like a clean wound. Just hold on. Stretcher! Can you stand up? You can get up? Come on. Come on! Come on! I've got to carry you. Ready? Up. Sorry. That's all right. That's all right. We gotta keep going. You ready? Yes, yes. Come on. - You got it? - I'll try. - No. - No, I'll try. No, you can't. It's all right. No. It's his shin, he's fainted. C'mon, Kat, come on. He was talking. Ten minutes ago. We were talking. 'It is Autumn. We wait for the end. 'We wait for the Armistice. 'We wait for peace.' 'a bullet in the head. 'Himmestoss was killed the same day 'and now Detering is gone.

What is your name? Rosette Henrietta LaRue. Occupation: Hip swinging. Now, Miss LaRue, just what constitutes a striptease? A good constitution and a couple of zippers. - Don't be ambiguous. - I won't if you won't! Sergeant... to what extent of exposure does the striptease go? Hey, don't ask him, ask me. I'll be delighted to show you. - No, you won't! - What's the matter? Why can't I show... Order! Next defendant. The judge could give you 15 years for what you're thinking. It'd be worth it. - Name? - Janie Barlow. - Occupation? - Social worker. Why were you doing a striptease? If you'd walked the streets looking for a job... and hadn't eaten for a week, you'd do a striptease, too. Do you mean to tell me that in a city like this... burlesque dancing was the only work you could find? It was the only dancing I could find. - Did it have to be dancing? - Yeah, it had to be dancing. - Why? - Because I'm a dancer. Young woman, am I the defendant or are you? I don't know who's the defendant, but I'm the victim... and you don't have to rub it in. I don't see any girls hauled in here... for pushing pencils around on paper or massaging a typewriter. I'm a dancer and I'll keep right on being one when I get out of here. You'll get out of here when you pay a $30 fine. You can't fine me, I haven't got a dime. All right. $30 fine or 30 days in jail. Right this way, please. Recess, 15 minutes. Let's go some place and get a drink. I'm bored. - Yes. Let's do that. - Okay. Take them over to the St. Regis Roof. I'll join you later. All right.

Why'd you pay that $30 fine, Mr... - Newton. - Mr. Newton. That's my business. Investments. Sorry to tell you, but I'm the kind of investment that don't pay. - Why, I could give you everything... - Can it. Say, what're you writing all the time? I'll tell you later. You sure drink a good dinner. Now, why did you want to change the subject? - What subject? - You. Don't you know you'll never get anywhere with those notions of yours? Maybe I will. I'm like that guy throwing quarters in the slot machine. - I keep on trying. - Listen, those machines are fixed. It's 1,000 to 1 shot unless you know the combination. And I'm the little fellow that knows the combination. Little fellows like you have been trying to teach me all sorts of combinations... ever since I was a kid. - But I only know one game. - Dancing? You said it. Just the same, you're not playing that right, with stopovers in jail. I'll get my break. I'm your break, beautiful. I'm a chance of a lifetime, Janie. You better take me up.

Oh, that's all right. Let him insult you. Many a girl has cashed in on a good, hearty insult. Oh, I nearly forgot. He gave me a note. Hope he signed his right name. A $50. ""Don't say 'them things.' ""Don't say 'can it.' Don't say 'guy.' ""Don't buy shoes with ribbons on them. ""Don't forget, what's a striptease on Second Avenue is art on Broadway. ""The $50 is to buy yourself a dress without a zipper."" ""Don't say 'can it.""' ""Don't say 'guy.""' ""Don't say 'them things.""' Why, that Park Avenue know-it-all. ""Don't buy shoes with ribbons on them."" Fresh egg! And don't... And don't get so noble with the groceries. There's enough in this to eat for a month. Oh, all right. Now I owe him $80. Oh, how can you pal around with me and still stay so dumb? Say, what's the matter with them shoes? These shoes. Come on, baby, hit the hay. The joint will be jammed tomorrow and after our pinch tonight... they'll expect us girls to pull that zipper twice as fast. I'm not going back to the joint. I'm through with burlesque. I'm going up. Up town and on my own. Listen, hon, I've been up there and I came down flat on my own. Oh, can it. Drop it. Variety says Patch Gallagher is putting on a new show. What kind of a guy is this Patch Gallagher, Rosie? Compared to him an elephant's hide is tissue paper. But he sure knows his stuff. I'm going to see him in the morning. Yeah? And I'm having breakfast at the White House. I'm going to work for Patch Gallagher. You can dream better if you'll get to sleep. I'm through dreaming. I'm gonna start doing. I'm going up where it's art. Uptown. I was never treated so disgracefully in my life. Don't lose your temper now. And you all can tell that Mr. Gallagher... that cotton will grow black before I come to see him again, sir. Where we all come from gentlemen know how to speak to ladies. - And you can tell him from me... - Break it up. You all go back to the Mason-Dixon line, sugar. What a wise agent you are. Gallagher ain't tough enough. You had to make him tougher. Oh, I told you that Southern accent would sound phony. Now, wait a minute. Listen, wait a minute, won't you? Way up. Way up. Come on. That's it. Now, back. Back, back. All right, all right. Break it up, break it up. Just a minute, Miss Warner. All right, Harry. - I met a Southern girl out there. - Way from the South? Now, don't tell me. Don't tell me you're from the South. And they want to build a statue of my father... but I wouldn't let them. - Oh, stop. Come in. - Yeah. That's true. Don't tell me they want to make a statue of your father. - Look. - Hello. What do you want? I was wondering if y'all could tell me where I could find Mr. Gallagher? What do you want Mr. Gallagher for? Well, I'd kind of like to talk to him about that Southern part. About the Southern part. - Hallelujah! Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! Hallelujah! There he is over there. Take a good look at him. It's funny, but I'm a little nearsighted. I'm afraid I'll have to get a little closer to him. Come on, come on. You're big-eyed enough to see that he's busy. But I wouldn't take up any of his time. The lady is leaving. Look now, I know if you'd let me get in there... that he'd let me do this part. I know he would. Did you read that sign on the door: ""No more girls wanted""? Yes, I read it. Will you read it again and get that mush out of your mouth? How'd you like some of it in your eye, you big bruiser? - Steve. - Okay, boss. I've decided to take Miss Warner for the part. - Miss Warner? - Yeah. Oh, I see. Congratulations, Miss Warner. You all don't come from the South, do you? No. - Steve. - Yeah, boss? That's all today. Regular rehearsal a week from Monday. Break it up! Break it up! That's all for today. The regular rehearsals start a week from Monday. - So, you took Warner, eh? - Yeah. I know she's not so hot. But with all the real talent gone to Hollywood... you gotta make the best of what you can get. We'll be down to using midgets pretty soon. Well, work on her. Use the whip if you have to. She's got to be loosened up by the time we open. I'll offer her candy. Maybe she likes candy. - Offer her anything but more money. - Okay, Mr. Gallagher. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Slumming again? - No, I joined the Uplifters Society. - Who's the victim? - You. I looked for you down at the burlesque, I couldn't find you. - You going after art? - Gallagher. You're finding out the machines are fixed against your 1,000 to 1 shot? - Lf you're running low on coins... - No. Don't pull that $50 gag again, please. Aren't you ready to give up? I've been chasing that guy, Gallagher around for days. But I'm young yet. Got a lot of time ahead of me. Got a lot of sleep to catch up on, too. - Goodnight, Mr. Newton. - Hey, wait a minute. Now, suppose I gave you a letter to Jasper Bradley... make it easy for you? - Bradley? - That's Gallagher's boss. How about it? What's there in it for you? Now, this is no place to discuss that. - Come on, let's go upstairs. - Can't you read? I'm no gentleman. Besides, I need pen and ink for that letter. You'll find pen and ink in the parlor. - Okay. - Hey, wait a minute. You haven't told me yet where you cut in. If you want it that way, I won't cut in at all. - At least not for a while. - No. I'll do it for art's sake. Okay. I'll take it. But remember, I stay out of your private collection. - Good morning, good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Bradley. - Good morning, Miss Allen. - Good morning, Mr. Bradley. - Good morning, Miss Allen. - Good morning, Junior. I mean, Mr. Bradley. What do you think I want to see you about? How about un-belting with some more cash for this show? You're not putting on a dog and monkey circus, you know. Look at these costumes. - See anything wrong with them? - No. They're very pretty. Very nice. Yes, they're pretty. They're nice. I suppose you can see they're not of the same period. The styles are only a hundred years apart. What of it? Nobody will know the difference. Besides, they're the best we could rent. So that's the gag. Rented. You can afford to buy some, can't you? Yes, I can, but there are taxes and advertising... and salaries for people like you and Junior. It costs money to send Junior to Harvard to study the drama. Well, you can write that off as a dead loss. Oh, now, now, don't get excited over nothing. If you don't care about your rep, I care about mine. And I'm not going to put on a charity bazaar for anybody! That's flat! - Did I ever deny you anything? - Never mind the salve. - Do I get the costumes? - All right, of course. Of course. You didn't really mean to walk out on me just for a few costumes. Rather than send beautiful girls out in those, I'd let them go on naked. You know, Papa, that's a swell idea. It's the same idea that got you kicked out of school. Come on, girls. On the stage. Junior! Yes, Papa. Come in. - Mr. Bradley... - Go away, I can't see anyone. I'm busy. - But I have a... - I told you to go away. Go away. All right, but there's a letter here from Mr. Tod Newton. Why didn't you say so in the first place? - Newton. Tod Newton. - Tod Newton. - Show the lady in. Show the lady in. - Yes, sir. This Tod Newton has a lot of money. Maybe we'll get some good costumes after all. My boy, you're learning the business. Miss Barlow. Miss Barlow. How do you do? Why, this is wonderful. Why didn't you come in before? Well, your lady traffic cop out there had the signals against me. Oh, that's a shame. I'm sorry. - It won't happen again, I assure you. - Thank you. - Won't you sit down? - Yes, thank you. My son... I beg your pardon, you haven't met my son. - How do you do? - Mr. Bradley, Jr. Miss Barlow. Hello. Now, Miss Barlow, I think it would be best if you'd see Mr. Gallagher at once. - Yes, thank you. - Junior, will you escort Miss Barlow... - down to Mr. Gallagher on the stage? - Thank you. - Mr. Gallagher is our director. - Oh, I know. And we're always looking for fresh talent. - You can sing and dance, I suppose? - Yes, sir. - But, Papa, how about her rhythm? - That's Gallagher's job, not yours. Tell him a dear friend of mine sent Miss Barlow. Thank you so much. Now, Junior, be sure you take good care of our little friend. Let out on your long line a little bit, will you? When do you write your column, Ward? You're always hanging around here or some other dump. - Well, it gets written, doesn't it? - I wouldn't know. I don't get much time to read gossip. Speaking of gossip, what's new? You ought to know. I suppose you got that story about one of our girls and the Ambassador? No, no, what's that? - Got a pencil around here? - No, I haven't. Well, never mind. - When do you start rehearsals? - Next Monday. - Boy, I'd rather start boxing with Carnera. - Here comes love! - Hello, Ward. - The rest of the name is King, my son. That's all right. Call me Junior. A very important friend of Papa's sent a girl around for you. Papa wants you to take care of her. She's outside. I get it. One of those. So Papa wants me to give her a tryout, huh? - Steve. Steve! - Yeah, boss. Yeah. Steve, a very important friend of Papa's... has brought around a very important young lady for a very important tryout. - Have you got any? - Yes. I think we just have one left. Steve will take care of her. - The old brush off? - Yeah, that's the way it goes. These very important friends... who want to put their dames in the front row... so they can show their friends how well they can pick them. Say, who is this very important friend of Papa's, anyhow? You can just say a certain young man in the money... and you won't be very far wrong. Fine, fine. Oh, well, never mind. Got your music? Is that all I get, a piano? The last audition I gave I had a 40 piece orchestra. All right, little lady, we'll dig up Paul Whiteman for you. - That'll be swell. - Wait a minute. If you want a tryout, get your rehearsal clothes. - I didn't bring any with me. - The wardrobe lady will give them to you. - Okay, boss. Okay. - Hurry up. Do you want Junior to help you? No, thanks. Junior has enough to do to dress himself. Hey, you mugs! Come here. Okay, boss. - Listen, fellows. - What's the matter? - We're going to have an audition. - A raw edition? No, an audition! You heard me. - See that girl that went upstairs? - Yeah. We're going to give her the brush off. - The brush off? - Yeah. - Same instruments. - No instruments, we're going to sing. Oh, you'll never know Just what you start You start with me, I'll break... - That was a B flat? - Yeah. - Sing it. - Yeah. What do you know about music? You're talking to one of the best musicians in the country! How are you in the city? Oh, you Boys, listen, I'm wrong. We're not gonna sing it, we're gonna play it. Get the instruments. You heard me, didn't you? - We could sing it. - You know I'm the boss, don't you? - Get organized now, come on. - Okay. - Get the chairs. Get organized. - Okay. - You ready? Right. - Right. - Right. - Right. - Right. - Right. Stop. Stop. Everything's all right, isn't it? - Yeah. - I'm going to count off. - One, two. - Button your shoe. - Three, four. - Close the door. - Five, six. - Brush her off. Hey, here she comes now. All right, fellows. Come on. Get organized. Right. Right. - What can we do for you? - Well, what have you got? - We got plenty. - All right, let me have it. I'll need a little more room, though. You'll get it. All right, fellows, break it up. Spread out! That's it. - Faster, please. - Faster, the lady wants it faster. Slower. Slower. Give it to her slower. Help the lady out. Help the lady out, will you. That's it. - All right, a little step on now, fellows. - Careful. Sit down, fellows, sit down. Say, Curly, help the lady out, will you? Okay, boys, I get it. It's the brush off, huh? Okay. All right, hold it a minute, will you? Okay, bruiser, the first round's yours, but I'm not licked yet. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, will you? Say, listen, Paderewski... do them funny noises come out of you or the piano? Boss, come here, will you? Boss, come here! - What do you want? - Boss, come here. This girl's got plenty of talent. Oh, Steve, don't be like that. I'm busy, I haven't... You got confidence in me, haven't you? Look, come on with me, will you? All right, all right, we've got nothing to lose. Come on. Very, very clever. There she is. Oh, you. - Get her out of here. - Wait a minute, boss. - Steve, I haven't... - Boss, she's got plenty of talent! Listen to me, just watch her once, will you, please? All right, let's see what you can do. Steve, same instruments? Get out of here. Take those chairs and get out of here. Get out of here. This is on the level, now, play it, don't fake it! Go ahead. Say, Junior, you don't happen to know the name... of that important friend of Papa's, do you? Sure, I know. Got a pencil? No. - Well, don't you want to know his name? - No, no, let it ride. All right. Report for rehearsal next Monday. - Oh, Mr. Gallagher... - And don't follow me anymore! Yes, sir. Steve, stick her in the front line with the Closser unit. Yeah, boss. You sure have got rhythm, baby. Yeah, well, keep your hands off it. What is this? Can't you quit shadowing me now that you've got your job? I'm not shadowing you now, Mr. Gallagher... I just wanted to thank you for the break. All right, all right, thank me. You may not think it's such a break when I get through working you. Listen, I've been through the mill already. Why, I've worked in cheap vaudeville, one night stands, honky-tonks, burlesque... Well, what do you want? To be made an Eagle Girl Scout for it? I've been through the mill, too. I've played honky-tonks. But that isn't it. It's just that you can't scare me away... from my first break by threatening to work me. - You like to dance? - Oh, I love it. Well, it's good you do. You may be a natural, you may be a flop. You can't ever tell. - Takes years and years of hard work. - I'm not afraid of work. - Takes guts and brains. - Yeah, I know. After you've given everything maybe something will come of it. - Maybe nothing. - Something's got to come of it. - I suppose if you feel you got it, you got it. - Yeah. - You like to dance? - More than anything in the world. - You want to work with me? - Yes, Mr. Gallagher. - Shake. - Yes, sir. - Now, beat it! - Thank you! How about a little drink to our partnership, Mr. Newton? All right. Now remember, this is just a private deal between you and me. My friends wouldn't understand an investment of this kind. They don't want me contaminated by show people. It's Q.T. With me. I won't tell a soul. By the way, do these girls get paid during rehearsals? Well, not as a rule. But in Miss Barlow's case, I think it could be arranged. Fine, charge it to me. But don't say anything about it to... Or anybody. - Well, here we are. - Thanks. Hey, look, would it be all right if I gave a little party... for the whole company tomorrow night? Why the whole company, Mr. Newton? Well, I've tried working it alone, doesn't seem to get very far. I see. It might work better in a crowd, huh? But don't expect Gallagher. When he's directing a show, he never goes out. That's okay. This is one show I'll direct myself. The more I'm with you, the more I can see My love is yours alone You came and captured a heart that was free Now I've nothing I can call my own Everything I have is yours You're part of me Everything I have is yours My destiny I would gladly give the sun to you If the sun were only mine I would gladly give the earth to you And the stars that shine Everything that I possess, I offer you That my dream of happiness come true I'd be happy just to spend my life Waiting at your beck and call Everything I have is yours My life My all Goody, goody, champagne. You know, this is my first time to one of these doggy parties in years. They're all right. And at that, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Janie. She made me stop hoofing and start cooking. We got a little joint around the corner from Broadway. Broadway isn't what it used to be in the old days, you know. Churchill's, Reisenweber's, the old Madison Square Garden, all gone. I heard of them. Did you know New York when they was here? No, I was working on the Kansas City Star in those days. - Do you like gardenias? - I love them. I could take you in my yacht to Tahiti where they grow wild, millions of them. - Hoping I'd go wild, too, huh? - Might do you a world of good, Janie. Tod, dance me toward the bedroom, will you? I want to get my coat. I'm going home. Come on, let's dance. You think you're a dancer, huh? You'll never be an artist until you find out what life's about. You ought to open up an art school for chorus girls. Oh, excuse us. There goes your great artist. Is this the only way I can get you in my arms? - Janie? - Yes, Tod? Is it? No. We can always dance. What are you doing with me, a striptease? Tod! Janie. I must go home, Tod. You sure about that? Sure. They were all at the party last night... just because you said they could stay in bed and rest up this morning. - They were in bed all right. - All right, Steve, I know all about it. I can't play nursemaid to a hundred girls. If they're tired for rehearsal this afternoon, that's their hard luck! - I'll be up in the gym. - Listen, boss, I want to ask you something. What's the matter? Sore because you weren't asked to the party? No, not exactly that, but tell me, why am I a social failure? - Ask your best friend. - Even he won't tell me! Wait a minute, what is all this? What are you doing up here? Oh, it's you. I might have known wherever there's anything private I'd find you around. I just sneaked up to get a little workout. What's the matter, the one at the party last night wasn't so good, huh? If you're so interested in our private affairs... why don't you come and see? I don't mix business with pleasure. Well, it'd be a pleasure to me if you'd mind your own business. Yeah? Say, listen. It's my business to see that you gals keep your shapes, Duchess! You mean, to see that we don't give them away. Listen... I don't give a rap about your private life, only as to how it affects me. Then stop handing out sarcastic orders. It doesn't affect you at all. Say listen, did you ever take a look at a dame who's been out too many nights? The customers out front just love it. Will you stop beefing. You're not on the stage now. - Why don't you watch yourself? - Why don't you... Feel better? Well, what do you know about that? He can actually smile. You look nice when you smile. Why don't you try it a little more often? Come on. Come on. Play ball. Okay, you asked for it. - Say, are you doing that on purpose? - Oh, I'm sorry. Pretty ambitious, huh? Getting up so early after a night out. - A lot of sleep'd done you more good. - I left early. Yeah? Well, keep up the good work. Maybe I'll give you a specialty number all for yourself. - Gee, really? - Save it. Save it. You haven't got it yet. - Shoulder feel all right now? - It feels swell when you rub it. Oh, no, you don't. It was nice you could get away. Yeah. Mr. Gallagher traded me the afternoon for working all night. That was kind of him. I nearly forgot. Got something for you. - I only owe you $25 now. - Are you still at it? Until the last dime is paid, Shylock. Tod, I'm scared. Come on, now. Just be yourself. And remember, don't bite or scratch no matter what happens. Go on, now. Don't worry. Gee, this is a swell... place. - Who's that? - That's one of the early Newtons. He fought in the Revolution. Looks like he started it. You talking about those darned old Newtons again? He blew the top of his head off with a duck gun. You never heard of anything like that from my side of the family. This is my grandmother on my mother's side. Mrs. Todhunter. She's quite deaf, but she's the real thing. - Nanny, this is Janie Barlow. - What? I'll have to write it for her. So a Newton's brought a woman into this house finally. This is Janie Barlow. Nice girl, isn't she? When's the wedding? Oh, but you... Now, there's no use answering her. Looks like good, healthy stock. You know, Tod, I didn't think you had it in you. You know, we Todhunters knew how to pick the women. It was the Newtons who were always a bit finicky. - All right, darling, all right. - Well, they were. You know, I know what I'm talking about. - Tod! - Hello, kid. I thought I heard your car. Janie Barlow, this is my sister, Grace. - How do you do? - Hello. - I'm so glad to know you. - Thanks. - And that's all the family there is. - Tod! Yes, Nanny. Well, don't yell like that. I ain't so deaf. You know you might have telephoned. I could have prepared a little. - All we want is a swim. - Him? - What him? Who? - A swim. Why didn't you say so? I'll have Charles fix something down at the lake. - You like it? - Love it. - Afraid? - Of what? The country. - I'm used to it. - How so? I milked a cow once. What kind of a cow was it, a Jersey or Guernsey? I don't know. I didn't see the license plate. Gee, this is a swell place. You got everything in it. All you need's a piano. How'd you like to look for a house and furniture? Let's talk sense. We want to be friends. We can't be unless you keep it on a sensible basis. I'm suggesting a dandy basis. Here, drink some of this. Maybe it'll make you see things the way I do. No, thanks. Everything's beautiful just as it is. - Come on in. - I don't like to mix my drinks. The water's nice. All right, you take the exercise for both of us. Come on in. For a guy that's had as much practice as you, you're a pretty poor shot. Is that so? Mr. Newton. This is so sudden. I learned that in the Navy. I'll have to get myself a diver's suit. You'll never get one to fit you like the one you got on. You know, you're too versatile to be working just on land. Why don't you find yourself a nice mermaid? I've tried mermaids. They can't dance well enough. And I dance and that's all. It can't be very much fun for you... going around with a girl whose dancing is her career. There are other careers besides dancing. - Not for me. - Marriage is a career. - Marriage? - Sure. I'll buy a ring and a license if it'll make everything cozier. I didn't know you meant that, Tod. Neither did I. It just occurred to me down there in the water. Sold? No. - I don't want to marry. - You mean, you don't want to marry me. I don't want to promise to marry anyone yet, Tod. I've got a job to go through with first. - Not very much of a job is it? - I don't know. Might be. Mr. Gallagher's promised me a chance at a specialty number. And if I make good at that and the show's a big hit... it would mean everything to me. And what if the show isn't a hit or if you don't make good? Well, then I guess... It's got to be a hit. I'll never get such a chance again. - My whole career depends on it. - Your whole dancing career, you mean. Well. Janie, suppose this big job of yours turns out to be not so big as you think... would you marry me then? We love each other enough, don't we? I think so, Tod, but... The only ""but"" is whether or not the show gets over. If it does, you stick to show business. If it doesn't, you stick to me. For life. Please say yes. Please. Hey, look what Ward King says in his column. ""It is rumored that one of the new girls in the forthcoming Bradley production... ""soon will go to the altar with a gay blade... ""from the social register section of our town."" What does she do, hypnotize them? - What has that Barlow dame got? - Eyes, that's all. Can't do it with eyes, my dear. Maybe she's got a book that tells about it. I've tried everything but a blackjack. I'm going to talk to Papa about you tonight. Anything I say goes. Break it up. Get out of the nursery. You, get in your overalls. Say, do you realize to whom you're speaking? I'm democratic, I speak to everybody. - I'll speak to Papa about you. - Go on, you big tom-boy. All right, girls, on your feet. Come on, everybody. - The Duchess! - Yeah, that's right. - You know we got a rehearsal today? - Have we? Steve, this is my roommate, Rosie LaRue. - Take good care of her, will you? - She needs it. - I'll be down in a minute, Rosie. - Okay. Say, I remember you. The third girl from the left in the Florodora Sextette. You want a wheelchair? No, thanks. I'll just take one of your crutches. - Morning, Cyclone. - The Duchess. - All right, Steve. - All right, boss. Let's get going. Get the girls down for the Bavarian number, will you? - Okay. Excuse me. - Goodbye, handsome. What, are you getting sentimental? All right, girls, the Bavarian number! Quiet! Girls, quiet! Come on, girls, Mr. Gallagher's waiting. - Why don't you knock? - What for? You ain't got nothing to hide. Come on, girls, everybody. Come on, now. Come on, stop that kidding. Stop that playing cards. Come on. Come on, girls, everybody down. Come on, the beer number. Come on, girls. What's the matter with you? Stop that, will you? Take this, will you? Everything will be ready in a minute, Mr. Gallagher. - All right, Steve. - All right, girls, come on. Come on. On your feet, everybody now. Come on. Jessie, take care of these girls, will you? All right, come on, girls, the beer number. Hello, Duchess. Hello, Mr. G. How many nip-ups today? I feel pretty light on my feet. Yeah, how did you get that way? The session in the speakeasies last night? No. A nice, quiet evening in the open. Trees and a lake and all that sort of thing. - Out with the rich folks? - Just one rich folk! One's usually enough. Do you think you could bring yourself down to do a little work now? Let's go. - Oh, democratic, too? - Yeah! If you'd told us where you were... we'd have brought the company out there to rehearse. - Come on, Steve, let's have it. - All right, Miss Warner, this is for you. - Hey, give me a pickup. - All right, come on, girls. Hey, listen, boys... - you're the authors of this show? - Yeah. - Do you like it? - I think it's splendid. - Certainly. - It looks great. Well, that's too bad. Because it's going to be changed. - You can't do that without our say-so. - We've got our rights. It's in our contract. It's in my contract, that I don't have to put on a turkey! What I say goes. Mr. Gallagher, I might say I've been expecting something like this. Now, don't irritate Pinky. You know how he is. Sure, sure. I know how he is. I had a cousin like him once. We had to shoot him. What's wrong, Mr. Gallagher? What's wrong? Tell us that. You tell me what's right. The whole thing's terrible. It all has to be re-written. You're crucifying me! Now, don't get excited, Pinky. He isn't worth it. Don't go to pieces, Pinky. Don't go to pieces! Oh, come on, come on. Get back on your nest. Then just what is your idea, Mr. Patch? My idea would be to write a whole new show. - Oh! You're crucifying me. - Now, listen! This show as it stands is Spanish-American War stuff. Country girl, city slicker, oatmeal, butterflies! You can't get by with that sort of thing today! You gotta give them something out of modern everyday life. - Something out of the city streets. - I'll kill myself. Give them the slums, burlesque shows, riveting machines. A girl who has to beat time to the city's rhythm. A girl who craves to dance. Do you get it? - How can Vivian Warner do that? - Vivian Warner isn't going to do it! - All right, break it up, break it up! - Break it up, break it up! - Barlow? - Yes, sir. In my office. I've got a few things to say to you. Yes, sir. Steve. Finish this and tell them all except Warner to be back here at 8.00 tonight. - You don't want Warner? - No, without Warner. Listen, everybody, we'll run through this number once more... and that'll be all for this afternoon. Mr. Bradley wants to see Mr. Bradley, Jr. Right away. It's very important. Babe. If you see Junior, tell him Papa wants him. Yes, sir. Papa wants you, Junior. - I've been thinking things over. - Yes, sir. You're through with the unit. Sorry I didn't make the grade, Mr. Gallagher. - I worked awfully hard... - That's right. That's why I'm taking you out of the unit. - Why? Because I worked hard? - No. Because I want to put you on the top spot. - The what? - The top spot. - Top spot? - Yes, yes, yes, the top spot. Where if you drop, you've got twice as far to fall. Well, maybe I'm a sap for trying it... and maybe I can make something out of you... if you can stand up when I get through with you. I've got good legs, Mr. Gallagher. Yes, so I've noticed. But don't let them run away with you. I won't. I'm sticking right here. Well, don't. Go on home. Clear all this stuff out of your mind and be back here at 8:00 tonight. Gee, I don't know what to say, Mr. Gallagher. - You don't know how much... - Save it, save it. Yes, sir. Shake? - And now, will you... - Beat it. Yeah, I know. I'll beat it. My dancing lady, there's nobody like you You find such pleasure in doing what you do A change in music and suddenly you start That little syncopated beat in your heart You look inspired That's one of your great charms And when you're tired start dancing in my arms After a while, dear These two happy feet will beat down the aisle, dear My dancing lady to you When I look at you in admiration Wondering where I got the luck Landing someone quite so grand When so many folks get stuck You're supply of everything that's needed Just meets my demand Pardon if I seem to gush But I say without a blush After a while, dear These two happy feet will beat down the aisle, dear My dancing lady, to you All right, girls and boys, come on, now break it up. That's all. All right, break it up, everybody. Take a rest now. - What's the matter, cramp? - A little. It's all right, though. - Routine on that number's not bad. - Thanks. - Needs a little cleaning up, though. - You're telling me. - Sure you're all right? - Yes, sir. - Don't want to quit? - No, sir. Do you feel like going through that opening number with Mr. Astaire? All right. - Freddy. - Yes, Patch. Show Miss Barlow the routine on that opening number, will you? - I'd love to. - Good evening, Mr. Astaire. Miss Barlow. Do you know the routine? - I've seen it often enough, I'll try. - That's fine. Harry, give us the pickup on that gang number, would you, please. - Yeah, yeah. - Thanks. How does that Barlow get to take Warner's place? Didn't you ever hear of personality? - All right, girls, stand back, stand back! - Help me take her in my office. Boss, I'll carry her. - I always wanted to be a hero. - Steve, take her in my office. Come on, girls, get back. Get back! All right, Paley, go ahead with that number. Come on, girls, now, snap into it. Take her right in here. - All right, get me the liniment, Jess. - Yes, sir. - It's over there, Jess. - Come on, let's get the shoe off. - Oh, take it easy. - Yeah, all right. There you are. Come on now, let's straighten it out. - Come on, let go. - I can't. Yes, you can. Come on, let go. That's it. Oh, that's better. That's fine. - Give me the liniment, Jess. - Yes, sir. - You know, I had a charley horse once. - It hurt, didn't it? - Certainly it hurt. - There, is that better? - All right, boys... - Yeah. ...get them back to rehearsal. - Shall I take them, Steve? - No, I'll take them. - They got more confidence in me. - Oh. Sorry. Better keep it straight now. That's it. Come on, keep it straight. This is going to hurt a little. Let it go easy now, right back. That's it. Wriggle your toe. What kind of a gang are you running with? What do you mean? I see a lot of cracks in Ward King's column about you. It's no fun sitting at home all the time. No, I suppose not. What are you going to do, marry into dough? - I don't know. - Well, don't do it. Those guys are a lot of silk hats and silk socks with nothing between. That's what all these dames fall for. Don't let it fool you. It never works out. But... Dancing is your racket, Duchess. I know it. I'm not going to run out on you. I'm not getting married. Is that on the level? Sure. You mean that, Duchess? Sure, I mean it. I'm not going to quit on you after all you've done for me. What do you take me for, anyway? - You think you can make it now? - Yes, sir. Well, all right, on your feet, on your feet. Sure you're all right? Well, let's see you walk. All right? Well, what are you waiting for? Come on. All right, Steve, come on. Get them in their places for the Dancing Lady number. All right, boss. Come on, girls. You heel-beaters. Come on now. Come on, get up. - Come on, now. - Everybody, now, everybody. - Come on, girls, please. - Come on, move fast. All right, Harry, drop that puzzle. Give me a pickup here. All right, break it up, break it up! Just a minute. Come here, everybody. This concerns you so you may as well hear it now. ""Have decided to give up production for this season owing to ill health. ""Stop. ""Am on way to South of France. Stop. ""Dismiss company immediately. Stop. - ""Junior sends best."" - Stop. Signed, Jasper Bradley. So, Junior sends best, a charming fellow. He can't mean that. He can't do that to us. No? You don't know Jasper Bradley. - Isn't there anything we can do? - Sure, we can go home and forget about it. I'm awful sorry, Mr. Gallagher. Save it, Duchess, save it. What seems to be the matter? We just got word, they're closing the show. Oh, that's too bad. I guess I'd better get out of these. I look kind of silly in them now. I'll be down in a minute. Well, that takes care of the 40-hour-week, all right. My folks begged me not to become an actress. Your folks needn't worry, you didn't. You ready, Janie? Yeah, I'm ready. And for what? Well, it might be something pretty nice if you just relax a little. I don't want to rush you into anything. We'll talk about getting married when we get back from the cruise. Cruise? Where are we cruising, up and down Sixth Avenue? No, Cuba. I thought a little sea air might do you good. And Grandma thought so, too. She's coming along to chaperone... or maybe you'll chaperone Grandma. And you can bring anyone along you'd like to. Rosette, if you want, in case I bore you. Rosette would love Cuba or vice versa. - Come on. - Wait a minute. - I want to see Patch. - All right. Come in. Come in. Oh, it's you. I thought you'd gone. I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciated everything... even though it didn't work out. Oh, that's all right. I've been in this racket for years. If you don't get a good break, you get a bad one. That's show business. What are you going to do? - Keep a promise. - Marriage? Maybe. I get it. Well, goodbye. - Goodbye. Lots of luck. - Thanks, I'll be seeing you. Sure, sure. We'll sit around the fire, whittle sticks... and talk about a girl who traded Broadway for Park Avenue. You shouldn't have said that, Patch. No, no, I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said anything to you but ""beat it,"" the day you came in here. Why did you say that to me, Patch? I won't go this way. I couldn't leave knowing the way you feel. Oh, get out of here, I told you to beat it, didn't I? I can't go. I don't want you to think I'm letting you down. Please. Okay, Duchess. Better luck with his show than you had with mine. Thanks. You ready? Not a bad jill at that, boss. - What? - The girl. Well, boss, looks like we're heading for the warehouse. Yeah? - Well, we're not. - What do you mean? Listen, Steve, Bradley can't do this to me. I'm going to carry this show myself. I'm gonna produce it. I got some dough, and what I haven't got, I'll get. I'll hock my car, my clothes, my house, everything. That's great. And I got some money I've been hoarding... against the next depression and you can have every dime of it! - All right, drag it out. Get ahold of Warner. - Okay, boss. - Warner? How about that Barlow dame? - Oh, let her go! She's gone Park Avenue. Say, listen, Steve, from now on... this is one theater those guys get into only on a ticket. Get those people back for rehearsal tomorrow morning as usual. That's great, boss. Girls, girls, don't go way. Girls! Hey, Grandma, here's mud in your eye. Pie? Who wants pie in a place like this? Grandma, you're getting to be a cut-up. Having fun? That's a swell dance. - It's a little bit uncivilized, though. - Maybe that's why it's so beautiful. It isn't loaded down by a lot of... - Drop it. - Okay. - Where do we go from here? - Tod, let's go home. - New York? - Yeah. That's the rhythm of the day - All right, break it up, break it up! - Break it up, break it up! - Warner. - Yes, Mr. Gallagher. I just wanted to make sure that you understood this is a dancing number. - I was under the impression I was dancing. - Yeah? Well, that just shows how we can all get the wrong impression sometimes. My mistake! That's not your first mistake, Mr. Gallagher. - No. My first mistake was... - Was what? Oh, let it go, let it go. Start at it again, Steve. - Listen, boss. - Steve, I'm not gonna stand for that! - I'll quit, so help me, I'll quit! - Miss Warner, he's a little tired. You know the show can't get on without you. You're an absolute sensation. - Well, I'll give him just one more chance. - Thanks. You're a brick. Come on. Say, I got a letter here from Junior Bradley. And I guess it's down at the office. Anyway, he said that before his old man blew out on the show... you were going to put the Barlow girl into Miss Warner's place. Anything in that? - Oh, what difference does it make now? - Well, it don't make sense. What don't make sense? Well, he said... Gosh, I wish I had that letter. Well, anyway, he said that the reason his old man blew out on the show... was that Tod Newton paid him a lot of money to close it. What? - Say that again, I don't follow. - Well, neither do I. Now, look, the Barlow girl is Newton's sweetie. So, why should he buy out a show and close it... and take her away to Cuba just as she's about to get a good break? Doesn't make sense. Yeah. It makes sense all right. Well, I guess there's something about it I don't understand. You figure it out. - Steve. - Yeah, boss. Yeah. Take over this rehearsal. I'm going out and get a drink. Oh, boss, I can't handle this. You got a hippodrome here. Do whatever you want to do with it. I don't care. Boss, listen, please. We got a dress rehearsal coming up. - We open in a week. - A week? - Lucky if we open at all. - But, boss. I see they're opening Dancing Lady cold tomorrow night. - Maybe it's something hot. - Maybe it's shortage of dough. Champagne cocktails, six. None for me, Tod. I'm not thirsty. I get it. When a lady says she isn't thirsty... she means all she can drink is champagne cocktails. You ought to write a book about what women want. Come on, it'll help your sea-legs. I can still feel the motion of that boat. That's what you call it. Patch. What? What? Well, if it isn't the Duchess herself? - Is that all you have to say to me? - Oh, leave me alone. Scotch, straight. Patch, what's the matter with you? - Me? Nothing's the matter with me. - Hello, Gallagher. Well, well, if it isn't the other half of the firm. Back from Havana so soon? Somebody close your show, too? Are you trying to be funny, Patch? Tod's not in the show business. Another. - He's not in the show-business, huh? - Come on away, Janie. He's just a little... I'm a little drunk. Is that what you're trying to say? Well, drunk or sober, my hat's still off to you. There are more ways than one to close a show and you've taught me a new one. - That's enough, Gallagher. - Hey, wait a minute. What's the matter? Afraid your boyfriend will get a poke in the jaw... for throwing a hundred people out of work... just so he could take you on a joyride to Cuba? - I don't know what you're talking about. - No? Not much. You got paid for rehearsing. Nobody else did. - You didn't think Bradley gave you that? - Shut up, Gallagher. - Say, what is this? - Oh, you don't savvy? - No. - Well, maybe I ought to speak Cuban. But it's the same in any language. I suppose you don't know that your boyfriend here... paid Bradley to close the show. You can settle that with me, Gallagher. Janie had nothing to do with it. - Tod, did you? - Oh, yes, Tod did. And I'd like to take Tod over to the theater right now... and feed him to the boys and girls for breakfast. - They need something to eat. - Mr. Gallagher. Well, the show opens tomorrow night and on my dough. Mr. Gallagher, quiet, please! All right, Joe. All right. I'm not gonna tear up your joint. But you better be careful who you let in here. The place will be getting a bad name. - Oh, Janie. - Tod, did you do that? Sure. It was the only way I could get you. - You don't know what you've done. - I loved a girl. I wanted to marry her. All I did was make sure I could marry her. Yes, and incidentally threw a hundred other people out of work. I didn't see it that way. I'm sorry. It's a little late for that now, I'm afraid. - Janie, l... - I'll see you later, Tod. Wait a minute. The boss is all steamed up, and this ain't no Turkish bath. - Get out of my way. - No, wait a second. No auditions today. You're in a new show now. Listen, bruiser, I'm mad and I'm not fighting according to rules. The boss is in enough trouble without you. You see? What is all this? - Patch, I want to talk to you. - What? - You've got the wrong address, sister. - You gotta listen to me. I didn't know anything about that, honest I didn't. Don't give me that. Do you think I'd do that to you and the rest of them? Would I do it to myself? Patch, listen! If you don't believe me about the others, you've got to believe me about myself. I wouldn't sell out my one chance. Oh, it's not only you, it's everything. Even the creditors are wise. Hanging around like a pack of hungry wolves. But don't you see, if you could show them a hit... You can't kid them. I'll be lucky if they let the curtain go up. They know a hit from a bust. Oh, Patch, if it's going to be a bust, let me be there when it happens. It's too late. We open tomorrow night. But I know the routines. Please let me go back in. Forget about it, Duchess. It can't be done. Life's too short. So the great Patch Gallagher's laying down. So, life's too short? So the first opus he's got his own dough in is a flop! Well, the wisies on Broadway will say it wasn't Gallagher, it was Bradley! - What? - Without Bradley, Gallagher's a washout! - What was that Bradley crack? - That's what they'll say. They'll put you on the pan and keep you there till Bradley takes you off! I've got a notion to... If that's what it takes to get you on your feet, go ahead! - What are you looking for, boss? - I'm looking for that opening number. - Here it is. - Well, all right, put it on! - How about that Warner dame? - Put her back where she belongs. Say, that place has been closed for years. - Say you know those routines? - Sure I do. All right, get out of that back drop and let's see them. - Right. - Right. - Let's go! - Right away.

Great show. - Certainly enjoyed it, Patch. - It's all right with me though. Think you've got a hit. Well, you double-crossed me, Janie. You're a success. You were marvelous. Believe now that dancing is my racket, Tod? Well, I'll give in if you will, Janie. Marry me. You can still go on with this. You can have your cake and eat it, too. Tod, I love to say ""can it"" and I... I love shoes with ribbons on them and I got a perfect passion for zippers. Well, you can put zippers on your sables, if you like. No. I'm afraid ""them things"" won't mix with ""those things."" - Steve. Steve! - Yes, boss. - I was just talking to one of the girls. - Yeah. Steve... tell Joe to dim down on that Dancing Lady number. Dim down on Dancing Lady. Yeah, but to follow Miss Barlow with an amber spot. - An amber spot. - Yeah. Yeah, an amber spot. And tomorrow night I'll try a rose spot. I get it. Miss Barlow. Top spot, amber spot, rose spot. Come in, come in. - Oh, you're busy. Excuse me. - No, that's all right. Come in. Oh, and Steve... during that dramatic bit tell them to follow Miss Barlow with a blue spot. - A blue spot? - Yeah. - Blue. - Good night. - Good night, boss. - Good night, Duchess. Night, Steve. White spot, amber spot, blue spot. Looks like you're in a spot. - Sure glad that first night's over. - Yeah. I saw your face once in the wings. Made me feel as if everything I was doing was wrong. I guess I got that kind of a face. You better go home and get some rest. And don't stay out too late with your boyfriend. He's gone. Yeah. Until tomorrow night. He's gone for good, Patch. Say, what is this you're dishing out? Can't you take it? English Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Go on, take a card, any card at all. Now look at it. Put it back. Ace of spades. - When did you change the act, Pop? - I didn't. He did. He did? Yes, he said straight magic is too old-fashioned. Wait a minute, take a bow. No, you take it. I got to get married. Come here, they're applauding you. They like it. Lucky. Now what? - I want to reason with you, if I can. - But you already did. Have you really made up your mind to leave me... just to marry some girl you happen to know? It's kind of customary to know the bride, isn't it? I hate to see you leave show business. A man with your talents... My talent is gambling, Pop. Hoofing is all right, but there's no future in it. I want to spread out. I think I'm going to miss you, Lucky. I know I'm going to miss you, Pop. Is he staying with us, Pop? No, he's made up his mind to get married. How do you like that? Letting his marriage interfere with our career? We shouldn't have played his hometown. It was a bad move. Bad for us and bad for him. Local boy makes bad. - Father, has he come yet? - No, and it's all very much as I expected. Hi, fellows. - How do I look? - Marvelous, colossal, splendid. Wait a minute. You're not going like that. Of course. Big church wedding, girl's family very social... whole town there. I guess it doesn't really matter, just a hick town. What doesn't matter? - Last year's trousers. - Last year's trousers? No cuffs. - No cuffs? - No cuffs. Whoever heard of cuffs on these? Are you serious? Don't be ridiculous. - Maybe he's wrong. - Wait a minute. Let's see that. - What do you think of that? - You know, you're in a hurry and... Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone. Just a minute. I'll answer it for you. It will only take about five minutes. Let us have your pants. - Hello. - Hello, John. Will you hurry? Tell him the minister is here. Margaret's been ready for an hour. We're all waiting for him. All right, I'll tell him. - Who was it? - It was the minister. He said to take it easy. He'll be about a half-hour late. - Good. - You see, there's plenty of material. - I'll take them down and have them fixed. - No, you don't. Pop, take them to Schmidt's and have them back in five minutes. - You want two cuffs on them? - Yeah, one on each leg. And hurry up. Tell him I got to have them back right away. While we're waiting, we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport. I'll get seven. - The next man. - That's it. - Any word? - They say he'll be here any minute. You know, I told Margaret this would happen. I always say, marry in haste, repent at leisure. The young man is now one hour and 25 minutes late. That isn't exactly marrying in haste. As long as I am living, and longer... I have never seen cuffs on pants like these. What's the matter, can't you make them? I can make anything... but I would rather not be wrong than right. I'm paying for cuffs and I want cuffs. No. 10 times... 20 times, no. Can't you understand? Look, here, let me show you. Do you see any cuffs there? Not one cuff. Thousands of no cuffs. Here, look these over. You see? No cuffs. Millions of no cuffs. No cuffs. More than that, positively not one cuff. Why not? - I want to speak to Mr. Garnett. - Speaking. - Here he is, sir. - Let me talk to him. Say, listen, you, the guests are all going home and... I'm the happiest man in the world because the wedding is off. And furthermore, if you ever come to this house again... I'll break every bone in your body. Do you understand that? - Red, is that call for me? - No, it's my dame. Okay, sweetheart, and a great big juicy kiss for you. Wait a minute. Give me a chance to get my dough back. - Give us a roll. - Here it comes... You ought to marry those dice. Marry? Holy cats! What time is it? - Pop, my pants! - You've got them on. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute! You're not going with all our dough. I got to get married. I'll bet you the bankroll you don't get married. That's a bet. No cuffs. The tailor says those kind of pants shouldn't have cuffs. What? Nice fellows! Hello. Where's everybody? Why, the guests have all gone, sir. Did you wish to be announced? Just let me get my hands on that young man and I'll strangle him! You leave him to me. I'll take care of him. No, maybe I'd better surprise them. He can't do a thing like this to a daughter of mine. This is my affair, you keep out of it. I'm your father and I'll settle this as I see fit. We'll be the laughingstock of this whole town! So... Here I am. Young man, why didn't you appear for your wedding? I thought you'd ask me that. Don't stand there like a statue. You said you were gonna do something. Well, do it. What are you gonna do? Don't you dare touch him. - Why don't you do something? - I will. I will, but... Pardon me, I think I'm in the way. - Perhaps you two would like to be alone. - You stay right where you are. - I'm not finished with you yet. - I had a feeling you weren't. I wouldn't let you marry her for $10,000. - How about twenty? - Not for $20,000. - Twenty-five. - Not for... Say, young man, where could you get $25,000? By dancing? And there's another thing... coming back to your own hometown in a dancing act. I'm going into a new business. Only this afternoon I made $200. Yes, that's why I was late for the wedding. That makes it a little different. I'm not consenting to your wedding... but I always admire any young man that can make money. It shows character. - That's too kind of you, sir. - Not at all. Then Margaret and I can get married? If you go to New York and work hard at your business... and if you are successful... you can come back here and ask me for my Margaret. Oh, Daddy. And in all probability I'll be very happy to give her to you. Right, sir. Thank you, sir. John, dear. You'll come back soon, won't you? That all depends upon the stakes, the stocks... Goodbye, my son. Thank you, father-in-law. I'll say goodbye again because we'll both be waiting for you. Hurry back, dear. I feel that I'm a little to blame in this. You know, I didn't realize what a bright, upstanding young man you were. And I don't care how big the city, I feel confident... you're going to be successful. Thank you, sir. Lucky, couldn't I go with you? I'm afraid you'd try to be a good influence on me. No, honest I wouldn't. I'm terrible bad when you get to know me. Then I wouldn't want you to come with me. One to New York, please. - Whose money are you using? - Yours, thank you very much. But our money belongs to us again. What's the idea? Remember our bet? You see, you didn't get married. - I'll pay you later. - No. All aboard! - But I've got to get that train. - You mean you had to get it. You know, you didn't win that lucky quarter. I'll flip you for a ticket to New York. I don't want to go to New York. He doesn't want to go to New York. Goodbye, Lucky, old boy. So long. - Goodbye, Lucky. - See you later. Give my regards to the folks, will you? Say hello to Aunt Lucy. So long. Goodbye, Lucky. Lucky, here's your suitcase. Here's your toothbrush. Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke. - Well, take the quarter. - No, sir, not the lucky one. Wait a minute. I'll get a smoke. I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please? Thank you. How careless of me. I left my cigarettes at home. Then you won't need the matches. I'm afraid that won't work, unless you have a needle and thread. Excuse me, have you change for a quarter? Thank you very much. You shouldn't have done that just for me. I could've gotten along without them. - You hold it. - All right. Looks like a jackpot. Go and get your lucky quarter back, quick. I beg your pardon. You probably think I'm silly. Yes, I'm afraid I do. Just a moment. That quarter, I wonder if I could have it back? This isn't getting you anywhere. You don't understand. I'm not trying to get acquainted. All I want to know is... It's all my fault, too. I'm awfully sorry. Yes, I know. You've been trying so hard to avoid me. All right, give it back. - Give what back? - The quarter you stole from my purse. Come on, will you? Hand it over or I'll call a policeman. I haven't got it. I gave it to you at the cigarette machine. - Officer. - Come on. Let's go, will you? No, wait a minute. What seems to be the trouble? Good morning, sir. Officer, this man stole a quarter from my purse. Make him give it back. Now, miss, does he look like a man who would steal quarters? - That's just what I said to the lady. - Imagine... I don't care what you think he looks like. I know he stole my quarter. Now you run along, sister... before I run you in for disturbing the peace. But, Officer, he took my... That'll be enough. Run along now, you're obstructing traffic. Why, you Cossack. Officer, you had no right to speak to that little girl that way. I suppose you're going to tell me what my duty is. Not at all, but... Listen, guys like you pay me to protect them from screwy dames. That's fine, but in this instance I'm sure you were wrong. So now I'm wrong. You ought to thank me for what I've done. - All right, thank you. - All right. What did you say? I said, look out for the great big ditch. Pop, why didn't you tell me you had it? In front of the cop? I would've been accused of stealing it. Give me that. Wait for me. Miss Carrol! Hello, kids. No wonder this school is losing money. Everybody late every morning. Any more dilly-dallying and some of you will lose your jobs. Yes, and that goes for you girls, too. Anybody would think I had nothing else to do, but nothing. One would. Miss Anderson, good morning. If you're late again, you'll be fired, too. That's final. I have nothing more to say. That's good. - Is that you, Mabel? - I don't know. Tell me, is it? - Kind of sounds like you. - That's a load off my mind. I'm never sure these days. - Did you see a young... - Visitors make the pupils self-conscious. Would you mind waiting a second, please? Thank you very much. Miss Anderson, come quickly. Please. He's hissing at me again, the swan. And good morning to you, too. - Are you interested in the dance? - I came here to see if I... All the world loves a dancer. To know how to dance... Is to know how to control oneself. Thanks. You saved me a lot of breath. Our course is $45. But the first lesson is given free... to see if the prospective student has any real aptitude. That's why our school is so successful. We never refuse the $45. - I mean... - You never let a pupil get away. I understand. We don't fool anybody. Have you any preference as to the type of instructress you'd like? Yes, I have. I'd like one that comes to about here. And if she had red hair, that would be a great help. And a cute little nose. She might be able to teach you to move your feet. Miss Anderson, my dear. Good morning. Me, too. - Mr. Gordon, this is Mr... - Garnett. How do you do, Mr. Garnett? I'm delighted, I assure you. - The young man would like a trial lesson. - Of course. I think Miss Carrol might please him. Of course, Miss Carrol. Come this way, will you? She's one of our best instructresses. You're a very fortunate young man to learn to dance... - to move... - To flirt with Terpsichore. Yes. What? How do you do? Do you mind if I wait here? - No, help yourself. - Thanks. I mean to the chair. Miss Carrol, this is Mr. Garnett. This is Miss Penelope Carrol. We're all so fond of her here, we just call her Penny. Penny, dear. - This is Mr. Garnett. - Penny. Miss Carrol. Mr. Garnett is very anxious to learn how to dance. So you won't always be stepping on other people's toes. - That's very good, isn't it? - Yes, that's very good. What kind of dancing would you like to learn? What kind have you got? - Sap. - Sap dancing? - No, she means tap dancing. - Tap dancing, of course. You see, we have tap dancing... and ballroom dancing and aesthetic dancing. If it's all the same to you, I'll take a little of each. A little of each, yes. Miss Carrol wants to know what kind you'd like to learn first? Whichever takes the longest. Go on, begin the lesson. You must learn to walk first. Now start with your right foot, please. - No, your right foot. - Sorry, I'm left-handed. Right, left. Miss Carrol, I'm sorry about your quarter. But you see, Penny... If you're trying to annoy me, you're succeeding. I know you don't care about dancing. But I do. All the world loves a dancer. Don't you? Right, left. - This is fun. - Now you turn. Start again. Right, left. If you don't get out of here, I'm going to lose my temper. If you talk like that, I'll call a policeman. - Why, you... - Officer... ""Our young ladies are sweet-tempered, patient and understanding. "" You're doing splendidly. I don't think you need me here any longer. I know I'm leaving you in good hands. Lovely hands. You know, that's the most marvelous trick I've ever seen a magician do. You mean the one with the four aces? No, the way you made my club sandwich disappear. Who, me? My dear young lady... You'd better take a club sandwich out of this hat. Are you accusing me of eating your sandwich? You might begin by taking that piece of lettuce off your necktie. One, two, three. Turn. Let's try it again from the beginning. One, two, three. Turn. - I'm getting it, aren't I? - Yes. Again. One, two, three. Turn. Now you've got it. I can't teach you anything. All right, I'll show you again. Remember, three steps to the left... three steps to the right and turn. One, two, three. Listen, no one could teach you to dance in a million years. - Take my advice and save your money. - Miss Carrol. How do you think this school can exist if you turn away applicants? - You're discharged. - But, Mr... Get your things and go. - But I... - Get out. That's quite all right, don't you worry. I'll find you another instructress. You stay right there. So this is the way you treat your customers? I certainly don't treat them to sandwiches. Get out of here. Miss Anderson, what is the meaning of this? What's gotten into everybody this morning? My sandwich got into him. You're fired. Okay, swivel puss. It might interest you to know that I've also discharged Miss Carrol. You've discharged Penny? Why? Why, for no reason at all. Please see her. But she said she couldn't teach you anything. She was trying to flatter me. She's the most wonderful little teacher I've ever heard of. Miss Carrol, I want to show Mr. Gordon how much you just taught me. No, never mind. Thank you. That's very sweet of you. I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this. It's an interesting experiment. How did you say that last step went? Shall we try it right through? Won't you sit down, Mr. Gordon? Wait! Sheer heaven, my dears, sheer heaven! - Is she still fired? - Fired? You took me too seriously, both of you. Just you wait there for one moment. Hey, he got her job back for her. Wasn't that swell? What one man can do, another man can. All right, Al. Thank you. Now listen, I've just made an appointment for you for a tryout... with Mr. Simpson, the owner of the Silver Sandal. The Silver Sandal! That's wonderful, isn't it? It certainly is. Penny, you wear your white lam gown. That's how I see you. You in white, and Mr. Garnett here in dinner clothes. - Dinner clothes? - Yes, certainly. You'll do it? You'll be there? Now do you think I could disappoint you? I'll be there. You are still fired! Pop, you can pay the cab. - Have you got change for $10? - I have. Thanks. Here you are, buddy. You keep that. Now I don't want you to worry about losing your job. I'll take care of you. Yes, but I'll take care of my own $10. Wouldn't you like to double it? Sure, I love to gamble if I'm sure I'm going to win. - The trouble is, you lose sometimes. - No. We always win. Why didn't you say that in the first place? That's fine then. I'll telephone you when I'm ready. - All right. - Where do you live? - Right here. - Since when? Since from now on. How am I going to get a dinner jacket for tonight? Don't worry about that. Look, I borrowed this from Mabel. You're marvelous. - How do you do? - How do you do? I want to get suite for myself and Mr. Cardetti, please. - Something at about... - Just about... Yes, that's about enough. Doctor, would you mind rushing down to the docks... to see if our trunks have passed through the customs yet? Just a moment. You may need my verification. - What size chest? - Chest? You mean that little chest. The one in the hold? Yeah. - That chest is 36 inches. How long do you intend to stay with us? That'll be entirely up to you. Did you get a dinner jacket? No, I went broke trying to win enough to buy you one. - What am I going to do? - Now don't worry. I got you the swellest looking outfit you ever saw in your life. Where is it? It looks like a perfect 36. I want you to meet my old friend, Eric... What's your name again? My name is Eric Lacanistram. I met Eric in the gambling house. He lost all his money, too. I lost all my money, too. - Eric just loves to gamble. - Really? It's in the Lacanistrams' blood. Yeah, he'll play you for his necktie or his shirt or anything he's got on. Well, I'll toss you for the whole outfit. No, I'm off pitch and toss. The Lacanistrams' game is piquet. Has been for years and years and years... before the conquest and then after the conquest... for years and years and years. In fact, we've been playing piquet for years... and years... - But I don't know piquet. - Don't worry, I do. Yes, Al. All right, goodbye. If we're not at the Silver Sandal in 10 minutes, the tryout's off. But 20 minutes ago, Lucky said he'd be here in five minutes. He's said that for the past hour. I'm gonna go get him. I wish you would. I feel like a fool. But you are. Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six and twenty-seven. And that's piquet, Mr. Garnett. Pop, you certainly did show me how to play piquet. You're doing fine. Fine? This fellow will have my skin in a minute. Come in. Penny! Listen, Penny. Look, Penny. Listen, let me explain. The clothes that I had before... When you're talking to a lady, you should take your hat off. Your petticoat's showing. Keep up the good work, boys. The public is with you. Mabel, will you get down from there and stop being ridiculous? Maybe you're the one that's being ridiculous. For a whole week you've been sulking at him for something that wasn't his fault. I suppose it was my fault. It's your fault that you're missing the tryout that Lucky arranged tonight. He's only doing it for you. You're not so smart, letting your stubbornness... interfere with the very thing you want. I like being stubborn where he's concerned. It must be love. How could I fall in love with a common gambler? When a man takes a little quarter... and builds it into a bankroll that would choke a horse... and makes my little $10 grow into hundreds... I'd call him an uncommon gambler. Come in, comrade. You, outside. My card. You're a big success. She's willing to arbitrate. I told you it would work. Mabel, will you tell that fellow to get out of the hall and stop annoying me? No, you sit down. You just hold your ground. Yes? Hello. - Penny. - You'd better get out of here. All right, I will. However, before I go, I want to tell you that maybe I was wrong the other night. But I didn't know it at the time. - So now you know. - Yes, I do. Goodbye. Wait a minute. Maybe, in a way, I might have been wrong. No, this one is on me. Listen, Lucky Garnett, there's no use arguing. - I'm not. - Yes, you are. All right, goodbye. Lucky, wait a minute. This concludes the Ricardo Romero Romantic Melody Hour. You know, I don't like that fellow. - He's very nice. - That? You have no reason to dislike him. You don't even know him. It's true, but when I dislike someone for no reason... I always find it more enjoyable. As a matter of fact, he's asked me to marry him several times. Of course you laughed. Or does he make you lose your sense of humor? - Ricardo. - Hello. I want you to meet Mr. Garnett. He's going to dance with me tonight. How do you do? I played that last number especially for you. Thank you. Now I know him and I still don't like him. Beautiful, isn't it? - What is? - The music. What music? - The music they're playing. - Yes. What made you think of it? - Think of what? - The music. I don't know. My mind was wandering, I guess. You as scared as I am? Don't be nervous. It's only a dance. It's nothing to worry about. That's right. Don't worry at all, my dear... because you're not going to dance. Because there isn't going to be any music. But, Ricky, you promised. I promised you could dance anytime you want, alone. I'll dance with Lucky or not at all. That's what I said, too, not at all. Good night. Come on, we'll see about that. - Mr. Simpson? - Hello, Garnett. Will you please tell Romero that he has to play for our dance? I'm sorry, but I can't. Romero's played his last tune for me. - But you said that... - I know I did. But I lost his contract last night playing cards. He's now the property of Dice Raymond. Orchestras usually play for somebody. This is the first I've heard of anybody playing for an orchestra. - I guess there's nothing we can do. - Wait a minute. Do you think we could interest Raymond in another game for that contract? I doubt it. He's always wanted Romero's band for his club... but he's a gambler. Where is this Raymond's place? Thirty-sixth floor, Club Raymond. Thirty-six. - Hello, Raymond. - Hello, Ricardo. Looks like a big night. Because where Ricardo Romero goes, the others come. Here goes everything on the red. Will you excuse me for a second? I think I need a bit of fresh air. - I can't stand the strain. - Wait a second. Twenty-seven, red, and third dozen. This is no strain. Please, don't be angry. I want to talk to you. I don't want to talk to you. I'm awfully sorry if I hurt you... but I didn't want to see anyone else dance with you. It makes me jealous. Jealous? Because... I love you. You have a very funny way of showing it. On the red. I want you to look at this new fellow. He's taking me, and fast. Say, if that hits for you, you'll have just exactly enough. Enough for what? Why, enough to go back and marry Margaret. What? Wait a minute. No bet. Seven. The red wins, and the first dozen. Pop, you're a pal. In fact, you're more than a pal... you're a partner. I'm going to cash in. So you won enough, you're going to leave us. Yes, winning more money doesn't interest me. Boy, you like to gamble. I'll cut you once, double or nothing. - No, thanks. - Scared? You have a contract with Romero, haven't you? I'll tell you what I will do. All my winnings against his contract. No, I win the orchestra... I keep the orchestra. Scared? You're on. I'll high-card you. Tony, bring a fresh deck. Keeps them on the ice. You're covered. Shuffle. - Cut. - After you. King of spades. Wait a minute. Let me, will you? Sure, let the old boy cut. Ace of spades. Excuse me, boys, I got to go and get a double sundae. Maybe we play for this orchestra again someday. Thank you, Mr. Raymond. Pop, cash in for me, will you? Okay, give us dough for these, will you? Maybe we can have that dance after all. - How? - Look, I just won Romero's contract. - That's a nice orchestra you have there. - Just about the best. - The leader's the same as the orchestra. - It's awfully nice of you to say that. I wonder if you'd be kind enough to play something for us... - if you don't mind. - But I do. I'm afraid you'll have to because, you see, I now own you. What do you mean, you own me? He just won you at the gambling tables. I see. Congratulations on winning such a valuable piece of property. Thank you. Now will you play your waltz for us? No. If you read the contract carefully... you will see I don't have to play after this hour unless I want to. So you won't play? You're right. I won't play for you. I see. That's all, boys. Ladies and gentlemen, my favorite maestro, Ricardo Romero... has very kindly requested that Ms. Carrol and I dance to his newest composition... the lovely Waltz in Swing Time. - Wait a minute. I didn't say... - Look, he wants to be coaxed. What's the matter, Ricky, old boy, you bashful? My pal. This is the moment I've been waiting for. - Wait a minute. Where are you going? - I'm going to get Pop. I'll get him. I mean, I'll do it for you. Sit still. What's the matter with Lucky? He seems to have something on his mind. You mean something else besides you? I don't know. I only get to see him at the rehearsals or with you and Pop... or when somebody else is around. Don't worry, darling. I'm going to see that you get a break this afternoon. Say, whose idea was this, anyway? Going to the country on a day like this. It was Mabel's, but she's made it mine. Listen, you got to do me a favor. No matter where we go or what we do, don't leave me alone with Penny. What's the matter, ain't you in love with her? You wouldn't pin me down with a question like that, would you? I see. Why, that's fine. Why don't you tell her? She's too sweet a kid, and besides that... I can't go on like this without her knowing something about Margaret... and I haven't got the nerve to come out and tell her, that's all. You don't have to go back to Margaret unless you get $25,000. Yeah, I know. So you haven't got it. So you don't have to go back. Yes, but it's more than money. I'm in a fine spot. - I'm going to take care of this. - Pop, no. - You better lay off gambling for a while. - But I don't want to lay off. - Hello, Lucky. - Hello, Mr. Simpson. I was looking for you. Have you seen the improvements? The decorators are working day and night, and when we're through... the Silver Sandal should be the finest place in town. And with you and Penny dancing to Romero's music... we're going to clean up. Yes, but I'm not sure I can stick around. Yes, you can. But you must. Look, if you're not satisfied with the terms... I'll make you a half partner. I'll give you 50%. That should make you about $30,000 for the season. My advice is to take 25% and be on the safe side. Let me see. 25%, that would give me $15,000. You're right. Not over 25%. - Is it a deal? - Sure. Right. Remember what I told you about not leaving me alone with, you know... Would you say he was crazy, or am I? I wouldn't say. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, - Hi, Stell. - Hello. - Hello, Stella. - Hello. Stella's got a fella! Only he don't know it. - Who? - You, that's who. My own sister, standing out here every night making a sap of herself... - over a guy who don't know she's here. - You mind your own business. Anyways, you don't know what you're talking about. I don't? You doll up every night and wait to welcome me home? - Why, of course. - Ah, gee, thanks. - I must give you a kiss for that. - Stop! Take your dirty hands off me. You're like all the rest. Fingers are chopped at the mill when he walks by. - But he don't look at none of them. - Why should he? Mill hands. Hey, wait a minute. There's some nice girls that are mill hands. Where do you get off? What's the matter with a mill hand? I'm a mill hand. Your father's a mill hand. - Don't yell. The neighbors know it. - Well, maybe he don't. - So I'll tell him. - Stop that! Stop this! What's the matter with you two? You used to get along. Yeah, but that was before she started taking a business course... to improve herself. It's done her a lot of good, all right. - She ain't satisfied with none of us. - Supper. - What'd you say, Mom? - Supper's ready. So am I. Come on, Pop. - Come on, Stell. - I'll be in in a minute. ''The childhood sweetheart of young Stephen Dallas. A sweetheart until that tragic hour when his millionaire father... bankrupt and ill, committed suicide. Two days later, Stephen Dallas disappeared... leaving behind him a note saying he was trying to make a life... somewhere else. Harvard graduate and crew man disappeared after his father's death. Millionaire playboy left without a penny.'' Don't be late, Charlie. - What is it? - Your lunch. That's right. Get funny. What's in it? Just a little turkey and dressing. That's all I had today. Wait a minute. Baloney again, and apple butter. Baloney and apple butter. Apple butter and baloney. That's all I get. I ain't gonna take it no more. - You can do without it. - I can, huh? - Charlie, I'll fix you something. - Don't baby him, Mom. Baby me? I'm old enough to earn money, ain't I? A man can have a home of his own on what I'm makin'. Charlie, wait a minute. Oh, what do you want to egg him on for, Stella? That Jenkins girl's just dyin' to get him. Let her. If that's all the ambition he's got, there's nothing you can do. I don't know what we'd do without him. I'm gonna fix up somethin' for him to eat. You can leave it for him on your way down. He'll starve first. Maybe you're right, Mom. I'll take it down to him. I'll run over to the delicatessen and get him something nice. Will ya? Yeah. Hey, the boss just phoned. He's at Millhampton Junction. He said to tell you the Parker contract is right in his vest pocket. He was chirping like a bird. Said he'll be here in a few minutes, but just wanted to tell you. Hey, ain't you interested? Yes, I'm glad Mr. Beamer got the contract. You oughta be. He was chirping like a bird. You know how he does on the telephone. He said to put you down for a raise. You can have that vacation now. How's that? I don't need a vacation now. I have no place to go. Huh? Oh, nothing. I beg your pardon. Could you tell me where I could find Charlie Martin? He works on the carting machine. Oh, yes. The carting machines. Why, they're closed down just now. He'd be out in the yard, most likely. I tell you what you do... Go back through the corridor the way you came in. Instead of coming up those stairs... there's a big gate down there. If you go through that gate... the path leads right down past that first big building. Just as you turn round the corner, the men usually have their... Yes? Well, it's sort of dirty down there. Maybe I'd better send for him. - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - McCarthy! - Yes, sir. - Find Charlie Martin, send him in. - Yes, sir. Right away. - He'll be right in. - Thank you. - Good morning, Dallas. - Congratulations on that contract. - How do you do, Mr. Beamer? - How do you do? - Stella Martin. - Martin's girl? You're all grown up. And so pretty. Isn't she, Dallas? Yes. Say, how long have you two known each other? - Well, we haven't really met. - Oh, excuse me. Mr. Dallas, this is Miss Martin. Miss Martin, Mr. Dallas. - How do you do? - How do you do? My brother forgot his lunch, and I didn't want him to go without. - So I brought it to him. - That's a nice girl. Good to your brother. Good to your father, too, I'll bet. I wish I had somebody thinking so much of me. Eh, Dallas? They said he went out to eat. - Thank you. - That's too bad. - After all your trouble. - I suppose it was all my fault. - I was late. - It wouldn't do him harm to wait. I'll bet sometimes he's late. Never mind. Don't you worry. Let's see what you got. We can make believe you brought it to us. - Eh, Dallas? - It isn't anything much. Oh! Make this yourself? Dallas? - Thank you. - You too. I hope they're not too dry. I forgot to bring anything to drink. - I have some milk here. - Oh, fine. - I'll get some glasses. - Can I help you? - Thank you. - Hey, you're some cook, aren't you? Oh, wait, please. I hate glasses that don't shine. Don't you? Shall we go? You ready? - Hello, Stella. - Hello. - Hello, Steve. - How are you, Ned? Don't forget, the missus will be expecting you over for that good meal. - You bet. Very soon. - You go over there for dinner? Gee, you who could be at the River Club. - Look. - That's the second time this week. I saw them in the drug store together the other night. You mind your own business. - You mind our being talked about? - Mind? I mind? Oh, no. It's just that I can't believe you like seeing me... when you could be out with all the swells. I want to be with you. I like being with you. Could I take your arm? I mean, is that all right? Is that considered... I wanna be like all the people you've been around. Educated, you know, and speaking nice. Don't be like anyone else. I like you the way you are. No, I don't want to be like me, not like the people in this place... but like the people in the movie. You know, doing everything well-bred and refined. And dull. Stay as you are. Don't pretend. Anyway, it isn't really well-bred to act the way you aren't. But I wanted to be different ever since I met you. If I was around you long enough, I could be. I could learn to talk like you and act like you. Pretty soon, l... Well, you've done a lot for me even in these couple of weeks. You've done a lot for me too. I was very lonely the day you walked in. Oh, no, I don't smoke and I don't drink either. I was lonely and unhappy, and then you... Yes? Oh, I shouldn't have. You won't have any respect for me. Not for girls who let men kiss them whenever they want. I mean, I don't let... I mean... Well, a girl shouldn't unless they... Well... unless they know a man is serious. Ain't she got home yet? Does the old man... - Hello, Pop. - What time did Stella get home? Huh? Oh, that was about... That was around... Oh, I don't know, but she woke me up. Hey, Mom, how about the coffee? And Pop's too. Tell Stella I want to see her. Gee, it was kind of late. Let her sleep. Tell Stella I want to see her. Yes. Why, she ain't here. I wonder where she could've gone so early? She ain't slept there. She spent the night with Carrie Jenkins. It was raining hard. She didn't go out with Carrie. Why should she stay the night with her? When she gets home, tell her to take her things and be out before I get back. Listen, you can't. Give her a chance to explain. You shut up! Tell her what I said. All right, then I guess that goes for me too. Finish your coffee. I'll talk to your pa. I don't want coffee or any part of this dump from now on. I'm through! - I'll tell you later. - Gee, where have you been? - The old man's... - Look, Charlie. Married? Oh, Stell! Gee, Mr. Dallas, that's swell. Hey, Ma, she's here. She's married. Hey, Pop, it's okay now. She's here. We're here, Agnes. My, oh, my, you sure is. And there it is. Yes, ma'am. Who do it look like? Let me see who you look like, your pappy or your mammy. Go ahead and open the door. You'll have time for that later on. Yes'm. Yes, ma'am. I know who's gonna be boss around here from now on. Oh, gosh. Home never looked so good to me. Poor Stella. I didn't mind it. The hospital got on my nerves. That darned doctor trying to make me stay another week. - He thought it would be better... - Better for who? It was just to get your money. I felt as good the next day as ever. Maybe better than I had for a while. Oh, Stephen, why didn't you bring them to me? The days wouldn't have seemed half so long. - I thought everybody'd forgotten me. - I think we'll get you to bed. Bed? I just got up. Haven't you seen enough of me in bed for the past three weeks? Seems like three years to me. You'll soon find you're not as strong as you think you are. You must remember I've had a great deal of experience in these maternity cases. Experience? What do you think I had? Tell me why doctors, nurses and husbands... always think they know more about this maternity business. Don't you think a mother learns anything in that room they wheel her into? Or is that just a kindergarten class? Let me tell you. I picked up quite an experience in that room. That wasn't out of books either. Experience. - Stephen. - Yes, dear? A dance at the River Club tomorrow night. I think I can wear my blue dress. - I'll let it out a little at the top. - You don't want to go dancing already. Before I went to the hospital, I was stuck in this house... for four solid months without going anywheres. We just got in to the River Club. All my life I've died to go to the real places and get in with the right crowd. Just when I got a chance to get started, I have to give it all up. We'll go next time. I don't want to go next time. I want to go this time. Stephen, I won't dance much. I promise. I just want to get a wave and a manicure... and get all dressed up again and go hear some music... and forget all about doctors and hospitals and nurses. And babies? Ah, but Stephen, please. Why, you're a wonderful dancer, Mr. Munn. If I'm any judge of horse flesh, you don't shake a mean leg yourself. Who's that she's dancing with? He's pretty good too. - I really don't know. - His name is Munn. He has something to do with horse races. The girls invite him over for golf, and he gives them tips. How'd you come to get hooked up to a table like that? They're some business friends of my husband's. Business friends? What is he, an undertaker? Get him to ditch that bunch of moss bags and come over and join us. Spencer Chandler's table? We don't even know him. Well, that won't take long. - You know what he said after our dance? - No. What? He said, ''Ed...'' He always calls me Ed. ''You can pick winners on a dance floor better than you can on a racetrack.'' Yeah? Ah, go on. Don't red apple me. No, on the level. I'll prove it to you. I'd have to ask Stephen first. - Yes? - Come here. Excuse me. Yes? - This is Mr. Munn. - How are you? Mr. Spencer Chandler wants us to come over to his table. - I'm sorry. We're just leaving. - Leaving? - It's only quarter after. - I know, but that's late for us. - Come just for a nightcap. - Yes, Stephen, please. I'm afraid we can't. Thank you. Good night. Good night. I'll get the things. He dug it out of his pocket. The horse came in and paid 20 to 1. What do you think of that? - Oh, dear. - Did you lose something? - What was it? - May I help you? I remember. I gave it to Mr... Pardon me. - What do you think of that? - What a story. Say, Ed, did you give me back my handkerchief? - You never gave it to me. - I must have lost it. - Take mine. - No, I didn't mean... Wait a minute. I want you to meet a friend of mine. - Mr. Chandler, this is Mrs. Dallas. - How do you do? Spencer, I want you to prove something to her for me. Didn't you say I could pick 'em on the dance floor as good as on the track? I wouldn't feel too flattered. Munn hasn't given me a winner in a month. - Will you sit down? - Thank you. Miss Dallas, I'd like you to meet Miss Terry. I believe your wife lost something, and she thought maybe Mr... - Mr. Munn might know. - Thank you. Stephen, this is Mr. Chandler. Mr. Chandler, my husband. Mr. Chandler asked me to dance. You don't mind? Sorry, my wife's just out of the hospital and should be in bed. We'll hurry then. Come on. You wouldn't like to sit down and have a little snifter? No, thank you very much. Thank you. What have I done this time? I'll take my usual lecture. Begin. Stella, I asked you not to wear those earrings... that cheap imitation necklace. You took them off. You agreed. Then after we got there, you came out of the dressing room... I'm perfectly willing to let you tell me how to talk and act. But please don't give me pointers on how to dress. Allow me at least to know more about one thing than you do. After all, I've always been known to have stacks of style. You should have heard Ed Munn, and he's been around a bit too. He's traveled further, and he... All right, then, farther. Whichever it is, I don't care. Gosh, I have to think twice every time I open my mouth. Spencer Chandler didn't seem to have to turn the other way either. He only happens to be one of the Chandlers. Please don't say things like that. - Remember you're my wife now. - And can't look at another man. - That isn't the point at all. - That's a laugh. An affair between Spencer Chandler and I. Well, I am coming up in the world. Stella, can't you... Won't you try to understand? Please listen to me this time. Please. The fake jewelry is not important. Chandler's not important. None of these things matter in themselves. But what's to become of us? That is important. Stella, why did you marry me? Because I was crazy about you, silly, and I still am, only... - Only you just don't seem to ever... - Once, a long time ago... you said you were crazy to learn everything, become someone. Didn't you? - Yes, Stephen. - Please listen to me. I'm only telling you this because I love you. Beamer wants to send me to New York to handle the sales department there. I want to go. I want to take you with me, but I want you to make an effort. I want you to try to be... what you wanted to be. Give up a few things for me and try to adapt yourself... Adapt myself? Give up a few things? Well, what have I been doing ever since I met you? I'm getting a little sick of it too. How would it be for you to do a little adapting for a change? I don't see you giving up anything. I'll tell you one more thing. I'm not going to New York. I'm not gonna leave here just when I'm beginning to get with the right people. You go on and go to New York. I'm gonna stay here. Can you beat that? Laying awake waiting for her dinner, and not a squawk out of her. Gosh, Carrie... I used to think girls at the mill were crazy... when they got married and right off the bat started having kids. But honest, Stella, would you want any more? Sure, if I could have another one like her. She's been a regular pal to me. Since Stephen's been away in New York, I hardly know I have a husband. He's only been here three times this summer, and only on account of her. He's crazy about her. Who wouldn't be? Oh, look at her. Wiping it up at her age. Can you beat that? She's the spit of her old man. Now, who's that? Edna? Is this all the welcome I get? Of all people! - Gosh, I'm glad to see you. - And I you. - I haven't seen you for ages. - Get a load of that kid. Has she grown, or am I crazy? Come on. Gee, Stell, she looks more like you every time. You remember Uncle Ed, don't you, darling? I remember you. - Oh, let me see. - How's that? Oh, Ed, you shouldn't have done this. Don't she look like a little queen? It's gold and turquoise. Edna! You want a drink, don't you? Sure, and if you don't mind, I'll peel this coat. Sure, go ahead. What'll it be? You know me. I ain't particular, so long as it don't jump up and bite me. - But I've been drinking bourbon. - What have you been drinkin'? Nothing, but I'll take bourbon. You oughta have been along. Maybe you've been having too much fun here. - I haven't been out for two months. - Been sick? I don't seem to get any fun out of a good time anymore. All the time I'm out, I'm thinkin' of her and what she's doing... and how soon I can get back to her. Well, here's hoping I'll always be around at the right time. - What are you drinking? - Sarsaparilla. Stealin' the kid's drinks, huh? Did you ever catch her sneaking your oatmeal? - Say, can I pick her up? - Sure, go ahead. Come to your Uncle Ed. Got ya, girl. Come on. Ain't you got a big smile for your Uncle Ed? Of course she has. Come on. Smile for Uncle Ed. - Edna! - I'll get it. If I could only see her open that door just once. - Come on. - Come on, darlin'. Smile for Uncle Ed. - Oh, you remember Mr. Munn. - How do you do? - And Carrie Jenkins. - Yes, how do you do? I'll be getting along. - Yes, darling. - That's a fine baby you got there. - Thank you. I think so. - I gotta be going too, Ed. Me too. Just a minute. I'll see you to the door. Thanks for the good time. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Stella, I can't have our child living this way. - What's wrong this time? - It's not just this time. Because there was a couple of drinks? What's wrong with that? Coming in here with that icebergy way of yours. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. But she's my child, too, and I won't have this. I hadn't wanted to take Laurel away from you, but if you... Take her away from me? What are you talking about? How dare you say such a thing? Give her to me. - Give her to me, I say! - You mustn't do this. Watch out! You're hurting her! Get out. Did he frighten Mommy's little girl? Don't you cry. Mommy's right here. Mommy won't let anybody hurt you. There, there. You're here with Mommy, and nobody in the world will ever take you away. Nobody. Thank you. - Boy. - That's cute. Would you like to include one of those too? She's a little too grown up now, I'm afraid. That's all. Come on, fellas. Mother's ready. - Come on, boys. - Mother, he rows it himself. Can't we wait until he winds it again? I want you to see how it goes. - Thank you, Mr. Dallas. - You'll send those right away? - Helen. - Oh, Stephen. - I'm so glad to see you. - And you. Boys, come here, please. - Stephen, these are my sons. - How do you do, young gentlemen? How do you do? This is Mr. Dallas, whom your mother has known for such a long time. John. - How do you do? - Lee. - And Cornelius. - Con. He doesn't like to be called Cornelius. I do too. It was my father's name. - Was? - Con's the man of the family now. He looks after us all so beautifully. His father would be very proud. Splendid. Nothing but the finest care would be good enough for your mother. But, Stephen, tell us about you. I gave up all thought of ever seeing you again such a long time ago. - What are you doing here? - New York? I'm in business here. If you mean this store, I'm buying birthday presents for my daughter. Your daughter? Oh, Stephen. - Here she is. - Oh, she's pretty. - When may we meet her and her mother? - They're not here. Laurel goes to school near Boston, and her mother spends her time with her. I have so many things to hear and to tell. - Can you lunch with us? - I should be back at the office now. We'd be glad to have you, if you don't mind carrying your own tray. John's been saving up for a whole month to take us to lunch. It's his treat. That's all right. I got enough for one more, if you don't eat too much. How 'bout it, Mr. Dallas? - I can't refuse an offer like that. - Oh, good. Come along. If you run short, I'll lend you a couple of dollars. Gee, thanks. Oh, books again. I've got a good mind to tell him she can get books from the library. But there's no place where you can get a fur coat for nothing. Boy, what I wouldn't give to see her in one. Oh, well. Here. Hide them with the rest and let me get on with this... or it won't be ready for Christmas, let alone her birthday. - Gladys, where's Mother? - Now, let me see. She's... - Hello, Mother. - Hello, darling. Miss Phillibrown, my teacher, came home with me. - She wants to see you. - If I'd known, I could have fixed up. Look at me. I'm a sight. Look at the things all... Oh, dear. Mother, this is Miss Phillibrown. - How do you do? - Pleased to meet ya. - Won't you sit down? - I haven't a minute, but... Thank you. My dear, I wonder if I might have a glass of water. - Of course. You too? - No. Maybe she'd rather have sarsaparilla. I have some on ice. - No, thank you. - All right. She's such a darling. I didn't want to talk in front of her in case she might be disappointed. I spend the weekends in Boston. May I borrow Laurel for this one? I couldn't get her ready this time, but if you'd ask her again... Lollie thinks the world of you. I know she'd have a wonderful time, seeing some decent shows... not just movies. I had in mind the galleries and museums. - She seems so interested. - Oh, yeah. She's crazy about that stuff. She gets it from her father. Her father? You see, I've only heard about you. Oh. 'Course, she don't see as much of her father. Mr. Dallas' business keeps him in New York. - Really? - But I always spend vacation with him. Up in Maine, in the woods. Have you ever been there? Oh, it's beautiful. Your mother's given her permission for you to spend a weekend in Boston. - When? - Very soon. Oh, thank you, Miss Phillibrown. - I really must go. - Oh, must ya? - Good-bye, Mrs. Dallas. - Good-bye. Come again. Thank you. - Good-bye, Laurel, dear. - Good-bye, Miss Phillibrown. - Mother, isn't she the nicest? - Yes, darling. - Did you ask her to the party? - No. You think she'd come? Of course. Why not? Mother! For the party? What did you do that for? You're always sticking your... Mother, I'm sorry. Come here. I didn't mean to... You know how I always fly off, and l... Well, I wanted it to be a surprise... Well, now that you've seen it, you may as well slip it on... and let me fit you instead of this thing. - Dummy. - Oh, it's blue. There. - It's beautiful! - Careful. Don't mash the ruffles. Now. Oh, yeah, I forgot. This goes here. - Oh, no. - Yes, it gives it a little snap. You're just like your father. You want everything plain as an old shoe. Plain? With all these beautiful, handmade ruffles. Now, turn around. Yes, the length's all right. It's just the sleeves. Take it off, let me get on with it. - Yoo-hoo! What's going on in there? - Come on in, Ed. Wait till I get out. What is this? A Follies dressing room? What's the matter? He shouldn't see me like this. Ed's known you since you were knee-high and seen you with hardly anything on. Even less than that. What have you got to hide from your uncle? - Let me see. - Mother, make him stop. Stop! Lollie, don't be a little fool. I wish you wouldn't tease her. You know she don't like it. I know, but I get a kick from a young one being so finicky. Well. - Your car downstairs? - No. It's in the shop. Why? I wanted to go to town and get the decorations for the party. Why not go in on the train? Take the kid, see a show, have dinner. No, I don't want her to know what I'm getting. Oh, I see. I guess I could show you a better time without her. - How long will you be? - I won't be long. - Unless you got a drink here... - I got sarsaparilla. I'll meet you at the corner. Sarsaparilla. Honest, some of the things I do for you. You'll like it when you get used to it, and it's good for you too. - What's that? - You can read, can't you? Ltch powder? Things are just a little too quiet around here. Hey, can I see that? What's the name of that horse? - What's the matter? - I got a ticket on it. - Kokomo wins. I'm rich! - Let me shake your hand. Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - I'm awfully glad. - I stand to win $30,000. - Good. - Have a cigar. - What happened? - Have a cigar. - Sir! - You want gum. We go to all parts here. Thank you very much. Thank you. - Say, that was great luck. - Did you see what happened? He won $30,000 on a horse race. - You're kidding. - Kidding? Watch 'em commence. I can't stand it. Another one just bit the dust. You're killing me. Get the old girls. They're doing a sister act. They must have rehearsed. What's so funny? Now what'd you do? Come on, look. They're two down there. Gee, Ed, I don't see how you can keep such a straight face. What's a little kidding among friends? - Is that the father? - No, it can't be. She particularly said her husband was in New York. Such women don't deserve to have children. The one way to drink sarsaparilla is so it don't taste like sarsaparilla. Do you mind? You want some? Laurel's such a lovely child. I don't know what to think. Mary Anne's been asked to her party. Scratch that first entry of yours and give somebody else a chance. - Honest, I'd do anything... - Please don't, Ed. It's like I told you. It's not personal. I don't think there's a man living that could get me goin' anymore. I don't know. I guess Lollie just uses up all the feelings I've got. I don't seem to have any left for anybody else. You got plenty for me. Why can't we go on as we are? I don't know what I would have done without you... when Loli was with Stephen. You're such a good sport and such a lot of fun. I guess you know what you're doing. - What's the matter? - I got some of that stuff on me. Wouldn't that be a hit? I have. It's all over here. Gladys, are you nearly ready? I have to let her in. I'm ready. Miss Dallas! Do I look all right? None of them have ever seen me. She's always telling them how beautiful I am. Honey, you sure can live up to it. But if I live through this day, I'm gonna get me another corset. Coming, dear. How ever did you do it? Oh, and you, Mother. You look beautiful. Do I? Some favors! Don't pull 'em. They pop and have little hats inside. - And little baskets. - I put candies in with the nuts. The place cards! They're beautiful. Where did you get them? I sit there, and you sit here. And Miss Phillibrown next to me, and Flo Bell. And Alice May. Mother, could I see the cake? Go ahead. Oh, look! - One, two, three, four, five, six... - You like it? Here somebody is! - Let Gladys go. - All right. Remember what I told you. Yeah. - Is this the Dallas residence? - Yes. Sign here, please. - Thank you. - Thank you. It's for you, Lollie. Don't forget to say Laurel in front of other people. - Yes, ma'am. - What is it? It's from Miss Phillibrown. She can't come. What did she say? ''Dear, I'm sorry it's impossible for me to come to your party... but I'm thinking of you this afternoon... and I hope you will not be disappointed. Sincerely, your friend Margaret Phillibrown.'' That's too bad. I do wish she could've come just to see everything. And you. Well, I'll fix up again for her sometime. Most likely the girls will have a better time without her. They see enough of her in school. I know I did my teachers. Everyone loves Miss Phillibrown. Take these, please. Well, anyway, it'll make an even number. Sure. Come on. We'll wait in the other room. You sit over there. Let Gladys go. Remember what I told you. - Miss Dallas' residence. - That's right. Miss Dallas' residence. Okay. I'll tell her. - Who was it? - Miss Cheeny. She says Alice May can't come. Who? Alice May Cheeny. She sits next to me in school. It'll make the table look better. It won't be so crowded. I'll fix it. I better make some more biscuits. The others is all dried up. Yeah. Let's do that. That's a very good idea. You know, Mother. They're not coming, or they'd be here. Oh, Lollie, you don't think that... We'll go in together. I never know what to look for. You change so much each time. - Do I look older? - Older? You're a young lady. - Your wardrobe's growing up too. - I have a costume for everything. Fine, because we have a wonderful invitation... to spend our whole time together in the most beautiful place in the world. Better than Maine? Where? You'll see. - How are you? - Martha, this is my daughter, Laurel. How do you do? Oh, Daddy, how beautiful. - This is Mrs. Morrison. - How do you do? - So glad to see you. - I'm so glad to see you too. Michael, this is Laurel we've been waiting to meet. Now, don't overdo it. He's such a nice dog. - Where are the boys? - Still down at the stables. Tell them their surprise is here. You don't mind being a surprise? Come on, Mike, we'll go fetch 'em. I'll show Laurel her room. It's lovely. How sweet. If you let me have your keys, I'll have Martha unpack you. Oh, I can do it. I'll take your coat. Yes, thank you. And your hat. Oh, everything. I like nice closets too. We'll hang this here. I'm so glad you brought your riding clothes. It was one of the things on my list, to ride in Central Park. We'll be using them here too. And so many pretty dresses. The fun your mother must have choosing them for you. She makes them all. She does? Oh, how clever. What a lucky girl you are. How lucky she is too. All boys want to wear are overalls. I suppose you want to freshen up. But don't change. I'll see that your father has his tea. He has to get right back to town. Come down when you're ready. Don't keep the boys waiting too long. Thank you. They won't acknowledge they like her. They haven't got as far as that. But have you noticed the hair brushing and collar wearing going on? I have. Mother... am I too little to dance with Laurel? - Did she say so? - No, but Con did. If I wanted to dance with Laurel, I'd ask her, not Con. I will. Big intrigue. Let me have it. You'll drop it. I will not. - Why don't you let Con carry it? - I wanna carry it. - Good-bye. It's been fun. - Oh, yes. We'll look forward so to next time. I've had such a lovely time, I don't know how to thank you. Good-bye, Laurel. I brought your suitcase. - Here's a present for you. - Thank you so much. Good-bye! Oh, aren't they the nicest boys? I think so. How did you like Mrs. Morrison? I think she's the loveliest lady I ever knew. Do you really, Laurel? Oh, I mean... I mean... Of course, I mean, except my mother. Mother, how nice! It's a little stuffy. I'm gonna open a window. All right. You happy? I guess I'll shove off. You two got lots to talk about. So, what are you gonna eat, Ed? Me? I don't know. I ain't very hungry. I thought maybe I'd stop in at... Come back and have dinner with us. - You only bought two chops. - One for you, one for Lollie. I'm so happy, I couldn't even look at a meal. - What time? - An hour. So long, lollipops. I'll come back and tie on the nose bag with ya. - Want me to bring anything? - No, thanks. Why did you? I thought we were gonna have a nice, quiet time alone. So did I, Lollie, darling. Things haven't been going so good for poor Ed lately. You'd never know it to hear him talk. You remember that big watch and chain he used to wear? Well, they're just not there anymore. I'm sorry. She's not here anymore. I let her go. What did I need with anybody around? Oh, Mother, you shouldn't have. Besides, I was glad to have something to do to help pass the time away. You know what I did? I saved enough money out of her wages for a deposit on a fur coat for you. Mother, you didn't. You're just going to get it right back. I don't want a fur coat now. None of the girls at Mrs. Morrison's are allowed to have them yet. Oh, no? Here. You know what I've been thinking? Would it cost too awfully much for us to have a house... with our own front door and a little garden and flowers... and a room for each of us? Just in case sometimes we wanted somebody to stay all night. Mother, not a great big expensive house like Mrs. Morrison's... but just a little tiny place. Say, tell me about this Mrs. Morrison. - What's she like? - Mother, she's lovely. She's sort of... Well, she reminds me of a flower... that grows up in Maine. All pale and delicate, but strong too. I don't know what you call it. I don't care what kind of a flower she looks like. Is she tall or short, dark or light, fat or thin? - How old is she? - She's not any special age. She's like one of those goddesses in my mythology book that way. Come now. You can tell whether she's 20 or 40. Oh, she's not 40, no. I guess maybe she's about 25. And how did your father happen to meet this goddess? It's like a story. Con told me all about it. Con. Is that her husband? Oh, no, he's dead. Didn't I write you? Dead, is he? Well, that's convenient. No, it isn't a bit convenient. When Mr. Morrison died, he left a whole lot of houses... and horses and money. Mrs. Morrison has to look out for them all by herself. She said she wouldn't know what to do... without Father to help her and advise her. Yeah. I can just imagine. I just remembered. I've got some snapshots of her. - I just want to look at you. - I want you to see her. She's beautiful. You'll be crazy about her! The funny thing about her is that she's not only beautiful all dressed... but even when she wakes up in the morning. She spends hardly any time on her face. Once I saw her put soap and water right on it. All I can say is there are different kinds of skin. Besides, with her money, she don't have to worry about her looks. Say, are those real pearls she's got slung around her neck? - Look what you're doing! - What? You're getting cold cream all over her picture. - I didn't mean it. - Give it to me. I'll do it. Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the... Hi, lollipops. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Here is the mistletoe. Now, where's the kiss? Run along. Go inside. What do you mean by showing up here in this condition? Get out. I've got something for you. I've been robbed. Why, if I thought that anybody would take... Here you are, my dear. A very Merry Christmas. No, thanks. I can't take it. I wouldn't know what to do with it. Oh. What to do with it. Cook it. Run along, give it to somebody else. Me give my chicken to somebody else? You think I'm gonna do that? You come out of there. Ed, what are you trying to do, set the place on fire? Cookin' a turkey. Get that thing out of here. - I say yes. - Don't tell me how to cook a turkey. I know how to cook a turkey. - Now, come on. - Now, listen. I know how to cook it, and so there. The feet won't be very well done, but I don't care for feet anyway. Ed, be reasonable. - Merry Christmas. - Father! I'm so glad to see you. And am I glad to see you. What a nice surprise. You should see the way I've been running to the door. I never dreamed of anything so wonderful as your bringing them yourself. Ooh, what a lovely tree. Here you are. Oh, thank you, Daddy. I'll put them right here while I go call Mother. I'll take your coat and hat. This is a fine Christmas spirit. You don't have anything in the house. Strawberry. There you are. Strawberry. And lemon. Peach. What is this? This is more sarsaparilla. Of all the places I ever saw, a man can't have any... Go inside and keep him company. I'll get dressed as fast as I can. What are you whispering? - You've got to go. I've got company. - Oh, company. - Who's the company? - Never you mind. Just go. I'd like to see the guy. I tell you, Stella, no, sir. I'm gonna sit right here until I find out who the company is. No, you're not. You're gonna go. Pushin' and a-shovin'! I think the company would like the turkey too. It was the biggest turkey I could find. One of the finest turks that the man had. I never saw such a big turkey in all of my life. Daddy, a wristwatch. How lovely. - Do you like it, darling? - Yes. You're getting so grown up, I don't know what to buy for you. Mother copied it from one we saw in the window of a shop in Boston. - You can hardly tell the difference. - It is pretty, isn't it? - It was my best present till you came. - Oh, you doll. Well! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. It's good to see you again. - Well, it's good to see you. - Sit down. Thank you. - The place looks awfully nice. - You'll go to dinner with us? Well, darling, l... I came to ask your mother a favor. I was wondering if you'd let me have Laurel for the holidays this time. I've never had a place for her before. This time we have an invitation to spend it with the Morrisons. Well. - Would you like to go, Lollie? - Yes. - Oh, that is, if... - Oh, I think it would be lovely. - When would you want her? - Well, my train leaves in an hour. I was hoping I could take her back with me. - Today? - No, not today. I couldn't, Father. Mother and I had something all planned. Well, yes, we did, but... Well, we could do that anytime. Come on. We'll have to hurry. You have your new coat, and you'll want these things. I'll just get her started. Excuse us. Hurry. - There's your case there. - Will this do for the train? That's fine. Pack what you need now, and I'll send your trunk on tonight. All right. She won't be very long. This is for you, Stella. Oh, thank you. Stella, I'm awfully sorry... when I see all you've done here, and you did have plans. - I didn't realize... - Oh, it wasn't anything, really. We were just going to a show and dinner at the Bontonne. This'll be a real treat for her. It's been so long since I've seen you. - How have you been? - Well, thank you. - And you? - Oh, fine. That's good. Too bad your train leaves so early. Stella, l... I've been thinking. I don't know why it didn't occur to me before... but there's no earthly reason why you should spend today all alone... just because I've been selfish and thoughtless. There must be a later train. Where's the telephone? Shall we call and see? Oh, yes, please! Here. Beacon Hill 3700, please. Fooled you, didn't I? You put me out the back door and I went around again... right in here. Just where is all this company that I'm being kicked out because of? I'm gonna tell you this. You're not gonna feed 'em my turkey. No, sir. Not... I beg your pardon. I guess l... Oh, I'm sorry, Stella. I didn't mean to... I guess I'll go now. Mr. Dallas. He's had a little too much Christmas, I guess. He was here a while ago and brought a turkey. I had a terrible time getting rid of him. - What did you find out about the train? - I'm afraid it'll be too late. I'm sorry. I'm all ready. Was I very long? Not at all, darling. Good-bye, Stella. I'll take good care of her. Bye, Stephen. Good-bye, Mother. - Good-bye, Stella. - Bye. Thank you for letting me go. - Mrs. Dallas, Mr. Morley. - How do you do, Mrs. Dallas? Won't you sit down, please? I wrote you a letter, and in it I stated... Don't tell me what you stated. Just tell me what you meant. It's only natural to suppose that you should wish to legalize your position... Legalize my position? I've got a marriage license. What are you tryin' to give me? Your freedom. A divorce. Mr. Dallas feels, and I can readily understand why... that you might wish to remarry. Let's get down to brass tacks. I haven't the slightest idea of ever remarryin'. Now, it don't happen, by any chance, to be... Mr. Dallas who wishes to remarry, does it? Well, assuming for the moment that it does... surely you could have no objection. Your allowance would be the same. As a matter of fact, Mr. Dallas might even be able to increase the amount... I don't want any increases. Let him keep it, and let me keep my daughter. Mr. Dallas has no intention of any change regarding your daughter. Oh, he hasn't. Then what's he been tryin' to win her away for? Takin' her to fine hotels, country places, town houses. Makin' her dissatisfied with the kinds of things I been givin' her. Does he think I don't see what he's after? He'll never get away with it. I'm gonna give her the same things. Everything her heart's been set on. Fine hotels, fancy friends. I'm gonna give 'em to her, and he'll pay for 'em. If he's got any increases, he can hand 'em over. If he don't, maybe I'll get a lawyer... and bring in the name of that highfalutin widow! I won't keep ya any longer, Mr. Morley. Thank you very much. Just see the check is mailed to the same place. That's all the benefits I want. This one'll do. Look, put some more lace on it... I'm sorry! Nice one. You're wonderful, Laurel. Dick, you threw me that last game. The last one came over like a bullet. Is that any way to treat your teacher? - That's the way to take him over. - What's the matter? Losing your edge? - Laurel, this is Mrs. Clews. - I'm glad to know you. - You're improving rapidly. - My teacher. We're gonna have Dad's box for the polo game. Won't you come with us? Oh, I'd love to. But I should spend the afternoon with my mother. See ya at dinner then. Bye. - How is your mother today? - Oh, she's much better, thank you. Couldn't Mrs. Clews and I visit her this afternoon while you go to the polo? - Oh, yes. - That's an idea, Mother. I've been looking forward to meeting her. It's unfortunate she's been ill all the time. - What do you say? - I'll have to ask Mother. - Come on. - All right! - I'll call you. - All right. Hello, darling. - Did you have a good time? - Oh, heavenly. Richard's mother and a Mrs. Clews I just met want me to go to the polo game. And they want to spend the afternoon with you. And see me for the first time in my nightgown? Huh! I should say not. And me with a trunk full of new clothes... my skin is just itchin' to get next to. Goodness gracious. But you go along, and say I was asleep. No, I won't leave you alone again. There's no sense in the two of us being cooped up here. I'll be all right in a few days. I'll get all fixed up and meet your friends. You know what I was thinkin'? The first night I'm able to go down in the dining room... we'll have this Richard and his mother to dinner with us. Would ya like that? I knew you would. Go on, now. Run along. You mustn't keep him waiting. Wear your blue jacket. I love ya in that. Boy. Oh, boy. Listen, will you tell me which lady is Mrs. Richard Grosvenor? Mrs. Grosvenor's not here, ma'am. Oh, then please direct me to the tennis court. Maybe she's there. Just across the lawn and down that path. You mean sort of over that way and down there? - Yes, ma'am. - Oh. Wait a minute. - Here you are, young fellow. - Oh, that's all right. - Don't be sill'. - Thank you. Here goes a birdie. - Did I say birdie? - Well, whoo! - Tryin' to cover it up, huh? - No, I'll wear it everywhere. Did you see the makeup on her? And those shoes! Why, I thought she was wearing stilts. - Hello. - Hi, kids. How are you? Come on. Move down one seat. Whatever happened to you two? We've been back hours. We took a shortcut. - Say, Paul, you sure missed a show. - What'll it be, Mr. Grosvenor? - What show? - That woman on the tennis court. I'll have a chocolate ice cream soda with chocolate ice cream... and whipped cream on top. - What about her? - Make mine the same... only with vanilla ice cream and leave off the goo. I didn't know they let that kind of woman loose anymore. - Happy? - You should've seen the getup. - What a woman! - Maybe Dick knows her. - Dick, she was looking for your mother. - Yeah? Pete lobbed one over the fence and she started chasing after it. I never saw her before. Who is she? I don't know, but I'd sure like to know where she got that paint job. - It's a Christmas tree, not a woman. - And it walks. - Does it talk? - And how! - Good? - Delicious. That's the one. I heard her say to Jimmy... ''You oughta see my little girl play tennis.'' She must have some little girl. - No, I don't like it. - It is rather heavy. - Let me see that one. - This one? - She's an ad. - An ad for what? We'll see in a minute. Wait'll her hat lights up. You're all wrong. It's a trailer. Do you think that one really suits my personality? - Yes, ma'am. Decidedly. - You do. I'll take that. Send it up to Room 214. Thank you. ''Personality.'' Amy, get her. - What's the matter? - I must've lost my watch. Wait a minute. You can't go all the way back there now. - When did you see it last? - I want to go. Please let me go. Don't worry about it. Let's finish our sodas first. We'll find it. There you are. I've been lookin' all over for you... Well, Lollie, what on earth... - Mother, we're going home. - Home? What are you talking... - What's the matter? What's happened? - Nothing. Oh, I know. My little Lollie's had a quarrel with her young man. Mother, please! Oh, don't be a little goose. I'll tell you what you do. I'll invite him for dinner, make believe I don't know anything about it. I'll pretend you're not back yet. What's their number? I wanna go home. You wanna go home? Well... Well, what about me? Payin' for two rooms all this time and usin' only a bed. Don't you think I'd like a little of the fun you've been havin'? I should think you'd think of somebody else besides yourself. You know... I like nice people and a little fun myself. I'm sorry. I don't see how your pride would let you show him you cared that much. If it was me, I'd stay on just to show him that there's other fish in the sea. It's only for you. Well, you said yourself this morning... you'd never been so happy in all your life. And so was I too. - Oh, dear. - Here. Here you are, miss. Thank you. Board! - She missed it as sure as you live. - Oh, there she is. Nan! Did you have a blowout? No, but just as I was leaving, I met Ethel. Oh, I can't get my breath. Here, sit down. I want to tell you what Ethel told me. You remember that funny-looking woman parading around this afternoon? - No, I didn't see her. - You didn't see her? She can't be described. You wouldn't believe it. I'll tell you, she was quite a number. Her dress was up to here. And paint an inch thick. And bells on her shoes that tinkled... - Oh, not bells! - And bracelets up to here that clanked. You never saw such a sight. Anyway, do you know who she was? - Who? - Laurel Dallas's mother. Laurel Dallas! Oh, I can't believe it! You mean that pretty little girl Dick Grosvenor's been rushing? Yes. Didn't you know her? But are you sure? She seemed so lovely and sweet. Isn't it weird? To have such a common-looking creature for a mother? - Poor thing. - Poor nothing. She's wearing Dick Grosvenor's fraternity pin. - She won't be wearing it long. - Not when Mrs. Grosvenor hears about it. - Your berths are ready, ladies. - Thank you. - I want to tell you about... - Ethel made it so interesting and funny. - Lollie. - It's lonely up there, Mother. I want to come down here and cuddle with you. I'd... I'd like to see Mrs. Morrison. - Was it in reference to... - I couldn't say. It's private. I'd have to see Mrs. Morrison. - What was the name, please? - Mrs. Dallas. Mrs. Stephen Dallas. Yes. I will see if Mrs. Morrison is at home. Come with me, please. - Just wait in there, please. - Yeah. - Are you Mrs. Morrison? - Yes. I'm sorry to bother you in your home, but l... - Won't you sit down? - What I have to say won't take long. - It's just that... - Oh, we may as well be comfortable. It's so very warm. Won't you take off your coat? I know you must think it's funny, me comin' here like this. I'm not gonna beat around the bush, but... what I wanna know is if Stephen was free... if I got a divorce like his lawyer wanted, would... would you two get married? Yes, we would. I'm sorry if it's unpleasant, but... - I'd rather that you knew the truth. - Yeah. Well, what I wanted to know is... if you and Stephen did get married... well, what about Laurel? - Would ya take her too? - Oh, no, Mrs. Dallas. I'm a mother. Do you think I could ever deprive another mother of her own little girl? Yeah, but if the mother didn't want her... I mean, if she couldn't very well have her. - If it was inconvenient. - Inconvenient? Yeah. You see... Lollie's growing up now, and she... well, she's quite a responsibility. Oh, I don't understand. Well, you see, it's this way. From now on, there's lots of things Lollie ought to begin having. I don't mean money, but... dances and parties, you know. Good times, and really I've never been much at that sort of thing. So I feel that I've done about all I can for her. I thought that you being so crazy about her father... and she takin' after him so much that... well, if you and Stephen got married... why, Lollie could come and live with you. And your name bein' Mrs. Dallas, you see... everybody would naturally think she was... your little girl. Then when ya went places, you see... well... You see, you're the kind of a mother... that any girl would be proud of. I didn't know anyone could be so unselfish. And I'll say one thing. You'd never be ashamed of Lollie either. Everybody's just crazy about her. Oh, she makes a wonderful impression. She's so refined and elegant in her ways, but... Oh, you already know that. Anyway, she'd... Well, anyway, she's... Well, she's crazy about you already. She don't talk as much as she used to, but... that's because she thinks I'm jealous or something, and l... Oh, I guess I was a little, but I'm not anymore. And you'll see. In a little while, she'll... Well... in a little while, she'll forget all about me. And it won't be any time before she'll... She'll love you just... just like you were her real mother. And Mrs. Morrison, she's so wonderful. You don't know. I do know. And I know it hasn't come only from her father. I have to go. Lollie doesn't know I've come here, and l... I don't want her to yet. She's awful funny underneath. And I thought it all out. It'll be better... to just let her come for the visit like always... and by that time, it'll all be over. The divorce, I mean. And then... Then you can break it to her. It'll be easier that way. - Board! - Good-bye, darling. - Good-bye. - Go on. Get inside. - Good-bye, Mother. - Good-bye, dear. - You'll write to me, won't you? - Oh, yes, I will. Now have a nice time, and don't think about me. Wear your new blue dress tonight. I wanna see ya in my mind's eye. All right. Bye! I love you! Good-bye! Good-bye, Mother! - It's a lot of fun, isn't it? - Yes. - Haven't you ever played it before? - No, I haven't. John wouldn't go to bed until I promised to bring these in... so you'd still have some family to keep you company tonight. - How sweet. - Oh, that John. - And here's their breakfast. - Gosh! You sure stand high with John. He won't let Lee and me see 'em, let alone feed 'em. I suppose it's time young men removed themselves from ladies' boudoirs. - Okay, Dad. - Good night, sweetheart. - Good night, darling, and sleep well. - I will, thank you. Good night, Laurel. I'll see you in the morning. - Good night, Mother. - I'll put these in a safe place. Oh, I never saw Father so happy before. And you, dear, are you happy? So very, for you both. But... I've been worrying and worrying about something. Why, what could possibly be worrying you? Well, I don't know what to call you. Oh, if that's all. I'm so glad, because I have something to tell you... which I hope will make you just as happy as it has me. From now on, you're going to be one of us really, dear. You're going to be a member of this family like Con and Lee and John. They're your brothers, and this is going to be your home... as much as it is theirs. - This my home? - Yes, dear. You're going to live with us. - Live here? - Here, the town house, wherever we are. Does it make you happy, Laurel? Oh, yes, it makes me very happy... to know that you want me, and I do love you all so very much. But I couldn't leave my mother. Oh, you won't be leaving her. Your mother will always be your mother. I could never expect or even want to take her place in your heart. - You'll visit her whenever you like. - No, I couldn't. Oh, thank you ever and ever so much, Mrs... I mean... Laurel, your mother, your father, all of us who love you... feel that now that you're getting older... there are many advantages that we can give you. I know. And I do thank you. But I'm sorry. - Good night, Con. - Good night, Dad. Yes, dear? What is it, dear? You don't mean you thought that I could live... anywhere ever without Mother. Well, you've lived without me. Your mother and I are just changing places for a while, that's all. Isn't it fair for me to have a little of what she's had all these years? But that's different, Father. You know it is. I've been with Mother all these years because I needed her. Now she needs me, and you need me less than ever. Oh, Laurel, don't say that. I'm sorry if you don't see that what we've planned is for your good. We thought it would make you happy. Your mother and I have decided upon what we think is best for you. - My mother? Does she know? - Certainly. We have your interests equally at heart, haven't we? We both feel that this should be your home for at least a few years. I'm sorry, Father, but please understand. My home will be with my mother as long as I live. Oh, Stephen. Laurel, you don't understand, dear. This was all your mother's idea. Her wish for you. She planned it all herself. Your father had nothing to do with it. She came to see me, and we talked it all over. - She came to you? When? - Yes, dear. Was it just after we got back from the Mirador? Why, I believe it was, but... Oh, my poor mother. My wonderful mother. Oh, she wasn't asleep. She heard what they said. Oh, I must go to her. I must go to her at once! - Darling, tell us about it. - Oh, please, Daddy. Help me. I can't make my visit here. I must go to my mother! Sure you can see him. That ain't meanin' that he can see you. Hey, Munn. Somebody to see ya. Ed. Ed, wake up. It's Stella. Ed, it's me, Stella Dallas. Hello, Stell. Look, I still live in the same old flat. I want you to take this, get a Turkish bath and shave and come right over. Ed, do ya understand? Sure. I got it. Mommy! Lollie! When did you... Well, whatever brought you back? Mother, how could you think... As if I could ever live anywhere else but with you. Well, I thought you'd like it for a while. No, really, you... You always seem to have such a good time with your father. Yes, but good times aren't... Oh, they aren't what make you belong. It's other kind of times. It's when you've cried together... and when you've been through things together. That's when you seem to love the most. It's different when you... Didn't they send a telegram? They said they would. Most likely they tried to deliver it and I was out. I've been on the go. - Put those in water for me, will ya? - Oh, they're lovely. From an old admirer. Ed Munn blew into town. - I've been steppin' out with him. - Ed Munn? Yeah. Now put 'em in water. I want 'em all fixed nice when he gets here. - Mother, you don't mean that you and... - Haven't you fixed 'em yet? Give 'em to me. Get some water. There. That'll tickle him. Don't you remember a long time ago we said... - And you promised about him... - I know what you're driving at. Now let me tell you something. I've spent the best years of my life on you. A woman wants to be something else besides a mother, you know. Well, you will know when you get grown up. You can't explain everything to a child. Now, go on. Run along. I've come back to stay, if you still want me. - Still want you? - Laurel, my dear. Tell me, dear. What is it, angel? What is it? Oh, Daddy! What is it, sweetheart? I thought it was for my sake... she wanted me to come and live with you... and I was so glad and so proud. But it wasn't. It was for him. She wanted to marry him! - Please don't cry. - You knew him. - Yes, I know him. - And she chose him! Oh, Laurel, come upstairs with me, dear. All right. So long. Thanks a lot. Well, hello! You back? Gee, that's great. Who do you think brought me home? Dick Grosvenor. We were just talkin' about you. I'll get him. He's still in the driveway. Oh, no, Con! - I don't want to see him, not now. - Now, now. Oh, no... No, not yet. Go on upstairs, dear. We'll take care of Dick. Hey, Dick! Come on back! Laurel's here. - When did she get back? - She was here when I got here. - How do you do, Mrs. Dallas? - Hello, Dick. - I'm glad to see you again. - I'm glad to see you. Con told me Laurel was here. - All right, fella, that's one on me. - No, she's here! - Hey, Laurel's here, isn't she? - Yes. Won't you stay for dinner? Why, if I'm all right as I am. - Of course. - Lf you don't mind, I'd like to wash up. - Come on up to my room. - Hurry up. Okay, Dad. Stephen, Laurel is here. She's here to stay. Who's accomplished it? Couldn't you read between those pitiful lines? I told you those curtains weren't to be drawn. Open them, please. Yes, madam. Yes. Now you must light the candles, and we must hurry. Yes, madam. Come, dear. It's nearly time for our cue. What's this? Oh, my darling. I was just thinking. I never really thought that my mother... I thought that she would read about the wedding and... even though she was too far away to come, at least she would write to me. Oh, my dear. Do you think if she knew... any distance in the world could keep her away? Then you think she just doesn't know. Sorry, but you can't stand here. We have to keep this clear. Move along, please. Break up the group here. - You too, lady. - Please, let me see her face... when he kisses her. All right, folks. You've seen enough. Come on. Move along, please. Come on. Clear the sidewalk.

Quiet. -I think we'II get on with our work. -Yes, sir. -WeII, is a penciI aII right, sir? -I don't care what you use. . . . . .onIy pIease get on with your work. -Yes, sir. -At once, sir. -Sir, how do you speII "" armada"" ? -Can anyone enIighten this boy? -Yes, sir. A-M-A-R-D-A. -No, no, no. -A-M-A-D-A! -A-R-M-D-A! No, it's A-M-A-R-D-A!  -SiIence! Do you hear me? -SiIence! SiIence! Didn't you hear me? The teacher said, "" SiIence! "" Shut up, you Iunatic! Boys, do you hear me? Sit down! Be quiet! Sit down, boys! -Who did that, sir? I'II kiII him for you, sir. -CoIIey!  What is this? What is happening? Mr. Chipping?! I'm-- I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid I-- WETHERBY: It is just 1 8 years ago this term. . . . . .since I had occasion to cane the entire Iower schooI. The young gentIemen of that day came honestIy by their punishment. I think I can say the same for you. You wiII present yourseIves at my study tomorrow. . . . . .in aIphabeticaI order at intervaIs of three minutes starting at 3:00. I beIieve I can promise you that I have Iost none of my vigor. -I think you better see me after prayers. -Yes, sir. Our profession is not an easy one, Mr. Chipping. It caIIs for something more than a university degree. Our business is to moId men. It demands character and courage. Above aII, it demands the abiIity to exercise authority. Without that, I think any young man shouId ask himseIf seriousIy. . . . . .if he has not perhaps mistaken his vocation. -No, sir-- -When a man is young, Mr. Chipping. . . . . .there are many waIks of Iife open to him. I hope you don't mean I shouId resign. I shouId be very reIuctant to do that, sir. It means everything to me to come to BrookfieId. I'II get on. -PIease give me the chance to prove it, sir. -I am wiIIing to forget the incident. . . . . .but wiII those boys forget it? You're going to have to face them again. That'II take courage. MoraI courage. -However, if you care to make the triaI-- -Thank you, sir. -I shaII watch your progress with interest. -Thank you, sir. I'm deepIy gratefuI to you. HeIIo, Chipping. I hear the boys gave you a rough time. They wiII not do it again, Mr. Bingham, I assure you. Before we Ieave I want to wish our cricket 1 1 . . . . . .the best of Iuck against Sedbury this afternoon. This year, Sedbury cIaims to be sending us the finest team. . . . . .that ever came out of a very fine schooI. WeII, we shaII give them a hearty weIcome. We shaII give them a big tea, but I venture to predict. . . . . .we shaII not give them the cup. The boys are unusuaIIy quiet. What does it mean? Something has occurred. What is it? WeII, sir, it's reaIIy no business of mine, but-- -I think, sir, perhaps I can expIain. WETHERBY: You, Mr. Chipping? Yes, sir. I'm keeping my cIass in this afternoon. -That means Maynard, our best pIayer-- -PIease, Mr. Shane. Sir, I'd entireIy forgotten about the cricket match. -Forgotten? -Yes. My attention was drawn to the fact by my cIass in such an insoIent manner. . . . . .I thought it inadvisabIe to go back on my decision. WETHERBY: You observe the effect on the schooI? I do indeed, sir. It's most regrettabIe.    BO Y: Go on! Run it out! Run! Run! -No, no, get back, you ass! -Get back! -Get back! Get back! REFEREE: Out! We've Iost. -Bad Iuck, Maynard. CHIPPING: CoIIey. AII right, sir. Sedbury's beaten us. We've Iost the cup. Not just us, it's the whoIe schooI. You don't care how the feIIows feeI. You don't want to be Iiked! Perhaps you don't mind being hated! Boys. . . . . .I'd Iike to say that my judgment, in the first pIace, was hasty and iII-advised. And no one regrets more than Dr. Wetherby. . . . . .that my authority had to be upheId. If I've Iost your friendship, there's IittIe Ieft that I vaIue. You may go. -Latton. -Lemare. -Ligbottom. -MiIIer. MitcheII.  -Wagstaff. -WaIIington. -WaIters primus. -WaIters secundus.  AImighty Father, thou who has watched over us and protected us here at work. . . . . .grant that the hoIidays ahead may be to us a source of rest and refreshment. And that we may empIoy the happy time of Ieisure with grace and wisdom. . . . . .to the greater gIory of thy son, our Lord. -Amen. -Amen. Sorry, sir. And where are you going to spend the hoIidays?  -Have a good hoIiday, Matthews. -Thanks awfuIIy, sir. -Where are you going? -FoIkestone, sir. -Oh. -Hey, Johnson, wait for me. Mr. Chipping. You remember me? Hargreaves. Of course, I remember you, but you've grown, you know. Do you remember the day we met in the train? Oh, I remember, yes. You toId me to cheer up, and I nearIy drowned you in tears. It was my first term as weII. If you hadn't started first. . . . . .I shouId have done the crying myseIf. I heard that you were Ieaving here a few years ago. Yes, I was going to Ieave. I was going to be a cIassics master at Harrow. . . . . .but it just didn't happen though. Perhaps I shouIdn't mention it, but I rather expect to be housemaster next term. -Woodward is Ieaving. -That's spIendid. CongratuIations. -Thank you. -I suppose I'm keeping you. . . . . .from your packing. Goodbye, Mr. Chipping. Goodbye, Hargreaves. GIad to have seen you. WeII, here we are. Now, who wiII have a piece? -Raven. -Thanks, StaefeI. -OgiIvie? -Cake. Where'd you get that, schnitzeI? -It was a present from my German cIass. -Good. I can't understand these EngIish boys. The whoIe term, they behaved to me Iike 50 deviIs. Then today, they make me a speech, they give me a cake. . . . . .and I burst out of tears. -Into tears, StaefeI. In EngIish the-- -Shut up, OgiIvie. The term's over. -Chipping, cake? -That's very nice of you. Thank you. -Mind if I borrow this? -Go ahead. ""H.G. WeIIs. "" Never heard of him. His first. He won't come to much. He's too fantastic. -Where do you go for your hoIidays? -Harrogate. He aIways does. HeIIo, Jenks. Cut yourseIf a piece of cake. You wiII have your IittIe jokes. Headmaster's compIiments, sir. He'd Iike to see you in his study, immediate. I'II bet that's about taking over Woodward's house. -CongratuIations, Chipping. -Thank you very much. -You certainIy deserve it after aII this time. -It's quite a surprise, if it's true. Though, mind you, I had rather hoped. -But I better get aIong. -WeII, good Iuck. Good Iuck, Chipping. STAEFEL: See, Chipping. I knock on wood for you. Thanks. Thanks. I expect you've guessed why I wanted to see you, Mr. Chipping. -WeII. . . . -Sit down. Thank you. Mr. Woodward's retirement Ieaves a housemastership vacant. -Yes, sir. -You are the senior master. NormaIIy the vacancy wouId go to you. That is why I feeI that, in fairness to you, I shouId teII you personaIIy. . . . . .why the governors and I have decided to appoint Mr. WiIkinson. We feIt that with your unusuaI gifts of getting work out of the boys. . . . . .that you'd rather concentrate on teaching. . . . . .and Ieave the rather tiresome job of housemaster to someone. . . -. . .with speciaI gifts in that direction. -I understand, sir. Though I doubt if Mr. WiIkinson wiII ever turn out. . . . . .as many minor Latin poets as you have. I quite understand, sir. Yes. I thought you wouId. -Just off for the hoIidays, Mr. Chipping? -Yes, yes. To Harrogate. Oh, you are. WeII, have a pIeasant time. -Thank you. -Goodbye, Mr. Chipping. Goodbye.     STAEFEL: May I come in? -Oh, yes. Do. It's got dark, hasn't it? Chipping, I hear. . . . -Is it true that WiIkinson--? -Yes, it's true. -I'm sorry. -Thank you, StaefeI. I won't say I'm not disappointed because I am. There it is. -Forgive my bursting in. -Yes, of course. The fact is, I wanted to make a suggestion. I pIanned a waIking tour to my own country. . . . . .through TyroI, to SaIzkammergut, to Vienna. Do come with me. Me, go abroad? You'II Iike it, I'm sure. You Iike to cIimb, you say. The country is beautifuI. It's very good of you, but it's out of the question. But why? TeII me that. WeII, for one thing, I've booked my rooms at Harrogate. Harrogate! Must you aIways go to Harrogate? WeII, I daresay, I am in need of a change, but-- -But you don't care for my company. -Oh, no, StaefeI. I shouId be very gIad. As a matter of fact, I often feeI IoneIy. -There is no more to be said. It is settIed. -But, StaefeI-- I'II arrange everything! We meet the train tonight. Pack yourseIf, Chipping! StaefeI, Iisten! MAN: Bye, schnitzeI. Have a good time. STAEFEL: Thank you. I shaII. -And Chipping is coming with me too. MAN: What, oId Chipping going abroad? STAEFEL: To TyroI, he shaII cIimb! MAN: WeII, don't break your necks! MAN: Such a heavy mist. It is strange. So early in the year. Does he know anything of cIimbing, the EngIish gentIeman? He hasn't cIimbed for years. Is it safe, do you think? If he stops stiII he wiII be weII enough. But if he's fooIish enough to start cIimbing down. . . . . .there are bad pIaces. This is a nice business. I couId be here aII night.  HeIIo! HeIIo! Good heavens! A woman. HeIIo! HeIIo! Are you in danger? WeII, upon my word. HeIIo! WOMAN: HeIIo. I can't see you. Here I am. HeIIo there. I thought I heard a voice. -Are you aII right? -Yes, quite. Thanks. -The mist's a nuisance, isn't it? -You're not in danger? No. Do you mind? -No, of course not, but-- -You shouIdn't move about. It's fooIish. FooIish? But I heard you caII. I thought you needed heIp. -Don't say you cIimbed up to rescue me! -As a matter of fact, I did. ReaIIy, I shouId be very angry. Supposing you'd faIIen. -I must say-- -I never head of such utter stupidity! -Where were you? -On the Gamsteig. You cIimbed in that mist to rescue me. . . . . .when I'm a better cIimber than you are. -WeII, what were you screaming about? -I wasn't. I just Iet out a shout at random. So that was why. When I think that road might have been paved with your good intentions. ReaIIy, it was idiotic of you. -And rather wonderfuI. -Not at aII. WeII, anyway, I'm gIad you came. It was going to be very IoneIy. Won't you sit down? This is quite comfortabIe, as rocks go. Thank you. My name is Chipping. Mine's EIIis. Katherine EIIis. Won't you have a sandwich? I've got Ioads here. This one is. . . -. . .ham. -Thank you. I ate mine earIy. I am rather hungry. I'm sorry I wasn't in any danger. It was rather inconsiderate of you. What are you doing aIone on the mountain? Isn't it unusuaI for a young Iady? I'm not usuaIIy aIone. I have a friend at the inn. -Oh, so have I. We're on a waIking tour. -ReaIIy? We're bicycIing. -BicycIing? Through Austria? -Mm-hm. Good heavens, I didn't know Iadies rode those awfuI things. I'm afraid so. With one Ieg on each side of the saddIe? WeII, you don't imagine I ride sidesaddIe, do you? What happens to your. . . . . .dress? Oh, they breed femaIe bicycIes now, didn't you know? Ladies riding bicycIes. I don't approve of this rushing around on wheeIs. The other day a man passed me at 1 5 miIes an hour! You know, humans were never intended to go that speed. I suppose you think I'm oId-fashioned. I Iike men to be oId-fashioned. -Have another? -You're sure? Thank you. We reserve these for emergencies. It's chiIIy, isn't it? Oh, I say, I shouId have thought of it. I'm so sorry. Here. -Do have this. I'm rather warm. -I wouIdn't think of it. Put it on. You must have it. ReaIIy. I insist. PIease. Why don't we share it? It's big enough for both of us. -No. Someone might see you. -On this mountain? What if they did? -But I don't need it. ReaIIy, I don't. -I insist. Look, Iike this. Take hoId of it. There. Don't worry. We'II find our friends. If a search party's going, I insist on coming. -But I-- -That's finaI. A penny for your thoughts. Oh, as a matter of fact, I was thinking of you. KindIy, I hope. I see very IittIe of Iadies at BrookfieId. I was rather reaIizing what I missed. If I may say so, I think the Iadies have missed a great deaI too. It's very kind of you, but I'm not a Iadies' man. -Afraid of them? -Terrified. -Not of me, I hope. -No, not up here in the cIouds. Perhaps the aItitude's gone to my head, but at the inn-- Because I'm a strong-minded femaIe who rides a bicycIe? Oh, no. No, on the contrary. -Because-- -Because? WeII, because you're so very nice-Iooking, I think, and charming. So are you, Mr. Chipping, frankIy. Good heavens, no one has ever caIIed me that! What extraordinary ideas come into one's head up here. -It's the aItitude. -Do you experience a sort of exhiIaration? -DefiniteIy. -As though we owned the mountain? -To put it miIdIy. -We're pretty superior persons. We're gods! Up here there's no time. . . . . .no growing oId. . . -. . .nothing Iost. -We're young. -We beIieve in ourseIves. -We have faith in the future. It must be the aItitude. Do you suppose a person in middIe-age couId start Iife over again. . . . . .and make a go of it? I'm sure of it. Quite sure. It must be tremendousIy interesting to be a schooImaster. I thought so once. To watch boys grow up and heIp them aIong. . . . . .see their characters deveIop and what they become. . . . . .when they Ieave schooI and the worId gets hoId of them. I don't see how you couId ever get oId. . . . . .in a worId that's aIways young. I never reaIIy thought of it that way. When you taIk about it, you make it sound exciting and heroic. It is. And the schooImaster? Is he exciting and heroic too? I've met onIy one. . . . . .a reckIess person. . . . . .who cIimbed the GIockner in a mist to. . . . Oh, Iook! The mist is Iifting. We can go down now. Yes. I'm aImost sorry. It was an adventure, wasn't it? It was. WeII, back to reaIity! I see them! They're together, Iook! You are right! HeIIo! CHIPPING: HeIIo! KATHERINE: HeIIo! It is Kathy! Oh, thank heaven! Come on! And to the speciaI heaIth of the hero of the mist. Der hochwohlgeborene Herr Von Chipping. Herr Von Chipping! Servus! But I did nothing. Nothing at aII. Modest feIIow. The minute I Iet him out of my sight, he becomes a hero! Oh, nonsense. This is absurd. I mereIy-- You were wonderfuI, I'm going to kiss you. My dear young Iady, reaIIy, I'm at a Ioss. Miss EIIis, good night. I hope you'II be none the worse. -Good night, why? -Yes, I'm rather tired. -I think I'II go to bed. -To bed?  No, no, no, no. I have food for you. A gouIash, strudeI. Perhaps you can send it up to my room. -Good night, you wonderfuI man. -Good night. Thank you again, you were very kind. Not at aII. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night, everybody. -Good night! Good night. MAN: Let us have a song. Something gay for the Fraulein. KATHERINE: Thank you. That's sweet of you.    WOMAN: Katherine, what are you doing? Looking at my mountain in the moonIight. I shouId've thought you'd seen enough of it. It's going to be a rather thriIIing memory back in BIoomsbury. It's a pity your knight errant was such an oId stick-in-the-mud. -FIora! -He might have been young. . . . . .and spIendid-Iooking. Then you wouId've known you'd met your fate. He isn't at aII oId, darIing. And I think he's quite charming. -Kathy! -I mean it. He's just shy, FIora. And a IittIe difficuIt to know, perhaps. I'm sorry for shy peopIe. They must be. . . . . .awfuIIy IoneIy sometimes. Chipping, you shouId have stayed. It was quite a party. -I'm not much good at that sort of thing. -A pity. They wanted so much to give you an evening. They did? I didn't understand. I hope I wasn't rude. Oh, no. They understood. Miss Kathy asked me to say goodbye and to thank you again. -Goodbye? -Yes. They're going away. . . . . .earIy in the morning. On their bicycIes. WeII, I'm sIeepy. Are you coming? Yes.  You are so siIent. What are you thinking? That was a very inteIIigent young woman, StaefeI. She was a very pretty one, Chipping. I wonder if we might run into them again on our traveIs. WeII, we must Iook out for two bright new bicycIes. MAN: EngIish Iadies, quite EngIish. CHIPPING: It is them. STAEFEL: Mm-hm. They're acquaintances of mine. WiII you give them my card, pIease? -TeII them I'd Iike to have a word. -CertainIy, mein Herr.  HardIy dressed for Iadies, are we? -ShaII we not ask them to Iunch with us? -I don't see any objection. The Iadies are here. Is this the person? -WeII, you stated that you knew me. -Madam, the fact is-- -You toId the porter we were acquainted? -No, not exactIy. Not exactIy! Did he or did he not?  -What is your purpose in accosting us? -Madam, I had hoped-- You had hoped? WeII, this isn't the first time we've been subjected to unweIcome attentions. But I warn you, young man! If I so much as set eyes on you again. . . . . .I shaII pIace myseIf and my friend under the protection of the British ConsuI!  Why do they caII it the BIue Danube? It Iooks brown to me. There's a Iegend, you know. Yes. The Danube is onIy bIue to the eyes of. . . -. . .weII, to peopIe in Iove, you know. -How so. You surprise me. -Vienna's a pretty big city, isn't it? -Pretty big. -Lots of tourists go there, I suppose. -Droves of them. Chipping? The Danube doesn't by any chance Iook bIue to you, does it? What do you mean? Nonsense! You do taIk the most infernaI rot sometimes, reaIIy. KATHERINE: OnIy two weeks more. It seems such a IittIe whiIe. -Let's not think about the end tiII it comes. -It has been fun. And now Vienna. Don't you hope it's gay and romantic? WeII, they say it is. But then they said the Danube was bIue. But, FIora, dear. It is bIue. Thank you. Thank you. Miss EIIis, weII! And Miss-- Oh, weII of aII the. . . . -WeII, how do you do? -Why, Mr. Chipping. And, miss, how are you? I'd just about given you up. -I hoped I'd run into you. -And now we have. -Extraordinary. -We aIways meet in a mist. We do, don't we?  Oh, yes, of course. I'm so sorry. We'd better move on. StaefeI, I say. StaefeI! I found Miss EIIis. And on the boat aII the time. WeII, what a surprise.  Oh, yes, of course. Come.  Just think, it was in this baIIroom. . . . . .that Prince Metternich drew up the treaty of the five kingdoms. . . . . .nearIy 1 00 years ago. Doesn't that interest you? I must confess, the historicaI significance of the baIIroom doesn't impress me at aII. Whenever in days to come I think of this pIace, and I shaII think of it. . . . . .I shaII say that's the pIace where I dined with. . . . . .weII, with you. Thank you, Mr. Chipping. TeII me, are those two. . .? -Do you think they're. . .? -In Iove? No. WeII, I wouIdn't know. Have you never been in Iove, Mr. Chipping? No. Oh, yes. Yes, I was once. Oh, I thought so. Rather a Iong time ago. I was 1 4 at the time. She was the greengrocer's daughter. And Papa and Mama intervened, I suppose. Yes. So did the greengrocer. Pity this aII has to end tomorrow. For us, but not for you. You have three weeks more. Oh, yes, yes. That's true, but. . . . It's been wonderfuI. For me too. What wiII stand out in your memory? Oh, I don't know. Schonbrunn and the emperor driving by, the whipped cream. . . . . .the music. What wiII you remember? I reaIIy can't say. ShaII I teII you? -Can you? -The waItz you danced in Vienna. -WaItz I danced-- What? When? -Tonight. Now. Oh, but I couIdn't possibIy. I don't dance. Good heavens, I haven't danced since coIIege. Are you turning me down? In front of these peopIe? No, reaIIy. It's out of the question. WeII, of course, if you'd reaIIy rather not. It wouId have been fun just once before going home. Miss Kathy. . . . . .may I have the pIeasure of this dance? I shaII be happy, Mr. Chipping.  Did I drink too much wine? -Liking it? -Loving it. -As much as you'd hoped? -And more. You're doing spIendidIy. Now reverse. -Reverse? -Round the other way. Evening dress is very becoming to you, Mr. Chipping. -You approve? -HeartiIy. WonderfuI, isn't it? Reverse. Miss Kathy, a penny for those soIemn thoughts. I was thinking of tomorrows and raiIway stations. . . . . .and goodbyes. -I hope you'II have a comfortabIe journey. -I hope so too. What time do you get to London? -Oh, I asked you that before, didn't I? -Yes. -Isn't saying goodbye awfuI? -Yes. It's awfuI. Know what I mean? It's so-- Oh, it is. Very, very. Oh. -Rather a crowded train, isn't it? -You said that before too. Did I? It's saying goodbye, you know. I know. It's awfuI. -Miss Kathy? -Yes? I wanted to say something to you.  -Dear, it's time. FLORA: Come aIong. -Goodbye, Mr. Chipping. -Goodbye. Can't you remember? I wanted to say that you made this the most wonderfuI hoIiday of my Iife. FLORA: Kathy! STAEFEL: Miss Kathy? You must go. -Goodbye, Miss Kathy. -Goodbye, Mr. Chips. Miss Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! -You kissed me! -I know. It was dreadfuI of me. No. But do you--? Are we--? Oh, this is awfuI. Look here, you'II have to marry me now, you know. -Do you want to? -Do I want to? Do you? -DreadfuIIy! -Oh. -Goodbye, my dear. -Kathy! You can't go now, my dearest! Goodbye, my dearest. Bye! She's gone. I don't know where she's gone. -I may never see her again. -I shouIdn't worry, Chipping. Miss FIora has seIected the church aIready, and I'm to be best man. My good feIIow, do you imagine that we were both bIind and deaf? We are going to open a bottIe of champagne. . . . . .at the first cafe that we come to. MAN: "" Married at St. James' Church, BIoomsbury. . . . . .Katherine Mary, onIy daughter of the Iate Henry Forbes EIIis. . . . . .to CharIes Edward Chipping of BrookfieId SchooI. "" -BrookfieId SchooI? -It's not possibIe. -Chipping? It can't be! -See for yourseIf. Fantastic! Hey, StaefeI, you sIy oId dog, did you know about this? -Of course I know. -I suppose she's eIderIy. -I wouId hardIy caII her that. -PIain as a post, I suppose. My dear feIIows, pIease, she's Chipping's choice. -Is it as bad as that? -No. Do I give a wrong impression? She's a good creature. Her nose is perhaps a IittIe red. -Good Gad! Does she drink? -No. It is onIy indigestion. -WeII, I'm off. -No, pIease. I toId Chipping to bring her to meet you this afternoon. You must be kind to her, for Chipping's sake. -He's bringing her here? -He might have kept her to himseIf! Women aren't aIIowed in this room. Shh. I hear them. I must say, this is a nice start to a term. -HeIIo. -CongratuIations! -CongratuIations! -Thank you. My wife wouId Iike to meet you. May I bring her in for a moment? Kathy. These are my coIIeagues. Mr. McCuIIoch, Mr. OgiIvie, Mr. Baucovy, Mr. Raven. . . . . .Mr. Porter-Watson, Mr. HiIdersIey, Mr. Murdoch. It's so nice to meet you aII, and a IittIe terrifying. -Won't you sit down? -Yes, yes. Do, do. I oughtn't to break in to a private room. -No, no. Not reaIIy. -It isn't private. -CertainIy not. -Chips toId me it was terribIy private. Chips? My dear, I toId you not to. It's just a nickname she's given me. Chips! Why didn't we think of that? You wiII stay and have some tea with us, Mrs. Chips? -WeII, thank you. I don't beIieve-- -ReaIIy, you must. I insist. -WeII, then I'd better pour it out. -I'II get some more cups. -May I? -Thank you. Thank you. -McCuIIoch doesn't drink tea. -Nonsense! Of course I do. FrequentIy. -See her? -Is she oId? Shut up! -Can't see if you keep shoving me. -Who's shoving? -What's aII this, you kids? -Mrs. Chipping's in there. What's she Iike? She's not much oIder than some of us, and she caIIs him "" Chips.

Brown and the rest of you, this is Mrs. Chipping. BO YS: How do you do, Mrs. Chipping? I hope we'II meet again soon. In fact, I know we are. Mr. Chipping wants to give a tea party every Sunday. What? It wouId be nice if you boys start the baII roIIing next Sunday. -Thank you very much. -Thank you. -You said 4:00, didn't you, dear? -Oh, yes, of course. 4:00 then. We shaII Iook forward to it. Good night. -Good night, Mrs. Chipping. -Goodbye, Mrs. Chipping. -Not bad, eh? -She's pretty. Pretty? She's wonderfuI.  KATHERINE: Now, BuIIock, you can't find room for just one more muffin? No, thank you. ReaIIy, Mrs. Chipping. Last muffin means a handsome wife and 1 0,000 a year. I shouId risk it for the sake of the future Mrs. BuIIock. -Mrs. BuIIock! -Mrs. BuIIock! -Why, Martin, you hardIy ate anything. -I'm in training. He's one of our best footbaIIers. He'II get his coIors next term. -ReaIIy? -Oh, yes. -Do you think we'II beat Sedbury? -We ought to. -The Sedbugs are funks anyway. -What, MitcheII? Sedbugs. That's our name for them. Oh, I see. What do they caII you, the BrookfIeas? If you do win, Mr. Chipping and I must give you a feast of victory. You'II wear vine Ieaves and eat muffins Iying on couches. . . . . .Iike the ancient Romans.  I'm sorry to interrupt your cIassicaI Iesson, but there's the beII. . . . . .and these ancient Romans wiII be Iate for chapeI. I haven't enjoyed a party so much for ages. Come again soon. -Oh, thank you. -Thank you. Now, don't be Iate for chapeI, or you'II get us into troubIe. -No, we won't. -Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, sir. -Goodbye. -Goodbye, sir. -Goodbye. -What a nice Iot they are. -They certainIy are when you know them. Though what authority I shaII have in cIass after these orgies-- Ten times more because now they Iook on you as a friend. What a revoIutionary you are. Try one of those jokes you've kept hidden away, see what happens. No. There's a Iimit, even to revoIutions.  A woman. . .  . . .of the pIebeian cIass. Can anyone teII me what is the lex canuleia? It was the Iaw that aIIowed patricians to marry pIebeians. As a matter of fact, it was a very handy Iaw. . . . . .because if Mr. Patrician toId Miss PIebs he was very sorry he couIdn't marry her. . . . . .after they'd made the lex canuleia. . . . . .she probabIy repIied, ""Oh, yes, you can, you Iiar. ""  Canuleia! That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. Thank you. BuIIock! It's very kind of you to show such vioIent appreciation of my joke. . . . . .but we mustn't return you to your parents with a broken bIood vesseI. ""Mr. Pickwick was sufficientIy fired with Mr. Pott's enthusiasm. . . . . .to appIy his whoIe time and attention to the proceedings--""  Lights out. -Are you taking dormitory inspection? -Yes, shan't be Iong. -Chips! -Yes? Cough a IittIe before you come to number 1 1 . Now, Kathy, why? Jones Minor got a box from home today. Did you ever have a dormitory feast? WeII, I do remember once, but that's beside the point. Is it? I think you're trying to puII BrookfieId down stone by stone. Hm. Thought I heard a noise. Must have been the cat.  -Merry Christmas, sir. -Thank you. -BuIIock, go easy on the mince pies. -Merry Christmas. -Say goodbye to Mrs. Chipping for me. -Yes. -I'm bringing Mrs. Chipping siIkworms. -How very nice. Thank you. -Mater hopes you'II see us, sir. -I wiII. My uncIe's taking us to the Drury Lane pantomime. Then you'II see Dan Leno. I beIieve he's even funnier than I am. Beg your pardon, sir. The headmaster says, wouId you see him in his room? -At once? -Yes, sir. Yes, of course. WeII, goodbye. I must go. -Goodbye, sir. -Merry Christmas. What do you suppose the head wants with me? There. How do you think it Iooks, NeIIie? Oh, it's ever so beautifuI, ma'am. CHIPPING: Kathy! Where are you? -I'm here, dear. Kathy, such news! They're making me housemaster. Longhurst's Ieaving, the head's offering me his house. DarIing! Oh, darIing. I'm so happy. Not that it's any more than you deserve. Longhurst, it's a IoveIy oId house. It's 1 8th century, isn't it? Yes, I beIieve so. There's a most imposing Iibrary for you and a greenhouse with a grapevine. We ought to have Iighter paint in the haII. It's a IittIe gIoomy. Now, now. The bedrooms are IoveIy. There's a IittIe room I aIways thought wouId be perfect for the nursery. -You aIways thought? -But of course, dear. I was sure you'd be housemaster one day. . . . . .just as I'm sure that one day you'II be head. I've been trying to make up my mind which of the houses I Iike best. -The presumption of the woman! -Imagine. Longhurst wiII have to be caIIed Chipping's now. Chipping's? Oh, of course. Yes. WeII, weII. Oh, I'm so proud. -I do beIieve you reaIIy meant it too. -Meant what? I might be headmaster one of these days. My darIing, you're a very sweet person and a very human person. . . . . .and a very modest person. You have aII sorts of unexpected gifts and quaIities. So unexpected that you keep surprising even me with them. Never be afraid that you can't do anything you've made up your mind to. As Iong as you beIieve in yourseIf. . . . . .you can go as far as you dream. CertainIy you'II be headmaster, if you want to. Don't move. I've brought something for a ceIebration. Max, what a IoveIy surprise. It isn't every day our friend becomes a housemaster. We haven't drank wine together since that evening in Vienna, remember? The beautifuI BIue Danube. The Danube wouId certainIy be bIue for both of you tonight. To Herr Von Chipping of Chipping's House. . . . . .and to Frau Von Chipping, the most sweet Iady in the worId. And to you, dear Max, we shaII never forget you. What was it we said in the cafe that night my hero rescued me? Servus? -Servus, Max. -Servus. -Now you shaII make a toast, Miss Kathy. -What shaII I say? I know. Max, Chips, to the future. -To the future. -To the future. Yes, sir. Is it true that Iady spiders eat their husbands? -With certain species, yes. -Be carefuI not to marry a spider, CoIIey. WeII, thank you, sir. We mustn't keep you, sir. It was joIIy decent of you to expIain it. Can't think what boys are coming to. ApriI the 1 st, and they stand around and ask siIIy questions about spiders. When I was their age, a master's Iife used to be a purgatory on ApriI FooIs' Day. WeII, times are changing. I must be off. See you at Iunch. -Is it over? -No. No. I'm afraid it's going to be a bad time. I must go back at once. I came down to teII you. . . . . .that we're doing everything we can. I'II come back again directIy as possibIe. It's best for you to stay here, oId man. PIease. -What's aII this? -Bring the postmark across this Ietter. It's an ApriI fooI for Chips. He'II think they're reaIIy Ietters, onIy they're nothing but bIank paper. -I don't see much in that. -That's the point. There isn't. Chips wiII see the joke. He's good at seeing jokes IateIy. Have you heard the news? Chips is having a baby. -Chips is? -Mrs. Chips, you fooI. Just Iike oId Chips, he wouId have a baby on ApriI FooIs' Day. Mrs. Chipping? Yes, NeIIie, and the baby too.  I'II send the message to the common room. Someone eIse can take your cIass. -It's aII right. -But, Chips, there's no need-- BO Y: He came in! PIease, sir. There are a Iot of Ietters for you. Oh. Thank you, HenIey. -First of ApriI, sir! -ApriI fooI!  BO Y: ApriI fooIs!  WiII you turn to page 29? CoIIey? CoIIey, wiII you begin?  The Roman ambassadors. . .  . . .crossed. . .  . . .from Carthage. . .  . . .as it had been commanded to them. . .  . . .into Rome. . .  . . .into Spain. . .  . . .in order that they might approach the state. . .  . . .and entice them. . .  . . .into an aIIiance. -Owen. -O'Hara. -Pearson. -PringIe. Pendennis. Ewart. EIIison. Easton. Eddington. Fairbank. Finch. Fortescue. -We've got a new teIephone at home. -Does it work? No. -Beddington. -Bickersteth. BeII. -Stinks voIunteered for South Africa. -Crikey, that's tough on the Boers! -Smith. -Simpson. I'm going to Queen Victoria's funeraI. Won't it seem funny having a king?  -Lewis. -Livingston. -Logan. -Lister. Did you hear? -Some French chap's fIown the ChanneI. -What? -MansfieId. -MaxweII. -Martin. -MitcheII. Hey, boy, you! Come here. -WeII, haven't you got a name? -Yes, sir. -Is it a secret? -No, sir. It's Morgan, sir. Derek Morgan. Oh, a Morgan, eh? I might have known, trousers too short. Morgans aIways grow out of their trousers. Run aIong. -Yes. -The head wouId Iike to see you. Oh, he wouId, eh? Thank you. You'd better take over for me, wiII you?  BO Y: You beast! I'II kiII you for that. Hey, hey! Boys, boys! Get up! Stop it! Stop it at once. Get up! Get up! Come on. Get up.  A disgracefuI exhibition. Did no one ever teII you to keep your hands up? Keep them up. It's a wonder both your eyes aren't cIosed. -New? -Yes, sir. -What's your name? -CoIIey. A famiIiar name at BrookfieId. My grandfather's John CoIIey, chairman of the schooI governors. He's a scrapper too. Caned him more than once. I'II do the same for you. -What's your name? -Perkins, sir. I gather you're engaged in the vegetabIe business. -Do your duties incIude brawIing? -He caIIed me a town cheese. -He said I was a stuck-up snob. -A "" town cheese"" ? That was iII-mannered of you, CoIIey. Shake hands. No more of this nonsense. I've got to get aIong. Hurry up. That's better. If you knocked some sense into each other, the afternoon hasn't been wasted. -Come in, Mr. Chipping. -Thank you. -Sit down. -Oh, thanks. Have you ever thought you wouId Iike to retire? No, I've never thought about it. The suggestion's there for you to consider. The governors wouId grant you an adequate pension. I don't want to retire. I've no need to consider it. In that case, things wiII be a IittIe difficuIt. Why difficuIt? -Do you want me to be quite bIunt? -Oh, yes, of course. Look at that gown you're wearing. It's a subject of amusement to the schooI. I toId you I wanted the new styIe of Latin pronunciation taught. . . -. . .and you totaIIy ignored it. -Oh, that. Nonsense, in my opinion. What's the good of teaching boys to say ""Kikero"" when they'II stiII say Cicero? Instead of vicissim, you'd make them say "" wekissem. "" I'm trying to make BrookfieId an up-to-date schooI. . . . . .and you insist on cIinging to the past. -The worId's changing. -I know the worId's changing, Dr. RaIston. I've seen the oId traditions dying one by one. Grace, dignity, feeIing for the past. AII that matters today is a fat banking account. You're trying to run the schooI Iike a factory. . . . . .for turning out moneymaking snobs! You've raised the fees, and the boys who reaIIy beIong have been frozen out. Modern methods, intensive training, poppycock! Give a boy a sense of humor and proportion, and he'II stand up to anything. I'm not going to retire. You can do what you Iike about it. He toId Chips he's got to retire, but Chips said he wouIdn't. I shouId think not. He's been here hundreds of years. He used to cane my father. If Chips went, the schooI wouId faII down. -I never heard such rot. -What's the rumpus? RaIston wants to kick Chips out. Says he's got to retire. What? Get rid of Chips? He just better try. If he says another word to Chips, I'II kiII him. The governors don't want you to resign. BrookfieId wouIdn't be the same without you. You can stay here untiI you're 1 00 if you feeI Iike it. -We hope you wiII. -We do indeed. Sir John, gentIemen. . . . . .it is good of you, John, of aII of you. . . . . .to take this troubIe for an oId man. But before I avaiI myseIf of your confidence. . . . . .I shouId Iike to persuade the head that in these times. . . . . .BrookfieId has need of both of us. That's generous of you, Chips. But wiII it work? I'II shaII see to it that it does. I'm even going to teach my Latin cIass to say Kikero! A few years of that, and I'II have to retire. Five years ago this summer, when I was new to BrookfieId. . . . . .I ventured to suggest to Mr. Chipping. . . . . .that it was time for him to retire. I was as new as that.  I even persuaded him to repIace the venerabIe garment. . . . . .that had become another BrookfieId tradition.  Today, no one regrets. . . . . .more sincereIy than I do. . . . . .that he finaIIy feeIs himseIf compeIIed to take my hint.  I invite you aII to join me in a toast. . . . . .to Chips of BrookfieId! To Chips of BrookfieId! BO Y: SchooI! Three cheers for Chips. -Hip-hip-hurrah! -Hurrah! -Hip-hip-hurrah! -Hurrah! -Hip-hip-hurrah! -Hurrah! We aII know that Mr. Chipping's retirement is a great Ioss to BrookfieId. . . . . .but we hope that he wiII have many Iong and happy years.  I'm not going to teII Mr. Chipping what we paid for the present. . . . . .because, weII, that's rude.  I beIieve he'd Iike to know that every boy in the schooI subscribed to it. . . . . .and every subscription was coIIected without force of any kind.  Mr. Chipping, we want you to accept this IittIe token of esteem. . . . . .from the boys of BrookfieId. It's meant to keep biscuits in.  Boys of BrookfieId. . . . . .I'm afraid Wainwright has been guiIty of exaggeration. . . . . .in speaking of my services to BrookfieId. But then, of course, he does come of an exaggerating famiIy.  I remember I once had to punish his father for it. I gave him one mark for Latin transIation. . . . . .and he exaggerated it into a seven.  I've seen a good many changes at BrookfieId. I remember so much. . . . . .I sometimes think I ought to write a book. What shaII I caII it? Memories of Rod and Lines?  I may write it one day. I may forget some things, but I never forget your faces. If you come and see me in the years to come, as I hope you wiII. . . . . .you may see me hesitate. You'II say to yourseIf, ""The oId boy doesn't remember me. "" But I do remember you, as you are now. That's the point. In my mind, you remain boys. . . . . .just as you are this evening. Sometimes when peopIe speak of Sir John CoIIey. . . . . .our chairman of governors. . . . . .I think to myseIf, "" Yes, a joIIy IittIe chap with hair that sticks up on top. . . . . .and absoIuteIy no idea of Latin verbs. ""  AIthough I am resigning, I shaII stiII be near the schooI. I shaII Iive at Mrs. Wickett's house, just opposite Main Arch. WeII, remember me sometimes. I shaII aIways remember you.  I need not transIate it for you.  WeII, good night. And thank you. -GIad you won't be far away. -Anytime you need me. I shan't hesitate. -And, Chips. . . -Hm? . . .when you write that book of yours. . . . . .remember that in addition to aII those boys you taught. . . . . .you managed to teach something to at Ieast one headmaster. Goodbye. -Good night, Jenks. -Good night, sir. We're aII sorry at Iosing you, sir. Thank you, Jenks. Do you know, sir, I aIways kind of thought that you'd be headmaster here one day. Did you? WeII, so did. . . . . .someone eIse once. -Any news, Jenks? -Oh, nothing very much, sir. -An Austrian archduke's been murdered. -Oh, dear. -WeII, good night, Jenks. -Good night, Mr. Chipping, sir.  BO Y 1 : It's the Manchester Regiment. They're off to the front. BO Y 2: Isn't it exciting, sir? CHIPPING: Is it? WeII, I suppose it is. BO Y 3: I bet those tommies wish they had a band Iike ours. BO Y 4: There were sentries on every bridge at home, with bayonets fixed. My uncIe saw the Russians come through. -How did he know they were Russian? -Easy, Wes. They had beards, and snow on their boots. I say, Waterhouse has joined up. Waterhouse? Yes, sir. But he onIy Ieft Iast term.  How Iong do you think it wiII Iast? Why, Forrester, you thinking of joining the army? -I wiII as soon as they'II have me. -It'II aII be over Iong before they do that. -But I'm 1 6 and a bit, sir. -I know, Forrester. But I'm afraid you won't have a chance. It can't Iast. Stands to reason. It's a question of weeks. Sorry to disappoint you, Forrester. Tonight adds to the roII of honor. . . . . .the names of 1 1 boys and one master of BrookfieId SchooI. . . . . .who have given their Iives for their country. John Forrester of the NorthumberIand FusiIiers. KiIIed whiIe counterattacking the enemy in the saIient at Ypres. He Ieft here to join the army at the age of 1 7 years and 6 months. He was moved up into the Iine on his second day in France. . . . . .and two days Iater was kiIIed in action. FORRESTER: But I'm 1 6 and a bit, sir. CHIPPING: I know, Forrester. But I'm afraid you won 't have a chance. RALSTON: Richard KingsIey of the Warwickshire Regiment. FeII Ieading a bombing raid upon the enemy trenches. KingsIey was captain of the schooI in 1 909 and entered Sandhurst. -CoIIey. -I wanted to see you. I'm off to France on Friday. RALSTON: Martin Rutherford and John Passmore were friends. They came here together in the same term. . . . . .they joined the fIying corps together. . . . . .and died upon the same day. . . . . .covering the infantry attack upon DeIviIIe Wood. So you see, HeIen's going to be rather IoneIy whiIe I'm out there. I say, this is an awfuI thing to ask you. Go on. Go on, CoIIey, pIease. WeII, she's going to Iive at Charborough. The kid's nearIy a year oId now. I'm just wondering whether you'd run over and see her once in a whiIe? It's not far. I'd feeI terribIy happy if there were someone she couId see. Of course, CoIIey. Of course. Oh, it's awfuIIy good of you, sir. The address is here. You're doing me a great honor. Here's an oId friend of yours, Chips. You don't remember me, Mr. Chipping, sir? Why, bIess my souI, if it isn't the town cheese. Perkins is my batman. We're off to France. ReaIIy? You're not fighting each other this time? It's a great bit of Iuck for me, sir, being with Mr. CoIIey. WeII, goodbye to you both. God bIess you. Don't worry about, you know. -I'II keep an eye on them both for you. -Thank you, sir. Goodbye. My goodness, sir, you are Iate. There's two gentIemen waiting for you, and they're in a dreadfuI hurry. We're going to give you a shock, Chips, so you'd better hang on to your chair. We're going to be in a bad hoIe next term. And you know haIf the masters have joined up. . . . . .and the substitutes are a dreadfuI Iot. I know. I know it's difficuIt, yes. And now the head wants to go himseIf. If you feeI equaI to it, wiII you come back? -Me? -Yes. No man Iiving knows the schooI as you do. Our governors want you to be headmaster. . . . . .and to hoId the fort untiI the war is over. The headmastership? WiII you, Chips? Yes. Yes, I'II come. You were right, my dear. I am headmaster after aII.  I congratuIate you. Smart parade and a fine-Iooking Iot of boys. Thank you, generaI. Very important, this OTC work. These Iads are the officers of tomorrow. I prefer to hope, generaI, that tomorrow never comes. Burton, I understand you've been impertinent and disobedient to Mr. Smith. I've written the Iines. I've done the punishment. Providing you do the punishment. . . . . .you think yourseIf entitIed to pIay stupid practicaI jokes, is that it? Sit down. I want to know why you do this kind of thing. I do it because the whoIe crowd of masters here are weak-kneed women. They're not in the army because they're not fit to be, or too oId. They get it back on us by being tyrants. Before you go on with your interesting speech, get over that chair. Get over that chair. Get up. Sit down. You'II find the armchair the most convenient now. It didn't amuse me to do that, Burton. Very soon now, you'II be an officer in France. You'II need discipIine from your men. And to get that, you must know what discipIine means. Now, you despise the masters here. . . . . .because they're not young enough or strong enough to fight. . . . . .you might Iike to know that every one has done his best to join. We take no man unIess he has done that. I'm headmaster now because every man fit to be headmaster's fighting in France. I'm a wartime fIuke. A temporary officer risen from the ranks. But I'm going to keep BrookfieId together untiI the war is over. -You understand? -I didn't know that, sir, about the masters. I'm sorry. If I thought you hadn't any good in you, I shouIdn't have toId you. Now, are you gonna stand in and do your share? -Of course I am, sir. -That's right.   Look, there it is. There. -Look, over there. -It's a cIoud. -SearchIight's got it. -The guns, they must have spied it. Here, out of this, you kids. Down to Iower schooI.  Put those bIinds down. Get to your pIaces. Put them down. Um, at this particuIar moment. . . . . .in the worId's history. . . . . .it may seem to you that. . . . . .the affairs of JuIius Caesar. . . . . .in GauI 2000 years ago. . . . . .are of somewhat-- Somewhat secondary importance.  But beIieve me, you can't judge the importance of things. . . . . .by the noise they make.  Is there anyone who wouId Iike to voIunteer to construe? -Maynard? -Yes, sir. Turn to page 40 and begin at the bottom Iine, wiII you?   This was the kind of fighting. . .  . . .in which the Germans busied themseIves. You see? These dead Ianguages do come to Iife sometimes, don't they? They were going at it, hammer and tongs. Game as a pair of fighting cocks. One of young CoIIey's eyes was cIosing. ""Keep your guard up,"" I said. -Yes, I can hear you. -Oh, dear. No, thank you. I aIways eat too much when I come here, you know. WeII, young CoIIey, that's a fine mess you've made. This feIIow must come to BrookfieId, HeIen. Of course. The CoIIeys have gone to BrookfieId since Queen Anne died. Here, IittIe pig. You precious IittIe pig. -Peter aIways asks after you in his Ietter. -We're even then. His Ietters to me are fuII of you. WeII, I must be off if I'm to catch that bus. -Oh, I'm afraid so. I'II get your coat. -Thank you. WeII, goodbye, young feIIow. Goodbye. And don't choke yourseIf. Bye-bye. Aren't the coIors marveIous this autumn? I Iike to think he'II be back before the Ieaves faII. There's every hope, HeIen. Hope of peace. Beats me how any fight couId Iast so Iong with a CoIIey in it. Think of Iiving without fear again. Without trembIing at the sight of a Ietter or teIegram. I know. I try to imagine him about the pIace again. . . . . .doing some commonpIace thing. Working in the garden, perhaps, or washing the dog. I can't imagine I shaII ever get used to the joy of it. SureIy, we shaII never again take our happiness for granted. Goodbye. There's no one I'm so happy to see as you. Goodbye, HeIen. Next time I come, I'II expect to find the three of you. There's that bus. Goodbye. Hi there. Hi. From every point comes news of hope. We can say at Iast without fear that the end is in sight. But even in victory, we have crueI news to bear. . . . . .Iosses that are the more tragic. . . . . .because peace is so cIose at hand. Peter CoIIey. . . . . .Iieutenant in the CoIdstream Guards. . . . . .was kiIIed in action during a trench raid on the night of November the 6th. He remained in fuII view of the enemy in order to rescue his batman. . . . . .who had faIIen fataIIy wounded. Both men died before they couId be brought in. It is a great honor to BrookfieId that His Majesty the king. . . . . .has posthumousIy awarded Lt. CoIIey the Distinguished Service Order. None of you here wiII remember Max StaefeI. He was German master at BrookfieId from 1 890 untiI 1 902. He was very popuIar here, made many friends. . . . . .among whom I was proud to incIude myseIf. I received a Ietter from SwitzerIand this morning. . . . . .informing me that he had faIIen advancing with the Saxon Regiment. . . . . .on the 1 8th of October Iast. The Saxon Regiment? Does he mean that he was fighting for the Germans? Must have been. Funny reading his name out with the others. After aII, he was an enemy. One of Chips' ideas, I suppose. He's got Iots of funny ideas Iike that. Yes, sir. He shouId be just coming out of schooI now. I expect him at any moment. HoId the Iine, sir. Here is Mr. Chipping. From London, sir. CoI. Morgan. Yes? Oh, heIIo, Morgan. Yes. Oh. Yes. Yes, of course. It was good of you to caII me. Thank you. Goodbye. MAN: Pardon me, sir. Anything wrong? Ask Mr. MeIford to be good enough to assembIe the whoIe schooI in Big HaII. Boys, the war is over.  There isn't any answer. Knock again. -What shaII I say? -Say, "" Here I am, Mr. Chips. "" Here I am, Mr. Chips. What on earth? I can see you're there. What is aII this? They toId me you wanted to see me, sir. Oh, so they toId you, did they? That's quite right. I did want to see you. Come aIong inside and have some tea. Come aIong. I've warmed the pot. -WouId you fetch me the kettIe? -Yes, sir. Thank you. So you're a new boy? Yes, sir. -Name? -CoIIey, sir. Young Peter CoIIey? Why-- Why, yes, sir. I knew your father. Yes, sir, my father was here, and my grandfather. Yes, of course. Uh, one. Two. And one for the pot, eh? AII right. Pour away. Steady, steady. Don't drown it. -Draw up that chair, wiII you? -Yes, sir. -Two Iumps? -PIease, sir. Sit down. Here you are. Have a piece of cake. Thank you, sir. There we are. Now. . . . . .what do you think of BrookfieId? Oh, it's big, sir. You'II Iike it, though, when you get used to it. It's not haIf such an awfuI pIace as it seems the first day. -A bit afraid of it, I expect? -A bit, sir. So was I to begin with. But that's quite a whiIe ago. Sixty-three years, to be exact.

Well, she's not coming back, ever, so get used to it. Boy: Mom. You smell like piss. I didn't ask for you. But since you're here, I'm going to make the most of it. You will have one job. You do what I say. You clean up my house. Garbage bags, mops, bucket, broom-- they are your tools. Breakfast. You will serve me breakfast every morning for the rest of your life. You will not eat or drink anything without my permission. You only eat after I have eaten, and only what I have left on my plate. - (button clicks) - (buzzer) You hear that? That means that I'm bringing one back. You have 10 seconds to open these locks. Every night I bring home a newspaper. After I finish reading it, I want you to try and find stories about missing people. You cut them out nice and neat... The licenses. ...and you put them in the scrapbook. Cash. See? There is no phone in this house. The TV is off limits unless I offer it. If someone knocks at the-- well, no one's gonna knock. If you steal from me, you get a beating. If you try and escape or you don't keep the house clean, you get a beating. If you make me nervous or get in my way at all, a beating. From now on, this is your world. It is only you, me, and them. I will call you Rabbit. On page 12, there is a nice piece about you and your mother missing. Put it in the scrapbook. You going somewhere, Rabbit? You get an A for effort. I know every move that you make. Help! Everything you do I let you do! Go ahead, let it out. Help! - Somebody! - Let it out. - Help! - That's it. - Let it go. Let it go. - Help, somebody! - Come on. - Help! Dad! You are so fucking predictable. Somebody! And a fucking embarrassment. Help! Come on. Come on, Rabbit. Hey, Rabbit, what are you gonna do with that? Don't be a quitter. Rabbit, you have to follow through. Following through is the key to life. Come on down. I'll tell you what-- you come down and I will give you a running start. Go ahead. Come on. Come on, kid! Come on, kid. That's it. That's it. Go. Come on, give it all you've got. Come on, let it go, kid. Let it go, kid. Come on. You're a paper doll. Women love flowers. Reporter on TV: ...aren't releasing any information until they complete their investigation. A government bill that cracked down on laboratory experiments on animals is expected to become law today. Animal rights activists have been pushing for the bill for nine years and have taken part in mass demonstrations throughout the nation. Thanks. 2314 Grafton. I'm... real sorry, Dad. - Dad-- - Not a fucking word. I've known you all your life... and you're nothing special. You're nothing special. Did your dad toss a ball around with you in the backyard? You know, after school, like-- or Sundays? I mean, did he do things with you, teach you things? Or was he just fucked? Do you want to learn things? To really learn? Because it's important as hell to know shit. Otherwise, people will-- they will walk all over you. I got things that you should learn. Okay. You are not going to be ignorant. You're going to study and you're going to learn. - About what? - People-- what makes them tick, what makes them work, what's in the gut and the head. Why? Because without education, you're fucked. I mean, you've seen some things. I've showed you some things for sure, but you haven't understood them. You ever do a puzzle? You know, the kind of puzzle that has the picture on the outside of the box? That's what people are-- pictures on the outside, pieces inside. This book is about the human puzzle. You study this, you learn it, and you know how to take people apart, put them back together, understand them. Oh. So study it and-- just study. You don't want to be shackled to this house for the rest of your life, do you? - No. - Good. There's hope for you yet. So, study hard, and then maybe you and I can work out a deal. A deal for what? Some freedom. You know, get off the chain, get out of the house, get a girl. You're older now. I think that... you should have a taste of a woman real soon. I won't take the puzzles apart. I won't kill them. I give you a gift of knowledge and you fuck it away! You are looking to be shackled to this fucking wall for the rest of your life, mister. I wasn't gonna show you this, but now that you're being a shit... That's your dad. He remarried. Dad. He's got a new wife, a new life. You see this, kid? That is not someone that misses you. You got me and no one else. Here, have a beer. No, thank you. - Can I still study the books? - Yeah, have at it. That's good. - Give me an answer. - I-- I'm not sure. That's not the answer I'm looking for, not by a long shot. But I'm not sure. If we gotta stay here all night, then that's what we'll do-- we'll stay here all night. Bob: All right, give me your best guess. - It could be... - Yes? ...small-cell carcinoma? Yes. Nice. Good. That's good. No! No! - (thuds) - (man yells) How do I get out of here? Which way? Which way is out? I'll take you with me. I don't want your fucking blanket! Please! I just wanna go home. How the fuck do I get out of-- Go. That's it. Come on. That's what you want in a girl-- some fight. There's no sport in easy. - You thinking stupid thoughts? - No. No, I'm not thinking, just listening. Good. Listening is good. Come on. She was quite a ride, too. She sure could run. Hey, let's play. Come on. Come on, one round. Come on. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Ellen Rand. 22 years old. Her birthday: February the 19th.

She put 126. I don't know about weight. Well, you will. You'd better go in. Well, there they are now. Your mother's been worried sick about you boys. - Man: School good today, Bobby? - Yeah. Lying sack of shit! You think you're better than I am just because I got laid off? Aren't you, Bobby? Big man making money. You're such a big man now. Let's see you in action. Get your fuckin' clothes off, Bobby, now! Man: Take him, Joanne. Put him inside you. Let him show you how big he is. It's okay. You're a fucking whore, Joanne. It's okay. Get off me. Honey. Hi. Hi. I'm Mary. Mary. I need to pee. Which way is the powder room? Which way? I gotta go. Please? I gotta go. Show her where the powder room is, Rabbit. Show me. Oh. Not that powder room. The other one. - Oh! - (chains rattling) Ooh, kinky. You're gonna tie me up? You guys. That's not cool. Gotta be... I guess you could smoke. I'd rather you didn't. You'd rather I didn't? Okay, well, I have to pee. So if you're gonna hold out on the powder room, I'm gonna smoke. - That's what I'm gonna do. - (lighter clicking) Remember I saw you dancing? - Yeah. - Remember? I love dancing. But you didn't dance. - It's-- - (girl laughs) It's okay. Everything is-- it's gonna be okay. I think I'm too drunk. I'm drunk. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't be silly. Everything will be okay, right? Well, say it. Say, ""It's okay."" - It's okay. - Now come here. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Carotid artery. - Yes, carotid artery. Mary. No! Bob: I got something for you. This is a school yearbook. You see? It has... Tell me when you see something you like. Pick it up. I don't want it. Pick it up. Where do you think that you are right now on the food chain, Rabbit? I won't do it. No kid of mine is gonna grow up uselessly educated. I'm not your kid. The fuck you're not. Pick it up. Look around. What do you see? Do you see anything that says that you aren't my kid? That we aren't family? Do you see? Now pick it up. Pick it up. Yeah. Good. I don't wanna hear a sound out of you the rest of the night. I don't wanna know that you exist. - Thank you. - (door closes) Bob: We made the news again. They don't know anything, the cops. We are a mystery. No evidence. In one ear and out the window. It is a good day to be me, Rabbit. I'm done with this scrapbook. Good. Right. It's full. Well, I will get you another one. It's good to keep a record. Why do you do what you do? What the fuck? I asked why you do what you do. - Why do you do what you do? - You make me. Well, that is a good answer. Then I guess they make me do what I do. Who does? Them... under the dirt, in the book. Them. They never asked to be murdered. Oh, you are growing a pair all of a sudden. And they did. - They asked. - When? The day that they were fuckin' born. I don't understand. Oh, you fuckin'... You are f-- are you trying to make me fucking insane? Do I have to spell it out for you? They are all fucking whores! They are all fucking sluts! They seemed like nice people to me. (mocks) ""They seemed like nice people to me."" Oh, you are-- oh, you gotta get laid. You are getting fucked up in the head. Gotta get your taste of a woman for sure. Nothing like the taste of a woman to make you clear. Did you find one yet? We'll see. Somewhere... Somewhere in here there is a Mrs. Right. Somewhere in here. Find her. Come on. Pick one. Don't be shy. Don't be shy. Come on. Find one. Find one. Look. That's it. Where, oh, where could she be? Pick one! Come on. I think that's a good choice. Oh, yes. - (banging continues) - (Bob humming) She's ready. Come on. Rabbit. You're scared. That's okay. Everyone's scared the first time. Yeah. Bob: You said to me that you didn't want to be chained to the wall your whole life, didn't you? Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. That's it. Come on. Yeah. Come on. That's it. There's only one real way out for you to prove to me that I can trust you. And there's only-- there's only one way to do that. Yeah. Let's go. You gotta prove it to me. You gotta prove it. Come on. Come on. - Okay. - (muffled whimpering) Be quiet. Quiet to keep the mood. - Quiet. - (whimpering stops) - Yes? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Come on. Bob: It's his first time... so he's a little shy. Yeah. You remember what we talked about? If you can't do it, I will. And you know how that will turn out. So you keep your head straight. Have some fun. I'm Angie. I'm 18. What's your name? I'm Rabbit. Are you gonna hurt me, Rabbit? I don't want to. But he's expecting you to. But you have a knife. Can't we-- can't we just get out of here? We can't get out. How long have you been here? Since I was nine. I'm sorry, Rabbit. He hurts you, doesn't he? When he feels like he should, yes. If you-- if you wanna have sex, I'll have sex with you. I'll do any-- anything you want. I don't want anything. This isn't about sex. Then-- then what is it about? I guess it is about sex if sex involves killing. Oh, shit. But I haven't done either. Have you ever touched a girl? You can touch me, Rabbit. You can touch me however you want. I can show you-- I can show you how my body works. I already know how your body works. You can have me. We will do whatever you want. Am I hurting you? Are you okay? Shh, shh. Shh. - Look at me. Look at me. - Shh. Shh, shh. Rabbit. - Rabbit! - Please. Rabbit! Go away! I want to hunt. God damn. Look who's all grown up. Look at you. Turn around. Good. What do you think? - About what? - The chair. - Mine? - Graduation present. - It's good. - Good. Front passenger side of the vehicle. Mom's voice: Hey, hon. It's us. We are in a cab and we're on our way home. Love you. Young Rabbit's voice: Leave her alone! No! - Mom! - Mom's voice: No! Stay in the car! Bob: Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Um, so you have to tuck down until we get into town. There we go. That's good. Bob: I feel energized. At night is the best time to hunt. My vision is clear. I'm good being here with you now. This is good. You're a good kid. The first thing that you have to be clear about is your type. If you're into prostitution, maybe get a few of them under your belt, and then move onto something else. If you come across one like that-- look at her, all buttoned up like she's never sucked on a cock before. Well, you can bet that she has. No. Okay. Rabbit: Where next? Going to a college campus. Girls your age. - Like Angie? - Yes, like Angie. l-l don't know. Maybe this is too much too soon. We'll go back home. We could watch the movie of your first time. You made a movie of me and Angie? Yes, I did. I haven't watched it yet. That-- that's my private thing. I-- I don't want you to see what I did. I told you, I will watch it, and you will watch it with me. It's important. You won't like it. I-- I don't do it-- I'm not good at it like you are. You'll be mad. You can't do it wrong, Rabbit. I'll drive by the college campus, then we'll go home. Bob: Get down. Okay. Bob: What did you do? No, nothing. I did everything you wanted. - Shut up! - (punches) Have some fun. - Am I hurting you? - If you can't do it, I will. Go away! - Angie. No, shh! - (gasping) - (whimpering) - Shh, shh. Okay, okay. Shh. Shh. I know-- I know I hurt you real bad, but you just gotta stay quiet, okay? You stabbed me. I know. I had to or he would have. I tried to miss the vital organs. I think I did okay. How do you know? Look at me. Look at me. I told you. I told you. I know how your body works. I've been studying. You'll be okay. You'll be okay for about two days, and then you're gonna get really sick. Two days? - (cries out) - Shh! Shh. Okay, shh. I have to hide you. I have to-- I have to make him think that you're dead. Oh, God. No. Okay, you have to trust me. Okay? You have to trust me. Okay? Go limp. Just go limp. And don't you make any noise. Don't make any noise. Dead girls don't make any noise. I've seen a lot of dead girls. Take this. It's sharp. Please. Please. You need to fix this, Rabbit. I'm really disappointed. You need to make it right. And don't further insult me by pretending like you don't hear me! You fuck her? Probably not. I mean, you could have at least fucked her. You didn't have to lie to me. I would have done the rest. I gotta do it now anyway. I don't like that you fuckin' lied to me! Angie! Angie. I got a surprising little secret. How are you doing, young lady? Angie! - Angie! - How're you doing, Ange? Rabbit: Angie! Don't hurt her! Bob: Angie! Ah, fuck! Rabbit: Angie! Angie. Angie! Come here, you fucking whore! Rabbit: No! - Get off of me! - What did you do?! Fuck. I knew that you were thinking it. Shut up. Rabbit, you can't do this. Rabbit. Marie, the dog should be out back. What you selling? You don't recognize me? No, I don't. Should I? I always wanted a puppy. Yeah, well, I'm about ready to give you ours. - Come on, Marie. - You said we couldn't afford it. I said what? - Tim? - I'm so sorry. - Tim, is that you? - Tim? Your son Tim? My, God, Tim, you're alive. Take the puppy out back. Go on. Take the puppy. Go, go, go. Come in, then. Come in. Marie: Come in, hon. Please, come. Come in, son. Come in. How-- how did you find me? Where have you been? Where have you been, Tim? He-- he killed Mom. I'm so sorry. You're safe now, honey. I just wanna know why, Dad. - You gave this to your brother. - Oh, no. Honey, he doesn't have a brother. You're confused. He doesn't-- you-- you don't have a brother. - No, I don't have a brother. - Like old hand-me-down clothes, you just-- you just gave us away. Tim, I don't know what you're talking about. You told me to look after Mom. I was just a kid and I couldn't save her, and you knew I couldn't save her. - You knew. - Boy: Mom, Dad, is everything all right? I have a brother. Hey, Marie, take Colin upstairs. Tim and I need to have a little talk. Go on. Go up the stairs. In one ear and out the window. Get up the stairs, Marie. Now! Get up the fucking stairs! I found your letter. I know where you came from and I know everything. Robert Fittler, your older brother-- you paid him to make us go away. And I'm gonna tell. You're gonna tell on me? Hmm? Go on, get out of here. You should never have come to my house. Go on. I don't even wanna look at you. Brad, Brad! - Please! Please! - Rabbit: I'm gonna tell. - Goddamn, disgusting piece of shit. - Marie: Stop! No more! Stop! Marie: Okay, okay. Okay, baby. Baby, baby. - (panting) - Quiet. It's-- it's-- it's okay. It's o-- ah! - (muffled screaming) - Be quiet. - Don't hurt her! - (gasps) Okay, okay. Colin: Mom? Mom? Stay in your room, Colin! You need to go. Go now, okay? Go. Go! Go! Go! Colin: Mom, what's happening? - Mom? - Don't you dare come down here. Stay in your room, Colin. Some man broke into my house.

The next. How am I to bear it when you are gone? I am going only half a mile, Emma. But great is the difference between a Mrs. Weston half a mile away and a Miss Taylor in the house. Dear Emma. You have been a friend and companion such as few possess. A governess in office, but... ...little short of a mother in affection. I wish you every happiness on your wedding day. Poor Miss Taylor! It's a pity Mr. Weston ever thought of her. Papa, Mr. Weston is such a good-humored, pleasant, excellent man. He thoroughly deserves a good wife. And you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us forever when she might have had - a house of her own. - ""A house of her own."" Where is the advantage of a house of her own? This is... three times as large. It's entirely unnecessary. Poor Miss Taylor. Poor Isabella. My sister married seven years ago, Papa. You must be reconciled to it by now. That was a terrible day. It shall always be a matter of great joy to me that I made the match myself. Everyone said Mr. Weston would never marry again, but I did not believe it. Emma, you should not make matches or foretell things. Whatever you say always comes to pass. You must not make any more. I promise to make none for myself, Papa. But I must indeed for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world. And after such success, you know. Miss Bates. Mrs. Bates. Miss Gilbert. Mrs. Cox. Mr. Woodhouse, sir. Miss Woodhouse. - Mr. Cole, Mrs. Cole. - Good morning. M-Miss Woodhou... M-Miss Woodhouse. Morning. Is this not the most happy... happy, the-the most fortunate? This morning, I could not get my bonnet on for trembling. Hmm. Surrounded by blessings. Wanting for nothing. I am trembling again. It is too joyful! What is it, Emma? I have a fancy that Mr. Weston's son - may surprise us. - Frank Weston? He's Frank Churchill now, Papa. He's his uncle's heir. When he came of age, he took his uncle's name. I so long to meet him. But how do you know he might surprise us? It is his father's wedding day. Mr. Weston speaks of him so highly. I cannot doubt that he will come. Poor Miss Taylor. Dearly beloved friends, we gather here in the sight of God to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, an honorable estate instituted by God in this time of... of man's great inno-cence. ""Inno-cence""? Innocence. No? Well... Mmm. Mother, you must eat. It is impolite not to eat. I was just telling Mrs.... You know what I'm about to say, sir. ""Why do you keep a carriage if you never put it out?"" It's just such a shame to see it standing by. A gentleman on foot-- - it's unusual. - Unusual. Good evening, Mrs. Reynolds. At last. Mr. Knightley. You must have had a shocking walk. Not at all, sir. It's a beautiful evening. You must have found it very damp and dirty. Dirty, sir? Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them. How do you do? I came to wish you joy. Joy? Oh, the wedding. What a terrible day. So, how did you all behave? Who cried the most? We all behaved charmingly. Everybody was in their best looks. Not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Bring the screen a little closer. Mr. Knightley feels a chill. And what of Mr. Frank Churchill? Is he every bit as handsome as his father promised he would be? He did not come? You see, he wished exceedingly to come, but his aunt and uncle could not spare him. Well, I dare say he might have come if he could. I do not know why you should say so. If Frank Churchill had wanted to attend his father's wedding, he would have contrived it. He... he chose not to come. You've never met Mr. Frank Churchill. We do not know what he is able or unable to do. There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do if he chooses, and that is his duty. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his father. He also has a duty to his aunt, who is unwell. Mrs. Churchill has been unwell for as long as she could say so. Her nephew is not a doctor. If he had told her simply and resolutely that he... ...that he must attend his father's wedding, there would have been no opposition to his going. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You've always been your own master. You've no idea what it is to have tempers to manage. I shall remember that next time you quarrel with me. There is a new parlor boarder, Papa, at Mrs. Goddard's school. - Miss Smith. - There. Distinctly. Do you feel it? A chill draft. A chill and sickly draft. She's a natural child. Nobody knows her parentage, not even Miss Smith herself. Is that not mysterious? Miss Taylor would have felt it. The misfortune of your birth, Harriet, ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter. You must support your claim to that station by everything within your power. Know you the Martins, Miss Woodhouse, of Abbey Mill Farm? I know that they are tenant farmers. They rent their farm from Mr. Knightley. They were ever so kind to me this summer. Thank you. When I went away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose. The finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen, she said. The Martins are of precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower might interest me. If they were very poor, I might hope to be useful to them in some way, but... a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore as much above my notice as he is below it. Mr. Robert Martin went three miles one day to bring me walnuts because he knew how fond I was of them. I believe he's very clever. He understands everything. Come. After tea, we shall call on my dear Mrs. Weston. We promised we should be seeing one another every day. It was a beautiful service, Mr. Elton. I'm not the first to visit you this morning. You are no less welcome for being the second. Mr. Elton, Miss Harriet Smith. It is my great honor. Harriet, you must sit over there so that you may admire the view of Enscombe. Mr. Frank Churchill is the artist. I have heard it described as one of the finest houses in Yorkshire. I have heard the same. And Mr. Churchill is to inherit the entire estate. He is very fortunate. There is such symmetry between us. We both lost our mothers when we were very young. And he has his aunt to care for, as I have Papa. But how can we admire a painted beauty with such... loveliness before us in the flesh? Mr. Elton is such a good-humored man. So cheerful and obliging. And gentle. I think very well of Mr. Elton. I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be going to be married. So charming as you are. I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Fortune I do not want. Employment I do not want. Consequence I do not want. I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield. You must come again tomorrow. Thank you, Miss Woodhouse. Thank you. I like to rise when the sun she rises   Early in the morning  I like to hear them small birds singing   Merrily upon their laylum  And hurrah for the life of a country boy  And to ramble in the new-mown hay.  Miss Woodhouse, which do you prefer? They are practically identical. Of course, if the dark gets dirty, it would not show. - But the light... - The dark, then. The light is a good deal prettier. Miss Woodhouse, what's the matter? Miss Woodhouse. Miss Woodhouse. How do you do? And you, Miss Smith. I saw you through the window. I saw you through the window. Miss Woodhouse, I bring happy news. We have had a letter this very morning from my niece, Jane Fairfax. I hope that she is well. In normal course, she writes on a Tuesday, but today was... Oh, her health. Oh, Miss Woodhouse, you are so very kind to inquire. Poor Jane. She was at Weymouth with Colonel Campbell and, uh... Oh, where is the letter? Oh. Oh, it must not be far off. Oh, such an unexpected... Oh, it's on the glove stand. It was with the gloves. It was with the gloves. Yes, at Weymouth with Colonel Campbell and his wife and Jane's dear friend, Miss Campbell, who is recently married. She's Mrs. Dixon now. And, oh, dear, Mr. Dixon, who is the most charming young man, rendered to Jane a great service in recent days. They were... Oh, too pretty. That is... Yes, they were out in a part... oh, in a party on the water, and Jane, by the sudden whirling around of something or other in the sails, would have been dashed to the sea at once... ...and actually all but gone. But Mr. Dixon, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit and saved her life. Oh, to think that poor Jane may have perished. I cannot think of it without shaking, she an orphan. I am very pleased that Miss Fairfax was not harmed. How gratified Jane will be to know that she has such dear, devoted friends. Heaven forbid that I should ever bore anybody half as much about all the Knightleys together as Miss Bates does about Jane Fairfax. One is sick of the very name ""Jane Fairfax."" Every letter from her is read 40 times over. And if she does but knit a pair of garters, one hears of nothing else for a whole month. It is Robert Martin. Good boy. - Miss Smith. - Mr. Martin. - Lovely to see you, Miss Smith. - Goodbye. Only think of our happening to meet him. Well, Miss Woodhouse? Is he like what you expected? What do you think of him? I had no right to expect much, and indeed, I did not expect much, but I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer... gentility. To be sure... he's not so genteel as to a real gentleman. Mm-hmm. I do hope Mr. Woodhouse is not ill. Oh, no. Oh, Papa sees Mr. Perry every day. I know I disappoint him awfully. I'm so seldom indisposed. If he does not invent an illness for me, I hardly figure in his letters. Truly... you are the very picture of good health, Miss Woodhouse. Mrs. Martin thinks you the most handsome woman in all of Highbury. You must never flatter me in front of Mr. Knightley, Harriet. He thinks me vain enough already. I do not think you personally vain. Considering how very handsome you are, you seem little occupied with it. Your vanity lies a different way. Did I tell you what Mr. Elton said of you the other day? He called you... ...""loveliness itself."" It-it seems to me his manners are rather softer than they used to be, and I rather wonder whether he means to ingratiate himself with you. Morning, Mrs. Goddard. - Good morning, Mr. Elton. - Girls. Quickly now. These are exquisitely done, Miss Woodhouse. You have a charming talent. I dare say there is merit in them, in the least finished perhaps the most. So Mr. Knightley tells me, and he finds fault in everything I do. Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet? Oh... no. What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be. It would indeed. It would indeed. Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse. Now, at once. You have given Miss Smith... all that she requires. She was a beautiful creature when she came to you, but the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from... nature. It's depressing for me - to have to take care of it, you know? - No. - Well, quite. - Take over. Mr. Woodhouse, your daughter's gifts are without compare. Bear witness. Mm. You've made her too tall, Emma. Uh, no. No, certainly not too tall. Not in the least too tall. Mm, mm, yes. It is very... pretty. When it is finished, you must have it framed. Allow me. Trust me with this commission, Miss Woodhouse, and I will ride to London the moment I am asked. It would be my great honor. I cannot have a moment's doubt. It is exactly as I planned. He's in love with you. I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston, of this great... intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing. How differently we feel. Miss Smith knows nothing about herself and looks upon Emma as knowing everything. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. But educating Harriet will be an inducement for Emma to educate herself. They will read together. Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was 12 years old. She never would submit to anything requiring industry and patience. I cannot allow you to be a judge in this matter, Mr. Knightley. You are so used to live alone, you do not know the value of a companion. Well, she always declares that she will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all. I should like to see Emma in love and in some doubt of a return. It would do her good.  How firm a foundation   Ye saints of the Lord...  Robert! Master Knightley is here. Your faith in his excellent word  The day is wasting, Mr. Martin. Come along. What more can he say than to you he hath said   You who unto Jesus   For refuge have fled?  I'm really most obliged to you, sir. I'd expected to wait until the spring. Always buy out of season, Mr. Martin, whenever you can. Mr. Knightley, sir, forgive my liberty, but may I be so bold as to seek your advice? Of course. Miss Woodhouse! You will never guess what has happened. Robert Martin has offered me his hand. He writes as if he really loves me very much. Is it a good letter? Or too short? It is a very good letter. So good I think one of his sisters must have helped him. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me. Oh, no, no, no. The words must be your own. You think I ought to refuse him. I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. Perhaps... it is safer. Do you think I had better say no? Not for the world would I advise you either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. I have now... quite determined... ...and really almost made up my mind... ...to... refuse Mr. Martin. Refused? Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? I... I hope you are mistaken. I saw her answer. Nothing could be clearer. You saw her answer? You wrote her answer. This is your doing. Emma, you persuaded her to refuse him. Well, if I did, I should not feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin's a respectable young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal. No, indeed, he is her superior in both sense and situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connection higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter - of nobody knows whom. - There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman, and a gentleman of fortune! Probably no settled provision at all, and certainly - no respectable relations! - Her allowance is very liberal. Nothing has been grudged for her improvement. She is known only as a parlor boarder at a common school. She is pretty, and she is good-tempered, - and that is all. - That is all? These are not trivial recommendations, Mr. Knightley. Till men do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl with such loveliness as Harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after wherever she goes. I am very much mistaken if your sex, in general, would not find these qualities the highest claims a woman could possess. Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so, too. Better to be without sense altogether than to misapply it as you do. Men of sense do not want silly wives. And more prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace that they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe and respectable forever. But if you teach her to expect to marry greatly, nobody within her reach will ever be good enough for her. Your plans for Harriet are best known only to yourself. But as you make no secret of your love of matchmaking, it is fair to suppose the plans you have. And as a friend... I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man that I think, it will be your labor in vain. He knows that he is a very handsome young man and-and a great favorite wherever he goes, but from his general way of talking when there are only men present, I'm convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away. I'm very much obliged to you for opening my eyes, Mr. Knightley, but know that I am done with matchmaking for the present. I only want to keep Harriet for myself. It's so beautiful! You certainly spared no expense. Hark, hark, what news the angels bring  -  Glad tidings of  -  Glad tidings of...  ...me to do all - the disciplinary action to the children. - You must... - It is utterly unfair. - You, it is your responsibility and your responsibility to teach the baby to drink milk... It is not only my responsiility. ...without spilling it all over my favorite trousers. That is the nurse's responsibility, not... Emma, they're here. That was unendurable. Husband, comport yourself. - Papa. - Isabella. Emma. I shall always be sorry you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here. But why should you be sorry, sir? It did us a great deal of good. On the contrary, Mr. John Knightley looks far from well. Southend was strenuously recommended by our physician, sir. Sea air and sea bathing. The sea is rarely of use to anybody. It nearly killed me once. Come. I must beg you not to speak of the sea. Makes me miserable. And envious-- I who have never seen it. Mr. Wingfield specified that Southend was the best place to go for the family. Perhaps you should change your physician. He was recommended by my husband. Cornwall might have been forgivable, but Southend? Let us be friends. Aw. Tell your aunt, little Emma, that she was very wrong and she ought to set you a better example. - Oh. - Wh... - What is the matter? Is there fever? - Uh... Uh... Where is the nurse? Give her to me. - Is she feverish? - I do not know. I-I do not know. Wh-Where is the nurse?! - Send for Perry. - Do not send for Perry. Send for Perry! As death follows life... Mm. Yes. As... far as good intentions went, um... ...we were both in the right. I must admit, I have not yet been proved wrong. Mr. Knightley. Was Mr. Martin very disappointed? A man cannot be more so. Miss Woodhouse is coming. Miss Woodhouse. Harriet! Miss Woodhouse! You're so, uh... disheveled. I'm always ill at Christmas. Get back in bed at once. You'll miss the party at Randalls. Mr. Elton will be there. And Frank Churchill is expected at last. And Mr. Elton's sermon. A sermon on Christmas Day. I transcribe them every Sunday. I will transcribe it for you. You are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse. Welcome! Welcome, my friends! Welcome! Mr. Elton. How's poor Miss Smith? Oh, no better, I'm afraid. Aw, such a sad loss to our party today. Miss Smith has sent her apologies. She will be missed every moment. Ooh. How are the children? Multiplying. My only moment's rest is in the office. Frank has been detained at Enscombe, I'm sorry to say. Oh. I had a letter from him just this morning. Mr. Churchill is to inherit the entire estate. I have heard it described as one of the finest houses in Yorkshire. Going out in dismal weather to return probably in worse. Four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle... Another fine, flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods? Your feelings are singular. His letters seem to satisfy everybody else. I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. Were she a person of consequence herself, he would have come by now, I daresay. You seem determined to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits - as any other man, but... - I hear of none except that he is well grown and good-looking. Well, if he has nothing else to recommend him, he shall be a treasure at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men. Cannot ask for all the virtues into the bargain. You will excuse my being so much overpowered. We are both prejudiced. You against, I for him. And we shall have no chance of agreeing until he is really here. Prejudiced? I'm not prejudiced. Yes, but I am. Very much, and without at all being ashamed of it. My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favor. Charming Miss Woodhouse. Mr. Weston. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe. Ev-Everything... gives way to her. She has decreed that if Frank does not marry a lady of some fortune, then he will be entirely cut out from her will. There is jealousy. She is jealous even of his regard for his father. Jealousy... But she is so very fond of her nephew. - He is her particular favorite. - Dear Emma. Do not attempt, with your good nature, to understand a bad one. You must let it go its own way. Uh, I have heard it described as one of the finest houses in Yorksh... Mm. What seasonable weather we're having. I dare say we shall have snow tonight. Snow? Tonight? When did it commence? We shall call for the carriage right away. It has hardly begun-- barely an inch-- but it is falling fast. It was snowing when your mother died. Oh, Papa, I know. We shall get you home. Well, what is to be done? Emma! There is room for us all. We have accommodation for all of you. Absolutely. The horses are in good condition. I do admire your resolution, sir, venturing out in such weather... There's nothing we can do. It is snowing. - Mrs. Weston, the party. - We should go at once. Wh-Where is the carriage? Where is James? Of course, fortunately, we do have more than one carriage, so if one is blown over in the wind... - Husband, please. - Happy Christmas. I am so very sorry. - We must leave. - I think we shall be very glad that-that Frank did not come at Christmas. Look to your vinaigrette, Papa. Mr. Knightley, you must move your carriage. - My father is not well. - Take it. It is first and will be the fastest. You will catch your death. Your husband is not... is not strong. I'll ride with you, then. Evidently, I may not survive. Oh. Miss Woodhouse. Mr. Elton! I must avail myself of this precious opportunity to declare sentiments which must be - already well known. - Mr. Elton, please. - You've drunk too much wine. - My ardent attachment. Mr. Elton! You forget yourself. I am ready to die if you refuse me. You take me for my friend. Any message you have to Miss Smith, I shall be happy to deliver. For Miss Smith? A message for Miss Smith? I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence. Never paid her any attentions but as your friend. Never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend. Oh, Miss Woodhouse. Who can think of Miss Smith when Miss Woodhouse is near? Everything I have said or done for many weeks has been with the sole view of making my adoration to yourself. Charming Miss Woodhouse... ...allow me to interpret this... ...interesting silence. It confesses you have long understood me. No, sir. It confesses no such thing. Nothing could be farther from my wishes. Your pursuit of Harriet has given me great pleasure, and I've been very earnestly wishing your success. Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl... ...and no doubt there are men who might not object. Everybody has their level. Madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only, and the encouragement I received... Encouragement? I give you encouragement? You are entirely mistaken, sir. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present. - Driver, stop the carriage. - Mr. Elton, please... Driver, stop the carriage!  The water is wide   I cannot get o'er   And neither have I   Wings to fly   Give me a boat   That will carry two   And both shall row   My love and I   Oh, down in the meadows   The other day   A-gathering flowers   Both fine and gay   A-gathering flowers   Both red and blue   I little thought   What love can do.  Miss Woodhouse. Miss Woodhouse. He never loved me. He loves you. He sought to aggrandize and enrich himself. Yes. Harriet. You might never have thought of him but for me. I assured you of his attachments. I contrived his visits to Hartfield. I do not blame you, Miss Woodhouse. I could never have deserved him. And none but so partial and kind a friend as you could even have thought it possible. It's silly, really. Harriet. I cannot see it without thinking of him. Burn the frame if you like, but you must keep the likeness. Then I will take it. I will take it, and I will treasure it as a picture of my friend. Goodbye, Papa. Now, are we going to be quiet this carriage ride? Sit next to your sister. Why are you so pale? Where is the baby? Where is the baby? Where is the baby?! Henry needs his mor-mor. We must retrieve Henry's mor-mor. I will not stop this carriage for a mor-mor. Goodbye, Isabella. Goodbye. Papa. I wish she would not leave. You must never leave me, Emma. Oh, Papa. You know I never could. He cannot stay away forever. The curate cannot give the sermon forever. No one preaches as Mr. Elton does. Hear this extract, Miss Woodhouse. Hear this. Enough about Mr. Elton. Miss Woodhouse. Miss Smith. Such news. My niece, Jane Fairfax... Miss Woodhouse, Jane Fairfax, she has... Jane has surprised us. She is here. Oh, do come along. We must have tea. It is too thrilling. She caught a bad cold. Poor thing. So long ago as the seventh of November. She has not been well since. And her kind friends, the Campbells, thought she'd better come home and try an air that always agrees with her. I hope that your father is well. Very well. I thank you. She is very sorry to be parted from her dear friends, the Campbells. And Mrs. Dixon. And, oh, Mr. Dixon, the most amiable young man who did her so great a service at Weymouth in October. I still shudder to think what might have... if not for Mr. Dixon, with the waves and the water and the sails. Oh. Such a charming man. Oh, dear. Is this not pleasant? She plans to stay three months. We must have you all to Hartfield. Oh. Oh, Mother, do you hear? Miss Woodhouse has invited us to Hartfield! Mother! You must sample the tart. No, I do... I do... I do not advise the custard. What do you say to half a glass of wine? In a tumbler of water, naturally. We shall be seeing Frank any day now. I have... I have no doubt of it. Oh, now, Jane, Mr. Frank Churchill is a man much talked about in Highbury. Is he not, Miss Woodhouse? We are all very eager to meet him. He was at Weymouth when Jane was there. We are very little acquainted. Frank Churchill was at Weymouth? In October? That was the month of his father's wedding. But you must describe him. Is he handsome? Is he agreeable? I believe he is generally thought so. How well prepared this custard is. I must ask your cook for the method. 'Tis the last rose of summer   Left blooming alone   All her lovely companions   Are faded and gone   No flower of her kindred   No rosebud is nigh   To reflect back her blushes   And give sigh for sigh   Oh, who would inhabit   This bleak world alone?  Miss Fairfax. Oh, what a pity you did not bring your music. I hope I can recollect the tune. Nobody in the world plays like you. I'm glad you invited Miss Fairfax to play. Having no instrument at her grandmother's, it must be a real indulgence. I am glad you approve. But I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to my guests at Hartfield. No. You are not often deficient. You make it very plain you do not like Miss Fairfax. Everybody supposes we must be so fond of each other because we are the same age. Ever since I can remember, I have been told I can find no better companion than Jane Fairfax. She who is so accomplished and so superior. She is certainly accomplished. Perhaps the accomplished young woman you wish to be thought yourself. Three months of doing more than I wish and less than I ought. That indifferent, imperturbable statue. I must go. Harriet. Oh. We have missed you. Our mother's been asking for you. Will you come and visit us again? Of course. Good day, Miss Martin. Miss Catherine Martin. Mr. Martin. Miss Smith! Th... The near way is flooded. You would do better going by Mr. Cole's stables. The ground is higher there. You behaved extremely well. And it is over. As a first meeting, it cannot occur again. You must stay no longer than a quarter of an hour. And allow no dangerous reminiscences. There must be no recurrence to the past. I seek the village of Highbury, sir. Over the bridge, left at The Crown. You'll see the steeple. Thank you. Very much obliged. Here we are. - My dear. - Mrs. Weston. My son, Mr. Frank Churchill. - Miss Emma Woodhouse. - Miss Woodhouse. He, uh... he's caught us quite by surprise. Indeed he has. There are not many houses in which I would presume on so far, sir, but... in coming home, I felt I might take the liberty. We, uh... we had a plan to walk to the village, Emma. Will you join us? I would be delighted. Splendid. Right. I believe we have a mutual acquaintance in Jane Fairfax. Did you meet often at Weymouth? Pray, let us go in here. That I may prove myself to be a true citizen of Highbury, I must buy something at Ford's. And I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me. I merely asked whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth. And now that I understand the question, I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one. Well, it is always the lady's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance. You answer as discreetly as she would herself. Though her account leaves so much to be guessed that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her. I only know what is generally known. That she is poor and of no consequence. Here's where you have your balls, I suppose. Every fortnight through the winter. I am afraid Highbury may yet disappoint you, Mr. Churchill. We have not society enough for dancing. Ah, but an inn of this size must have a ballroom, and where there is a ballroom, there can be a ball. We cannot do without dancing. Instances have been known of young people passing many, many months successfully without any ball of any description and no injury either to body or to mind, but when... when the felicities of rapid motion have been felt... ...it must be a very heavy heart that does not ask for more. It is very dirty inside. Oh, my dear, my dear, you are too particular. By candlelight, it'll be as clean as Randalls. We must have a ball. Yes, and when we do, may I hope for the honor of your hand for the first two dances? The Coles are to hold a supper party in Frank's honor, and perhaps there'll be dancing there. So, Emma Woodhouse deigned to accept an invitation from the merchant Mr. Cole. Mr. Churchill will soon return to Yorkshire. We must make the most of every opportunity until he does. ""We must."" He's in Highbury only two weeks. And yet he spent a whole day going to London just to get his hair cut. 16 miles, twice over. He's a trifling, silly fop. Indeed. Mr. Cole. Such grand estates you have in common, gentlemen. Donwell Abbey. Enscombe, soon to inherit, of course. Soon to inherit Enscombe. Not too soon. I trust your uncle Churchill is in good health? Uh, excellent health. And have you heard the choicest piece of gossip that has set all the tongues of the village aflame? A pianoforte, very elegant, delivered to Miss Fairfax this very morning with no return address. I never saw so fine an instrument. A pianoforte, very elegant, and with no return address. No return address. Jane herself is quite at a loss. Quite bewildered to think who could have sent it. Bewildered, indeed. Why do you smile? Nay, why do you? I suppose I smile for pleasure. A pianoforte is a very handsome present. I rather wonder it was never made before. Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before. Or that Colonel Campbell did not give her use of his own instrument, which must now be shut up in London untouched by anybody. She has done her hair in so odd a way. I never saw anything like it. Must be a fancy of her own. I see nobody else looking like her. If Colonel Campbell is not the giver, who can be? Mrs. Dixon? As a token of her... her friendship, perhaps? What say you to Mr. Dixon? Mr. Dixon? He saved her life. Did you hear of it? A water party, and by some accident, she was falling overboard. He caught her. Huh. Ladies and gentlemen, a duet. What do you say to this, Emma? I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax. Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax? This pianoforte's been sent to her by somebody. And she has always been a favorite with him. Tonight, he sent his carriage for her as a courtesy and walked himself. Was that not gallant? Mr. Weston. Drink to me only with thine eyes   And I will pledge with mine  Or leave a kiss within the cup   And I'll not ask for wine  The thirst that from the soul doth rise   Doth ask a drink divine  But might I of love's nectar sip  I would not change for thine.  ""Enter not into judgment ""with thy servant, O Lord, ""for in thy sight... ...shall no man living be justified."" He's married. It cannot be a long acquaintance. He's only been gone six weeks. My wife, Mrs. Augusta Elton. This house is very like my brother Mr. Suckling's seat at Maple Grove. Very like. I'm quite struck by the likeness. Is it not astonishingly like, dear husband? Very like. I really could almost fancy myself at Maple Grove. The staircase as I came in-- I observed how very like the staircase is. Placed in exactly the same part of the house. I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove. A most impressive residence. Whenever you are transplanted like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with anything at all that reminds one of what one has left behind. We have been calling at Randalls. What pleasant people the Westons seem to be. And who should call in while we were there? Knightley. Knightley himself. Of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E's, I had a great curiosity to meet him. ""My friend Knightley"" had been so often mentioned that I really was impatient to see him. And I must do my cara sposo the justice to say that he need not be at all ashamed of his friend. ""Knightley."" I could not have believed it. ""Knightley."" Never met him before in her life and calls him ""Knightley."" And to discover that he is a gentleman. Upstart, vulgar being, with her ""Mr. E"" and her cara sposo. Emma. - Mr. Weston. - Miss Smith. The Churchills have settled at Richmond. Here. Frank is returning. We shall have our ball. No. No. - You are Frank Churchill. - Oh. Of course. You dance so beautifully. Oh. Oh, this is brilliant, indeed. This is admirable. Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Oh! Miss Woodhouse. You must really have had Aladdin's lamp. This is meeting quite in fairyland. Such a transformation. Now, where shall we sit? Where shall we sit? Oh, now, anywhere where Jane is not in a draft. How do you like my gown? - Oh! - Oh, Mr. Elton! I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed. I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed. Quite a horror of finery. Of course, I must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected. A bride, you know, must appear like a bride. But my natural taste is all for simplicity. How do you like Jane's hair? She did it all herself. Too wonderful. No hairdresser from London, I think, could do a finer style. Emma, it has just occurred to us that Mrs. Elton will expect to be asked to begin the ball. And she will surely think Frank ought to ask her. Frank cannot break his promise to you. He's promised you the first two dances. Here's the plan. I will ask Mrs. Elton. The ball is in Frank's honor, but it's in my design. I shall ask her. You must submit to stand second. A bride must be first in company. It is almost enough to make me think of marrying. Oh. Must I go first? I really am ashamed to always be leading the way. Gentlemen. You have been much missed in Highbury. Have I? How is your aunt? Most reluctant to release me. Do you not dance, Mr. Elton? Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me. - Oh. - Ah. Well, perhaps... There is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing-- Miss Smith. Miss Smith. If I were not an old married man. But my dancing days are over. Mrs. Weston, you will excuse me. Will you dance, Miss Smith? Thank you. For your kindness to Harriet. He was unpardonably rude. And he aimed at wounding more than Harriet. I was completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is a littleness about him which you discovered and I did not. You would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself. Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities which Mrs. Elton is totally without. She does you credit, Emma, as you do her. Ah. Oh, Miss Woodhouse. Come. Set your companions an example. They're all lazy. They're all asleep! We must dance another set. I am ready whenever I am wanted. With whom will you dance? With you. If you will ask me. You have shown that you can dance, and we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it improper. No, indeed. Stop it. Stop embarrassing yourself. I am not embarrassing myself! Oh! Mr. Churchill. Harriet. - Oh! - What has happened? She was set upon by some gypsies as she was coming home. When she attempted escape, she fell. She had a cramp. - From too much dancing! - Well, is she hurt? I didn't see. I arrived moments after... ...and brought her here. I could think of no other place. To the drawing room. It was on account of the scissors! The scissors? - Oh! - I... ...borrowed a pair of scissors from Miss Bates. I was halfway home when I made the recollection and so doubled back. Whew. What is your purpose here? Um, my-my... carriage... My... Uh, my horse threw a shoe. You took your carriage to the ball? Yes. What might have become of me, Miss Woodhouse, if not for the scissors? We must send for Perry. Miss Woodhouse. I believe I am in love again. Mrs. Goddard should be assured of her safety. Yes, and I shall rouse my father. We ought to let them know that there are gypsies in the neighborhood. Yes, let us go at once. - Oh, Miss Woodhouse. - Say nothing more. Do not go! Mr. Churchill. Please. Stay. What is the matter? What has happened? What... Is she... is she... is she alive? Harriet is unharmed, Papa. We have Mr. Churchill to thank. Please stay. Mr. Knightley can sound the alarm. We will both go. Why are we alarmed? We have sent for Perry, Papa. He's your superior, no doubt, but... but wonderful things have taken place. There have been matches of greater disparity. Believe me, I have not the presumption to suppose. No, but the service he rendered you. Service? The very recollection of it, and all that I felt. His coming to me, his noble look. Such a change in one moment from misery to... ...to perfect happiness. I was very wrong before. I will be cautious now. I am determined against any interference. What is this I hear, dear Jane, about your going to the post office in the rain last week? Why, you sad girl. Why would you do such a thing? I will not allow you to do such a thing again. I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters-- one of our men, I forget his name-- shall inquire for yours, too. Do you suppose Mr. Knightley might extend us all an invitation to the abbey, Miss Woodhouse? I love to explore great houses, and I fear I have long exhausted Highbury. I'm afraid Mr. Knightley's concerns are all for his tenants and none for his house, Mrs. Elton. His ballrooms and picture galleries are quite shut up. I should be very glad to open Donwell for your exploration, Mrs. Elton. - The welcome is long overdue. - Mm. I should like that of all things. Name your day, and I will come. I cannot name a day until I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to form the party. Oh, leave that to me. It is my party. I will invite your guests. I hope you will bring Elton, but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations. Oh. Oh, well, now you are looking very sly. But consider, you need not be afraid of delegating power to me. Married women, you know, may be safely authorized. There is but one married woman in all the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell. Mrs. Weston, I suppose? No. Mrs. Knightley. Until she is in being, I will manage such matters myself. Oh, my heavens. Do you not feel transported? I can hardly believe that we remain in England. And I was to accompany him, but the night before his going, I was struck down by a fever, and so I did not go. Please excuse me. Of course. There is an excellent prospect from the south window, Miss Smith. May I escort you? Jane of course knows a great deal more of the world than I. She has been to Ireland. Will you... be so kind when I am missed to say that I am gone home? If you wish it. But you're not going to walk back to Highbury alone. - Are you unwell? - Miss Woodhouse... We all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are exhausted. Have I missed the party? Not at all. We're exploring the house. I was detained by my aunt. A nervous seizure which lasted some hours. Had I known how hot a ride I should have, I believe I should not have come at all. You will soon be cooler if you sit down. Some cold beer, perhaps. As soon as my aunt gets well again, I shall go abroad. I'm tired of doing nothing. I want a change. I'm serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy. I'm sick of England. You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay? You are quite mistaken. I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. We're going to Box Hill tomorrow. It is not the grand tour, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of change. Well, if you wish me to stay and join the party, I will. How much I am obliged to you for telling me to come today. I had quite determined to go away again. Yes, you were very cross. Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to rouse them? Hmm? Any nonsense will serve. Ladies and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say that she desires to know what you're all thinking of. Dear. What we are thinking of? Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to know what we are all thinking of? No, no. Upon no account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now. It is the sort of thing which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into, as... chaperon of the party. Very true, my love. Very true. But some ladies will say anything. Best to pass it off as a joke. Everybody knows what is due to you. They are most of them affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing what you may be thinking of and only requires something entertaining from each of you. She demands either one thing very clever or two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed. And she engages to laugh heartily at them all. Oh. V-Very well, then. I need not be uneasy. ""Three things very dull indeed."" That will do just for me. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as I open my mouth. Ah, ma'am, but there is the difficulty. When have you ever stopped at three? Oh. No. I see what she-she means. I shall try to hold my tongue. I-I like this plan. Uh, agreed, agreed, agreed, agreed. Uh, I shall do my best. Um... I'm making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon? Low, I am afraid, sir, but we shall, uh, be indulgent... Mr. Knightley, I must have made myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend. I cannot think what I have done. What two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection? What two letters... ...express perfection? I... I'm sure I do not know. Well, I shall tell you. ""M"" and ""A."" ""Emma."" - Do you understand? - Yes. Mr. Weston has shown us how to play this game but also how to end it, for who can improve upon perfection? I protest, I must be excused. I do not pretend to be a wit. I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Shall we walk, Augusta? Most willingly. I am very tired of exploring so long on one spot. Shall we join Mrs. Elton, ma'am? If you please, my dear. With all my heart, I am quite ready. How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? It was not so very bad. How could you be so insolent to a woman of her character and-and-and age and-and situation? I dare say she did not understand me. I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it since. I know there is not a better creature in the world... I wish you could have heard how she talked of it-- w-with what candor and-and generosity. You must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her. They are blended in her, I acknowledge. And were she a woman of fortune, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner, but she is poor. She has sunk from the comfort she was born to, and if she lived to an old age, she will probably sink more. - It is too hot, and... - She has seen you grow up - from when her notice of you was an honor. - And I am tired! To have you now, in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment, laugh at her and-and humble her, and before her niece and before others, many of whom are entirely guided by your treatment of her! It was badly done, indeed! Go! I have been unpardonably vain... ...and insufferably arrogant. I have been inconsiderate... ...and indelicate and irrational and unfeeling and... I'm afraid Jane is not very well. Dreadful headache. Writing all morning. Such long letters. I said, ""My dear, you shall blind yourself."" I'm so very sorry, Miss Bates. Please give Jane my good wishes. You were kept waiting at the door. I was quite ashamed. No, you... you see, there was a little bustle, for it so happened we did not hear the knock, and until you were on the stairs, we did not know that anybody was coming. So very kind. But you are always kind, Miss Woodhouse. Ah, Emma. How did you find them? Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley. She is always so attentive to them. I... I regret I cannot stay, sir. We will miss you in the evening. Goodbye, Emma. What has happened? Mrs. Churchill is dead. Dead? Yes, we-we always thought her illness was invented, but... Emma. Frank was here this very morning on the most extraordinary errand. It is impossible to express our surprise. Frank and Jane Fairfax are engaged. What? There's been a solemn engagement between them ever since October. Formed at Weymouth and kept a secret from everybody. What? Um... Engaged? Before either of them came to Highbury? Secretly engaged. Of course, had his aunt heard of it, she would have cut him off, but... It has hurt me, Emma, very much. It has hurt his father equally. He sent the pianoforte. He has confessed it. Emma, you must know it was our darling wish. Oh, no, no. Not for me. I'm so very sorry, Harriet. But why should you condole me? You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill? There was a time, and not very distant, either, when you gave me reason to believe - that you did care about him. - Him? Never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me? Harriet, wh-what do you mean? I should not have thought it possible that you could have misunderstood me. But you told me that greater things had happened. That there had been matches of greater disparity. Those were your very words, Miss Woodhouse. Harriet. Let us understand each other now without possibility of further mistake. Are you speaking of Mr. Knightley? Of course. - But... - I thought you knew. But the service Mr. Churchill rendered you i-in protecting you from the gypsies. Oh, no. It was not the gypsies. No. I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance. Of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance. When Mr. Elton would not stand up with me. Good God. And have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection? I must say that I have. He has shown me sweetness and kindness. And at Donwell, he took great pains to describe to me some particulars of the management of his tenant farms. We were interrupted, but before we were... ...he seemed almost to be asking me if my affections were engaged. Yes, but is it possible that he might have been alluding to Mr. Martin? That he might have had Mr. Martin's interest in view? You think of Mr. Knightley for yourself. Harriet. I-I do not flatter myself with any idea of his attachment to me. Harriet. I should have considered it too great a presumption even to think of him but for you. Harriet. I know that he is the last man who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling more for her than he does, so... if you believe... ...he loves you... I refused Mr. Martin because of you. Because... Harriet. Emma! Mr. Knightley. Have you heard the news? Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill. I did not see it. But then I seem to have been doomed to blindness. Time, my dearest Emma... time will heal the wound. He will soon be gone. You will forget him. You are very kind, but you are mistaken. My blindness to what was going on led me to act in a way that I must always be ashamed of, but I have no other regret. With respect to... Mr. Churchill. He is a disgrace to the name of man. And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman? Jane, Jane... you'll be a miserable creature. Everything turns out for his good. His-his aunt is in the way, his aunt dies. He uses everybody ill, and-and-and they're delighted to forgive him. He is a fortunate man, indeed. You speak as if you envied him. And I do envy him. Emma. In one respect, he is the object of my envy. You will not ask me why. You are... you-you are... you are determined, I see, to have no curiosity. You are wise. But I cannot be wise. I must tell you, Emma, what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment. Oh, then do not speak it. If you wish to speak to me... as a friend or to ask my opinion... as a friend, I will hear whatever you like. ""As a friend."" Emma, that, I fear, is a word... Tell me, Emma. Have I no chance of ever succeeding? My dearest Emma, for dearest you will always be, my dearest, most beloved Emma, tell me at once. I cannot make speeches. If I... If I... if I loved you less, then I might be able to talk about it more, but y-y-you-you... you know what I am. I have... I have lectured you, and I've... I've blamed you, and... and you have borne it as no other woman in England could have borne it. God knows I have been a very indifferent lover. But you understand me. You-you understand my feelings. Will you marry me? Oh. Emma. Oh. Emma. - Oh. - Emma. Oh. - Emma. - Uh, no, I... - Emma. - Oh. No, I... I... I-I cannot. Why not? Harriet! - Harriet? Wh... - She's in love with you! And she believes that you may love her, too. And... and you danced with her! - Oh. Oh. - And shown her kindness and took notice of her at Donwell and spoke of farming and... And seemed on the verge of asking if her affections were engaged! To Robert Martin! To Robert Martin! She told you this? I cannot break her heart again. I shall... I shall call on Robert Martin this very evening. I shall urge him to put his suit to Miss Smith a second time. He still loves her. I'm certain that he does. He need only ask again. Not-not by letter, but in person. No. No, I must do it. I must go. Mr. Martin... ...I have a confession to make. I have caused you great suffering. As I have also caused the suffering of my friend. My dearest friend.  How firm a foundation   Ye saints of the Lord   Is laid for your faith   In his excellent word   What more can he say   Than to you he hath said   You who unto Jesus   For refuge have fled?  Harriet. Mr. Robert Martin has offered me his hand. I have accepted. Then he is the most fortunate man of my acquaintance. Harriet, I... There is something else. I have had a letter from my father. Now that I have come of age, he has revealed himself. He is a tradesman. In Bristol. He makes galoshes. He comes to Highbury next week on purpose to meet with me. Then I hope you will bring him to Hartfield.  As I was a-walkin'   One midsummer's morning  I heard the birds whistle and the nightingales play   And there did I spy   A beautiful maiden  As I was a-walkin' all on the highway  Oh, where are you going, my fair pretty lady?   Oh, where are you going   So early this morn?  She said, ""I'm going down to visit my neighbors  I'm going down to Warwick, the place I was born""  It's ""May I come with you, my sweet pretty darling?   May I go along   In your sweet company?""  Then she turned her head and smiling all at me   Saying, ""You may come with me   Kind sir, if you please.""  Do you... Do you feel a draft, Mr. Knightley? About the knees. I-I cannot say that I do, sir. Ah. Pity. In fact... Yes. - A chill draft. - Chill. The screen. Bartholomew! Charles, make haste. No, not that... This one. No, not that one. This one. How could I ever leave him? He can remove with you to Donwell. You know he never would. He could not stand it. Then I shall come here. You would quit the abbey? Yes. Sacrifice your independence? Yeah. And live constantly with my father in no house of your own? Yeah. Uh, h-how is it now, Mr. Knightley? It's much better now. Dearly beloved friends, we gather here in the sight of God to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, an honorable estate instituted by God in the time of man's great innocence.

You're sick. I'm going to the races! All right. You want something hot in the fifth race? Sanitarium? Bus to the sanitarium. Standish Sanitarium. Free bus to the sanitarium. It's no use, Tony. If business keeps up like this, I'm afraid I'll have to drive the car myself. Oh, no, Miss Judy. You can't fire me. - But what if I can't pay your salary? - That's different. You don't have to pay me, but you can't fire me. - Tony, you're sweet. - Yeah. And don't worry, Miss Judy... ...I'm gonna get us some customers if I have to make them sick myself. Tony, I'm afraid we need more than customers. You don't understand. I owe a great deal of money. Far more than I can ever pay. Let me see. Who do I know that's rich? How about that big, strong, sick woman at the sanitarium? - You mean Mrs. Upjohn? - That's the one. She'd lend you the money. Oh, she's rich. Why, last week, she gave me a dollar tip. She did once offer to help. But it doesn't seem right to borrow from a patient. - Then we make her a partner. - Oh, Tony. We gotta hurry before she changes her mind. Go ahead, Miss Judy. There's Mrs. Upjohn now. - But, Mrs. Upjohn... - There's no use, doctor. I'm leaving! Mr. Whitmore, I want my bill at once. - Just as you say. - What's the matter, Mrs. Upjohn? It's no fault of yours, my dear. It's the doctor. Telling me I'm perfectly well when I know I'm on the verge... ...of a nervous collapse. Goodbye, Judy, dear. Have the boy come up and get my bags, please. Gil! Oh, Gil! - I'm glad you're here. - What is it, honey? Hold me tight. I'll be all right. Come on, honey, tell me. It's Mrs. Upjohn. She's leaving. Oh, let her leave. Say, I have something here worth 100 Upjohns. You don't understand. I'm going to lose this place. No, you're not. That's what I'm trying to tell you. From me to you, with love. Your radio contract. You've got it! ""Gelding, out of Honey Lamb by Blue Bolt... ...two-year, Hi Hat."" - Why, Gil, this doesn't make sense. - It's a horse, honey, a racehorse. Perhaps I'm awfully stupid, but what do we want with a horse? I'll tell you. Horse wins race, owner wins money. Owner gives money to girl he loves. Girl saves sanitarium. It's very simple. Very simple? But what happens if horse loses race? Oh, but he can't lose. He's a wonder. I picked him up for a song, only $ 1500. Fifteen hundred dollars? That's all the money you had in the world. Well, I still have my job singing at the casino. Now, Gil. You return that horse at once and get your money back. You've got to go on with your music. You need money fast, more than I could make 10 years of singing. I don't care. I want you to be a great singer, not a racetrack tout. Oh, wait a minute. That isn't fair! - Are you going to return that horse? - I can't. I just bought him. You mean you don't want to. You'd rather bet on a horse than on yourself. - Of all the ungrateful people! - What have I got to be grateful for? You've thrown your career away on a long shot and gambled away our happiness. Here. Take your horse. And I hope you're very happy with it. I'm going to someone who understands me, to Dr. Hackenbush. Dr. Hackenbush? Why, I never heard of him. Has he a sanitarium? The biggest in Florida, that's what he said. Of course, I was never there. Hugo, I mean, Dr. Hackenbush, always insisted on treating me in my home. I didn't know there was a thing the matter with me until I met him. Excuse, please. We're getting a lot of customers since they heard Dr. ""Hackenapuss"" is coming. - Did you say Hackenbush? - Yes, ma'am. I wonder if that could be the same one. Where does he come from? - Where's your Hackenapuss come from? - Palmville, Florida. That's the one! Why... Why, Judy! Why didn't you tell me Dr. Hackenbush was coming here? Dr. Hackenbush? Oh, I'm so excited! Judy, why don't you make him chief of staff. He'd do wonders for the sanitarium. With Dr. Hackenbush in charge, I might help you financially. I don't say I will, but I might. Oh, Mr. Whitmore, have my bags sent right up. I'm staying! - Who's Dr. Hackenbush? - I don't know. But if she wants a Hackenapuss, she's going to get a Hackenapuss. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. - Here's a telegram for you, doc. - What does it say? Well, goes on to say... How should I know? ""Come up and take care of Mrs. Upjohn. Stop. You can write your own ticket. Stop. Come at once, Standish Sanitarium."" Mrs. Upjohn. Ah, Emily. She never forgot that hayride. Don't she know you're a vet? She's so in love with me, she doesn't know anything. That's why she's in love with me. They could throw a horse doctor in jail for treating people. They can throw a horse doctor in jail for not paying his rent too. - Up in there. - What have I got to lo...? Take one of those every half-mile. And call me if there's any change. Mr. Morgan, if I sign this, it means I turn the sanitarium over to you today. That's right, and I'll give you $5000. But the notes aren't due. I've got almost a month. This place has been losing money steadily. You'll never be able to pay. If you wait, I'll take it over, and you won't get a cent. As your business manager, Judy, I strongly advise you to take Mr. Morgan's offer. You're forgetting that doctor Mrs. Upjohn recommended. Surely with him in charge, we'll be able to pay Mr. Morgan. Are you going to take the advice of a hysterical patient? - Now, look here, Miss Standish... - Judy! - Judy, he's here! He's here! - Why, who's here? Dr. Hackenbush! Are you going to sign that or not? - No. - Of course she's not going to sign it. I have a month. I can at least try this new doctor. You're going to wish you'd taken that check. Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan! - You fixed that, all right. - How'd I know she was going to butt in? - I'll get to work on this new doctor. - Work fast. With Dr. Hackenbush in charge, I'm sure my trustees will let me help you. - I think I'm better able to advise... - I don't want to hear any more about it. I can't stand this excitement. I know this will cause a relapse. Oh, my metabolism! Doctor! Oh, doctor! Here, boy. Here, boy. Take these bags to my room, and here's a dime for yourself. Oh, no, no, no, no. This is Mr. Whitmore, our business manager. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Here's a quarter. You mustn't take the doctor too seriously. He probably feels tired after his long trip. Why shouldn't I be tired? Did you ever ride four on a motorcycle? And me, top man. This is Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush, your new chief of staff. And now, doctor, I'd like you to meet Miss Standish. Oh, doctor. Doctor. Just a moment, while I calm these paralytics. Oh, dear. Doctor. Doctor, this is Miss Standish, owner of the sanitarium. - How do you do, Miss Standish? - How do you do? You're the prettiest owner of a sanitarium I've ever seen. - Thank you. - You have a charming place here. I knew your mother very well. I'll let you in on a little secret. Many, many years ago, in the dear, dim past... ...I proposed to your mother. - But that's my father. - No wonder he turned me down. Now, doctor, I'd like you to meet your new associates. Johnson, Bellevue Hospital, 1918. Franco, Johns Hopkins, '22. - Wilmerding, Mayo brothers, '24. - Dodge brothers, late '29. Doctor, I'm happy to welcome you as chief of staff. I hope you'll be able to pull the sanitarium out of its difficulties. The sanitarium's having a little financial trouble. I get it. I'm not gonna get paid. So long! Take it away! Oh, no, no, no. Doctor, please don't go. - I'll take care of your salary. - Oh, yeah? The last job I had, I had to take it out in trade. And this is no butcher shop. Not yet anyhow. Judy, it seems to me, if I may say so... ...we are making rather a hasty decision. Surely you don't question the doctor's ability. No. Not exactly. But running a sanitarium calls for a man with peculiar talents. I've got the most peculiar talents of any doctor you ever met. I'm satisfied with Mrs. Upjohn's recommendations. If you'll excuse me, I'll go and bring in the rest of the staff. Why don't you go out and bring in something. Preferably your resignation. Tell me, Dr. Hackenbush... ...just what was your medical background? - Medically? - Yes. Well, at the age of 15, I got a job in a drugstore filling prescriptions. Don't you have to be 21 to fill prescriptions? Well, that's for grownups. I just filled them for children. No, no, doctor. I mean, where did you get your training as a physician? Oh, well, to begin with, I took four years at Vassar. - Vassar? But that's a girls' college. - I found that out the third year. I'd have been there yet, but I went out for the swimming team. The doctor seems reluctant to discuss his medical experiences. Well, medically, my experiences have been most unexciting. - Except during the flu epidemic. - And what happened? I got the flu. - Oh, doctor, I think it's time for my pill. - Ix-nay on the ill-pay. Now, you told me to take them regularly. Just a minute, Mrs. Upjohn. - That looks like a horse pill to me. - Oh, you've taken them before? - You sure you haven't made a mistake? - You have nothing to worry about. The last patient I gave one of those to won the Kentucky Derby. May I examine this, please? Do you actually give those to your patients? Isn't that awfully large for a pill? It was too small for a basketball, and I didn't know what to do with it. Say, you're awfully large for a pill yourself. Dr. Wilmerding... ...just what is your opinion? It must take a lot of water to swallow that. Nonsense. You can swallow that with 5 gallons. Isn't that a lot of water for a patient to take? Not if the patient has a bridge in her mouth. The water flows under, the patient walks over and meets the pill on the other side. So it's war! I'm off to the battlefield! No, that's from the racetrack. - Racetrack? Well, what am I doing here? - Oh, doctor, don't leave me! Well, you won it, Stuffy. Nice work, Stuffy. I told you to lose that race. Stuffy, where are you? Where's Stuffy? Did you see my jockey? Whoa. Please, Mr. Morgan, don't stay here. You ought to beat the head off that ornery devil! Well, he only acts this way when he sees or hears you. I should have plugged that nag when I owned him. Please, Mr. Morgan, don't stay here. Calm down. He's gone now. That's a boy. You better stay out of Morgan's way for a while. Get your ice cream. Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream. Stuffy! Hey, get out of there. Hey, that was some ride you put up. I had 5 bucks right on the nose. I won 60 cents. Yeah. Who you riding tomorrow? What's the matter? What happened? You're fired? Oh, Morgan fired you, huh? - He wanted you to throw the race? - He wanted Stuffy to be crooked, eh? You know he's honest. He's honest, but you gotta watch him a little. Gil, why don't you give Stuffy a job. Let him ride Hi Hat. We can't afford a jockey. We haven't enough money to eat on ourselves. Eat, eat, eat. All the time eat. We don't have to eat. I'll eat. - Hey, you. - Hello, sheriff. - Have you got the money for the feed bill? - You see... You guys have been stalling me for weeks. Either I get some money right now, or I'm taking Hi Hat. Wait, wait. I'll give you some money. There you are. Five dollars? That's not enough. Come on. Well? All right, all right. I've got some more. Just... There you are. That makes 10. Chicken feed. Come on, you've got some more. Yeah, but it's hard to get at, you know? - Come on, come on. - All right. Don't hurry. I've got it someplace. I know it's someplace. Here. I knew it was someplace. Well, that's 15. Have you got any more? - I'll let you know in a minute. - Quit stalling. Come on, hurry. All right, I've got some more, but I can't hurry. Hey, what are you doing? Cut it... Get up. What is this? Cut it... What are you trying to do? Get up. Here! Come back here! Well, that's fine. Now we owe the sheriff $ 120 and a sock. It's a good thing Judy doesn't have to depend on me. - I can't even hold on to the horse. - No? Well, we hold on to the horse. Say, if we only had some dough. I got a tip on Sun-Up. Sun-Up? He's in the next race! We don't got much time! Hey, wait! What are we gonna use for money? Hey! What are you doing, you crazy kook, you? Hey, look, look! Sun-Up, he's 10-to-1. Oh, boy, are we gonna clean up, 10-to-1. - We haven't any money to bet. - Don't worry. I get us some money. I find a sucker someplace. Scram. I think I see a sucker coming now. Get out of here. Get your ice cream. Two dollars on Sun-Up. Hey. Hey, boss. Boss, come here. You want something hot? Not now. I just had lunch. Anyhow, I don't like hot ice cream. Hey, come here. I no sell ice cream. That's fake to fool the police. I sell tips on the horses. I got something today can't lose. One dollar. No. Some other time. I'm sorry. I'm betting on Sun-Up. Some other time. - Two dollars on Sun-Up. - Hey, boss. Hey. Come here. Sun-Up is the worst horse on the track. - I notice he wins all the time. - Just because he comes in first. I don't want him any better than first. Two dollars on Sun-Up. Hey, boss, come here. Come here. Suppose you bet on Sun-Up. What you gonna get for your money? 2-to-1. One dollar, and you'll remember me all your life. That's the most nauseating proposition I ever had. Come on. Come on. You look like a sport. Come on, boss. Don't be a crunger for one buck. Thank you. - What's this? - That's the horse. How'd he get in here? Get your ice cream. Tootsie-fruitsie ice cream. ""Z-V-B-X-R-P-L."" I had that same horse when I had my eyes examined. Hey, ice cream. What about this optical illusion you slipped me? I don't understand it. That's not the real name of the horse. That's the name in code. Look in your codebook. - What do you mean, ""code""? - Look in the codebook. - That will tell you what horse you got. - I haven't got any codebook. - You don't got one? - You know where I can get one? Well, just by accident, I think I've got one right here. Here you are. - How much is it? - That's free. - Oh, thanks. - Just a $ 1 printing charge. Well, give me one without printing. I'm sick of printing. Come on. You want to win? - Yeah, sure. Of course I want to win. - Well, then you've got to have this. But I don't want the savings of a lifetime... ...wiped out in the twinkling of an eye. - Here. - Thank you very much. Ice cream... ""Z-V-B-X-R-P-L, page 34."" Hey, ice cream, I can't make head or tail out of this. That's all right. Look in the master codebook. That will tell you where to look. Master code? I haven't got any master codebook. - You don't got a master codebook? - Do you know where I can get one? Well, just by accident, I think I've got one right here. There you are. A lot of quick accidents around here for a quiet neighborhood. - Is there a printing charge on this? - No. Oh, thanks. Just a $2 delivery charge. Delivery charge? I'm standing right next to you. Well, for such a short distance, I make it $ 1. Couldn't I move over here and make it 50 cents? Yes, but I'd move over here and make it $ 1 just the same. Say, maybe I'd better open a charge account, eh? You got some references? The only one I know around here is you. That's no good. You'll have to pay cash. A little while ago, I could have put $2 on Sun-Up and avoided all this. Yeah, throw your money away. Thank you very much. - I'm all set, huh? - Yes, sir. Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream. - Master code, master code, plain code. - Get your ice cream... ...tootsie-fruitsie. Get your tootsie-fruitsie... ""Z-V-B-X-R-P-L. The letter Z stands for J unless the horse is a filly."" - Get your tootsie-fruitsie... - Hey, tootsie-fruitsie. - Is the horse a filly? - Don't know. Look in your breeder's guide. Get your ice cream... What do you mean? I haven't got any breeder's guide. You haven't got a breeder's guide? Not so loud. I don't want it to get around that I haven't got a breeder's guide. Even my best friends don't know I haven't got a breeder's guide. Well, boss, I feel pretty sorry for you, walking around without a breeder's guide. Why, you're just throwing your money away... ...buying those other books without a breeder's guide. Where can I get one? As though I didn't know. One is no good. You got to have the whole set. Get your tootsie-fruitsie... You know, all I wanted was a horse, not a public library. - What do you mean? How much is a set? - One dollar. - One dollar? - Yeah. Four for $5. Give me the four of them. There's no use throwing away money. All right, here you are. This is all I'm buying too. I didn't want so many... - I thought you could do this quickly. - There you are. Six dollars on Sun-Up. - Get your tootsie-fruitsie ice cream. - Breeder's guide. Get your ice cream. - ""Z-V-B-X-R-P-L is Burns."" - Yeah, that's right. - Burns? - Yeah. Some days it gives you the name of the jockey instead of the horse. You find out who jockey Burns is riding, and that's the horse you bet on. It's easy. Get your ice cream, tootsie-fruitsie. I'm getting the idea of it. I didn't get it for a long time. It's pretty tricky when you don't know it, isn't it? It's not that book. - It's not that book. - It's not that book? Oh, I see. No. It's not that book. Not that book. - Nope. Nope. It's not that book. - It's not? No, you haven't got that book. You've got it, huh? I'll get it in a minute, though, won't I? Get your tootsie-fruitsie. I'm getting a fine tootsie-fruitsying right here. Get your ice cream. - How much is it? - One dollar. - And it's the last book I'm buying. - Sure, you don't need no more. Here. Now, here's a... Here's a $ 10 bill. - Shoot the change, will you? - I got no change. I'll have to give you nine more books. You don't mind. - You take nine more books. - Nine more? - You don't handle any bookcases, do you? - Well, you come tomorrow again. - I didn't know that you needed... - You're gonna win today. I thought you just walk up and bet on a horse. - Open! - Am I shedding books down there? Close! Close! That's it. It's a good thing I brought my legs with me, eh? - Now, what horse have I got? - It's right here. - I just heard the fella blowing his horn. - Here it is. Jockey Burns, 152. That's Rosie. - Rosie, yeah? - Look! Oh, boy! Look, 40-to-1! - 40-to-1, huh? - Oh, what a horse! Am I gonna give that bookie a whipping! I was going to bet on Sun-Up at 10-to-1. - Look, it's 40-to-1. - I'll show them a thing or two. Hey, there, big boy. Two dollars on Rosie, eh? Sorry, that race is over. - I say the race is over. - Over? Who won? - Sun-Up. - Sun-Up! That's my horse! Sun-Up. Sun-Up. Hurry up. Sun-Up. Goodbye, boss. Goodbye. Sun-Up. Ten, 20, 30... Sun-Up! Forty, 50... Get your tootsie-fruitsie. Nice ice cream. Nice tootsie-fruitsie ice cream. - Oh, Miss Standish? - Yes? - These calls came while you were out. - Oh, thank you. Hello. - Mr. Stewart? - I'm still out. I'm sorry. Miss Standish is still out. Yes, Mr. Whitmore. What about that call to the Florida medical board? What? Well, keep on trying. Call me the moment you get it. You can't even get any action out of your telephone operator. Don't worry. I'll get the dope on that Florida quack. Now, listen, I want to turn this place into a gambling casino before the season ends. With my racetrack, my nightclub and this... ...I'll have every sucker in America here, but every day counts. - I'll let you know when I get the call. - I'll be waiting. Doctor, may I have one of your photographs? Why, I haven't one. I could let you have my footprints, but they're upstairs in my socks. I want to announce your association with the sanitarium. We'll send your picture to all the papers. - Florida papers? - Yes. It'd be wonderful publicity. Publicity? We mustn't have any of that. You know, the ethics of my profession. But we have to get new patients. Well, after all, the old patients were good enough for your father. Besides, who wants to see my picture? I'm not a famous man. I'm just a simple country doctor with horse sense. Oh, you're too modest. - We'll forget about the pictures. - That's better. And, doctor, remember, I'm counting on you. The success of the sanitarium is in your hands. Look, Miss Standish, suppose... Suppose I were to tell you... ...that I'm not the doctor you think I am. Well, you're the only one that can help me. And do be nice to Mrs. Upjohn, won't you? Well, she's not exactly my type, but for you, I'd make love to a crocodile. Silly. Have the florist send roses to Mrs. Upjohn. Write ""Emily, I love you"" on the bill. Just a moment, Dr. Hackenbush. Yes, Mr. Whitmore. No, I haven't been able to get that call through to the Florida medical board. Well, I'm doing the best I can. It ought to be here any minute. If that call's what I think, she can cancel those roses and make it lilies for me. Get me Mr. Whitmore. - Hello? - Here's your Florida call, Mr. Whitmore. All right. Hello? Florida medical board. Good morning. I'd like to talk to the man in charge of the records, please. Record department? Just a moment, sugar. Record department. Colonel Hawkins talking. Colonel Hawkins, did you get a wire from me regarding Dr. Hackenbush? I'm sorry, sir, but there's a hurricane blowing down here... ...and you'll have to talk a little louder. It certainly is the windiest day we ever did have. It certainly is windy! I want to know about Dr. Hackenbush! - Yes? - Whitmore, cut out that squawking. The patients are all complaining. And I hope, sir, that that's the information that you require. I'm sorry, colonel. I didn't hear it. I was called to the Dictograph. - What was that you said, sir? - I was called to the Dictograph! Whitmore, one more yelp out of you, and I'll have you bounced out of here. And I trust, sir, that that answers your question. I'm terribly sorry, colonel. I didn't hear you. I can't hear you. You'll have to talk a bit louder. I want to find out something about Hackenbush! - Well, what is it now? - That's the last time... ...I'm gonna warn you about that yowling. And in conclusion, let me say... I'm sorry, colonel. What was that you said about Hackenbush? Hacken... You mean, Dr. Hackenbush? Oh, no. He's not here. I know he's not there. He's here! Then what are you bothering me for, Yankee? But I want to know something about his Florida record. Here's your Florida call, Mr. Whitmore. Operator, will you get off the line?! - Hello? Hello, colonel. - Yes? Are you sure you're speaking of Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush? - Who? - Hugo Z. Hackenbush! Who's calling him? - The Standish Sanitarium. - Yeah, that's where he works. Say, I understand he's doing a mighty fine job up there. I... I want to get some information regarding his qualifications for the job. - What job? - As head of the sanitarium! - Who? - Hackenbush! - Whitmore, are you calling me? - No, you sap! - Hello. - Yes, now, what was that name? Hackenbush. Hackenbush! Well, as soon as he comes in, I'll have him get in touch with you. Hey, you see that sourpuss? That's Whitmore, the man you gotta watch. You see, he's no good. He's in with Morgan... ...and I think they're trying to get the sanitarium away from Miss Judy. Hey, hey! No, no, no. You no gonna fight him. You gonna watch him. You gotta watch him like a hawk. That's it. Not so fast. No, not so fast. First, I gotta get you in here as a patient... ...or else Whitmore's going to get wise to you. Come on, I take you to the doctor. Stuffy! Stuffy! Hey, come here. Hey, he won't hurt you. No, no, come here. This fella's a nice doctor. You're hungry, eh? You want some ice cream? You want a nice, big steak? With spinach? All right, all right. No spinach. No spinach. Apple pie? And beautiful nurses? Oh, baby, come on. You're gonna get a nurse. Oh, my, you're gonna get plenty. - Have you seen Dr. Hackenbush? - No, doctor. Go find him. Mrs. Upjohn wants him. - What's the matter with Mrs. Upjohn? - Nothing, in its most violent form. - Pick me up at 5. - Yes, sir. - May I have an okay on this, please? - I'm too busy right now. I'll put the O on now and come back later for the K. - Dr. Hackenbush. - A little later. - Get me the Turkish bath. - Yes, sir. Dr. Hackenbush, Mrs. Upjohn is complaining again... ...and these x-rays show nothing wrong with her. Is that so? Who are you gonna believe, me or those crooked x-rays? Doctor, the Turkish bath. Hello? Gus, will you look in the steam room and see if my frankfurters are done? That will be all. I have some important research. Now... Excuse me. Oh, so you're the doctor. Yeah, remember me? I used to be in the book business. Hey, forget about that, doc. - I got some good news for you. - Yeah? What are the odds? No, no, it's no horse. I got a patient for you. Oh, a patient? Oh, fine. What size? - You didn't get him here any too soon. - Hey, Stuffy! Sit down here till I snatch you from the jaws of death. - Just sit quietly. - Sit down. Either he's dead, or my watch has stopped. He's a good doctor. Knows his business. Singing doctor. Here you are. Oh, come on. This isn't gonna hurt. - Come on, everybody gets that. - Open up those pearly gates. Flip this under your flapper. Attaboy. - Didn't hurt, did it, huh? - He's pretty sick, eh, doc? Well, that temperature certainly went down fast. Hey, don't drink that poison! That's $4 an ounce. We better put him to bed. He looks awfully sick today. Better get him a nurse too. If he thinks that, he'll go to bed. - Come on. - There, now. Take it easy, will you? He's been a doctor for years, this fella. I've been a doctor longer than you've been a patient, I'll tell you that. Come on. Why do you do like that? What do you think, he's gonna play with you? No, don't look at me. Let me look at you, huh? No. Don't look at me. What do you think I am, a peepshow? Get away there, will you? It's rather a strange-looking sight. - Yeah, it's serious, huh, doc? - I haven't seen anything like this in years. The last time I saw a head like that was in a bottle of formaldehyde. - I told you he was sick. - That's all pure desiccation along there. He's got about a 15-percent metabolism with an overactive thyroid... ...and a glandular affectation of about 3 percent. - That's bad, huh? - With a 1 -percent mentality. He's what we designate as the crummy, moronic type. This is the most gruesome-looking piece of blubber I've ever peered at. Hey, doc! Hey, doc. You got the looking glass turned around. You're looking at yourself. I knew it all the time. That was a good joke on all of us, wasn't it? Let's do it again sometime, huh? Say, ""Ah."" Louder. Louder! - Hey, doc, where you going? - I'm going to the ear doctor. I'm deaf. Come on back. It's not you. It's him. Sometimes, I'm not sure who's getting the examination here. Take it easy, now, huh? Say, am I stewed, or did a grapefruit just fly past? I don't see nothing. If that's his Adam's apple, he's got yellow fever. - He's got ingrown balloons. - He has, huh? Well, we'll soon find out. - Hold that till I get a rock. - He's got a blister on his tongue. - Is that what it is? - I think he's a Ubangi. Well, I'll get the hammer and ""Ubangi"" that right off. I had a case like that once in Dsseldorf many years ago, and... Say, it's grown considerably, hasn't it, huh? - What's that hairy fungus all over it? - Some fungus, eh, doc? Not a great deal, no. - Well... - You're making a mistake. That's his head. If that's his head, he's making a mistake, not me. I can't do anything for him. That's a case for Frank Buck. Put him in the room till Frank Buck gets here. Fine. Shall we say a 50-buck room, or would you prefer something better? - We'll take something better. - That's nice. - But we'll talk about the money tomorrow. - Oh, no. Money on the line, or out you go. ""To Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush, for saving my horse."" - Come here with that watch. - You, a horse doctor? - A little easy with that talk. - A horse doctor. - Don't mention that word around here. - Hey, that's terrible. I'm gonna tell Miss Judy quick. No. That's no good. Miss Judy, she's depending on you. A horse doctor. Now, listen, boys, I admit it. You've caught me with my coat down. - Well, it's been nice knowing you. - Oh, no, you don't. Oh, no. Let's get together. I'm open to any kind of proposition. All right, you stick on this job. You make Mrs. Upjohn happy, or we're gonna have you thrown in jail. Well, that doesn't leave me much choice, does it? Nobody must know you're a horse doctor. You make one false move, and we fix you good. I hate to admit it, but I haven't got a leg to stand on. Now, let's... Hey, wait a minute! - Bring that over here. - There it goes. - No, whip it around the other way. - You keep quiet. - We know what we're doing. - Okay. Say, I thought I wasn't gonna be able to walk again. - I got it too. - It's fine now. Stuffy, I got it. Come on. 1:44. That's bad. You think that's bad? I know something worse than that. - Did Stuffy tell you? - Tell me what? - Hackenapuss, he's a horse doctor. - What? - Sure. Here, ask Stuffy. - A horse doctor? - Does anyone else know about this? - Only Hackenapuss, and he won't talk. It's bound to get out sooner or later. There must be something we can do to help Judy. Yes. Hi Hat, you gotta win the race and make us plenty of money. Stuffy's right. Hi Hat's too hungry to run. I'm gonna get paid extra for singing at the water carnival tonight. That's fine. You sing, I sell some more books... ...and Stuffy, he's gonna put Hi Hat to bed. I've gotta go to rehearsal. See you later. - All right. Good luck. - Hey, you! Hello, sheriff. I told you not to take this horse out till I got the rest of my dough. We didn't take him out. He walked out, we followed. I warned you. Now I'm taking the nag. Hey, you can't take that horse. How will we win money to pay the feed bill? That don't mean a thing to me. I'm gonna put him where nobody will take him out. He couldn't get you, so he took six other girls. Isn't it beautiful? It's the prettiest number I've ever seen. Oh, Hugo, it's so impress... Now what? The idea! Oh, now, Judy, wait a minute. I want to talk to you. You can't depend on Hackenbush. Mrs. Upjohn is perfectly satisfied with Dr. Hackenbush, and that's what matters. In fact, she may take over the notes tomorrow. I guess everything's all right. Nothing to worry about? No, not a thing, except that horse of yours. Wait. That horse is all right. He's in the pink. Why, today he ran the mile in 1:36. That horse is going places. Oh, that's wonderful. I wish you luck. - Thanks. I'm sorry I bothered you. - It's all right. Now, Judy, I'm the biggest liar in seven states. He isn't all right, he isn't in the pink... ...and it was 1:44 instead of 1:36... ...and the only place he'll go is where the sheriff takes him. You can't possibly mean Hi Hat. Well, there's only one horse in my stable. Come on, let me have the rest of it. The only thing I'm going to say is this, Gil: Don't ever let a horse come between us again. She loves him. Everything is going to be all right now. Change your partners. - Hugo, I am surprised at you. - Oh, you didn't know I could rumba? Change your partners. How would you like me to dance away from you? I'd be satisfied if you'd dance off my feet. I'm disappointed. To think of your dancing with that strange woman. Well, don't think of it. Think of me dancing with you. I'm crazy about you. Nothing will ever come between us again. You don't know how lonely I get at night... ...in my little room at the sanitarium. Room 412. Perhaps I could come in and say good night to you. Yes. We could have a midnight snack, nice little steak between us. Why, Hugo! You'd stay up until midnight. That's how you follow doctor's orders. You know you're supposed to be in bed by 10:00. 12:00. 10:00. Listen, we mustn't have any disturbance here tonight. All right. I can wait. Well, it's in the bag. I have a date with him in his room at 12. Nice going. See that you stay there till I break in with Mrs. Upjohn. I want Hackenbush fired out of the sanitarium tonight. Don't worry. When you knock on the door... ...I'll have that moth-eaten Romeo playing the balcony scene. I got you. I got you. L... You're spoiling my game. What's the matter? What's the matter? Buffalo Bill? Buffalo Bill goes ice-skating? Oh, Hackenbush! Oh, what's the matter with him? Dr. Hackenbush. He's got a snake? No. He's got apple dumpling? Dr. Hackenbush... ...he's got apple dumpling. No apple dumpling. No, it's no apple dumpling. No. No. Oh, it's a woman! A woman. Oh, I get it. Oh, there's a woman. Yeah. Smart, eh? Dr. Hackenbush... ...there's a woman... ...she got a wooden leg? No? She got a woodpecker? She got a headache? Dr. Hackenbush... ...there's a woman... ...she knock on the door! She knock on the door! All right. All right. Dr. Hackenbush, there's a woman, she knock on the door... You're crazy! You make me sick. What's the matter now? Oh, she's going to frame him! Oh, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. - Who is it? - It's Miss Marlowe. Just a moment, fruitcake. Yes? Oh, doctor. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Do you like gardenias? - I adore them. - How did you know? - I didn't, so I got you forget-me-nots. One whiff of this, and you'll forget everything. Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - Thank you. Oh, do you mind? Not at all. I always take the wrap. You are such a charming host. The Hackenbushes, we're all like that. - How about a short beer? - Nothing, thank you. Thank you. Miss Marlowe, I've dreamed of this moment ever since I met you. For days, I've been trying to see you... ...and I still don't seem to be able to make the grade. A quiet evening alone with you. What more could anyone ask? Say, did you sneak out of here? Oh, there you are. Isn't this too, too devastating? You mind carving? I can't reach the steak from here. Me? Yes? Hey, doc. Hey, doc, can you see us? If I can't, there's something wrong with my glasses. You mean, her? She's the one? We fix her. Oh, baby, you look good to me! Oh, stop it! Wait a minute. I thought you came here to see me. Well, I can see you from here. Get up, you... You know my friend. Oh, no. Not for me, three men on a horse. What is the meaning of this? Why, you little pest. What's the matter with you mugs? Haven't you got any gallantry? She's with Whitmore. She's trying to frame you. Wouldn't mind framing her. A prettier picture I've never seen. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey, doc. Doc, I'm telling you a secret! She's out to get you! Why, I've never been so insulted in my life. Well, it's early yet. I'm leaving. I'm not going to stay here with these men. You're not leaving. They're leaving. I want you fellas to get out. - Oh, my cape! - Come back here with my woman. You fellas are busting up a beautiful romance. Get her out. She's going to make trouble. You're wrong. This is my aunt. She's come to talk over some family matters. I wish I had an aunt look like that. Well, take it up with your uncle. Hey, doc. Doc, you're playing with fire. - You didn't mind getting scorched. - I got fire insurance. Well, you better get accident. Scram. Blow. How do you like those cheap chiselers horning in on us? - Thank you. - Thank you. - How about a little Scotch? - Why, I'd love it. Oh, I'll ring for some. - Thank you. - Thank you. Will you have the bellhop hop up with some hop Scotch? I'll flip you to see who pays for it. Oh, doctor. I'm O'Reilly, the house detective. Don't talk so loud. Your mustache will drop off. Have you got a woman in here? If I haven't, I've wasted 30 minutes of valuable time. You better get her out. This is the last time I'll tell you. The last time? Can I depend on that? Yes, because this time, I'm going to stay all night. - This looks like a tough case. - So does this. I think I'll call me assistant. If you're looking for my fingerprints, you're a little early. When you're through with that steak, chew him. Pull in your ears. You're coming to a tunnel. Get along, little doggies. Get along, little doggies. It's been a nice, quiet dinner. How do you know? You haven't had any yet. Shall we? - Thank you. - Thank you. Tomato soup? Have you got a can opener? Oh, here it is. Oh, I'm really not hungry. Couldn't we just sit over here? I want to be near you. I want you to hold me. Oh, hold me closer. Closer. Closer. If I hold you any closer, I'll be in back of you. You're so comforting. The Hackenbushes, we're all like that. Shall we sit down and bat it around? You're a little near-seated... A little nearsighted, aren't you? Oh, no. There's nobody else going to get in. I bolted the door. Say, fun is fun. We come to hang the paper. How about hanging yourself instead? - Well, I'm going to stay right here. - Thank you. That's right. You work that side, I work this side, and we meet on the ceiling. You'll wind up on the gallows is my prediction. I must be a citizen. I just got my second papers. Looks like a wet track tomorrow, Stuffy. - I think Stuffy's is the one with water. - I'll see that he's dismissed immediately. What's going on? Good gracious! You're mistaken. There's no woman here. - What are they...? - No? Hugo! What are you doing? I'm having the place done over. It'll make a lovely honeymoon suite. - Good... - You better go, dear. - We're tearing up the floor next. - Oh, my. Come, Mr. Whitmore. I've a few words to say to you. Boys, you were wonderful. You saved my life. I'll get even. You... You dirty, low-down, cheap, double-crossing snake. Thank you. Hugo, speak to me. I said I was sorry about last night. I never should have mistrusted you. Isn't there anything I can do to make you forgive me? You could take over the notes from Miss Standish. Then would you forgive me? Well, it would help. Emily, I can't hide it any longer. I love you. Oh, Hugo. It's the old, old story, boy meets girl. Romeo and Juliet. Minneapolis and St. Paul. Mrs. Upjohn. Judy has the papers ready for you to sign. Later, later. Can't you see we're busy? It's all right. I'll remember where I left off. Must they do that now? Mrs. Upjohn, just a moment, please. Mrs. Upjohn, may I present Dr. Leopold X. Steinberg of Vienna? And this is Dr. Hackenbush. Doctor. I have a few questions I would like to ask you. I've got a question I'd like to ask you. Steinberg, what do you do with your old razorblades? I've been telling Dr. Steinberg about your unusual case. Yes, and I would like to know what is this ailment, double blood pressure? Dr. Hackenbush tells me I'm the only case in history. I have high blood pressure on my right side and low blood pressure on my left side. There is no such thing. She looks as healthy as any woman I've met. You don't look like you ever met a healthy woman. - What? - Gentlemen, gentlemen. There's a very simple way to settle this. Why not examine Mrs. Upjohn? - Splendid, splendid. - Right this way, Mrs. Upjohn. Dr. Hackenbush will show you, then I insist that you apologize to him. Come, Hugo. The idea! Hey, doc, where you going? If Steinberg examines her, we're through. - I'm through right now. - You're not. You gotta get in there. Do anything, but stop Steinberg. Hurry. I'll say. I'm hopping the next banana boat for Central America. Hey, doc, where you going? Wait, doc. Wait. It's all right with me. Go right ahead. I'm not sleeping here tonight. - It's Hi Hat. - Nonsense. That's a horse. No, it's Hi Hat. We hide him in the closet so the sheriff can't find him. Is that so? He's not going to find me either... ...because I'm leaving here right away, boys. Doc, doc, wait a minute, now. - No, I'll see you again sometime. - No, doc, please. See you again, just as soon as I get my effects. Old Hackenbush isn't gonna be with you very long. - Doc, you can't walk out on us like this. - I'll say I can't. I'm gonna run out. You can't go, doc. If you walk out, where will Judy be? She won't be in jail, and that's where I'll be if I stay here. Besides, what can I do? - You've got to stop the examination. - Not today I don't. Are you a man or a mouse? You put a piece of cheese down there, and you'll find out. Well, it's been nice seeing you. Oh, no, you don't. You leave, it's over my dead body. Well, that's a pleasant way to travel. All right. Now, look, doc. You can't leave Miss Judy in a fix like this. - I know, but the sheriff... - Doc, doc. If you leave now, Judy loses the sanitarium. All right. I'll stay. You're gonna stay? I knew you'd do it, doc. Next, we will see... Just a moment. Take your hands off her! A fine doctor you are. You're not supposed to touch a patient without being sterilized. You don't see me running an examination like that. No, that's true. And I think it would be very interesting... ...to see just how Dr. Hackenbush does conduct an examination. Splendid, splendid. Show them, doctor. If you insist, I'll proceed. In case you've never done it, this is known as washing your hands. I'd rather have it rusty than missing. You'll go a long ways to see prettier drippings than those. Why sterilization? After all, this is not an operation, you know? Not yet, but I may get hot and operate on everybody in the joint, including you. Come, come, doctor. Aren't you ready? Now, Mrs. Upjohn, I guess I know my business. Of course, that's just a guess on my part... ...but at any rate, I know a thing or two about cleanliness... ...and that's more than I can say for that mountain goat standing there. Come, doctor. We're waiting. All right. If you insist, we'll proceed at once. Now, Mrs. Upjohn, I want you to take your arms... ...and let them wave through the air with the greatest of ease. Not too swiftly. - Like that, doctor? - Yes, that's splendid. How long do you want me to do this, doctor? Just until you fly away. I told you guys to stay down in that room with those pigeons. Dr. Hackenbush, tell me, who sent for these men? You don't have to send for them. You just rub a lamp, and they appear. - My name is Steinberg. - Nix. Nix. That's Steinberg. Dr. Steinberg, by a strange coincidence, this is another Dr. Steinberg. May I introduce my colleagues and good friends, another Dr. Steinberg? This is a Dr. Steinberg, Dr. Steinberg. Dr. Steinberg and Mrs. Steinberg. And, doctor, I'd like you to meet another Dr. Steinberg. And that's Steinberg Jr. If Dr. Hackenbush is not going to continue with the examination, professor... ...may we have your diagnosis, please? - With pleasure. In all my years of medicine... In your years of medicine. You don't know the first thing about medicine. And don't point that beard at me. It might go off. Dr. Steinberg, do you remember your diagnosis? Certainly. To begin with, her pulse is absolutely normal. - I challenge that. - Challenge that? - You take her pulse. - Pulse? - Take her pulse! - I don't do any pulse work. I am an acute diagnostician. Take her pulse. Take her pulse! Oh, no, no, no. My purse, my purse, my purse. He has my purse! You must forgive him. He doesn't spell very well. Oh, dear. Come, gentlemen. Let us begin. You shouldn't have done that. Now we're all unsterilized. What's the matter with you? Well, I must say, I've seen quicker examinations. Maybe, but you'll never see a slipperier one. - Are you ready to proceed? - We'll proceed immediately. Doctor. And what do you expect to do next? The next thing I think we should do is wash our hands. - You're absolutely right. - Oh, I've never seen... - Oh, what is the matter with them? - I don't know. - What is this? Get away! - Everything is going to be all right. Nurse, sterilization! Sterilization! - Are they mad? What is it? - No, we're not mad. We're just terribly hurt, that's all. Hey, just a moment. Just put the gown on, not the nurse, huh? Come here. - How's it a dame like that never gets sick? - But I am sick. Doctor, will you pay attention to me? You'll have to get in line. There's three orders ahead of you. That poor girl may be out there, catching her death of cold. - Same nurse, sterilization. - Doc, get away from there. - This is absolutely insane! - That's what they said about Pasteur. This is ridiculous. Put the patient in a horizontal position. - Oh, what are you gonna do now? - Be careful. Be careful. I don't want to be examined anymore. Do you hear me? Doctor, where are you? Oh, my. I want to get down. You let me down this very moment. Do you hear me? I'll get you down. I'll report this to Miss Standish. You wait and see. What are you doing? Get off there. Get off there! How do you like that, honey? What are you doing? Give me that. Get away from me. I don't want to have my head massaged! In all my life, I haven't seen such an examination! But there is one indisputable test. - What? - The x-ray! - X-ray! - X-ray! X-ray! All about the examination! X-ray! All about the examination! X-ray! X-ray! X-ray! That's enough! I will call the police! I've never gone through anything like this! - I certainly messed things up for Judy. - You messed things up? I suppose old Doc Hackenbush didn't throw a nasty monkey wrench. You no throw the monkey wrench. I'm the guy that did it. Now, listen. It was nobody's fault but mine. I don't want any more arguments. It was all my fault. I think he's right. It was his fault. Oh, it was my fault, eh? That's the thanks I get. I get you the first shower you had in years... ...you turn on me like a snake in the grass. - Someone's coming. - The sheriff. - Judy. - Hello, Miss Judy. - Hello. Hello. - You're the prettiest sheriff I've ever seen. - Thought I was the sheriff? - Taking no chances. I just brought you these blankets. I thought it might make it a little more comfortable living out here. Get up. Get up. Don't worry about our comfort. We bungled your affairs. You did your best, Gil. Yes, and our best was none too good. Tell me, is the water still running in the examination room? After tomorrow, I'm afraid that's Mr. Morgan's worry. Morgan, he no got the sanitarium yet. A lot of things can happen before tomorrow. The sanitarium doesn't matter anymore. Gil, you were right. I've been taking things far too seriously. It's much better this way. Now I can be free. I won't be tied down. I can enjoy myself and really laugh. Oh, Judy, please. Don't cry, Miss Judy. I feel sad, but I laugh. I laugh. Stuffy's laughing too. Look. Go on and laugh, Stuffy. Hey, look. Look at Hackenapuss. Laugh. Go on, laugh. Where did that come from? It can't be that bad, Judy. Look at those kids. Laughing, happy. Come on. You're just a kid. Laugh. Be happy. It's the sheriff. - Hey, you. - I ain't done nothing. You've got nothing on me. My skirts are clean. Yeah? This letter from Florida says you're a horse doctor. Put them all under arrest. They won't run, sheriff, if you break their legs. Get that horse. Get that horse. What's wrong with that horse? He goes wild every time he sees Morgan or hears his voice. Get him out. Hey, come here, you. Where do you think you're going? You can't get away with this. Never mind him. Get the horse. Why, you! Nice work, Stuffy. Stop that horse! Don't let him get out of here! Did you see that horse jump? And I'm doing some pretty fancy jumping myself. Let me off this rope! I'll throw you all in jail! Get me down! Get me out of here! This is no way to treat the law. You'll never get away with this! I'll get you. There he goes. If he's headed south, I'd like to make a reservation. Look at that horse. He cleared the automobile. I wish I could clear mine. Darling, perhaps that's why he never won a race. He's a jumper. Am I a sap. I have a steeplechase horse, and I don't know it. We're gonna find that added starter and see that he doesn't start. They're not pulling any fast ones. Hi Hat's not running. - But Hi Hat isn't a jumper. - He was jumping plenty last night. - But he can't beat your horse. - Well, I'm not taking any chances. My money is riding on Skee Ball, and that's not all. If Hi Hat wins, we can kiss the sanitarium goodbye. Well, Morgan, you got nothing to worry about. Hi Hat's not on this track. See he doesn't get on. Put a man at every gate. If that nag slips by you, it means your job. Here. Keep me posted. He's made it! He's made it! Go ahead, Stuffy! Go to it. Good luck! Ride them, cowboy, or we're heading for the lockup. Come on. We get a reserved seat. - Gil! - I got a man on every gate. - There's no sign of them. - See there's no sign of them till after. Whoa, Hi Hat! Whoa, boy! Hi Hat, whoa! Hey, what you got in there? If you believe in signs, Sherlock, look at that ambulance. - Now, wait a minute, sheriff! - Don't you start anything, Stewart! We'll just put this baby under lock and key. You keep searching for those other mugs. Stuffy. What's the matter? What's happened? What? Hi Hat's gone! - The race is going to start! - They won't start till we find Hi Hat. Now, listen, son, you're riding this race to win. I don't care what you do as long as the judges don't see you doing it. All right, men! Go to your horses! Soap! We are sorry for the delay, but the horses are now coming on the track. Twenty-five minutes late! The horses are parading past the grandstand. Only 11 are headed postward. Hi Hat, the added starter, is missing. This is the third running... Hey, Stuffy! Stuffy! Did you find him? Did you find the ambulance? Well, keep on looking. We know it came in. Now that the storm of hats has subsided... ... the stewards have ordered the track cleared for action. - Don't stop searching till you find them! - Here you are, boss. - And the horses are back on parade towards the starting point. They're going back now, up to the starting post. And everyone is getting his own hat, we hope. The horses are coming back to the starter now. They're very fractious. They are giving the boys quite a bit of trouble. First Legion is acting very badly... Free parking! Here you are! Free parking! Get your free parking! Come on! Come on, this way! They're coming up this time, almost in an even line. The starter has his flag up, and it looks like... Wait a minute! What is this? A horserace or an automobile race? Hold those horses! Hold it! Hold it! Plenty of room. Nice fresh parking today. Right ahead, folks. You girls got anything on for tonight? Hey! Hey! - Get that one! - Hey, get off! Going my way? Get them out! Get them out of here! Hey, Stuffy, did you find Hi Hat? Well, keep looking. He must be around somewheres. Get that horse out of there! There's been a terrible wreck! Come on! Hurry up! Help me! - Come on, we've got no time to lose. - Is she alive? - Get going, sheriff, I'll take care of her. - All right. - Well, here we are again. - Come on! Get them off before something else happens. - Turn that horse around. - It looks like he'll send them away. - Yes, yes... - Now, easy, easy. And now they go! - At last. - Flying Demon is third. Sun Helmet is fourth, and Green Goddess. Skee Ball showing the way in the center of the track... ... by two lengths. Sun Helmet is second. Green Goddess is third, and Flying Demon is fourth. Now they're going around the first turn with Skee Ball in front by two lengths. First Legion is second by a head. Wait a minute! What is this? What is...? What happened? Get me the riot squad! - Oh, Mr. Morgan, don't get excited. - I'm not excited! Shut up! Quiet, please. Your attention. Quiet, please! Your attention! Stuffy! The stewards have ruled this a false start... ... and have ordered the horses back to the starting post. Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will all... Stuffy, scram! Who knows, we may yet have a horserace this afternoon. Horses are back at the starting point. And now the boys are turning them about. They're very nervous, very fractious. They're having quite a bit of trouble. Get that wagon off of here! Get off! Get it off! Hi Hat, he got him away from me! I don't know where he is! What do you think that is, stupid? - Number 7! - Somebody's gonna pay for this! That's Hi Hat! They're coming up to the start this time, and the starter has his flag raised. And now they go! Here comes Hi Hat! And he's in the race! Come on! Hoof it! Skee Ball going to the front, First Legion is second... ... Flying Demon is third, Sun Helmet is fourth... ... and Green Goddess is fifth. Now there goes Hi Hat into contention. He's picking up the field, he's moving up between horses. And look at him go! He's moving up there at the leader. And Skee Ball's still in front, pressing into second. But here comes Hi Hat between horses, and now he's challenging the leader. Skee Ball in front by a length and one half. Hi Hat is second by three-quarters of a length. First Legion is third by a length and one half... ... and Flying Demon is fourth. Now Skee Ball is going out a bit. And they're coming to the first fence now, and Skee Ball takes it... ... but Hi Hat refuses. He's turning back. But wait a minute, wait a minute. He's going to try it. There he goes. He's going after it this time, and he's over! Oh, your idea worked, Judy! Flying Demon is third by three-quarters of a length. Sun Helmet in fourth. Oh, he's lost Morgan's picture! And he's going up on the outside this time... ... and here he is at the leader! It's Skee Ball in front. Here comes Skee Ball... Can you shout like Morgan? No, but Morgan can. - Third by three-quarters of a length. Skee Ball on the outside. And Hi Hat on the rail, with Flying Demon third... Something's happened to the loudspeaker. - Let me take a look. - Give me those glasses... It's you! Officer! You take care of Judy, and I'll take care of Morgan. I hope the judges didn't see that. Mind telling the radio audience what a heel you are? Come back later. I've had enough of y... If the police can 't handle you, I'll handle you myself! Keep that man away from me, do you understand? Get down there! And stay there! And see that I'm not disturbed again today! Get out of here! Get out of here! Oh, we've got him! He won't get away this time! - They're both down! - Stuffy's down! Skee Ball's in the lead! - Smell this. - Oh, get away! I don 't wanna smell anything! Get him out of here! Come on! How many men does it take to do this? Come on, Skee Ball! Come on, Skee Ball! Come on, boy! Skee Ball wins! He wins at everything! Let me out of here. Okay, sheriff, what are your rates for a cell with southern exposure? Gil, Hi Hat couldn't have tried harder. We were just unlucky. Great race, Skee Ball. Great race, Skee Ball. Get out of here! Get him out of here! - Why, it's number 7! - Hi Hat's the winner. - Hi Hat wins! Cancel that reservation. - It's Hi Hat! Gil, come on! Come on, I want to put the wreath on the winner! One more yell out of you, and he'd have jumped over the grandstand. - Stuffy! - Stuffy, you were wonderful! - Oh, boy! - I haven't seen so much mudslinging... ...since the last election. Come on, boy! Hi Hat! - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Emily, I have a little confession to make. I really am a horse doctor. But marry me, and I'll never look at any other horse.

Come on, Bob! This way! Hey, you all right? Gatling! They got a Gatling. Goddamn it, Cole! This stopped being fun about two years ago. Move that wagon! - Down! - Fire! Cole, Bob, you okay? Takes more than a cannon to kill the Youngers. - The cannon's doing a good job, Cole! - Some Indian tracker you are, Tom. You pay me to find Bluecoats. There they are. - Get me James. - Jesse? No, not Jesse. The one that can shoot. - Frank! - Frank! Hold your ground! Frank, up front! Jesse, watch your back. Watch your heads, boys. - Cannon or Gatling? - Fire! - Cannon! - Cannon. - Where you been? - What's up? Nothing really. When I put my head up, they shoot at me. - So, we got a plan? - My plan of pissing myself is working. I can hit those boys. We need a distraction. A distraction? Why the hell didn't you just say so? - He's smiling. - That's never a good thing. Get that rider! - We're coming, Jesse! - Head out! Take the hill! Charge! Pull back! Come on! Go on, get. Get! Go on! Go on! - Distracting enough? - They hardly noticed. - I could have done more? - Uh-huh! - Such as? - You could have worn a woman's bonnet. - That would've made an impression. - I figure. By the time you figure out stuff, I'm already finished doing it. You're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out. Goddamn, boy! Wait till we get to Missouri. Tell them gals about how Jesse James charged the Union Army. - He keeps that up, he'll outrank you. - I'll still be better-looking, right? Let's meet on that south road. See if we can get those Yankees Jesse here scared off. - Ride with me, cousin. - I could use the walk. All right. We'll have horses waiting for you at the road. All right, Rangers, let's ride! I would sound stupid saying something like that. Where you going? - There's Yankees back there. - War's over. General Lee surrendered yesterday at Appomattox. - Yesterday. - Somebody better tell the Yankees! - What do you reckon, cousin? - Home. Cole, we go home. We ride like hell and God help any fool who comes between me and my farm. That's the best plan I heard all war. Well, boys, let's ride! - Hello, Liberty, Missouri! - Let's go home, back to our farms. Planting corn, harvesting corn, eating corn. Corn gonna shoot me? - Then I love it. - Let's go! We got problems. Got a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory. - Hands off your hip. - Are you scared? Pick your fights. You taught me that. - Jesus, mercy. - That's Charlie Higgins. - I'm cutting him down. - Not now, Cole. - What's wrong with you? - Lf we have to kill them... ...I don't wanna warn them. I wanna make sure Jim and the girls are okay. Stop by and tell our ma we're fine. We'll see Doc Mimms. Excuse me, sir, we're here for the doctor. - Jesse. Frank. - Zerelda? - Little Zee Mimms? - You were little Jesse James. Yeah, but you got big! I mean, Zee, you aged! I mean, in a good way, you got big and older. - Frank, say something. - No, you're doing just fine. - Frank. Jesse. - Daddy. - Where's Web? - He rode right into them, screaming. - Web did that? - He jumped his horse over our heads. Killed 12 before they knew what hit them. - Took out a Gatling gun and a cannon. - Saved all our lives, doc. None of the Liberty boys would've come home if not for Web. God's truth. - Web died fighting? - Web died a hero. But still died. Doc, if there's anything we can do, we want to help. Think about yourselves. Don't end up like Charlie Higgins. They found out he was a Quantrill Raider. They arrested him, tried him by military tribunal and hanged him. - But there's general amnesty. - Not if you rode in a partisan band. You're in more danger because you've got a farm. Railroad men come in offering to buy land. Nobody sells. So the army starts hanging men who own farms for treason. All we've thought about is home. I'll kill anyone who tries to get me off my farm. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, it's fine by me. Let's think about this. - Lf we have a good story, we're okay. - What story are they gonna believe? You were in General Hood's Texas Army... ...until Sharpsburg, then were assigned to Jeb Stuart's cavalry... ...until you surrendered in Tennessee. - That just might work. - Yeah, that might just work. Now go on and see your ma. She'll be glad to see her sons alive. And for her sake, stay that way. Thanks for everything. Especially the story you told. - Look, Zee... - I'm going to go cry now. - Zerelda became a hell of a woman. - Oh, yeah. - ""Big and older."" - Shut up, Frank. You're a charmer. - I'll shoot you. - Next time, try ""fat and haggard."" My boys! My boys! My boys! My boys are alive! Oh, God! - Praise God, you're alive! - Not if you don't ease up a bit, Ma. - Did you kill Yankees? - A few. - Say your prayers? - Yes. Good. Come inside and wash your hands for dinner. - Ma, you look so good. - No, you look great! Look at Jimmy Younger, all grown up. - How you doing? - All right. - Your ma made us eat. - That was two hours ago. I don't see clean plates. - Thanks for accepting Tom. - He's Christian and killed Yankees. - Jesus told me that made him okay. - She's still talking to Jesus. - What worries me is, he's talking back. - I heard that. - Come on, Frank. - You play me that. You ever notice Zerelda's eyes? She got two, don't she? - I think one's glass. - Which one? - The right or the left? - The brown one. Don't make me tell the town about the fella you screwed in Atlanta. Talking to me? - That dance-hall girl at Bunny's? - Yes. Sadie was a beautiful woman. Not a man! - She had a nice mustache. - More than that. - She was European. - All right. I'll admit Sadie's a woman, if you stop about my Zee. - ""My Zee""? - Your Zee? From women 's eyes This doctrine I derive They sparkle still The right Promethean fire They are the books, the arts The academes That show, contain and nourish All the world I don't know what you said, but it sounded nice. That's Shakespeare. Now, he's European. Write that down, so I can say it to Zee? - I'll send you a telegram. - Thanks, brother. - Thanks for the help, Cole. - You did plenty over at our place. - You miss it, don't you? - What, the war? Hell, no. I miss things about it, but... - It was exciting. - Yeah. It was a lot of killing. Why miss that? Because we were good at it. Shoot, we were great at it. Tell anybody this and I'll kill you. You know I'm the toughest man in town. But you are one terrifying son of a bitch with guns. Boys. Howdy, folks, how are you? - Howdy? - Easterners. Fine, thank you, sir. I'm Rollin H. Parker, emissary to Thaddeus Rains... ...president of Rock Northern Railroad. This is Allan Pinkerton... ...founder of the Secret Service and under contract to Mr. Rains. As you no doubt heard, our railroad's moving west. Well, east would put you underwater. Moving west to open the frontier to folks. Your acreage is located on the proposed right of way. I am here to get your signature on this land-sale contract. And I'm authorized to pay you two dollars an acre. Two dollars? The price was set by the Department of the Interior of the U.S. Government. - This land ain't for sale. - I understand how you feel. You've made a lovely home here, but it isn't up to me or you. You familiar with the right of eminent domain? Yeah, I am. What about it? This land's about to be condemned. You see, I'm doing you folks a favor. Two dollars an acre is a one-time-only deal. After today, the price drops. If I were you, I'd sign the contract and we'll be on our way. Good day, Mr. Parker. You can tell Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where the sun don't shine. Shakespeare. I don't think you understand. You don't have a choice. Ma'am, I think that you should search your heart here... ...and try to do the right thing. Let me ask the Lord. The Lord says to bury them out back. Nobody will find them. - Somebody's in a vengeful mood. - Let them go. - We'll bury them next time. - Oh, all right. Now, ma'am... You folks are making a serious mistake here. Nicely played. Tell them what you told me. I checked the court documents for the rail bed. They don't need our land. They're using as much land as they can. Floor recognizes Clell Miller. They say if we don't sell, we'll end up with nothing. - Only if we don't stick together. - Loni Packwood. I say this is the last straw. I came back from the war. My farm was burned down. My cows was dead. And now my wife's run off with my cousin Jeb. That son of a bitch. He took my dog! Loni. About the railroad. He took my dog! - They got Cole! - He came to our house. Figured you'd all want to hear this. They came and made the same offer they made you folks. My brother Jim tried to chase them off. A detective hit him in the head and knocked him out. - Cole lost his temper. - Oh, no. - Just a little. - How many did he kill, Bob? Two. Because they worked for the Department of the Interior... The Army can hang him. Tomorrow. - What do we do? - Nothing! You folks will do nothing. Go home now. You too, doc. So you can swear that you know nothing about what's gonna happen. - Boys... - Doc, go home. They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys. Go home. Meeting's adjourned. Go home, everybody. Go home. - I'm staying. - Me too. Loni, Clell. - Couldn't lose him. - Jim, I said stay home! It's my fault. I want in. It was a matter of time before they hung someone. - And you're too young. - Too young? - I'm as old as you were, going to war. - And Web too. No. - You're wasting time. - Zee, go home. I was there for the hangings. You need to know how they do it. What order they do things in. If you mess up rescuing Cole because you won't listen to a woman... ...then damn you all. All right. Eight of us against a Union regiment... ...and Pinkerton detectives on Main Street in broad daylight. - He's smiling. - Is that bad? Very. Pinkerton, relax. The Army has everything well in hand. Nothing like a hanging to motivate people to relocate. It's not my job to relax. I've got men at every entrance so no one rides in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on that rooftop over there... ...just in case. Be it known that Coleman Younger be found guilty of treasonable acts... ...against military law and the Articles of War... ...to be hanged by the neck until dead. May God have mercy on his soul. Brilliant. Go on, hang him! Pull it! Sir, are you all right? Somebody get a doctor! The bullet left clean, but he's lost blood. He's gonna be fine, right, Daddy? Praying wouldn't hurt. Who's that? Stay here with him. We're checking all houses for a fugitive. Powell, out back. McCall, first floor. - I'm going up. - Who are you? - Oh, sorry, ma'am. - Well, I should hope so! Go! Go. Jesse, are you awake? Jesse, is that your hand? They're gone. What are you...? - I made them think I was alone. - Let's hope he pulls through. I think he's feeling better already. Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir. - It's a pleasure to have you. - I'm pleased to be here. - Really? - No, Parker, no! I'm really not pleased to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt... ...to discover why you can't evict a few simple farmers... ...from their pathetic mudholes... ...so I can build the greatest railroad ever. - I understand your distress, sir. - What's going on? Two weeks ago, we arranged to have the Army hang a local farmer. - That's good. - Unfortunately not, sir. A group of local thugs managed to rescue him... ...inspiring resistance. And Mr. Allan Pinkerton was seriously injured. Leaving you in charge of operations until he should return. A further impediment is that the garrison's moving on... ...so we don't have that stick to threaten them with. You see that as the loss of a tool. I see a power vacuum to fill. As we have the most power... ...we may move with impunity. I see, sir. I'll get four patrols together for action tonight. They'll see what happens... ...when they challenge the righteousness of progress. Yes, sir. - You shouldn't be up. - It's been two weeks. I'm sick of it. - You're sick of my company? - Of course not! - Teasing you is unfair. - What you do to me is unfair. - Well, I shouldn't tease a hero. - What? Everybody in the county knows you rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you. And not one farm's been sold since. Well, that's good, but I wasn't the only person... ...risking my neck that day. You're saying I should spend time with Cole Younger? With Cole Younger? No, I never said that. - You gonna stop loafing and get home? - What do you think, Frank? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you, she'll make me miserable. - What do you say, sir? - You're pretty much healed. - Thank you, doc. - Of course. Bye, Jesse. Bye, Zee. - You're looking more spry. - Shut up, Frank. Doc, I was wondering if later this evening I could come by? You're always welcome. Yeah, I know, doc. But I was thinking maybe I could take Zee out? Someplace near, with other folk. Near, you know. Here, but out. It's fine by me, Jesse. Don't worry, sir. I'll make sure they're chaperoned. That hadn't even occurred to me. I am deeply in your debt. You're very welcome, sir. The Army's leaving, so Cole can stop hiding and get back to his farm. We're meeting at the Younger place. Leave them alone. - Cole. - Clell. - How are you? - Hey, John. Thanks for coming. - How are you? - Hey, Cole. Hey, who's seen how Loni Packwood is dressed? Tom, come here, huh? - Thank you. - James! You behave yourselves. Look. Liberty's favorite son, come here! - I won't forget what you did. - Yeah. I'm pleased you came. - Why, thank you. - I'm very pleased you came with Jesse. There's a gaggle of girls hoping to dance with Jesse... ...who'll have to settle with my many charms. - Bob, you have no shame. - Not yet. But I'm hoping. - Let's dance. - Okay. I used to come to this rock as a kid. Imagine what life would be like when I got older. - You didn't want a farm? - I thought of being a river pirate. A river pirate? - Hand over your jewels, missy. - Thank God you grew out of that. - You did grow out of that, didn't you? - Mostly, yeah. I mean, it would be all right for a bachelor. Are you planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James? Not if I find the right girl. What's this ""right girl"" like? What's she like? She's smart. She's funny. She's bossy. She always makes me think. She's at least two steps ahead of me. Where will you find such a girl? From this doctrine... From women 's eyes these doctrine... This doctrine, I derive They sparkle still like... ...tiny sparkling rocks ""Sparkling rocks""? Yeah, little ones. Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems? Yes, it is. Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting? I planned on kissing you for a very long time. Bastards! Come back here and face me! - Cole, what'd they do? - Let's get back. We need some water. Get some buckets. - Get buckets! - Water! It's the Pinkertons. It's the railroad. Then Ma. Ma! Come on! Thank God. Ma! Ma! Ma! We know. We'll get you to Doc Mimms. You boys take care of each other. Ma, Doc Mimms... Well, look at that. The good Lord's a bit shorter than I reckoned. Ma? I think we can move on, rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else. - I don't care. - I didn't think you would. Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders', Will Hite. - Sheriff said it's drunk Kansas boys. - I say we kill some railroad men. No. This isn't a feud, this is war. - They've got more men than us. - What do we do? We do what we did in the war. We harass their supply lines. - We kill their men, they won't care. - Lf we take money and supplies... - Exactly. - That's a good plan, Jesse. I'll get more men, and Tom will ride with us. - Where do we hit? - I know a gal at the bank. See if I can get a list of where the railroad keeps money. - I'm so sorry, Jesse. - Me and Frank gotta leave for a while. But you and I, we've started something. I don't know what'll happen if you go. - Neither do I. - Just let the law... Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does. Whose justice, yours or God's? When will you stop? When I send them to their graves. I have bad news. The railroad payroll has been stolen. What do you mean? The railroad's money is in that safe. That safe? Excuse me, sir, the bank's closed today. - What? - It's a bank holiday. There ain't no dad-burned bank holiday. Get out of my way! - This is outrageous. Who are you? - The James gang. - The James gang? - Yeah. How about the James-Younger gang? The James-Younger gang. I'll whop you real good if you don't get out of my way. Stop! Excuse me, sir. It's a bank holiday. It ain't no bank holiday. What are you saying? - What are you doing? - Go on. Sir, the safe. - Ma'am, turn around. Cover your eyes. - Why? I'm gonna shoot him and I don't think you wanna see it. Hey, the safe. Now. It ain't no holiday. - It's a bank holiday. - You're right, sir. - Then why can't I go in there? - On account of that we're robbing it. Why didn't you say so in the first place? It's secret. - Fine, I'll just wait over here. - I'd appreciate that. Go on. - What the...? - What is it? Old Man Tucker is sitting there quiet outside the bank. So? When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling? - How'd it go in there? - Fine. How'd it go out here? We should talk. You can be smart or stupid about this. Only one way ends with you breathing. Just because we're robbing a bank, there's no reason not to be civil. - Where the hell were you? - I had you covered. - I got 5000. - I got 3000. $8000! That's $1000 apiece! Our luck is finally changing. These are the farm property rights the bank held for the railroad. Pass them over here before something happens to them. Whoops. Settle down. Not all this money's ours. No, it was the bank's. That's why we went to all the trouble of stealing it. We ought to give some money to our hurting neighbors in Liberty. They didn't risk their necks. Creating some goodwill will make it easier to dodge the law. Frank's being smart about this. Him reading books don't make him smart. - Yeah, it does. - No, it don't. Stay out of this. - I think Jesse's got a good idea. - Jim. Who put you in charge? I did a mighty fine job during the war. And I remember cutting a noose off you. That's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank. Two heads are better than one. All Jesse's doing is making a suggestion. We're waiting to hear what you think, Cole... ...as the other leader of the gang. That's fine. - What? - It's a smart thing to do. - Cole... - Hey! We decide something, that's it. We're in this for the long haul. This plan of me and Jesse's, it's smart. Gives us places to hide. Then no farmer will shoot us in our sleep. We gotta think... What's that word, Frank? - Strategically. - Yeah, thank you. - Strategically, because this is a war. - This ain't no war. What's that? Nobody paid me no $1000 to fight in a war. - Tom, are you cheating again? - I'm broke again. - Next up, Thaxton Switch. - That ain't a bank. It's a construction depot so it'll have ammo, explosives. We can take those and do a bigger job. - It's guarded by Pinkerton detectives. - I do so want to kill me some of them. Boys... ...we're famous. - What's this? ""Fidelity Bank was robbed on Tuesday by 20 armed men."" Twenty? You mean another gang robbed the same bank the same day as us? ""The outlaws, calling themselves the James-Younger gang... ...shot their way out, wounding the sheriff and three townsfolk. - The loss is estimated to be $50,000."" - $50,000? More like 50,000 pesos. ""It's believed to be the first daylight robbery in American history."" - I'll drink to that. - We made history? - We should be proud. - The rest is horseshit. Next time we're gonna have to set the record straight ourselves. Line them up. - Barkeep. - Whiskey. They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton guards... ...raided the payroll office and blew the track. - How much did they get from the safe? - $35,000 in currency... ...plus the added delay of miles of destroyed track. I'll kill them for blowing up my railway. - They didn't actually blow the track. - Who did? We did. I mean, our men did. Our workers planted the dynamite, but they were under duress. Pinkerton, what is going on here? You managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time. - They had to be dealt with. - By burning down their homes? You wouldn't have done that? I would have done that. But I'd make sure I killed them all first. - I want them arrested and hanged. - Do you think a jury in these parts... ...would convict one of their own? I doubt it. - We're beginning an interesting game. - This is no game. I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree. ""Rock Island Pacific Railroad Depot was robbed near St. Louis, Missouri. The James-Younger gang was outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives... ...but they were no match for the guns of the West."" Fine piece of writing. ""The gang destroyed the Thaxton Switch site... ...meaning that for months, farmers can sleep without fearing... ...the railroad is coming to steal their land."" Who wrote this? I'll see them hanged. That's the best part. ""The foregoing article was sent to this newspaper... ...reputedly written by the outlaw Jesse James himself."" - Hey! Look at that. - What is it? ""Better... ...slow down. Dynamite ahead. Too late. You're dead."" Yes, sir, that was a fine piece of driving. Damn. Thanks, Mr. Williams. You have to look carefully at these Yankee $2 bills. - Could you change this for me? Thanks. - Certainly, sir. - I'm sorry, this bill is counterfeit. - I don't think so. I'll need all your money so I can compare. Scientific method. I hear it's all the rage. Yes, you can compare all of them, Mr... James. - Jesse James? - Yes, sir, it's a terrible sketch. - That's all I have. - Thank you. Been a pleasure. Take care now, you hear? - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Pinkerton, why can't you catch these outlaws? It's early in the game, sir. Jesse James and I are learning each other's moves... ...feeling out each other. I'm losing millions while you play chess with these farmers. Hardly farmers. Each of these men has four years of fighting experience. They're disciplined and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band... ...this is the gang I'd create. So, what can you tell me? It's going to be a long winter. Take this road! Come on! - Come on, boys! Come on! - Let's go! Come on, boys! Let's go, let's go, let's go! - I never thought they would give up. - They were admirably persistent. Longest chase we've had. - Jesse, we gotta have a word. - Sure. The newspapers call us the James-Younger gang. Yes. Why not ""Younger-James gang""? We got three Youngers and two James. I like the James-Younger gang. I'll beat the piss out of you. Stay out! Jimmy's got a point. The Younger-James gang is confusing. - How's that, Bob? - Say we burst into a bank and yell... ...""We're the Younger-James gang!"" People will think, ""Younger-James gang? Is there an older James gang? How come we never heard of them?"" They'll think about that instead of raising their arms. - Can't argue. - Do we even have the same mama? Is anybody hearing me? I got a little idea. If I kill you, then Jim, I'm gonna have no argument. Pinkerton, it's been eight months. I see holdups and I see robberies. I don't see men on nooses. The James gang's encounters have been with local law. They're no match for the gang. - What about your detectives? - Listen, you! Shut up. I have to hunt this man. I have to get inside this man's mind. I have to anticipate him. And that takes time. Time, time, time. Oh, I can't believe this. Would you believe there are towns... ...where the James gang walks openly, as heroes? - Now, how can that be? - Because they are charitable. Give money to churches, to farmers. They gave Maddox sharecroppers enough money to build a school. - That's my money! - We should burn that school down. That's the way to win them back to our side. Pinkerton, hundreds of men have died to build this railroad. But they did their jobs. Now, this Jesse James, that's your job. Do your job. Then you let me do my job... ...as I see fit, without interference. - What can you tell me? - It's going to be a long spring. If people would hand it over and not shoot, there'd be less killing. - What's that? - It's my lucky rabbit's foot. - Took it off that dead fella. - That one's not working. What? Can I have your autograph? Take this to the West. Grogan, you take this. Take these towns. - You remind me of... - I can't write this. Your blue-green eyes remind me... ...of the land and the sky. - That's it. You might want to change that to ""I thought of you."" Look, just write the whole thing yourself. I think we know how this is gonna go. One false move and I'll blow your head off! - Bob? - You heard me, Jesse! You know how crazy I get! Crazy! - Bob. - We got a problem, little brother? Frankly, yeah. - I'm feeling a little left out. - It's the wanted posters, right? Yeah. Obviously, someone's not standing out in people's minds. Gents, we're in the middle of something. - Bob's upset. - The posters? - Yeah. - Don't say ""yeah"" in that tone. - This is important! - Okay. Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control. Yeah, Bob here will kill a man for sneezing. - He's our best shot. - Better than you, Jesse? Bob Younger taught me how to shoot. Now... ...how about we get back to the robbery? - Of course. - That means now, mister! Now. - That's it, no more bets. - One more time. Come on, talk to me! Talk to me, one more time! Pretty please! - Damn, Loni, you're lucky. - Luckiest man in the West... ...now that I'm riding with Jesse James! - You okay, Jesse? - Drinking whiskey? You're too young. Not too young to shoot a man, not too young to drink whiskey. Jim, you been with a girl yet? Tonight? I was just getting ready to go turn on that Younger charm. Not exactly. - Been with a girl ever? - Yeah, I've been with a girl! I didn't want to get one of them paid ladies. You know what I mean? I think so. You and Frank, Cole, even Bob... ...you get girls because you're handsome and famous. They look at me like I'm your baby brother. - But don't tell nobody. - No, I swear. Not a word. - You okay? - Tell you what... ...I can't drink good neither. - I'm gonna go outside and throw up. - You do that. Hurry. - Hey, Loni. - Oh, yeah. Let's go, sugar-britches. Just call me Lucky Loni Packwood. - The new rail route is complete, sir. - Parker? - Yes, sir? - What's that? That, sir? Jenkins will explain that. - Sir. - Jenkins. Yes, well, we have done a financial study... ...of the construction costs... - Jenkins! It's cheaper to go around Jesse James, sir. Even with the detours and the extra track... ...it's just cheaper. So you're telling me that Jesse James has won? Oh, no. No, no, no. See, every three months the James gang... ...circles back to Liberty, Missouri... ...and they pull a job beforehand. - So? There's only four banks within that radius they've not robbed. - Could you put men at all four? - Don't have to. I have a better tool at my disposal for narrowing it down to one. - What's that? - An intense hatred of you. Jesse. Things a fella's gotta do to get some respect. - You deserve it, Bob. It's about time. - Thank you. Listen, Jesse, we got a problem. It's Cole. - He's been full of vinegar lately. - He's planning a job. - He's what? - I don't wanna start trouble. - Tell me. - Cole, are you sure? - It'll be the biggest score yet. - What will be? Hyperion Bank, two days' ride. - Got $100,000 in railroad money. - That's all there? Don't sound right. - Lf you read it first, you'd be fine. - What are you saying? I've robbed as many banks as you. I know this bank. It's an easy job. - You're forgetting who's in charge! - Jesse. You're in charge? Huh? We ain't partners no more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger when and where to ride? - He didn't mean that. - Siding against me? Being with me is being against you? We don't wanna do that. None of us idiots wanna go against Jesse James, the greatest outlaw ever! Paper says without you, we wouldn't find a goat's ass with a stick! - You've been full of yourself lately. - You think so? You all do? Frank? - One of us gets an idea... - A bad idea! - I got us through the war. - And nearly got hanged. - That's it! - Cole! Boys, we don't want this! - I'm a better soldier! - I'm a better outlaw. You both hate the railroad! Do it, and Rains never comes west again! - What? - It's his money! He's paying out of his own fortune! You wanna hurt him? - Put your guns down! - I still don't like it! - Let me run the show, General Lee! - Jesse. Jesse! You want it? All right. We hit this bank. You'll be smiling once you got that money in your pocket. Cole Younger's gonna make everyone rich! Hands in the air! We're robbing this bank. Do what you're told, nobody dies. Hands up! Oh, no. Down! - Which one should I shoot first? - None. Jesse, you all right? Head for the end of the street! - Look! - Damn. Son of a bitch! Move, go on! - Dozen out back. - They gonna rush us? They're insurance, in case we run. Get inside! Get inside! Get in! Any ideas, little brother? Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord. Oh, shit! Let's get! Fire! Damn! Go, boys! Come on! - Let's go! Let's go! - Come on, boys! Come on! Jimmy! Easy. Easy. Rest here. Get some bandages and whiskey. - Too young for whiskey. - We'll make an exception. Hey, little brother. I'm sorry. All right, Jim? I'm sorry. It was the best time of my life. I was famous, you know? Yeah. - He was just a kid. - He was old enough. A boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How could he say no to that? Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't stop him. You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know. A war against the railroad. What the hell was I thinking? I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time. - I'm out. - You're out? Blood gets spilled, you're just gonna quit? Who's next, Cole? You? Me? Bob? - Can't go back, Jesse. - I ain't telling you what to do. Keep riding with Cole, that's fine by me. Frank? Get the hell out of here, then. Don't come back when you find you can't farm with a six-gun! Jesse. What are you thinking? There are lawmen all over. I had to see you. I'm getting married. I don't understand. The most wonderful woman in the world. I can't stop thinking about her. Zee, I've quit my outlaw ways. Come live in my home, and in my heart. Be my wife. Is that a yes? I never would've imagined us here. That's why I picked it. We can start a new life here. Will you be happy in Florida, without the excitement? I've got you. You keep me busy. We can go to the hotel, check in... ...then do something I've wanted to do for a long time. Wait a minute. Certain things wait until after the wedding. Driver, change of plans. Take us to the nearest church. ""Jesse Woodson James."" Jesse James. The Jesse James? I could lie, but I want this marriage to be legal. I'm starting a new life so I'm depending on your... - Discretion? - Discretion. - Sir, I'm a man of the cloth... - Well, thank you. ...who needs to repair a leaky church roof. Of course. Now let's have a drink. - In the church? - Communion! Have a good day. Hands in the air! This is a robbery! Move! The safe, now! Of course! - Sir? - What? Where's Jesse James? This here is the Younger gang! Understand? But the Youngers ride with Jesse James. You wanna die? Did ride. No more. You understand? - The safe, now! All right? - All right. Jesse James never went around yelling. This is the best score yet! Taking too long. People used to snap to. Well, that was because of J... The gang's reputation. If people think Jesse's riding, we won't get respect. We're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job. Bob, leave me alone. All right? Go on. What? ""The life of the James gang wasn't all killing. These young bucks had a taste for the ladies... ...especially the handsome, charismatic Jesse James."" Beg your pardon? ""Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James."" - Only a dime in the hotel. - Let me see. I'm not finished. ""When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling... ...Ladies flocked to him like flies to a candied apple."" As I said, hmm. Now, sweetie... ...you don't believe them silly dime novels, do you? Swimming. Swimming is good. Don't turn around. What? If you don't see it, then it's not real. Jesse James! You're under arrest! They arrested Jesse! - What have you done? - What's that, Bob? What have you done, Cole? - I ain't done nothing, Bob. - Swear. Swear on Jimmy's grave. Bob, you know Cole would never do such a thing. He and Jesse are best friends. Cousins. Blood brothers. Bob. I'm sorry, Cole. - We're moving you tomorrow. - But I like the presidential suite. You'll get a similar room, but the hotel's in Washington, D.C. You won't get a fair trial here, with a jury of James sympathizers. - So I get a jury bought off by Rains? - That's it. - Did you order our houses burned down? - Not that day. I'm guilty of many things... ...but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker. - This was you, by the way. - You almost ended my career. Pity. We're gonna hang you, you know. Yeah, I figured. Was it worth it? - I should've killed Rains. - That's what I'd have done. Well, I'm not hanged yet. You cocky little bastard! Oh, you'll miss me. No. I'll hang you. But I may miss you a little bit. Come on, you! So this is he. I remember you. You're Parker. I remember you too. - You killed my ma. - How did you know? Not such a menace now, is he? Well, I could always take off his irons. You cost me millions and months of delays in construction. I wish I could hang you every morning for a century. How do you like that? My father had it made when he started this railroad. I'll give it to my son, and he'll give it to his son. The right sort of men will always run this country. Not your sort. You'll always suffer. And you haven't changed anything. I made you think twice about burning homes down. - We'll speak in Washington. - You're on the same train? Well, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna have to pay you a visit. - Big words. - It's a promise. Get him on board. Open up! - Hook him up. - Come with me, boy. Take him back. Now, your guns. I don't like it. We can handle him. In the last 10 seconds, he could've grabbed your gun at least three times! If he lays a finger on one of your guns... ...you are all, and I mean all, dead men! He's chained up. I'll put that on your tombstone. Your guns! Give me two good cards. Everybody, ante up. Hey, stupid! Yeah, you! Glad to see you know your name, you dumb shit! - What are you saying, boy? - I recognize you. How? You left by the front door as I came in the back. You shut up now, boy! Yeah. Your wife said you did that to her too. Will this shut you up? I can do this without the gun. It just makes things easier. What the hell is that? Vengeance! Outside! Get up on the roof! You stay put, gentlemen. - Nice shot. - Thank you. Now go get my husband! - There's only four of them! - Move, you fools! Move! Come quickly! This way. Do it! That was for my ma. This is for everybody else. No, they'll set the Army on you! You and your wife. That is a nice watch you got there. Hand it over. If I can get you today... ...then you damn sure know I can kill you anytime I want. Sleep on that for the next 20 years. Give it to me! Hands up, now! Tennessee. The railroad has no business there. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee. Thank you. I'd just as soon kill you... ...but chasing you takes up too much of my time. Fair enough. Jesse James? Come on, let's ride! - Get arrested again, I'll kill you. - Yes, ma'am. - I blew up a train. - You're a hell of a woman. - Don't swear! - Yes, ma'am. - I missed you, cousin. - I missed you too. You know... ...when you got caught, they thought I had something to do with it. - Never crossed my mind. - Good. Things changed when you quit the gang. - Now I say, ""Let's ride."" - He ain't bad at it. - It's tough. - Where'd you get the riders? We didn't. Zerelda did. She makes a hell of an outlaw. So, what's the plan, Jesse? - We're gonna buy a farm. - Farm? - Down in Tennessee. - All right. Want to ride with the Younger gang for a while? Bye, boys. Tom. - Tennessee, huh? - Yeah, I think so. - Meet you there in a couple weeks. - I'll see you soon. - Thanks for that distraction. - Hell, they hardly noticed us. - Mrs. James? - Shall we? Shall we, indeed. Frank. Rangers. - Tennessee? - I'll explain on the way. All right, boys. Let's ride! - When were you gonna tell me? - I did. Because I asked. - Damn, am I ever gonna win with you? - Don't change the subject.

You had a very pleasant time at court... ...with those gallant young officers. With one in particular, I recall. Why have we come here? For YOUR sake. my love!

What time is it? It's scarcely daybreak... But I was told it was a matter of life and death. - Who gave you this?  - The cook's sister. - And she?   - Don't worry, madame... She told me to tell you... ...that she can hold her tongue. And the rest of the servants are asleep. Madame... If there is any way in which I can help... ""By the mill at the first bridge"". Denis! Maria! Oh, I never dreamt you'd come! How could it be otherwise? But here is so far... Ten days from Paris! Oh, darling, what's going to happen to us? - I do love you... I do!    - Dearest! These are for always. Always! And you WILL take me away from him? - Yes, I swear it!   - When? You must trust me, my dear... It will take planning... Your husb... The Marquis has powerful friends... It would never do to fail. First, I must go back to Paris. Back to Paris?! We'll need money, if we're to get out of France. Besides, I'm an officer... I can't desert. I'd have to resign my commission. Denis, I'm frightened! Let's not think of it now, dearest... We've many days to talk it over. Meanwhile... We mustn't wait too long. In 2 or 3 months, he'll be well, and... Madame... He's back from the baths. Tomorrow? Provide he isn't home... I'll get a message to you somehow. Au revoir, dearest. You've made extraordinary progress in 3 months, monsieur. In few days... you'll be able to continue your honeymoon. That's a nice way to put it, doctor! But the truth is... My honeymoon has never quite started! And to think you've been all the way to Paris! - Did you miss me?   - Oh, darling! What is it, Maria?... You're frightened! You're trembling! Can't you guess? I'm yours now... All yours! Oh, my dearest! We must leave at once... Tonight! What if Don Luis returns? He's been staying at the baths lately... But I know he's ever so much better... I'll watch for your signal. One candle if I can go... Two, if I can't. And if you're in trouble my dear... If anything should happen... Then, I'll light three! Dearest! Rejoice, my dear! Your husband is complete again! I shan't say good night... Dismiss your maid, when you've retired. Did you hear someone running about? Yes, master! What does this mean? Come here! No! What name?! His name?! Denis! You... ...a merchant's daughter! To soil the honour of my name! The world will never know... Do you hear me?!  Never! That I vow! There was no message, monsieur. They left early this morning... ...bag and baggage. Madame too? Madame, the maid, the marquis... Which way did they go? By the road to Issoire. Thank you. I'm looking for a coach... A large coach... with a bearded man and two women. It's here... came a little while ago. When her supper comes... ...serve it quickly... We may leave very soon. Did you know my dear that I have the reputation of being one of the best swordsman in Europe. However, it's too late to think of that, I'm afraid. And he's so tired, poor boy... So tired!... So worried! Not in the house, please... You are quick, m'sieur! Quick to betray... quick to dishonour! He's clumsy... He can't harm the young man. Denis! Order the coach Sancho... We'll continue our journey at once. Poor boy! Open up! Who are you? Never mind who we are... Give her money, and hold your tongue. Oh, m'lord! It's come, master! It's come... It's a boy! Alive?! Drive on, Sancho! I thought you were in Paris. Where's Maria? Didn't you bring her? I want to speak to your master. I see... I'm just a servant... Well, I'm not Maria's maid any longer. I'm her father's housekeeper. And his heiress, too, perhaps! Who knows? If you'll keep his house... well! Isn't he a darling?! Poor little fellow! I respect your feelings, sisters... In fact, I share them! But this is a girl's school... The child must be disposed of. Well... I'll speak to Father Xavier in the morning. He isn't an ordinary foundling... A satin cloak... a purse of gold... A male child cannot be reared in a school for little girls. Oh, Sister... This is St Anthony's feast day, too. Sister, we implore you! You may rest assured... Everything was done, that could be done. Buried in the The Alps! Maria... my only child! And the baby was buried, too. Maria, and the infant. Both of them. You understand? Aye! It's hard to be the bearer of such news. For a husband, especially. My little girl! Her bonny soul's at peace. If you'll pardon my mentioning it, at this time... There's just one other matter while I'm here in Leghorn... Your lease on this property is about to expire. If it suits you... I'd be glad to renew it on the same terms... ...for as many years as you choose. Thank you, seor. I shall want to keep it. It's where my daughter grew up. Au revoir, seor. Gone! No trace of her! Nothing! Nothing left! Nothing. But you're a great merchant! You still have your work, your ships! Aye! But for whom? Anthony... AN-thony! Daydreaming?! Father... Could I go for a walk outside the walls? When school is closed for summer, you may... But not before. I want to go now! Oh...do you?! And how do you think it would look... ...to see a great big boy like you... ...going in and out of a girls' convent. Mother Marie-Jos would be very angry. But she has REAL people to talk to. I have no one. No one? Only YOU. Pardon me, Father. Have you read your lesson? We shall see! Quid proxima...  quid superiore... nocte egeris... ubi fueris, quos convo-cheris... ""quos conVOCAVEris""! quid consili ceperis... quid nostra... quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris. Arbitraris? What we did last night... what you did the night before... where you were... whom you called together... what plans you made. Whom of us do you think is ignorant of these things? Now continue. O tempora, o mores! ""Alas for the times...alas for its..."" It's...? Mores...morals. An important word, Anthony... You should never forget it. Why not? Because morals are the foundation of a man's soul. With bad morals... ..a man is dishonest, ungodly. And his house soon decays to the ground. But the man with good morals... ...lives in honour and truth... ...and builds for himself a great and beautiful mansion... ...that lives for all eternity... ...through his children and his children's children. Someday I'm going to have a great and beautiful mansion. It'll have towers so high... ...that I can see the whole world. And it'll have a... Father Xavier... Sister Marie-Jos wishes to see you. Thank you, sister. Quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris? That's a question! Be sure you make it one. You'll meet plenty of others. Sister Ursula... Later, my dear... Sister Ursula is very busy now. You can have it! Oh, how sweet... I couldn't make out what it was. I have pigeons, too. And I. I have a rabbit. A rabbit? His name is Oliver Cromwell. You see, we're English. What are you? Is everybody something? Of course! What are rabbits? Silly! They don't count! But they're alive, aren't they? Certainly... Everybody knows that! I don't. I've never seen one. I can't keep Anthony much longer, Father. We'll have to place him. Look! My tall hat. The scoundrel! Who is the other child? Florence Udney... The daughter of the British consul at Leghorn. Father... We must find him a place immediately. Why in a few years... ...we'll send him to Rome to study... Can't we wait until then? No... this is a girls' school... I've no place for a boy of 10. He's such a child! It's no use arguing Father... I've made up my mind. I'm sure there's someone to take him... ...right here in Leghorn. A merchant, for instance... There are several in the British colony. Isn't he rather young to be apprenticed? It's never too young to learn a trade. Particularly for an orphan. Well... have you any suggestions? Perhaps Martin and Forsyth may take him. They're very prominent. What about the Casa da Bonnyfeather? Mr Bonnyfeather is a good churchman. He's been very lonesome since his daughter died. Well, then... let it be... The Casa da Bonnyfeather. Yes...Casa da Bonnyfeather. Look! Please tell Mr Bonnyfeather that Father Xavier has arrived. He's expecting us. Yes, Father... please go sit down. Dear me! Here... there you are. Alright, Father. Wait here, Anthony. Father! You've brought him? Bag and all! He comes to you, exactly as he came to us! Including the 10 gold pieces. 10 gold pieces! That's a goodly fortune for a lad his age! He hasn't any clothes, though. Cut that, man... we'll soon fix that! Here... give me the receipt. I'll sign it now. Thank you. Buried in The Alps... I'm sorry, father. For a moment, the child reminded me of my daughter. Bring him into the study. Anthony... come and meet your benefactor. How do you do, young man?! Do you think you'll like it here? I can't tell yet, Signore. That's alright! Be frank, and we'll get along fine! May God bless you for this deed, Mr Bonnyfeather. Thank you Father... We'll take good care of him... Never fear! Goodbye, Anthony. I want to stay with YOU, Father! This is where you commence your future, Anthony. You must have courage. Come... we'll look for some clothes for you. Guessippi... Ah...signora... Oh, the kitchen's so big! And there's the cook...Signora Guessippi We built the kitchen around her! Signora... this is Master Anthony... ...our new apprentice. He's in need of clothes... temporarily. Perhaps you could spare a shirt from one of your children. It'll be done, Signore. Who's the little girl? That's Angela, her daughter. Angela... Say hello to the little gentleman. Hello! May I play with Angela, Sr Bonnyfeather? Young man, you're here to work... You've lots to learn! I beg your pardon, sir. Of course you may play with Angela... Whenever you like! Oh, thank you, sir! And now, master Anthony, we'll go upstairs... ...and find a room you can sleep in. I'll search for the clothes right away, Signore! Angela... Angela... Yes, Mama? Come on! He's sleeping. It's Maria's, beyond a doubt. She might have given it to someone. She had a child, 10 years ago. The baby didn't live. How do we know? But Don Luis told us! After all, he was her husband... He was there at the time. Don Luis lied. Of course... If the Marquis de Vincitata... ...saw fit to abandon his wife's baby... ...there can be only one explanation! Oh, no! I won't have it thought that he... He's a foundling. And he'll remain a foundling. That's all very well to say... But if he bears YOUR name... He'll NOT bear it. We'll give him one. No father! No mother! No name! A child of sorrow and adversity... Adversity... Yes... by all the saints, he's earned it! We'll call him ""Adverse""! Now... and forever. Anthony Adverse. Angela... good morning! Anthony, get up!  It's late! Are we market today? If you hurry, it's after 7... Mr Bonnyfeather's having his breakfast already. Why didn't you call me? We've been making enough noise to wake everyone in Leghorn! Angela... Angela! Yes, Mama, I'm coming. Good morning, Faith. Good morning, sir. Good morning, my boy. Any news from Paris? Louis XVI has been put to death, as I expected. Marie-Antoinette will follow. Tony... watch what you're doing! You've become fairly impossible. Well, who wouldn't, with 10 children! Eh, Tony? Si, si Signore! Excuse please. 7 hens. No... 8. Fill up the teapot, someone! Fill it up yourself, you idiot! Woman! Then she burst out crying... and threw the dishrag in Poppa's face! Poor Tony... What's happened to him? It's the big state lottery... He's used up all our savings, buying tickets. You can imagine Mama, if he doesn't win something. I've been wasting all my pity on the King of France. Speaking of lottery tickets... Look. Is it yours? What would you do if you won? Well, first, I'd marry YOU! Then I'd buy a real villa... ...with vineyards... and a huge fountain in the courtyard. And a goat? The finest goat in Leghorn! No you wouldn't... You just say that. Haven't I always said it? It's different now... We're not children any longer. It's all the more reason to believe me. I wish I were a great lady! With beautiful clothes and a carriage all my own. Then you'd be proud of me... ...instead of being ashamed of me. I'll never be ashamed of you, Angela. Never in a thousand years! You will... some day. Look at me! You mustn't.... not on a road like this! Let's sing! Oh the spring will not be there forever... And this day will return to us never... All the promises made... You have all mislaid... I will wait here for you, oh my love. I'll wait for you my love. Attention, please! An American brig is docking... with merchandise from London. You'll report to McNab at once... He's over thee now, with the invoices. Anthony! You've become quite a man! I might even say, a handsome young man! Handsome enough to turn the heads of the finest young ladies in Leghorn. Tell me... Why don't you linger longer with younger people? I have work to do! You've plenty of time to spend with the cook's daughter. Oh, not that I object! She's a charming girl, but... But you've got to take your proper place in the world. What IS my proper place? Does anyone know? You're... You're a man, Anthony... You'll make your own place. Just run over to the quay... ...and welcome Capt. Jorham for me, will you? I'm told he's a diminutive old fellow... But he's proud! As all the Yankees are... You'll need tact! You can depend on me, sir. I hope so. I should like to find someone... ...with whom I could share my responsibilities. Sometimes, the great house of Bonnyfeather... becomes too heavy a burden for one man's shoulders. My shoulders are broad, sir! They belong to you... ...to use as you see fit. Run along.... and don't forget... Be sure to invite Capt. Jorham to dinner. Yes, sir! What was that crowd, out in the square? When? They're picking the winning numbers in the lottery tonight. Gambling! Did you hear that?! These foreigners 'd corrupt the devil himself! Thar she spouts! Pipe down, Mrs Jorham! Elisha, you're drunk! Belay your sheets, woman! So would ye be, if you'd had as much as me! Listen! They've finished... They're celebrating. It's Tony Guessippi! He's won the lottery! It's Papa! Wait... what's this?! Yes... look at me! It is me... Tony Guessippi! I have won the lottery! Insult me now, if you dare! Shut up, you fool! Wait! How much money did he win? 40,000 scudi... But it will not last him long! He has ordered 12 carriages! One for each member of the family! One moment, please! Tony, where are you going? Far away... to the home of my ancestors... And I am not coming back! Wait! Very well... Go! Take your family... Get out! And never let me see you again! Angela... you mustn't go! You don't know Papa when he's like this... I must take care of the little ones. I'll go with you. No... that would make things worse. Anthony, if you love me, find me later... But don't come now! Stop it! Angela, you can't go... you mustn't go! Anthony, I must! Let me go! I give up! Your name is Adverse, isn't it? Why did you grab me? Don't worry... I won't again! I'm Vincent Nolte, in case you're interested. My father's a banker... He does a lot of business with Mr Bonnyfeather. She's gone! Forget it... She'll come back. You couldn't catch her now, anyway. Oh, good evening Mr Bonnyfeather. I was just saying, my father's a friend of yours. Herr Nolte... the banker. Why, upon my soul... How big you've grown! Scarcely recognised you! Mr Adverse ought to get around more. I can't understand why we've never met. Anthony, why don't you and young Nolte spend the evening together. Thank you sir, but I'm not a man of leisure... I've work to do. I think you've worked too hard lately... It's time you relaxed and had a little pleasure. Later. He's right, you know... What do you say? Well... good night gentlemen! Have a good time! No thanks... I don't think I'll... Oh, come on! Does this mean you're closing down for good sir? Yes... I'm afraid so. Tell the men they're to have a month's salary... ...and their freedom. And you might add... I'm revising my will today. Each one of you will be remembered. Thank you, sir! The remainder of my estate... ...I bequeath to my apprentice... ...Anthony Adverse.... ...provided he is still living at the time this will is executed. If he is not living, at such a time... ...I desire that the residue of my estate... ...shall be divided equally... ...between the aforesaid Faith Peliolegus... ...and the Convent of the Holy Child. That's all you hear... Business is at a standstill. We're shutting down completely at the bank. So are we. And Bonaparte calls himself a liberator! He has to enslave people first... ...before he can liberate them! That's the way with conquerors. - What can we do?   - Fight him! We'll fight him! It's no use, Tommy... He's in Florence already. In a few days, he'll be here... ...and not a soul will lay a hand to stop him. Instead, he'll be hailed... Let's forget about Bonaparte... Think of something else. How about going to the opera tonight? There's a new company from Milan. Music before the battle, eh?! It may be the last we hear, for a long time. You're right... I'd like to go! Come along... let's buy the tickets. Look, Vincent... There's Angela! - Angela!  - Where? The shepherdess, there in the middle. I'm going down to see her! No, wait until the act is over... You won't be able to see her till then, in any case. Good night! Signora Bovino. Si, signorina. Signorina Guessippi. Si Signore... is she expecting you? I'm an old friend. Come in! Who is it? A gentlemen here to see you. Gentleman? What gentlemen? Adolfo, Maria, Nicolo, Pietrica, Vittoria... Anthony! Let me see you... It's been so long! That's right... So hard to find you! I've searched everywhere! Oh, Angela mia! Signora... and ovation... magnificent! Just as you predicted! Oh, I'm glad. Debrulle, they shouted... Debrulle! As though I were the whole troupe! The stars never lie... From now on your troupe will prosper! Bless you! Come... give us some wine! - We must celebrate!   - No, not now. Why not?! She doesn't need wine... She's happy! Let her be. She's asleep? Aren't you proud of me? I adore you! I mean... the singing. I adore your singing, too! Oh... silly! You couldn't possibly hear me with all those other girls pitching at the top of their lungs! Oh you're different! You stood right out! I'm awkward perhaps... Or do I sing off-pitch? You've learned how to get compliments! Not compliments, Anthony... I want the truth. Signore Debrulle... He's been very kind to me. He's a nice man... full of encouragement. But unless I can be a great singer... ...I'd rather not go on. Even if you could, I wouldn't let you. But I must earn my living somehow! Have you forgotten already? Forgotten? The finest goat in Leghorn! Do you still love me, Angela? Of course! What is it?! Your career? Yes... that is... Oh, Anthony, don't you understand? It's Bonnyfeather. He's never give his consent! Oh, I can make him understand! - I know I can!   - And if you can't? Angela, these 2 years have changed me... I've worked... I've earned a real place for myself in the house of Bonnyfeather. I repaid, in a way... a part of the kindness he's shown me. Then, if he needs you, he'll never let you go. The House of Bonnyfeather's closed its doors. Once again, I'm Anthony Adverse, orphan. I have nothing... I mean no inheritance... no tradition. But I have my self! And the name that was invented for me. With you, Angela... I could make that name stand for something. For a new generation... A great new family tradition. Are you willing to give up your career... ...and your name? For a man who hasn't even a real name of his own to give you? Oh, Anthony, I love you! Does he know you're leaving? No. Don't tell him then. Just go. Why? Because he's so selfish! He'll want to keep you. Not when he knows Angela and I are married. Anthony... take my advice. Bonnyfeather's through! From now on this house will be a mausoleum... A place to rot in! So will Leghorn, so will Europe, for that matter! If I were you, I'd go as far away as possible. Come in. Mr Bonnyfeather would like to see you. Put this in, too. When are you meeting her? At noon. Outside the convent. Goodbye, Maria. And good riddance! Come in, Anthony. Sit down. I want to talk to you. Anthony... How would you like to go to Havana? Go to Havana?! It's for you to decide, of course. But first let me do a little explaining. Now as you know... I'm being forced into retirement... ...by circumstances over which I have no control. And even if conditions should change... ...I feel I'm too old... ...ever to become active again. The wealth that I have accumulated, therefore... ...is of the utmost importance to me. But unfortunately... that wealth is in the form of credit. Money that is owing to us in all parts of the world. Now, among our debtors... ...is a firm known as Gallego and Son... ...which has its headquarters in Havana. Now, their debt is a very large one. It amounts to 75% of my entire estate. And so far, I've been unable to collect it. They refuse to pay it? Precisely. And with Europe in the throes of war... ...there's no possible way to force them... ...other than to send someone there. Haven't we an agent in Havana? We have... but he's failed repeatedly. Gallego and Son are slippery customers. One has to resort to all manner of tricks. Unless I'm mistaken... It will require months of constant effort. The employment of tact, influence... ...and above all, determination. Now, the reason I want YOU to undertake this mission... ...is because you're nearer to me than anyone I know. It's the sort of thing a man would entrust to a son... ...if he had a son. This is... ...the first real service you ever asked of me. When would you want me to go? I've arranged with Capt. Jorham... You can sail tomorrow. As soon as that?! Aye! The French fleet's on its way to Gibraltar to effect a blockade. In that case, won't I have trouble getting back? It might take a year... possibly 2! Would you be so good as to tell Capt. Jorham... ...to make accommodation for 2. Why? I should like my wife to accompany me. Your wife! Yes. I was married to Angela Guessippi... ...this morning. What time is it now? 1 o'clock. Well, I can't wait any longer... ...will you please fasten this note to the bell-pull, over there. Alright... drive on! You'll be sure to locate Angela... and tell her. Aye... that I will... And remember my boy, whatever happens... ...your home is here. Some day, God willing... ...the doors of Casa Bonnyfeather will open again... ...for you... if not for me. Thank you sir. I shan't forget. And how is our thrifty merchant getting along?... ...The Honourable John Bonnyfeather. That old fool?! The bigger fool... the better for you! Your inheritance. You flatter me... Your Excellency! Why do you always call me 'Your Excellency'? Well, perhaps if i saw you oftener than once every 2 or  years when you happen to be passing through Leghorn... If you think it's on my way... ...you're mistaken. When I left Madrid I had orders from the king... ...to proceed direct to Paris. So, you see?! Then take me with you, please! You promised! My dear... ...an attractive woman doesn't go to Paris... ...she lets Paris come to HER! Meaning YOU, I suppose?! You are so wise! So clever! But I know something that would kill you... ...if you knew! And when will I have the pleasure of knowing? When Paris no longer comes to Faith. Well, goodbye Capt. Jorham... It was a splendid voyage and I enjoyed it. Pretty smart navigating, too... The last time I hit Cuba... ...I was aiming for Charleston, South Carolina! Welcome! Welcome for the good Capt. Jorham! And this, I'm certain, must be Seor Adverse! Delighted to meet you! I'm Carlo Cibo. Mr Bonnyfeather's representative. And how's the enchanting Mrs Jorham? She's waiting for me on board. - Well, God bless you.  - Thank you sir. Now, Mr Bonnyfeather... Oh, yes, his letter about you arrived last week. Unfortunate. Quite futile! You might have saved yourself a journey. Oh... you shall see! My servant... devoted to me... He'll bring your luggage to my house. - But what...?    -We still have plenty of time! Bring Seor Adverse's luggage to my home. Don't sleep on your way... ...or you'll get a beating! My house is yours. We shall drink to the past... ...forget the future... ...and pleasantly live the present. I have a million questions about Europe... ...to ask you.   - Yes, but time is... Please...time is unlimited in Havana. I'm a gentleman of leisure... With a house full of servants... ...and charming disposition. And an overwhelming power of persuasion. You'll be glad I persuaded you, my friend! But wait till you see Havana! Seor, let me make myself clear... I've come to Cuba for one reason... ...and one only... ...to collect the just debt to Mr Bonnyfeather. And to return to my home and my wife, as speedily as possible. An admirable ambition, but quite futile. - Why?   - Because Gallego has quit! Gone away... There's nothing left of the firm but an old trading post in Africa. Well, I shall have to go there. Take it over, if need be. You can probably have it... But who wants it?! It's only good for slave trading. Slave trading?! Sure!... Gallego and Son were slave traders. Didn't you know that? My friend... the strongest men break when they try to battle with fate. Now, let me see... You need a bit of tailoring, the first thing... And then... Tony... did you hear me? Anthony! I said you need completely new and different clothes. I shall arrange with my tailors to... You remind me of Mr Bonnyfeather... The first time I met him... He thought I needed clothes too! And did you? As I recall, I was stark naked! My boy... you haven't stopped to figure out yet that life is just a series of sensations. Some to be desired... ...others to be avoided. That's all that matters! For instance... ...at this moment you and I are riding comfortably in a carriage... enjoying ourselves... ...while over there in that courtyard... ...a poor devil who is doubtless a much better Christian than we are... ...is being beaten to death. Hey... stop! Enough! Stop it! I'll start with you! Wait! Tony... To interfere with a master and slave is punishable by death! Come back to the carriage! Stop it! Back to the carriage! Listen! Bring the monk! I know you, Carlo Cibo! I know you! You've seen what happens to slaves... You've seen how a wicked system... ...has given one man the right of life and death... ...over his fellow men. You've seen a man beaten, tortured, killed... ...because he was unfortunate enough to have been born poor. My son... You'll meet a lot like her in Africa. I want to speak to Seor Cibo! We're honoured by a visit from the police. Be quiet... both of you! Tell them to keep on playing. Seor, I'm sorry to disturb you... ...but we're looking for a monk. A monk with Carlo Cibo?! Upon my soul! You know me better than that! - He was seen in your company.  - Impossible! Nevertheless, I must search your house! Have you a warrant from the governor? Not yet, seor, but nevertheless... Nevertheless you have to get one. Goodnight! - Has he gone?   - For the moment. - What can we do? There's no chance for Franois, I'm afraid... Unless you can smuggle him out of Cuba. You've both been very kind to me... I thank you... ...and I'll pray for you.  - Where are you going? To give myself up. There's no need for you to become involved. - Come with me.   - Where to? - To Africa.  - Anthony, no! In heaven's name, I implore you not to go... You'll destroy yourself... You'll live in eternal horror... Unable to sleep... unable to think! Followed always by the cries of those you've sold into misery. You cannot barter in human souls! My debt is to Bonnyfeather. It's a greater sin, not to repay it. I think you're making a terrible mistake, Anthony. Cuba is flourishing... You can go into some business here... ...and eventually pay off Mr Bonnyfeather. It may take longer... But it mustn't take longer. It must be done as quickly as possible. I must get back to my wife. My son... I will go with you to Africa. Now you'll have to withstand salvation, Tony... Morning, noon and night! Perhaps I'll need salvation. Receipts... 221 slaves at auction... Total proceeds today... 18,404. Net profit on last shipment... A nice profit. With luck, today's trading should settle the Bonnyfeather debt. Yes. And you'll be free to go back to Europe. I imagine you'll be glad to get away from this infernal noise! What do you want, Neleta? You have not ordered the food prepared for the feast after the trading. There's plenty of time. Please... you won't go away. Isn't there work for you to do? Ferdinando... welcome the chiefs for me. But they expect YOU! - They will be insulted!  - Do as I say! Mr Adverse... You ARE coming back with me, aren't you? I'm sure that Mr Bonnyfeather... Bonnyfeather! What does HE care?! Has he ever once written me? 3 years in this hole, and not a word! - Nothing!   - Well, perhaps... The master of Futa Jaloon must be welcomed by the master of Belagos... Not a servant. I give you my greetings... And by the blessing of Allah... trading will begin this day at the firing of the gun. I'll give 6. I'll take 8.25. Look! The strength of a horse... Teeth like pearls! He is worth 8! 7... and no more. Done! What's wrong here? This one thinks he's been cheated. - Only 7! He is worth...  - Quiet! If there's any more trouble, the trading will stop! You can go back to your villages as you came here... Penniless! Take him away! Bring another one. I see Franois is still helping the cripples. The chiefs hate him. They call him the White Devil-Doctor. Have you no pity? I told you I wanted no more trouble. I've said that Brother Franois may have the rejected slaves... And I say it again! He protects runaway slaves! He only protects those slaves that you's kill... because they've been rejected. Take your cripple away from here! Go on with the trading! Bring another one! Brother Franois! There is one other you might save. Who? Mr Adverse... Today settles the debt. I told you to go back to your huts! The time has come when you said you'd leave. My son, there can be no justification for sin. But what little justification you thought you had... no longer exists. You must go back. To do what? You have a wife. How do I know? Have I once heard from her? Maybe she's dead. In love with someone else. Find out. If she still loves me, she can wait a little longer. There's money here... money and power! For the first time in my life the name Adverse means something. It's respected and feared. By savages! You yourself call them brothers. Yet YOU would make slaves of them! Well, what am I? I'm slaving to pay a debt! And a slave to conventions and gratitude. Now, I pay a debt to myself. I owe myself wealth and power. I owe the name that was invented for me the right to perpetuate itself. It will not live, Anthony... It will die of its own evil... ....unless you give it back to honour and truth. I won't let it die. I'll stay here. When I can afford to leave, I will. Afford? Is it only the rich who can afford to be kind? And live without sin? I shan't come here to trouble you any more. If you want to see me, you'll have to come to my hut. The ship's going. With a big cargo, too. The last until the rains are over. Rains! Neleta, you've had your wish... The boat went away without me. I am glad! Master... Brother Franois refuses to come here. Very well... Why do you stare at me? Go in the other room! Get out! Get out of here! It's your move, Mr Adverse. Brother Franois! My son, what is it? You have a fever! Father Xavier! Where have you been? Anthony! Come... help me! Quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris... Father Xavier! Could I go for a walk outside the walls? What do you want? I've come to see Anthony. Get out!... We don't want you here! Angela mia! He hates you.  He said to go away! Help me to save him! If you don't go away from here... I'll take your flock, and ship them to Havana! Children, cripples and all! Your master wouldn't let you! How can he stop me? He is sick. I am master, now! Please! Remember what I said... I'll give you until tomorrow to be gone! Anthony, you must go back to bed! No word from Brother Franois? You told him I was still down with fever? I told him, but he will not come. Don't worry any more! You are better... You are getting well! In a few days the sun will shine! There will be trading again. Anthony will stay here... For great power... Grow rich! Power... Money... I must see Brother Franois! It's nothing! How do you know? Where is Brother Franois?! - In his hut, I tell you!   - You lie! He's out in the jungle... - They're after him to kill him!   - No! - Tell me the truth!   - I am telling the truth! You sent him away, that's what you did! You hated him and wanted him to leave Africa... You beast... You savage! Brother Franois! Brother Franois! You're dying! No, Anthony... It is you who are dying... Not I. Forgive me, I didn't know that... They didn't tell me you'd been driven away. Promise... Promise me you'll leave Africa. I promise! Brother Franois! Where do you go, Signore? Casa da Bonnyfeather. - On business?  - Why? The Casa da Bonnyfeather has been closed for the past 5 years, I expected it would be. Drive along. Your Excellency has lived in Leghorn? Yes... some years ago. Do you remember a Vincent Nolte? Yes... yes... I remember! He's in Paris, now. A great banker they say... A friend of Napoleon. He come here every now and then. What brings him back? Surely it can't be on business. He's searching for a friend... A young clerk, who went to sea and disappeared. Disappeared? Si, Signore, disappeared. Too bad! When the old Bonnyfeather died... ...left him a big fortune. Bonnyfeather is dead?! Yes... Over a year. Mr Bonnyfeather's housekeeper? Couldn't she locate this young clerk either? No... Lucky for her too. If this clerk will not come back... ...she will get all the money! Adverse, yes... Anthony Adverse! That was his name. Ever hear of him? There used to be an inn on the Strada Calypso... - Si... Signora Bonino's place.   - That's right. Drop my luggage there please. You trust me, Signore? Oh, I think so... Just say it's for Mr Adverse. Mr Anthony Adverse. Can you remember that? - You!   - May I come in? Did you think I'd died in Africa? I didn't know what to think... Your letters... You knew where I was, but you weren't going to tell, were you, Faith? Mr Bonnyfeather didn't want it known that you were engaged in slave-trading. Anthony... why do you take this attitude? We've always been friends. On the contrary... You've hated me from the first time I came here. But why? That's what I want to know! And why was Bonnyfeather so fond of me... ...to leave me his money? Why... he was in his dotage! That isn't true. You know the real reason... Now tell me! Tell me! Oh... Don Luis! This is Mr Adverse... The heir to Bonnyfeather's estate. Congratulations, Signore. Your arrival is most opportune. Would you join us? We have much to talk over. It's strange that I never heard Mr Bonnyfeather speak of you. I might say the same, Signore. At one time, Mr Bonnyfeather and I were very intimate. But that was before you were born. At least, before you were adopted. Don Luis... Do you know if Mr Bonnyfeather had any... ...unwelcome relatives? Anyone, of whom he might have been ashamed? What makes you ask? I can't help feeling that I'm related to him. The first time we met... I remember distinctly... He was sitting at his desk in the other room... ..talking to a priest. And when he looked in my direction, he stopped suddenly... ...and just stared. And tears came to his eyes. Your parents might have been friends of his. Perhaps. Yet, why should he make me his heir? You have no recollection? Only that I was raised by a group of nuns... ...at the Convent of the Holy Child... Anyone who could help prove Mr Adverse's identity would be very welcome, I'm sure. I know how eager he is. You...enquired at the convent? Records are meagre. I was left there on the 17th January, 1773. Abandoned?! Yes... in a black bag... ...containing a Madonna and a few gold pieces. Rather interesting... Don't you think, Don Luis? Young man... if I were you, I wouldn't seek to know more. You've been extraordinarily fortunate, as it is. But isn't it only natural... Considering the circumstances... ...it might also be dangerous. Why? For many reasons. I advise you to forget it! You are going to Paris? At once... about the will. I'll see Mr Nolte. I trust you'll have no difficulty in establishing your claim? Thank you, Seor. I really came here to locate Angels... my wife. I don't suppose you know what became of her? Angela?! Let's see... The last I heard, she was touring the provinces with an opera company. How long ago was that? 3 years... no, 4 years. And Mr Bonnyfeather never tried to get in touch with her? I couldn't say, I'm sure. Wouldn't it be more truthful to admit that you prevented him from getting in touch with her. Pray that I'll find her, Faith... ...and ease your conscience. If you have one. Goodbye, Don Luis. I'm indebted to you. For the tea. I told you I had a secret. I told you, years ago. You couldn't prove it. Oh, couldn't I?! There's an old picture of Maria... ...locked away in my drawer. The resemblance is still remarkable... Even a stranger would know. I should have let him die. I'd be a rich woman, if you had. I'd be in Paris, claiming an estate. Keep quiet! You'll have it yet! No I won't... There's not a chance. But I'll have SOMETHING for the life I've lived. The disappointment. The years of boredom. And you're the one who'll give it to me! - I?!   - For the price of that picture. For the honour of a grandee of Spain whose pretty wife had a child...   - Silence! Hurts, doesn't it?  Makes you cringe! You detestable creature! What is it you want? Your name... in marriage! - Are you sure?  - Yes! Sancho... Don't let that coach get past! What are you stopping for? There is a coach ahead... Pretty close, I should say... ...judging from the tracks. Never mind... keep going. Mr Adverse! - Have you any enemies?   - Why? Take a look at that coach down there... See it?... hiding behind the boulder... It looks to me as if they were waiting to shove someone into the gorge. Of course, they may not... But on the other hand, there is that precipice. How are the brakes? Hold the coach maybe... But the horses would drag us. Could you hold the coach, without the horses? Without the horses?! Come down here... I'll show you what I mean. If we could get that pin out, quickly enough... He was the best servant I ever had. The coach was rather handy, too! Let's see your papers! Come on... hurry up! What's all the excitement around here? None of your business! Are we far from Paris? 2 or 3 hours. Thank you. Major... I have some information for you... Yes, your Excellency? Some way back, we met an Englishman... ...who I recognised as a spy... He's travelling this way. An Englishman?! There isn't a doubt of it! He's travelling under the name of Anthony Adverse. Don't pay any attention to his passport! Thank you, your Excellency! We'll watch out for him! - Pleasant journey!   - Thank you, major! - What's the trouble?   - No trouble, monsieur... If your papers are in order, you'll be allowed to continue. Anthony Adverse? From Leghorn? Yes. Are you a native of Leghorn? - I was born there.   - Have you any proof? My passport. Step out, please. Is that not sufficient? You are perhaps unaware, Mr Adverse... ...that France and England are still at war. I may be English, but I'm an Italian subject. And your parents? Your father... What was he?! Don't you know?! Arrest him! The general will see you, Herr Nolte... that you'll do him the honour of remaining for dinner. Thank you Mr Bourrienne. It won't be much in the way of food, I'm afraid... - Just a military mess...   - I'll be delighted. What is it Doumet? I've arrested this fellow on grounds of suspicion. Also, for insulting an officer of the French army. - An Englishman.  - That's good enough. - Anthony!   - Hello, Vincent! How did you get here? Ask the major. Do you know him? Certainly I know him... His name's Anthony Adverse. We grew up together in Leghorn. I was told the gentleman was a British spy. By whom? A traveller in the poste-chaise... A Spanish nobleman. A Spanish nobleman travelling in a public coach? It does seem strange somehow... Strange? It's incredible. HE's the man you should have arrested. Sorry, sir. Release the guard. My apologies, Mr Adverse... I trust you won't mention this to the General? I'm glad to be relieved of the necessity. It's extremely regrettable, but unfortunately... - De Bourrienne...   - Yes, I'm coming. Excuse me, gentlemen. Tell me some more of this business. Well, the main thing is this... We advanced a huge sum of money to Bonaparte... ...with the understanding he would pay us back... ...the moment he could lay his hands on a lot of gold that is owing him in Mexico. He learned recently that the gold can't be shipped to France without the payment of an exorbitant tax. So he's refused to authorise its collection. Until he does, we don't get our money. Meanwhile, his failure to pay has brought us to the verge of bankruptcy And you too... personally! As well as my clients. Oh, it's frightful, Tony. Why don't you let me lend you the money that I've inherited from Mr Bonnyfeather. That'll tide you over... ...at least until this gold affair is settled. I wish there was some other means, Ouvrard. Frankly... I'd rather lose everything... than have Anthony run the risk of impoverishing himself. There isn't any risk... I'm absolutely certain the gold will be delivered. I too, monsieur. I've even got Mademoiselle Georges to use her influence with Napoleon. Mademoiselle Georges? Who's she? A new prima donna... Bonaparte's infatuated with her. An exquisite creature. I'm to have the honour of escorting her to the ball tomorrow night. You don't say! Would you like to go, Tony? Perhaps we'd better. It's entirely up to you. Well, gentlemen... I guess there's nothing more to discuss... Is there? Au revoir, monsieur... and thank you for your generosity. The money you're placing at our disposal... ...will just about save our skins. You're quite welcome. - Goodnight Vincent.   - Goodnight. Tony... do you realise what you've done? Yes. You may lose your entire fortune. Everything! I know. Don't you care for money? Doesn't it mean anything to you? Not very much, Vincent. A man died so that I might learn there was something besides money and power. Tell me, what's happened to you? If you don't want money and power... ...what DO you want? Angela. Good heavens, man... You're not still looking for HER? She's probably... Probably dead... probably forgotten me... Probably this, that, or 1000 other things. I think about it till I'm ready to go mad. Then I assure myself that one thing is possible... SOMEWHERE... Angela is waiting for me. Be reasonable Anthony... Why should she wait for you? Because she's my wife. Because we pledged ourselves to the future... ...of the name that was invented for me. With her, I can give it roots in the present... ..and have children to carry it to the future. Love, a home, a tradition! These are the very essence of a man's soul. There are his wealth and his power. Without them, he has nothing. The general is early tonight. Naturally... He's expecting Mademoiselle Georges. According to Mr Nolte... You had some very exciting adventures in Africa. Please tell us about them! I assure you I never had one quite the equal of this. Your friend's quite intriguing! And I think very handsome. Wait until you see him without his mask! I can hardly wait till we unmask at midnight. Mlle Georges has just arrived. - Mademoiselle... your mask.  - Thank you. Mademoiselle... May I have the honour? Pleasure, monsieur. This is once, Ouvrard... ...that I am willing to acknowledge my indebtedness to a banker. I've been told that Napoleon is a bad dancer. You were told right, Mr Adverse... watch! A friend of yours? No! I thought... Mr Ouvrard must be hiding... I can't see him anywhere. - Allow me...   - No, please! Can't seem to place him... Show him in. I hope you'll pardon me... The nature of my visit... Debrulle! Why of course I remember! It's been a long time since Leghorn. Nevertheless, I should've remembered the name. Where is Angela? Surely you must know! I do... that's why I'm here! Oh my friend... My friend! Tell me, Debrulle, is she still with the troupe? No... no more. Has she given up her singing? Well... not entirely! She still sings a little. Where is she now? She's taken a cottage out near Passy. Passy? Then I can see her at once! Why not! Bless you! Come on... hurry! Why does she live in such an out-of-the-way place? Well, perhaps because she prefers it. Go... Go, she's waiting for you! Anthony! Don't talk! Just let me hold you close to me! You've changed, but your eyes are still the same. Oh darling, what happened? What EVER happened?! Bonnyfeather promised to tell you... He didn't! I went there once... ...but he sent word by Faith that you didn't wish to see me. - Faith lied!  - Is it true you went to Africa? Faith would have told you that... She knew that I was planning... Let's not think of her now! She doesn't matter. All I want is to see you... ...feel your presence... ...and to know we're together. Forever, this time. Nothing must ever separate is again... Nothing! Why, Anthony?! I've died a thousand times since I saw you last. I've been greedy and cruel... I've wanted wealth and power. Now I know there's nothing I want, but you. Only you. And the future that we'll make together... - Anthony...  - Yes, mother? You won't have to go to Havana to find your father.  He's come back! This is he! My son! And then what? He took the child in his arms. Was I right? As usual. That is all... you may go. A child in his arms... Do you want him arrested? For being in love? Don't be a fool! We can order him out of France. No, that's wrong. He must leave of his own accord. Congratulations! What for? Bonaparte's agreed to our scheme. - On the Mexican gold?  - Yes. I've never seen him more amiable. And whom do you think he's chosen to go to America? - How would I know?  - YOU, Tony! None other than you, Anthony Adverse. Provided you're willing, of course... sit down... Let's talk it over. The gold will be smuggled into New Orleans... where you will receive it... and arrange for its transfer to Philadelphia. There it can be shipped on a neutral boat, direct to France. It's our only chance to get hold of it, Tony. Failure means bankruptcy. For you, as well as for us. You don't seem to relish the idea. Yesterday I should have welcomed it... now... Decisions of this sort take time, naturally. On the other hand we can't disguise the fact that it's a matter of the gravest importance... for all concerned. I understand. I'll give you my answer within 48 hours. Don't worry, Vin. It's your, now. I want you to keep it always. - Goodnight mummy.  - Goodnight, darling. You've won him completely. Angela... Have I won you?... That's the question. Anthony... you must go to America, regardless of me. I couldn't. Not even to save Vincent. But you're own money's at stake, as well as his. Some day it should go to our son. You wouldn't want him to be poor, as WE were. You're my wife, Angela. I can't understand you're not wanting to come with me. You're hiding something... What is it? I have my career. You told me once, you didn't want a career unless you could be a great singer. Truly great. Yes... I remember. After all, what does it mean to be great? Look at Mlle Georges and Bonaparte... Everyone knows how she managed to succeed. Is that what they're saying? You don't envy HER, do you? No... I don't envy her. Why won't you come with me... Why? Oh, my darling! My sweet! You're all the world to me. You're everything I ever wanted. I only know that, now. Don't say any more, Anthony! Please don't say any more! I didn't mean to make a scene. I must be nervous... I always am when I'm going to sing. Sing? Where? Tomorrow night. - At the Opra.   - Here?! In Paris?! Yes. That's wonderful! Did you think I'd mind?! I'll be there to hear you! Oh, I'll be so proud! Oh, Anthony!... Oh, my husband... Hold me close! Have you heard the rumour about the necklace? The one Josephine has been begging for. They say Bonaparte's given it to Mlle Georges! No! He wouldn't dare! Will she wear it, do you think? No woman could resist a triumph like that! Good evening, Ouvrard... Greetings! How DO you do?! This is quite a surprise, Don Luis! I didn't expect to see you in Paris. Nor I to see you, Monsieur. Allow me to present my wife. Life is strange, is it not, monsieur? Incredibly. I can't find Angela's name on the program. Ssh! Mlle Georges is about to appear! That's her voice! That's Angela! Quiet! That's Mlle Georges! That girl used to wash my clothes. I remember. The necklace! You see it? Goodbye, Anthony! Goodbye. Dearest Anthony... You are far better fitted than I to take care of... ...of our son. I send him to you with all the love in my heart... I know he will be happy. Forgive me... for not seeing you again. Angela. Mummy said that I'm to go away with you. On a big ship. Your mother said that? She did... Honestly! Are you sure you didn't ask her? All I said was... ""Why don't you come, too?"" And she said... Well, she would make it, some other time. But that YOU had to go, and it seems a shame not to have someone to go with you. So I said... ""Alright, I'll go!"" Did you mean it? Do you really want to go? Oh, Father! Set tight all tacks and braces! Well, here we are... off to America! - Ever been there?    - No, never. Lots of people going nowadays. And they ain't coming back, either. Looks as though they'll have a big country over there! Peace of mind. That's all they're looking for. A chance to lead lives of their own making. Great place for youngsters, too... They grow up big and strong! You'll like it Master Adverse. ""Adverse""?  Is THAT my name? Yes. It's a new name, son. Three people made it. Father Xavier gave it a mind... Father Franois, a soul... And your mother, a heart. We must never forget them Anthony. - ""Anthony Adverse""?   - Yes. Anthony Adverse.

Buying a map for a buried treasure. You ought to have your head examined. - I didn't know the map was a swindle. - You and your emeralds. You ought to be put in a padded cell. If we'd found them emeralds, we could've left the army... and lived like dukes. See? That's the fellow that sold me the map. Just a minute. Let me take care of him, will you?

How did you get here? You're a funny bloke, Din... but I'll admit you're a good bhisti. - Could be first-class soldier, sahib. - Don't make me laugh. Get to the river! - Come on, you savage, over you go. - Over you go. All right, give me that. What's the matter, Bal? You've been woolgathering ever since we crawled out of the river. - You know, my time is up on May 14. - What of that? You can sign on for another nine years, can't you? Make a man out of him. I'm leaving the service. - Leaving the service? - That's right. I'm getting married, and I'm going in the tea business. - Married! - Tea business! Why, you're mad if... March to attention, everybody! Let's march in in good style, men. - Fall in up there. - Left, right, left. Tell the Sergeant to report at the office immediately. Yes, sir. Party, right wheel! Halt! Left face! Sergeants to the front! The wiring party's returned from Tantrapur, sir. Eight killed, three wounded. Otherwise all correct. Very well, Sergeant. Dismiss your men... and report at the office immediately. Very good, sir. Party, dismissed! - Identical, Mitchell. - Good heavens, a Thug pickaxe. It's incredible, but that's what happened to Markham. I'm afraid they've done away with poor Burgess, too. There's been none of this for 50 years. Thuggee. That's what it is, Mitchell. What's Thuggee, sir? A murder cult Col. Sleeman crushed 50 years ago. The Thugs were the most fiendish band of killers that ever existed. There were at least 10,000 in India, and they murdered 30,000 people a year. Thuggee was practiced from the Himalayas to Ceylon. The order was religious and worshipped Kali, the goddess of blood. The Thugs were stranglers, weren't they, sir? Stranglers. They dug the graves of their victims in advance. Mitchell, we must stamp this out immediately. The Lancers will scour the country west of Tantrapur... - you will search the regions to the east. - Right. - What do we do, sir? - You're dismissed, Ballantine. MacChesney, you and Cutter will leave tomorrow with a stronger... Ballantine, you're dismissed. You and Cutter will take a stronger detachment tomorrow... into Tantrapur, to finish your work. Maj. Mitchell and I will be in close touch with you at all times on either flank. Keep your eyes open for Thugs. Ballantine would be a great help, sir. If I may remind you... the three of us have always brought off things very well together. Yes, sir. He's indispensable. Ballantine's leaving the service in six days. He's getting married. Couldn't you put your foot down? Forbid the banns? Something like that? When the parson says, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace""... couldn't you give him a roar, sir? You know what I mean? Higginbotham will replace him. Dismissed. - Tommy, I've got you back again. - And I've got you. I'm here to stay, forever and ever. Forever and ever. That's horrible. - She's charmed him like a snake. - The siren. Wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes. Me, neither. I can't stand it. Me, too. Left! Right! Center! As you were! Company, attention! Right turn! Two paces forward. March! Head up, chin in. Get those thumbs behind the seams of your trousers... Get them back. Lower that left shoulder an eighth of an inch. That's much better. Otherwise you're looking very regimental, Din. Thank you, Sergeant. - Was salute satisfactory? - That's the idea... only you want these fingers to fan the eyebrows, more like this. The breeze from them fingers ought to almost blow this eyebrow off. Now try it again. Very good, indeed. That one almost blew your turban off, didn't it? Very regimental, Din. Keep them at it, Subedar sahib. They may need it. Tell the Subedar to drill the men till sundown. - Where did you get the bugle, Din? - Please, sahib, I find when nobody looking. Don't you know that's very naughty? Please, sahib, don't take away. Bugle only pleasure for poor bhisti. Thank you, sahib. - Sahib care to hear new call? - Not now. Very regimental, Din. Company, attention! Company, dismissed! Let me see your tongue, Annie. I'd like to try it, Sergeant sahib. Very old Indian remedy. All right, go ahead. But be careful. If anything happens to her, I'II... Understand? Cry my eyes out. No, sahib! Very little bit goes very long way. Gulp it down quick. Then you won't taste it. I know. You want your daddy to give it to you, don't you? Daddy will give you the medicine. Give it to me. There. Be a nice girl, now. Or you'll never be strong and big like Daddy. If Daddy took a spoonful first himself, Baby might do a patty-cake for him. This is delicious. This is... All for a nice little elephant girl. This is lovely. You ain't so stupid as you look. That's better. Annie, don't ever worry me like that again. There you are, you two. I've got letters for both of you. There. Sgt. MacChesney and Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Look what it says here. ""Miss Emaline Stebbins requests the pleasure... ""of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company at a""... What's that? ""...betrothal dance preceding her marriage to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. ""8:00 p.m. Friday."" That's tonight. I worried so about you, dear, while you were away. Perfectly awful things must have happened at Tantrapur. It was rather touch and go there for a bit. - You haven't told me yet about it yourself. - No, I haven't, have I? I had to give my undivided attention to the repairing of the wires. Cutter and MacChesney should have watched out for the enemy... but they were off chasing butterflies or something like that. I finally got the detachment to the river, and we dived in and escaped. Tommy, you're so marvelous. That's all there is to it, I suppose. On the last roof we almost lost MacChesney. His great elephant hoof crashed through and stuck. - How did you get him out? - We had to saw his leg off at the hip. If you don't believe me, just look behind that shrub. Save some for the elephant. Destroy the evidence. - Stand guard, will you? - Yeah. Never mind that, Sergeant. Stand easy. - Good evening, Colonel. - Evening, Stebbins. - Good evening, Major. - How are you? No formality. We just dropped in to wish little Emmy the best of luck. That's very nice of you, sir. I'll bring Emmy to you. - Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant. - Yes, sir. Very jolly, sir. Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out? Is that punch? Some peoples calls it a punch, sir, but I calls it swill. Nonsense. Stebbins is famous for his punch. Have a spot? Rather. Excuse me, sir. I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir. Too watery, sir. Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach. - We'll be the judge of that. - Wait, sir. There's a fly. - I don't see a fly. - Neither do I. There it is, sir. It just dove under the ice. I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy. I got him. Hear him? Humming like a beehive. He's gone. Ain't that a shame? There he goes. Come along, Mitchell. I think we'll forget the punch. Tommy, you know we have Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition. That's right. The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough... - to replace Sgt. Ballantine. - That's very flattering. I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service. One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment. I've got a feeling they don't like me very much. It's just as well. - The army's no place for sentiment, I says. - That's right. Excuse me. I've got a pebble in my left boot. Hello, Higginbotham. - How would you like to come with me? - What? I'd like to discuss a few of my military theories with you. I'd like to have a little chat, get to know each other better. - How about a bit of a drink, Bert? - Thanks, Cutter. - Where's Ballantine? - Never mind that civilian. I got Bertie Higginbotham, his replacement. Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner, haven't you, Bertie? We can look after that, old boy. Take a plunge into this punch. Punch? That stuff's for drummer boys and old ladies. - Not that stuff. - That would knock a horse down. Swill that down, me boy... and you'll think all the Thugs in India is a bunch of missionaries. That's right, Bert. That's a funny thing. The punch tastes all right. It's all right. Bert, how about having another drink? To the new comradeship, Mac and you and me and the regiment forever. - That's it, Bertie, my boy. - I'll drink to that. All right. Here's to good old Bertie Higginbotham... the finest soldier since William the blooming Conqueror. Down the hatch, boys! Which of these two do you prefer? I don't know. Try them both. One for each window. Don't be silly, darling. It's as much your problem as it is mine. - I know. - These curtains are for your den. My den? What's this, Sergeant? Buying a trousseau? We're buying curtains. I thought it was for underpants, the kind civilians wear in the tea business. Will you two leave and stop annoying Tommy? I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off to Tantrapur in 20 minutes... and Tommy's marching with us. But Higginbotham's replacing him. The Colonel said... Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss. I grieve to say, Miss, that the man is a tower of pain. - Something he must have ate. - Or drank? Sgt. Ballantine, fall in! - Tommy. - It's the Colonel's orders, Miss. Tommy, these friends of yours have engineered this behind your back. Don't cry, darling. Goodbye. This is May 9. I'm going with you for five days, and good company I'll be... but at sunset on May 14, when my time is up... wherever we are, I'm going to knock you two apes' heads together. Now come on. - Pardon me, madam. - Fall in! Your petticoat's showing. Ek Number! All's well! Do Number! All's well! Teen Number! All's well! Chaar Number! All's well! Paanch Number! All's well! Swing those picks there. You think this is a strawberry festival? Shake a leg with that pole. Come on, get it up there at the double. This is a fine time for things to go quiet. Blast them Thugs. Why don't they come and give us a good fight? Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist. Come on, hurry up, I told you. How can we get a nice little war going? What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal or one of them sacred tombs? What do you want to do, start the Indian Mutiny again? Annie, get your back into it! Hurry up! He's even snarling at poor little Annie. You can't work 24 hours a day, you know. In another 24 hours, my time will be up. I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me. Get it up, hurry up. He's tired. It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do. A brilliant bloke like him, too. Cutter, we got to do something. Come here. - What now? - Look, Mac... for four days we've been waiting for them Thugs to start something. Four days in this cruel heat and horrible tension. - What's that to do with Ballantine? - I'm coming to that. Go on. Three hours from where we're sitting, by a secret trail... there's a gold temple waiting to be sliced away and carried off. Have you started after this buried treasure again? Just a minute, Mac. This one ain't buried. According to Gunga Din, it's standing right out in the open. According to Gunga Din, eh? I thought he might have been at the bottom of this. What's the idea of this lushing? - Give me that bottle. - Wait! Just a minute. MacChesney, I'm here to speak, and I'm going to have my say. You want Ballantine to stay with us, don't you? - Of course I want him to stay. - All right. Just a minute. It's as easy as parting your hair. We take Bal to the temple, show him the gold... and the moment he starts slicing at it... marriage and the tea business will whiz from his mind. MacChesney, versus that, you can't think of a single argument. Cutter, I'm warning you. - What's the matter with you? - What's the matter with me? I'm sick of it! Now shut your trap. - You mean you won't go? - No! And if you mention gold temples again to me... I'll tear the back right off you with a shovel. Very well, MacChesney, you made your choice. I offered you the chance to be a millionaire... and you turned it down. All right, I'm going alone. Wait a minute! Cutter, you ain't leaving this village without my permission. Give me that bottle. I've been a soldier for 14 years. I know my duties as well as you do. But you're not talking to a soldier now, you're talking to an expedition. I'm an expedition. Out of my way. Cutter, sit down before I throw you down. Make way for the expedition, if you know what's good for you. Goodbye forever. Stand back. I'll throw you in the clink if you make a move. Out of my way before I split your jaw. - Cutter, I'm warning you. - Come on, put 'em up. Come on, out of my way. I'll bash your ugly face in, that's what I'll do. Come on, put 'em up. I'm afraid I have to do it. Sgt. Ballantine. - What? - Come here. Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell. Lock him up safely until he comes to. I'll lock him up. I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too. Then I'd lock you both up at the same time. Good old Din. What's up? Tonight, when everyone sleep, Din go back again. - See gold. - You did? Where is it? Didn't you bring any with you? Bhisti cannot carry whole temple. - Whole temple? - Din see it. All gold. Here, now. We've got to get out of here now. Get me some tools that I can rip these blinking bars out with. - Already bring all tools could find. - Yeah. Is this satisfactory, sahib? Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding? Go on, get something big. Jaldi! Up, Annie. Please, Annie. What are you doing, Din? A large tool you asked for, sahib. Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me. Work for me. Get me out of here, Annie. Come on, Annie. Be a good girl. Whoa, Annie! Just the bars! Alert the guards! - Wake up! - What? The Thugs are here! Why didn't you say so? I'd like to get a crack at them. What happened? - Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant. - What's that? Thugs stole Annie. Stole Annie? They'll stoop to anything. How many were there? - Couldn't see. - Where did they go? - The hills. - Sound assembly. Sgt. Ballantine, pick 16 men and follow me. MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks... Fall in the remainder! Put every man on guard duty! - Very good, sir. - Steal Annie, will they? I'll break every Thug's back in India! Din, are you sure you're on the right trail? Yes, sahib. Here is the bridge, sahib. - Is this bridge safe? - It's safe, sahib. Safe? What do you mean, safe? Make her stop that. She's making me nervous. Get out of my way. It's no time to do a thing like that! Annie! Take your foot off. Annie! Take your trunk off. Annie, please go back! That's gold, bugler. Look at it, bugler. That's yours and mine. Archibald Cutter, the blooming duke, look at me, and Rajah Gunga Din... pouring diamonds out of that there blinking water bag. Bugle will be very satisfactory. Come on, Din. The world is ours. Kali. Sahib, come quick. Thugs, lift up your faces... to the light that shines from Kali's throne. Brothers in Thuggee... we are the friendless of this earth. Every man's hand is against us. We have been kicked, spat upon... and driven to the hills like wild things. My father was a Thug, and he was hanged. His father was blown from a cannon's mouth. And what of your kinsmen, your fathers and their fathers... and their fathers' fathers before them? My brothers, a new day is at hand. I have read the omens, and they are good. Three nights ago, a jackal screamed upon the left. Another answered from the right at once. What does that mean, my brothers? It means that Mother Kali, with all her arms outstretched... hugs us to her bosom, welcoming us back as Thugs... Thugs awakened from a sleep... of 50 years. Let the neophytes and their teachers draw near. Where are the stranglers? Give them their strangling cloths. Give them their burial picks. Swear by our Mother Kali... to be thrice faithful to her and to me and to our order... and to all of us. Rise, our new-made brothers. Rise and kill. Kill, lest you be killed yourselves. Kill for the love of killing. Kill for the love of Kali. Kill! It's them all right, Din, the whole blinking lot of them. Very bad men. The Colonel's got to know. You must get there, Din. The Colonel's got to know. The Colonel? I run quick. Since mighty roast beef is an Englishman's food It accounts for the freedom that runs in his blood For generous living Does it do all good Excuse me, mates. Oh, the roast beef of England And, oh, the old English roast beef Sing us a song, will you? You're all under arrest. The whole bunch of you. And you, too. You know why? Her Majesty's very touchy about having her subjects strangled. I can't waste any more time. Come on, wrap up your gear. You're coming with me. Hurry up. Guruji. If it ain't young Toad Face. Fancy meeting you here. Vile dog. For that insolence, you shall grovel before my son. You shall grovel, I say! Look here. I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen, and I don't grovel before any heathen. Kabul, take him to the tower... and teach him the error of false pride. Take him away! In those drear gray hours before dawn, just go out and chase elephants. Beats counting sheep a million miles. What do you mean, elephants? This ain't elephants. This is Annie, my Annie. I'll find her if I have to turn out the whole British Army. What the blazes is this? Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning. What the blazes are you here for? I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine. Higginbotham, I could just fall on your neck. I got a better neck than mine you can fall on. That's a good one. Hello, there! Tommy, hello! How wonderful of you to meet us. I came here to surprise you, and here you are, surprising me. - Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney. - Good morning, Miss. Here are Tommy's discharge papers. Cutter will be very pleased about this. - Column of threes! - Eyes front! Sit up straight there! Who do you think you are, a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park? Walk march! Forward! Party, halt! Sgt. Ballantine, take charge. Go inside, dear. I'll be right with you. All right, but do hurry, so we can leave soon. - Naik, what about this? - He just came back, Sergeant sahib. Come here, you. Din, I knew you was at the bottom of all this. Didn't you knock down the shed and take off Sgt. Cutter? You'll answer to me. We'll have a court-martial here and now. - Line up a firing squad. - Please, sahib. You stole the elephant, didn't you? Answer me! You knocked down a building and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner... Sgt. Cutter, didn't you? - Yes, sahib. - That's all! Take him away! You Lazarushian beggar, it'll be the firing squad for you this time! Wait a minute, Mac. Where's Cutter? Din, where is Sgt. Cutter? - They catch him. - What's that? Who? In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter. Who's they? Priests or what? Very bad men. They'll give him torture. Go help, quick. - How many men? - Don't know. - I run away quick to bring help. - I'll bet you ran away quick. And you'll run back just as quick, too. Show me the way. - I'll pick a dozen men. - You'll pick nothing! I'm going alone. You haven't a chance. I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop. They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party. - Right. We'll go together. - No. Tommy, what's the matter? Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out. Don't worry, I'm not taking him. I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service. - I'm not taking any civilians with me. - Who's a civilian? It says here, ""Thomas Anthony Ballantine... ""is restored to the rank of citizen of Great Britain... ""and his duty to Her Majesty's service is over and done with."" Try and keep me out of this. I'm saying goodbye, Bal, and I wish you luck in the tea business... and your matrimony both. Wait a minute, Mac. Wait right here. I have to talk to him. - But he said you can't go. - He'll change his mind. - I won't let you go! - Darling, I have to go. I owe it to Cutter. - He's saved my life time and again. - You don't love me. Do you want me to go through life remembering that I ran out... on one of my two best friends? After what they did to Higginbotham, and dragging you up here again? That's just the way of showing their friendship. I hate the army, I'm through with it, but friendship, that's something else. But we're wasting valuable time. You have to understand. I'll be right back. - I want to talk to you. - You? I don't want to argue... I'm going if I have to shoot you and go alone. You know as well as I do why you can't go. If anything happens to you, I'd be in a fine mess. Your girl would prefer charges. - She wouldn't. - I don't trust her. There's only one way I'll risk it. - What's that? - For you to sign up. When we get Cutter, we'll tear up the papers. It'll be according to regulations. Is that fair enough for you? You're getting clever again. Do you want me to get kicked out of the army? All right, I'll sign, but on one condition. That I hold the blank in my hand and I keep it after I'm through. You don't trust me. That's right. All right. What are you doing with that in your pocket? I always carry one. In case. No, you don't. Not a word of this to Emmy, you understand? Shake on it? Hurry up. Excuse me, miss. Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out on a reconnoitering expedition. - Yes, sir. - If we're not back by morning... inform the Colonel, and you follow our trail. - Come this way. - Excuse me, Miss Stebbins. - I'm going, Emmy. He's changed his mind. - Who made him change it? - Reason and common decency. - You're lying. Would I lie at a time like this, just before our wedding? Be reasonable. You didn't sign anything? Why ask a question like that? Do I look that stupid? Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic. That's all it'll amount to. We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple without firing a shot, just by strategy. We've done things like this before. It's just a lot of fun. - Fun? You want to go. - Darling... - Sgt. Ballantine, fall in! - Right, sir. He called you sergeant. Why? You're not in the army. It's just an old habit, hard to break. I'll see you tomorrow. Why don't you come right out and say you don't want to get married? You'd rather be with him. Why fool me by telling me how you hated him and his ugly face... and all the ugly faces in the army? - I didn't say quite that. Be fair. - Please, sahib, hurry. - Come on, Sergeant! - Can't you wait a minute? Sure, I can wait, but I'm not so sure about Cutter. - Can't you trust me? Kiss me goodbye. - No, never. They're probably slicing Cutter's ears off by now. - I'm coming, Mac! - Darling, please don't go. You don't want a man for a husband. You want a coward who'll run out on a friend in danger. That's not me, and never will be. I don't care how much I love you, and I do, very much... I'm a soldier... I mean, I'm a man first. All right, MacCheesecake, get that silly smirk off your face. - Come on. - Let's go. Surely Mother Kali is kind. One Englishman fly walks in, and now our web is baited. More will follow. Two more have crossed the bridge. It is well. Prepare. You said this place was full of priests. - Sahib do not give Din chance to say. - You've got a mouth, haven't you? Quiet. It's Kali. A Thug temple. Why didn't you tell me they were Thugs? I've a good mind to split you in two and stuff you up an elephant's trunk. MacChesney roar so loud... poor bhisti cannot get a word sideways between roarings. Enough of that. We're here to find Cutter. We should have brought every man in the regiment. I only wish you had, sahib. Hello, Din. Fine work, bugler. I knew you'd do it. Thank you, sahib. - Hello, boy. - Hello, mate. You're alive, anyway. What's this? I'll chop you down right away. So there you are, you white-livered elephant-stealing treasure hunter. Look at you, hanging there like a lamb in a butcher's shop. Where's the troop? There's no troop, and the Guru has us. We right walked into it. You mean to tell me you didn't bring the troop? What a brain! I round up every Thug in India, and you mess it up with that pygmy brain! I couldn't face my own men if I brought them to witness your shame... disgracing Her Majesty's uniform. Shame? They're doing this to me to find out where the column is. They plan to ambush and massacre the Colonel and the whole troop. - You didn't tell them, did you? - Not me. So I suppose you think you're a hero? - That's right. - A hero. Don't make me laugh. Every man at the post looking for these blighters... and I reconnoiter adroitly and encounter them... while you cowards hide behind your telegraph poles in Tantrapur. Who's a coward? - Untie him, will you? - Yes. Untie me. I said untie him! Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man! You displease me greatly, and I ignore the both of you. - I'll untie him myself. - Yes, that's right. Only one hand, that's all I need at you. Just one hand. - Hurry up about it. - I'll take all day, if you order me around. I owe you one, anyway. Mate, look at your back. - Never mind that. Untie my hands. - Just look what they did to you. I'm sorry, mate. The fiends! - The Guru. - Filthy scum. - Dog. - Maniac. - Let's get him. - Here we go. Grab him regardless how many are with him. It's our only chance. He's sacred, so they won't shoot us. Why, you hairless dog. Look what you did to that man's back, you filthy... A lesson in the error of false pride, Sergeant. You're talking very proudly yourself. Perhaps you're not too proud to give a little information I seek. - I want to know about your army. - Why don't you enlist, mate? Lash. For a beginning, this is not bad. Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali... three soldiers and a slave. - Who is slave? I am a soldier, too, please. - You're what? Regimental bhisti. Proud ox, where is your army? How soon are they to follow? Wouldn't you like to know? Why don't you look in your crystal ball? Make the ox talk. You dirty pack of cowards! Never mind him. Now. He's next. - I'm waiting. Will you speak? - I don't know. Hold on, Mac, old boy! Stop. Look. See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out? Are you going to speak? Throw him in. He'll talk from there. - No, I can't stand it! - Will you speak? All right. If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you. Take me outside. - Be a man, Mac. - I can't go it, mates! Come back, Mac, old boy! - Well, Sergeant? - All right, guvnor. I don't know the exact position of the troops... but in Ballantine's pocket there's a paper with all the troop movements in it. - You're sure of that, Sergeant? - As sure as taxes, guvnor. - I wouldn't fool you. - I hope not. If you have, there'll be worse than lashes. Please don't lash me any more. I'll relieve you of these. Cut him down. ""Sgt. Thomas Ballantine hereby reenlists."" That's you, MacChesney, always hiding behind regulations... you Brummagem turncoat! Be gallant in defeat, Sergeant. You're simply a victim of superior strategy. Quiet, you Whitechapel scum, or I'll cut your slaggedy hands off at the wrist! - I'll pay you back with horrible interest! - I command you to shut up! Tell your men to lay down their arms and get out of here, or you're a dead kipper. Lay down your arms and leave. - Where do those stairs lead to? - Not to freedom. - We'll see about that. Ready? - Right. - Sgt. Cutter, guard that door. - Right. Mac, take your coat. Right. Get up. It's young Toad Face blazing up the Thugs. I'll start with him first. No, you won't. Gentlemen, what do you think of your freedom now? All right, my friend, if we've got to die, you've got to die, too. As long as I'm alive, you live. - What did he say? - He says he'll be unharmed. He says to keep order, be confident, and wait. Congratulations, Sergeant... on your knowledge of our humble language. That's enough. Get under the shade... before you get sunstroke. Go on. Get on back. Wounds feel satisfactory, sahib? I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts since I ran away from home. - Thank you. - Fall in. Come on. - Get down. Look out. - Watch your head. - The gold! - Yes, sahib, gold! Look at it, mates! Gold! That's what it is! - Real solid sunshine! - Sit down, you fool! See that hand sticking out? I bet that little hand's worth 3,000 if it's worth a farthing! Who's a blinking idiot now? We're rich, mates. Come on! All right, Mr. Wise Man, here's my last offer. You order your men to get in behind them rocks... and you see us down as far as the bridge. We'll let you loose, and there's no harm done. How's that? Speak, you ape, or I'll kill you. You would throw away your shield, brave soldier? - Do you hear something, Bal? - The bagpipes, Mac? I've been hearing them for hours, but it isn't them. It's the blistering heat screaming in our ears... that makes it sound like it. They'll pull us out, old boy... if they can find the blasted place. Don't waste any of your guff on me, Mac. Here we are, and this is it. It might have been worse, though. I might have left a widow. Eight feet away from where I'm sitting, right here... there's enough gold to make me sole owner and proprietor... of a pub as big as the Crystal Palace. Best pub in Hampshire. And here I am. You torturer! Setting that in front of my eyes. Is there no limit to the torture an Oriental mind can think up? So help me, if you mention gold again, I'll tear the tongue out of your head. Here it is. Get it. Brave soldiers, can it be that your nerves are tightening? We can stand it up here as long as you can, Mr. Wise Man. Preserve your courage, gentlemen. You are not forgotten. They will come to save you. That's right, mate. You're going to see more soldiers than you ever saw before. Gentlemen, good news. Here's a sight that should make your hearts pound faster. Look. The Lancers. Look at the Black Watch out in front. Those beautiful Scotties. I'll buy them all a beer apiece. Your comrades' coming chokes you with emotions. Seeing them this way recalls to you all manner of pleasant things. The gaiety of barrack life, old friendships... even England... even home. You bet it does, mister. Save your voices, gentlemen. They're coming here to your rescue. You tormenting fiend. - You're so sure, aren't you? - Quite sure. It is my plan. Two come to rescue one... then the others follow. If you planned it right, mate... you'll be hanging by your filthy neck by nightfall. You think so, Sergeant? I'm not so sure. You seem to think warfare an English invention. Have you never heard of Chandragupta Maurya? No. He slaughtered all the armies left in India by Alexander the Great. India was a mighty nation then... while Englishmen still dwelt in caves and painted themselves blue. Look. Don't be afraid, gentlemen. I am still your shield. It is very simple. Your army will enter by that gap. Then they'll proceed halfway down this gorge. Those are my infantry. The best mountain fighters in the world. At a given signal, they will open fire on your troops... driving them forward into the trap. That is my artillery. Rather neatly concealed, don't you think? My gunners greet them with a full salute. And finally, in come my horsemen. This is, gentlemen, my household cavalry... similar to that which guards the person of your Queen Empress. Each man is mounted on a valiant charger... and eager to slay for his guru. The honor of the thunder in and slaughter of your army falls to them. I see it in your faces. Who is this ugly little savage... to snarl so boldly at the British lion? Prime generals, friends, are not made of jeweled swords and moustache wax. They're made of what is there, and what is here. - You're mad. - Mad? Hannibal was mad. Caesar was mad. And Napoleon surely was the maddest of the lot. Ever since time began... they've called mad all the great soldiers in this world. Mad? We shall see what wisdom lies within my madness... for this is but the spring freshet that precedes the flood. From here we roll on, from village to town... from town to mighty city, ever mounting, ever widening... until at last my wave engulfs all India. My soldiers! March! - Toad Face, if you make a move... - Stop, or I'll slit his throat. Obey me, my son! Beloved guru, our men will not move if it is to cost your life. What is my life to the life of our cause? Go! - No! They will not let you die. - Go! No, you don't. We need you. Wait a minute. You have sworn as soldiers, if need be, to die for your faith... which is your country, your England. India is my country and my faith... and I can die for my faith and my country... as readily as you for yours. Go, chota. India, farewell. You have warned the English. You must die. Our guru has given his life for our cause. We must not fail him now! We must get up there and warn the Scotties before they're trapped. We may not warn them, but we've got to try. Come on, mates. Let's go. - Good work, soldier! - Thank you, sahib. Look. Before I have your faces tied to bags of hot ashes... I want you to watch as though you were rajahs at an Imperial Durbar... while your comrades are slain to the last man. Bonnie Charlie's now awa ' Safely owre the friendly main Mony a heart will break in twa Should he no' come back again You see, soldiering isn't all war, Mr. Journalist.

They're getting away! Fire! Good work, bugler. Fire! Charge! Cut their heads off. - Poor old Din. What a mate. - Mac, look! Here they come! - Come on! - Hit them again! Get them off! Speak to me, Bal. They've killed him! You'll pay for this. I'll make you pay for this. Take that. And that! That's right. I don't trust you. Why, you dirty, scheming scum. You rotter.

Fire! - Very good, my boy. - Thank you, Colonel. - Not half bad. - Thank you, Colonel. Let's take a look to the men. Stand easy, men. We've all done enough soldiering for one long day. You were fine today. Particularly fine. I'd sooner hear that from you, sir, than get a blooming medal. Thank you, sir. Perhaps you'd take care of this for me, sir. And here's a man of whom the regiment will always be proud. According to regulations, he had no actual status as a soldier. But those who had the privilege of serving with him today... know that if ever a man deserved the name and rank of soldier... it was he. So I'm going to appoint him a corporal in this regiment. His name will be written on the rolls of our honored dead... and I... Let me see that last part again, will you, Mr. Kipling? Present arms!

Holt, she's here! 'Get out of bed, Holt!' 'Come on, get up! Get out here!' 'Come on, come on, look lively'' Come on, everybody. Get up. She's here. 'The boat is here.'   Oh, my God.

I've got the goddamned cannon and its.. Oh, hello. Hey. Hello. Did you have a pleasant journey? Where's my cannon? Yes, where is my...cannon?  Oh, my God. Elizabeth? I'm Jane. Jane. Where's my cannon? Riano! 'Find my cannon and bring it to me immediately.' Stand by, Mr. Holt, with your camera, if you please. I want this recorded. I know who you are. Riano, I want my cannon up there right away. Mr. Holt. Mr. Holt, she's here. She's here. 'Let's get a look at her and see how she works.' 'Mr. Holt.' Hello. Hi. Mr. Holt. Your camera, please. That cannon is the key to the whole bloody thing.  - Go on, go on! Shoo! - Hello. Hi. Ah-h.  I'm so sorry. Moses is the original bull in a china shop. I'm Harry Holt. I'm with the Parker expedition. Can I help you? Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you. I've seen your photographs, Mr. Holt. You're very good. Then, James Parker would only have the best. He does like being photographed, doesn't he? Well, I-I think all great men, they feel a sort of 'an-an obligation to history.' You don't think my father just plain enjoys his own image? Not at all. Not anymore than a.. - He's your father? - Jane Parker. I didn't know. He didn't say anything about your coming. I didn't even know he had a daughter. - Neither did he. - 'He knew.' 'Miss Parker, this is Nambia. She's from the Masai tribe.' 'Your father calls her Africa.' My mother. We need to get you out of here. - You'll take my tent. - No, I couldn't. - You must. I insist. - But what will you do? Share a tent and...don't worry, please. I'll be fine. Now, let's get you settled.    'This son of a bitch looks at me with a wild look in his eye' 'and he says, ""there's nothing to do but go up.""' '""Go up, go up,"" he says' 'Well, he knew we had to keep moving' 'or we'd freeze to death right there and then' 'and that would be the end of it.' 'So, I took his advice, yelled to the boys' '""Rope yourselves. We're going up.""' 'Everybody looked at me as if I was bloody crazy' 'but I wasn't, this dumb son of a bitch was crazy.' He was crazy, you know. If it hadn't been for you we'd be buried up to our bollocks in some icy grave. There was no.. Gentlemen, our guest has arrived, Jane. Excuse me. Jane. Yes, uh, gentlemen.. ...may I introduce to one and all, Ms. Jane Parker. Her mother and I were separated when she was quite young. 'That's a lie.' He left my mother a year after I was born. Ah. Six thousand miles to tell me what a bastard I am. What did mama say when you told her you were coming to Africa? Nothing. She was dead when I decided. Oh, my God. 'She had a beautiful funeral.' All her loved ones were there. 'I left a week later.' Gentlemen. Gent-gentlemen, I.. I believe the dinner is over. Ms. Parker? I think your father would be best left alone-- 'Oh, for God's sake, Holt! Get out and leave her.' Thank you. - I'm sorry. - That's all? That's all you have to say? No, no, that is not all I have to say. There are a million, trillion things I want to say but all I can say is, I loved her so. Oh! I see. That is a good reason to leave. You don't find me a very pretty sight, do you? I don't find you a pretty sight. 'Because of you, I was born.' 'But you only came to me through newspaper clippings' 'telling me how you were out trading your soul away' 'for one more grand adventure.' Mother's estate makes me very, very rich. I could buy everything you own. Buy it right out from under you. Who the bloody hell do you think you're talking to? James Parker. You are James Parker? There's not another. Like a trophy, you posed with mother and child 'and then you were gone.' Now, doesn't that make you a first-class bastard? 'But I carry that same picture.' There has not been a day in your life that I have not carried that same picture. 'She was so weak.' I mean, your conception almost killed her. 'Don't you understand that?' If I had held her too long.. ...if I had loved her too much. So frail. 'So very fragile.' God, how I loved you. Her. You loved her. Yes. Her. But you are her. I am not. How much do you hate me? I think so very, very much.  Hate...is a very strong emotion. 'It can drain one.' I know.  I wish you strength.  She didn't find me a pretty sight. And I did dress so for the occasion.  Do you think I overdressed? Goodnight, Jane Parker! 'Sleep well, Jane Parker.'   Morning. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. This should interest you. Where is this? That's the escarpment. Somewhere up there. Elephants go to die. But that's a legend. Do you believe it? I've invested all that I have to join your father on this trek. 'He's obsessed with finding it.' Look at those eyes. He's the last of a breed. 'There's so many places in this Earth still left to be explore'' 'and so few men big enough to go after them.' Your father, I think he's big enough. Do you believe it's strange risking your life just to see what's around the next corner? That's the fascinating corner. It always seems it'll be more exciting there. I know. And it is just often enough to keep you going. Bye!  Thank you! Bye-bye!   Good morning, James Parker. I did sleep well, thank you. I wished it so. - I've been thinking. - So have I. I'm going with you. Now, wait just one minute. You'll go nowhere unless I say so.  'My expedition. No, no, no.' Any expedition on this continent is no place for a woman. 'I was given this brace of pistols by' the great Buffalo Bill...himself. - Himself? - Himself. I'd like to share them with you. Is that another James Parker fib? Just a little one. Mr. Holt!   Forward! Fantastic! Oh-h! 'History must be recorded, my dear.' 'Company, forward!'       'How much further?' * Bring me my spirit * * Bring me my chariot of fire *   'I got some very good photographs today.' 'Of you as well.' 'You're very beautiful.' And very able also. Thank you. 'Ballooning over the Alps' you could live on a thrill like that for a long time. - I wish I'd made that trip. - Does it bother you that I did? - I'm sorry, I don't understand. - Of course, you do. It's a man's world. Women aren't allowed to be participants. We're here for your pleasure, not for ours. It doesn't sound as though you like us very much. I don't dislike men. I envy them. I envy your freedom. I resent not having the same.    'Watch my cannon!' 'Don't let it drown. It's a precious dear thing.' Come on. Don't lose my cannon! Come on. Come on, all of you!     'Come on, boys. Now we can stretch our legs.'          Hold it.  Shh!  Zumba! Zumba!  - Isn't that a rogue elephant? - It is. But isn't that supposed to be dangerous? It is.      Hold it! Hold it. Hold it. Look. A-a-ah! Close your eyes. Close your eyes! Come on, we play a game. Put your head down. Head down. Now. Ah! Don't look. We'll play a little game now that we didn't play when you were a child. Head down, I said. Okay. Come along very slowly. You can open your eyes now. I have got a surprise for you. - Now, keep your eyes closed. - Alright. Head down and not to look. - Head down, I said. - Alright, alright. Eyes closed. Now, I'll show you something. - Don't look up yet. - Okay. Open your eyes. Now, lift them up. Now!  'Oh, my God!' 'Ha ha. I told you. Yeah.' 'I told you it was a Goddamn big rock.' 'Oh, my God.' - 'Must be a way around it.' - 'No way.' 'It goes on forever and ever and ever and ever.' - Nothing goes on forever. - Wrong. It does and I do. We'll make camp at its base over there. 'And then, you will return with 100 of my best bearers' 'where you will report to Sir Alan on our progress.' Our remarkable progress. Along with my warmest regards. I see.  What was that? That, I believe, my dear, is Tarzan. 'What was it?' I told you. I believe it's Tarzan. But I don't know what Tarzan is. It's a great white ape, supposedly ten feet tall. A great white man, supposedly 100 feet tall. Well, it's a story. It's half man, half ape. Gigantic. White. Ha ha. Rubbish!  - They heard him. - We heard him too. They are very frightened. They'll go. Talk to them. Offer them more money. They'll go. They do not need the money that badly. Everybody needs money that badly. Parker, no one has ever returned from the escarpment. Ever. Because of that thing that cried? Oh, don't forget. That thing is 100 feet tall. Maybe 200 feet. - Are you afraid? - There is much to fear. Are you afraid, Mr. Holt? Of course, he's afraid! He's got to be afraid. That's where the bloody fun is! You are afraid, aren't you, Holt? 'You are afraid, Holt, aren't you? You are afraid.' 'Yes, you're afraid and you are alive.' Your blood is rushing through your veins. Your heart is pounding at the thought of going up there and you're more alive at this moment than you have ever been in your entire life! Because you are afraid. Yes, Holt, because you are afraid. Fear is intoxicating. 'Fear of the dark. Fear of death.' Fear of the unknown. Fear of a 500-foot-white monster. It was fear that first brought Gods into the world. Are you afraid? 'Is your heart pounding?' 'Is your blood rushing through your veins?' - 'Is it good?' - It's good. That's my girl!  'I see.' We've lost 40 but 10 might go. This is their leader, Jahmay. Why would these ten go and not the others? Their pride. They're not as superstitious as the others. They like the money. 'Well, 10 times the money then''  Oh, shut up, you boring son of a bitch! Parker, they believe in Tarzan. Then, let them find themselves a stronger damn God! Come on, Riano. Let's go talk to them again. Africa. I need bearers. Are you going to the top? I'm going, Parker. 'That's my girl.' Now, go out there and shame those bastards. 'Parker, I..' - You're a bastard. - 'Oh, I am.' 'And more.' I wallow in me. I enjoy every syllable I say and every gesture I make. I indulge myself a full 100%. 'And you take my advice, dear Jane.' 'And you do the same thing.' 'And enjoy your beautiful time on Earth.' Turn yourself into a God. And then you will not have to look for another. A Goddess? Why not? I'm going up that hill tomorrow.  Oh, no. Oh, no. You are not going up that hill tomorrow.   Bloody marvelous! My beautiful, beautiful cannon! 'James Parker!' 'Your big he-dog seems a bit intimidated by the climb.' Come on. Oliver! Oliver!   'This is the last piece of rock.' 'We've come this far without so much' 'as a bloody skinned knuckle.' 'Stay on your toes.' 'Follow me!' You're not going to beat me, you bloody rock. You're not going to beat Parker! That's it.  This bloody rock is mine! I own it!   Why did you do that?!  Why?    Wake up. Can I come in? I want to show you something quite remarkable. Alright? 'The Inland Sea, see?' 'West towards the great Inland Sea.' 'All your faith is based on this?' This and the seat of my pants. Where did you get it? In a Cairo museum. 1000 years old. An Egyptian expedition found a graveyard full of ivory near the great Inland Sea. But do you believe it's authentic? My friend in the museum thinks so. But then, he didn't believe in the seat of my pants either. Shall we go? We'll go. Let's go! Pack everything! Come on, damn it! Come on! Come on, damn it! Parker, we need to stop a while. If you need to rest, take a nap. Parker, we need to rest. Do you need a rest too, Jane? - No, no more than you. - We're stopping. I give the orders, Mr. Holt. - Well, then give them. - Mr. Holt. No photographer will tell me how to run my expedition! And you, with your long, loping legs, Christ you can take one step for every two of mine. So get your bloody ass.. Quiet!  Shh. Hear it? I bloody hear it! I knew it's got to be there! The Inland Sea. 'Come, come on.' I knew it was here. I knew it. I knew. I knew it was here. I knew it was here. I knew it. I knew it. It's beautiful! I knew it was here, Jane. It's beautiful! I knew it was here. Mr. Holt, bloody mad. The king shall dub me knight of the realm and the pope shall make me a bloody saint. 'Congratulations.' Alright, I'd like to follow the shore. Over to there. Let's go. - You go on, I'll catch up. - Jane. I'm going to take a bath. You go on. Alright then, we'll wait. I'm quite capable of taking a bath without assistance. 'I'll catch up.' Alright. Well, I'm going to that point over there. I've got a funny feeling I shall find my river. And have a nice bath. - Jane, I'd really feel much-- - Mr. Holt. She is going to have her bath no matter how you bloody feel. 'Let's go.'        Let me go! No! No! No! No! Ah-h! No! No! No!    Jane! Are you alright? Jane, are you alright? Mr. Holt, make camp. Make camp! 'Make camp!' 'Jane, do you know what he wants?' 'What this ape wants?' He's not an ape. He is an ape. He lives like an ape. 'He kills like an ape.' But do you understand what he wants? You know everything. Well, this ape son of a bitch wants you. - But he didn't hurt me. - I didn't say that. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to blow a hole in this ape. Stuff him and hang him on the wall of my club. You're not going to touch him. Because he's a man. Oh, I tell you, I'm going to have this ape son of a bitch's head as my trophy.  Mr. Holt. - Something's not right. - What's that? I don't know, but something's not right. Let's go on. Ithink you should go back and trail the end. And don't be so bloody obvious. Alright, sir.  What happened? Where's Africa?  Out of my way. Out of my way. What happened?  What happened? Tarzan.  You bastard!  You Goddamned bastard! Africa! 'Africa!' Ape or man, I'm still going to stuff him and hang him on the wall of my club.    'Hurry on! We're moving out.' But they wouldn't have killed themselves. I didn't say that. Maybe they took Africa and it wasn't Tarzan. He did. Let's go!  'May we stop, please?' 'I'd like to fill my canteen.' Absolutely. Take a 15-minute break. Holt, keep your eye on her. I'll take a look around up there. Holt, I said keep your eye on her not your bloody bearers.  Jane. Jane! Jane! Parker! Jane! Jane! Jane! - Jane! - 'Holt!' Holt, what happened? - What happened? - I don't know. She just...vanished. Wait. Stop. Please, stop. Please. Oh. Stop. Please stop. Oh, Mother of God, stop, please. Oh, no, wait. Don't go. Oh, no. Oh.     - This way. - No, it's not. It's this way.  Ah! Ah-h!            Oh, no, no, no. Don't, please. No answer. Well, maybe she's out of ammunition. Alright, we'll fire a shot every 15 minutes. Let's go.   Come here. Come here. I won't hurt you. There. There. I won't hurt you. I won't hurt Tarzan. I won't hurt him.  I won't hurt him. 'Oh, thank God.' His heart's beating strong. Alright. It's alright. Would you wet that? There. That's it. We'll make him better. He's going to be alright. Are you Tarzan? One hundred feet tall? Maybe a 1000? 'The great white ape.' 'You're just a man.' I've never touched a man before. It's nice. It's very nice. Jane, Jane, Jane. She's so goddamn beautiful. She's tough, Holt. She's tough, ah, she's tough. My girl is a tough little lady. God! I want that son of a bitch dead. 'If it's the last thing I ever do.'  You're just like a statue in a museum. But you're real. 'Oh, my God'' 'The snake bit you'' Oh, my God! You scared me. And I scared you. You don't understand a word I say, do you? What are we gonna do?       'Getting late.' - 'Should we make camp?' - Yes, yes, make camp. Mr. Holt, light a fire. A fire? Why the bloody hell didn't I think of that before? Build a fire! A large fire! Come, get sticks! 'So the whole bloody world can see it.'  Huh.     I'm so scared. God, God, God. I'm so scared. 'Damn!' 'Damn!' 'Damn!' 'I'm going to catch that animal son of a bitch, Mr. Holt!' When we get down below, we'll split up spread out and make a line. You go to my right, you to my left. I'll go through the center. We'll fire a shot every 15 minutes. It's a good plan. - I hope so. Move out! - Alright. Mr. Holt. She's alive, Mr. Holt. I know it. They're both alive.  I can do that.            Thank you. James Parker, you were wrong. I'm still a virgin. Now I don't know whether that's good...or bad. What are you? You'd have to be. I mean, there's no one. Mm-hmm. You'd have to be, wouldn't you? It's a strange problem. God, if the girls back home could see me now.   Damn. Damn. Bloody damn. I feel so strange. Like I'm reading this in a book. But I'm not. I'm really here. But I don't believe it. I don't know whether to laugh or cry or just turn to the next page. God. I sure hope it has a happy ending. Don't you know how to smile? Do you know you're more beautiful than any girl I know? Oh, you're a lot more. Come here. Come here. Come on. Here, let me show you how to smile. Oh, you think I'm gonna hurt you? There's no way I could hurt you. Come on. Here we go. Now, don't stop me. There. That's a smile. Well, it could be. But you're going to have to work on it a little. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. The chapter always ended before this part. James Parker, you might be right. He might want me. He just might. James Parker.. ...it's wicked, I know. But I hope you're right.  James Parker! He's looking for me. No, no, no. No, I need my boots. My boots.  God. If you are there.. ...I ask you. No, I-I-I beg you. Let her hear this.  Damn it. Parker! That's twice I haven't heard a second shot! Because there bloody well hasn't been one! James, I pray with every step I take. Well, I don't particularly believe in prayer. But I must confess, I said a few today. 'James Parker! James Parker!' Jane! 'I'm here! I'm here!' Jane! Jane! I'm here, I'm here! Give me that gun.  Bastard! Jane! Get out of the way! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No! 'Where's Africa?' He doesn't have Africa. 'Don't shoot!' Well, if he doesn't have Africa, who the bloody else has? He never had Africa. Don't hurt him! Please, don't hurt him..      Parker.   Stop it!  Stop! Let me go! Let me go. Let me go!   Jane. Leave here. Jane? Jane! Answer me, Jane. Damn, they're washing me just like a horse! No. Jane. Leave here! Let's just leave here. No! No! Go to the... go to the clouds, Jane. - 'Yes, go to the clouds.' - Let me go!   'They're painting me.' 'Jane.' 'They're painting my hair.' 'Jane.' - They're painting it white. - 'Jane! Jane, listen to me.' Jane, do you like merry-go-rounds? - Merry-go-rounds? - 'Yes.' 'We will take a ride on one, you and I together.' We'll bring Mr. Holt with us. Mr. Holt, you will take a ride with us on a merry-go-round. 'We will go round and round' the heavens of the Greek Gods. Jane. I see...Aphrodite. 'And she's not half as beautiful as you are.' Who do you see, Jane? Who do I see? Oh, God, who do I see? Who do I see? I see Zeus. Zeus. No, I only see them smearing me with paint. And that gigantic imbecile...looking at me.  Oh, God, tell me a story. Be a good daddy, tell me a story and make him go away. Yes, I will, Jane. I'll tell you a story. 'A story. Story. God. God.' Humpty Dumpty.. Dumpty Hump.. Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall 'Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.' All the king's horses and all the king's men could not put this bloody Humpty Dumpty together again! Oh, my God, he's coming! Now, Jane. Listen to me and listen to me well. For what I am going to tell you is the absolute truth! 'If he touches you, he is not touching you!' You are not of the flesh! You are of the spirit! That is why you must leave your body right now! 'You must leave him with nothing!' 'Oh, my God.'  'No.' A-ah! No! Parker!               Uh, uh.   And I thought I could stuff him and hang him on the wall. We'll get you out of here. Out of here? I've just bloody got here. - Are you alright? - I'm alright. Well, they certainly did a paint job on you. Good, Irish green. I like that. Jane. Look what they've done to me. Oh, God. You know.. You know, I thought I was going to live forever. I don't like that kind of talk. Oh, neither do I. The Inland Sea. The Elephants' graveyard. Oh, shh. Jane. Shh. Oh, please, please. You tell that stuffy-bloody club of mine that I did it. No, you tell them we did it. 'We did it.' Oh, God. I love you. I always have. Your life is going to be such.. ...a marvelous adventure. I envy you. Mr. Holt. Your camera. I'd like...a picture of all..   I love you too. I always have. And I always, always will. Take his picture. Will you tell them? 'I'll tell them.' Jane, I can't believe this. Mr. Holt, believe it.

A boy! (DAN) You're most welcome, Master Copperfield. You'll find us rough, but you'll find us ready. (YOUNG DAVID) Let's always be friends, Emily. (YOUNG EMILY) I'd like that, but you'll be a gentleman one day. Argh! (CREAKLE) So you like biting, do you.? (STEERFORTH) Stings, don't it.? (YOUNG DAVID) A bit. You're as fresh as a daisy. My name is Steerforth, by the way. There's no need to ""sir"" me. (CREAKLE) It grieves me to tell you that your mother is very ill She is very dangerously ill In fact, she's dead. (PEGGOTTY) Listen to me, my darling boy. Don't lose heart, and never forget how much your Peggotty loves you. (MICAWBER) I am convinced that you will, in short, go far. To Copperfield. Not just a lodger - a friend. I never will forget you. (BETSEY) You broke her heart, then punished the boy, because of your own guilt! Oh, Mr Dick. You'll consider yourself joint guardian with me of this boy. I think perhaps he should take the name Trotwood. (MR DICK) Trotwood Copperfield.! (BETSEY) Trotwood Copperfield.! Perhaps you'll be a partner in Wickfield's business one day. Oh, no, Master Copperfield. Ambition ain't for me. A person like myself had better not aspire. Do not concern yourself. I will look after him. (DAVID) As you have always done. (SPENLOW) My daughter is holding a picnic next Saturday. Perhaps you'd care to join us.? Oh... Irresistible, Mr Copperfull Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app My new life had begun. I was independent, a young man making his way in the world. But what did any of this mean without Dora.? I was determined to win her heart. I knew my happiness depended on it. Miss Spenlow. In honour of your birthday... What a dear bouquet! They're beautiful flowers, Mr Copperfield. I thought them beautiful until I saw you. Come. Join us. (DORA) # Des jeunes filles si belles # Des gar? Ons vifs et joyeux # Dansant tous ensemble tra-la-la-la-la-la # Prenez-moi la main, allons sous les arbres # Cherchons la musique, dansons avec joie # La douce nuit est tombee la lune vient de monter # Dansons dans la foret tra-la-la-la-la-la # Little had been said, but I was filled with the hope that some vital understanding had been reached between us. For the next few days, greatly to Mrs Crupp's discomfort, I lived on nothing but Dora and coffee. Skittles, Mr Copperfull When there's a young lady in the case, skittles is healthy. Diverts the mind, does you good. Oh... I satisfied my appetite by writing her numerous letters, hoping that she would detect the desperate passion that lay beneath their formal exterior. Thankfully, for my sanity, I was at last distracted by an invitation to join Agnes at a London party. Trotwood! Agnes! How wonderful to receive your invitation. We see you so rarely these days. My dear sister, I've so much to tell you about what I've been doing. Uriah. How are you? Much obliged for your condescension to an 'umble person, Master Copperfield. Take no notice of me. I am invisible. Things have changed since you left, Trotwood. Papa is to make Uriah his partner. - But he's not to be trusted! - Uriah has made himself indispensable. I have a good mind to... Promise me you'll do nothing to offend Uriah. You fell in love on the spot. More than that. I completely and utterly adore her. But what about you, Agnes? Have you no admirers to tell me about? Of course not. I have no time for anything like that. Have you seen the new play at Covent Garden? (STEERFORTH) A miserable business! (DAVID) Steerforth! You don't remember me. David Copperfield. My God! Little Copperfield! - I'm overjoyed to see you. - You haven't changed a bit, Daisy. This is Miss Wickfield, an old friend. Delighted. You have the prettiest girl in the place on your arm, Daisy. Why do you call him ""Daisy""? Merely a nickname from school You don't mind, do you, Daisy? Not in the least. I'm staying at my mother's. You must call on me. I want to know what you've been doing. I feel as though you're my property. Of all people! What luck. Sometimes it is wiser to leave the past alone. Perhaps you shouldn't go to see him. Why not? He's the best friend I ever had in the world. Going home, Master Copperfield? Indeed, Uriah. Perhaps you would care to join me for some coffee? Oh, really, Master... I mean MisterCopperfield. I'm sure you wouldn't want a 'umble person like me in your house. I wouldn't ask you if I didn't. Do you remember saying to me once that perhaps I should become a partner in Mr Wickfield's business one day? What a prophet you have shown yourself, Mr Copperfield. I don't suppose I really thought it likely. Oh, who would have? But the 'umblest persons may be the instruments of good. Mr Wickfield is the worthiest of men, but, oh, how imprudent he has been. - Has he been imprudent? - If anyone else had been in my place, Mr Wickfield would have been under his thumb by now. Without me, there would have been loss and disgrace, and Mr Wickfield knows it. Did you think Miss Agnes looked very beautiful tonight? I thought her looking as she always does, superior to everyone around her. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Why should you thank me? You will not think the worse of my 'umbleness if I make you a little confidence, Mr Copperfield? Of course not. The image of Miss Agnes has been in my breast for years. Oh, with what pure affection do I love the ground she walks on! Does she know of these feelings? Oh, no! Oh, dear, no! You see, I'm just emerging from my lowly station, but I rest my hope on my usefulness to her father. She's so much attached to him, she may come, on his account, to be kind to me. If you'll keep my secret and not go against me with my Agnes, I will take it as a particular favour. You wouldn't wish to make unpleasantness. Who knows what the consequences might be? Dear me. One o'clock. My boarding house will be locked by now. Dear Agnes. Too loving and good for anyone I could think of. Was it possible she was reserved to be the wife of such a wretch as this.? You walk at a somewhat lively pace, Mr Copperfield. I wouldn't want you to miss your coach. I'll be back with the law next time, Micawber! Mr Micawber! Open up, it's Copperfield! Mr Micawber! It's David Copperfield! (MICAWBER) Is it possible? Have I again the pleasure of beholding the infant scourge of the pawnbroking profession? Come in, come in. Mr Heep. Any friend of Copperfield's is a friend of Wilkins Micawber. (MICAWBER) My dear! There is a gentleman here who wishes to be presented to you! Copperfield, come to renew his acquaintance with you, my love. Lord, can it really be? Oh, what happy memories of my youth! Oh, here! Oh, I... You may perhaps have surmised that Mrs Micawber is in a state of health which renders it not improbable that there will be soon be an addition to the infantine group. In short, she is expecting. It is a happy event, though one that strains Mr Micawber's already depleted resources. But I know that he will, as always, rise to the challenge. We must celebrate. Will you come to dinner next week? Oh! A noble and generous proposition. If I had listened to Agnes's advice, if I had never taken up Steerforth's invitation, many honest lives would have continued untouched by tragedy. But I was blind to her wisdom then, as I was blind to so many things, and it was with nothing but joy in my heart that I went to visit my old friend at the house he shared with his mother and her companion, Rosa Dartle. James has told you he is an Oxford man now, Mr Copperfield? I am sure he will make you proud and take a high degree. My dear Daisy, I doubt whether I shall bother to take a degree at all Don't torment me, James. You know you will There is no better mind in the whole college. You must forgive Mother. She is quite horribly vain about me. But you give her every reason to be, do you not? We hardly see you, and surely that can only be because you work so hard? Ah, good, the claret. Daisy, this is Littimer, my manservant. I'm delighted to make your acquaintance, sir. I trust I find you well tonight. Very well, thank you. How will you spend your holiday, Mr Copperfield? I intend to visit my old nurse. I haven't seen her in years. Her brother lives in a boat on Yarmouth Sands. You remember him. He and his nephew visited me at Creakle's once. I think I have some recollection. Rustic types, weren't they? Their home is a magical place. You really ought to see it. Ought I? Well, why not? I have nothing else very pressing. I'll come with you. - Do you mean it? - Certainly! It might be amusing to mix with that sort of people. But do tell me. ""That sort of people"". Are they really animals and clods and beings of another order? - I would so like to know. - They're not as sensitive as we are. I dare say they are wonderfully virtuous, but their natures are very coarse. Their delicacy is not to be shocked or hurt very easily. Really? It's so consoling to find that when they suffer, they don't feel! Sometimes I have been quite uneasy for ""that sort of people"". But now I shalljust dismiss the idea of them altogether. I was fascinated by Miss Dartle, and the strange hold she had over Steerforth. Don't stop, Rosa. You haven't played for me in years. Come, Rosa. From now on we shall love each other very much. - What happened? - You have to be careful with Rosa. She is always dangerous. Have you noticed that remarkable scar on her lip? Of course. I did that. I was a young boy and she exasperated me, so I threw a hammer at her. What a promising young angel I must have been! This is delightful, Daisy. Just the tonic for a weary soul (DAVID) I don't believe you are half as jaded as you say. I don't believe you can possibly be as honest and good as you pretend. Not compared to you, at any rate. I'll see you back at the inn when you've grown tired of being cried over. Does Mr Barkis still go over to Blunderstone, ma'am? He do, but he's bad abed with the rheumatics. I want to see an old house. The Rookery, I think it's called. My darling boy! Peggotty! It's better than a pint of liniment to see you again, Master Davy. What was the name I wrote up in the cart, sir? We had some grave talks on that matter, didn't we? I was willing a long time. A long time, Mr Barkis. I don't regret it. C.P. Barkis is the usefullest and the best of women. All the praise that anyone could give C.P. Barkis she deserves, and more. I'm a poor man, sir. And I am sorry to hear it. Very poor indeed. Old clothes. I wish it was full of money, but it ain't. It's old clothes. I understand. Barkis has grown a little nearer with time. I remembered Mr Peggoty's boat as a quiet, homely place, but as Steerforth and I approached, it soon became clear that this was no ordinary night. (SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER FROM INSIDE) (DAN) This is the happiest day of my life! Master Davy, it's Master Davy! (HAM) Master Davy! (DAN) Davy boy! Mr Peggotty, this is Steerforth, an old friend from school - You don't look a day older. - Good to see you after so long. Why that you two should come to this here roof tonight of all nights of my life. What do you think, then? What do you think? Only that this girl, who I brought up from a baby, and loved better than a daughter, only that she's going to be married! Emily! My warmest congratulations. And who is the lucky fellow? - Ham! - Who else but Ham? Two years past, he asked her and she comes to me and says she couldn't have him. ""Him that I've known so intimately all my life,"" she says. ""And loved like a brother, I can never have him."" And that was the end of it. Until tonight, when he comes crying out to me alljoyful, ""She'll be my wife!"" And she says, ""Yes, uncle. I've changed me mind, if you please."" If I please! I'd lay down my life for Emily. She's all to me that ever I can want. There ain't a gentlemen in all the land, nor yet sailing upon the sea, that can love his lady more than I love her. Ham. I give you joy. May you always be as happy as you are tonight. (STEERFORTH) He's a chuckle-headed type for the girl You're not with Miss Dartle now, Steerforth. I could see for myself how much you liked him. You see clean through me, Daisy. I am defenceless against you. Thank you. Emily! I'm not good enough for Ham. I'm cross and changeable with him when he is never so to me. Why am I so often harsh when all I should think of is making him happy? You do make him happy. Anyone can see that. It would have been better if he'd found someone else. Ham would rather die than be with anyone but you. Don't say that! I'm not worthy of him! I should be a hundred times more thankful for his goodness. I should feel what a blessed thing it is to be the wife of a good man and to lead a peaceful life. Once you are married, all these worries and fears will fall away. - What do you think of her, Daisy? - She's handsome enough. Why? I've just bought her. - But you might never come back. - I don't know about that. I find I've taken a fancy to the place. She must be newly-rigged, though. I'm leaving Littimer behind to see it done. I've decided to give her a new name - ""The Little Em'ly"". (DAVID) All she ever wanted was to love and be loved in return. Think on the happy times, Davy. Not what came after. I felt many emotions as I lingered by my mother's grave, but it was the thought of Dora that stirred me from my melancholy. Reflecting on the past, I knew with certainty that my future lay with her and that I could not rest until I had declared myself. If your poor mother could see you now, she'd be that vain her pretty head would be completely turned. Goodbye, Peggotty. When I come back, I'll have important news for you. - What news? - I'm going to be married. Only the lady in question doesn't know it yet. - Who is she? - Dora. Her name's Dora! My darling boy! (COACHMAN) Go on! Steerforth? I wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years. I wish with all my soul I had been better guided. I wish I could guide myself better. - What do you mean? - Nothing, Daisy, nothing. I am bad company for myself sometimes, that is all If anything should ever separate us, you must promise me that you'll think of me at my best. - Will you do that? - Why should we ever be separated? Just promise me, can't you? Remember me at my best. Never more would I touch his hand in friendship, never more hear his laughter or feel the warmth of his companionship. May God forgive you, Steerforth. I cannot. My dear Copperfield! This is luxurious. A way of life which reminds me of a period when I was myself a bachelor. Happy days, now, alas, gone forever. - Micawber! Have I deserved this? - Deserved what? - You wish that we had never married. - My love! This is my reward, Mr Copperfield! - I who will never desert him! - Forgive me, Emma! I am a wife and mother, and I swear I never will desert him. My dear, no one is urging you to do anything of the sort, least of all me. - You don't regret our nuptial vows, then? - Impossible! Unthinkable! Oh... - Sit down, my dear. - Yes. Ah! Shall I do the honours, Copperfield? Are you aware, Mr Copperfield, that we are shortly to leave the metropolis to cast our lot among strangers? In short, Copperfield, something has at last turned up. Where? I have recently entered into arrangements by virtue of which I stand pledged and contracted as a confidential clerk to a mutual friend. Heep. A man of remarkable shrewdness and perspicacity. I am convinced Micawber will flourish in a situation so suited to his fertile resources. I am sure he will be a judge, or even a chancellor, one day. To Copperfield, the companion of my youth. And to Heep, my friend and protector. The time had come to know my fate. I called on Dora at the first opportunity. Happiness or misery was now the question, and only she could give the answer to it. Be quiet, you naughty boy! I came here today to tell you... Jip! Quiet, please! - I came here today to tell you... - Jip, come back here! Bad boy! Mr Copperfield! I came here today to tell you that I love you. I have loved you since the first moment I saw you and I will always love you. - We hardly know each other! - One minute was enough. I love you, Dora. With all my heart. Forgive me. I shall go now. Please don't. Dora... Aunt! Mr Dick! I'm ruined. Betsey Trotwood - I don't mean your sister, Trot, but myself - had a certain property and for years that property did pretty well and returned good interest. But her man of business, being no longer the man of business he once was, she took it into her head to remove it from his hands and invest it for herself. First, she lost it in the mining way. Then she lost it in the shipping and banking way. And finally, she lost the lot. And the least said about it, soonest mended. - Is Mr Wickfield to blame for this? - The blame is entirely my own. Well, the cottage is let at 70 pounds per annum, which is all which we have to live on. So here we are, my dear Trot. And you haven't a penny in the world! What do you have to say to that? You know I've often thought about writing. Mm? I could work in the mornings before I go to Doctor's Commons. - And I have 100 pounds a year. - Which you should keep for yourself. - We must meet our reverses boldly. - Boldly! Boldly. And not suffer them to frighten us. We shall act the play out and live misfortune down! - A beggar? Love a beggar? - I am now a beggar. How can you be such a silly thing and sit there telling stories? - I'll make Jip bite you. - This must be our secret for now. I cannot speak to Mr Spenlow about our engagement until I've begun to make my fortune. A secret engagement? How romantic, Doady! When we are married, if our income is to be small, we must try to be practical Please don't be practical because it frightens me so. If you will sometimes look at your papa's housekeeping and perhaps study cookery... You are determined to frighten me out of my wits! With perseverance and strength of character, we can bear anything. But I haven't got any strength. Have I, Jip? Oh, do kiss Jip and stop being so disagreeable. Jip will have to wait his turn. I will feel happier when I've spoken to Mr Wickfield about our situation. And no doubt you will be glad of an excuse to see Agnes. I can't feel comfortable until I know her opinion of my engagement to Dora. Oh. So you imagine yourself in love, do you? Imagine? Yes, I suppose you think you were made for each other, and are to go through a children's party kind of life like two pretty pieces of confectionary! Blind, Trot, blind! We are young and inexperienced, I know, but we love one another truly. And she's neither silly nor light-headed, I suppose? Dora is fascinating and sweet and beautiful Blind, Trot, blind. Returning to Canterbury, I felt Agnes's gentle influence reaching out to me. It seemed to pervade even the city in which she dwelt. Yet as I approached Mr Wickfield's house, my happiness gave way to a growing sense of dread about what I might find within. This is a bad business of your aunt. I came here to discover if anything might be done. Nothing, Mr Copperfield, nothing at all It's all gone and no one is to blame but herself. She has been very reckless. Isn't that right, Mr Wickfield? Quite right. You'll stay with us, Trotwood, while you remain in Canterbury? Uriah is a great relief to me. It's a load of my mind to have such a partner. My dear Copperfield! So how do you like the law, Mr Micawber? It is a great pursuit, sir. To a man of higher imaginative powers such as myself, it is perhaps over-reliant on detail A mind is not at liberty to soar to any exalted forms of expression. Still, it is a great pursuit. Do you see much of Mr Wickfield? Mr Wickfield is a man of very excellent qualities... ...but he is, in short, obsolete. I am afraid his partner seeks to make him so. My dear Copperfield. I am here in the capacity of confidence and trust. The discussion of some topics, even with Mrs Micawber herself, is incompatible with the functions now devolving upon me. Do not ask, 'umble as I am, to speak of the affairs of my friend Heep. Wouldn't you say my Ury is quite the gentleman these days, sir? Indeed, Mrs Heep. How long has she been living here? - Months. - Does she never leave you alone? It is certainly difficult to avoid her company. My dear sister. I have missed you so much lately. I wanted to talk to you about Dora. We are to be married. She is the most wonderful girl in the world and I know that you will come to love her as well as I do. How could I not love anyone who thinks so much of you? Promise not to abandon me when I become an old, married man. You know how I rely on you. It is Dora you must rely on now. Of course. I will always be your devoted friend and sister, Trot. Wherever our separate paths may lead us, you may rely on that. (AGNES) Shall we retire, Mrs Heep? Father, go to bed soon. I'll give you a toast, gentlemen. To the divinest of her sex. I'm a 'umble individual to give you her health, but I do admire, no, adore her. Choose some other toast, Uriah. Agnes Wickfield, the divinest of her sex. Who else can propose it if not the man who would be her husband? Never! Never! Have you gone mad, Wickfield? I have as good a right to her as any other man. I have a better right than any other man. Look at my torturer. Always at my elbow, whispering his venom. In my house, in my business... Like a millstone around my neck, bringing me to my ruin! Take care, Wickfield! Without me you would have no house or business, nor reputation. Your safety is in my hands, remember? Oh, what have I come to, Trotwood? My weak indulgence has ruined me. God knows what I have done in my misery of oblivion! Have you ever picked a pear before it was ripe, Mr Copperfield? What? I did that when I spoke of Miss Agnes. But the pear will ripen yet. I can wait. There must be two parties to a quarrel, Copperfield. And I won't be one. - Father is quite recovered. - Is there nothing that can be done? His first words when he woke were to send apologies to Uriah. - He is more in his power than ever. - Promise me one thing. Promise me you will never sacrifice yourself to a mistaken sense of duty. Agnes, you can't be considering marriage to that... ...reptile! Goodbye, Trotwood. My return to London was tormented by thoughts of the fate that lay in wait for Agnes. Little now stood between Heep and the final success of his scheming. It was with a heavy heart that I made my way to Mr Spenlow's office at the Doctor's Commons, only to find that a further catastrophe awaited. You have abused my confidence and committed a dishonourable action! - I love Dora to such an extent... - Miss Spenlow, if you please! And I beg that you won't speak to me of love or engagements. My daughter is not to be thrown away on a clerk! Now let there be an end to this nonsense. Take these letters away and throw them on the fire. You must forget her, Mr Copperfield! Soon after this disastrous encounter, a letter arrived from Peggotty informing me that Barkis was in a very poor way and she feared he would soon be making his final journey. I resolved to go to Yarmouth immediately, though not before attending to the matter closest to my heart. I'll never give Dora up and the sooner Mr Spenlow knows that, the better. I'll see him this morning on my way down. Mr Spenlow? Mr Spenlow? Mr Spenlow's death from a heart seizure threw everything into confusion. I was desperate to see Dora, but she blamed her attachment to me for her papa's untimely end. She cannot see you, Mr Copperfield. The floodgates of sorrow are open and her grief is not to be assuaged. If I could just send her a note or a token of my sympathy... Powerless to do anything for Dora, I finally made my way to Yarmouth. - How is he, Peggotty? - He is fading fast. This is kind of you, Master Davy. Uncommon kind. Barkis, my dear. Here's Master Davy, who brought us together! Old clothes! Old clothes... He's going out with the tide. People can't die along the coast, except when the tide's pretty nigh out. Barkis, my dear. C.P. Barkis. No better woman anywhere. Barkis is willing. I have looked over Mr Barkis's will and opened the box. - There was over 3,000 pounds inside. He leaves the interest on 1,000 to Mr Peggotty and the rest goes to you. Not bad for old clothes! Mr Littimer! I ain't a person to live with them as has had money left. Things go too contrary with me. I had better be a riddance. How should I spend it without you? Don't I want you now more than ever? I know'd I was never wanted before, and now I'm told so! How could I expect to be wanted, being so lone and lorn? Lord! Master Davy? Will you step outside for a minute? I would have died for her. I'd die for her now! She's gone, Master Davy. Emily's gone. And not alone. How am I ever to break it to him? When? How did this happen? Read it, sir. Slow, please, so I can take it all in. ""When you, who loved me so much better than I deserved, see this, ""I shall be far away, never to return, unless he brings me back a lady. ""Try to think as if I died when I was little, and was buried somewhere."" She begs forgiveness and tells Ham to find another more worthy of him. Who's the man? I want to know his name! It ain't no fault of yours. You couldn't have known. The servant was seen with our poor girl last night. He's been hiding about here this week or more. He was out this afternoon on the Norwich road, only now his master was with him. Steerforth? No, no! He couldn't! I knew in my heart she didn't love me like I loved her. If I hadn't pressed my affections on her, she might have come to me in the old friendly way and told me what was struggling in her mind. I might have saved her. You are not to blame, Ham. Never think that. I'll take care of Ham, my love. Don't you worry yourself about that. My duty here is done. I'm going to seek my niece. That's my duty now. Why do you come here. What do you want of me? I want to know if he will do as he promised and marry her. Impossible. A marriage to someone so far below him would destroy his career and ruin his prospects. It will never happen. If there is any other compensation... You offer me money as compensation for my niece's disgrace and ruin? What compensation can you make for opening a pit between me and my son? What is your love to mine? What is your separation to ours? My son has been the object of my life. My every thought has been devoted to him, his every wish indulged. And now he takes up with a miserable beggar girl and repays my devotion with deception. You speak of your injury? I come here with no hope, and I take none away. Good day, ma'am. You do well to bring him here! He's deeply injured, though you don't seem to know it. I would have his house torn down and see her branded on the face! If I could hunt her to the grave, I would do it. Chances are they're in foreign parts by now. The sooner I go, the quicker I'll find them. You know where I may be reached. Look out for yourself, old girl I've got my garden and a little money now, Dan. Don't worry about me. If any hurt should come to me, remember the last words I left for my child were ""love"" and ""forgiveness"". Aunt! You remember Peggotty? For the love of God, don't call her by that South Sea island name! She married, didn't she? What is your name now, Pegg...? Barkis, ma'am. You see, that's human. It sounds less as if you needed a missionary. We are older than we were, I see. How are you, Barkis? I am heartily sorry for your loss. Thank you, ma'am. I'm quite well Oh, yes! Yes, Mr Dick. It came from Doctor's Commons while you were away, Trot. The firm has collapsed with heavy debts. Mr Spenlow was bankrupt. There is nothing left. Does this mean Miss Spenlow is destitute? - I must go to her. - Oh, Trot! Oh, Mr Dick! Shh... That's all right. It's all right. I shall take care of you now. You are still mine, aren't you, Dora? Of course I am! It's just that I am so frightened! There's no need to be afraid. But we have nothing! We have everything. I took with fear and trembling to authorship. I wrote a little something and sent it to a magazine. It was published. I wrote more and quickly began to make a steady income, enough for Dora and I to contemplate the future with optimism. (COACHMAN) Whoa! I have forgotten what relation Agnes is to you, Doady. No blood relation, but we were brought up like brother and sister. Dora. Agnes is so warm and kind. I was quite frightened of her before, but now I feel so calm and peaceful in her company. I wonder that you ever fell in love with me. How could I see you and not love you? Don't you think that if I had been her friend a long time ago, I might perhaps have been more clever? You would prefer me if I was, wouldn't you? - What nonsense! - Is it, Doady? Are you sure? And so we were married. The bridesmaids were gone and the celebrations were over, and Dora and I were left alone at last. Are you happy now, you foolish boy? But Doady, what shall I do with this? Jump, Jip. My love, do you think Mary Anne has any idea of time? - Why, Doady? - Dinner should be at five. It is now six. I doubt whether two young birds could have known less about keeping house than I and my pretty wife did, for the same thing happened again and again. - Don't! - Why not? - She looks so tired, poor thing. - Tired? She's drunk! But she has so many children, who are a great trial to her. - Would you carve, Mr Micawber? - No, no, no. My pride at hosting our first dinner together knew no limits, but alas, the outcome was not the triumph I had anticipated. Mutton should always be rare. Perhaps we should start with the oysters. I'm afraid there's something the matter with them. They don't seem right. There's nothing wrong. Capital oysters, in fact. Only, they have never been opened. All that is required for a delightful repast is an oyster knife. (MICAWBER) No? No matter. How does Micawber seem to you, Mr Copperfield? A little subdued, perhaps. He is entirely reserved. He is secret. He has become severe to his children and even looks with an eye of coldness on the unoffending little stranger recently added to our familial circle. It's hard to bear. Mr Micawber is not the same since he fell in with Uriah Heep! Erm... Soup, perhaps? Soup? Oh, dear... (BETSEY) You must have patience with her, Trot. Just a few words here and there. Teach her a little firmness, you mean? Don't ask me such a thing, Trot. The outcome would only be failure, misery for Dora, and division between us. (BETSEY) Judge her by the qualities she has, not by those she lacks. I was content to heed my aunt's advice, but the happiness I had once anticipated for myself eluded me, and there was always something wanting. I had no equal partner in the toils and cares of our life. Yet my decision to adapt myself to Dora made our second year much happier than our first, and when I learnt that she was expecting a child, it seemed our joy might yet be complete. But already, dark clouds had begun to gather around us. You may go up now. She's resting. She might still have a child one day? Your wife is very weak, Mr Copperfield. When I can run about again, I shall make Jip race with me. You are getting quite slow and lazy. He has a worse disorder than laziness, my dear. Age. Oh, poor Jip! How strange that he should be old. Even little Jip. Let Jip have his rest. I'll give you another dog to race with. Oh, I couldn't have any other dog. You are not so old, Jip, are you, that you'll leave your mistress yet? We may still keep each other company a little longer. We shall both be running about again soon, as we used to do. Anxious as I was about Dora, I never forgot Dan Peggotty, who travelled restlessly across Europe, never wavering in the certainty that he would find his niece. - How long is it since your return? - A month. And still no news? If she were ever to leave him, London is where she'd come to lose herself. These are the places I must look for her now. Emily? Emily! If you need me, sir, send word here. Many a time in me sleep, I heard her cry out, ""Uncle!"" And fall like death before me. Many a time I raised her up and whispered to her, ""Emily, my dear. I am come for to bring forgiveness, ""and to take you home."" I sent for you because there is news. She has run away. Tell him what you know. Mr Steerforth and myself have been abroad with the young woman ever since she left Yarmouth under his protection. She was much admired wherever we went. The whole thing lasted longer than anyone might have expected, but, at last, Mr Steerforth grew restless and charged me with breaking the news to the young woman that he was gone. Mr Steerforth proposed that the young woman should marry a very respectable person who was fully prepared to overlook the past. - You! - Her conduct was surprisingly bad. - She showed no gratitude at all - Get him out of here. This low girl he picked out of the tide mud may be dead. If not, it is in both our interests that she be found. She must not be allowed to prey on him again. You wrong her most grievously. Is he informed of everything, Rosa? Then there is nothing else to detain you here, Mr Copperfield. I am told you have some reputation as a writer now. I find my name connected with a little praise. It is a pity you have no mother. She would have been proud of you. Do you mind if I say something very, very silly? More than usual, I mean. I feel so foolish sitting here quite idle. I want to do something to help while you are so industrious. Please. Let me hold the pens for you. Thank you, sir. Stop here! Go to the inn in Buckingham Street and ask for a Mr Peggotty. Bring him here in ten minutes and I will double it. (EMILY)... it was before I turned my back on everyone I ever loved! (ROSA) Your home? Do you think I care about your home? You were bought and sold like any other commodity your people deal in. - Say anything you like... - (DAVID) Emily! (EMILY) I believed him, loved him! - (DAN) Master Davey, where are you.? - She dares to speak of her love! - Emily! Oh, my girl! - Uncle! Tell this piece of pollution to hide herself beyond reach or to seek some obscure death. If she is still here tomorrow, I will see her whipped. Nobody is going to say a cruel word about my darling again. We'll go where nobody knows us, to the ends of the earth if we have to. Mr Peggotty resolved that they must start a new life in Australia. Knowing that she would never again return to her home, Emily begged me to take a letter to Ham. I solemnly accepted her commission, but on my arrival in Yarmouth, I found the town deserted and a dreadful storm raging. - What's going on? - A clipper from Spain has foundered! She's breaking up! - Davy! - Is there nothing can be done? - (PEGGOTTY) It's too dangerous! - God have mercy on his soul It's Steerforth! For God's sake, Ham, don't go in there. I can't stand by and watch a man drown. It's Steerforth! (PEGGOTTY) Ham! No! Please don't go! (PEGGOTTY) Ham! (PEGGOTTY) Ham! (PEGGOTTY) Ham! (PEGGOTTY) He's reached him! Pull them in! Pull! (DAVID) Pull! Pull! (DAVID) Pull harder! Haul them in! For God's sake, pull! Pull harder! (DAVID) Ham! Ham! HAM!! The other's come ashore, sir. Dead? In Yarmouth? (DAVID) No one will ever know why he was there. I can only hope that he came to make amends to Emily and her family. (ROSA) Why did you not forgive him? Look at your dead child's handiwork. Your pampering of his pride and passion did this! - Look and cry for what you made him. - Miss Dartle! I will speak! I could have loved him and asked for no return. I would have been his slave for one kind word a year. Your love was proud and selfish! At least show some feeling for a mother's grief. Who feels for me? There, there. Hush. Hush. It was an evil hour he ever brought you to this house. Is there something wrong, Doady? No, I'm fine. Nothing at all Mr Micawber. I put my hand in no man's hand, until I have blown to fragments that detestable serpent Heep! You must go to Canterbury, Doady. If you don't I shall be very cross and disagreeable and make Jip bark at you. Trot can go. I shall stay here. Why shouldn't you both go? I have Peggotty now. I'm not so very ill, am I? - No, of course not! - What a question! Well, then. You must go, or I shall begin to think I'm really ill and cry all day! - Is Miss Trotwood with you? - She is on her way. Everything is prepared, Copperfield. Well, I am sure, this is an unexpected pleasure! Don't wait, Micawber. Go along. I'll talk to you presently. If there is a scoundrel on this earth with whom I have already talked too much, that scoundrel's name is Heep! Oh, I see it now... This is a conspiracy. You have corrupted my clerk. Deal with him as he deserves, Mr Micawber. - Ury... - Hold your tongue, Mother. They'll gain nothing listening to this pompous fool Approach me again, you heap of infamy, and it will be your head. Chair! This scoundrel, Heep, employed me in the belief that I shared the baseness of his nature. I found my services constantly required for the falsification of business and the mystification of Mr Wickfield. Ask this wretch, Heep, if you will, who lives in his house after him. You do, you imbecile. Ask him if he kept a pocket book of his transactions in that house which he later tried to burn? Ury, be 'umble and make terms, my dear! This villain, Heep, tricked the honourable Mr W. Into believing that he had withdrawn a sum from Miss Trotwood's trust fund, namely 12,000 pounds. Which, in truth, Heep took out himself with a forged signature. Ever since, he has used this supposed criminal act to torture, constrain and bend him to his will Proof of all this lies within, madam. In short, Mr Wickfield has been for years deluded and plundered in every conceivable way to the financial advantage of the avaricious, false and grasping Heep! No, my son will be 'umble, Mr Copperfield, if you willjust give him time to think. Where is my property? Blame Mr Wickfield for mishandling it, would you? I should have guessed all along that you were responsible for my ruin! Your money is quite safe, Aunt. I only took her money to ruin you, Copperfield. I have always hated you. You've always been against me and my love for Agnes. Love? Your selfish, grasping desire would have forced me into a marriage I didn't want, and you talk about love. - Mr Dick? - Yes. Will you go around to the Guildhall and bring a couple of officers? I shall return post-haste with the forces of the law. - Shall I go now? - Post-haste, Mr Dick. Running is futile. You have nowhere to go. I shall send for my family immediately. The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs Micawber and myself is now withdrawn. And my children and the author of their being can once more meet on equal terms. Mr Micawber. It seems you are in need of a fresh start. Indeed, madam. I wonder if you have ever turned your mind to emigration? It was the dream of my youth. Why not go now? Capital, madam, or rather the lack of it, is the issue. You have done us a great service. What if we were to find you the capital in return? I could not take it as a gift. But if a sufficient sum could be advanced at five per cent per annum... It shall be done in any way you wish. One question arises. Are the circumstance of the country such that a man of Micawber's abilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social scale? I will not say, ""Might he aspire to be Governor?"" at present... - There is no better opening anywhere. - No better. No better. Then it is evident that Australia is the legitimate sphere of action for him! Passage was booked for the Micawbers and suddenly it was time to say farewell (DAVID) Mr Micawber? You look very well equipped, Mr Micawber. We have abandoned the luxuries of the old country, Copperfield. Forest dwellers such as ourselves cannot expect to participate in the refinements of the land of the free. I am sure there are towns of some description in Australia, but I feel it wise to be prepared. - Wilkins Micawber? - Yes. I have a warrant for your arrest on a matter of non-payment of certain outstanding bills. All hope is extinguished! Convey my family to the workhouse and forget that a being such as I ever lived. - We shall never leave without you! - What is the value of the bills? Nine pounds, nineteen shillings and sixpence. Ha! A mere trifle. (MICAWBER) A noble gesture, ma'am, that will be repaid, with interest. Thank you, ma'am. Copperfield. The time has come for us to take our leave. - There will be no speeches on my part. - I don't believe a word of it. I say, there will be no speeches from me. Only, in short... ...farewell, old friend. God go with you, Mr Micawber. God go with all of you. (MICAWBER) Come on, we must board. (MR DICK) Bye! - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye! Thank you! Mr Micawber and his family were not alone on their journey that day. The time had also come to say goodbye to other old friends. Fearful for Emily's health, Peggotty insisted that the news of Ham's death should be kept from her until she was stronger. We'll start a new life together. It is so good to see you well again. When you gave Ham my letter, did he say anything? His love is with you always. And forgiveness? Did he send forgiveness? With all his heart. I did ask this one to come with us, but you see, she's that fond of you and your, Master Davy, that it wouldn't be hardly fair to let her go. I told him straight out, ""My place is here now, Davy."" (STEWARD) Passengers on board! Will I ever see my little boy again? Be 'umble, Ury, as you always was! I was dreaming a moment ago. I thought we were in the park again. Walking together arm in arm. It was so pleasant. I am quite sad to wake up. Don't be sad. We'll go there again soon. Doady, dear. I am afraid I was too young to be married. Don't say such things. I was such a silly little creature. I think it might have been better if we had only loved each other as boy and girl, and then forgotten it. I don't think I was fit to be a wife. - As fit as I to be a husband. - Perhaps. But you are clever... ...and I never was, and never could be. We have been happy, Dora. Very happy. But as the years went on, you would have wearied of your little wife. I would have tried, and disappointed you. And you might not have been able to love me half so well as now. Do not speak to me so. Every word seems a reproach. I love you too much for reproachful words. It's the only merit I have, except being pretty. Oh, how my poor boy cries. Will you ask Agnes to come up, Doady? I want to speak to her quite alone. Don't cry, Doady. It is better as it is. Not tonight, Jip. Not tonight. I went as far away as I could, not knowing, even then, how great the shock was that I had to bear. A long and gloomy night gathered about me, haunted by the ghosts of many hopes, many errors, many sorrows and regrets. Agnes wrote to me often. She gave me no advice, she urged no duty on me. She only told me what her trust in me was, how a nature such as mine would turn affliction to good. But I mourned for Dora, taken so young from the world she loved. For Steerforth, who might have won the love and admiration of thousands as all those years ago he had won mine. And for broken- hearted Ham, who found peace at last in the stormy sea. I worked early and late, patiently and hard, until my first book was finished. It was published and was successful I began another immediately. Three years passed in this way. I might have gone on the same forever, but one day I looked up from my work and suddenly I knew it was time to return. It was as though I could hear a voice calling me home. Agnes's voice. Thank you, Peggotty. What will you do now, Trot? I thought I might ride over to Canterbury tomorrow. - Is Mr Wickfield well. - A better man in all respects. A reclaimed man. - And Agnes? - As good and beautiful as always. Has she any admirers? Dozens. D-d-dozens. - But is anyone worthy of her? - I suspect she has an attachment. I think she is going to be married. (AGNES) Will you go away again.? (DAVID) Perhaps. There is little enough to hold me here. You have a secret. Let me share it. - A secret? - There is someone close to your heart. My aunt told me. Confide in me. Let me be your friend and brother in this as in so many other things. - What have I done? - I am not myself. Don't speak to me now. We'll talk later. If you have a burden, let me lighten it. I must go. If you have a lover, you can tell me. The attachment I have is not a new one. It is not what you suppose. I cannot reveal it! It has long been mine and must remain mine. Agnes... You love me? I have loved you all my life. - For God's sake, let me go. - What have I ever been without you? - You mean as a sister? - No. Much more than that. I went away loving you, I stayed away loving you, and I have returned home loving you. Do you remember how Dora sent for me the night that she died? She made me promise something to her. What was it? She told me that only I could occupy this empty space in your heart. Trotwood! We have a visitor. Maybe things were a little hard at first, but what with sheep farming and one thing and another, we are as well to do as well could be. And Emily? She might have married any number of times. ""But Uncle,"" she says to me, ""that's gone forever."" That's my Emily. There's happy news of someone else you might recall, sir. ""Mr Wilkins Micawber, magistrate, writer, famed public orator, ""and manager of the Port Middlebay Bank, ""was fted at a public dinner this Thursday last. ""Far be it from us to follow our distinguished townsman ""through the smoothly-flowing periods of his polished and highly ornate address!"" ...and the Lord Chancellor turned to me and said, ""By God, Micawber, you're right. The law must be changed."" ""It was a masterpiece of eloquence, ""and those passages in which he traced his own brilliantly successful career, ""with particular emphasis on the importance ""of avoiding pecuniary liabilities at all costs, ""brought a tear to the manliest eye present."" I would like to introduce you to the greatest person I have ever known. My lovely wife, Emma. And so my story draws to its close. There was a night much like this many years ago, Trot. Except perhaps for one more item that demands to be recorded. Our first two children had been boys. It's a girl A beautiful little girl She shall be called Betsey Trotwood Copperfield in honour of her godmother. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Oh, the Queen! Where's the Queen? The Queen is gone! Cleopatra! Cleopatra's gone! What on earth do you mean? Pothinos. Here is your new kingdom, Cleopatra. Here you can command the asps and scorpions of the desert. Maybe they will bow low and whisper ""Majesty. "" If my hands were free, I'd kill you. But I am more kind. I leave you this mighty schoolmaster. Set him free. Apollodorus. With his help, you might reach Syria over there. And the way to Egypt? Is death. Set foot in Alexandria again, and I'll kill you. I have heard that Caesar comes to Alexandria, Prime Minister. I'm returning to meet with Caesar, Philosopher. Goodbye, Cleopatra, Queen of the Desert. You'll find, to your sorrow, I'm still Queen of Egypt. Untie me. You understand, my Queen, he returns to meet with Caesar. Is this a time to talk of Romans? I've had no breakfast. I'm hungry. So is Caesar hungry. For Egypt. You see how wise your father was... to make Rome the protector of you and your brother, King Ptolemy? They've got you out of the way to deal with your brother alone. They can handle him. I'll get back to Alexandria. Majesty, it's death. It's certain death to go. How old is this Caesar? I am told you have arrived at a conclusion, Caesar. I have. Is it your judgment to support the cause of Ptolemy or his sister? Your young King Ptolemy has raised an army... to crush his sister, Queen Cleopatra. It must be disbanded. As the general of that army, suppose I refuse? Well, we'll go into that if you do, but I don't think you will. Good model. Build it. By what authority do you judge the destiny of Egypt? I am here to see that there is peace in Egypt. With a Roman army waiting at the border? Excellence, would you not enter into a treaty with the King... if the Queen has disappeared? Has she? Rumor says that Cleopatra has fled to Syria. She must have. She's not here. Maybe she was assisted in her flight. Who can tell? Who can tell? Well, from what I hear of her, small loss to Egypt. In such a case, your king would be sole ruler. Under Roman guidance. And you would pay to Rome each year one million denarii. One million denarii! One million denarii! And 10 shiploads of Egyptian corn for the unemployed in Rome. Ten ships of corn. Ten thousand votes in Rome for Caesar. A hundred thousand maybe. Who can tell? Well, I'm waiting. Agreed. Let him sign it. A letter. Julius Caesar to the Senate, Rome. A rug of Persia. A gift for Caesar from Nahigian the merchant. We give nothing to Romans here. Did you say for Caesar? Pass on. What do you think you own, the Earth? Yes. And we have made a settlement with Egypt whereby we support young Ptolemy as King. Your seal, Excellence. Against the sedition of his sister, Cleopatra... who, by all reports, has fled to Syria. A gift for Caesar, fit even for his eyes. Thanks. Give him something. The wax is ready for your seal, Caesar. The rug, Excellence. Will you receive it? What? Yes, yes, put it down. Excellence, the wax is cooling. Observe, Caesar. A most unusual design. What? Well! Greetings to Caesar from Egypt. A very amusing joke. Very good. But I'm too busy. Huh? What's the matter? Tell him, Pothinos. Tell him what's the matter, if your lying tongue can find the words. I am Cleopatra. Huh? Yes, a good joke. She is Cleopatra, and I am Caesar. Come on. I'll take her away. No, you won't. Enough of this. Caesar, you must listen. He abducted me to the desert and left me there to die. But nothing could stop me from greeting you. Are you to be fooled by a... No, I am not to be fooled. It's dangerous to lie to me, Pothinos. But, Caesar, I thought it would be best all around if she... Then you did lie to me. So you would match wits with Caesar? Oh, no. All right, run along now. The seal, Caesar. Not yet. This quarrel with your brother will be settled in Rome. That's all. Withdraw. Come, Majesty. Enough. Before I go, one word more? Well? Well? It seems strange to see you working. I've always pictured you either fighting or loving. Well, I have had some experience with fighting. But none with loving, I suppose. Well, none with pretty little queens. Oh. That was nice. And now, with your permission, I'll go to work again. The dispatches from Gaul. What... Oh, run along. If I leave you now, I'll be killed. Pothinos has sworn to kill me. Pothinos has said that if I ever set foot in Alexandria again, he'd kill me. The map of Gaul. Well! He usually does those things, you know. Can't you see I'm busy? India. Of course. Of course I know you're very busy... but I thought you might like to talk about India. What? What about India? It's the treasure house of the East. With enough gold to... Oh, but you're much too busy. We'll talk about it tomorrow. If I'm still alive. What about India? Well, the road to India lies through Egypt. And the Queen of Egypt, allied with Caesar could... Why didn't you say that right away? My tongue was bewitched by Caesar. The man in you seems even mightier than the general. Egypt. Sit down. Pretty girl. Charming. Now. Now, what do you know of India? Oh, nothing much. Ah. But its gold would pay Caesar's legions for a century. Well! Now that's something to talk about. Yes, but not here. Come to my chambers and dine. We'll make such plans. Are your plans for India or me? Both. Shouldn't a queen choose for her confidant a king? The word ""king"" is not well-liked in Rome. Caesar takes what he wants. Flavius. My own guard for the Queen's safety. I had to walk miles across the desert to the sea... to find the fishing boat that brought me to you. But just seeing you is magic, immortal Caesar. That's quite a speech. Your tongue is no longer bewitched by Caesar, eh? No. It's my heart now. That's strange, too. I've never loved before. Love? If you'd bring true the dreams of empire that fill your pretty head... leave love alone. I can't. It's too late. Ah. It's too late. Will you do something that will make me very happy? I am here to make you very happy. Then drive Pothinos out of Egypt. Drive him? Where? Into the desert where he drove me. No. I came to talk of India, not the quarrels of Egypt. But I am Egypt. If I make you so. I was wrong. Let's not talk at all tonight. Perhaps there's nothing to talk about, ever. You don't trust me? No. And if I said I really love you, you wouldn't believe me? No. And if I implored you to marry me, you wouldn't? I'd have to ask my wife in Rome. As if you'd care about that. Divorce her. Together we could conquer the world. Nice of you to include me. I will be Caesar's wife and ally. You rate yourself highly, my child. So a woman isn't strong enough to help the mighty Caesar? Caesar. Have you ever thought what your life is worth? Well, it's worth a great deal to me. It must be worth a great deal to others. Mine is. And I'm only the Queen of Egypt... while Caesar, if he lives, will be Emperor of the world. If he lives? Life is a precious thing, isn't it? I think so. Hadn't you better put that javelin down? And if a man swears to take the life of another... death is justice for him. I think so. Pothinos. He came to kill you. Or you. Passage to the tombs. I saw his sandal beneath the curtain. And now am I worth talking to? More... Well, far more than Pothinos. Guards! Take it away. Let's not talk anymore. I picked a flower in Britain once, the color of your eyes. This is the first morning he's been late since the day he was born. Ho, there! Caesar comes! Well, well, come on, come on. Let's go to work. Hold that letter to the Senate. But the agreement with the King's Prime Minister. Destroy it. Even I can't reach an agreement with a corpse. The Prime Minister is dead. Then we deal with the King? The Queen. Cleopatra is sole ruler of Egypt. And I find that I shall be here longer than I thought. But the galley, Caesar, is ordered to sail. When I say so. A letter to Marc Antony, Rome. Here, you're with me. Nobody ever hears from him. Except Marc Antony. He gets a letter every week or so. Is it true that Caesar is really in love... Child, child. But he doesn't come back to Rome, does he? Well, he's missing a lovely party today. He doesn't miss very much any day. The Queen of Egypt gives parties, too. You mean Cleopatra? Whoa! What? Have you heard of Cleopatra? Of course. All kinds of things. Is she black? Calpurnia. My lady. How beautiful you are. Is there anything I can get for you? Yes, a little luck. The loveliest party you've ever given, Calpurnia. Thank you, Flora. Wonderful. The wife is always the last one to know. So is the husband, when it comes to that. They say he's planning to move the capital to Egypt. We were talking of the games. Have you seen the new circus, Calpurnia? I haven't been to the games since Caesar left. You should enjoy life more, Calpurnia. Even Caesar's wife should play. Why not? She's above suspicion. We waited two hours for you yesterday. What kept you? Oh, I'm sorry. I'll explain it later. When is Caesar coming back? Ever? Tullius, I'm so sorry to hear about your brother's exile. I shall ask a pardon for him when Caesar returns. I hope he grants it. If Caesar returns. If Caesar returns. It's rumored all over Rome. It's been known for days. If what you say is true, Cassius... we're in a desperate situation. But I can't believe it. It is true, Brutus. I heard with my own ears. Quiet, Casca. Let Brutus speak. The people love you, Brutus. They love Caesar. But he would make himself king. And then, where are we? If I had proof of that... He plans to divorce Calpurnia and marry a queen. This Cleopatra. And call himself King of Rome. Of us. Emperor of the world. Was I not born as free as Caesar? And you? And you? Caesar. He's everywhere. Rome is a republic. It wants no crown. It will have no king. Octavia. Hello, dear. Hello, dear. Hello, Octavian. Oh, it's a delightful party. Sit down with us a moment. Where's Antony? Does any wife ever know where her husband is? Calpurnia knows where her husband is. Sit down just for a minute. You look tired. Just for a minute. No news at all from Caesar, eh? I don't expect any. He's too busy, Octavian. Well, he shouldn't be too busy to write to me. He writes to Marc Antony. Why Antony and not me? Why? Tell me why. Wouldn't you think he'd know the last people you write to are relatives? But I'm more than Caesar's nephew, I'm his heir. You're my brother, and Marc's my husband. I know you both pretty well. And if I were Caesar, I would certainly write to Marc Antony. Ho, there! Marc Antony comes! Oh, Marc Antony's here! Wait, wait, wait. I have news. News? Another letter from Caesar? More than a letter. Caesar is entering Rome. Caesar is entering Rome! Marc Antony, please. I must see you for one day. No, no, not now. I came to get Calpurnia. Slave. Take them. Did you all hear? Yes. Well, well, and who is this pretty maid? Hello, darling. ""Hello, darling""? You'd think she had met me before. Or is it my fame she seeks? Oh, he hasn't been to bed. He always talks like this when he hasn't... Sleep. I'm above sleep, my beloved wife. I'm glad you're above something. Ah, in his usual gay mood. But, come on. We must hurry. You ready, Calpurnia? I'm not going. Sorry? I shall wait for my husband here. What's the matter? Nothing. Oh, yes, there is. There's a great deal the matter. And I'm in no hurry to watch Caesar's triumphal entry into Rome. Why, what's the matter with you? Do you take us all for fools? Don't you think we know what Caesar plans to do? And what does Caesar plan to do? Well, go and listen to him in the Senate tomorrow... and you'll learn what he plans to do. We don't have to. It's no music to our ears to hear him desert us. He's drunk with Egypt, and he's deserting us. Antony! Antony! No! Octavian, no! Antony... I know. There he is! There he is! Caesar! Hail! Hail, Caesar! I thought she gave money. Her dress is all gold. She's too gorgeous. In the shape of a sphinx. But she is beautiful. She is. Oh, I don't know. Oh, but look at all those chariots! Caesar. Beware the Ides of March. One date is as good as another for a funeral. Beware. You may go now. We need nothing more. Well, Brutus, was I right about... Be careful. Must we whisper what all Rome growls? Yes, I believe. Now that I know he's divorcing Calpurnia to marry her. That might be his private affair... but tomorrow he'll force the Senate to declare him Emperor and King. And present Cleopatra to them as... Queen. Our Queen, Brutus. Our Queen. No, Rome cannot be turned into another Orient... with golden thrones for a king and queen. But I suppose he'll sway the Senate as he always has. Oh, no, he won't. We'll greet Caesar before he greets the Senate... and a little blood will be spilled for Rome. So today you go before the Senate to... Well, all I can say is I think it's your first mistake. All I can say is I don't care what you think. You always did care what I thought. You always agreed. Ah. I don't hate women for nothing. Enobarbus speaks. And speaks well. What's this? Antony hates women, too? Out of their place, I do. They've no place amongst men. They can't think, and they can't fight. They're just playthings for us. Most of them. All of them. A woman's a woman. We speak freely to you because we are your friends. I know that. You say that the whole idea of this marriage to Cleopatra... is to capture India and then the world. Does that sound like you? When did you ever ask anyone's help? Anything you wanted, you took. It'll be easier to take it this way. Well. Easier. A strange word from Caesar. Women soften all men. He sounds like a lover talking. An Egyptian lover. That woman's making an Egyptian out of you. You bring Egyptian ships and men back with you. You change the calendar of Rome to Egypt's. But you cannot make an Egyptian queen a ruler over Romans. Words. Look at the Roman eagle with half the world in his claws... tamed by a woman. I'm leaving for the Senate. But, Caesar, you... Are you coming, Antony? No, I'll take no part in it. Any man who wants to make a fool of himself over a woman... can do so, as far as I'm concerned. I don't know what the young man means, but he means it violently. And I agree with him. Then you'd better follow him. Caesar! Caesar! Oh, Caesar. Oh, you haven't gone. Don't go! Oh, don't go. Don't go. Calpurnia. I've had a dream, a terrible vision. I saw a flaming star falling, and it was you, your body dripping blood. I saw your toga torn by daggers, wet with blood, your blood, my husband. Oh, please, please don't leave this house today. It's an evil omen. I know it. I know it. Calpurnia, my dear... the world's affairs cannot be stopped because you've had a dream. Casca the Senator. Caesar. Caesar, the Senate waits for you. No, no, no. You shall not go. I'll keep you here. Calpurnia has seen a day of evil for me in her dreams. Perhaps... Shall I return and tell the Senate, which waits to offer you the world's crown... that they must wait until Calpurnia's dreams are pleasanter? I'll come. Oh, no, no, Caesar. I beg you. Not for myself but for you. Oh, please, please, Caesar. Evil is on every side. I know it. I know it. For what I have done, Calpurnia, pardon. For what I am about to do, courage. No. No! The swan's feather. Iras, be careful. I'm trying to keep my hand from shaking... but, Majesty, I'm so excited. Majesty. Majesty. Royal robes for the Empress of the world. Up the stairs. Before the Queen. And, Majesty, wait until you see them. They're beautiful, marvelous. Take the lid off. Beautiful! The Roman Senate will get a thrill today. Choose, Majesty. It's not the Senate I'm worried about but their fat wives. Here. Do you know anything about senators, Charmion? Well, we only got here yesterday, Majesty. Caesar! My sandals. Hail, Caesar! Caesar comes! I only stopped for a last salute. Oh, no, wait just a minute. There's something I want to tell you. Too late, my love. And get dressed. Get dressed. I'll be ready. But the Senate is waiting. Let them wait. I want a moment all alone. But... No, put your arms around me. Hold me close to you. I'm frightened of something. Frightened? What's the matter? I love you so much. And that frightens you? Nothing must happen to you, my Caesar. Nothing will. I'll send for you the moment my speech is done. You must be ready. Emperor! Empress! He passes here. Tullius. Decimus. Solinus. Casca. You, there. Brutus, beside the column. Listen! He must be just arriving. How long will the speech take? He's sending for me right after. You'll be ready. And how you'll look. Do you think you might wear this dress when you get married, too? What? I was just thinking of the great Caesar trying to unhook it. Charmion. Listen. Listen to the cheers now. Hail! Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar! Caesar, hail! Caesar, I warned you. The Ides of March. The Ides of March are here. But not gone. Caesar! Caesar comes! Ah, Caesar. A pardon, Caesar, for my brother in exile. Denied. You tyrant! Stand back! Take your hands off me! Let me get out of here! Get off me! You! You, too, Brutus! A great day for Rome. Am I all right? Marvelous. Beautiful. The senators' eyes will pop right out of their heads. Caesar is dead! What? Caesar is dead! Caesar is a traitor to Rome! His speech is over. It must be. I hear the shouting. Apollodorus, has the messenger come? Not yet. I never saw anything so beautiful. Let me show you. How do you like this? Gorgeous. Or do you like this? I am only a man. How can I tell? The Queen! The Queen! Where's the Queen? Stand! Stand! Stop! Stop! Caesar has been murdered! Royal Egypt, Caesar is dead. How was this? By whom? I don't know, but I heard them cry, ""Brutus! Cassius!"" As I galloped through the streets, I heard them shout: ""Caesar is a traitor to Rome!"" Where is he? Where is Caesar? Dead, Majesty. The body lies at the foot of Pompey's statue. No one will touch it. I will. Majesty, you cannot. No, my Queen. No. Majesty! Majesty! They come this way. They cry for Egypt's blood! Man the small boat at the foot of the garden. ## Come, my Queen. Come. We must go. We must escape. They will kill you. Think of Egypt. ""Think of Egypt""? Always Egypt! But Caesar is dead. My Emperor. That dream is gone. Gone. Yes, gone. What do I care for empire now? Caesar is dead. My lover is dead. He didn't love you. You lie! You lie! You lie! Majesty. It wasn't in his arms he wanted to hold Egypt. It was in his treasury. It's true. You were blind. He didn't love you. You were blind. Blind. Antony. Always Antony. Sit down, Octavian. Sit down. That's all I do, sit. Well, then sit down. I won't sit down! See, he can't even sit down. Antony, Octavian. Caesar dead only two weeks, and you fill his house with your quarrels. The Senate has decreed that you both shall rule Rome together... and that Antony shall avenge the death of Caesar upon the traitors... and shall punish Egypt. But why Antony? I'll govern with you if I have to. But if there's any fighting to be done, I'll do it alone. Alone. You want to do everything alone. You took advantage of Caesar lying on his funeral pyre... to gain the public's support for yourself. You used my uncle's dead body to win control... holding up his bloodstained toga like any playactor... to make the crowd cheer you. You, with your, ""Friends, Romans, countrymen. "" That's enough! Steady. I accept the Senate's order. Good. And you, Octavian? Oh, I suppose so. And how do you propose to punish Egypt? I shall write a letter to the Egyptian Queen... demanding that she meet me in the public square in Tarsus. A letter? The great Marc Antony fights with friendly notes. Really, Octavian, you must... No, it's all right. Octavian's right, for once. It will be a friendly note. Well, but I don't understand. Friendly? I see. She will think the meeting a friendly discussion... on Roman and Egyptian affairs. Yes. Instead, my legions will be with me in Tarsus on our way to take Egypt by force. From Tarsus, I shall send Cleopatra to Rome in chains. That's more like the real Marc Antony. We're approaching Tarsus. Are we? And no plans yet, Cleopatra. If you fail, it means slavery for Egypt and death for you. If you had listened to me, at least we'd have ships and men with us. Where do we meet Marc Antony? In the public square at noon. Well, why doesn't she come? How should I know? Where are the two generals you sent to bring her? Waiting for her, I suppose, like you and me and the whole Roman army. Waiting for a woman. A woman! Six hours. While you stand here and do nothing. Go and get her. Well, it's about time. What? Apologize! I apologize. Watch your tongue, or I'll cut it out of you! Wait here. I'll go down to her boat and get her myself. Stop there! Who nears the Queen's barge? I'm Antony of Rome. You're late. Where are my men? Oh, Charmion. Where are the Romans who came here today? Do you know? They're sleeping, my Queen. Sleeping? What for? They're... Well, I should say they were a little tired. You mean a little drunk! No, awfully drunk. Come and see. Get someone to fling them ashore. We'll go now. Get ready. Were you speaking to me? Who do you think? I sent orders for you to come to the square. I'm not used to being disobeyed. And why should I obey you? Your letter said we had things to talk about. The letter said that we would meet in the public square in Tarsus... and that's where we're going. Oh. We can't talk here then? No, we cannot talk here. Talk? With all this? Oh, how different from your generals. Well, I guess I must confess everything. I must tell you why I wanted to meet you here instead of the square. Well? Do you see the way I'm dressed? What about it? I'm dressed to lure you, Antony. You see all this? It was all a plan. And you know why? Because it was my only chance. Don't you think I know you're my enemy, you and your hungry Rome? But I suppose it was the most stupid thing I could have done. Why, do you know I had show after show with which to dazzle you? But Antony is not a man to be dazzled if he doesn't please. No. What do you care for this, for instance? Watch. I wish you could see your face. Huh? I'd have more chance with a stone wall. Will you forgive me for being such a fool? I should have known that Antony is not Antony for nothing. Well, shall we go now? Yes, we'll go. My wits have failed, and I'm in your hands. But what could I do? No, what would you have done? Pretend you're me and I'm you. No, no. No, no. You're Cleopatra and I'm Antony. Do I look like that? Well, do I? I think you'd better stay as Cleopatra. Oh, no, no. Don't drink that. No, that was part of the plan, too. I was going to get you so irresponsible. You didn't think one goblet would do it, did you? Yes, wouldn't it? Well, that does amuse me. But it's such a large goblet. Yes, isn't it? Well. Well. I hope that you know that I know you want me to do this. Dear Antony, I hope you think I know that you know I know. Oh. No, we're not dining here after all. No, wait. What is it? Reed birds from the Nile. Are they any good? Oh, they're supposed to be. There's not very much to it, is there? Then we may dine here? I'm really very hungry. So am I, when it comes to that. Your little reed birds aren't enough for me. No, wait, Antony. Clams from the sea. They're catching them now. Come and see. Jewels. You are a good fisherman. The golden streams of Egypt never run dry. Throw them. Roman dogs. Yes, Egyptian cats. # Starlit night # # Let enchantment bright # # Weave a spell on him # # Whom I love # # Grant me the heart I crave # # Hear the prayer of thy slave # # Isis # # Great Queen of Night and love # # Hear thy slave # # Hear thy slave ## A song to the stars. They must think we're funny people... scheming to destroy each other as if we had forever to live. They must wonder: ""Why don't Egypt and Rome meet in the public square... ""to plan union instead of conquest?"" Yes, it's very funny. I said things to Caesar I wish I hadn't. Oh? There's beauty in the Egyptian Queen besides her face. Do you miss him? No, he didn't love me. Is that really the reason? No, not really. I admire men who don't love women. What do you mean by that? Oh, I don't know. Women should be but toys for the great. It becomes them both. To you for that. Oh. And to you for that. Why, Antony. What? Did I hear you hiccup? Not me. I never hiccup. Well, it certainly wasn't me. Queens don't hiccup. Well, I don't know whether they do or not. They most certainly do not. Queens only talk of stars. Well, who do you suppose it can be? Because I'm sure I heard something. It's somebody under the couch. Ah. Come out. Come out! They're gaining. I'm very much afraid it's the Queen of Egypt who's hiccupping. Oh, but doesn't that seem a little absurd? Yes. I'll stop them for you. Don't you ever have hiccups, Antony? No, not tonight, I don't. Does it hurt? Oh, no, not a bit. Well, it did it, didn't it? Oh, yes, it did it. What would happen if you hit me like this? I'd knock your head off. And it would go rolling down the deck into the river. Wouldn't even touch the deck. You're charming. All right, I'm ready to go now. Why? Oh, you don't find me charming. Yes, I do. I could fall in love with you, but I don't intend to. What for? Do you mean that? There's no one like you. Octavian! Octavian! Hail! Hail, Octavian! Hail! Hail, Octavian! Your cheers at last! And they can only mean that at last you agree with me... that Marc Antony is a traitor to Rome. Antony's a traitor! A traitor, I tell you! Two months, two long months have come and gone, and what has happened? Nothing! Not a thing! Has he attacked Egypt with his legions there? No! No! Has he brought Cleopatra back in chains? No! No! Has he done anything? No. Nothing. Yes, he's done one thing, and that completely. He's sailed to Egypt with the Queen... and lived there ever since with no thought of Rome. He's forgotten Rome. Who is this poisonous snake that wrecks our men? Caesar first, and now Antony. When will it end? I'll tell you when! Now! Now! This time it's my turn. There will be no more talk of war. There will be war! War! No more shining words, but shining steel! Rome will be paid with Antony's blood... and the Egyptian snake will be destroyed, and there shall be war! War! War! War! War! What? I never can believe it. What? I should want to leave you right now. Why should you? For a little while, I should. Why? So that you won't tire of me. Aren't you afraid I might tire of you? No. I should want to go out and get drunk with a lot of men. Or find another woman. Well, why don't you? Because you are another woman. New. Always new. Completely new. Majesty! Majesty! Majesty! What is it? King Herod has arrived. Had you forgotten? No, no. Where is he? He's waiting in the audience chamber. I beg of you. Hurry, Majesty. Come now, what's the hurry? Oh, please. What do you care for the king of Judea? But he's my guest. Oh, now, be a good boy and stop frowning. I have to dress. All right, but kiss me first. Now run along. Welcome. I hope to renew an old friendship. I hope so, too. Well, time has made you older and wiser. And me younger and more beautiful. And any news? News, indeed. I come directly from Rome on my way to Judea. Ah. Yes, directly from Rome. As a friend and ally of Rome? And as a friend and ally of Egypt. And the news? If you'll dismiss your court, I... Charmion. Well? For the moment, I'm tongue-tied before so much beauty. The news. The news. You go to great length for the sake of Egypt, don't you? You know, I... I wonder how far you would go, really. Octavian doesn't like Antony... but Octavian is in power now. If Antony were dead... Octavian would be a very good friend and ally of Egypt. He told me to give you that message. Oh. I thought you were a friend of Antony. I am. I am. I always said there was no man in the world that could drink with Antony... but not now. But listen... No, no, no. My friend, when a man is drunk with love... he can't divide his concentration with wine, you know. All major emotions are greedy. And tell me, my friend, aren't you happier with her than with a grape? Or anything else. I'm mad about her. Of course you are, my boy. Of course. That reminds me of something. Something very funny, too, that I heard recently in Rome from Octavian. Octavian? It must have been funny. It was, Antony. It was. Listen, this is what he said. If Cleopatra would poison Antony... Rome would forgive her for everything, and that would be the salvation for Egypt. Poison me? Uh-huh. Poison you. Just imagine, Cleopatra poisoning you. What did I say? Isn't it funny? It's the funniest thing I've ever heard. As if love didn't conquer all. As if it didn't. Poison me? I can't wait to tell her! How she'll laugh. I'll go and tell her. I'll be right back. Yes, do that, Antony. Do tell her, please. She... You poison me! You must for Egypt. Egypt. Now you ask me to do murder for Egypt. I can't. I can't. It's only one life against the freedom of your people. You don't love him. What's your crime? Murder. I killed my wife and child while I was drunk. What punishment has been decreed? Crucifixion. How long will it take you to die on the cross? I am strong, Majesty. Two days. Maybe three. Would you like to die in three seconds? Majesty, you're merciful. Take this. Drink it. Was there any pain? A little, a very little. There must be no pain. What's this? The Queen is testing poisons. A wine we've never had before, dear Antony. I've been saving it. What for? For a night when the mood strikes. I see. And tonight is that night? Tonight. Now, can you think of a pretty toast? It would please me very much. You're very gay. And you're very solemn. Is there any reason? I'm thinking. Evidently. Well, let's drink first. Perhaps pretty words will follow. But you don't drink. Neither do you. I don't wish to drink alone. And I don't think I wish to drink at all. Well... he is in a strange mood tonight. Now tell me, what's the matter? Oh. For some reason, I've... I've no thirst tonight. I'd far prefer just to sit and watch you drink. You really mean that? Yes, I do. If that's what you prefer, I always try to please you, Antony. Oh, my dear. The strangest man on the face of the earth. The happiest man on the face of the earth. Come on. Let's drink. Look, Antony. What? The reed birds again. Not much of a meal for a man. These things get smaller and smaller. Do you remember the stars? Yes, and the river. And the rose. When I put it in your hair, and you were Cleopatra. Yes, and I threw it back at you. And I sweetened your wine with it. That was a night. Let's drink to the river. To the river. Majesty. What is it? A carrier pigeon from Rome. Rome has declared war. War? Let me see that. Octavian declares me a traitor, eh? Octavian! Octavian to meet me! I'm laughing now. Go get Enobarbus. Send him here. I take orders only from my Queen. What? Now, get up and get him! You keep out of this! Another word from you, and I'll smash you to powder. Now, get him! All Egyptians, eh? I need Roman soldiers now. You, get my 10 generals and send them to me at once. Yes, my lord. Well, jump to it! Maps. My maps. Yes, lord. You, get my war chests. Yes, lord. Send carrier pigeons to Ventilius at Tarsus, Drusus at Athens... and to my legions in Philippi... to get under way at once and meet me and my 10 legions at Actium. Yes, lord. Slaves, bring tables! Yes, and get chairs, chairs for my generals! I need Roman soldiers now. So I'm a traitor, am I? They'll take that back on their knees! And as for you and your Egypt, take your choice: Rome or Antony? It's all the same to Antony. Here, you! All right, set it down. I want galleys tomorrow morning to transport 10 legions. Ten legions to Actium. Tomorrow morning? Manned and equipped for six months' siege. The legions will assemble under my generals in the square. Tomorrow morning? At dawn. Now, get out. What answer will you send Octavian? Octavian? Send that to Octavian! I'm at war again! No! Antony! Antony! What's the matter? What is it? At last, I've seen a god come to life. I'm no longer a queen. I'm a woman. You choose me, Cleopatra, against the world? Against the world. Then we'll meet it. We'll smash it to pieces, put it together again, and call it ours! War! Ah, Enobarbus! Come over here. I've my plans all ready. A trap that Octavian will fall into like a little mouse. There'll be no war. Why, what's happened? Disaster. Disaster? Yes, and for Octavian, complete disaster. Where are my generals? They're all here, Antony. And can you blame them? They're Romans. They won't serve under an Egyptian queen. They won't fight for Egypt against Rome. They have gone. They've taken their legions with them. Now they're Octavian's generals, and you are alone. There'll be no war. There will be war! And what will you fight with? The Egyptian army against all of Rome? If that's all we have left, we fight with them. We? What? I'm not here to fight with the Egyptian army. I'm here to tell you that Rome is still yours if you want her. Rome will always love you, Antony. All that Rome wants is your love in return. And there's one way to prove that love. One way, and overnight Octavian will be forgotten... and Rome will take back to her arms her hero. One way. Well? Say the word, and I'll plunge that through a woman's heart. And the report will be that you did it, and Rome will take you back to her heart. There's no room in Rome for Octavian and me. You mean, there's not room enough in your world... for anything else but Cleopatra. Yes. Yes, that's what I mean. Yes. That's what you mean. And you're the man I once heard say to Caesar: ""They can't think. They can't fight. They are playthings for us. "" No man can speak to me like that. Get out! I'm getting out, but I'm taking nothing of yours with me. There's Brittany back. And there's the campaign in Syria. This, you've long forgotten. When I saved your life. And this... when you saved mine. And this... Put them back! No! Our long campaign together lies with the plans on the floor. The war goes on. Is that all you have to say? That's all. Well. Goodbye, Antony. You, who might have been the world's great man... ends all for a woman. For that, I give you the world's contempt. But for what you might have been... I give you my last salute. So Rome would forgive and take you back? And all they demand is for us to part. Why don't they ask the sun to fall right out of the sky? Yes, we'll fight them. We'll fight them all if we have to fight alone. Forward march! Watch the cavalry! Burn the boats! On fire! So you've got it all, eh? All my generals, all my legions, all the Egyptians. Everything I had on land and sea, you've lured and brought away. You've got it all. You've got it all except me! Come down and surrender. You come up and get me! Words. He fights to the last with words. Words. All right, you listen to them. I'll come down and fight you alone! I can think of easier ways for you to die. Well, if you're afraid, I'll fight the lot of you. One by one. Two by two. And if that bores me, I'll fight you three by three! You've forgotten how to fight! You've lost your army! And if I decide to grant your request and choose to be the first you meet... what's the prize? The Egyptian Queen? Wait! Shut up! The Egyptian Queen is no man's prize. She is a warrior of her own and fights by my side. Closer to the wall. Closer to the wall. It's coming down. Don't lower that bridge, you fools! Put it up! Closer to the bridge. He mustn't see us. Put it up again, I say! Majesty, did you see him on the wall? He looked so... Oh, can't I tell him? No! No. He wouldn't believe I could help him... but it's our last chance. I've got to take it. Forward. Look, somebody's coming out. Can you see who it is? The olive branch! They're carrying the olive branch. The Queen of Egypt! Look. Cleopatra. It is the Queen! Cleopatra surrenders! Cleopatra. Come back. Come back. Come back! Come back! He couldn't even keep her! She's a warrior, all right, but she fights by our side! Jump, Antony! Jump! All you've got left now is the wall! He can't keep his woman. Where you going? What's your hurry? Wine. Bring me wine. Look, this is Antony the Roman leader. This is Antony at the square in Tarsus. To send the woman back in chains, then on to Egypt with marching men! Here's to Antony! My lord, can I... Get out. But Tarsus isn't here it seems. Instead, a couch. A couch to lie on. A woman to give your arms to instead of chains. Antony, who can't think or fight. Antony, the plaything of a woman! And there is Egypt. Yours. All I ask is to save his life. Spare him, and I promise you'll never see him again. I shall take him away, far up the Nile... and leave with you Egypt. I suppose of all the requests that have ever been made... yours is the most hopeless. Spare Antony's life? I'd sooner be dead myself. And as for you, this time you do go back to Rome in chains. This time you face a man! Take her away. We can't do that, Excellence. She came bearing the olive branch. What's the difference? We've only to smash the city's gates. Oh, we'll smash the city's gates, all right. But she must have safe conduct back. We are Romans. Oh, all right. Go back and kiss him goodbye. Thank you, soldier. When you smash the gates... you had better come in behind your men. I failed, but there's still a way out for us. I have horses waiting beyond the passage to the tombs... and a boat with trusted rowers will take us to the upper Nile. Antony, we can lose ourselves there and still be happy. Antony, listen. I never wanted to see you again. How deep does a man have to stab to die? Antony! Antony, what... No, no more Antony! Antony's gone. You go back to Octavian. He's the Caesar now. You thought I went to him? You... You thought that of me? Am I blind? I went for your sake. I went to plead for your life. To plead, Antony. I was pleading for your life, and you were taking it. Antony. I am blind indeed. I am dying, Egypt. Dying. Listen. There's little time. Away from war in upper Egypt with you would have been very sweet... but this, this is a better end. A Roman by a Roman conquered. No, no, no. Don't pity me. Don't pity me. We were born for war. It was the soul of our love, and we part at the top of our glory. My precious Cleopatra, I'm happy. The end is in your arms. My love. Take me away with you into the shadows... as close as if you could carry me in your arms. I am taking you with me, Egypt. I am taking you with me. Forever. Antony. Hurry, Majesty. Hurry! They're at the doors. Prepare me. The Queen of Egypt goes to meet the conqueror. The doors are breaking. Royal Egypt, let me die before I see you go to Rome in chains, defeated. I'm not going to Rome, Charmion. Now, give me the basket. It holds victory. It works. Little Iras. Charmion. Look well for love. Look well. And not finding it, give nothing. But if blessed with Cleopatra's fortune... give all. Now, go., Good morning, miss macdaid. Good morning. Good morning, Rama. Good morning. What's this, Target practice? If I didn't, they wouldn't Leave me any flowers. What about stopping for a drink Or perhaps a cup of tea? Oh, it's a temptation, Mr. Ransome, But they're expecting me Back at the hospital. In other words, One of my patients has simply Made up his mind to die... If miss macdaid isn't there Every hour she can spare... Out of the 24 She already works. Very well, but next time I won't take no For an answer. I'll hold you to that. Try and persuade major Safti To take some rest. There goes a great And good woman. Yes, there's no one Quite like her. Now, there's one Of the mysteries of India... I'll never be able To understand. What's that? That stringless quartet Over there. They never Seem to listen Or to say anything. But I know perfectly well That by Tomorrow morning... My innermost secrets Will be the common talk Of Ranchipur. But of course, You have nothing To hide. Brandy and soda? Yes, thanks. No, I don't think I'd better. I may have to operate This afternoon. Oh, just a drop. Steadies the hand, see? Well, kind of. Hmm. Then there's a conference With the maharajah At the palace. In this heat? Major, your energy appalls me. Why, it isn't hot. It's only 109 in the shade. Aren't you ever Going to finish it? Is there any hurry? But you haven't Done a stroke since The last time I was here. Oh, stop. You're making me perspire. If the rains Would only come. They were praying at the temple As I drove by this morning. I had half a mind to join them. In prayer? I didn't know You had faith In anything, Tom. Oh, that's where you're wrong. I've got faith In a lot of things. For instance, uh-- For instance? Well, for instance, Queen victoria. That old statue? Oh, to you She's only a statue, But to me she's an old friend-- A living reminder of the fine, Brave days before the world Went to seed. When london bridge did Its falling to a dance step, Not to the threat Of Tomorrow's bombs. When every american Was a millionaire-- Or about to be one-- And people sang in vienna. There she stands In her cast-iron petticoat, Unconcerned about wars, Dictators and appeasement, As serene as ever. God bless her. The world is not as bad As you think, Tom. No? Only trying To commit suicide As fast as it knows how. I don't agree with you. Here in Ranchipur, We're trying to make it A little better. The whole world? Our world-- India in general, Ranchipur in particular. I rather like the old place Just as it is. You see it as an artist. I see it as an Indian. My people are crying for help, After centuries of disease... And poverty and superstition. The american girl And her mother From the mission. They're not stopping here, Are they? Mother, please don't. I'll die if you do. Oh, don't be silly. If he wanted to know us, He'd have called before this. Hold the reins. Is the honorable Mr. Ransome in? I'll find out, memsahib. Please. Oh! Mr. Ransome. Do forgive me For intruding. I'm so anxious to have you come To a little garden party... I'm giving this afternoon For lily hoggett-egburry... And some of the nicer English people. Well, the major and I Had planned some tennis For this afternoon, and-- Well, I'm sure that major Safti Won't mind giving up his tennis Just this once. Well, I'm afraid That's for Mr. Ransome To decide. There, you see? It's all settled. 5:00 for tea. We'll be looking For you. Now, why did I say I'd go? You didn't. She did. So nice to see you, lily. Thank you, my dear. Oh, you know major craddock And mrs. Palmer, of course. How do you do? Mrs. Hoggett-egburry. How do you do? How do you do? Lily, Tom Ransome Is dropping in later. Tom Ransome! Oh, my dear! What a catch for you. I mean, my dear, A realpukka sahib, And one of the very best County families In all england. But, being an american, Of course that means Nothing to me. No, of course not. Oh! How do you do? Why, how are you? I'm so glad to see you. This is a surprise. - and how do you do? How nice seeing you. - fine, thank you. Phew! I wish you'd do something About that dreadful Smiley woman. Yes, dear. Look at her. She just does it to annoy me. Does what, dear? Sits there And looks so-- Oh, so middle west In front of my guests. I wish you'd do Something about it. What can I do, dear? Well, you're head Of this mission, aren't you? Yes, but it's her verandah, My dear. Here comes Mr. Ransome. Hello, Tom! Oh, hello, aunt phoebe. How do you keep so cool In this infernal heat? No hotter than iowa In good corn weather. Mmm! All dressed up, Fit to kill. Where you going? Across the way. Are you going over? No, sirree. We've got A gentleman's agreement. She keeps her nose Out of the mission school, And I don't have to go To her parties. You might call it An armed truce. How are you, homer? Hello, Tom. Hello, darling. Hello. What do you think you are, A two-year-old? Working after hours In this heat. My husband's a fool. Now, now, ma. You know what It says in scripture About calling people fools. I had to keep One of my pupils After school. He'd been throwing Spitballs. You'll be staying To tea, of course? Oh, he can't. He's going to the party. Oho. Better hurry up, Tom. Mrs. Simon will be Climbing that hedge After you. Here I go. So glad you could come. It's my last tea this season. We'll be leaving for simla Before the rains. You'll be going too, Of course? Naturally. No one stays in Ranchipur During the monsoon. No? Only about Five million people. Oh, you know what I mean. Proper people-- The kind of people one knows. It's so seldom out here One meets anyone... From one of the real County families. Of course, you've heard The Eskeths have just arrived? The Eskeths? Lord Esketh. Thelord Esketh. Oh, fern! Fern! I'm coming. Oh, there you are. Fern, Mr. Ransome's here. Put some powder On your nose. It keeps melting off. If you think he'd marry me, You're on the wrong track. Why, how dare you Insinuate that I-- All right, all right. Let's not argue. Okeydoke. I'm ready. ""okeydoke."" I don't know where you pick up All this american slang. Mr. Ransome. Mr. Ransome, this is Our little girl. Our little daughter, Fern. How do you do? I've wanted so much For you two to know Each other. May I get you a drink? Oh, you're very kind. I'll send one of the boys. You know what mother Means by a drink, Don't you? I beg your pardon? Lemonade. Oh. Wouldn't you like something, Uh, a little stronger? I see that my reputation Has preceded me. Father keeps a little brandy In case of snake bites And things. Mmm. The snakes Have been a bit trying This afternoon. I'll get some for you. You think your mother Would mind very much If we-- Mother? She wouldn't mind. Thanks. A little water, please. Thank you. Oh, I hope I'm not Keeping you from your guests. Oh, they're not my guests. That's mother's idea Of high society. They're all excited Because you're here. Really? Should I be flattered? They say dreadful things About you. What sort of things? That you're a drunkard And a bounder And a remittance man. They'll hang around you Just the same... Because your father Was an earl. I suppose I shouldn't Be talking like this. Why not? I don't mind. I don't care What they say about you, Because I know What you're really like. I've watched you from my window Every time you've come To the smileys'. Sometimes I think You're the only person In Ranchipur I don't hate. You see, Mr. Ransome, I've wanted to know you For a long time, But not this way. Not with mother throwing me At your head. Oh, my dear child-- Oh, I'm not a child. I'm over 18. I'm a woman. I-- I need your help. I'm-- I'm in trouble. Trouble? Yes, I-- Oh, it's so hard To tell you. Well, it needn't be. I understand. That's why I had to come to you. You see, I-- Perhaps I can help you. - is there a man mixed up in it? - no. Except you. Oh, Mr. Ransome, I've got to get away From here. I can't stand it Any longer. What's the matter? Well, they want to run My life for me. They want me to go on Living this phony life They think is so wonderful. And mother pretending We're not just missionaries. You will help me, won't you? Well, what could I do? Well, you know All about the world... And women And things like that. Oh, well, if it's advice You want-- Oh, no, I-- I need more than advice. I-- I haven't any money. Well, I couldn't do that. Well, I only need A little-- Just enough to get me To where I want to go. I'll pay you back, Honestly, every cent. Oh, it isn't the money, My child. I told you, I'm not a child. Look here, I can't be Directly responsible For what might happen to you. Don't you realize The awkward position You might put me in? I didn't think you cared About respectability. Well, I don't. Neither do I. I just Want everything there is To be had out of life. That's all very well, But it's not that easy. I'm not looking For things to be easy. I just can't Stand it here any longer. I've got to get away. - where would you go? - on the stage. - on the stage? - well, why not? I'm not bad-looking. And I have Very nice legs. Oh, yes. Very nice. Uh, miss Simon and I, We were just, uh, talking About the theater. Oh, yes, of course. I'm sorry to disturb you, But there's a messenger here From the palace. Oh, yes? From her highness To Ransome sahib. I'm afraid I'll have to Leave your delightful party If I'm going to be on time. Oh, my dear boy, That's quite all right. I understand perfectly. When the palace calls, We must drop everything And obey. Oh, well, You're very kind. Charming, isn't he? I think it was a mistake Inviting him. Everyone knows His reputation with... Women... And rum. Don't be provincial. Do you ever get us Invited to the palace? Do you? Huh! Good evening, Your highness. Good evening. Good evening, Ransome. I am glad you could come. To see you again is one Of the few thrills left In life, your highness. You said that As if you meant it. I do mean it. Come along. I'll introduce to you Our guests of honor. Lady Esketh. - hello, Edwina. - why, Tom. We heard of a person Named Ransome Living in Ranchipur, But I never dreamed it was you. How nice That you know each other. Oh, yes. We're old friends. Albert? Yes? This is Tom Ransome. You've heard me speak of him. My husband. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Ransome, of course. How do you do? Your highness, I've just Been telling Mr. ""bannager""-- Bannerjee. Yes, yes. When I first visited India, I was amazed to find... That you people had so many Of the modern conveniences. Really? Yes, and the blessings Of civilization. Oh, thank you. We flatter ourselves To be jolly well abreast Of the times. Your highness, Dinner is served. Shall we go? Now that you've met One of your own kind, I suppose you'll be Grand for days. Why do you always make a point Of criticizing men Like Tom Ransome? Because he happens To be a gentleman? If he's a gentleman, Why is he living here In India? He's got plenty Of money. I don't imagine Tom's Ever thought of money, One way or another, In all his life. Oh, one of those Radicals, eh? How do you like the maharani? Tough egg, isn't she? I call her the ""last queen."" You know, nowadays when queens Do everything in their power To look like housewives, She still dresses the queen And acts it. Here goes one of The most expensive figures In the british empire. General, for years I have been telling you... Never to draw To an inside straight. Your highness, would you mind If I showed lady Esketh The palace? Of course not. Need a guide? No, thanks. I know my way about. Good luck. Your highness, My apologies For being late. You received my message? Was it cholera? No, just old-fashioned Colic. Good. Get in the game. I need some competition. Now, look here, Your highness. Your highness, I'm willing To pay 5,000-10,000- For that chestnut stallion And two mares. It is a generous offer, But asoka is not for sale. Oh, come now. Anything's for sale If the offer's high enough. I am afraid You don't understand. Your highness Drives a hard bargain. I mean to have that stallion. Name your price And I'll meet it, Whatever it is. It is not a question Of price, lord Esketh. You have seen other Horses in my stables Almost as perfect as asoka. Now, please let me make you A gift of a stallion And two mares. A gift? Well, if your highness Really means it, you're-- You're very kind. You understand, of course, I cannot ship them During the heat. Of course. Thank you. That's a rembrandt. And that's a buddhist Prayer wheel. And that, I suspect, Was bought... From a street peddler In naples. And this-- This was bagged By the old lady herself, And on foot, too, If that means anything To you. Frankly, it doesn't. No. I'd like some air. Well, it's beginning To look like rain At last. You haven't told me What you're doing here. I came out here seven years ago To paint the maharajah's Portrait. Been here ever since. Not a very exciting life, Is it? No. Is yours? Now and then. Hmm. What brought you All the way up here To Ranchipur? The maharajah's horses. Albert's very fond of horses. The only thing he is fond of, Except money. - have you become fond Of money too? - passionately. It used to be Just excitement. You can't live On excitement alone. We found that out, Didn't we? I didn't mind. I did. I minded washing My own stockings, Going without breakfast And only being able to afford The hairdresser once a week. Well, perhaps I was selfish. There was a time, mind you-- And I hope you won't blush-- When I seriously thought Of marrying you. Why, Tom, how touching. I never suspected. Well, we've come A long way since then. - a long way apart. - what do you mean? You'd know if you'd Lived here a while. In Ranchipur, The important things in life Are the elemental things, Such as crops, Starvation and weather. In europe, When someone says, ""it looks like rain,"" In all probability He's trying to make Polite conversation. But here, where people die As easily as they're born, They're speaking in terms Of life and death. You'll see what I mean If you're still here When the rains come. You'll see them overnight... Turn the fields, the gardens And the jungles... From a parched And burning desert Into a mass of green... That seems to live, To writhe... And to devour the walls, The trees and the houses. Well, I hope I'm not Keeping you up. Tom, you've changed. You didn't used to be Such a windbag. You haven't changed. Haven't I? No. You're still a lovely creature. Am I? It's exciting seeing you again. May I have a cigarette? So you've forgotten. Sorry. Well, I was right. Here it comes. Has your highness any idea Where they've gone? I'm afraid It's a big palace, That they might Be anywhere. Excuse me. Your husband's been looking For you, lady Esketh. I think he wants To go home. Thank you, your highness. Brandy? No, thank you. Who's the pale-copper Apollo? Major Safti. Not bad. Not bad at all. Well, don't waste your time. He's a surgeon And a scientist. Any interest he might have In romance is purely biological. You make him sound Even more exciting. There you are. I've been looking For you everywhere. Are you ready to go? Whenever you are. I'm ready now. I think I'm going To be ill. It's this confounded Climate. I'm sorry, albert. Mr. Ransome tells me There's a doctor In Ranchipur... Who's not at all bad. If you're no better In the morning, We'll send for him. Oh, that's very Kind of you. Hello. Well. What are you doing here? I've run away from home. I'm never going back. Uh-huh. You can't do that. Why not? Because I told you-- I can't take The responsibility. I know, But since we talked This afternoon, I figured out Another way That you can help me. Yes? What way? - well? - I want you to let me Stay here tonight. Have you any idea What you're saying? Of course I have. Don't you see? Then everyone Would think that-- Well, anyway, there'd be Such a scandal, I'd have To leave Ranchipur. They'd send me away. That's all very well, But why, in the name Of the million gods of India, Do you have to choose me? Well, it shouldn't Matter a bit to you. Your reputation Is already so-- So tarnished. Please. Don't you dare laugh at me. Oh, listen to me, child. What's this? You're soaking wet. What of it? And I'm not a child. Well, anyway, You're going straight home. I'm not going home. I'm never going home again. - you want me to put you out By force? - you won't. I'd make a scene, And you're the kind of a man Who hates scenes. Well, at least I can get you Some dry clothes. Come with me. Don't be afraid. Oh-- I'm not afraid. I'm just cold. Uh-huh. Now, change into these. You'll find plenty of towels In the bathroom. Give yourself A good rubdown. Oh, I'll be In the other room. That's very becoming. I don't believe My old school tie ever Appeared to better advantage. Well-- I'm so sorry. It looked so old and frayed, And I couldn't find a belt. That's quite all right. It would be easier If I could call you Tom. There's nothing I'd like better, fern. Don't you feel anything At all about me? I'd be a fool if I didn't. You're lovely, fern-- Not nearly so much Of a child as I thought. There's somebody there, Behind the blind. John! John! I suppose you heard Everything that went on. If you breathe one word of this, I'll feed you To the crocodiles. Yes, sahib. As long as you're up, You can drive miss Simon home. Get the car. Yes, sahib. Yes, sahib. Who was it? Have they gone? He's gone, all right, And you're going too. All right, I'll go now-- Peacefully. Yes. May I come and see you Once in a while? Why, of course. You see, that's important, Because-- Because I guess I love you. If I didn't, I wouldn't be going home now. Has the doctor come yet? He's with his lordship now, Milady. I want to see him Before he goes. Yes, milady. Don't take that. Bring another cup. Yes, milady. Good morning. Oh. Good morning. I'm Edwina Esketh. Oh. I hope I did right Asking especially for you. Maybe I'm imposing on you. On the contrary, Lady Esketh. It's my duty. There's nothing seriously Wrong with your husband, Just a bad congestion. But his blood pressure Is much too high. No unpleasant asiatic microbes? No, just simple European overindulgence. I prescribed Some tablets for him, And he should Be kept very quiet. Won't you stay for some tea? I'll have to get this filled At the hospital. Bates can take it. Do sit down, major. You're very kind. Frankly, it's rather A treat for me to have Someone to talk to. I expect it will be Deadly dull... Now that albert's Going to be ill. I think this tea is cold. I'll send for some more. No, don't bother. I like it that way. Sugar? No, thank you. What would you prescribe For a patient about to die Of galloping boredom? I imagine the maharani Will see to it that you're Properly entertained. - how? - well, the usual routine With guests, I believe, Is to, uh, show them first The waterworks, Then, in order, The narrow-gauge railway, The hospital, the zoo And the asylum for the insane. - how exciting. - yes, isn't it? And the maharajah Has promised me My choice of horses. I wonder if he'd mind If I also chose my escort. Ranchipur is famous For its horsemen. I'm sure you'll have no trouble In finding a suitable escort. Do you ride, major? Whenever I have the time, Which isn't very often. Don't you ever take a day off? I'm willing to make An exception. That's very gallant Of you, major. If you don't mind... Waiting until After working hours. Besides, it's cooler then. I wouldn't dream of Interfering with your work. What's this? The insane asylum? No. No, this is The maharani's music school. Oh. Major sahib, memsahib. How are you, I hope? Would you care To look around? I'd love to. Lady Esketh would like To see the school. Oh, yes. Yes. This way. Mr. Das, the director Of the school. Thank you. Thank you. Do you like music? Oh, I have a box At covent garden As a matter of course. Frankly, I like This sort better. Mr. Das, is jemnaz singh Here today? Oh, yes. Yes. This way, please. Good. Jemnaz singh, The rajput singer. What kind of song Is it? Oh, a love song. Oh, yes. Do you know the song? Yes. The words Are traditional, But the music Is improvised-- Free variations. How do the words go? Well, it's in The ancient language-- The ceremonial language. I'm afraid I don't know it As well as I should. Try. Well, it's a bit florid. ""that my lyre... ""were of purest jade, ""with strings... ""of fine spun gold. ""that I... ""might sing... ""with merit... ""of your beauty. ""your hands... ""hold my life, ""my being. ""drop it, ""and I perish. ""but in your heart, ""my love... ""has found a home. ""and it... Can never die."" ""but in your heart, ""my love has found a home, And it can never die."" It is a lot Of sentimental nonsense, Isn't it? - hello, miss macdaid. - oh, hello. Where's Rama? He's busy. Ahh! Didn't turn up yesterday. What sort of a woman Is lady Esketh? Lady Esketh? Why? The major brought Her here yesterday To show her the hospital. He's out with her Again today. Well, you met her. What did you think Of her? I know her type. Many like her in europe These days. Too many for its own good. Oh. Well, I would say She's the one woman In Ranchipur... That Rama shouldn't know. Is lady Esketh Dining out tonight? Yes, milord. Her ladyship is dining At the Bannerjees'. Mr. Ransome Is calling for her. Oh. Why should I care Who's calling for her? Go on, answer it. Yes, milord. What's this? Major Safti's orders. I hope that blasted native Knows what he's doing. Major Safti is the head Of the state medical department. Filth. Her ladyship Will be ready directly. May I offer you A drink, sir? Yes. Brandy and soda-- And make it strong. Yes, sir. How's the patient This evening? Much better, sir, thank you. Thanks. Hello, Tom. Oh, hello. Good of you to come for me. Are we late? Oh, no, no. There's-- There's plenty of time. No, Mr. Bannerjee's Dinners always begin... At the fashionable Half-past 8:00. Hear you've been Having adventures. I am a victim Of circumstances. If you didn't drink so much, You wouldn't always be Getting into trouble. Well, at least my weakness Is wine. - what do you mean by that? - you know what I mean. Listen to who's moralizing. I suppose that comes From philandering Around missions. I never philander Around missions, And I don't philander Around hospitals either. Don't be catty, Tom. I do believe you're jealous. You know perfectly well I'm not jealous. If there ever was Anything between us, We both know it's finished now-- Dead and gone. Then why do you come here And act drunk And dictatorial? Because I see Something happening I don't like. Stop talking Like a copy book. It's not becoming. When are you leaving? We planned to go Tomorrow, But with albert ill-- Is he too ill to travel? No. Then why don't you go? You are a beast, aren't you? Tom, we've double-crossed Almost everyone in the world. Let's not start On each other. I don't want To interfere really. But Rama's my friend, And I don't like it. If you only knew How wrong you are. He's the one man I've ever met I haven't been able to make An impression on. Are you sober enough To take me To the party? Almost. Bates. Bates! Have they gone yet? Yes, milord. They've just left. Well, get me My dispatch case. Yes, milord. Go on, get it. Don't just stand there. And the pen. Why are you standing there Looking like a fool? Your lordship Didn't dismiss me. Dismiss you? You're lucky I didn't Dismiss you ages ago. I've put up with your Infernal impertinence For 15 years. Don't stand there looking at me. If I want you again, I'll ring. Now, get out. Yes, milord. Come here. Close those. I suppose you'd like me To die of malaria. No, milord. Well, get out! Yes, milord. Just stand still. They won't attack If they're not provoked. Welcome, lady Esketh. Good evening, Mr. Ransome. Please. Some night, you're going To fall flat on your face, And people will begin To suspect that you drink. Good evening. It's awfully kind of you To come, lady Esketh. Of course, we are terribly Upset about lord Esketh-- That he can't Be with us tonight. Hello, Ransome. I believe you know almost Everyone from the palace. You know raschid ali khan. Of course. Yes. And may I present miss macdaid? Lady Esketh. - yes, we've met. - yes, indeed. I hope you're enjoying Your stay, lady Esketh. - very much. - how soon do you expect To be leaving? Oh. I'm in no particular hurry. I find it very pleasant Here in Ranchipur. There's major Safti. Excuse me. Good evening, major. Good evening. You know Major remmington? Lady Esketh. Could I have A word with you? Certainly. Forgive us. Poor lady Esketh. She's so frightfully upset About her husband. Better have this cocktail. It isn't as bad as it looks. Do you know that your friends Have been warning me To leave town? Leave town? Why? Why do you think? They feel I'm a bad influence on you. That's ridiculous. Isn't it? You're not afraid of me, Are you, major? Why, of course not. You wouldn't feel relieved If I left? No. As a matter of fact, I'd miss you. I've enjoyed your company Very much. - I was afraid You'd take that attitude. - what attitude? Lying to me. But I-- I just told you that-- Don't bother to explain. You know perfectly well What I'm thinking, And I know What you're thinking. I've done everything But fall at your feet, And you haven't even blinked. So I think I will Leave Tomorrow morning. Please don't leave On my account. Not because of what might Happen to you if I stayed, But because Of what might happen to me. Earthquake! It's an earthquake! Well, it's all over. Nothing to worry about, Not a thing. Just a slight tremor. Where is his highness? He was in there. What's the matter with you, Standing there like dummies? Clear this away. Get through to that room! Wire's down, of course. I'm going to the palace For orders. Major-- Come along with us, Miss macdaid. They'll need us At the hospital. Bates! Fifteen years, it's been ""yes, milord. No, milord. Yes, milord."" Well, it's too late now. We're both for it. You're afraid. Come on with me. Good morning, Edwina. Good morning. Water's still rising. Look at queen victoria. What's that frightful row? Bannerjee. He says I'm an impious Barbarian. But not in english, You'll notice. That's India for you. They've been praying For the rains all spring. Now that they're here, They're praying for them To go away. Might be just as well If we joined in. Look. It's a boat. Well, I'm glad someone Besides ourselves is alive. Hello! What on earth? Why, it's the little Simon girl. Your juvenile light of love? Come to snatch you From a watery grave-- How sweet. Come on. Give me a hand. Easy now. Thank heaven you're safe. I didn't close my eyes All night. I was afraid You'd be drowned. Edwina, this is miss Simon. Lady Esketh. How do you do? We are glad to see you. If you hadn't come, We might have died Of starvation. Or boredom. Where did you find Thequeen mary? Down the road while we were Looking for my-- my father. I'm sorry, fern. I thought, if you were All right, I'd take you Back to the mission. It's safer there. Yes. It ought to hold About two-- One to paddle And one to bail. You two think You can manage it? There's time For several trips. I'll take you first. I'm-- I'm all right. No more paddling For you, young lady, Until you've had some rest. Now, come on. I don't need Any rest. Now. You come over here now And lie down. Now, we'll fix this For you. There. Now, don't you worry About a thing. I'm gonna take lady Esketh, And then I'm coming back For you. In the meantime, You be a good girl. I'm not in your way Being here, am I? You're not going to apologize For saving our lives, are you? Well, that's only one Of the reasons I came. I wanted you to know That you were in no danger. Well, that's reassuring. I mean from me. I didn't mean to put you On the spot, But when they found out I'd been to your house, They wouldn't believe the truth. Well, don't you Worry about that. Mother pretended to be sore, But I don't think She was really sore. Because, you see, If we got married, She could spend the rest Of her life hobnobbing With high society in england. Yes. Well, anyway, I thought You'd like to know that... You won't have to marry me. Unless you decide To change your mind. That's a bit of luck. The rain's stopping. Hey, Bannerjee. Don't get impatient. I'll come back for you later. Bannerjee. Says he'd rather die On this roof... Than suffer My unclean presence In the same boat. Ready? I suppose so. I'd like to go by the city. You mean by way Of the hospital. Don't you care enough To find out what's become Of your friends? Don't be a fool. I'm sick of being british And pretending I'm not Frightened and worried. But we haven't time. I've got to bring The boat back for fern. I think it's Absolutely nauseating the way You're leading that girl on. I've never seen such An obvious case of calf-love In all my life. Her face Lights up like fireworks Every time she looks at you. That's what you like, Isn't it? That's why We didn't get on. Get in. You always want the woman To treat you like a god. I treated you as if you Were just as bad as myself. Oh, so it's you. Well, where's fern? At the Bannerjees'. I'm going right back For her. The lady with the artillery Is aunt phoebe. How do you do? Mrs. Smiley, Lady Esketh. Pleased to meet ya. Why don't you go Right on up the house. Thank you. Yes. Have you seen homer? No. We couldn't get through To the city. Oh. I suppose you'll be Wantin' something to eat. No, thanks. I've gotta Get back for fern. Don't be a fool. Ain't she safe where she is? Not if that water rises again. Don't worry. I'll be all right. Good-bye. Come on in. I'll get you Some coffee. Thank you. Steady, old girl. You've come back. I'm sorry. I lost your boat. I've done all I can. Rama? I know I can count on you... To help your queen... Rebuild... Our state. Close the door. My good and loyal friends, Ranchipur has been struck A cruel blow. The weakness in our National character has been... That we are inclined to blame Catastrophe on the gods... And fail in our duty. I don't propose To let that happen here. We must call up All our strength, All our resolution, All our courage... If we are to bring Our people to safety. Each of you Must do his part. I have chosen you because I know you will not fail me. I proclaim A state of emergency... To exist in Ranchipur. Raschid. Your police will work With t What is it, major? It has come sooner Than I expected. Several cases of the plague In the sweepers' quarters. On top of that, half The water in Ranchipur Must be polluted. Do what you can to keep The plague from spreading. Burn down the whole quarter If you must. The rest of you Know your duty. Ransome. I want you to stay. Give me a cigarette. Thank you. I said I could depend On this little group. I meant you too. I don't know why, Your highness. Because you are one of us. I need a personal Aide-de-camp-- Someone I can depend on To carry out my orders... And use his own head Whenever necessary. Do you think you can do it? If you think I can. Would you mind Sitting down... Or... Doing anything But just standing there? I'm sorry. Don't mind me. It's just my foul disposition. Come on and play me A hand of russian bank. I don't know how. What's the matter? Nothing really. It's because I'm so glad. Last night, He came back for me. Not because he had to, But-- but because He wanted to. His face was so tired And so kind. He was glad too. I could tell. And he tried to smile, But he was too worn out. He just fell asleep in my arms Like a little boy. I felt he belonged to me. I never wanted The night to end. You have got it badly, Haven't you? I suppose so. What's that? They're dynamiting Part of the city. You know what you've picked out For yourself, don't you? Yes. Then there's no use Warning you. No. Look here. You don't Expect him to marry you? Well, not unless He wants to. Of course, if he would-- But I'll do Whatever he wants. Tom's been a selfish brute All his life. What would you do If you were in my place? I wouldn't be in your place. I'd never let any man Mean that much to me. Look here. You're a nice child. I'll do anything I can To help you. If I only had a black eight. Hello! Hey! Come on there. Hey! Hey! Come on there. Hey! Hey! Well, what's this-- Barnum & bailey's Come to town? Well! Oh, my! You're all right, eh? What's this, an invasion? I'm afraid we'll have To turn our place Into a barracks. So many of the children Were left homeless. Well, there's always room For a few more. Come on in, kids. Come on. Come on, children. Right this way. Come on in. Hurry up now. My goodness. Come in, come in. Well, say-- You'll have to do Some foragin' for me. I didn't expect to have To feed an army. Miss Simon, take 'em out And show 'em where To clean up. Out. Out. Hurry up now. Go on out there. Well. That's it. I bet you got Your feet wet. Ma, don't worry. I'm all right. Let me see. Just as I thought. You sit Right down in that chair And change your socks. Eh, all right. Oh. Wait a minute. I have a message for fern. There. You're to come back With me, eh? I'll get my coat. Worst mess I've ever heard of. Are you ready? Every bed In the hospital's filled... And not half enough Doctors and nurses To go around. Ah. The maharani's Sent out a call For volunteers. Good-bye, Edwina. Good-bye, fern. Did you ever Ride an elephant? Next, please. Your name? Sibabhai. Experience? High school training In hospital work. Report to miss ghose, Second floor. Next, please. Your name? Edwina Esketh. Oh. Experience? No experience. Assigned to probational duty. Wait over there, please. Next, please. Your name? Tarabai. Experience? Yes. All right. Take him away. Thank you, captain. Yes. What is she doing here? She volunteered. Why is she doing That kind of work? She's had no experience. Lady Esketh is a very Intelligent woman. She's not stupid. It might be worth your time To give her some Quick training. She ought to be capable Of ward duty. Yes, major. Wait. I'll do that for you. Thank you. It is heavy. Get your tray, And we'll make the rounds. Laying a hand on their head Doesn't really help much, Except that It gives them courage. You see, they know I'm of high caste. For centuries, they've been Made to step aside... So their shadows Won't fall on us And pollute us. Call the porters. They look at you so, As if they trusted you. They have no one else To trust. You've done a wonderful thing Coming here like this. And it isn't easy, Especially if you've Never done it before. It's funny how you Get used to things. I don't even Get sick anymore... As I did 20 times The first day. And yet you stayed. Yes. I stayed. Why? You don't have to answer. Just remember that you're In constant danger. Don't forget to use Plenty of disinfectant. We mustn't let anything Happen to you. You're too valuable. Mr. Durga. We've had a call from The hospital for more linen And 250 pairs of sheets. This will give you authority To take what you want from The rajputana textile company. If Mr. Motilal, the manager, Objects, send him to me. Yes, sahib. And I shall introduce him To my pet lions, who will Feed on his liver. - yes, sahib. I bring the brandy, sahib. Aha. The brandy. No, no. Take it over To the hospital. All of it? Yes, all of it. Yes, sahib. But don't think I'm reforming. When this is over, I'm going On the biggest, longest, Most magnificent bat In the history of civilization. Make a note of that. Yes, Mr. Ransome. It's good to see you, General. I came as soon as the weather Was clear enough for flying. Your highness, the viceroy Has asked me to convey to you His deepest sympathy, Not only in his official Capacity, but as an old And sorrowing friend. May I add my own. I am grateful To the viceroy. But more than sympathy, I need cooperation. His excellency also asked me To assure you... That the british government Stands ready to help In any way it can. Thank you, general. I knew I could count On the viceroy And yourself. I take off in the morning To make a personal report To his excellency. Oh, by the way, I have room For one passenger, If there's anyone You care to send. Yes, I think there is. Ransome, I'd like To speak to you. Yes, your highness. Thank you, general. I'll let you know. Thank you. What is lady Esketh Doing at the hospital? Every conceivable filthy And drudging task. Yes. I suppose miss macdaid Would have seen to that. But why is she there? She told me She wanted to help. But that isn't The real reason. No. The english Are an odd people. I admire them, But I don't pretend To understand them. The english Are a sentimental people And very much ashamed of it. We had plans For major Safti, He and I. I won't be here long. I have no children, Though I always wanted them. Before he died, He named his successor-- A man whose blood, Sympathies and training... Fitted him For the responsibility... Of guiding the state Of Ranchipur. Did you know that? No. No alien influence Must enter his life. He must remain dedicated To his cause. Would it hurt him so much To give her up? For a while, yes. But he's young. He'll get over it, I'm sure. I want to do The right thing. I'd trample her Without mercy. But then, of course, I was brought up In the hills... Where charity Is a sign of weakness. I only learned tolerance And humanity... After I married. I want to do As he would have done. She is a bad woman, Isn't she? Mm, not so much bad As unhappy. Once, long ago, Edwina Took a wrong path. Ever since, she's either Been too proud... Or too stubborn To turn back. - in many respects, She's like your highness. - what do you mean by that? Well, that she's outspoken, Intelligent, Has no particular use For any other women-- Uh, unless they're over 70. But your highness Is the younger of the two. Her kind of civilization Is on its way out. That's exactly What makes it impossible. Tell her I'm sending her On the plane Tomorrow. How long since you've Been to bed? Oh, perhaps a day or two. I don't remember. After you've seen lady Esketh, Get some sleep. You've been a real help. Believe me. Come in. Hello, Tom. Hello. Ever try to curl your hair Without a curling iron? No. Alcohol's a precious Commodity these days, Not to be used For purposes Of mere vanity. Sit down-- On sataya's bed. She's my roommate-- A nautch dancer. I've been hearing Dreadful things about you. It seems you've become A shockingly useful Citizen. Can't help myself. It's a conspiracy. Why so glum? Why so cheerful? Mm, I'm young again. That's why. Mm. I feel exactly as I did The day of my first Real dancing party, When I was 12. I remember I had A pink taffeta dress. Hideous thing really, But I thought It was a love. And that little beast Of a joe cumberland-- The one that's in The cabinet now-- Mm-hmm. Spilled strawberry jam On it. I tried To scratch his eyes out. The authorities Intervened. Edwina? I'm afraid I've come to spill jam On your party dress. What do you mean? The maharani is sending you Away in the morning. No. I won't go. You'd better. She means it. No, Tom. I've thought it all out, And this time I know I'm right. I must be right. Believe me, Tom. I'm in love for the first Time in my life-- Completely, Honestly in love. I believe you. So you can tell The maharani I won't go. Yeah. She'll probably Have you shot. She can, you know. I'll risk it. And will you risk Destroying him? I won't destroy him. He loves me. I'm sure of it. That's why you must go. Let's try to look At this thing realistically. The maharani's Giving Rama his choice. He can have Ranchipur or you. He can't have both. You're asking me to give up The only real chance For happiness I've ever had. Don't get me started. I hate scenes. Ah. 6:00. I'm on duty. Cheerio, Tom. You've done your duty Like a good little soldier. Coolie. Coolie. The glass. Good morning. I couldn't sleep. I had to come And talk to you. Listen. Ah, that's a good sign. It means that life Is going on again. It means we're going to win. Last night, for the first time, There were fewer new cases Instead of more. You look tired. I'm not really. This is the only chance we have To talk to each other. It wasn't true what I said About not being able to sleep. I set the alarm clock. You shouldn't. You get little enough rest. There are all kinds of rest. This is better than sleeping. Tom tells me That you're leaving today. Yes. By request. It's probably just as well. I go through torture Every moment... Because you're in danger here. Nothing must happen To you now. Rama. What's the matter? Nothing. It just makes me so happy To hear you say that. I never thought, When I first met you-- It seems so long ago-- That you'd ever say Anything like that to me. I wouldn't have Said it then, Not to the woman I knew then. But now I-- I think You're someone different. Please don't think that I'm just Being mystical and Indian, But... I can't connect you With her-- That woman I met At the summer palace, So shiny and glossy And so crafty For what she wanted. Oh, yes, I-- I knew what you wanted. And I was tempted. That's why I stayed for a cup Of lukewarm tea, which I hate. And you were trying so hard To make me believe... You were respectable And inexperienced. Wait. I-- I don't think Much of respectability. I think a great deal more Of truth. Maybe that's why I hesitated then. And later, when I pretended I didn't find you exciting. Something held me back. I must have seen The other woman within you-- The one that came here, Scrubbed floors And emptied slop pails... And fought nausea And weariness and fear-- The real woman. You see, it would have been Like taking a counterfeit... Instead of waiting For the real coin. I wanted you to know What I felt because I-- I think so much of you That I can risk making A fool of myself. Maybe, in your heart, You're laughing at me. No. No. Well, now you know my secret. We'll let the maharani Send you away. Then when the worst Is over here, No matter where you are, I'll come after you. You'd leave Ranchipur? Yes. Yes. We'll go to some other city Where I can set up a practice-- Calcutta, madras Or the malay states-- Where we can live Our own lives together. You'd leave all this, Knowing what it's meant To you? Knowing what you do of me? No. Just hold me A little while. Edwina. You're not well. You-- You have a fever. No. No. I-- I'm just tired. Take over in the ward. How is she? Rama's with her now. She sent word She wanted to see me. Yes, I know. I want to give her Another injection In about half an hour. Yes, major. Miss Simon, You may go in now. I don't know what to do, Tom. I don't know what to do. She won't fight. She hasn't any will to live. I don't know what to do. Steady. I'm supposed To be a doctor. I'm supposed to help people To fight for life. And I want her to live More than I want To live myself. I tried to tell her That she must fight. I-- I couldn't. I couldn't speak. I'm all gone inside. Stay with me, Tom. I need you. Rama, this won't do. You've got to get A hold of yourself. It's no use. I-- I can't. We're different-- Deep down where it matters. I'm an Indian. I-- I can't be Calm and unemotional. I want to tear my clothes And wail like a-- Like Bannerjee. You're not Bannerjee. You're a man. You're a doctor. No. No. I've failed. I can't save her. Rama. Rama. Rama! Listen to me. If you lose your way now, You'll never find it again. Think of the maharani And your duty, Of the maharajah And all he planned for you. Think of the people Who worship and respect you. To them, you're a symbol-- Something clean and courageous, That's been born in the darkness And filth that was India. You are India-- The new India. Don't betray all of us Who have faith in you. I'm sorry, Tom. I'm all right now. It won't happen again. Thank you. But I can't take them. Don't be an idiot. If you and Tom Have children, Your son might be The earl of nolham. He'd have a wife, And she could wear them To boring dinner parties, Tell how they'd been Left to her by... A shameless wench Called lady Esketh... Who died in Ranchipur During the great disaster Of 1938. We're such snobs at home. We like stories like that. I suppose this is the way It feels to repent And get religion-- Giving away My worldly goods. Anyway, It's a nice feeling. Hello, Tom. Don't look so unhappy. I'm not. Rama says if you'd only fight. What's there to fight about? Has anything changed since The last time we talked? Would you mind, my dear? Have you got a ring For fern? Does she like sapphires? There's a condition Attached. You'll have to marry her. You said You'd do anything. Yes, but I'd be No good for her. Oh. Stop bragging. She's mad about you. She thinks you're a god. That's what You've always wanted. We have had such foul luck, You and I. But... You've picked a winner At last. Ask him to come in. As soon as you're well, We'll get away from all this. Of course. I've thought it all out. We won't be running away From anything, Because there won't be Anybody else in the world But ourselves. We'll have each other. Yes. Just you and I. Up to kashmir, Down the ganges to bengal. And then perhaps In a little boat From calcutta... Through all the islands Of the east. The spice islands, The coral islands... And all those places with names Like magic spells. Just you and I. Nothing else will matter, Will it? Will it? Edwina. Edwina. Edwina. This time, it has been Built to stand-- As long as you live... And your children... And your children's children. The time is here, Rama. Your people are waiting. What is it, Rama? What do you hear? Nothing, your highness. Only a song. They're waiting, Rama.

You're telling me? Well, of course, I'm not a lawyer. I'm in the Kiddie Kar business. I don't know much about contracts... but it looks good to me. It's the biggest contract I ever signed. Thanks to you, Mr. Dillon. Aw, you could have your choice of a dozen shows. A pretty girl like you. Not with this depression. If not for you and your Kiddie Kars... Oh, now, Miss Brock... Dorothy, I mean. You don't mind my calling you Dorothy, do you? Why, of course not. Well, Dorothy, I'd like to do something for you. You've done entirely too much for me already... and I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it. No, no. I mean... I mean, I'd like to do something for you... if you'd do something for me. Why, Mr. Dillon, of course I'd be very glad to... but what could I possibly do for a big man like you? Call me Abner. When we got Dorothy Brock, we got a great break. Abner Dillon guarantees to finance anything she does. These days, stars like Dorothy Brock are a dime a dozen. That's what we got you for. Julian Marsh, the greatest musical comedy director in America today. What do you mean, today? All right, tomorrow too. Say, with your reputation... Did you ever try to cash a reputation at a bank? I'm in this for one reason only: Money. Money? You? With all your hits, you ought to be worth plenty. I ought to be, but I'm not. Did you ever hear of Wall Street? Excuse me, Mr. Marsh, there's a phone call for you. A Dr. Chadwick. - I'll call him back. - He says it's urgent. About your examination. Use our private phone, Julian. What is it, doc? You have? Good Lord, you're not a machine! That body of yours will stand just so much. There's no other way. You're not just headed for another nervous breakdown. Any undue strain on your part might easily prove fatal. Sorry, doc, but I've got to risk it. Anything wrong? - You won't have another breakdown? - The contract's signed. - That doesn't matter. - That's all right. It holds. You'll get your Pretty Lady. You haven't got anything to worry about. I'm not gonna let you down... because I can't afford to. I've given everything I've had to that gulch down there. It paid me, sure, in money I couldn't hang on to... fair-weather friends, women, headlines. Why, even the cops and the newsboys recognize me on sight. ""Marsh the Magnificent."" ""Marsh the Slave Driver."" Actors tell you how Marsh drove them, bullied them... and tore it out of them. A few would tell you how Marsh made them. They've all got something to show, except Marsh. Well, this is my last shot. I'll make more actors, but this time I'll sock my money away so hard... they'll have to blast to find enough to buy a newspaper. That's why I'm going ahead with Pretty Lady. Pretty Lady has to be a hit. It's my last show, and it's got to be my best. You're counting on me. I'm counting on Pretty Lady... because it's got to support me for a long time. - Wait! - Remember... my contract makes me boss with a capital B. What I say, goes. Now, make the chorus call for 10:00 tomorrow. He'll drive us crazy before we get this show on. Yeah, but suppose that guy should pass out on us? New York will see its first triple funeral. Good morning. Mr. Marsh will be here soon. Quiet now. Quiet, please! Quiet, everybody, quiet! Hello, Jerry. How are you? Hello, Andy. It's too good to be true. How's the turnout, Mac? About 50-50. Half are dumb and the other half are dumber. Andy! Hello. He's so busy. - Lorraine has been hitting the bottle. - The peroxide bottle. You wanna get me canned? You're set, you're in. Now scram. Darling, you're just too sweet, the way you keep spoiling me. I beg your pardon. It's okay. This is a two-way street. I beg your pardon. But are you, by any chance, the? What is the word? The stage manager? Hey, Ann, come out from under that accent. I see you. Lolly! Darling. You remember Ann Lowell? Not Anytime Annie? Who could forget her? She only said no once, when she didn't hear the question. You been abroad? Andy? Where's Andy Lee? Yes, Mr. Marsh. Coming right up. - Good morning, Mr. Marsh. - Good morning. - Line them up. - Yes, sir. Okay, girls, line up. Come on. Quiet, now. Quiet! Come on, now. Quiet, girls. I want all the dancers to line up and double-lined out front. Showgirls can double-line in back of them and the boys in back of them. Don't spread out! Come on, girls, hurry up. I really had a charming summer in Deauville, dear. Yes, but don't you find Sir George impossible at times? Get a load of ""Minnie the Mountaineer."" It must have been tough on your mother, not having any children. That's telling them. Oh, dear. You looking for somebody, or just shopping around? Where will I find the gentleman in charge? First door to your left, dearie. I know, but... - He's expecting you. - But that's the... Our mistake. The other door. - Oh. - Hey, wait a minute. Hey, what's the idea? Oh... They said... Weren't you expecting me? Well, not exactly, but I'm afraid you'll do. Well, I don't understand. I don't either. What are you looking for? Well, isn't this the...? Wait till I get my clothes on. I'll show you where it is. It isn't an ""it,"" it's a ""he."" Maybe I'm wrong about the whole thing. Let's start over again. I'm Billy Lawler, one of Broadway's better juveniles. Oh. I thought you were important. That's the way most people feel about juveniles. Only most of them aren't so frank about it. - You're new to show business? - Oh, I've had experience. - How many shows? - Why, any number of them. - Come on, now. - To tell you the truth... I want the truth. This'll be my first, if they take me. If they take you? Say, you can't miss. I'll take you in myself. I'll steer you right up to the stage director. Come on, let's go. A short order of ham, coming out. Not good, but loud. Honey, take a good look at them now. Because after they make that back line, you won't see them again. If it isn't Little Lord Fauntleroy and the village maiden. Just a minute. Where are you headed, sister? - She wants to see Marsh. - That'll make Marsh's day perfect. Come on, girls, inside. There's the boss right there. His name is Julian Marsh. He's the fellow with the light green felt hat. Go over and talk to him. Quit shoving. Lift the skirts up a little higher. Come on, come on. Afraid I got a run. - First door to your left. - In my stocking. First offense? Yes, but I don't think I ought to tell them that. No, of course not. And they'll never guess. Do you think I'll do? I only know what I read in the papers, but you look all right to me. - Andy! Get the first eight girls. - Yes, sir. Will the first eight girls line up here? The first eight girls line up down in front. Come on. Now lift your dresses up. Come on, higher. I want to see the legs. Yeah, they got pretty faces too. Turn around. Come on, turn around! Oh, dear, not a calf in a carload. - Get the next eight. - Next eight, come on. Stick with us, and you'll come in on the tide. - Hurry up, hurry up. - Line up, girls. Hurry up, girls. Lift your dresses up. - Do you mind holding Fifi for me? - Turn around now, please. All right, back. Three! Okay those three on the left. If I were you, I'd keep them. I suppose if I don't, you'll have to. Lorraine again? Andy, you're a panic. All right, have it your way. Mac, okay by special request of the copyright owner. - All right, next eight. Hurry up. - Next eight girls. What's yours? Diane Lorrimer. 333 Park Avenue. And is her homework tough! Next. - Adams! - Here. - Kipling! - Here. - Andy. - What's the matter? Well, what is it, what is it? What's the matter now? Must have been a slip-up someplace. We're a girl short. Well, that's great. Just great! We also need a dance director who can count to 40 without a pad and pencil. - Mr. Marsh... - Well, do something! Get another girl. Are you gonna stand there and shake a blond out your pantlegs? Yeah, but Mr. Marsh... - I don't want to butt in... - A lot of people are like that. - I'll have one here in the morning. - That's ducky. I can hardly wait. Mr. Marsh, you don't have to wait. And she's a swell dancer too. You picked her, but she got eliminated the third time through. - Come out from behind there. - You, with the legs! Come out of there. Quiet! Quiet, please! - Quiet, please! - Quiet, please! Well, I'm a... Hey, kid! Hey, you! Hey, come on, get up. - The boss wants to see you again. - Who? Me? Come on, come on. All right, she'll do. They're all yours, Andy. All right, get in line. All right, now, everybody. Quiet, and listen to me. Tomorrow morning, we're gonna start a show. We'll rehearse for five weeks, and we'll open on scheduled time... and I mean, scheduled time. You'll work and sweat and work some more. You'll work days and nights... and you'll work between time, when I think you need it. You'll dance until your feet fall off and you can't stand up... but five weeks from now, we're going to have a show. Some of you have been with me before. You know it'll be tough. It'll be the toughest five weeks that you ever lived through. Do you all get that? Anybody who doesn't think he'll like it, better quit right now. What do I hear? Nobody? Good. Then that's settled. We start tomorrow morning. All right, 10:00 tomorrow morning, we start with the lyrics. In practice clothes. What did I tell him? This is what I told him: ""No, I won't run your stage for that money."" Great. You beat Jerry to the finish by two lengths. All right, take your positions. We'll try those routines again. Quiet! Where do you think you are, home? I get back to New York and I get this wire. Come on, kids, make it snappy. All right, Jerry, let's go! Dorothy, that's your cue. Things can never be the same now. I beg your pardon, but would you mind saying: ""Things can never be the same now""? - That's what I said. - You did not. You said, ""Things can never be the same now."" - I did not. - You did. - Who's directing this show? - She's reading my lines wrong. - I am not. - What did you say? I said, ""Things can never be the same now."" That's right. Things can never be the same now. The scene ends with you on the steps, and you go into the number. That's where you take his hand. The scene ends with you two on the steps, and we go into the duet. - Hello. - Hi. - You're doing fine for a beginner. - Well, thanks. I'm trying. I was so scared that first day, I walked around the block four times... before I had the courage to even come and apply for this job. It's tough, but you'll get along. Well, I wouldn't mind, if I could only get that routine set. I'll show you those taps. Come on with me. Taps? Say, I can do a tap dance on my ear. What bothers me is that routine. Then I'm just what the doctor ordered. Come along. Now, look. Cross over. You're gluttons for punishment. Well, Mr... Well, this boy's showing me. - I was trying to make her... - Trying to make her is right. We'll just let that pass. Now try it again. - Where you sitting? - On a flagpole, dearie. On a flagpole. I always said she was a nice girl. She's so good to her mother. She sure is. She makes $45 a week and sends her mother 100 of it. Get some feeling into it, will you? What do you want me to do, bite my nails? You've got the busiest hands. Wait a minute, wait a minute! It's out. That'll be enough of that. It smells. You don't like this number? Sure, I like it. I've liked it since 1905. You think this is a revival? - It's out. The whole number! - This number will be a riot. That's what I'm afraid of. Dismiss. An hour for lunch. All right, everybody. One hour for lunch. Waiting long, darling? Well, long enough. My, but we're grouchy, aren't we? - Oh, no, not that, but... - What? I'm getting tired of this hiding in doorways... sneaking in and out of places and keeping under cover. Why, I'm beginning to feel like a criminal. There's nothing criminal in that, is there? No, there's nothing criminal in that. I thought we'd better tell you, it looks like we're in trouble. That word has a familiar sound. Are you married too? This is serious, Julian. Serious? Did you ever leave your wife... sitting alone in a nightclub, holding the check? You know Abner Dillon's putting up the bankroll for our show. I knew he wasn't here because you liked his face. I don't like his face or any part of him. He looks like a Bulgarian boll weevil mourning its first-born. Well, his interest in our show is Dorothy Brock. And his interest is our principal. Very good. Very, very good. Even I was able to gather that much. Yes? Well, we stand a first-rate chance of having him... withdraw his financial support. Now, did you gather that? But why? Because dear Miss Brock is two-timing Abner right under his very nose. Who with? With a fellow who used to be her partner in vaudeville. She's come up in the business, he hangs around. He's been out of town and just got back last week. If Dillon finds out... And if he doesn't, he's dumber than I thought... Well, now, wait. Nobody could be as dumb as all that. He'll just walk out on us and we'll be sunk, that's what... if we don't do something. Tried applying dough to the problem? Give the Romeo 100 bucks. Get him out of the way. We might try using a little flint. You don't know this guy Denning. That's his name. Pat Denning. He's not the kind of guy that gets sent places just like that. Oh, no, he gets train-sick. Oh, I see. Hard-boiled? Well, it's going to be just too bad... - ...but nobody's gonna ruin my show. - What'll you do? I'll talk it over with Murphy, a friend of mine from downtown. - Slim Murphy? - Yeah. Murphy will kill him. That'll teach him a good lesson. I don't want to be mixed up with Murphy or any other gangsters. No? One man's meat is another man's Murphy. I told you what this show means to me. Well, this is what it does mean. Hello, Murphy? This is Julian Marsh. Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Listen to me. You gotta do me a favor. Did you ever hear of Dorothy Brock? Good, that makes it so much easier. Well, listen to me and get this. It seems there's a certain guy by the name of Denning. D-E-N... N-I-N-G. I got you, Mr. Marsh. Sure. Hey, pipe down! What do you think I got on, earphones? It's as good as done. Say, you ain't gonna forget me on ducats for the new show, are you? Thattaboy! Okay. Not another nickel, honey. Just can't be done anymore, that's all. Pat, don't be silly. We've always shared and shared alike, haven't we? What's come over you? Getting a sudden attack of manhood, possibly. Let's quit kidding ourselves. I'm a regular anchor around your neck. - You're not. - I am. Besides, never being able to see you... except when nobody's looking is getting me down. But, darling, I owe everything I am to you. It was you and that act of ours that started me in all this. Why, you trained me and coached me and taught me all I know. I was pretty dumb too. - I haven't forgotten. - The act? It was grand, Pat. Really grand. - It was terrible. - You didn't think so then. You mean I didn't say so then. Oh, Dot, you've gone ahead. You've earned it. I've stayed behind where I belong, I guess. You've kept yourself behind. Nothing of the sort. They wanted you. They never wanted me. Besides, I've been getting myself some education... and they have a name for a man who doesn't work... who accepts money from a woman. It isn't a very nice name. - Darling, you're talking like a child. - No, I'm not. - There isn't any other reason, is there? - No. - Sure? - Sure, I'm sure. It's late. I'll take you home. Keep the change. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - I wish you didn't feel that way. - So do I, but I do. Watch your tempo! Watch it, will you? Get your feet off the floor. Faster, faster! Come on, faster! Faster! Stop it, stop it, stop it! It's brutal! Oh! May I remind you that Pretty Lady's out-of-town opening is not far away? It's been advertised as a musical comedy with dancing! If it isn't asking too much, will you please show me a little? All right, once again. Give it something! Come on. Ready, Jerry? Get into it now. Come on! Having fun? After three weeks, a leg ain't nothing to me... but something to stand on. Let me hear your number, Dorothy. Come on, Jerry. The ""Habit"" number. Jerry, put it up a half tone, will you? Doesn't she sing gorgeous? Seventy thousand bucks. Watch this, honey. I may want you to understudy her. All right, okay. Come on, folks, get ready for the duet number. Start up. Okay, Jerry, let's go. Come on, faster! Faster, Jerry, faster! What's the matter with you? - You all right, kid? - I guess so. Come on, faster. Faster! Peggy! - Stand back! Get back in line. - She's fainted. Come on now, places. This is a rehearsal, not a rest cue. Mac, take her outside. Hurry up. Come on, everybody. All right, come on, get back. Jerry, let's go. Come on, pick it up! - Here, sir. - Thank you. - Hold your places! - Lawler, inside. - The girl's okay. - You feel better, honey? I guess I fainted. That's a good guess. Well, I guess I'm all right now. Woo. Bad guess. Better sit down again. Now listen, you let me play now. What would you suggest, doctor? A little fresh air and conversation. What about Mr. Marsh? Never mind Mr. Marsh. Let's sit this dance out. And if I lose my job? If you do, there just won't be any show. Anyway, it's a nice idea. I've got a lot of nice ideas. What I need are ears to spill them in. Well, won't mine do? Yes, you know, I think they'd do very, very nicely. When are your ears available? At all sorts of odd hours. You must look them up sometime. Remind me to tell you you're swell. - That's all for tonight. - All right, dismissed, girls. Well, thanks, doctor. Your prescription was great. Now for the workshop. You gotta take it daily to really do any good. It'll have to be absent treatment, I'm afraid. At least for the time being. - Good night. - Bye. - Good night, Jimmy. - Good night. Coming, Abner? Dorothy, where will we eat? You know, Abner, I'm not a bit hungry. - But I'm all dressed for dinner. - Oh, yes, so you are. I'll get the car. - Dorothy, the car's here. - Yes, Abner. Why, doctor, you must like it here. I'm beginning to. I'm not the doctor anymore, you are. I've become the patient, and I'd like a little advice. Very well, but you might tell the doctor your name. I couldn't do that, but my initials are Pat Denning. What do you advise for a man who's both hungry and lonesome? - Company. - Excellent. Did you have anyone in mind? - Did you? - Will you? - I'm very much afraid I will. - Good. Good night, Pat. It was a wonderful evening. - I'll see you again? - I hope so. - Good. - Good night. Hey, got a match? Yep. I guess so. Happen to know a guy named Pat Denning? - Why, yes. - We've got a message for him. This guy Denning's a pretty wise mug, but he ain't wise enough. If he don't lay off Dorothy Brock, it'll be just too bad... for Denning. Get me? - I'll tell him. - Yeah, well... Oh! - That's so you don't forget. - Pat! Pat! Pat. Who were they? - Friends with good advice. - Are you hurt? Not much. But, Pat, tell me what happened. Better let it drop. Besides, it's hardly a bedtime story for a nice girl like you. What do you think this is? Get that man out of here! - But, Mrs. Holt... - But nothing! I have eyes. Just because there's a depression on, some folks think I'll stand for it. But you don't know. After running a rooming house for 19 years, there's nothing I don't know. Now you get out, and no more talk! Then if he goes, I go too! Probably I'll be able to bear up under that blow too. Well... where do we go from here? - Hotel? - I suppose so. But it'll have to be inexpensive, as I only have a dollar and a half. - What about my place? - Broke? Not exactly. Not exactly flush either. Then I guess it's your place or a park bench. Here you are. That's better. Hand me your coat. Make yourself comfortable. Will you excuse me a minute? Rose-colored glasses. Let's see how the world looks. - Okay, doctor. - Here we go. - Things beginning to look any better? - A little bit. - Tired, aren't you? - Dead tired. And I feel just like beginning. You hop, step and jump as many miles as I have today... and you'd be tired too. Pat. Pat, what are you doing? Please put me down! Please, Pat. Please put me down. Now you go right to sleep, youngster. What you need is a good night's rest. Good night. - Oh, Pat. - Yes? Will you hand me my bag, please? - Oh, which one? - That one. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. What do you do when you've got left feet like mine? - Just pick them up and lay them down. - I'm doing the best I can. Get a load of the juvenile. Didn't know we had elephants in the show. Wait a minute, hold it! Hold it, Jerry! Some director's gonna jail you for taking money under false pretenses. You're supposed to be a dancer! You just need license plates to look like a Model T Ford. They've been going all night long... I'll keep them here if it takes a week! All right, get out! - Take the last eight bars. - Pick it up, Jerry. Pick it up, Jerry. - Hello, honey. - Oh, Dot, how are you? Oh, tea for two. Yeah. Friend of mine dropped in. Love me? I wonder. You're not going to get serious on me, are you? - You leaving town? - Yeah. Stock job in... Philadelphia. Oh, Pat, without telling me? Well, I thought it was the best way. Maybe you're right. Sit down, dear. I want to talk to you. I've done a lot of thinking since the other night. Pat, you know what's wrong with me, or rather, with us? We've grown too necessary to one another. You've been content in the shadows while I basked in the spotlight... simply because it's held us together. - My success has been your failure. - Well, dear... my failure, as you put it, has been my happiness. But, darling, you're capable of such great things. You're not a quitter. I've only wanted to help, but I've been hurting you instead. I realize that now. That's why I came here this morning. Pat. We're not going to see each other for a long time. No more doorways. No more secret meetings. You're going out on your own and make a success. You're right, Dot. But you know... somehow, I can't imagine going on without you. Nor I without you... but it's got to be. Yes, Dot. It's got to be. And maybe, someday... someplace? Maybe. Bye, Pat. Oh, Dot... I love you. Me too. Up! Up. Up. Up. Up. - How are you, Bluebeard? - Okay, just a touch of scarlet fever. Oh, that's fine. Maybe it'll develop into something serious. The curtain's just come down! It's the end! Is this what you call a finale? What is this? Amateur night? Have we been rehearsing for five weeks, or did I dream it? The show's ragged! - What do you mean, the show's ragged? - The numbers are ragged! May I remind all you shining lights that... this is the company that opens tomorrow night? I am in the right theater, am I not? This is the Pretty Lady company, isn't it? The all-star show that... opens in Philadelphia tomorrow night? - Philadelphia? - Quiet. Quiet! Philadelphia, PA. Yeah, and on Sundays, it's P-U. - Quiet! - Quiet! Julian... - ...you mean Atlantic City, don't you? - I mean Philadelphia. Train leaves at 1 p.m., Penn Station. Full dress rehearsal, 4:00. Arch Street Theater. But I don't want to go to Philadelphia. Who does? We couldn't get the house at Atlantic City. But why Philadelphia? Well, when you become stage director... we'll open in your apartment. But right now, it's Philadelphia. Of all the cities in the United States, he would pick Philadelphia. All right now, listen to me. We open at the Arch Street Theater tomorrow night. So this is Philadelphia! Why don't you stop that?! Peggy. - Getting a kick out of it? - Of course, you? I don't know. Do you suppose anybody'll even know I'm in the show? I will. Does it make any difference to you? Gee, Billy. I've been for you since that first day. Places, everybody. - I'll be seeing you. - Okay. You won't forget the modulation on the last eight bars. - You forgot your handkerchief. - Go ahead. Call those timers, hold them. - nice to the right people, you'll get along. When you walk downstage... just give it a little life. You know, sort of... Quiet! Please! Well, it's... not good, it's not bad. That's all for tonight. - Wait. - Hold it! Come back here, girls. I want you all to take your minds off the show. Get out and relax. Forget it till 10:00 tomorrow morning. I don't know. I think it'll do. But I want you to come back tomorrow... to give the best performance that you ever gave in your lives. Company dismissed. - Dismissed, girls. - Company dismissed! Go on out and have a good time. You really was elegant, Miss Brock. Pansy, did anyone telephone me? Phone? No, ma'am. Nobody at all. - You're sure? - I certainly is. Yes, ma'am, Miss Brock. - Have a little supper with me? - I would have. - But you thought of it too late. - I've been thinking of it all day. Well, I'm not a mind reader. I've got a date. Billy. - I'm free tomorrow night. - Then it's a date. - Okay. - Don't forget, now. I gotta get the stuff for the party. Do you mind? I'll see you at the hotel, room 1061, and make it snappy! She says for you to wait. She'll be out in just a minute. Oh. Good night, Mr. Marsh. I said, ""What is it? A duck?"" Andy, you're terrible. You know any more? I've got a lot more... Andy? - Yes, sir? - Go on, yes man. Papa give you liver. Shut up. This may be important. Oh, it can't be, darling. He's calling you. Hurry up! Oh. Sit down, Andy. Anything wrong, chief? Everything's wrong, Andy. No, you're a great director, Mr. Marsh. Maybe I was, but... right now I'm a sick man. They told me I was sick when I started, but I started anyway. Andy, I'm going to finish, and I'm gonna have a show. I know what they'll say. They'll like it. They've got to. ""Marsh is a wizard. He turns them out like clockwork. The guy isn't human. He's a machine."" Well, I'm not a machine, Andy. And for the first time, I'm counting on someone else. I've got to. I'm counting on you. And tomorrow night, we're gonna give them a show. The greatest show Julian Marsh ever put on. What are you doing? Got a date tonight? No. Come on home with me, will you? I'm lonesome. Sure. Taxi. Pat! What are you doing in Philadelphia? Got my passport and dropped over. - Business or pleasure? - I don't know yet, but it's a job. Say, what about one of those cozy midnight suppers one reads about? I've been hoping you'd come out. - Oh, dear, I have a date. - Well, break it. - I'd like to, but I can't. - Well, you can try. It's with the company and we open tomorrow. I really should be on hand. I understand. Let me drive you to the main event. All right. Taxi. Congress Hotel. Forget something, Dorothy? Oh, no. Congress Hotel. Oh, Abner. Isn't this car big enough for two? Move over. You ain't gonna have another spell, are you? I'm tired. Dress rehearsal is no picnic. - A little party'll do you good. - Yes. Don't just being with me cheer you up? Oh, tremendously. I'm practically hysterical right now. Oh, don't be afraid of me. I got strength. I used to be the intercollegiate champion hop, skip and jumper. - Come on now, hurry up. - Here I come. Give the little boy a big hand. Right across your big mouth. Please! I tell you, I don't even know my own strength. Wait a minute. Just look here. Oh, you're too, too divine. Tomorrow you've got to give a performance, not an exhibition. Well, you'd never know it from the manuscript. I beg your pardon. She's right. - Let's dance. - I don't want to. - Come on, I wanna dance. - Stop mauling me. Let me alone. You're not funny to me tonight. - I've got half a mind... - You're telling me. Do you wanna cramp your act? In a star, it's temperament, but in a chorus girl, it's just bad taste. What is this, target practice? Why can't you let me alone? Wisecracks, I'm sick of them! I'm tired of you. Tired of all of you, do you hear? Why, Dorothy. You know, you better hop on your Kiddie Kar and go back to Cleveland. Excuse me, it's the tight shoes. Shut up! - Where are you going? - Maybe she needs me. - Are you going to be a sucker for that? - Sucker! You listen to me. Seventy thousand dollars is a lot of money to pay for a pack of insults. So you've been calling me a sucker behind my back? Well, I ain't a sucker for anybody. Dorothy don't mean that to me! If not for me, she wouldn't have had a show to star in. She better not try to give me the air now. Now... So that's it, is it? You small-town big shot. - Now don't start... - Shut up! So I better not give you the air? Well, that's exactly what I'm giving you right now. Now get out of my room, you sucker! Get out! Try and make me! - Don't do that again! - Get out! Get out! No place for anybody whose insurance ain't paid. Wait for me. And the next time you come to a lady's apartment, act like a lady. Please! - Hello. - We've located Mr. Denning for you. Get him for me, will you? Oh, now what? Hello. - Hello, Dorothy. - Hello, Pat... Pat, I can't stand it any longer. I've gotta see you. - Yes, but... - Please don't ask me why. Just come quickly, please. All right, dear. I'll be right over. Come in. Sorry, Julian. More trouble. - What's up? - Dorothy's out of the show. Definitely, once and for all, she's out. Well, let me have it. What happened? She threw me out of her room. That's what. Now you want to throw her out. What is this? A game? - You can't do it. - Oh, no? Brock's in my show and that's final. If Dorothy stays in... this show don't open tomorrow night. That's final. Why, you potbellied sap. I resent that. You've sunk $70,000 already, and you're gonna toss that away... because of a dame? That's my funeral, ain't it? And the funeral of 200 other people: chorus girls, boys, electricians. You wouldn't be that mean, would you? Well, I think she ought to apologize. Why, of course she'll apologize. She'll be sorry by morning. I wish you wouldn't take it like this. Back in New York, they're calling you ""The Angel of Broadway."" No. - Sure. - Are they? Well... I guess maybe I can overlook it, if she apologizes. But it must be tonight. That's final. What's the matter? You don't seem to be warming up at all. Oh, don't, Terry! Please! Come on, this is no way to act. You've got me wrong, Terry. I'm not acting. I just don't like to be pawed, that's all. Come here, honey. Why, you don't know... - Must have been a fuse. - Yeah, a fuse named Charlie. Peggy! Peggy! Go get her, Terry! Come on, let's have another drink. - Going down? - No, sir. Up. Pat. Pat. If he cramps our show now... We fixed him once before, and we can do it again. Let's get Marsh. - What? - Mr. Denning. Is he here? - You know he is. What do you want? - Mr. Denning. Can't leave him alone for five minutes, can you? Please, Miss Brock. This is important. What's the matter? Oh, Pat, there's going to be trouble. I saw... Oh! So it's ""Pat"" to him, but it's ""Mr. Denning"" to me. You bet there's gonna be trouble. - Let's see what it's about. - I know what it's about! She's been spying on us. - Spying? I wasn't spying... - You were! You were peeking through the keyhole. You were, because I saw you. She's jealous. You want him, but you won't get him! - Wait a minute. - Wait for what? More spying and double-crossing? - Let me go! Let me... - Wait a minute. - Oh, Miss Brock! - Dorothy... You pushed me, didn't you? Dorothy, what's the matter with you? Oh, Pat. - My ankle. - What is it? My ankle. - Get the house doctor right away. - All right. Hello. Hello. Please send the house doctor to Miss Brock's apartment. Yes, thank you. Get her shoes off, quick. There, there, now. Oh... Pat, it's swelling. - Answer the door, it's the doctor. - All right. - You sent for me? - Yes, doctor. Right in there. - Oh, doctor. It's her ankle. - Which one? - A glass of water, please. - Yes, doctor. - Is your name Denning? - Yeah. I want to talk to you. Where is she? - She's had an accident. - What? She fell and twisted her ankle. It may be a break. What are you talking about? How bad is it? - Can't tell definitely. - Maybe it's only a sprain. Looks like a fracture. Can't tell till the x-rays are made. - Will she be able to go on tomorrow? - Go on? - She's got the show tomorrow night! - Not a chance. She's got to! Do something, doctor! Get her a pair of crutches. - Oh... - There, there. - Don't stand there gaping. - But... Oh, get out! Get out! - I still don't know why you're here. - If it was your business, I'd tell you. A broken ankle? It's too bad it wasn't her neck. May I have your attention? - Quiet, quiet! - Quiet, please! There'll be no performance tonight. Wait a minute. Wait! Our star, Miss Brock, has had an accident. She's broken her ankle. Don't leave the theater until you're dismissed. Get that, Andy? Hold the company here for further instructions. - Stick around, everybody. - Don't anybody leave the theater! You gotta think of something, someone. There must be some way out of this. Dillon just phoned. He's got everything fixed. - Up to and including Brock's ankle. - No, he's going through with it. He's going through with what? He found someone to take Brock's place, and he's on his way here with her now. - Where? - I don't know. Come on, Marsh. No such luck. Now, there's a Kiddie Kar I could really go for. Anytime Annie. Well, lay me low. Your new leading lady, folks. I guess I saved the day all right this time. We'd better go in and talk it over with Marsh. - You have a big investment in this show. - You're telling him? I appreciate your help, but she won't do. Sure! She didn't wanna do it at first, but I convinced her. She's all set. Why, she'll be sensational. - How about letting me talk? - All right. Let's quit kidding, Mr. Marsh. Abbie, all those things sounded swell at breakfast... but I can't carry this show. I know that as well as you do. I appreciate your honesty. Swell, because you've got somebody here who can carry your show. A great little trouper. Aren't I capable of selecting my own cast? But you'd never pick her. I say she can swing it. How can you lose? You gotta try her. - Who is she? - Sawyer. - Sawyer. - Yes, Peggy Sawyer. She can dance rings around Brock. Your show's half dancing. She'd kill them. Nobody ever heard of her. She's a raw kid from the chorus. Listen, I've been waiting years for a chance like this... and if I give it up to someone else, believe me, she's gotta be good. - Send her in. - Do you mean it? Yes, send her in. Mac! - Oh, Mac! - Here. - Andy! - Yes, sir. - Get Sawyer. - Yes, sir. - The boss wants to see you. - Who, me? Not your brother. Come on. - Lorraine, will you hold that? - Go ahead. Well, here she is. Experience? Just this show, Mr. Marsh. You know the songs and dances? Can you play the lead tonight? The lead? Sure, you can. Don't let him scare you. I'll give you a chance because I've got to. Andy, send Jerry in. I'll have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl. Get out of here. I don't want anybody in for the next five hours. - Good luck, honey. - Come on, you. Pick it up right after the number. There's your cue. Speak. Jim, they didn't tell me you were here. It was grand of you to come. No, it's impossible. Impossible. You're greeting the man you love. Your entrance speech! Make it mean something. Put feeling into it! Listen, like this: ""Jim, they didn't tell me you were here. It was grand of you to come."" Let me hear it. Jim, they didn't tell me you were here. It was grand of you to come. No, it won't do. Look, have you ever been in love? Did you ever have a man hold you in his arms and kiss you? Now you're in the spirit of the thing. You love this man. Now, give it all you've got. Let me hear it. Jim, they didn't tell me you were here. It was grand of you to come. That's better. Let me hear it from the beginning. Go over there and make your entrance again. All right. Jim, they didn't tell me you were here. It was grand of you to come. I can't! I can't... Look here. You can't, but you will. Please, Mr. Marsh. You want this chance or don't you? - All right. Let's try it again. - All right. All right, it's fair, only fair. Come in. Only an hour before the curtain. Okay, Jerry, that's all. You let me down, Sawyer, and I'll... Come on, lie down and relax. The wardrobe woman will have to come in to fit your costumes. But rest all you can, because you're definitely going on tonight. Julian, how about it? All right, the show goes on. Wardrobe, everybody. Everybody, makeup. - Oh, Billy. - Hello. I brought some coffee. You can use a little, huh? Oh, Billy, I'm so excited, I think maybe I'm dreaming. Oh, no, you're awake, all right. Don't worry about that. Billy, what's going to happen to me? You'll be a hit. You'll be the biggest thing that ever hit Broadway. Oh, I hope so. Say, I know so. And I'm for you too. You know that. Even if... Even if what? Oh, honey. I've been for you ever since the day you walked in on me in my BVDs. I wanted to tell you, ever since I first saw you, how I feel about you. Oh, I don't know how to say it. But you know what I mean, don't you? I guess it does sound kind of funny at that, the way I say it. But the lines are new for me, at least off-stage. Well, I guess maybe I can read between the lines, Billy... but I wanna hear you say some more. Billy, it was grand of you to come. - They told me I'd find you here. - Miss Brock! You can't talk to her, nobody can. It's Marsh's orders. I wanna see her alone. I know, but... It's all right, Billy. So you're going to take my place. I'm sorry, Miss Brock. You're nervous, aren't you? Well, don't be. The customers out there want to like you. Always remember that, kid. I've learned it from experience. And you've got so much to give them: Youth and beauty and freshness. Do you know your lines? And your songs? And your dance routine? Well, you're a cinch. But... But it's tough on you, Miss Brock. Come here. Peggy, isn't it? You know, Peggy, when I started for the theater tonight... I wanted to tear your hair out. And then I started thinking. Well, after all, I've had my chance. And now it's your turn. I've had enough. For five years it's kept me away from the only thing I ever wanted. And a funny thing... a broken ankle was the thing that made me find it out. You know, Peggy, most anyone can have success with the proper breaks. As for me... I'll take Pat and vaudeville... or whatever goes with him. We're being married tomorrow. Oh, I'm so glad. Come in. You've gotta hurry, miss. Come right in, boys. Right over here. Overture, places, girls! I think it looks very nice now. Do I look all right? You look adorable. Now, go out there and be so swell that you'll make me hate you. Thanks. Remember, girls, I want a straight line all the way through. Marguerite, you're first. Give me a big smile. Get ready. All right, curtain. Come on, all right. Get Sawyer. When she comes out, I don't want any of you to say a word to her. Here she comes. All right, break up. Pay no attention to her.

Brother... I was once a sinner like you. I was a hog. I was a slave of the demon rum. A child of hell! Yes, sir. But I was saved by this ribbon. It raised me from a hog to a man. It can do the same for you. Raise your right hand and take the pledge. Brother, what do I see in your hand? Don't be a hog! Cast the enemy away! Bury demon rum in the waters of the mighty Mississippi! Fling it away, I say! I swear that henceforth... liquor shall never touch my lips. -Me too. -Bless you, brother. Bless you. Look at that. You see that? See that picture on there? Yeah, that's Pocahontas, the wonderful little... Indian woman. You know, you all know the story of Pocahontas. You know? That saved John Smith's life, you know? Well, John Smith wanted to get this remedy from... Pocahontas, you know? Course, it's just made out of pure roots and herbs... that she picked up on the hillside. But she wouldn't give him this remedy. He couldn't get it. He had to marry her to get it. Oh, yes, he did. He had to marry her to get the remedy. And that's how it got into the Smith family. And that's been handed down from generation to generation... from Smith to Smith right on down... and that's how it come clear down to me. -My great-grandmother was a Smith. -Mine too, Doc! I doubt it. Say, lookee here. Lookee here, my friend. You don't look good. Now, you are ill. You are sick, and you don't know it. Well, l-I do feel kind of bad, Doc. I knew it. I could just look at you- Would you mind stepping up here? Just get up here on the platform, will ya? Now, you folks know that this man is no confederate of mine. I never saw him before. Now, along in the spring, just about the time... you should go to plowin'... why, you feel kind of tired, don't you? You're right, Doc. And you know that I'm right, don't you? You know what that is? That's spring sickness,... that's what it is. It's spring sickness, and the only thing that'll cure... that is Pocahontas. Pocahontas. You know, the main thing about Pocahontas is... that you can't do a tap of work... you're not allowed to turn a hand until the whole bottle is empty. You mean, I can't even sharpen the ax for the old woman to cut wood? Why, you can't even hitch up the mules for her. I'll take a bottle, Doc. Its 50 cents a bottle. l-I haven't got change for... that dollar here. You don't mind just takin' another bottle, do you? Because, you know, you're gonna be tired during the summer... and that'll carry you over till I get back. Now, who else wants a bottle? You don't have to work. You can lay off anytime. I've got a few. Complete relaxation while you're taking it. Here you are. Who'll have another bottle here? Hey, Doc, let me have one of them two bits. Im awful sorry, lady. I haven't got any more of... the 10-cent ones. They're all 25 cents, ma'am. I didn't have enough. There you are. Who'll have another? -Morning, Captain Eli. -Hello, Doc. Make yourself at home. Say, what in thunder are you doin'? Im just teaching you how to salute my boat. The Claremore Queen. Look at her layin' over there. Yeah. Give her two more toots. Say, that's four. -That's a-That's a double salute. -No. Just honoring the unburied dead, that's all. Yeah, don't-don't try to poke any fun at that. Duke and I just bought it. We saved up every nickel we got to get that boat. Duke? That's your nephew, ain't it? You bet your life. And he's a great boy, Duke. I thought he was pilot on the Memphis Girl. Well, he was. He's the main pilot on there. But not no more. He's making his last trip... and then he's comin' right on there with me. You stick to doctoring. You ain't no steamboat man. Cramp her, Mink. Cramp her. Ill take her, Mink. Well, admittin' Duke's a pretty good boy... what could you do on a steamboat? Well, Im just gonna sit up in the pilot's house... and toot the whistle and listen to that old river sing. The way you brag, I suppose... you're fixin' to stick that old apple crate yonder... in the big race to Baton Rouge this summer. I never had thought of that. But that's an idea at that. You know, the Claremore Queen won that race in '84. And with... And with Duke as a pilot... Ill bet she could win it again. I suppose you'd like to bet your boat against my boat... on the result of that race, huh? Well, l-I don't know. Well, Ill bet you at that. Ill bet you. You made yourself a bet and lost yourself a steamboat. Come up and get it. Come on. Good-bye, folks. Good-bye. Ain't you gonna stay ashore here with us, brother? The devil's pretty active around these parts. Nay, brother. The Lord's a-callin' me up the river. Gotta wrestle with the captain of the Memphis Girl. He's backslid. Well, durn my britches! The Memphis Girl, huh? Say, Ive got a nephew works on that boat. You need anybody to help you wrestle with the devil,... he'll help you. He's the best wrestler in this whole country. His name's Duke. Duke's his name. Yes, sir. He's pilot of the boat. Thank you, brother. Ill fetch him the word. You tell him to hurry on down here. I ain't... any man to be kept waitin'. Good-bye, brother. Keep the faith. You can count on me, Moses. I ain't got no more use for liquor. Hey, Doc! That's two bottles you got. Cost you a dollar. I ain't got any money, Doc, but I can work it out. -'Work it out.' What can you do? -Steamboat engineer. Yeah? Steamboat engineer? Are you an engineer? Huh? Say, boy, you just drunk yourself into a job. Come on in here. Well, engineer, what do you think of it? Kind of looks as though a lot of rats have to... find themselves a new hole. Well, of course it don't look so good right now. But you got to remember that... Well, a steamboat... is a female, you know? And when they're struttin' up and down the river where... everybody's lookin' at 'em... they're just like a woman with a new Easter bonnet on. But when nobody ain't lookin' at 'em, why... they get kind of careless and don't care. -Yeah-sloppy. -Sloppy. That's right. But with a-with a good, live man on this boat like you are... say, you can make this thing perk up and strut. Get some paint on her nose and get these chickens out of here. We can put them right in the pot now. Here. Here. Start flirtin' with that. But, Doc, you told me yourself that a... man couldn't do a lick of work when he's on Pocahontas. Oh, that's the first bottle. But after that... you've got to work to get the best results out of it. Now, hurry up. Duke's gonna be here any day now... and he'll be here. Ooh! Look at that. It says 'Captain.' It says 'Captain' on it. Ain't that great? Oh, uh-Oh, no. No, no. Now, listen. We'll find a sign painter up the... river somewhere... and Ill-we'll have 'Chief Engineer'... put on there, see? And if I have any room, you know... and you work good, we'll put 'First Mate.' Come on, now. Let's get goin'. Hurry up. That you, Duke? -Hello, Uncle John. -Hey, you're kind... of late, ain't you? I guess I am, Uncle John. Who-Who's that... This is Fleety Belle, Uncle John. She-She- She's a swamp gal, ain't she? Oh, I guess that's right. But... But there's some mighty fine people in the swamps. You're actin' awful queer, Duke. You done some thin' bad, ain't ya? Mighty bad, Uncle John. What'd you do? I killed a man. Well, was it on account of her you done it? Yes, sir. Can Fleety Belle sit down and get dry, Uncle John? Guess so. Half the Claremore Queen's yours, ain't it? Its all right, Fleety Belle. Uh, you all ain't had nothin' to eat, have you? I'd mighty like something for Fleety Belle. She's about worn out. I got- I got some hot coffee here. Ill get some bacon in a minute. Where'd you meet her? Well, there ain't much to tell. We was down at Blue Bottom Bayou back of... Hannan gettin' out timber. Some swamp people come along in their shanty boats. I used to wave at 'em, tryin' to be friends with 'em. But they'd never wave back or nothin'. Just make their womenfolk get indoors. First time I seen Fleety Belle, I... I thought she was a boy the way she was dressed. Well, I blowed my whistle... and-and she waved back. And her old man came out and gave her a whippin'. After that, I seen her pretty near every, day. Then her folks found out, and her old man gave... her a worse whippin; And that's why she run away. -Was it one of her kinfolks you killed? -No, sir. -It was Big Steve. -Who's he? Engineer on the Memphis Girl. When he found Fleety Belle on the steamboat... where I was hiding her... he started after her. You know I don't get mad easy, but... but when I do, it's like a-like a thorn tree... a-growin' and growin' inside of me, and- Well, we started in fightin'. He drawed a knife... and I picked up a chunk of stove wood and... throwed it at his hand. And he ducked right into it, and I knowed... by the way he fell that he was dead. Well, then, ain't nobody can say that that wasn't self-defense. -Did anybody see it? -Nobody but a-a preacher fella. -Calls hisself the New Moses. -I know 'im. I know him. He come up on the Pride of Paducah with me. I sent a message to you by him. Did he give it to you? Yeah, he told me. -He-He seen it, huh? -He seen it. And it was night, and he was sleepin' on deck. He didn't blame me none. Just done a lot of prayin'... and told me to give myself up. I don't know nothin about religion. But he's right. He-He's right. You gotta give yourself up. There ain't no jury could blame you for... doin' a thing like that. Now, come on. Come on and sit down there. Come sit down. Get you something to eat here now. Then we'll go on over. We'll see the sheriff,... and you can give yourself up. No! He ain't gonna give his self up. Listen here. Who asked for any opinion of... yours on this thing? You've done enough to him already. Now, sit down there and get you something to eat. He's gonna do as I say. He knows that he can trust me. No, he ain't gonna do what you say. We heard tell of this hangin' judge. Ain't nobody gonna hurt Duke. -Sit down! -Sit down, Fleety Belle. Eat some thin'. Uncle John's right. There ain't no thin' to run away from. I told you not to come here. We'd be safe in the swamp. Aw, swamps! He's a river man. He couldn't live in the swamps. He's not that kind of people. But they'll hang you, Duke. I know they will! Aw, they won't do any such a thing. They won't hang him. Don't pay any attention to her, Duke. She'll... only get you in worse. You shut up and stop sayin' that! You're just thinkin' of yourself! You don't care what... happens to Duke! Now, honey, Uncle John is- I ain't never had no thin' to love in my life, and... Im not gonna let 'em take you. Nobody's gonna take me away from you, honey... except maybe for a little while. You and me gotta be free to get married and-and... live on this boat. lf you don't come with me now, you'll never see me again. Come on, son. Let's get on over and see the sheriff. -You let him alone! -Now, honey- -Come on, son. -I know why you're doin' this. Its because you hate me, and you think I ain't... good enough for him. Comin', Duke? Im comin', Uncle John. But you've gotta take care of Fleety Belle while Im gone. Rufe? Rufe? Sure is quiet up here. Sleeps right upstairs there. See if I can wake him up here. Rufe? Hello down there. Well, good heaven Betsy. What are you doin' down there this time of night,... Doc? Can't you let a man sleep? Come on down. Duke... Duke killed a man. Well, doggone me. Who was it, Duke? Somebody I knowed? Fella named Big Steve. -Never heard of him. -Come on-Come on down, Rufe. Now, Doc, there ain't no need of me comin' down them stairs. Wait just a minute. Ill fix you up. Here you be, Duke. Now just open her up and make yourself at home. Take the first bed you take a liking to. And, Doc... just hang the keys on the front doorknob, will ya? Ill be seein' you in the mornin' now about breakfast time. Good night. Huh. You'd think somebody killed a man every day around here... and come and give their self up. Hey, you. Girl! Come on inside here now. Supper's about ready. Sit down. -Sit down! -I ain't go in' to! You sit down! I don't want nobody wait in' on me. I know you hate me, and I don't care. Duke told me to stay here, and Im gonna do it. As soon as he gets out, him and me's goin' away. And we ain't comin' back neither. Maybe you're goin' away, but he ain't. Yes, he is. Now, we'll see about that. I never knew of any good... comin' of a river man get tin' mixed up with swamp trash. Hey, look out there! Hey. You know-Say, you're a... You're a spunky little rascal, you know it? You- You kind of got to admire you at that. -There she is! -Just wait till I get you home. -No, I ain't a-go in'! -Ill beat the hide... off of you for this... runnin' off with a river man, shamin' me in... the face of the Lord. Makin' trash out of herself. I don't know as I want... to marry her now. She'll marry you, Ben, after Pop gives her a good whoppin'. -Oh, I won't! I won't! I won't! -You'll shut up! Darn you! Ill beat the livin'... -Hold on there! -Go ahead and beat me! That's all I ever knowed. Take me back. But I won't marry him, and you can't make me. Ill run away, and Ill... Ill keep on doin' it till you kill me! Now, you listen to me. And you don't have to go anywhere. -Oh, shut up! -He's just lookin' for trouble. Go ahead. Give it to him. Ain't no sin runnin' off with the man you love... and ain't nobody gonna make me say it is. You heard what she said. Now, go on! Get out of here! -Hit him in the chin, Pop! -Ill bust him one! Go ahead, Ben. Don't take none of his sass. Ain't no river man gonna tell me what to do. She's my young 'un, and I got the right. There ain't nobody gonna tell her what to do but Duke. -Im her pa. -Yes, and Duke is her husband. Her and Duke... Her and Duke was married. There can't be no thin' wrong about that, can there? He's lyin', Pap! I ain't a-gonna marry her now no how. I don't want... no river man's trash! You bet your life you're not a-gonna. Say, just a minute here. Say, Ive stood just about all the insults... Im gonna stand out of you people. You can't come in here talkin' to that girl like that. That's Duke's wife. -Now get out of here, you swamp trash! -Now, wait a minute. -Put that down. -Come on, you swamp rats! Get out of here! -Look, Pappy! There's my shoes. -Hey, drop them shoes! Ow! Fine lot of kinfolks you got. Id mighty like to thank you for what you've done. Well, you oughta thank me. Hadn't been for me, they'd have got your shoes. -But-But, I mean, you fixed it... -Well, yes. lf you hadn't give me the knife, they might have... got 'em anyhow. Com in' in here bother in' us just when we're gonna enjoy... our supper here together. Hmph. That's a fine lot of kinfolks havin'... like that. Swamp people. Look at that bacon. Look at that. Its all burned. Look. Look at that. Let me fix it. Huh? What do you know about coo kin' bacon? I bet you never did cook no thin' but catfish. Hey, what is that-Here. What is that? Is that-Is that an old tablecloth... of somebody's? Huh? What is it? You can't wear a thing like that to the court- You can't wear... You can't wear that to the courtroom. You've got to... No wonder Duke couldn't tell whether you was a boy or a girl. Look at that. Sure used to make them Yanks run in that. Look at that. Huh? That belonged to... That belonged to Duke's mother. She was the prettiest woman I ever saw in my life... even if she was my sister. She was a skinny little thing, just like you. There you go. There you go. Lettin' the bacon burn up that way. That's all you women think about... just clothes. Dr. John, do you think any body'll take me for a swamp girl? Swamp girl? What, in those clothes? No more swamp girl. Say, there's gals up in the big city... like-like Vicksburg that ain't got duds like those. You know where those clothes come from? Way up to Memphis. Do you think... Do you think Duke'll like it? Like it? Say, he ain't even gonna recognize you at first. Duke's gonna have two sweethearts now. -Two? -Yeah. Gonna have two. You and the Claremore Queen. Say, we gotta hurry up here. Let's get to prancin' here. Come on. 'Twas me done this to Duke. Its all my fault. I ought to let him run away like you said. You was right about that hangin judge. Guess I thought 'cause I was older... that l-I knew more about right and wrong than you all did. Duke ain't blamin' you, Dr. John. I know he ain't. But you are. I ain't blamin' nobody. You ain't no more surprised about it than I be, Doc. Aw. You up there supposed to be savin' a man's life. Then you're talkin' to the judge about real estate. What'd you wanna start an argument with him for? Well, 'tweren't my fault. You seen the way he led around to it. He's held a grudge against me ever since I sold... him that bottom land. 'Tweren't my fault the river run over it. Oh, well, if you'd let me have my way and let me go find the... New Moses who's the only man that saw the thing- Had him here as a witness, Duke could've been free... and out of here. Aw, shucks. He ain't been hung yet. Just wait and see the way I handle this appeal. I tell you... You just wait a minute now. You ain't gonna handle any appeal. You know what I want you to do? I want you to go down to... Baton Rouge and I want you to get a... get a good lawyer. Get the best lawyer you can get. Get a-Get a smart lawyer. Cost a heap of money. Them big fellows wouldn't even worry about Duke... for less than $500. Five hundred dollars? Well, if his life ain't worth $500, it ain't worth nothin'. You go get the lawyer, will ya? You get the lawyer. Ill get the $500 somehow or another. Come on, honey. Howdy, Doc! Oh, hello, Rufe. Mighty sorry to hear about the way Duke's case turned out. Well, ain't hung him yet. That's the truth as I see it. They ain't goin' to either. What-What's that you got there? Why, ain't you heard? Why, Professor Marvel done... skipped town owin' everybody. Left his whole show and the calliope and everything. Come on in and see the show, honey. It'll cheer you right up. They got a dead fish in here. They call it a whale. Why, the whole tent's just chuck full of things... that'll give you the shivers. Come on in. Yes, sir. All the greatest folks in history, from John the Baptist... plumb down to the king of England. There's Little Eva sittin' there. Old Uncle Tom's layin' around here somewheres. You know the story of Little Eva, honey? -No. -Well, just as well. Oh, here. Lookee. Its Daniel Boone. -That Daniel Boone? -That's Daniel Boone. You-You know the story of Daniel Boone? -No. -Ill tell you that sometime. That's a-That's a great story. Oh, here. Look here. Ill bet that's the old bloodhound,... ain't it, Sheriff? Huh? Got ya there, Doc. Lookee here. You see that statue there? -Uh-huh. -That's Ulysses S. Grant. -Yeah? Who's that? -Oh. -The woman leadin' the horse? -Yeah. Why, that's Victory,. Ain't it just like some durned Yankee to let the lady walk? They do it every time. But lookee here, Doc. Ill bet you this here's somethin' that you ain't... never seen before. There's been a heap of argument around town... about this here whale. And Professor Marvel, now, he claimed that... it's the very identical whale that swallowed Jonah. Well, it looks old enough to be. Yes, and look here at the size of this here mouth. Ain't nobody in here. Thunderation! Ain't nobody in here, white folks. -Holy Moses! -Moses nothin'. -Say, that's Jonah. -No, it's just me. I worked for the doctor, and I just... Well, come on out of there now. Ain't nobody gonna harm you. -What you doin' in there? -Nothin'. I was just- Thought you thought I was Mr... Professor, and l- Say. Say, wait a minute here, Rufe. You know, I got an idea. See what you think of this, Fleety. What do you say... You want to get your money out of this, don't ya? Sure do. What do you say you let me take this on the Claremore Queen... and Ill soon have your money back. And we can get Duke that appeal lawyer too. Well, I don't see how nobody can kick about that. -Do you go with this? -Yes, sir, I works here. I play the banjo and the mouth organ and the calliope and... -Calliope? -Yes, sir, and the... -What's your name? -Well, I was baptized... David Begat Solomon, but... -David Begat what? -David Begat Solomon. But I changed it to George Lincoln Washington. Well, now, listen. lf you're goin' with me, we're gonna... stick to the Bible. -You're Jonah. -Yes, sir. But I can't swim. Where do you want this virgin queen? Put her there by her husband. What do I know about a king and queen anyhow? All I ever did do is sell medicine up and down this river here. But Ill tell you, if we get right down to earth... and we can change these people around into people these... folks on the river wanna see... we can make a lot of money. Now, for instance, who-who's your favorite female? -Pocahontas. -Pocahontas. That's great. Now, we'll just make Pocahontas out of her, see? Get some feathers and some paint and all. Who was the feller she was with? What was his name? -Captain John Smith. -Captain John-Here- Here's Captain John Smith right here. Over here, we'll take this fella. The gentleman here is... 'King George'-One, two, three. King George III. I never heard of him. We'll make that gentleman... into George Washington. That's who it is. And this one over here... we'll take him... Hey, hey. Hey, that's Napoleon. Better leave him alone. Uh-Now, here. Here's these two New Moseses here. I think they're old prophets of some kind. But there ain't nobody interested in prophets nowadays. I tell you, we'll make outlaws out of them. -Frank and Jesse James. -That's great. That's- Everybody wants to see the James boys. Pop, I just now done told you, Topsy goes back... there with Uncle Tom. You know good and well she don't goes with Napoleon. Here's Mr. Ulysses S. Grant, Mr. Doctor. Grant? Oh, say. I just happened to think. Say, we got to go right by Vicksburg. And they ain't never forgot down there. No wonder old Professor Marvel skipped town. You know, I knew a fellow that got run out of... Vicksburg for just lookin' like him. I tell you, if you all don't want him... this uniform just about fits me. You'll have to change him to somebody else. Say, Im gonna change him. You know what Ill do? Take that old cigar out of his mouth... and we'll make him Robert E. Lee. I been waitin' here kind of hop in' you'd come. Gets mighty lonesome sometimes. I had to come. We're leaving tomorrow. Ain't no thin' nicer than... go in' up and down the river. Dr. John's got the appeal lawyer. He's gonna send you the money fast as we take it in. I sure would like to be in them river towns and see your show. Oh, it's mighty beautiful. Fella in here used to work in a tattoo parlor in... Perryville, and- Well, I kind of been get tin' some tattoo in' done myself. I wished I could see it. Well- See what it says under the heart? Its my name. Ive been learn in' to play the saw too. I wish I could hear it. I only know one tune, and... I don't know that very good. There's some thin' I gotta tell you, Fleety Belle. You know that girl that waits on table across the street? Well, l-I waved at her once. Ill bet she waved at you first. Ive gotta go. Fleety Belle, you ain't... ain't never kissed me yet. Put it over a little bit. Put it over a little. A little more there. Now just hold it steady. You don't want me to run into that sandbar, do you, Captain John? Hmm? What-Hey, hey! Look out there! Say, wait a minute there. Hey, you got to make up your mind who you're gonna... take orders from- me or you. Now, hold her right there now. Right there. You think Im learnin'? Say, you takin' to the river just like an old turtle. lf you listen to me, you'll be the best pilot on the whole river... outside of Duke and me. I sure would like to get back and see Duke. You ain't, uh, getting tired of my company already. Why, you know that ain't so. I ain't never had a dream like this. I ain't never knowed nobody like you. Why, you bought me dresses and pretty things... like I ain't never see'd before. Sometimes, when we're goin' down the river at night... I get to thinkin' about Duke... and what you done for him and me. Seems like I can hardly stand it. I feel like the Lord's just shamin' me for having hated you so. Yeah. Don't have to... worry about... The Lord's a lot broad-minded than you think he is anyhow. Put her over a little bit. Look out for this bend. That's it. Hold it steady. Steamboat round the bend! Hey, that's the river talk! Steamboat round the bend. Steamboat round the bend! Here she comes. Hey, you know what that is? That's the Pride of Paducah. Its old Captain Eli. Want to just give that old snap pin' turtle a toot here... -to show him my boat can toot louder than his. Hey, Doc! Don't forget Im gonna own that old mud scow... when I win this race! Yeah, the only time you ever gon' pass me is when... you go in' the other way. Say, what are you on that museum... the mummy? And, say, you better stay away from Salt Creek. They lynched one of them hootchy kootchy shows there last week. Where was you sittin', on the front row? I sure was! Cramp 'er, Mink! Cramp 'er! You know, Captain John... maybe he's right about Salt Creek. Oh, that old bullfrog don't know what he's talking about. Salt Creek's the last town we gonna show anything. Then we going home. See Duke. Oh! Now, look, say, don't do that. There ain't no thin' run you on the sandbar quicker... than a lot of hug gin' and kiss in'. I didn't mean to. You didn't mean to? Well, that's a fine thing to say. lf you didn't mean to, maybe Id better give it back. Too much foolishness go in' on around here. Change your clothes quick now. Put on a fancy dress. Gonna show those folks in Salt Creek some... fancy pilot in' now. Give 'em a little toot. Oh, say, there's a lot of folks com in' tonight! It looks like the biggest night we've had in a long time. Come on. Got some change? Get up in there now. Come on, Jonah. Get that started. Well, well, well, now. Well, welcome, brother. Welcome to Dr. John's Floating Museum. The show is just about to start, so get your tickets right here. There ain't gonna be no show. No? Just, uh-Just where did you, uh, get that... information, brother? 'Cause we're gonna chop up your boat, mister. -Yeah, and burn it up too! -We'll give you a trail to travel! And a bucket of tar for that gal! Come on. Let's pull this museum out of here! Mr. Efe! Mr. Efe! They're tear in' the boat down,... them gentlemen! Mr. Doc and Miss Fleety and them standing round... there, lookin' round! I never been so scared in all my life! They got pickaxes and they got ax handles... -Stand back there! -Hold up your hands! -Look out, pappy! He's got a gun! -I see him. -Im gon'shoot! -Wait a minute, boys! Don't shoot. Just hold that till I tell you. They've got the... wrong impression. -This ain't no show. -How come she ain't a show? You got a 'calli-oop.' Yeah, I know. But this is a museum. Its educational! -How come she's educational? -Well, because... because it is, that's why! Now, un cock your guns, boys, because you may... let 'em go off accidentally. Just hold it until I tell you to. Its educational. Did you ever see a petrified man? Huh? No, you never did. Well, we got one in there. Ain't we, honey? We got one in there, and he's 2,000 years old. Im gonna let you all come in there and see with your own eyes... and it ain't gonna cost you one nickel. And if everything that Ive told you about out here ain't in... there just like I told ya... then you can come out and chop it down. Now, friends, there ain't nobody that rightfully... knows just how old she is. There is people that say a whale grows an inch... every hundred years. So, well, you can figure it out for yourself. That's not a fish. This ain't a fish. That's a mammal. -Its a... -A mammal. Well, I mean it raises its young just like a cow does. Yes! And it breathes just the same as you and l. And when it gets waterlogged, it blows it out through... these breathing places in its head. Ill show you. Efe, let her breathe a little. Pappy, it breathed all over me! There you are. Now, is she educational, or ain't she? There's a powerful lot of learning in a whale. Neighbor, this thing is worth payin' for. Im glad to hear you say that. -Rex, pass the hat. -Come on, Rex. Rex, better get your pappy's hat. Yours leaks. Over this way, gentlemen, you have George Washington,... the father of his country! You can't leave without seein' Pappy! I told you on the outside that l had George Washington... here. I wasn't lyin' to ya. Friends, that certainly is a fine man! All my life Ive thought that about him and what... he's done for our country. -Will you be here tomorrow? -No, Im sorry. I won't be here tomorrow. I sure would like to have my old woman see him, if she... could get away from her plowin'. She got a picture of him, and ain't more than a week... goes by she don't look at it. Well, Im awful sorry, but we got to be in Beaver... Slough tomorrow. -They're waitin' for us. -Don't suppose you could spare... me a piece of his hair, could ya? Well, no, I don't... Me and her'd be mighty proud to have a piece of... George Washington's hair. Well, Im gonna give you a little piece here. Of course, I don't want you to have to make your wife quit plowin'. There it is. You be very careful of that. Take good care of that. Right over this way, gentlemen! Right over here! Call your attention to the stage! All right, Fleety... Belle, Efe, Jonah. Gentlemen, General Robert E. Lee. Look away, look away Look away, Dixieland Attention! I wish I was in Dixie, I say, I say Away, away A-way down South in Dixie. Away, away A-way down South in Dixie. I wish I was in the land of cotton. Old times there is not forgotten. Look away, look away Look away, Dixieland. -Come on. -Howdy there, Doc, Fleety Belle! Hello! Hello! -Hello! -Hello, Sheriff. The way this gal drag you up that hill, you'd think... she wanted to see somebody. How's Duke? Oh, fine as a frog hair. Never knowed a man... could keep so happy. Wait'll you hear him play on that saw. Man, he really whips 'er. And he eats more'n a horse. You wanna feed him good, 'cause there ain't... nothin' too good for Duke. That's the truth as I see it. Sure hate to see him get hung. What are you talking about? Why are you joking... about a thing like that? Ain't you heard? The court done turned down his appeal. -Who said so? -Doc, Im sorry. I thought you knowed. I got my orders in my pocket. I gotta take him to... Baton Rouge tomorrow night. Duke! Duke! Fleety Belle. -Duke, it ain't so, is it? -I guess it is. They can't take you, Duke. They can't! Aw, don't cry, honey. I guess things just gotta be that way. Id just about die if I never was married to you. Oh, dear, you're such a skinny little thing. You know, my Bonnie Lou got married in this dress. She was a little stouter than you are, though. Its awful pretty. Dear, I wished I had some orange blossoms. Don't seem like no weddin' without no orange blossoms. Addie May, dear, run along and fix the flowers. That's a good girl. Yes, sir, Duke, Im gonna give you a real good 'un. This makes 13 folks that Ive married what... was gonna get hung. I guess that's a record. Sheriff down in Big Bend, he claimed he done 14. But never was nobody could find where it was... put down in a book. Now, these 'uns I done. Every one of' em is wrote right here in my family Bible,... where anybody can see 'em. -Uh, everything's ready, Pop. -That's fine, Addie May. Got your flowers all put around? That's good. Doc, got the piano set. Guess we're about ready to go. Now, Addie May, can you play the 'Wedding March'? Can't play nothing but 'Listen to the Mockingbird.' I reckon that'll have to do. We gotta have some... music to get the bride in here. Run on over to the piano, dear. We'll be ready... in just a minute. -Ma! Oh, Ma! 'Bout ready? -Yeah! We're a-waitin'. Won't be but a minute. Pappy, you gotta give her away, 'cause you done it for... me when you was in here last time. Bub, let the boys in. Now, you boys quiet down and get settled now. Don't wanna have no disturbance. Gonna start the... ceremony in just a minute. Doc, the old jail looks kinda cheerful, don't it? Yeah. Go ahead, dear. Go ahead. All right, begin, Addie May. Friends... we are gathered here in the eyes of God... and one another... for the purpose of joining together... this here man and this here woman in holy matrimony. Can't nobody rightly say nothin' agin marriage... 'cause I reckon God intended... every, body to live that-a-way. Cause every, living human on this earth... has got to find his mate... sometime or other. And when God put Noah in the ark... he told him to take two of everything. 'Cause God knowed that was right... and I guess he knowed what it was to be lonesome. Now, if Duke and Fleety Belle here... had a notion... they're only carrying out the Word of God. And right here I wanna say a word about Duke. There ain't never been a finer man... in this here jail. That's the truth as I see it. Course, we're all mighty sorry, that Duke's gotta... go and get himself hung. Don't seem just-just right. But that ain't got nothin' to do with this ceremony,... I guess. Has it, Doc? All right, Duke... do you take this here woman to be your lawful wedded wife... until death do ye part? I do. And you, Fleety Belle, do you take this here man... for your lawful wedded husband... until death do ye part? I do. You got a ring, Duke? I got it. Just put it on her finger there. That looks like it might have been your mother's, son. -It was. -All right. I now pronounce you man and wife... until death do ye part. Go ahead and kiss her, son. Hurry up now, Duke. Here she comes! Yeah. Darned ol' train. It would be on time. Duke 'n' me be down in Baton Rouge before midnight. I hate to do this, Duke, but it's according to the law. I guess you done all you could, Rufe. They ain't takin' you! Go on, Duke! Get away! Ain't no sense in that. I don't wanna get you in trouble. Or you either, Uncle John. I don't wanna get you... in no trouble either, Rufe. You been mighty good to me. Oh, that's all right, Duke. I ain't holdin' no grudge. Well, guess I kinda lost my head too. I wanted to see him get away. Don't cry, honey. Rufe ain't gonna hold nothin' against ya. Don't reckon we'll be needin' these handcuffs none, Duke. All aboard! -Come on, let's get on. Go ahead, Duke. Don't you worry, honey. You know what we gonna do? You know? We gonna get on that boat and we gonna go all up... and down that river. And we're gonna hunt and hunt till we- till we find the New Moses. We'll find him somewhere. Hey, brother, you seen anything of the New Moses? Yes, sir! He was down in the swamp baptizin' about a week ago! Hello, friends! Hey, have you seen anything of the New Moses? Brother, he was here two weeks ago... and I ain't had a drop since! Uncle John, come here! Look! What is it? Huh? Oh! Say, that does look like a baptizin'. That might be him. Pull over here. Hey! Hey, brothers! Is that the New Moses? No, brother, but I am the New Elijah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! No. Its the wrong prophet. Folks out there don't look like they seen... anybody com in' through here. Hey, brothers! You seen anything of the New Moses? Brother, I ain't even seen the old Moses! Fresh thing. Hmph. -Your joke's old enough - you ought have seen the old Moses. Looks like we've missed him everywhere we've... gone, Fleety Belle. Duke ain't got much time left, Uncle John. I know that. I been racking my brain every night and day... since the thing happened. l-I don't know. I just wouldn't wanna go on... livin' if they hang that boy. I ain't goin' to neither. But they ain't gonna hang Duke. Im not sayin' we're gonna save him, but they... ain't gonna hang him. I don't know. Nobody but the Lord knows about that. Ain't got but two days left. Say, wait, I got a no-T-Take the wheel and hold it. Let me think a minute. You know what Im gonna do? Im goin' right and see the governor. -Could ya? -Yes! Well, they say he... ain't forgot us old soldiers. You know, I remember him at Shiloh. He was certainly dealin' them Yankees... a powerful lot of misery there then. Im just gonna go see him and tell him that we... can't find the New Moses... and this is not Duke's fault. Let's put her around now. We'll turn right around and take her into Baton Rouge. Oh, what's the idea of his comin' up here now? Don't he know we got a race on? Say, what's he doin'? Wavin' us in there? Go back, will ya! Go back, I say! We're gonna have a race! Hey! What's the idea wavin' us in there? We goin' on up the river! The river's been cleared for the race, Doc! Nobody can get through until they get away! Get that floatin' henhouse out of the way! Henhouse? What's he doing, calling this thing a henhouse? What are you talking about? Why don't you do as I tell you and go back? What do you mean, callin' this a henhouse? Henhouse! Can't you understand English? I said go back, not up river! I-Aww. Now, you captains ain't gonna start until... the cannons go off. Then you can do what you please. The first boat that reaches Baton Rouge wins the... race as well as the prize... from the governor's own hand. Here, Clay, hey, what's the idea of flaggin' me in here? Sorry, Doc, but you know the rules of the race. Im not in the race. Im tryin' to get to Baton Rouge. Oh, no, you ain't, either. I knowed you'd try to back out of that race. Scared you'll lose that old chicken coop. Chicken coop, nothin'. You still wanna bet the Pride of Paducah... against the Claremore Queen? As I recall, that was the terms of the bet,... unless you're crawfishing. Winner takes both boats. Is that so? Well, Ill just take you up on that. Ill bet you my boat against yours, whole hog... or none with me. Ill go in the race. Itll slow me up going to... Baton Rouge, but Ill go in. What time do we start? Sergeant Benson shoots off that cannon in five minutes. Now, wait. Give me time to load on some firewood. Im purt' near out. Same ol' Pokey-hontas. Always full of alibis. You couldn't win if you put wings on! She starts when the gun goes off. That's the rules. You fellas better hurry and get on your boats. Ill lay the course, Mink. I don't wanna start off by running over them floatin' waxworks. Get ready, Cap. Cannon's about to go 'boom!' Get ready below! Hey, come on there, Fleety Belle. Don't be standin' around. -Are we really goin' in the race? -Sure. We got to get... down the river anyhow. Ready! Hey, Doc, better hug close to shore! No tellin' when that ol' honey wagon's gonna sink. Aw, you shut up, you old... Uh, hush up. Hey, Efe! Stand by now! Full head of steam on all the time! Come on, honey. Let me get it, now. I wanna get a flyin' start. That's the boat we got... to beat, this Pride of Paducah. Hey, Uncle Jeff, throw off your spring line! We way ahead! Look here! Lemme show ya! They way back there! See 'em back there? You can see that Cherokee boat, they way back there! But that Pride of Paducah is right up there! I believe it's gon' slip by! Better get some more of that steam, if you can, in there! We out in front now, if we can just hold it. Yeah, but the Cherokee's catching up with us. Holler down to Efe! -Tell him to pour the wood to 'er. -Efe, what steam you carryin'? Im just a-wonderin', Mink, where we gonna put... that prize when we win it tomorrow. Down in the clerk's office? Uh, in the pilot's house, I should say. Well, maybe that would be best. Uncle John, look! Its the New Moses! But-Say, it is the New Moses! It is! Pull it over! Pull right over! Pull her over! Pull her over! Pull her over! Pull her over! Away! Away! Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah! -Hallelujah! -Be careful! Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah! -Hallelujah! -Get him on the boat, quick! -Hallelujah! -Glory, be! Hallelujah! Glory, be! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Glory be! Glory be! -Hallelujah! -Glory be! Brother, what are you doing here? -Helpin' to win a race. -Race? Gambling? -Devil's work! -Oh, no, no! This is a race to save a life. Its Duke. They're... gonna hang him in the morning. -But they can't! I seen it! -That's what I want... you to tell the governor! No, I got souls to save. No, you got a life to save, and the Lord don't care which one... of your jobs you do first. Keep a-goin', Fleety Belle! Can I get you a drink of water or somethin', Mr. Moses? Just lucky he didn't bump his head on that boat. Hallelujah! Glory, be, Brother Efe! Hallelujah! Into the fiery furnace! Into the fiery furnace! -Glory be! -Hallelujah! Glory be, brother! Come! We must have more wood! Chop up the decks here! Chop everything that burns! Every- Anything that burns! Must have more wood! Say, look here, honey. Can you get over there and get right in behind him? Sure, I can. Yeah. -In his backwash? -Uh-huh. Because if you can, the Lord has given me an idea. Here she comes! Mink, when I get sound asleep, take this here... cigar out of my mouth, will ya? Burnt up three, four steamboats that-a-way. -Mornin', Mink. -Morning, Captain. Mornin', Captain Eli! Have a good night? Holy jumpin' catfish! Fletch! Fletch! Get an ax! Get an ax and chop that old scow loose! Doc, you connivin' old scoundrel! It 'taint fair! It 'taint fair! Im just as sore 'bout it as you are, Captain Eli... when I found out we'd been pushin' you all night. Ah, son... I wouldn't keep watching that scaffold if I were you. I ain't seen it, Reverend. I was watchin' up the river. I sure thought Uncle John and Fleety Belle would be here today. Well, maybe they'll be able to get here yet. Ill stay here with you. -How much time I got? -Oh, a couple of hours. -Let me read to you a little. -Please. The fire's dyin' out, Doc. The boiler's gettin' cold. She ain't got another lick in 'er. We're sure licked now. -You got to keep the fires goin'. -Ain't got nothin' else to burn! -Well, burn that museum! -Huh? Right! Moses! Doc said burn up the museum! The mu-Good idea! You gon' burn up Mr. George Washington? Hey! I wonder how come they can... In! Mr. Moses, that's Miss Carry, 'Notion'; Lookee here-Hey! Hey, Mr. Efe! Mr. Efe! Hey! Its me, Mr. Efe! Hey! Its me! Its me! Its Jonah, Mr. Efe! Go on, brother! -Hallelujah! -Go on, brother! Glory be! Hallelujah! -Get everything in there! -Get that drinkin'... chap over there! In with the demon rum! In he goes! Here we are! Cramp her, Mink! Get in that current and cramp her sharp! Hey, Clem! Give 'er everything you've got! Spread 'er wide open and put two more men on the safety valve! Mr. Efe, there they is there! Hurry up, Uncle Jeff!. They sneakin' by! -Hallelujah! Glory be! Hallelujah! -Glory be! -Only six to do now! -Glory be! Come on, brother! Into the fiery furnace! There they come, Mr. Efe! You better make a fire up! You better make it hotter! You just takin' your time! You can't get no steam! There they go! I know good and well we... gon' have to catch 'em again! -Take 'er, Mink. -Ive got 'er. Hot ziggety! We got him beat four ways to Sunday now! Glory be! Hold 'er steady, Mink! Ain't there somethin' we can get in there and... keep 'er goin' a little further? -We're purt' near there. -We ain't got steam... enough to raise a blister. Don't seem fair. They're gonna hang Duke, and we... in spittin' distance of Baton Rouge. Nothing can save us now but the power of prayer. Hey! What are you drinkin' there? Medicine. Brother Efe, you've been deceivin' me! That's demon rum! Hey, that's Pocahontas. Its never failed us yet. -Say, we got 10 gallons, right? -Ten? We got a hundred! Then fire it up! Down with demon rum! Down with demon rum! Down with it! Down with the demon rum! Into the fiery- Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Boy, that stuff is dangerous! -Give it here! -Keep it goin'! Down with the demon rum! There we are! Into the fiery furnace! -Glory, be! -Id love to see ol'... Captain Eli's face now! Gosh almighty! Say, look, Mink! Look at the way the smoke's comin' out of'er! Hey, Clem! Clem! Feed 'er rosin! Yes, and a barrel of pitch! We'd better get hotter! I ain't gonna rest,... so we'd better catch that- Hallelujah! That must be some powerful roots and herbs... in this Pocahontas. Yea, brother! More! More! Hurl away the demons! Yes! There they are! Hurl away the demons! That's it! Mink, he's crawlin' up. We're comin' into... We're comin' into Baton Rouge! That's Baton Rouge! O God in heaven, look down upon this, thy son... Excuse me, Reverend. Say, Duke, is there any last request you'd like to make? I sure would like to see the finish of that race. Well, I ain't got no objection to that. But Rufe... told me that you- That's all right. Anything Duke wants suits me. Well, Id like to see the finish of that race myself. So, we'll let 'er go as soon as the Pride of Paducah... comes around the bend. -Thank you, sir. -It won't be long. -There she comes! Well, all right, son. Let's go. Wait a minute! That ain't the Pride of Paducah! Its the Claremore Queen! -Well, let's go. -Good-bye, Duke. O Father, Father, I beseech thee... at this moment look down upon thy son... in this, his hour of need. Grant him strength. Grant him praise... Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! I pardon this boy! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Look. There's the boat. Let's get over there. - We won't have to look no further. - Aye-yippety-aye. They was gator-ate. You spoke the truth, Sheriff Jeb, ain't no doubt about it. A mighty big wet place, Okefenokee. I'll say she is, Thursday. 700 miles of nothing. 700 miles ain't gonna see hide nor hair of me, Marty. Come on, let's get out of here. It'll soon be duskdark. We can't get losted, Jeb, not as long as we can keep sight of that cross. Maybe not, Tim, but I can get mighty nervous. Come on, shove her off, Hardy. Let's get. Trouble. Come back here. Trouble, come back here. Trouble. Trouble. - Morning, Miss Hannah. - Morning. - Seen my dog? - No, I ain't. I swear, Hannah, you're a right pretty woman. I don't know how come you ever married an old man like me. You ain't no old man. I wish you wouldn't go fox-hunting all the time. Always going off with them dogs at duskdark and leaving me here alone. Hannah, I've been doing it ever since I was old enough to own a dog. You just can't change us swamp folks. Look at Ben and that dog of his. I get lonesome. Why, I told you, your sister could come and live with us. It ain't my sister I'm lonesome for. - Going trapping, son? - No, sir. My dog ain't back. I'm going at him. Come here, Ben. Yes, sir. You be careful and keep clear of that swamp. How can I keep clear of Okefenokee? That's where my dog is. - You heard me, son. - When are you coming back, Ben? When I find that fool dog, Miss Hannah. You be back by tomorrow night and keep clear of that swamp. You know where I gotta go to find my dog. You'll be back here by tomorrow night or not at all. Ben. - I'll try to get back. - Don't try. Get back. - I don't care whether I get back or not. - That's up to you. Ben. Goodbye, Miss Hannah. You ain't never been that hard-minded. He ain't never headed for that swamp before, neither. You've been like a second mother to him, Hannah. Surely you know how I feel. Sure I know. A woman don't need no telling. Trouble with you menfolk is you're afraid to let on to each other how you feel. Hello, Ben. - Howdy, Mabel. - My goodness. You look like a thundercloud. - I just had a big fight with my father. - Whatever for? - My dog's losted. - That's nothing to fight about. - We fit about my going to get him. - Oh, Ben. What are you laughing about? I got a right to get my dog, ain't I? Don't fight with me about it. Go get your dog if you want. - That's what I aim to. - Ben? - Guess you are upset. - I've got old Trouble on my mind. Well, for heaven's sake, go look for him, then. That's just what I'm gonna do. A box of 12-gauge shells, Marty. - Who's a-winning, Dave? - Well, it's kind of give-and-take. That old mule of yours is getting pretty lame, ain't she? Yeah. She's got a nail in her foot. If I ever get time, I'm gonna pull it out. - You got time to work on me a little? - I'll take time. Where you heading for, Ben? Okefenokee. - You're going into that swamp? - Yes. I gotta find my dog. You're going in alone? - Lessen you want to go with me. - No, not me. Hot dang, I can just see you a-sashaying into that swamp. Yeah, then come hauling-tail outta there with a bull gator snapping at your britches. - I ain't afraid of no swamp. - Neither was them trappers we looked for. - What you trying to do? - I wanted to see if your hat would fit me. That's all we're ever gonna find of you. Doggone that she-housecat. She throws a litter every time I turn my back. I'll tell you what we'll do. You give us a bottle of that red whisky, and Bud and me'll put all them cats in one sack and throw 'em in the creek. Sure will. - Be dogged if you ain't made a deal. - Catch 'em. Get a sack. Hurry up, Bud. Here. - That yellow hyena. - Kitty, kitty. Behind that barrel. Move. - Don't let 'em get away. - No, he ain't here. - Well, I'll be doggoned. Where did he go? - He went over there someplace. - Here he is. - Gimme that cat. You, young 'un. Fetch it back. You hear me? Why don't you let her have it, Marty? Give him the cat, you. Maybe we ought to put you in that croker sack, you little fighting cat. - Fork over that bottle of red-eye, Marty. - Hurry up. Ben. If you aim to rassle them bull gators, you'll need a swallow of this. No, thanks, Bud. It might taste of cats. Ben. Cold-out crazy about that dog, bless Katy if he ain't. Can't nobody stop him now. Old Trouble. Who are you? Ain't you Tom Keefer? - I'm mighty sorry, bud. - Sorry you gave me that lick on the head? I'm mighty sorry you turned out to know I'm Tom Keefer. You come at me? No. No, I come at my dog, that's all. I didn't even know you was a-hiding in Okefenokee. Old Sheriff Jeb figured you got away to Savannah after you escaped. If you was to let me take my dog and go, I wouldn't never tell nobody. I don't expect I could do that. You wouldn't never find your way outta here anyways. - You could tell me how to get out. - I don't expect I could. I reckon I know what happened to them trappers now. They was cottonmouth-bit. I found them dead, all swole up. I buried 'em up yonder. - What's your name, bud? - Ben. Ben Ragan. Thursday Ragan's boy? Thursday was on the jury that tried to get me hung. Well, why don't you go ahead? You done killed one man, ain't ya? I figured I'd cut the throat of anyone come at me. You ain't gonna do it? But you're in Okefenokee for good, bud. If I were to let you go back, you'd tell it on me. - Not if I said I wouldn't. - Your word don't mean nothing to me. Not when my living or hanging is depending on it. Oh, Trouble. Well, I ain't gonna stay, Keefer. You ain't man enough to keep me here. There ain't but one way to find your way out of this swamp now. That's with me a-showing you. Sure am proud to have me a dog like that. You ain't got him, yet. We'll get out, Keefer, if I have to bash you in the head when you ain't looking. Bud, there ain't no man living can catch me when I ain't looking. Don't you move, Keefer. I told you I'd get ya. Now get in that boat. Take me out of this swamp. I dropped that knife a-purpose, bud. I figured it was time to learn you a lesson. Get moving. I hope I didn't hurt you none. I tried to throw you easylike. Don't need to do me no favours. Next time I'll kill you, and get out by myself. I never seen no one so butt-headed. You're a good man, bud, but you've gotta give it up now. You're in here for life. Reckon you got plenty to think about. Shep Collins with a load of buckshot in his heart, and the like of that. Sometimes I get to thinking about my poor girl and what's gonna happen to her. You mean to say you got a woman outside this swamp? I had me the finest woman that ever lived. Couldn't be no other woman for me after she died. Not even if I could leave this swamp and live like folks. What do you mean, then? I told ya. My young 'un. That's how come I took to the swamp instead of getting away where I could live like folks. Couldn't bear to be that far away from my Julie. Julie? Marty McCord took her in after I was arrested. She does chores and Mrs McCord gives her rations and a place to sleep. Sure, I seen her. - Lately? - Sure, I seen that gal young 'un. - She doing all right? - I reckon so. How come she don't go by the name of Keefer if she's your young 'un? Ain't a good name to bear, is it? My wife was a Gordon. When they was gonna hang me, Mrs McCord promised she'd raise Julie by that name. Purely fine woman, Mrs McCord. Don't nobody know? Sure. Didn't Thursday never talk about it? Ben, you know, there's a lot of fine folks outside this swamp. Most people's a whole lot better than we think they are. And some men's a whole lot worse. What do you mean? Who? What's got into you? Keefer. What's wrong? Man, you're cottonmouth-bit. Keefer. Keefer. I'm going to get him now, Lord. There's a dead soul coming, it ain't nobody but Tom Keefer. But he died without no hollering nor cutting the fool. I ain't gonna hold nothin' against him, Lord, even his trying to steal old Trouble. So if you want to go easy on him for killing Shep Collins, it'll be all right with me. Amen. Come on, Trouble. Never thought to see you around here no more. I sort of stayed to bury you. Looks like I worked all night for nothing. If I let them things kill me, I'd have been dead a long time ago. You got some kind of snake cure? I just make up my mind to get well, think hard on it, and... maybe do a little praying. I bet I've been cottonmouth-bit a dozen times. When I found my knife was took, I figured you'd lit out. No. No, I took it to cut that snake bite, to make it bleed. Thanks. Reckon you can have your gun back if you want it, Ben. You ain't a-listening, Miss Hannah. You better go now, Mr Wick. How come you can't call me Jesse like you used to 'fore you was married? - You better go. - How come, Miss Hannah? You know how come. Thursday'd kill any man he catched here now. He ain't a-catching me. I'm safe as long as I hear them hounds a-baying. - He won't come back till they catch their fox. - He ain't fox-hunting, he's hunting Ben. He's working his way around Okefenokee, blowing his horn till Ben'll hear it. Thursday holds hisself to blame for letting Ben get losted. Ben don't never come back, I reckon it'll just about kill him. Somebody's coming. Don't run. Ben. - Ben. - Miss Hannah. - Guess you all about gave me up. - We feared you was dead. - Howdy, Jesse. - I was passing by. She asked if I'd seen you. How come you were away so long? We feared you was gator-ate. I told you I'd be back when I got ready. I just got ready. - I just happened to be passing by. - You've been in that swamp all this time? Yes. Me and that darn dog has travelled ourselves half to death. I told her I ain't seen you. I was just passing by. - Be sure, Jesse. - I better be a-rambling. Good night, Jesse. You forgot your guitar. Thanks, Ben. I was just passing by. - I'll get you something to eat. - I could sure eat it, Miss Hannah. It's Thursday. Evening, Thursday. I told you I'd get back, sir. And I found old Trouble. You took your time about it. No, sir, I come back as soon as I could. I catched me a lot of hide animals. I told you to be back here in two days. I was losted. Just getting too biggety. I'm still the man that can slim you down, you hear me? - I might have been dead. - You're butt-headed. Just gonna show me. - You wouldn't care what happened to me. - I said to be right back. To show me who's boss. If that's what you think, that's what I aim to show you. Thursday. - Come here. - I ain't gonna fight my father. - You're gonna stand there and take it. - No, I ain't. I'm my own man. I won't do everything you say. - Don't be hard on him. - Quiet. Many a man's gone into Okefenokee and not come out. Promise me you won't go near that swamp no more and I won't romp on you. There's coon and otter in that swamp. I'm gonna go trapping there. Not and live under this roof with me, you ain't. He's been worrying himself half-crazy over you, Ben. Well, he won't have to no more. Please don't go thisaway. He'll get over it. You ought to see I gotta do it. Ain't right for you to go. Your father needs you, Ben. I need you too. I can't tell you why. I'm scared of something here. Oh, Ben. I love you like you was my own boy. - Don't go and leave us. - Don't you worry none, Miss Hannah. Marty McCord's got an old empty shack on his place I can get. I reckon this just had to happen, so's I could really be my own man. Goodbye, Miss Hannah. Julie. Julie. Julie. Come here, young 'un. Come here. I've been looking for you. Come on. I ain't gonna hurt ya. Get inside. Go on. I got something to tell you. I seen your father in the swamp. - We nearly killed each other before I got out. - My father ain't hiding in no swamp, he ain't. What you scared of? I ain't gonna tell. Me and him's gonna be partners. We're gonna trap together. Look here. I already sold Marty some of the hides we catched. Half this money's yours. You ain't gonna tell on him? Of course I ain't. We gonna make a raft of money trapping that swamp, Tom and me. You get enough money saved up, Tom wants you to get you some schooling. He don't want you to be no little stray cat like you are now, dependent on other folks. I ain't no beggar. I work for my rations. You needn't get mad about it. Here. - I ain't no place to hide it. - Tom says I was to give it to you. I'd be scared to hold all that. I ain't never had no money. I'll keep it for you till I see what Tom says when I go back into Okefenokee. Is he all right? Is he sick or anything? Tom Keefer? Can't nothing hurt him. You better scoot before Marty's wife misses you. - You keep your mouth shut, mind. - I mind. Now, get. Can't I straighten up for you? I reckon you can at that. If there's one thing I don't get the hang of, it's making up a bed. But don't you let nobody see you a-running over here. No, you don't, boy. You stay here. Don't let him out, or he'll go buck-chasin' again. - Can I feed him? - Sure. Trouble's like me, he can always eat. Trouble. That's a fine name, ain't it? Mabel. Ben. Oh, Ben, I thought you was never coming back. Go on thinking if it makes you act thisaway. Don't guess this is no way for a nice girl to behave. That's the way I want my girl to behave when I come to see her. - Mabel. I got something to tell you. - What? - I run off from home. - You did? - Moved into Marty's old shack. - That old place. I aim to fill that shack with hides come wintertime. There ain't nobody in this town I'll have to say ""sir"" to. - I'm my own man now. - You're just talking big again. No, I ain't. Gonna get me a saddle horse, and a fine hound so I can breed old Trouble and raise some little Troubles. And not long after that, maybe I'll be around here with a proposition to make you. - What kind of a proposition? - You'll find out. I'm going into Okefenokee. You never seen the like of hide animals in there. - You'll lose yourself. I'll never see you again. - No, I won't. Yes, you will. Please don't go in there again. - You'll get gator-ate, like those two trappers. - They was snake-bit. Man knows his way around like I do ain't gonna get snake-bit. How come you know they were snake-bit? How come you say that? How come? - Well, I seen where they's buried. - Who buried 'em? Who could bury 'em in that swamp? You can ask more doggone questions. Don't get mad about it, Ben. Why don't you tell me who's a-hiding in the swamp? There ain't nobody a-hiding in the swamp. If you was to find men that had been cottonmouth-bit, you'd bury them. Well, that's what I done. - Promise me you won't tell nobody. - Why? They might try to keep me from going back there. Then my trapping would be over, and I couldn't make you that proposition. You know I won't tell nobody, Ben. After all, I got reasons for wanting you to make good, ain't I? Yeah, you sure have. When you going in the swamp again? Two or three days. - Supposin' you ain't back for the dance? - Well, I'll be back. Yeah, but supposin' you ain't? A girl can't settle down to one, Ben. Especially when he don't show up unless the notion strikes him. Why, I told you I'd be back. You better be. - Howdy, Ben. - Howdy, Tom. Hadn't ought to be carrying Trouble in a boat with you. Gator'll turn over a boat to get at a dog. You ought to leave him here with me. I ain't leaving him nowhere. - I'd take care of him like he was my own dog. - Yeah, I reckon you would. Got a present for you here, mister, see? - You'd steal my dog if I gave you a chance. - I'd like to, Ben. But I reckon I can't now, seeing as how you're my partner. Like another world in here, ain't it? I heard tell that stars is other worlds too. Big, shining rafts a-floating in the ocean of God's night. With living things on every raft, just like there is on this one they call the Earth. Living alone in this swamp's just like living on another star. This swamp ain't dangerous as I can see, like they say. If you know it, it ain't. But you can get lost and go crazy trying to find your way out. You got to know things that live here to get along with them. Just like you got to know people on the outside afore you can get along with them. Speaking of people outside, Ben, you ain't told me yet how my Julie looks. Well, she looks all right, I reckon. Kinda raggedy. I know how come you could make it out in this swamp without no gun or nothing. It's cos you know Indian ways. I heard tell you knowed a lot about Indians. I used to hunt with a half-breed afore my trouble. Indians knowed a heap of things, Ben. They buried their dogs with them cos they figured a dog had a soul just like a man's. I don't see no sense in a thing like that. You say a dog is dead when he dies. I don't see how come that should be. Don't he breathe like you? And ain't he got a heart, and feelings, and a heap of sense? Look at this skeeter trying to get his sticker into me. Ain't he got life in him, just like me? Not now, he ain't. You ain't killed him. His life's just gone somewheres else. If you're so sure you're gonna go on living after you're dead, Tom, what about that man you killed? Ain't you gonna be kinda feared to face Shep Collins up yonder? I never killed Shep Collins. Why, he was shot dead with your own gun, wasn't he? I remember that. Sheriff Jeb tell how you bashed him in the head and escaped, just afore he was gonna hang you. Sure. I wasn't gonna hang for something I never done. Ain't there no way to make Sheriff Jeb get at the truth? No, Ben. I'm gonna live and die in this old swamp. But I don't mind, if my Julie ain't left to run wild and shift for herself. You're gonna help me take care of her. I wish you'd smile at me, Miss Hannah, like you used to. I waited for Thursday to go fox-hunting. As soon as I heard his dog sound off, I sneaked over here. Listen. The more little foxes they chase, the better I like it. I'd rather you worry about me this way than about that old man. I ain't worried about you. Thursday could break you in pieces with one hand. The Dorsons might say something about that. Somebody might get killed. Why, I seen them once with my own eyes when... - You seen what? - Never you mind. They don't like Thursday. They'd be purely pleased if they had a good reason to do something about it. - That's what I'm afeard of. - Shucks, this ain't no way for us to talk. I'd rather die than quarrel with you. I'm cold-out crazy about you. You know I am. Go away, Jesse. Go away and don't never come back no more. - Hannah, don't go away. - No. Go away and leave me alone. Go away. Please. Please. - Go away, please. - Hannah. Hannah. - Thursday. - You stop, sir. Stop, sir. You hear me? Stop, sir. Hannah, where are you? - Are you all right? - I'm all right. Who was it? Who was it, Hannah? - You're limpin'. How'd you hurt yourself? - Never mind my limpin'. I asked who it was. Why, I... - You know you it was, don't you? - No. No, I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? He had hold of you. I don't know. I didn't reckon for you to lie to me, Miss Hannah. I can't tell you, Thursday, I can't. I kind of begin to see. - You told him when to come. - No, I never. He just knowed. This ain't the first time. No. I can't hardly believe it, Miss Hannah. You gotta tell me who it were. - I can't do that. - You've got to. I can't. I know what would happen - you'd go at him with your gun. Well, there ain't so many men in this country I can't figure it out for myself. Tell me how you hurt yourself. I can help you. No. No, you can't, Miss Hannah. Si, Si. Come on inside if you want to see something you never did see afore. Aye-yippety-aye. Ain't that a leather-headed old rip? That's the biggest panther skin I ever seen. - Where'd you catch him? - In the swamp. - How'd you get him? - We got him with buckshot. - You was with somebody? - I mean, me and my dog. I knowed you had a smart dog, Ben, but I never heard he could handle a shotgun. - You know what I mean. - No, I ain't certain, Ben, yet. - I ain't neither. - That panther ain't nothing. If you think you're big trappers, you oughta see the rest of them hides Ben brung in. Honest to Katy, he's got that old shack of Marty's just plumb full of otter skins. He sure has. I declare I never seen the like. You'll see a sight better when we go trapping Okefenokee with Ben. Bud and me's got more traps than you, but we'll just share and share alike. How about it? - I ain't taking no partners. - What you got against us? - I run my traps alone, that's all. - That's all you're telling. Never mind. We'll trap that swamp alone and keep the third share for ourselves. It can't be so hard to find your way around, not if you done it. It took me two weeks to find my way out. Even my dog didn't know which way to turn. So you gave him your shotgun to tote and you found your own way out. I wish you would go into that swamp. I just wish you would try it. I'm thinking you would find a big surprise. Marty, gimme a bottle of that red liquor. I want to buy Ben Ragan a drink. Give him a bottle of that panther water, Marty. Two drinks of that and they'll go into the swamp and rassle a bull gator. - Guess. - Couldn't be nobody but you, Ben. - Howdy, Mabel. - Where you been at so long? I told you two weeks ago. Or have you forgot already? - Two weeks is a long time. - I told you I'd get back for tonight. I got us a loan of Marty McCord's horse to take us to the dance. I'm going with somebody else. I told you you'd better get back. - I told you I'd get back, and here I am. - Ben, you ain't the only pebble on the beach. You just expect a girl to sit around and wait for you. Well, I waited, waited, and yesterday when you didn't show up I said yes. To who? Good friend. You might as well know who. It's Miles Tonkin. - Him. - You sound mighty jealous to me. Why should I getjealous? I got me a somebody I can take to that dance. All right, get mad about it. Who else can you take? That's all right who. Ain't no other girls in town that ain't got a man. I got me a somebody all right. You're lying, Ben Ragan. You can't get another girl for that dance within a day's horse ride, and you know it. Maybe I'll let you dance with me. Well, if my friend don't mind. I can't make no promises. I'll let you know tonight, Ben. - Why, hello, Miles. - Howdy. Howdy, Mabel. What time do you want me to be coming around to take you to the dance tonight? Julie. Hello, Ben. Mrs McCord. - Is this a pretty dress? - It's a beautiful dress. - How much? - It's a dollar and a half. Well, I want it. What did we come for, Thursday, if we ain't gonna dance? We'll keep on coming, Miss Hannah, till you point him out. All right. I'll know who it was when I see him. Howdy, Ben. Why, Julie. I hardly knowed you. - She looks pretty. - Hello, Julie. Hello, Ben. - Hello, John. Howdy. - That's a mighty pretty outfit. Come on back, Julie. - You sure look pert, Julie. - How come you're here, young 'un? - I brung her, Marty. - Why, Julie. Howdy, Mabel. It's no use, Ben. I can't. Well, let's sit down for a minute, Julie. - Howdy, Miss Hannah. - Evening, Ben. - Howdy. - Howdy. This here's Miss Julie... Miss Gordon. Sure. I seen you at Mrs McCord's. You look pretty. I've been a-watching you with Ben. Thank you. Ain't you Tom Keefer's young 'un? Yes, sir. I ain't gonna have nobody running her down. I don't aim to have words with none of my kin in public. I didn't mean no offence. You're the one that seemed ashamed to say her name, not me. Don't quarrel with him, Ben. He ain't hisself. He's just mad cos I won't take his bossing. Now, Ben. You go cool off outside and leave us womenfolk together. - Good evening, Ben. - Howdy, Sheriff. - Ain't dancing, Mr Ragan? - You know the reason why. Can't you leave her alone neither? Thought you was supposed to be a-courting me, Ben. So did I. Hope you don't expect me to just sit around the house and sew all the time you're monkeying around in that old swamp. I expect nothing from you but a bossified tongue and a cussing out. You ain't felt my tongue yet, Ben. - That's no way to talk. - I suppose Miles wouldn't talk like that. No, he wouldn't. He's a gentleman. Why don't you get back in there and do-si-do with him so I can dance with my girl? - You little cat. - You leave me alone. Leave her alone, Ragan. Guess he won't bother you no more. Look out! Stop them! Stop them! Stop. Excuse me. Come on, Ben. Get him. Get away from me, will you, Mabel? For the love of Katy, what are you boys a-fighting about? Who started this ruckus? Me and Ben was just arguing. Miles didn't have no call to come butting in. He fit for you. He can have you. Take care, Ben. I got a good idea what you're up to. You get on home. Ben? Hardy, you go on back to the dance. Miles Tonkin. Wish I'd have come out sooner - I'd have kicked him. I reckon he ain't to blame. Now I know why you took me to the dance, I guess. Why? Cos Mabel McKenzie's your girl. Not any more she ain't. Maybe I did so, Julie, but I'm right proud I took you. It's funny, I never noticed, you're a heap prettier than Mabel is. - If you was a little bigger. - I could grow more, maybe. From now on I ain't gonna court nobody else, Julie. If you've got no objection. I've got no objection. I never in my life asked for no kiss, I always just took 'em. But dogged if I ain't asking you now, Julie. Do you mind? I don't mind. - That come from Marty's pigpen, didn't it? - Yes, Ben. You wait here. Hurry up, boys. We've been a-waiting for you. - Howdy, neighbour. - Howdy, boys. - Where's Thursday? - His horse went lame. Turned back to get his gelding, said to go ahead with the meeting. Well, most of us is here. Go ahead, Tulle. Let's get down to cases. Well, men, I hate to say this, but it looks to me like we got a hog thief amongst us. It sure does, Tulle. Kiss Katy if it don't. Howdy. I reckon the somebody you've come to see is out in the kitchen. I didn't come to see nobody. Heard you all was meeting on account on them hog thieves. Don't know nothing about no thieves. We was aiming to catch just one of them scoundrels. - Hope to Katy there ain't two of 'em around. - Maybe there is. - Hot dang, what you driving at anyway? - What do you know about this business? I got me a good idea them missing hogs is within ten miles of here. If they ain't been rafted down the river and sold. If you know so much about it, maybe you had a finger in it. You been away a lot lately. Yeah. I been away trapping, like you and Bud. - Why... - Hold on. You know Ben don't mean nothing. Don't cut the fool. This ain't no fooling matter. I tell you it ain't. You're getting too big for your breeches. - Now, now, Bud. - All of you for coffee? - Coffee, Mr Ragan? - No, thanks, ma'am. How's your friend getting on in the swamp? Well? Why don't you tell Sheriff Jeb who's a-hiding in the swamp? Might be the hog thief you've been looking for. - Coffee? - Thank you. - What does she mean? - I don't know. - We knew you had somebody in that swamp. - That right? That's the place a hog thief'd hole up, in Okefenokee. Who's a-hiding in that swamp, son? - Couldn't be Tom Keefer, could it, Ben? - Tom Keefer. She's cold-out crazy. Seems to me you're kinda crazy, Ben, taking up with that young 'un of Keefer's. I wouldn't have knowed who was helping you but for that. - Be dogged if she ain't right. - Sure she is. Now I guess you know where your hog thief is. Them hog thieves is right here on this porch, and you know it. - You'd better shut him up. - Lookit here, Ben. Is Tom Keefer in the swamp? - Answer him, boy. - Ask her, she knows so much about it. - We done heard from her, we asking you. - Is it Keefer in that swamp? Listen to me, Keefer done a murder. Are you sticking by him or us? - He didn't do no murder. - You gotta tell us where Keefer's at. - You figured it out for yourself, go get him. - I will, but you're gonna show us the way. - I got something to say about that. - I don't think so. Don't you get in my way, you Dorsons. Don't you get in my way. Either you tell or you're gonna get ducked. Wait a minute. Come on, Ben, give up. Make it easy on yourself. Now's the time to do it. It's only right we catch that murdering Keefer. We need your help. - We aim to have your word afore we leave. - You sure won't get it. - Ain't no use argufying with him. - Let's put him under. Leave him up, Dorson. Leave him up. - You ready to talk? - You'd better say something. - Say something, Ben. - Are you gonna say it? You can't make me. Let's drown the rat. Bless Katy, I never see a body so stubborn. Where's everybody? Down at the crick. Stop! You Dorsons, get that boy out of there. Get away. Get out of the way. You hear me? Get him out. - He knows where Keefer's hiding. - And we're making him tell. Get him out. Get him out. - Untie him. - We wasn't aiming to harm him none. Get away, all of you. Ben. Ben. You're gonna be all right, son. If you'd have minded me and kept out of that swamp like I told you, Ben, you wouldn't be in no fix like you're in. What's the matter, boy? If you'll be giving me my clothes, I'll be taking myself off your hands. You be quiet now. You're sick, Ben. I ain't so sick I have to lay here and listen to you giving me down-the-country. I knowed that was all you drug me out of that crick for. I drug you out because you was my boy. You're home, Ben. You and me ain't gonna have no more disputes. Howdy, Matt. Howdy, Mrs McCord. Marty here? - Take them out of here. - I've brung 'em to sell, same as always. - Take 'em out. - What's wrong with them hides? I can smell Tom Keefer on 'em. I figured you wouldn't hold nothing against me. If you aim to have truck with such as Keefer, aim to sell his hides somewheres else. - Where else? - Take 'em to Savannah like I have to. I ain't got no way to get to Savannah. That's too far. Well, you'll have to get them out of here. - How am I gonna make my living? - Well, that's up to you. My wife says to tell you to clear out that shack too. I'm fixing to clear out. - Marty? - Yeah? Are y'all going fox-hunting tonight? Yeah. We're a-hunting. I'm sure gonna miss that dog of yourn. Goodbye, Mrs McCord. Howdy, Sheriff. Julie. Oh, Julie. You told 'em. You told on him. You told on my father. - I didn't aim to... - You didn't have no right to do it. Now they're gonna catch him. I heard Sheriff Jeb tell it. Them Dorsons is gonna help. - You're worse than that Miles Tonkin. - You don't know how it happened. I ain't gonna speak to you again. I won't come to the shack. I ain't gonna cook your food or make your bed. I ain't. Ain't nobody gonna catch your father because I ain't gonna leave them. Oh, Ben. I ain't never gonna believe you again. Never. You gotta trust me. Ain't I always told you the truth? Ain't I kept money for you? I ain't gonna touch it. Keep the money or throw it away. I won't never touch it. I was only a-saving it for him. Now you've killed him. No, I ain't neither, I tell you. Julie. Down, Dorcas, down. Listen to them, Trouble. That's a stomp-down good race they're having. That old grey fox is leading 'em on a run now, ain't she? Let's me and you slip and go, irregardless. Best stay here tonight. Don't reckon you need to wait for no invitation. Miss Hannah. - What's wrong 'tween you and him? - I can't tell you. How come? I couldn't stand it if you got down on me too. Is it something you done? Maybe it'll make me feel better if I tell you. Dorcas. Ever since then, Thursday don't go nowhere. Just sits around here watching me, waiting for that man to come back. I told him it wouldn't happen no more, but he won't listen. I've been wishing I were dead. I didn't ever reckon it was nothing like that, Miss Hannah. I wish I hadn't a-told you. Thursday? It's not Thursday, Jesse. It's me. - Oh, Ben. - Were you expecting Thursday? Why should I? Course, if you got anything to say to him, Jesse, I know where you can find him. - I ain't got nothing to say to him. - Maybe he'd have something to say to you. I ain't never done no harm to Thursday. I never done nothing to him. What do you think he'd say if I was to tell him where I found your guitar? Go ahead and tell him. He won't come near me, he'd be afraid. He'd break you into a thousand pieces. I got friends looking out for me. You know what they'd do. They gave you a taste of it. The Dorsons. I was forgetting about them. Yes, siree. The Dorsons ain't gonna let nothing happen to me. What are you looking at me that way for? What are you saving that for, Jesse? That? I got lots of things. Yeah, that's right. You was quite a big man at that trial, wasn't you, Jesse? There was only three witnesses agin Tom Keefer. There was Bud and Tim Dorson, and you - all telling the same story, word for word. Three agin one, that right? - We only told what we saw. - Yeah. Maybe you did and maybe you didn't. I know Tom Keefer, I know he couldn't commit no murder. But you could. And so could Bud and Tim Dorson. - You're crazy. I wouldn't kill a kitten. - No, well, maybe you didn't. But now I'm beginning to see the light. I'm beginning to understand why them Dorsons always stand up for you, and why you always trail around after them. No, Ben. There ain't nothing like that. You're wrong, Ben. No, I'm not wrong, Jesse. You killed him. Or the Dorsons done it and you seen 'em. That's it. It's just as plain as the look on your face. You're just as guilty as they are, and if they hang for it, you're gonna hang too. Don't talk like that, Ben. I ain't done nothing. The only chance for you to save your hide is to tell the truth, now. I can't do that. I can't, Ben. Bud Dorson would kill me. Bud won't kill nobody. You speak your piece, I'll get Keefer to back you up. Then the Dorsons'll be at the wrong end of a rope. I can't do it, Ben. I can't do anything like that. All right, Jesse. You just suit yourself. But either you come with me right now to see Sheriff Jeb or I'm taking you to Thursday. You ain't got no other choice - Sheriff Jeb or Thursday. I'd choose Sheriff Jeb, make a clean breast of it and get free of them Dorsons for good. All right. Come on, it's one or the other. See? Ain't no Dorsons there. I can't do it, Ben. I can't do it. It's too late to back down now. Ain't nobody gonna harm you for telling the truth. Ben Ragan, what are you a-doing here? Jesse's got something to tell you, Sheriff Jeb. Then it's purely up to you what I do. Well, go on, Jesse. Don't be ascared. Tell them who killed Shep Collins. What I said in court wasn't true. Julie. Julie, you inside? Go away. You ain't got no right here. - I gotta see you. - I don't never want to see you no more. But you don't understand. I'm going in the swamp to get your father. You're getting him so they can hang him. No, Julie. It ain't what you think. He's a-coming out for good. I done fixed everything. I made Jesse Wick tell the truth. They wouldn't believe my father, they ain't gonna believe no Jesse Wick. That's why I'm bringing your father out. Sheriff Jeb's got Jesse Wick's affidavit. He can't go back on that. Tomorrow he'll have Tom's. Let me talk to you, Julie. Let me see you. Julie. You sure he can come out? And no one'll hurt him? I'm plumb sure, Julie. Bright and early in the morning they're gonna pick you up and take you right in Sheriff Jeb's boat down to meet your daddy. And I ain't gonna say a word to Tom about you waiting there, Julie. We're gonna surprise him. Show him how pretty you growed up to be. We can live on our farm again - like folks. That's just the way it's gonna be, Julie. All Tom's troubles is over, past and gone and forgotten. You know what he said to me once? Living in the swamp was like living on another star. Now it'll be like coming back into the world again. - Ben. Oh, Ben. - Julie. Not now, you fool. - Howdy, Ben. - Howdy. Sure glad to see you. For the first time in years I've been real lonesome. I've been missing this old hound here. - Get in this canoe, Tom. - How come? I've come to take you out of the swamp. I got a confession from Jesse Wick. Sheriff Jeb said that you can come out free. All you have to do is face them Dorsons and everything'll be like it was before. - You ain't one to joke, are you? - It's the God's truth. You're free. You and Julie is gonna live again like folks. - You mean I can just up and go out of here? - Sure I do. Sheriff Jeb and Marty are gonna be waiting at the gator hole at the edge of the swamp. There's a trick in that. All they want to do is get their hands on me. You must be crazy, Tom. My own father'll be there. And Hardy and Fred Ulm and John Dekle and Marty McCord, like I told you. I never figured you wouldn't believe me. - They talked you into it, Ben. - No, they ain't, Tom. They done talked you into it. All they want to do is catch me. - They was always agin me and they still is. - I'm telling you the truth. I ain't agin you. If I was, I'd have brought them in here, wouldn't I? I wouldn't be taking you out. Maybe so, but if you're wrong, I'm the one that has to pay for it. You know that. I told you who'd be waiting there. If their word ain't no good, the word of the Holy Bible ain't, I reckon. It's like being dead all these years. Now you're a-telling me to come back to life again. I gotta be alone a minute, Ben. Trouble. You stay here, you old fool. Won't be no more hiding now. Afore long you'll be eating your own corn and roasting your own shoats. Yeah, and Julie'll roast it for me. Do you know, Ben, can she cook? Sure she can. Right good. Say, Ben, tell me, how does she look? Is she pretty? Well, Tom, I wouldn't exactly say she took after you. Well, no. I don't reckon she got no whiskers. You take Keefer. I want that squealing shoat of a Ragan. Around that turn, we'll be in sight of the cross. - Only couple more minutes. - They'll all be waiting to tell me I'm free. That's right. The whole lot of them. - Did you get 'em? - I ain't sure. Shove over to the other bank. Come up around behind them. - You was lying. - No, I wasn't. You set 'em on me. I should've cut your throat the first time you came at me, like I wanted to. - Why, you're crazy, Tom. - I was crazy to trust you. I'd be crazy to trust anyone. I thought there was good people in the world, but they ain't. We can't stay and talk. Them Dorsons is coming. You know who it is? That proves you sicked 'em on me. It couldn't be nobody else. Jesse must've told 'em. - You mean you told 'em. - They hate me as bad as they do you. I'm your friend, Tom, I swear it. I wouldn't do nothing like this to you. - We'll find out. - What do you mean? How? We'll prove it. Show yourself to 'em. Show yourself to 'em, and if they don't shoot, I'll know you're on their side. Trying to get me killed? I'm trying to find out if there's anyone in the world that can speak the honest truth. You needn't be afraid. They ain't gonna shoot at you. Because you're in cahoots with 'em. Now, go on. Show yourself. Go on. Show yourself. All right, Tom. If that's what you think, I'll show you. - Are you hurt, bud? - I don't reckon so. I'm sorry, Ben. We gotta get them cooters. This way, Ben. When they shoot again, make out like you was hit, then follow me. Got him, Tim. We can rush Keefer. No, Ben. Around. Leave something here. Drop yourjacket. That's a bog hole. It'll suck you right under. Look. There ahead, yonder. Tim, hurry. I'm sinking. Get me out of here. Hurry. Here. Hold the rifle butt. Hang onto that gun. Tim. I'm sinking in this mud. Hurry. Hurry. Stay out there, Tim. Pull. Go on, pull. You ain't pulling, Tim. Tim, darn it. - Don't let me die in this mud. - I'm pulling you. Don't you understand? Don't let me die in Okefenokee. Pull me out. Tim. Tim. Bud. All right, Ben. He ain't gonna do nothing. Get up. Get up. It's too bad about Bud, Tim, but maybe it's better that way. - Reckon he won't have to hang, anyway. - No. Don't sound so good to you, does it, Tim? Didn't sound good to me when the judge said I had to hang for a murder you and Bud done. And all this time you been living free in the outside world, along with all the people. I never done no murder, Tim, but you sent me in here to live. 700 miles of swamp and wilderness. And not a human being. But I lived. Maybe you'll be able to live too. Cos that's where you're heading right now, Tim. If you can learn to live with cottonmouths and gators and panthers and places where there ain't a bit of ground to stand on, I reckon you're welcome to your life. Now get going. Get going. And if you ever find your way out, Sheriff Jeb'll be waiting with a rope to hang you. Come on, Trouble. Our boat's up beyond a-ways, Tom. I've been thinking, Ben, maybe you'd better take me back to my island. What for, Tom? You're coming with me to your Julie. I ain't sure I can live out there again, and this is my home. Maybe I'd better make sure Tim Dorson is good and losted. You can't do that, Tom. Julie's waiting for you, and all the folks you used to know and love. That's them. Come on, now, Tom. Julie. You want to see her, don't you? You wouldn't want to hurt her. There they come. There's Julie. Hello. Daddy. Daddy.

Whoopee! Whoopee! What a wild man you are, Bill! Wild enough to tame you! Oh, yeah! Yeah!  Oh! A cowboy's a wild man But, oh, what a mild man the wildest of cowboys can be  One girl can subdue him If she'll bill and coo him  Then goodbye to his liberty I'm married, so take it from me, gee! Cowboy, you're gone from the start With the lassie who lassoes your heart Oh, she takes just one look at you And, cowboy, your wild days are through You go out and buy her the tiniest size in rings She ties you tight to the end of her apron strings And cowboy you're branded right from the start By the lassie who lassoes your heart Whoopee! Whoopee! Whoopee! Whoopee! Cowboy, you're gone from the start With the lassie who lassoes your heart Oh, she takes just one look at you And, cowboy, your wild days are through You go out and buy her the tiniest size in rings She ties you tight to the end of her apron strings And cowboy you're branded right from the start By the lassie who lassoes your heart!  Hey, Sheriff Bob, how do you like these outfits we rented for your wedding? You look like a bunch of scared coyotes. Why, that sick cuss Henry Williams told us this is the right way to dress. Henry Williams did, eh? Yeah! Well, he was kidding you, you dumb critters! Well, if he was, we're gonna do a little kidding ourselves when we catch hold of him! Come on, fellas. Let's go on. Let's go get him. Here's that stuff from the drugstore, Miss Custer! Thank you, Bud. Costs 15 bucks. Why, that's cheap. Here's your change. Thank you. Say, is that guy Henry Williams really as sick as he thinks he is? He's so full of pills, they can't operate on him. He keeps rolling off the table! Come on, sweetheart. Come on, little girl. Come on, darling! There you are! Come on in! There you go! There you are! Henry Williams, what's that? Condensed milk. What are you going to do with the calf? Miss Custer, remember, I'm lonesome, and I need a companion. Well, if you want a companion, why don't you get a nice girl? Well, that's a good idea, too. But I don't know, I feel so safe with a calf. Give me that. Well, I don't mean that. Miss Custer, leave my baby go! Oh, please leave her go. Go on, you troublemaker! Miss Custer, I don't think I'll be troubling you much longer! Don't talk like that, Henry. Why, when you came west a year ago, you may have been sick then, but now you're as healthy as I am! Is that good? There's really nothing the matter with you. Nothing the... What about the pain around my heart? That'll go away. Yeah, and I'll go with it. And then how about my stomach? Just a little indigestion. A little indigestion! My stomach is so bad when my grandfather died, he left me $20,000, and in six weeks, I'd spent it all on milk of magnesia. Would you believe that? And what about my lungs? The doctor says your lungs are practically brand new. They should be. I've never used them. For nine years, I've been breathing with my liver. Henry, you are just a hypochondriac! Yes, am I? How would you like to see my operation? No, no, sit down. Poor Henry, let me hold your hand. It's not heavy. I can manage. Hold your own hand. Oh, Henry, when I do hold your hand, like this, and put my arm around you and kind of snuggle up to you like that, doesn't it suggest anything to you? Yes, it does, but with my health, I'd better not think about it. Sit down. Henry, I've been your nurse for three years now, haven't I? Nurse for three years. Do you know why I studied nursing? No, why? Because I'm romantic. No. Most girls like big, strong, healthy men. Husky, husky. Yeah, but not me. No? I like weak men. Oh. I have a positive passion for a weak man. I suppose if I was paralyzed, you'd be cuckoo about me, huh? Silly. Henry. I'll bet you don't know what today is. What is today? Today is Sally's wedding day. Can't you feel it, Henry? It's in the air! It's all around us. Romance! Look in my eyes, Henry! I'm looking. You know I love you. Oh, Miss Custer! And you know that I'm sure that you love me! Oh, please, Miss Custer! Oh, Henry, don't you know how I feel? Henry, marry me! Put me down! Put me down! Put me down. Listen, darling! Get away with your passion. You give me goose pimples. Will you go away? Go away. Oh, Henry, please. Please, marry me. Why, I'd take such good care of you. I'd keep you comfy and warm! But it would be much cheaper for me to get a hot water bottle. Go ahead, will you, Miss Custer? Oh, how can you hurt a person's feeling? I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I've offended you. But you work me up to such a pitch with your lovemaking. Why do you do it? You know I'm not well. Why do you make overtures to me when I need intermissions so badly? Besides, Miss Custer, I couldn't marry you. I'm too delicate. But I love you that way. Yes, but it wouldn't be fair to our children to be born without vitamins. Oh, Miss Custer. Oh, Henry, you must love me. You're breathing so heavily. That's not love, you fool. That's my asthma. Now, wait a minute. What are you doing that for? Aren't you supposed to be my nurse? What do you say, boys? How are you, Wanenis? Hello, Dick. I'm glad to see you! We ain't seen much of you around here since you graduated from college. Where you been? Why, I've been down in Montana, laying out copper mines! Oh, that's right. You're a regular mining engineer now, ain't you? I'm working at it. How come you're here today? Oh, got kind of lonesome for the old stamping grounds and all the friends I left here. Sure tough that Wanenis came back here today. Why? Well, the poor galoot's been in love with Sally ever since they were kids. He's part Indian, and her old man wouldn't let them get hitched. That's why he went away! What are you doing here? Who invited you? Invited me? Why, I didn't know I needed an invitation, Mr. Morgan. I've always been welcome here before. Sally is marrying Bob Wells today. I shouldn't think that you would want to be at her wedding. If I were you, I'd go. Your father will tell you that I'm right. Him right. Maybe you come now, huh? Best for you. Black Eagle know. Black Eagle, I must see Sally. No. I'm going to her. No. Oh, hello, fellas. How are you? Hello. How's every... How have you... Hello. Hello. You know, when I was a kid... Nobody cares about when you was a kid. Say, listen, you dressed us up like this, didn't you? Well, I hope you appreciate it. Yes, and to show you how much we appreciate it, we're gonna dress you up! But I don't want to be dressed up... Wanenis. Sally. Please come down. I must speak to you. Wanenis. Then you're going to marry Bob Wells? I knew this would happen, but it hurts. Father wants me to marry Bob. And since we can't have one another, I just don't care. It's your father who convinced me that our marriage was impossible, 'cause I'm an Indian. Wanenis, don't. I'm sorry, Sally. I know it's wrong of me to make you sad on your wedding day. Please forgive me. I wish you every happiness. I know I can't have you. But I can't bear the thought of anyone else having you.  When the winter's over  When the summer's through  When there's prairie clover  I'll still belong to you  Far above the plain  When the moon is new  When it's on the wane  I'll still belong to you Winds may blow as though they know what I've told you  Yet the more they blow  The closer I'll hold you  Though the world may take me  From a world for two  Though you may forsake me  I'll still belong  To you  Sally. Sally! Sally, please come back. Sally. Why, Wanenis, I didn't know that was you. I thought it was some skunk prowling around. You know, you can't be too careful at a time like this. I suppose you came back to see me marry Sally? If you'd like to take another shot at me, give me a gun, and we'll shoot it out together. I don't fight with Indians. I don't want you hanging around here anymore, and neither does Sally. Savvy? Listen, fellas. If you see him or anyone else trying to go up that ladder again, next time... Better you come now, huh? Come, Wanenis. Come. Miss Custer! Oh, Miss Custer! Miss Custer! Miss Custer! Where is that woman? Where is that nurse? Miss... Wanenis! Hello, Henry. How are you? Hello, Black Eagle. I'm glad to see you. Yeah, me too. I haven't seen you in a long time. That's right. How's your health? I'm sorry you asked. Last week, I looked so terrible, two undertakers left a deposit on me. And say, what's happened to you? What's the matter? It's nothing, Henry. Just a scratch. I'm in a little trouble. Yeah, you're in a little trouble. All you've got is a scratch. Look at me. I've got five dangerous ailments, with hardly a chance of recovering. And, oh, look where cactus is growing. Henry, I'm in love. That's hard luck, too. Last week, I bought a suit with two pairs of pants and burned a hole in the coat. But I've lost the girl that I love, and my heart is very heavy today. Your heart is heavy? My heart is five times the normal size. But you don't understand. This girl and I grew up together. I am an Indian! He suffers from gas, too. Isn't it terrible? Why, Henry, a way back, my people were chiefs. Why don't you try bicarbonate of soda? You'll be a new Indian, really. But I'm only a small part Indian. How small? Well, my great-grandfather married a white girl. So did mine. What is that? Did you know that I'm a half-breed? Are you a half-breed? Sure. I breathe through one side of my nose. Sinus. For this girl that I love, I've studied the ways of your race. Why, I've gone to your schools. An Indian in a Hebrew school! How... Oh, for heaven... How did you get along? About since I was that high, I've striven to be something among your people. I know. We all have our disappointments. From the time I was this high... That's even lower than yours. See that? I figured out someday I might be a great aviator like Lindbergh or Byrd. But I can never be an aviator. Can't eat sandwiches. Why don't you be like me? I've been delicate all my life, but I wouldn't let any woman boss me around, tell me what to do. Henry! I'll see you boys later, all right. Henry Williams! What are you doing with my bloomers? Whose bloomers? I'm not doing anything. Now, you keep away from my trunk! This is the happiest day of my life! You go to the mission, Bob, and I'll fetch Sally right over. She ought to be all ready by now! Thanks, Mr. Morgan. Wait a minute, wait a minute, girls! You've got plenty of time, really. Every time I hear that dear, old wedding march  I feel rather glad I have a broken arch I have heard a lot of married people talk And I know that marriage is a long, long walk To most people weddings mean romance But I prefer a picnic or a dance  Another bride  Another groom  The countryside  Is all in bloom  The flowers and treeses  The birds and beeses  Are making whoopee  The choir sings  Here comes the bride  Another victim  Is by her side  He's lost his reason  'Cause it's the season  For making whoopee Down through the countless ages  You'll find it everywhere  Somebody makes good wages  Somebody wants her share  She calls him toodles  And rolls her eyes  She makes him strudels  And bakes him pies  What is it all for?  It's so he'll fall for  Making whoopee  Another year  Or maybe less  What's this I hear?  Well, can't you guess?  She feels neglected  And he's suspected  Of making whoopee  She sits alone  Most every night  He doesn't phone  Or even write  He says he's busy  But she says, ""Is he?""  He's making whoopee  He doesn't make much money  Five thousand dollars per Some judge who thinks he's funny  Says, ""You pay six to her""  He says, ""Now, Judge""  ""Suppose I fail""  The judge says, ""Budge""  ""Right into jail""  You'd better keep her  You'll find it's cheaper  Than making whoopee  Henry! Henry, come here. What? I want you to do something for me! Sally Morgan, why aren't you in your wedding dress? Well, you see, I'm not going to be married. What? Not married in the mission, I mean. Sheriff Bob doesn't want these cowboys to get rough and boisterous. So he and I are going to sneak to town, get married there, and take a train east for our honeymoon. Honeymoon. That reminds me, you know, my sister's husband wanted to take her to Florida on their honeymoon, but she's been to Florida, so she sent a girlfriend. Now, listen! What? Sheriff Bob wants you to drive me to the junction. He'll meet us there. I'll go in and get my bags. Wait a minute, Sally, I'll help you. Don't do anything until you hear... Oh, for heaven's... Who did that? Who did... Just a little mistake, partner. Just a little mistake, that's all! Just a little mistake! I suppose to you the World War was just a typographical error! Just a little mistake! Henry! What? Get my bags quickly. All right, hurry up. I've got it, Sally. Here, got it? Take that! I've got it. Just come right down. Now, be careful of Polly. Right. I'll be careful. Come right down, Sally. I'll be waiting for you. Isn't she sweet? Just take care of yourself. I'll be all right. Come right along, Sally. Come here, Polly. What do you want? I want to make whoopee. She wants to make whoopee!  Today's the day  To hear the bridegroom say  ""I'll honor and obey""  Today's the day  Here comes the bride!  Tonight's the night  The stars will shine so bright The honeymoon will light our happy way  Here comes the bride! Spring is a rogue who lightly trips over all the hills and dales Love comes along and your heart skips Then you'll hear the wedding bells  And then you'll say  ""The world must be all right""  Today's the day, today Tonight's the night  Here comes the bride! Spring is a rogue who lightly trips over all the hills and dales Love comes along and your heart skips Then you'll hear the wedding bells  And then you'll say  ""The world must be all right""  Today's the day, today Tonight's the night  Sheriff! Boys! Boys! Where's Bob Wells? He's coming right over there! Sheriff! What's wrong? What's happened? Sally's gone! Gone? Where? What do you mean? I don't know. She isn't around anywhere! Has anyone seen Henry? Here's a note I found on the post! ""Dear Father. Don't be angry with me. ""I just can't marry Bob Wells. ""I love another, and don't look for me, ""because when you receive this, we will be far away."" ""I have eloped with Henry Williams."" Henry Williams! Well, if she loves him, I hope she's happy, wherever she is. And I wish them luck! Luck! I'll wish them luck! When I catch him, I'll hang him to the highest tree I can find! Has anyone... Sheriff, have you seen Henry? No, but when I do, you'll never see him again! Oh, Sheriff, you've got Henry all wrong. Why, he's the sweetest, most harmless little fellow in the whole world! Say, what did he do? He eloped with Sally Morgan! The son of a hypochondriac. I'll kill him! Boys, come here. Jim, Jack, Joe, Tex, Slim. You know what we do with a critter who steals a horse? Yes. Well, this one just stole my woman. Get into your saddles, because we're gonna ride him down, boys, and then we're gonna hang him up. Don't let a white man get by you! Come on! Henry! Henry! Henry, where are you? Here I am! I've been asleep. Why don't you start the car? That's a good idea. That's what I've been trying to do for the last half an hour. Have you got gas? Have I got... The way I suffer? Have I got gas? No, no. I mean, have you got gasoline? Of course I have gasoline. How do you think we came here, with ketchup? This shows that I have gasoline, here. Oh, for the... Not a drop. I'm not well. I thought you'd be the man to help me. I thought you'd be the man to save me. And you didn't even know enough to fill your gas tank! Oh, for the love of... What's the matter? I haven't any more circulation than a herring. Here you are, bawling me out, and my temperature drops to normal! If you keep me out in these mountains all night, you won't have to worry about your health, because Bob Wells will kill you! What do you mean? I do him a favor, and he'll kill me? I take you to the sheriff so he can marry you, and he's gonna shoot me because I run out of gasoline! Henry, you might as well know the truth. You're not taking me to the sheriff. You're taking me away from him! I'm... Oh, I see. You just left out the details. And I left a note saying that I had eloped with you. You did what? Sally Morgan, I'm going to tear you limb from limb. Henry, I did it because I thought you'd help me. I thought you were brave. I'm not brave. I can't even help myself. Sally Morgan, I came out here to die. Then it's all right, because if Bob Wells catches us, you'll get your wish. But I don't want to die from Bob Wells! I want to die from my sicknesses. That's what I want to die from. I want to die in bed, and I want to have doctors and nurses and flowers and a little fruit. That's what I want. Oh, for heaven's... See, you've got me nervous and jumpy. What am I going to do if the sheriff comes? Take this! Put it away! I can't stand the sight of a gun. I hate guns! Put it away. I don't like guns. Even when somebody says ""son of a gun,"" I almost faint. Sally Morgan, I'm going to take you back to the sheriff. Rather than go back to him, I'll marry you. Two proposals in one day. It's that tonic. It's that tonic! Henry, I mean it. Why don't you marry me and take me east? It's impossible. You know, we wouldn't really have to be man and wife. Secretly, we can be just good friends! Yeah, but I can't keep a secret. And furthermore, you know, people will talk. And you've always been a good girl. Don't you think I am still? Well, I do, but... But what? When is a good girl not a good girl? Nine times out of ten. Henry, you're only fooling. You've never really been in love. I haven't? Listen, Sally. Love came to me in the springtime  Just like the blossoms, I fell I thought that June would be ring time Which proves that you never can tell  I used to call her pet names  Tell her she was divine But she turned out to be the girlfriend  Of a boy friend of mine  I used to take her places  She loved to dance and dine But she turned out to be the new friend  Of an old friend of mine I found that love was just a joke I learned what a broken heart meant  I even started out to get  A kitchenette apartment She thrilled me with her glances  Her kisses were just like wine But she turned out to be the close friend  Of a Scotch friend of mine  I thought that we'd be married  Sign on the dotted line But she turned out to be the girlfriend  Of a boy friend of mine Listen, Sally, each time I try to phone her, what do I get?  Just a busy line 'Cause she turned out to be the soul mate  Of a cellmate of mine Life to me once was one big thrill  Nobody could be prouder  Now life is just a bitter pill  A capsule and a powder  Why am I pale and nervous?  Why do I weep and pine? 'Cause she turned out to be the real friend  Of a heel friend of mine  Oh, I'm so tired! Henry, let's lie down and go to sleep. I wouldn't sleep. Sally, you lie down and go to sleep. Let me stay here and fix the car, borrow some gasoline, and maybe we'll be on our way. See, Sally? Go on. Right to sleepy. Good night, Sally. Good night, Henry. Do you want to go right to sleep? Yes. And the mama skunk was walking along with the four little baby skunks. And one of the baby skunks said to the mama skunk, ""Oh, Mama. Look, here comes a great big bear."" And the mama skunk says, ""Children, let us pray. Let us pray."" What are you doing? Hello! Say, look out there! Let us pass! Don't block the road, please! What is it? What has happened? Oh, look, it's a big Lincoln. Say, can we have some gasoline? Hey, you. Get out of the way. I can't stand this. I'm a very nervous man. He's a nervous man. All we need is two gallons of gasoline. We haven't any gas to give away! If you had any sense, you'd carry an extra can in country like this! Do you? Why, of course we do. You do and you refuse to help. Shame on you! Never mind, clear out of the way. I say, my man, that's a good old thing. Chase that bug off the road. The bug. Chase the bug... How do you like that? ""Chase the bug off the road."" Of course, you can't be expected to know the nervous condition that I am in. Stop that. Stop that! Hey, you going to get out of our way, or do I chase that flivver up the mountain? Didn't I tell you I need gasoline? Will you go and get out of the way... Would you stop it? I'm telling you. Stop. Give me something, give me... Here. What are you giving me? What is it? Don't shoot! Get up, up, up, up. Not you, you fool! And no funny movements, either. Say, you can't shoot a man like me! Shall I try? No. No. Get out of the car, everybody. Line up front, come on. We'll let you have a couple of gallons. Yes. You'll let me have anything that I want. Father, he doesn't know who you are! Who cares? What's that? Driver! Yes, sir! Get a can of gasoline. Yes, sir. Follow me! Yes, sir. Now, then, pour the gasoline in my tank! Yes, sir. Don't forget, my partner up there is looking at you with a gun. If you do anything funny, he'll fill you full of lead. Yes, sir. And, you, take this gun. If this fellow bats an eye, you shoot, and shoot to kill. What's that, Morris? I'll tell them. Never mind, I'll tell them. My partner up there said that somebody here wasn't holding up their hands high enough. What partner? My partner, he's up there. You want to hear him? Yes. You up there, Morris? ""You bet I am."" Shall I get him? ""All right."" See you later. ""All right."" Goodbye. ""Bye."" Good night. Oh, help! Help! Help! What was that? Who did it? Help! Help! Take care of yourself. What's the matter? Were you scared? - Pick up that can. - Yes, sir. Get over here. Yes, sir. Get over here with that! Yes, sir. You've got the better of us now, but in an hour, I'll have the sheriff of this county on your trail. You'll have who? The sheriff of this county! What do I care? He's under an obligation to me. You think I'm afraid of a sheriff? And you bet he'll get you. He's a regular man-hunter, that fellow Bob Wells. Bob Wells! Here. Here. Give me the gun, all of you. Thought I dropped the gun, did you? Each one of you four, get around to the tires. Yes, sir. Unscrew the valves, put in the small end and leak the air out. When I say, ""One, two,"" take her out. Now, get around in front of my car! I'll be hanged if I do! Turn around, or I'll shoot you right through the heart. Go ahead. Get around there. Get around there. Now, old man. I've got a surprise for you! What is it? What? Crank my flivver! Me, crank a flivver? Go on, you old crank. I'm a sick man! You're sick? I'd love to show you my operation! Would you... Go ahead, crank it. Go on. Get around there, crank it. Crank it. Come on. Boy, that's terrible. Well, I told you. I ain't no cook. Say, why don't you try it? Oh, there's nothing female about me, Mort. Now, listen. I'm in a fine fix. The boss is expected here today, and last night the cook lights out on me. And if I don't find a new cook, I'll have to find a new job. Get out, get out, Sally. Get out, Sally Morgan. What's the matter? I smell cooking. I hope we can get something to eat here. I'm starved. You're starved. I want to tell you something, Sally Morgan. I've had a piece of toast, two pieces of asparagus, and a bottle of Bromo-Seltzer since Easter Sunday. Would you believe that? Henry, you'd better take those glasses off! Why, don't be silly. I can't. Why not? With my eyes? Even when I go to sleep at night, I've got to keep my glasses on. What for? So I can recognize the people I dream about. Silly. Henry, please take the glasses off! Oh, all right. And whatever you do, don't use our right name! Well, of course not. Come in with me. I'll get you something to eat. Hello! Hello! Hello. Hello. Oh, look, it's the new zeppelin! Say, I'm nervous, and we're very hungry. We'd like to have something to eat. Oh, you would? Yes, personally, I'd like some hot water and prunes, bananas and cream, corn flakes, and boiled eggs, two minutes. If they're two and a half minutes, I can't eat it, because the acidity presses against my heart, and I've got to take six Bell-Ans in hot water. Say, who are you? What's your name? Henry. Henry what? Ford. Well, Mr. Ford. I've heard of you some place before. This is Mrs. Ford, of course! Of course. You see, we've just been married. She's one of those new Fords. Gosh. That's great! Hey! I'll be all right. Just let me take a nap. I feel good. I feel good. Go ahead. I bet you're a great cook, Mrs. Ford. Why, I've never cooked a thing in my life! Can you cook? Can I cook? That's swell. You get the job. We need a cook, and you're it. But... Now, don't argue. Get to work. It's exactly 7:00. I'm glad you... I've gotta take two pills. I've gotta take two pills. And at 8:00, I expect you to have breakfast ready. Now, don't try to get away. Your flivver will be locked up in the garage, and I'm still pretty handy with a six-shooter. Look, mister, I can't stand anything heavy on my stomach. Would you mind taking that... Get it! Get it! Hey! Get it! Here, here! Here you are. Here you are. There you are. You'll have to cut out this fooling, both of you. And get to work. Now, here's a cook's hat and coat. Yes, sir. Missus. You set the table in the patio, out yonder. Say, what... What are you gonna cook? Well, I don't know. For instance, tell me, what would you like? Well, a waffle would hit me all right. All right, I'll hit you with a waffle. I don't mind what I hit you with. Oh, my nerves. What a place! What a mess! Yes, and the worst part of it is, we've committed highway robbery. We could go to prison for that! Prison. Have they got doctors in prison? Why, yes. I'll be all right. I'll get along. I'll be all right. But they'll give you 20 years. Twenty years... What are you laughing at? Why, the joke's on them. Why? I can't live but six months. Oh, golly. You know, I never made a waffle in my life. I wouldn't know how to... Have you got a larger bowl?  I'm making waffles  I'm making waffles  I'm making waffles What is this? E-P-S-O-M. Epsom, Epsom, Epsom...  I'm making waffles  ""$500 reward..."" Hey, who are you? Me work here. Me Greek. You put that sign upstairs. Yeah, and I'm hungry to get that guy. You hungry? I fix you up. One roast beef, one buttered toast, one strawberry pie, one cups coffee... Hey, I don't want that stuff! You want something else. One fried egg, sunny-side up. Turn on the heat, turn on the heat  Hey, you're no Greek. Now, who are you? What do you care? I'm asking you, who are you? Don't ask so many questions. You remind me of my nurse when you... Oh, have you a nurse? I did have, but I got rid of the pest. She was a pest, huh? She was. She was worse than a pest. She was a seven-minute boiled egg. She was a blonde weasel. She was a phooey. That's what she was, that woman. Hey, you're not fooling me. I know you're Henry Williams. Henry... Who the... What the... How the... I did not. I did not. Now, where's Sally Morgan? Why, how do I know what Sally... Isn't she here? Why, no, honestly. No! But you love her, don't you? No, no, no. I could kiss you for that. Why do you want to kiss me? What kind of a cowboy are you? Henry, look, don't you know me? Miss Custer. So, I'm a blonde weasel, huh? Say... A phooey. I knew you all the time. Oh, yeah. You didn't fool me. You knew me, huh? Pick up your hat, go ahead. Go ahead, pick it up. Pick it up. Listen, Henry. Listen to me. Do you know that the cowboys and the sheriff are on your trail? Sure. They're all on my trail. Will you do me a favor, Miss Custer? Why, sure. Go and tell them that everything is all right. Will you, please? Will you go and tell them? Oh, Henry, did I ever refuse to do anything for you? No, you haven't. But this is the one time when I need you more... You know what I'm like, Henry. If I didn't need you... For three long years, I've watched over you like a little baby. When I say... Henry, stop that and listen to me. Don't you know anything at all? Everybody's after you. Sure. Yes! But listen, if Sally isn't here with you, I'll protect you with my life. Yes, yes. But if she is here, heaven help you. You're such a darling, Miss Custer. You're always trying to help me. I love you, Henry. Well, I'll be. Say, what is this? Why, it's nothing. I'm getting a treatment. This is my nurse. Nurse? Well, you'll need a real nurse and a few doctors, too, if I don't get something to eat. Where's them waffles? What waffles? Why, I'll sock you... Hey, just wait a minute. Don't you dare touch him. Why, he's sick. He's delicate. Don't you lay a hand on him. One blow might kill him. Oh, Henry, dear. Go, get somebody, quick. He's fainted. Henry! Get the baggage upstairs. Chester, phone Sheriff Bob Wells to get here at once. Right-o. Oh, it's him! What... Oh, my nerves, my nerves. It's him, all right. You get back up there! Where? Where? Where am I? Mr. Underwood, welcome home to Bar M Ranch! Welcome? This is a fine welcome! Held up, insulted, I haven't had anything to eat. My nerves are all shattered. Get me some breakfast. Yes, sir, there's the cook, right there, sir. Would you care to have some nice waffles? No, no, no. I'm a very nervous man, and I need plenty of nourishment. Get me some buckwheat cakes, fried chicken, fried potatoes, beans, corn, pudding, salad, and a nice cup of coffee. What? No cereal? Say, where have I seen you before? Why, in some hospital. You've been in a hospital? All of them. What's the matter with you? Oh, nothing. Just let me take a nap. I'm all right. I feel good, now. I feel good. But I do have trouble with my stomach. Every night for 19 years, I've had to take bicarbonate of soda. That's nothing. I've had stomach trouble all my life. No? Look at the coat on my tongue. Yeah, look at the pants on mine. Say, I've had pneumonia four times. Ha! I'm even with you. I've had double pneumonia twice. Sit down. Pull up a chair. My boy, did you ever have the hives? The hives? I've had the itch and a broken arm at the same time. For a sinus operation, I was under ether one hour and 45 minutes! An hour and 45 minutes? Yes. And you think you were under ether? Yes. Mister, they gave you vanilla. I'm going to tell you something. I had an operation of water on the knee. Look at this bump I got from an operation of water on the knee. See this bump here? From an operation of water on the knee? Yes, sir, they ran out of ether. See the bump here? See it? Are you going to have any more operations? What do you think the doctor said? What? Doctor said if I have one more operation, he's gonna put in a zipper. A zipper, like that. I got a scar, six inches long, from appendicitis operation. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm gonna show you a scar. You think you've got a scar? I'm gonna show you something, my dear man, that will amaze you. Here is really a scar from an operation. You see that? Now, look down here, see that? All the way down to the leg? You see it? Let me take a look at yours. Listen, I'm ready to prove to you. Here, does this show? Wait a minute, see that? Now, wait a minute, I wanna show you. See this? 51, is that good? Yes, but, my boy, look at this one. Come down here. Just let me show you an operation. You see that, can you see how far down that operation goes? Now, can you see it? Say, now, let me see. Let me see your operation. For goodness... Oh, for heaven's... I don't even think you had an operation! Can you see it now? See what I mean? There you are. Yes, sir, my boy, that is some operation. I'll say so. Tell me, what did your operation cost? That's nothing. Mine cost $2,400. How much? Do you mind if I take one more little peek at it, like... Oh, well, no wonder! You've got hemstitching. Sally, the sheriff and his men are coming. I cut through the hills to beat them here. They're going to hang Henry Williams. No! Now, if you love him, go, and go quickly. But I don't love him. Why did you elope with him? Because I couldn't marry Bob Wells. I don't love him. If you don't love Henry Williams, if you don't love Bob Wells, who do you love? Last night, when we were together, I knew I could never marry anyone else. Sally. Take me away with you into the mountains. I'll live the way of your people. I can't do that, Sally. You'd be an outcast! Oh, I don't care what they'd say. But don't you realize that if I let you make this sacrifice for me, I wouldn't be worthy of your love. It can't be, Sally. This is the end. Wanenis. The Epsom did it.  I'm making waffles  Hey, Mr. Underwood, the sheriff is coming. Sheriff Bob Wells is here! Who did you say? Sheriff Bob Wells. Bob Wells! Oh, for... Listen, fellas, we pack them here. You know the fella I'm after. Look over the ranch. Watch the roads. And don't let a white man get by you. You get me? Don't let a white man get by you. Sally Morgan? How dare you speak to me? What the... Don't you know me? Henry? Henry Williams? Well, of course... Well, who am I, Amos 'n Andy? Why, your disguise is perfect. How did you ever think of it? You mean the black? Yes. I didn't. I got in the stove, and somebody else thought of it. Sally Morgan? You've been crying. Now, what's the trouble? I wish I were dead. Don't say that. I wish I'd never been born. You could have said that first and saved yourself a wish. You know that, don't you? Henry, if you loved a person, and they were of Indian blood... I can't stand the sight of any blood. We've no time to fool around. The sheriff is here. And he's come to hang you. Well, let's not hang around here. Here. Who are you? The waitress. Who are you? The cook. Where's my breakfast? Your breakfast, ha! I didn't eat myself yet. His breakfast... Come on, Sally. Andy, what kind of a cook have you got? Oh, Dad, I found the bandit's flivver... What are you doing here? Whose flivver is this? I don't... No! What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? No! Just as a precaution, I think I'd better have the sheriff arrest you, don't you? Yes! Sally, get into the flivver. I'll be with you in a minute, and don't move until I get back! There must have been a dozen bandits, and every one looked like a killer to me! Don't worry, Mr. Underwood, Sheriff Bob Wells always gets his man! Hey, you. Come here! Where you from? We moved. Yeah? What's your name? Rudy Vallee. Who is this fella? He works for me. He's a cook. Yes, sir, but I is a singing cook. Yeah. Well, I got an idea maybe you ain't no cook at all. Maybe you don't sing, either. Go on, let's hear you. Now!  I'm so happy since the day That I fell in love in a great big way And a big surprise is someone loves me too  Guess it's hard for you to see Just what anyone could see in me But it only goes to prove what love can do  My baby don't care for shows  My baby don't care for clothes  My baby just cares for me My baby don't care for cars and races My baby don't care for high-toned places My baby don't care for rings or other expensive things  She's sensible as can be My baby don't care who knows it  My baby just cares for me  My baby's no Gilbert fan  Ronald Colman is not her man  My baby just cares for me My baby don't care for Lawrence Tibbetts She'd rather have me around to kibitz  Bud Rogers is not her style  And even Chevalier's smile Is something that she can't see I wonder what's wrong with baby My baby just cares for me, me, only me  Say, that was pretty good. Sing us another chorus of that. Yeah, sing us another. You really want me to? Yeah.  My baby don't care for shows  My baby don't care for clothes  My baby just cares for me  Help! Help!

My baby don't care for shows  My baby don't care for clothes  My baby just cares for me  Help! Help! Help! Hold that man. He slugged me. The bandit's flivver's in the garage. They must be on this ranch. Was there anyone missing on this place last night? Only Mort and Andy. They went into town. Take them into the kitchen, and I'll question them. Well! And you, too. I know, but listen, Sheriff... Get in there. I didn't do anything. Don't tell me that. I know different. Yeah, what about it? Search those guys. I'm ticklish! Let me do it to you, Sheriff! Why, I'll smash you one... Line up some chairs here. I want to question them. And sit down. Now listen, you guys, all of you... Pardon me, if you'll allow me, I will quickly discover which of these three men is the guilty one. How? By applying psychology, if you'll have them do exactly as I tell them. They'll do as they're told. This is a little psychological experiment. I studied the method in my college laboratory. Hold these, please. I'm going to read your most secret thoughts by what is known as the association of ideas. If you can read my thoughts, you oughta kick me in the face right away. Quiet. Well, I propose to know not what you want to tell me, but what you're trying to keep from me. Pardon me. Did you ever tiptoe through the tulips? Oh, Esther. Sit down. Good boy, Chester. I'm proud of you. Thank you, Father. Look, he just met his father for the first time. Have you seen your mother yet? I haven't any proper mechanical apparatus, but I can use a substitute. Use your old man. What? Allow me. You will all hold your clenched fists directly out in front of you, so. Upon these fists, the sheriff will place one of these china plates, thus. Then, I'm going to ask you a few questions. Then, you're going to hear the cutest answers you ever heard. Quiet. When I speak the word associated in your mind with your guilt, you will drop the plates. You must. Pardon me. Have you seen my operation? Sit down and hold out your fists, all of you! Oh, we're gonna have waffles. Oh, shut up. The muscular reaction of the normal person acts independent of the subject's will. Says which? I said, the muscular reaction of the normal person acts independent of the subject's will. Except February, which has 28. Shut up! Now, listen. Which one of you men has ever been called a scholar? A poet? A philosopher? Which one of you men has ever been called a thief? Oh, the sheriff is a thief. Why, what's the meaning of this? Go on, pull up a chair for the sheriff. Quiet! I'm not on trial here. We'll resume. Dog, cat, cow, wolf, lion, leopard... He's a salesman for animal crackers. Shut up. Automobile, Ford car, Illinois state license, garage... That one's guilty. Take him away! Lock him up! Good boy, Chester. Isn't he wonderful? Go on, Chester! May not even be his boy! Doctor, parson, sailor, thief... Pardon me, are you wearing a girdle? Quiet. Love is sweet. The air is soft. The wind blows. The waves... Sit down there, or I'll bust you in the nose. Who do you think you're kidding? Don't you know I'm the sheriff of this outfit? Look down. Look down, below is sin. Above is virtue, look up. Look up. Let the thief be known. Let him be known. Hold him, too. Only one left. Well, I guess I won the spelling bee! Sit down! Do you dare answer the questions I ask you? Yes, you smothered lamb chop. Now, I'll speak one word. You answer at once with just one word suggested by the word I speak. Ready? Shoot! Sun! Hot! Rain! Wet! Crime! Jail! Sheriff! Boob! What? Sit down. It came out of me. I can't help myself. Sit down! Dad, this man is innocent. If he was guilty, he could never hold those plates under my questioning. I thought you were gonna find out who committed this holdup. My boy, you made a mistake. Henry Williams, I know you. Oh, but please don't give me away, Miss Custer. How did you ever keep those plates from falling? I knew what he was going to do, so I put glue on my fists. That's all. There you are. Tell that to me. Henry Williams knows something about this, more than he's telling you. They're gonna find out about him pretty soon. Say, boys, if you find Henry, promise you won't hurt him, or I won't invite you to our wedding. We didn't know you were gonna marry Henry. He doesn't know it. But, gee, Miss Custer, we ain't got clothes for no wedding. Say, you can be high-hat in a Stetson! Why, I had an uncle by the name of Jerry  And he was a cowboy, too  He was a cowboy, too Set the styles for miles and miles Ask my uncle by the name of Jerry What the well-dressed man should wear And in conjunction with the social function You could hear my uncle declare  Come on along and wear your Stetson Can't go wrong with a Stetson You're in wrong without a Stetson  High-hat, my hat  You intend to be some dresser I'm your friend, and I mean yes, sir You should be the proud possessor  Of a sky-high Stetson hat  Now I feel all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I feel good. I feel good. I'm all right. Don't worry. I'll handle this, and I'll handle it right. Did you find Henry Williams? No, there's not a trace of him here. Hello, Sheriff. Henry Williams! Henry Williams! Henry Williams! I'll kill him! No. I'll kill him. After what he did to me, I'll kill him. Well, make up your mind. Who's gonna do it? Why, you... Say, listen here, you... A fine bunch of cowards you guys are, running away from a pill-chewing tenderfoot. Come on! Sheriff, don't. Come out of there, you pop-eyed, anemic, dying frog.

We're gonna have something to eat, huh? Well, that's fine. Say, I'm satisfied. Henry, what are you doing here? Wanenis, I'd never know you without your shirt on. He's cute, isn't he? Heap much. And what's the idea of the summer shutters? What a funny place for fishing tackle. Wanenis, listen. You were the only one we could come to for protection. The sheriff wants to hang me because I helped Sally run away from him. Yes, but why did you run away with her? Don't you know that I love Sally? Sure, you love Sally. I know you love Sally. You know he love Sally. You boys know he love... You want to give me a rubdown now? Henry, where is she? I left her in the flivver down on the trail. On the trail? Yes. I must go to her.

My one drop of Indian blood makes your people hate me. I don't hate you. I love you. I love you too, Sally. More than my life. But we can never marry.  When the winter's over  When the summer's through  When there's prairie clover  I'll still belong to you  Far above the plain  When the moon is new  When it's on the wane  I'll still belong to you Winds may blow as though they know what I've told you  Yet the more they blow  The closer I'll hold you  Though the world may take me  From a world for two  Though you may forsake me  I'll still belong  To you  Dad, that was the bandit's flivver we saw on the trail.

No, will you... Now, look, will you wait a while? Will you wait a while? Stop this nonsense. I want to be serious. Miss Custer, you know there comes a time in every man's life when he feels the need of a companion. Someone to whom he can give his affection, someone who'll understand him, love him, comfort him. Miss Custer, Mary, I'd like to ask you one question. Yes, Henry, dear? Whatever became of that calf? Now, will you wait a while? Will you listen? Will you wait a while? You know how I feel about you.  My baby don't care for shows  My baby don't care for clothes  My baby just cares for me My baby just loves those consultations And how she enjoys my operation  After our honeymoon  In April, May or June  I'll get my nursing free Then I can feel good for nothing  My baby just cares for me  That's all there is.

Sit down, Roy. Sit on the floor and hang your legs over. - Take your hands off her. - Oh, I can't take my hands off. {y:i}You heard what I said. Take your hands off her. {y:i}Who asked you to this party anyway? Helen, let me take you home. Home? Who wants to go home? I'm having a marvelous time. I was until you came in. I advise you to get out before you're kicked out. Keep your... Keep your filthy hands off of my girl. Your girl. You fool. I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth. You're nothing to me. Nothing. Come on, Roy. Let's get out of here. Come on. Oh, let's have it out. I don't love you. I never have. I never had any fun with you anyway. You and your high ideals. You're too good to live. You're just a stupid prig if you ask me. You make me sick, do you hear? Sick. Now, get out here. I hate the sight of you! Come on, Roy. Let's go across the street. Sweet, sweet baby. Handsome, big, strong baby. {y:i}N'est-ce pas? {y:i}Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh? Oh, baby. Hello, chri. Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy. Forget it. Is your friend sick? No. He'll be all right. Drink up, Roy. I still can't believe it. You just don't know anything about women. They're all the same. I've been telling you that for years. Maybe you'll believe me now. - Oh, Helen's not that sort. - Oh, nonsense. - It's the war. She's changed. - You're wrong, Roy. War doesn't change people. It's... It's like getting drunk. It brings out what people really are. You can't make me believe Helen was like that before. Well, she was. I've known it all along. You too? Oh, I'm sorry, Roy. Don't take it so hard. She isn't worth it. - I suppose you're right. - Of course I'm right. Listen, Roy, never love a woman. Just make love to her. {y:i}You see, like this. Look. Go ahead, Roy. Try it. That's the way. Oh! What you do, baby? All wet! No, no, no, no! {y:i}Imbecile! Aw, baby. Voil. Hey, listen, Monte. Monte. Go easy. We gotta go up at 3:00. Oh, listen, Roy. To hell with this 3:00 business. {y:i}What do you mean? Just that. To hell with it. Say, you're crazy, Monte. We can't get out of it now. Oh, why can't we? Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere. You tried it on Helen and what happened? You got a kick in the face. You can't go through life thinking the way you do. People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did. - It's beginning to look as though you're right. - Of course I'm right. I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too. This is another thing entirely, Monte. Why is it? They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all. It's chaps like you that are meat for them. All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it. Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go? - But we can't get out of it now. - Why can't we? Listen, tell 'em... tell 'em the motorcycle broke down. Tell 'em anything. What do you say, Roy? Well... Come on, old ooo-la-la. Oh, no, no, no, chri. Oh, baby. {y:i}N'est-ce pas? Oh, oui, oui, madam. Oh, baby. Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy. You're not going anywhere. Yes, I am and so are you. Who says I am? Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly. There's no way out of this and we know it. Come on, Monte. No, no. Let me alone. Come on, old ooo-la-la. Monte. Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up. Why, that's desertion, Monte. They shoot people for that. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on. I suppose you're right. Oh, no, no, no, no. Monte. What a pair of fools we are. Let's go. Easy, now. Easy. Look out for the firing pin. Righto. I got it. {y:i}Contactor. Contact. Ground speed here. Keep this site trained on the target. Then pull the release when you hit the stop. Do you understand? Don't forget the leveler. Good-bye. Good-bye. {y:i}Contactor. Contact. Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds. Good luck. Thank you. Roy, the depot. Roy, look there! They've seen us. They're coming on. For Christ's sake. Hey, Roy, look. They hit our right motor. I got him! Roy! Look over there. It's our squadrons. They're coming! Roy, they've gone. Jesus. Son of a Boche. Hey! It's me! Hey! It's me! Goddamn it! It's old Baldy. Hey! Baldy. Hello. It's Baldy. Look, Roy. It's Baldy. You see that guy? Good old Baldy. Good boy. See that? He's got him. Hey, look. He's got him. He's got him. Oh. Look. They've changed around. Our strut's gone. That son of a bitch. Roy, he got us! Roy! Go down! Go down! Go down! One more for Baldy! No more control? Pull her up! Oh, my God! We're on fire! We're burning! Roy, get down! Do something! Roy! Ah, so. We meet again. {y:i}It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr? Yes. {y:i}And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr? - Yes. - Very clever. It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me. There are a few questions I must ask you. If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you. To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached? Just why were you sent to bomb that munition depot this morning? It was our natural target. But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh? You are surprised. We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk. Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made? Oh, you are stupid not to tell. It is nothing. {y:i}For you the war is over, nicht wahr? We are friends. Hmm. Listen, if you tell me, I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war. It's near Munich. Far away from all this. You will have every comfort. {y:i}And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say. So, you see? It can be easy for you. Now, please. So, you will not tell? Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform. {y:i}Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr? {y:i}And you know what happens to spies? I think you two friends had better talk it over. I will give you 15 minutes. If you change your mind and tell, good. If not, you will be shot. Do you think he was bluffing? No, he wasn't bluffing. He's the man I was to fight that duel with. Really? Quite a coincidence. He's got it in for me. Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time. The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte. Yes. Roy, look. Oh, save it to wipe your nose on. God, what nerve. Roy. Roy, I can't face it. I'm going to tell. Don't be a fool, Monte. Do you realize what it would mean if we told? It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over. But, Monte, you can't. To hell with your heroic stuff. I wanna live. I'm not gonna be shot down like that. I'm going to tell. Wait a minute. Monte. But I... Listen. Let me go. You? Yes. You're all upset. I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything. I- I'll come with you. No. You said he's got it in for you. Now, let me do it alone. All right. Tell the general I'm ready to talk. Good. Come. Ah, yes. So, you have changed your mind? Yes. My friend will never tell, but I wanna live. I'm ready to talk. You are very wise. Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men. Wait a minute. I'll tell only on one condition. Ah, so, a condition. Yes. If I give this information, my friend will know it. Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor. You leave that to me. Why not let me have that satisfaction? What do you mean? I do not understand. One does not kill a friend. Friend. He's not my friend. He stole the girl I love and I hate him. Huh. History repeats itself. You make rather hard terms. I'll tell only on that condition. One bullet. What if I miss? Give me two to make sure. No. A good soldier will need only one. Very well. Not so fast. He will give you the bullet outside. Well? I didn't tell, Monte. Why? What happened? Has he changed his mind? No. Don't you think you can go through with it now? What do you mean? Of course we can. It won't even hurt. It'll all be over in a second. We can stand anything for a second. No, no, Roy. L-I can't do it. I'm going to tell. Listen, Monte. We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out. Three thousand men, and they all want to live too. You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you? That's not my business. I didn't start this war. I didn't get them into this mess. Let 'em take care of themselves. They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway. I wanna live. Live! You won't tell, I'll tell. {y:i}Listen, Monte! I'll tell! I'll tell! {y:i}Let me out! I'll tell everything I know. The brigade is moving up. They're going to attack... Oh. Roy. Oh, Monte. Monte. Monte. Monte. Don't cry, Roy. It was the only thing you could do. The brigade, Roy. Yes, Monte? They'll be all right now, won't they? Yes. Who's that? It's the general. You... You thought we'd tell, didn't you? Good old Roy. You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all. Oh, Roy. Roy. Yes? Where are you? Don't go away, Roy. I'm here, Monte. Can't you feel me holding you? Hello, Karl. Fig eights. Cold up here in the night patrol. Awful to be in the dark. Oh. I'm afraid. Look out. Look out! We're falling! We're going to crash! Do something, Roy! Quick! Quick! Quick! It's all right, Monte. Monte? It's all right. Monte? Monte. Oh. Well? You heard what my brother said. Your brother? I'll never tell you anything. {y:i}Achtung! {y:i}I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte. Come on, you Seventh Brigade. We got 'em now. >> Napisy pobrane z http://napisy.org << >>>>>>>> nowa wizja napisw <<<<<<<< Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, What do we care if we were expelled? The war's gonna start, so we would've left anyhow. War! Isn't it exciting, Scarlett? - Those fool Yankees want a war. We'll show them! Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war! This war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party. I get so bored I could scream. Besides, there isn't going to be any war. Not gonna be any war? - Of course there'll be a war. If either of you boys says ""war"" once again... ...I'll go in the house. - But, Scarlett! - Don't you want us to have a war? Wait a minute, honey, please! We're sorry. Well... But remember, I warned you. I've got an idea! We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue at Twelve Oaks. You're eating barbecue with us, aren't you? I haven't thought about that yet. I'll think about that tomorrow. We want all your waltzes. First Brent, then me, then Brent, and so on. - Promise? - Why, I'd just love to. If only I didn't have every one of them taken already. - You can't do that to us! - We'll tell you a secret. A secret? Who by? You know Melanie Hamilton? Ashley Wilkes' cousin? She's visiting... That goody-goody! Who wants to know about her? Anyway, we heard... They say... Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her. - Wilkeses always marry their cousins. Do we get those waltzes? Of course. - It can't be true! Ashley loves me! Scarlett! - What's gotten into her? - Suppose we made her mad? Where are you going without your shawl and the night air coming? How come you didn't ask them gentlemen to supper? You got no more manners than a field hand. After me and Miss Ellen done labored with you! Come on in before you catch your death of dampness. No! I'm going to wait for Pa to come home. Come on in here! Come on! Mm-mm-mm! Quitting time! - Who says it's quitting time? - I said. I's the foreman. I say when it's quitting time at Tara. Quitting time! There's none in the county can touch you, and none in the state. Pa! How proud of yourself you are! Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, so you've been spying on me. Like your sister, you'll tell your mother that I was jumping again. You know I'm no tattletale like Suellen. But after you broke your knee last year jumping that fence... I'll not have me own daughter telling me what I shall jump and not jump. It's my own neck, so it is. All right, Pa, you jump what you please. - How are they at Twelve Oaks? - The Wilkeses? In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue and talking nothing but war. Bother the war! Was there anyone else there? Their cousin Melanie and her brother, Charles. Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny! Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so. Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her. What's your interest in Ashley and Miss Melanie? Nothing. Let's go into the house. Has he been trifling with you? Has he asked you to marry him? - No. - Nor will he. I had it in strict confidence from John Wilkes today... ...Ashley's going to marry Melanie. It'll be announced tomorrow night at the ball. I don't believe it! Here! Where are you off to? Scarlett! What are you about? Have you been running after a man who's not in love with you? When you might have any other? I haven't been running after him, it's just a surprise. Now, don't be jerking your chin at me! If Ashley wanted to marry you, I'd have misgivings. I want my girl to be happy. You'd not be happy with him. I would! I would! What's the difference who you marry? So long as he's a Southerner. And when I'm gone I'll leave Tara to you. I don't want it. It doesn't mean anything... Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara... ...that land doesn't mean anything to you? Land is the only thing in the world worth working for... ...worth fighting for, worth dying for. - It's the only thing that lasts! - You talk like an Irishman. It's proud I am that I'm Irish. Don't you be forgetting... ...that you're half Irish too. To anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them... ...the land they live on is like their mother. But there now. You're just a child. It'll come to you, this love of the land. There's no getting away from it if you're Irish. Here she comes! Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen, your mama's home! Acting like a wet nurse to them white-trash Slatterys... ...instead of eating her supper. Set up the fire! Got no business wearing herself out... Pork! Take the lamp out on the porch. Wearing herself out. Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home! Waiting on them poor white trash. Shut up, dog! Barking in the house! Get up from there! Don't you hear Miss Ellen? Get out there and get her medicine chest! We was worried about you, Miss Ellen. It's all right, Pork. I'm home. Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing the creek bottom today. What do you want me to start on tomorrow? Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come from Emmie Slattery's bedside. Your child has been born. My child, ma'am? I'm sure I don't understand. Has been born and mercifully has died. Good night, Mr. Wilkerson. I fix your supper myself and you eats it. - Yes, after prayers, Mammy. - Yes'm. Mr. O'Hara, you must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson. Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara? He's the best overseer in the county. He must go tomorrow morning, the first thing! - No. - Yes. The Yankee Wilkerson and the white-trash Slattery girl? - We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara. - Yes, Mrs. O'Hara. Scarlett's dress is prettier than mine! Can't she wear my pink dress? I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress. I don't like your tone, Suellen. Your pink gown's lovely. Can't I stay up for the ball? - You may wear my garnets. Why can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow? Scarlett. You look tired, my dear. I'm worried about you. I'm all right, Mother. Why can't I stay up for the ball? I'm 13 now. You may go to the barbecue. I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow! - Hush up! Prayers, girls. - And to all the saints, that I have sinned in thought, word and deed... ...through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore, I beseech thee, blessed Mary, ever virgin... ...blessed Michael the Archangel... ...blessed John the Baptist... ...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and all the saints... ...pray to the Lord... Ashley doesn't know I love him. I'll tell him that I love him... ...and then he can't marry. Hear thee Almighty, most merciful Lord... ...grant us pardon, absolution and remission of our sins. Amen. Ooh! Just hold on and suck in! Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles. Take it back to the kitchen. I won't eat a bite. Yes'm, you is! You's gonna eat every mouthful. No, I'm not! Put on the dress. We're late already. - What my lamb gonna wear? - That. No, you ain't! You can't show your bosom before 3:00! I'm gonna speak to your ma! If you say one word to mother, I won't eat a bite. Well... Keep your shawl on. I ain't aiming for you to get freckled... ...after the buttermilk I done put on you, bleaching them freckles. Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on and be good and eat just a little, honey. No! I'm going to have a good time today and eat at the barbecue. If you don't care what folks says, I does! You can always tell a lady by how she eats in front of folks like a bird. I ain't aiming for you to go to John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog! Fiddle-dee-dee! Ashley told me he likes girls with a healthy appetite. What gentlemens says and thinks is different things. And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley asking for to marry you. Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need a having it come right back up again. Why is it a girl has to be so silly to catch a husband? Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not down here by the time I count 10... ...we'll go without you! - I'm coming, Pa! One, two, three, four, five... Oh, dear! My stays are so tight, I'll never get through the day without belching! Well, John Wilkes. - It's a grand day for the barbecue. - So it seems, Gerald. Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you? She's settling accounts with the overseer, but she'll be along tonight. - Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara. - Thank you kindly, India. Your daughter's getting prettier every day, John. Here are the O'Hara girls. We must greet them. I can't stand Scarlett. She throws herself at Ashley. That's your brother's business. You must remember your duties as hostess. Good morning, girls. You're looking lovely. Good morning, Scarlett. India Wilkes, what a lovely dress! I just can't take my eyes off it. Good morning, Miss Scarlett. You look mighty fine this morning, Miss Scarlett. It's a pleasure to see you, Miss Scarlett. Ashley! Scarlett, my dear! I've been looking for you everywhere. I've got something I must tell you. Can't we go someplace quiet? Yes, I'd like to, but I have something to tell you too. Something I hope you'll be glad to hear. Come say hello to my cousin Melanie first. Oh, do we have to? She's been looking forward to seeing you again. Melanie! Here's Scarlett. - Scarlett! I'm so glad to see you again. Melanie, what a surprise to run into you here. I hope you'll stay with us a few days. I hope I shall stay long enough for us to become real friends. - I do want us to be. - We'll keep her here, won't we? We'll make the biggest fuss over her! If anybody can give a girl a good time, it's Ashley. Our good times must seem silly to you. You're so serious. Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life. I've always admired you. I wish I could be more like you. You mustn't flatter me and say things you don't mean. Nobody could accuse Melanie of being insincere. Could they, my dear? She's not like you, is she, Ashley? He never means a word he says to any girl. Why, Charles Hamilton, you handsome old thing, you! But, Miss O'Hara, I... Was it kind to bring your good-looking brother here to break my poor heart? Now that Charles is your beau, she's after him like a hornet. Charles, I want to eat barbecue with you. Don't go philandering with any other girl, because I'm mighty jealous. I won't, Miss O'Hara. I couldn't! I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look dashing with those new whiskers. Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett. Charles and Wade asked me to eat with them, but I told them I promised you. You needn't be so amused. She's after your beau now. That's mighty flattering of you, Miss Scarlett. I'll see what I can do. Why's your sister mad? You sparking her beau? As if I couldn't do better than that old maid in britches. Brent and Stuart, you handsome old things! - I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you! - What have we done? You haven't been near me all day! I wore this old dress for you. I was counting on eating with you. - You are, Scarlett. - Of course you are, honey. I never can make up my mind which of you is the handsomest. I was awake all last night trying to figure it out. Oh, shucks! - Cathleen, who's that? - Who? That man looking at us and smiling. The nasty dark one. Don't you know? That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston. He has a most terrible reputation. He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy. My dear, he isn't received. He spends his time up North because his folks won't speak to him. He was expelled from West Point, he's so fast. And there's that business about the girl he wouldn't marry. Tell, tell! He took her out buggy-riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon... ...and then he refused to marry her! No, but she was ruined just the same. Ashley... - Happy? - So happy. You seem to belong here... ...as if it had all been imagined for you. I like to feel that I belong to the things you love. - You love Twelve Oaks as I do. - Yes, Ashley. I love it as more than a house. It's a whole world that wants only to be graceful and beautiful. It's so unaware that it may not last forever. You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes? But we don't have to be afraid for us. No war can come into our world, Ashley. Whatever comes, I'll love you... ...just as I do now, until I die. Isn't this better than a table? A girl hasn't got but two sides to her at a table. - I'll get her dessert. - She said me! Allow me, Miss O'Hara? I think... I think Charles Hamilton may get it. Thank you, Miss O'Hara. Thank you! Go get it, boy! Isn't he the luckiest... Miss O'Hara... ...I love you. I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought. Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired. Well-brought-up ladies takes naps at parties. It's time you behave and act like you was Miss Ellen's daughter. When we were in Saratoga, I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps. And you won't see no Yankee girls at the ball, neither. How was Ashley today? He didn't pay much attention to you. You mind your own business! You'll be lucky you don't lose whisker-face Kennedy. You're sweet on Ashley, and his engagement's being announced tonight. That's as much as you know. You ought to behave yourself! Acting like poor white-trash children! If you's old enough for parties, you should act like ladies! Who cares? We've borne enough insults from the Yankees. We'll keep our slaves with or without their approval. 'Twas the sovereign right of Georgia to secede from the Union. The South must assert herself by force of arms. After we've fired on the Yankee rascals at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight. - There's no other way. That's right! Let the Yankees ask for peace. The situation's very simple. The Yankees can't fight and we can. There won't be a battle. They'll turn and run. One of us can lick 20 Yanks. We'll beat them in one battle. Gentlemen can always fight better than rabble. Gentlemen always fight better. What does the captain of our Troop say? Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights, I go with her. I hope the Yankees let us leave the Union in peace. Ashley, they've insulted us! You can't mean you don't want war? Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars. And when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about. Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's been up North, I hear. Don't you agree with us? I think it's hard winning a war with words. What do you mean, sir? There's not a cannon factory in the whole South. What difference does that make to a gentleman? It'll make a great difference to a great many gentlemen, sir. Are you hinting that the Yankees can lick us? No, I'm not hinting. I'm saying plainly, the Yankees are better equipped than we. They've got factories, shipyards, coal mines... ...and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us. All we've got is cotton and slaves, and arrogance. I refuse to listen to any renegade talk! - I'm sorry if the truth offends you. - Apologies aren't enough, sir. I hear you were turned out of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler. And you aren't received in any family in Charleston. Not even your own! I apologize again for all my shortcomings. Perhaps you won't mind if I look over your place? I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars... ...and dreams of victory. That's what you can expect from somebody like Rhett Butler. You did everything but call him out. - He refused to fight. - Not quite there, Charles. - He refused to take advantage of you. - Take advantage of me? He's one of the best shots in the country, as he's proved many times. - He's got steadier hands than yours. - Well, I'll show him! Please. Don't go tweaking his nose anymore. You may be needed for more important fighting. If you'll excuse me, Mr. Butler's our guest. I think I'll just show him around. Ashley! Ashley... Scarlett. Who are you hiding from in here? What are you up to? Why aren't you upstairs, resting with the other girls? What is this, Scarlett, a secret? Oh, Ashley... Ashley! - I love you. - Scarlett! I love you, I do! Isn't it enough that you gathered every other man's heart today? You've always had mine. You cut your teeth on it. Don't tease me now. Have I your heart, my darling? I love you, I love you! You mustn't say such things. You'll hate me for hearing them. I could never hate you, and I know you must care about me. You do care, don't you? Yes, I care. Can't we go away and forget we ever said these things? But how can we do that? Don't you...? Don't you want to marry me? I'm going to marry Melanie. But you can't! Not if you care for me! Oh, my dear, why must you make me say things that will hurt you? How can I make you understand? You're so young, you don't know what marriage means. I know I love you, and I want to be your wife. You don't love Melanie. She's like me, Scarlett. She's my blood and we understand each other. But you love me! How could I help loving you? You have all the passion for life that I lack. That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are. Why not say it, you coward? You're afraid to marry me. You'd marry that fool who can only say... ...""yes,"" ""no"" and raise a passel of mealy-mouthed brats! You mustn't say that! Who are you to tell me I mustn't? You led me on! - You made me believe you'd marry me. - Scarlett, be fair! - I never at any time... - You did! It's true, you did! I'll hate you till I die! I can't think of anything bad enough to call you! Has the war started? Sir, you should have made your presence known. In the middle of that beautiful love scene? That wouldn't have been tactful, would it? But don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. - Sir, you are no gentleman. - And you, miss, are no lady. I don't hold that against you. Ladies never held any charm for me. First you take advantage of me, then you insult me! I meant it as a compliment. I hope to see more of you, when you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes. He doesn't strike me as good enough for a girl of your... What was it? Your ""passion for living. "" How dare you! You aren't fit to wipe his boots! And you were going to hate him for the rest of your life. She certainly made a fool of herself running after all the men. That's not fair, India. She's so attractive, men naturally flock to her. Melanie, you're just too good to be true. - Didn't you see her going after Charles? - And she knows Charles belongs to me. You're wrong, India. Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious. Men flirt with girls like that, but they don't marry them. I think you're being very mean to her. Miss O'Hara! Mr. Lincoln's called volunteers to fight against us! Don't you men think about anything important? But it's war! Everybody's going off to enlist. I'm going too! Everybody? Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry? To see us go? I'll cry into my pillow every night. Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you. You're the most beautiful girl in the world, and the sweetest, the dearest. I couldn't hope that you could love me. I'm so clumsy and stupid and not nearly good enough for you. But if you could think of marrying me, I'd do anything in the world for you. Just anything, I promise. What did you say? Miss O'Hara, I said, ""Would you marry me?"" Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will. You will? You'll marry me? You'll wait for me? - I don't think I'd want to wait. - You'll marry me before I go? Oh, Miss O'Hara! Scarlett. - When may I speak to your father? - The sooner the better. I'll go now, I can't wait. Will you excuse me, dear? Dear! Mr. O'Hara! Mr. O'Hara! - It'll be a week before they call me. - A week till they take you away from me! Oh, Ashley. I thought of you at our wedding yesterday... ...and I hoped yours would be as beautiful. - And it was! - Was it? Now we're really and truly sisters. - Charles! - Melanie. Don't cry, darling. The war will be over in a few weeks, and I'll be coming back to you. Miss Scarlett! I don't care! I'm too young to be a widow. Miss Scarlett! Why, I'd just go around scaring people in that thing. You shouldn't be around people. You's in mourning! For what? I don't feel anything. Why should I have to pretend and pretend? What is it? Oh, poor baby! What is it? My life is over! - Nothing will ever happen to me anymore! - Darling... Oh, Mother, I know you think I'm horrible. But I just can't bear going around in black. It's bad enough not being able to go to parties. But looking this way too? I don't think you're at all horrible. It's only natural you want to look young and be young when you are young. Oh, baby! How would you like to visit somewhere? Savannah, perhaps? What would I do in Savannah? Well, Atlanta then. There's lots going on there. And you can stay with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat. Melanie? Yes. Yes, I could, couldn't I? Oh, Mother, you're sweeter than anybody in the world! You'd like it, really? All right, then. Now stop your crying and smile. You can take Prissy with you. Start packing Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy. I'll go write the necessary letters. Atlanta! Savannah would be better for you. You'll get in trouble in Atlanta. What are you talking about? You know what I's talking about. I'm talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes. He'll come to Atlanta for his leave and you waiting for him just like a spider! - He belongs to Miss Melanie... - Go pack my things like Mother said! They're all whispering, and I know it's about her! What's it matter, Pittypat? Scarlett's living under my roof, so they think I'm responsible for her. And for a widow to appear in public at a social gathering... ...every time I think of it, I feel faint. You know Scarlett came here only to help raise money for the Cause. It was splendid of her to make the sacrifice. Anyone hearing you talk would think she came to dance instead of sell things. Ladies and gentlemen, I have important news! Glorious news! Another triumph for our magnificent men in arms! General Lee has completely whipped the enemy... ...and swept the Yankee army northward from Virginia! And now, a happy surprise for all of us. We have with us tonight, that most daring of all blockade runners... ...whose fleet schooners, slipping past the Yankee guns... ...have brought us here the very woolens and laces we wear tonight. I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main. None other than our friend from Charleston... ...Captain Rhett Butler! Permit me. Captain Butler, such a pleasure to see you again. I met you last at my husband's home. That's kind of you to remember, Mrs. Wilkes. Did you meet Captain Butler at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett? Yes, I... I think so. Only for a moment. It was in the library. You had broken something. Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you. Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause. We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning. Wait. On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes and Mrs. Hamilton. Thank you, Captain Butler. Just a moment, please. But it's your wedding ring, ma'am. It may help my husband more off my finger. Thank you. That was a very beautiful thing to do. Here. You can have mine too. For the Cause. And you, Mrs. Hamilton. I know just how much that means to you. Melanie? - Dr. Meade? - I need your approval... ...for something we want to do that's rather shocking. Will you excuse us? I'll say one thing. The war makes the most peculiar widows. I wish you'd go away! If you had any raising, you'd know I'd never want to see you again! Now, why be silly? You've no reason for hating me. I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave. I'd be very unpatriotic to hate a great hero of the war. I declare, I was surprised you turned out to be a noble character. I can't bear to take advantage of your little-girl ideas. I'm neither noble nor heroic. - But you are a blockade runner? - For profit, and profit only. You don't believe in the Cause? Rhett Butler is the only cause I know. The rest doesn't mean much to me. And now, ladies and gentlemen... ...I have a startling surprise for the benefit of the hospital. Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel with the lady of your choice... ...you must bid for her! Caroline Meade, how can you let your husband conduct this slave auction! Darlene Merriwether, how dare you criticize me! Melanie told the doctor that if it's for the Cause, it's quite all right. She did? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Where are my smelling salts? - I think I shall faint. - Don't you dare faint, Pittypat! If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right. Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids? Make your offers! Don't be bashful, gentlemen! Twenty dollars! Twenty dollars for Miss Maybelle Merriwether! Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing! Only $25 to give your... - One hundred and fifty dollars in gold. - For what lady, sir? For Mrs. Charles Hamilton. - For whom, sir? - Mrs. Charles Hamilton. Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning. But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to... Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton. She will not consider it, sir. Oh, yes, I will! My goodness gracious! Ooh! Ooh! Choose your partners for the Virginia reel! We've shocked the Confederacy. It's like blockade running, isn't it? It's worse. I expect a very fancy profit out of it. I don't care what you expect. I'm gonna dance and dance! Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing with Abe Lincoln himself! Another dance and my reputation will be lost forever. With enough courage you can do without a reputation. Oh, you do talk scandalous! You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler. Don't start flirting with me. I'm not one of your plantation beaus. I want more than flirting from you. What do you want? I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take that Southern belle simper off your face. Someday I want you to say to me the words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes. ""I love you. "" That's something you'll never hear from me as long as you live. How sweet. How kind. He is a thoughtful gentleman. Why doesn't he say something about my sacrifice? Oh. Oh! Oh, the darling thing! Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely! You didn't really bring it all the way from Paris just for me. Yes, I thought it was about time I got you out of that fake mourning. Next trip I'll bring you some green silk for a frock to match it. - Oh, Rhett. - It's my duty to our... ...brave boys at the front to keep our girls at home looking pretty. It's so long since I had anything new! How do I look? Awful! Just awful! Why? What's the matter? This war's stopped being a joke when a girl doesn't know the latest fashion. Oh, Rhett! Let me do it. But, Rhett, I don't know how I'd dare wear it! You will, though. And another thing, those pantalets! I don't know a woman in Paris who wears pantalets anymore. What do they...? You shouldn't talk about such things. You don't mind my knowing about them, just my talking about them. I can't go on accepting these gifts, though you're awfully kind. I'm not kind. I'm tempting you. I never give without expecting something in return. I always get paid. I won't marry you to pay for the bonnet. Don't flatter yourself. I'm not a marrying man. Well, I won't kiss you for it either. Open your eyes and look at me. No, I don't think I will kiss you. Although you need kissing, badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed, and often. And by someone who knows how. And I suppose you think you're the proper person! I might be, if the right moment ever came. You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint! I don't know why I let you come and see me. I'll tell you why, Scarlett. I'm the only man over 16 and under 60 who's around to show you a good time. But cheer up. The war can't last much longer. Really, Rhett? Why? There's a battle going on now that ought to fix things... ...one way or the other. - Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it? So you haven't gotten the wooden-headed Mr. Wilkes out of your mind. - Yes, I suppose he's in it. - But tell me, where is it? Some little town in Pennsylvania called Gettysburg. Casualty lists! Casualty lists! Please! Please! Here you is. They was fighting for them so, it got tore in half. Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end. Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman, Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman... Scarlett, you've passed him! He isn't there! He isn't there! Ashley's safe, he isn't listed! Oh, he's safe. He's safe! Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry about Ashley like this for me. I must go to her. Don't, my dear. Not here. Let's go home. Dr. Meade, not...? Yes, our boy Darcy. I was making these mittens for him. He won't need them now. Well, I'm gonna enlist. I'll show them! I'll kill those Yankees! You hush your mouth. You think it'll help your mother to have you shot too? It's silly! It's a black day, Scarlett. Haven't had bad news, have you? - Ashley's safe. - I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake. There are so many others. - Any of your friends? - About every family in the county. - The Tarleton boys, both of them. - Yes. Look at them. All these poor tragic people. The South's sinking to its knees. It'll never rise again. The Cause. The cause of living in the past is dying right in front of us. I never heard you talk like that. I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry and that's what this is, sheer waste! But don't you be downcast. Ashley's still alive to come home to the women who love him. Both of them. You're here! Oh, you're here! You're really here at last! Oh, my dear, I've waited so long! Melanie, my dear, my darling wife! But we're forgetting Scarlett. Scarlett, dear. Why, is this any way to greet a returning warrior? Ashley, I... I... Merry Christmas, Ashley. Come on, old gentleman, come on. We's ate all your wives. We's ate all your little chicks. You got nobody to worry your head about leaving. Come on. Now you just stand still so you... ...can be Christmas for the white folks. Now, hold on! Hold on! Don't go getting so uppity. Even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta. Let's not talk about the war. Let's talk Twelve Oaks and Tara and times before there was a war. Could we have the wine? Why did you say there wasn't enough? There's plenty. It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira. He got it from his uncle Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah... ...who married his cousin Jessica Carroll of Carrolton... ...who was his second cousin and akin to the Wilkeses too. I saved it to wish Ashley a merry Christmas. But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last. I meant it, my dear. It was a lovely Christmas gift. Only generals have tunics like this. I'm so happy you like it. Where did you get the cloth? It was sent by a Charleston lady. I nursed her son while he was in the hospital before he died and... You will take good care of it, won't you? You won't let it get torn. Promise me. You mustn't worry. I'll bring it back to you without any holes in it. I promise. Good night, my dear. - Good night, Scarlett, darling. Uncle Peter, is it time for Mr. Ashley to leave? Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett. Melanie isn't going to the depot? She hasn't changed her mind? No, ma'am, she's laying down. She's so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her she can't even come downstairs. Ashley... Ashley, let me go to the depot with you. Scarlett, I'd rather remember you as you are now. Not shivering at the depot. All right. Ashley, I've got a present for you too! Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful! Tie it on me, my dear. While Melly was making a new tunic, I made this to go with it. You made it yourself? Well, then I shall value it all the more. You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. There's something you can do for me. What is it? Will you look after Melanie for me? She's so frail and gentle, and she loves you so much. - If I were killed... - You mustn't say that! It's bad luck. Say a prayer, quickly. You say one for me. We shall need all our prayers. Now the end is coming. - The end? - The end of the war... ...and the end of our world, Scarlett. But you don't think the Yankees are beating us? Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now! And the snow in Virginia's deep. When I see them, and I see the Yankees coming and coming... ...always more and more! When the end does come, I shall be far away. It'll be a comfort to me to know that she has you. You will promise, won't you? Yes. Is that all, Ashley? All except... goodbye. Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go! - You must be brave. You must! - No, no! How else can I bear going? Oh, Scarlett! You're so fine and strong and beautiful. Not just your sweet face, my dear... ...but you. Ashley, kiss me. Kiss me goodbye. Ashley. No, Scarlett. No! - Oh, Ashley, I love you. I've always loved you. I've never loved anyone else. I only married Charles just to hurt you. Ashley, tell me you love me. I'll live on it the rest of my life! Goodbye. When the war's over, Ashley. When the war's over. - And there's a place back home... ...where a wild plum tree comes to flower in the springtime... ...down by the creek, you know. Yes, I know, I know. When we were little, my brother Jeff and I used to... I told you about my brother Jeff, didn't I, ma'am? I know I did. He... We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am. Since Bull Run, we haven't heard anything and... Please, we must have your temperature now. Just take this in your mouth and not talk anymore. Not just now. Melanie, I'm so tired. I've got to go home. Aren't you tired, Melanie? No, I'm not tired, Scarlett. This might be Ashley... ...and only strangers here to comfort him. No, I'm not tired, Scarlett. They could all be... ...Ashley. I've been waiting one solid hour to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes. Go on, you trash. Don't you be pestering these ladies. - Don't talk to her. - It's all right. Who are you? My name's Belle Watling. But that don't matter. You think I got no business here. Tell me what you want to see me about. First time I come here, I says, ""Belle, you're a nurse. "" They didn't want my kind of nursing. They was more than likely right. Then I tried giving them money. My money wasn't good enough either! The old peahens! I know a gentleman who says you're a human being. If you are, which they ain't, you'll take my money for the hospital. What are you doing here? Haven't you been told twice already? This time I'm conversing with Mrs. Wilkes! You might as well take my money. It's good money, even if it is mine. - I'm sure you're very generous. - I'm a Confederate, like everybody else. Of course you are! Some folks here wouldn't feel that way. But maybe they ain't as good Christians as you. Look, Mrs. Meade, it's a great deal of money. Ten, 20, 30, 50! And it's not our paper money, it's gold! Let me see that handkerchief. R.B.! And she's driving away in Rhett Butler's carriage! Oh, if I just wasn't a lady, what wouldn't I tell that varmint! ""The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ...I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. "" The Yankees! Yankees! Oh, Dr. Meade, they're getting closer. They'll never get into Atlanta. Never get through old Peg Leg Hood. Give me something for the pain! Give me something for the pain! Sorry, son, we haven't got anything to give you. These animals is driving me crazy! What luck! You got my jack. Give me an ace and I'll start another war. And I'll bid the moon. - That I never see you and my Pa again. This leg's got to come off. No, don't! Leave me alone! I'm sorry, soldier. - We're all out of chloroform. - We'll operate without it. No, no, you won't! You can't do it. I won't let you do it! Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off. It's gangrene. No! Oh! I haven't seen my family in three days. I'm going home for half an hour. Orderly, give me a lift! Nurse, you can free this bed. Miss Scarlett! Why, Frank Kennedy. Miss Suellen. Is she well? When did they bring you in? Are you bad hurt? - Suellen. Is she...? - She's all right. Dr. Wilson needs you in the operating room. He's gonna take off that leg. Better hurry. I'll be back. No! You leave me alone! Don't! I can't stand it! No, don't! Don't cut! Don't cut! Don't! Don't! Please! Where's the nurse? Dr. Wilson's waiting. Let him wait! I'm going home! I've done enough! I don't want any more men dying and screaming. I don't want any more! Big Sam! Big Sam! Big Sam! Almighty Moses! It's Miss Scarlett! Big Sam! Big Sam. Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle. I'm so glad to see you. Tell me about Tara, about my mother. She didn't write me. - She gone got sick. - Sick? Just a little bit sick, that's all. Your pa went wild when they wouldn't let him fight. He had fits when they took us to dig the ditch for the soldiers. Your ma said the Confederacy needs it. We's digging for the South. - Was there a doctor? We've got to march. Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees. Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys. If you get sick or hurt, let me know. - Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Scarlett! Scarlett! Climb into this buggy. This is no day for walking. You'll get run over! Oh, Rhett. Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please. Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it? Just another of Sherman's calling cards. He'll pay us a visit soon. I gotta get out of here before the Yankees come! Leave your work at the hospital? Or have you had enough of death and lice and men chopped up? I suppose you weren't meant for sick men. Don't talk like that. I'm so scared! I wish I could get out of here. Let's get out together. No use letting the South come down around your ears. There are too many nice places to go and visit. - Mexico, London, Paris... - With you? Yes, ma'am. With a man who understands and admires you for what you are. I figure we belong together, being the same sort. I've been waiting for you to grow up and get Ashley out of your heart. Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have a baby in another month or so. It'll be hard loving a man with a wife and baby clinging to him. Well, here we are. Are you going with me or are you getting out? I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler. I'll hate and despise you till I die! Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long. Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett! Folks is all going to Macon, and folks is running away! I can't bear those cannonballs right in my ears! I faint every time I hear one. Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk. - You aren't leaving? - I may be a coward... ...but oh, dear! Yankees in Georgia! How did they ever get in? I'm going too. Prissy, go pack my things. Wait, I won't be a minute. - Do you really think you ought to? Scarlett! What is this? You ain't planning on running away? Don't try to stop me. I'm never going back to that hospital. I've had enough of smelling death, of rot and death. I'm going home! I want my mother. My mother needs me. Listen to me! You must stay here. Without a chaperon? It simply isn't... Good heavens, this is war, not a garden party! - Melanie needs you. - Oh, bother Melanie! She's ill already. She shouldn't even be having a baby. Can't we take her along? Want her to be jounced over rough roads and have the baby ahead of time? It isn't my baby. You take care of her! We haven't enough doctors to look after a sick woman. You've got to stay. What for? I don't know anything about babies being born. I knows! I knows! I knows how to do it. I's done it lots and lots. Let me, doctor. Let me. - I can do everything. - Good. I'll rely on you to help us. Ashley's fighting in the field. Fighting for the Cause. He may never come back. He may die. Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child. Ashley. If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry! I promised Ashley something... Then you'll stay? Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat. Scarlett's staying. Go on, Uncle Peter. I don't know what to do. It's like the end of the world! Uncle Peter, my smelling salt! Melanie, Melanie! It's all your fault! I hate you! I hate you! And I hate your baby! If only I hadn't promised Ashley. If only I hadn't promised him! Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop. Are the Yankees coming? The army's pulling out. Pulling out and leaving us to the Yankees? Not leaving, evacuating. Before Sherman cuts the McDonough road. It can't be true! What'll I do? Better refugee south, right quick. If you'll excuse me. Prissy! Prissy! Go pack my things and Melanie's too. We're going to Tara. The Yankees are coming! Scarlett! Scarlett! Melly, we're going to... Melly... I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett. It began at daybreak. But... But... But the Yankees are coming. Poor Scarlett. You'd be at Tara now with your mother, wouldn't you? If it weren't for me. Oh, Scarlett, darling. You've been so good to me. No sister could have been sweeter. I've been lying here thinking... ...if I should die... ...will you take my baby? Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly. Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying? - I'll send for Dr. Meade. - Not yet, Scarlett. I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here for hours... ...while all those poor, wounded boys... Prissy! Prissy, Prissy! Come here, quick! Go get Dr. Meade. Run! Quick! The baby. Don't stand there like a scared goat. Run! Hurry, hurry! I'll sell you south, I will. I swear I will! Where's that Prissy? This room's like an oven already and it isn't noon yet. Don't worry, Melly. Mother says it always seems like the doctor will never come. If I don't take a strap to that Prissy! Oh, Melly... Know what I heard about Maybelle Merriwether? You remember that funny-looking beau of hers? The one with the uniform like ladies' red flannels? You don't have to keep on talking for my sake. I know how worried you are. For to tote the weary load No matter, 'twill never... Oh, Melly... I'll just go and fetch you some cooler water. You're slow as molasses in January. Where's Dr. Meade? - I never seen him, Miss Scarlett. - What? He ain't at the hospital. A man told me that the doctor's down at the car shed... ...with the wounded soldiers... Well, why didn't you go after him? Miss Scarlett, I's scared to go down there at the car shed. There's folks dying down there. And I's scared of dead folks! Go sit by Miss Melly. And don't you be upsetting her or I'll whip the hide off you. Just a few more days For to tote the weary load Have you seen...? Move aside, lady, please. Dr. Meade? Dr. Meade. Dr. Meade, at last! Thank heaven you're here. I need every pair of hands. Now, come, child, wake up. We got work to do. But Melly's having her baby. You've got to come with me! Are you crazy? I can't leave these men for a baby. They're dying! Hundreds! Get a woman to help. But there isn't anybody. Dr. Meade, she might die. Die? Look at them, bleeding to death in front of my eyes! No chloroform. No bandages. Nothing! Nothing to ease their pain. Run along and don't bother me. Don't worry, child. There's nothing to bringing a baby. - Bring the stretchers in here. Dr. Meade? Yeah, I'm coming. Is the doctor come? No, he can't come. Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off. He can't come. There's nobody to come. You've got to manage without the doctor. I'll help you. Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett! Well, what is it? Lordy, we's got to have a doctor! I don't know nothing about birthing babies! - What do you mean? - I don't know... You told me you knew everything! I don't know why I lied! Ma ain't never let me around when folks was having them. Scarlett! Scarlett! Miss Scarlett! Stop it! Go light a fire on the stove. Boil water in the kettle. Get me a ball of twine, clean towels and the scissors. Don't tell me you can't find them! Go get them and get them quick! Scarlett! Scarlett! - Scarlett! - Coming, Melly. Coming! You better go before the Yankees get here. You know I won't leave you. It's no use. I'm gonna die. Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me. - Hold on to me! - Talk to me, Scarlett. Please, talk to me. Don't try to be brave. Yell! There's nobody to hear. Ma says if you puts a knife under the bed, it cuts the pain. Captain Butler! Captain Butler! Captain Butler! - Who do you want? - Captain Butler. He's upstairs. Belle Watling's giving a party. Yes, sir. Thank you. Captain Butler! Oh, Captain Butler! What's all the rumpus about? I's got a message for Captain Butler, Mrs. Watling. Captain Butler, you come out here in the streets to me! - What is it, Prissy? - Miss Scarlett done sent me for you. Miss Melly, she done had her baby today. A fine baby boy. And Miss Scarlett and me, we brung it. Are you telling me Scarlett...? It was mostly me, Captain Butler. Only Miss Scarlett, she helped me a little. But I don't expect no doctor could have done no better. Only, Miss Melly, she feel kind of poorly now it's all over. Yes, I can believe that. And the Yankees is coming. And Miss Scarlett, she says... Captain Butler, the Yankees is here! Please come and bring your carriage for us right away! I'm sorry, but the army took my horse and carriage. You better come upstairs. I'll see what I can do. Oh, no, Captain Butler. Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk if I was to go into Mrs. Watling's. Any of you beauties know where I can steal a horse for a good cause? Is that you, Rhett? We's here, Miss Scarlett! I knew you'd come. Nice weather we're having. Prissy tells me you're... If you make any jokes now, I'll kill you! - Don't tell me you're frightened? - I'm scared to death! If you had sense, you'd be scared too. - Oh, the Yankees! - No, not yet. That's what's left of our army blowing up the ammunition. We gotta get out of here! At your service. Where are you going? - Home, to Tara. - They've been fighting around Tara. You're going to parade through there with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie? Do you intend leaving them? They're going with me, and you can't stop me! It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. Wilkes over open country. I want my mother! I want to go home to Tara! Tara's probably been burned. The woods are full of stragglers. The least they'll do is take the horse. It's not much, but I had trouble stealing it. I'm going home if I have to walk every step of the way! I'll kill you if you try to stop me! I will, I will! I will, I will! Shh, shh, shh. All right, darling, all right. Now you shall go home. I guess anybody who did what you've done today can take care of Sherman. Stop crying. Now blow your nose like a good little girl. There. What're you doing? - I'm packing! Well, stop it and come and get the baby! Melly? - Melly? Mrs. Wilkes? - We're taking you to Tara. - Tara? It's the only way, Melly. They'll burn the house over our heads if we stay. It's all right, Melly. My baby. My poor baby. - Can you put your arms around my neck? - I think so. Never mind. Ashley, Charles! What's she want? Ashley's picture and Charles' sword. Get them. What's that? Our gallant lads set fire to the warehouses. Enough ammunition in boxcars to blow us to Tara. - We have to get across the tracks. - Not that way! We have to. McDonough road's the only one the Yankees haven't cut yet. Wait, I forgot to lock the front door! - What are you laughing at? - At you, locking the Yankees out. Oh, dear! I wish they'd hurry. I wouldn't be in such a hurry to see them go. With them goes the last semblance of law and order. Scavengers aren't wasting any time. Better get out of here fast. There's a horse! Get it! Give us that horse! Down the alley! Cut him off! Pull that horse! I'll get him! Give me that horse! Oh, Miss Scarlett! Haven't left much to take. We'll make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition. Come on! Throw me your shawl. You'll like it better if you don't see anything. Come on! Take a good look, my dear. It's a historic moment. Tell your grandchildren how you watched the Old South disappear one night. They were gonna lick the Yankees in a month. The poor gallant fools. They make me sick. Getting us all into this by swaggering and boasting. That's the way I felt once about their ""swaggering and boasting. "" I'm so glad you aren't with the army. You can be proud. Proud that you've been smarter than all of them. I'm not so proud. Why did you stop? This is the turn to Tara. Let the horse breathe a bit. Mrs. Wilkes. Miss Melly done fainted way back, Captain Butler. She's better off. She couldn't stand the pain if she were conscious. Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy thing? Oh, yes, yes. I know we can get through, Rhett. Not we, my dear, you. I'm leaving you here. You're what? Rhett, where are you going? - I'm going to join the army. - You're joking. - I could kill you for scaring me so. - I'm very serious, Scarlett. I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray. But they're running away. They'll turn and make a last stand. When they do, I'll be with them. - I'm a little late, but better late... - You must be joking! Selfish to the end, aren't you? Thinking of your own hide, never a thought for the Cause. How could you do this to me? And why should you go now that it's all over, and I need you? - Why? Why? - Why? I've always had a weakness for lost causes, once they're really lost. Or maybe... Maybe I'm ashamed of myself. Who knows? You should die of shame to leave me alone and helpless! You? Helpless? Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you. Now climb down here. - I want to say goodbye. - No! Climb down! Rhett, please don't go! You can't leave me, please. I'll never forgive you! I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never forgive myself. If a bullet gets me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot. There's one thing I do know, and that is I love you, Scarlett. In spite of you and me and the world going to pieces, I love you. Because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us. Selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eye and call them by name. Don't hold me like that! Scarlett... Look at me. I love you more than I've ever loved any woman. And I've waited longer for you than any woman. Let me alone! A soldier of the South loves you. Wants your arms around him. Wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle. Never mind about loving me. You're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory. Scarlett, kiss me. Kiss me once. You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you! They were right. Everybody was right. You aren't a gentleman. A minor point at such a moment. Here. If anyone lays a hand on that nag, shoot him. But don't make a mistake and shoot the nag. Go on! I want you to go. I hope a cannonball blows you into a million pieces...! Never mind the rest. I follow your general idea. And when I'm dead on the altar of my country, I hope your conscience irks you. Goodbye, Scarlett. Come on, you. We're going home. Oh, my poor baby. Don't worry. Mother will take care of him when we get home. Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry. - We's got to have something to eat. - Hush up! We're nearly at Twelve Oaks. We'll stop there. Go on! Oh, Ashley. Ashley, I'm glad you're not here to see this. The Yankees. The dirty Yankees! Prissy! Come tie up this cow. We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett. We'll be home soon, and I's scared of cows. Tie her onto the back of the wagon with your petticoat. We need milk for the baby, and we don't know what we'll find at home. Melly, we're home! We're at Tara. Hurry! Move, you brute! Miss Scarlett, it's dead! I can't see the house. Is it there? I can't see the house. Have they burned it? It's all right! It's all right! They haven't burned it. It's still there! Mother! Mother, I'm home! Mother, let me in. It's me. Scarlett! Oh, Pa! I'm home. Katie? Katie Scarlett! Oh, darlin'! Mammy! Mammy, I'm home. Honey child... Mammy, I'm so... Where's Mother? Why... ...Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen, they was sick with the typhoid. They had it bad, but they's doing all right now. - Just weak, like little kittens. - But where's Mother? Well... Miss Ellen. She went down to nurse that Emmie Slattery... ...that white trash, and she took down with it too. Then last night, she... Mother? Miss Scarlett, honey. If there's anything I can do, Miss Scarlett... - What did you do with Melly? - Don't worry your pretty head. I done slapped her in bed, along with the baby. You better put that cow into the barn. There ain't no barn no more. - Yankees burned it for firewood. This was their headquarters. They camped all around. Yankees in Tara? Yes'm, and they stole most everything they didn't burn. All the clothes and all the rugs, and even Miss Ellen's rosaries. I'm starving. Get me something to eat. There ain't nothing to eat, honey. They took it all. All the chickens? Everything? They took them first. What they didn't eat, they carried off. Don't tell me any more about what ""they"" did! What's this, Pa? - Whiskey? - Yes, daughter. Katie Scarlett, that's enough. Your not knowing spirits, you'll make yourself tipsy. I hope it makes me drunk. I'd like to be drunk. Oh, Pa... What are those papers? Bonds. They're all we've saved, all we have left. Bonds. But what kind of bonds, Pa? Why, Confederate bonds, of course. Confederate bonds. What good are they to anybody? I'll not have you talking like that. Oh, Pa, what are we going to do with no money... ...and nothing to eat? We must ask your mother. That's it. We must ask Mrs. O'Hara. - Ask Mother? - Yes. Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done. Now don't be bothering me. Go out for a ride. I'm busy. Oh, Pa... Don't worry about anything. Katie Scarlett's home. You needn't worry. What'll we do with nothing to feed those sick folks and that child? I don't know, Mammy. I don't know. We ain't got nothing but radishes in the garden. Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen... ...they's fussing to be sponged off. - Where are the other servants? - Only just me and Pork left. The others went to war or runned away. I can't take care of that baby and sick folkses too! I's only got two hands. Who's gonna milk that cow, Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers. As God is my witness... As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over... ...I'll never be hungry again. No, nor any of my folk. If I have to lie, steal, cheat, or kill... ...as God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again! My back's near broken. Look at my hands! Mother said you could always tell a lady by her hands. I guess things like hands and ladies don't matter so much anymore. Rest, Sue. You're not well yet. I can pick cotton for both of us. Scarlett's hateful! Making us work in the fields... Too bad about that. Get back to work. I can't do everything at Tara myself. What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara! Don't you ever dare say you hate Tara again! It's the same as hating Pa and Ma. There's something I must speak to you about. What is it? I don't like the way you're treating Prissy and Mammy. You must be firm with inferiors, but gentle with them. Especially darkies. I know. But I'm not asking them to do what I don't do myself. Nevertheless, I don't like it. I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it. - What are you doing out of bed? - I must talk to you. You're all working so hard. I can't just lie in bed. Go upstairs. You're as weak as a newborn colt. - Please, let me. - Stop being noble. I don't need you making yourself sick so you'll never be any use. Oh, I didn't think of it that way. Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot! You all alone, little lady? You ain't very friendly, are you? You got anything else besides these earbobs? You Yankees have been here before. Regular little spitfire, ain't you? What do you got hidden in your hand? Scarlett, you killed him. I'm glad you killed him. Scarlett, what happened? What is it, Scarlett? What is it? Don't be scared! Your sister was cleaning a revolver and it went off and scared her. Thank goodness! We got enough to frighten us. Tell Katie Scarlett she must be more careful. What a cool liar you are, Melly. We gotta get him out of here and bury him. If the Yankees find him here... I didn't see anyone else. I think he must be a deserter. Even so, we've gotta hide him. They might hear about it, and then they'd come and get you. I could bury him in the arbor where the ground is soft... ...but how will I get him out of here? - We'll both take a leg and drag him. - You couldn't drag a cat. Scarlett... Would it be dishonest if we went through his haversack? I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself. You take the haversack. I'll search his pockets. You look. I'm feeling a little weak. I think it's full of money. Melly, look. Just look! Ten, 20, 30... Don't stop to count it now. We haven't got time! Do you realize this means we can eat? Look in his other pockets. Hurry, hurry! We've got to get him out of here. If he bleeds across the yard, we can't hide it. Give me your nightgown. I'll wad it round his head. Don't be silly, I won't look at you. If I had on pantalets, I'd use them. Thank heavens I'm not that modest. Now go back to bed. You'll be dead if you don't. I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him. No, I'll clean it up. Well, I guess I've done murder. I won't think about that now. I'll think about that tomorrow. Katie Scarlett! It's over! It's over! It's all over, the war. Lee surrendered! - It's not possible. - Why did we ever fight? Ashley will be coming home. Yes, Ashley will be coming home. We'll plant more cotton. Cotton ought to go sky-high next year. The flag that makes you free So we sing the chorus From Atlanta to the sea While we were marching through Georgia Get out of the road, rebel! Have you room for a dying man? Not for any Southern scum, alive or dead. Get out of the way! I reckon he'd rather try and walk it, at that. Jump, you gray-backed beggars! Acts like they won the war. You come on, give me them pants, Mr. Kennedy. Come on! Scrub yourself with that lye soap, 'fore I scrub you myself. I'm gonna put these britches in the boiling pot. The whole army's got the same troubles... ...crawling clothes and dysentery. It's humiliating how you're treating him. You'd be a sight more humiliated if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you. Oh, come on, Beau! We must leave this gentleman alone because he's tired and he's hungry. I don't mind, ma'am. Good to see a youngster again. Nice little fella. Another two years, and we could've had him in Cobb's Legion. - Were you in Cobb's Legion? Yes, ma'am. Why, then, you must know my husband, Major Wilkes? Oh, yes, ma'am. He was captured at Spotsylvania, I think. Captured? Oh, thank heaven! Then he isn't... - My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison. Melanie? Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming. Come along, Beau. I'll watch out for him. We're good friends. Thank you. I slave day and night just so we can have enough food... ...and you give it away to scarecrows. - I'd sooner have a plague of locusts. - Don't scold me, Scarlett. I've just heard that Ashley was taken prisoner. - Ashley a prisoner? - Yes. And maybe if he's alive and well, he's on some Northern road right now. Maybe a Northern woman is giving him some of her dinner... ...and helping my beloved to come back home to me. - I hope so, Melly. Miss Scarlett? I want to take up something with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to... Perhaps I can help you. I'm head of the house now. Well, I... I... Miss Scarlett, I was aiming to ask for Suellen. Are you telling me you haven't asked for her after all these years? The truth is, I'm so much older than she is... ...and now I haven't a cent to my name. Who has, nowadays? Miss Scarlett, if true love carries any weight with you... ...you can be sure your sister will be rich in that. I'd go and get myself a little business, if we're engaged. - As soon as I'm on my feet again... - All right, Frank. I'm sure I can speak for Pa. You go ask her now. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Scarlett. Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes. Excuse me. What seems to be the trouble with Mr. Kennedy? More trouble than he guesses. He's finally asked for Suellen's hand. Oh, I'm so glad. It's a pity he can't marry her now. It'd be one less mouth to feed. Oh, another one! - Hope this one isn't hungry. - He'll be hungry. I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate... Ashley! Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it. Turn me loose, you fool. Turn me loose! It's Ashley! He's her husband, ain't he? - Miss Scarlett? - High time you got back. - Did you get the horse shod? - Yes'm, he's shod. Fine thing, horses get shoes and humans can't. Here, stir this soap. Miss Scarlett, ma'am? I gotta know how much money have you got left. In gold. Ten dollars. Why? That won't be enough. What are you talking about? Well, I see'd that old no-count white-trash Wilkerson... ...that used to be Mr. Gerald's overseer here. He's a regular Yankee now, and he was making a brag... ...that his Carpetbagger friends run the taxes way up sky-high on Tara. - How much more we got to pay? - I hear the taxman say $300. Three hundred...! It might just as well be 3 million. But we gotta raise it, that's all. Yes'm. How? - I'll go ask Mr. Ashley. - He ain't got no $300. Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I? Asking ain't getting. Ashley... They say Abe Lincoln got his start splitting rails. Just think what heights I may climb to, once I get the knack. Ashley, the Yankees want $300 more in taxes. What shall we do? Ashley, what's to become of us? What becomes of people when their civilization breaks up? Those with brains and courage come through all right. Those that haven't are winnowed out. For heaven's sake... ...don't talk nonsense when it's us being winnowed out! You're right, Scarlett. Here I am talking tommyrot about civilization... ...while your Tara is in danger. You've come to me for help, and I've none to give. Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward. You, Ashley? A coward? What are you afraid of? Mostly of life becoming too real for me, I suppose. Not that I mind splitting rails. But I do mind very much losing the beauty of that life I loved. If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks. But the war did come. I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits. I saw men crumple up in agony when I shot them. And now I find myself in a world which for me is worse than death. A world in which there's no place for me. I can't make you understand. You don't know the meaning of fear. You never mind facing realities. You never want to escape from them as I do. Escape? Ashley, you're wrong. I do want to escape too. I'm so very tired of it all. I've struggled for food and for money. I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton till I can't stand it. I tell you, the South is dead. It's dead! The Yankees and Carpetbaggers have it and left nothing for us. Oh, Ashley... Let's run away. We'd go to Mexico. They want officers in the Mexican army. We'd be happy. I'd work for you. I'd do anything for you! You don't love Melanie. You said you loved me at Twelve Oaks. And anyway, Melanie can't... Dr. Meade said she can't have more children. I could give you... Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks? You think I could ever forget? Have you? Can you honestly say you don't love me? - No, I don't love you. - It's a lie! Even so, do you think I'd leave Melanie and the baby? You couldn't leave your father and the girls. I'm sick of them. I'm tired of them! Yes, you're sick and tired. That's why you're talking this way. You've carried the load for all of us. From now on, I'll be more help to you. I promise. There's only one way you can help me. Take me away. There's nothing to keep us here. Nothing? Nothing except honor. Please, Scarlett. Please, dear. You mustn't cry. You mustn't. Please, my brave dear, you mustn't. You do love me! You do love me! - No, don't, don't. - You love me. We won't do this. I tell you, we won't do it! It won't happen again. I'll take Melanie and go. - Say it. You love me. - All right, I'll say it. I love your courage and stubbornness so much that I could forget... ...the best wife a man ever had. But I'm not going to forget her! Then there's nothing left for me. Nothing to fight for. Nothing to live for. Yes, there is something. Something you love better than me... ...though you may not know it. Tara. Yes. I still have this. You needn't go. I won't have you all starve, simply because I threw myself at your head. It won't happen again. It's Emmie Slattery. - Yes'm, it's me. Stop! You haven't forgotten your old overseer, have you? Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now. Get off those steps, you wench! Get off this land! You can't speak that way to my wife. Wife? High time you made her your wife. Who baptized your brats after you killed my mother? We came out here to pay a call. A friendly call, and talk business with old friends. Friends? When were we ever friends? Still high and mighty, ain't you? Well, I know all about you. Your father's turned idiot. You can't pay your taxes, and I come to offer to buy the place from you. To make you a right good offer. Emmie wants to live here. Get off this place, you dirty Yankee! You'll see who's running things when you're sold out for taxes. I'll buy this place and I'll live in it! But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale. That's all of Tara you'll ever get! You'll be sorry for that. We'll be back! I'll show you who the owner of Tara is! Pa, come back! Pa, come back! Yankee coward! Pa! Lordy, Miss Scarlett, that's Mr. Gerald's watch! You take it. It's for you. Pa'd want you to have it. You ain't got no business parting from this watch now. You needs all your valuables to sell for that tax money. Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch? And don't cry. I can stand everybody's tears but yours. Oh, Mammy, Mammy! You've been brave so long. You just gotta go on being brave. - Think about your Pa like he used to be. - I can't think about Pa. I can't think of anything but that $300. Ain't no good thinking about that. Ain't nobody got that much money. Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags got that much money now. Rhett. Who that? A Yankee? Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale... ...and I haven't any clothes. Go and get Ma's old box of dress patterns. - What you up to? - You'll make me a new dress. Not with Miss Ellen's portires! Great balls of fire! They're my portires now. I'm going to Atlanta for $300, and I've got to look like a queen. - Who's going with you? - I'll go alone. That's what you think! I's going with you and that new dress. - Mammy, darling. - No use to try to sweet talk me. I knows you since I put diapers on you. I said I's going with you, and going I is! Kings in trade, eh? Too good for me, major. It's a pity the war wasn't a poker game. You'd done better than Grant, with far less effort. What is it? There's a lady to see Captain Butler. Says she's his sister. Another sister? This is a jail not a harem, captain. No, she ain't one of those. She's got her mammy with her. She has? I'd like to see this one, major. Without her mammy. Let's see, my losses for the afternoon come to what? Three hundred and forty? My debts do mount up, don't they, major? All right, corporal, show Captain Butler's ""sister"" to his cell. Thank you, major. Excuse me, gentlemen. It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly. - Rhett! - Scarlett! My dear little sister! It's all right, corporal. My sister has brought me no files or saws. Can I really kiss you? On the forehead, like a good brother. No, thanks. I'll wait and hope for better things. I was so distressed when I heard you were in jail. I couldn't sleep for thinking. It's not true they'll hang you? Would you be sorry? - Oh, Rhett. - Well, don't worry yet. They trumped up a charge, but they really want my money. They think I made off with the Confederate treasury. - Well, did you? - What a leading question. Let's not talk about things like money. How good of you to come and see me. And how pretty you look! How you do run on, teasing a country girl like me. Thank heavens you're not in rags. I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around. You look good enough to eat, and prosperous. I've been doing very well. Everyone's well at Tara, only... ...I got so bored, I thought I'd treat myself to a visit to town. You're heartless, but that's part of your charm. You've got more charm than the law allows. I didn't come to talk silliness about me. I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble. I was mad at you when you left me on the road to Tara. - And I still haven't forgiven you. - Don't say that. Well, I must admit I might not be alive now, only for you. When I think of myself with anything I could possibly hope for... ...not a care in the world, and you here in this horrid jail. And not even a human jail, Rhett, a horse jail! Listen to me trying to make jokes... ...when I really want to cry. In a minute I shall cry. Scarlett... Can it be possible that...? Can what be possible, Rhett? That you've grown a woman's heart? A real woman's heart. I have, Rhett. I know I have. It's worth being in jail just to hear you say that. It's well worth it. You can drop the moonlight and magnolia. Things have been going well at Tara? What've you done with your hands? - I went riding without my gloves... - You've been working like a field hand! Why did you lie, and what are you up to? - I almost believed you cared. - But I do care! Let's get down to the truth. You want something enough... ...to put on quite a show in your velvets. What is it? Money? I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara. I lied when I said everything was all right. Things are as bad as they possibly could be. And you've got millions. What collateral do you have? - My earbobs. - Not interested. - Mortgage on Tara. - What would I do with a farm? - I'd pay you out of next year's cotton. - Not good enough. You once said you loved me. If you still love me... You haven't forgotten, I'm not a marrying man. No, I haven't forgotten. You're not worth $300. You'll never mean anything but misery to any man. I don't care what you say, only give me the money. I won't let Tara go! I can't while there's a breath left in my body. Oh, Rhett, won't you please give me the money? I couldn't if I wanted to. My funds are in Liverpool, not Atlanta. If I drew a draft, they'd be on me like a duck on a June bug. So you see, my dear, you've abased yourself to no purpose. Here, here. Stop it! You want the Yankees to see you like this? Take your hands off me, you skunk! You knew what I wanted. You knew you wouldn't lend me the money and you let me go on! I enjoyed hearing what you had to say. Cheer up. Come to my hanging, I'll put you in my will. I'll come to your hanging! I'm just afraid they won't hang you in time to pay the taxes on Tara! Tell him Belle Watling. Where you been? I thought you deserted Captain Butler. I keep myself occupied. Help me out. Who that? I ain't never see'd hair that color before in my life. You know a dyed-haired woman? Wish I knew that one. She'd get my money for me. Whatever they done to you in there... ...they didn't do no more than you deserve for visiting white trash. Fresh and green. Right off the farm. What you doing tonight, Susie? That's a Georgia peach! Nothing like that in Ohio. You know what we'll do? What? We're gonna give every one of you 40 acres and a mule. And a mule? - Forty acres and a mule! Gee! - Because we're your friend. And you're gonna become voters and vote like your friends do! What's your hurry? What's come over this town? Yankees have come over it. Same as they've come over all of them. Out of our way, trash! Get out of the way here! Get away! Go on. It can't be Miss Scarlett! Frank Kennedy! And Mammy. It's good to see home folks. I didn't know you were here. I didn't know you were. Didn't Suellen tell you about my store? Did she? I don't remember. Have you a store? - This? - Won't you come in, look around a bit? I don't suppose it looks like much to a lady... ...but I can't help being proud of it. - You're not making money? - Well, I can't complain. In fact, I'm mighty encouraged. Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant. Won't be long before Miss Suellen and I can marry. - Are you doing as well as all that? - Yes, I am. I'm no millionaire yet... ...but I've cleared $1000 already. And lumber too. - That's only a sideline. - A sideline, Frank? With all the good Georgia pine around Atlanta, and all this building? Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett... ...and I gotta think about buying a home. Why would you want a home? For Suellen to set up housekeeping. Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her to Atlanta. There wouldn't be much help in that for Tara. I don't know what you mean. I don't mean a thing. How'd you like to drive me to my Aunt Pitty's? Nothing'd give me more pleasure. You better stay to supper. Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable, and I'd like a long visit. You act on me just like a tonic, Miss Scarlett. And will you tell me all the news... ...of Miss Suellen? What's the matter? Miss Suellen's not ill, is she? Oh, no, no. I thought surely she had written you. I guess she was ashamed to write you. She should be ashamed. How awful to have such a mean sister. You must tell me. Don't leave me on tenterhooks. Well, she's going to marry one of the county boys next month. She got tired of waiting, was afraid she'd be an old maid and... Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you. It's cold, and I left my muff at home. Would you mind if I put my hand in your pocket? But, Melanie, you don't realize what she's done! She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy! He's my beau and she's married him! - She did it to save Tara. - I hate Tara! I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing I hate worse than Tara! It's all my fault. I should've committed robbery to get that tax money for you. I couldn't let you do anything like that. Anyway, it's done now. Yes, it's done now. You won't let me do anything dishonorable... ...yet you'd sell yourself in marriage to a man you didn't love. You won't have to worry about my helplessness anymore. What do you mean? I'm going to New York. I've arranged for a position in a bank. But you can't do that. I counted on you to help me start a lumber business and... I counted on you. I don't know anything about the lumber business. You know as much as you do about banking... ...and I'd give you half the business. That's generous of you, Scarlett. But it isn't that. If I go to Atlanta and take help from you again... ...I'd bury any hope of ever standing alone. Oh, is that all? You could gradually buy the business, and then it would be your own and... No, Scarlett. Oh! Ashley! Ashley! Scarlett? Scarlett, what is it? Ashley's so mean and hateful! What have you done? She wanted me to go to Atlanta. To help me start my lumber business. And he won't help me! How unchivalrous of you. Why, think, Ashley, think! If it hadn't been for Scarlett, I'd have died in Atlanta... ...and maybe we wouldn't have little Beau. When I think of her picking cotton and plowing... ...just to keep food in our mouths, I could just... Oh, my darling. All right, Melanie. I'll go to Atlanta. I can't fight you both. Come on, lift them feet! There's your new mill hands, Mrs. Kennedy. The pick of all the best jails in Georgia. They look thin and weak. Halt! They're the best you can lease. If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher a free hand... ...you'll get what you want out of them. All right, you're the foreman. Just keep the mill running and deliver my lumber when I want it. Johnnie Gallegher's your man, miss. But remember... ...no questions and no interference. That's a bargain. Start in the morning. Come on, get a move on there! But this isn't right, and you know it. Bad enough to be a businesswoman... Why do you complain? You wouldn't own a mill if I didn't take over. But I didn't want the mill. We couldn't buy it if you hadn't pressed our friends for their debts. Isn't that right, Ashley? Are you running a charitable institution? Go back to the store, and go home and take your medicine. Sugar, don't you think...? Great balls of fire! Don't bother me. And don't call me ""sugar. "" All right. All right. Good night, Ashley. My, my! She can get mad quicker than any woman I ever saw. I don't like to interfere... ...but I wish you'd let me hire darkies and not use convicts. We could do better. Darkies' pay would break us. Convicts are cheap. If we give Gallegher a free hand... A free hand? That means he'll starve and whip them. Didn't you see them? Some are sick. How you do run on. If I let you alone, you'd give them chicken... ...and tuck them in with quilts. I won't make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others. You didn't mind owning slaves. That was different. We didn't treat them that way. I'd have freed them when father died... ...if the war hadn't already freed them. Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley. Do you forget what it's like without money? Money is the most important thing in the world. I don't intend to be without it again. I'll make enough the only way I know how so the Yankees can't take Tara. We're not the only Southerners who've suffered. Look at all our friends. They're keeping their honor and kindness. And they're starving. I've no use for fools who won't help themselves. I know what they say about me. I don't care. I'll befriend Carpetbaggers and beat them at their own game. And you'll beat them with me. That's it. Pull it a little over to that side. - Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy. - Good afternoon. - Business is certainly growing. - It certainly is. You're doing business with the people... ...who robbed us, tortured us and left us to starve. All that's past. I intend to make the best of things, even if they are Yankee things. And do you know that Dr. Meade actually saw her... ...peddling lumber to Yankees herself? - That isn't all. It's shocking what she's doing to my brother. She's even taken to driving her own buggy. My dear Mrs. Kennedy. My very dear Mrs. Kennedy! I don't see how you have the gall to face me! You could've had my millions if you'd just waited a while. Oh, how fickle is woman! What is it you want? I have things to do. Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point which has always bothered me? Well, what is it? Tell me, do you never shrink from marrying men you don't love? How'd you get out ofjail? Why didn't they hang you? Oh, that! There's nothing much that money won't buy. I observe it's even bought you the honorable Mr. Wilkes. So you still hate Ashley Wilkes. I believe you're jealous of him. You still think you're the belle of the county, the cutest trick in shoe leather. - That every man is in love with you. - Let me by. Don't be angry. Tell me, where are you going? - I'm going out to the mill. - Through Shantytown alone? It's dangerous to drive alone through all that riffraff. Don't worry about me. I can shoot straight, if I don't have to shoot too far. What a woman! Give me a quarter. Let go of my horse! Hold this horse. - Let go! - Give me that gun. Help! Help! Help! Miss Scarlett! Wait! Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett! It's Sam! - Big Sam? Miss Scarlett, wait! Sam! Sam! Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett? Did they hurt you? Don't you cry. Big Sam will get you out of this in a jiffy. Horse, make tracks! Get to Tara as quick as you can and stay there. I will. I's had enough of them Carpetbaggers. Thank you, Mr. Frank. Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye, Sam. Thank you. Change your dress and go over to Miss Melly's. I've got to go to a political meeting. How can you go to a political meeting after what I've been through? Oh, sugar. You're more scared than hurt. Nobody cares about me. You all act as though it were nothing at all. The men talk about protecting our women... ...and then after what happened to me, Frank went to a political meeting. And if it won't pain you too much, India Wilkes... ...tell me why you're staring at me. Has my face gone green? It won't pain me. What happened today was just what you deserved. With any justice, you'd have gotten worse. India, hush up. - Let her talk. She's always hated me. Ever since I took Charles away, though she won't admit it. If she thought anybody'd notice, she'd walk the street naked. I do hate you! You've done all you could to lower the prestige of decent people. Now you've endangered the lives of our men... ...because they've got to... India! We'd better not say any more, or one of us will be saying too much. What's going on that I don't know about? Shh! Somebody's coming up the walk. Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley. Will you hand me the pistol, Mrs. Meade? Whoever it is... ...we know nothing. Where have they gone? Tell me. It's life or death. Don't tell him. He's a Yankee spy. Quickly. There may be time. - How'd you know? - I played poker with Yankees. They knew there'd be trouble. They sent the cavalry out. Your men are walking into a trap. Don't tell him. He's trying to trap you. Out the Decatur road. The old Sullivan plantation. They're meeting in the cellar. I'll do what I can. What's this about? If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy. We thought it best not to tell you. The men have gone to clean out the woods where you were attacked. It's what many of our Southern men have had to do to protect us. And if they're captured, they'll be hanged. And it will be your fault. Another word and you leave, India. Scarlett did what she had to do. Our men are doing what they think they have to do. Frank... ...and Ashley. Oh, it isn't possible. There's horses, Miss Melly. Here they come. We're sewing, we're sewing! Open the door. Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy. Who is Mrs. Wilkes? I am Mrs. Wilkes. - I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes. - He's not here. - Are you sure? - Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word! I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes. If you give me your word, I won't search the house. Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store. He's not at the store. There's no meeting tonight, no political meeting. We'll wait outside till he and his friends return. Surround the house. Put a man on each door and window. Keep on with your sewing, ladies. And I'll read aloud. ""The Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield. Chapter One. I am born. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born... "" ""Chapter Nine. I have a memorable birthday. I pass over all that happened at school... ...until the anniversary of my birthday came round in March. Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever, I remember nothing. He was going away at the end of the half-year... ...if not sooner, and was more spirited and independent than before. But beyond this, I remember nothing. The great... "" ""I remember nothing. "" Melly, they're drunk! Leave this to me, Scarlett. And, please, say nothing. - You stupid fool! - Shh! Quiet! Will you shut up, for the love of... Hello, Melly. So you've got my husband intoxicated again. Well, bring him in. I'm sorry, your husband's under arrest. If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta, you must arrest a good many Yankees. Bring him in, Captain Butler, if you can walk yourself. - Wait. - I wanna tell you a story. Listen, doctor, I... Put him down in that chair. Now, captain, please leave my house... ...and try to remember not to come here again. That's fine thanks I get for bringing him home... ...and not leaving him in this shameful condition. Now, boys, all together... Dr. Meade! I'm astonished at you! Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me? I ain't so very drunk, Melly. Take him to the bedroom. Lay him out on the bed. - Don't touch him. He's under arrest. - Now, Tom. What do you want to arrest him for? I've seen him drunker. I've seen you drunker. And you've seen me... He can lie in the gutter for all I care. I'm not a policeman. He led a raid on that Shantytown where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble. A lot of shanties were burned. A couple of men were killed. It's time you rebels learned you can't take the law into your own hands. What are you laughing at? This isn't your night to teach that lesson. These two have been with me tonight. Yes, sir. With you, Rhett? Where? I don't like to say in the presence of ladies. You'd better say. Come out on the porch and I'll tell you. Speak out. I think I have a right to know where my husband's been. Well, ma'am... ...we dropped in on a friend of mine... ...and the captain's. A Mrs. Belle Watling. We played cards and drank champagne, and, well... Now you've done it. Did you have to show me up in front of my wife? Now, I hope you're satisfied. These ladies won't be speaking with their husbands. Well, Rhett, I had no idea. Look here, will you take an oath that they were with you tonight at Belle's? Ask Belle if you don't believe me. She'll tell you. Will you give me your word, as a gentleman? As a gentleman? Why, certainly, Tom. Well, if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry. I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. If you'll leave us in peace. Well, I say I'm sorry. Well, I am sorry. Come on, sergeant. Lock that door. Pull down the shades. - Oh! - Ashley! He's all right. It's only in the shoulder. Get him on the bed where I can dress the wound. I think I can walk. It's not worth the effort. Which way? In here. Mammy, I want hot water. And lint for bandages. What can I use for a probe? If I only had my bag. Were you really there? What did it look like? Does she have cut-glass chandeliers, plush curtains and dozens of mirrors? Good heavens, Mrs. Meade, remember yourself. Captain Butler, tell me what happened, all that happened. I was too late. When I got to the Sullivan place, there had already been a skirmish. I found Mr. Wilkes wounded, and Dr. Meade was with him. I had to prove they'd been somewhere, anyplace but where they were. - So I took them to Belle's. - And she took them in? She's by way of being an old friend of mine. Oh, I'm sorry... I'm sorry I couldn't think up a more dignified alibi. This isn't the first time you've come between me and disaster. It isn't likely that I'd question any device of yours. And now I'll go and see what Dr. Meade needs. Oh, Ashley... Ashley... Have you no interest in what's become of your own husband? Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's? No. Well, where is he? He's lying out on Decatur Road... ...shot through the head. He's dead. Who is it? It's Mrs. Watling. Oh, Mrs. Watling. Won't you come in the house? Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Mrs. Wilkes. You come in and sit a minute with me. How can I thank you enough for what you did for us? I got your note saying you would call on me and thank me. Why, Mrs. Wilkes, you must have lost your mind. I came as soon as it was dark to say you mustn't think of any such thing. Why, I'm... Well, you're... It wouldn't be fitting at all. It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank a woman who saved my husband's life? Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady nice to me like you was. I mean, about the money for the hospital. I don't forget a kindness. I thought about you being widowed with a little boy... ...if Mr. Wilkes got hung. He's a nice little boy, your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes. I got a boy myself, so I... You have? Does he live...? Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta. He ain't never been here. He's off at school. I ain't seen him since he was little. Anyways, if it had been that Mrs. Kennedy's husband by hisself... ...I wouldn't have lifted a finger, no matter what Rhett said. She's a mighty cold woman... ...prancing about Atlanta by herself. She killed her husband same as if she shot him. You mustn't say unkind things about my sister-in-law. Oh. Please don't freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes. I forgot how you liked her. She just ain't in the same class with you, and I can't help it if I think so. Well, anyways, I gotta be going. I'm scared somebody'll recognize this carriage if I stay any longer. That wouldn't do you no good. And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me on the street... ...you don't have to speak to me. I'll understand. I should be proud to speak to you. Proud to be under obligation to you. I hope we meet again. Oh, no. That wouldn't be fitting. - Good night, Mrs. Wilkes. - Good night, Mrs. Watling. And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy. She's brokenhearted about her husband. Great balls of fire! It's Rhett. Captain Butler's here. I told him you was prostrate with grief. Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy. She says she's coming. I don't know why she's coming, but she's coming. You don't like me, Mammy. Don't you argue with me. You don't. You really don't. It's no good, Scarlett. - What? - The cologne. I don't know what you mean. I mean you've been drinking. Brandy. Quite a lot. Well, what if I have? Is that any of your affair? Don't drink alone. People always find out, and it ruins a reputation. What is it? This is more than losing old Frank. Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid. I don't believe it. You've never been afraid. I'm afraid now. I'm afraid of dying and going to hell. You look pretty healthy. And maybe there isn't any hell. Oh, there is. I know there is. I was raised on it. Far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood. Tell me what you've done that hell yawns before you. I ought never to have married Frank. He was Suellen's beau, and he loved her, not me. And I made him miserable, and I killed him. Yes, I did. I killed him. Rhett, for the first time... ...I'm finding out what it is to be sorry for something I've done. Here. Dry your eyes. If you had it all to do over again, you'd do no differently. You're like the thief who isn't sorry he stole... ...but he's terribly sorry he's going to jail. I'm glad Mother's dead. I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me. I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind... ...and sadly, I've turned out disappointing. You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag. So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say. Say it, then, and get out! - What is it? - I can't go on any longer without you. Oh! You really are the most ill-bred man to come here at a time... I made up my mind you were the only woman for me... ...the first day I saw you. Now you have a mill and Frank's money... ...and won't come to me as you did to the jail. - So I see I shall have to marry you. - I never heard of such bad taste. Would you be convinced if I fell to my knees? Turn me loose and get out. Forgive me for startling you with my impetuous sentiments... ...my dear Scarlett... I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy. But you must have noticed that for some time... ...the friendship I've felt for you has ripened into a deeper feeling. A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred... Dare I name it? Can it be love? Get up off your knees. I don't like your common jokes. This is an honorable proposal of marriage... ...made at what I consider a most opportune moment. I can't go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands. You're coarse and you're conceited. And I think this conversation's gone far enough. Besides, I shall never marry again. Oh, yes, you will. And you'll marry me. You? You? I don't love you. And I don't like being married. Ever think of marrying just for fun? Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee! Fun for men, you mean. Do you want them to hear you? You've been married to a boy and an old man. Why not try a husband of the right age, with a way with women? You're a fool, Rhett Butler... ...when you know I shall always love another man. Stop it. You hear me? Stop it. No more of that talk. Don't. I shall faint. I want you to faint. This is what you're meant for. None of those fools have kissed you like this. Your Charles or your Frank or your stupid Ashley. Say you're going to marry me. Say yes. Say yes. Yes. Are you sure you meant it? You don't want to take it back? No. Look at me, and try to tell me the truth. Did you say yes because of my money? Well, yes, partly. Partly? Well, you know, Rhett, money does help. - And, of course, I am fond of you. - Fond of me? If I said I was madly in love with you, you'd know I was lying. - You say we have a lot in common... - Yes, you're right, my dear. I'm not in love any more than you are. Heaven help the man who ever really loves you. What kind of ring would you like? A diamond ring, and do buy a great big one. You'll have the biggest and most vulgar ring in Atlanta. I'll take you to New Orleans for the most expensive honeymoon. - That'd be heavenly. - I'll buy your trousseau for you too. How wonderful... ...but you won't tell anybody, will you? Still the little hypocrite. Won't you kiss me goodbye? You've had enough kissing for one afternoon. You're impossible. You can go. I don't care if you never come back. But I will come back. What are you thinking about, Scarlett? I'm thinking about how rich we are. I can keep the lumber business too? Yes, of course you can, if it amuses you. Now that you're so rich, you can tell everybody to go to the devil. But you were the main one I wanted to go to the devil. Don't scrape the plate. I'm sure there's more in the kitchen. Oh, Rhett, can I have a chocolate one stuffed with meringue? If you don't stop being a glutton, you'll get as fat as Mammy. And I'll divorce you. It'd be nice if you bought something for Mammy. Why should I buy her a present when she called us both mules? Mules? Why mules? She said we could give ourselves air and get slicked up like racehorses... ...but we were just mules in horse harness and we didn't fool anybody. I never heard anything more true. Mammy's a smart old soul. And one of the few people I know whose respect I'd like to have. - I won't give her a thing. - Then I'll take her a petticoat. My mammy said when she went to heaven... ...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat so stiff that it'd stand by itself... ...and so rustley the Lord would say it's made of angels' wings. She won't take it from you. She'd rather die than wear it. That may be. But I'm making the gesture just the same. Wake up. Wake up! You were having another nightmare. Oh, Rhett. Rhett, I was so cold and hungry and so tired. I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist and I couldn't find it. - Find what, honey? - I don't know. I always dream the same dream, and I never know. It seems to be hidden in the mist. Darling... Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream that I found it, and that I'm safe? Dreams don't work that way. But when you get used to being safe and warm... ...you'll stop dreaming that dream. And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe. Rhett, would you do something for me if I asked you? You know I would. Will you take me away from here? - Don't you like New Orleans? - I love New Orleans... ...but I want to go home and visit Tara. Will you take me to Tara? Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will. We'll go tomorrow. You get your strength from this red earth of Tara. You're part of it and it's part of you. I'd give anything to have Tara the way it was before the war. Would you? Go ahead and make it that way. Spend whatever you want. Make it as fine a plantation as it ever was. Oh, Rhett! Rhett, you are good to me. Can we still have our big new house in Atlanta? Yes. And it can be as ornate as you want. Marble terraces, stained-glass windows. Won't everyone be jealous! I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy. I don't care. Scarlett's hateful... ...building that new house just to show off! And even taking our servants! Oh, darling, you mustn't think unkindly of her. She's made it possible for us to keep Tara, always. Yes, and what good is Tara? She's had three husbands, and I'll be an old maid! Great Jehoshaphat! Great Jehoshaphat! Lordy, we sure is rich now. That's ridiculous! Why can't I go in? I'm entitled to at least see what my own child looks like. You control yourself. You'll be seeing it for a long time. I'd like to apologize about its not being a boy. Oh, hush your mouth. Who wants a boy? Boys aren't any use. Don't you think I'm proof of that? Have a drink of sherry. Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she? She sure is. You ever see a prettier one? Miss Scarlett was mighty near that pretty when she come, but not quite. Have another glass. Mammy? What's that rustling noise I hear? Lordy, that ain't nothing but my red silk petticoat you done give me. Nothing but your petticoat? I don't believe it. Pull up your skirt. Mr. Rhett, you is bad. Yea, Lordy! You sure took a long enough time about wearing it. Yes, sir. Too long. No more mule in horse's harness? Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad telling you about that. You ain't holding that against old Mammy, is you? I don't hold it against you. I just wanted to know. Have another glass. Here, take the whole bottle. Dr. Meade says you can go in now, Captain Butler. This sure is a happy day to me. I done diapered three generations of this family's girls. And it sure is a happy day. Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days are when babies come. I wish... Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful. What do you suppose they'll name her? Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl... ...she was going to name it Eugenia Victoria. Yes, she's a beautiful baby. The most beautiful baby ever. Yes... Do you know that this is your birthday? That you're a week old today? Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony, the likes of which... ...this town has never seen. Yes, I'm going to send her to the best schools in Charleston. Yes, and her will be received by the best families in the South. And when it comes time for her to marry... ...well, she'll be a little princess. Certainly making a fool of yourself. Why shouldn't I? She's the first person who's ever completely belonged to me. Great balls of fire! I had the baby, didn't I? It's Melanie. May I come in? - Come in. Yes, come in and look at my daughter's beautiful blue eyes. Most babies have blue eyes when they're born. Don't tell him anything. He knows everything about babies. Nevertheless, her eyes are blue and they'll stay blue. As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag. That's it. That's what we'll call her. ""Bonnie Blue Butler. "" Try again, Mammy. Twenty inches. Twenty inches. I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty. You simply gotta make it 181/2 again. You done had a baby. And you ain't never gonna be no 181/2 inches again. There ain't nothing to do about it. There is something to do about it. I'm just not going to get old and fat before my time. I just won't have any more babies. I heard Mr. Rhett say that he'd be wanting a son next year. Tell Captain Butler I decided not to go out. I'll have supper in my room. I got your message. I'll have them bring my supper up here too. No objections to that, I hope? No. Yes. Uh... I mean, I don't care where you have your supper. Rhett... Yes? - You see... Well, I've decided... Well, I hope I don't have any more children. My pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born... ...it's immaterial to me whether you have one child or 20. No, but you know what I... Do you know what I mean? I do. And do you know I can divorce you for this? You're low enough to think of that. If you had any chivalry in you, or were nice... Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't have any more children and he... You've been to the lumber office this afternoon. What has that got to do with it? Quite the little gentleman, Ashley. Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler. It's no use. You wouldn't understand. - You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett. - Sorry for me? Yes, sorry for you because you throw away happiness with both hands... ...and reach out for something that'll never make you happy. I don't know what you're talking about. If you were free and Melly were dead and you had your precious Ashley... ...do you think you'd be happy? You'd never know him, never even understand his mind... ...any more than you understand anything, except money. Never mind about that. I want... You may keep your sanctity. It'll work no hardship on me. You don't care? The world is full of many things and people... ...and I shan't be lonely. I will find comfort elsewhere. Well, that's fine. But I warn you, in case you change your mind, I intend to lock my door. Why bother? If I wanted to come in, no lock could keep me out. I knew most women were cheats... ...hypocritical and hard, but this one... - It ain't no use. - What do you mean? I mean you're poisoned with her. I don't care what she's done to you. You're still in love with her. - It pleasures me none to say it. - Maybe so, but I'm through with her. You've gotta think of the child. Child's worth 10 of the mother. You're a shrewd woman, Belle. And a very nice one. Yes, Rhett? I was just thinking of the difference between you and... You're both hardheaded businesswomen, and successful. But you've got a heart, Belle. And you're honest. Goodbye, Rhett. Goodbye, Belle. She'll be a wonderful horsewoman. Look at those hands. And that seat! Oh, fiddle-dee-dee! Why we have to wheel a baby when we have servants... - Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether. Captain Butler. Good morning, Scarlett. Making fools of ourselves in front of these buffaloes. If you'd thought of your position, you wouldn't have to. But as it is, we're going to cultivate every female dragon of the Old Guard... - Good morning, Mrs. Whiting. Captain Butler. Good morning, Scarlett. So the millionaire speculator is turning respectable. Money can't buy what I want for Bonnie. I'll admit I've been at fault too. Bonnie will have a place among decent people. Even if we both have to crawl on our bellies to every fat old cat... Good morning, Mrs. Meade. Good morning, Captain Butler. Good morning, Scarlett. Mrs. Merriwether, I have great regard for your knowledge. - Could you give me some advice? - Why, certainly. My Bonnie sucks her thumb. I can't stop her. You should make her stop! It'll ruin the shape of her mouth. I know, I know. She has such a beautiful mouth too. - I tried putting soap on her nails. Soap? Bah! Put quinine on her thumb and she'll stop sucking it quick enough. Quinine! I never would have thought of it. I can't thank you enough. You've taken a great load off my mind. Good morning. Good morning, Dolly. Wasn't that Captain Butler? Good morning, Caroline. I was just thinking... ...there's a great deal of good in a man who would love a child so much. But of course there is. Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler finally admitted... ...that he was honored for his services at the Battle of Franklin. No, and did I tell you that Captain Butler made... ...a stupendous contribution to the Association for the Beautification... ...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead? - No! My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard, is giving a party for Bonnie next week. Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was my idea to give a party for Bonnie. Why, Caroline Meade, how can you say a thing like that? Watch Daddy put your pony over it, Bonnie. Now, watch! Daddy, let me! Let me! All right, darling. Put her on, Pork. Up we go! Oh, there! Lordy mercy! There he goes again. Grip tightly with your legs. Lean forward and go with him. Hold your reins properly in a firm hand. Up! That was fine. I knew you'd do it. When you're older, I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia. You'll be the best horsewoman in the South. Give your daddy a kiss. Mr. Rhett? Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett! Did you see her? Wasn't she wonderful? Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you... ...it just ain't fittin' for a girl to ride astraddle with her dress flying up. All right. I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle. And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit. She'll love that. A nice black broadcloth is what little girls wear. Oh, now, Mammy, be reasonable. Well, I don't think it's fittin', but... It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'. It ain't fittin'. Why, Scarlett, what are you doing downtown at this time of day? Well, Ashley, I just... Why aren't you helping Melly with my surprise birthday party? Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that. Melly'd be so disappointed if you weren't surprised. I won't let on. I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta. As long as you're here, let me show you the books... ...so you can see how bad a businessman I am. Don't let's fool with any books today. When I'm wearing a new bonnet... ...all the figures I ever knew go right out of my head. Figures are well lost when the bonnet's as pretty as that. Scarlett, you know, you get prettier all the time. You haven't changed a bit since our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks... ...where you sat under a tree surrounded by dozens of beaus. That girl doesn't exist anymore. Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley. Nothing. Yes, we've traveled a long road since the old days, haven't we? Oh, the lazy days... ...the warm, still, country twilight... ...the high, soft Negro laughter from the quarters... ...the golden warmth and security of those days. Don't look back, Ashley. Don't look back. It drags at your heart till... ...you can't do anything but look back. I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear. I never want you to be anything but completely happy. Oh, Ashley! - Who is it? Only your husband. Come in. Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary? You're not ready for Melanie's party. I've got a headache, Rhett. You go without me and make my excuses to Melanie. What a white-livered little coward you are! Get up! You're going to that party and you'll have to hurry. - Has India dared...? - Yes, India has. - Everyone in town knows the story. - Kill them for spreading lies. I don't kill people who tell the truth. No time to argue. I won't go! I can't go until this misunderstanding clears up. You won't cheat Melly out of publicly ordering you out of her house. There was nothing wrong. India hates me so. I can't go. If you don't show your face tonight, you'll never be able to again. I don't care, but you won't ruin Bonnie's chances. You're going to that party, for her sake. Get dressed. Wear that. Nothing modest or matronly will do for this occasion. And put on plenty of rouge. I want you to look your part tonight. For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny - Good night, Scarlett. - But, Rhett... You're going into the arena alone. The lions are hungry. Don't leave me. Don't. You're not afraid? What a lovely dress, darling. India wasn't able to come. Will you be an angel? I do need you to help me receive my guests. Mrs. Meade... ...here's our darling Scarlett. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Why, Scarlett. - Good evening. Ashley, aren't you going to get our Scarlett a glass of punch? Did you have a good time at Miss Melly's party? Yes. Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word. If Captain Butler asks for me when he comes back, I'm asleep. Yes'm. Come in, Mrs. Butler. Come here. Sit down. No reason you shouldn't have a nightcap, even if I am here. I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise... You heard nothing of the kind. You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here. - You must need a drink badly. - I do not. Take it. Don't give yourself airs. I know you drink on the quiet, and I know how much you drink. Do you think I care if you like your brandy? - You're drunk and I'm going to bed. - I'm very drunk... ...and I intend getting still drunker before the evening's over. But you're not going to bed. Not yet. Sit down. So she stood by you, did she? How's it feel to have the woman you've wronged cloak your sins? You're wondering if she knows all about you and Ashley. You're wondering if she did it just to save face. You're thinking she's a fool for doing it, even if it saved your hide... - I will not listen. - Yes, you'll listen. Miss Melly's a fool, but not the kind you think. She has too much honor to conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves. And she loves you. Though just why she does, I'm sure I don't know. If you weren't so drunk and insulting, I could explain everything. - As it is, though... - You get out of that chair once more... Of course, the comic figure in all this is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes. Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to his wife... ...and won't be unfaithful to her technically. - Why doesn't he make up his mind? - Rhett, you... Observe my hands, my dear. I could tear you to pieces with them. And I'd do it if it'd take Ashley out of your mind forever. But it wouldn't. So I'll remove him from your mind forever, this way. I'll put my hands so. One on each side of your head. And I'll smash your skull between them like a walnut. And that'll block him out. Take your hands off me, you drunken fool! You know, I've always admired your spirit, my dear. Never more than now, when you're cornered. I'm not cornered. You'll never corner me or frighten me. You've lived in dirt so long, you can't understand anything else. You're jealous of something you can't understand. Good night. Jealous, am I? Yes, I suppose I am. Even though I know you've been faithful to me all along. How do I know? Because I know Ashley Wilkes and his honorable breed. They're gentlemen. That's more than I can say for you or for me. We're not gentlemen. And we have no honor, have we? It's not that easy, Scarlett. You turn me out while you chase Ashley, while you dream of Ashley. This is one night you're not turning me out. How are you feeling this morning? Well, this misery in my back... ...ain't so good. You act mighty happy this morning. I am, Mammy. I am. Oh, she wept with delight When he gave her a smile And trembled with fear at his frown Hello. I, um... I'd like to extend my apology for my conduct of last night. Oh, but, Rhett. I was very drunk... ...and quite swept off my feet by your charms. You needn't bother to apologize. Nothing you do surprises me. I've been thinking, and I believe it would be better for both of us... ...if we admitted we made a mistake and got a divorce. - A divorce? - Yes. There's no point in holding on to each other. I'll provide for you. You've plenty of grounds. Just give me Bonnie, and you can say what you please. Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce. You'd disgrace it if Ashley were free. Makes my head spin to think how quickly you'd divorce me. Wouldn't you? Answer me. Wouldn't you? Please go now and leave me alone. I'm going. That's what I came to tell you. I'm going on a very extended trip to London. - And I'm leaving today. - Oh. I'm taking Bonnie with me. Please get her duds packed right away. You'll never take my child out of this house. She's my child too. You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here... ...with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation. You're a fine one to talk. You think I'll let her out when you'll have her around people like Belle? If you were a man, I'd break your neck for that. I'll thank you to shut your mouth. As for you giving yourself airs about motherhood... ...a cat's a better mother than you are. Have her things packed for me in an hour, or I warn you... ...I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely. Excuse me, Mr. Rhett. - Hello, Uncle Rhett. - Hello, Beau. Daddy, where have you been? I've been waiting for you all morning. I've been hunting for a rabbit skin to wrap my little Bonnie in. Give your best sweetheart a kiss. Bonnie, I'm going to take you on a long trip to fairyland. Where? Where? I'll show you the Tower of London, where the little princes were... ...and London Bridge. London Bridge? Will it be falling down? Well, it will if you want it to, darling. Daddy, dark! Dark! Bonnie! Bonnie! It's all right, Bonnie. Who put out that light? Nurse! Daddy, dark! Yes, yes, yes... What's the matter with my Bonnie? A bear! Oh, a bear? A big bear? Dreadful big! And he sat on my chest! I'll stay here and shoot him if he comes back. Oh, good evening, Mr. Butler. I told you never to leave this child alone in the dark. Children are often afraid of the dark, but they get over it. Let her scream for a night... Let her scream? Either you're a fool or an inhuman woman. If you want her to grow up cowardly... Cowardly? There isn't a cowardly bone in her body. You're discharged. As you say, sir. Where's Mother? Bonnie... Aren't you happy here in London with me? I wanna go home. Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler! Miss Scarlett! Hello, Mammy! Honey child! Miss Scarlett, they's back. They's back! Bonnie! Bonnie, baby. Darling baby! You glad to be home? Daddy gave me a kitten. But London's a horrid place. Where's my pony? I wanna go out and see my pony. You go out and see your pony. Where's my pony? I want to go out and see my pony. You run along with Mammy. Come on, honey child. Mammy sure missed you, honey. Mrs. Butler, I believe. Mammy said you'd come back. Only to bring Bonnie. Apparently any mother, even a bad one, is better than none. You mean you're going away again? What perception, Mrs. Butler. Right away. - In fact, I left my bags at the station. - Oh. You're looking pale. Is there a shortage of rouge? Or can this wanness mean you've been missing me? If I'm pale, it's your fault. Not because I've been missing you, but because... Pray continue, Mrs. Butler. It's because I'm going to have a baby. Indeed. And who's the happy father? You know it's yours. I don't want it any more than you do. No woman would want the child of a cad like you. I wish it were anybody's child but yours! Well, cheer up. Maybe you'll have an accident. Is she better? Has she asked for me? Don't you understand? She's delirious. Rhett... I want Rhett! What's the matter, honey? Did you call somebody, child? It's no use. It's no use! Dr. Meade's left. - Scarlett's dead. - Oh, no, she's much better. Really she is. There, there, Captain Butler, you're beside yourself. She'll very soon be well again. I promise you. She never wanted this baby. Not want a baby? Why, every woman wants a baby. You do, but she doesn't. Not my children. She told me she didn't want any more. I wanted to hurt her because she'd hurt me. And I did. You mustn't tell me these things. It's not fair to... I didn't know about this baby until she fell. If I'd only known, I'd have come straight home. Well, of course you would. And then when she told me there on the steps, what did I do? What did I say? I laughed and I said... But you didn't mean it. I know you didn't mean it. But I did mean it. I was crazy with jealousy. She's never cared for me. I tried to make her care, but I couldn't. You're so wrong. Scarlett loves you a great deal. Much more than she knows. If that were true, I'd wait forever. If she'd only forgive me. She will. You must be patient. No, it's not possible. If you only knew who she really loved... You wouldn't believe it. Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip. No, Captain Butler. I wouldn't believe it. There, there. Scarlett's going to get well, and there can be other babies. She couldn't even if she wanted to. But of course she could! I'm going to. No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it. It's too dangerous. Children are life renewing itself, Captain Butler. And when life does that, danger seems very unimportant. I've never before known anyone who was really brave. I pray God things go well with you, Miss Melly. And I want to thank you for all you've done for me and for Scarlett. From my heart, I thank you. Miss Scarlett's feeling a heap better today, Mr. Rhett. Thank you, Mammy. I've come to ask your forgiveness... ...hoping our life together has another chance. Our life together? When did we ever have a life together? Yes, you're right. But I'm sure if we could only try again, we could be happy. What is there to make us happy now? Well, there's Bonnie... ...and I love you, Scarlett. When did you discover that? I've always loved you, but you've never given me a chance to show it. And just what do you want me to do? To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett. We'll go away. We'll take Bonnie and have another honeymoon. Give up the mill? It's making more money than ever. I know, but we don't need it. Sell it. Or give it to Ashley. Melanie's been such a friend to us. Melanie! If you'd only think more about me! I am thinking of you. And I'm thinking that, well... ...maybe the mill's taking you away from me and Bonnie. I know what you're thinking. Don't bring Bonnie into it. - You're taking her away from me. - But she loves you. You've made her love you and not me. She's so spoiled now, that... Mommy, Daddy! Watch me. We're watching, darling. You're mighty pretty, precious. So are you. I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy. I don't think you ought to do much jumping yet. You just learned to ride sidesaddle. I will so jump. I can jump better than ever, because I've grown. I moved the bar higher. Don't let her do it, Rhett. No, Bonnie, you can't. If you fall off, don't cry and blame me! Rhett, stop her. Bonnie! She's just like Pa. Just like Pa...! Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Lordy, Miss Melly. I sure is glad you's come. Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem the same without Bonnie. How's Miss Scarlett bearing up? Miss Melly, this here's done broke her heart. I didn't fetch you on Miss Scarlett's account. What that child got to stand, the good Lord give her strength to stand. It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about. He done lost his mind these last couple of days. Oh, no, Mammy, no. I ain't never seen no man, black or white, set such store on any child. When Dr. Meade say her neck broke... ...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run out and shoot that poor pony. And for a minute, I think he gonna shoot hisself. Oh, poor Captain Butler. Miss Scarlett called him a murderer for teaching that child to jump. She said, ""You give me my baby what you killed. "" And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie. It like to turn my blood cold, the things they say to one another. Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more. And then that night... ...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself in the nursery with Miss Bonnie. He wouldn't open the door when Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered. And that's where he's been for two whole days. Oh, Mammy! This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted through the door and said: ""The funeral's set for tomorrow. "" He says, ""You try that, and I kills you tomorrow. Do you think I's gonna put my child in the dark when she's so scared of it?"" Oh, Mammy, Mammy! - He has lost his mind! - Yes'm, that's the God's truth. He ain't gonna let us bury that child. You gotta help us. Oh, but I can't intrude. If you can't help us, who can? Mr. Rhett always set great store by your opinion. Please, Miss Melly. I'll do what I can, Mammy. Get away from that door and leave us alone. It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler. Please let me in. I've come to see Bonnie. Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett in this hour of his grief. Mammy... I want you to make a good deal of strong coffee... ...and bring it up to Captain Butler. I'll go and see Miss Scarlett. But... Captain Butler's willing for the funeral to take place tomorrow morning. Hallelujah! I expect the angels fights on your side, Miss Melly. Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Miss Melly. Miss Melly. Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy. And try... Try to get me home. Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Where is my mother going away to? And why can't I go along, please? We can't always go along, Beau, as much as we may want to. You're going back to bed now. Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying. She can't be. She hasn't your strength. She's never had any. - She's never had anything but heart. - You knew that too? Why do I have to go back to bed? It's morning. It isn't really morning yet. You may come in now, Scarlett. Dr. Meade, please let me see her. I've been waiting here two days. I've got to tell her that I was wrong about something. She knows you were wrong. She wants to see Scarlett. Miss Melly's going to die in peace. Don't ease your conscience... ...telling her things that make no difference now. You understand? It's me, Melly. Promise me? Anything. Look after my little son. I gave him to you once before. Remember? The day he was born. Please, Melly, don't talk this way. I know you'll get well. Promise me... college. Yes, and Europe, and a pony. Whatever he wants, but... ...oh, Melly, do try. Ashley... Ashley and you... What about Ashley, Melly? Look after him for me... ...just as you looked after me... ...for him. I will, Melly. Look after him... ...but never let him know. Good night. Promise? What else, Melly? Captain Butler. - Be kind to him. - Rhett? He loves you so. Yes, Melly. Goodbye. You ladies may come in now. Rhett... Ashley! I don't know where the mate to this is. She must've put it away. Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened! I'm so frightened! Scarlett, what can I do? I can't live without her. I can't! Everything I ever had is going with her. Oh, Ashley... You really love her, don't you? She's the only dream I ever had that didn't die in the face of reality. Dreams. Always dreams with you. Never common sense. Scarlett, if you knew what I've gone through! Ashley, you should've told me years ago that you loved her and not me. And not left me dangling with your talk of honor. But you had to wait till now, now when Melly's dying... ...to show me that I could never mean any more to you... ...than this Watling woman does to Rhett. And I've loved something that doesn't really exist. But somehow... ...I don't care. Somehow, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter one bit. Oh, Ashley... Ashley, forgive me. Don't cry. She mustn't see you've been crying. Ashley! Melly! Melly! Rhett! Rhett! Rhett, where are you? Rhett, wait for me! Rhett! Come in. Rhett... Melanie, she's...? Well, God rest her. She was the only completely kind person I ever knew. A great lady. A very great lady. So she's dead. That makes it nice for you, doesn't it? How can you say such a thing? You know how I loved her, really. No, I don't know that I do. It's to your credit that you could appreciate her. Of course I appreciated her. She thought of everybody except herself. - Why, her last words were about you. - What did she say? She said, ""Be kind to Captain Butler... ...he loves you so. "" Did she say anything else? She said... She asked me to look after Ashley too. It's convenient to have the first wife's permission, isn't it? What do you mean? What are you doing? I'm leaving you, my dear. All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true. Oh, no! No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong. I don't want a divorce. Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight, when I knew I loved you... ...I ran home to tell you. Oh, darling, darling! Please don't go on with this. Leave us some dignity out of our marriage. Spare us this last. This last? Do listen to me! I must have loved you for years, only... ...I was such a fool, I didn't know it. Please believe me. You must care. Melly said you did. I believe you. And what about Ashley Wilkes? I never really loved Ashley. You certainly gave a good imitation of it, up to this morning. No, Scarlett. I've tried everything. If you'd met me halfway, even when I came back from London. I was so glad to see you. I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty. Then when you were sick, and it was all my fault. I hoped that you'd call for me. But you didn't. I wanted you. I wanted you desperately... ...but I didn't think you wanted me. It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it? But it's no use now. As long as there was Bonnie, there was a chance we might be happy. I liked to think that Bonnie was you, a little girl again. Before the war and poverty had done things to you. She was so like you. And I could pet her and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you. But when she went, she took everything. Rhett, please don't say that. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for everything. My darling, you're such a child. You think that by saying, ""I'm sorry,"" all the past can be corrected. Here, take my handkerchief. Never, in any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief. Rhett! Rhett, where are you going? I'm going to Charleston, back where I belong. Please. Please take me with you. No. I'm through with everything here. I want peace. I want to see if somewhere... ...there isn't something left in life of charm and grace. - You know what I'm talking about? - No! - I only know that I love you! - That's your misfortune. Oh, Rhett! Rhett! Rhett! Rhett! Rhett! If you go, where shall I go? What shall I do? Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. I can't let him go. I can't! There must be some way to bring him back. Oh, I can't think about this now. I'll go crazy if I do. I'll think about it tomorrow. But I must think about it! I must think about it. What is there to do? What is there that matters? You mean to tell me, Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything? Land's the only thing that matters. It's the only thing that lasts. Something you love more than me, though you may not know it. Tara. It's this from which you get your strength, the red earth of Tara. Land's the only thing that matters. The only thing that lasts. Something you love more than me, though you may not know it. From which you get your strength. Tara. Land's the only thing that matters. Something you love more. The red earth of Tara. Tara! Tara! Tara! Tara! Home. I'll go home. And I'll think of some way to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another day! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Slave in the Magic Mirror, come from the farthest space.

I like it here. Ooh, it's dark inside. Guess there's no one home. Hello? May I come in? Shh! Oh! What a cute little chair! Why, there's seven little chairs! Must be seven little children.

My, my, my! What a pile of dirty dishes! And just look at that broom! Why, they've never swept this room. You'd think their mother would... Maybe they have no mother. Then they're orphans. That's too bad. I know! We'll clean the house and surprise them. Then maybe they'll let me stay. Now, you wash the dishes. You tidy up the room. You clean the fireplace. And I will use the broom. Just whistle while you work And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place So hum a merry tune It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace And as you sweep the room Imagine that the broom Is someone that you love and soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune Oh, no, no, no, no!

You want to get us all killed? - What's that? - That's it. - Sounded close. - It's in this room right now. - It's up there. - Yeah. In the bedroom. One of us has gotta go down and chase it up. Up. Down. Here, take it. Don't be nervous. Don't be afraid. We're right behind you. Yes! Right behind ya. Here it comes! - It's after us. - Don't let it out. Hold it shut. - Here it comes. - Now's our chance. Get it now! - Quick! - Give it to it! Don't let it get away! Hold on there. It's only Dopey. - Did you see it? - How big is it? - Was it a dragon? - Has it got horns? - Was it breathing fire? - Was it droolin'? What was it doin'? He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds! - Let's attack. - While it's sleeping. Yeah, while it's sleeping. - Hurry, men. It's now or never! - Off with its head. - Break its bones. - Chop it to pieces. We'll kill it dead. - Jiminy Crickets! - Gosh! - Gee! - What a monster! It covers three beds. Let's kill it before it wakes up. - Which end do we kill? - Shh! Shh! Well, eh, ah... - What is it? - Why, it... It's a girl! She's mighty purdy. She's beautiful, just like a angel. Angel, hah! She's a female! And all females is poison! They're full of wicked wiles. What are wicked wiles? I don't know. But I'm agin 'em. Shh! Not so loud. You'll wake her up. Aw, let her wake up! She don't belong here nohow. - Look out. - She's movin'. - She's wakin' up. - What'll we do? Hide. Oh, dear. I wonder if the children are... Oh! Why, why, you're little men! How do you do? - I said, how do you do? - How do you do what? Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad! Now, don't tell me who you are. Let me guess. I know, you're Doc. Why, why, why, yes. Yes! That's true. And you're, you're Bashful. Oh, gosh! And you, you're Sleepy. How'd you guess? And you? And you're Sneezy. - Yes, and you must be... - Happy, ma'am. That's me. And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

Pick up the soap Now don't try to bluff Work up a lather And when you got enough Get your hands full of water and you snort and you snuff and go... You douse and you souse Rub and you scrub You sputter and splash all over the tub You may be cold and wet when you're done But you gotta admit it's good and clean fun So splash all you like 'Tain't any trick As soon as you're through You'll feel mighty slick Bunch of old nanny goats. Ya make me sick going... Hah! Next thing ya know she'll be tyin' your beards up in pink ribbons and smellin' ya up with that stuff called ""perfoom. "" Hah! A fine bunch of water lilies you turned out to be. I'd like to see anybody make me wash if I didn't wanna. Get him! Hey, let go of me! Get him over to the tub. Get him over to the tub. Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose! Get him up on the tub. Get him up! Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him! Get him up on the tub! On the tub. That's the tub. That's the tub. Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited! Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get... Get the soap! Hey, steady, men. - We'll get him there. We'll get him. Never say die. Never say die. You don't...

He sure is cute! You'll pay dearly for this! Supper! - Supper! Food. Hooray! Hah! Magic Mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all? Over the seven jeweled hills beyond the seventh fall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs dwells Snow White, fairest one of all. Snow White lies dead in the forest. The Huntsman has brought me proof. Behold her heart. Snow White still lives, the fairest in the land. 'Tis the heart of a pig you hold in your hand. The heart of a pig! Then I've been tricked! The heart of a pig! The blundering fool! I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage in a disguise so complete no one will ever suspect. Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness, change my queenly raiment to a peddler's cloak. Mummy Dust to make me old. To shroud my clothes, the black of night. To age my voice, an old hag's cackle. To whiten my hair, a scream of fright. A blast of wind to fan my hate! A thunderbolt To mix it well. Now, begin thy magic spell. Look! My hands! My voice! My voice. A perfect disguise. And now... A special sort of death for one so fair. What shall it be? Ah! A poisoned apple! Sleeping Death. I'd like to dance and tap my feet But they won't keep in rhythm You see, I washed 'em both today and I can't do nothin' with 'em Ho-hum, the tune is dumb The words don't mean a thing Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing? I... Oh, gosh! I chased a polecat up a tree Way out upon a limb And when he got the best of me I got the worst of him Ho-hum, the tune is dumb The words don't mean a thing Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing? Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch... Watch... Watch... Thanks. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hooray! That was fun! Now you do something. Well, what shall I do? - Tell us a story. Yes, tell us a story. - A true story. - A love story. Well, once there was a princess. Was the princess you? - And she fell in love. - Was it hard to do? Oh, it was very easy. Anyone could see that the Prince was charming. The only one for me. Was he strong and handsome? Was he big and tall? There's nobody like him anywhere at all. Did he say he loved ya? Did he steal a kiss? He was so romantic I could not resist Some day my prince will come Some day we'll meet again And away to his castle we'll go To be happy forever I know Hah! Mush! Some day when spring is here We'll find our love anew And the birds will sing And wedding bells will ring Some day when my dreams Come true Oh, my goodness! It's past bedtime. Go right upstairs to bed. Wait! Hold on there, men! The, uh, Princess will sleep in our beds upstairs. But where will you sleep? Oh, we'll be quite comfortable down here in... in... In a pig's eye!

Amen. Oh, yes! And please make Grumpy like me. Hah! Women! A fine kettle of fish! Dip the apple in the brew. Let the Sleeping Death seep through! Look! On the skin! The symbol of what lies within. Now, turn red to tempt Snow White. To make her hunger for a bite. Have a bite? It's not for you. It's for Snow White. When she breaks the tender peel to taste the apple in my hand, her breath will still, her blood congeal. Then I'll be fairest in the land! But wait! There may be an antidote. Nothing must be overlooked. Oh, here it is! ""Love's First Kiss. "" Bah! No fear of that. The dwarfs will think she's dead. She'll be buried alive! Buried alive! Thirsty? Have a drink! Now, don't forget, my dear. The... The old Queen's a sly one, full of witchcraft. So beware of strangers. Don't worry. I'll be all right. See you tonight. Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.

Pies made from apples like these. - Oh, they do look delicious. - Yes! But wait 'til you taste one, dearie. Like to try one? Hmm? Go on. Go on, have a bite. Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away! Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady. Oh, I thought I'd lost it. There, there. I'm sorry. Oh! My heart! Oh, my... My poor heart. Take me into the house and let me rest. A drink of water, please. Heigh-ho, heigh-ho Heigh-ho, heigh-ho It's off to work we go Heigh-ho, heigh-ho Hey, look! - Stop that! - Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo! Go on! Get outta here! What ails these crazy birds?

Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Gentlemen, the war is over at last. The men are coming back. The living are coming back. We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers. Idle men. Men badly in need of work, Mr. President. Gentlemen, we have the country to save fiirst. But these men have saved their country. Now the country must save them. Their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry... by furnishing suddenly a greater supply oflabor than for which there could be a demand. Mr. President. Mr. Colfax. I have read an editorial in the Terra Haute Express... written by Mr.John Soule, in which he says, ''Go west, young man.'' Where there is room for all. Gentlemen, our land stretches from an Eastern sea to a Western sea. Surely, in that vast territory, there is a place for men to live and work and be happy. Right, Mr. President. True, Mr. President. I hope to attract our disbanded soldiers to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges... and to the wealth that lies in the soil itself. And to the grasslands of the Great Plains. The fields of Illinois, the broken sod of Kansas, the long furrows of the West. Yes, Mr. President, but if only the frontier could be made safe for the plow. It must be made safe. But during the war hostile Indians massacred our settlers there. - Mr. Lincoln? - Yes, Mary? We'll be late for the theater. Gentlemen, I promised to take Mrs. Lincoln to Ford's Theater tonight. We will continue this tomorrow... for the frontier must be made safe. Good night, Mr. President. Good night. Good night, Mr. President. I have never seen him looking so well. But the war is over, and we have on our hands order after order... canceled by the government. Hundreds of thousands of rifles unsold. Once we were the saviors of our country. Now we're outcasts. Our money invested in an unsalable product. But a good product, gentlemen. A new repeating rifle would have made short work of the war... had it been introduced earlier. But now the subject of guns is an unpopular topic... to those who needed them so badly a short while ago. We'll have to look to Providence for a market. Providence? Where? I've been told that the Indians hunt with bow and arrow. Still, they obtain furs, valuable buffalo hides, otter, fox and beaver. With our new repeating rifle-- Dearie me. Why shouldn't we be frank? I have every reason to believe the Indians will pay $1 00 for each rifle. A hundred dollars? In furs. And a dollar a piece for every cartridge. But we can't sell rifles to the Indians! I think we can... to peaceable Indians. But how-- For hunting. They furnish us with furs. We supply them with rifles. Really quite simple. Won't they use those guns against white men? We'll get the Indians to promise not to do so. I'm against this! But why? It's bound to make trouble on the frontier. President Lincoln says-- We have a perfect right to do it. Sheer nonsense.! The army would stop us. They control trade with the Indians. They did, my friend. But Indian affairs have been taken out of the hands of the army... and given to a civilian authority. A civilian authority? Yep, in which we are to have a certain participation. Do I make myself clear? Perfectly. But who sells the rifles? Ask Mr. Lattimer to come in. Perhaps not the most personable gentleman... but certainly the man for our needs. Gentlemen, this is Mr.John Lattimer, How do you do? who will distribute our rifles through St. Louis... to Hays City and all the Great Plains. Right, Mr. Lattimer? I said I'd do it. Van Ellyn, if ever Mr. Lincoln finds out-- It's a legitimate business. The Ford Theater.! Open that window! Lincoln shot at Ford's Theater.! The president is dying.! Hear that? Someone has shot the president. They say he's dying. Only yesterday afternoon I was talking to him at the Capitol. Maybe it isn't true. We must learn the facts. A terrible thing, Mr. Lattimer. Yes, a national calamity. You will leave at once for St. Louis. Dearie me. Terrible thing. Oh, there he is. - Excuse me, soldier! - Bull's-eye! I didn't see ya. That's all right, son. Come here and let me see your gun. You haven't got any notches on it. What'd I kill? Don't you see that great big buffalo laying there kickin'? Yeah. He's a big one, ain't he? Give me your knife, and we'll skin 'im. You better not. You might find out he's been eating potatoes. Gee, whillikens. I'll bet you could kill a buffalo with this knife. You can't kill a buffalo with a knife. Aw. I'll bet Buffalo Bill could. You know what I saw him do once? What? First give me back my Arkansas toothpick. You give me back my gun. I saw Buffalo Bill shoot at a whole herd of them once. At first I thought he'd missed. Then two of them started coughing and fell down dead. He'd killed 'em both and raised a big cloud of dust a mile and a half the other side of them. And that isn't all. That little cloud of dust he raised grew into a whirlwind, turned itself into a cyclone and wiped out one-fourth ofTexas... before they could stop it. Jimminies! That's the kind of shootin' I aim to do. That whistle's just a half a minute wrong. Listen. Don't that beat all. Cute, isn't it? Say, you're dressed like a scout there. So's your sister. That's not my sister. That's CalamityJane. Was she your best girl? Son, one of these days you're gonna grow up, and you ought to know about women. You see, the thing is this, women are, uh-- Well, they're, um-- Well, son-- I can tell you what an Indian will do to ya, but you never know what a woman will do. Why? Well-- Let's go down and take a look at that fire engine. If you don't like her, what do you carry her picture around for? It's the only good picture of me I ever had taken. I can't cut her off without cutting off my chin. John Lattimer, 1 7. I see a good mark. John Lattimer, 1 8. Wait. I see an easy mark. Where? John Lattimer, 1 9. Oh, yes. Hello, Virginia! I'll be around shortly. We hate to say good-bye. When you comin' back? When you come and see me. I want you to take Hannibal. He sings. Oh, Will, look. I see a good fighting man who's been fool enough to get himself married. Ow! What's the matter? Oh, my hats! Jiggers! Let's duck. Here. Hold on, bub. Come back here. Hey, who do you think you're-- Bill! You long-legged, fugacious old gallinipper! What are you doin' here? Well, I, uh-- Here's somebody who wants an introduction to you. Boy, you wouldn't know him in these tinhorn garments, but this is the best scout west of the Mississippi. Shake hands with Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill! Howdy, youngster. Son, this fellow taught me all I ever knew about scoutin'. Ah! You mustered out yet, Bill? Yesterday. Ya ain't losin' much time gettin' up the Big Muddy. He seems to have met a friend. Yes, a rather strange friend. How long have you been out? Oh, about three months. I see she hasn't cut your hair... yet. I don't know what you mean, Bill. You know what happened to Samson when Delilah opened her barbershop. Has she tamed you yet? That ain't fair. She's different. You're different. Bill, she's the finest little gal-- I know, I know. You gotta meet her. No, Bill. Women and me don't agree. All that's goin; get aboard.! Come on! You'll like her. All that's goin', get aboard! Don't be nervous. He'll be here. Come, Will! Hurry.! All right, Lou. I want you to meet the best friend-- We haven't time. We must get on the boat. All that's goin; get aboard.! Bye, Buffalo Bill! Bye! Bye, Louisa.! Good-bye! Honey, we're on our way. You're not frightened, are ya? I'm not frightened of anything after these three wonderful months. It's a big place we're going to-- the West-- isn't it? Good-bye, Buffalo Bill! Huh? What's the matter, boy? Good-bye, bub. That's yours. Gee! Thanks, mister! Don't forget what I told ya about women. And here's your gun. Good hunting! I'm Jack McCall, Mr. Hickok. Tickled to death to be traveling with you. Pleased to meet you. Hey, your toothpick's on fire. This ain't a toothpick. ''Cigareetes,'' they call them back East. Oh, I see. A new fad, huh? Hmm? Barkeep, bring me an applejack, will ya? Yes, sir. You want one? No. I call ya. I have ace, king, queen, jack and a ten. Sorry, mister. Mr. Hickok. I'd like to speak to you. Good evening, ma'am. I'm Louisa Cody. Will's told me how long you've been friends... and how you fought for him once. He says you don't trust women. Not as a rule, Mrs. Cody. But in your case-- Mr. Hickok, I'm going to help Will. Don't you believe I can? Well, I don't know, ma'am. I'll open. He killed his first Indian at 1 2. But he's not-- At 1 4, he was riding Pony Express. He's one of the best natural scouts on the frontier. Will's promised to give up scouting and killing Indians... and all that nonsense. The West is in his blood. You can't change that. But you've been away from it so long. It is changing, and why shouldn't Will change with it? We're going to start a little hotel. Cody? Yes. Someday you may be one of our neighbors with a wife of your own. Excuse me, ma'am, but the hotel keeper seems to be in trouble... with his neighbors right now. I'll bet you $20. Hello, Bill. Don't play that hand. - Why not? - Maybe you can trust one woman-- authorities differ-- but three? Not on your life. Your wife wants to talk to you. She's outside. Well, if you don't mind, gentlemen. It's all right. How much money did you lose? About $48. I'll sit in for you. Any objections, gentlemen? No, no objections at all. We've got new blood in the game. Heinie. Yes, sir? Take the gentlemen's order. Take the order all around. Rye for me. Applejack, please. Rye. No, thank you. Ante. Cut. Heinie? Yes, sir. Bring me something cool. Yes, sir. Well, I'll bet you $50. I'll see that and raise you 1 00. On that watch? Yes, it's a mighty fine watch. Plays a tune whenever you press that little spring. See? It ain't worth $1 50. It is to me. I'll redeem that watch anytime for a thousand. All right, I'll take your word on it, and I'll up ya 300. And I'll call ya. They're all blue, mister. Watch yourself. What's the matter? I'm calling the hand that's in your hat. Take it off!. Take a look, Mr.Jayhawker. The name is Hickok. Hickok? Not Wild Bill Hickok? Mr. Hickok to you. I'm calling this hand. And I'm taking this pot. Maybe I ought to shoot a couple of holes through your ears, so we'll know you. Men like you ought to be marked. Maybe he'll do it too. Wouldn't be no trick at all for Bill. He's my friend. He can hit a dime at 30 paces. Four times out of five. Five times out of five. He killed the whole McDaniels gang. And he got 'em alone too. Does he kill like that? Ain't a corpse maker like him, honey. Cash these in, Mr. Banker. It's a pleasure, Mr. Hickok. Maybe I ought to take Mr. Cody's losings too. He's got a wife to support. Whoa there! Lizzie's two hours late. Hustle your passengers off. I'll pick the best of them for you, Calamity. My horses ain't used to waitin'. Back up there,Joe! Mark three! Look out! Don't foul that hauser there! Hey, there.! Leavenworth landing! All for Leavenworth get off. Hey! Aboard there! Purser! Watch the line. My name's John Lattimer. You got a bunch of freight for me put aboard at St. Louis? Yeah, lots of it consigned to Hays City. I got my own wagons here! I want that stuff shouldered off first up! Right away! Hey, Tim! Hustle that shipment forJohn Lattimer off. Come on, boys! Get goin'! Hi, Calamity. Hi, yourself. Keepin' company tonight? Yeah, me and my six horses. Seven's a lucky number. Count me in. You sailors are all alike. Hey, Bill! Help me pack this outfit ashore. Jumping Jehoshaphat! What is this? Feathers? Hats. ''Hats''? Lou, Bill will take you off to the stage. I got to go see about the trunks. This going to be the hotel orchestra, ma'am? Bill, we're not joking about that hotel. I guess a hotel suits you after all. Start with a birdcage and expand, huh? Lattimer, six. Come on, boys.! Get along here.! Lattimer, seven. Lattimer, eight. Keep 'em on your backs there. I'm sorry, boss. Powerful heavy to tote. - Shut your lip! John Lattimer, nine. Hey! Take this box! Yes, sir! Get out, you! John Lattimer, ten. Lattimer, 1 1, goin'to Hays City. Don't that look like-- Farming tools. You operate out of Hays City? Sure! What of it? Didn't have any use for farming tools the last time I was there. I freight whatever they send me, and I mind my own business. John Lattimer, 1 5. That's a right good idea, a right, good way to keep out of trouble. John Lattimer, 1 6. Bill! You mangy old coyote! Ha! John Lattimer, 1 8. Bill, you're back. Aw, you four-flushing mule. You ain't wipin' it off. You're rubbing it in. Are you gonna stay in Leavenworth? Are you? I could. I'm going on to Hays City. Why didn't you write me any letters, Bill? I didn't know you could read. I could read if you could write. A woman who has a fellow at every stage station... and a beau in every cavalry troop west of the Missouri-- That woman doesn't need any letters from me. Those fellers didn't mean nothin' to me. They did to me. Let's forget it. Maybe I did make a mistake. You won't get a chance to make that mistake again. Bill! You'll have to excuse me. I'm keeping a lady waiting. I'm awfully sorry to have put you to so much trouble, Mr. Hickok. That's all right. I don't know what could have happened to Will. This is the Hays City stage, ma'am. I'll fetch Will and the rest of the outfit. Thank you. Is that chipmunk yours? Did ya bring her with ya? What if I did? It's none of your business. Ain't it, after you run out on me? You slab-sided, bird-totin' rat! You brung that honky-tonk mopsy-- Shut up, Calamity. Tip your hat when you speak to a lady. I will, when I speak to a lady. Aw, Bill. Careful, Lou. That's a big step. Look out for Hannibal. Will, isn't it exciting? Have you got everything? I've got you and the parasol and Hannibal... and boxes and hats and-- Hi, Calamity! Well, Bill Cody! What are you doin' in them buzzard feathers? Pretty fancy, huh? Calamity, I want to introduce you. Lou, this is CalamityJane. Everybody knows her. Born and bred out yonder. A dead shot, rides better than a man, drives stage. Why, I've seen her flick the rattles off a rattle-- Say, is she your mopsy? She's Mrs. Cody. Your wife! Aw. I'm certainly glad to know ya, Mrs. Cody. How do you do, Miss Calamity? Canary's the name, ma'am. I beg your pardon. I didn't know. Not at all, ma'am. Four passengers for Hays City, Calamity. Get going. Suits me. You'll find the backseat easy ridin', Mrs. Cody. Thank you. Come on, Bill. Get in. That's no way to treat your passengers. You ain't a passenger. You're freight. My name's Jack McCall. I'm goin' to Hays City. What are you smokin'? Chalk? Cigareete. Well, get in anyway. Another one for Hays City, ma'am. That river clipper's sayin' good-bye to you, ma'am. Now you're gonna have three long days of this prairie clipper. But tomorrow's Sunday. Do we ride on Sunday? There's no Sunday west ofJunction City, no law west of Hays City and no God west of Carson City. Hold tight, ma'am. I'm holding tight. Still travelin' together, Mr. Hickok, huh? What are you doin' up here? I'm drivin'. Get! Get up there! Get up there! You've been driving for three days. You've changed horses 1 4 times. Don't you ever change those beads you're wearing? I ain't wearin' 'em 'cause you give 'em to me. I'm wearin' 'em 'cause I like beads. Oh, Will, are all the roads in Kansas like this? No, honey! Some of'em are pretty bad. What's the matter? Clem? Take these ribbons. Yeah? Stranger, I wonder if you could-- Breezy! Why, it's Bill Hickok. I thought you was off to the war. The war's over. Yeah? Just beginning where I come from. There's 2,000 or 3,000 Sioux Indians cayoodlin' around Fort Piney with war paint on. Wild Bill Hickok to see General Custer. I'll see him. Yes, sir. How do you do, General? Oh, hello, Hickok. I heard you were coming to town. I know of your reputation as a killer, and I want to warn you... that we'll tolerate no lawlessness here at Hays City. You better get that word through to the Indians, because they've just wiped out half the garrison at Fort Piney. - How do you know? - I was about to report to you... before you became so interested in my accomplishments... that we've been pulling arrows out of Colonel Carrington's old scout. Breezy? Yes. Colonel Carrington told him if you didn't get ammunition to Fort Piney, they're done for. Find Captain Reed! Yes, sir. I'll get that ammunition to Fort Piney somehow. But I can't spare more than one troop to take it. Here at Hays City, I'm faced by Satanta's Kiowas. The whole Sioux nation's up here. And now Yellow Hand's on the loose with his Cheyenne. I can't move from Hays City until I find out where that he-wolf s heading for. He's an old friend of mine. We used to hunt buffalo together on the Cimarron. He's hunting men now, and I've got to locate him. Maybe I can find him for ya. He ought to be just about... there. Hmph. Oh, Captain Reed. Yes, sir. Hickok reports that half of Carrington's command at Fort Piney's been wiped out. I'm sending 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition. Have Captain Woods prepare to leave at once with a wagon train. Mules are right handy animals, General. What? They can get by the Indians much better than wagons can. Yes, he's right. Use mules. They'll have to get by about a thousand Cheyenne. Why not send them east of the trail through Deep Valley? Yes, and across the upper ford of the Republican, but who's going to guide them? I haven't got a scout who knows that territory. I beg your pardon, but Buffalo Bill Cody just got in town. Cody? Yes, he knows the lay of that land. And he's up to all Indian tricks. He's got himself a squaw. You'll probably find him knitting or washing dishes. What do you mean? He's married a ravishing little woman from points East. I don't care if he married an Eskimo. Tell him to come here. His mind's set on starting a hotel. There's an Indian war starting. Women lying on these plains with Indian arrows in them. Get Cody here. - Suppose I go in his place? - You're going after Yellow Hand. Don't let him catch you. He doesn't treat his prisoners very well. Tell Cody that ammunition train is leaving before sundown. Yes, sir. And he'll be leaving with them. Orderly. Oh, Will, there's so much dirt blowing in. It's got to blow someplace, honey. Tumbleweed, Lou. They won't bite ya. Oh, dear! There's no use fightin' the wind, Lou. We have to bear with this land. Oh, I know, Will. When are we going to move into town and take over the hotel? I'm gonna see Jeb Masters tomorrow. He wants to sell the Golden Rule House. Here's your grub! Why, come in, Miss Canary. Hiya, Bill. What'd you bring? Well, I'll tell ya. I got something to fry, and I got something to boil. And a jug of whiskey! Oh! He never misses, Mrs. Cody. I'll take that. You've got a lot to do. That stove smokes, and there's no mattress on the bed. You haven't got the lamps filled yet. Look at this place. This is a grand shebang. Oh, Calamity. You could stable the queen of Sheba. How can you say that? It's so dusty, and I haven't got my curtains hung yet. We'll help ya. Hey, you long-legged two-spot, give your wife a hand. And here's the bodkin. Hey! Put it in that window. Say! Look it. That would make a pretty dress, wouldn't it? Calamity, do you ever wear dresses? I might if I had one. You're going to look awfully nice in one of mine. That curtain looks right pretty. Bodkin Bill. Have you had any experience with a horse blanket? Plenty. Lou says I've had too much. That's too bad. There's a horse outside waitin' for ya now. You tryin' to trade, Bill? Yes. A hotel for the lives of 48 men... and 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition thrown in. How do you do, Mr. Hickok? You and the bird feel at home yet, ma'am? Won't you sit down? Thank you. Is Custer sending that ammunition to Fort Piney? He's hoping they'll get through... if 48 cavalrymen can dodge about 1 ,000 Cheyenne. Birds do not eat beans, Mr. Hickok. You think those swatties can make it? Depends which way Custer sends 'em. Through Deep Valley. Through the upper ford of the Republican. Yeah. They might get through that way. They would get through if Bill Cody showed them how. There's no trail. Better no trail if they're dodging Cheyenne. Will's not going. He has nothing to do with the army now. He's promised. That's just what I told Custer. What did you tell him? That you wouldn't go. You know that's a lie. Mr. Hickok, Will promised me. You don't understand. I can't let him go. There are things that have to be done, ma'am. Lincoln set a goal that we have to work toward. He said the frontier must be made safe. Oh, but Lincoln's dead. What right have the dead to tell the living what to do? His words are alive. Bill Cody knows that as well as I do. If he refuses to go, you'll think he's a coward, and you know he's not. The choice is his, ma'am. Will, I was afraid of this. You can't leave me. You can't-- You've never seen the Indian tribes at war. You've never seen men killed and mutilated and bodies of women burned... and babies dragged from their mother's arms and dashed against-- That's enough, Bill! Why is it you aren't going, Mr. Hickok? I have to pay a call on an old friend. You're goin' after Yellow Hand. Bill, you're goin' out alone! You cold decker, ain't you got no sense? Maybe I can get you another string of beads. Ya ornery coot! Good-bye, my darling. Oh, Will, please-- I've got to go, dear. I know every foot of the way. I have to do my part. Here. I'll look out for you, Mrs. Cody. He'll be back in a few days. He'll be back with nary a scratch on him. Will! Will! Come back! Don't cry, honey. I wanted to tell him something. What? Maybe if he'd known, he wouldn't have gone. Oh. Well, maybe it's just as well you didn't tell him. What is this, Louisy? Cat? It's sort of a Russian cat. Say. Look at that. I don't know how I look, but I feel like the queen of Sheba. You look lovely, Calamity. I want you to keep that dress. Ya do? Say, that's the first time a woman ever gave me anything. Why, I never even seen clothes like these. Now, if I just had me a hat! Here, try one of these. Oh, say, ain't that a pretty one. Well, how do you do, Miss Canary? Hmph. Hmph. Appears to me your face is kind of made out of rubber. That old coyote's got a toad in his gullet. Couldn't be an Indian, could it? Honey, when you hear something yelling at night, it's just some varmint. But when you don't hear nothin', it's an Injun. Calamity, I want you to stay here with me. I've never been alone before. Now, stop worryin' about him, honey. He's got a whole troop of cavalry ridin' herd on him. But my Bill plays it alone, the big mule. I bet if he could see me in this outfit, it'd be my weddin' dress. I'd just as leave die with my boots on, but I ain't a-gonna to get married in 'em. Can I have some shoes? Louisy, don't look at the windows. Don't let on anything's different. Listen to me. Can you ride? Yes. My horse is outside. Take that coffeepot back to the stove. Then open that door and wait. Make believe you're helping me with my glove. I'm gonna entertain visitors. They're Injuns. Injuns! Shut up. When you see them all in here, sneak to the horse. Ride to town. Don't stop for nothin'. Tell 'em there's Injuns here with war paint on. Make me some fresh coffee, honey. Come in, fellows. Come on in. Don't be afraid. I-- I got something for ya. Look. I got some presents for ya. See? See the pretty feather? Sure. Sure. It's a hat. See? Here. Here, put it on. Come on. I'll show you. Go look at the pretty feather, you painted buzzard. Here. Here, look. Pretty? You don't like it, huh? Well, here. Take this. I got something for all of ya. Presents for all of you. We've been savin' 'em. Look. Presents for my brothers, the Cheyenne, you red hyenas. Here. Look. See? Look. Here. Come on in. Look. See? Here. Come on. Don't be afraid. Look. For papoose. See? Papoose. Uh, want a piece of cake? Soldier. ''Soldier''? Me no talk Cheyenne. I'll never tell ya where they've gone, ya hairless coyote! Hello there! Hey! Bill.! You get outta here.! Go back, Bill! These are Yellow Hand's men.! You're crazy.! Shoot your way out, Bill! You'll get a tomahawk in your brains if you keep askin' for it. Indians will sell anything. They might sell you. Wild Bill Hickok, walkin' into the hands of a war party. Custer sure picked himself a great scout. Aw, Bill, not your watch. What's he saying, Bill? He wants my guns too. Don't give 'em to him. Don't give up your guns! What's he saying? He says he's got to take us to Yellow Hand first. He can't let us go unless Yellow Hand's willing. Well, you done it, didn't ya? Yes, I ''done it,'' all right. How do you do, Mr. Hickok? You sure must remember me. How do you like me in dresses? Thought you were Mrs. Cody at first, in that dress. Oh. Mrs. Cody give it to me. Were you in Cody's cabin when they caught ya? Yeah, celebrating on account of Bill Cody's kid. Bill Cody hasn't got a kid. He's gonna have one. He doesn't know it, does he? He would if he stayed home where he belongs. I'll tell him... maybe. Say, Bill, you give up your watch... and your guns. Couldn't have been on account of me, could it? No. I wanted him to take me to Yellow Hand, so I can find out what he's up to. Oh. What do you think they'll do to us? We'll soon find out. You Hickok. I know you. Speak your own language, Yellow Hand. I'll understand you. You, me, speak white man tongue. I must know you know what I say. Remember what I told you last time we met? I said one of us will lift the other's scalp. Which one? It looks like it's up to you to say. What started you on the warpath, Yellow Hand? Where sun rise, white man's land. Where sun set, Indian land. White man come, take our land. Kill buffalo, our food. White man promise us food. White man lie. Now Cheyenne buy white man's thunder stick. Soon war drums sound in all Indian land. All tribes ride with Yellow Hand. We drive white man, like buffalo, away, back to rising sun. Yellow Hand has spoken. Yellow Hand has spoken. And you may be right. But you can't drive the white man away. Yellow Hand know. White man send bullet. Many, many bullet. Where? Somebody's romancing Yellow Hand. You tell where. I don't know. You tell where! He's your friend, Bill. Why don't you tell him they're heading east toward Leavenworth? Yes, that's right. To Leavenworth. - Now I know soldier take bullet. - They won't fit your guns. Hickok, my friend, speak with straight tongue. Hickok, white man friend, speak with forked tongue. Now, you tell, which way soldier take bullet? Bill, what's in that watch? Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it. I couldn't get it out without scratching the case. You've been actin' like you didn't care, and all the time-- Tie up that tongue of yours. Look at their faces. Let her go. She doesn't know anything. You too quick to say she not know. Hickok will not tell, but Yellow Hand will know. Now is hour of Great Bear rising. When moon in sky here, Yellow Hand will know. What's he talking about the moon for? What does he mean? What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about John Lattimer's farming tools... that came up on the boat. Oh, rifles. Better rifles than we have. Seven shot repeaters, and each shot may mean the life of a white man. But what do you think they're fixin' to do to us? I think maybe you gave them an idea what to do. Hear them drums? That's taps for us, ain't it, Bill? Won't be so hard, goin' out together. It'll be harder than you know. Calamity, there are only two of us. Two lives against all those men on the ammunition train. But I don't want to die! I don't want you to die! Hang onto yourself. You'll have to help me. Just like you did the first time I saw you, remember? I was just a kid and no more sense than I got now, headin' down the grade with no brakes on. I loved you then, Bill, just like I do now. Looks like that moon's gettin' ready to show. You never even gave me a picture, but you kept mine. I know you care for me a little. Couldn't you say it just once? Maybe they'll let us go after all. Bill Hickok! You ornery son of a mule! You wouldn't give a bad dime to a sick kid, would ya? You may be right, Calamity. No, I ain't. I know it. I ain't worth a bad dime. Bill-- Bill, every night I talk to ya. Wantin' ya. I know you feel the same. Won't you tell me? What difference would that make now? If only I could hear ya say it once. It would give me somethin' to keep... like it was kind of holy, like I could keep it forever. Calamity-- Yellow Hand find out now which way soldier go. Bill. Yes, Calamity, I do. I-- I love you. You wait. Yellow Hand no want to kill Hickok... but must know which way soldier go with bullet. When he know,you go free. Hickok go free. Don't talk to him, Calamity! Don't trust him! Bill.! Bill! If you no tell which way soldier go with bullet, Hickok soon be dead. Bill Cody's with that ammunition train! Forty-eight men are there, Calamity! Oh, Bill! I can't! You tell? No. Which way? Oh, no! No! Don't! Don't let them do it! Don't! Please! Don't! Oh! Which way? Don't forget Cody-- And all those men! Remember what I told you! They're burning him! They're killing him! Put out the fire! Put out the fire! Oh.! Put out the fire! Which way soldier go with bullet? Deep Valley through the upper ford. Squaw no lie. Yellow Hand no lie. You free. Go. I couldn't help it, Bill. Won't you look at me? I hope I'll never have to look at you again. Look out, Bill! Look out! Thing ain't right here, Captain Wood. See anything? No, but I feel it. Things ain't right here. We can halt over there while you take a look around. They're caught, like rats in a trap. They're all around us, on both sides of the river! - We'll hold this island! Throw your horses! Get those ammunition packs off. Get them out of the line of fire! I can't see nothin' to shoot at but smoke. Where are they? They'll never get out now. I gotta go down there. You ain't goin' down there. Get behind this tree and wait. You've got to reach General Custer. I'll get there, somehow. Head down Prairie Dog Creek. Get a fresh mount tomorrow from the Pony Express at Simpson's. And if Custer finds out you told Yellow Hand, he'll give you the firing squad. He won't find out. I'm gonna tell him. Tell him you brought a thousand Cheyenne against his 48 men! Set up that barricade with those saddles! Those saddles on those barricades, and hurry! Don't go too deep with that hole or you'll get that ammunition in water! All right, sir. Burned through the legs. It feels like it broke the bone. Your knife, Bill. Give me that scabbard for the splint. Watch 'em, men! They may rush us! Never saw such rifle-fire from Indians! They haven't let up for a minute. There's either a million of'em, or they're using those new repeating rifles. Look out! They're firin' powerful fast. It ain't like what we had at Gettysburg. Were you at Gettysburg? I was on the other side in that. Then you must've been-- - Stop talkin', you two! - Get down there! Aim well and fire slowly. Hold your fire, men! That's a white man! Cover him, McGinnis! Cover him! What would a white man be doin' out there? Holy mackerel! He hasn't got a chance! He's still ridin'. Drop some of them Injuns back of him! That fellow must have nine lives! He'll need every one of'em. They got him! No, they haven't! Come on, Bill.! Run for it.! Keep those long legs goin'! Hi, Bill. Sufferin' cats! Wild Bill! I'll tell the captain you're here. Tell him I expect to be here for a long time. Hi, Bill. You guidin' for Yellow Hand? Where's your feathers? Captain Wood, Wild Bill Hickok. Touch 'em up in those trees. Range about 200 yards! Hickok? Wild Bill Hickok? Yes, sir. He just dropped in from Yellow Hand. Wha-- I thought Custer sent you to locate Yellow Hand. I located him, didn't I? Him and a few Cheyenne. You sure did a good job. I notice you're using his equipment. You'll notice it's better than yours too. Where did you get that mark on your wrist? Bracelet? Ha. Squaw bracelet. Takin' Bill Hickok prisoner just don't sound right to me. No? What about Bill Cody following his nose into a Cheyenne ambush? Hmm. Looky here. These Injuns were waitin' for us. They knew we was comin' to this ford. You didn't tell 'em, Bill? Then who did tell 'em? I said, who did tell 'em? I've something more important than that to tell you. You're gonna be a father. Huh? A daddy. Well, but, uh-- How did you know? Mrs. Cody told Calamity. Calamity told me. Well, somebody mighta told me. Well, uh... the news didn't leak out till after we left. Oh, well then how-- Where did you see Calamity? Oh, uh... around. Has she got rawhide marks on her wrist too? What's your guess it'll be, a boy or a girl? It's bound to be one or the other, isn't it? That's customary. From what I've seen of you lately, my guess is a girl. Girls are all right. If it's a boy, I suppose he'll be a bellboy in that hotel of yours. If it's a girl, we'll keep her out of Yellow Hand's camp. Oh! Hey, Bill. Hey, soldier. Wait till I knock the tail feathers off of that turkey. Help me over to the wagon with him. They got Buffalo Bill, Captain. Keep down or they'll get you. Where's the doctor, Captain? They got him in the first volley. Bandages are in the box there. Here's a fresh one. Sort of parted your hair, Bill. Flesh wound. Looks like that little stranger's gonna have a papa. Never mind that. We got plenty of water in the river. Hickok. Yes, sir? It's gonna be a siege. Days of it. After dark, I'll call for volunteers to try to get back to General Custer. I've already sent word to Custer. Who'd you send? Who'd you send? - CalamityJane. Calamity? Wha-- She oughta get through. She'd better get through. There you are. I oughta have you stood up and shot. Why don't you? If I had the authority to do it, I'd like nothing better, but I haven't. I can't make you pay for what you've done. You won't have to. Ten hut.! Captain Wood. Lieutenant Burke. Sergeant Higgins. Corporal Brannigan. Here today and gone tomorrow. - Bugler Corry. - Here, but not for long. Seven days you been calling that roll. Tomorrow there won't be anyone left to answer it. Then I'll answer 'em all myself. Private Adams. Anderson. Here, and I wish I wasn't. I wish I had two more like you. Bingham. Six nights I've been listenin' to the wild talk of the wounded. 'Tis a sad lullaby. Bronson. Yo. What's left of me. Cody. - Here. - He's up in his hotel. Coleman. Still here. -Three days now since the mule meat went bad. - It's six, I tell ya! Why tell the Indians? They know about it. Keep quiet, you baboons! Seven. Do you think you're the only one hearin' Rankin in sick bay... talkin'half the time about that hole through his lung and the rest about his kid? He's so scared he can't count. It's six nights. This paper says they're expectin' trouble with the Indians. Huh? - No? - Dalrymple? Here, and hungry. Try chewin' saddle leather. That'll ease your stomach. Aw. Daniels. Dowden. Yo. Easton. Evans. Hickok. No hits. - They're savin' him for a hangin'. - Houston. Yo. Hadley. Hillman. What are you makin' that for? Holliston. Sure, and all the Indians won't be makin' no headstone for me. Jenkins. Seven days you been doin' this. They don't answer anymore. He's roll calling the dead! It's six days! What difference does it make? ''What difference does it make''? Makes a difference to Gillon, Harry Ketcham and Bailey. Ray Todd must think it makes a difference where he lies out there. They might be alive! Alive! Easy, son. Easy. They might be. You never can tell what'll happen. I knew a fellow lived on the Kaw River by the bridge. He used to feed a fish, a big catfish, by hand. - What's that got to do with it? - Now wait a minute. That catfish got to followin' that fellow out of water for his dinner. Every day he'd follow him more. And one night when the man was walkin'home across the bridge, not noticin'the catfiish was followin'him. Now that fiish had never seen a bridge before. He fell off... and he drowned. - Ah, fish can't drown. - That must've been a narrow bridge. Holy thunder.! Look at them Injuns.! Every man up this way! Hurry, men, hurry! - Get the wounded out to load the guns! - Don't shoot till I give the command. - Hand me up another rifle. - Keep your heads down if you wanna keep them on. Look like buffalo, don't they? A volley'll stop buffalo. Volley fire. Ready! Not yet. But, Bill! Hold your fire, men. Wait for the command. - They're riding us down! - Don't wait.! Let 'em have it.! Not yet! Now! Fire! Load faster.! Gimme that.! I'm doing the best I can. Fire at the center! Split that charge! Fire! - Who was that? - Keep your barrels red hot! Fire at will, men! This one's mine! - We've turned 'em! - Now they're goin' down both sides! Houston!Jack! Cover the left flank! Where are you going, you idiot? Hey, Bill, come back here! Are you crazy? - Hey, Dave, help me cover him. - Cover the right flank! Load your guns, men! Load your guns! Remember, you're still in the army. Gimme some water. I gotta have water. What's the matter? Can't you hear me? Load your guns.! - What's the use? We can't stand another charge. - We may have to. No.! We can't. The dead can't fiight anymore. Why don't you call roll now? You're afraid? I'll call it for you. Private Dowden.! - You load your guns! - Corporal Brannigan. Load your guns.! Why don't you tell Brannigan to load his gun? - I'm telling you.! Get up.! - I won't! Save that fighting for the Indians! You'll see. Hold onto yourself, fella. There's nobody left. You'll see. Why don't you tell your bugler to sound assembly? Stop blubbering and reload your gun! He can't answer. Look at him.! Look at him.! Saints above. He's answering to his name. Yes, it's the dead calling. - Stop it, men! Stop it. Listen. It's Bugler Corry. He's sounding the charge! Come on, men, it's a charge! No, you fools! No! What are you waiting for? The dead want us. McGinnis, hold 'em back. Fall in men! - It's the charge. Don't ya hear it? - Yes, I hear it. Come on, follow me! The boy's right. It's horses. They're charging. Get ready, men! We'll go down fightin'! Come on.! There they are, over there! You can see 'em! - Holy saints!  They know we're alive. We're okay. Well, Yellow Hand didn't get that ammunition he was hankerin' for. He would have, if Calamity hadn't gotten through to Custer. She did a good job, all right. - She must've told Yellow Hand. - Let her alone. She never was good. Why don't somebody do somethin'about it? Only 1 8 come back out of 48. The Cheyenne must've paid her plenty to tell 'em. Paid this woman in money, but our soldiers paid in blood. What are you gonna do? I'll show you what we're gonna do. Talk's cheap, ya loudmouthed liar. Hey, you. Let me out! All right, you dirty mule-skinner. If you want it-- Ow! If she was a man, we'd know what to do with her. Go ahead, you crossbred rat! If you was a man, you wouldn't be here! Run her out of town! Get some tar.! Tar and feathers is too good for her. That's the way to talk! Get a rail.! Here. Here's a rail. Gimme that hammer. Why don't somebody get behind her and get that whip? - Why don't you? - Get the feathers and tar. There's a rail. What do you want with a rail,Jack? - Bill! - We're gonna run her out of town. Why? You know what she done? She told Indians-- Well, she's a woman, isn't she? Keep out of this, Bill Hickok. And women talk a little too much sometimes. This woman is gonna get what's coming to her. Let's ride her out of town. And men talk a little too much sometimes too! Those men had wives. I know what's on your minds! Yes, there were soldiers killed. I was there. I saw them. Huh? And they were killed with bullets-- bullets from repeating rifles. Who'd sell rifles to Indians? Lincoln said this country's got to be made safe. Those are his words. And I'm on my way to settle this matter with the man who sold those rifles. It wouldn't please me to be the man Bill Hickok's goin' after. Me neither! I knew there was monkey business goin'on. You're right. And there's liable to be bullets flyin' around this way any minute, so I'd advise you to get inside, off the street. Well-- I was goin' home anyway. - I'll go with you,Jack. - I got a long ways to go myself. Lattimer's ''crookeder'' than a rattlesnake. You can't go after him alone. His men-- I started this alone and I'll finish it alone. Why should I stake you to go diggin' for gold? They found gold and plenty of it right there in the Black Hills. That's Sioux country. That don't matter. There's gold there at the grass roots. So, you're goin' on the dodge, desertin' after gold. You know what Custer does to deserters. I know what he'd like to do to you. He just got back and he's boilin' mad about Cheyenne Indians and repeatin' rifles. He can't do nothin'. Let him make his complaint to Washington and he'll find that out! The army's gettin' riled-- The army can't stop me! There's bigger men than the army in this with me. Mr. Lattimer. I'm busy, McCall. I want to do you a big favor, Lattimer. What's on your mind? Hickok's after you. Wild Bill. He says you're the cause of all these Indian massacres. He's comin' in here now. All right. You better get out. You won't forget that I warned you? Get out. Get in there, you three. Maybe I'll have a job for you. Hello, Hickok. That's the name, ain't it? Met you in Leavenworth. Hear you been doin' a little scoutin' for Custer. Did you see anything? Yellow Hand's been farming with your farming tools. You know what this is? Skunk. Yes. I'm not armed, Mr. Hickok. I'm not armed. I'll give you three minutes to fix that. I'll be waiting outside. - I'm just leaving town. - You're not leaving town unless dead men can walk. Come in here, you fellows. Now. I'm gonna stake ya, all three of you. I'm gonna stake you to 50 Double Eagles. I've got a wagon train leaving for the Black Hills tonight. I'm gonna get you away from Custer and safe out of town. That's great, Mr. Lattimer. But first, there's that little job I want you boys to do for me. You're crazy. Lattimer won't fight you fair. You ain't got the sense you was born with. Ah, Bill, don't our love mean nothin' to ya? Our love-- if that's what you want to call it-- all that died back on that island where everything else was dying. No, Bill, no! I'll go get Cody. Maybe he can talk some sense into you, ya big mule! Get off the street. You better take cover for a few minutes. You think you own this town. I'm just walkin' through it. And us fellas can get out of your way, can't we, just like we was dirt? Suit yourself. All right, Mr. Long Hair. You're too durn friendly with Injuns to suit me. You shouldn't have said that, soldier. What are you gonna do about it, ya gun-totin' windbag? Oh, substituting for Lattimer. I can't shoot at that uniform. If you want action, take it off. Yeah, and get a slug while I'm doin' it. Take it off. I'll give you that much time. I never draw on a man who isn't ready. - Bill.! Bill.! Come on, Bill, let's get out of here. Sit here, Bill, out of sight. Close that door, Lou. Easy, Bill. That bullet went clean through, but it's bleedin' bad. Get some water, Lou, quick. And some clean linen. You brought this man to our house; a murderer. Lou! When is this going to stop? When will it ever stop? This killing and killing! Why don't they kill him too? Then you can be next and then me and-- Lou, he's my friend. I didn't mean to bother you, ma'am. I'll be going. Can I take your horse, Bill? You can have everything I've got, Bill, but-- You sit right down again, Mr. Hickok. You can't go bleeding like that, whatever you've done. He's done plenty. Those men were soldiers. He'll have every trooper of the Seventh after him now. Get some towels, Will. I'll be as quick as I can, Mr. Hickok. Thank you, ma'am. Here you are, Lou. There's hot water on the stove. Hold this, Mr. Hickok. I never was a murderer. I never did fight unless put upon. Thou shalt not kill. No ghosts ever come bothering me. It was always the other man or me... in a fair fight. What right have you to judge who is to live or to die? Put away your guns, Mr. Hickok. I can't do that, ma'am, not till I find John Lattimer. Hey,Jake, gimme some more light. Ready, boys? Yeah. Which way, Mr. Lattimer? South, until we get out of town, then we head north. Say, where are them three soldiers we're takin'? They're staying in Hays City, but I'm goin'. Get on your wagon. It's dark enough now, Bill. You oughta head up north. Hide out in the Black Hills. That's bad Indian country, but it'll be safer for you than here. I'm going into town first. You're crazy, Bill! I'd be crazier if I didn't do what I think I ought to. Bill, open up. It's me. Did they hurt you much, Bill? I'm all right. I couldn't come till it got dark. I was scared they'd be watchin' me. I know you don't want to see me, but I gotta tell you somethin', Bill. Custer's ordered you brought in dead or alive. The troopers have combed every hidin' down by the river and they're headin' this way. He's goin'to fiind Lattimer. Lattimer's gone. He pulled out with his wagons. Where? Nobody knows. I'll find him. Of course you will. Someday you're bound to, only don't try to find his trail now. Just try to save yourself from Custer's men. There's no tellin' what they'll do. If Lattimer's pulled out with his wagons, those wagons are loaded. And I know what I've got to do. That's a trooper. Hear his saber? Get in there, Bill, quick. You might set the table for three, Mrs. Cody. Who's there? Courier from General Custer. General Custer's compliments. You're to report to him right away. How do you do, ma'am? Howdy, soldier. Hi. What's up? Custer's been ordered to move against Sitting Bull and the Sioux up in Big Horn country. What does General Custer want Will for? The General doesn't let me in on all his secrets. Come on, get a move on. Go ahead. I'll be right behind you. Grub's ready. Hustle them dishes. I'm cavin' in all over. Light out, Bill. I've got a pack all fixed for you and I brought a horse. Good-bye, ma'am, and thank you for everything. Thanks for the coat, Bill Cody. I'll take good care of it. Take care of what's inside of it, you old bushwhacker. Will, what does General Custer want of you? Bill. Bill, you ain't fit to ride far. Why don't you lay up someplace and take care of that arm? That's what I'll do. I'll need this arm when I find Lattimer. Ah, forget it. You ain't got a chance against Lattimer's men. Hmm. I've got nothing to lose. Nothin' but your life! When you talk like that, I could bounce a rock off n your bean. Why don't you try it next time you see me? When'll that be, Bill? Where? Oh, up around Deadwood someplace. You can never tell. I gotta get out of here too after what I done. Well, I guess this is good-bye, eh, Bill? Where are you going? Oh, up around Deadwood someplace, I guess. I don't give a hoot where I go. You're well-named. A child of calamity. Always gettin' yourself into trouble. Bill-- Bill, I reckon maybe you don't hate me. Do you? Maybe you're just bein' nice to me because you think you won't ever see me again. Sure. Sure, I'll see ya again. This is a big country, and trails cross... sometimes. Thought these Big Horn Mountains was full of Indians. Well, I ain't seen any Indians yet, but I'll swear to Moses there's somethin' followin' us. Git! Want your coat back, Bill? No. I want some grub. Well, how do you like your eggs? I like 'em very much. You got any? No. I got some jerky and a little bacon and a little coffee. You must've been mighty frugal over the last six weeks since you been gone. I haven't any grub left. Well, you're welcome to anything I got, Will. I know that, Bill. Build up a little fire and we'll have coffee. Given up ridin' a horse? Indians got it. Mine too. I see you got holes in your boots. That's from followin' a long-legged man. Me? You. What were you followin' me for? Did you have something you wanted to tell me? I reckon I did. I thought you were off with Custer. Custer sent me to bring you back. Slice up some of that bacon, Bill. Have a piece of jerky. Thanks, Bill. Well, I guess we got a few coffee beans left. Enough for about two cups if we make it weak. How's Lou? I ain't seen her, Bill, for weeks. She went home to St. Louis the day after you left. She wanted to be with her mother when-- And what have you decided to call it? I guess Lou will decide that. Yeah. She's a fine woman, Bill. She fixed my arm, so I can pull a gun as quick with my left as I can with my right. Well, that's fine, Bill. It might come in handy for you. It will. This is a hostile country. If you get some water, we'll get this coffee goin' quick. Can't understand why Custer sent you. He says I'm the only man you wouldn't kill. Seems to me Custer's takin' a whole lot for granted. Well, there it is. I have an order from the United States Army to bring you back. So I gather. Dead or alive. Which way do you aim to do it? Alive. No, Bill. It's too bad they had to send you. I'm sorry. But they did, Bill. Did you hear that? What's that Indian doing with that Seventh Cavalry stuff? That flag's shot to pieces. - Where'd you get that flag? That's an officer's coat, and there's a bullet hole through it. Do you understand him? He says Custer's dead! Wiped out with his whole battalion. He says Yellow Hand's comin' up from the south with his Cheyenne... to join Sitting Bull. He says there'll be no more white man. If the Cheyenne reach Sitting Bull, he's right. Where's the nearest regiment? Merritt. He's moving up to join Crook. You know his line of march? He's coming up through Deadwood. Find him. He says the white man friend is bringing rifles to Sitting Bull. - That's Lattimer. To the new village in the canyon. That's Deadwood. You go for Merritt and tell him to get between Sitting Bull and the Cheyenne. Remember, Bill, you're my prisoner. I'll see ya in Deadwood. We'll settle it there.  - I seen it myself. - One nugget? Yes, sir.! Twenty-three ounces. The biggest nugget I seen in Deadwood yet. Dave, the biggest liar I've seen in Deadwood yet is you. I ain't tryin' to sell you the claim. I'm caught. Now, Calamity, what did you wanna do that for? Drinks ain't free, Dave. If you was a man, Calamity-- I ain't, so plunk down four bits. You're a good barkeep, Calamity, but you're awful ornery. Hello, Calamity. Sherry and egg. Eggs are a dollar apiece. I said egg and sherry. You'll get whiskey and egg. Would you like to try runnin' me out of this town too,Jack? No, Calamity. I don't bear you a bit of hard feeling anymore. Well, that's just fine. 'Cause I bear you a-plenty. Now, say, Calamity. You oughta be makin' up to me. I'm gonna be a big man in this country. You'll have to grow about a foot, won't ya? When I get hold of a pile of money-- which I aim to, and soon-- you'll be treatin'me right. So, you staked a claim? Nah, not me. Those fellas are lookin' for gold in the ground. I aim to find it on top. If it ain't in the ground, where is it? I ain't sayin'!  I ain't sayin'. All I'm sayin' is I'm gonna be a big man in this Black Hills country. Yes, sirree, a big man, like Wild Bill Hickok. Say, whatever become of Bill? I couldn't tell ya. For all I know, he may be dead.  The man that killed him must be ridin' high. The man don't live that could kill him. Though you done your best. You told Lattimer, Bill was looking for him in Hays City. Hickok don't know that, does he? It ain't true. There ain't a word of truth in it. Lucky for you Bill ain't here. You can throw this old outfit away or burn it. I don't think they'll burn. Hey. You like-a the haircut? No, no haircut. Have you seen any freighting or hauling around here? No, no freighting. No hauling. Everybody got a mine. Everybody dig and a-dig. Nobody got-a time for Tony no more. Nobody take a bath no more! Hey, don't you ever put tobacco in that pipe? Smells like an octopus. Hello,Jack. What's that army horse doin' here? There ain't been any soldiers around here in weeks, Mr. Lattimer, but the Fifth Cavalry's comin' in. We'll be gone before they get in. My wagons oughta be here in a few minutes. I need some barberin'. I ain't seen no Indian guide. Give him time. Sitting Bull said he'd send him. Take it easy. Mr. Lattimer. I'm gettin' kinda jumpy about those wagons. I'll buy ya one. That's nice of you, Mr. Lattimer. A drop of rye will set me up just fine. You don't happen to have seen any wagons going through... loaded with farming tools? Now what does anybody want-a with-a farming tools? They got no time to farm. Hey. Why don't you want to get the haircut? Short hair makes the Indians mad, and they're mad enough already. Thank-a you too much. He's-a fine fellow. Bill! Hello, Calamity. Ah, Bill. Gee, you're back. I been watchin' and askin' and nobody's seen ya. Nobody's heard. I haven't been out in what you call society. I had one caller, though. Bill Cody. He found you, then. Say, Bill, you didn't-- No. No, he's all right. I'm meetin' him here. I'm sure glad of that. Wasn't your fault, them three soldiers gettin' killed. Say, Bill. You won't have to move on, will ya? No, I got a hunch this is gonna be my last camp. You're settlin' down? You're gonna stay here? I got a feelin' I'm gonna stay here. Bill, you need a drink. I been thinkin'. The West is gettin' to be a new kind of place. Bill Cody's done the right thing. He's changed. What room is there gonna be for a two-gun plainsman? You're talkin' crazy. You're the best man in this country. I don't know who thinks so. I think so, Bill. If you think Cody done right settlin' down and all, maybe that's what you'd like to do. I mean, have a home and things... and have somebody to cook your meals for ya and-- Doesn't sound so bad. Oh, Bill-- Calamity, now you gotta listen to me. I didn't do nothin', Mr. Hickok. - I didn't do nothin'. - What's he talkin' about? He sneaked and told Lattimer you was lookin' for him back in Hays City. She's lying, Mr. Hickok. She's lying. McCall, a year ago I'd have shot you dead on sight. But now-- Go buy yourself a drink. You're the luckiest rat alive. I'm beginnin' to think Mrs. Cody was right. Who am I to decide whether a man's to live or die? You feelin' all right, Bill? No Injun guide yet,Jake. No? Well, if you don't mind, then I'll go put down a drink. All right. Go ahead, boys. Wet your whistles. Mr. Lattimer. Hickok is in town. Hickok? Where? In the Bella Union. Get the boys back, quick. Hey,Jake! Mr. Lattimer wants you-- Shut up, you fool! Lattimer. Stay in here, Calamity. Oh, Bill. This is the only thing I have worth keeping. If you got a wrong hunch, don't go out there. Don't forget to wind it. You're a mule-headed man, Bill Hickok! Get on your wagons, boys. Just a minute.! I wanna talk to you. Any objections, gentlemen? Where you goin' with the wagons? Goin' out of town. What you got 'em loaded with? Buffalo hides. You can see, can't ya? Your wagons are headed north, Lattimer. You're not selling buffalo hides to Sitting Bull's Indians? Take off the top hides. I wanna see what's under 'em. Jake. NotJake. You. Oh. All right. I don't know what you're lookin' fer, but if you want it, you're gonna get it. Keep your hands off your guns, or there'll be more dead men than this town can afford to bury. You gentlemen also sell farming tools? Get on ahead of me, inside the Bella Union. Wait a minute. Don't you belong to this outfit,Jack? Huh? Oh, no, Mr. Hickok. I just know Mr. Lattimer. You knew Mr. Lattimer,Jack. Better get inside too. Oh, sure. Sure, Mr. Hickok. Whatever you say. - Who was that fella he shot? - Never saw him before. He oughta know better than to pull a gun on Bill Hickok. Cody and the Fifth Cavalry are on their way. Keep an eye out for 'em. The rest of you, keep out!  I'm not going to go in there. Gentlemen, we're gonna stay right here for a while. What'll it be? Name your poison. Jack, how about tending bar? We may be here for quite a long wait. What are we waitin' for? Jake, don't reach for anything but your glass. That goes for the rest of you. Keep your hands away from your guns unless you want... fiive cheap funerals in Deadwood instead of one. We're waiting till General Merritt gets here with the Fifth Cavalry... and takes over Sitting Bull's rifles. Any objection? May be an hour, may be a day. When I have to wait, I believe in entertainment. Furthermore, I'm short of funds. Cards, bartender. Find some fresh ones and some chips. Proceed, gentlemen, over there. You first, if it's all the same to you. I'll take the one without arms. Keep your hands on the table, all of you. You bank. I don't hear no shootin'. It's powerful quiet in there. Wonder what they're doin'. Best way to find out is to-- You keep out of this! Let Bill Hickok play his own hand. That's-a just what he's a-doin'. He's a-playin' cards. Playin' cards? Tony must be crazy. - Let's go in and find out. - No, no. I see him so plain. He's a-sittin'down with his back-a this way. His back? Cut for deal. Looks like we're being played for suckers. Your deal. Any sign of the cavalry yet, Calamity? Not yet, Bill. I hope my prisoner hasn't escaped. General Merritt, if he's done the job he set out to do, do you think the government would be a little lenient with him? Mr. Cody, in matters where its sympathies are concerned, the government has been known to bend a little. - You better not go in there. - Bill, there's an Injun comin' in the door. Hello, Charlie. Come in. - Charlie's a friendly Injun. - Yes, I know Charlie. How many? Gimme two. Three to me. Sit over here, Charlie, where I can keep an eye on you. Charlie took a shot at me once. I was too far away. Too bad you wasn't closer. He got my horse. Charlie'd been the biggest man in the West if he'd have killed you, Hickok. Injuns understand things like that. Kill a big man and that makes you a big man. Killin'you, Hickok, is an honorjust waitin' for somebody. You,Jake? Not me, Bill, not me. I'm facing you. Only way to down a man like you is from the back. Raise ya five. Seein' that and up five. Get your foot off my chair, Calamity. It's bad luck. Don't go against your luck, Bill. Your say,Jake. The soldiers! That means a rope necktie for us! Sit down! We'll play out this hand. - All right. - This game ain't over yet. It's almost over. Calamity, find Cody and General Merritt. Bring 'em here. - Play your hand. - I'm callin'ya, Hickok.! Black aces and eights. Your luck's changed. Three queens. I'm afraid you lose, Hickok. A man's bound to lose, sooner or later. Bill? Bill! Let's get outta here! Those fellas just shot Bill Hickok! Arrest those men! Come on, you. Get up. Where is he? Where's Bill? There's your prisoner, General Merritt. We won't forget what Bill Hickok has done, Cody. We'll remember. All of us will. All of us. That's one kiss you won't wipe off.

My, my, my. - Oh, good afternoon Miss Morrison. - How you do Mrs. Perkins? Nice and pretty all this, isn't it? That one little Mary dancing over there, the one in the blue dress. Cute, isn't she? - Yes. - I was queen of the May once.. Don't look it now, do I? Kip... You mind if I sit here beside you? Oh, of course not Miss Morrison, I'd be very glad. Hardly expected to find you alone on a day like today. No? Well I guess a fellow likes to be alone sometimes. - Where's Barbara? - I don't know. - Somewhere around I guess. - You guess? - You and she haven't quarreled, have you? - Oh, no. No, nothing like that. There's one of those New York singing teachers in town and... she's been having auditions. - Sort of takes up most of her time. - She didn't tell me about it. Yeah, this fellow says that if she went to New York and had her voice trained he could... He could make her an opera star in about seven years. You know, a career, success and all that. - She won't do it. - I think she will. You see, her folks aren't standing in her way. Just me. I wouldn't worry too much about it if I were you Kip. - It'll all work out, you know. - Thank you, Miss Morrison. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Well, here we are. - Oh, it was such a beautiful drive. Oh, you enjoyed it, fine, I'm so glad. - There. - Hello Barbara. - Hello Miss Morrison. - I was wondering where you were. Well I, oh Miss Morrison, this is Mr. Bulliet. - How do you do? - Miss Morrison. I've missed you these last few days. When you coming over to see me? Very soon, I've lots of things to tell you, I may be going to New York. Oh, how exciting. Miss Roberts has an extraordinarily promising voice. We're going to try to make a star out of her. Oh, that is exciting. - You must tell me all about it child. - Later this afternoon? - Yes, I'll be home all day, you stop by. - Thank you. - Good day, Mr. Bulliet... - Yes, good day Miss Morrison. Good day. Who was that? Miss Morrison? Oh, she's a darling, she lives next door to us. Nobody really knows anything about her. Her cupboard is rattling with skeletons, eh? Not really, she's a very sweet, sheltered old lady. Well, I've be leaving Mr. Bulliet. Thanks so much for the drive. That's quite all right my dear, glad to have you. Morning. There you are, I was wondering what had happened to you. I only walked as far as the maypole on the green. You haven't made yourself tired walking all that way? No, no, no. - Of course not. - I'll make you some nice, hot tea. You shouldn't have gone, you know, not today. May day seems almost the same as any other day... - sometimes. - Yes, yes. I'll get the tea.  Do you remember the day...   When we were happy in may?   My dear   Oh   Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart   Though our paths may sever   To life's last faint Ember   Will you remember?  I've heard enough, I don't want to talk about it anymore. But Kip, you don't understand, you just Ben pig-headed. All I know is that I can offer you a home and my love, like keep in comfort., That's not good enough for you, I'm sorry. And I'll be as pig headed as I darn well choose. - I have the right to a career. - Sure, you got a right to a career. And I got a right to a home and wife but that can go hang itself, can't it? All right. Go ahead and have your career. See how far it gets you, I'm through. Well, I'm through too and I never want to see you again. I, I don't want to see you again either, goodbye. Goodbye. Barbara. Oh... I think I'm going to cry, you mind? Oh, there, there, child. It really isn't as terrible as it seems, you know. There... But I was right, wasn't I? I was right. You mean you never want to see him again? No, I never meant that. But I'm right about going to New York, aren't I? Why, I regret it all my life if I didn't. That's what he won't see, why won't he see it? How can he be so selfish? Perhaps it's because he loves you child. - Couldn't love me and talk to me like that. - Oh, I think he could. If losing you meant losing everything else too. Oh, it isn't that. It's just selfishness. He doesn't want me even to have a chance. Can you understand Miss Morrison? I want to try, that's all. I just want the chance to become a famous singer like, like Tetrazzini or Jenny Lind or... or Marcia Mornay. Yes... Yes, I can understand. - But I can understand other things too. - What other things? I've never talked to you about myself, have I child? No I... I never talk to anyone usually, but... I'm going to talk to you about myself now. You see... I was Marcia Mornay. You... Yes... Many, many years ago. I was very young. It's Paris... In the court of Louis Napoleon... Oh Nicolai, I'm beginning to feel nervous. - For no reason. - For every reason, I'm frightened of kings. - Louis Napoleon is an emperor. - Same thing. Not at all, kings descend from kings. Louis Napoleon descended from little corporals, there is a difference. - Oh, you see, I'm still nervous. - You mistrust my judgment? Oh Nicolai. I present my singers at court... when they are fit to be presented at court, neither before or later. You're walking too fast. - It's undignified. - I feel undignified. Getting sticks. Now, what do I do when I'm presented to the emperor? - Curtsy. - Nothing else? - You mistrust my sense of etiquette too? - No Nicolai. Mademoiselle Mornay and monsieur Nazaroff. After hearing you at the opera the other night... we're all impatient to hear you sing again mademoiselle. Mademoiselle Mornay is deeply honored your majesty. Would mademoiselle care to rest herself a few moments... - after her journey from the theater? - Oh, thank you your majesty. Shall we waltz? I do anything wrong? Curtsy was a little stiff, only the empress noticed it. - Oh, I feel much better now, thank you. - Naturally. So that's his latest protegee or is protegee quite the right word? - There is another. - I don't envy her. - I hear he drives his singers unmercifully. - Oh no, not all the time. He can be very human. - What? - Yes? So I hear. You see that gentleman a bubble with gaiety over there? That is Trentini. The great composer? Oh, Nicolai. Sounded almost naive. Now, if Trentini wrote an opera for you, you would become immortal. Oh but, do you think he would write an opera for me? No, not without persuasion. - Mademoiselle Mornay. - See that you sing well. Nous venions de voir Le taurreau, trois garon, trois fillettes...  Sur la pelouse il faisait beau et nous dansions un bolro...   Au son des castagnettes.   Dites-moi matin, Si j'ai bonne mine  Dites-moi, Ce matin, vous me trouvez la taille fine?   Vous me trouvez la taille fine?   Les filles de Cadix aiment assez cela.   Les filles de Cadix aiment assez cela  Les filles de Cadix aiment assez cela.   Et nous dansions un bolro, Un soir c'tait dimanche   Vers nous s'en vint un hidalgo, Cousu d'or, la plume Au chapeau,   Et Le poing sur la hanche:   Si Tu veux, Cet or est  toi   Passez votre chemin, beau sire...   Passez votre chemin, beau sire...   Les filles de Cadix aiment assez cela   Les filles de Cadix aiment assez cela.   Les filles de Cadix aiment assez cela.  Tous ces fiers enfants de la Gaule, allaient sans trve et sans repos  Avec leur fusil sur I'paule, courage Au cur et sac Au dos   La gloire tait leur nourriture Ils taient sans pain, sans souliers  La nuit, ils couchaient sur la dure avec leur sac pour oreiller  Le rgiment de Sambre et Meuse marchait toujours Au cri de Libert  Cherchant la route glorieuse qui I'a conduit  lhimmortalit  Le rgiment de Sambre et Meuse marchait toujours Au cri de Libert  Cherchant la route glorieuse qui I'a conduit  lhimmortalit  Le rgiment de Sambre et Meuse marchait toujours Au cri de Libert  Cherchant la route glorieuse qui I'a conduit  lhimmortalit  Le rgiment de Sambre et Meuse marchait toujours Au cri de Libert  Cherchant la route glorieuse qui I'a conduit  lhimmortalit  If I may pay you a sincere compliment mademoiselle Mornay... you are the first singer I've met in years... that did not open the conversation by asking me to write an opera for her. Thank you very much. You know, I'm afraid I must claim credit for that. It was I who told mademoiselle Mornay you had retired. - You did what? - So Patellli told me. - And who told Patellli? - You mean it's not true? It is not, I haven't the slightest intention of retiring. Oh, a relief. - When did Patellli tell you this? - Oh, let me see, I... I've gone to him to commission an opera for Mlle. Mornay, it must be nearly a week ago. - So you admire Patellli's music, eh? - I think it will live. - So will mine. - Oh longer, far longer sir. But... when genius is hard to approach, one is forced to approach Patellli instead. Quite. - Is he writing this opera? - So he gave Mlle. Mornay to understand. Treacle, he writes treacle. Mlle. Mornay needs a composer to serve that voice, not a ballad scribbler. - Mlle. Mornay, another compliment. - Oh, thank you signore Trentini. You want quality, inspiration... not tum tum tum, tum tum tum. You need a, a Schubert a Mozart a... A Trentini? - You are too kind. - I give honor where honor is due sir. But then, don't give it to Patellli. And deprive mademoiselle of her opera? Other composers write operas beside Patellli. But not by request, for example you, sir. I have not yet been requested. Then on behalf of Mlle. Mornay, may I ask you to write her an opera? I would be honored. Thank you signore. Oh, Nicolai, Nicolai, I'm so happy. Ellen, I'm to have an opera written specially for me by the great Trentini. - Oh mademoiselle, how splendid. - It isn't wonderful? An opera by Trentini. By Trentini... Oh Nicolai, I can never, never thank you. You, you've been so kind, so patient, so... so wonderful, I can hardly believe it's true. Oh, I can't believe it's really true. It... it'll gradually penetrate. Oh, you remember when I met you that day in New York? How you told me if I obeyed you, you'd make me famous. And how I laughed because I didn't believe anyone could. Oh Nicolai, Oh, Nicolai... How could you know then what I was going to become? I was so plain and gawky and I know I croaked when I sang. Marcia... - Come here. - Yes, Nicolai. - Do you realize what tonight means? - Yes, I think so. - Means my share of the work is over. - Oh no, Nicolai... You've worked, you always obeyed me. You've let nothing stand between you and your career, you deserve your success. During all our association, I've never once come into your private life, have I? - No. - I've never demanded anything of you, have I? No, you've been very sweet Nicolai. You've been half afraid I would, haven't you? Now and then I've seen it in your eyes... wondering when the lightning was going to strike. - No Nicolai. - You were right to. After all, I've trained other women and demanded things of them. You knew all about it. I owe all of my success to you, I always will. If there, is any way I can repay you? There is. Poor Marcia, I'm asking a very high price. I want to marry you. - Oh Nicolai... - You've only to say yes or no. I know you don't love me, now... but I love you. Well? Which is it? Oh, I should be very happy to marry you. Oh Ellen, I was worried, it's quite late. Yes, I know. I'll be along in just a few minutes. Ellen is right, you've 3 hours' sleep to make up young lady. Ellen, close the curtains and don't wake mademoiselle till midday tomorrow. - Oui monsieur... - Oh, not as late as that. You're singing tomorrow night. By Jove, it's tonight now. What sort of voice do you think you'll be in? After the alarums and excursions of this evening. I may not wake you till just before the performance. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Dear Nicolai. - Oh Ellen? - Oui mademoiselle? Ellen, I'm going to be married. Why, that's very nice Mlle, I'm sure. May I congratulate you? Thank you. - Aren't you surprised? - No mademoiselle, I rather expected it. - I hope you'll be happy. - Thank you. It's really a tremendous compliment, isn't it? I mean, he's such a great man. Of course, I'm a little confused about everything. So many things have happened at once. Singing for an emperor and having an opera written specially for me and now this. I... I sort of can't make anything seem real. I'd just go to sleep and forget all about it till tomorrow, otherwise you'll be tired. But I'm not the least bit sleepy, I... I feel restless and, and unsettled and... Oh I... I want to do something to bring me back to my senses. - Ellen... - Oui mademoiselle? - Give me a dress. - Whatever for? I'm going out for a ride, just a little ways. I must get some fresh air to make me wake up. - What sort of a dress? - The brown moire. Ah, oui, oui. But mademoiselle, do you think monsieur Nazaroff would approve? Oh, but he needn't know, I only be gone a few minutes. He'd be furious if he finds out. - Oh, you won't tell him Ellen darling. - What happens if he finds out for himself? Oh mademoiselle, there's no sense in what you're doing, it's, it's silly. Yes, I know, I know but I keep telling you, I'm only going a little way. I only be gone 10 minutes at the most. I simply must get away by myself Ellen, just for once in my life. - Driver. - Where to madame? Just keep driving until I tell you to turn around. - Just anywhere? - Yes, just anywhere. It shall be so, giddup Jemmy. - Have you had a quarrel? - What? He'll have cooled down by the time you get back. Oh yes, yes, I hope so. - Oh driver, driver... - Had enough? - Yes, yes. Take me back home please. - It shall be so. Jemmy, Jemmy, come back. Don't worry ma'am, don't worry, don't go away. I'll be back in a minute. Jemmy, come back do you. I'm mad at you, why you do this? Come back, I'll kill you. Jemmy... Plantons la vigne, c'est I'eau qui vient de vigne   Vignons, vignons, vignons, C'est I'eau qui vient de vign' en vin   C'est I'eau qui vient de vigne  De vigne en pousse, la voil la Jolie pousse  Poussi, poussons, poussons Le vin, la voil la Jolie pousse Au vin,   Ia voil la Jolie pousse  C'est I'eau qui vient de bouche en vin c'est I'eau qui vient de bouche.

Come on, sing out about the fat prima Donna. - Commencez la musique. - Allez. Mon ami, Mon ami, see the prima Donna fair   With a line and a line and a woolly mop of hair   Hear the prima Donna sing, la la la All the people think she's fine, la la la   Because they're full of wine   Oh, vive I'Opera, vive I'Opera  Higher. Now a dot and a dot and a bit of this and that  And a curve and a curve for the lady is always fat  Hear the prima Donna sing, pi pi pi, you can bid romance adieu, la la la  She's big enough for two. Oh, vive I'Opera   Vive I'opera...  Higher. With a dash and a dash and some fingers for her arms   With a touch and a touch. Oh, the lady is full of charm  Hear the prima Donna sing, whoo, whoo, she can always please the crowd, la la la   Because she sings so loud   Oh, vive I'Opera, vive I'Opera.  Higher. Mon ami, bien aime, see my little protegee  Iackadee, lackaday, madame must prefer ballet  How madame would skip and prance, la la la, if she ever got the chance, la la la   She'd really rather dance   Oh, vive I'Opera   Vive I'Opera  - Alors, c'etait bien, ma belle Amie? - Oui, magnifique. - Do it again. - Oh, no. - Jumping swordfish, you're American. - Yes. - Yippee. - Please. But don't you realize how wonderful it is? You've been sent from heaven. I've been starved, starved for the sound of one, good, clean, healthy American voice... and then suddenly you come into my life. Not only an American voice, not only an American woman... but a beautiful, adorable, glamorous, glorious, radiant... indescribable vision of perfected loveliness, shake. - Anyone ever tell you all that before? - No, not all at once. Well, then I'll tell you again when I get my breath back. You're the most beautiful... No, don't trouble. I think I can remember it. It's no trouble. Who are you? Where you come from? Will you be in Paris long? May I see you tomorrow? - No. - No. - No, I'm afraid not. - Why not? I'm a prima Donna. - And you don't like prima Donnas. - Nonsense. Why, I adore prima Donnas. Oh, yes? If there's anything I like before and above everything else it's a prima Donna. Any of these fellows will tell you. Hey fellows, don't I adore prima Donnas? Yes. There, you see? Now, may I see you tomorrow? Ecoutez mes amis, it's mademoiselle Marcia Mornay, the singer. Yes, I saw her last night at the opera. Marcia Mornay? Let's have a song. Come on, let's go have a song. Belay, haul off, give the lady air. Where are your manners, you blocks, you stones, you senseless idiots. - But we want a song. - But mademoiselle wants privacy. Back to your old sofas and cheeses, you termites. I saw her first. - The thing is now become intimate. - Thank you. - I'm glad I have a champion. - Mademoiselle, you have an adoring slave... a protector, a worshiper who would give his life for you. The least you can do is to have supper with him. No, I'm awfully ashamed but I'm afraid I'll have to refuse. Give me one good reason why. Well, I've just had supper. I couldn't eat another. I'm crushed, humiliated. Also a little offended. What about a small ration of bacon and two eggs? No. About, one egg? La belle dame sans merci. Will you have supper with me tomorrow night then? - I'm singing at the Opera. - After the opera? Before the opera? Lunch, have lunch with me. You can't shake your head at that too. - I can, I must... - I see, you don't like me, eh? Oh, but I like you very much and I like your voice too. Oh, but really you have a wonderful voice, really but... Well, I, I'll just be awfully busy during the rest of my stay in Paris. I really can't see you again. Oh, just for a few minutes, 3/4 of an hour for lunch tomorrow. I've a real Virginia ham... if you're a true American, you can't look a gift ham in the frill. Oh Noah, lost your ark? - There's my cabby, I really must be going. - I'll see you to your coach. Oh no, please. Please, I'd rather you didn't. You're not going mademoiselle. We can't let her go, can we? No, not without a song, eh? - Then I'm never going to see you again? - No. Will it matter to you if I die of a broken heart? Oh, you won't. I'm in a terrible hurry, good night. Thank you so much for taking such good care of me. Come to lunch tomorrow. - Oh, but I can't, besides I, I... - I'm Paul Allison. And I live on the top floor of this house. I'll expect you for lunch tomorrow and I won't let go of your hand till you say you'll come. Oh well, it won't do any good, quite impossible, I promise you. - Let go of my hand please. - Not till you promise to come to lunch. Virginia ham, promise? Why, I can't. - Please let go. - No. Oh Mr. Allison, I may get into terrible trouble through all this. - Not till you promise. - Oh driver, home please. It shall be so, Jemmy.. Really, really, this has gone far enough now. - Let go of me, please let go. - Not till you promise. - Oh Mr. Allison, get off. - I won't let go till you promise. Let go of my hand. Will you hurt yourself. Do be careful. - Promise? - Yes, yes, yes. I promise, I promise.  I will cook you ham and eggs  -  Fried Virginia ham and eggs  - Hurry, hurry driver. Like we fix them way down south, they will melt right in your mouth  Hey, what's the matter your clatter is too much noise?   Ah, what a vision I'm losing my head, such poise   And tomorrow she's coming to lunch, oh.  Will you be a good fellow and soften that bellow and...   Heavenly ham and scrambled eggs  We know you like ham but get out to the street, tout de suite  -  But I'm hopelessly, madly in love  -  You're in danger of bodily harm  -  Oh, what delicate charm  -  Look out, the gendarme   Friends, are we all for one?   One for all and all for one  You're in a spot, tell us what can we do for you?  It may look a bit funny but I have no money so I need to borrow a franc or two  Before we can lend it, for what will you spend it?   She's coming to lunch  No request was ever harder but we'll help you fill your larder  Just enough for ham and eggs, Virginia ham and eggs  Here's a two, make it two, no, no, make it 3 have a crew   That'll do, that'll do. Oui, oui > What a treat, what a treat for the sweet madame  -  To eat ham...  - Hey... You aroused every gendarme in Paris, scatter, now. ? And eggs? Have you got to shout the roof off every time you come in? Have you seen what the time is? I've known people to have died, who been shouted at when sleeping, ain't it? Where were you all night? I warned you, I am furious. - Archipenko, I've met her at last. - And who if I may ask, who is that her, eh? The loveliest woman in Paris. What? Again? And she's coming to lunch here, tomorrow, Archipenko.  Oh, vive I'Opera  - Mr. Allison, please... -  Oh, vive I'Opera  I ask you. With humility and tears in my eyes, I'm asking you. How do you expect me to train your voice when you come home at this time of the night? - I mean, of the morning. - Night. Morning, the sun is already rising. You bad boy. You, you, you drinking in low haunts. Making fun with strange ladies. Will I ever put you into the opera when you play such, such shnookety gooks. Mit your voice, eh? I ask you, how do you expect me to do it? - How do you expect anyone to do it? - I don't. There you got it, there you are putting your thumbs on it. You, you, you ain't got ambition. You ain't got application. You are fooling about it, ain't it? Honestly Paul Allison, you are breaking my heart. - That's what I am. - Oh, but Archipenko... guess who's coming to lunch. Guess who? Now we're going to play games, eh? - Marcia Mornay. - And another thing I want to... - Hello, please, what was that name? - Marcia Mornay is coming to lunch. - Marcia Mornay... - Yes. The prima Donna from the opera is...  Marcia Mornay is coming to lunch   Marcia Mornay is coming to lunch, Marcia Mornay is coming to lunch   She's coming to lunch  - Had a nice time? - Yes, how much is it? On account of Jem it's discounted. I'll make it 10 francs. Oh I, I seem to have... Well, I'll have to throw the money to you from that window up there. - That'll be all in all ma'am. - Thank you. Oh Ellen... May I ask for an explanation. If there is one? I'm sorry, I've been very foolish, forgive me. - Where have you been? - I went for a drive in a cab. - With whom? - With no one. - With whom? - I'm not lying. That was a very sane and rational thing to do at this time of night, wasn't it? Oh Nicolai, please try to understand. I was excited, overexcited and happy I... I couldn't sleep, I only intended to drive a little way so I could sort of... think things over and calm down. And then there was an accident, the horse broke loose. I had to wait in the cab until the driver caught him. That's what happened, honestly. Well, the driver's still downstairs, I didn't pay him, you can ask him if you like. I'll go down and pay him. - How much does mademoiselle owe you? - 40 francs. She, she tells me you've had an accident. Yes, the harness broke and Jemmy ran away. But it's always happening monsieur, think nothing of it. I... Never, never mind about the change. He's coming back now. Oh mademoiselle, I implored you not to go. But I haven't done anything I shouldn't. Was he very angry? He didn't say anything, he just stood there, waiting. He never moved once. - Forgive me. - Oh, it was nothing. - You had a right to be angry. - I had no right whatever. - Good night. - Good night. - Thank you very much. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Hello Paul. - Hello. You wish you were going there tonight, don't you? - Well, don't you? - I am going. - So am I. - Got your tickets? - Not yet. - Oh, then you're not going. - The house was sold out days ago. - I'm going in the gallery. Have you seen that line of people waiting? It's halfway around the opera house already. Tell me, is Mornay really as great as they say? Oh, what a voice she has, what a voice. There's never been anything like it. I've got two seats in the front row. Front row? And what a trouble it took to get them. Hey, waiter. - Monsieur? - Here. Here they are. My friend, all the money in Paris wouldn't buy those two tickets. You wish you'd booked early now, don't you? - Your change monsieur. - Oh, yes. - Hey, what are you doing there? What is... - Pardon monsieur. - Fool you... - Sorry. Clumsy. - Oh, allow me. - Thank you. For that, you get no tip. - Good day. - Good day. Teedle dum tum, teedle ta, teedle teedle ta ta...  Teedle teedle dum, teedle teedle tum tum, teedle teedle ta   Teedle teedle dum tum ta   Teedle eedle ee tum tuttle ta da  Smack my silly face, kick me. That's what I'm, Mr Allison goodness gracious and for goodness' sake, what a tragedy. - What's gone wrong now? - What's gone wrong now? We got ham, we got eggs, we got wine, we got bread, we got fruit... - But we only got two plates. - What? You hear me? Only two plates, our lunch is a catastrophe, we are ruined. There she is now. One. Coming. - Hello. - I knew you'd come. Well, I shouldn't. And you're just as beautiful in the daytime. Come in. - Well, I only came to tell you that I... - All that matters is that you're here. Oh, excuse me. This is August Archipenko, Mademoiselle Marcia Mornay. - How do you do? - Oh mademoiselle, what an honor. - I can only say what an honor. - Thank you. Archipenko is my maestro. He try to make an opera singer out of me. Yeah. Professor of music... from the Weingarten University mit experience in Munich and Salzburg and proud... possessor of 7 diplomas. - But no pupils except me. - Yeah. - How do you like our little suite? - Oh, I like it. It sort of reminds me of when I first started. Oh, but you haven't seen it all. Well, over here, the view from the balcony embraces the Tuileries, the Place de la Concorde, the Louvre and the backyard of the local milkman. We see him watering the milk every morning. - But I can't stay Mr. Allison. - Ah, no? I really only came because I didn't want to break my promise. I'll have to go right along. But I'm awfully sorry. - Oh, but we... - Oh, is all for me? Yeah, we got a Virginia ham too. - Ham? - Yeah. And eggs. Eggs? Ham and eggs. Awfully sweet of you. You, you couldn't just stay for 10 minutes, could you? It wouldn't take that to have everything ready. - Well? - Could you? - Just 10 minutes? - Not another second, Archipenko. Oh, but... Oh, well.  Carry me back to Old Virginny  A little more fuel, more fuel. The music, the music. Please not the music, the music... Quick, the plates, the plates. - The plates. - The plates. Ach Du lieber. Your highness, mi lords, gentlemen... also members of the opposition, I give you... - Mademoiselle Marcia Mornay. - Mademoiselle Marcia Mornay. Oh, thank you sirs. Gentlemen... I give you Virginia ham served in saucers. - Virginia ham served in saucers. - Virginia ham served in saucers. - Sol. - Sol. Sol and prosit. Let's just pile them up for now and wash them later, eh? - Yes'sum. - That's my honey child.  Carry me back to Old Virginny  There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow,  There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime  There's where the darke'ys heart am longed to go.  There's where I labored so hard for old massa   Day after day in the field of yellow corn  No place on earth do I love more sincerely   Than old virginny   The place where I was born   Carry me back to old virginny  There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow  There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime  There's where this old darke'ys heart am longed to go  There's where I labored so hard for old massa   Day after day in the field of yellow corn  No place on earth do I love more sincerely   Than Old Virginny   The place where I was born  Ach Du lieber. Bravo, bravo, bravo. Excuse please, I was just a little bit listening, I didn't want to disturb you... Makes you kind of homesick, doesn't it? Oh no, I, I don't have time to get homesick. But you would like to go back sometime, wouldn't you? - Oh, sometime yes. - Are you from Virginia too? Me? - Oh no. - Maryland? - But you are from the south? - Oh yes sir. - Mississippi? Georgia. - No, sir. - Alabama? - No. - North Carolina? South Carolina? - No. - Louisiana? - No. - But you must've come from someplace honey. - Oh yes, I sure enough did. Where from? - Virginia. - Virginia? All right then, I'll, I'll remember you to the folks when I go back. - Oh, you not going back, are you? - I've been thinking about it. Oh no, you mustn't, I mean... with a voice like yours, you, you really should stay here and become a great singer. That's just, exactly, explicitly what I am always saying, aint it? Oh, I don't want to be an opera singer. But, don't you like to sing? Oh, I like it all right when I'm happy about something... or when I sang to you like I did then. But mademoiselle, he ain't got ambition, he ain't got application. Oh, Archipenko wants to sell me into slavery. I want to sell him into slavery, I want to put him into the opera. That's where he belongs, but will he work? Oh no, not if I get wild horses to drag him there, he will not work. That bad boy. Oh mademoiselle, please say something. Do something that will make him work. Oh, but he wouldn't listen to me, why should he? I could think of a lot of good reasons why I should. Then how can I make you work? How? You can... Oh, the time. - What I've been doing here all this time? - You can't go now. You don't understand, I've got to go, I'm, I'm awfully sorry. - Auf wiedersehen. - Auf wiedersehen. - Please. - Goodbye. Oh, I'll come down with you. Oh no, please don't. I'd rather you didn't. And Paul, I mean Mr. Allison... - I'd like you to promise me something. - Anything. Don't ask to see me again, ever. - Oh, I won't promise that. - Oh, but you must please. I can't very well explain but... I shouldn't have come here in the first place. Then why did you? Well, I told you I didn't want to break a promise. - Is that all? - Yes, yes. Oh, please try to understand. It's been lots of fun and I've loved it but it's all over now, it's finished, bye. Home, quickly. But I Tell you the tickets were stolen. I even remember the numbers, row 8, 6 and 7. - Row 8, 3 and 4. - 6 and 7. - 3 and 4. - Will you keep out of this a minute. Please, take us to our seats. It's impossible monsieur, those seats are occupied. - But call the manager. - I'm sorry, the manager isn't here. Why not? It is his duty to be here, where's he? - I do not know monsieur. - Oh please, go and get him. I cannot go, monsieur. - Don't be so insulting. - I cannot leave my post. Let us through to our seats, I told you the numbers. I think I even know who is in them. - Row 8, 3 and 4. - 7 and 8. Sir, kindly step aside, you are causing a disturbance. I am going to have you discharged for this. Come on Mimi, we find the manager. There she is. Look those eyes, aren't they marvelous? She's beautiful. Watch how she moves her hands, isn't she graceful? Well? Oh... - How you get in here? - I did my best to make him go, but... Will you get out of my dressing room at once or must I call an attendant? Oh, no, no, no. I'll go. I only came to tell you that... I think you sing more beautifully than I thought anyone ever could and to thank you. - I told you I didn't want to see you again. - But I want to see you. Well, now you've seen me. - Ellen, open the door for him. - But there's one thing before I go. - Quickly. - Tomorrow is May day. - It's a fair at Saint-Cloud, may I take you? - No. - Goodbye. - Please? Oh, don't be absurd, you know it's ridiculous. - But it isn't. - Will you go? You mustn't be found here. I'll go if you come to Saint-Cloud tomorrow. I can't, I mean, I don't want to. Won't anything make you go? - What? - Come to Saint-Cloud tomorrow. Who is it? Monsieur Nazaroff wishes to know if you will receive the critics in 3 minutes Mlle. Yes, yes I will. Now you must go. I mean it. You really must. - Come to Saint-Cloud tomorrow? - Yes, yes I will. - I'll call for you at 10 o'clock. - Oh, for goodness sakes, don't do that. - I'll meet you there. - At 10 o'clock? - Yes, yes. Only go, go. - Right. Go. If you gentlemen will excuse me for a moment. - Oh, I beg your pardon, sorry. Excuse me. - Not at all sir. - I'm afraid I was in your way. - Oh, no, it's my fault. I'll see if mademoiselle Mornay is ready to receive you. Who was the visitor? Oh, just a silly young man. He wasn't troublesome Nicolai. He'd been out front and wanted to see me so he could talk about it afterward. Wasn't important, really. The critics are outside scratching at the door, shall I let them in? - Well I... - Remember... these critics are the people who count in your life from now on. They fill the orchestra seats for us, silly young men... only fill the gallery. Yes Nicolai. - Monsieur, are you not coming to the fair? - Sure. - Where's your sweetheart? - Oh, she's coming. Good, you can't have any fun without a sweetheart. Thank heaven, I was afraid you weren't coming. I know, I couldn't get away any earlier. Ellen, take the carriage and wait over there somewhere. Lovely. Oh yes, but I was mad to have come. Look... until we leave, you are going to forget who you are and... what you are and everything else except it's May day... and the sun is shining and we're going to have fun, eh? - Swing? - Love it. - Fun? - Oh yes. Here... Well, I'm showing you how to do it. - Bravo. - Oh, right in the middle. Madame.  Sul mare luccica I'astro d'argento   Placida  I'onda Prospero il vento   Venite all'argine barchette mie   Santa Lucia, Santa Lucia   Santa Lucia   Venite all'argine barchette mie   Santa Lucia   Santa Lucia  Bravo, what a voice. Dance? Great. - Shall we go over it? - Yes. Let's sit here for a while. Oh, thank you. Well, are you sorry you played truant today? - No. - Have you had fun? Fun? I never knew there was such fun, such happiness. I've never been so happy in my life, it's been wonderful.. - I know something much more wonderful. - What? You. Oh, have you forgotten I'm a prima Donna? - No, but you have. - Oh, no, I haven't. No, in about 3 hours I'll be singing the page song from The Huguenot's in a boy's wig. This will all seem as though it had never happened. By, by tomorrow, I'll have forgotten all about it. - No, you won't. - Oh, yes, I do. No. I'm going to sing you a song to remember it by. Unless you'd rather I just went on talking nonsense. Oh no, do sing it please. - It's about more things than May day though. - Oh, what? Sweethearts. See, you're mine. Only in the song.  Oh, love is so sweet in the springtime   When two hearts are singing in May   No years that are coming can bring time   To make me forget dear, this day   I'll love you in life's gray December   The same as I love you today   My heart ever young will remember   The thrill it knew that day in May   Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart   Will you love me ever?   Will you remember this day   When we were happy in May   My dearest one?   Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart   Though our paths may sever  To life's last faint ember will you remember   Springtime, lovetime   May  I love you, I always loved you, I always will. Oh, Paul. Paul, darling. Please... - There's someone else. - Yes? The one at the theater, Nazaroff, isn't it? Yes. - Do you love him? - Yes. Yes, I do. - Do you love him? - I'm going to marry him. Oh Paul, Paul, it shouldn't have happened, I shouldn't have let it happen, But was such fun, so exciting and... I kept hoping it would end like that and not like this. Can you forgive me? I find it hard not to, the way things are. Paul, I want you to know this. I'm not just marrying him because he's good and kind... and because he needs me. There are stronger ties than that, you see... everything I have, everything I am, I owe to him. Even being here today, even meeting you the other night. He's made all those things possible for me, all of them. When I first met him, I was nothing. Nobody believed in me. I'd even stopped believing in myself... and yet he gave up everything, his whole career, all his other pupils... just so he could guide me to success. That was 4 years ago. In all that time, he's never stopped believing in me. In all that time, he's never once broken a promise. Nor failed me. That's why I can't fail him now Paul. Even... Even for something I want far more. I understand. I met you too late. Yet something inside me won't let me believe it. Please Paul... let's, let's just remember this day. We will Marcia. One day to last us all the rest of our lives. It will, it will. I'll always love you dear. And I'll always... remember you... and your song.  Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart   Will you love me ever?   I will remember the day   When we were happy in May   My dearest one   Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart   Though our paths may sever  To life's last faint ember we will remember   Springtime, lovetime   May  Bye. Goodbye. Mr. Nazaroff, we greatly appreciate your having selected our hotel. Not at all sir, we've always been very happy here.. - Genaro. - Si, signore. - Adolph. - Ja. See that madame's broth is prepared immediately. I trust that this suite will prove adequate and satisfactory in every way. - Yes, very nice. - Madame's room is through here. Whatever you may wish will be attended to instantly. Thank you very much. Gentlemen, tell, tell the press they needn't wait. - We no interview today. - Very well. - Fanchon. - Yes sir? Where's the board of directors from the opera house? Well sir, I had arranged with the hotel management... I'm sorry sir, but the gentlemen haven't arrived as yet. They were to met me here, I'm accustomed to punctuality.. - See what's delayed them please. - Certainly sir, at once. - It's a very pleasant suite madame. - Yes, they all are. Wish we'd stay in one place long enough so we could take a house. I'm tired of hotels. I'd like a hot bath Ellen, you ask them if they'll arrange for one please? Oui, oui, madame. We'll have to leave for your official reception in an hour. I've left word you're not to be disturbed till we go. Thank you Nicolai. Mary. The gentlemen from the opera are late. Doesn't really matter. You don't have to see them at all, as a matter of fact, I'll attend to them. Thank you Nicolai. - You tired, after your voyage? - Oh, not very. Wish we didn't have to go to that reception though. Oh, so do I. Oh, by the way, you'd better wear your jewelry, they'll expect it.. All right. - You glad to be back in America? - Oh yes. You don't exactly show it. Do I have to? When I'm not on parade? Poor darling, you are rather tired, aren't you? Oh, I'm sorry Nicolai. I'm just not awfully excited about anything, that's all. I'm sorry. I should've remembered that, that excites you less than anything else. Why do you say things like that, Nicolai? I don't know. Have no right to, have I? After all, you've been a perfect wife. You've been faithful and loyal, obedient and affectionate. In the face of all that, it's unimportant, I suppose. Never once, in all the years that we've been married... have I ever felt I completely possessed you. You've no right to feel like that. I know, all I regret is... it's made me love you too much. Come in. - The directors from the opera are here sir. - Tell them I'll be with them immediately. Very well. I wouldn't worry too much about it Nicolai. Your bath will be ready in a moment madame. Thank you. - Will you be seated gentlemen? - Thank you. Oh Mr. Nazaroff... it's a great pleasure to welcome you and madame Mornay to New York. It's a very proud day for us sir, a very proud day. Very generous of you to say so sir. Now, we have here the contracts, the arrangements, and all the other formalities to be observed. I think you'll find them quite in order. - Traviata? - Yes, Traviata, yes. We sold out the opening night already and the booking for the season is exceptionally high. Our advance publicity has been out two weeks, entire supporting cast is been contracted. And the scenery and costumes are almost complete. So, you see, we've not been idle Mr. Nazaroff. No, far from it. In fact, you've gone to enormous pains to cast, dress and advertise an opera... that madame Mornay has not the slightest intention of appearing in. - Not Traviata? - Not Traviata? - But the cast is been signed. - The scenery is cost $1,000 to date. - Yes, and all the costumes. - Traviata is a beautiful opera. - We decided on it after long discussions. - But without consulting madame Mornay. But naturally, we took it for granted that you'd... Which is so unwise. What opera do you suggest then? - Czaritza. - Czaritza? Czaritza. But Czaritza has never been presented here before. Quite, but Trentini wrote it especially for madame Mornay. What could be more perfect for her opening in New York? But Czaritza needs a baritone. We have no baritone important enough to sing opposite madame Mornay. I'm afraid that is a slight exaggeration. We have a very efficient baritone in Paul Allison. - Perhaps you may know him Mr. Nazaroff. - No. I've heard him spoken of to his credit, as a matter of fact... Madame Mornay will be quite satisfied to have him sing with her. But he's not well enough known to the public. The public will be there to hear and see madame Mornay. I'll get in touch with Paul Allison when I leave here. Thank you. Then that concludes the discussion gentlemen. - Where's madame? - She's in the bath. - Marcia? - Yes? I've arranged the details. You open with Czaritza. - 4 weeks rehearsal, starting this afternoon. - Will that be time enough for them? It'll have to be. - Who they got for Petrov? - Paul Allison. Paul. Well... - Couldn't they get someone better known? - Why should they? Nothing to worry about dear, he's got a very fine voice they tell me. I've heard of him before. Don't want to hurry you, but we got to go straight on to rehearsal after the reception. The hour is drawing close. Yes, yes, yes. I'll be there. See, half an hour late. She think we got nothing better to do... than to kick our heels all day long in this blasted barn? Drown all prima Donnas, I say. If I were president, that's what I'd do. I'd drown all prima Donnas and replace them with the choir boys, they're punctual. - You called the rehearsal for 1:30. - Well? - It's just 1:30. - 2 o'clock. Well, what I said about drowning all prima Donnas still holds good. Permit me madame Mornay, May I present Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Abrams. - How do you do? - You gentlemen of course know Mr. Nazaroff. It's a great honor madame, a great honor. Very great honor, yes. - Now, if you are ready for rehearsal madame. - Oh, quite. Permit me to introduce our stage director. Madame Mornay, Mr. Rudyard. - How do you do? - I am honored madame, deeply honored. - This is Mr. Nazaroff. - Your servant sir. - Our conductor, signore Pugliemi. - How do you do? Signore. And now madame, Mr. O'Brien, may I present the cast to you? Of course. This is Mr. Paul Allison, our baritone. - How do you do? - How do you do? It's an honor madame, to sing with you. Thank you... Very much. Mr. Nazaroff, Mr. Allison. - How do you do sir? - How do you do? And this is our basso, Mr. Dubrovsky. - Enchante madame. - Merci bien, monsieur. - Excuse me Archipenko. - Mr. Archipenko to you, if you please. Hello. Hello. Good afternoon, good afternoon. My dear Paul, I'm awfully sorry I'm a little late. How do you do? Oh, madame, how wonderful to see you again. You know, all these years I have been saying little prayers for you... because on account of you giving Paul the incentive, the ambition, the application. You remember that day Paris... When I was a student in Paris several years ago... madame was kind enough to encourage me with my career. That's the truth, from that day on, he began to work. Mr. Rudyard, will you begin rehearsal please? Oh yes, yes, of course. - If you please Mr. Archipenko. - Excuse me. If you please. Places. On account of the chorus, we'll begin with the last act. - Madame Mornay, you are familiar with yours. - Yes sir. Personally Mr. Nazaroff, I'm delighted you insisted on Czaritza instead of Traviata. You know, it's just the chance young Allison has been waiting for. Yes, I'm sure it is. If you please.  Mon coeur Ne pleure point La Mort Du noble Czar   Qui avait sans amour   Dieu, me pardonne.

Seigneur, a genoux, ales pitie de moi, Dieu Te benisse, Le seigneur protege Mon amour.  Dieu, recevez I'ame de monbien Amie, ecoutaez ma priere Dieu, Te protege Mon amour.  Good boy, good boy. You've never had such a reception madame. It was wonderful, I heard the director saying it's the greatest success they've ever had. Ellen... I'd like you to take a message to Mr. Allison for me. Tell him... Tell him not to do anything until I see him tomorrow morning, I'll come to his flat. Well, go on. Go, hurry, hurry. Madame will see no one. Postpone our press reception till sometime tomorrow. Yes sir. Tonight you surpassed even yourself. They're referring to it... as a living emotion. Whatever it was... it was extremely effective. Thank you. Was a great deal that you never thought important enough to tell me, wasn't there? Very little. Very little? Yet it stood between us for 7 years. And I brought you two together again. It has its humor, hasn't it? Or doesn't it strike you as being particularly humorous? Nicolai, I'm very tired and confused. Will you wait till we get back to the hotel? We can discuss it then. Very well. Thank you. Oh madame, you were glorious, glorious. - Wonderful, simply wonderful. - Thank you. We're having a little reception at Delmonico's and... - I wondered if madame isn't too tired... - Most charming of you sir. As a matter of fact, madame is exhausted. I'm taking her directly back to the hotel. - I'm very sorry Mr. O'Brien. - Oh, please, please. I quite understand. - Some other evening then, perhaps. - Yes, thank you. Mr. Allison... permit me to thank you for a most magnificent performance. We are deeply indebted to you for your indispensable cooperation. - It's for me to thank you sir. - Not at all sir, not at all. Good night. - Good night madame. - Good night sir. Good night. Supper is ready sir. Now... Suppose we find out exactly how we stand? Nothing could've stopped this happening Nicolai. I never realized what a terrible mistake I made when I left him. I, I thought then that I had to keep my promise to you... after all you'd done for me, I tried to forget him. I tried to put him out of my mind but I was never able to. And now tonight, I, I realize that... I love you more than anything else in life. But I can't go on living without him. - So you wish to be set free, is that it? - Oh Nicolai, yes. Yes Nicolai. Nicolai... Very well, if that's what you really want... I won't stand in your way. Good night. It's very late and you're tired. It's time you were asleep madame. It couldn't have happened any other way. You've nothing to reproach yourself with. Now go to bed madame. I'll stay with you until you fall asleep. - What's that? - Just a door banging. When things happen you never thought could happen... something inside won't let you believe it. You... You'd have to keep on repeating to yourself it's true. A door banging? Well, who... Nicolai? Nicolai? - Ellen, Ellen, Ellen... - Yes, madame? Get me a cloak quickly. I'm glad you've come here. I suggest we get this over as reasonably as possible. We will. I'm giving Marcia her freedom. And you yours... Mr. Allison. What have you... Paul, Paul... Paul, no... No. Paul, Oh... No... That day... Did last me... all my life. Don't cry, Marcia... You won't be lonely. I'll be close. Always... Paul... Oh, Paul... So that's why I live here alone. Where nobody knows me, except Ellen. Poor Miss Morrison. Marcia. I only told you to help you decide about Kip. I found Paul too late. But you and Kip have the whole world ahead of you... - If you want to take it. - Oh, I do. I've been such a fool about Kip. Thank you so much. And I'm going to come see you much more often. Then you won't be so lonely. That's very sweet of you. Oh, there's Kip now. Thank you for helping me. I'll never forget it, never. - Hello Kip. - Hello. - Came by to apologize. - I'm sorry too. I've been... thinking things over. Well, I haven't any right to stand in your way like that. Oh Kip... I, I came by to wish you luck in New York. Thank you. I'm not going. - Not going? - No. Oh, gee. Gee, that's swell. Well... It's time you came in, it's turning a little chilly and you let your tea get all cold. I'll only be a moment or two. Yes, yes. I'll make you some fresh tea.  Will you remember the day  When we were happy in May, my dearest one?   Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart   Though our paths may sever  To life's last faint ember we will remember  -  Will you love me ever?  - Will you remember the day  When we were happy in May, my dearest one?   Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart   Though our paths may sever  To life's last faint ember we will remember   Springtime   Lovetime   May  Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, I beg your pardon. Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Hardwick. - Has Mr. Jerry Travers come in yet? - Yes, sir. He's been waiting for you the entire evening, sir. The entire evening? Oh, dear. Thanks. Begging your pardon, sir. But is that the Mr. Travers, the well-known American gentleman, sir? It is indeed. He's come over to star in my show. It's his first London appearance. Your show, Mr. Hardwick? I'm producing it. But I don't want any of the members here to know. I want to surprise them. I'm sure they'll be surprised, Mr. Hardwick. Hello, Jerry. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Jerry, there are a lot of things that I have to discuss. So I want you to come over to my hotel now. What happened? Jerry, I forgot to tell you. I want you to stay here for the night. I'm sorry, I can't do it. But you must, old man, really. You see, at the moment, I'm having a sort of a problem with my valet. What do you want me to do, press your pants? No. You wouldn't know how. No, you don't understand. It's my man, Bates. - We've had a bit of a tiff. - How terrible. - You didn't come to blows or anything? - Nothing like that. We're not speaking to each other. We've had rather a clash of taste. You see, Bates insists that a square tie... is the only possible tie that can be worn with evening clothes. A square tie, imagine. I prefer the butterfly. - I think Bates is right. - Bates is never right. - Well, then why don't you fire him? - That's a little difficult. I'm hoping against hope that the man will just disappear. I hate to interfere in these little family squabbles. But let's hope he'll approve of me. There's never any telling with Bates. There you are. If you please. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Allow us to introduce ourselves, sir. We are Bates, sir. Really? - We are Jerry Travers. - Welcome to our menage. Thank you, Bates. It seems that I'm to stay here tonight. At least that was the idea of our beloved impresario. Whose idea? Mr. Hardwick's. His idea. Welcome anyhow. Thank you, Bates. Pardon, sir, but may we make a personal observation? - Not too personal. - No, sir. It's merely that we feel impelled to compliment you, sir... upon your excellent taste in ties. - They like me. - You never know. Where on earth did you ever find him? From the Salvation Army, as a matter of fact. I sent them a pair of very old shoes. I see. And the shoes came back and Bates was in them. And he's been wearing my good ones ever since. - How's Madge feeling? - She's fine. Thanks, Jerry. The climate at the Lido has done her a lot of good. That's fine. Too bad she won't be here for the opening tomorrow night. Isn't it? She's heartbroken, really. However, she's expecting us to fly down to Italy for a weekend. Fly down to Italy for a weekend? I can't. I haven't got any goggles. My word, Jerry, you'll have to go. She's counting on us. She's going to have a young friend visit her. I suspect there's something in the air. You know Madge and her matchmaking proclivities. Is she expecting me for a weekend or a wedding? You can't tell. You know how wives are. No, I don't. How are they? Wives? They always have a little scheme. Look here, I think it's about time you found out for yourself. - You do? - I certainly do. No, thanks, Horace. In me you see a youth who's completely on the loose. No yens, no yearning. Hello. This is Miss Tremont. I'd like to speak to the manager immediately. Hello. Are you there? Who? The manager. Yes. I can't hear a word you're saying. There's a young lady downstairs. A young lady. At this time of night? She can't come up here now. No, I'd better come down myself. Jerry, go right ahead. A young lady downstairs evidently wants to see me. Hello. Won't you come in? I'm awfully glad you dropped in. I dropped up from the room below, where I've been trying to get some sleep. I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was disturbing you. You see, every once in a while, I suddenly find myself... dancing. I suppose it's some kind of an affliction? Yes, it's an affliction. St. Vitus' dance. And it only occurs at this time of night? Yes, that's it. It only occurs at this time of night. As a matter of fact, I really shouldn't be left alone. Yes, I can see that. You probably should have a couple of guards. I think you're very unkind to make fun of me. I'm sorry. - I wish you wouldn't leave. - Why not? I think I feel an attack coming on. See, there it is. So I see. There's only one thing that'll stop me. You must tell me what it is. My nurses always put their arms around me. I'll call the house detective and tell him to put his arms around you. Good night. What are you doing here? What are you carrying that for? - Who was the young lady? - What young lady? That call wasn't for me. It was for you. Somebody has registered a complaint. I know. I've just seen the complaint. She's lovely, she's delightful, she's charming, and she wants to sleep. She does? And I'm going to help her, and you're going to help me. Take this. No, bring it in here and guard it with your life. - What are you going to do? - Never mind. Look here, what's the idea? The young lady downstairs wants to sleep. So you told me. I've appointed myself her official sandman. But, Jerry... What else have you got? I'm sorry, sir, but you've cleaned out the shop. You better tell them to plant some more for tomorrow. They are all to go to Miss Dale Tremont, sir? That's right. Her room number is 304. What's that? That's for the opening of a butcher shop, sir. - Send that up, too. - But, sir, a horseshoe? Why, yes, I may want to order a peach orchard tomorrow. What's the number of your room, sir? Just charge it to Horace Hardwick, room 404. Yes, sir. I wonder what Mr. Beddini is going to say about this. What can he say? He's been sending her flowers daily ever since they came here. And entre nous... the desk clerk has intimated... that Mr. Beddini provides Miss Tremont with all the niceties... including her clothes. Really? - Good morning. - Good morning. - I do hope you slept well last night. - I slept well enough, but not long enough. I'm sorry. I was hoping... there was something I could do to square myself. That's quite all right. I thought perhaps I could drive you to the stables. No, thank you. I have a hansom cab waiting for me outside. With a horse in front of it? Yes. You see, the stable people always use them. They feel the horse is coming back. Where's he been? We're leaving tonight. Has Mr. Beddini made arrangements? Yes, Miss Tremont. He's ordered your baggage to be picked up at 7:00. Thank you. - Driver. - Yes, miss? Can't you go any faster than this? Lord love a duck, miss. I can, but I'm not allowed to leave the horse. I meant the horse, of course. It's like this, miss. You see, the horse is kind of tired today... on account of having won the Grand National on Friday. Are you trying to tell me that this is a racehorse? Yes, miss, and I've got his pedigree, too. As a matter of fact, his sire was Man O'War. Who was his dam? - I beg your pardon, miss? - I said, who was his dam? I don't know, miss. He didn't give a... Peekaboo. Stop this cab at once. I don't know how. I've never handled anything more complicated than a Duesenberg. Take it easy, Mavis. What are we going to do? In dealing with a girl or horse, one just lets nature take its course. There we are, miss. I told you the horse would bring you to the right place. What is this strange power you have over horses? Horsepower. Don't I even get any thanks? Buy yourself a new hat. Cab, miss? May I rescue you? No, thank you, I prefer being in distress. Charming little spot you have here. When does the concert start? Just as soon as you and the rain stop. Now, please. You wouldn't like to be just a little bit more friendly, would you? Why should I? I don't know you from Adam. Maybe it's the way I'm dressed. Are you afraid of thunder? No, it's just the noise. You know what thunder is, don't you? Of course. It's something about the air. No, when a clumsy cloud from here meets a fluffy little cloud from there... he billows towards her... she scurries away and he scuds right up to her. She cries a little... and there you have your shower. He comforts her. They spark. That's the lightning. They kiss. Thunder. Who is sending you this horse's shoe? How cute. Alberto, I've seen him. I've talked to him. I've danced with him. - Him? Who is this him? - Who? His name is Adam. You forget this Adam. You have promised to go with me to Italy. Your friend Madge Hardwick is awaiting you. There, you will dazzle the eyes in clothes designed by Alberto Beddini. Alberto, I hope you don't mind, but I'm not going to the Lido. Madre mia. What you say? My dear, listen to me. We have made agreement. Beddini designs the clothes... which you wear among your friends, the smart people. So that they ask: ""Who is so smart as to make these smart clothes?"" And you say, ""Who? Who is so smart? Beddini. "" Forget this Adam. Beddini demands it. Beddini does, does he? Alberto, up to the present, our relationship has been purely a business one. But if you start interfering in my personal affairs... I'll go back to America and live on the dole. Now, Dale darling, I'm so sorry. I did not mean to interfere. Go ahead, fall in love with this Adam. Marry him. But, as Mrs. Adam, what would you wear? Fig leaves. Thank you, sir. Dale, a telegram for you. Read it to me, please. ""Come ahead, stop. ""Stop being a sap, stop. ""You can even bring Alberto, stop. ""My husband is stopping at your hotel, stop. ""When do you start, stop. "" I cannot understand. Who wrote this? Sounds like Gertrude Stein. No, it's from Madge Hardwick. She says her husband is stopping at this hotel and will look you up. Wonder what kind of man Madge married. He's sure to have influence. Let's be nice to him. I'm going to be too busy being nice to somebody else. Dale, you can't do this. All my life I have promised my dresses to take them to Italy... and you must be in them. Sorry, Alberto, but I'm unpacking. Never again will I allow women to wear my dresses. - Good evening, Miss Tremont. - Good evening. Mr. Beddini and I have decided to stay. I'm so glad. Then I'll cancel the order about the bags. Thank you. Is there a Mr. Hardwick stopping at this hotel? Why, yes, Miss Tremont. Mr. Hardwick has room 404. Just above you. - Are you sure? - Definitely, miss. As a matter of fact, there's Mr. Hardwick now... on the mezzanine. The gentleman with the briefcase and cane. - Horace, here's a telegram for you. - For me? - It's from Italy. - Italy? That's probably from Madge. There's a message in your room to call the box office. Some trouble about the tickets or something. Trouble? With the tickets? My word, Jerry. Why, they wouldn't dare. Will you hold those things for me please? Get a taxi and I'll meet you downstairs. All right. Cab, miss? When a clumsy cloud meets a fluffy little cloud. We're only trying to investigate matters, miss. We must protect our guests. She does not need your protection. I am too much protection enough. There's nothing to investigate. Nothing matters, nothing's happened. Will you please ask these gentlemen to go? You mean to tell me that girl slapped your face... in front of all those people for nothing? What would you have done, sold tickets? I mean, you did nothing, and yet she slapped your face? - Now you're getting it. - I wish you'd be serious about this. One breath of scandal at this time will ruin our show. Why, I'd rather have had it happen to me than to you. - If you enjoy that sort of thing. - I do, immensely. Don't be absurd. I hate men. I hate you. I hate all men! But cara mia, you make a big mistake. I am no man. I am Beddini. How could he have made love to me when he was married all the time? And to Madge of all people. So, this snake in the grass, this Adam... already he has eaten the apple? Yes. I will kill him for you. Have you finished packing? But you do not understand. Are we leaving or aren't we? No, you cannot go back to America. We must go to the Lido. But I can't face his wife. And why not? Women are facing wives every day. And, after all, you can't avoid seeing Madge sometime, can you? I guess not. Very well then. Why not face the musicians now? All right. Maybe she ought to know. You're sure you didn't forget yourself in the park? Positive. If I ever forgot myself with that girl, I'd remember it. - We're the management. - Are you? Oh, dear. Some more of these plural personalities. Just a moment. Jerry, get into my bedroom, quick. No one must know you're here. If they ever suspect that you're in this, it'll be in every newspaper in an hour. Well, gentlemen, this is a pleasant surprise. A small matter of great import has come to our attention, sir. I am up here in your interest and to protect the hotel. - We wish to avoid any scandal. - Scandal? Yes, in connection with a certain slap in the face. The young lady refuses to divulge why she slapped you. Well, she didn't slap my face. Who did she slap? Why, it was... Who? It was he, my valet. Me, sir? Why, of course. Don't argue with me. How did it happen? Possibly we had been a little imprudent, sir. Of course. You see, we had been a little imprudent. But you said it wasn't you. Not Mr. Hardwick. Gentlemen, we take all the blame myself. And there we are. There you are. You see, it was just a mistake. I'll take him to task personally. - Thank you, sir. - Not at all. - Good night. - Not at all. - Good night. - Good night. Bates, thank you. You know, really, you are an invaluable assistant. Thank you, sir. Allow us, sir. Thank you, Bates. - Your coat, sir. - Really? This is like old times, isn't it? Your helping me with my coat, I mean. It's a pleasure we have missed, sir. - Thank you, Bates. - Thank you, sir. How is our lumbago this evening, sir? - It's so much better, Bates, thank you. - Thank you, sir. - Bates. - Yes, sir? There's a crisis afoot. Couldn't we bury the hatchet? I mean, couldn't we forget all about the ties? Sic transit gloria mundi, sir. - Bates. - Yes, sir. Mr. Travers is in trouble. He's practically put his foot right into a hornet's nest. But, hornets' nests grow on trees, sir. Never mind that. We have got to do something. What about rubbing it with butter, sir? You blasted fool, you can't rub a girl with butter! My sister got into a hornets' nest and we rubbed her with butter, sir. That's the wrong treatment. You should have used mud. Never mind that! Mr. Travers is in trouble. It is liable to develop into a scandal that will involve all of us. There's a young lady in the room below us. I've seen her, sir. I want you to find out all you can about her. Follow her wherever she goes. Never take your eyes off her. - Never, sir? - Never. - Whither she goes... - Thither I, sir. Right you are, sir. Whither or thither. - What happened? - It's all right. I fixed it. But things are getting involved. This is a deep-laid plot. Nonsense. Why should this girl want to involve me? Why, for money, of course. Publicity. Anything to create a scandal. I'm going to see her and buy her off. You're not. If anyone's going to buy her anything, I am going to do it. No, you stay right here. I'll clear this all up myself. It's probably some little thing you did... carried away for the moment, that offended her sense of decorum. If I did, I'm going right down and do it again. Goodbye, old boy. Come along, cara mia. - Get me a taxi, quickly. - Taxi. Follow that cab. Come in. Where's the young lady that has this room? She's gone, sir. - Gone? - Yes, sir. You don't mind if I get on with me work? I gotta get these flowers out in the morning's rubbish. That's all right, go ahead. Go right ahead. Jerry, do you realize that we have less than an hour before the show opens? We've got to get out of here. Come on. Women do strange things sometimes, don't they, George? Yes, sir. - That first act was simply marvelous. - Good. Everybody's crazy about it. The critics are raving. I've got some more good news. - Did you find out were she's gone? - She? Oh, that girl. No, but, Jerry, please. The entire Thackeray Club is out in front. You don't suppose my dancing has disturbed them? I don't think so. They didn't say. Of course not. It's perfectly all right here. Second act begins, Mr. Travers. Thanks. I'll be there. Really, the second act. A lot of telegrams for you. I'll be right back as soon as the act is over. My word, I never read my own telegram from Madge. Isn't it too bad she isn't here tonight? The biggest night of my life and she isn't here. - What does she say? - All kinds of good wishes for our success. Sorry we can't fly down to Italy after the performance to meet her friend. Her little friend is in London, staying at my hotel. Her name is Tremont. Tremont? Wait a minute. Let me see that. Horace, hire a plane right away. We're leaving for Italy in the morning. One minute, Mr. Travers. You can't do that. The seats were sold out for months in advance. How long does it take to fly there? Seven hours. You have to be back Monday for a performance. Charter a plane for the weekend, we'll be back in time. You're on, Mr. Travers. I will not jeopardize my position. If you want this show to run two nights, get me a plane now. - What kind of a plane? - One with wings. I'll go look for Madge and see you later for cocktails. - Dale, when did you get down? - Just now. Good. Have something to drink. Horse's neck. - It's grand seeing you. - And it's grand seeing you. Now tell me, did my husband look you up? - Yes. - How did he impress you? I think he is very fascinating. Fascinating? You know, every once in a while, the effect Horace has on people surprises me. He sort of surprised me, too. I'm glad you liked him. He will be here today. No. He can't... What's the matter? Did he flirt with you? He sent me a room full of flowers. That was sweet of him. But, Madge, you don't understand, he... - He chased me in the park. - Really? I didn't know Horace was capable of that much activity. Did he catch you? - Yes. - Good for Horace. Why, Madge, you shock me. Horace flirts with every attractive girl he meets. He doesn't mean anything. That's a funny way to take it. My dear, when you are as old as I am, you'll take your men as you find them. If you can find them. And another thing, Jerry. The gossip at the hotel was that this man, Beddini... was supplying her with everything. Money, clothes, flowers. No, Horace, you provided the flowers. I? I never did anything. I didn't even know her. Don't be ridiculous. But anyway, as soon as we land, I'm going to see Madge... and I am going to find out from her just who and what this Tremont person is. I only want to find out where. Now, Jerry, I warn you... you don't realize the trouble a designing woman can make for a man. Now, I know all about these things. I wouldn't tell this to anybody. I am the victim of a designing woman myself. - Surely you don't mean Madge? - Why, certainly, who else? Not Madge. She doesn't know anything about it either. Her name is Violet. She is what the French call a passade. I see. Little ships that pass in the night. Ships? Yes. Exactly. I met her at the birdhouse in the zoo. She was a very pretty little thing and she seemed to be quite frightened. Of the birds? Yes. You see, she had led a very sheltered life. It was the storks in particular that worried her. I took her to a cinema... and then we had dinner and then I took her to another cinema. Then I fear I forgot myself and let her kiss me. That must be his plane now. Come on. No, I'd rather not. Come on. If I were you... I wouldn't miss this opportunity of seeing the early worm get the bird. You know, Dale, I haven't told you the real reason I asked you down here. Haven't you? No, I feel I've known you long enough to have the right to talk to you this way. In spite of the fact that all men are males... there is no feeling so secure as having a good, reliable husband. I know. - Jerry. - Hello, Madge, I'll see you in a minute. Where did Miss Tremont go? - Dale didn't tell me she'd met you. - Yes, we've met. Fine, I've arranged a little dinner party for all of us. Let's eat now. Leave the child alone, she's a little upset about something. - Really? - Yes. Tell me, how did Dale strike you? - Right between the eyes. - Good. - Where's Horace? - I left him struggling with the baggage. The hotel's crowded and both of you will have to bunk together tonight. Dale's with me. - Did you get that room for my husband? - Si, signora, but I am so sorry... because of the carnival, the only thing available is the bridal suite. - The bridal suite. - How romantic. Thank you. Signor, are you Horace Hardwick? Thank you, I am. How do you do? - I am very displeased to meet you. - Really? What do you mean, displeased? Signor, I warn you. For men of your kind, this is not a healthy place. My dear fellow, this is one of the healthiest spots in Europe. The air, the breeze, the flowers. So it is funny tricks you're being. I warn you... never let your path criss-cross mine again, or the heart... - Horace. - How do you do? Madge, darling. My, your passion frightens me. - Been practicing? - Yes. Well, scarcely. No. Madge, what do you think has happened to me? - I know. You got your first long trousers. - Madge, please. There's something down here that I have to investigate... and Jerry thinks that I... Maybe I better tell it anonymously. You know, it sounds as if you were about to confess something, Horace. Does it? What would I have to confess? You really want to tell me about Dale Tremont, don't you? Yes, but then again, no. You see, as a matter of fact, I haven't even met her yet. - You haven't met her? - No. If that's your story, Horace, you stick to it. I suppose you weren't in the park, either. The park, my dear girl, it happened in the zoo. What? The zoo... Yes. The zoo was in the park. How did you know I was there? - A little bird told me. - The stork? I think, after the trip I better clean up a bit. - Of course, I understand just how you feel. - Yes. - What's the matter? - It's Madge. - Has she been chasing you? - No. Jerry, I think she's found out about Violet. And I just had my life threatened. But what did he say? He just lied in a straightforward manner, and said he'd never met you. - He did, did he? - I told you he'd forget all about you. I'll make him remember me in a manner he'll never forget. Has Horace been away from you lately for any length of time? Well, he was alone on the Continent last year. Connect me with Mr. Hardwick's apartment, please. Madge, have you any objections if I scare your husband... so that he'll never look at another woman? Dale, no husband is ever too scared to look. Hello. Hello, where are you? So you do remember me? He remembers me all right. - Are you alone? - Completely and desolately. Fine. I'll be right up. Horace, she's coming up. She's coming up here? She can't do that. It isn't proper. - She wants to see me alone. - Alone? Jerry. What did I tell you? She wants to compromise you. Rack your brains, please. Couldn't you have met that girl someplace else before? I could have met her in Moscow. - In Moscow. You see? - But I've never been to Moscow. Couldn't you have met her in Paris? The last time I was in Paris, I was 10 years old. Jerry, I don't think it's safe for you to see that girl alone. I don't think it would be quite proper for you to receive her that way. Hello. I know you'll think this is a little unconventional of me... but I just couldn't wait to see you alone. I'm awfully glad you came up. My darling. Hello. How have you been? I've been missing you terribly. I came down on the fastest plane I could get. No, I meant before yesterday. - Before yesterday? - Yes, of course. Don't you remember? Should I? Have you forgotten... - what we've been to each other? - No. What we've been to each other... I knew yesterday in the park, when I was dancing in your arms... - you remembered who I was. - Of course. Who are you? Then you still don't remember? I can try to remember something. How could you forget that funny little house... and the suspicious concierge... and that quaint little room? We used to have tea and muffins in front of the fireplace... watching the shadows leaping on the ceiling. And those long walks down that twisty cobblestone street to the river. Paris is heavenly in the spring. So that's where we met. Yes, last year. In Paris. Why, of course. It's all coming back to me now. Is it? Yes, but you weren't calling yourself Dale Tremont. - Wasn't I? - No, it was... Madeline, that was it. I called you Mad for short. You've put on a little weight, haven't you? Remember that night on the Left Bank... you had on that little blue dress I bought for you? And to think that I almost forgot you... Tell me something. Do you still have that awful weakness for diamond bracelets? I suppose I do. Make yourself comfortable, darling. I'll order some cocktails. A little later on, we'll have supper up here, just we two. It'll be like old times, won't it? I think I'd better be going. I'll let you go on one condition. Promise me, now that I found you again... we can be to each other what we were in Paris. There, you see? I was right. Of all the scheming, brazen creatures... trying to pretend that she met you in Paris. Do you realize that she's deliberately trying to trap you? - What are you going to do about it? - Marry her. Jerry, this is no time for you to be funny. All right, then, you be funny. I'm going down and ask her to marry me right now. Jerry, please wait. Now, before you make a complete fool of yourself... promise me that you won't ask her... until I find out from Madge more about her past. All right, you find out all about her past... and I'll go down and plan her future. - Remember, that's a promise. - All right, it's a promise. What happened? Did you scare him? No. He scared me. What did he do, make faces at you? You know, sometimes I get up in the morning... and I take a good look at him and he frightens me, too. He mistook me for someone called Madeline he'd met in Paris. Really? Madge, do you think you ought to let him go away from you alone? I don't believe he was nearly so innocent in Paris as you seem to think. Darling, you interest me. I must send him to China next year. But, Madge, you don't seem to understand. I'm trying to tell you that I'm afraid... that we're carrying this thing too far. You know, I wonder if you've seen something in Horace... that I've never seen. I wonder what's keeping Horace. What's the matter? I'm afraid I'm going to have a headache. Don't go. This is a meeting I've been planning a long time. Good evening. It's nice to see you again, Miss Tremont. You've robbed me of the pleasure of introducing you two. You've already met. Yes, we've met last spring. I hope you see a lot of each other. You know, Madge is the most understanding person. She seems to know instinctively the kind of girl that interests me. I don't know what I'd do without her. That's sweet of you, darling. You two run along and dance, and don't give me another thought. That's what I'm afraid of. I think Madge is a very brave person. Yes, I have a tremendous admiration for her. Well, if Madge doesn't care, I certainly don't. Neither do I, all I know is that it's... Why don't you tell me what this is all about? You know we never met in Paris. I know. I'm afraid I haven't been quite fair with you. You see, I know who you are. What difference does that make? - So that doesn't make any difference? - No, why should it? I don't know who you are, and I don't care. That's big of you. Well... Well, what? Aren't you now supposed to say... we should think only of what we mean to each other... that we're entitled to live our own lives? I don't think I'd say it that way exactly, but aren't we? Go on. If it weren't for a promise I made in a moment of weakness... I would go on. You made a promise. That shouldn't make much difference to you. That's right. Forget it, marry me. How could I have fallen in love with anyone as low as you? She loves me. - What are you doing? - Packing. I'm leaving. You don't know what a mess we've got into. Why, what's the matter? Your husband. - He wants to divorce you and marry me. - I see. He wants to do right by both of us. Did he mention any settlement? No. That'll come later. He'll probably want me to pay myself alimony. Now listen, Dale. I don't want you to go. That won't solve anything. I can't stay here under the circumstances. Here or there, as long as you remain a spinster... you're fair game for any philandering male. You know, what you really should have... is a husband you can call your own. Seriously, I mean it. But what are we going to do about your husband? Don't worry, dear. I'll do it. Come in. Darling. All I said was darling and she smacked me. Jerry, how does it look? Tell me frankly. It looks like a sunrise by Maxfield Parrish. Jerry, that's terrible. I can't go around now like this. Put a piece of raw steak on it. That'll take the swelling down. It would? - A steak? - Sure. Yes, sir. - Order a steak. - A steak. Very good, sir. You know, Jerry, I can't imagine what's got into Madge recently. She's never hit me before. Maybe she just never thought of it before. Room service. Yes. This is the bridal suite. Yes, will you please send up a nice, juicy steak? I beg your pardon? Yes, mashed potatoes, and carrots... and spinach. Yes, of course, coffee... As soon as you get your eye fixed, we'll go down and see Madge. Where do you want it, sir? - Want what, Bates? - The steak, sir. On my eye. On your eye, sir? My word, why do I always have to say things twice? On my eye means on my eye, doesn't it? - I beg your pardon, sir. - Don't argue! Jerry, you see what I'm up against. The man has a sluggish brain, always wants to debate things. First it's a maniac, and then it's Madge, and now it's Bates. I give you my word, if anything else happens, I'll go insane. We are a grand success. Every woman, she's saying this dress, she's wonderful. This Beddini is the tops. I'm so happy. No, but, cara mia, it's not the dress, it's not Beddini. It's you who wears it. Thank you, Alberto. What is it? Is it Adam again? His Garden of Eden... he has made you sad? It's just that I'm all mixed up, that's all. Why worry about this man? I think I'm worrying more about his wife. Beddini does not like to see you so sad. Alberto, you seem to be the only one left I can turn to. Why don't you marry Beddini? He'll make you happy. Why not? I'm rich, I'm pretty... and then this Hardwick will leave you alone. I'll marry you if you really want me to... but let's do it right away. First of all, we'll get you straightened out... and then I'll ask Madge about Dale. Mr. Hardwick, dear sir, one of our guests has informed us... that he is to be married this evening. We wondered if you would give up your bridal suite. - Give it up? Why we... - We've hardly settled in it yet. - Have we, angel? - No, and all our clothes are... Please. - Of course you may have it. - Thank you, sir. I shall remove you elsewhere. Come on, dear sir, brace up. Madge has merely heard something about this Violet girl. We know it isn't the truth, you tell her yourself... that's all she's waiting for. I know. That's what I'm afraid of. Always remember that the truth has never hurt any man. Jerry, you are right. Anyway, if it does, I'll go to the hospital with you. Horace, what is this, Halloween? Madge, Horace has a little confession to make. I've been waiting for this for some time. Come right in and get it off your chest. You'd better take your glasses off. Sit down. You see, when Horace was in London, he met a certain young lady. And, Madge, you must have had an inkling of this or... - Or you wouldn't be telling me now. - Never. What? Certainly. What Horace means to say is... that he'd like to make a clean breast of the whole thing. - Before I find out the truth. - Exactly. Madge, this girl was... What? Dear, I'm all mixed. Where am I? - Hello. - Madge, darling... I wanted to call you and tell you I just got married. You got what? I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you. It sounds just as if you said you got married. - I did. - Where are you now? Going to the bridal suite? Very proper place for a bride and groom, isn't it? Darling, I must compliment you on your speedy work... but who on earth did you find to marry you so quickly? Alberto? You'd better hang up, Dale, dear. - I think I'm going to faint. - Dale. What was that? - Dale Tremont married? - Yes, to that dressmaker. - Good. - Good? What did you have to do with this? - It's all his fault. - My fault? Yes, she told me how you chased her in the park and she slapped your face. Yes, but I'm the one she slapped. She's been mistaking me for Horace all this time. No wonder she thought Horace was fascinating. No wonder. I resent that. - Madge, where is she now? - On her way to the bridal suite. Bridal suite. I'll see you later. But, Jerry, you can't do a thing like that. It isn't fair. All is fair in love and war, and this is revolution. - Yes, this is very pretty. - Thank you, dear sir. We are very proud of our bridal arrangements. Is there anything else, sir? Yes, would you please ask my wife to join me here? It is a pleasure, dear sir. What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Yes, but this is my room. - Yes, but this is my room. - But I have the key. But I have the key. - But I am Beddini. - You got me there, pal. We will see who is the owner of this room. But, Jerry, you shouldn't be in here. - It isn't cricket. - No, Horace, it isn't tiddlywinks either. Signor, there is a man in my bed. It's too bad. He's not here yet. I'll just wait until my uncle returns. Thank you. Why, Jerry, I didn't know that you had an uncle here. - Didn't you know? - No. I haven't, but this room is just above the bridal suite. He's not here, signor. If he returns, you will call us. If he returns, I will kill him. We Beddini have the motto: For the woman, the kiss. For the man, the sword. Dale, you are lovely. Like a flower I am afraid to crush. Don't be afraid. Alberto, make him stop! Who is it? You know? Yes, it's Horace. Horace Hardwick, that interloper. I'll stop him. For the man, the sword. Mrs. Hardwick's apartment, please. - He's coming. - Is he? You keep this up and hold him here as long as you can. I will. Madge, you'd better come over and rescue Horace. Alberto has gone after him with a sword. Why, yes, of course. I'm sorry to break in like this, but I simply had to see you. Will you please stop annoying me? But you've been mistaken about me. - I'm afraid I haven't. - All right, then. I'll stay right here and there will be a scene with your husband. He'll be furious if he finds you here. Then please come with me for a few minutes. I've simply got to talk to you. And so you see, my dear chap, I am definitely the wrong person. - But you are Horace Hardwick, no? - Yes, of course I am Horace Hardwick. Then you are not the wrong person. Prepare. Don't mind me. I just came up to see the fun. Madge, explain to this maniac that he is making a very serious mistake. He may be making a mistake, but it's not serious. Go right ahead, Alberto. No, I cannot kill him before a lady. If you're going to pull out on us, Alberto, maybe it's best that you don't kill him. I may want that pleasure myself someday. But why didn't you tell me who you were? After all, I mean, you never gave me very much of a chance. Mr. Travers! Help, somebody. I am so sorry. I really did not want to kill you. - You must forgive me. - I forgive you. Go right ahead, boys, don't mind me. Not tonight, Alberto. Some other time when I'm feeling stronger. Thank you. - Pardon me, sir. - What is it? What's the matter? What have you been doing? Pardon me, sir, Mr. Travers and Miss Tremont, sir... they're drifting out to the bay in a gondola, sir. There. That ought to make you feel pretty small, accusing me. - He's kidnapped her. - Kidnapped her? You are in this plot. You are cahooting with him. I've had just about enough... Children, if Dale and Jerry are drifting out to sea... don't you think the best thing we could do is rescue them? Yes, come. Isn't it marvelous to have some brains? I'm always so helpless. Don't answer me like that. Do something. - Jerry. - That isn't Jerry. That's right. Make a fool of yourself. It's no crime to look, is it? - I think there is no gas left. - My word, no petrol? Perhaps I'd better look at the engine, where is it? They may have hidden it up there under the hood. This is the first time I ever had to walk back from a boat ride. Jerry, you mustn't come with me. I'd rather talk to Alberto alone. Alberto will have to get accustomed to talking in front of me. No, seriously, I'd rather you wouldn't. Please. When am I going to see you again? I don't know. Mr. Travers, they went after you, sir, to look for you, sir, in a motorboat. - Mr. Beddini, too? - Yes, sir, all three of them... but they won't be back this evening, sir. We took the precaution of removing the gasoline. Thank you, Bates. What is it, my good man? Yes. I'm masquerading. Don't you understand English? You don't understand English? Well, I've been waiting for an opportunity like this since my childhood. You frozen-faced flatfoot. And grazie to you if it comes to that, you stultified shrimp. Can I help it if you look like a mildewed donkey? I'm adoring this. And grazie to you, since you insist. You see, I happen to be breaking the law. I admit it wholeheartedly... but, of course, you would never know that, you fish-faced nincompoop. Good night. I arrest you for masquerading as a gondolier. I further charge you with insulting an officer with vile names... according to Rule Three, Section Three of the law dealing with delinquents. Beg your pardon, signoro, the carnival is beginning. Shall I serve now or will you wait for the groom? I don't think the groom will be here tonight. - Very good, sir. - Very good? It's perfect. I still feel a little guilty being here with you... while Alberto's out looking for us. Let's eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we have to face him. The hour of reckoning is at hand. Beddini is about to settle his accounts. Skipper, will you tell my husband we're here? He's the one with his mouth closed. Listen, you two idiots, Alberto is as mad as a drunken toreador. - Where is he? - He's gone up to the room. If you take my advice, you'll take the first plane back to London pronto. Not until I've asked Mr. Beddini for his wife's hand. Do you think he'll accept me? - Mr. Hardwick. - What do you want? I regret to report, my dear sir, that your manservant has been arrested. - Bates? Really? - Yes, sir. He would have spent the whole night in jail if I had not bailed him out. You don't mean it. Come in. At last. The little birdies have come flying back to the rooster. Mr. Beddini, we want to explain this whole thing to you. I will not listen to any excuses, not even the truth. Jerry, Madge, I have the most amazing news. A few days ago, my invaluable manservant, Bates... Allow me to tell them, sir, please. Quiet, your turn will come later. A few days ago, my invaluable manservant, Bates... The needle has gotten stuck in a crack. You tell it, Bates. Thank you, madam. You see, Miss Dale, Mr. Hardwick thought you were a dangerous woman. And he asked me to follow you in case you did something dangerous. - Follow me? - Yes, miss. And in order to put you off the scent, I thought of many little disguises. This evening, I met Mr. Beddini and Miss Tremont... and fearing that they might recognize me... I turned my collar around... like this. And very cleverly, I became a clergyman. You are the one who married us. Yes, sir. Then we've never been really married? Precisely, miss. Well, Mr. Beddini... what are you doing in this young lady's room? Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, You saw the fight last night? I was reading about it. Says it was great. - It was rotten. - What was the matter with it? I expected a fight to the finish. But in the 77th round the guy got yellow and quit. That certainly is a bird of a picture. So help me, I never saw a woman more beautiful. It's just come this morning. Gus didn't wait for his breakfast before he had it stuck up there. A guy don't need any breakfast when he can look at her. She is beautiful. I wish she'd take a shine to me. You better not let Gus Jordan hear you say that... or you'll be picking lead out of your pants. When did that crawl in here? Hit him on the back before he chokes to death. This ought to learn you that free lunch is meant to be ate. And not stored for the winter. Hello, where've you been? Ain't seen you since Sweeney Carson croaked your girl. Been away on important business. I'll be around a lot from now on. - How are you, boys? - Fine. Hi, boys, drinks are on me. - Been waiting long? - About 15 minutes. - When did the painting go up there? - This morning. I think I got the dope on how to get Jordan this time... and get him right. Gus seems to be sitting as tight as ever, Dan. Don't you believe it. Just because he's running for sheriff and stands in good with the higher-ups... don't mean he can't be showed up. Pretty soon, I'll be standing in his shoes as boss of this here district. And then... And you figure she goes along with that honour, Dan? I always thought you were warm for her. Yes, I got to admit it. This is my first big chance. Jordan's playing a crooked game. So far he's kept under cover. But once I get hold of something I can take to the district attorney... Gus'll be out and I'll be in. Then it'll all be over but the celebrating. She ain't no easy gal to handle, Flynn. I know that. She's a pretty slick article. When Chick was sent up the river, she blowed into Jordan's arms... just for protection, and he's too blind to see it. Sure, he's all puffed up over himself. Do you believe it? He actually thinks she's in love with him. Ever since I sang that song, it's been haunting me. It should haunt you. You murdered it. - You play that like it'll hurt you. - It does. No, I'm moody that way, see. Say, boss, I got a brand new tune, just out. Yeah? What is it? It's called After The Ball Is Over. Play it. Kelly, that'll be a great song for Lou. She's getting famous. Tony Pastor himself offered to sign her up for his music hall. You don't mean Tony Pastor way uptown on 14th Street? Yes, that's the one. Pastor says that Lou's got it all over Della Fox. Hello, Mrs. Meg. - Mrs. Flaherty, I'm disappointed in you. - Disappointed in me? Just because I come here with me little can. Sure, a pint of beer will hurt nobody no time. It's not only that. I'm disappointed at not seeing you at the mission. - At the mission? - See here, Cummings. What is it, Jordan? I thought you'd given up the idea of trying to reform my place. - No, I'm still hopeful. - Hopeful? I'm not going to have you people interfering in my business. Before you started that mission next door, we never had any trouble around here. I've heard differently. But if what you say is true, I'd only be too glad to be mistaken. Now, see here, Cummings, I'm telling you again. I'm not going to have my customers driven away. Why, I wouldn't think of doing such a thing, Jordan. - Hey, Jordan. - Yeah. - How are you, Gus? - Hello, Flynn. - How are you? - Great. - Have a drink? - Sure. - Set up over there. - Right, boss. Haven't seen you here for more than a month. Where have you been? Here, there, and everywhere. City's getting so big, it takes time to get around it. One of these days, we'll be walking across a bridge to Long Island City. Walking? We'll be riding over in one of them horseless buggies. I'm thinking of buying one of them for me and Lou. - By the way, Gus, how is she? - She's in demand, I tell you, Flynn. The Bowery Savings Bank and Rupert's Brewery... are fighting to use her pictures exclusive on their New Year's calendars. She sure is a handsome girl, Gus. I wonder you don't get jealous, all the men are so crazy about her. I do get kind of mad at the attention some of them show her. But it ain't bad, having a girl that all the men are after. Shows I must be pretty good, eh, Flynn? Take a look at that. Just bought it for her. Ain't that a pip? Big as a nickel. What would you do if somebody tried to take her away from you? Probably, nothing... to her. Say, the flies here are terrible. You pick out the ones you don't like and I'll kill them for you. - Someone wants to talk to you in the office. - All right, Spider. - Excuse me, Dan. - Sure. Lou is the swellest girl that ever came down the Bowery. You fellas don't know nothing about Lou. But I do. Just before the battle, Mother - When did you get in, Rita? - Two days ago. But I did not come here direct, you understand. Good girl, Rita. Take no chances. We are very discreet, Serge and me. Gus, you must like Serge. He's been a most valuable assistant. - Sure you can trust him? - You know Rita. We've got to be especially careful. I can't take chances of having headquarters watching around this way. - They will find nothing. - No, not if we stay awake. But don't forget. No talking to anyone. Rita never talks. - But are you sure about Lou? - She doesn't know a thing. Say, she's out of this. Understand? Out of it. Of course, Gus, if you say so. Serge, we were talking about Gus' friend, Lou. Yes, I have heard of her. She's very beautiful, yes? More beautiful than these? She makes them look like a bunch of dishwashers. Hello, Mickey. Lady Lou, you're a fine girl, a fine woman. One of the finest women ever walked the streets. - How are the girls today? - Just fine, Miss Lou. - Hello, Rita. - Why, Lou, I'm so very happy to see you. - Glad to see you back. - Yes. Lou, this is Serge Stanieff. Pleased to meet you. Take a look at this, Gus, and learn something. I am delighted. I have heard so much about you. Yeah, but you can't prove it. Serge is my new assistant, Lou. Day or night work, Rita? He should be a big help. - You got the pictures, Lou? - Yeah, I had them taken with all my rocks. Wait till you take a look at these. - I kind of like that one. - Yes, this one is beautiful. - And this gives me a lot of style and dignity. - Sure is a pip, Lou. Wait till you see this. For the bedroom. A little bit spicy, but not too raw, you know what I mean? - Want to see the pictures? - Yes, I would like very much to see them. Don't be backward. I'm not. They're wonderful. But I like best that marvellous painting of you in the bar. Yeah, I got to admit that is a flash, but I do wish Gus hadn't hung it up... over the free lunch. Mike, you sure took long enough. What've you been doing up there? I was looking at all the beautiful things. Looks like heaven. That's why you gotta climb stairs to get there. - Is that all, Miss Lou? - You can go. Thank you. Mike and his horses are as famous as this dance hall. The only difference, the horses are sober. Yeah, you're sure a pip, Lou. I suppose I'll be seeing you around, Rita? Oh, yes. And you Mr... Come, Rita, let's get this business over with. - Spider, see that I'm not disturbed by anyone. Come, Rita. All right, boss. Serge, come. Pearl? - Here I come. - Come on, honey. - I just loves to work for you, Miss Lou. - Yeah? You buy such pretty things. And all them diamonds. - You're so rich. - Yes. I wasn't always rich. No? There was a time I didn't know where my next husband was coming from. Yeah, but I means is you ain't never been in the circumstances... where the wolf came to your door. The wolf at my door? Why, I remember when he came right into my room and had pups. - Well? - A pint, Kelly. - Did you fix it like I told you, Mrs. Cassidy? - No. Always take a bit of butter and rub it at the bottom of the can. - That kills the suds. - Is that so? I never thought of that at all. - Why didn't you tell me that before? - I don't know. Spider? - Yeah, what's the matter? - Look at that. I got it. Get out of the way. - Get out of the way. Give her some air, will you? What's the trouble? This girl tried to croak herself, but they stopped her before she could. All right, Spider, bring her up. Bill, fix up something for her. Right away, Lou. Think of trying to bump herself off in here, of all places. She come to the right place, all right. - What do I do with the kid, Lou? - Put her right over here, Spider. - Where's Gus? He's down in his office. He left word not to be disturbed for anything. Thanks. You go downstairs and shut that crowd up, will you? You can go, Spider. I'll look after her. Poor kid looks like she is all in. She must have been up against it to want to croak herself. Come on, take this. Here. Come on. This will fix you up. - What's the matter? Committed murder? - No, not that. I never will. Then you have nothing to worry about. At least the guy is alive. How did you know there was a man? There always is. It takes two to get one in trouble. You know everything about me. I wouldn't say that, but I am observant. Come on, move over here. Sit down there. What was he? Married? Yes, but I didn't know. Makes no difference to me whether you did or not. Men's all alike, married or single. It's their game. I happen to be smart enough to play it their way. You'll come to it. Where've you been? Just when I need you most of all, you ain't around. I ain't been no place, Miss Lou. You ain't been no place, you've just been lost. Get my little friend here fixed up with some new clothes. Get these rags off her. - What's your name, dear? - Sally. - Sally, what? - Sally Glynn. Always remember to smile. You'll never have anything to worry about. Forget about this guy. See that you get a good one the next time. Who'd want me after what I've done? Listen, when women go wrong, men go right after them. You want to put more petticoats on her? No, she's got enough on. Wouldn't need any of them if they didn't stuff this furniture with horsehair. If you was to go out and something were to happen... I wouldn't want no policeman to catch me without no petticoat. No policeman? How about a nice fireman? That's the spirit, sister. - Lou, I'm just bringing the folks in. - All right. Such a gorgeous place, Gus. I didn't think such a room existed in this house. Everything here imported special from Paris. - Hello, Rita. - Hello, Lou. I didn't expect to see you so soon. - You're here, too? How nice. - Lou? What's become of the girl who caused the excitement downstairs? She's inside. Pearl's fixing her up. She'll be all right. You gotta do something about people using your joint for a morgue. - What about this poor creature, Lou? - Some guy done her wrong. The story's so old it should have been set to music long ago. I would like to see this girl, Lou. I think, perhaps, I could do something for her. That'll be great. I'll send her in. - You look after her, Gus. I gotta dress. - All right. - I think she would be very useful to us. - Don't mention it. How charming. How lovely. Come, sit over here with us. What a sweet, innocent face. Can't you do something for her, Rita? Can you sing and dance, perhaps? Not very well, I'm afraid. - But you'd be willing to learn? - Yes, I guess so. Then, I think I can find you a very nice position. Have you heard, perhaps, of the Barbary Coast? No, I don't think so. But it wouldn't make any difference. Your people? Your parents? I don't want them to know anything about me. I don't want them to know where I am. You just leave everything to your friend, Rita. There you are. Come with us now, little girl. We'll take good care of you. Thank you so much. Lou, we're going to help this little girl. All right, Gus. She's a nice kid. - Are you busy? - Yeah, I'm a little late getting dressed. Come, Serge. - See you later. - All right, Lou. Come up again, any time. I shall. Then I hope you will be alone. So do I. Warm, dark, and handsome. - Your bath is ready, Miss Lou. - You take it. I'm indisposed. Serge, come. All right, Spider, just a minute. Here you are. You go with Rita, she'll take good care of you. Sally, you come with me, dear. I will take very good care of you. Pearl. - Pearl? - I is coming. Yeah, you is coming, your head is bending low. Now, get here before winter. - Here I is. - Here you is. Eight Ball, what're you doing? Working for me or sleeping for me? I ain't sleeping so much that I don't see what's going on around here. What've you been seeing? That fellow from the mission. Mr... What's his name? Y'all know what's his name, Miss Lou. I'm surprised at you, with all your experience, casting eyes on a preacher. Now, Pearl, you know I've never been interested in a man's job. Besides, he ain't a preacher. Anyhow, he ain't like the other men you done made history of. No, that's what makes him kind of interesting. Wouldn't hurt me any to have a new kind of man added to my record, would it? Goodness me, Miss Lou. You ain't thinking of reforming, is you? You know, preachers don't give away no diamonds. I told you he ain't a preacher, he just runs the mission next door. I hear he ain't gonna run that long. I hear they're gonna take the mission away from him. Fella named Jacobson that owns the building... I hear they can't pay the rent. Seems to me you've been hearing things. - Who's that? - Spider Kane. In a minute, Spider. - Miss Lou'll be here in a minute. - Thanks, Pearl. Come in, Spider, sit down. What's on your mind? I want to talk to you about something. - Nothing serious, I hope. - Not exactly, Lou. Well, yeah, maybe in a way, it is. Spill it. I ain't afraid. My conscience is clear. Leastwise, I think it is. What I've got to say is about Chick Clark. Chick Clark? I'm wondering if you ain't sort of forgetting about him. I've gotta admit it's been a long time since I've seen Chick... but I ain't never completely forgot about him. - He's been in a year now, Lou. - Yeah, I know. You know how he took his rap, quiet like. Same as we all would. It was tough he got caught, but it wasn't my fault. I ain't the sentimental kind, Spider. Sure, but remember, you said you'd be, well... waiting around for him whenever he gets out. Gets out? That's gonna be a long time. What I want to say is... supposing he found out you ain't exactly been waiting. I gotta do something while I'm waiting, don't I? Chick wouldn't figure it that way. Suppose he found out about Jordan? - What are you trying to tell me? - Go up and see him, Lou. What for? And antagonise Gus? If I start going up there, Gus'll think I'm still caring for Chick. Not that I don't like him a lot. I ain't got no complaint. - Chick was a good man. In his way. - He's in love with you, Lou. And being in the clink a year without the girl what makes you feel that way... ain't no picnic. I wish he'd forget me, but the guy is a memory expert. Go up to pacify him, Lou. Make him think everything is all right. Chick is pretty bad when he wants to be. You don't want him feeding you bullets. I don't exactly want to be dodging around in tin corsets. How's about it us going up to see him tomorrow? Why tomorrow? Me laundry will be back then. - Make it Sunday. It'll be nice and quiet. - That's fine, Lou. It'll be a swell trip. We can take the boat up the Hudson. I'll take the train. Water and me don't agree. All right. - Wait a minute. - Please don't tell them I'm here, Captain. - Captain, will you help me? - What's the matter, Pete? There was a window broken down at Flaherty's drug store. - I didn't mean to do it. - Where is he? - Which way did he go? - That's Doheney. - Don't let him get me, Captain. - Get up there and stay quiet. - Where is he? - Who? Don't try to fool me. I know you're always trying to help these dirty crooks. Now where did he go? Where did you put him? - Who do you mean? - Pete the Duke, you know who I mean. You must be mistaken. Pete's been helping me all afternoon. - Who says so? - I do. Two against one, Doheney, so flap your heels. What's the matter here? You're in again? Listen, Jordan, I'm after Pete the Duke, I saw him come in the door... Just a minute, Doheney. I thought I told you you weren't welcome here. What's the use of stalling me? I saw him come in the door... Thanks. Ain't having much luck, are you? I'd have a great deal more if Doheney and the others would cooperate. Ain't none of them worth saving. If you hang around them long enough, you'll get that way yourself. Thanks for the kind interest. I always did like a man in a uniform. That one fits you grand. Why don't you come up sometime and see me? - I'm home every evening. - Yeah, but I'm busy every evening. Busy? Say, what are you trying to do, insult me? Why, no, not at all. I'm just busy, that's all. You see, we're holding meetings in Jacobson's hall every evening. When you have a moment to spare, drop in. You're more than welcome. I heard you. But you ain't kidding me any. You know, I met your kind before. Why don't you come up sometime? Well, I... - Don't be afraid. I won't tell. - But... Come up. I'll tell your fortune. You can be had. Remember, Lou. Chick's probably pretty sore. I'll make him think he's on a vacation. - Yeah, he'll listen to you. - Who won't? Once I get them, they're branded. Hello, Shorty, what are you doing here? - Five years. - What for? I forgot what me mother told me. Should have tied a string around your finger. - Hello, Lou. - Bobo, I didn't expect to see you here. If you hadn't turned me down I'd have never landed in here. Say, Lou, how about giving me another chance when I get out? - When do you get out? - 15 years. That's a date. Hello, Lou. Cherry sisters. Lou, you gotta help me get out of this. - Who, me? - You've gotta. I've been framed. You got a lot of pull. You can get me out, It's a frame, I tell you. You're the right picture for it. One of the fastest guys in the business, but he's taking his time now. Hello, Lou. What is this? Old Home Week? Chick. Why didn't you come to see me sooner? - 'Cause you were glad to get rid of me? - Chick. You know what I mean and you know me. What am I in here for? You know why I copped them stones? Sure, and you know who's got them now. You'd sell your heart and lungs for a handful of diamonds. And I'm doing a stretch with rats and bugs so you can have them. It's all right. As long as you're on the level. But if you ain't, I can find out. Don't forget that. I can find out. And I can get out. If you've been double-crossing me, you'll pay for it. Every day, every minute of this stretch, you're gonna pay for. Don't talk like that, Chick. I've been working. Working? Working who? Singing at Gus Jordan's. - Gus Jordan's? - It ain't what you think. You haven't been seeing anything of Dan Flynn, have you? No, why do you ask about him? Nothing. Just got a score... to settle up with him when I get out. What I want to know is are you playing me on the square or ain't you... - because if you ain't... - There'll be a death in my family? - No. - Is that it? Then I'll be back in here again. But you won't be coming around to see me. What's the use of making a lot of trouble for yourself, Chick? If I can wait a year, you can wait a year. You mean that you'll wait for me? Why, that ain't nothing when you got willpower like me. - Time's up. - Have a heart. They ain't seen each other in a year. Give them time. What for? Ready? Goodbye, Chick. It's been good to see you again. I can't let you go, Lou. I hate to leave you. Don't worry. I'll be true to you. I trust you. I trust you because I love you. You're mine. I'm telling you again, if you ever double-cross me... if you ever let another man come between us... I'll kill you. Goodbye, Chick. I'll remember to be good for you. I can't wait. I wonder what Chick's got against Dan Flynn? I ain't never told you, Lou... but Flynn is the main guy what helped send Chick up here. I ain't never had no use for that mug ever since. - So Flynn did that? - Yeah. Darling, I am growing old Silver threads among the gold Shine upon my brow today Life is fading fast away Not in your beer, dearie. Not in your beer. But, my darling you will always be Always young and fair to me Yes, my darling you will be Always young and fair to me Darling, I am growing old growing old Silver threads among the gold Shine upon my brow today Life is fading fast away - Bravo. - You took long enough. - I couldn't help it. Jacobson wasn't at the mission, so I had to go to the hock shop. - What about it? - He'll be right over. - Was that Cummings guy there? - I didn't see him. - Say, Lou, you falling for that bloke? - It ain't nothing serious... there was something just wonderful about him. That's the way it always starts. He wouldn't look at me. Only out of curiosity. He's different. You've got it bad. Say, Lou, you sent for a guy named lke Jacobson? Yeah, send him in. I want to see this guy alone, Frances. - All right, then. - Hello, Lou. - Hello, Jacobson. What can I do for you? - Sit down. - Thanks. I hear the rescue mission rents your building. Rents, that's right. But they ain't got no money. - So, how can I keep them there? - You ain't gonna put them out? Put them out, me? No. - I'll just tell them they'll have to move. - But Mr. Cummings is in charge. Yes. Nice, smartish-looking fellow. Why did you send for me, Lou? You want me to buy some of your famous diamonds or... No. What do you want for that building? You mean, how much if I'm selling, or how much if I'm paying taxes? I mean how much for cash? Now stop multiplying. I don't want to buy the Bowery. I was going to ask $25,000 for that building. My own brother couldn't buy it for $20,000. - But for you, I'll make it $15,000. - Well, I'll give you $12,000. Oy, gevalt! - $12,000. Never. - All right. - All right. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Wait. Is that all cash? No mortgage goes with it? Here's your $12,000. How do I know it is? Because I say so. You never heard of me cheating anyone, did you? No. Not about money. Now, listen, that sounds like a slam. But coming from you, I'll let it pass. Handle them with care. They're only my heart. And what a heart you've got, Miss Lou. I'll tell you what I want you to do. Come and make up the papers. And make it appear like the mission bought the building themselves. - I don't want to be mixed up in it. - We want Lou! - Lou. Hurry up, the place is jammed with all the society folks. I hope they tuned that piano. Our Lady Lou is here Ever since Miss Susan Johnson She lost her jockey, Lee There's been much excitement and more to be You can hear her moaning from early morn I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone If he was here he'd win the race If not first he'd get a place I never saw that jockey trailing anyone before I'm losing all my money that's why I'm blue If that boy was here he'd sure know what to do I'd put all my junk in pawn To bet on any horse that jockey's on I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone He went and put my brand new bunch in pawn I see him coming round that turn What a trail that man can burn He's gotta win because my dough is on the nose Just watch my jockey easy ride in style He'll hit that home stretch winner by a mile I want him to win this spree And keep on going till he comes to me I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone I wonder where my Easy Rider's gone - You were great, Lou. I'd like to have a word with you when it's convenient. I've been saving a little time for you. Come up in a few minutes. What are you doing here, Flynn? - Just getting used to the place. - Yeah? - You're thinking about moving in? - Yeah, I thought I might. - When? - When Gus moves out. - Flynn, you're an optimist. - No. You may as well know it. Gus is in the hole. And you'd be, too, if it wasn't for me. So, you're gonna protect me? From what? There's a new dick in town called the Hawk. He's been tipped off to Gus, and he's got the goods on him. Gus ain't done anything. What's he got on him? Don't be so innocent, Lou. You're talking to a man who knows you... and is willing to protect you if you play along with him. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know anything about that Sally girl? What Sally? The one you roped in and turned over to Gus. Why, he only got the poor kid a job. Depends on what kind of a job. That's where Gus put his foot in it. Where do you think he gets the money to buy you them rocks? From this place here? Don't be a fool. If Gus goes up the river, you'll go along with him. I'm tipping you off privately. What are you trying to do, scare me, Dan? When I need protection, I'll write you a letter. That ain't no way to talk to me, Lou. You said you liked me once. When I said I was crazy about you, I didn't say how crazy. I never gave up and I never will. You can't expect to go around getting men all on fire... and think they're gonna forget all about it. Now, Gus has had you long enough. He's going away. I'll see about that. And you're coming to me or nobody else. You love me that much that you'd frame Gus to get me? To get you I'd even frame my own mother. And I believe you. I'm beginning to understand you, Flynn. Tell me. Who is this here guy they call the Hawk? He's the slickest bird in the business. Even the men from headquarters wouldn't know him if they fell over him. You know, I never did appreciate you before. But I do, now. - You mean that, Lou? - Why, of course I do. I'll see about that little matter another time. - All right. - Lou, it looks like Chick's done it. - Done what? I ain't sure, but word's around he broke jail. - Made a getaway? - I'm just telling you. I'll be standing by. Thanks, Spider. Keep your eyes open and don't tell anyone. I won't, Lou. Come in. I came to inquire about Sally Glynn. I'm told she came here after she left the mission that day. - Where is she? - How should I know? You know where she is. I want you to tell me. So you've come to me to find another woman. I don't know and I wouldn't tell you if I did. You see, her father's over at the mission looking for her. - That's the only reason you want to know? - Yeah. Gus and his friends got her a job. You don't know where? No. I got other things to think about. Would you give me your word that you know nothing more? - Would you believe me if I did? - Yes, of course. - That's all I know. - I'm glad to hear that. Say it like you mean it. I do. I'm anxious not to see you mixed up in it. But I guess I'm taking your time. What do you suppose my time's for? Sit down. That's it, loosen up. Unbend. You'll feel better. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. I don't smoke. Yes, I guess smoking is gonna make a man look effeminate before long. So, all this is your famous collection? No. This is just my summer jewellery. You ought to see my winter stuff. I see. It was a tossup whether I'd go in for diamonds or sing in the choir. The choir lost. They're wonderful. But they always seem so cold to me. They have no warmth, no soul. I'm sorry you think more of your diamonds than you do of your soul. I'm sorry you think more of my soul than you do of my diamonds. Maybe I ain't got no soul. Yes, you have, but you keep it hidden under a mask. You'll wake up and find it some time. Haven't you met a man that could make you happy? Sure, lots of times. You can't go out in this. I gotta be getting back to the mission. Sally's father is waiting for me. That ought to be interesting. Yeah, but it's one of the things I have to do. Good night. Good night. Come up again. Any time. Thanks, I will. It won't be long now. Now, this is all we have on hand at present. One of the plates got busted and sort of held us up. These are beautiful, Gus. One way to get rich is to make one's own money, isn't it, Jordan? Now, you have your instructions. I won't say anything more. You know what to do. - Get rid of them quickly but safely. - Not a word, Gus. They say money talks, but this can only whisper. Stow these on you. I'll take care of the rest. - Soon we will be very rich, eh? - I hope so. - I need money. - Don't we all? One thing more... - Who's there? - Doheney. - Just a minute, Doheney. Come in, Doheney. - What's up? - Excuse me for butting in, Mr. Jordan... - but have you seen anyone around here? - No. Who? - Chick Clark. - Chick Clark? - You'll find him up the river. - He made a getaway. I thought you knew. Collins here says he spotted him out back. I'm sure it was him. He was headed this way. What would he come here for? No telling, sir. Maybe looking for trouble. Better take a look. Excuse us, will you? On life's stormy path, ill-advised Do not scorn her with words fierce and bitter Do not laugh at her shame and downfall For a moment, just stop and consider Wait a minute. that a man was the cause Sir, he might have gone that... of it all You can go home now, Pearl. I won't need you anymore. - You sure you won't, Miss Lou? - No, you can go. - Good night. - Good night. Just a minute. - Chick, what do you want? - I want you to pack up and come with me. You don't suppose I'd be fool enough to go anyplace with you. Listen. I had to croak a guard to get out. I'm here, now you're going with me. I ain't going, Chick, I'm staying here. - Don't you love me anymore? - Anymore? You mean to say you never loved me? Why, you... What? All I gotta do is call Gus, and your trip will be back up the river. - You'll never live to see me go. - None of them cheap threats. You ought to know me better. I tell you, Chick, you're through. Get out. You've got a nerve to stand there and tell me to get out. Me jumping freights and crawling through the mud to get to you. - Why, you... - Chick! I can't. I can't do it. God, I can't. Don't you know what I feel for you? Ain't you got a heart left in you for me? I gotta have you. Chick, I never knew anything like that. Just a minute. I'll meet you tonight, at Callahan's. Right after my turn. - You'll come to me? - I swear. I'll be waiting for you. Thought it was Gus. I could not stay away. I was kind of expecting that. - Hello, Rita. - Hello, Flynn. - Looking for your assistant? - Yes. Last time I saw him, he was headed that way. - So... - That's her. She's the one. She's the woman that done it. That woman there. - Sit down. - That was the one I told you about... She can't get away with anything like that again... Let me alone! That woman... - Is she talking about you, Rita? - Me? I never saw the woman before. I've never been so insulted in all my life. She must be mad, that woman. Now, I'll talk to her. I bring you a gift. Diamonds. I know you love them so. Ain't it grand. See, they make your eyes sparkle, and your teeth gleam like pearls. You are beautiful. I love you so. The men of my country go wild about women with yellow hair. I'm glad you told me. I want to keep straight on my geography. I love you. You were made for love. And for love only should you care. And now, surely, you have enough diamonds. Diamonds is my career. I swear I shall make you happy. I shall die to make you happy. But you wouldn't be much use to me dead. So, this is where I find you. - Hello, Rita. - Don't you ""hello"" me. So, the minute my back is turned, I find you making love to another woman. What did you expect? A boy with a gift like that should be working at it. What have you to say for yourself? I have nothing to say. You saw. What can I say? How dare you so insult me when I gave you the very clothes on your back. - He's gotta have more than clothes. - I'll attend to you later. Have you no apology? Are you not sorry? Do you not wish me to forgive you? - I love you, I swear it. - You love her? She loves only money and diamonds. And let me tell you more about her. She... Just a minute. You get out of here and leave her to me. My pin! What do you mean by taking my pin? - I didn't take your pin, he gave it to me. - I want it back, right now. You try and get it. I wouldn't give you this here thing now for spite. If you asked me for it the right way, you could have had it. I get all the rocks I want... but I'll keep this here thing now to remember you by. You're so very clever, Lou. So wise. And so very smart. But in my country, we know how to deal with you wise ones. - Sneaky, underhanded... - I'll kill you, you hear me? - Open that hand. Give me that knife. - You think you're clever? - Give me that knife. Rita. Here. I don't want your pin. Lou? He must've come over that shed. Lou, did you see anyone out on the shed? No. No, there's nobody there. Sorry to have bothered you. All right, Doheney. I want to have a little talk with you afterwards, Lou. - Better hurry, they're waiting for you. - I'll be right down. I'm just doing a job I never did before. Spider. - Lou, I found... - Don't bother me. - Are you nervous, Lou? - No. - You are nervous, ain't you, Lou? - No, I ain't nervous. 'Cause if you're nervous I got... I ain't nervous, but if you keep asking me, I will be. A guy what takes his time I'll go for any time I'm a fast-moving girl That likes them slow Got no use for fancy driving Wanna see a guy arrive a little low There isn't any fun In getting something done If you're rushed when you have to make the grade I can spot an amateur appreciate a connoisseur at his trade Who would qualify, no alibi to be the guy what takes his time Since I've been in office, I've never heard anything so appalling. Every word of it is true. - Is that all? - Yes, sir, that's all. What this young lady says is a serious accusation... and means the end of that gang, and coincides with Dan Flynn's report. - Let me hear the next witness. - That's all, Miss. Come, Sally. Now, Sally, tell the District Attorney exactly what you told me. Lou, what did Cummings want? I seen him go upstairs to your room. He wanted to know about that Sally girl you sent to the coast. He did? Wonder what for. The father was over at the mission and wanted them to find her. All I told him was that you got her a job. I'm sorry I ever bothered with that girl. Why are you so funny-acting, Gus? Funny-acting? What do you mean? You're acting kind of funny. Have I done anything you don't like? No. Not exactly. I tell you, Lou. I don't like this bird Stanieff always hanging around you. He's too sleek, too slippery. Too polite to suit me. So that's what's biting you. Why, he don't mean nothing to me. He's Rita's friend. I wanted to make him feel at home. Yeah? All right. I guess I'm a jealous old fool. They are valuable, ain't they, Gus? Worth pretty nearly half a million. Gonna get you a lot more of them soon. He said they had no soul. Who said? That guy, Cummings. So, you met a man who wouldn't fall for you? Who wants him to fall? Why, he'd be the kind a woman'd have to marry to get rid of. That sounds more like Dan Flynn. You ain't heard anything about this copper they call the Hawk, have you? Just talk, why? Flynn says he's spotting the place day and night. Flynn said that? What does he know? I hope you ain't sending them girls to the coast... to become classy dips and burglars, like Flynn thinks. He can't knife me and get away with it. Lou, I wanted to tell you... - You do that, Spider? - What? Something I had to do, and didn't have the time to do it... and Spider did it for me. Boss, there's a guy out here named McNeil, he wants to cash a cheque. McNeil? I don't know him. By the way, have you seen Rita around? Rita? Why, no. I guess she'll come in later. - I want to thank you Spider. It was great. - I know. - Lou, I'd do anything for you... - I went through enough tonight. - I gotta tell you... - I gotta do my number. Chick Clark is in the alley. - Chick Clark? - Yeah. What do you want me to do with him, Lou? Take him up the back way to my room. I don't want the cops to get him. - All right, Lou. - I'll figure something out later. All right, Lou. Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts Oh, how they could love Swore they'd be true to each other True as the stars up above He was her man And he was doing her wrong Frankie went down to the corner To get a bucket of beer Said to the man called the bartender Have you seen my Johnny here? He's my man And he's doing me wrong Ain't gonna tell you no stories Ain't gonna tell you no lies Saw your man Johnny leave about an hour ago With that girl named Nellie Bly He's your man and he's doing you wrong Frankie went round to that hot spot Brought along a great big.44 She went inside and then she smiled At Johnny on the floor He was her man And he was doing... Stay back, you hear? I'll plug the first one that moves. Come on, men. Come on, Lou. We've got to get out of here. No time to talk now, come on. - You get off me! - Go on! Through the tunnel. Wait a minute. - You. - Why, what'd you... Hold it! I've waited a long time for this moment, Jordan, and now I got you good. - I am boss of this district. - You're smart, but not smart enough. That's the trouble with ward heelers like you. Get a little political power, you think you're king. With bribes, petty favours you think you're above the law. It's not the mission talking now, it's the U.S. Government. - So, you're the Hawk. - Yeah, that's what they call me. Making and passing counterfeit money is a federal offence. Yeah, you and your crowd are due for about 20 years in Atlanta. Go on, boys, take him out of here. - I thought something... - Come on. - Lay off me. - Come on. Wait a minute. Say, what's going to happen to her? Never mind, she'll be well taken care of. Come on. You, the Hawk. A night bird working in the dark. Stealing the confidence of people. - The lowest kind of a thief. - I'm sorry you think so. Chief, I've got that other fellow out here, you wanna look at him? Come here. - Is that the man? - Yes, that's the man. Thank you. - Take him to headquarters. - Come on. Take care of the young lady till I get back. - Where is she? - Went out that way, sir. Why did you let her? - You double-crossed me. - What do you mean? - You planted me up here... - You got me wrong. ...and sent that rat, Flynn, to get me, but I got him first. - Now I'm gonna get you. - Wait. Say your prayers, if you know any. I'll meet you in... Come on, get him out of here. Those absolutely necessary? You know, I wasn't born with them. No, a lot of men would have been safer if you had. I don't know, hands ain't everything. All right. Come on. My wrap. If you wanna help me, pick up my train. - Come on, get back. - Keep back. Here she comes now. Get back. Come on. Sure, they got me, but they got you, too. Chief, we got them all. Yeah, all but the brass band. Wait a minute, you forgot me. Break it up, come on. Clear out. Move along. I think I'd have liked the wagon better. I suppose you'd rather have the company of your friends, such as they are. You ain't exactly a pal. Surely you don't mind my holding your hand. It ain't heavy. I can hold it myself. This is a dirty trick. I could get real sore. If I didn't have a lot of self-control. So have I, but I'm beginning to lose it. You know, you remind me of a glittering palace of ice. I ain't ice. I didn't say you were. But your diamonds are all going to the storehouse. You said I had a soul. I looked for it, but I didn't find it. - You will. - Where, in jail? - No, that's not the place for you. - You got me, ain't you? Yeah, I got you. You're my prisoner. And I'm gonna be your jailor for a long time. - Yeah? - Yeah. And you can start doing that stretch right now. Where did you get that... dark and handsome? You bad girl. You'll find out.

Wait a minute. What is this? - Well, who are you? - I'm Barney Hopkins... - producer of this show. - Oh, yeah? It's tough luck, brother. I'm from the sheriff's office. Legal attachment to collect for the credit. - Corpus delicti, or seize the body. - What, again? - Don't you dare. - Don't worry, sis, this will look nice... in the sheriff's office. - What's the excitement? - It means they close the show, dumbbell. Give me that costume. - I beg your pardon. - Well, we've got to take it back, actress. Well, that's as far back as it goes. Sorry, miss, they got to have that top. - You can at least give me car fare. - What for? This is our dress rehearsal. We got a great show. It opens tomorrow night. You can't do this to me just because I don't pay a few bills. - When the show opens, I will pay up. - Tell it to the sheriff. This is the fourth show in two months that I've been in of and out of. They close before they open. The Depression, dearie. I can remember when that alarm clock used to ring. Those good old days when you had to get up. Come on, let's get up and look for work. I hate starving in bed. - Name me a better place to starve. - Your stomach. Let's get up and get dressed. I thought we might try the flea circus. Maybe they got something for us there. - What can we get at a flea circus? - Fleas. - You can get those here. - All right. Come on, let's get up. One, two, three. - How about some nourishment? - Yeah, what's on the menu, Trixie? We'll see what the neighbors have to offer. - You guys cut the bread and set the table. - Have we any bread? Yeah, have we any table? What neighbors? I can remember not so long ago a penthouse on Park Avenue. With a real tree, and flowers, and a fountain, and a French maid. And a warm bath with salt from Yardley's. And a little dress that Schiaparelli ran up. And a snappy roadster, and a ride through the park. Now stealing milk. That's all right. The dairy company stole it from a cow. Just about a year ago this time, I was on my way to Havana. The birds were singing and the sky was blue. And I said to the big mug in the next pew, ""I need $200, big boy."" And he said, ""In my pants pocket."" You know, I reached over and I took $500 out of his back pants pocket just like that. And all I got left are his pajamas, and I'm a milk snatcher. Guess we got to give it back. Maybe it's the piano remover. - Fay! - Who'd you think it was, the wolf? If it was, we'd eat it. Why the blue spectacles, grandma? So the landlady won't recognize me. I'm obligated to her for a little item called rent. If you've come to make a touch, the bank has folded. Your millions are safe, Trixie. I came to tell you gals good news. Barney's putting on a new show. - Barney? - Barney Hopkins? - Rehearsals start in two weeks. - He must have found an angel. Come on, let's go over and find out. That's right. As soon as the mob finds out, they'll all be after him. - Come on, let's hurry. - We can't all go. We haven't got enough decent clothing left to wrap around one of us. Yeah, and if one doesn't look modish with Barney, it's thumbs down. Let's see if we can scare up enough... to make at least one of us look, as you say, modish. - Who's to go? - Let's match for it. - Taxis. - Yellow. - Checkered. - Red top. Black and white. - Checkered! - Checkered! - Carol wins. - Gee. I look much better in clothes than any of you. - Lf Barney could see me in clothes... - He wouldn't recognize you. Say, what happened to your lovely mink coat? Uncle's got it. Uncle's got everything. We've even hocked our inlays. Honey, you'll have to give me my stockings back. - Sure, there they are. - Fay? You got to give Carol that dress. Don't, I'e got to go back to the drugstore. We'll give you something good enough for a drugstore. I know, but the dress belongs to them. I'm a hostess there. - Stand still. - So am I a hostess. I've got to entertain Barney with the idea of putting us to work. Don't forget to stand in the light, Carol, when you're talking to Barney. They certainly know what they're doing... when they dress their hostesses in that drugstore. - Well, you don't look bad. - Now, take these papers... get through the enemy's lines, and ride like blazes. - Taxi fare. - Lots of luck, Carol. Thanks. Here we go, laughing and wondering. Say, watch yourself in the clinches. Don't forget that dress... belongs to the drugstore. I'd like to meet that druggist. Now, the best comedian on Broadway will proceed to make beds. Well, I'm going to get a glass of milk. In the shadows let me come and sing to you Let me dream a song that I can bring To you Take me in your arms and let me cling to you Let me linger long Let me live my song In the winter, let me bring the spring To you Let me feel that I mean everything To you Love's old song Will be new In the shadows, when I come and sing To you Dear In the shadows When I come and sing To you You can't turn these sheets anymore. They've only got two sides. Polly, will you quit mooning over that good-for-nothing songwriter again? - Now where's that going to get you? - He's wonderful, Trixie. - Honey, he's a songwriter. - So is Irving Berlin. - What's wrong about being a songwriter? - How long have you known him? Two weeks? What do you know about him? I knew everything I wanted to know the minute I met him. - Maybe it's Carol. - Oh. Hello. It's true, it's really true. He's putting on a show. It's true. Barney's putting on a show. We're coming right up to the apartment. Be there in 10 minutes. Phone all the girls. Phone Fay and Ruth and Mary and Gwen. Phone them all. Tell them to come right up to the apartment. - He hasn't cast yet, no. - Hurry and don't lose him. - They're coming up. - Who? Barney and Carol. Phone Fay. Phone all the girls. We're all set. No, you phone them. I've got to dig up the old sex appeal. The way I feel this morning I'll need a steam shovel. Half a mile, four, eight... Step on it, Polly. They ought to be here any minute now. Almost ready. Gosh, to think that we're going to have real jobs again, earn money. Yeah, and I've been off the gold standard so long. It's them. - Come on in, Barney, and meet the girls. - Hello, Mr. Hopkins. - Howdy. Howdy. - Hello, Mr. Hopkins. I've seen that face before. Well, if it isn't Barney. Good old, smiling, big-hearted Barney. - Barney, we hear you're putting on a show. - Yes, I'm doing a show. You sound more enthusiastic than usual. Does that mean it's good? You said it's good. It's the finest thing I ever had. Come on over here and sit down and tell us all about it, Mr. Hopkins. Well, I've figured it out from every angle, kids. And I can't see how it'll run less than six months... or gross less than half a million. That's figuring on $30,000 a week. At the Broadhurst we could do $40,000. - We'll do $40,000 with this show. - Gosh. - I remember you. - Do you? You were in the chorus. Someday you're coming out of the chorus. - Thank you, Mr. Hopkins. - Could you use me, too, Mr. Hopkins? Sure, I'm going to use all the girls I used before. Carol, here, will be featured... and Trixie as comic. I got some ideas for song numbers for you, honey... that will drape them over their seats. - Something new, different. - What's the show about? - It's all about the Depression. - We won't have to rehearse that. Now, it's my idea... - Who's that playing? - Some palooka songwriter. I don't know that number, what is it? It's his own. He composes music. Shut the window and let's get on with this. Wait a minute. That's not bad. Ask the fellow to come on over. Brad. - Hello. - Come on over, quick. All right. You know, that number's got a great feel to it. - The boy's got something. - Yeah, a piano. What's he done? He hasn't had a chance to do anything yet, Mr. Hopkins. - But he has genius. - Yeah? Well, the show business could stand a little genius. Barney, what's the idea of wasting time with a genius... when there's hard-working girls like us to worry about? - What is it, honey? - Come on, I want you to meet somebody. This is Brad Roberts, Mr. Hopkins. - Mr. Hopkins is our producer. - Never mind that. Sit down and play. - Play what? - That number you were just playing. - I know, but l... - Don't be afraid, you're among friends. - Go on, Brad. - Well, all right. I beg your pardon. Say, what's this all about, anyway? Go ahead and play. Sing it if you got words. All right. Here goes. I've got to sing a torch song For that's the way I feel When I feel a thing Then I can sing It must be real I couldn't sing a gay song It wouldn't be sincere I could never croon A happy tune Without a tear I have my dreams, but one by one They vanish in the sky I try to smile and face the sun But romance passes by I've got to sing a torch song To someone far apart For the torch I bear Is burning there Right in My heart That's great. I like it. - You got anything else? - Yes, I have a couple of things. - Well, play them. Play them. - All right. Hello, Mr. Hopkins. Charming to see you again. Sit down. No, I don't like that, son. It's too dull. What is this, a piano lesson? Or are we going to hear about this show? Say, have you got something with kind of a march effect, march rhythm to it? Yes, I have. I have something about a forgotten man. - But I don't have the words to it yet. - Play it, play it. I tell you, I just got the idea for it last night. I was down on Times Square, watching those men in the breadline... standing there in the rain, waiting for coffee and doughnuts. Men out of a job, around the soup kitchen. Stop! Go on. That's it! That's what this show's about! The Depression, men marching, marching in the rain. Doughnuts and crullers, men marching, marching... jobs, jobs, and in the background, Carol, spirit of the Depression. A blue song. No, not a blue song, but a wailing. And this gorgeous woman singing this song that'll tear their hearts out. The big parade. The big parade of tears. That's it. Work on it. - I'd like to do a specialty. - Sit down. You'll do a blackout. I'll cancel my contract with Warren and Dubin. They're out. I want you to write the music for this show, and the lyrics. - Can you write lyrics? - You bet he can. I've got it all figured out, and I want your stuff, son. It's great. - I definitely want it. - Mr. Hopkins, you can have it... on one condition. Yeah? If Miss Parker, Polly, has a principal part in the show. She's helped me a lot, and she's really great herself. You're telling me? I'm telling you. And I'll tell you something else, too. You got a swell voice and a great personality. You're different. You've got class. I want you to sing in this show. Thanks a lot, but that's impossible. Now listen, you and Polly would make a swell team, like the Astaires. You'd be a knockout for the mushy interest... - I'm sorry, but it's impossible. - But, Brad, why not? I can't, honey, for a lot of reasons. Let me get in on this. Isn't there going to be any comedy in this show? Plenty. The gay side, the hard boiled side, the cynical and funny side of the Depression. I'll make them laugh at you starving to death, honey. - Be the funniest thing you ever did. - Did you ever see me ride a pony? - When do rehearsals begin, Barney? - Rehearsals? - When I get the money. - Get the money? Money? That's always the way it is. I got the show, I got the music, I got the cast... I got the theater, all raring to go... and it's the old, old story. Money. - No money at all? - Not even the old shoestring. - But you said... You let us think that... - What did I let you think? I told you I had a great show, and I have. But you said it was all set. It is set. It's been set for six months. Every time I get an angel to put up the bankroll, something happens. I had one yesterday. Only today, he came to me and said he and his wife... who was suing him for divorce, had become reconciled... and she didn't want him fooling around in the show business. And here I am, holding the bag. You've got your nerve, Barney. What about these girls? They've given up jobs just because you said that... You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Gee, it's tough enough without you making mugs out of us. - We counted on this, all of us. - Wait a minute, kids. I'm not going to let you down. I've got other irons in the fire. Two men are due here tomorrow from out of town. - Texas cattle. - Yeah, Texas cattle. How can they sell cattle? Who eats meat anymore? - All I can say is... - How much do you need? - There isn't $50,000 in the world. Not to put a show on with, anyway. All right then, who needs $50,000? Make it $40,000, $25,000. If I wanted to chisel, and I know how to chisel... I could do it for $15,000, but... I'll advance you $15,000. Say, what does he use? I'll smoke it, too. Quit joking, will you? It isn't smart to make gags when girls are starving. Brad, this is too serious a matter to all of us. Honey, I mean it. I'll be glad to do it. Where can you get $15,000? He means real money, not streetcar transfers. Remember, one condition: Polly is featured. Anything you say. Nope. I can't give you a check for certain reasons. I'll give you cash tomorrow. Is that all right? - You fell for it, Barney. - He did. He fell for it. That's what's commonly known as a gag. It's not a gag. I mean it. Tomorrow I'll be in your office at 10:30. You have my word for it. I'm going to go work on that number a little, so I'll see you later. Goodbye, honey. - Brad. - Yes? - Brad, this is cruel. - What, honey? - To kid about a thing like this. - I'm not kidding. I'll give him the money. He'll have it in his office at 10:30 tomorrow morning. - Where are you going to get $15,000? - Well, honey, I'll tell you... See this ring? I just give it a little twist, make a wish, presto. - Brad. - Trust me, will you, honey? - And I'm not joking. - That's just the trouble. - I do trust you. - Oh, honey. - What? - No, I won't say it yet. I have an idea, and I want to get to the piano before I lose it. See you later. He meant it. Really, he did. I'd stake my life on it. Faith, hope, and charity. You have faith, Barney hopes, and we all need charity. Wait a minute. Listen. He's got it. Just what I want. Don't you hear that wailing? Wailing. Men marching, marching, marching in the rain. Jobs. Gee, don't it get you? - Well? - There's no answer... at Mr. Roberts' apartment. Now Trixie can say, ""I told you so,"" but I won't. It hurts too much. Come in. Gigolo Eddie always shows up at the wrong time. Hello, Barney. Heard you got your mitts on some dough to open a show. Thought you might want to celebrate. Fresh off the boat. Well, you heard wrong. Pull up a coffin and lie down with the rest of us. Business is so tough that nobody even wants to owe me anymore. - You can go. - But you hired me for the day. I thought I was going to need a secretary. Well, you'll pay me for the day, or I'll make a complaint to the agency. I wish there was somebody I could complain to. - Who are you? - We're the Zipky Kentucky Hillbillies. - Who? - The Kentucky Hillbillies. - Singing. - Dancing. - Music. - Wisecracks. - Do you know Your Old Kentucky Home? - You said it. Scram right back there. Your old mammy's waiting for you. We get it. I better lock this joint before the acrobats and midgets start flocking in. - Good morning. You're early. - I'm sorry I kept you all waiting. - Yeah? - I got a new idea for a number... and I lost all track of time. Got a piano? I'll play it for you. Hey, listen, kid, I'm the comedian around here. We've had enough of your gags. They're not funny. Please stop it, Brad. There's a limit to everything. I'm going to lock this office. Get out of here, all of you. - Don't you want the money? - Don't kid me. There you are. $15,000, cash. Brad, I always knew you were on the level. Rehearsals start at 9:00 in the morning. Fresh off the boat. Pettin'in the park Bad boy! Pettin'in the park Bad girl! First you pet a little Let up a little And then you get a little kiss Pettin' on the sly Oh, my! Act a little shy Aw, why? Struggle just a little Then hug a little And cuddle up and whisper this Come on, I've been waiting long Wait a minute. Hold it. Hold it, girls. Gordon, listen, you've got to put some life into that song. - Yeah? - You got to sing it with some pep... and some feeling. You got the whole thing wrong. Listen. Play me the first chorus, will you? Here's the way it goes. Now come on. Pettin'in the park Bad boy! Pettin'in the park Bad girl! First you pet a little Let up a little Then you get a little kiss Pettin' on the sly Oh, my! Act a little shy Aw, why? Struggle just a little Then hug a little Cuddle up and whisper this Come on I've been waiting long Why don't we get started? Wait a minute, wait a minute. What am I doing that's so wrong? Well, listen, you do this right in the middle part. Come on, I've been waiting That's not the melody. Here it is. Come on I've been waiting long Why don't we get started? All right. All right. Now, let me tell you something. I've been a juvenile for 18 years... and you're going to tell me how to sing a song? Come on, fellows, let me down, will you? I want to get a glass of water. Come on, girls and boys, show me that dance chorus. Come on, snap into it. Hit it now. Come on, let's go. Give it to me now. Listen, Brad, why don't you do this juvenile part yourself? You've got it over Gordon like a tent. Reconsider. Give your songs a break. Barney, I told you, I can't do it. You say you can't, but you don't tell me why. You've got a voice. You got personality. You can do it, but you won't. Why? Barney, will you let it go at that once and for all? No public appearances. - Hi, sweets. - Hello. Listen, honey, you've got quite a yen for that boy, haven't you? I like him, of course. There's something awful funny about him, something very mysterious. Listen, did he ever tell you where he got that $15,000? - No. - And why he has to live on $25 a week... when he can go out and come back with that much money? Now, look. ""Toronto bank clerk took $20,000... - ""from bank and disappeared."" - I can read. That's quite a coincidence, I should say. - What's a coincidence? - And look. ""New York police asked to check up Broadway nightspots."" And here's the description of him: ""5'9"", dark hair""... That could describe anybody. It couldn't describe me, and it couldn't describe you... and it does describe him. He is about 5'9""... and he has got dark hair, and where did he get that cash? Well, don't be ridiculous, Trixie. You're letting your imagination run away with you. Listen, honey, I don't want to see you fall in love with a guy... who's going to get you into a lot of trouble. I know, but I'm sure. What are you sure? What do you actually know about him? Does he ever talk about himself? Does he ever mention his family? You remember that he wouldn't give Barney a check, it had to be cash? And he won't go out there and play Gordon's part. Why? Because he's afraid that newspaper... Now, listen, don't talk, and don't come back here. You promise? I said I wouldn't, didn't I? So long. Don't say anything to anyone, will you, Trixie? On stage. Stage, lady. Come on. On stage. You know, this stuff is just as good to rub with as it is to drink. It penetrates. Show me the spot. He's been rubbing me for an hour, and he says, ""Show me the spot."" - What's this? - It's his lumbago. - Get up. - I can't, I tell you. I can't. You can't get up, can't you? No, don't. Please don't. Straighten up, you permanent juvenile. I can't, I tell you. I can't. You don't suppose you're going out there and singing a love song... with your back doubled up, do you? What kind of a love song do you think this is? You've got to straighten up. You've got to stop being a baby. Mind over matter. I can't, I tell you. I got a show. I spent weeks and months getting a show. I've worked. I've slaved. Opening night. We open tonight, and he's got lumbago. Go out and announce the show is postponed. Give them their money back. Tell them our juvenile man's dying of old age. Listen, kid, now it's up to you. Now you've got to do it. - You've got to go on in his place. - I can't do that, Barney. Why can't you do it? The curtain's going up. The show is going on. Your girl's in it. Your music's in it. Your money's in it. You've got to go on and do it. - There's a reason why. - There can't be any reason. - All right. - Well, what is your reason? Now, listen, I don't care if you have to go to jail after this performance... you ought to forgot about yourself and do this anyway. Do you know what it means if this show doesn't go on? Do you know what it means to the girls in this show? Those poor kids who gave up jobs... and will never be able to find other ones, these times. Those kids who've been living on nothing... starving themselves the six weeks we've been rehearsing... hoping for this show to go on and be a success? Well, they're counting on you. You can't let them down. You can't. If you do, well, God knows what'll happen to those kids. They'll have to do things I wouldn't want on my conscience, and it will be on yours. Now, you can go out and sing Gordon's part, and put this show over. And if you don't, well, I don't care what your reason is. She's right, Brad. I hadn't thought about it in that way. - Yes, of course. I'll do it. - Great, kid. I knew you would. Walter, get Gordon's dress suit. Get him a dressing room. He's not on for seven minutes. They won't have to hold the curtain. - Right. Come on, kids, we've got to... - Oh, boy. Get him ready. Gee, if anything happens to him now, we're responsible. There's more to that kid than I thought there was. He has nerve. He's regular. He belongs in the show business. He's risking going to prison for us. I like that kid. If he goes to prison for this, I'll visit him there, I swear I will. I want to see him and let him know that I know what it means. - Brad. - Hello. Put your ear close to the door. I want to whisper something to you. All right, honey. Brad, it's wonderful of you to take this chance tonight. - It's courageous. - It's not courageous, exactly. Say, but how do you know? Do you know? But don't think about it, Brad. Just think about, I love you. And I always will, no matter what happens. Gee, that's swell, honey. After tonight, you can tell me all about it. I'll understand, and maybe I can help. After tonight? Hurry, Miss Parker. Hurry, Mr. Roberts. - Wish us luck, sweetheart. - I do. I wish us luck. Every night a body should relax After all the wear and tear Get that oxygen your body lacks Get it in the open air Go and find a little rendezvous Underneath the starry skies Take someone who's sweet along with you For a little exercise Pettin'in the park Bad boy!

Brad Roberts, according to the announcements. And the program says he did most of the music, too. Smart kid. There's something familiar about him. I've seen him. Not in the theater, either. Wait a minute. - Let me have a nickel. - Yeah. I'm going to find out. Listen. Why, I can't believe it. The description, and I knew I'd seen him someplace before. Let's go back and get Barney to tell us the truth. What a front-page story that will make. Come on back with me. - Polly, look at this. - What? Look at it. Oh, gosh. I can't believe it. I never dreamed of such a thing. I always knew that kid was somebody. You can't fool me much. Why, Trixie Lorraine, you thought I was a fool to have anything to do with this. You don't know when I'm kidding, do you? - Mr. Bradford? - He's over there on the lounge, sir. Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning, Robert. - You're late. - Not much, am I? Seventeen minutes. - Hello, Peabody. - How are you, young man? - Sit down. - Thank you. I'll come directly to the point, Robert. Your family is greatly disturbed over what has occurred. I hope you appreciate the fact that I flew here this morning... in uncertain weather. As trustee of your estate and your elder brother... I represent the family... in saying that we cannot have you mixed up in this theater business. - You know how we feel. - Your mother is greatly concerned... and every member of your family. I cannot begin to describe to you, my dear boy, the extent of the shock. I'm sorry everybody in the family is shocked... but I'd better come directly to the point, too. Music is my career, you know that. - Music, yes... - Well, I mean the kind of songs... that's sung in shows, and over the radio, and on record. I don't mean the kind of music played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. You have to be half dead to compose that. I want to write this other kind of music. This show was my big opportunity. The show clicked. I've got my start, and I'm going on with it. As to appearing with the show, I know how you feel about that. And I did the best I could to stay out of it. But an emergency came up, and I had to do it. Now I can't let them down. Besides, I like it. Much as the family regrets that one who bears our name... should go in for this sort of sensational career... in preference to banking... nevertheless, we've agreed not to oppose you. One thing, however, we must and will insist upon. And what's that? This girl, this showgirl whose name is linked with yours... - Polly Parker. - Well, what of it? - What of it? Simply this... - Listen. Before you say anything about her, you better know this. I'm in love with Polly Parker, and I'm going to marry her. - Lf she'll have me. - What? I'm going to complain to the House Committee. Just what I said. - You'll marry this cheap little showgirl... - Wait a minute. That's pretty much of an old-fashioned idea. Families don't interfere with love affairs nowadays. And if they do, it doesn't mean anything. If you marry that girl, you'll get not one cent of income. I don't have to remind you that until you're 30... I have the absolute legal right to cut off your income. I understand, and if that's all you have to say to me... you're just wasting your time. I've got more important things to do. I shall certainly complain to the House Committee. - I can't understand him. - It's the girl. I know these showgirls. They're just little parasites, little gold diggers. - I don't doubt it. - I remember, in my early youth... I trod the primrose path on the Great White Way. There I learned the bitter truth that all women of the theater... were chisellers, parasites. Or as we call them, gold diggers. I remember... well, one experience I had with a woman of the theater. It was the day of the big Harvard game. We all came down. A stout company of young blades eager to learn about life. I met this girl at the stage door of the old casino. We went to Rector's for a bite. I had a cold bird and a bottle. She nibbled at a steak. Her name was Eunice. She called me Fuffy. I don't know why she did, but she called me Fuffy. I'm going to see her. I don't know where she is now. That was 30 years ago. No, I mean this Polly Parker woman. I wouldn't go if I were for you. You're only putting yourself into their hands. I tell you, they're all blackmailers, gold diggers, parasites. I resign. - No. - Yes. When I feel a thing That I can sing It must be real I couldn't sing a gay song It wouldn't be sincere I could never croon a happy tune - Come in. - Hey, shut the bathroom door. I will, Trixie. Without a tear I have my dreams Come in, come in. They vanish in the sky I try to smile and face the sun But romance passes by Well, who is it? I am J. Lawrence Bradford. Yes? I've come to see Miss Polly Parker. Oh, yes? I'm the brother of Robert Treat Bradford... whom you probably know as Brad Roberts. You're Brad's brother. - Sit down, I'll be dressed in just a minute. - Don't bother, Miss Parker. - I can say what I have to say... - But you see, I'm not... Please, Miss Parker. I've just spoken to my brother. He tells me he wants to marry you. You're making a mistake. - Lf you'll let me explain... - Don't bother to explain. I've told him if he disgraces the family by marrying a showgirl... the family is through with him. Did you say, ""Disgrace the family by marrying a showgirl""? I said exactly that. Showgirls are reputed to be... parasites, chisellers, gold diggers. Showgirls are excellent in their way... attractive creatures, even fascinating... but hardly fitted to shine in the upper social circles. This is not directed against you personally, Miss Parker. No, I understand that, not personally. All showgirls are parasites, chisellers, and gold diggers. Exactly. - And now... - You better let me tell you... Just tell me how much? - How much what? - What is your price? How much do you want to release his brother from his promise to marry you? - Well, this is very funny. - I see nothing amusing in it, Miss Parker. Please, don't let's waste time. How much? - I'm sorry. - Sorry? No price on me. But I insist, Miss Parker. You must have a price. I'm inclined to be generous in the matter. After all, I realize that Bob is a headstrong boy. But I'm in charge of him, and I feel I know what is best for him. I've had about enough of this. If you don't mind... I beg your pardon, but am I interrupting? No, not at all. This is Brad's brother, J. Lawrence Bradford. I'm charmed. Beware, Trixie's a showgirl. Who is this distinguished looking young man? - I don't know. - I'm Faneuil H. Peabody. - Faneuil? - Faneuil. When I know you better, I'll call you Fanny. Have you got a cigarette? Gold. My error. Have you a light? Your hand is shaking. What an unexpected pleasure. Now, come along, let's sit over on the other side of the room. Come on. Come along. You know, I used to know some Peabodys, but I think they came from Texas. Sit down, now. Come on, sit down. There. Mr. J. Lawrence Bradford tells me I must give Brad up. He also says we're chisellers and gold diggers, and wants to know my price. Well, have you told him, Polly? I was about to tell him where to head in. I wouldn't be too hasty. I'd at least discuss it further. After all, we're grown up, sensible. You're a woman of the world. I'm a man of the world. We ought to have a conference. Isn't that what businessmen always have when they're away from home? Conferences? I know a new speaky. It just opened. Their liquor is good, and do I know good liquor. It's right around the corner, and we'll be with you in just two minutes. I'll just slip into something. I beg your pardon. - What's that? - My slip. Come along, Polly, dear. Let's not keep them waiting. Here's something for you to read... Mr. Bradford. And... here are some pictures for you to look at. Now, you amuse yourselves, won't you? We'll just be two minutes. Fanny. Peabody, you're disgusting. I'm going to tell them the truth and kick them out. After what he called you? A parasite? Say, what is a parasite? You better resent it. He did get under my skin. Stuck-up snob. They've had their turn. Let's have ours. We'll take them for a ride. Use the bathroom while I use the phone. Endicott 2. Hello, Madam Minnie? This is Trixie Lorraine. Say, you know the hat with the... Yeah. No, no. The expensive one. Did the buzzer buzz? What's that? A COD for Miss Polly Parker. $75 just for a little hat? But she'll look adorable in that, won't she? Yes, she will. Now let me see. What does COD mean? That means you've got to pay for it. How inconvenient. Well, you'll have to take it back. Oh, dear. She'll be in such a bad mood. - Who will? - Polly. She did so want to wear that hat when she went out for lunch with you today. Oh, dear. When she doesn't get what she wants, you just don't know Polly. Oh, so disagreeable. She's no fun at all. Just sits there. She won't agree to anything you say. She probably won't even want to go with us. We three will just have to go alone. There you are, boy. Take it back. Here, wait a minute. - How much is it? $75 for a hat? Sure, that's what the ticket calls for. Here. - Leave the hat. - You darling man. Polly's just going to love you for this. Polly, this sweet big brother of Brad's... has insisted upon paying for your hat. - But he mustn't do that. - But he has. - But I couldn't. - But you must. That looks adorable on her, doesn't it? Doesn't it? Yes, now all you need is a corsage. I think lilies of the valley and gardenias. I guess I'll need orchids. - Shall we send out for some? - Yes. Let's be going. I must get a 4:00 train to Boston. I'm very sorry, Mr. Bradford. But I just couldn't leave the room without a corsage. And I wouldn't let Polly. I couldn't let her go out that way. We'll buy you a corsage on the way. - But let's hurry. - Isn't he a darling? You're just so generous. Polly, I wonder if you would answer that. I'm going to powder my nose. Well, what's this? Looks like another hat. We have a hat, my lad. - But I was... - You must have the wrong address. Oh, no. - Who's the hat for? - A Miss Trixie Lorraine. It's for Trixie. Let me see it. Look, isn't this ducky? Look. - How much? - It's somewhere... Let me see the bill. Bill. Yes, sir. Do all hats cost $75? Now, you dear, sweet man. You are not going to pay for that. You're not. Trixie. Come on in, Trixie. I'm very much afraid I haven't the change. - How much do you need? You just keep that. Buy yourself a yacht. But I get so seasick. Well, thanks. - Trixie. - Did you call me, Polly? Isn't this darling? Handsome bought it for you. You sweet lamb. He shouldn't have paid for it. Oh, dear. Now he'll think I'm extravagant. But what a pretty hat. You do like me in it, don't you? You know, I think we ought to take a stroll on Fifth Avenue and look at the shops. You'd be surprised how reasonable things are these days. Come on, J. Lawrence. I'm a busy man, Miss Parker. I cannot afford to waste more time in coming to an understanding with you. I've been wanting to ask you a question. Are your eyes hazel? My eyes? - Please, Miss Parker. - They are hazel. And such nice eyes. Such a good, kind expression. - Miss Parker, please. - Now don't be so formal. Didn't you promise to call me Polly? - Polly. - Thanks. - I beg your pardon. - That's all right, Fannykins. I've got to have another cigarette. Platinum. Hello, everybody. Get her. Just when I was beginning to have a good time. Introduce me, won't you? I thought you'd left. - Miss Fortune, Mr. Bradford. - How do you do? - Charmed. - You didn't introduce me. Miss Fortune, this is Mr. Peabody. - Mr. Peabody. - Miss Fortune. My good fortune. My good man, are you by any chance punning? I'm quite a punster. I get it. I suppose you were a stroke on your college punsing team. That's funny. That's very funny. Miss Fortune, won't you join us? I'd love to. I'm just in the mood. - Some champagne? - Indeed, my doctor recommends it. - Did you have a mother? - What? Whose name was Eunice? No, I don't think so. I did have a mother. Whose name was Gertrude. - You look like Eunice. - You do look like Eunice. What's the matter? Fay has an attack of chiseling. It's chronic with her. Another look at him with those bedroom eyes and I'll break your leg. Excuse me for whispering. Fay and I have so much in common. Can we have some more champagne? A quart. Now I tell you, there's only one thing to do. We've got to spend more time here. We've got to see more of her. I don't wish to see any more of her. What I've seen convinces me. We absolutely must make her think we're an easy proposition. - Suckers, you might say. - What are you shaking your head for? I'm thinking of the consequences. I believe... I can make this girl transfer her affection from him to me. - What? - Don't misunderstand me. Nothing personal in it. This girl is smart. Now what are you shaking your head for? Are you afraid? - Afraid of what? - Well, I confess I'm a little afraid. That girl is very fascinating. But we're not boys, are we? - Well, hardly. - We're men, aren't we? And we needn't succumb to that sort of feminine allure. - Need we? - Indeed, we needn't. - Need we? - Just because they want something... we don't have to give in, do we? No. Not at all. - Let me have a light, please. - A light? Certainly. A light? Yes. Where's your lighter? My lighter? Where'd you get the lighter? Fanny gave it to me. Fanny? This is marvelous. This is wonderful. Who's Fanny? Fanny is Faneuil H. Peabody. The kind of man I've been looking for, lots of money and no resistance. Old Peabody's the family lawyer. This is great. Well, I don't think it's so funny. We must tell Brad's brother the truth. The truth about what? The truth about Carol not being me. No, you've got to go on with it. He thinks he's pretty darn smart. Take him for a ride. You said it. Let's go on playing this game. Gee, it's for prizes. Look what I got already: Gold, platinum, animals. That's nothing compared to what I'm going to get out of Fanny. Well, I don't think it's right. - It's going to cause Brad more trouble. - Hey, listen. I could do something that'd make him come to Polly on his knees... and beg her to marry Brad. - I've got an idea. - That's right, honey. ""Use well before shaking."" We're going to have a lot of unnecessary trouble. But I'd marry Polly with or without his consent. - I want to get even with him. - I want a chauffeur with a car. I want a chauffeur with buttons and a uniform. And I want a dog. I want a dog named Fanny. Buy the little doggie for Trixie. What do you want the beast for? Then I'll have something to remember you by. What name do you wish to engrave on the collar, madam? Fanny. It's not that kind of a dog. His name is Fanny. It's a pet name. Every time I look at my dog, I'll think of you. Then I'll have two little Fannys. Here, hold him while I powder my nose. - Shall we dance? - Certainly. Why not? I thought this was my dance. Sorry, Bob. Why don't you dance with this nice young lady? Thanks. I'll dance with whom I please. - Shall we indulge? - Why sure, what can I lose? My brother's jealous. He has no reason to be. I am not prepared to say that. Well, then, I'll say it for you. You're as light as a heifer, a feather. You know... I'm much more the sort of man for you, Polly. Yes, you have your good points. Let's dance, honey. Don't look at me that way. He may see you. Am I registering jealousy or am I not? No, you're wonderful. Watch it. Look jealous. Here they come. Come on, honey. Let's dance. I bet you think it's bolder, dancing this way. I think it's delightful. - I'm a clumsy soul. - You're a dear. - I'm getting old. - Aren't we all? Say, I'm a little bit old myself. You, old? Why, you're the very personification of youth. Thanks, but honest, I don't know what's the matter with me. I have a yen for a little house in the country... and the fireside... and carpet slippers for the old man. Who's the old man? You'd run if I told you. I couldn't run very far. I'm very fat. Say, can you imagine me getting sentimental? The most hard boiled dame on the Dirty White Way. You're not hard boiled. That's just on the surface. Underneath, you're... Say, what do you know about me underneath? I mean... I know what you mean, you old sugar. You watch out. I'm falling in love with you. Hello, boy. When love comes at my age... Guess who? - It's little Fay. - Yes. It's little phooey. Fay, darling, I have something to show you. - Will you excuse us, please? - Surely. - Can you see that? - See what? Can you read where it says exit? - Exit. - You said it. You start walking, and you keep walking. And if you ever come near him again, I'll break both your legs. - I could easily resent that. - Scram. Did little Fay cry out? No, that must've been the cornet you heard. Pardon me, but I think this is my dance. - I'm so sorry. - Quite all right. Beautiful, isn't it? Yes, beautiful. You know, I've been watching you and wondering... You're so obviously a girl of breeding. - Who are your people? - My father? My father was an official in the government service. Her father was a letter carrier. Mother was an invalid. Her mother could have licked John L. Sullivan. Then how did it happen? What are you doing in the theater? Well, you see, it was like this. I was at finishing school... when my parents died. - And they left me... - An orphan. Yes, an orphan. I had to find something to do, earn money. And all I could find was... Well, you see? I do see. You're the sort of child who... the sort of girl who... Not cheap, not vulgar. Not at all like people in the theater. You know, you are the girl my brother should be interested in. - Well, I don't like that. - Neither do I. So we're all too vulgar for J. Lawrence Bradford. - No. Not at all. - All except this nice little girl. - I'm too cheap and vulgar. - No. I didn't mean that. I'm going home. I'm not going to stay and be insulted like this. Polly. I'm getting lonesome. Polly, you misunderstood me. I think you're... Here I am, honey. I want to make you understand that... I wouldn't offend you for anything in the world. Let's forget it. How about another drink? Here. I'll forgive you. Bottoms up. I want to say... About you... Like me? Like isn't the word. It goes deeper than that, Polly. I don't understand it myself. - I love you, Polly. - You're drunk. - No, I'm not... - Yes, you are. You're drunk. I love you, Polly. You don't mean a word you're saying. You're just playing, aren't you? I am, you know. Stop it. Oh, you are drunk. - Who is it? - It's me, Trixie. - Where's your key? - Here it is. I can't manage it, my fingers are frostbitten. - Where'd you leave Fanny? - I left Fanny behind. He's waiting. Well, what's the matter with him, sleeping sickness? He passed out. Well, he doesn't have to pass out all over our lounge. - Say. - Say what? Have I an idea? Ask me, ""Have I an idea?"" - Have you an idea? - Listen. - We'll stick him into bed, your bed. - Oh, no, you don't. Don't get excited. You'll sleep with me. Then, when he wakes up in the morning... will we have him where we want him? Will he do just what we want him to do? - Ask me, will he? - I don't like it. You want to get even with him, don't you? Yes, I do. Can't you see, when he wakes up in the morning... what will he ask himself? What would anyone ask himself? ""What has happened?"" he will ask himself. ""What am I doing in this girl's bed?"" He will ask himself. And how many answers are there to that? You tell me. Oh, but nothing will have happened. Of course not, nothing will have happened. - You said it. - But he'll think... Say, you know what he'll feel like? He'll feel like, what do they call them? Oh, yes, a cad. - It's a bet. I'll do it. - You take his head. No. You take his head, I'll take his feet. I don't want to look at him anymore. Say, you know, I thought you were getting kind of stuck on him. Don't be stupid, Trixie. I was just putting on a good act. A very good act. You certainly fooled me. Okay, dearie, here you go to bed. There, now, my little man. If you think I've fallen for that apple-cheeked boyfriend... I've been chiseling. Say, you'd be surprised what plans I have for him. And will he be surprised. Say, I'm going to take him like Graham took Waterloo... or whatever he took. And when he Wakes up in the morning When he wakes up in the What's this? - It can't be. It isn't. - It is. - How did he get there? - He passed out, so we tucked him in. This is wonderful. This is marvelous. - I'm afraid we've gone too far. - Gone too far? - Yes. - No, this is only the beginning. I have to run. I've something important to attend to. I'll be back in an hour. So, my dear brother, you'll cut off my income, will you? Won't let me marry Polly, will you? Well, listen, old fellow, you don't know it yet... but you're going to wake up a kinder and a wiser man. Good morning. - Good morning. - How would you like your eggs? Where do you think you're going? Do you think you can do what you did last night and get away with it? Ruin a young girl's future just because she loves you? I don't know where I am, or what you're saying. That's too bad. I'll tell you where you are. I know where I am, all right. I mean, figuratively speaking, I'm confused. - I don't know what happened. - Well, I do. Plenty, brother, plenty. Tell me... - now what do you want me to do? - Sit down. - How much is it worth to you? - Worth? What for? Call it payment for a night's lodging, if you like. You don't mean it. - Polly doesn't know... - Listen, what do you think Polly is? I never would have believed it. But why not? What else could I expect? You said it. What else? I know what you need, a pen. $5,000, is that satisfactory? What do you think this is, the Mills Hotel? $10,000, then. And that's all I'll do. Well, don't feel generous. It's not so much. - That's your opinion. - The pen? And now, have you any objection if I go on my way? Objections? Let me open the door for you. - Thank you. - Come back when you can't stay so long. I've got it. - Got what? - Rest your eyes on that. - What's the matter, isn't it enough? - I don't want it. I don't want any of it. Say, what's the matter with you? I knew it. You are carrying the torch for that Back Bay codfish. I'm not. I hate him. Sure you do. Why he's got no more feelings than a hyena. He has, too. Don't you talk that way about him. Why? We've just been playing him for a sucker. He's just a chump. He's not a chump. He's kind, and he's good. Sure, you hate him, all right. No, I don't. I love him. I've never felt so happy in all my life. I've got a confession to make. Well? Well... Last night... I told Miss Lorraine, Trixie... that I cared for her deeply... and she admitted an equal affection for me. For the first time in my life, true love... real love, with a real woman. Look. Look at that. - I've been tricked. - You certainly have. That's the girl. That's the girl Robert planned to marry all along. The one I intended to save him from. There's no doubt about it. They've certainly made a fool of you. - What about you? - Who, me? Well, I... Did you know? If you knew, why didn't you tell me? What do you think I brought you along for, anyway? To heave ponderous, ridiculous sighs at that giraffe? Who are you calling a giraffe, sir? - I've a suspicion it's the woman I love. - You love. You give me a pain. You're coming along with me. - I'll show them I'm not such an easy mark. - Where to? To that woman's house. The one who posed as Polly Parker, who led me on. I'm not going with you. I can't. - Why? - Well... I have a dinner engagement. - A conference. - All right, I'll go by myself. But I'll show her. But I never said your brother wanted to marry me... and I never said my name is Polly. - I took that for granted. - You take too darn much for granted. - I'll ask you to return my check, please. - Your check? That's on exhibition over there on the wall. I knew you'd probably stop payment on it. - I'll take the necessary steps... - You'll do what? Listen, you made a sap out of yourself... and you tried your best to make a sap out of me. Now I never want to see you again, understand? And as for your check... Well, you don't think I hold myself as cheaply as all that, do you? - Cheaply? $10,000? - That's your estimate of me, not mine. That check is framed, not cashed. I put it there to remind me... never to get mixed up with your kind again. Now get out, will you, please? Get out. No, I will not get out. - You must. - No, I will not. Not until I've told you what I think of you. Don't you dare. Get out. I was drunk the last time. I'm not now. I mean it. I love you, Polly. - My name's not Polly. - Whatever your name is. Carol, that's my name. Cheap and vulgar Carol. Daughter of a Brooklyn saloon keeper and a woman who took in washing. Carol, the torch singer at Coney Island, cheap and vulgar. Every time you say cheap and vulgar, I'm going to kiss you. Cheap and vulgar. Cheap and vulgar. Cheap and vulgar. I didn't mean to fall in love with you. I was only playing a game. I didn't mean to fall in love with you, either. I was trying to play a little game myself. You're going to forgive Brad and Polly, aren't you? - No, I'm not. - But you must. - Lf they're married... - They are. - They phoned me from the city hall. - I'll have their marriage annulled. - But you said... - I don't care what I said. I was confused, upset. Maybe you're confused about us. No, that's one thing I'm sure about. But their marriage is off, definitely off. Well, then so is ours. - You mean you won't marry me? - I certainly do. - I'm late. The show. Sorry. - Polly... - See you later. - Carol. You haven't told me. We've got to settle this. Carol.

Come on, honey. - Hello. - Hello. I got him signed, sealed, and delivered. Good girl. Keep him close to home. Here, wait a minute. I understand you two are married. - I'm going to have it annulled. - You can't annul our marriage. Not yours, stupid, his. - You can't do that. - Yes, I can. You've interfered enough. We're married, and we're going to stay married. Today you asked me to marry you. - He did? - Yes, he did. Yes, I proposed, and I was sincere. If you do this to Polly and Brad... I wouldn't marry you if you were the last man on Earth. I told you that once, and I meant it. Much as I love you, nevertheless, I am determined... to look after my brother's interests, whether he likes it or not. Arrest him. You have a warrant. Perjury. Falsification of age in obtaining a marriage license. You can't hold me on that. Technically, we can, pending an investigation. Brad, what are we going to do? What's holding up the show? Do you want to ruin me? My brother just had me arrested for getting married. Arrested? Where's the cop? Here he is. Detective Jones. Detective, my eye. He's a ham actor. That's no way to speak of an artist. Why, I've played with Sir Henry Irving... George Arliss, and David Warfield. Scram. You're a washout.

Will the passengers please report to the information desk? - Thank you.  - What about the navy? - I have to be in Chicago tomorrow.  - Youll have to wait your turn sir. - You think we'll still make Chicago by morning?  - If I knew that I'd tell you, sir, these days are worse than the war.  - Any chance of another flight? - Look let me get you a hotel room.  - Meaning no chance. May as well relax. - Might even enjoy it.  - Youll like the Sheraton, it's a nice hotel. Oh, thats it, sailor, I have to be going. Well why don't we go together? I mean some nice quiet place, huh? - Oh it's a business appointment!  - Business? This time of night? I know it's terrible, isn't it? But that's the way it is. Just when i meet a girl that can dance... Say how about next week? I got a leave, can you be here? - Well I guess. If i'm still in Lincoln.  - Yeah. Don't you live here? You call this living? - Okay, lady, hop in.  - Who me? I don't want a cab. Hey hold it, I do. Excuse me. Sheraton Hotel. - Hi. - Hi! - I'm not late.  - Oh you're never late. I'm early. - Do I look alright?  - Oh more than alright. And you always do to me. Well for Mr. Venner do I look alright? Too good for Mr. Venner, whoever he is. Another salesman? Oh no, he's a real honest-to-goodness manufacturer, and he says he's always on the lookout for new designers. - On the lookout or on the make?  - Oh, Curt. He's a very busy man but he did take time out to look at my sketches. Oh sure 11 o'clock at night in his hotel room. It is not in his hotel room, it's in the lobby. - Funny?  - Well you'd think so if you saw Mr. Venner. - You want me to wait for you?  - No, I'd only worry about keeping you waiting. - Wish me luck? - Sure. I'm on your side, Rae. In anything. - A girl has to be crazy not to be in love with you.  - Alright. You get the minister and I'll get the psychiatrist. Night, Curt. Excuse me. Again that is. - Are you all right?  - Uh-huh. - Yes, sir?  - Paul Saxon. I believe I have a reservation. - That's right. - I may get a call from the airport, no matter what time it comes--  - We'll put it through. Would you please tell Mr. Venner that Miss Rae Smith is in the lobby? Now Miss Smith, Mr. Venner is expecting a long-distance call. He asked that you go directly to his suite, 303. Captain, we're a little short-handed. Would you mind? Three, please. Ah Miss Smith, do come in. My goodness, Mr. Venner. Must be a terribly important phone call you're expecting. All in your honor, my dear. I've been looking forward to seeing you. Well then why don't you turn on the lights? I don't glow in the dark, you know. - But you do, my dear, you do indeed. - Flatterer. I put color swatches on most of these sketches. Yes I'm sure they'll be fine, now why don't you just sit down and relax, huh? And we'll have a little champagne. You know it's amazing, a little wine makes business a pleasure. Uh, these sketches are all complete outfits, and I've indicated accessories. Now now now, time for that later on, when we're better acquainted. A toast to your future. Well I'll feel more like toasting my future after you've looked at my sketches. - Now don't be coy. - Oh I'm not being coy, Mr. Venner. - I'm very serious about being a designer. - Well then relax. We'll finish the champagne and then well look at them. - Let's look at them now please. - Not now! When then? Tomorrow? Or shall I just leave them? Say what is this some kind of a game? I go to all the trouble of ordering champagne and-- Say what's your hurry? I'm sorry, Mr. Venner. I'm afraid I misunderstood you. After all you did say to meet you in the lobby and well, I didn't think it would take very long. - He's downstairs waiting for me. - Who's waiting? Why my, um, fianc of course. Your fianc? What kind of a fianc would let you come to a man's room at this hour? Well he didn't want to let me but I told him it would just take a few minutes, and he's apt to come looking for me. - Oh yeah? Well we'll just relax until he shows up, Because my dear I do not believe one word of your story. Now come on try a little more champagne. Relax. I can help you get ahead but it's not a one-way street you know. - Not one-way, dead-end! - Now wait a minute! You stop that! Stop it! Yes? Who is it? Is Miss Rae Smith there? A marine... - I forgot to tell you, he's a marine. - I hate to interrupt a business meeting but... Well you know, Rae, I'm due at the airport very soon and if you're gonna see me off... It's been very pleasant, Mr. Venner. Why didn't you just flatten the old goat and walk out? Oh I don't know. Maybe it's because I wanted so much for it to work out, and maybe... You know the worst part? He was trying to seduce me with champagne! Domestic champagne, yet! Oh that's wonderful! So are you! Have you any idea how grateful I am? I thank you. I do thank you. That's what a marine is for. Good night, marine. - I'll never forget you.  - Do you have to go? I mean, can I buy you a drink? - That's your phone.  - Yes I know, but... Well, don't run off... wait. Promise? Hello? Yes this is Saxon. Oh, cancellation, good, I uh... I mean I can't make it. That's right. I'll take my chances. That's what I said. I'll take my chances. Let's see the town. Are you crazy? Ironing in the middle of the night? Potatoes?? You're cooking potatoes! Oh Janey, men like potato salad don't they? All men? Even sophisticated men? Oh, you came to the right party alright. I know all about sophisticated men. And potatoes. They're done. What do you want with potato salad at...? 3:30 in the morning! Well... did you ever hear of a picnic without potato salad? No! I thought we'd go out to Big Chief Lake. Big Chief Lake. Gee I havent been out there since... Who's we? Paul Saxon. Oh you don't know him, he's not from around here, I just met him tonight. - Mommy, can I have a glass of milk?  - What are you doing out of bed? Marilyn, it's still night time, honey, now will you get back to bed? Oh Janey, let her stay up for a while. You're the boss where she's concerned. There's a sweetheart. There we go. Keep your eyes on the road, driver. Why? don't you feel safe with me? Certainly not. Does anybody? You know, we really didn't have to start this early, but I'm such an early bird. I'm glad we did. I want this to be a long long day. Say, I've been meaning to tell you ever since we drove by your store last night. You and I are in the same business. I have some department stores too. - Some?  - Well it's a family business. My grandfather started it. The Saxon Stores. Are you that Saxon? - I hope you don't mind.  - Not too much! You know, I was beginning to wonder what you and I could possibly have in common. Were you, indeed? I wasn't. I knew. Right away. - What are you sketching? Let me see. - No not yet. In a minute. There's an old legend. At certain times of the year, a girl can see her sweetheart's face in the lake. That is if she's... you know... Pure of heart. Please. Make it mine. From you. Just Rae? Oh that's how I see myself when I become a famous designer with my own salon. That's my signature, all small letters. Very chic, don't you think? You're really serious about being a designer aren't you? - It's all i ever wanted to be. - Why don't you do something about it? I do whenever I can! Why else would I bother with a man like Venner? Oh no, that's hoping. Hoping to be lucky, hoping for lightning to strike. I mean really get out and do it. I tried, but then my mother got sick and I had to stay and run the store. But there wasn't anybody else, my sister Janey, well... She was just married and just had a baby. That was thoughtless of me. I guess I never made a sacrifice like that. Everything I ever wanted I just reached out and took. I'm sorry. Don't be. I loved my mother, she was a wonderful woman. And when you love somebody... that's it. Just that simple? It is for me. How about you? I think we better be going. You'll want to find out about your plane. There'll always be another plane. Never another picnic with Rae Smith. Don't. Don't say it, please. Never is such a long time. Rae, I Rae! Oh, Paul, I know this is crazy but I love you, I love you! As simple as that... and as wonderful. Help yourself to more coffee on the house. I gotta get started for the morning rush. Here's your change. Do me a favor, will ya, if anybody comes in tell them to holler. You and the missus take your time. See how respectable we look? Oh, darling. For the rest of our lives let's have breakfast at four in the morning. You're an idiot. Tell me, is it normal to be so hungry and so happy at the same time? Well now, just how hungry are you, Miss Smith? Tell me first. Just how happy are you? Finish your coffee. I'll call the airport to see if there's a seat on today's plane. It's a nice idea but slightly illegal. I'd love to sit in your lap all the way to Chicago, but I don't think the airlines would allow it. You'd better get two seats. - I wish it were that simple. - Isn't it Well I've been away a long time, Rae, and... well there's the store, I... You mean a man who runs a department store can't be in love? It's the timing. Right now I have to leave you. I wouldn't leave you for all the department stores in the world. Be sensible, Rae, this is business, it's complicated. It means i have to get things straightened out. Things that never mattered before. Rae, I had a life before I got in the marine corps. Before my plane was grounded here. Before I met you. - It's another woman. - Now listen to me. Oh that's silly of me, there must be dozens of women ready to throw themselves at you. Just like I did. Rae, do you think I want just to say goodbye to you... like that? But you must. And it's hard isn't it? Well let me make it easy for you. - Wait. - Because if that's all it was to you, that's all it is to me. Goodbye, marine. Goodbye. Rae, wait. Rae, wait! I'm sorry, Mr. Saxon, but she can't talk to you right now. Tell her I turned this place over to get two tickets, and I got them. Flight 73. Tell her it leaves in 40 minutes. - I want her on it with me. - Just a minute, Mr. Saxon. Rae. Rae! You better hear this! He's using the phone at the ticket counter! He says he must talk to you! Mr. Saxon? She won't talk to you. - But she must! Tell her I love her. Tell her it'll be a mess but I don't care I can work it out. We can work it out, we have to. - But she. - No, no butts we can talk it out all the way to Chicago. And listen, tell her we have the rest of our lives to work it out! Alright, I'll do the best I can. What's your flight number again? - Okay. Rae. Rae! He wants you to go with him on the plane now! He says everything will be a mess, but he wants you to... I am trying, Mr. Saxon, but she... Hello? Operator. Operator, we've been cut off! Oh he loves you, Rae, he said so. He's waiting for you and wants you to go with him no matter what! - First they cut you off and then it's busy!  - You better try the phone booth, I got a lot of calls to make. Confirmations. - Call him back tell him I'm on my way!  - Okay. Operator? Still busy, operator. All right all right I'll wait! - Did you get him?  - No, it's still busy! Well it can't be you must have got a wrong number. Keep trying and tell him I said yes yes yes! Okay. - Rae! You write to me!  - Yes of course! - Operator isn't there another number I could call?  - But it can't be! Check it maybe it's out of order. Mister, could you drive me to the airport, I'll pay you. I'm late now, sorry. Would you give me a push to the gas station? It's straight up the road. - Okay.  - Thanks. Alright, get your foot off the brake now! - Just a moment. - Now wait! Please one moment! Okay... Oh please there must be another number! Thanks. Gas please and hurry! Flight 73 non-stop Lincoln to Chicago now boarding. Gate 7.

Park my car the keys are in it, my sister will be down to pick it up later. - Keep the change! - Last call passengers for United Airlines flight 73. Non-stop Lincoln to Chicago at gate 7 last call. - Wait! Wait! - Too late, ma'am. You could have waited... You could have waited. You knew I'd come. You can come out now, Curt's gone. - What did you tell him? I told him you were taking a nap. He's no fool, he got the message, he went bowling with Cleve. - You know, they don't come any better than Curt. - I know. He's good and kind and gentle And he's smart too, hell go places. And he worships the ground that you walk on. Look, Rae, love isn't like a a scale that's supposed to balance. There isn't a marriage in the world where one doesn't love more than the other. - Now what's wrong with Curt? - Nothing. Except that I don't love him, and I won't marry him. I can't lie and short-change him. - Well you might learn to love him you know it's happened before. - And you might leave me alone! Look I don't get you! For three weeks now you've been moaning about this Paul Saxon, you could have at least written him or called him. I did. And you know something? He's married. Oh no... - Oh that never occurred to me. - Me either. First I didn't even believe it. Not even when the butler asked me if I wanted to talk to Mrs. Saxon. I thought it was his mother. Then I looked it up in the newspaper files, real easy. Big society wedding. Darling, I'll tell you something. I'm glad you didn't get to the airport in time. I'm glad you missed that plane. - Oh, Rae honey, it isn't the end of the world!  - For me it is. So make it the beginning of another! Look. Turn around and look at yourself! Come on, just look at yourself! Oh with your face and that figure, boy I wish I had them! And you got brains and talent. - And those designs of yours - Maybe they're no good either. Well you're not gonna find out moping around here. Yes yes I guess you're right. I ought to get away. - What about the store? - Sell it! Oh honey, please sell it and go! Wake up, Rae, wake up and live now before it's too late. I knew you'd be crazy about New York as soon as you got a job. For a while I was pretty worried that your money wouldn't hold out. Bought a copy of Harper's Bazaar and saw your boss's originals, as you call them. Cleve said if I dressed like that he'd shoot me. But what a way to die. You're coming up in the world, and we are all thrilled for you. As for us, Cleves on a diet, Marilyn has a cold, and I'm the same. Guess I always will be. Love, Janey. The genius just arrived. What kind of a mood is he in today? Well if it was anyone else, rotten. For him, pretty good. Thanks, Rae. I've never seen anything like it. It's perfectly awful. And what's this thing? Give me the shears. If i hadn't designed it myself, I'd burn it. Here, take it away. I don't want to see it until the showing. Well what do you want? My sketches, Mr. Dalian. You've had them for over six months now. Perhaps you've had a chance to look at them. Do you buy all your clothes at rummage sales? I didn't buy it, I made it. And if it weren't good, you wouldn't bother to insult it. Deliver me from drugstore psychiatrists. And what's so good about it? It has lines, style, simplicity. It says something. Well, you've picked up the lingo quickly enough. I always listen when you talk to a customer. Dalian does not have customers. Dalian has patrons. And as to your sketches, I'm not sure, but I think I've seen worse. ""Dear Janey, Sorry I couldn't write sooner, but I've been working like mad and loving it. Dalian added three of my designs to his summer line. But not one kind word, compliment, or pleasant look. Then yesterday, Mrs. Oliver Banning - she's on the best dressed list every year - came in, and he introduced me as his assistant! It was the first I heard of being promoted. I didn't really believe it, but my paycheck convinced me. All these years, Janey, finally it's paid off. Love to all. Rae."" - Did you read the Tribune?  - Uh-huh. - And the Post?  - Uh-huh. -And The Times? - This year, Mrs. Whitney Ames and her debutante daughters, Susan and Lydia, stole the fashion spotlight in originals from the atelier of Dalian and his new and talented associate Rae. Don't sit there wasting my time and drooling like an egotistical idiot. Oh Dalian, I love you. I love the whole thing. - If I couldn't come here every day... - Oh stop babbling like a breathless ingenue, you don't fool me. You're a shrewd, conniving, opportunistic female. And you give me nightmares. I wake up with a cold clammy feeling that you're about to sandbag your way into a full partnership. - Of course it's only a dream.  - Well I believe in dreams implicitly. Don't you? Get out of here you monster, go to lunch! Go and rest on your laurels! And I hope there's a thorn in them! I think i'll just take a walk down Fifth Avenue and sneer at everybody's dresses except ours! How nice of you to include me. Check the accounts receivable setup. -  That's the only problem. - Yes sir, fine. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! You've got the data. Mind if I skip the meeting? Rae? Rae Smith is it really you? I don't know what to say. Say you're glad to see me. You're looking very well. You're beautiful. What are you doing in New York? So you're that Rae? All small letters. Very chic. I should have guessed. Have lunch with me. I've had lunch, thanks. Dinner? I can't. Tomorrow then. No. Not tomorrow. It was wonderful seeing you again, Paul. I'm sorry, Rae. I simply had to see you. I'm busy, I told you. - I see you found the right apartment!  - Oh yes, thank you very much. I won't ask you to sit down. I won't even offer you a drink. - You're not serious.  - Never more serious. I don't want you here. I don't know what you thought about me, or what you think now. It isn't as if we were just old friends. No I guess it isn't. But just listen to me. Please, that's all I ask. I knew when I saw you today that I'd been looking for you wherever I went. Always hoping to find you. - But never really trying.  - Because I had no right. Do you have the right now? No. But I can't help myself. Rae do you know what it's like to think of someone or want someone and not be able to do one thing about it? Please, Rae, try to understand, try. Well... Maybe that's... the way it was meant to be. Sometimes life makes these decisions for us. Yes... Yes sometimes. Like seeing you today. Like knowing you're here. No, it's too late, Paul. I'm not cut out to be the other woman. You're out of my life. It's over. Finished. And it has to stay that way. I love you, Rae. Please don't send me away. Who were you when I picked you up? A nobody. Couldn't design a shroud. - I taught you all you know!  - Please. Don't pick on me, not today. - I'll never stop being grateful to you.  - Then why do you want to quit? Better offer? I told you. It's not to work for anyone else. I have to get away. Don't ask me why. Oh I know why. He's married, of course. - And has two children.  - Oh please, please, spare me the dreary details. Although I did think you'd be above such shabby involvements. I want to be here, but... if I stay here... - Well that's why I have to get away.  - And give up everything you've won? Sink the ship to put out the fire? Do they have birth certificates in Nebraska? Birth certificates? Sure. Why? Then wash your face and stop looking like a poached egg and go downtown and get yourself a passport. We may as well collect some of that money the tourists are tossing around Rome. Everyone else is... thanks Dalian. thanks Thanks. - Buongiorno, signora!  - Good morning, buongiorno! - Good Morning, Mrs. Penworth. - Oh, good morning Miss Smith! A happy weekend, I hope? Quiet but happy. I'll be in the work room. And this morning when I opened the shop, he was already at the door waiting. I couldn't keep an American gentleman. An old friend he said. - American?  - And a gentleman I assure you. Oh I would not have let him wait in your office. Curt! Oh Curt I don't believe it! It's me alright! Come on outside, I want to get a good look at you. You are absolutely positively the last person on earth I ever expected to see here! I'm the last person that ever expected to be here. Gosh you look wonderful. Sit down. Sit down and tell me everything! I don't care if you start at the beginning, the middle, or the end, but tell me everything. Well I had some business in Turin. Oh what business? It's been so long. Like we say in Lincoln, I'm in the industrial plastics game. Like we say here, I'm in the rag business! - What are you doing in Rome?  - Well I... I wanted to see you. Oh Curt you're such a dope. You know that old saying ""see Naples and die, see Rome and live?"" I'm taking you out on the town tonight. I'm not alone. I'm with the Claypools. Charlie's one of my partners. He and his wife Marge are just dying to meet you. I'd love to meet them. and we'll start off with cocktails at my place and then I'll take you all to my favorite restaurant across the river. Rae that'll be wonderful, just wonderful. I was hoping for some of that octopus they eat here! Oh Charlie, what a silly thing to say, you know you'd be afraid to taste it! - That's his idea of a joke.  - Well the joke's on him. That's what you're gonna have for your midnight snack, I know just the place. And they even put it up in cans and you can take some back to Lincoln. Oh thanks a lot! - By the way, how is Lincoln?  - Oh it's grown so much you wouldn't know the place. Why don't you come back sometime? For a visit anyhow. I just might do that. Oh Rae, who is the man with the fez? - Ex-king Zhodeck.  - Oh Charlie, a king! Let's go to the powder room and we'll pass his table on the way. Oh good! They'll never believe this in Lincoln! Oh Paul it was a lovely party! And the baroness' yacht you know... Full moon and so romantic, a lovely orchestra. - I'm sorry you weren't there.  - More champagne? I am too, we wouldve liked being there. - Liz...  - Oh really, Paul, champagne wont hurt Liz. No, Tony! My husband doesn't want me to, I'd rather not. What's the matter, Paul? Don't get stuffy. Champagne's perfectly safe, why they use it to launch ships! I'll be back in just a minute, I want to see how the children are. - How domestic can you get?  - Relax, darling, they're perfectly safe back at the hotel. - Miss Hatfield's a jewel!  - I just want to make sure they're tucked in. I think I'd better say goodnight to them too. - What do you want?  - Just to make sure it's a phone call not a detour to the bar. What if it is? Liz, a few more drinks and you'll fall flat on your face. Let's find out. Oh! Here, let me help you. Liz, you're getting out of here. - Always the devoted husband!  - Come on. Is everything okay? Couldn't be better. - Yes, it could if you asked me to dance!  - Well then I'm asking. Rae I don't know how to thank you for taking us around, showing us everything. Marge and Charlie will be talking about this for the rest of their lives. Solid decent happy lives. I like them. - I do too, I'm glad you do.  - Curt. I want to see a lot of you while you're here. You don't have to ask me twice. I was just trying to figure out how to ask you. Let's get things lined up for tomorrow. First we'll go to the... I won't be in Rome tomorrow, I've got a business appointment. Let me know the minute you get back. The very instant. The very second, I promise. You ought to sue that restaurant. They charge enough not to have holes in their carpets. That's why I tripped. Look! Look, I think I'm getting a bruise right here. Why don't you say it? You're sick of me. I'm sick of covering up for you in public. I'm sick of pretending in front of the children. - Yes, I'm sick of the whole mess. - You and me both! I'm sick of being picked on! I'm sick of having you watch me like a policeman! I'm sick of you! Oh Paul. We haven't always been like this. Clawing at each other, tormenting each other. Let's be honest, Liz. Our marriage wasn't working a long time before I went in the marine corps. Why do you think I tried so hard to get in? Why do you think you never asked me not to go? Paul, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about tonight. I'm sorry about everything. You always are... but it never helps. You promised if we moved to Europe you'd try to change, - we've been here not quite 48 hours-- - Oh don't be such a hypocrite! You never agreed to come to Europe just because of me. You came to open more department stores. That's why you bought the house in Paris. That's why we're going to live there. Department stores! Saxon stores all over the world! Hooray for you! That's all you care about. That's all you've ever cared about. Liz. Please. Why don't you give me a divorce? Don't be such a fool, Paul. I worked much too hard getting you. I couldn't argue about a settlement. You can have everything I own. How generous! I never needed your money, I don't need it now. - Then why? - Because I have no intention of being the ex Mrs. Saxon. I know too many ex-misses wandering around paying some man's bills just for the company. Worried sick he'll find somebody else and walk out, no thank you, none of those fancy boys for me. I haven't noticed you avoiding them now. But darling that's the advantage of being married! No entanglements! It's fun for them and it's fun for me. Don't dream about a divorce, Paul. I like it this way. Put it down. I said put it down! Give it to me! I want it! Give it to me! Give it to me! I need it! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! If you do that I'll kill you! I'll kill you do hear me? I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Give me that! Dont do that! Give me that! Dont do that! You know water always makes your hangover worse. - I'm thirsty.  - Coffee. Drink it. - I don't want any coffee!  -Drink it. You'll need it before the children come in to say good morning. Children... Miss Hatfield! Caroline! Paul! Almost forgotten about the children... Not a very good mother I expect. Come on, come on. - Good morning, mother. - Good morning, dear. - Good morning, mother.  - Hi, dad! Hello, son! How's my big girl? - Hey you cut your face!  - Oh that. Shaving. I was a little careless. - Does it hurt?  - No, baby. Not anymore. Is everything ready, Miss Hatfield? We were just waiting to say goodbye to you, - then we'll be on our way. - Good. On your way? Where? - We're going to see an owl.  - Maybe even a glacier! All of a sudden? Why? Rome isn't a very good city for children this time of year, it's terribly damp. - Well I don't know, I...  - They'll enjoy it, Mr. Saxon. Well it's a long trip, darling, so you'd better get started. Say goodbye to your father. Bye, dad. - Bye, dad. - Have a good time!  - You too, Miss Hatfield. -  Thank you, sir. Enjoy your trip, darlings! You know where to reach us? - Chateau d'Or. San Tropez. - That's right. Goodbye. Have fun! How long do you think it's going to work? What do you mean? Sending the children away so you can... keep everything a secret. They're getting older. They'll start to notice. You're a very good father, you'll see to it that they don't. You're my insurance, darling. I have nothing to worry about. And I thought if I left now I'd have time for a swim. And don't worry about the shop, everything's under control. Enjoy yourself! - Hello, Paul. Hello, Rae. Your day over? Yes. Rae I... didn't just happen to be walking by here. Can't we... Just a quiet talk somewhere? Please? Please. How about a swim? It's not too far from here. The second time I tried to get a divorce, she took the children for a drive. 90 miles an hour when a tire blew. It's a miracle they weren't all killed. And that's the whole story. If the thing is wrong to begin with it doesn't get better. Only worse. I don't see how this could get worse. What's the answer if there is one? What do you want me to say, Paul? That I still love you? I do. And I love you. Now and always. But I have no right to mess up your life for the nasty bits and pieces of mine. I shouldn't have come looking for you. I'll go now. - Is that what you really want to do?  - What else can I do? I can't get a divorce. What future can I offer you? What hope? Well what do I have now? - I need you too, Paul. - There's no use pretending, Rae. I've tried to face being alone. I can't go on without you. I won't let you. I'm dreadfully sorry, Mr. Stanton, but I don't know any more now than I told you over the telephone. I don't believe it, she's been gone for three days! Well she often goes away, takes a little time to herself. - We're not at all disturbed. - I am. We made all sorts of plans, why would she just disappear without telling me where to find her? I guess that question just answered itself. - Thank you, I'm sorry if I bothered you.  - Not at all. When miss smith returns, I'll tell her that you called. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't. Please don't mention that I came by. Do you believe that in three days, a man can become an entirely different human being? Well not too different I hope. - I have a question. - Today I know all the answers. It's all those ifs. If your plane hadn't been grounded and if my car hadn't run out of gas. - And if we'll really have more days like this.  - Every one I can steal. - What a dreadful way to say it. - It doesn't matter. As long as I know we'll be together sooner or later. Even for a minute. But together. Well... I've been trying to find you for three days! Well never mind me. Where are the children? You tell me where you were, I'll tell you about the children. - Who are you calling? - Miss Hatfield. You don't have to. The hildren are here, I sent for them. When I couldn't reach you, I came back. I couldn't stay here alone, I had to have someone. I'd say you had pretty steady company. What are you gonna do about it? Just what you're gonna do about it. Nothing. You really mean that, don't you? That's quite a change in three days! Who was with you? I wanna know where you were! A woman! That's it, and she thinks you're wonderful! And you believe her! Was she expensive, darling? Was she? I'm right! I guessed it! - I warn you, Paul. If you ever look at another woman-- - It won't work, Liz. All these years I've asked, begged, pleaded for a divorce! Well not anymore. You don't have to give me a divorce, but it's all over, Liz. I gave you every chance. I crawled to try to help you. You didn't want it. Now it's too late. If you walk out of here, Paul, I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! I will, Paul! - Did you hear me?! - Yes. And a hundred times before. - Hello?  - Rae, darling. - Paul. -  Will you meet me at the beach house? I'll be about an hour. Two at the most. Mr. Saxton, come quickly, it's Mrs. Saxon! Hurry! I have to go now, I'll see you later. Hello? Oh Paul, I've been going crazy, waiting, worrying, imagining all sorts of things! And I didn't dare call you. I'm sorry. I called as soon as I could after... After what? What happened, are you all right? It's Liz. Sleeping pills. Oh no. - Is she... - She's all right now. She'll be out of the hospital tomorrow. I'm calling from there. She gets hysterical if I just talk about leaving the hospital. I haven't even been able to get to the children. The children, how terrible for them. Rae, I... I won't even be able to see you. To say goodbye. Goodbye? But I... Well when... when Liz leaves the hospital tomorrow she wants to go right home. Home? - To the states? - The house in Paris. I know it's awful to say this but... Liz knew just what she was doing. She's won and left us with nothing. Oh no. No I have so much. What do you have? Waiting? Worrying? Loving you, and knowing you love me. Oh, Paul, I have all that. Rae, I have to go now. I understand. Goodbye. Goodbye. Don't you think you should stay one day more before you go? Don't be silly, darling, it was just a touch of the flu, I'll be perfectly all right. The children are training up with the nurse, that's why we have to leave now, to meet them. - Gate 3 now boarding. - Goodbye. Goodbye. See you in Paris. How about a picture? You and Mrs. Saxon. - No, I don't think so. - Oh yes, please! Flight 51 Rome to Paris. Gate 3 now boarding. - Thank you  - Thank you. You better get me aboard, darling, I'm terribly tired. - Goodbye again. - Goodbye! Long distance? I want a place to call to Paris please. Person to person, Mr. Paul... Never mind. Hello. Can you please tell me if flight 7 from Paris will be in on time? It lands in 20 minutes? Wonderful. Oh, Mrs. Penworth. I'm going home now. And you should. You've been working nights and weekends for over a month now and it's just too much. Thanks, but don't worry about me, I'm just fine. I'll be at the apartment in 15 minutes if any calls should come. I'll have them transferred to you there just as I always do. Hello? Hello? Yes, this is Rae Smith. Oh darling. Darling, it's been so long. - Not because I wanted it to be. - I know and I'm not complaining. And you can be here after all, can't you? I've got it all planned. We'll go out to the beach house. It would be wonderful but... I just can't. But I had to talk to you. Make sure you understand. Of course I understand. And the beach house will still be there next time. Unless a high tide has washed it away. I haven't been there since the last time with you. I can't even tell when the next time we'll be. If only we weren't so far apart. It'd be an hour, even a moment when we could be together. Paul... suppose... I mean... Suppose I came to Paris to stay, to live there. - Would that be all right, Paul? - Would it? I've dreamed about it! If you only knew how many times, but... How, how can you? I'll be there. I promise. Nothing can stop me. Well when? How soon? Tomorrow? This weekend? - It'll take a little time to arrange! - A little time... When I'm waiting for you, there's no such thing as a little time. Don't you know that? Do you think I don't? Oh my darling, do you really think I don't? But Rae, I can't wait forever. I have to see you even if it's only for an instant, just to make sure you're here! I'll leave in about 10 minutes. Meet you in front of your hotel. Right. - Am I late?  - I was early! Here we are. Alone at last. Yes, sir! Alone at last! You know, I'm just beginning to realize that you're a most amazing woman! Why, because I've kept my mouth shut for the last half hour? Because you haven't asked where we're going. Couldn't matter less as long as we're going there together. Where are we going? Uh-huh, just as I suspected. Feet of clay. Well now this road goes to the airport. On the other hand, this one... Doesn't. Paul, if you don't tell me where we're going, I'll... Cancel my account at the Saxon stores. I wanted you to see this place. - Well what do you think of it? - Oh it's lovely! - You didn't! It isn't... - With all my love. Oh, Paul! It's beautiful, darling, just perfect! Well go ahead. Take a look! It's your house. Our house, Paul. Its the kind of house I've always dreamed about! I thought I'd leave the interior decoration up to you. But I did make a start at it. Paul... Do you think you can build a room around that? Why not? I built a life around it. Just be with me whenever you can, and I'll be happy here for the rest of my life. - Those shrubs over there need pruning. - You say that every time you pass them! Well next time for sure. I have to get a pair of pruning shears. That's the last time for that alibi. Here, hold this. I ordered you a pair. They'll be here in a few days. Slave driver! Well I'll see you at the airport this afternoon. - No trouble with the London reservations, was there? - Oh no, no trouble with the reservations. But I'm not sure I can go with you this time. - There's so much to do getting the new shop started. - But... Oh, darling, I know I shouldn't tease you, but that look on your face makes me feel like a new woman. You know I'll be there. Wherever you are, whenever you say. See you at the airport! Every time I look in one of these mirrors, I decide I ought to visit that wonderful little man in Switzerland! Three days and you're back in circulation! And just between us, I haven't been circulating much lately. - Good morning, Mrs. Evans. - Hello, Rae. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Oh that's quite all right! Liz, this is the famous Rae. Mrs. Paul Saxon. How do you do? I've heard a great deal about you. That's very flattering. Of course, I've seen your photographs in all the fashion magazines. Oh now don't add to her ego. She's just back from Spain, a gorgeous matador even dedicated a bull to her! - What do you think, Rae? - Well, I think a little less here, and a little more here. Matter of fact I should have stayed in Spain. I just got back this morning, and Paul's leaving for London this afternoon. Maybe I'll go with him. Oh, speaking of Paul, I saw him this morning. We were coming in from the country, and he was driving into Paris. - Driving into Paris? - Yes, in the lane right beside us. We honked and shrieked, but he didn't seem to hear us! Driving into Paris, are you sure? Well of course I'm always a little bleary in the morning, maybe it wasn't. Do you have a phone I could use? Oh yes, right in my office. Show Mrs. Saxon to the phone in my office. Oui, madame. Par ici, madame. I seem to have opened a can of beans. Well at least she isn't screaming. You know, by the time she gets through she'll probably quote me as saying, ""He had two blondes and a redhead with him."" Maybe he had it that stashed away in the trunk. Everybody knows that he's got someone. - I think we'll be ready for a final fitting in about a week. - Good! Yes, this morning. You're costing me a fortune and I have to tell you these things. I hope so, or I'll get someone else.  Sabine Air flight 74 for Milano and Brussels is ready for passengers.  Sabine Air flight 74 for Milano and Brussels is ready for passengers.  Enter by Gate 4, please. Swiss Air flight SR823 from Calcutta, Karachi, Australia, now arriving at Gate 8. Hiya, dad! Surprise! - Hello, son, it sure is! - We wanted to say goodbye! I'll only be in London a couple of days, and I said goodbye this morning! We've all just been to the dentist, Mr. Saxon, and they insisted I bring them here. Oh they did, did they? Well how was your drive? And Istanbul. Gate 1. - Hey, dad, how much does it cost to go to Istanbul? - Well I've never been there. Why? I just wanted to know. It's such a funny name. Flight 14 to Athens, Cairo, Damascus, and Istanbul. Gate 1. - Pardon me-- - Just a minute. There she is. The one with the red hair. Oh. Pardon me, but could you tell me how much it costs... Her name is Smith. No it actually is! I saw her passport, she's American. I could have told you she would be on this flight as soon as Paul Saxon picked up his ticket. Wherever he goes, she goes. - Just coincidence. - Every time? Uh-uh. Too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence. Will Mr. Randy Rosen please report to information center? Young man. Young man? Can I help you? Flight 21 Paris to London Gate 3 now boarding. Paul. Flight 21 Paris to London. - When do you leave for Istanbul? - Dad? What does it mean if something's too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence? Well I guess that means that it's no accident. That it was arranged. What's that got to do with Istanbul? Nothing. What's the matter, son? Something bothering you? I told you, nothing. Until I got your wire, I couldn't imagine what had happened. I was worried sick. Really, darling, it wasn't necessary to change your flight. How could the boy even suspect we were together? I don't know perhaps he didn't, but... I had a feeling he kept looking at me. And I almost didn't come at all. But I'm glad I did. And I'm wearing a new dress and you've never even noticed. I did. I noticed the dress. And how very beautiful you are. - And how wasted and lonely I've made your life.  - Oh that's not true, darling. My life is full and rich and wonderful. Loving you, and being loved by you. Why don't you ask me to dance? You know, in all our years together we've never danced. Of course darling, whenever you can. I love you, too. Overseas operator? Hello? Who? What? Paris, France? Quiet, everybody! Turn that thing off! Rae! Janey? Oh Janey I just had to talk to you. Oh how are you honey? Oh everything is fine, fine! But it must be Thanksgiving there. Yes. And I just wanted to wish you all a... Hello, Marilyn. How are you, darling? You cooked the turkey? Cleve? Hello there! Happy Thanksgiving to you too! Janey... You don't know how good it is to talk to you all. Janey, I'd better run now. What? What I used to say at Thanksgiving? I don't remember! Oh yes! Yes. Save the wishbone for me. Goodbye, Janey. Goodbye. I really feel guilty taking off the afternoon before the fashion show. Not much of a holiday. It's almost 5 and you deserve a rest. Now don't you worry about a thing. You've designed a magnificent line and tomorrow is going to be a crashing success, I know. I know who you are. I know all about you! Why can't you stop following my father? They don't think I know, but I do! Why don't you leave my father alone? I hate you! I-- Oh dear God. Hello? Oh, Rae! Oh, Paul. A terrible thing. What is it? It's not Liz. Oh no. No it's worse, much worse. It's Paul Jr. He knows about me. But he can't! Why that's impossible. I'll be right out. No don't, don't come here! Go to your son. It doesn't matter about me, about us. He's the one who needs you. Oh, Paul, how he needs you. Help him, darling. Help him. Yes. Hello, son. Did you have your dinner already? - I wasn't hungry. Well maybe you and I can have a bite together. But we'll talk about things-- You mean you're not going out with her tonight? I know all about her. Her name's Rae Smith. Where did you hear all that? - Who told you? - I found out. By myself. When I talked to her. I told her to leave you alone. Didn't she tell you? yes yes she did - Paul... - And I hate her. I'd like to kill her. - Sit down, son. - I don't want to hear about her! Sit down, son. I guess I always knew that... one day you and I would have to talk about... About all this. Well I kept hoping and praying it would be years away... when you were older. I'm old enough. Almost 12. So old. So young. - Listen to me, son. - I don't care what you say, you're never gonna change what I think! - Please don't judge us. Not now. - Rae Smith never hurt you or your sister-- - I don't believe you! I hate her, I wish she was dead! Don't. Don't talk like that. How can I explain things you're too young to know about? Men and women. Loving and being loved. What words do I use for something that isn't words at all? The way people meet. How they feel about each other. Do you know what I'm trying to say? Even a tiny little bit? My boy, my son! - Try to understand.  - I understand all right! - She's a no-good dirty-- - Paul! Youd better go to your room. And now, to be auctioned for the benefit of the children's hospital. I'd like to present my own personal favorite. Wedding in June. - One thousand dollars. - Thank you! - Fifteen hundred dollars! - Thank you! - Twenty-five hundred dollars. - Thank you! - Ten thousand dollars! - Thank you! $10,000 for the children's hospital. Any more? - Sold-- - Sold to Mrs. Paul Saxon! Shall we deliver the gown to your home? Don't be absurd! It's not for me! I would like it delivered, however. Doesn't matter how it fits. She'll never get to wear it anyway. You've all tried to guess, who is the woman? Or I should say... The other woman in my husband's life. That mysterious creature who turns up in London. Zurich. Rome. The one he hides away on some back street! Liz, for heaven's sake! I'd like the gown delivered to Miss Rae Smith. In care of my husband. Rae, darling. Don't. No, Paul. Everything's over. You, me, my work, it's all over! Everyone's laughing. Other people's love affairs are always funny. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters but you and me. That's not true, Paul. The children matter. And they know. Everyone knows. It's become.. Cheap and vulgar and dirty. And we'll never change that, never. - I will, I promise you, I will. - You can't. No one can.

Perhaps the walls do not have ears, but I did. If you ever hear such rumors and comments, Doa Teresa is going to know about it. Do they understand? Igen, Don Benjamin. Cernuda. Espinosa did not see? This dish should be had to the 15 room. I think even the breakfast is taking off, but do not worry, I'll take. And do not forget that must be prepared for lunch.

Pascual ... The receptionist, who was gunned down Murqua Don Diego. Igen. Megzsarolta don Diegt. - The murder of her sister? - No, I do not think so. Before he died, he said that Don Diego did not kill my sister. So he is blackmailing something else. - Do you think that Pascual had killed her sister? - I do not. They were engaged. And she loved him. This is a common motive bntnyeknl. But go on. What else can you Pascualrl? She gathered her belongings and took her sister's house. There, we could not find anything. - You are wearing them? - I do not. They knocked down and taken away from me. What has brought to the nvrrl? The murder ... Lake of the garden. The body of the disappeared. Until now. What do you mean? Mr. Olmedo. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but ... a young woman's body was found in the woods. At least two months dead. And I think that one is ... his own sister. I thought about the dates of the wedding. Barely a month ago, we engaged. But things are starting to go well. And I think that would be a perfect day on November 4. Feast of St. Charles. So your father could somehow present. What do you think? Dear idea Diego. But by then it is not already too Sofa delivery, and it would be awkward for him. Maybe you should look for another visit, is not it? What do you think of the beginning of March it? The sisters will be by then a mother. Of course. When we announce lunch. Don Bernardo! We have not been already used. It's that seized the hotels that ours have not visited? Unfortunately, all my time. But I could not refuse the invitation to the hunt. Tell me the truth, my father. I insisted to come. Ignacio! The last time I saw you, did you get any of the knobs. You are just as beautiful and charming as it always has been. They will not regret coming. And I organized a banquet in your honor. Ignacio? - Alicia! - Ignacio! Look at you! Beautiful woman've become! Don Diego Murqua. Welcome to you. I am the director of the hotel. And the groom. The current fianc, you understand. Alicia was my fiancee. - How long are we? Six-year-olds? - Seven. - Seven. - Low In our time we were good friends. And we loved to play together. We could continue the conversation with a tea? Interference? Why bother? See you later. Diego humiliated you in front of everyone. Before my mother. I do not understand how can you be so calm. We must be patient, and I do like him. Wait for mistakes and to take advantage of it. Wait? Ez a whole? Good plan for aging. But the hotel management of the acquisition are not. You know Diego is the way I am. Are you sure that more and more messy transaction. These things leave their mark. - We have to go into his study. - Do not be naive, Sofa. Do you really think that Diego is compromising anything there? Everyone nose before? If you would eldugnia before thee, leave it in the middle of the foreground kells. If you want to hide something important, I would use the hotel vault. We know where preserves the key? Sofa, I will not scan Diego's room. - You're a coward. - I do not. I am careful. The server must be careful and have the room for girls. You or Marquis. That's why I'm not going to walk the halls like a common thief. Forget Diego. It may be that he was the manager, but we will soon be our brand. And our child is born. It is no longer just a job, Alfredo. Diego humiliated you in front of my family, and it can not stay like this. Why are not these kivasalva tablecloths? New, so I think you do not have to iron them. Who gave you this? - I'm your assistant. - Beln. The decisions are mine to make. It is your responsibility to elvgeztesd them. As early as the first day you're making mistakes. It was impossible to kill them in time. A good housekeeper is able to do the impossible. Take them and learn from his lesson. Or another, more suitable helper to look for, and it would not take long. Ksznm, Dona Angela. I will not forget these lessons when you replaced the honeycombs. Once. That should take place within 5 months. No frowned upon, if you are breast-feeding a housekeeper leave her job. Angela. Someone needs replacement, bed linen Senor Murqua room. Azonnal, Miss Sophia. Beln, go. And if you are ready, the table cloths are ironed out. What are you waiting for? Open up. - Once you're done, clean up the room. - Yes, ma'am. - Are you done? - No, ma'am. You can do your job. We found him in the river. Already overgrown with weeds. At least two months dead. It will be very unpleasant sight. Are you sure you're ready? Again. Please. I'm sorry. It is not. He had dark hair. And it was not so stout. It did not Cristina, that's for sure. - Senor Olmedo, a lot of time has passed. - I do not know who it is, but not my sister. Hernando, please. Check the archive if there are such, that seemed to be Young girl in recent months. If it's not your sister, the situation is complicated, Senor Olmedo. So far, only Jimena, the girl's body was found in the street, maybe he remembers. And we assume that your sister died. I have not two woman. But from three. Here, the best coffee I could find. Awful. It's not like the hotel. I'm not used to their server. To this girl died? They were stabbed. A scar is the same as the murdered prostitutes. Do you think that your sister is so dead? The judging from his clothes found bloodstains, very likely. - Do you know who this woman? - No, no, no, sir. - Nobody disappeared? - On the contrary. Several people also. During the past four months it disappeared Cantalobl and krnykrl. A street girl Jimena. August 24th A maid Cristina Olmedo. July 25th A peasant girl Dorotea Prieto. June 25th The description corresponds to the miserable, who lies in our makeshift ravataloznkban. But proceed. A sewing girl Adela Gmez. May 27th Another peasant girl Irene Castao. April 27th And a beggar, whom he called 'Swallow' and whose disappearance is the most difficult to define. It was in March. All they killed during the night or disappeared Cantalobl. - And it was all young. - Do you think that one person did it? The opposite would be strange coincidence. Olmedo Seor, I am afraid that his sister was a victim of obsessive compulsive, that psychiatry 'lack of moral health as' recognized and who commit ritual murders. I soon learned that this Jimena stabbed with a knife, Dorotea and that wound was perfectly match it. I fear that the other woman also died the same way. But let's see the dates. Roughly one victim a month. Or a month. I do not know much about the moral similar things. But I come from peasant families. Sowing and harvesting, and the moon align. It is possible. Perhaps the art dates from the moon are aligned. It would not be the first case. Jimena day after the arrival of the hotel was killed. And there was a full moon. I remember. And when will the next? But ... Do you think he's going to kill again? Yes. But it will be a problem. We have the weapons. It is a pity that our families were so far away from each other so much time. The years spent here were really happy .... We were children. The kids are always happy. Yes. And I thought it was all still remain, and the game becomes a reality, remember? - Ignacio, I'm the bride. - I know I know. And what you want? Yes. So the best for me and my family. Would I believe if you had answered yes. Because if you really love someone, there is no need for arguments. Ignacio, if you'll excuse me for a moment. - I'll start with lunch. - Just be a minute. July! I was worried. Ayalval Why did you leave? He realized who I was. How did you know it? I do not know, but it does not matter. He realized he was looking for the same thing. How many things have happened. He unearthed another dead woman. And he believes the killer will try again today. He thinks the same way. Gold is one of the knife. The detective and his men to watch all the exits. I do not have to verify that no knife is missing or not. And why is not he doing it? According to Ayala mother she did not really want to help him. It is open. That can not be. July, my ez to ruha rajtad? Miss Alarcon. Andrs, do not know where the gold dinnerware? In the dining room. Don Bernardo Alonso honor for lunch. And do Benjamn up there waiting for us. So get dressed and come up as soon as possible. Anyone can take it away with a golden knife. - This complicates the situation. - What situation? Andrs, you have to help us. The lunch will be four tables. Each of them will have a golden knife dinner services. Which one for you, Andres? Andres? - Is something wrong, Andrs? - No, no, Seorita Alarcn. If there is the entrance, it's mine. Fasztalnl I will be with my family. - It will be mine. - He will sit in the general's daughters. Barreda's table and left without a Biro felgylet. With what? Investigation ... what are you doing here? Do not worry, Doa Teresa. I'm not here as an investigator. Even a man like me, you need to relax. This is understandable. But as I recall, we were not invited to this lunch. Barreda referee was kind to invite me to his table. And stop you to try the legendary cuisine, it would be a sin. Mr. Ayala, I do not want you to think, to feel any resentment towards you. Due to my work I'm so used to such treatment, I would feel strange if my presence does not bother anyone. Well, I'm sorry, but I need to feel the ill effects corpse to you. And I hope you do not mind having Barreda. But it would be an honor to know you at your table. And I accept it. - Senor Murqua. - I'm busy. I can not think about that Doa Sofa opened its me your room. And you did it? What could I do? Doa Teresa's daughter ... and said I need to peel off your bedding, but ... - It was not the reason. - And what were you doing in my room? I do not know. But krbeszaglszott everywhere. Why did you tell me? They had problems with Diego, but I want you to know that I'm on your side. I'm glad to hear that. With kerestetek? - I do not know what you mean. - You were in my room, right? - You can play the fool on, Sofa ... - Diego, do not ... Do not you dare! What were you doing, Sofa? I know that you did not find anything, because I'm not hiding anything. Does not occur anymore, understand? I told you. Look at what happened. What happened to Alfredo? Diego raised his voice slightly. Or a boy, or a grown-up man? Diego knows what you did. And did not you do anything with it. We are worse off than before. It is impossible to be self-realized. An ally told him. There is a maid who can not afford to lose sight Beln. Doa Angela segdje. Can you come in? ngela, please. I guess you know why called you.

This solves every problem, is not it? For my part, the problems have been resolved, Beln. I'm going to miss? Many things will be missing. One thing will be missing here. This is not the appropriate moment. Others will no longer be. You have to be satisfied with what it was. Don Bernardo, I'm here. I'm sorry, but my offer to be involved. Why? I found out you're pregnant. I can not let my housekeeper In the first months of the hotel to go to give birth. - Who told you? - I was. Did you really think that I do not know who goes and who stays in the hotel, you? Now I should say that if you have already packed up, then leave. The traitors deserve. But I do not do it. Due to the child? Deal. And five more months to complete a part of you. Hold. But that's a lot of money. Who gets the child? I do not want money in exchange for the questions. Yes, ma'am. This changeover will take effect after five months. That left the szlsedig. Until then, you can not get to it, but it's yours. To remind you that you owe me. - And then? - You leave the hotel.

You pushed him off. Now we have no one to stand between us. How could you do with your sister? And that he would have taken it, I liked best? Come here, Javier. I'll tell everyone what you've done. And I tell you, it was you. And who would believe it? An upper-class girl ... or a drunken fall. If you're not mine, nobody will, Javier. We have time until tomorrow to ask my father to renew our engagement. Or I'll tell everyone you're my sister pushed him out. No. No no no ... - What happened? - No, my father. Javier scared me, but I do not think it was intentional. Of course not. Stay away from the lnyaimtl. The Cernuda has been mild shock. So you can get back to work tomorrow. I am glad that Andrs fine. And Seorita Herrera? Serious condition. But fortunately there are still among us. All right. Thank you, Benjamn. The reason I wanted to come to my father, to restore family relationships, and what he did, excuse me, is despicable. - It's business, Ignacio. - I do not. It ruined the family's reputation. Alicia, forgive me. I did not know what my father made. If I had not I make every effort to come. Although I would not see you again. I do not know what happened, Ignacio. But ... whatever it is, I know I can trust you. A message for you, Seorita Alarcn. ""I need to see you. I do not want what happened ruin our relationship. We need to talk.

Relax. - Felksrlek. - It is not necessary, thank you. We should not meet here. They stole one gold knife. Ayala tries to find the culprit. - You've come to tell me that? - To ask you, take care. And to explain things. Cecilia. This is what the ""C"" which is tattooed on my arm. Blancarban I fell in love. Because of him I got to prison. And why you were carried out in prison? He spoke to a woman who has been very valuable jewels and ... - ... And made me steal them away. - And you robbed? Again. I gave Cecilia, take care of them. The next day, the police arrested. No I owed to him and the prison tattooed myself in my first letter. A little later I learned that Cecilia betrayed to save himself. He fled with jewels, and I did not hear from him again. And I did not want you to think that's why I came to the hotel. Therefore, I do not tell. Well, that's the story. I always had a talent for it ... They fell in love, whom he should not. And trust the wrong man. Alicia. Diego, what happened? Who is it? I do not know what you're talking about. Do not lie to me. ""I need to see you. I do not want what happened ruin our relationship."" What happened? What's between you and the person from this? It was me. I sent the message. Ignacio! No, no, no, no! No, stop! Stand down, please! - Do not! No! Stop! - What happened between you, Alicia? - Nothing, nothing, nothing happened. - Stop! I sent a message to apologize for the crime of my father. I do not want to ruin our friendship, that's it. That's right. Just wanted to ask for forgiveness. Free. I'm sorry about what happened, Diego. You do not have to explain, it was all a misunderstanding. You can too. Ignacio was not supposed to strike. Especially not in front of the guests. It was not a big deal. Neither shocks nor humiliation. Therefore I do not feel bad. I always control myself. Very well. But most of us are, I feel for you, it is too much. It was right. This behavior only farther away. And I'm really sorry. I apologize. For having doubted you. The reason why I thought I'd be able to lie to ... To see you with someone while you're planning to come to me. No, Diego. If there is something that needs to be made, it is forgiven. Javier? Where are you going? To find this Ayala detective to justice. Drunk in the middle of the night? What are you saying? You know what happened to Mercedes-winds, the general's daughter? Accident.

I wanted to thank the messaging thing. - I want to explain everything ... - I'm your friend, Alicia. The friends are not waiting for an explanation. - Too bad you have to go already. - Yeah, too bad.

Last night Cantaloba I went to talk to the police. - What did you tell them? - The truth. They do not believe you, and I say it was you. Witness, too. One man who rushed to help your sister, she saw me. - You can not do this to me, Javier. - Leave me alone and I'm not saying anything. I did it because I love you. You own it. We can be happy, Javier. ""Dear Father! The former fiance, Javier changed my life a nightmare. First he cheated my sister, then he pushed from the balcony to get rid of him. I'm afraid of my father. Javier sworn to kill me if I tell you what he did Mercedes-Nations. "" Detective Ayala ... Miss Alarcon. You do not know how much paperwork associated with a murder. As I am now in relation to the crime. Do you know something that we can help the sinner? Last night someone chased me into the hotel hallway. A golden knife. - He recognized the levy? - I do not.

What has been the beginning should have done. You will duel with me. What happened in Sofia? My mother, I know the kid who wants to give me, that of the maid. - I do not want that kid. - This is the time to visit? - That child is Diego. - I no longer need the child. - But you said ... - Do not ever interrupt me. It's called the Ruta plant. Two spoonfuls is enough to get rid of the kid. Sofa, is not found in this image, neither of these. But why would he do that? To kill a maid? So you terminate the engagement. You do not have to stay any side, whom you do not trust. Because you do not feel anything for him. You slept with a whore. What else are you hiding from me yet?

She hasn't had a thing yesterday or today. - Send her meals up regularly? - Yes, sir. - Why don't you jam it down her throat? - It's not as simple as that, Mr. Andrews. I'll talk to her myself. Have some food brought up to her. Yes, sir. I'm not going to eat until you let me off this boat! Come, now, Ellie. You know I'll have my way. Not this time, you won't. I'm already married to him. You're never going live under the same roof. I'll see to that. Can't you get it through your head King Westley and I are married? Definitely, legally, actually married. It's over. There's not a thing you can do. I'm over 21. So is he. Would it interest you to know while you've been on board... I've been making arrangements to have your marriage annulled? ""Annulled!"" I'll have something to say about that, and so will King. I expect him to. The vittles. Come in, come in. I told you not to bring any food in. Wait a minute. This isn't for you. Put it right down here. Smart, aren't you? So subtle. Strategy, my dear. I suppose it was strategy sending gorillas to drag me from that justice of the peace. Your idea of strategy is a lead pipe. I've won a lot of arguments with a lead pipe. Outside the fact you don't like him, you haven't got a thing against King. - He's a fake. - He's one of the best fliers in the country. You married him only because I told you not to. You've been telling me what not to do since I can remember. Because you've always been a stubborn idiot. I come from a long line of stubborn idiots! Don't shout so. You may work up an appetite. I'll shout if I want to! I'll scream if I want to! - All right, scream. - If you don't let me off... I'll break every piece of furniture in this room! Here, now. Have a nice piece of juicy steak. You don't have to eat it. Just smell it. It's a poem. Oh! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellen! - Lower the boats! - Lower the boats! Catch her! Catch her!

You imagine Ellie Andrews riding a bus? I told the old man it was bunk. Ticket for New York, please. - Here's your ticket. - Thank you very much. - Here. - Oh, thank you, thank you. What's going on? I'd like to use that phone. Go away. This is history in the making. - What? - There's a man biting a dog in there. Attaboy, Petey, old boy! I can't stand this any longer. - In a pig's eye, you will! - That's telling him! Listen, monkey face, when you fired me... you fired the best newshound your filthy scandal sheet ever had. You wouldn't know a newspaper story if it kicked you in the pants. Yeah, I got all your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? That was free verse, you gashouse palooka. What was free about it? It cost this paper dough... and it's not gonna cost us any more. Mr. Gordon, he reversed the charge on that call. What? Why, you... Say, listen, you. When you get back to New York... keep far away from this office. You're fired. You don't work here anymore, and you never will. What did he say? Oh, so you're changing your tune? You're late with your apologies. I wouldn't go back to work for you if you begged on hands and knees! I hope this will be a lesson to you! That's telling him, isn't it? Did we tell that baby? - Won't give me any more of his lip. - You tell him! I guess he knows now how I feel about his job. - I'll bet he does too. - Is my chariot ready?

Make yourself comfortable with a pleasant pillow. Hey, driver! If you'll move those newspapers, I'll have a seat. Hey, wait a minute! - What do you think you're doing? - Huh? The papers... what's the idea of throwing them out? Oh, the papers? That's a long story, my friend. I never did like sitting on newspapers. I did it once, and the headlines came off on my white pants. It actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They just followed me around town and read the news off the seat of my pants. Oh, fresh guy? What you need's a good sock on the nose. Listen, partner... you may not like my nose, but I do. I always wear it out in the open... where if anybody wants to sock it, they can. Oh, yeah? That's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago. Oh, yeah? If you keep that up, we're not going to get anywhere. Oh, yeah? You got me. Yeah! Excuse me, lady... but that upon which you sit is mine. - I beg your pardon? - Now, listen. I put up a stiff fight for that seat... so if it's just the same to you, scram. Driver, are these seats reserved? No. First come, first served. - Thank you. - Hey, driver. These seats accommodate two, don't they? Maybe they do and maybe they don't. Thank you. Move over. This is a ""maybe they do."" If you'd ask me real nice, I might put that bag up there for you. Next time you drop in, bring your folks. Red-hot coffee, folks. Yes, sir. Come on inside and enjoy yourselves. Hot dogs, folks. You can't enjoy the ride unless you put something in your stomach. Rest station. Fifteen minutes. - We'll only be here 15 minutes. - Red-hot coffee. Right around there, boss. Yes, sir! Red-hot coffee. Hot dogs. You can't enjoy the ride unless you put something in your stomach. He got away. I suddenly found myself in the brush and not a sign of the skunk. I don't know what you're raving about, young man, and furthermore, I'm not interested. Well, of all the... Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone. - Oh, my heavens, it's gone! - I knew you'd catch on eventually. Oh! What am I going to do now! Don't tell me your ticket was in it. No, I've got that, but not my money. All I have is four dollars. You can wire home for more when you get to Jacksonville. No, I can't... Yes, I guess I will. - I'll tell the driver about your bag. - No! Thank you. I'd rather you didn't. Don't be a fool. The company ought to make good. - What's your name? - I don't want it reported. That's ridiculous. The company will take care... Can you understand English? Would you please keep out of my affairs? I want to be left alone. Why, you ungrateful brat. Board! All aboard! Board! - Want a drink? - No, thanks. Jacksonville. Thirty minutes for breakfast, folks. - Only 30 minutes for breakfast. - Read all about it! Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

Thank you very much. We're in Jacksonville, aren't we? Yes. That was foolish of me. W-Well, why didn't you shove me away? I hated to wake you up. You look kind of pretty asleep. How about some breakfast? Oh, no, no. No, thank you. No, I'm going to the Windsor Hotel. Windsor? You'll never make it in time. We leave in half an hour. Oh, no. They'll wait for me. Driver, I'm going to be a few minutes late. - Be sure to wait for me. - Oh, yeah? Yes. - Where's the bus to New York? - It left about 20 minutes ago. But that's ridiculous. I was on that bus. I told them to wait. I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone. Good morning. Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night. Seems to me I've already thanked you for that. - What time is the next bus? - 8:00 tonight. Eight o'clo... That's 12 hours! I'm sorry, miss. What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you? What are you excited about? You missed it too. Yeah, I missed it too. Don't tell me you did it on my account. I hope you haven't any idea that what happened last night... Look here, young man, you needn't concern yourself about me. - I can take care of myself. - You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it. Here's your ticket. - My ticket? - I found it on the seat. Thank you. It must have fallen out of my purse. You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. What are you talking about? Your father will stop you before you get halfway to New York. You must have me confused with someone else. Quit kidding. It's all over the front page. I've always been curious to know what kind of girl would marry... a front-page aviator like King Westley. Take my advice: Grab the next bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony. I didn't ask for your advice. That's right. You didn't. You're not going to notify my father, are you? What for? You probably could get some money out of him. I never thought of that. If you promise not to, I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay you now, only the only thing I had... when I jumped off was a wristwatch, and I had to pawn that to get clothes. I'll give you my address. Get in touch with me - the minute you get to New York. - Never mind. I had you pegged right from the jump... just a spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you get anything is to buy it. You're in a jam, and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word ""humility""? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say... ""Please, mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?"" No. That'd bring you down off your high horse. Let me tell you something: You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problem. You, King Westley, your father... you're all a lot of hooey to me. Do you send telegrams here? I'm just fine, thanks. And how are you? ""To Joe Gordon, in care of New York Mail, New York. ""Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is."" No! Do you really? Go on, go on. Send the telegram. ""How would you like to have the story, you big tub of..."" ""of..."" - ""Mush."" - ""Tub of mush. Well, try and get it. What I said about... never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne."" That'll be $2.60. - Send it collect. - ""Collect""? Collect. Bus leaving for Savannah, Charleston, Columbia... Greensborough, Richmond, Washington, Baltimore... Philadelphia, New York. Savannah, Charleston, Columbia... Greensborough, Richmond... Washington, Baltimore... All aboard! Hi, sister. All alone? My name's Shapeley. Might as well get acquainted. It's gonna be a long trip. Gets tiresome, especially for somebody like you. You look like you've got class. Yes, sir, with a capital K. And I'm the guy that knows class when he sees it, believe you me. Ask the boys. They'll tell you: ""Shapeley knows how to pick 'em."" Yes, sir. Shapeley's the name, and that's the way I like 'em. You made no mistake sitting next to me. The mugs on a hop like this ain't nothin' to write home about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit it up with. You can't be too particular neither. What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much. Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. That's pretty good. ""Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance."" Well, shut my big nasty mouth! Looks like you're one up on me. There's nothing I like better than to meet a high-class mama... that can snap 'em back at ya. The colder they are, the hotter they get. That's what I always say. Yes, sir. When a cold mama gets hot... boy, how she sizzles! You're just my type. Believe me, sister, I could go for you in a big way. ""Fun-on-the-side Shapeley,"" they call me... with accent on the ""fun,"" believe you me. Believe you me, you bore me to distraction. Looks like you're two up on me now. - Hey, you. - Huh? - There's a seat over there for you. - What's the idea? I'd like to sit next to my wife, if you don't mind. - Your wife? - Yeah. Come on, come on. Oh, yeah, sure. Excuse me. I was just... Excuse me, miss. I just was trying to make things pleasant, you see? Excuse me. I... I didn't mean anything, doc. - N-no offense, doc. - No. No. If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you. Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice gets on my nerves. What'd you do all day? Ran in and out of doorways trying to keep out of the rain. Your clothes are all wet. Here. - You're as helpless as a baby. - Thank you. Here you are, folks: cigars, cigarettes... chewing gum, candy, magazines. Here, boy. - Yes, ma'am? - A box of chocolates, please. Never mind. She doesn't want it. - But the lady... - Of course I do! Beat it! You've got your nerve! Here, boy. Dollar and 60 cents. You had four dollars last night. How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going? That is none of your business. You're on a budget from now on. - Just a minute. You can't... - Shut up. - What's the matter, Officer? - Bridge washout. Looks like we can't get through till morning. If any of you passengers want a place to sleep... you'll find an auto camp up yonder a piece. - Where? - Right over there. See those lights? - Oh, yeah. - Dyke's Auto Camp. All right, thanks. Hey, brat. Are you talking to me? Yeah. Come on. We're stopping here for the night. - Thank you. - Hey, come on! We're all set! Good evening. Hope you and your husband rest comfortable. Come on, come on. You going to stay there all night? Darn clever, these Armenians. Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to... as my husband. Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you: I registered as ""Mr. and Mrs."" Oh, you did? What am I expected to do? Leap for joy? I kind of half expected you to thank me. Your ego is absolutely colossal. Yeah, yeah. Not bad. How's yours? You know, compared to you... my friend Shapeley is an amateur. Just whatever gave you any idea I'd stand for this? Now, wait a minute. Let's get this straightened out right now. If you're nursing any silly notion that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me. A headline? You're not a newspaperman, are you? Chalk up one for your side. Now, listen. You want to get to King Westley, don't you? All right. I'm here to help you. What I want is your story. Exclusive. A day-to-day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Between you and me, I've got to have it. Isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out for yourself... including this. This? That's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night... and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear... that the family purse won't stand for separate establishments. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. You've been very kind. It's all right with me. Go out in the storm. But I'm going to follow you, see? Yeah. And if you get tough... I'll just have to turn you over to your old man... right now. Savvy? Now, that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. If you behave, I'll see that you get to King Westley. If not, I'll just have to spill the beans to Papa. Now, which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right. That, I suppose, makes everything quite all right. Oh, this? I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me. Behold the walls of Jericho. Maybe not as thick as the ones Joshua blew down with his trumpet... but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet. Just to show you my heart's in the right place... I'll give you my best pair of pajamas. Do you mind joining the Israelites? You don't want to join the Israelites? All right. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses. There's a funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. I knew a man who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed. He made a picture! Years later, his secret came out. He wore a toupee. Yeah. I have a method all my own. If you'll notice, the coat came first... then the tie, then the shirt. Now, according to Hoyle... after that, the pants should be next. There's where I'm different: I go for the shoes next. First the right... then the left. After that... it's every man for himself. Still with me, brat? Don't be a sucker. A good night's rest will do you good. Besides, you've got nothing to worry about. The walls of Jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf. Who's afraid of the big bad wolf The big bad wolf The big bad wolf She's afraid of the big bad wolf Tra, la, la, la, la Would you mind please putting out the light? No, not at all. I wish you'd take those things off the walls of Jericho. Oh, excuse me. By the way, what's your name? What's that? Who are you? Who, me? I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face. You've got a name, haven't you? Yeah, I got a name: Peter Warne. ""Peter Warne."" I don't like it. Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne. The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne. Another message, sir. - What is it? - It's from Charleston, Mr. Andrews. ""Checking every northbound train. Also assigned 20 operators to watch highways. No sign of your daughter yet. Will continue to do everything possible. Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."" Just the same as all the others. Yes, sir? I made it clear I was in a hurry to get to New York. - What are we crawling for? - I've got it wide open, sir. - Step on it! - Yes, sir. Oh, I hope she's all right, sir. ""All right""? Of course she's all right. What could happen to her? - Nothing, sir. - Then shut up about it! Hello? Hey, mister. Oh, hello. What's the matter? You not up yet? - What time is it? Here. What... Oh, it's a toothbrush. Thanks. My dress... you had it pressed! Come on. Breakfast will be ready. You sweet thing. Where'd you get it pressed? I'm gonna count ten. If you're not out of that bed, I'm coming and drag you out. - One, two, three, four, five, six... - I really think you would. - seven, eight, nine... - I'm out, I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. You'll find the showers and things just behind the second cottage. Outside? Certainly. All the best homes have them outside. Really, I-I can't go out like this. - Like what? - Like this. I have no robe. Oh. Here. - Use mine. - Oh, thanks. Come on. Make it snappy. It's not my fault. You got the sleeve. - Here. Here are my puppets. - Thanks. Where'd you say the showers and things were? Here. Here's a towel. Thank you. You're kind of little, aren't you? - Where's the shower? - Your hair's cute like that. - You should never comb it. - I'll find it myself. Are the showers in there? Well, they ain't out here. Thank you. Can't a body have a little privacy around here? If you want a shower around here, you'll stand in line. Hi, sister. You remember me? Shapeley? I'm sorry about last night. Didn't know you was married. You shoulda told me right off. High time you got back. I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got chatting about this and that. You know how time flies. Come on, sit down. My, my, my. Scrambled eggs. ""Egg."" One egg. One doughnut. Black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. - Any complaints? - No, no complaints. I'd have gotten cream, but it'd have meant buying a whole pint. You don't have to apologize to me. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this. What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning? It must be the spring. I thought ""believe you me"" told you a couple snappy stories. Oh, no. He apologized for last night. Said he didn't know we were married. Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut? Thanks. You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean, running away. No, no. Makes too good a story. Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, though I don't see how I can be. Spoiled people are accustomed to having their way. I never have. I've always been told what to do... and how to do it and when and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man. - Yeah. - It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken. You're doing all right. Thanks. Nurses, governesses... chaperones, even bodyguards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun. One consolation: You can never get lonesome. It has its moments. It's become a sort of game... trying to outwit Father's detectives. I did once. I actually went shopping without a bodyguard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. It didn't last long. They caught me in a department store. I was so mad, I ran out the back... and jumped into the first car I saw. - Guess who was in it. - Santa Claus. Gandhi. King Westley was in it. Is that how you met him? We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6:00 he was having all the rivers dragged. Say, where'd you learn to dunk? In finishing school? Don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk. Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip... and sock! Into your mouth. Let it hang too long, it'll get soft and fall off. All a matter of timing. - I'll write a book about it. - Thanks, Professor. Just goes to show you: 20 millions, and you don't know how to dunk. I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day. How do I know who you are? I never saw you before. You can't go around bothering my tenants. There's no girl by that name here. Besides, how do I know you're detectives? Show him your credentials, Mac. - Detectives! - Oh! That's Father at work. Peter, what'll I do? Maybe I can jump out the window. They won't see me. Sit down. Get yourself mussed up. Get your hair down over your eyes and your blouse unfastened. Yeah, I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week. If we don't stop over to Wilkes-Barre, she'll never forgive us. What are you talking about? The baby's due next month. They want us to come. Oh, yeah. She saw your sister the other day. Said she's looking swell. - Come in. - I hope Aunt Bella has a boy. Grandma says it's a girl. She hasn't missed calling one in years. Man here to see you, sweetheart. Me? You want to see me? - What's your name? - Are you addressin' me? - Yeah. What's your name? - Hey, wait a minute. That's my wife you're talking to. What do you mean, coming here? What do you want? We're looking for somebody. Look your head off, but don't come in here. I've got a notion to take a sock at you. - Take it easy, son. - These men are detectives. I don't care if they're police. They can't bust in here shooting questions at my wife. Don't get so excited. The man asked a simple question. Oh, is that so? How many times have I told you to stop butting in? You don't have to lose your temper. ""You don't have to lose your temper."" That's what you said the other time. Every time I try to protect you! The other night at the dance, - when that Swede made a pass... - He didn't make a pass at me! I saw him. He kept pawing you all over the dance floor. - He didn't. You were drunk. - Nuts! You're just like your old man! Once a plumber's daughter, always a plumber's daughter. Ain't an ounce of brains in your family! - You've gone far enough! - Shut up! See what you've done? Sorry, Mr. Warne, but we've got to check up on everybody. We're looking for Ellen Andrews, the daughter of that Wall Street mug. Too bad you ain't looking for a plumber's daughter. Quit bawling! Quit bawling! I told you they were a perfectly nice married couple. You weren't bad, jumping in like that. - You've got a brain, haven't you? - You're not so bad yourself. We could start a two-people stock company. If things get tough, we'll play the small-town auditoriums. We'll call this one The Great Deception. What about Cinderella or A Real Hot Love Story? - No, too mushy. - I like mushy stuff. Quit bawling! You're just like... - Five minutes. - What? Your bus leaves in five minutes. Oh! Holy smoke! We're not even packed yet. I'm beginning to believe you fellas couldn't find your way home. - Yeah? - Telegram for you. - Bring it in. - Another wire from Peter Warne. Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket. Wait a minute. What does it say? ""Have I got a story. Stop. It's getting hotter and hotter. Stop. Hope you're the same."" - Collect? - Yes. If you accept another one, you're fired. - Yes sir. - That gives me a good idea for all of you! I want action, Lovington! - We can't do the impossible. - What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is between here and Miami. I want her found. - I put extra men on all along the way. - That's not enough. Send in Clark and Brown. You're sure she isn't with King Westley? No. He's been trailed 24 hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about. I'm worried, Lovington. Something might have happened to her. Brown, make arrangements for a radio broadcast. Coast-to-coast hookup. Offer a reward of $10,000 for information - leading to her whereabouts. - Yes, sir. Clark, send the story to all the newspapers. Some out-of-town papers may not have a picture of her. Here. Wire this to them. - I want the story to break right away. - Yes, sir. Now we'll get some action! That's fine. Say, fellas... do you know that one about the man who flew on the trapeze? - Sure. - Oh, yeah. - ""Flying Trapeze."" - Attaboy. Once I was happy But now I'm forlorn Like an old coat that is tattered and torn Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn Betrayed by a maid in her teens Oh, this maid that I loved she was handsome And I tried all I knew how to please But I never could please her one quarter so well As the man on the flying trapeze He flies through the air with the greatest of ease The daring young man on the flying trapeze His actions are graceful All girls he does please And my love he purloined away Hey, I know the second verse there. Yeah. Now, he'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse His eyes would undress every girl in the house Perhaps he is better described as a louse And still people came just the same Now, he smiles from the bar on the people below And one night he smiled on my love She blew him a kiss and she hollered ""Bravo!"" As he hung by his schnozzle from above Oh, he floats through the air With the greatest of ease The daring young man on the flying trapeze His actions are graceful The girls he does please My love he has stolen away Say, you mind if I take the third one? I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks While she spent her time with the circus's freaks The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks Alas, alack, and Alaska I went to this fellow, the villain and I said I'll see that you get your deserts His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer - He sneered once again and said... - Whoa! He flies through the air with the greatest of ease The daring young man on the flying trapeze His actions are graceful All the girls he does please And my love he has stolen away - Everybody keep your seats. - Thank the man for me, Peter. It's the first comfortable position I've been in all night. Oh, she flies through the air with the greatest of ease Ma! Ma! Ma! What's the matter with you? Somebody help us! Something's happened to her! Get some water, somebody. Let me in there, son. You got some smelling salts? Ma! Come on. Let's give your mother a chance to snap out of it. Don't worry. She'll be all right in a few minutes. We ain't ate nothing since yesterday. Oh? What happened to your money? Ma spent it all on the tickets. We didn't know it was gonna be so much. We shouldn't have come, I guess. But Ma said there was a job waiting for her in New York... and if we didn't go, she might lose it. She'll be all right when she's had something to eat. Here, honey. The next town we come to, buy some food. Come on. I shouldn't oughta take this. Ma'll get mad. Don't tell her. You don't want her to get sick again, do you? - No, but you might need it. - Come on. - I got millions. - Gee, thanks. Come on. Let's go back to your mother. - Better phone for help. - You can if you want. The nearest town is 10 miles from here. - Yeah? - Say, buddy... like to take a look at my paper? Traveling like this, you lose track of what's going on in the world. Take that story there, for instance. If I was to see that dame, you know what I'd do? No, what? - I'd go 50-50 with you. - Why? Because I don't believe in hogging it, see? A bird that figures that way always ends up behind the eight ball. That's what I always say. - What's on your mind? - Five Gs or I crab the works. Let's get away from this gang, talk this over privately. I knew she wasn't your wife all the time. You know, lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need. - You made no mistake. - I can use a smart guy like you. When you're talking to Shapeley, you're talking to... You pack a gat? - Huh? - A gat, a gat. A rod. Got any fireworks on you? Why, no. It's all right. I got machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one. We may have trouble up north... have to shoot it out with the cops. But if you come through, those five Gs are in the bag... maybe more. I'll talk with the Killer, - see he takes care of you. - ""Killer""? Yeah, the big boy. The boss of the outfit. You're not kidnapping her, are you? What else, stupid? You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward? - Ten thousand bucks? - Chicken feed. Hey, listen. We're holding that dame for a million smackers. I didn't know it was anything like this. You see, I've got... What's the matter? You getting yellow? I'm married, a couple kids. I can't afford to... Pipe down, you mug, before I... What are you trying to do, tell the whole world about it? Listen, you're into this thing, and you're staying in, get me? You know too much. I-I won't say anything, honest. How do I know that? I got a notion to plug you. Why should I take a chance with you? Trust me, mister, I'll keep my mouth shut. Yeah? What's your name? Oscar Shapeley. - Where do you live? - Orange, New Jersey. Got a couple of kids? Y-Yes, sir. Just babies. A little golden-haired girl... - You love them, don't you? - Yes, I do. Why, you wouldn't... You're not thinking... - You keep your trap shut, all right? - Sure, sure! - If you don't... - I will, I will. You ever hear of Bugs Dooley? B-B-Bugs Dooley? No. A nice guy, like you, but he made a mistake one day. Got too talkative. - Know what happened to his kid? - No. I can't tell you, but when Bugs heard about it, he blew his brains out. Oh, gee, that's terrible. Terrible. He had it coming, though. He talked too much. I never talk. I never say a word. W-Word of honor. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids. Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it. Sure, mister. Thanks. I always knew you guys were... Come on, scram. And stay away from that bus. Sure. Anything you say, mister. - Ain't gonna shoot me, are you? - If you don't beat it... I'm going. - Come on! - Why do we have to leave the bus? Come on. Don't ask so many questions. Why? Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that. At the rate he's going, he's probably crossed two state lines by this time. Say, why did we have to leave the bus? When Shapeley stops running, he's going to start thinking, isn't he? You know, I've been doing a little thinking myself. The next town we come to, you better wire your father. What's the matter? Are you weakening? No. No, just thinking of you. A starvation diet may not agree with you. Did you give that child all your money? I didn't give him anything. You were the bighearted gal. All the money I had was that ten-spot... so I've been thinking you better wire your father. No, sir. I started out for New York, and I'm going to get there... - if I have to starve all the way. - Okay. What is this strange power... this man Westley has over you women? Here. Take these. Hold on to them. Get up on that log. Get up on the log. I wish you'd stop being playful. Oh, so sorry. Sorry. This is the first time in years I've ridden piggyback. - This isn't piggyback. - Of course it is. You're crazy. I remember distinctly my father taking me for a piggyback ride. - And he carried you like this? - Yes. Your father didn't know beans about piggyback riding. My uncle, Mother's brother, has four children... and I've seen them ride piggyback. I'll bet there isn't a good piggyback rider in your family. I never knew a rich man yet who could piggyback ride. You're prejudiced. Show me a good piggybacker, and I'll show you a real human. Take Abraham Lincoln: a natural born piggybacker. Where do you get off with that stuffed-shirt family of yours? My father was a great piggybacker. Here, hold this a minute. - Oh! - Thank you. How long does this keep up? My feet are killing me. This looks like the best spot. We're not going to sleep out here, are we? I'm going to give a good imitation of it. Peter? What? I'm awfully hungry. - Oh, it's just your imagination. - No, it isn't. I'm hungry and... and scared. You can't be hungry and scared both at the same time. - Well, I am. - If you're scared, - it scares the hunger out of you. - Not if you're more hungry than scared. All right, you win. Let's forget about it. I can't forget it. I'm still hungry. Holy smoke! Why did I ever get mixed up with you? If I had any sense, I'd be in New York by this time. What about your story? Taking a married woman back to her husband. I turned out to be the prize sucker. All right, come on. Your bed's all ready. I'll get my clothes all wrinkled. - Then take 'em off. - What? All right, don't. Do whatever you please... but shut up about it. You know, you're becoming awfully disagreeable lately. You just snap my head off every time I open my mouth. If being with me is so distasteful to you, you can leave. You can leave anytime you see fit. Nobody's holding you here. I can get along. Peter? Peter! Oh, Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Oh, Peter! - What's the matter? - I was so scared! What got into you? I went to try and find you something to eat. - I know, but... - Here. - Here, eat your head off. - I don't want it now. - I thought you said you were hungry. - I was, but... But what? I was so scared, it scared the hung... Holy jumpin' catfish! You'd drive a guy crazy! It's liable to get chilly before morning. You better use this. What are you thinking about? By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you. Really? Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy. What did you say we're supposed to be doing? Hitchhiking. Oh. Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking. Where does the hitching come in? A little early yet. No cars out. If it's just the same to you... I'm going to sit right here and wait till they come. Ooh. You got a toothpick? - What's the matter? - Got hay in my teeth. No, I haven't got a toothpick. Here. I got a penknife, though. - Hold still. - Be careful. - Where is it? - Right in the middle. The middle? All right. Hold still. Real still. All right. There. - Get it? - Thanks. You should've swallowed that. You're not gonna have breakfast. Oh, you needn't rub it in. - What are you eating? - Carrots. - Raw? - Want one? No! Why didn't you get me something I could eat? Oh, that's right. I forgot. The idea of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews. You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you, do you? Better have one of these. Best thing for you, carrots. I hate the horrid things. I wish you wouldn't talk so much. We let a car get away. So suppose nobody stops for us? They'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail 'em. Oh, and you're an expert, I suppose. ""Expert""? I'm gonna write a book about it. Call it The Hitchhiker's Hail. There's no end to your accomplishments, is there? - You think it's simple? - Oh, no. It is simple. It's all in that old thumb, see? Some people do it like this... or like this. - All wrong. Never get anywhere. - Aw, the poor things. But that old thumb never fails. It's all a matter of how you do it, though. You take number one, for instance. That's a short, jerky movement, like this. Shows independence. You don't care whether they stop. You got money. Clever. Number two's a wider movement. A smile goes with this one, like this. That means you got a brand-new story about the farmer's daughter. You figured that out all by yourself? That's nothing. Number three is a pip. That's the pitiful one, when you're broke and hungry, and everything looks black. It's a long, sweeping movement. Got to follow through, though. That's amazing. But it's no good if you haven't got a long face. Here comes a car. Okay, watch me. I'm gonna use number one. Keep your eye on that thumb and see what happens. I still got my eye on the thumb. Something must have gone wrong. I'll try number two. Well, when you get to a hundred, wake me up. I don't think I'll write that book after all. Think of all the fun you had, though. Do you mind if I try? You? Don't make me laugh. Oh, you're such a smart aleck. Nobody knows anything but you. I'll stop a car, and I won't use my thumb. - What are you gonna do? - It's a system all my own. Aren't you going to give me a little credit? What for? Well, I proved once and for all... that the limb is mightier than the thumb. Why didn't you take off all your clothes? You could have stopped 40 cars. Ooh, I'll remember that when we need 40 cars. So you're just married? That's pretty good. But if I was young... that's the way I'd spend my honeymoon: hitchhiking. - Yeah. - Yes, sir. Hitchhiking down the highway of love On a honeymoon Hitchhiking down, down Down the highway Down - Down... - Hey, hey. Aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil? Tonsil? Me? No. Me, burn a tonsil! My tonsils won't burn as life's corners I... All right, all right. Let it go. Turn How about a bite to eat? - That would be lovely. - No, thanks. We're not hungry. Oh, I see. Young people in love are never hungry. - No. - Young people in love Are very seldom hungry Young people in love are very seldom Hungry What were you going to do, gold-dig that guy for a meal? Sure, I was. No fooling: I'm hungry. Eat a carrot. No. - I'm going in and asking him. - You do and I'll break your neck. Come on, let's get out of here. Stretch our legs. Come on. I'm sorry I... Oh, that's all right. Hey! Hey! Hey, come here! Hey, you've got my suitcase! Hey! Hey, you! Hey! Hey! What happened to you? I've been so worried. - Get in. - Look at your face! You've got a cut! - What happened? - Just a road thief. Picks people up, then runs off with their things. What a racket! - How'd you get the car? - Gave him a black eye. Had to tie him to a tree. Can't be much gas left in this thing. Got to start promoting some. Better take the things out of the pocket of that coat. That ought to be good for 10 gallons. I haven't changed my mind, Westley. I want you to understand that. I don't like you. Never have, never will. That's clear enough, isn't it? You've made that evident by your threats of annulment. It hasn't worried me for a minute. Ellie and I married because we love each other. And she's proving it. As far as I'm concerned, there's to be no annulment. I see. You've got hold of a good thing... and you're going to hang on to it? All right. You win. I guess I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked... but it's only because I'm worried. If I don't find her soon, I'll go crazy. I might've been able to help if it hadn't been for you. - I've been watched so closely... - Yes, I know. Well, you can help now. I've got a room full of reporters in there. Now I want you to make a statement. Say that we've talked things over and come to an understanding... and that if she returns, I won't interfere with your marriage. - Is that all right? - Yeah, that's quite all right. - Okay. - I hope you and your wife - spend a pleasant week with us. - Yeah, so do I. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. - All right, brat. - Any luck? Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a cabin. - What about the money? - I talked him out of that idea. He thinks we're staying a week. I'll have to think something up before morning. - That's swell. - Yeah? I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, I think it's foolish. I told you there's no use staying here tonight. We could make New York in three hours. I thought you were in such a hurry to get back. Well, I... Well, whoever heard of getting in at 3:00 in the morning? Everybody will be asleep. Okay. Cottage number six. There you go, trusting people again. How many times did I tell you... But he looked like a nice, upright young fellow, Ma. Well, we're on the last lap. Tomorrow morning, you'll be in the arms of your husband. Yeah. You'll have a great story, won't you? Yeah. Swell. Thank you. Well, we certainly outsmarted your father. I guess you ought to be happy. Am I going to see you in New York? Nope. Why not? I don't make it a policy to run around with married women. There's no harm in your coming to see us. Not interested. Won't I ever see you again? What do you want to see me for? I've served my purpose. I brought you back to King Westley. That's what you wanted. Have you ever been in love, Peter? Me? Yes. Haven't you ever thought about it at all? It seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy. Sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I could ever meet the right sort of girl... Yeah, well, where are you gonna find her? Somebody that's real. Somebody that's alive. They don't come that way anymore. Have I ever thought about it? Boy, I've even been sucker enough to make plans. You know... I saw an island in the Pacific once. Never been able to forget it. That's where I'd like to take her. But she'd have to be the sort of girl who... who'd jump in the surf with me and love it as much as I did. You know... nights when you and the moon... and the water all become one... and you feel you're part of something big and marvelous. That's the only place to live. The stars are so close over your head... you feel you could reach up and stir them around. Certainly I've been thinking about it. Boy, if I could ever find a girl who was hungry for those thi... Take me with you, Peter. Take me to your island. I want to do all those things you talked about. You'd better go back to your bed. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything will take care of itself. Please, Peter. I can't let you out of my life now. I couldn't live without you. You'd better go back to your bed. I'm sorry. Hey, brat. Did you mean that? Would you really go? All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. That bag's worth $25. I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas. When I get back in the morning, I'll buy it back. Give you a $10 profit. What do you say? - I ain't got a hat. - What? I ain't got a hat. You got one now! Come on, fill 'er up. Peter, where you been all this time? - Everybody been asking about you. - Okay, Tony. Look. Get me one drink. Don't let anybody disturb me. Sure, boss. - Hello, Agnes. - Don't go in. He'll shoot you on sight. Haven't been shot at in days. Get out of here! Get out! - Get out! - Listen, Joe. - Don't ""Joe"" me. - Joe, listen. You know I've always liked you. Anytime I ran across a good story, I came running to you with it. I got one now. Those wires were on the level. The biggest scoop of the year! - I'm giving it to you. - About the Andrews kid? I've got it written up. All I want is a thousand bucks. A thousand bucks? Get out... Don't get sore. This is something you gotta do for me. - I need it quick. I'm in a jam. - What's the thousand bucks for? - To tear down the walls of Jericho. - What? Never mind. Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled. - To marry somebody else. - You're drunk. Would that story be worth a thousand bucks? - If it was on the level. - I got it, Joe. - Who's the guy she's gonna marry? - I am, Joe. - You? - Yeah. Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home. Don't annoy me anymore. For heaven's sake, stop being an editor for a minute. We've known each other a long time. This is on the level. I met her on a bus from Miami. I've been with her every minute. I'm in love with her. You got to get me this money now. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside Philadelphia. I gotta get right back. She doesn't know I'm gone. A guy can't propose to a gal without a cent in the world, can he? What a story. On her way to join her husband, Ellen Andrews... That's it, that's it. Let me see that a minute. Zeke? Zeke! Zeke! I told you you couldn't trust him. - He's gone. - Who? That fellow who was gonna stay a week. He skipped and took the car too. We wouldn't have known till morning if I hadn't took that magnesia. Get up. Don't lay there. Let's do something about it. There ain't nothing we can do if he's gone. - See that? They're gone. - Looks like it, don't it? What's this? Ma, here's the woman. - Oh! - What's the matter? - Where's your husband? - ""Husband""? Yes, if he is your husband. - Isn't he here? - No, he ain't. The car's gone too. Oh. You got any money? - No. - Then you'll have to git. Yeah, you'll have to git. Please, may I use your phone? I've got to call New York. You ain't gonna stick me for no phone call. Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter mile down the road. They'll fix you up. And listen, next time you better not come back here. I run a respectable place. - Thanks. You saved my life. - So long, kid. - Good luck. - Thanks. Good-bye, Agnes. Oh, you're beautiful! All women are beautiful. For my dough, he's still the best newspaperman in the business. - Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn! - Hello? Hold up the morning edition. Break down the front page. Complete new layout. Send in a couple rewrite men. Hank, don't do a thing. I've got a story that will make your hair curl. Wait a minute. Don't annoy me. I'm busy. Agnes, send Mac in here! Dig up all the pictures on that Andrews kid. And Hank, get Healy out of bed. I want a cartoon, and I want it quick. King Westley's in it, waiting at the church... with tears streaming down his face. The bride didn't show up. Old man Andrews is laughing. Everything exaggerated. Snap into it. Yeah, what is it? Huh? Ellen Andrews? You're crazy. No, I'm not. She phoned her father from an auto camp to come get her. He's getting a police escort, and Westley's going along. Yeah, she's been traveling by bus. The moment she found out her father and Westley made up, she phoned. Okay, grab a car and stay with them. Get Hank again. Agnes! Get me a doctor. I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown. Hank, forget what I told you. I'm having a nightmare. Agnes! Call the police. Tell them to find Peter Warne. Send out a general alarm. I want that dirty crook pinched! - Do you want us? - Everything off the front page! Ellen Andrews just phoned her father. She's going home. The minute she found out the old man withdrew his objections, she gave herself up. Spread it all over! Play it up big! Here's your lead: - ""Love Triumphant."" Go on, hop to it! - Okay. Come on, baby. Come on. We gotta get there before she wakes up. Can't you drive any faster? Young people in love Are never hungry Come on, baby! We've got a police escort. Come on, baby. They can't make a sucker out of us. - Get back. - Get 'em back. Step back. Give 'em room, boys. - Quite a long trip, isn't it? - How about a statement? Wait till she gets home. Later, boys. Later. Oh, he floats through the air with the greatest of ease The daring young man on the flying trapeze Hiya! Hey, get that thing out of the way! Keep your britches on! We'll get it out of the way. Hiya! Hey, you darn fool! Hey! Hey, Pete, Ellen Andrews is going to marry that Westley guy again. - Gordon's out back someplace. - Yeah? When he comes in, give him this. Tell him I was just kidding. - You can't get a thing done around here. - Peter Warne was just in. - What? - He left this money. - Said to tell you he was kidding. - Where is he? - There. - Hey, Pete! Hello, Joe. Sorry. It was just a little gag. I thought I'd have some fun with you. Yeah, sure. You had me going for a while. - Wouldn't have made a bad story. - No. Great. But that's the way things go. You think you got a great yarn... and then something comes along and messes up the finish... and there you are. Yeah. Where am I? When you sober up, come in and talk to me. Thanks. - Ellie? - Oh, hello, Dad. I knocked several times. I'm sorry. I must have been daydreaming. Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor too. Great stunt King is going to pull. - ""Stunt""? - Yes, landing on the lawn in an autogyro. Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, I heard. Yes, personally, I think it's silly too. You look lovely, child. Are you pleased with the gown? Ellie? Oh, the gown. Yes, it's nice, isn't it? What's the matter, child? - What's wrong? - Nothing. You haven't changed your mind about King, have you? Oh, no, no. Because if you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. You gave me such a scare when I couldn't find you. You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be. I'm sorry, Father. I wouldn't hurt you for anything. You know that. What's the matter, child? Aren't you happy? I thought so. I knew there was something on your mind. There, there, there, now. What's the matter? You haven't fallen in love with someone else, have you? Have you? I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious. Where'd you meet him? On the road. Don't tell me you've fallen in love with a bus driver. Oh, no. Who is he? I don't know very much about him... except that I love him. Well, if it's as serious as all that, we'll move heaven and earth... No, it's no use. He despises me. - Oh, come, now! - Yes, he does. He despises everything about me. He says that I'm spoiled and selfish... and pampered and thoroughly insincere. Oh, ridiculous! He doesn't think so much of you either. Well, I... He blames you for everything that's wrong with me. He says you raised me stupidly. That's a fine man to fall in love with! Oh, he's marvelous. Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he? - I don't know. - I'd like to talk with him. It wouldn't do any good. I practically threw myself at him. Under the circumstances, don't you think we'd better call this thing off? No, no. No, I'll go through with it. But that's silly, seeing the way you feel about him. No, it doesn't matter. I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've done it all my life. I've made your life miserable, and mine too. I'm tired, Father. I'm tired of running around in circles. He's right. That's what I've been doing ever since I can remember. I've got to settle down. It doesn't matter how or where or with whom. You've changed, Ellie. I can't walk out on King now. It would make us all look so ridiculous. Anyway, what difference does it make? I'll never see Peter again. Is that his name? Yes. Peter Warne. ""Peter Warne."" - Why? Do you know him? - Why, no, no. Father, you haven't heard from him, have you? - Don't be silly... - Oh, please! What's that? Well, I guess that was his only interest in me, wasn't it? The reward. - I'm sorry you read it. - Are you going to see him? I suppose so. Certainly! Pay him off! He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. He kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets. Thank you, Mary. That's just what I needed. Mr. Westley's on his way up. Fine. Have him come in. I'll be going. Oh. If it isn't the bridegroom himself! You're just in time, King. How are you, Ellie? - Are you happy? - ""Happy""? Why shouldn't I be happy? Here we are. Let's drink. Well, it's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. - Promise you'll never let me get off. - Whatever you say, darling. It's a promise. Hello. Yeah? Who? Oh. Why can't I see you at your office? I'm leaving for Washington tonight. I may be gone several weeks. I thought perhaps you'd like to get this thing settled. Yeah. But I don't like the idea of butting in on your jamboree. Between you and me, those things give me a stiff pain. You don't have to see anybody. You can come directly to my study. No, no, no. Why do I want to... Hey, wait a minute. Maybe I will come over. Yeah. I'd like to get a load of that three-ring circus you're pulling. I want to see what love looks like when it's triumphant. I haven't had a good laugh in a week. - Mr. Warne? - Yeah. - Sit down. - Thanks. I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me... anything about you, about your helping her. That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why did she think I lugged her all the way from Miami? She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get. She does? Isn't that sweet of her? - You don't, I suppose. - Well, I don't know. I'll have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel justified. If I didn't, I wouldn't be here. I got it all itemized. ""Cash outlay: $8.60. Topcoat: $15. Suitcase: $7.50. Hat: $4.00. Three shirts: $4.50. Total: $39.60. All the above items had to be sold to buy gasoline."" I sold some shorts and socks too. I'm throwing those in. - Yes, I know. - What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? Trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars, maybe more. Let me get this straight. You want 39.60... in addition to the $10,000? What 10,000? - The reward. - Who said anything about a reward? I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused. - I assumed that... - Look, all I want is 39.60. If you give me a check, I'll get out of this joint. It gives me the jitters. - You're a peculiar chap. - We'll go into that some other time. The average man would go after the reward... Did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle, something you probably wouldn't understand. When anybody takes me for a buggy ride, I don't like having to pay for the privilege. - Were you taken for a buggy ride? - Yes, with all the trimmings. - So how about the check? Do I get it? - Certainly. Thanks. - There you are. - Thank you. Do you mind if I ask you a question, frankly? Do you love my daughter? Any guy in love with your daughter oughta have his head examined. - That's an evasion. - She picked a perfect running mate: King Westley, the pill of the century. She needs a guy that'd sock her once a day whether it's coming to her or not. If you had half the brains you're supposed to, - you'd have done it yourself. - Do you love her? A normal human being couldn't live with her without going nutty! - She's my idea of nothing. - I asked a simple question: Do you love her? Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself. Well, here's to the merry-go-round. Perfect. Now you look natural. - I hope you got your money. - You bet I did. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Same to you. Stay around and watch the fun. You'll enjoy it immensely. I would, but I've got a weak stomach. I just had a long talk with him. - I'm not interested. - Just a minute, Ellie. I don't want to hear another word about him. Come on, folks. King Westley has arrived. Come on! There they come, boys. Turn 'em over. You're a sucker to go through with this. That guy Warne is okay. He didn't want the reward. All he asked for was $39.60, what he spent on you. Said it was a matter of principle. You took him for a ride. He loves you, Ellie. He told me so. You don't want to be married to a mug like Westley. I can buy him off for a pot of gold. And you can make an old man happy and you won't do so bad for yourself. If you change your mind, your car's waiting at the back gate. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here... in the sight of God and in the face of this company... to join together this man and woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together... let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace. King, wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife... - so long as ye both shall live? - I will. Ellen, wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband... so long as ye both shall live? - Ellen! - Ellen! Ellen! Ellie! Where has she gone? - What happened? - I haven't the slightest idea. Don't want to talk to... Don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody. But it's King Westley on the phone. Hello, my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley... not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Well, it oughta be. I'm not complaining. Oh, no. Not complaining. It was dirt cheap. Don't fall out of any windows! There's another wire from Peter. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan. ""What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke? The walls of Jericho are toppling."" Send him a telegram right away. Just say, ""Let 'em topple."" - Funny couple, ain't they? - Yeah. If you ask me, I don't believe they're married. They're married, all right. I just seen the license. They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket. On a night like this! What do you reckon that's for? - Blamed if I know. I brung 'em a trumpet. - A trumpet? One of them toy things. They sent me to the store. What in the world do they want a trumpet for? Don't know. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, She's denied the cross for suicide... and buried at the center of a crossroads. Huh. Show me the logic. Father? What? The devil is a practical man. If she were a witch, she was a poor return on his investment. What would you know of logic? Oh, I have ears, Father. Although one is notched because I love justice. You love thieving. Shut up. You dig. Crusaders. Clear the road, if you will. Squire! Hyah! This is for the burial from my lord... and a Mass... for her soul. Wait. Have you forgotten? She was your brother's wife. She was a suicide. Cut off her head. And return the ax. You know this place, my lord? Know it? I know all of it. Your brother? You have spoken to him? On what matter, my lord? He is still arrested. Your brother is as responsible for his wife's sin as I am. Opinions differ, my lord. The burial was... Yes. And you did not mutilate the person? No. Good. The law can go too far. It can too far. I ask myself... ""Would Jesus do it thusly?"" There is so much done in Christendom of which Christ would be incapable. You must release your brother. I cannot do without him. My-My brother, my lord bishop, uh, is possessed by the devil... and must be... examined. Your brother is as mad as you are. He grieves. Without your brother, I cannot finish my church. Let him out. And give him this. And tell him that he is at the very center of my prayers. The bishop needs you. Release him. On your feet. This is not heaven. It's the world. And there's troubles in it. Do yourself no injury. Other men are always good for that. And what of Jerusalem? Jerusalem? In peril, my lord, as always. We have stood there against the Saracens for over a hundred years. The Saracens, as you call them, have now unified in Egypt... Syria and all Arabia. Saracens and someone new. Saladin, the king. Gibberish. Very fine. And yet, you do not drink. A knight should be a knight... a monk a monk. Brother. Not both. One, that's what I say. Now I may be old-fashioned, but, as for the cup... I have, uh, an artificer, uh, a blacksmith. Or did have. Which son of the blacksmith of my time is the blacksmith now? Balian, the eldest. His child died. His wife fell into a melancholy. She would not listen to reason. She killed herself... it occurs. But what's that to you? Private matter. It's been six and 20 years since my brother took the cross. Now he returns an actual baron of the kingdom of Jerusalem. How is that for the lot of the younger brother? With no heir, comes to me and thus to you. Then I thank the stars for my uncle. Go on. Her grave was here. Or was it there? I'm afraid I can't tell you the exact location. I wasn't present at the burial. Call me a liar. You have reason. You never fight back. Hmm? Hmm? You always turn the other cheek. I think that you conceive yourself without sin. That is a sin! We shall work. I told you to stop that now! That is the man. That is the man. You're an armorer, yes? An artificer according to your lord and this priest. You have my sympathy and my blessing. Your dead wife and stillborn child are today the subject of my prayers. We need all these horses shod. We need food, and we'll pay. Says yes. Have you killed any? Have you killed any? He has made great engines for sieges. He has made war machines that cast the largest stones. He also works finely in silver. He will be one of the few on your journey worth more alive than dead. Shut up. Have you been at war? On horse. And as an enginer also. Against whom and for whom did you fight? For one lord against another... on a point which cannot be remembered. There's better game now... one god against another. The pay is proportionate. I've been telling him that. Do you still advise what you advised upon the road? I do, my lord. But know that this man Balian mourns his wife. What does that say? ""What man is a man who does not make the world better?"" Leave me with this man. God has made us man. We must suffer all. I also have lost. Some say Jerusalem is the very center of the world for asking forgiveness. For myself, I call it here. Now. I knew your namesake. I knew your mother. To be courteous, I should say that it was against her objections. But I was the lord's brother and she had no choice. But I did not force her. I have forgiveness to ask of you. I am Godfrey, the baron of Ibelin. I have 100 men at arms in Jerusalem. If you will come with me, you will have a living... and... you will have my thanks. There it is. Whoever you are, my lord... my place is here. What made it your place is now dead. You will never see me again. If you want anything of me, take it now. I want nothing. I am sorry for your troubles. God protect you. Jerusalem is easy to find. You come to where the men speak Italian... then continue until they speak something else. We go by Messina. Good-bye. The village does not want you. When the old lord is dead, they will drive you out. When the bishop is dead, it is certain. And you take my property. The Church. You. They would have taken you to Jerusalem... away from... all this. I arranged it. I swear to you... you will have no peace so long as you stay here. No man ever needed a new world more. Imagine your sin and pain erased. All. If you take the Crusade... you may relieve your wife's position in hell. I put it delicately... She was a suicide. She is in hell. Though what she does there without a head... Wait here. Have you come to kill me? Even these days, it is not easy. Well? I have done... murder. Haven't we all? Is it true... that in Jerusalem I can erase my sins... and those of my wife? Is it true? We can find out together. Show me your hand. Hey! Pick it up. Let's see what you're made of. His hand is hurt, my lord. I once fought two days with an arrow through my testicle. Ah, yes. Never use a low guard. You fight well. Let's work on your skills. Take a high guard, like this. The Italians call it la poste di falcone... the guard of the hawk. Strike from high, like this. Do it. Sword straighter. Come on. Leg back, bend your knees. Sword straighter. Defend yourself. The blade isn't the only part of a sword. Attack. I have your leave? Pay attention. What's this? Uncle. Nephew. You have with you a man, Balian, who killed a priest, his brother. I'm charged by both my father and the lord bishop to bring him back. What he says is true. They have the right to take me. I say he is innocent of the charge. If you say he's guilty, then we'll fight, and God will decide the truth of it. My German friend is a close student of the law. Just give him to me. I'll fight you for something else. Uncle, he's a murderer. So am I. Whoever dies here today, you will certainly be among them. You are my uncle. I must give you the road. Hyah! Hyah! Heinrich! Aah! To the flanks! Aah! Hyah! Aah! Hyah! Come on! Hyah! Thank my brother for his love! I am the son of Roger... Take your helmet off while addressing me. I'm am the son of Roger de Cormiere. I am accorded the privilege of ransom. This is true. Ah. Well, you broke the arrow. If the ribs are broken, some marrow may enter the blood... in which case you'll take a fever and die. Or a cyst will form... and you'll live. You're in the hands of God. Get me some more wine. It was not... that they had no right to take you. It was the way they asked. They had the right to take me. So do I. To kill an infidel, the pope has said, is not murder. It is the path to heaven. To kill an infidel, the pope has said, is not murder. It is the path to heaven. Godfrey. To kill an infidel, the pope has said, is not murder. It is the path to heaven. Where do you go? To Jerusalem, brother. By which road? Someone knows. God knows. When shall we stop this madness? It will soon be beyond my concern. Who is this? My son. Would I have fought you when you were still capable of making bastards. I knew your mother when she was making hers. Fortunately, you're too old to be one of mine. All will be settled. Do you know... what lies in the Holy Land? A new world. A man who, in France, had not a house... is, in the Holy Land, the master of a city. He who was the master of a city begs in the gutter. There, at the end of the world... you are not what you were born... but what you have it in yourself to be. I hope to find forgiveness. That's all I know. Whatever your position, you are of my house... and that means you will serve the king of Jerusalem. What could a king ask of a man like me? A better world than has ever been seen. A kingdom of conscience. A kingdom of heaven. There is peace between Christian and Muslim. We live together. Or, between Saladin and the king, we try. Did you think that lay at the end of Crusade? It does. My son, you are all that survives me. Do not disappoint me. When we took the Holy Land, we took the Saracen trading ports. Italian ships carry silks and spices and pilgrims, if they have money. And Italy becomes rich as the Savior intended. Who are those men? Muslims. Saracens. And they're allowed their prayers? If they pay the tax. Subhena Rabi Alladin. Praise be to God. It is proper to praise him. Sounds like our prayers. It's good. When the king is dead... Jerusalem will be no place for friends of Muslims... or traitors to Christendom... like your father. I am Guy de Lusignan. Remember that name. And me. - Keep it. - My lord. How will you ride if you have no stick to beat the horse? He will be king in Jerusalem one day. Holy mother of God, pray for us... now and at the hour of our death. Balian. Hurry. I can go no further. Get on your knees. Be without fear in the face of your enemies. Be brave and upright that God may love thee. Speak the truth always, even if it leads to your death. Safeguard the helpless and do no wrong. That is your oath. And that's so you remember it. Arise a knight and baron of Ibelin. Defend the king. I- If the king is no more... protect the people. It is time now, my lord, to confess to holy God, not your son. Are you sorry for all your sins? For all but one. You sail now for Jerusalem, as your father wished. I'll follow within the week. Now the voyage is perilous. If God has purpose for you there, he'll keep you safe in his hands. If not... God bless you. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. He says that is his horse. Why would it be his horse? Because it is on his land! I took this horse from the sea. He says you are a great liar... and he will fight you because you are a liar. I have no desire to fight. Then you must give him the horse. No. Fight me fairly! Why? Why should he? He is a knight. And I am the baron of Ibelin. He says the baron of Ibelin is old. He knew him at Damascus. I am the new one. Stop! Ibelin, that's enough! Ibelin, no! You have taken it very well that I have killed your master. It was the end of his time. All is as God wills it. Now finish this. Take me to Jerusalem. Very good horse. Take the horse... and be about your business. This is your prize of battle. I am your prisoner... your slave, should you wish it. I have been a slave, or very near to one. I will never keep one, nor suffer any to be kept. Go. The man you killed was a very great cavalier among the Muslims. His name was Mummad al Fais. I will pray for him. Your quality will be known among your enemies... before ever you meet them, my friend. Old man, where is it that Christ was crucified? Salaam alaikum. God, what is it you want of me? How can you be in hell when you're in my heart? You must have known him. What? Since you carry Godfrey's sword, you must have known him. I did. A man my size? Yes. And green eyes. Blue. Come with us... my lord. No. Give me the towel. Give me the towel. Give me the towel. A man who, in France, had not a house... is, in the Holy Land, the master of a city. Stop. You're hurting him. Whoa. Whoa. Where's your master? I have none. Give me some water. Thank you for the drink. If you happen to see Balian, the son of Godfrey... tell him that Sibylla called. So, how find you Jerusalem? God does not speak to me. Not even on the hill... where Christ died. I am outside God's grace. I have not heard that. At any rate, it seems... I have lost my religion. I put no stock in religion. By the word ""religion""... I've seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of God. I've seen too much religion in the eyes of too many murderers. Holiness... is in right action... and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves. And goodness... what God desires... is here and here. By what you decide to do every day, you will be a good man. Or not. Come. The king has made a peace with Saladin these past six years. He holds Jerusalem as a place for prayer for all faiths... as the Muslims did before we came. These men are Templars. They killed Arabs. So they are dying... for what the pope would command them to do. Yes. But not Christ, I think. Nor this king. Who says I raid? That witness... all of Jerusalem... holy God and me. That witness, if you call him that, is a Saracen. He lies. There will come a day, Reynald de Chatillon... when you are not protected by your title. Oh? When will that be? Alert me, Tiberias, when men are equal... and the kingdom of heaven has arrived. Those Templars have been hung for a raid that I know you commanded. Prove it. I will wait at Kerak until you do. The king will take your castle of Kerak, Reynald. Try to take it, Tiberias. I'll be there. I cannot protect your caravans unless you agree to be escorted by our soldiers. I trade to make money... not to offend God by associating with Christians. But you will take Christian gold. Gold is gold. Mmm. Of course. My lord Tiberias. My lord. It's true. You're your father's son. He was my friend. I am yours. Godfrey dead. It could have come at a better time. Come. It was shouted in the streets that you killed a great lord of Syria. Saladin himself sent word... that your fight did not breach the peace... that you had cause. What know you of Saladin? That he is king of the Saracens... and that he surrounds this kingdom. He has 200,000 men in Damascus alone. He could win a war if he goes to war... and he's daily given cause for war by fanatics newly from Europe... by Templar bastards like Reynald de Chatillon. Here, from this room, I keep the peace, so far as it can be kept. But Saladin and the king between them... would make a better world. If it lives only for a while, Tiberias, it still has lived. All right. What did your father tell you of your... obligations? That I was to be a good knight. I pray the world... and Jerusalem... can accommodate such a rarity... as a perfect knight. Have you dined? The Princess Sibylla of Jerusalem... and her husband, Guy de Lusignan. So, how many knights did you find in France? Fifty. They've sworn allegiance to the king? Of course, Tiberias. Obviously. You sit at my table? Is it not the king's table? Is it? I have not seen a king at it for some years. I cannot eat. I... I am finicky about company. In France this could not inherit. But here there are no civilized rules. I have business in the East. My wife does not lament my absences. That is either the best of wives... or the very, very worst. Do you go to meet Reynald? No, my lord. He is in disfavor. I am a member of this court. Why should I make league with that... troublemaker? To the very best of wives. God bless Jerusalem. My lord, the king will see him now. The king would see Godfrey's son. I'll take him. This morning I spoke without knowing who you were. I knew who you were. It's unmistakable. I loved your father... and I shall love you. Do you fear being with me? No. And yes. A woman in my place has two faces. One for the world... and one which she wears in private. With you I'll be only Sibylla. Tiberias thinks me unpredictable. I am unpredictable. No. There. Come forward. I am glad to meet Godfrey's son. He was one of my greatest teachers. He was there when, playing with the other boys, my arm was cut. And it was he, not my father's physicians, who noticed that I felt no pain. He wept when he gave my father the news... that I am a leper. The Saracens say that this disease... is God's vengeance against the vanity of our kingdom. As wretched as I am... these Arabs believe that the chastisement that awaits me in hell... is far more severe and lasting. If that's true, I call it unfair. Come. Sit. Do you play? No. The whole world is in chess. Any move can be the death of you. Do anything except remain where you started... and you can't be sure of your end. Were you sure of your end once? I was. What was it? To be buried a hundred yards from where I was born. And now? Now I sit in Jerusalem and look upon a king. When I was 16 I won a great victory. I felt, in that moment, I would live to be 100. Now I know I shall not see 30. None of us know our end, really... or what hand will guide us there. A king may move a man. A father may claim a son. That man can also move himself. And only then does that man truly begin his own game. Remember, how so ever you are played... or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone... even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power. When you stand before God, you cannot say... ""But I was told by others to do thus""... or that virtue was not convenient at the time. This will not suffice. Remember that. I will. You know what this is? A fortification. What do you think of it? You disapprove. Well, how would you improve it? A cross. Or better, a star, like this. That way no part of the fortress may be approached... without being exposed to fire from another part. Yes, I like this. Your walls are more difficult to address. Very good. You will go to your father's house at Ibelin, your house now... and then from there you will protect the pilgrim road. Safeguard in particular the Jews and the Muslims. All are welcome in Jerusalem. Not only because it's expedient, but because it is right. Protect the helpless. And then maybe one day, when I am helpless... you will come and protect me. There, my lord. Ibelin. Quod sumus... hoc eritis. Such as we are, you will be. Your father was important. His lands were not. That will suit me. My lord, you have a thousand acres... a hundred families. You have Christians, Jews, Muslims. You have 50 pairs of oxen. This is a poor and dusty place. What we do not have is water. Right. Stone the walls. I'm on my way to Cana. Where Jesus changed water to wine. But a better trick would be to change you to a nobleman. That should be easy. In France a few yards of silk can make a nobleman. I expect your hospitality. It is given. Latif. But this isn't adultery. It's washing. But if it were adultery... which it isn't... the Commandments are not for people like us. They are for the others. Did they give you something to eat? They said to wait until the master returned. My cook will prepare something while you wash. What? It seems years since I've seen a woman eat. Truly? I was watching you today. You've been given a patch of dirt, and it seems... you will build a new Jerusalem here. It is my land. Who would I be if I did not try to make it better? They try to be one... one heart... one morality. Their prophet says, ""Submit."" Jesus says... ""Decide."" Did you decide on Guy? Guy was chosen by my mother. My first husband died before our son was born. I was only 15. I've met your son. I could stay here forever. This house is yours. Why do you think I'm here? I know that Ibelin is not on the way to Cana. What else do you know, my lord? I know that you are a princess... and I am no lord. You're a knight. Neither earned nor proved. I'm not here with you because I'm... I'm bored or wicked. I'm here because... because in the East... between one person and another... there is only light. Halt! This caravan is armed, Reynald. Good. No sport otherwise. They've seen us. Go after them. A rider is getting away. It's a broad desert. Nothing'll come of it. I prefer not to be hanged before my wife is queen. Don't worry. ""Who but Reynald?"" they'll say. It's always me. They'll believe it in Jerusalem, I assure you. You were at Nazareth, praying. You're a dangerous man. If the war's to be now or later, I would have it now. How long can the leper last? God wills it. God wills it! God wills it! Jerusalem! Charge! It's you! Ha! This is from France. I've never been there. This from my brother. This to remind us of death. And this... I bought the day I saw you. You lie. Guy de Lusignan and Reynald de Chatillon, with the Templars... have attacked a Saracen caravan. Liar! Silence! It was no caravan. It was an army headed for Bethlehem to desecrate the birthplace of our Lord! Reynald, with the Templars, have broken the king's pledge of peace. Saladin will come into this kingdom... Tiberias knows more than a Christian should about Saladin's intentions. That I would rather live with men than kill them... is certainly why you are alive. That sort of Christianity has its uses, I suppose. We must not go to war with Saladin! We do not want it, and we may not win it. Blasphemy! Blasphemy! An army of Jesus Christ, which bears his holy cross, cannot be beaten. Does the count of Tiberias suggest that it could be? There must be war. God wills it! God wills it! God wills it! God wills it! God wills it! Silence! Saladin has crossed the Jordan with 200,000 men. He will make first for Kerak and Reynald de Chatillon. My lord... We must meet him before he reaches Kerak. I will lead the army. My lord, if you travel, you'll die. Send word to Balian to protect the villagers. Assemble the army. What becomes of us? The world will decide. The world always decides. My lord! The king is marching on Kerak. Let's go! Hurry. Straight on! Saracen cavalry. They're coming to close Reynald in. These people are not safe outside the walls. Saladin will certainly come behind him. Go into the fortress now. Hyah! Hah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Visitors! My lord Balian! My lord Balian! My lord Reynald prays you bring your force into Kerak. Thank you, but no. If we do, these people will die. We'll hold the Saracen cavalry until the king arrives. So be it. Hyah! We cannot attack that and live. My lady. What do you look at? A knight. His men. Are you with me? Forward! Divide! Your quality will be known among your enemies... before ever you meet them, my friend. You were not that man's servant. No. He was my servant. What becomes of us? As you deserve. You reap what you sow. You have heard of this, no? Get up. You may go into Kerak... but you will die there. My master is here. Tell my lord Saladin that Jerusalem has come. Saladin. I pray you'll pull back your cavalry and leave this matter to me. I pray you'll retire unharmed to Damascus. Reynald of Chatillon will be punished. I swear it. Withdraw, or we will all die here. Do we have terms? We have terms. I will send you my physicians. Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam. I am Reynald of Chatillon! On your knees. Lower. I... am Jerusalem. And you, Reynald... will give me the kiss of peace. Guard. What are you looking at? A dead man. Reynald de Chatillon, you are arrested... and condemned. Come. If you continue like this... I shall have to find a use for you. If God can spare you, that is. God does not know me. Yes, but I do. I need you in Jerusalem. Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam. Why did we retire? Why? God did not favor him. God, alone, determines the results of battles. The results of battles are determined by God... but also by preparation, numbers... the absence of disease and the availability of water. One cannot maintain a siege with the enemy behind. How many battles did God win for the Muslims before I came? That is, before God determined that I should come. Few enough. That's because we were sinful. It is because you were unprepared. If you think that way, you shall not be king for long. When I am not king, I quake for Islam. Thank you for your visit. Thank you for your visit. You promised. You promised to return Jerusalem. Don't forget. If I do not deliver war, I have no peace. The king of Jerusalem will die soon. When he is dead, the boy will become king of a kingdom he cannot control. The Christians will make the war you need. I am Reynald de Chatillon! I am Reynald de Chatillon! Reynald de Chatillon! Reynald de Chatillon! The things that we have left undone... plague us as death comes. That is why to the dying... There is no comfort but the Lord. Spare me your sermon. Go and prepare your people for the coronation of my nephew. Your confession, my lord. I shall confess to God when I see him... not to you. Now leave me. You sometimes dream you are my wife. Let's pretend you are. I must go. We can't meet in the city. Then we will leave it. And live how? Live where? Balian... my brother's dying. My son will be king and I his regent. I must rule for him. And not just in Jerusalem, but Acre... Ashkelon, Beirut. And Guy? Always surround your knights with your foot soldiers. These rooms are not yours. One day I will be the husband I was commissioned to be. And perhaps not, my dear. Your lover has a hundred knights and the love of the king. I, the largest force in the kingdom... and the support of the Templars. I can do without the king's affection. But as for your love... Then we must come to an understanding. You need my knights or his rule will be bloody and brief. So, my friend... the time has come to conclude my affairs. If I leave the army with Guy... he will take power through my sister and make war on the Muslims. We have decided that you shall take command of the army of Jerusalem. Will you defend my nephew when he's king? Whatever you ask. I will serve. No, hear it all before you answer. Would you marry my sister, Sibylla, were she free of Guy de Lusignan? And Guy? He will be executed... along with his knights who do not swear your allegiance. I cannot be the cause of that. ""Whatever you ask. I will serve."" ""A king may move a man,"" you said... ""but the soul belongs to the man."" Yes, I did. You have my love... and my answer. Oh. So be it. Why do you protect Guy, hmm? He's a man who insults you, who hates you... who'd kill you himself if he had the chance. Fulfill the salvation of this kingdom. Would it be so hard... to marry Sibylla? Jerusalem has no need of a perfect knight. No. It is a kingdom of conscience... or nothing. Sibylla. Who are you to refuse a king? I will have power, without Guy or with him. Guy is indebted to your say-so and my brother's, but it's mine. Do you have any idea of Jerusalem except that it is yours? You will never hold it in peace as your brother did. It will be war. My grandfather took Jerusalem in blood. I'll keep it the same way or any way I can. I am what I am. I offer you that... and the world. You say no. Do you think I'm like Guy? That I would sell my soul? There'll be a day... when you will wish you had done a little evil... to do a greater good. Reynald. My lord. Mmm. Do you really think the king wants you head of the army once he's gone? Hmm? Think your wife does? I have a problem. Ah, yes. Balian. I saw him at Kerak. Celebrated. You must beware a popular man. Kill him. What's that? England. The king? Richard. And his father was Henry. Good. And that? France. Will I ever see France? Maybe one day. But you must be king here. How many islands can you see here? One, two... The king will see you. No, I can't. I can't bear to look at him. Use this. It doesn't mean I don't love him. Go, madam. Oh. Hello. I was dreaming... I was back in that summer... when I defeated Saladin. Do you remember it? I was only 16. You were a beautiful boy. Yes. You have always been beautiful. In every way. My beautiful sister. I've missed you. So beautiful. I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain. Remember me as I was. I will. Sibylla. If my son has your knights... you have your wife. Behold your rightful king and heir... to the throne of the kingdom of Jerusalem. Yes! Yes! Yes! Long live the king in prosperity. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. One may stare into the light until one becomes the light. I've done it many times. There's your religion. One spark, a creosote bush. There's your Moses. I did not hear it speak. That does not mean that there is no God. Do you love her? Yes. The heart will mend. Your duty is to the people of the city. I go to pray. For what? For the strength to endure what is to come. And what is to come? The reckoning is to come for what was done 100 years before. The Muslims will never forget. Nor should they. My lady, your letter to Saladin. Peace to be sustained, borders respected, trade allowed to continue. Is this wise to show your intentions? Better, surely, to let him wonder. We keep my brother's peace. Sign it. Take the seal. Be careful. Be careful. Put it back, my darling. Hey! There is a rumor. We must condemn it immediately. Call it treason, and kill those who whisper it. The rumor will die if we show the boy as active. How long before he wears a mask? Will you have one made for him? How did my boy deserve it? Jerusalem is dead, Tiberias. No kingdom is worth my son alive in hell. I will go to hell instead. Do you remember the story of Llewellyn? No. Well, do you remember why? No. He was so lonely... and he called all the gods. Why? Because he was desperate. It was a proof of love. Is this why you came to the Holy Land? Come on! Leave us. The boy's in heaven? Yes. His mother has more backbone than I do. She's in the crypt and will not come out. Have the Templars killed Balian? Yes. Reynald... give me a war. That is what I do. Behold your rightful queen and heir... to the throne of the kingdom of Jerusalem. Yes! Yes! Yes! I, Sibylla, by the grace of the Holy Spirit... choose as king Guy de Lusignan... the man who's been my husband. With the help of God, he will rule his people well. Long live the king in prosperity. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. I am what I am. Someone has to be. Saladin's sister. I know. Saladin achki. I know. Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam. Speak. The sultan demands the return of his sister's body... the heads of those responsible... and the surrender of Jerusalem. Does he? What answer do you return to Saladin? This. Take the head to Damascus. I am Jerusalem. Assemble the army! Yea! Now this assembly of barons... and all Jerusalem is complete. There are those among you who may disagree with our succession... but it is war. Aye! And I am... the king. We march at once. What say this council? Aye! No. If you must have war, this army cannot move away from water. You have a chance to hold the city... but if you move out against Saladin... this army will be destroyed and the city left defenseless. When I wish a blacksmith to advise me in war... I will tell him. Saladin wants you to come out. He is waiting for you to make that mistake. He knows his man. We should meet the enemies of God. Aye! And so we shall. Then you do so without my knights. Then I will have the glory, Tiberias. You had yours years and years ago. It's time for mine. Forward! Forward! Tiberias. When Saladin has finished with Guy, he will come. We must look to the defenses. The boy's dead. Guy. No. The boy was leprous like his uncle. She gave him peace. She let him go... and Jerusalem along with him. Keep to your lines! You go with the army? My order is with the army. You go to certain death. All death is certain. I shall tell your father what I've seen you become. When Saladin comes... we're not defensible. Save the people from what I have done. I will. God wills it. Can you sense it? There has been no messenger. I drink water for what it is. I did not give the cup to you. No, my lord. A king does not kill a king. Were you not close enough to a great king... to learn by his example? I've given Jerusalem my whole life. Everything. First I thought we... were fighting for God. Then I realized we were fighting for wealth and land. I was ashamed. Tiberias. There is no more Jerusalem. I shall go to Cyprus. Will you come with me? No. You are your father's son. Saladin must move his army from water to water. That gives you four days, maybe five. God be with you. He's no longer with me. Mark 400. Four hundred! Four hundred! They're here. It is only one man. No. They're here. This is the only section of the wall that they can attack... once they begin to bombard the walls. They will stop only to avoid hitting their own siege towers as they come in. We take the bombardment. When they cease firing, we fire. We must leave the city. How exactly, my lord bishop? The fastest horses from a lesser gate. And the people? It is unfortunate about the people, but it is God's will. Silence! Silence! It has fallen to us... to defend Jerusalem... and we have made our preparations as well as they can be made. None of us took this city from Muslims. No Muslim, of the great army now coming against us... was born when this city was lost. We fight over an offense we did not give... against those who were not alive to be offended. What is Jerusalem? Your holy places lie over the Jewish temple... that the Romans pulled down. The Muslim places of worship lie over yours. Which is more holy? The wall? The mosque? The sepulcher? Who has claim? No one has claim. All have claim! That is blasphemy. Be quiet. We defend this city... not to protect these stones... but the people living within these walls. My lord. My lord, my lord. How are we to defend Jerusalem without knights? We have no knights! Truly? What is your condition? I'm servant to the patriarch. He's, uh, one of my servants. Is he? You were born a servant? Kneel. Every man at arms... or capable of bearing them... kneel! On your knees! Be without fear in the face of your enemies. Be brave and upright that God may love thee. Speak the truth even if it leads to your death. Safeguard the helpless. That is your oath. And that is so you remember it. Rise a knight. Rise a knight! Master Gravedigger. It is you. Not what I was. Nor are you. Rise a knight. Who do you think you are? Will you alter the world? Does making a man a knight make him a better fighter? Yes. Almaric... if you survive, Ibelin is yours. You are master of Ibelin. I confirm it. Rise a knight and baron of Ibelin. But it is a poor and dusty place. My lord? No. When will it begin? Soon. Get them to the walls! Water! Bring water! Get to the walls. Push! Run! Push! Why do they not fire back? They wait. That was only the first day. There may be a hundred more. Saladin will show no mercy. We must hold out... force him to offer terms. What terms? We fight for the people... their safety and freedom. Mercy. No. I cannot. Four hundred! Four hundred! Four hundred! Fire! Fire! Three hundred! Three hundred! Fire! Fire! Fire! One-fifty! One-fifty! Line up! Fire! Hold your fire! Hold! Fire! Fire! Oil! Now! Fire! Who defends? Balian of Ibelin, the son of Godfrey. Godfrey. Godfrey nearly killed me in the Lebanon. Truly, I did not know he had a son. It was his son at Kerak. The one you let live. Yes. Perhaps you should not have. Perhaps I should have had a different teacher. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Now! You are not a sister. We are what we do. Then I'm a man who's traveled a long way to die for nothing. What would you say to that? I- I would say that I'm sorry. And I'm sorry for you... Queen of Jerusalem. When a body is burnt... it cannot be resurrected until Judgment Day. If we do not burn these bodies... we will all be dead of disease in three days. God will understand, my lord. And if he doesn't... then he is not God, and we need not worry. Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam. The wall, where the Christopher Gate used to be, has been weakened. Usually when a gate is blocked in, it is weaker than the wall around it. Or stronger. It is weaker. Rashid has seen it. This will be our door into Jerusalem. This is where we will make our stand. We must prepare. Brothers! Brothers! God has sent you this day! You will take no prisoners! As they did, so shall it be done! Allah hu akbar! Allah hu akbar! When this wall comes down... there will be no quarter. If you throw down your arms... your families will die. We can break this army here. So I say let them come! Let them come! Come on! Come on! Come on! Remember me in France, Master Gravedigger. My lord! They will ask for terms. They must ask for terms. Convert to Islam. Repent later. You've taught me a lot about religion, Your Eminence. Will you yield the city? Before I lose it, I will burn it to the ground. Your holy places, ours. Every last thing in Jerusalem that drives men mad. I wonder if it would not be better if you did. You will destroy it? Every stone. And every Christian knight you kill will take 10 Saracens with him. You will destroy your army here and never raise another. I swear to God that to take this city will be the end of you. Your city is full of women and children. If my army will die... so will your city. You offer terms. I ask none. I will give every soul safe conduct to Christian lands. Every soul... the women, the children, the old... and all your knights and soldiers, and your queen. Your king, such as he is... I leave to you... and what God will make of him. No one will be harmed. I swear to God. The Christians butchered every Muslim within the walls when they took this city. I am not those men. I am Saladin. Saladin. Then under these terms, I surrender Jerusalem. Salaam alaikum. And peace be with you. What is Jerusalem worth? Nothing. Everything. I have surrendered Jerusalem. All will be safely escorted to the sea. If this is the kingdom of heaven... let God do with it as he wills. Balian! Balian! Yes! Thanks to the Lord! Your brother's kingdom was here... and here. That kingdom can never be surrendered. What should I do? I'm still the queen of Acre, Ashkelon, Tripoli. Decide not to be a queen... and I will come to you. The perfect knight. Is that what you think you are, is it? We are all of us what we do. Do it. When you rise again... if you rise... rise a knight. This horse... is not a very good horse. I will not keep it. Thank you. And if God does not love you... how could you have done all the things that you have done? Peace be upon you. Alaikum salaam. A queen never walks. And yet you are walking. Forward! Forward! Halt! We crusade to recover the kingdom of Jerusalem. You go to where the men speak Italian... and then continue until they speak something else. We've come by this road to find Balian... who was defender of Jerusalem. I am the blacksmith. And I am the king of England. I am the blacksmith. Formation! Forward!

It was an accident, sir. Yes, I remember your case very well. -You ran a man down with your car... -Yes, sir, It was New Year's Eve... You were drunk. -Yes, sir. -Now you're here to pay for that crime... with ten years of your life. Do you realize that? Yes, sir. Your sentence can be reduced by good behavior and close observance of the prison rules. While you're not in the common sense of the word a criminal, I want to warn you against the influences you'll encounter here... or In any other prison. Yes, sir. So you be careful of your conduct... and your associations. Yes, sir. And remember this. Prison does not give a man a yellow streak. but if he has one, it brings it out. That's all. Well, Raggart, what is it? Do you know who they're putting that boy in with? No. Who? Morgan. The slickest crook we ever had here. And Machine Gun Butch. Yes? A weak kid like that thrown in with a murderer and a gun man? Now, now, Pop, don't you get chicken-hearted again. He might have a chance in a cell alone. Yes, I warned them at the last governor's council. We have 3,000 here and cell accommodations for 1800. They all want to throw people into prison but they don't want to provide for them after they are in. And you mark my word, Pop. Someday we're going to pay for this shortsightedness. Sure, the whole prison system is cockeyed. -Yeah? -Here's a peach for you, Sandy. -Goes In 265 with Butch and Morgan. -Okay. Come on, boy. Upstairs to the left. Here we are. Hello, Jim. Take off your ear muffs. I said hello. Hello. Make yourself at home. That's your flop up there. Thank you. What's your name? I said what's your name? Kent Marlowe. Mine's Schmidt. I'm known the world over as Machine Gun Butch. You heard of me. That's a cinch. You never heard of the Delancey gang being wiped out? Well, I done the wipin'. $500 bucks for bumping off three. That ain't much, it's cheap. What's your racket? What you in for? -Manslaughter. -Manslaughter! Well, you ain't no morning glory after all. Press the flesh. Who did you croak? -It was an accident. -An accident? Yeah, I was driving a car... -Oh, you're all wet ears. Your nose ain't even dry. -What do you mean? -I'll show you what I mean, kid. I'll learn you a lot of things before we're through with you in here. Morg, there's company in the parlor. Morgan is my name. Kent's mine. How are you? Don't you ever have any air in here? Sure, plenty. All hot. How long have you been here? Three years. -What for? -Robbery. I can't stand thieves. -Hey, my cigarettes. -What? You took my cigarettes. Why, you dirty little liar, you didn't have no cigarettes. Yes, I did, and you stole them. Stop your belly aching before I slough you one. Come on, give me back those cigarettes. You're dingy, you didn't have no cigarettes. Give me those cigarettes! -Oh, get out! -I'll show you crooks I won't stand for treatment like this. Hey, guards! Stop your squawking. Crooks, are we? -Well, Mr. High Hat, I'll show... -Let go of me! Pipe down, pipe down... Hey, hey, what's wrong in here? -He took my cigarettes. -Did he, Morgan? I don't know, sir. I was asleep. Did you take the kid's cigarettes? No, sir... They're both lying! Less noise or you'll spend your first night in the dungeon. Aw, don't put the kid in the cooler. He's clean. He just went off his nuts. He won't do it again. Well, you watch your stuff, understand? Well, mister yellowbelly, you're gonna get your first lesson right now. You can't squeal and in stir. That's that. Now lay off that stuff, Butch, do you hear? Aw, he's only stunned. I didn't bat him hard. -Put him in his bunk. -Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Now give him back his cigarettes. -What? -You heard me. Why, I ain't got his old weeds. Don't lie to me, Butch. Say, listen, I bumped off guys for calling me a liar. Yeah, and look where you are now. -Who me? -Yes, you. Well, look where you are too. That's right, Butch, both of us. The quick and the dead, the clever and the dumb. What? You know, from the neck down you're a regular guy, Butch. Now give the kid back his cigarettes. -Who me? -Yes, you. Okay. I was only kidding. -Just kidding, that's all. -Sure, I knew that all the time. Now put them up in his pocket. I said put them up in his pocket. Gee! It reminds me of Sadie. Gee, Sadie was a good old skirt. I shouldn't have slipped her that ant poison. I should've just battered her in the jaw a few times. -Get off of my stones, will ya? -Get back into line there. You got everything all set? Sure, this time... We heard you're slated to get out soon. What do you mean? Who told you that? Jim, the trusty over at the warden's office. He's in on everything. And he heard something about me? Yeah, the warden said you're too nice a kid to keep here. -They're gonna let me go? -Sure they are. How soon? Just as soon as the warden gets the ok from the governor. -Gee, you're a lucky guy. -Are you Kent Marlowe? -Yeah. -Wallace wants to see you. What does he want to see me for? To tell you the good news, that you've been pardoned. Gee, that's great. Wait a minute. Aren't you gonna say good bye? Sure, good bye. Be good, Kent. So long, kid. Hey, where are you heading? -Captain Wallace wants to see me. -You can't go in there. Get back. What's going on out here? They said you wanted to see me, sir, about my parole. Who said that? They did, that trusty over there... It's true, isn't It? They weren't ribbing me, were they? Sure, they're kidding you, Kent. Then I'm not going out. No, you're going to be with us for a long time. Go on, beat it. Sore are you? What's the matter, boy? Are you going home? Hey, you. No ganging up here. Come on, keep this place clear. Scatter out. Hey, Pop, any letters for me? Move on, now. If there was, I wouldn't give them to you. Oh, go on, be a sport, will you? Are there any letters for Morgan? You know, Pop, if all screws were like you... Oh, you cut out the apple sauce. And don't be calling the guards screws. Yes, sir. No letters for you, Morgan. But I've got one for Butch and Kent. Fine, I'll take them to them. Thanks, Pop. -I used to milk a cow all the time. -Letter for you, Butch. -Letter for me? -Yes, you. Gee, why don't those dames let me alone? You're such a deal, Butch. You can't blame them. Where's Kent? Haven't seen him. Hey, stick around. I'll bet this is a hot one. Oh, boy. Look at that. Why, it's from Myrtle. -Myrtle? -Yeah. -I thought you croaked her. -No, that was Sadie. This girl is nuts about me. -About you? -Yes, me. Wait a minute, I'll show you. ""Dear sweetheart..."" ""How I miss my great big boy."" ""You have it."" Hot doggy. ""The only fun I get is sleeping... because then I dream about you every night."" The rest of this is too juicy for you guys. Nobody gets to read this but me and my pal Morg. Come on, Morg. Aw, come on. Go on, dream about it. I'm going to read this. You and me, Morg. Hey, come on, scram. -Hey, what's the big idea? -Get out of here, go on, go on. Say, Morg... Who do you suppose would write me a letter? I'll read It to you, Butch. Say, if I even knew a dame called Myrtle, I'd kick her teeth out. Go on, read it. Who's it from? Well, it's about your mother, Butch. -My old lady? -Yeah. Gee, she's been holding out on me. I didn't even know she could write. Well, It isn't from her, Butch. It's from a guy named Tony Loop. -It's about... -Nothing wrong. Go on, read it. ""Dear Butch, when your mother was sick, ""She didn't want me to write no letter and tell you, ""Even when they took her to the county hospital. ""I went to see her a couple of times, ""And she said you had enough to worry ""Without having to think about her. ""Anyway, she... ""She died yesterday. ""And as we couldn't get enough money to give her a send-off, ""we had to let the hospital take care of it. ""Anyway, we sent her a bunch of flowers, ""And I guess that's all. Yours truly, Tony Loop."" Gee, I can't believe it, Morg. Ma's dead. -I wonder if it hurt her much. -Oh, I don't think so, Butch. -She probably just dropped off quietly. -Yeah? Yeah, she was pretty old, wasn't she? About 70... And as big as a minute... And game. And, say, the last time I was arrested, She fought like a wildcat. It took two bulls to hold her, and she almost bit the thumb off of one of them. Gee, she was a swell old lady. I wish you would have met her, Morg. So do I, Butch. Say, Morg... I'm going to make a break. I'm going to get out of here, and I'm going to give that little old lady the swellest funeral she ever had. Pipe down, will you? Here comes Oliver. Hello, Morgan. Got a match? Sure. Thanks. Good news, Butch? Bad news whenever you come around. Great kidder, isn't he, Morg? Yes, and he's not always kidding. You know, that guy's a stool pigeon if ever there was one. I wish I could get the lowdown on him. I'll knife him someday. Aw, that kind of talk won't get you anywheres. I'm going to break this place wide open. Yeah, and then what will happen to you? Down in the dungeon with the rats. No, we got to take our medicine, Butch. It's all right for you to talk, you'll be going out of here in a few years. But what do I gain eating this dirt? I'd go nuts if I didn't start trouble once in a while. I'd rather stand up and fight, and even if I got the rope, It's better than sitting here rotting in this stinking hole. Aw, cut out that talk, Butch, do you hear? -Who, me? -Yes, you. Okay. I was only kidding. Sure. Hey, listen, Butch. How about that hot number of yours? The gang wants to hear it again. Go on, read it. All right, I'll read it once more. Seen Kent around anywhere? Yeah. He's around the corner with Oliver. What about Morgan? Morgan? Who knows anything about him? But Butch... listen, Oliver. That guy will kill me someday. -He packs a knife. -Oh, he packs a knife, does he? Don't let that worry you. That knife's gonna get him into trouble. Say, listen, you guys. If I ever catch either one of you double-crossing Butch, I'm going to get you. Do you understand? -Now, Kent, you keep away from this rat. -What do you mean? He's the only guy that's been decent to me since I've been here. I was only trying to give him some good advice. Yeah? Well, beat it, do you hear? I'll give you some good advice, Kent. You're in a tough spot. But you've got to learn that whining and double-crossing isn't going to get you anywhere. I'm not whining. I won't stand for your ribbing. What right have they got to poke at me... And you, a robber, bragging about it? Oh, I see. Too good for the rest of us, huh? Well, if you're wise, you'll stand up and take your joe like a regular guy. Yeah? Yeah. Here's a letter for you. Get wise, kid. Play up to Morgan and Butch. They run the joint here, and if they're off you, they'll make it tough for you. If you're friends with them, they'll let you in on their plans. What do you mean? I'll tell you later. Oh, I wouldn't do that. Kid, you trust me. I'm your friend. These three dames were crazy about me, see. Say, Butch... Butch, I had a dream last night. Aw, cut It out. You're full of hop. A dame said to me, she said, ""if you'll come up... I...I...I was sitting on a velvet cushion, And--and about a thousand beautiful blue-eyed blondes was dancing all around me. Aw, gee, I'd go nutty over a rag doll. Hey, look. Ohh... look! Look. A beautiful butterfly! Aw, you're crazy. That's a racehorse. Look at that sucker run. I bet he'll make to the top of the wall in 10 seconds. Say, look at the build on that filly. I'll take the thin one, Butch. This is mine. Say, what'll you bet my racehorse can't trim that one of yours? You're on. Hey, Mr. Butch, I'll hold the stakes. Yeah, who's gonna hold you? Come on, get up your cigarettes. Let's have a race here. Come on, put them out there. All right, you boys, make your bets. I'll cover all your bets. Two packs of weeds on my thin one. All right, make all your bets. Cover this, Butch. I'm betting on Morgan's bug. Come on. Get in there. I'm covering. Say, listen, you... what about these? No, you...you can't because The Hawk gave me this to buy him a pair of s-s-suspenders with, and if I don't bring them back, he'll tear my head off. Aw, come on. Get in there with them. Oh, yeah. s-s-s-sure. All right. Come on, now. All right, come on, now, give me the bugs. I'll warm them up. All right. Here you go. Watch them run. You all ready? You all set? All right, there they go. Look at him go. Look at that bug go. Hey, Butch, your b-b-b-bug There he goes. Over the line, over the line. I win. I win. That's just too bad. Chewing gum. I say, no wonder that bug couldn't run. Chewing gum, eh? Who done that? Come on. What porch-climbing crook done that? You did. -Who, me? -Yes, you. What's the big idea? You wouldn't double-cross a pal, would you, Butch? Any more of you guys think I pulled a phony? -You, Joe? -Not me. -You, Putnam? -N-No. -You can't get away with that, Butch. -No? You're asking for it, ain't you? One wiggle out of you and I'll give it to you. Listen, you guys are liable to get the hole for this. Yeah, you'll get the hole, just 5' 10"". They'll have to dig it big enough for two. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah! Look out, Butch! Ditch that knife. Here comes Wallace. Well, what's coming off here? Me and Morgan was just rassling a bit, sir. Sure you weren't mixing up a little fighting with it, huh? Who, me? No, sir. You better not, or I'll fix up a lot of dark days for you. -Gambling, huh? -No, sir. Not me. How did those cigarettes and tobacco get here? Well, uh... I was packing them in my shirt, sir, and Morgan and me starts rassling, and I get sweaty, so I lay them out on the ground to dry. -Don't lie to me. -I wouldn't lie, no, sir. -Let them alone. -What's that you said? I said, yes, sir. Another move out of you, and you'll go to the dungeon. -Who did that? -I did, wrestling with Butch. Well, the next time I see you, you better have it fixed. You get me? Bring that stuff. I hate his guts. It's a good thing I warned you. If Wallace had seen that knife... Yeah. You ain't such a bad skunk as I thought you was. -Get a move on, all of you! -I'll move. I'll move. I'll move... Fish again. -That dirty, rotten, stinkin' codfish. -Yeah. It's spoiled. Oh, look! It's so terrible it's even killed one of our poor little b-b-bu-- ...cockroaches. Ohh... Nice tenderloin steak with mushrooms all over it, gee! I'd like to ram it down their throat. -Pipe down, Wallace. You talking, Butch? Who, me? No, sir. -I'll get him someday. -He's on the hunt, Butch. Tell the guys to pipe down. Pipe down. Pipe down. I can't eat that stuff! Who did that? Me! What do you think of that? I want some food. I don't want any more of this swill! -Shut up! -You give me some food to eat! -I'm not going to eat that junk! -Shut up, all of you! Come on, now! Come on! Give us some food! I ain't afraid of your guns! I ain't afraid of nobody! Come on, you yellowbellies! Let's show 'em! That volley went against the wall. The next time, shoot to kill! Butch, sit down! -Yellowbellies! Cowards! -Sit down, Butch! It's your last chance! Cover all the entrances. Listen to me, you men. I have treated you squarely, and you know it. If you got any grievances within my power to correct, ...come to me! You can't gain anything by starting a row like this. So I'm warning you for the last time. I'm running this show, and I'm ready for you. That's all. Wallace! Who started this? Butch. Take him out! The knife... What? The knife. Butch, in the aisle. -Search him! -I ain't got nothin'. No hard feelings, see? -Nothing on him, sir. -You had a knife. -Who, me? -Yes, you! -No, sir. Someone's been stringing you. -In the dungeon! What for? I was only kidding. Sure, I understand. Well, that little joke will just cost you... 30 days on bread and water in the dark! Come on. Move on! I'm sorry about Butch. -You're what? -I say, I'm sorry about Butch. Yeah? -Who is it? -Your lawyer. -Hello, John. -Hello, Canton. What's up? -Got a little surprise for you. -Yeah? Kid, I got good news for you. You're gonna be paroled. Yeah? When? 20 years from now? Don't be funny. You're gonna leave this joint tomorrow. Tomorrow? Aw, quit your kidding. I'm not kidding. It's all settled. Just came from the warden's office. Yeah? The next time you'll play it smart. You say... Hello, sis. What's the matter? You look so pale. You're not ill, are you? No, no, but you don't know how terrible it is here. What have they done to get me out? I'm sorry, dear. What do you mean? We've done everything. I saw the governor myself. He was very kind. He said he couldn't do anything. What kind of a dame would you like to have me get for you? Any kind. How'd you like a little gal like that? Say, you're a lawyer, not a magician. Okay, kid. I'll be around here with a car in the morning to pick you up. -Fine. -So long. Oh, Kent, please. I know you're big enough to see it through. You've got to. But you don't know what It's like In here. Every hour, every minute... It's torture. I'll go crazy. Honey, but, listen. You've got to... Anne, listen. Tell them to try again. All right. All visitors out! Good-Bye, good-bye, good-bye.. Good-bye. Bad news, kid? I got to serve out my full time. No, you haven't. If you get the goods on somebody, you get plenty of time off. And if you block a big job, it may open the gates for you. Thanks. How are you?  Oh, you're going to be a great comfort around here. -Who's that? -New guy to take Butch's place. Doesn't speak any English. What are you doing? I'm going out of here tomorrow. I thought you had another year. Yeah, I did, but good behavior got me off. And that's a very good thing for you to remember. Think of it. Bright lights, good food, women! Say, I saw that sister of yours in the visitors' room just now. Yeah? Yeah. That the girl that owns the bookstore? -Yeah. -Swell-Looking kid. You know, I think it's great, Kent, the way your family stick by you. Gee, I wish I had a family. I haven't even got a home. Outside, all of you. Come on, Rasputin. Frisking party.  - -Shut up! This your coat, Morgan? Yes, sir, but that's not my knife. No. It's Butch's knife. You know that. Smart, eh? -Trying to cover up Butch. -No, I wasn't, sir. You don't think I'd be crazy enough to do a thing like that -...the day before I go out, do you? -Shut up! Well, this'll just cost you your parole. -Oh, you can't do that, sir. I tell you, I never saw that knife before. It was planted on me. -Ahh... -I came In the cell, took off my coat, laid it on the bunk. There was no one In there but this fellow and... and then Kent... You did that. -I didn't do it! -Don't lie to me! I didn't do it... I guess the dungeon will cool him off a bit. Strip him! I'll get you for this, Kent! Do you hear me? I'll get you for this! -On your way. -Do you hear me? I'll get you! Shut up. Cell 48. Hello! Who are you? Morgan. Morgan, they got you? Yeah. Where are you, Butch? Second hole away from you. What happened? They found your knife on me. -My knife? -Yeah. You mean it was planted on you. Who done it? -Never mind who. -You tell me, old pal. I'll get him the first day I'm outside. I'll get him myself. Oh! I knocked over my cup of water! Oh, forget it, kid! They'll bring you another cup tomorrow night, the bighearted buzzards! Can that noise, will you? Hey, Morg! When I get out of here, I'm gonna make a break, do you hear me? Yeah? Yeah, I'll do it if I have to kill a flock of screws. How? -I'm going to use my brains. -Ha! Your what? Well, maybe I ain't got no brains, but I got strength, you hear me? Sure. Hey, when my time's up, I'll bet you I'll still be standing on my feet. -You hear that, Morg? -Yeah. And you... I bet you'll travel out of here feet first. You know, that's a swell idea. -Oh, what do you mean, a swell idea? Use your brain! # Goin' home... I'm a goin' home. # I wish you would go home. # Quiet life... # Gee, but he was a s-s-swell guy, And s-s-smart, too. One time he d-d-dug himself out from underneath a w-w-wall, And It took him 18 months to do it in. Yeah? What did he do with the dirt? Oh, he... he ate it. Well, he s-s-said he did. Aw, dry up. That plan of mine would be all right if we had somebody to work it out. Yeah, Morgan's the guy to do it. You know, he and Butch finish their stretch in the hole today. Come out of there, Butch. Come on, come on, get out of there. Oh, I'm coming out. I'm... Well, I'm still on my feet. Get Morgan out. I ain't heard his voice now for a week. I told him he'd come out of there feet first. He's flat on his back. Bring in a stretcher. Get Tony out. You dirty screws! You croaked my pal. I'll get you for this. Shut up, or you'll spend 30 days more in the hole. Morg... I was only kidding... just kidding, that's all. Son of a... -He's just a weak-kneed guy. -He ain't got no backbone. But me, I'm on my feet. -Shut up! -Take Morgan to the hospital. Come on. Let's go. Slight congestion. -Doctor? -Yes? -Carter has just passed away. -Carter? Oh, yes. Put him in the morgue. Have the wagon take him away tonight. Yes, sir. -Will he be all right, doctor? -Oh, yes. Yes, I think so. Number's 44789. Watch the Canadian border. Watch the best hotels. That's his racket. That's the first break we've had here in five years. -We'll get him, though. -How did he make his getaway? -Went out in the dead wagons. -Well done. I beg your pardon. Good evening. Good evening. If you'll just look around, I'll be with you in a minute. Thanks. I'm in no hurry. -Here's your book, Mr. Garrett. -How much is that? -Thank you. Good night. -Good night. Have you found what you wanted? No, I haven't. -Well, just what were you looking for? -A book on the Pacific Islands. A romance? No, no. Something that would give me an idea of the life there. Oh. I'm quite sure I have something in a new shipment that came today. I'll go and get it if you don't mind waiting a few minutes. Not a bit, no. May I help? Why, yes. Thank you. I was just going to look in these boxes. I think the picture... the, uh, travel books are in the bottom one. Here, let's have a look. Here. let me help. Well, thank you. You don't mind, do you? Why, no. Of course not. It's lovely of you to go to all this... all this trouble. Not at all. I'm glad to help. -You know, it's a fun-- -Stay where you are! I thought I recognized you, Mr. Morgan. I saw you in the visitors' room at the prison. Yes, I remember you, too. Hello... hello. Give me... give me Police Headquarters. Yes, please. Never mind. Well, why didn't you go through with it? Because... Well, because I just couldn't send you back there, that's all. You may go now, Mr. Morgan. I'll take that gun. Thanks. Oh, good evening. Hello, Miss Marlowe. Oh, excuse me. I didn't know you had company. Oh, that's quite all right. My friend, Mr. Everett, Sergeant Donlin. -Glad to meet you, Mr. Everett. -Same here, Sergeant. Face is kind of familiar. -Haven't I met you somewhere? -No, I don't think so, Sergeant. -No? -No. No. Well, maybe not. Mr. Everett is one of my best customers. Is that so? I thought it was past your closing time till I saw the lights. Well, it is, but we were unpacking some books. Oh, I see. Mrs. Donlin like the book I sent her? Huh? Yes. Well, I have another one that I'm sure she'll be crazy about. Fine. I'll get it for you. It's In the next room. Don't bother. She'll drive in tomorrow. Oh, what's that? The boys are after someone, I guess. Well, I'll be running along. -I'm glad to have met you, Mr... -Everett. -Good night, Mr. Everett. -Good night, Sergeant. -Good night, Miss Marlowe. -Good night. Thanks. Why did you come here? To square a bad deal I got from someone in prison. What do you mean? Well, I was framed. They took my parole away from me the day before I was to go free. Do you know who framed you? Yeah. Yeah, I think I know. Well, good night, Miss Marlowe. I won't bother you again. -Are you going away? -Perhaps. I don't know. I think I understand your bitterness. If you're ever around here again... drop in. -Oh, you don't mean that. -Of course I do. Gee, you're a peach of a girl. I picked him up one night and trailed him to a bookstore. -He goes under the name of Everett. -Everett? Who is she? Is she blond? He's Morgan, all right, all right. Plenty smart, too. I lost track of him for a couple of weeks. When I found him, he was actually working. I sent out a man to spot him. That night he quit his job. Working? Must be a woman in the case. Yeah. I know the woman, too. Then you got a line on him. Sure. I haven't lost one yet, have I? All right, Eddie. Let's go. Hello, Dick, how are you? Glad to see you. Where's your sister? She's in the backyard. -Hello, Anne. -Hello, darling. -How are you? -Fine. Good afternoon, everyone. How are you, Mr. Marlowe? Oh, fit as a fiddle. Younger than ever. Me, too. -Mrs. Marlowe, how are you today? -I'm fine, thank you. Anne tells me you're going away, Mr. Everett. -We're going to miss you. -That's awfully nice of you. You know, coming here has meant a great deal to me. Oh, you must stay for dinner. We're going to have corn bread and fried chicken. -And strawberry shortcake. -Better stop. I'm liable to miss that train. - Oh, you're not going that soon. -Yes. Leaving in an hour. -Oh, that's too bad. -Oh... I know somebody that's going to miss you. Why, dad! Don't ""why, dad"" me. I wasn't born yesterday. No. Me, neither. She's been sighing around all morning. I wondered what was the matter. Now, Dad, I'm ashamed of you. Come on, John. Don't listen to him. -You're so subtle, Dad. -Yeah, I can't help It. I... Oh, now, don't pick on me, Ma. You love it! Oh, I'm glad to see Anne happy again. Well, Anne, I hate to go. Oh, you'll come back someday. I don't think so. The minute that dick walked into that place where I was working I knew there was no chance for me to continue on here. Wouldn't it be better if you went back to prison and served out your time? No. They'd give me seven more years of it. I've got a pretty good grip on myself, Anne, and I'd like to make a new start. And my only hope is in some other country where they can't get me. Well, I suppose you're right. But I... we'll miss you. Will you really? You know I will. Anne, I have no right to tell you this, but... you know, I get sort of a choky feeling... every time I think I'm never going to see you again. Oh, don't be angry at me for saying that, will you? I'm not angry. You see, It's the only way I have of telling you how much your friendship has done for me. Thanks. What are you going to do? -Work. Does that please you? -Hm-Hmm. You know, as soon as I get to the islands... I'm going to get a little plantation. I've heard of a chap who made a fortune out there. Oh, that sounds marvelous. Doesn't it? You know, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't mind going. And yet, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be going. Gosh, how are you going to figure that one out? I don't know. Hello, Morgan. Let's see what you've got on you. I guess you didn't know who this fellow really was, Miss Marlowe. That's too bad. Sergeant, please. Wait a minute. I'm sorry this had to happen here, Anne. But I... Now let's get going. Oh, mother! I love him! Oh, if they'd only give him another chance! You're going to find things tougher than ever here. The state has closed the mill. You know what idleness does to a man. So you'd better watch your step. Yes, sir. All right, Morgan. Let's go. Yes, sir. We're gonna have a lot more trouble with that bird, you'll see. I think you're wrong, Wallace. I believe he wants to go straight. Straight? Two weeks with the old gang and he'll be right back where he was. Maybe. I hope not. Hello, Morg. Get back over that deadline or I'll knock your block off. -Who, me? -Yes, you. Pop's getting tough. How's all the dames outside? See my initials carved on many bedposts, Morg? -How have you been, Butch, huh? -Oh, okay. You know, the food's getting worse here, too. Hello, Morg. How are you? Well, what's the gang been up to, Butch? Planning. Six of us is going right out through that gate. You aren't kidding me, are you? No, I'm giving it to you straight. -Me and the gopher framed it. -The gopher? Why, he's been the prison gardener for seven years. Sure. He's had an idea in the back of his bean, though. There he goes now. For three months, every day he's been going to that gate. The screw's used to it, don't pay no attention to him. Yeah? Every once in a while, why, he has an extra big bunch of flowers, and the screw opens the gate, savvy? I see. And you six guys go through, is that it? -Sure. Simple, ain't it? -Sure. What happens when you get through the inner gate? We crash that outer gate and there's a car waiting. -When does it come off? -Thanksgiving Day at noon. Most of the screws go home to turkey dinner. We'll give them a bellyful. You know it means the rope, Butch, if they catch you. Who's in on it? Well, me, and Olsen, and Joe. and The Hawk. -The Hawk? That means blood. -No... he promised me he wouldn't bump nobody off. -Why, he croaked his own mother. -Sure he did. He cut her throat. He was sorry for her. He's all right. Anybody else in on it? Well, there's that big Swede and Kent... Kent? Say, listen, you're all wrong about that Kent guy. It was a Russian that planted that knife on you, not Kent. We caught him doing the same thing to another guy. Yeah? Sure. I was sure it was Kent. No. After you made your getaway, they put the gopher in the same cell with me and Kent, see? Kent ain't in on the plans, but he's got to go out with us. We ain't tellin' nobody till we get ready to make the break, outside of you. Not for me, Butch. I'm going straight. You wouldn't kid an old friend, would you? - You got me all wrong, Butch... -Hello, Morgan! But I just don't play a sucker's game, that's all. -How are you? -Hey, listen... don't let that gang know that you're going straight. They used to have a lot of respect for you. Hello, Morg. Welcome b-b-back home. Hello, Morg. Hey, listen, don't gang up here. Come on. Take a powder, take a powder. See you later, Butch. Hey, you. Come here, you. Let's see that book. Where's that Bride's Confession I told you to get me? -Well... well, you see, it's wor-worn out. -Well, you get me Sappho. Say, you don't mind if I take a powder, do you, Mr. B-B-B-Butch? Oh, go on, scram. Scram. Hey, Kent. I want to talk to you. Morgan, I want to explain to you about that knife... Yeah, Butch told me all about it. What you've done doesn't interest me. It's what you're going to do. Are you in on this break? -Yeah, they took me in on it. -I know. It's dynamite. They haven't told me all their plans yet. You keep out of it, do you hear? Not that I care about you. But I met that family of yours, Kent. They think the world of you. Now, you've caused them enough trouble, and if anything more happens to you, they'd never get over it. So you keep out of this break. It's murder, and you'll hang for it. Hey, you. Morgan trying to turn you against the gang? Yeah, that's what he was doing, all right. You wouldn't think it of him, would you? Aw, he's a rat. I wonder what Butch will say. Think I'd better go and tell him. All right. You tell him. This guy could catch fish with his hands. He'd reach under the rocks and get a hold of the fish... Hey, Butch, you take Morgan in? Morg? Sure. -You sure he's going with us? -Sure, he is. He can't wait. -Don't lie to me. -Who, me? -Why, I never told a lie in my life. -You know he's not going with us. I just heard him telling Kent to keep out of it. -Yeah? -Yeah. Said it looked like a trap to him. Get me? You suppose Morgan will go yellow? -Who, Morg? -Well, something's changed him. Yeah, something's changed him. You don't suppose he'd rat on us? -What's that you said? -You don't think he'd squeal? Say, listen, he wouldn't squeal on nobody. He's changed. That's all right. But I'll croak the first guy that says he's a double-crosser. So Kent's got his ear to the ground, and he'll soon have plenty to tell us. He thinks the gang have guns, but he doesn't know where they're hidden. I promised him we'd cut his time in half if he brought us this information. Stool pigeons. I wish we could run this place without them. -Yeah, well, we can't. -Who's in on it? All of Butch's gang. How about giving them solitary? That would only keep them quiet for a few weeks. It isn't any one group. It's 3,000 idle men with nothing to do but brood and plot. You can't put them all in solitary. We can crush them. That's what's happening to them right now. We've tried to crush them, with this result. You search every corner of this prison, but you find those guns. Don't worry, sir. If those guns are here, I'll have them on your desk before Thanksgiving Day. And now to record our thankfulness on this glad Thanksgiving Day, let us rise and sing hymn number 84. Ring the bells of heaven. There is joy today. A lost lamb is returning From his sinful way. Glory, glory. How the angels sing. Glory, glory. Loud hosannas ring... with songs of thanksgiving... Let our voices ring. Today's the day. Hear the angels sing. Open the gates, Open the gates Open the gates and let the king of glory in. Open the gates, open the gates, open the gates and let the King of Glory in. And now let us kneel in prayer. Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. The Lord bless you and keep you, both now and forevermore. Amen. Noon. Noon, Swede. Noon. Come on, scram. -Butch, what's the dope? -Noon. Watch me. Don't go through with it, Butch. It's a trap. They'll get you. We'll get through, if someone don't double-cross us. They'll mow you down. Wallace. - Morgan? -Yes, sir? I want to see you in my office. Yes, sir. Who's in on this break? I don't know anything about a break. Morgan, you're a liar. They've got guns hidden somewhere. You know where they are. If I did, I wouldn't tell you. What kind of a rat do you think I am? Not even if we opened the gates for you? Is that all you've got to say to me? I'll have plenty to say to you later. Hold him here. I can't get anything out of Morgan, sir. Don't worry. I've got the dope from Kent. -The break is set for noon. -Noon? Just one minute. What are they going to do? Kent couldn't tell me. I've doubled the gun guards. Don't you worry. Where is he? Why doesn't he come? There he is. Frost is beginning to kill the flowers, so I picked a whole lot today. -Make a big bunch, don't they? -Fine. Thank you. Grab all those guns. Get those screws and take them to the cellar. Joe! Joe! -What do you want, Butch? -We've been double-crossed! Yes! Morgan done it. Morgan! I'll get that guy if it's the last thing I do. Joe! Get those screws, put them in the hole. We'll need them later. Come on, you guys. Come on. Get in there! Any of you guys not with us, come on, clear out of here! Come on, get out of here. They're making it hot for us. We'll fix them. Go and get Sandy! Come here, Sandy. Come out of there. Come on. Get over there. Over there. Come on. You go to the warden. Tell him to open those gates and let us go through. If he don't, we're going to bump off every screw in here and throw them out in the yard. -Beginning with Wallace? -Yes, beginning with Wallace, yes. Here, take that gun. Hang that out that gate. All right. Open it just a little bit. That much? All right. Come on. Put it through there. All right. Come on. Come out. Get to moving, you. Go on, Wallace, get out there. Butch said if you didn't open the gate and let the gang out, they're going to kill all the guards beginning with Wallace. I'll see him in hell first. Let them have it. Come on out of there, Wallace. Come on! Shake it up! Wallace, you said your prayers? I don't know any prayers. Go ahead, shoot. Aah! Wallace! Miller! Miller! Give them the gas bomb. Open those gates and let us go through, or we'll send the rest of these screws straight to hell! You dirty double-crosser! They'll get you for this! Shut up! Butch! Joe!  Get me another screw out of there! What's the matter, kid? Morgan locked the door. He's got the key! Butch! Butch, come here. Morgan's got the key. He's locked the door. They'll kill me. They'll kill me! I didn't mean to squeal! I didn't mean to... They made me do it! They made me! Don't tell Butch. He'll kill me! So you double-crossed the gang, huh? -You turned them in! -Don't let them get me, Morgan! Don't let them get me! I guess you're not to blame at that. You stay where you are. I'll attend to this gang. Don't tell, don't tell  Butch. I didn't mean to do it! The army tanks are here, sir. All right. Send them in. What's that? We'll get the rope for this, but I'm going to get that rat Morgan if it's the last thing I do. Where's Morgan? Morgan, you in there? Come out of there, you rat! Come out of there, you rats! Is Morgan there? -No! -All right. Is Morgan in there? I know what you're coming for, Butch. But I'm not going to be killed for something I didn't do. If you come one step nearer... He shot me in the arm, Butch! I warned you, Joe! I didn't double-cross the gang. You stick your head out of that door, and I'll throw a slug between your horns. -Stand back, Pop! -Shut up! I'll tell him. Butch, this Is Pop Riker. You're all wrong, Butch. Morgan didn't turn you in. Even the screws are protecting him. Come on. Let's go in and get him. Wait, Butch. My eyes! I must be losing my sight. I'm going blind! You're all right. It's only the gas. Morgan, we're coming after you, you snake. I warn you, Butch. Stay where you are! Stay where you are! Joe! Joe! Bring me some more bullets, Joe. Oh! Sorry, Butch. Did I get you? -I'm on my feet, see? -Don't lie to me. -Who, me? -Yes, you. Listen, Butch, it was Kent who sold out the gang, not Morgan. Kent? You know I wouldn't double-cross you, Butch. Sure, I know you wouldn't. I was only kidding, that's all. Just kidding. Just... Sure. I knew that all the time. I want to thank you, Warden, for all you've done. All ready for a new start, Morgan? Yes, sir, I am. Have you made any plans for your future? Yes, sir. I thought I'd go to the islands of some new country - and take up government lands. -Good idea. New friends, new surroundings, hard work. That's a man's salvation. Are you going alone? Well, I don't know, sir. Well, I wish you luck. You deserve it. Thank you, Warden. -Well, so long, Pop. -So long, Morgan. See that you don't get homesick again.

Michael Robert Gilhooley, plaintiff, versus Edna Mae Gilhooley, defendant. That's you, Harrigan. That's us. - Just leave everything to me. - Yeah. Order in the court. Quiet down. Michael Robert Gilhooley brings suit for divorce against and asks damages from Edna Mae Gilhooley, his wife of five years. - Go ahead, Harrigan. - Thank you, Your Honor. It should please the court to know, that my learned colleague, Mr. Morgan, has informed me that his client, Mrs. Gilhooley, has finally responded to subpoena and is at this very moment waiting in the waiting room. - Well, why don't you call her, Harrigan? - Yes, I will. So as not to waste the court's time, Your Honor, I would like at this juncture to call Edna Mae Gilhooley, who has inflicted such cruel and inhuman punishment upon my client and lay bare all the sordid facts. Cruel and inhuman? - Any objections, Morgan? - None whatsoever, Your Honor. Call Mrs. Gilhooley. Mrs. Gilhooley. Do you, Edna Mae Gilhooley, solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Get going, Harrigan. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, Your Honor. - Mrs. Gilhooley. - Yes, sir? Your Honor. I have not as yet discussed this with my client, but I'm going to recommend to him that he drop his charges and throw himself on the mercy of the court. That, Mr. Harrigan, is a wise, if not very lucrative, decision. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Hey! You forgot your hat. The bailiff will now attempt to assist Mr. Harrigan as he runs from the courtroom. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Case dismissed. - Hey, Leo, what are you doing? - Practicing law. Hey, little rat! - Hey! I'm gonna get you this time. - I'm sorry. Dirty son of a... We'll murder you in court, Cobb. Come around here again and I might lose my temper. Did you say court? As it happens, I'm a... - Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah, well at least they didn't get the camera. How? What I want to know is how. - A spy! - A spy! - Seize that man. - Seize that man! No, I'm not. I was just looking... - Please, you're making a terrible mistake. - Lousy, maggoty Patents Company spies. You bastards ain't going to force H.H. Cobb out of pictures. Saw what happened to your hired thugs, didn't you? I'm a lawyer. I have a card. - Where are my writers? - Writers! - Tell him how tough I am! - You're making a terrible mistake. - What's the matter, Mr. Cobb? - Tell him. - Tell him what? - How tough he is. - Please, I can explain. - I hear a trolley. Steve. - Steve! - H.H. Cobb's so tough he eats nails. - And spits battleships. - Quiet! Why, you're not from the Patents Company. - No, sir. - You don't look dangerous enough. I'm a lawyer, sir. We're heading into the bush country, men. - Get my snake-bite puttees. - Puttees! L. Taylor Harrigan, sir, attorney at law. Get it figured out, boys. Come on, I'm falling asleep. - My card. - Here, Chief. We just can't get past the jail scene, Mr. Cobb. Well, get past it. Tell me how she loses her teeth. Does she have to? - That's what I have to know. - Lose her teeth? Of course, she has to lose her teeth. If she doesn't lose her teeth, the story has no bite. Teeth, bite. That's pretty good. Write that down, somebody. - Got it. - Wanna get in pictures, I suppose? Me? No, sir. I'm a lawyer. I couldn't help noticing that little altercation you had back there. Well, the first thing that came into my head is, ""There's a man in need of counsel."" - First thing, eh? - Yes, sir. Now, what about those pictures you were talking about? Pictures? Moving pictures. Galloping tintypes, Muldoon. Haven't you ever been to a nickelodeon? - Harrigan. - Nickelodeon. Ah, yes. And this Patents Company? It's not one company, Horace. It's all these big motion picture companies, ganged up together against us little ones. Ah, yes. Claim that they've got a patent on all the cameras. The truth is, they don't want us blanket companies making pictures. - The trolley's waiting, Mr. Cobb. - Blanket companies? - Independents, Clancy. Pay attention. - Harrigan, sir. - What? - Harrigan, sir. H-A double R-I-G-A-N. Like the man in the song. What song? By George M. Cohan, sir. It's a big hit. We don't need singers, O'Halloran, this is war. - We don't need singers. - Come on, we're going after him. - Hold this a second, will you, kid? - Yeah. Say, where are you people going? How's this? The old lady faints dead away when she sees her nephew? - He shouldn't be her nephew. - Mr. Cobb... - What should he be then? - Mr. Cobb, it sounds to me... - Why do you ask me? - ...as if a trust has been formed. - You're darn right, it's a trust. - Involving these patents. - He could be an Indian. - No Indians. - You just said the guy was Indian. - You just said he was! I'm prepared to take the position that this Patents Company is an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade. I've had three lawyers, son, and they all told me the same thing. But I like the way you announce it. Hold everything! I think the Wild Man's got something. - He's turning blue again. - I beg your pardon? Come on, Waldo, spit it out. He's on a... - Yes, yes. Get this down, quick! - I'm getting it, sir. ...ledge, 20 stories up, with... Come on, Waldo, you're doing great. ...his pajamas on, and... Just a little more, Waldo. Squeeze it out. And a live crab in his pants! He's done it again. God, why can't I get writers to think like that? - I wouldn't know. - What's he doing on the ledge? - Don't nitpick! - And who is he? - Nitpick! - Yeah. Who is he? Drama! What we've got is laughs and drama, an irresistible combination. Thank you, Waldo. Take a rest. - I don't like the crab. - He doesn't like the crab. - Well... - That crab is pure genius. All we gotta do is figure out how it got there. - And who he is. - Yeah, who is he, H.H.? That's for you to tell me. Come on, for heaven's sake. This is embarrassing. He could be a ranger. What did you say? - Oh, nothing. - Yes, you did. You said ranger. - I'm sorry. - That's it! - Is it? - What is he to the girl? He could be the girl's cousin. - She's his cousin? - He's her cousin. - Better yet. - Isn't that the same thing? Don't interrupt. The man is inspired. Go on, McDougall. Don't stop now. You're hot. - They're in love, of course. - Of course. - Madly. - Madly. I like it! Keep it coming, kid. What's he do about it? What does he do about it? He... He kidnaps her. And the old lady can't stand the thought! He's a forest ranger. That's how he gets the crab in his pants in a river. Forget the crab a minute. Then what happens? - Then what happens? - This is it, last stop. That's us, Mullins. Now, write it all down, figure out the finish, - and I'll pay you ten for it. All right, $15. Start writing, don't delay. Now, make it juicy, print legibly! Go on, get going. What are you waiting for? You're working for Kinegraph. Make it seven or eight scenes. Two for the beginning, three in the middle, two for the finish. Three if it's a real lollapalooza. - Three if it's a real... $15 cash? - On the barrelhead! Last stop. Everybody out! - Mr. Cobb, where... - Drop it by the office. But... Oh. Oh, dear. - I beg your pardon. - Oh, that's all right. I beg your pardon. Two for the beginning, three for the middle... Excuse me. - Say, are you all right? - Three if it's a real... - What? - Lollapalooza. - Hello. - Hello. - You fell down. - I do all the time. I'm blind as a rat. - Why didn't I help you? - You were talking to yourself. All aboard. - Do you live here in Chicago? - Not anymore. I'm going to New York City. When? - Now. - Now? Wait! - What's your name? - Kathleen Cooke. What's yours? - Leo Harrigan. H-A double R-I... - Like the man in the song. Yeah. Beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. - I beg your pardon. - Sorry. - No, I beg your... - No, it's my... ...pardon. ...fault. Are you with the Chautauqua? I'm looking for the Chautauqua. No, ma'am. I'm just off the train from Sopchoppy. - China? - No, ma'am. Florida. Everybody thinks that though. Can I help you up? Aren't you kind. Who's that Indian fellow you're looking for? - Indian fellow? - Chickawa? - Chautauqua. - Yeah. It's a theatrical tour and we're all leaving on the train tonight. Oh, that's too bad. Let me help you find him. You're very considerate. I hope I'm not taking you out of your way. Not at all, ma'am. I couldn't find my glasses, so I'm late. It's my first real job in the show business. Do you ride in the circus? - Why would you say that? - Your suit. Oh, no, ma'am. I don't ride at all. I hate horses. - But you are in show business, aren't you? - Oh, yes, ma'am. I used to run all the alligator fights down in Sopchoppy. - You fought alligators? - Holy sailor, no, not me. I used to introduce the alligators to the Indians, then get out of the way. I come up north here to make my fortune in the clothing business. Cooke! Kathleen Cooke! Come on, you're late! There they are. Well, thank you, Mr... Tom Greenway, but everybody down in Sopchoppy calls me Buck. - Okay, Buck, what do you want? - Goodbye, Mr. Greenway. So long, Miss Cooke. Hold on a second. Look, I'm trying to locate a fellow who lives here that goes by the name of Mr. Hoot de Longpre. - No, he doesn't. - Ain't this the Hotel Rialto? No, it's the Rialto, and Mr. de Longpre left last week for the rodeo. But, see, this fellow down in Yeehaw Junction gave me $20 to deliver this here saddle to Mr. Hoot de Longpre at the Hotel Rialto. Now, what the heck am I going to do now? - Oh, Mr. Greenway, good luck. Break an arm. - She means break a leg. - Why I got to break anything? - Obviously not in show business. - Cowboy, you working? - What? - You working, cowboy? - You Mr. Hoot de Longpre? No, I'm with the Clansman Company over at the New Amsterdam Theatre. - Hey, can you ride a horse? - Why? 'Cause we got a show on right now and our only horseman got drunk last night and broke his leg. Can you ride or not? - How much does it pay? $10? In advance? - Okay. You better know how to ride a horse. - Mister, that's my middle name. - What on earth are you going to do, sir? - Find the fiend who did this crime. - But there's no trace of him there. - We shall see. I believe a glass of sufficient power will reveal on the retina of those dead eyes the image of the killer as though etched in fire! - You mean... - Yes! Impressions remain on the brain like words written on paper with invisible ink! The fire-etched record... - Mr. Dinsdale, Louie found a rider. - Don't shout. Be quiet. What? Speak up. - Louie found a rider. - Where? Bring him in. - He's coming. - Can we make it? - There he is. - Barely. - Get ready for the ride. - Ready to ride. - Double time. - And double it. - Howdy, fellows. - What are you, in the circus? Ever ride in a show before? Put me on the animal and point me the right way. 50 seconds, Mr. D. - 50 seconds. - Hey, this must be my costume, huh? If you fall off or get hurt, Circus, don't expect no extra pay. And if you get killed, we don't supply the funeral. - Get him on! - That's mighty encouraging, sir. - Climb on, hurry up. - Yes, sir. Here I go. Howdy, old stinker. - Cyclone. - Cyclone? - Hey, mister, other side! - The other side? - Oh, left-handed horse, huh? - Where did you find this dude? Hurry up, boys, get him on. - Riding's his middle name, sir. - What I got to do? - Just stay on that treadmill. - Wait a second. - The horse knows what to do. - Hold it a second. What treadmill? - On the stage. - How do I see out of this contraption? - Cross. Cross. - Cross. Cross. - Cross? - Through the eye-hole, stupid. - Hold on a second. - Wave it around! - Hold on a second! - Horse! How do you get off this thing? Stop, horsey. Blizzard, stop. Hurricane. Rain. For you. Howdy, ma'am. A fellow gave me this here card last night. And a person wrote on the back of it that I... I could come over to this here bakery and earn some money, if I was to ask for a German bagel. We're going in the back and have a bagel. In. In. In. In. You are here what? Your name is why? My name is Buck Greenway, sir. And a fellow gave me this here card. - What you all doing here, anyway? - Bread-baking. Look, I'll just be on my way. No hard feelings. - Hold it! - Don't move! You will ride for us. $10. Let me get this straight. You all want me to deliver your bread on a horse for $10? - No, no, horse in pictures. - Pitchers? - Yeah. - Pitchers of what? Milk? - Milk? - Milk pitchers. No, no. Movie pictures. Bang! Bang! You don't understand English? - You want me to ride a horse? - Yes. Well, okay, that's my middle name. No, I ain't feared of nothing. And I can shoot real good, too. Hey, you all are German, ain't you? Why you wearing that suit, stupid Mr. Horse? Well, these are just my dress clothes. I got my working clothes over here. I'll show 'em to you. Yeah. These ain't my clothes. Out of the way. Hit it again. Out of the way. Now get in there. Miss Cooke. - Let's go. Come on. - Find the damn cameras! Smash these tanks. Come on, tear the place apart, here. Smash these tanks. - You Patents Company bastards! - Get out of the way! Now, those are my clothes. Hey, wait a minute! That saddle don't belong to me. Come on, tear the place apart, here. Smash these tanks. - Check that closet out there. - I think I found it. The man killed a box. I'm gonna get out of here. - What was that? - Good job, sport. That takes care of everything. The place is wrecked. Let's go. Mike, help this man with his things. Come on boys, wake up. Fellow, you're swell. - Let's go before things get out of hand. - You the law? We're the Patents Company, fellow. - This your saddle? - This your suitcase? - Is that your hat? - Yeah. No. Yeah. These are my clothes. Come on, we might got a place in our organization for a big guy like you. - You like to travel? Can you shoot? - That's my middle name. Stop, this is terrible. My mother could do better. - I've got another one. - Bring her in then. You're just used to it. The hell I am. What's it look like to you, Harrigan? - What? I wasn't watching. - Ah, you see? It smells. I tell you what you do, Herbert. Take the first sequence, put it where the second one is, and take the third sequence, put it where the first one was. But that won't make any sense. No, but it'll get a laugh. And that makes sense. Dollars and cents. Call it The Tell-Tale Knife, kid, better title. - Lights! Go on. - Whatever you say. Don't sulk, Herbert. It's not manly. Everybody's temperamental. Watch out what you say about my mother! Now, give me drama with pathos. Give me a story with heart-throbs. Shatter the nerves. I said pastrami, not spaghetti! Albert, H.H. - H.H. How are you, Boss? - Make it snappy. I'm writing a scenario. Feed Waldo and give me a ginger beer. - How'd you hear? - Telegram. - Telegram? Who sent it? - Oh, that's Chauncey Wheelock. - Wheelock. - Yeah, the director, Wheelock. I knew I never should have sent that Irish son of a bitch out there. - No offense, kid. - What do you want me to do about it, Boss? Oh, let me chew on this. I'll get back to you. He's turning blue, Mr. Cobb. Not now, Waldo, I can't do two things at once. - I'm choking. - Not now! I sent those idiots out to California so they could capture on moving picture film scenes of historical association and natural loveliness, so they'd be free of these goddamn Patents Company hooligans that I have to put up with every day. And what happens? - What happens? - What happens? I'm telling you, for Pete's sake. Keep your shirt on. What happens is that for three weeks we have received no film from California, not one foot. - I have made a decision. - You hate the story. - You! - You hate me. How would you like to make 30 a week, plus expenses? - Thirty dollars? - All right, 35. Not a penny more! Mr. Cobb, I'm a little... I should've known better than to trust a man who calls himself Chauncey Wheelock. Claims he's a playwright and a director. Claims he's another Griffith. He's another Griffith, all right. Max Griffith, the butcher down the block. - Who's Griffith? - What? - I was just wondering... - Who is Griffith? You mean to say that you don't know who David Wark Griffith is? - D.W. Griffith? - Well, I think I've heard the name. You think you've heard? Why, he's only the greatest film director in the world. God damn him. Man, D.W. Griffith is the best thing that's happened to pictures since the invention of the camera. - And this fellow Wheelock? - Is the worst! I sent him out to California to take advantage of the sunshine, to run my West Coast company. Now I get a telegram which says, ""I've lost stories. Send more."" Lost stories? Where? In the toilet? - Harrigan, stand up! - Yes, sir. Harrigan, I want you to take the train to California. - Me, sir? - Take five of your best stories. - Have you got five? - Five? - Well, I think maybe I... - Take 10! Take them out there and if you see anything fishy, if you smell a rat, if it ain't kosher, I want you to consider yourself fully empowered. But get that camera turning. Remember, it's war. Give them hell, boy. - I'll do my best. - God be with you. Last call for dinner. Last call for dinner. What's all that? We're pulling into Kansas City, Mr. Harrigan, and it's the last call to dinner. - Oh, thank you. - Don't mention it. Last call for dinner. Okay, let's see. Okay, let's go, Reese. We'll be here all day if we wait for her. - Okay, okay, okay. Come on, Kathy, let's go. - I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh, heavens! - My goodness! - Miss Cooke! - Mr. Mulligan. - Harrigan. Oh, goodness, there they are. Okay, I'm coming, Mr. Duncan. - Goodbye, I have to go now. - Goodbye? No, wait. - I can't. Where are you going? - California. - We're going to California. - You are? When? Oh, I don't know exactly. It's so confusing. They said whistle-stop tour and they weren't fooling. Is there any place I could write you, Kathleen? - Oh, you remembered my whole name. - Allow me. And I called you Mulligan. I can't get anything right. - You can call me anything you want. - Then, goodbye, Mulligan. Come on, Miss Cooke, come on, Miss Cooke. No fraternizing, fellow. - But... What? - All aboard, Mr. Harrigan. Come on, the train's leaving. - Goodbye. - See you soon. - I hope so. - So do I. - Good luck. - You mean, break an arm. What? All out, Kansas City. Kansas City, all out. ""The Virginian's pistol came out, and his hand lay on the table. ""He issued his orders to the man Trampas. ""'When you call me that, smile.' ""And he looked at Trampas across the table."" Front of the car! Front of the car! Put your bonnet on, put your bonnet on. Advertise, advertise! Will you get to the front of the car, Miss Cooke? Miss Cooke! I got you. - Oh, Mr. Greenway. - Howdy. - I tripped. - I'm glad. Front of the car, girls. Front of the car. Come on, Miss Cooke. - I'm coming, Mr. Duncan. - No fraternizing, fellow. Oh, porter, wait. I have your suitcase, Mr. Greenway. And I got yours, Miss Cooke. I don't know how it happened. Probably my fault. I'm blind as a rat, you know. And all sorts of people standing around when I first opened it. - It was very embarrassing. - Yeah, I can imagine. - I hope you're not going to shoot me. - No, no. It's just a new job I got. Shooting? No. Sort of law enforcement, I guess you could call it. - I was hoping I'd run into you. - So was I. Oh, dear. I have it. - Sorry. - That's all right. Thanks to you, I finally get a chance to change my clothes, now. These are about to walk away on me. Whoops. - Those aren't your clothes? - Nope. - Well, whose clothes are they? - Can't say. - Somebody doesn't have their clothes. - Yes, ma'am. Me. Mulligan. - My name's Greenway, ma'am. - Yes, I know. - Miss Cooke! - Mr. Duncan. Would you like to have some supper, ma'am? - Oh, gee, I'd love to. Except we... - Miss Cooke, go to your room. Yes, sir, Mr. Duncan. Yes, sir. Stay away from my girls, dude. - You all right, miss? - I'm fine. - You in the circus or what? - No, I ain't. - Sir, where are we? - I just announced it, Mr. Harrigan. Cucamonga. - Right on time. - What? But the porter was supposed to wake me. Why didn't he wake me? Well, sir, he's only human. You'd better hurry up. The train's right on time. These aren't my clothes. Cucamonga. I'm not ready. If I had my own suitcase. I should... Go away. Stop it. - Did you see that dog? - What dog was that, Mr. Harrigan? - Oh, look at that. - What? - Your jacket's ripped, Mr. Harrigan. - Thank you very much. Oh, don't mention it, Mr. Harrigan. Goodbye now. All aboard. Hello, little girl. Pleased to meet you. I'm L. Taylor Harrigan, from Chicago, looking for one Chauncey Wheelock. Have you seen an ugly little dog running around here anywhere? Yes, as a matter of fact, it bit me. - Good. Where'd he go? - Off that way. - Your jacket's ripped. - Yes, I know. But could you just... ...three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Hello. Good morning. - Your jacket's ripped, mister. - Yes, I fell off the train. Yes, sir, that's what happened, all right. Say, I was wondering, would you by any chance know the whereabouts of a fellow named Chauncey Wheelock? He's a moving picture director. He's supposed to be around here somewhere. I need to find him. Why? - Did someone say something? - I said, why? Hello. I'm L. Taylor Harrigan, from Chicago. You're not, by any chance, Mr. Wheelock, are you? - Don't let him get away. - Wait, stop! Stop it! Stop it! He's laughing. Well! I never! - That was assault. - You a snake-oil salesman, mister? - Those are not my clothes. - How's that? I mean, those are my clothes. - You L. Taylor Harrigan? - Yes. He's okay, boys. Here's a card from old Corny Cobb. Well, what an interrogation! Sorry, Mr. Harrigan, but we're all a little touchy about those Patents guys. - Oh, you thought that I... - I'm Frank Frank. - What? - Frank Frank. You didn't look dangerous, but we can't take chances. No, of course. And this is the crew. Jimmy, John, Dobie, Jack. And Mr. Reginald Kingsley. - Charmed. - He's the actor. And Sally there, he owns the place. - What about Wheelock? - That drip. He went on a bender and we ain't heard or seen him for weeks. Four weeks. And we ain't been paid in that long, neither. Yeah, he took most of the last payroll with him. - Son of a bitch. - Well, that's just awful. - Then you've been stranded here. - Yeah, and it ain't exactly Paris, France. Right. Yes, of course. I better send a telegram. Where can I send a telegram? - Anywhere you want. - No, I mean where from? From where? Over to the depot, Mr. Harrigan. Oh, thank you very much. Call me Leo, won't you? I'm Margaret Reeves. Everybody calls me Marty. Very pleased to meet you, Marty. - Good to meet you, Leo. - Same here, Frank Frank. Well... - I believe this is yours. - Oh, yes. Thank you. Gentlemen, telegram. I would like to telegraph Chicago. It's an emergency. If it's an emergency, why don't you try that there new public telephone? See if it'll work. Ain't nobody called as far as Chicago yet. The telephone. Good idea. Get fast results. Hello, hello, hello. Central. I would like to call Chicago, Illinois. That's Kinegraph. K-I-N-E graph. Yes, and can you bill it to them there, please? - Right. - Can I have your name, please? My name is Harrigan. H-A double R-I... - Like the man in the song. - Yes, just like the man in the song. By George M. Cohan, yes. - I hear it, it's ringing. - Son of a bitch! - Kinegraph. - Mabel? This is Leo Harrigan. May I speak to Mr. Cobb, please? She's got the money. She's going to try and get him. He's in three meetings. - Sounds right. - Is that you, Harrigan? - Mr. Cobb? It's him. - Where are you? - Mr. Cobb, I'm in Cucamonga. - Is Wheelock there? No, Wheelock's not. He went on a bender. - He disappeared. - Disappeared? - He's yelling now. - Drunken Irish son of a... He took the last payroll with him. - Took the payroll! - He's yelling again. I'm going to have him decapitated. Well, I suggest that you send some money to these people, so that they can be paid and... And then, I think that... That you should disband the company. - No. - Disband the company? Out of work. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You will send money immediately. And you want me to take my stories. Yes, they're ready. And you want me to what? - Oh, no, Mr. Cobb, I don't think that's... - Don't argue with me! No, really. Yes, I know, but that's not... No. He's fading out. Don't fade. Hello, Mr. Cobb... Hello, hello, hello... He wants me to direct. Good morning, Sally. Good morning. Hello, little girl. I see you got your dog back. - Quiet, Leo. - I beg your pardon. I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Leo. The dog's name is Leo. Good morning, everyone. - Good morning. - Good morning. Well, it certainly is a beautiful morning. - Who's that? - That's the director. That's the director? - Frank Frank. - Yes, sir. - Could I speak to you for a minute, please? - Yes, sir. We'll be right back. What's the matter? Frank, to be quite frank, I don't know how to do it. - Do what? - Direct. - You don't? - No. Gee! Well, don't just say gee. I'm a nervous wreck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you always wear your clothes so big? These aren't my clothes. - Well, whose are they? - I don't know. You don't know how to direct... And I don't know whose clothes, that's right. Anything else? Hey. - Well, didn't you ever see Cobb direct? - No, I was writing. God, this is humiliating. Hey, look, take it easy. It's real simple. You'll have no problem. - I won't? - Hell, no. Any jerk can direct. Now, you see over there? - Marty and Kingsley? - Yeah. - Putting on their white makeup? - Yeah. - Those are the actors. - Thank you very much. Okay. Now, you see over there, that box on the sticks? - Yes. - John's putting a blanket over it right now? - Yes. - That's the camera. Well, the first thing you do is tell me where to put it. I'm about to. No. I'm the cameraman. - Oh, you are? - Yes, sir. - Well, hello. - Hello, sir. - Leo. - Frank. - No, I'm Leo. - Yes, I know. Go on. Okay. Then you tell the actors what you want them to do in front of the camera. You tell me to crank it. And when you've had enough, - you just tell me to cut. - Cut. Then you do the same thing all over again with the next scene and that's it. - That's it? - That's it. - That's all D.W. Griffith does? - Sure, more or less. They tell me Griffith doesn't say ""cut,"" he says ""cease."" - Griffith says ""cease."" Well, I can do that. - Then you can direct. Let's go. All right, let's go. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. All right... - Dobie, wasn't it? - Yes, sir. - Oh, you don't have to call me sir. - Oh, well, we always call the director sir, sir. Oh, you do. I'm sorry. The story we're doing today is called Luke's Revenge. Could you be Luke? Excuse me, Mr. Harrigan, I am Reginald Kingsley of the New York stage. I normally play the leading roles. I would be Luke. - Oh, yes, of course. - What happens to me? Well, in the first scene, Luke's horse throws him and he gets killed. Luke gets killed in the first scene? - That's right. - Then I do not play Luke. - Oh, well, perhaps he only gets hurt then. - I do not fall from horses. I see. Well... Does anyone have any ideas how we could kill Luke? - He could get shot. - Yeah, except it should be an accident. He could shoot himself. Well, that does not have quite the dramatic impact we're searching for. He could get bit by a rattlesnake. - Did you say something, little girl? - I said, he could get bit by a rattlesnake. A rattlesnake. Yes, that's a very good idea, little girl. Except, we haven't got a rattlesnake. - Now does anyone else have... - I've got a rattlesnake. - You've got a rattlesnake? - Yes. - A little toy rattlesnake or something? - A real rattlesnake. His name is Robert. Robert the rattlesnake? - Yes. It'll cost you $5. - Five dollars? For the day? For two hours. - All right, little girl. - Alice. All right, Alice, can we have a look, or is there a price for that too? You can look for free. She's got a rattlesnake. - Yeah. Ain't that something. - Son of a bitch. - Here he is. - Ah, that was fast, little girl. - Alice. - Alice. Let's have a look. It bit me. My God, you can die from the bite of a rattle... - I could die from this. - Holy smoke, he got bit by a rattlesnake. Little girl, your rattler bit that young man. Don't worry. Robert's poison sac's been removed for years. He can't hurt a fly. They do this to all the directors. - That's nice. - Yeah. - We got it, we got it! - Just drink this down, sir, quick. - What? What is it? - It's old Injun remedy. - Chipawau. - Chipa what? - Chipawau. - But... Just chug-a-lug it down, sir, so it can beat the poison to your heart. If it gets there first, it disinfects the heart and the poison can't get in. - Hurry. - Oh, mother of mercy. - Frank Frank! - Sir, sir! Aim the camera at Ronald. - Robert. - Robert. - Aiming. - Kingsley? Mr. Harrigan. - Stand next to it. - I do not play scenes with reptiles. - Well, what do you do? - I emote. Then never mind. - Just photograph Roger. - Robert. - Robert. - All set, Boss. - All right, Frank, crank. - Cranking. We're going to make pictures. I said, we're going to make pictures. Pictures with drama and heart-throb. Pictures with comedy and pathos. Pictures with thrills and romance! And if any Patents Company son of a... I said, if any Patents Company son of a... - Where is he? Where is he? - On the roof. There's the son of a bitch. - On the roof. - Give me a gun. Get him! Who is he? Don't kill him. - The camera okay? - Yeah, just barely. Don't kill him! Patents bastards. Patents? But don't kill him. Let me kill him. Goddamn Patents bastards didn't tell me they were going to shoot back! You're doing great, sir. Come on, boys, let's get him. - We're with you, Dobie. - Now, you stay here, Marty. - Staying? - Where's Leo? - I'm right here. - Not you. Don't let him get away. Hey, wait for me! Whoa, horsey. Whoa. Don't shoot. You might hit the horse! - Ain't no use in going after him now. - Nope, that's Hurricane. - He's a... - Goner. - Son of a bitch. - Hello? Where is everybody? - Stop this... - Look at him ride. Come on, now. Please. Get down off that horse immediately, young man. I want to have a word with you. Look out! He tried to kill me. Get, pluckies. Get! - Hey, you, wait a minute. - He's gonna need help. - Oh, hell. - Oh, come on. Come on, folks. I think there's gonna be a fight. - I got him. - I don't want to fight. We got him! - Now, hold still. - Oh, he's feisty! You're doing great. I don't like fighting women and children! - Quit wriggling. - You kicked me. You shot at my camera, you Patents Company son of a bitch. One thing I hate, it's a sloppy drunk. Well, that settles it. Hold these, please. Get up. Get up, you skunk. You got a lot of help, mister. Don't anybody help me! No matter what happens, don't anybody help me! That sounds like a bad idea, Leo. Not at all. I was boxing champion of my class at the University of Chicago. I am trained in fisticuffs. Get up, you coward. That's the way it's going to be! Put me down! This is not the Marquis of Queensbury rules. I knew it was a bad idea. - Come on. - I don't want to fight you. - Come on, you coward. Let's box. - I don't want to fight you. Look, I'm warning you, I got an alligator farm. - What? - I got an alligator... I warned you... - Say, he can... - Box. - Son of a bitch. - That Harrigan's a pretty good fighter. It's not over yet. You kicked me! You kicked me! - Hey, no kicking. - Yeah, no kicking. That's not fair. Did you see that? - Kicking is fair! - No biting. - I wasn't ready. - You ready now? Yes. Are we observing the Marquis of Queensbury rules? Sure. We are not observing the Marquis... That's it, Leo! Punch him! No kicking. Time out. Hold it. Hold it! Hit it, stranger! - Do you mind? - All right, all right. - Don't you trust me? - No, I don't. Marquis... Queens Marquis rules, you know. Go ahead. Has anybody got any water? I'm dying of thirst. Stop it! Let go! Hey, you're doing great, Boss. Leo, get away from there, will you? Leo, he's on our side. - Well, I guess you give up now, don't you? - I most certainly do not. - Get up. Come on, coward, get up. - Now I'm getting mad. Hey, he's dancing like Leo. Come on, stranger. Give me a hand, will you? Don't let them get away! You give... - No. - No. No. - You thirsty? - Very. Oh, good. Well, it looks like my place is the only thing left standing, so folks, follow me. The drinks are on the house. Never seen a fight like that before. Here you are, Boss. You're doing great. Just great. I believe those are my pants you've got on. I'm a suck-egg mule if they ain't mine. - These? - Yeah. - You wear these? - Purty, ain't they? How in the world did... Wait a second. Did you meet a girl? - Blind as a rat? - Tells you to break your arm. - Falls down a lot. - Kathleen. Cooke. - My God. - Glory be. - I got to hand it to you, Dan. - Leo. You got a mean left for a Northern boy. - And you, too. - Thanks. - And you know what? - What? I like your looks. You ain't funny, are you? No. Did you ever think about getting in the picture business? Thought about getting out of it! - Oh, get out of that damn Patents Company. - It ain't worth it, Dan. - Listen, you sure can ride a horse. - Well, it's sort of my middle name. Well, why don't we have us a snort and see if we can work it out. Okay, if you can get me up out of here. I'll tell you what, Dan. Just tell me about when you met my girl. What do you mean your girl? When did you meet her? Springtime, New York City. Well, then I saw her first, Dan, back in Chicago. Long before she ever thought about going to New York City. - Is that a fact? - Nothing but a fact. - Why we used to go sailing on Lake Erie. - Well, I took her down to my alligator farm. Well, looks like we got ourselves a new leading man. - Yeah. - That big lug. Wait a minute, wait a minute! Miss Cooke, you're supposed to be a clod dancer, not a clod hopper. - Well, I'm trying. - I thought it was nice. - What? - Didn't you, Jim? - Real nice. - Who the devil are you? We telephoned about your balloon for the moving picture company. - You Duncan? - Oh, yeah. Well, girls, girls, take a break, girls. Yes, the balloon'll cost you $50 for the day. - Give you 30. - I said 50, little girl. - Give you 25. - I said 50. - Give you 20. - You just said 25! - That's a deal. - What? - Is that your kid, fellow? - Hell, no. My name's Alice. What's yours? - Kathleen. - I like that name. - Well, I like yours. - I hate it. But why? It's a good name. Nah, it ain't, 'cause you can't make a nickname out of it. Except Al or something stupid like that. Everybody's just gotta call you Alice. Hey, kid! Kid! - That dog's got a mean streak. - Here's your money. - Do you belong to that mutt, kid? - Come on, Leo. Nice talking to you. Hey, Alice should live in a palace. Can't do that with my name. Hey, this is only 25 bucks. - That's what you said. So long, Kathleen. - Bye, Princess. - Princess? Where'd you get that? - Well, who do you think lives in palaces? Oh, yeah. Now you just hold on a minute, there, young lady. I don't care what you say, Dan, I ain't going to do it. Have I ever lied to you, Dan? - Yeah, you have, several times. - I have not. Luke's Revenge, Rattlesnakes and Gunpowder... I've only tried to make you comfortable in uncomfortable situations. - Don't try to sweet talk on me, Dan. - That is a director's job. I don't like being up off the ground. What are you when you're on a damn horse? Okay, fair enough. I'll go as high as my horse. Fine. How high's a horse, 10, 12 feet? - Six. A horse is six feet. - A short horse. Short or tall, that's as high as this explorer's going. Six feet. Do you want everybody to think you're scared? I am scared. Look, a horse is human. That thing is full of hot air, just like you. - All right. Dobie. - Don't go no higher than six feet. - Take it up to six feet and hold it. - It's as high as I'm going. - Six feet! - Marty, Marty! - Yes, Leo. - Oh. You run in when I yell. - Yes, Leo. - Well, go on, Dan. - Get in the damn thing. - I'm getting, I'm getting. - Did you see that? - Hold it steady, boys. - We don't want to lose the leading man. - I gotcha, don't worry. Everything all set, Alice? - Princess. - What? - Princess. - Alice should live in a palace. - Has everybody gone crazy today? - Not crazy enough to go up in that thing. - What'd he say? - I'm getting a lot of help today. Okay, let him up 30 feet. No, no, no, no! Miss Cooke! Please, take it from the top again. Now listen, I can change that to Three Dutch Damsels in five minutes, you know. Well, you do that, you big poop. Poop? What did you call me? Poop! As in poop-deck. As in stern. As in rear end. Wave farewell, Dan. Give us that confident grin. The world is our oyster. Be natural. That's not six feet. New horizons, Dan. All the arrogance of youth. - Harrigan, I'm gonna kill you. - That's good. Smile. I swear I'm going to strangle you. - Watch out. - What? - Help! - My God, it's her. - Jesus Christ. - What happened? Where am I? Grab her, Jack. - Kathleen! Kathleen! - You know her, too? - Miss Cooke. - Everybody knows her. - What do I do? Cut? - Are you kidding? Keep turning. - They're drifting! - Alice, get the truck. Everybody, onto the truck, now! Bring that camera. Let's go. On the truck? I've never done that before. Don't be scared, miss. Stay right there. I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna help you, miss. Don't be scared. Here comes a rope. - Grab the rope. - Where is it? By your head. Stop wiggling. - That don't help none. - I see it. - I've got it. - Now hang on. Now hang on, hang on, miss. Cooke, you're fired, damn it! - Get the truck, you fools. That's our balloon. - Hurry up! Hurry up! Take off, Alice. Follow them. We'll miss the rescue. Hang on, miss. Hang on, I almost got you. Here we go. Hang on now. I got you. Grab my hands, grab my hands. - Grab my hands, grab my... - I'm trying. - Okay, I got you. - Okay. I almost got you. Here we go, come on in now. Okay. Why, Mr. Greenway, you've grown a mustache. - Miss Cooke. - I tripped. - Stand up, stand up. We can't see you. - Harrigan, I'm gonna pulverize you. - Did you say Harrigan? Not Leo Harrigan? - I think I'm going to be sick. Do that again where it almost tipped over. That was good. I swear I'm gonna strangle you! Don't look into the camera, you big oaf! Be natural. - If I just had my rifle. Oh, God! - Don't look down, Mr. Greenway. I can't see a thing, so I'm not scared at all. - Then you're as crazy as he is. - Just don't look down. - Don't look down? - That's right. Don't look down. - I won't look down. - No, take your hands away from your face. - Play the scene. - What's he doing? Keep looking at me. - He's directing a picture. - A moving picture? How exciting. I've never even seen one. Well, Miss Cooke, it's just possible you never will. Be debonair. You're an explorer. - For Pete's sake, Alice, come on. - I can't help it. There's no road here. - Well, be careful. How is it, Frank? - Swell between bumps. They're going toward the railroad tracks. - Well, so what? Follow them. - There's a train coming. What? Should I try to beat it? - Yes, beat the train. - Hang on. - No, maybe not. - I can beat the train. Don't beat the train, Alice. - I can beat it! - Don't beat it. - I can! - Alice, don't! Hail Mary, full of grace. Too bad it didn't hit them. - Do you hear a hiss? - What? What kind of hiss? - Like air escaping. - That ain't funny. Okay, take off, Alice. Follow them. Oh, my God, I think you're right. Did you see that, for God's sake? - I don't believe it. - Still turning. Keep turning. Alice, stop on the tracks. What a shot! Kiss her, kiss her, for God's sake! - He says I'm supposed to kiss you, ma'am. - Yes, he did. Well, he's the director. Perfect. Hold it a little longer, Frank. Slow Iris to black. And cease. Cut. That's it. Okay, wrap it up, everybody. Get them off. Now bring the train back. Oh, God, how are we going to get them back? That's damn good, Leo, as far as I can tell. - Thanks, Sally. - Here, have a beer. Good? It was great. Not even Mr. Griffith gets stuff like that, Leo. Not by accident anyway. How about a hand for the cameraman? I don't see where my role fits in. Oh, come on, Kingsley, you wouldn't know a good film if it bit you in the nose. Reggie's got a point. That's what's been bothering me. What are we going to do with this stuff? I mean, what's the plot? Why is that girl in a silly Dutch costume? - And who is she? - You got me. - That's... - Kathleen, ain't it? - Kathleen Cooke. - Yeah, but who is she in the story? - Oh, yeah. - I didn't think of that. - That's a... - Problem. - Son of a bitch. - Yeah. The boy and the girl are madly in love with each other, but they're from two old Dutch families who've been feuding for years. They're told they must never see each other again, ever. So the boy decides to take off in his balloon and explore the vast unchartered regions of Africa and forget his only love. But at the very last minute, though, she defies her father and rushes off to be at his side. She trips and ends up in the balloon, which lands on a train and takes them to Africa where they live happily ever after. You can call the picture Romeo's Balloon. Alice, that's terrific. Whoa, Alice you just fixed the whole... I'll play the father. Never darken my door again, young man. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What about the stuff we've already shot with Buck and Marty? She could play his sister. You just change the titles. - I like it. - Yeah. Yeah. You don't mind playing the sister? Well, I can't be the brother. And about the money... That'll be $15. Fifteen dollars? Why, you stole the whole thing from William Shakespeare. So what? You steal everything from the Saturday Evening Post, and they pay you. - Feel better now? - Except for one slight problem, yes. They'll be back, Coach. - They've only been gone two days. - A day and a night and a day. Hey, Chief, looky here. The train just brung in The Gazette and we're in it. - Picture and everything. - Look at that. There's you and there's me, I guess. Big as life. Big as life. - I don't see my likeness anywhere. - I don't either. Now those Patents bastards are going to know Buck lied to them. - About not finding us here, you mean? - Yeah. - Oh, they don't read the Gazette. Do they? - Leo's right, we better get out of town. - Son of a bitch. - Yeah. Well... - Where we going to go? - I don't know. - We could go use the ostrich farm. - I thought you said ostrich farm. That's 'cause I did say it. I got one over at La Mesa. It's pretty deserted now except for five ostriches and Aunt Lula. I could use the rent. That's the tallest damn horse I've ever been on in my life, Harrigan. - You owe me for two train tickets. - What did you do to your mustache? Don't you try to change the subject. Well, Dan, I guess he was a bit taller than I expected. Hello, Miss Cooke, long time no see. - Mr. Mulligan. - Harrigan. You got any idea how hard a horse that tall can kick? Well, I think I'm going to find out. - How was that damn stuff? - It was great. Glad to have you back. Great, except for one petrified Florida cracker. I heard that. I heard that. Hello, I'm Marty. Anyway, you were covered by the new leading lady. I hope you'll be the new leading lady, Miss Cooke. Well, Mr. Harrigan, as it turns out, I am presently at liberty. - This here's John. - Hello. - Jack. - Hey, Buck, how are you? - What? What did I, what, do? - Alice, tell them how the story ends. Princess. - Romeo's Balloon. - Oh, yeah. It's got a happy ending. They get married. Married? What a great idea. An African tribal wedding. Sure is, that's what I was going to say next. - We're getting hitched. - I just said that, Dan. I just said it. Yeah, but you're talking about a picture. I'm talking about reality. We are going to get hitched, just as soon as I can rustle up a padre. Ain't we Kathy-o? Well, looks like tomorrow I'm going to lose a lot of good customers, so for right now, the drinks are on the house. Come on. Look out. Look out. Look out. I'll take you home again, Kathleen Across the ocean wild and wide Go on, Buck. To where your heart has ever been Since first you were my bonnie bride Everybody! The roses all have left your cheeks Come on, Leo. I've watched them fade away and die Sure, I'd like one, Jack. How you been? Your voice is sad when e'er you speak And tears bedim your loving eyes Up, up, up. I will take you back, Kathleen To where your heart will feel no pain Oh, thank you. - You moved in on me didn't you, pal? - You got to be fast on the draw, counselor. I'll take you to your home again And will you love her and keep her, forsaking all others, in sickness and in health till death do you part? - Sure do. - ""I do."" I do, too. And you, my dear, will you promise to love... Oh, no, no. Cut. - Cut. Cease. - Ceasing. Alice, will you tell Matilda to get out of the shot, please. - That's Randolph. - Well, tell Randolph. He's supposed to be in the next shot. - Aunt Lula. - Why didn't he tell Randolph himself? - He's the big director. - You're very helpful, Aunt Lula. - Reloading. - Bring it in a little closer. Moving closer. Randolph, why don't you go stick your head in the sand. - Get going, I said. - Are we really married yet? Not yet. I lost track five hours ago. Put it back, please. Not yet. - Not yet? - Not yet. Anybody got any water? It's hot here in Africa. Maybe he'd settle for some tall ducks. - Here he... - Comes. Jesus, Dobie, can't you just grab him by the neck and pull him back? Well, hell, Boss, he spits and kicks something awful. He's fierce. Have you seen his toes? Mean, too. - Son of a bitch. - It's only a bird. - Excuse me, Mr. Harrigan. - Just a moment, Father. Well, do what you can, boys, will you? What is it, Logan? When are you going to be telling these people that I'm an actor, not a priest? - They keep asking me to bless them. - Well, bless them, Father, bless them. Just shut up about it. Any moment, Father, any moment. Dan. Would you ask Alice to be a bridesmaid? We need one and she won't put on the blackface. Well, I don't blame her. They all look ridiculous. Why would you say that? I can't help it. Cobb will not send any money for extras. He says, ""Burn some cork and black up the crew."" Mr. Harrigan, couldn't we put in a bit of Othello? It was my greatest triumph in the legitimate theater. ""Damn her, lewd minx! Oh, damn her!"" - All right, Reginald, we will. - Fine. - Go on, Dan. - All right, all right. Let's get going. The wedding's taking so long, I ain't gonna have time for my honeymoon. I'm heartbroken. - Miss Cooke. - Kathleen. Miss Cooke, are you familiar with Mulligan's law? - I don't believe so. - It goes like this, Miss Cooke. It's never too late. - Oh, Mulligan. - I carry a hell of a torch. Hi, beautiful. Shakespeare. French, huh? What you so sore about? Do you hear me? - I ain't. - What? - Sore. - Yeah, you are. Spit it out. You said you'd teach me to ride. - I will. - You won't. I will, too. As soon as we get around some four-legged critters again. Might be riding better than me. - Which ain't that hard. - I won't. Now why do you say that? You're getting married. Well, I'm stuck on her. - Only known her a week. - Well, it only takes a second. The first time I saw her, I thought my teeth were going to sweat. Besides, I ain't that good a rider nohow. - Thought it was your middle name. - No. My middle name is ""Liar."" - Well, if you do teach me... - Ain't no if about it. - Can we go alone? - Well, could we take the horses? - I guess so. - Fair enough. - Come on, Dan needs a flower girl. - Okay. Hi, honey. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Food any good? Nope. But the Father likes it fine. Well, it's been a long wedding day. Do you know what day of the week it is? It's Friday, ain't it? Correct me if I'm wrong, but what is it that Catholics don't eat on Friday? Is he eating meat? That's right. Just like a starving actor. - Wouldn't you say, Father? - What? Excuse me? - Marty, I smell a rat. - Do you? - All ready, everybody. Places. - An Irish rat. Father Logan. Bride, groom. Father, I got a confession for you. - Do you want to hear it? - Later, my son, later. Do you ever confess, Father? Of course, my son. Now bless you, bless you. All right, quiet, everybody. Buck, now all we need is the kiss. All right, camera. Father, you're not in this. All right, hurry up, let's go. Come on, well, what are you waiting for? Cut it, cut it. Look, she is supposed to be playing your wife, not your sister. All these people watching... Take her in your arms, see? Bring her to you. - Thanks a lot. You could've just told me. - All right, camera. Be natural. Okay. Perfect. Hold it, hold it, a little longer. Slow fade to black and cut. - Light's perfect for the finish, Leo. - All right then, everybody to the truck! Let's go. Come on. We're losing our light. Thank you very much, Father. It was a wonderful wedding. I'll get to you later. - Are we married, totally married, yet? - Don't worry about a thing, Kathy. - What are we doing, now? - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Aunt Lula! Aunt Lula, ready. - Just hurry up. I gotta go cook! - Okay, quiet, everybody! - Jump in. - Jump in. In with your spears, dancing and waving around. Come on, come on. Then take off for the sunset. Jimmy, a little romantic hurry music, come on. And camera. - How's this? - Too much black and take your glasses off. You said blackface. Never mind. Kiss the bride. A hug and a kiss. Be natural. Quick. - Says I'm supposed to hug you. - Okay, go ahead. - Good luck! - Kathleen, throw the bouquet! - Okay! - Buck, take off! Very pretty. Okay. Slow Iris to black. And cut. Okay, great. We got it. Come on back. We're going to find a real parson, you sorry son of a bitch. Excuse me, honey. See you Monday. Come on in! It only costs a nickel. - Five cents. - Oh, nickelodeon! And if you don't like the show, don't worry about it, because it only lasts 15 minutes. - Makes you feel real welcome, don't it? - Well, at least that rules out both Leo's. Lot of picture companies moving here. Somebody's trying to give you guys a bad name. Oh, who wants to be respectable anyway? Hey, Harrigan, we found a picture house. - I do. - Don't worry, it'll never happen. - Where? - Down the street. - Well, well. - I love my husband. Oh, you kids. If y'all going to make fun of me, I'm going to turn these clothes back in. Nope, nope, not me. Makes me feel real festive. Sort of continental. That's right. H.H. Cobb comes all the way to Los Angeles, we're going to look sharp. - Hey, Dan... - Frank? Excuse me. My second Christmas away from home. You miss Chicago? - The trolleys? - They got trolleys out here. We ought to make a Christmas picture. - Yeah. - There ain't no snow. I'm forgetting what it's like. It melts. Come on, let's go to the picture show. Gonna be late for Cobb's party. - He'd never notice. - Merry Christmas. - Come on in. Who's got the money? - Who's got the money? Yeah, 30 cents. Get the heck out of here, kids. It costs a nickel. Get out and stay out! - It's true. It's true. - Oh, shut up and sing, Dan. It smells like a zoo in here. - Look, it's Cobb. - What? Yeah, that's funny. What's he doing in a Patents House? - Look, it's... - Me. - Look, it's Robert. - Yeah. We never did one called Tuttle's Muddle, did we? No, no, it's from... - Rattlesnakes and Gunpowder. - Yep. - Romeo's Balloon. - That's right. I look real brave there, don't I? Hey, look at you, honey. - I never made this. - We shot it, though. But the titles are all wrong. - Quiet down there. - Oh, no, look. There's Matilda. - No, that's Randolph. - No, that's Randolph. - Isn't that... - The Pasha's Pride. - That's from Caves and Clubs. - Yeah. - That's me. - That's us. Sure is. There's me. - It's not making much sense, Harrigan. - Oh, yeah, it does. Dollars and cents. Now what? Harrigan, this is a mess. That son of a bitch Cobb has re-cut our stuff. - I remember this one. - The Gunman's Guilt. - Where are you going, Leo? - Leo? - You looked wonderful, Buck. - Didn't look bad, did I? - Alice? - Where's that film you just ran? Where is it? Don't hit me, mister, I got a sick mother. I don't know zip about it, fellow. We only run Patent pictures here. And this kid came by on his bicycle peddling some independent junk. You show them all the time! Shut up, both of you, and just give me my picture. - Your picture? - He directed it. - She wrote it. - And I'm in it. You're gonna be in it all right, if you don't give me my film... Look out! It ain't loaded. It ain't even loaded. - Don't hit me, sister, I got a sick mother. - I found it! - Harrigan! - All right, go get everybody. I'll meet you at the truck. Hurry up. It's happening on the inside. What are you doing out here? It's happening inside. - This place is sure getting a lot of nickels. - You ain't kidding. Buck, I think we're being followed. Oh, no, they're just probably going our way. - Nope, they're following us. - Let's get out of here. Harrigan! What did you do? Bring the whole town with you? You're the one that stole the picture. - What do you all want? - It's our picture. We have to show it to the boss, see? It's all cut wrong. We'll give it back later. - What the devil's going on here? - They're movies? Ain't you? - What? - Ain't you in the pictures? Yes, ma'am. Afraid we are. Can you get arrested for that? - Hey, what's your name? - Me, ma'am? Buck Greenway, ma'am. - Don't tell her your name. - Why not? I didn't steal the picture. What's your name, miss? - Mine? - No, no, the other one. Me? I'm Kathleen Cooke. Who are you? - Me? - Come on, let's get out of here. I seen you in Romeo's Balloon, miss. - You did? - Yeah. We love you in the pictures, Mr. Greenman. - Yeah. - Do you? - Thanks, miss. It's Greenway. Buck. - I direct their pictures. I'm Leo Harrigan. - I never seen yours, mister. - You been in a lot of them, too? No, I'm not in them, I make them. - Oh, he just makes them. - Just makes them? - You heard the lady, Dan. - Could you give us something, Buck? - Give you something? - Yes, so as our friends will believe us. Ah, see, we'd love to, folks, but see, these ain't our clothes. - They're rented. - Oh, who's going to care about one tie? - Here's his tie, Beth. - Let's get out of here. - I got his collar, Morgan. - Hey, what are you doing? Give me my hat. Come on, Leo, let's get them. Kathy, Kathy! - What's your name again? - D.W. Griffith. Now get that down. - Kathy. - D.W... - They're all crazy! - Leo, stop. Get back. Mr. Griffith, you'd better get out of here. - These are fanatics! - You're telling us? Movie fanatics. I heard this happened down at Cahuenga just last week. - Go on, get out of here. - Come on, Alice! Let's go. All right, folks. It's all over. These people got appointments. Now get away! Stop it. Space, I said space. That's what we need in this business. More space. When this racket began, nobody in his right mind would give it a month. But like Flopsy, it just growed and growed. - Like Topsy, Boss. - Her, too. - Space! - Six years ago, there were 4,000 nickelodeons in this country, now there are three times that many. And they're multiplying faster than guinea pigs. And what is it that these five cent halls of amusement require? - Guinea pigs. Product. - Product! - You said it, Mr. Cobb. That's what we need. - Damn right I said that. How are we doing on that desert story, boys? Come on, I'm falling asleep. Irish! Just the man I need. Steve, get their coats. Waiter, give 'em some of that hooch. - Take your coat? - No, thank you, it's a little brisk in here. - You, sir? - I'll just keep 'em on. All right, Harrigan, think fast. Two guys in the desert, no food, no water, no horses. - What happens to them? - They die. - In a comedy. - Mr. Cobb, I... - It's Chicago, H.H. - I'll take it over here. - Mr. Cobb, sit down. - That's okay, I ain't tired. You're going to be. - You guys drunk or what? - No, I'm going to talk. And for once in your life you're going to listen to one thing at one time. Now for two years, I have been wandering around the great southwestern wilderness of this country, faithfully making pictures for you. I have done this with my associates here through wind and rain, - boiling heat and icy cold. - Icy cold. - And have we ever complained? - Sometimes. - Never. - Never. - Never. - Day after day, diligently turning our camera, shooting each week as much as... - Three or four thousand feet. - Jam-packed with thrills and chills and sending it faithfully off to you - in Chicago. - In Chicago. Trusting you with our blood, sweat and tears. - My blood, my sweat and my tears. - Right. And so, today... No, thank you. And so today we chance to pass a nickelodeon, decide to while away an hour in innocent pleasure, and what do we see, Mr. Cobb? What assaults our innocent eyes? One of my own goddamn pictures. Not just one of our own goddamn pictures, but 10 of our own goddamn pictures. Ten of our best, most exciting dramas, cut by you, sir. Butchered into a single jumbled-up, truncated, foreshortened, all but incomprehensible mess. And here it is, exhibit A. Tuttle's Muddle! - Did they laugh? - That is beside the point. - They laughed. - Look, we're famous. Thirty-five dollars a week. That's slave wages. - What we want is more money. - We want a guarantee in writing that says you're not allowed to cut our stuff to ribbons any time you feel like it. A contract that says you ship them out the way you get them. Our way. - And more money. - Okay, that's it. I rest my damn case. And we'd like some more money. Well, children, it's Christmas Eve. Peace on Earth. Good will to men. You're all fired. Nothing personal. Have a drink. - We're all fired? - Mabel, pay them all off. - Steve, Steve. - Sir? Send a wire to the home office and have our B company sent out here to replace these departing friends. Clyde, tell me about these acres you want to unload here in Hollybush. Hollywood. Still got the farm. Ostriches could come back anytime now. - That was great, Harrigan. - Fired, for Pete's sake. - Fire, Leo! - He said that. - Oh, my God. - My film! Smother it, smother it! Oh, God. Here you go, Marty, hold this. We'll have to leave now. This room is on fire. Bring the furniture and the food. Reassemble in the hall and summon the red boys. - You all right? - Let's get you out of here. Hey! Fire drill. Everybody out. - Princess, do you see Kathy? - Leo's got her. - You! - Oh, hi. - You still got our rifle! - Leave him alone. And our money. Why, it's Greenway. Fellow, you were a knockout in Tuttle's Muddle. I was? Don't worry, folks. This hotel is made of pure steel. Strike up the band. Marty, can I have... Excuse me. Marty. Well, Mr. Harrigan, goodbye. - It's been a barrel of laughs. - What? She's sore, Leo. I can't seem to say the right thing. That's nothing new. Boy, you had to burn the place down to wake me up. We're all out of work, for Pete's sake. Franklin, you'd rather be out of work with him than in work with me, any time of the day or night. Now wait a second, Marty, that's just... Send my things care of Kinegraph Chicago, will you, Kathy? - Okay, Marty. - You're going back to Cobb? Damn right. He'll know a good deal when he sees one. So long, kiddo. - Don't take any wooden nickels. - Okay. Bye, Alice. So long, Buck. - Marty, where are you going? - Let's talk turkey, Greenway. We're Atlantic Pictures and Atlantic's going to the Pacific. - Let's talk about things. - H.H. Cobb. Yeah, damn blanket company from Chicago. Hey, I don't like that outfit's music. I don't want to hear it. - You know what I mean? - Harrigan, come here. We're prepared to offer you each 50 a week if you can report to work Monday morning. Yeah, what do you say to that? - Fifty? - Nope. You're right, Leo. - What? Who owns this kid? - We're independents, mister. Cobb's insane, boy. Wise up. Louder. Drown them out. 250 a week is just too much. We don't want to hold you up. Wait a minute, he didn't say 250, he said 50. - How much did you say? - Fifty. - And you? - Fifty. - Fifty, 50 and 50. 150, that's fine. - What? You mean you people each want 150 a week to leave Cobb? - We'll give it a serious thought. - No, we won't. - What? - Did she say yes to 150? - Yes. - Yes, sir, you got a deal. - Parker. Leo, shake the man's hand. 150 smackers a week. I wonder where their studio is at, Fort Knox? - Anybody get the address? - Hollywood. That's very good. Now, don't forget, it's freezing cold, now. It's cold. Tex, do you hear me? Tex, do you understand what I'm saying? Don't look at me, you'll ruin the shot. Help them out, give them some snow. Frank, you've got to talk to that joker photographing Kathleen. He's making her look like an elephant. How can I? They got me in bondage here. You really ought to shave that thing off, Leo. Harrigan, will you leave my cameraman alone? Let those pebbles drop like a rain. And stop chewing gum. Princess. Did you see those scenes they've written for Kathleen? She can't do those. Don't worry about Kathy. Wait till you see Buck. They got him dressed up just like a fluff. Quiet over there, Forsyte. Leave her alone, Harrigan. She's writing for me, if you don't mind. And quiet that dog. - He'll quiet as soon as I leave. - Harrigan. It looks better on Buck. All right, dear, look up! Atta girl, look up. Look terrified. Terrified. Lean out a little bit. Lean out. Now scream. - Cut. Cut. Cut. - I'm all right. No you're not, you're awful. You can't have her doing her own stunts, Stickley! - Falling out of stagecoaches. - She isn't supposed to fall out. - What's going on here? - Oh, he's making a fool out of her. What's going on here? - You all right, honey? - Sure, I'm fine. - I got her. No, I got her. - I got her. I got her. Hey, will you two guys get out of here? I'll do the directing. Out, out, out! - Come on, Greenway, off my set! - Take it easy, will you? Take it easy. - Look, I'll talk to you later, Kathy. - I'll talk to you later, darling. You won't see her later. You take care of yourself and I'll take care of my wife. You can't even take care of yourself. Look at you. You look ridiculous. I know I look ridiculous. I look like a twit. Okay, come on, Greenway, we're all waiting. Nobody can act in these socks. At least it didn't take me nine months to grow a mustache. Now daintily. - Well, it's about time. - Okay, camera. Okay, boys. No, no, no, no. Harold, if you're going to kiss her, you take her in your arms, you kiss her on the mouth. But, my dear sir, this young lady is playing my daughter. What? Let me see the script. - I gotta start reading these things. - It might help. Well, they throw them on the lawn like a newspaper. How do you expect to get anything prepared? Drinking your lunch again, Harrigan? Maybe that's why you're a day behind schedule. Give me my own people, I'll bring them in on time. Atlantic wants product, not excuses. And we want it fast. And as for the scenario you submitted, The Half-Breed Kid, it's a stinker. We want entertainment, not so much of junk about Indians. Christ, it's so long it took me almost an hour to read it. How many pages a day am I supposed to shoot, Mr. Blacker? - Five. At least, Harrigan, and you know it. - I remember. May I see the script, please? - Thank you very much. Five, was it? - Five. One, two, three, four, five. Here we are. And we're right back on schedule. You're on the verge, Harrigan. Right on the goddamn verge. Six months you've been here and never once you been in line. Neither you or any of your goddamn friends. You're nothing but a troublemaker. A goddamn, shoddy, Irish hooligan! Well, sir. I wouldn't want to make you a liar. - No, sir. I sure wouldn't. - Hey, hey, Harrigan. Don't throw your problems on me, Dan. You're through. Washed up. Get out! Get out! Pick up your pay and out of here or I'll have you arrested for trespassing. Do you hear? This is private property! Let's go. Come on. Here we go. What are you so jumpy about? Yeah, what? I, I, I... We came back to pick up Mrs. Greenway's wardrobe. - She forgot it this afternoon. - Who said that? What do you want? - My, my, my... - Her wardrobe trunk. Better put on your glasses. Might need to see something. Oh, good idea. - I left my trunk when... - Where? - Wardrobe, where else? - Keep your eye on the pipsqueak. I left my wardrobe trunk when... - What are you so nervous about? - I'm hot. - It's 50 degrees. - I'm cold. - Don't seem to know what you are. - I'm hot and cold. Let's go. That way. - It ain't gonna work. - Yes, it is. Well, just don't anybody leave any fingerprints. I read that in a story. - What did you say, Buck? - Fingerprints. Fingerprints? Little grease marks on the end of your fingertips. Well, I don't know about you, Buck, but my fingers aren't greasy. Everybody's are. That's how the police tell it was you. Look out. Get it, get it, get it, get it. - Good going, Greenway. - I ain't no damn robber is why. You want to play cards? Where are you going? Here it is. - Well, it says camera department. - Come on, Buck. There is the door. - Well, this one's locked. - Frank will take care of it. Frank. Taking. You want to pick one of these cameras, Leo? Just throw this blanket over it, 'cause that's the kind of company we are again. - A blanket company. - Yes, sir. - Oh, hurry up, you hear? - Buck, strike one of these, will you? - Yeah, come on, Dan. Make yourself useful. - I should've stood at home. - How much film we need, do you think? - Enough for a four-reel feature. - The Half-Breed Kid? - You know what, Leo? - A four-reeler? - You really are loco. - Maybe five. - That's over an hour long. Long pictures are coming in. Ain't nobody stayed in a theater over an hour. Sarah Bernhardt's done one. D.W. Griffith's working on two, I hear. - Come on, let's go. - Not with stolen film, they ain't. Looks like it might rain. - I wouldn't know. I can't see a damn thing. - I think so. Now! - Are you all right? - I guess so. Gin. - How am I doing? - Better than me. I hate horses. How come we didn't come out here in the damn truck? Because it couldn't cross this pass. ""Beware of jealousy, my Lord. ""'Tis the green-eyed monster that mocks the meat it feeds on."" That's from Othello. - What fellow? - Othello by William Shakespeare. Oh, yeah, I've heard of him. That's good, yelling and shooting. Now ride up to him, Kathy. Ride, catch up to him. Good. Kathy! Oh, God, is she all right? - Kathy! - Cut? No, no. Keep turning. That's right, save her, Dan. Keep going. Tell them to keep coming. - Jump? - Jump. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - How was it? - Are you kidding? - Are you kidding? - Go on, Dan! Shoot at them. Elmer, tell them to fall. Cut. Perfect. - Oh, Dan. - Kathy, you all right? - That just couldn't have been better. - Yeah, I'm great. Oh, that ain't acting. Well, tomorrow starts the Indian part. - Off goes the mustache. - Oh, his mustache. - Yeah, I know, I know. - Hey, babe. - Think you could do that fall again? - I didn't fall, the horse did. Elmer, tell them we cut! Four reels, Kathy, almost an hour. And I'm gonna tell a story with enough punch to put us all on the map. L. Taylor Harrigan's The Half-Breed Kid. And this one is from the heart, because you know, the Indian, he's like the Irish, the way I see it. He's been robbed and pillaged, he's been starved off his homeland. It's a blot on our escutcheon, for Christ's sake. And it's the stuff of great drama, don't you see? Well, you know, cowboys and Indians. Hey, Leo! The sun does go down around here, you know. We're ready. Elmer, bring the cowboys... I mean, bring the Indians over here. - No go. Devil Mountain. - I need them in the shot. What's the matter, Alice? They want more money? I don't know. Elmer, all they've got to do is walk into the shot. No go. Devil Mountain. - Jesus. - Light's going, Coach. Harrigan! Is this the way you want me? - Perfect. - Perfect? I look like a damn girl. - I look like Theda Bara. - All right, here we go. Princess. - Yes, sir. - Elmer, you have the Indians stand guard. Grab the mirror and bring the powder. Come on, Frank, let's get a little closer to Hiawatha. The Indians are afraid of the damn mountain or something. - I heard that. What do you mean, afraid? - How should I know? Superstitious. They probably think the mountain is bad luck or something. Now, I've sent Kathy to the top. All you've got to do is climb up there and rescue her. Rescue her? - Who's going to rescue me? - Well, pretend you're rescuing her. You can pretend, can't you? What you getting paid for? I ain't getting paid, 'cause crime don't pay. - I should've known that. - Oh, cut it out, Dan. It's gotta look real. Now when you get to that bush there, Elmer's gonna let off a little dynamite charge. - Dynamite? - Just a little, to look like a bullet hit. It's buried right by that bush there. Well, I ain't gonna do it, how do you like that? Okay, swell. Well, we won't have any cowboys in the shot. We won't have any bullets. We won't have anything. - Well, just forget it. Let's go home. - Okay, okay, stop acting. - You're a lousy actor. Where do I stop? - You don't. You let the dynamite stop you. Elmer won't let you get too close before he sets it off. - Here I am. I'm ready. - Kathy, put some clothes on. - This is my costume. - Well, where's the rest of it? - Let's go, Dan. We're losing the light. - Okay. Let's get her over with. All right, here we go. Be natural. And camera. Good, fine. That's fine. Now make it look near impossible. - I don't have to act. - All right now, Elmer. Get ready with that charge. That's right, good. And... Now. No, no, no. Cut it. No good, no good. You anticipated. You flinched. I did not. - Buck, you okay, Buck? - He flinched. Well, who wouldn't flinch from dynamite? That's a pure sign of intelligence. Flinching probably saved my life 200 times since I met you, Harrigan. Well, by the time Elmer resets, the damn light will be gone. - About gone now, Leo. - That ain't my fault. Oh, who the hell said it was? I swear, Harrigan, one of these days I'm gonna kill you. Well, just don't scalp me, Chief. That ain't funny. - Sure it is. - It ain't funny. Oh, Buck, he was only just fooling. Yeah, that's what you always think. He was only fooling. Well, I'm tired of being the butt of it. I'm tired of being made a fool of all the time, risking my neck, and never getting paid for it. Oh, come on, Dan, what is it? - What's the matter? - Don't ""Dan"" me. I'm sick of this pipe dream. Sneaking around like a common thief, making this great damn feature. Well, who the hell cares? It's just another western. - Now, come on, be careful. - Only longer. Now watch it! I've been working on this thing for two years. No, you watch it. We could be working for some legitimate company now and be paid for it and treated with some kind of respect. I ain't a damn kid no more. You don't mean that, Buck. You know it wouldn't be the same. No, it'd be better. And if you're gonna keep sticking up for him all the time, maybe you'd be happier with him and his lot of goddamn hooey. You don't need to curse, nor yell, neither. - We can all hear all right. - Maybe so. But you can't see he's been after your skirt from the start. If you're gonna stick up for him all the time, as far as I'm concerned, he can have it. Buck! I don't need your darn permission, Tom Greenway. No, well, you got it, ma'am. And welcome to it. I quit. Hey, come back here. Where are you going? You can't quit on us. Devil Mountain. - You look terrible. - Thank you. Well, don't you notice anything? - What? - It's gone. - Oh, yes. - Frank found him. I was going to take a bath. - Good, I'll keep guard. - What? I need a glass. How's The Half-Breed Kid? - Half-baked. - Poor Mulligan. I remember the first time you ever called me that. Now don't get mushy. Where is he? I'll take you home again... I thought you were the prettiest thing I ever saw. - Leo. - On the trolley. In my Pullman, hanging by your foot. - Oh, God, remember that? - Bloomers out. He's at the Alexandria. Drink your wine. - I'm very boring when I'm drunk. - Very boring. My bath. - Oh, that's perfect. - What a mess. - Here, I got it. - Oh, that's okay, I got it. I got it. - Kathy. - Leo. - Kathy. - Now, Leo. It's just about right. Not too hot, not too cold. Give me a hand. - Did you hear something? - Just a crash. - What? - I thought I heard something by the shack. - Isn't Leo out there? - I don't know, maybe. Nothing. Leo says those Patents guys can smell a blanket company five miles away. - Three. - Three? I heard it was only three. Leo. Come here, Leo. Leo. What are you thinking? I was thinking, what would happen if Buck came home now? Why? Nothing happened. Well, here I am in his house, in his robe, on his bed, with his wife. No jury in the world would convict him if he shot me. Leo. - It's not that I don't love you. - Yeah, yeah? It's just that I can't. Now what if I'd been in that balloon instead of Buck? Yeah? Would he be here now and I'd be in some hotel? - That's hard to say. - Yeah, but I'd shoot him. - Do you hear that? - It's going to go by. - It's the neighbors. - I'm the neighbors. - Kathy-o! - I don't believe it. - You upstairs, honey? - Get out the window, quick! - I don't believe it. My clothes. - Oh, my God. - Honey. - Hail Mary, full of grace. - You up here, honey? - Be natural. Okay, okay, okay. I'll be right out, Buck. Just a second. Honey. I had me a long thinking. I was afraid you might even change the locks. I'll be right out, Tom. I know I've been kind of wrong. - What was that? - Must be that old cat. Stay here, Kathy. - It's them Patents bastards. - Buck, wait. - Don't shoot, it's me. You're back. - Did you see him? That's where he fell, I guess. See the trail? Goes behind the garage. I think he's cornered. What is it, Frank? - Stay right there, Alice. - Buck, you're back. All right, come on out, mister. You can't get away, so don't try. I got a rifle here and the sorry end's pointing your way. These aren't my clothes. Yeah. - Frank, go after him. - Take my car. - He'll hurt himself. - The keys are in it. Alice! Alice! - Jesus, God! - Alice! - Alice, for God's sake! - I'm all right. - You sure? - Sure. They got the camera, too. They got everything. - Some guard, Frank. - Some friend, Leo. - Nothing happened. - What are you talking about? - Don't be such a saint, Frank. - Okay. Frank, wait. I'm sorry. - That's the one. - Okay. - Yeah, what is it? - Telegram, telegram for Mr. Greenway. - Telegram? - Well, more like a package. See? It says here, ""Deliver at 10."" Well, that could be a mistake. It was. - Don't even tell me about it. - There's nothing to tell, Tom. They gave me the damn bridal suite. I'd love to see it. Come on in. - Are you just going to climb in that bottle? - Maybe. - Go say you're sorry. - For what? They wouldn't listen anyway. You were getting pretty good, you know. Yeah, I'm particularly good without a camera or film or actors. - What's the matter with me? - I give up, what's the matter with you? They like little girls in pictures, you know. Look at Mary Pickford. - Mary Pickford is 20 years old. - See? And I'm younger even. - Not bad. You could be in them, too. - Thank you very much. I've got some money saved up. And we can get Frank to help us. I don't think so. - What? - I don't think so. Well, maybe Dobie and the boys, then. They'd do it. And then we can sell the ostrich farm. - Aunt Lula will never forgive us. - We'll let her keep Randolph. - Here we are. Smile, honey. - I'm smiling. Hey, it's the Greenways. Leo, stop it. Stop barking at Leo all the time. That's all right. He's just excited. - Mr. Harrigan. - Hey, Leo. Alice. Keep an eye on the dog, will you? - You are pretty. - Yes, she's pretty. Come on, honey. Boy, I sure hope it's better than the play. - I hear he's changing the title for New York. - Yeah? To what? The Birth of a Nation. Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Griffith! Here, hold this. Honey, hold my hat. - Are you all right? - What's going on? Harrigan. Greenbush. Where the hell have you been when I need you? - How's that? - I'm inspired, but damn it, I'm stumped. - I beg your pardon. - I want a war story. A big one. Civil war, I suppose. The war in Europe, Irish. Pay attention. - What war in Europe? - What war in Europe? - Marty! - What? Oh, yes. I want you all to meet my bride, Mrs. H.H. Cobb. Everyone calls her Marty. - Mr. Cobb... - What? What? What? Hello, gang. - Marty. - Hi there, Marty. - Marty. - Hi, kiddo. Buck. Hello, Frank. Hello, Marty. Well, where was I, Bertha? - Come on, boys. - Mr. Cobb... - If you don't... - Did you see what I saw tonight? Now, this thing is going to change the business. The Patents Trust is wiped out. The greatest motion picture of all time has just been unfurled, and it was made by a blanket company. That's the magic. That's the mystery. There's no stopping this business. The time of the nickelodeon is over. A new day has dawned. The epoch of the picture palace. Big pictures. Big theaters. Six reels. Eight reels. Look at this thing tonight, fifteen reels. - Twelve. - See what I mean? Look, I don't want to go that far. Griffith's a genius, but he's a little crazy. - He's a little crazy? - He's a little crazy. You said it. Harrigan, how long is that Indian script you used to keep shoving in people's faces? - The Half-Breed Kid? - Four or five reels. Why? Make it seven! What are you all standing around here for? This is the beginning of the world. - Mr. Cobb, don't you see... - Think of it. All those people going to see the pictures. And a lot of them can't even talk American. Then they don't have to because pictures are a language that everybody understands. It's like music for the eyes. And if you're good, if you're really good, then maybe what you're doing is you're giving them little tiny pieces of time that they never forget. Miss Forsyte, your motorcar. The child owns this? The end is near. Shorty, if you're interested in a salary twice your size, raise your mitt. Mr. Cobb, you're trying to bribe us. You can't bribe somebody who doesn't trust you, Irish. Get in the car, before they arrest your husband for assault and battery. - What? - Take a ride, make a getaway, - have a script conference. - Don't pay him no mind, honey. What are you waiting for? Opportunity knocks but twice. - For Pete's sake. - Harrigan, I want a feature. A big one. Now whatever you're paying yourself, I'll double it. That goes for all of you. Call me tomorrow. Where am I driving? Okay, that's where I'm driving. Script conference? I'd rather quit than have to work with you again. - I'd rather quit, period. - Good. We finally agree on something. Might as well quit. The best damn picture that's ever going to be made has already been made. You sure as hell ain't gonna make one better. I'm sick of this racket anyway. Get up at dawn, work all day, every night, six days a week. So bushed on the seventh you can't get out of bed. - No family. - No home or nothing. And these directors you work with today, they don't know their left from their right. Yeah, well, I hear you've been directing them yourself, so that doesn't surprise me. I've seen your acting. I wouldn't be talking if I was you. Yeah, the fun's gone out of it, sure. Look at that. Bring the camera over there. They're shooting a picture. Half-Breed Kid, huh? Well, I ain't much of a kid no more. You could shave your mustache. Oh, his mustache? - Give me 10 years. - Give us all 10 years. Music. Well, I'm getting sick. I got a real great idea for the finish. Hey, Leo, remember what Cobb said, he wants a seven-reeler. That finish is my idea, Harrigan. Camera. Action! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Nickie! What are you doing? Just practicing, dear. Will you have a little slice of throat? You'd better hurry, we're getting into San Francisco in five minutes. Asta, my best Sunday-go-to-meeting hat! Darling, don't you want to pack these? How they can expect a woman to still have any mystery left for a man... after living in a place like this for three days, I don't know. You don't need mystery. You've got something better and more alluring. - What? - Me. You! It's all right, we're married. Darling, you've got to pack. Yes, that's right. Pack. I must pack. Are you packing, dear? Yes, darling, I'm just putting away this liquor. If you break that, they can sue you. Oh, baby, you know, I'm going to miss this little room of ours. - It's left some lasting impressions on me. - Dear, will you pack this? Yes, delighted. - You know, I sort of hate to leave this. - Don't leave anything. Well, are you gonna wear this dress, dear? - No, you can put that in. - That's fine. - Hey, is Nick Charles in this car? - Two cars back. Hello, Nick. How long till you're detecting again? That's what we want to know. I'm through detecting for the rest of my natural life. Will you keep on with your detective work? I've retired. I'll take care of my wife's money so I'll have something in my old age. You said you'd retired, but you took that Thin Man case. That was a beaut. They're still talking about it. Smile for the news, Nick. Dig us up another Thin Man, will you, Nick? That was a great case. You'd take a case like that, wouldn't you, Nick? I only took that to please my wife, she wanted excitement. I guess she had it. It was wonderful! Two men tried to kill him. But he's not going to take any more cases. You can print that. That's my darling. Can you get a big story like that for us Nick? How could I? Welcome home, Mrs. Charles. - Hello, Harold. - Hiya, Nick. Hiya, Harold. I'm glad to see you. So long, Nick. See you around. - Excuse me, lady. - Hello, Fingers. - Well, Nick, how are you? - How's business? I quit that racket. - Nick, look, my purse is gone. - Darling, isn't that too bad. - Nora, I want you to know Fingers. - How do you do? - This is my wife. - Your wife? - I didn't know you were married. - Yes, I'm married. Nick, what'll I do? I know I had it. Don't worry, darling. It'll turn up, won't it, Fingers? - Well, I certainly hope so. - Yeah. Nick, am I tickled to death to see you. Good old Nick, and married, too. - I didn't know you were married. - Oh, yes. I'm glad I bumped into you. - Goodbye, Mrs. Charles. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Fingers. - Come on, dear. - But, darling, I can't just go off... We don't want to embarrass him. - What're you talking about? - He's a purse snatcher. - Think of his feelings. - Then he must have taken it. - So long, Fingers. - So long, Nick. Here you are, dear. Dear, you do know the nicest people. - Hello, Nick. - Hello, Bill! You can start delivering again. No, the big kegs. - Hello, Nick. Where you been? - Hello. How are you, boys? - Where have you been? - Have I been away all my life. - Have you seen The Kid? - No, where is he? - He's staging a comeback Friday night. - Yeah? Hey, Screwy. Here's Nick Charles. - Hello, Mr. Charles. - How are you? Glad to see you. - Hello, Nick. - Hi, Kid. How's it going? Never better! Say, now I know I can't lose. You coming to see me fight? Mrs. Charles would never think of missing your fight. Mrs. Charles? Did you ever see me fight? You got a treat, then. I'm gonna cut that guy up in ribbons. - If he's not bleeding in the first round... - You'll have him bleeding? Yeah! Excuse me, Mrs. Charles. If my legs will only hold out, I'll kill the guy, I'll knock... Attaboy, Bump. You'll get him, sure. Give it to him hot, eh? - Sure. - Okay, Harold. - Hello, Nora! - Hello. Who is that? You wouldn't know them, darling. They're respectable. Isn't it lovely? Home. So peaceful, so quiet. If anybody wakes me up for a week, I'm going to have the law on them! New Year's Eve at home. Or would you know that this is New Year's? - I know. - I suppose you got ideas, huh? - Very definite ideas. - I was afraid so. I'm going to lock the door, plug the bell, cut the telephone... and crawl into bed for a month. Nora, you're my favorite woman! Here. I'm going to be in bed at midnight, so Happy New Year. Happy New Year! Here. Come in. Give me your hat and coat. Make yourself at home. It's our house, all right. Let's go in. That man said it was all right. - The bar is right in here. Help yourself. - Thanks. - Okay! - What's the celebration? We're giving a surprise party for Nick and Nora. - Nick and Nora? - Don't you know Nick and Nora? - No. - Neither do I. But that's not going to spoil my fun. It's New Year's, so what's the odds? - Go on in. Fake it. It's a cinch. - Thanks. Go on in and get some of that Napoleon Brandy before it's all gone. Let's get it together, this is supposed to be a surprise party. - Well, I'm acting surprised. - Look at that. Not bad, eh? - Oh, no, not at all. - How're you doing? - Anyone wise to you yet? - No. - What did I tell you? - May I have this dance? If I was in a fire on the third floor, would you save me? - It's too late for you to be saved. - I mean it. How would you do it? I'd just pick you up and carry you right down like this. Now you save me. You put her down and you save me. I'm on the third floor, too. I'll bet you can't do this. Now watch me. Here I go. Not bad. So when I picked this big lug up, he didn't know a thing. I taught him everything he knows. Show them that new arm lock I taught you. Okay. Just show him that headlock. This will kill you. Say, look, show him how you throw them out in the aisle. Hello, Nick. Hello, Nora. Welcome home. We are tendering this little surprise party for the... Will you keep out of the kitchen? We are busy. Where'll I put this ice? - Lay it down and don't bother me. - Put it in the sink and break it up. - Where's the oil? - There isn't any more. - Where do you want these? - Over here, son. And after that, come back from the store with some olive oil. - My toast! - I'll take care of that. Mr. Charles, what are you doing here? All right! Hello there, Mr. Charles. I'm glad to see you back. - How are you, Nick? - Did you enjoy your trip to Los Angeles? We saw your pictures in the paper. It said you did a good job in New York. I guess they'll be scared to death if there are more murders there. I've been scared to go down in the cellar ever since. Don't you worry, Rose, if anyone murders you, I'll catch them. Mr. Charles, don't be talking that way. What do you think of the party they're giving you? Looks like we're giving it. - It does that, now. - Something's burning! Excuse me, I'll answer the phone. That's probably your Aunt Katherine. She's phoned several times. She wants you to come to dinner. Goodbye, Mrs. Charles, I'll see you next year. - She expects you, too, Mr. Charles. - Me? There must be some mistake. She wouldn't want you. No. What excuse will I make? Tell her I lost a collar button in New York and we've got to go look for it. It's your cousin, Mrs. Landis, madam. Thank heavens it isn't Aunt Katherine. - Go on, get out of it now. - Don't worry. I wouldn't go through that again if you had twice as much money. Hello, Selma. Nora, I just wanted to make sure you were coming tonight. But you've just got to come, I'm in terrible trouble, please. No, I can't tell you now, but you must come. I'm desperate... Selma! - Whom are you calling? - Nora. - I told you... - I can't help it. L... There are pills in my bag, take them. - No, really, I'm all right. - Take them or I'll call Dr. Kammer. How are you, Nora? This is Aunt Katherine. You ought to know Selma well enough not to pay any attention to that. You see, it's New Year's Eve, Aunt Katherine. - The old battle-axe. - Shut up! Excuse me, Aunt Katherine, I was talking to the dog. - But, Aunt Katherine... - Give me that phone. Give it to me. Yes. All right. We'll come. Nickie, I'm sorry. But I had to do it. Selma's in trouble. You like Selma, don't you? Well, not that much. Family dinner, I suppose? Aunt Katherine, Uncle Willie... Cousin Emily. Aunt Hattie, Cousin Lucius, Uncle Thomas. Pour me one, too. Thanks. Well, Asta? Why are you looking so down in the mouth? Have you got family troubles, too? For heaven's sake, do you want the servants to hear you? I don't care. I'm going crazy. I can't stand it any longer. - I'll call the police. - You'll do nothing of the sort. We've paid enough to hush up his other scandals. He never did anything like this before. - How do we know whether he... - I told you I'd handle this. - I can't go on! - Quiet! Beg pardon, madam, but should I remove Mr. Robert's plate? - Certainly not. Mr. Robert will be here. - Very well. - You know he won't be here. - I know nothing of the sort. Now go upstairs and make yourself presentable. Go on, hurry. Hurry now, because everybody's waiting. - Good evening, all. - Good evening, Aunt Katherine. I had a birthday last week, Katherine. I'm 83 years old. - What do you think of that? - That's fine, Lucy. - Next year I'll be 84. - Splendid. Now we're alone. I have something important to tell all of you. What did she say? Isn't that thing working, Hattie? This works beautifully. It's you, you mumble. What is it, Katherine? Nora and her husband are coming tonight. - Katherine, after the last time? - But, Katherine... - Her husband? - That person. But you said yourself you wouldn't have him again. I know I did. And my opinion of him and what he represents hasn't changed a particle. Then why did you ask him? I have a very good reason for asking him, which you will know in time. That must be they now. Understand, now, I want you all to be pleasant to him. - Of course, if you say so. - It's going to be difficult. Poor Nora, my heart bleeds for that child. If that's Mr. And Mrs. Charles, show them right in. Yes, madam. What are you muttering to yourself? I'm trying to get all the bad words out of my system. Good evening, Henry. Is this the wax-works? - Sir? - Nothing, Henry, nothing. I'll leave my things down here. Don't worry, it isn't catching. Thank you, sir. Walk this way, sir. Well, I'll try. Nickie, pull yourself together. One squint at Aunt Katherine would sober anybody up. Mr. And Mrs. Charles, madam. Hello. How do you do, my dear. Hello, Aunt Katherine. You remember Nick? How are you, Nicholas? - Hello, Cousin Helen. - How are you, you poor child? This is Nora's husband. I think you know everybody. Yes, I seem to remember the old faces. Dear, I want you to meet Uncle Willie. Poor Nora is so brave. - Uncle Willie, my husband. - Uncle. And, dear, this is Aunt Hattie. - How are you? - Don't mumble, young man. How are you? - She's deaf. - You're telling me. What did she say? When you hear the chime it will be exactly... - Selma, how are you? - It's so good to see you. Hello, Nick. Thank heavens you came. Selma, what's the trouble? Tell me. We'll postpone any discussion until after dinner. - Where's your husband? - Yes, where's Robert? Robert telephoned that he was unavoidably detained. So we'll start without him. Are you ready? We haven't quite men enough around, so, Lucius, will you take Hattie and Charlotte? Willie, will you take Helen and Emily? Burton, will you take Nora? Nicholas, you will take Aunt Lucy. Come on, Selma. What was it you were going to tell me? Nora, come here! Just a minute, Aunt Katherine. What was it? - Robert has disappeared. - Disappeared? Selma, go on playing. I can't go on playing. Nonsense, go on! I can't! What are you trying to do, torture me? How can you act like this when you know what she's going through? - Get Nicholas. - You bet I will. No, really? Well, you amaze me. Will you explain that point a bit further? Well, I wouldn't go as far as to say that. What's that? Just a moment. Really? Well, now, surely you're not going to let that pass unchallenged, are you? You must have something to say to that. That's the boy. I knew you had it in you. Nick, come here. - Oh, yes. - Hurry! If you gentlemen will excuse me. I don't know when I've spent such a stimulating evening. What is it? - Aunt Katherine wants to speak to you. - What have I done now? Do you know why Robert wasn't here tonight? - Sure, because he's smart. - I'm not fooling, darling, he's disappeared. That's swell. Now if we could just get Aunt Katherine to disappear... Here he is. Nicholas, I'm sorry to take you away from the boys. That's quite all right. - How long has Robert been gone? - Three days. Three days without a word. - Have you notified the police? - Certainly not. - And we're not going to. - Oh, no. Robert may have been kidnapped. He may be lying dead somewhere. But we mustn't do anything about it. Our precious name might get into the papers. Don't pay any attention to her. She's exaggerating the whole affair. However, to please her, I thought you might investigate the matter quietly. - With your experience as a... - Flatfoot. I didn't mean to be blunt as that. What's the difference? It's all in the family. - Have you any idea where he might be? - Yes. - He's with some woman, I know that. - Selma, you know nothing of the sort! What about the vanity case they sent me from that Chinese restaurant? That was a stupid mistake on their part. Mistake? He's with some woman, you know it. Selma, you know Robert worships you. He wouldn't... How can you say such a thing when you know that he hates me? He only married me for my money! He never did love me. Sometimes I wish he were dead! I'm just a little confused. Do you want him back or don't you? - Nick! - Why, of course she wants him back. - Selma, don't, please don't. - I'll leave this in your hands, Nicholas. If you'll excuse me, I'll go back to my guests. Don't worry, darling. It'll be all right. Nick will find him. The one sure way to get him back is to cut off his money. - I know. - Well, if he doesn't show up before... tomorrow morning, I'll go down to the police and see what I can do. - Thank you, Nick. - Mr. Graham calling, madam. - David, Happy New Year! - David, how are you! Nora, nice to see you. Thank heaven you two are back. Selma, how are you, dear? Any word yet? - I'll tell you what. - What? Let's take David and sneak out. We'll go somewhere and celebrate the New Year. Hey, that's a good idea! How about it, Selma? Come on, it'll be like old times, when we were all engaged. Yes, before we made any mistakes. What do you mean, ""mistakes""? - I was thinking of Selma. - Come on, Selma. Thanks, I want to stay near the telephone, you know, just in case... You go, David. No, not on your life. I'll stay here with you. Well, then good night, dear. - Try to have a Happy New Year. - Yes. - Happy New Year. - Very Happy New Year, Selma. - Good night, David. - Good night. - Come, we'll say good-bye to the family. - It will be a pleasure. Look what I found. - Iced and everything. - Don't you stay here, David. - You go out and have some fun. - Don't be silly, we can have fun right here. What's the matter with me, anyway? Why haven't I any pride? Why can't I face it? Robert doesn't give a hang about me. Can you indefinitely go on caring for someone who doesn't care for you? Well, it's been done. David, I'm so sorry. I've been such a fool. You really ought to hate me for what I've done to you. Don't talk like that. Look, you get the glasses and I'll try to open this thing... No, we're going out. This is a new year, the time for resolutions. I'm through with Robert, I mean it. I'm going to get my things. We're going to celebrate! We'll start the New Year right. - What is it, Henry? The telephone? Has it... - No, madam, it's Mrs. Forrest. She would like you to join her in the drawing room. All right, Henry. I guess it's no use. - Please go, David. - Now, Selma. No, I'd rather you did, really. I'll go to bed. Dr. Kammer's given me something to make me sleep. All right, I'll go. - Good night, Henry. - Good night. Darling, you will try to find Robert, won't you? - I didn't lose him. - It'll get you in right with Aunt Katherine. - That's what I'm afraid of. - Oh, Nick... - David. What happened? - Selma sent me away, wanted to be alone. I could murder that Robert. Wait till I tell you about the newest thing he pulled on me. He called me several days ago... and told me if I gave him $25,000... he'd clear out and leave Selma for me. - Lovely boy. - What did you say? Well, I didn't know exactly what to say. I asked him to give me several days to think it over. $25,000 is cheap if he'll really go. Why don't you get up a collection? I know a lot of people who would be glad to contribute. Poor girl, it was bad enough with Aunt Katherine and Robert... - now she's got that Dr. Kammer. - Who's Dr. Kammer? I don't know, he's some nut psychologist. Sits around and talks about her dreams by the hour. I get the creeps every time I look at him. Harold, we want to go someplace and get the taste of respectability... - out of our mouths. - Okay, Nick. - I don't think I can go. - David, why not? I've got too much on my mind, I guess. I'm glad you're back, anyway. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year, David. Selma was a fool not to have married him instead of Robert. Well, they all can't be as lucky as you are, darling. What have you got to offer, Harold? There's Tim McCrum's, and there's the Lichee... and there's the Tin Dipper. - Is the Lichee a Chinese restaurant? - Yes'm. - Me no lookee for Robert. - The Lichee. The Lichee. Not now, baby, I gotta make a change. I'll be right back. - Well, make it snappy. - Waiter, bring Mr. Landis another drink. Hello, Dancer. Say, what's the idea? You better not leave that guy. - These shoes are murdering me. - Don't be long. He might get restless. Say, I'm getting pretty fed up with him. You can turn him loose tomorrow. Yeah? Tomorrow's a holiday, the banks will be closed. Yeah, that's right. Well, the day after, what's the difference? Is it worth it? Come on, make it snappy. I'll keep an eye on him. - Polly! Polly! - Sorry, Sonny, I'm busy. - I got a message for you. - Well, what is it? - Your brother's looking for you. - Well, let him look. - So that's the way it is, huh? - Phil, don't try to start anything... - I'm in a hurry. - You've been in a hurry since I got back. Can I help it if I gotta work? That ain't what I'm kickin' about. What's going on with this drunk? - Nothing. - What's this? Give me that. What are you trying to do, drive me nuts? Shut up, or I'll smack you right in the teeth. - I'm in on that, you know. - Now, Phil, after all... - If you don't cut me in, the party's off. - I can't cut you in. - It's yours, ain't it? - Yeah, but... - But what? - Now listen, Phil, don't spoil my makeup... - I got another number to do. - So that's the way it is, eh? You big lug. - Now, how am I gonna explain that? - There are a lot of things... you'll have to explain before I'm through with you. Phil! What are you doing? Shaking her down again? - What's that to you? - Why don't you lay off her for a while? - She's busy. - I know. - What do you know? - A few things that are going on here. Smart boy, eh? You know things. When are you going to start shaking me down? When I want to shake you down... I put up with you because you're Polly's brother, but don't... think you can ride too far on that ticket. Now stay away for a couple of days. My, what big confetti they throw here. Get out of the way, you big clown. - Well, that's more like it. - Too bad we didn't bring Aunt Katherine. - Oh, Mr. Charles. How are you? - Hello, Dancer. Neat way you have of tossing your customers out. His sister works here. I just get tired of him sometimes. - I felt a gun under his left arm. - Just breaking it in for a friend. I want you to meet my partner. This is Lum Kee, Mr. Charles. - And Mrs. Charles. - How do you do? - I'm your friend, you bet you. - You sent his brother up, remember? - Lum Yung? - Oh, yes. He's the one who spread out some tong differences to include a bank stick-up. You bet you. You catch my brother. You play trick on him. No play trick on him, no catch him. You bet you. Is he still in? You bet you. For five years more. Excuse, please. Is he a gunman, too? No, but you never can tell how close brothers are. - Thought you might like to know. - Thanks. He's a great guy to have liking you. This way, Mrs. Charles. - Many customers tonight? - Oh, yes. We always do a pretty good business, you know. Follow me. - Oh, Nickie, there's Robert! - Yes, I know. Why didn't you tell me? - Why, Robert! Where have you been? - Well, fancy meeting you here. Why haven't you sent any word to Selma? She's almost crazy with worry. She ought to know better by now. - Nicholas! - How's it coming? Fine, up till now. Sorry I can't ask you to sit down. That's all right. I'll ask her. Nora, won't you sit down? So, she sent the great big detective to find me. I have a table for you across the room, Mr. Charles. I think you'll be more comfortable there. I'm sure they would. I'll be over in just a minute. Thanks. Why don't you call Selma and tell her you're all right? - Well, don't exaggerate, just call her. - You can tell her... when you go back to report on me. Tell her I'm having a swell time. I'm not going back unless I have to. And I don't think I'll have to. I'll be delighted to tell her that. Well, you'll forgive us... if we tear ourselves away? Dancer seems a bit anxious. Hello, Handsome. Is he a friend of yours? On the contrary, a relation. He's been hanging around here for three days, drunk. Got a case on our prima donna. I wish you'd toss him out. His wife's going crazy. That's too bad. I'll speak to his girlfriend. - Well, I've done my duty. - I wonder what's up? - Up where? - Up there. - Where? - There, and it comes out here. Scotch. Probably. - His relatives just blew in. - What'll we do? Give the customers one more song and knock off for the night. Take him to your place and keep him there. Okay. - Nickie, what time is it? - It's 11:35. - And our first New Year's alone. - Hello, Nick. Maybe I was wrong. - Hello, Joe. - Hello. Excuse me, lady. Say, Nick, Willie the Weeper's outside, see? - When did he get out? - He got out this morning. He's on parole. According to rules and regulations he ought to be mingling... with some respectable people, see? I thought you had a nice table here, see? Maybe... - By all means. - That's fine, you're a gent! Hey, boys! - Everything all right, Mrs. Charles? - Everything's all something. You needn't worry about Mr. Landis. Polly's going to see he gets home all right. - Thank you. - Waiter, no check for this table. - Anything they want is on the house. - Yes, sir. - I can't let you do that, see? - But I insist. You're my guest. Come on, boys. This'll mean a lot to Willie, see? - New Year's Eve and everything, see? - All right, if you insist. It's mighty white of you. Meet the rest of my party. - How are you? - Gentlemen, be seated. - This is Willie. You remember Willie. - How are you? Glad to see you. Likewise. I am honored to be at your coming out party. - Nora, this is Willie the Weeper. - Delighted. Likewise. - And the boys. - How are you? How do you do? - Do you boys know Dancer? - I don't want to know him. He's a crumb. Don't say that, boys. He's giving the party. - Everything's on the house. - Yeah? - That right? - That's different. Why didn't you say so? - Drinks and everything? - Sure. - Champagne, boys. - Me, too. Sure, champagne. Willie? - Scotch, with a champagne chaser. - Likewise. Well, what do you say? It wouldn't take much to make me leave this town for good. We could have a lot of fun on $25,000. What's the use talking about that? You haven't got it. Don't worry, I'll get it. - When did he say he'd let you know? - Tomorrow. There's my number. I gotta go on. Listen, go and call him now. Don't let anybody hear you. If he says he'll give it to you tonight... I'll blow with you right away. We got time for one more song, folks, before the New Year. Miss Polly Byrnes will sing a new number for you, Smoke Dreams. - Where's he going? - Getting his hat and coat. Say, get me mine, will you? Boy, you can certainly pick them. I never seen such a guy. Every time I meet him he's got another good-looking gal. - We haven't met for years. - Oh? When he gives you the sack, let me know, will you? I certainly will. - She's hot looking, ain't she? - Shut up, you lug. It's his wife. See? - Have you made up your mind? - All right, I'll give you the money. Tonight? I can't give it to you tonight. I have some bonds that I was... Of course they're negotiable. Now, wait a minute. Just a minute. That's a lot of money. How do I know you'll keep your promise? How do I know you'll really stay away? And, even if... Selma does decide to get a divorce, how do I know you won't fight it? All right, forget about it. I'll go on home. Selma will be tickled to death to see me. I'm at the Lichee Club. All right, I'll meet you there in a couple of minutes. Don't keep me waiting, though. I might change my mind. You know, it's all to the good, them seeing him here plastered. But we can't take a chance on them tipping off his wife and having her bang in. - Make it snappy. - Okay. We want Polly! Where's Polly? We want Polly. We want Polly, see? We come here and spend all this dough, and what does she do? She sings one song and quits. Now, boys, she had to run along. - Thanks. - Glad to be of service. That's what you get for coming to a dapper joint like this. Do you think she'll really take him home? She'll take him somewhere, I'm sure. What do you mean? Did I ever tell you that you're the most fascinating woman... this side of the Rockies? Wait till you see me on the other side. I said to him, "" You ain't gonna give me a ticket, you big flatfoot... ""and you know it,"" I said. "" I got the right to turn there, you know it,"" I said. ""I ain't got all night to be sitting here gassing. Go polish your buttons... ""leave me be on my way, you fat palooka,"" I said. I know, and then you busted our plan. All right, thank you, Mr. Galahad. You'll keep your promise? You don't mind if I go home for 10 minutes? - What for? - Don't worry... I won't see your precious Selma. I just want to get some clothes. Ten minutes shouldn't matter to a man who's waited as long as you have. Well, ta-ta. I'm worried. I'm going to phone and see if Robert got home. I don't care whose wife she is. I don't like a dame that gets noisy after she's had a few snifters. - Don't you think I'd better? - All right. But hurry, it's almost 12:00. I'll be right back. Here, get on that phone and stay on it, hurry. Well, that settles that. Never mind, they don't answer. I told her to take him straight to her place. Mr. Landis? Yeah. I wanted her to get him in shape so he could go home. Mr. Landis on phone. I hear him say he go home. He did? Good. He's a relative of Mr. Charles. I felt sort of responsible. I think I'll go out and get some fresh air in one of my lungs. Back in a minute. Robert? Hello, Selma. - How are you? - Where have you been? Why do you do these things? I've been going crazy. - There, there, darling. - No, I won't this time. I won't forgive you. You're not going to make a fool of me again. All right, darling. I only came for a moment to get some clothes. - Where are you going? - A little trip. No, you're not. I won't have it. I won't! Want to kiss me goodbye, darling? Thank you. Selma, what's happened? He was going away and I tried to stop him. Now, Selma, listen to me. Now listen. I want you to go back to the house. You've never had a pistol, you understand? You hear me? You've never been out of the house tonight. You don't know anything about this. Understand? Now, come on, hurry. Happy New Year, everybody! Happy New Year's... Oh, excuse me. I guess there must be some mistake. Oh, no. In the dark, and my wife said that she'd be right back... - and of course l... - Oh, yeah? Excuse me. Happy New Year. Happy New Year to you, too. Nora, darling, sugar. Happy New Year. Nickie, you're bleeding. Yes, a little accident. I know, this New Year's traffic is terrible, isn't it? Yes. Have you made any New Year's resolutions? Not yet. Any complaints or suggestions? - A few. - Which? Complaints. - All right, shoot. - You don't scold, you don't nag. - You look far too pretty in the mornings. - All right, I'll remember. Must scold, must nag, mustn't be too pretty in the mornings. Happy New Year, baby. Say, what are you doing here, anyway? Still trying to call Selma. Well, what is it? Come on, I'll find you a phone. Hello, Dancer. Come in. Once a gumheel, always a gumheel. Well, I don't like gumheels. I thought you'd quit it when you married a pot of money. Did he call me a pot? You know I don't like to be critical, Dancer, but... you know, it doesn't look quite right when you and your partner... and your prima donna and your best customer... all go out at the same time. Gives the place a sort of vacant look. Have you ever been thrown out of a place, Mr. Charles? Let's see, how many was it up to yesterday, Mrs. Charles? Well, how many places have you been in, Mr. Charles? Hello, Aunt Katherine? This is Nick... I mean, Nicholas. What? Oh, yes, I will. Well, now, if you're through in here... Polly, another of our travellers, has returned. Now if only... No sooner said than done. Quite a gathering of the clans. I wonder which one of you would be more surprised if Robert Landis... were to walk in here right now. Of course, you know that couldn't happen, don't you, Dancer? I don't know what you're talking about and I don't care. Now get out of here. - What is it, Nick? - Robert's been killed. - Killed? - Get out of here. No, on the contrary. We're going to have a lot more people in. - Give me that phone. - Certainly. - See? - You better go. Selma may need you. Hello, this is Nick Charles speaking... I want to get hold of Lt. Abrams of the Homicide Squad. Why are you calling him? It's a cinch none of us shot Landis. Maybe to explain how you knew he was shot. Hey, what are you doing there? How did Mrs. Landis and her husband get on together? Any fights, any arguments? - No, sir. - Mr. Abrahams... - how dare you question my servants? - Lady, a man's been killed. - I got to find out who did it. - Surely, you don't think... How do I know what to think if nobody will tell me anything? Did you hear anyone leave the house after Mr. Landis left? Certainly not. - Will you please let him talk? - Mr. Abrahams... My name is Lt. Abrams. Well? No, sir. - All right, I'll see you all later. - Obviously just a holdup. A holdup? With that bracelet and those bonds left on him? Henry, will you show Lt. Abrahamson out? Lady, I'm not going until I see Mrs. Landis. Now look, I can't help it if you don't like me. I'm just doing my duty. I tell you Mrs. Landis cannot see anyone. - She's under the care of a doctor. - What's the doctor's name? Dr. Kammer. - Dr. Adolph Kammer? - Yes. - So that's the way it is. - Precisely. I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Lt. Abrams. Okay, Doc. You're willing to take the responsibility of not letting me talk to her? Sir, it's not a question of responsibility. Mrs. Landis has had a very great shock. It was necessary to give her something to quiet her nerves. - Can she talk to you in her sleep? - When'll she be awake? Not for some hours. Do you often have to give Mrs. Landis things to quiet her? Okay, Doc. Check that off. - Then is she crazy? - You're insulting. Lady, I've seen this guy three times in my life... and all three times he was on a witness stand testifying that someone was nuts. First there was that Mrs. Jerris. Then, the Darrow woman. - By golly, she shot her husband, too. - Too? What right have you to say a thing like that? In view of that very definite accusation, I think that you should... insist that your attorney is present at any future interviews with the police. Anybody's tongue is liable to slip. Lt. Abrams, hurry... Nick's waiting for you down at the Lichee Club. He's got them all there. What's happened? - He knows. He'll tell you everything. - I hope somebody can tell me something. - Where's Selma? - She's sleeping. She's not to be disturbed. I won't disturb her. But I want to be there when she wakes up. Well? I don't think that as yet there is any reason for alarm. Selma? They're going to arrest me. They're going to arrest me, aren't they? - No. Of course they're not, dear. - They all believe I did it. Aunt Katherine, the doctor, all of them. - No, Selma, they don't think that at all. - I heard them. I know. - Now, darling. - But I didn't kill him. I didn't. I'm sure I didn't. - You'll help me, won't you, Nora? - Why, of course, darling. But you'd better lie down now and get some rest. They gave me some pills, but I didn't take them. - You should have, dear. You need to sleep. - No, I can't. I can't. - I've got to think. David. - What about David? He thinks so, too. - He must think so or he wouldn't have... - He wouldn't have what? Oh, nothing. You tell him I didn't. - Tell him I didn't do it. - Darling, couldn't you telephone? No. Someone might be listening. No, you go to him. - Tell him I didn't do it. Hurry! - All right, I will. This is your news reporter speaking. The old year was hardly out when death... struck savagely in the slaying of Robert Landis, wealthy society playboy. Mystery surrounds the shooting... It's I, Nora. Hello. This is a surprise. Is Nick with you? What's the matter? Just let me sit down. Don't you know what's happened? No, what? Well, first, Robert was killed. - He was killed? - We saw him at the... David, look! That's the brother of the girl who was with Robert! Don't let him get away, he might know something. I'll get him as he comes out the alley. Not so fast, buddy. Mr. Law speaking. Get inside there. Who you got in there with you? Hey, you. Just a minute, get out of that window. What are you trying to do, make a getaway? - There was someone on the fire escape. - Where is he? - He's gone now. - All right then, come on, let's get going. - This lady is... - I know all about this lady. I've been trailing her ever since she left the Forrest house. Come on. - Where are we going? - We're going to headquarters. There must be some mistake, I'm Mrs. Nick Charles. And I'm Mother Goose! Step on it, girlie, let's go. I've been trying to tell you for the last half hour none of us had anything... Shut up, Dancer. If I want more of your chatter, I'll ask for it. Let her talk. Go on. - I took him home like Dancer told me. - Did you hear a shot? Well, I heard something, like backfire from an automobile. It was foggy and I was too far away to see anything. I thought I'd better get out of the neighborhood... if I didn't want to get into trouble. Why don't you ask her what she was too far away from? From wherever it was it happened. If I hadn't been too far away, I would have known what it was, would I? Well, l... - I give up. - All right, Dancer. Where were you? I went out to get some air. What city ordinance does that break? - I went with him. - Where did you go for all this air? Air pretty much same everywhere. We go in my car. Ride around. - Ask chauffeur. - Riding around? New Year's Eve, the place is jammed and you two are riding around. Hey, where do you think... Just a minute, do you know who I am? I came here to see a client. This is important business. Listen to me. - You can't do this to me. - Hey, lay him down. Hello, Casper. - He's our lawyer. - I knew there'd be some shyster around. - Well, what is this? - Do I know? So a guy comes in and buys a drink. He goes out and somebody kills him. What are we supposed to do? Give customers insurance with the drinks? Not a bad idea. I didn't recognize you, Mr. Charles. Remember me, Floyd Casper? Yes, how are you? Always kidding. Why, Abrams, you don't think that these people would have anything... to do with a thing like that? Why, I've known this lad since... - Save that for the D.A. You got a gun? - Sure. And a permit. You? If you want to take those, we'd like a receipt. Tell that shyster to shut up or you'll go to the Hall of Justice. - On what charges? - Witnesses. They ask them questions. Your clients spend nine-tenths of the time doing it. Take these down and check them with the bullet that killed Landis. - Hold it a minute. You. You got a gun? - No. What did you do with it? I never had one. Nobody has anything, nobody knows anything. All right, go ahead. Miss Byrnes has a brother who has a gun. And my chauffeur tells me that he hung around outside... until just about the time she and Landis left. If he was there, he was hanging around waiting for me. He wouldn't kill Robert, Mr. Charles. He wouldn't have no reason. I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just talking. I think you ought to find him. At least he might give his version... as to why Dancer threw him out. If that rat tries to hang anything on me, I'll... - Leave my brother out of this. - Take it easy. They want to get you at each other's throats. Answer what you wanna and don't let them get you. - I can't stand that shyster. - I was beginning to suspect that. - Did you call me, Nick? - No, not yet, Harold. But you ought to stick around. Outside. It's pretty close in here. Where is this brother of yours that didn't kill anyone? He lives in a hotel on Turk Street. I don't know just where. Don't know much of anything, do you? I honestly don't know which hotel. Phil is always moving. Does he have to move every time he don't kill someone? Don't be so funny! You got me in stitches. Stay where you are, everybody. Get that switch! I'll get it, Nick. Hello. Hello. What? Can't hear you, so much noise going on around here. Headquarters? This is Nick Charles speaking. Take it easy, will you, fellas, I can't hear a thing here. Dancer just got away. Yeah. Tell the boys to pick him up, will you? It's all right, Nick, I got him. Wait a minute, my chauffeur thinks he's got him. The old Gotch toe hold. Hello. No, it's Abrams he's got. Harold, you better let him up, he may not like that. Say, what's the idea? - Take it easy, lady. - Let go of me, will you? What do you think you're doing? Lights went out. You want me to stand out there while Nick might be in trouble? - What was the shooting? - I guess it was me. Did you get him? I thought it was him coming through the door. It was only me in that mirror. And I want... I want to have a description of that brother of yours. What're you picking on Phil for? What about Mrs. Landis killing him? Maybe she found out we was going away together. Maybe she found out about that Graham giving him the bonds. - Don't talk till you get legal advice. - You're their lawyer, not mine! How do I know you won't leave me holding the bag. We're getting somewhere. Pick up Mrs. Landis, doctor or no doctor. - We're going down to headquarters. - You can't do that! What's the idea, anyway? No. All it sounds like to me is they picked up my wife in a man's apartment. - Say it again. - That's it. That's what she says. - I've never seen your wife myself. - Let me talk to him. Graham. David Graham. Hold him? Okay. - Why, this is all crazy, that can't be Nick. - It's him, all right. - Tell him it's Nora. - She says to say it's Nora, Mr. Charles. Nora? No, sounds like a phony to me. Better throw her in the fish tank till I get down there. - Right. - Well? - Throw her in the fish tank. - What? Why... - Throw her in the fish tank. - Why of all the... Will you open this door or will I kick it in? What did I tell you about horning in on somebody else's game? All right, Matron. How do you do? I'd like to get this gal out of the woman's tank. Oh, yes. Is this the one that was doing the fan dance? - Fan dance? - Yes. - If it is, she's been holding out on me. - Hi, there. Say, are you a lawyer? Did Mr. Feinberg send you? Keep quiet! Who are you looking for? Bail us out of here. - Do you see her? - No, I guess she isn't here. Nickie, here I am. Excuse me. Wait a minute. Wait. Excuse me. - What? - Here I am. Well, this is a fine way to start the New Year. Get me out of here. How long has this thing with David been going on? Stop. Get me out of here. I've something to tell you. - About the case? - Yes. I'll get you out on one condition. No more detecting, no more cases. Promise? But this is important. - Never mind. - Nick! - Well? - I promise. - All right, let her out. - Come on, miss. - Are you Mrs. Charles? - Yes. Lt. Abrams wants you for questioning. - Questioning? - Yeah. Don't worry, darling. I'll write to you every day. - Were you and Landis on good terms? - Decidedly not. - On bad terms? - Very bad. - You and Mrs. Landis were once engaged. - That's right. - Until Landis came along? - Yes, sir. Ever ask her to divorce him and marry you? - I may have. But she never said she would. - But you hoped she would... and you thought that with him out of the way she might. - Now look, I didn't kill Robert. - Did I say you did? - But you did pay him to go away. - Yes, I did. Let them in. Will you please sit down, Mrs. Charles. I have to ask your wife a couple of questions, Mr. Charles. I'm sorry. - That's quite all right. - Now, Mrs. Charles... why did you go to Mr. Graham's apartment? - Why... - Perhaps I'd better leave. Why, Selma had a silly idea that David thought she killed Robert. She wanted me to go and tell him that she didn't. Now, wait a minute. I can't imagine her thinking a thing like that. That's ridiculous, I haven't seen her for two days. - Will you come in, Mrs. Landis? - Dear, sit down. David, I didn't want you dragged into this. Mrs. Landis, why did Mr. Graham think you killed... I never said that and I never thought it for a minute. It's all right, David. You have every right to think I did it. He's just trying to protect me. He heard a shot, came running up to me and... Just a minute. What were you doing there? I wanted to make sure that he kept his promise to go away. Okay, go on. He rushed to me and found me standing near Robert with a gun in my hand. But the shot came from around the corner, from in front of me. You mean you didn't... No. Look at the gun, David, it hasn't been fired. Selma, forgive me. It's all right, David. Of course I forgive you. Well, that's all settled. Come on, Nora. Goodbye, Lieutenant. Goodbye, all. Now, wait a minute. Maybe, he believes you. He's in love with you. But I got to have something more than that. Where's the gun? - I've got to see that gun, Mrs. Landis. - I haven't got the gun. I gave it to David. David, where's the... - What is it, David? - Selma, I thought you were guilty. I thought I was doing the only thing... I threw the gun away. You threw the gun away? This is the craziest case. But they can find it. I can tell them exactly where I threw it. I'll send divers down for it and... They've got to find it! She don't want that gun back anymore than you do. Swear out a warrant for the arrest of Mrs. Landis on suspicion of murder. - Get some whiskey. - Yes, sir. For both of us. And that goes for you, too. Go on. What did you say? Did you say something about scrambled eggs? No, darling, you must have been dreaming. Are you hungry? No, why? You want some scrambled eggs, dear? - I can fix them for you if you want them. - No, darling, I don't care for any. - Sure? - Really. - Good night, dear. - Good night. After all, if I want scrambled eggs I can get them for myself. Of course, I'm not as good a cook as you are. Don't bother about me. You go right on sleeping, darling. I love to watch you sleep. You look so cute. Nickie, have you any pictures of yourself taken as a baby? - No. - That's a shame. I want to see what you looked like. I'll have some taken in the morning. Poor Selma, poor David. Nickie, can you reach the water? Can you reach the water? No, I just... I don't want it. I just wanted to be sure you could reach it. Come on. I'll scramble those eggs. If you can manage the bread, I'll whip you up some scrambled eggs... that'll be a poem. - I'm so glad you're hungry, too. - Here, chase this. No, this. Go get it. Eggs, milk, butter. Now, what's the matter? I'm thinking of poor Selma down in that jail. Don't worry. Tomorrow they'll find the gun... and it won't have been fired and Selma will be set free. A bowl. - Then you don't really think she did it? - No. - Now, where's the salt? - Over there. You're not saying that just to make me happy, are you? You really mean it? - No. - No, what? No pepper. - It's there next to the salt. - Thanks. Then, what? - Yes, I mean it. - Of course you're right. She didn't do it. She couldn't have done it. I don't think I'd kill you if you ran off with another woman. - Well, that's something to look forward to. - I might, though. Do you mind, sugar? - Don't forget to shut the gate. - Nick, what was it? It was a stone. Look, it's got a note tied to it. Silly little woman. I told her to stop writing me. Asta, drop that. Asta, drop that, that's a clue. He thinks we're playing. Nickie, come help me. - Look at him. - Where is he? Over there. - Has he got the N-O-T-E? - Yes. Don't pay any attention to him. Just be nonchalant. - Asta! - Darling, let me, just a moment. Asta. Come here, this minute. Do you hear me? This minute. Never mind me. Get him! Yes. Asta! - Did you get it? - Got the rock. - Nick, he's eating it up! - Asta. Here, look! Pretty rock. Get the pretty rock. Here, boy. Asta, look. See the pretty rock. When he runs after the rock, you grab the paper. Get it, Asta. Get the pretty rock. That's a good doggie. I have it. ""Mr. Charles... ""Phil Byrnes, alias Ralph West... ""is a ex-con... ""and was married to Polly in Topeker... ""three years ago. ""He lives..."" What are we to do, send them an anniversary present? Nickie, phone Abrams. And have him here, keeping us up all night? Don't you see? If Phil is her husband, then he shot Robert... because he found out about him and Polly. Nickie, you must phone. - Just as you say. - Here, you. Bad Asta. You swallowed that address. How could you? And I've been boasting about what a smart dog you were. Just for that, you sleep outside. Nickie? I don't think Mr. Charles wishes to see anyone. You just tell Mr. Charles I'm here, that's all. Good morning, Peters. Mrs. Charles couldn't sleep, so I'm up. - Good morning, Peters. - Good evening, madam. Good evening? Why, it's only 6:30. - Yes, sir. - It's still dark. It's dark again, sir. You slept right through the day. - Was it a nice day? - A dreadful day, madam. The reporters and the police were trying to get up here. - I guess we didn't miss a thing. - Quick, the morning papers. - The morning paper's not out, madam. - Not out yet? - These are the evening papers. - Oh. Here you are. It doesn't seem right, the evening papers with breakfast. If you hadn't wakened me, we'd have slept right through till morning. Mr. Charles, there's one of those policemen outside the door now. - What shall I do about it? - Show him in. He probably wants to question Mrs. Charles again. It doesn't say whether they've found the gun. Oh, I forgot. I'm mad at you. Look at him prancing around with that clue in him! Hello, Mr. Abrams. - Good morning. - Good evening. Yes, good evening. - Will you have some breakfast? - Thanks. I just had dinner. I give up. - Have they found the gun? - No. Oh, Nick. Will you convict her if you don't find it? Maybe I do and maybe I don't. It's what the D.A. Thinks. What about the other guns? Dancer's and Lum Kee's? They're.38s, like he was killed with. But the experts say they're not the guns that did it. $50 will get you $250 that she didn't do it. You'd have to say that, you're family. But that Lichee gang has got the best out in the world. They wouldn't have killed him until they cashed his check. - His check? - I forgot, you didn't hear about that. No. He gave Polly a check for $20,000 yesterday. Robert never had $20,000 in his life. Yes, he did. I went to the bank to see about it. Here it is. His wife put this in his account... just a few days ago. It looks all right. Have you any of his checks? - I got all of his and they're okay. - I want the ones he gave to Polly. Here's the first one for $75. - $75, that's better. - Here's the next one for $100. $100. Going up, huh? Perfect. - Forgery. - Let me have the big check. Let me see. I've never seen a forged check. There you are. - How will you have your eggs? - Where's your phone? - It's on the table between the beds. - I can't see anything! - Where's the rest of this phone? - It's in the drawer. Hey, nice doggie. Will you tell him I just want to use the phone? Now behave yourself, will you? Look out. I don't understand, the signatures look exactly alike to me. - That's just it. - That's just what? Nobody writes this much the same, twice. They traced these signatures from his first check. Hello. Hello, Joe? Go down and pick up that Polly Byrnes for me. Okay. Do you want this thing back in the drawer? No, that's all right. Will you call this bloodhound off, so I can get out? Asta, come here. Don't you know Mr. Abrams is on our side? What's the matter with you on this case? You're losing your grip. Get Dancer yet? He showed up as soon as it was light. Had a story about not wanting to be around when the shooting started. Him without his gun. - What about Phil? Found him? - No. Somebody threw this through our window, last night. - Where's the rest of it? - Asta ate it. - Polly said it was a hotel on Turk Street. - That's right. Say, do you want to give it a try with me? Yes, if you'll give me a few minutes to dress. Yes, you wait downstairs. We'll be right down. Hey, wait a minute. - Where do you get that ""we"" stuff? - I'm coming with you. Not cured yet, huh? Certainly not. Don't worry, darling. I won't be in the way. Why, of course you won't. I just want to make sure. Nick! You dog! Let me out! You stay here in case he tries to make a break. - Is Phil Byrnes in? - We ain't got no Phil Byrnes. - Have you got a Ralph West? - Yes. - Is he in? - I don't know. Any way of finding out? Walk upstairs if you want. Room 212. Get on the back stairs. Telegram for Mr. West. After you, my dear Lieutenant. Dead, all right. Strangled. And beaten up some before the strangling set in. Someone's hair in his hand. Watch out. A pair of spectacles. I'll have the boys phone, we'll give this room a good casing. Here's another.38 for your experts to match up. I guess the heater is his, all right. He's wearing an empty shoulder holster. I guess this is the key to that Byrnes girl's apartment. It's got her number stamped on it. Another good guess would be that Selma Landis didn't do this. Fair enough. But he wasn't killed the way Landis was. Tell me what your laboratory says about that hair and those cheaters. - Okay. Anything else on your mind? - Yes, that key. - Could I borrow it for about an hour? - Sure. How about your skeleton key just for good measure? All right. Say, what are you looking for? I haven't the faintest idea. Just a hunch. This is straight from the feed bag. They just found Phil's body strangled to death. Say, that's tough. Polly's gonna feel bad. Thanks. - Polly in yet? - No. Police here, looking for her. Stall them. Keep them here. I'm going up to her place. I'll be back soon. Get out there. Wait, brother. Say, what is this? Bank Night? Flash news bulletin. A body believed to be that of the janitor was found in a hamper... in the basement of 346 White Street. Police link this murder with the Landis killing. Read all about the big murder! Sorry to have to ask you to come to a place like this, but... Is it Nick? Where is he? Is he hurt? No, he's all right. He's upstairs. I called you here because... we found the janitor's body here. Been dead about 24 hours. Shot near the phone, there. The telephone company tells us that about 7:30 last night, just before he was shot... someone here called up information and asked for Nick Charles' number. Mr. Charles doesn't remember this Pedro Dominguez... - and I thought perhaps you might be... - Pedro Dominguez? He was my father's gardener, about six years ago. - A small man with a mustache? - Yeah, that's the one. Hello? Just a minute. Call for you, Lieutenant. Would you mind going down and taking a look, just to make sure? Certainly not. - Would you take Mrs. Charles... - Right. Hello. Those glasses you found in Phil Byrnes' place are nothing but window pane. The hair is false and the gun is not the one that was used on Landis. You're a great help. Did you find out about the fingerprints in his room? Dancer's, eh? Well, that helps a little. No others? Okay. Get to work on this case. And take a look at the bullet that killed this guy. Thanks. Funny you didn't recognize this Pedro Dominguez. Why, does Nora know him? Yeah, he used to be her father's gardener. Remember him now? Who ever remembers a gardener unless he squirts a hose at you? - Hold this a minute, will you? - What is it? You'll see in a minute. Think Mrs. Landis might know this Pedro? - She might. - And that Aunt Katherine? Possible. What do you think you're doing? There it is. Hold that, will you? Well, what do you know about that? A ladder. Sure. $50 will get you $250 that... it just reaches down to Polly's apartment below. With this left over for good measure when he got there. - Let's try it. - Sure. All right. This end first. How about it? - You're right. - Yeah. What did you find out about the person who was here? Not a thing, not a fingerprint in the room, not a stitch of clothes, nothing. Anything in Pedro's books? Just that someone named Anderson took it a week ago, paid cash in advance. That's all, huh? There's a record of a new lock on the door. Bought it yesterday. Wait a minute, what does the card on the door say? That won't help you much. No, just Anderson. No front name. No Mr., Mrs., or Miss. Isn't that just dandy? - If we found out who took this place... - I took this. - You took what? - I took this picture. I found it in Pedro's apartment. I wanted to show it to you. You see, he was our gardener. These are the servants we had down at father's place. There's Pedro, and Rose... - and there's Annie... - Yes, darling, that's just fine. I'm sure that Lt. Abrams will be very grateful. What do you think we ought to do? Bring them all here. Everyone mixed up in the case. - Let's see what we can get. - You're on. Going to take him tonight? We're going to try. Let's get something to eat. I'm thirsty. How are you going to do it? I don't know. I'm going to look, listen, and pray that somebody makes a slip. Just one slip. - Did you get them all? - They're coming. - Selma. - Take her upstairs. What is it? What does this mean? Darling, don't worry. Nick will fix everything. I wish I were as sure as she is. Figured out anything about the setup here? - A little. - What's your plan? Build up a case against each of them. Throw everything we've got, hard enough to bounce. I'll make it bounce, all right. - Wait a minute. - It's all right, let him in. - Nick, have they found the gun? - Not yet. - Selma's upstairs. - She is? - No talking, now. - It's all right, I'll go up with him. - David. - Now, none of that. No, no siree. What about a few more chairs. I'll keep my eye on them. Sure, Mr. Charles. Busybody. Thank you, Nick. This is outrageous, bringing us to a place like this. Break. That's fine. - They're all here, Miss Forrest just came. - Good. You didn't ask Aunt Katherine? I thought we'd return her hospitality. We owe her something after last night. I'm going to get myself a box seat. Now don't get so fresh! Take your hands off me! All right, I just wanted to see if you had a gun. That's a new name for it. Just wait until you boys ask me to do another benefit for you. All right, inside. Say, is that Mrs. Landis? Yes, would you like to meet her? No, thanks, I've had enough of that family. How are you, Lum? I got restaurant to run, no time for this. If you're worried about the place, I'll have it closed up for you. Dancer... we almost ran into each other earlier this evening. That so? Too bad I missed you. Then it was you. Thanks, I wasn't sure. - Where's Casper? - His phone's out of order. Why don't you send a messenger? What's wrong? Shut up you. Cut out the chatter. Well, Nicholas. I might have known that you were at the bottom of this. Come right in, Aunt Katherine. How much more of this nonsense have I got to endure? We hope this'll be the last. Aunt Katherine, sit over here. Yes. This must be Dr. Kammer. I've heard so much about you, from David. Won't you come in? Sit down, just find a chair. I asked you all down here because... we found another murder had been committed here. He's a man I think you all know. Pedro Dominguez. Pedro, killed? - Yeah, don't you read the papers? - I was in the jug. - What do you know about him? - Nothing. I only saw him a few times when I went to pay my rent. What about you? You're in and out of here, you must've known him. Sure, I know him. So what? And you? I never been in this house before. You? I had nothing to do with it. I'm here to attend Mrs. Landis. You're here to answer questions. Did you know him? No. - You knew him, Mrs. Landis? - I knew him? Yes, you remember him, Selma. He used to be our gardener at Ross. David, you remember him? Was he the man with the long, white mustache? - Yes, what did you know about him? - Nothing. That was six years ago. I haven't seen him since. What about you? I can't see what possible connection this can have with us. You don't? Well, I'll tell you. Pedro and Robert Landis were both shot with the same gun. Some monkey business was going on here that we want to find out about. You tell her, Mr. Charles. Yes, with pleasure. It seems that one week ago... Pedro rented this apartment to someone calling himself, or herself... Anderson. - Did you ever see this Anderson? - No. - Ever hear him up here above you? - No. I thought not. He was rather clever and ingenious, this Anderson. Always wore gloves, never left a fingerprint. He intended, with the aid of this ladder... to crawl down into your place some night and polish Robert off with this. Then he was going to climb back up here, unscrew the ladder... throw that out the window on a dump heap down below. Then walk quietly out leaving you holding the bag for Robert's murder. Do you know anyone who thinks enough of you to do that? Why, no. - You're Dancer's girl, aren't you? - I work for him. That's not what he asked you. Well, we got an understanding. Did Dancer know you were going away with Robert? Why... Go on, you told us before. You promised you'd keep that a secret. I'll never trust a cop again. Now listen, if you've made a dicker with the cops, okay. But that ladder stuff's a lot of malarkey. No one did come down that ladder, and Landis wasn't killed in her place. The only reason he wasn't killed in her place... was that Anderson was found out. Pedro came in here yesterday to lay a new rug. He didn't like the looks of things, so he changed the lock on the door. When Anderson came in, he found that he was locked out. Then he heard Pedro telephoning me downstairs. - And he shot him. - So what? So, who is Anderson? I'll bite, who? - Polly, Phil had a key to your apartment. - Yes. - And so had Dancer. - Yeah. - What about Lum? - No, of course not. - Anybody else? - Nobody. What do you think I do, go around stuffing them under doors? He's trying to hang this murder on us to protect his family. If the janitor didn't think everything was okay, why didn't he call the cops? Why does he call you? Because it's a family affair. She knocked her husband off. Everyone knows that. - I didn't. - Yes, you did. Then you got that lug to throw away your gun. - It isn't true. - That's a lie. - Now, Mrs. Landis. - Mrs. Landis. You knew your husband and Polly were friends, didn't you? - No. - But you knew there was a woman. - Yes. - You knew this Pedro? Lieutenant, suppose we take up this check business. Wait a minute. Who's doing this, you or me? - It never has been my party. - Maybe this guy is right. How do I know? - Were you ever in this room before? - No. What about you? Of course not. - What do you think... - I'll tell you what I think. She had this room and you knew about it. You knew she was going to kill her husband. You had Dr. Kammer... all ready for the nut alibi. I attended Mrs. Landis just to make sure she didn't do anything desperate. Mrs. Landis' mind is not balanced. That isn't true! There's nothing wrong with her. You're trying to drive her crazy. There's another mental case right there. Break it up, boys, break it up! Nickie! Nickie! Hey, what's the idea? This way, darling. Darling, you have the nicest relatives and friends. - Mr. Charles! - Yes? Don't walk off and leave me with this bunch. I wouldn't have said what I had if I hadn't been a bit punchy. This gang has got me nuts. - Go on, Nickie, it's just getting good. - Attagirl. All right, darling. Let me know when you've had enough. Now take it easy. Well, suppose we all go about this thing quietly. Dancer... there you are. You know, that check of Robert's for $20,000 was a forgery. - So, what's it to me? - It was traced from another check. I still say, so what's it to me? Just a minute, Lieutenant. We'll handle it differently. Selma, did you deposit that check for $20,000 to his account a few days ago? - No. - Yes, you did, Selma. I remember your telling me. Did you, Selma? Yes, I think perhaps I did. I must have. You think Robert forged her signature and you're trying to hush it up, aren't you? - Aren't you? - No. For years you've paid to hush up his scandals. Don't you see that's just what they're counting on? Selma, is that the vanity case they sent you? Yes. And when you returned it, you sent a note along with it. Yes. You took a signature of that note... traced it on this check and deposited it to Robert's account. Then you forged Robert's signature to the other checks... and had Polly keep him busy until you cashed them. Then I suppose I knock him off and stir up all this fuss before I get the dough. What kind of a stumblebum does that make me out to be? You're the stumblebum that left your fingerprints... all over the room when you killed Phil Byrnes. - Phil's dead? - Yes, strangled. - I didn't do it. - Why did you go to his place? Because I thought he'd gummed my game. I figured he'd tried to hold up Landis and had to kill him. I pushed him around a bit just to learn him manners. Phooey! When I left him he had a split lip and couple of dents in him... but he was just as much alive as you are. If that means anything. Just a minute, Lieutenant. Polly, who knew that Phil was your husband? - What? - You were married, weren't you? Yeah. - So Phil was your husband? - As if you didn't know. I didn't know it until now. I wish I had, baby. Didn't you ever tell anyone that you were married? - No. - Would Phil have told? No. He knew if Dancer heard, I'd lose my job. - Did you and Phil ever talk about it? - Yeah. One night last week. But nobody could have heard. We were alone, down in my room. With these earphones... Anderson could hear everything that went on in your place. - Everything? - Everything. Holy smoke! He knew more about all of you than you know yourselves. Dancer, you went to Phil's room... right after you pulled the switch at the Lichee, didn't you? - Yes. - That was about 1:00. - What time was Phil killed? - About 4:00, near as we can figure. At 4:30, Anderson threw this note through my window. He was beginning to make use of the information he got while he was here. Dancer, how do you spell married? Get Casper on the phone. We'll pass that. Polly, how do you spell married? M-A-R... M-A-double-R-Y-E-D. Thank you. When it comes to words like that... - an illiterate person... - What do you mean illiterate? My father and mother were married right here in the City Hall. - Having a good time, Mrs. Charles? - It couldn't be better. This note is a poor attempt at illiteracy. The easy words are spelled wrong, and the tough ones are spelled right. Like to see it, Lum? That was meant just to get me down to Phil's place, to find his body. And your fingerprints, Dancer. Somebody's framing you. - You say you don't know this Pedro? - No. There's a picture of him over here. Perhaps this will refresh your memory. Were you in on this check business? - I know nothing about it. - You lie. You were here with those earphones on listening to everything. You were sore because they weren't cutting you in on it. You followed Landis that night and tried to stick him up. But something went wrong, and you had to kill him. I do not kill Pedro. I do not follow Mr. Landis. Ask Dancer. - I go with him to get air. - So you're the one that's framing me? You weren't with me. You can't use me for an alibi. You dirty... Wait! Just a minute, please. All this time I've been waiting for someone to make a slip. Someone has made it. We've been wrong. This wasn't a killing for money. It was a murder of hatred, of revenge. Polly, what did Phil go to the pen for? - Blackmail. - Blackmail. Did you and Phil talk about that, too, down below? Yes. Thank you. David, when were you supposed to give Robert the money to go away? This morning. - In cash? - Yes. When he decided to go last night, you had to give him bonds? Yes, that's right, Nick. But where did you expect to get cash on New Year's Day? A bank holiday? - I forgot about that. - No, you didn't, David. You never intended to give Robert that money. You didn't want him to go away, you wanted to kill him. You wanted to get even because he took Selma away from you. Nick, please. Nora, is he fooling? Oh, no. But you were fooling, David, when you said... that you hadn't seen Pedro in six years. You said that he had a long, white mustache. Well, he has a long, white mustache now, but look at that picture. There he is six years ago, and his mustache is neither long nor white. You didn't notice him six years ago, any more than I did. You remember him as you saw him last night when you shot him. You killed him and then you killed Robert. Phil saw you do that... that's why he followed you, that's why he was on your fire escape. He was going to blackmail you, so you killed him, too. Then you threw that note in at my window hoping to throw me off your trail. David, don't let him say those terrible things! Tell him it isn't true. Tell him it isn't true. Ask him why he threw your gun away, Selma. He knew that it hadn't been fired. You'd only have to show it to prove your innocence. Yet he threw it away. Ask him why. David, say you didn't do it. Wasn't it because you hated her as much as you did Robert? Wasn't it because you wanted to get even with her, too? Because you wanted to see her hang for Robert's murder? Oh, David. Tell her the truth now, David. You don't have to pretend any more. All right, it's true, every word of it. I've hated her, hated them both ever since she threw me over for Robert. I've been planning, waiting and watching for the time to come... when I could get even with them for ruining my life. I killed Robert, but not the way I wanted. It was too quick, too easy! I wanted to see him suffer like he'd made me suffer. I wanted to see you hang. I wanted to see you go gradually madder and madder... until the day finally came when you were going to hang! Well, I made a mess out of everything, all right! I don't want a single move out of any one of you. All right, Selma, I may not see you hang... but I'm gonna see you die. Don't be a fool, David. Get out of the way, Nora. Nora, let me go. He will. No jury will hold you responsible. Dr. Kammer was right. I got six bullets in this gun. One for her, one for myself... Yeah, one for myself. And the rest of them for anybody that tries to stop me. Get out of the way! Give me that gun! - Nickie! - Get him out. I'll kill her! Good heavens, I was right. The man is crazy. I can't believe it! David! Well, you certainly can pick them. - Nice work, Abrams, nice work. - Yeah? Come on, Dancer. What for? For about 10 years, for forgery. Not counting that potshot you took at Mr. Charles. - Come on, get out of here. - You, too, sister. - This wasn't my idea... - You were in with him, weren't you? - Yes, but... - You're going to be in with him again. Nickie, are you sure you're all right? I'm afraid so. Nice work, Lum. And you sent his brother up. Sure, Mr. Charles sent him up. Number one detective! I no like my brother. I like his girl. I'm your friend, you bet you! Here's to a very pleasant trip abroad. - Thanks. - London, Paris, Vienna, and points east. Splendid, Dudley, splendid. You're getting better every trip. The telegraph boy at the last station said... there's a lot of telegrams for Mr. Nick Charles. Who's Nick Charles? I never heard of him. - That's what I said. - Fine! - Your room is ready, Ma'am. - Thanks. Well, good night, dear. - Good night, sweet. Sleep well. - Don't worry, I shall. Good night, Nick. And thanks so much for everything. I want to kiss you. May I? Go right ahead. But I warn you, it's a hard habit to get out of. Good night, Selma. Nora. What's the matter, Nick? It isn't true. What isn't true? - Pinch me. - Why? Pinch me. - It is true. - What? We're alone. No family, no friends... no reporters, no police, no nothing. Good. I suppose we ought to decide where we're going. - Why? Do you care? - No. - But I haven't any clothes. - What's the difference? Saves you the trouble of packing. And I don't need anything in the world, darling, but you and a toothbrush. What's that? Looks like a baby's sock. And you call yourself a detective. Why, Mrs. Charles.

""There's a fine line between an outfit and a getup. "" Heh, heh. Where are you right now? You're not shopping, are you? Of course, I deserve it. I was in my office at 6 this morning. I love Saturdays at the office, no one there to distract me. Hey, shouldn't you be on your way here right now? What time is it, anyway? Mary, what are you doing? Are you having sex? Would I be on the phone with you? Don't answer that. I'm on my way upstairs for a manicure. What time is your little do today? Oh, for the third time, 12:30, okay? And do not be late, Sylvie, I need you here. Please, when am I ever late? - Ha. - I'll see you 12:30-ish? No, no, no ""ish. "" No ""ish. "" Hi, welcome to Saks. Would you like to try? - Hello, Ms. Fowler, how have you been? - Aretha needs water. Sparkling or still? Whatever. She drinks out of the toilet. Tanya's ready for you, Ms. Fowler. Are you Tanya? - Yeah, that's me. Have a seat. That's your name? Or are you really Susie from Brooklyn? If it's a long story, don't tell me, I'm in a hurry. I was born Eileen, if you wanna know the truth. I went to this numerologist who said... ...to change my life, I should change my name. I was working at Mr. Ronnie's on Astoria Boulevard. Do you know it? I don't get out to Queens as much as I'd like. The day I changed my name, a limousine pulls up in front of the shop. You're never gonna believe who gets out. Madonna. - I have to be at a luncheon at 1. - Anyway, I can't believe it. I look at her nails, thinking, ""What kind of butcher did this?"" So I gave her a manicure like she's never had in this life. Switch. I use my own polish. I mix my own colors. I have a gift. The luncheon's in Connecticut. That's a whole other state. I put Jungle Red on her. I'll never forget it. Next thing, Saks is calling me saying Madonna's raving about my manicure... ...and do I want a job. - So you wanna try my Jungle Red? - Hmm. Not bad. I put this on one of the girls behind the perfume counter. She just moved to town, bang, she's having an affair with a married man. Who isn't? If you can't speed this up, I'm gonna have to come back. - What's your Wednesday like? - Oh, I'll check. The married-man thing is tricky, isn't it? Especially when the guy's well-known. He's some big hoo-hah on Wall Street. I can never remember that guy's name. Everybody knows him. Wednesday, Wednesday... Haines. That's it, something Haines. It wouldn't, by any chance, be Stephen Haines, would it? Uh, yeah, that's it. Wednesday, 11 or 2? You know, Wednesday isn't good. I think I'd better get this taken care of now. Oh, great, okay. So you're telling me that Stephen Haines is having an affair with a salesgirl? What do you think that's all about? If you ever saw Crystal Allen, you wouldn't have to ask. Yes, buzz, buzz, I hear you. I swear to God, it scares me to come here. I'll be a few minutes. I parked on 78th Street in front of a vacuum-cleaner store. Don't let me forget. - Why would you forget? - I just heard something, Edie. It was very disturbing. I don't know, I almost rear-ended somebody on the way here. April, give Mommy her hat. May, teach June how to braid her hair like Mommy taught you. And, hello, don't we say hi to Aunt Sylvie? - Hi, kids. No way. I don't want to. - They love you, they love you. She scares me. Dora, I'm getting ready to leave. I have a splitting headache. You have aspirin? Sylvie, what did you hear? Where is my purse? Come here, June. - Wait, what's that supposed to be? - Oh, I'm painting now. Painting? Wait, what about the pottery thing? Weren't you taking some puppet-making class? Let me tell you something. Weird crowd of people, the puppet people. I'd go insane living here. I don't know how Alan does it. Oh, Alan moved out. Whoa, what? Oh, it's okay. He's down in a studio on the eighth floor.

Of course I won't tell you. It's too personal. It's about someone we know, isn't it? Mrs. Edie, we're running low on breast milk. Oh, I have the pump in my bag.

I haven't even showered. Did you remember to pick up my dry-cleaning? Yes, I remembered to pick up your dry-cleaning. What is wrong with this picture? How lovely. Thank you. Okay, dog, clean. Bread, flowers and... Oh. Hey, um, do you know where the thing that I made with the whatsits around the edge? - Bowl with the freesias. - Yeah, where is that? Right in front of you. Oh, yeah, I think the tortellini will fit in that. - What do you think, Uta? - Oh, look at this. The face of the Virgin Mary appeared on a rag at a car wash in Los Angeles. It's hard to believe that you were born in a country that hands out the Nobel Prize. That's Sweden. How many times do I have to tell you? I'm Danish. Like the pastry. - Mom, what's going on? - Hey, honey. You're supposed to help me with my book report. Oh, my God, I just completely forgot. - I'm so sorry. - It's due Monday. Yes, but today is the luncheon for the park. I'm co-chair. Which is more important? Some piece of grass or my education? Molly, I don't know why you save these things till the last minute, honestly. - Uta can help you with your book report. - That's her job. Nicole Kidman has cellulite. Where? Let me see. - Oh. I think they drew that in. Let's do it... We'll finish it after the lunch. - No, we can't, I have to finish the... - Sketches. - Sketches which are late. - Then I've to pick up... - Airline tickets. Why do you always save these things for the last minute? Molly Jane Haines, is that any way to talk to your mother? Chocolate macadamia cookies. No, that's like five points. - Since when are you counting calories? - Since I'm fat. Since you're fat? Oh, honey, you're not fat, you're perfect. I'll just do the book report myself. - Now, go take a shower. - Oh, yeah. She thinks she's fat. Oh, your father called. He wants you to have lunch with him when you come back from your vacation. My father wants to have lunch with me? Don't remember the last time he wanted to. He said it was important. Oh, Maggie, I think I know what this is about. I think he's getting ready to hand me the business. - Know how long I've been waiting? - Years, you've been waiting. - Just years. - Years. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Oh. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, off, off, off. Molly, how many times have I told you, no dogs on the bed? Lucy, off. Go on. - Hey, Mom? - Yeah. How come you design clothes you wouldn't be caught dead in? That's what your grandfather manufactures. Those are his customers, but they're not gonna be mine. What's this? That is a travel coffee filter. Here they come. The population of Salem has just dropped. All right, all right, keep your Wonderbras on. It's just a mess now.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, here. Maggie, Maggie, can you please put this in the refrigerator for me? I'll put it right next to the 2-percent. Okay, thank you. Oh, my God. I can't believe you're here.

Natasha's a supermodel. I hate that word. Do not call me that. It objectifies me. I'm a person, not an accessory. Okay, fine. You're not a purse. I'm gonna go and get something to drink. Don't talk about me. She just finished anger management. Well, what does she have to be angry about? - She's hungry. - Oh. When are you just gonna settle down with someone who's right for you? Like a man? Please. You know that I accept you as my gay friend. Thank you. But all of a sudden, half the world is gay. Explain that. You just don't understand how much better it is... ...being in a relationship with a woman. If we're lost, we both ask for directions. When we watch TV, we watch one show at a time. Nobody drinks out of the milk carton or asks you to pull their finger... ...or obsesses over their decreasing ability to piss 30 feet. - And when we have sex... - Oh, no, my... - neither one of us wants it with the lights on. Are you jealous yet? Hey, you owe me a hundred bucks to have my car detailed, okay? And tell me, Dorothy Parker... ...how much longer am I gonna have to wait for your second book, huh? I'd like to print an excerpt before I'm dead. You see, you don't just dash off a book full of sharply observed, hilarious... ...yet deeply intelligent essays, to quote The New York Times. Yeah, that was six years ago. Let's get on with it, huh? She's a little distracted. Did you see her date? Hm. So is Mary in here? It's just so generous of you to open your gorgeous home for Central Park. Your mother was chair of the women's committee for many years. Yes, and it's very important to her that I carry on the tradition. - And me, of course. - Well, of course. I don't know how you manage things in your life... ...and still make time for your charitable work. - Oh, well, pharmaceuticals. - Oh, heh, heh, yeah. Oh, yeah. There's a champagne buffet out on the lawn. Barbara, please help yourself. - Oh, amazing, you're here on time. - Hey, what do you mean? I'm always on time. You're the one who's late. Will you put that thing away? So impressive turnout. Congrats. - Well, thanks for opening up your Rolodex. - Hey, what are best friends for? - What's wrong? Nothing. - What's wrong? Nothing. - Why are you asking? - You looked at me funny. - What's going on? - Nothing. Yeah, something. Your eyes just shifted. - You're not telling me something. - I tell you everything. And what's with you, and your tense shoulders up to your ears? Oh. Okay, I wasn't gonna say anything... ...but I think my father's getting ready to hand me the, uh... - Business? - Yes. - Wow. Is that a good thing? - Of course, yes, it's a great thing. It's a fantastic thing, it's just a lot to take on. I have to talk to Stephen. He's not gonna be thrilled. Stephen, right. So where is he on a Saturday afternoon? The office, where he has been almost every day and night... ...for the last month, working on some hedge fund. Hmm. - Really? Ahem. - Yeah, but in 24 hours... ...we are gonna be sipping cappuccino at the Piazza San Marco. - Are you sure you're all right? - I'm fine. I'm just kind of hungry. I'll get something to eat. - Oh. Oh. - Oh. - No, that's okay. - Lucy. - Take this. - Oh, no. You have to. You can come work for me. - Oh, my. - Take the card. - No, I won't do it. - Please take the card, sweetheart. Take it. No carbohydrates at all, which is fine... ...because the human body does not need them. - Hey, cute dress. Thanks. Cool shades. - There you go. - Thanks. Cheers. Edie, that's a lot of food. Where are you putting it? Well, I might as well tell you. You'll find out soon enough. I'm eating for two. - Aw. For crying out loud, Edie, jeez. - Oh, my God. - Don't you ever say no? - How many kids do you need? - What's happening? - Edie's knocked up again. Oof. Ugh. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. - I wanna keep going until I get a boy. - Don't we have enough of those? You know what? You two don't understand. There's absolutely nothing more thrilling... ...than knowing that you're actually growing a human being inside of you. Right, Mary? Well, you know, I was going through some junk... ...in the attic the other day, and I saw this box labeled ""jars. "" Yes, I am a jar saver. And I open up the box, anyway, and I look in there, and it's not jars. It's just a whole pile of Molly's baby clothes. I just picked up one of those little rompers, I could just feel the tug on my uterus, so... What are you saying? You're thinking about having another baby? I don't know, you know. I'd never thought about having more than one, but lately... Maybe since I know the gate's closing, I don't know. - What? - Nothing. Something. I've gotta pee. For the 10th time today. I'll be right back. - Edie. - What, uh, are you doing? I wasn't gonna say anything, but now I have to. Mary is like my sister. I told you, Sylvie, I don't wanna know. Oh, it's about Mary? - This is in the vault, right? - Vault. - Stephen is having an affair. - Oh, my God. How do you know? The new manicurist at Saks told me. He's fooling around with some woman who works behind the perfume counter. - The spritzer girl? - Yeah, can you believe that? What do you think she sells? Chanel No. Shit? So, what are you saying? You wanna tell Mary? Of course not, but she's talking about having another baby. Oh, this is very dangerous, Sylvie. What if the story isn't true? How much can you trust a manicurist? Oh, they know everything. Manicurists and florists. It's frightening how much information those people are carrying. I don't think we should say anything. It could come back to haunt us. - The affair could be over for all we know. - True. Besides, I don't know anyone who's gotten into trouble... ...for keeping their mouth shut. I mean, I know things about my friends. And I mean, things. Me too. - Cheap hand towels. - Let's go. Right. Oh. I forgot to pee. Hey! - Oh, no. - Thank you so much. - Oh, everything was wonderful, Mary. I must have the name of your caterer, so yummy. Oh. No, I made everything myself. I think people appreciate the personal touch. You cooked? Oh, Mary, how could you? What were you thinking? Now we'll all have to do that. And not all of us are you. Anyway, congratulations on a successful event. Phone for you. It's him. Bye. Bye. Hey, honey, they're almost gone. It's safe to come home. Since we're leaving in the morning tomorrow... ...let's just eat out, and... Stephen? Ste... Stephen, it took forever to plan this trip... ...and we both really need a vacation. Yeah, no, there has to be some way. All right. Okay, I'll call the travel agent. I guess, uh, Venice will still be there. When are you coming home? Oh, okay, then I won't wait up. All right, bye. That goddamn office is sucking the life out of him. - Well, something definitely is. - Sylvie. Come on. - We didn't mean to be listening in. No, no, it's okay. Thank you so much for coming. It meant a lot to me. Are you gonna be okay? I would stay, but we carpooled. I'm so sorry, I've got the little ones at home. No, no, I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine. Okay. Goddamn it. Ned, you gotta back me on this. It's time to stop talking down to our readers. That's the way CACHET is gonna distinguish itself. You talk about branding the magazine. How about we become the thinking woman's fashion book? Bring on the provocative writers. We stop putting little Hollywood twits on the cover. Yes, I know the twits sell, but, Ned, you hired me for a reason. Let me do my job. This time next year, you'll look like a genius. - Mary's on three. - Uh, Ned, I got Ralph Lauren on the line. I gotta go. So how was lunch with Dad? How does it feel to be head of your own design house? - He fired me. What? Yeah, my own father. He said I was spreading myself too thin and that it showed in my work. Excuse me, but designing the perfect little frock... ...for a woman to wear home from hip-replacement surgery... ...is not exactly my work. Oh, honey. Come to my office, the Grey Goose rep was just here. We'll open a bottle and bitch about the men who don't believe in us. What? Is Ned riding you again? Oh, I mean, that's just absolutely absurd. That must feel terrible. - Why doesn't he just trust your vision? - Well, it's a crisis of confidence. I can feel it. I need to pull a couple of great writers onto this magazine, and fast. Well, you can do that. Stop at nothing. I love you, you know that? Whoa. Well, you wouldn't if you saw me. My hair looks terrible. Could you get me into Saks for a haircut? Is that okay? Don't go to Saks. They'll butcher you. Hey! Hey! Wait, what are you talking about? That woman just did the rudest thing. Your hair always looks great. - Anyway, love you, mean it, bye. - Mary. Mary? Women. Hello, I'm Mary Haines, and my friend Sylvie Fowler called ahead for me. Yes, she did. We can squeeze you in, but not for an hour. - I'm really sorry. - Oh. Oh. Well, can I get a manicure while I wait? - Let me check. - Okay. Let's see. - Okay, Tanya's had a cancellation. - Great. - First table, straight back. - Okay, thank you. Oh. Okay. Tanya? Tanya? - Hi, they told me to come right back here. - Oh, sure, have a seat. Well, let's have a look. Oh, my, what have we done to ourselves? Oh, I retiled my bathroom. - Seriously? - Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, I was thinking about something neutral. Wanna maybe take a walk on the wild side? - How about this? Jungle Red. - That's a little too much for me. How about this? This is nice. French Fawn, whatever. Okay. What's that perfume you're wearing? - Something my husband gave me. - Oh, where have I smelled that before? I know. That's the same stuff that my friend wears. She works the perfume counter downstairs. Expensive stuff. But she's got expensive taste, that one. - Her name's Crystal Allen. - Who? My friend at the perfume counter. That girl needs a man with money. She's got one now too. Married, though. Narciso Rodriguez is just amazing. The guy she hooked, his picture's always in the business pages. For Crystal, that's like the classifieds for a husband. I can never remember that guy's name. Everyone knows him. - That's a beautiful ring, by the way. - Oh, thank you. On the wrong hand, though. - It's the right hand. My girlfriends gave it to me. We gave each other one. Haines, that's his name. Stephen Haines. I was there when she met him. Oh, boy, what a performance. This Haines guy walks up to the counter... ...serious type, expensive suit, good-looking, little thinning on top... ...and he says he wants to buy some perfume for his wife. ""What type of woman is she?"" Crystal says. He says, ""The kind that smells like soap. "" Which I thought was sweet. But for Crystal, it was a challenge. So then she says, ""Would you prefer something sexier?"" And she runs her eyes up and down him... ...the way a big cat looks at a slow wildebeest. I felt kind of bad for the guy. He didn't stand a chance. So then she picks up the tester bottle of Jezebel... That's the stuff you're wearing. - She sprays it on her wrist and her arm for him to smell... ...he starts sniffing around. I guess he liked it more than he planned. To tell you the truth, I think this was a game for Crystal... ...until he took out his credit card, and then she recognized his name. And then what happened? She really pursued him. Then they just started seeing each other. He takes her for nice dinners, buys her clothes... ...sends her flowers in a vase. - You know, the kind you keep. I don't think that... I don't think that, um... I'm... I just remembered that I have to go somewhere. Oh, I'm so sorry. Was I talking too much again? You know, I just try to entertain my clients when they're sitting here, Mrs? Haines. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so, so sorry, I had no idea. Oh, me and my big mouth. Is there anything I could do...? No, just stop telling that story. I mean it. I'll never mention it again. I promise, I promise, Mrs. Haines. Donna. Good dirt. Oh, my God. Hello, it's Mary for Sylvie again. Is she still in that meeting? Yes, if you could please have her call me as soon as she gets out. Thank you. Am I late? I'm sorry, Mom. I heard what happened. Your father is a real shit. I ordered you a gimlet. I know, you don't drink in the afternoon... ...but you will eventually, so why not start now? You wanna see a bad facelift? Helen Danvers, 2 o'clock. She looks like she's re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. Honey, what can I do? Do you want me to punish Daddy? - Mom, Stephen's having an affair. - What? I can't believe those words came out of my mouth. - That just makes me sick to my stomach. - Who is she, one of your friends? No, she sells perfume at Saks. She's a spritzer girl? I mean, how could I not have known? Three months ago, he bought cowboy boots. I just can't believe this is happening to me. I thought we were happy. - What are you gonna do? - What do you mean? - I'm gonna tell him to move out. - Well, that's not very smart. Someone once said... ...that when you don't know what to do, do nothing. Mom, my husband of 13 years is having an affair. I mean, do they talk about me when they're in bed? Do they laugh at me? Please don't tell me to pretend that nothing happened. You have no idea how this feels. Well, let me try. It feels like someone kicked you in the stomach. It feels like your heart stopped beating. It feels like that dream. You know, the one where you're falling and you want so desperately to wake up... ...before you hit the ground, but it's all out of your control. You can't trust anything anymore. No one is who they say they are. Your life is changed forever. And the only thing to come out of the whole ugly experience... ...is no one will ever be able to break your heart like that again. I can't believe you never told me that. I wanted you to love your father. Jeez, I mean, who was she? Some little skank who sold fabric. I met her once. She wore too much makeup and her bra straps were always showing. - What did you do when you found out? - Nothing. Nothing? I had a smart mother too. Mary, that girl does not mean anything more to Stephen... ...than the fabric whore meant to your father. If he loved her, believe me, you would have felt it. I can't fake it, Mom. I can't be anywhere near him right now. Then this is what I think we should do. It's spring break. We'll go away for a couple of weeks. There is nothing like a heavy dose of a man's mistress... ...to make him miss his wife. What do you think this is, some kind of 1930s movie? That's ridiculous. Can I remind you of something? You have a daughter, just like I did. This is not just about you. Call Stephen. Tell him I invited you and Molly up to the cottage in Maine. We'll leave tomorrow. And I wouldn't discuss this with any of your friends. They'll all want to help, and before you know it... ...you'll be taking care of them instead of yourself. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry for you, baby. But it's nice to know you still need your mama. Was that a sunrise we just saw? Because I'm on the wrong side of that thing. Alex, stop complaining. I just thought Mary could use a few pals to take her to the airport. You know why I don't cultivate friendships? So I don't have to take anyone to the airport. At the next intersection, make a left turn. - Who the hell was that? - The navigation lady. She's always calm. She never talks back. My husband's in love with her. All right, I'm sensing something here. Something's not being said. - What's going on that I don't know about? - Nothing's going on. What would make you say that? Alex, what is your take on Mary and Stephen's marriage? Um... It looks perfect on the outside... ...but there's definitely something going on there. You know Mary doesn't like looking at the cracks. She's too busy filling them. Our girl is all blue sky. But sooner or later... Why? Mary doing somebody? Heh, heh. - What makes you think it's Mary? Edie. - Is Stephen having an affair on Mary? - Oh, for God's sake, Edie. - What a mouth. - I didn't say anything! Is it somebody we know? - Vault? - Vault. - Spritzer girl, Saks. - No. - Oh, my God, how's she taking it? - Oh, she doesn't know. What do you mean, she doesn't know? What is wrong with you two? We're in the vault, she's not? Drag her ass into the vault. Look, I have been struggling with this for days, okay? Mary and I have been best friends since college. - I think she should be told. - Uh, yeah. Or we just don't say anything. Sylvie, Mary has to know, okay? Now, that's the right thing to do. You want me to tell her? Because I'll tell her. I don't have a problem with it. Hi. Hi, I could've taken a cab. No, no, I know you sent, you know, Molly to be with your mom. And why should you go to the airport alone? All right, so you have all the numbers at the house. All the information. - Oh, will you call the vet please, Dr? - I will, Dr. Jones. Oh, and the guy from the place is coming to fix the... - The sink, at 2. Next week, Tuesday at 2. - Okay. That too. Oh, hi. - Hey. What are you guys doing here? - Just get in, okay? - Come on, get in. - No, let's get out. Mary, there's a reason why we are all here with you today. Sylvie has something she wants to talk to you about. This is really hard, Mary, okay? L... Oh, is this about the perfume bitch? You knew and you didn't tell me? Right now, honest to God, Mary, I'm so hurt. - You? - Yeah. This isn't happening to you, this is happening to me. I was trying to figure out how to tell you. I'm not saying I didn't... How can you not tell me? All right, all right, all right! It's out in the open, okay? Fine, what I wanna know is, what did he say when you confronted him? I didn't confront him. He doesn't know I know. - What do you mean? - Mary, that is ridiculous. I'm not proud of it. What are you saying? He's supposed to know that you know. Okay, okay! All right, I appreciate all of you trying to help, I really do. But please, don't dissect and analyze every square inch of this right now. I can't take it. Just be there for me silently. Okay, let's go. I should not be operating heavy machinery right now. - Hey, Mom? - Mm-hm. - You know what'd be really cool? - What? If you and I got mother-and-daughter tattoos. Nice try. Come on, it would change your whole image. What's wrong with my image? Never mind. So I can still get the tattoo, though, right? Yeah, right after I get my nose pierced. How come you never just hear me? I hear you, honey, I hear you. You want a tattoo, and you're not getting one. I'm gonna go watch television. Oh, Mol. Molly, come on, stay out here with us. It's a gorgeous day. Is there anything I'm allowed to do? You know, Mom, I think it's gonna be warm enough this afternoon... ...to go for a swim. I'll have to put on a bathing suit. Men, they can just parade around without a care in the world. At what age do women start covering themselves with tarps... ...just for a stroll on the beach? - Oh, it's Stephen. - Don't answer it. Let him think you're doing something incredibly interesting without him. God, I hate the game-playing. - It does feel good to get some control. - Of course it does. He's called three times a day since we've been here. He's practically begging you to come home. You can see where his heart is. This would be so much easier if I didn't love him. There should be a pill that you can take to make love go away. Why would you wanna make love go away? It's hard enough to find it in the first place. It's Stephen. All right, you can answer it now. Hello? Oh, Stephen. I'm dying to see what she looks like. Okay, listen, Sylvie, I'm just gonna put it on the record. This is a bad idea. We don't have a plan, you don't know... - Oh, my God, would you look at that bag? - So pretty. Sylvie, I need an advance. I am not going to enable you. Finish your damn book. Can I have this bag, Mommy? Mommy, I'm tired of shopping. Can we go? I wanna go. We can't go. Aunt Sylvie is stalking somebody. When she's finished, we can leave. I hate this store! April? I want you to listen to me. I'm gonna say something very important... ...and I want you to remember it for the rest of your life. Nobody hates Saks. Now, let's do what we came here for. Mommy, can we get something to eat? Fragrances, this is Pat. - She's with a customer. I'm hungry. - Can we eat somewhere soon, Mommy? - Oh. I'm starving. Crystal. Phone for you. It's a guy. Wow. - She is fine. - Oh, Jesus, Alex, not now. - We've seen her, now let's get out of here. - Not on your life. Yeah, I'm with Sylvie. Hello? Stephen. I was hoping it was you. How have you been, baby? I missed you this week. Well, it's cruel and unusual punishment to be without you this long. I say we make up for lost time. What if I cook us a romantic dinner tonight? The big white square thing with the fire coming out of it is the stove. Shh. Oh. No, baby, of course. No, no, no, your work comes first. Don't worry. I'll just save you a piece of cake with a candle on it. - Phew. - Huh. Oh, I didn't wanna tell you, because I didn't want you to make a fuss... ...and I'll have other birthdays. I would... No, no, no. I would feel terrible taking you away from important business. Are you sure? Oh, baby, I am one happy girl. Okay, I'll see you at 8. You know where. Mwah. That stupid wife. Ever since she's been gone to wherever, he's been acting like a lost puppy. I have an audition at 4:00. Apparently now I'm cooking dinner. How did this all happen? You volunteered. Oh, sorry, Pat, but I gotta go. Can you find something to do tonight so we can have the apartment? Fine. And good luck on your audition. Uh, excuse me. Can I get some help, please? - I was just leaving, but Pat can help you. - Oh, I was told to ask for Crystal Allen. Ow, give me that. Oh, no, no. - Is that you? - Yeah. I've heard you have a special way of knowing what a customer needs. Really? And where would you hear that? - Around. Pretty. I've been wearing Chanel No. 5 since my christening. I'm thinking of changing. What would you suggest? Hmm. Probably nothing too subtle. You're right about that. You always know exactly where you stand with me. No, I want a perfume to be a reflection of my personality. Smart, fearless, clever, loyal... ...protective of friends, ruthless if crossed. I want that. You shopping for a perfume or writing a personal ad? Ha, ha, ha. A friend of mine is wearing something new. Her husband bought it for her here, I think. Edie, what's the name of that perfume that Mary Haines is wearing? - You know, the one Stephen bought for her. - Ah. Stephen Haines. Maybe you waited on him. He's good-looking, receding hairline. Platinum card. Maybe that rings a bell. Oh, we know you're screwing Stephen, and Mary is a friend of ours, so you stop it. - Just stop it! - Shh. So he cheated on you, and still you said nothing to him? This is not modern, Mary. Ever since I got back from Maine, it's all flowers and foot rubs... ...and, ""What can I do for you today?"" I mean, maybe my mother is right. Maybe the affair was no big deal. Maybe treating it that way actually is the more modern thing. - When did you become French? - I'm not sleeping with him. - Good. Make him suffer. - Sylvie, let's stop talking about me, okay? - How's everything with Gary? - Oh, it's over. He pressed his jeans. - You are too choosy. - No. Yeah, and you know why that is? You're afraid to choose. - No, I am not. - Yes, yes, you are. Excuse me, I chose once, remember? It was all very nice until my career took off. ""Sylvie, I'm happy for you. "" He said, ""I want you to fly. I just don't think I can be with a woman who has that kind of wingspan. "" - That was just him. - Excuse me, no. I'm sorry, men have a hard time being with a successful woman. So we shrink to fit, like you. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, like you were gonna be Donna Karan. And then you put on the brakes because you could eclipse Stephen. When you fall in love, you don't think about how it's gonna work out, Sylvie. - You just go with your gut. - Oh, please. Like my first date with Stephen, when he gave me that pumpkin. Thank God it was Halloween. That was an irresistible thing, to be given a pumpkin on your first date. - That's weird. It was charming, you know. Carving a pumpkin? - We carved it together. We were a really good team. You know, 13 years. Good afternoon, La Perla. - Thirteen pumpkins. That is what you think about when it's all falling apart. It's the pumpkin. The pumpkin matters. I hate Halloween. All those strangers at the door. You know, someday, when you are not looking and you're not thinking, Sylvie... ...you're gonna meet the man you wanna marry. I'm the man I wanna marry. That's the problem. Ooh, hey. Sylvie, what do you think of this? - On you? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. Stephen might get lucky tonight. Mrs. Haines, it's been a while since we've seen you. Time for a new robe? Hello, Grace. I'd like to try this on. - Really? - What is everyone's deal? - What? I think this is your size. All right, I admit that I underestimated the value of the slut factor in the bedroom. Great. Maybe he'll leave some cash on the nightstand. Oh, I just don't understand why they put fluorescent lighting... ...in dressing rooms. Why would a woman buy anything if it looks like her thighs... ...were hit by a meteor shower? How are you doing in there, Ms. Allen? - Do you need another size, another color? Oh, no, I like it. Don't go too far. I'm gonna need you. No problem, Ms. Allen. Okay, wow, is this just too much? I mean... No, it's... I think I'll go out, and just get some other options, huh? Is there a mirror with better light? - Yes. Out here in the hall. But you probably don't wanna go... I'm not shy. Hmm. I've got to say, you're my first customer who's had the courage to try that on. Do you have those cutlet things? - You know, I need some lift. - Oh, yeah. I think I have to take this. How much money is it? It's Italian handmade lace. That's why it's $650. Does it come in any other colors? - Champagne. Ah. I love champagne. I'll take it in a champagne as well. Will that be cash or charge? You take personal checks? No, but I'd be happy to open up a store charge. It only takes a few minutes to do a credit check. Credit check. I don't have time for a credit check. Hey, what if I gave you the number of someone who does have a credit card? And I'm sure if you called him, he'd be happy to give it to you. We can try that. - What's the gentleman's name? - Stephen Haines. He's a friend of the family. Mrs. Haines is a client of ours. In fact, she's in the dressing room right across the hall. Would you like me to have her approve this for you? No. No, no, no. Um, you see, I don't think that would be in very good taste. You see, I'm relatively new in town, and I haven't had the pleasure... ...of meeting Mrs. Haines yet. I would hate for this to be our first introduction. I'm sure you understand. I do understand. - I'll phone Mr. Haines. - Thanks, sweetie. Oh. You don't think it's flattering? - Is that what you're thinking? - Mary. She's here, in the dressing room across the hall. Crystal Allen. What? - How do you know? - I saw her talking to the saleswoman. She's spending a fortune, and, Mary, she's putting it on Stephen's account. Oh, that's not true. If he's paying her bills, Mary, it means he's still involved with her. Well, I'm just gonna go home. Can you just help me out? Are you leaving? - Help me off... Mary, go in there. - Help me off with this thing. You've been running away from this whole thing. - What are you afraid of? - Of being made a bigger fool, Sylvie. Listen to me, that woman is working her way into another person's life... ...and it happens to be yours. And if you don't stand up to her and face her... ...it's a matter of time before she's carving the pumpkin with your daughter. Now, I'm giving you permission to behave badly. You go in there and kick her ass. - Go on. - Okay. - I'll be your cornerman, you just go. - Go. Go. Go on. - You can do it. - Okay, I can't. - Go. - I can't do it. Oh, shit. - Excuse me? - Are you kidding me? - Excuse me? - Are you...? I'm Mary Haines. Right, um. Well, this is awkward. - I guess he finally told you. - No, no, no. He never mentioned you, but I've known about you. - Really? - Yeah. - I'm surprised I haven't heard from you. - Well, it's not my style. But since you were in the vicinity, I thought I'd introduce myself. Um, look, Mrs. Haines, I am really sorry for what this has done to you. And I know Stephen never meant to hurt you. What? You don't know anything about my husband. I do know that a woman never steals another woman's husband. They usually go willingly. Well, it sounds like you have a lot of experience in that area. You know, Stephen is a very smart man. He's just way too smart to take someone like you seriously. I mean... Mrs. Haines, I know so many women like you. You have your fancy friends and your nice houses... ...your calendars are full of social events and shopping dates and charity lunches... ...to make you feel like you're doing something with your lives. But eventually, you stop paying attention to your men. They get lonely. And they come looking for someone who makes them feel appreciated again. And believe me, they take that very, very seriously. You know, I came in here with... ...I admit, just a ridiculous idea that if you and I ever met... ...and you saw that I was an actual human being... ...and not just some stray thought out in Connecticut... ...that you might actually feel a little bit of remorse. One woman having that transcendent moment of connect with another. And that you might realize the scope of the damage that you've done... ...not just to me, but to a family. I have no idea what you just said. I know, yeah. So I'm gonna put this in terms that you can understand. You are gonna stop seeing my husband. I guess that's up to him, isn't it? Listen, let me give you a little bit of a tip. Stephen... Stephen would never like anything that, uh, trashy. Well, if Stephen doesn't like anything I'm wearing, I take it off. You were great, Mary. Get me out of here. Who are you, Stephen? - Tell me, what's going on? - Oh, she is really giving it to him. And he is not saying much, because, really, I mean... ...what could this cheating, lying bastard say? What else? What else? Oh, so they argue some more, and then Mary gets very quiet... ...and she says, ""Stephen, do you wanna be with her?"" - Oh, good move. - Yeah. Force his hand. And he says, ""Mary, I love you. "" Oh, yeah. Oh, please, predictable. But I think Mary started listening to him. So he keeps talking. He says he never meant for the affair to turn into anything. And he tried to end it more than once. Men get themselves into things, then they don't know how to get out of it. But here's where he makes his big mistake. He says he kept seeing Crystal because he felt she got dependent on him. - And that he didn't wanna hurt her. - Hurt her? That's exactly what Mary said, then she makes her big mistake. She says, ""How could you not see that she's just after your money?"" Oh, she blew it. The last thing a man wants to hear is that his wife is the only one stupid enough... ...to love him for himself. Nobody knows how to argue. I should run a school. So now he asks her the big question. Is there any way they can put it all back together again? You should have heard him. It would have broke your heart. Oh, who cares? Do we still have jobs or not? Mary said she wants a divorce. - What did he say? - He says... ...he'd wish she'd take some time and think it over. And that he would spend the night at a hotel. - What did she say? - She threw her wedding band at him. Oh, that's bad. - Oh, that's very bad. - Yeah. Where the hell's my address book? I have a woman who keeps offering me a job. Barbara somebody. What are you doing? You can't desert them now. Oh, my God. Shh. I hear something. That's it. We're on a sinking ship, Uta. I have a cardinal rule. Never get attached to the family. This is exactly why. And that, Uta, is why the revolutionaries threw tea into Boston Harbor. I need to eat something. That's low-fat, low-carb, fat-free... There's fruit everywhere. - Where's the junk? - You don't let me buy any. Why don't I fix you a drink? All right. I think you both should know Stephen and I are splitting up. Yeah, he's been having an affair. - Get out of here. - I don't believe it. Yeah, yeah. And let me tell you how stupid I am, okay? I had myself convinced that it was no big deal. Just a little chapter, not the whole book. And if I just put the old blinders on, rose above it... ...everything would work itself out. Bullshit. I mean, it's not like I was deliriously happy every single day... ...of this marriage, you know? But did I screw around? No. I could have, by the way. I really could have because men have come on to me plenty. All right, once or twice. But I thought about it, because this just in: Thirteen years of sex with the same man can be a little bit boring, all right? I mean, Stephen had his bag of tricks and I knew them all. But did I complain? Did I go out and bang the Federal Express guy? And let me tell you something else. Stephen does not know how good he had it. There is nobody, and I mean nobody, who's gonna give that man... ...a better time in bed than I did. I could suck the nails out of a board, and that is a fact. Oh, God. God. You can't think straight right now. You know what I do when I have a problem? Before I go to sleep, I tell myself I'm gonna wake up with the answer. And that does it. I do. You try it. You go on upstairs and get a good night's sleep. And tomorrow morning, it'll all look better. Oh, Maggie. Go on, you'll feel better. I love you guys. She's not gonna dump him. I know how she feels about that man and how he feels about her. He'll be back in this house by the end of the week. I don't understand. Why did this happen to me? Oh, sweetie, listen. Listen, it happens in every relationship, okay? Eventually, somebody betrays somebody else. It's either in a big way or in a million little ones. It's just the nature of it, okay? Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. - What am I gonna do? - You'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. Come on, we need to pull out the big idea here. We should focus on the cover. How to get it to pop. Okay, what about this for a cover blurb? ""The 45-Minute Orgasm. "" Forty-five minutes? Who has the time? Listen, I really wanna make a statement with this issue. It's time to cut ourselves away from the herd, talk up to the reader. I thought we already were. What about the piece we did on living an authentic life? Oh, come on. We tell women to feel good about themselves... ...and then we print 15 pieces on crazy diets. We run ads for wrinkle creams, the models are 20 years old. - We're driving women mad. - Okay. I know I'm the new kid, but here's what I would do... ...if I were in charge of CACHET. I would tie each issue to a theme. Brand it. By branding each issue, we brand the magazine... ...giving it a more unique identity on the newsstand. I would make sure that each theme had an edge. A sense of humor. For instance, the revenge issue. How to get it, who to stick it to... ...the fine art of holding a grudge. We put an actress on the cover, someone young, hot. And we make the whole thing irresistible. We become the guilty pleasure of the publishing world... ...and that is how we turn it around. Come on, Annie. Revenge? It's so retro. It's old-think. Don't we all have better things to do? It's the opposite of what I'm talking about. But I would buy that magazine. Uh, I think we should take a break, okay? Let all this percolate. We'll pick it up after lunch. Just think about it. It's a good idea. Let me tell you, editors, they live in fear of a girl like that. They walk into your world, you're thinking, ""Wait, am I out of the loop here?"" - I mean, ""Am I missing the trends?"" - Climb higher. - Can't we take a break? - No breaks. What are the two most feared words in English? - ""Pool party. "" - ""Keep climbing. "" Wait a minute. Let me down, okay? Thanks. Hey, Bailey Smith, right? Sylvie Fowler. We met at the MTV Awards. Oh, right, right, right, yeah. So how are things in the hot seat at CACHET? Well, I'm not gonna be happy until I take a nice big chunk out of Vogue. - You know how I'm gonna do that? - How? By putting star writers on the magazine, like you. Oh, well, that is a nice compliment, but I'm not for sale. - I'm really happy at The Post. - Excuse me, but I don't know why. You made a reputation writing brilliant profiles... ...and now you're writing gossip for a tabloid. Wait, I am syndicated. I don't have to worry about money anymore. You know, anyway, I write about people, not fashion. That's what I want you to do. Write about interesting people in your own irreverent way. You'll sell magazines. I hear your circulation's down. And didn't you have some staff defections last week? Some people can't take the hills. You know, um, I would consider doing some pieces for you... ...but I would need something in return. Well, you name it. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, I'm doing a series of columns on high-profile New York marriages. I hear one of them is breaking up. Oh. Oh. - You know who I'm talking about. - I don't know anything. And who cares, anyway? Oh, come on. Messy divorces sell more papers than presidential campaigns. Sounds like you've written a story. What you need me for? You know I need confirmation from some ironclad source. I'm sorry, I can't help you. Just because you wouldn't do a favor for me... ...doesn't mean I won't do one for you. One of my spies said they saw your publisher last night... ...having dinner with Talia Greene from Harper's Bazaar. Wait, I am not worried, okay? Ned wouldn't replace me. He's completely committed to my vision for the magazine. Sure, I'm sure. But it's just that I heard that there was some heavy wooing going on. Bailey, do not print that, okay? What little staff I have left would smell blood. It would completely destroy my credibility at CACHET... ...and then I really am out the door. I know, it's incredible, isn't it, how a little piece of gossip like that... ...has the potential to actually unravel an entire career? Because, really, when you think about it, where would you go if you left CACHET? This is the last time you're picking the restaurant. If they're gonna plaster your life in the paper... ...you would think they would at least run a decent picture. Especially next to that Crystal. Shouldn't she have to have a permit to wear a dress like that? You're awfully quiet for a change. Oh, tough day at work, is all. She's here. - Hi. Hi. - Alex picked the restaurant, right? - Heh, heh, heh. - Of course. - That looks good. So everybody's seen it, right? Okay, no big elephants on the table. Just when you thought it couldn't get any shittier. Okay, do you wanna have a big laugh about it right now, huh? Or you wanna run off with a woman? - Lf you did, this would be the place. - Maybe a margarita and a woman. I like that. I think it's gonna be okay, ladies. She's turned the page. Yeah, I've turned the page. I hired a lawyer today. Mary, um, don't you think maybe it's too soon for lawyers? Let things settle down. A month from now, everything could look different. - What? - I know. Okay, I'm gonna take a risk here and say something that may be... There are two sides to every story. Any one of us is capable, under the right circumstances... ...of making a very big mistake. Right? Right? And a good marriage counselor might ask: ""And how were you culpable in this marriage?"" Well, I married an asshole. That's how I'm culpable. Which side are you on? - I'm not taking sides. Well, pick one. I'm on your side. - My money's on you. - All right. Okay. Here's what I wanna know. I wanna know how somebody like Bailey Smith faces herself in the mirror. I wanna know how somebody can make a living feeding off of somebody else's pain. Mary, it's my fault. Okay. Bailey Smith knew I was about to be fired... ...and she knew that I needed her on the magazine. So she practically blackmailed me. I didn't give her any information. She had all the details already. She just said, ""Nod if it's true. "" And that's all I did, is nod. I was in a terrible position. I was scared. You know, people do terrible things when they're scared. And this is terrible. I know that. I know. What is going on with you? Guys, I'm fighting for a job that I've worked for my whole life. What was it that you said, Sylvie? You said that betrayal is inevitable in any relationship. I thought you were just talking about marriage. This is so much worse. You don't have what it takes to run a company like this. Now, take a walk and never look back. My father will never let you get away with this, Ramona. I'm sleeping with your father. Who knows moisture better than Dove? For God's sakes. Middle of the afternoon. Your daughter's gonna be home from school any minute. You want her to see her mother in her bathrobe again, huh? I don't look at clocks anymore. It's very liberating. Haines residence. Oh. Hello. Heh, heh. Sure, I still recognize your voice. Well, me? Holding down the fort. Uh... I'll see if she's still here. - It's Mr. Haines. He's on the phone. - Oh. Tell him I'm not here. I'm a bad liar. If I were any better, I'd be embezzling from you. I don't wanna talk to him. I'm busy. Okay, look, I'm the housekeeper. I cook, I clean, I run errands and that's it. I'm not your secretary. I'm not your mother. I'm not your pal. I'm not involved. Now, you get over here and take care of your business. Hello, Stephen. I haven't talked to the appraiser. I'll do it next week. Let's go. Get out of here, come on. Oh. Well, I'm sure she'd love to carve a pumpkin with you. Well, thank you for the invitation, but I think you two are... You'd be better off on your own. Because I wouldn't have the first idea how to be around you right now, Stephen. No, I already told you, it's over. No marriage counselor. I'll have Molly call you. Oh, sweetie. Oh, I am so sorry. I didn't mean for you to hear that. Mary, I know you're there. Why won't you return my calls? We have to talk about this. Hey, it's bad form to screen calls, Mary. Pick up. Pick up. - May I help you? - Ahh! What do you think you're doing... ...sneaking up on me like that? What are you doing casing the house like a Jehovah's Witness? I am looking for Mary, okay? I've left her a lot of messages, and she hasn't called me. - She's not here. - Where is she? Out of town. - What about Molly? - Molly is at school. That's where the kids go during the week. Heh, heh. Cute. Are we done? I have a lot to do. Besides, your Pradas are wrecking my perennials. It's Jason. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Ask him if he likes me. No, you. Oh, man. Who's that? One of my mom's friends. - You'd better go. - Okay, well, see you later. See you. Hey. Small world, isn't it? So why aren't you in school? I didn't feel like it today. Huh. So this is kind of a new look for you, huh? I leave the house in my uniform. And then after school, I change into the stuff I hid in my backpack. A lot of the girls do it. Oh. Clever. You wouldn't happen to have a cigarette, would you? Thanks. Hey. - Does your mom know you smoke? - No. And don't tell her. I do it so I won't eat. Your weight is fine. I hate my body. I wanna look like the models in your magazine. Nobody looks like those girls, okay? Not even them. They're all airbrushed and retouched. Then why don't you just put regular people in there? I know it's hypocritical. Life is complicated. Yeah, I'm just starting to figure that out. Do you wanna talk about it? No. Okay. How old were you when you had sex? Thirty. It was horrible. It hurt like hell. And it was totally embarrassing... ...because we had no idea what we were doing. We were up in his room one night. Big Farrah Fawcett poster staring down on the bed. Star Wars sheets, it was... It was just tragic. I didn't have sex again for a really long time. But then I met somebody, and it was worth the wait. We were crazy for each other. And then magically, and it was all really easy. Basically, you're telling me exactly what my mother would say... ...if I could even ask her. Don't have sex until you're in love. No. No, I've had pretty great sex just for the hell of it. I won't lie to you. But there's no sex like the kind you have when you love somebody... ...and they love you back. You'd make the coolest mother. Really? No, I wouldn't. Really? I don't know, kids don't seem to take to me. You'd be a great mom. Not like mine. I can be in the same room with her, and it's like she's not even there. Listen to me, Molly. I know you're going through a tough time. And if there's anything you ever wanna talk about, just call me, okay? Promise you'll call me. Tell me you promise. I promise. Okay. So where is your mom, anyway? All right, everyone, take a deep, cleansing breath. Look around. Respect the power of nature. This is why you have come to the Camp. Let it heal you. So divorce? How many? Hold on, I'm coming. Don't start without me. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm just not used to getting up at the crack of frigging dawn. Excuse my French. Is this the time you always start? Because I'm pretty sure the lake will still be here at noon. We always canoe at dawn. I always fake my orgasms. That doesn't make it right. Let's go. Lift. Swing. - Hoist. Oh, God. You've got to be kidding. Turn. March. Oh, please. God. - Forget it. - Oh! I already tried it. Oh, you scared me. And how bad an idea was this in a place with a padlocked refrigerator? Leah, right? Right. Mary. I mean, I am just so hungry. I'm starving. You need the Hubble Telescope to see what they put on our plate. This place makes Betty Ford look like Disneyland. And I ought to know. I ran screaming out of Betty twice. Look at that. Oh, no. No, thank you. How did you get that in here? They even took away my Altoids. I made friends with Buck, the ranger boy. Another... Guess what. - Aspiring actor. I thought I had left them all behind in la-la land. You know, where your dentist is writing a screenplay... ...and your gardener's playing Willy Loman down at a dinner theater in Torrance. He got me the joint, I took his headshot. Are you an agent? What do you think? - How long have you been an agent? - Oh, since 1852. At ICM, they call me the Countess. I can turn anybody into a star, even our little ranger boy. And why not? Look at him, he's so cute. He's cute, I'm bored, my guesthouse is empty. Who knows, he could turn out to be the next Michael Douglas. Another dirtbag who left me, by the way. So, what are you in for? Oh, well, I just ran away from home. I got fired from all my jobs. Wife, mother, daughter. And I broke up with my best friend, which, you know, that was the worst. - I just bailed out of husband number four. - Four? - No, five. - Five? I keep blocking one of them out because he tried to kill me. - What? - We were on a ski lift in Aspen and I ""fell. "" - What did you do? - Oh, believe me, I took care of him. By the time I was done... ...there was nothing left but the hair plugs and the asphalt on the driveway. - Ooh, shh. Shh. - What? - Why do you keep getting married? - Oh. In the end, that's really all there is. Okay. All right, give me that thing. Haven't done this since I was a freshman in college. I ate an entire tube of toothpaste. Wait. Okay. All right. All right, here's the thing. I'm just a good person, you know. I just am. I really try to do the right thing, I do. I try to... You know, I let the person with the one item go ahead of me... ...in the grocery line. I give money to homeless people. I recycle. I never cheat. Okay, well, once, I cheated. - Really? - Yeah. I was playing Monopoly. I was the little top hat, and I moved it a couple extra spaces there. But I was just a kid, so that probably doesn't count. So why am I going on and on about this? What was my point here? Oh, boy, a talker. I'm gonna have to figure this out, you know. I am. I gotta figure out why... ...at this particular juncture, my whole world has come tumbling down. Can you not bogart that, please? Thank you. I've spent an entire lifetime trying to be everything to everyone... ...and somehow, somebody is always disappointed. You know, my dear, sometimes there's a reason why people's paths cross. Let me give you Leah Miller's secret to life. Don't give a shit about anybody. Be selfish. Because once you ask yourself the question, ""What about me?""... ...everything changes for the better. I mean, after all, who are you? What do you want, Mary? Oh. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi, I'm looking for my mother, Catherine Frazier. How's she doing? She's still in some pain, but that's to be expected. She's in there. - Oh, thank you. - Right there. It'd be nice up in your room at this time... Mom? Mm-mm. Nurse. Get you something for the pain. - Mom? No. Mary. Over here. Oh, Mom. Does it hurt? I just spent thousands of dollars to look rested. Of course it hurts. You look great. Oh, thank you, thank you. I just can't believe you did this. Have you looked around lately? There are no 60-year-old women. I was the only one left. No, Mom, I'm happy you did what you wanted to do. Really, really. What have you always said to me? Don't look back, no regrets. I'm so full of shit. I have plenty of regrets. I regret I never accomplished anything of my own. I was ambivalent. And frankly, I wanted things. A big house, beautiful clothes. It was easier to get status from your father than to get it for myself. I know I failed you in a lot of ways, Mary. But probably none more than that. No, Mom. Do you wanna have a little bit of tea there? Thanks. Well, I've been thinking about going back to work. Not for Dad. I wanna design my own collection. Whoa. - What brought that on? - Hitting bottom. Having nothing left to lose. I highly recommend it. If it wouldn't blow out 80 stitches, I'd be smiling now. I don't wanna take on more than I can handle. Just a small collection. - Where are you gonna get the money? - I'll find some backers. - What about my inheritance? - Oh, no, Mom. I never did anything with it. What could be a better investment than you? No, that's not why I came here. Oh, please. I'm in no condition to argue. You know something? Someday, when I'm sitting here with my head in a helmet... ...I hope my daughter has as much love for me as I do for you right now. Huh. You are even more full of shit than I am. Yeah. Ned, please, um. I know. It's not the strongest issue I've turned out, but next month is a whole different story. Bailey Smith is writing a profile on Christiane Amanpour... ...and Alex Fisher is getting me some advanced material on her... Ned, you can't do this. Nobody turns a magazine around in under a year. Just give me three more issues, okay? I have got this great idea. How about we do a whole issue on revenge? How to get it... ...who to stick it to... ...the lost art of holding a grudge. How to construct the perfect rumor. The 10 best random acts of getting even. And we'll put a hot young actress on the cover. Yes. Thank you. Yeah, I think it'll be brilliant too. Okay, then. I'll see you in the morning. Hello? Hello? Molly? Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Here. Hey. Oh, Maggie. All that fabric from Italy? The whole dye lot was off. I had to completely recut a pattern and the fit model didn't show up. But it is going to be good. Maggie, it's gonna be so good. - Where's Molly? - She's out there. What is she doing? Well, she says she doesn't want to be a woman. Hey, Mol. Wow. You've got quite a little bonfire going there. I started it off with the slenders and now I'm adding the supers. That's the trick. Wouldn't it be just great if when you're born, they give you a rulebook... ...so every time you came up against something you had no idea how to handle... ...you just look it up in the book and there would be the answer? You know, I used to feel sorry for the kids in my class. Every other weekend with Dad until Mommy's boyfriend sleeps over... ...then Dad gets you two in a row. I used to feel sorry for them. Now I'm one of them. Listen, Molly, I know that I haven't been here for you. And I'm very sorry about that. We have a lot to talk about. I can't talk to you like I talk to Sylvie. - You've been talking to Sylvie? - She's been helping me. Well, I wanna help you. Why won't you let me help you? Because all you'll do is tell me that everything is going to be fine... ...and it's not. Dad's living in an apartment that barely has any furniture. That Crystal woman is coming over all the time. She doesn't even call first. Then she leaves stuff behind. A dress, a purse. I don't think he even really likes her that much. He's just lonely. He misses you. Molly, I can't. I just can't. I know, I remember. I used to watch you get ready to go out with Dad. And you'd let me put on your dresses and your high heels... ...and draw on some lipstick. I wanted to be you. I'm gonna go call Sylvie. Hey. - Hey. - Mary. I wanna know what you're talking to my daughter about. I promised her I wouldn't discuss it. She's having emotional problems, now you decide to be discreet? I thought she needed a safe place. I'm the safe place, okay? That is my job, not yours. I'm the mother, not you. - She said she loves me. - Yeah, you never have to say no. You show me the stretch marks, and you can do all the mothering you want. And what is this, casual Friday? It's Wednesday. Yeah, I know. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Something. - Look, let's just drop it, okay? I didn't mean to cause problems. I was just trying to help. Don't you ever get tired of saying that? How dare you reprimand me for stepping in where you should have been all along. You have not been there for your daughter, Mary. You've not been there for anybody. You're not willing to face the hard stuff. Don't you criticize me. Let me ask you something. Now that Molly trusts you, are you gonna betray her like you did me? Do you have any idea how hard it is to be your friend? I tried to make it up to you. What more do you want? I wanna know how you can sell out your best friend. I hope that job is worth it, Sylvie, because it's all you've got. I quit my job. - What? - What else could I do? I was making terrible compromises. I can't believe you quit. How could I be so out of whack that I sold out my best friend? You were in an impossible situation. Of course you'd wanna keep your job. It's what you do, and you're great at it. It's nothing compared to being responsible for a child. - I don't know how you do it. - Come on, I'm a terrible mother. Look what I'm passing down from my own. I can't even talk to my own daughter about sex. Well, it's easy for me. I wasn't there changing her diapers. - I mean... - I know, you are helping me out. You're doing me a really big favor. Thank you very much. Goddamn it. Thank you. Anything I can do. You have a huge job, huge. I'm so glad I never had children. That's the last impermissible thing you can say at a party. That you don't want children. Well, I'm gonna have a dinner party and then you can say that. Oh, my God, I'm exhausted. We're a mess. I like your hair, though. You know what? I got my divorce papers today. Oh. All I have to do is sign, and I can't seem to be able to find a pen. Mary, look, it's the 21 st century. It's okay for people to fight for their relationships. You know what this feels like? It feels like that phantom limb syndrome. You know that thing where you lose a part of your body, like an arm or something... ...but you still have the sensation that it's there. Well, you know, I'm sure Stephen feels the same way. Oh, no, I'm not talking about Stephen and me. I'm talking about you and me. Fan out. Hi, remember me? Oh, Mrs. Haines. - My nails are a mess. But why wouldn't they be, with what I've been through? - Do you have time? - No problem. It's the least I could do. - Mary? Sylvie. Oh, hi, how have you been? Oh, fantastic. I just had the most fabulous facial. So how's it going with you-know-who? Oh, absolutely fantastic, like we never skipped a beat. And the sex is just off the charts. I am so jealous. It's the whole sneaking-around thing that gives it its yummy edge. There's nothing like having an affair with your estranged husband... ...to put the spark back in things. - Oh. - Oops. Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot. I better go, before I put my foot in it again. Great seeing you, Mary. - Call me, okay? Sure. Well, that was awkward. You don't still see Crystal, do you? You have to forget what you just heard. My life's been complicated enough this year. It's all safe with me. - Now, have you decided on a color? - Yes. Jungle Red. Are you sure, Tanya? Oh, God, I can't believe he's seeing her behind my back. I'm practically living with the man. Doesn't anybody respect rules anymore? My father's taking me home now. God almighty, you scared me. I gotta go. He said I should say good night. - Oh, well, come give me a little kiss. - That's okay. - Oh, come on. We just spent the whole weekend together. It's hot in here and I have my coat on. All right. Well, good night. - Good night. Uh... Good night, who? - I asked you to call me Aunt Crystal. - I don't want to. Hey, you know, I have bent over backwards to be nice to you. I fixed up your room, I made you that amazing dinner. Who screws up macaroni and cheese? That's not the point. The point is that I make an effort. Why don't you make an effort? What's your problem? I don't like you. Come on. What kind of stupid answer is that? Everybody likes me. What would your father say if he heard you talking to me like this? I don't think he cares. Why, what'd you hear? What'd he say? Nothing. Oh, by the way, I won't be here next Friday. My mother's having a fashion show. Yeah, it's something she's always wanted to do, and now she's doing it. My father thinks it's great. He finds the whole thing kind of sexy, in a way. You know, a woman coming into her own and all that. At least that's what I heard him say. Well, enjoy your bath. Stephen! I don't know what they do in your country, but you don't throw the tinsel in clumps. We place it. We place it. Okay, I'm ready to go. Oh, my God. This is it, the big day. Look at you. I don't know how you are so calm and collected. - You must be freaking out inside. - Uta. No, I'm really okay. I always imagined myself doing this. I guess I just stood in my own way, you know? Listen, kiddo. It doesn't matter what happens tonight. What counts is that you showed up. I always knew there was someone else inside of you. Thank you, Maggie. You know, I just love you. Okay. Here I go. I'm going. And, Uta, you'll drop Molly in an hour. - Yup. - All right. Maggie, can it be? Are you involved? Oh, shut up. Here, decorate. You should be on the Discovery Channel. It's got too much blue. We gotta get her a different... I see that. Just give me a second. All right. - Mary. - Hey. - Excuse me just a second. - Mom, can you believe the turnout? All the best boutiques are here. If I throw up, will you hold my hair? It's going to be great. By the way, your father stopped by earlier... ...and said to tell you he didn't think you had this kind of talent. - Fantastic. - Don't be bitter. It leads to Botox. Listen, I'm not sure about the opening sequence of the show. And I think you need to reconsider where you place the coats. Mom, when you said you'd underwrite me... ...I didn't think it meant that you'd be popping by... ...every five minutes with helpful suggestions. But you said you'd value my input. That's what you say when you take a lot of money from someone, Mom. Nobody ever means it. Now, go find a seat. Just take a look at those coats again. Skinny. Don't bother Mary. Okay. Hey. Oh, honey, what are these? They just came. They're from Dad. They're from Dad? Hey, hey. Fingers crossed for me, okay? Okay. - Mom? - Yeah. This is really cool. Excuse me. Hi, Edie. You look very rested, Catherine. Thank you. Oh, Mary, I am so proud of you. Okay, Mom. Everything was beautiful. Okay, Mom. I guess I'm just living a little vicariously. Maybe even jealous. A little competitive. - Mom, more than I need to know. - Okay. I'll take Molly home. Mary. Mary. All right, tell it to me straight. What did you think? It was transforming. But it doesn't matter what I think. This is the lady whose opinion counts. Glenda Hill, meet Mary Haines. This is the head buyer from Saks Fifth Avenue. Hello. - Oh. Wow, I didn't realize you were coming. Well, I don't ordinarily crash fashion shows, but Sylvie called me, insisted that I come. Said I'd be missing something if I didn't, and she was right. Really? Really? I don't know what to say. It's a small collection, but I find it fresh and forward. I assume you'd be open to some changes for the Saks customer. Hemline here, maybe a jacket there. Saks Fifth Avenue is gonna order my clothes? Well, we'll start with the New York store... ...and if the clothes do well, we'll expand to all 59 stores. And of course, we need everything shipped by spring. Are you geared up for that? I think she's a little shell-shocked. - Would you mind if I think about it? - Think about it? Well, don't think too long. What do you have to think? - I have to think about it. - What is there to think about? Mary. It was so amazing, and we're so proud of you. And I am so sorry that I won't be able to stay longer to help you celebrate. But my water just broke. What? - Are we in the right place? - Are you all right? - Hang in there. - Here comes another contraction. - Oh, my God. - Oh, God. The contractions are only a couple of minutes apart. Every baby comes faster than the one before. - My last one came in just two hours. - It's okay. Excuse me, our friend is having a baby. We need a room now, so we need you guys to hurry up. - Does she have insurance? - She doesn't need insurance. Have four, get the fifth one free. Get her a room. Oh, I feel another one coming. Ah! - Another one. - They're a minute apart. One minute? She's got a minute. - She's got a minute. Okay. I'll take you right to the delivery room. And who's the birth coach? - I am. - Oh, no, no, I want Alex to do it. - What, me? - I think it'll be a good experience for you. Don't worry, I'll help you through it. - Oh, oh. - Oh, my God. This is gonna be a big baby. Don't point that thing at me, Edie. It's loaded. Come on, honey. Come on. Let's go. Glenda Hill? She is an arbiter of taste. She's a big deal. Why didn't you jump on that? - I don't think I want such a big order. - You don't wanna be a success? Depends on how you define it. I mean, I would be very happy with just a little boutique business. And I have a daughter who really needs me. Your daughter looked at you today in a new way. You gave her a mother who got something for herself. That's important. Remember when they said we couldn't have it all? We can have it all. The question is, do we want it? I don't want it all. I just want a nice piece of it. I don't want it all either, because it's exhausting. We can handle anything. We'll be each other's wives. Do you know how loveable you are, Sylvie Fowler? Do you have any idea how loveable you are? Funny you say that, because I met a guy. - You met a guy? - Yeah. I'm thinking of giving him my real phone number. - How did it feel? - Oh, I don't know. - I think it was because... - No, no, no. No thinking. How did it feel? I felt like... I felt like... I couldn't talk. I had butterflies. Like that time I found my dog at the pound. - Aw. - We're very close. You better come inside. I want my husband! Where the hell is that schmuck? He's coming, for crying out loud! You are not doing the breathing right. What is so complicated? It's like this: Somebody get here before her head spins off. I've got your back. It's okay. - Hey, is that Jungle Red? - Okay. Nice. Focus on my voice. Focus right on my voice. Focus on my voice. - Here comes another contraction. Okay, now, Edie, use it. Use it, Edie, just use it. I am never having sex again. Sew me up right now. Okay, so you got through that one, honey, you got through that one. - How's she doing? - We're a couple pushes away. - This baby has a big head. - Oh, can you see it? Oh, God, it's the head. Okay, okay, okay. It's me, it's me. Hello. Stephen? A strong one is coming. - Mary, Mary. Oh, okay. Hold on, okay. Edie, see that Christmas tree? Just focus on that Christmas tree and send all your pain right there. That was a good one. I'm not gonna make it. Oh, God. Edie's having a baby. Can I call you back? No, don't hang up. Talk to him. - Alex, I just...! - Oh, my God. He wants to go on a date. - Good. Good? I don't think I can get past everything. You can get past it, just like Alan did. - What? Whoa, back up. - Come on. Oh, don't look so shocked. Five years ago. It just happened. When Alan found out, it nearly killed him. And that nearly killed me. But he forgave me. Not right away, but he did. And you know why? Because he's a good man. He knew I loved him. And I love him and he loves me. And we love the kids. And now I'm gonna stop because I am so exhausted... ...and I want this kid out of me right now. Get it out! Okay, Stephen, here it is, here it is. I'm gonna own up to my part in all this. How could I share myself with you if I had no idea who I was? I want things now that I've put aside, and I'm gonna get them... ...and anybody who is a part of my life is gonna have to want those things for me. But this is gonna be hard. This is hard work because trust doesn't happen overnight. And if you can accept all of that, I will see you Tuesday at 8. That's all I have available, I'm very busy. - We're crowning. - I gotta go. Okay, ladies. Get her shoulders, get her knees. - Her shoulders and her knees. - Okay. - One more push, Edie. Here we go. Congratulations. It's a boy. Oh, my gosh, Edie. You did it. - You did it. I did. I did it. Edie had a baby. So beautiful. Look at you. You have a boy. Oh, my goodness. Hi, little boy. - Hello, little baby. - Sweet boy. I think real beauty is real authenticity. And it's pretty much as simple as that. I think a sense of humor is really a beautiful thing. People become beautiful when you feel their confidence. Because the beautiful thing about being a woman is that we are so many things. Honestly, it takes some cultivation to know who you are... ...with all the mixed messages and different kind of cultural demands... ...of who you should be. Be kind to yourself. Because I promise you, it will come and it will evolve... ...and you will see just how spectacular your ""differences"" are. Being a woman is a gift. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, - There they are. Plenty of room for them. - Cut that out, Kid, and get out. Hey, isn't that young Mr. Cravat, there? By golly, it is. Over here. What do you say? I know what will fetch him. Watch his ears perk up when he hears the old Travelers. Let's give it to him. High rickety! Well, you old... Hello, buddy. Old Buck. Well, hate to be making it into a firefight. If it ain't the old honker, himself. Got yourself hitched? Yeah, I've got a wife and son, four years old now. Aye, this is like a Fourth of July celebration on Judgment Day. - Beats all Creation. - Say, where are you heading for, Yancey? - I'm cutting dirt for the Little Bear Creek. - That's the spot, believe me. Yes, indeed. You're Yancey Cravat, aren't you? - And you? - Lee, Dixie Lee. - Indeed. - Going for a town site? No, I'm going for a quarter-section ranch out at the Little Bear Creek. That's funny, I'm heading for Little Bear, too. Well, I know just the piece of land I want. It's deep in the gully and a lot of scrub over. Ready, aim... - You near flummoxed. Are you hurt? - No, I'm all right. But his legs are broken. I heard them crack. Please shoot him. And in no time, no time, mind you... they'd snapped up every piece of land that was worth having... and by nightfall... By nightfall there wasn't an acre. Think of it, Louis, not an acre left out of that two million. The only spot I wanted was the ground we stood on, and... Well, the girl got that quarter section. Yancey Cravat... you let that hussy in black tights have your claim... after having been gone a whole month, away from your wife and child. - Now, Mama... - Don't you ""Mama"" me. Isaiah, go on with your fanning. Yes, Mrs. Venable. - Well? - The land was hers by right of claim. I don't believe a word of it. Why did you let her keep your land? Lt'd been a man, I could have shot him. You can't shoot a woman. - Why not? - Oh, Felice. I don't suppose you'd recognize the lady without her black tights. ""Let there be no strife between thee and me."" That's from the Old Testament, Dabney. You may not recognize that. It's all tommyrot. Perhaps now, Yancey, you'll stop this ranting up and down... and be content to settle down here in Wichita... run that newspaper of yours, and conduct your law practice, such as it is... with no more talk of Oklahoma. Don't you realize that this is a new empire? Why, folks, there's never been anything like it since Creation. Creation? That took six days, this was done in one. History made in an hour. Why, it's like a miracle out of the Old Testament. - Don't be blasphemous, Yancey. - Like a miracle out of the Old Testament. Cities of ten thousands, springing up overnight. Well, I'm going back. I'm going back and help build a new state out of the last frontier of the nation... and it'll be a state someday, mark my words. Yancey, you're not leaving me again? Leaving you, my beauty? Not by a long shot, sugar. This time you and Cim are coming with me. Louis Venable, can you sit there and see your daughter dragged off... to be scalped among savages? - But I want to go, Mama. - You don't know what you want. We start Monday week, fresh and fair, with two freighters. One with a printing outfit and the other with the household goods. - Why, we can make it in nine days. - I forbid it. You're going to stay here with your father and mother in decent civilization. - I've heard enough. - I'm going with him, Mother. That's it, honey. Why, we've had enough of this Wichita. We're going out to a brand new two-fisted, rip snorting country... full of Indians, rattlesnakes, gun- toters, and desperados. - Isaiah, I declare. - Miserable brat, you Boon boy. Master Yancey. Take me with you to Oklahomy. Please take me, Master Yancey. You ain't going to no Oklahomy. You're going to take a bath. - Mammy, I want to... - Get out. Get out. Well, I'll go see about those freighters, huh? Come on here, Cim. Atta boy. My son, you're going to see more Indians then you ever thought of. I never heard of such a thing. What do you mean, Sabra? You're not going. Why a Venable should ever marry such a man, a buffalo hunter. - Quite right. - Annie. A quart of whiskey a day, living in that dreadful Cimarron country. - What is Cimarron? - Savage, Cousin Hewitt. It means wild, unruly. Yancey's idea of a name for the boy, Cim. You don't like anything Yancey does. You never have. And that newspaper of his, Wichita Wigwam. Editorials about Indian's rights. You might think Yancey was an Indian himself. Who knows? Some half-breeds are no darker. - Don't you dare say that. - I heard he killed a man. I won't listen to you any longer. I don't care about Yancey's past. I married him because I loved him, and I'm going with him. - Sabra. - I never heard of such a thing. Yancey, where's that iron skillet? I can't find it anywhere. - Right here, sugar, with the stove. - Why didn't you tell me? Cim, honey, get up off the ground. It's too damp. You know, I think we ought to get out that old rag rug... and put it down here for supper. Right you are, honey. I think Aunt Cassandra must have put the andirons in here, sugar. - High rickety! - Isaiah! Please let me stay, Master Yancey, Miss Sabra. I'll help, I'll work, I'll do everything. I'll help you in Oklahomy. Please let me stay. Well, you're here, I reckon you can stay, Isaiah. I hope you go to heaven when you die. Let me do that cooking, Miss Sabra. I'll fix them. Yeah, you start right in by getting some wood. - Now, scoot. - I'm scooting. There's loyalty, Sabra, that money can't buy. We're going into new things, pet. A new empire... and I want to help build it for you. And we'll have just the prettiest little house we can find, too. - With flowers and things. - With flowers and trees... and morning glories growing all over. It'll be our first real home, alone... and I want you to be happy all the way, sugar. Our first real home... alone. Hold that iron. Don't move. I ain't aiming to check you through. All I want is your ready money. Come on. This is the first time I ever fronted your iron, Kid. - Well, if it ain't Yancey. Howdy. - Howdy. - I'm sorry I disturbed you folks. - This is my wife. - Howdy, ma'am. - My son's inside, asleep. I'm heading for Osage, aiming to make it my home. Osage, huh? - Gonna start your newspaper there? - Yeah. Good. - Got to be loping. - Need you hurry away like this, Kid? I got overdrawn at the bank at Red Fork and they're looking for me. Luck to you. - Stay away from Osage, will you, Kid? - Sure thing. Unless you send me an invite. Cut dirt! It's a poser, honey. All this in six weeks right up from the raw prairie. Next time you come here, Chief, you go through the roof. He shot him. Esteban Miro, a half-breed and a bad one. I didn't think he had the brash. Must have some friends around town. Don't you worry, honey. Look, sugar, they've named the streets already. Pawhuska Avenue, that's an Indian name, son. Paw-hu means hair and ska means white. White hair. Pawhuska was an old Osage chief. - I'm an Indian, old White Hair. - Cim. - Howdy. - Howdy. Lots of watermelons there, Isaiah. - Yes, sir. I sure glad I came to Oklahomy. - Just a minute. - I'll appeal to the highest court. - You're a sooner. - Don't you call me... - Gentlemen. Step right inside. We'll determine the status of this case. I don't let anybody call me a sooner. - By the way, have you each $10 with you? - Yes, we have. Step right inside, men, and tell us all about it. All right. I want to know who... Plenty of law practice. Three or four claimers for some of these lots. Look, honey. Look, folks working late. Plenty of good water... Here you are. That's right. Now, lady, what can I do for you? There's Louis Hefner's emporium. I saw old Louis stake that claim. Furniture in an undertaking parlor? They have plenty of combination stores out here until the town gets larger. If you've a mind, you can fly out of there, Elmer. Hold it there, partner. Hold her, don't let her buck you down. Get away from that weeping thing. - Why don't you do something? - I'm doing all I can, honey. Old Elmer's been uncorking the red eye, I see. Yancey, do get out of here so we can find a place to sleep. I'm nearly dead and so is Cim. I'm sorry, honey. I... Say, where's the Bixby Hotel? Left turn. You just passed it on the other corner. Honey, we passed right by it. Get along. See you later, folks. Giddyup. Come on here, boy. I won't bring up my boy in a town like this. I'm going back home. Well, don't you think you better wait until morning, honey? You know, a good night's sleep... and things are gonna look entirely different. I'll be back soon. Louis Hefner, one of the town's leading merchants now, I gather. - Hello, Yance. I'm glad to see you here. - I'm glad to be here. I trust the furniture end of the business is doing better than the other. Yeah. Only been three killings so far... but we'll have to start a full jail pretty soon, I guess. - You're gambling? - No. Just watching where the money goes. Yancey! Yancey Cravat! - Old Grat! - Yes. Come this way. Yancey Cravat. Why, you old letch monger. You are still wearing that white hat. And you're still making lightning calculations. - You know the boys. - Most of them. Esteban Miro. So, you're Cravat, huh? Yeah, and you? Yountis, Lon Yountis. - Howdy. - Howdy. Gents, what are you going to have? This is on the house. Brandy. I'll have brandy. - Are you going to start the newspaper? - Yeah, Grat. Yeah. I understand the former editor here, a man named Paigler, died. Was shot in the back, huh? What are you aiming at? Here you are, gents. Have another one. All right. Mr. Cravat, I'd like to talk to you a minute, if you have time. You see, I'm a printer and a darn good one. And you see, I heard you were gonna open up a newspaper office called... The Oklahoma Wigwam, see. And I'd like to have... Well, I'd like to go to work. - Howdy. - Howdy. - Howdy, Yance. - Howdy, Bull. - Morning. - Morning. Morning. ""...saffron-robed, arose from the ocean... - ""to bring light to gods and men."" - Ocean? Yarns and laces, celluloid collars... knotting yarn, drawstrings, shoestrings, suspenders. - Have you any fancy braids? - Yes, ma'am, I have some fancy braids. That's Sol Levy, a walking notion counter. ...suspenders, darning yarn, celluloid collars... Howdy, Sol. Howdy, Mr. Cravat. Howdy, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, here's some drawstrings... ...fancy braid and I'll give you a real good bargain. I never saw anything like it in my life. I'm afraid they think my dress is a little too elaborate. Why, Milton would have no words for such beauty. Howdy, Cim. He called you Cim. - The boys are up to something. - Who are they? I can't say for sure, but I think they're the ones that did Paigler dirt. Paigler? Who's that? Isn't that the editor? The one who was found shot dead? - You mean they did it? - I don't say they did it, exactly. They know more than is comfortable. Still wearing that white hat, huh? Who's that? That's Lon Yountis. Nothing to be alarmed about. Don't be frightened, honey. Stand right where you are. The dirty scum. Inside. Get out of here. Half-circle cut. You'll find that's the Cravat brand. - Can't you take a joke, Yancey? - Joke, nothing. - Lf your missus wasn't with you. - Don't you ""missus"" me... you dirty scum. You're a lot of good for nothing louses, that's what you are. Shooting at people in the street. You leave my husband alone. - I declare, I've a notion to... - Honey. Sabra. Why, it'll be all over the Southwest... that Yancey Cravat was hiding behind a woman's petticoat. But you didn't. They can't say so. You shot him very nicely in the ear, darling. Well, you shouldn't interfere when men are having a little friendly shooting. Friendly? A bullet within an inch of your head? He knew where it was going. Well, come on, sugar. I think we better find that house we're gonna live in, don't you? Come on. Down a little. A little more. Now a little more. Hold! Just nail it. I'll bushwhack her. - Well, honey, we're here. - Yes, we're here. We're getting started, too. You know, when I think of those five years in Wichita... - I thought you liked it in Wichita. - A prison cell, my pet. Five years in one place, that's the longest stretch I've ever done. Five years. Back and forth like a trail horse. House, office, Venables, vegetables. A little while, I'd have turned into either a Venable or a vegetable, one or the other. Well. We better get this office and print shop settled... if you're ever gonna get out an issue of that newspaper. I guess Rickey can attend to it. He's a printer and a darn good one. I gotta see about these real-estate transfers... and write up some editorials and news... and we got a clue to the Paigler killer last night. - I wanna follow it up. - I wish you wouldn't. If I can find out who killed Paigler... I'm gonna print it in the first edition of the Oklahoma Wigwam. Well, did you see the... Well, we got the shingle hung out all right, Mrs. Cravat. - Look fine, Miss Sabra. - Come on, now, colored boy. We'd better pitch in and unsnarl things. Never mind, Rickey. I'll straighten this room. - You go on into the print shop with Isaiah. - Yes, ma'am. Well, we'll unmantle the printing press... and dust off the adjectives. Thank you. Look, Mama, see what an Indian just gave me. Cim, how many times have I told you not to talk to those dirty, filthy Indians? Here, take this into the kitchen. Be careful, now. Don't drop it, and come back and help Mother. All right, Mama. Safety pins, collar buttons... needles, thread, thimbles, crochet cotton... celluloid collars, safety pins, crochet cotton, needles. Here comes that little shrimp again. Let's see how he feels today. Hey, Sol! Come here! I wanna buy a little fancy lace! Come on over here. Come on. ...cotton, needles, thread... Come on, Sol, I wanna buy my gal a bustle. - How much for a bustle cover? - Bring me a pair of tights. Safety pins, cotton gloves, needles. Please, don't start, please. Please don't, mister. Please don't. Please, mister. Please, don't. - Bring him here. - Please. Please. Please don't. - Well, howdy, Mr. Levy. - Please don't do it, mister. - Please, mister, don't... - That's all right. That's all right. - Let's you and me have a drink. - No, thank you. No. Please don't do it, mister. I don't want any. Thanks. - What? You don't want it? - No. Be a real pal and have a drink. Come on. No. - What do you think about... - Where you going, there? Where you going, there? Come here, you little runt, and have a... Come up here. Please, mister. Take a drink. Please don't, mister. Please. When I tell them to take a drink, they drink, don't they? Well, they better. You're a rough, eh, Yountis? Just whip your weight on wildcats, huh? Who asked you? Come on, Sol. You're all right, huh? Sure. That's their idea of a joke. You go ahead about your business. - They won't be bothering you none, now. - Thanks, Mr. Cravat. Thank you. Threatening to make Osage the terror of the Southwest... as in the old days of the Cimarron, huh? - Now, you as the editor... - Yeah, me as editor... I'm interviewing citizens of note regarding their sentiments. - What's yours? - Stick to your lawn. Come on, Yountis. You know what I'm aiming at. Who killed Paigler? I'm advising you to keep your mouth shut. Or the next time, it won't be your sombrero. Thanks for the sentiment. Mine is... Cherokee death cry. Means, you or him. The second button on his coat is about the spot for his wishbone... maybe a couple of inches higher. Get your real-estate papers filed all right? Yancey, dear. You're not going to bother anymore about that Paigler man, are you? Don't you be worrying your pretty head about that. Oh, please. What does it matter? He's dead. Maybe he did shoot himself. Besides, you've got Cim and me to think of. Paigler was shot in the back trying to do what I want to do: Make a model empire out of this new Oklahoma country. No, sir, I'll show them first crack. The Oklahoma Wigwam prints all the news, all the time... knowing no law except the law of God... and the government of these United States. Say, that's a pretty good slogan. Top of the page, just ahead of the editorial column. Yancey, let them alone. I don't want you to be killed. - I don't. - Honey... I'm gonna clean up the Paigler killing, or I won't be alive myself. You don't wanna lose me just yet, do you? No, dearest. There he is. - Howdy. - Howdy, ma'am. Yancey, our womenfolk think it's about time... that some contact be established between the town and Providence. There ain't a minister here, and we've come to ask you... to conduct divine service next Sunday. Divine service? - Why, sure. I'll be pleased to. - Then that's settled. - Fine. - We'll have to arrange a place. Well, let's see, there's Grat Gotch's. - The gambling tent? - It's the only place in town big enough. That's right. Yeah, I know Grat well. I'll speak to him. Come along. Back soon, honey. Good morning, Mr. Cravat. Do you feel nervous about your sermon, dear? I'd rather plead to a Texas jury than preach to this gang of... What's everybody laughing at? How can you laugh? - Isaiah. - Can't you understand? I didn't go to fret nobody. You all dress up fine for a church's meeting... so I pleased to dress myself up Sunday style. That's right, Isaiah. We take it as a personal compliment. - Why, you look finer than any of us. - I just fixed my twily like you all. Say, Isaiah, would you like to have a real suit of Sunday clothes? A Sunday suit for me to wear? For true? I don't want you to go to that church meeting. Oh, now, now. You don't understand. Now, listen close. I want you to do something important for me. Now, the house is all alone, see. I want you to go down there and keep watch... till we come home from that church meeting. Patrol duty. That's what. Patrol duty? Yes, sir, Master Yancey. Now you take this and if anyone tries to break in, shoot. - I'll kill them dead. - Fine. And then you get a new suit and boots, besides. Now, scoot. Yes, sir. I'm scooting. Do you think... Yancey, let's not go. Tell them you're sick or I'm sick. Tell them anything... We're late, honey. Hi, Yance. Hiya, preacher man. Now, Preacher, where's your Bible? Right here, boys. Now no loafing in the entrance. Either come in or stay out. Did you see that man, Yountis? He looked at you so... That's fine, honey. I always like to have the members of my flock right under my eye. Quite a shindig, ain't it? Some of these folks look as queer in church as a mule does in the front... parlor. How do, Mrs. Cravat? I'm Mrs. Tracy Wyatt. How do you do? It was so nice of your husband to conduct this service this morning. About time the intellectual life of this community was stirred up a bit. Yes. I was a schoolteacher back East, that is in Cairo, Illinois. - Indeed? - Yes, indeed. I can trace my ancestry right back to William Whipple... one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Lands, yes. Some pumpkins. I'll say. Hey, Annie. Come along, girls. - Dixie Lee, just arrived in town. - Dixie Lee? Why, I thought you'd heard of her. Why, she's a... Right here, sister. Take my pew. Get up, webfoot, and give the gals a seat. Rest the velvet, lady. Look out for them splinters. Sit down. Take off your hat. - Ain't she a huckleberry? - Lollapalooza, field up, pert and chipper. Those girls. Red Fork. Excuse me, please. Is it all right if I'm here? You can stay here just as long as I do. Thanks. Fellow citizens... I have been called upon to conduct this opening meeting... of the Osage first Methodist... Episcopalian, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptist, Catholic... Unitarian, Hebrew church. During the course of my career as lawyer and editor... I've been required to speak on various occasions on many subjects. I've spoken in defense of my country and in criticism of it. I've been called upon to defend and convict... horse thieves, harlots, and murderers. And while I know my bible from cover to cover... and many of its passages are graven on my heart... this, fellow citizens, is the very first time... that I have ever been required to speak the word of God in His temple. For any shelter, however humble or however sordid... no offense, Grat... becomes, when His word is spoken in it... His temple. Therefore, let us open this auspicious occasion by singing... What do you know, boys, anyway, huh? How about... Who Are You At Home, for a starter? Thanks, Rickey. It's a good song, though a bit secular. But you all know it. That's the main thing. Here, wait a minute. Wait a minute. While we are singing, we'll take up a collection. What for? Because, Pete, you infidel... part of a church service is in taking up a collection... and your donations, fellow citizens, ladies and gentlemen... and you, too, Pete... will be for the new church organ. Great guns, Yancey. We ain't even got a church. Now, that's all right, Pete. Once we buy an organ, it stands to reason we'd have to build a church to put it in... and, members of the congregation... anybody contributing less than two bits... will be thrown out of this tent by me. Indians not included. All right, Jesse, will you please favor us with a pitch? Will the ladies please join in with their sweet soprano voices? Now, once again, please. Fellow citizens... the sum of the collection for the organ for the first Osage church... whose denomination shall be nameless, is a gratifying total... of $133 and 55 cents. Wait a minute, Grat, did you say 55 cents? 55? That's right, Yancey. Some miserable, tightfisted, skinflint of a... Well, maybe it is an Osage by mistake. How about a Cherokee, Yancey? Not a Cherokee, Sid. I recognized your voice by the squeak. If you knew anything at all, you and Yountis and the rest of your outfit... you'd realize that a Cherokee is too smart... to put anything in the contribution box of a race that's robbed him of his birthright. Friends, we've come to the sermon. Anyone wishing to leave, kindly do so now. Please make way for all departing worshippers. My text is from Proverbs. ""A lion is in the way. There's a lion in the streets."" Friends, there's a lion in the streets of Osage. I have a confession to make. I have gone about seeking information of this lion. I might say this jackal or dirty skunk... if it wouldn't be sacrilegious. But this jackal in a lion's skin... who by threatening sudden death... has held this little town abjectly terrorized. I intended to announce from this pulpit... this platform... that I would publish this knowledge... in the first issue of the Oklahoma Wigwam... coming off the press next Thursday, thereby starting my paper off with a bang. Friends, and fellow citizens... I repent of my greed... and my desire for self-advancement at the expense of this community. I no longer intend to withhold the name of that yellow, skunking murderer... who shot down Jack Paigler when his back was turned. I will tell you all now the name of that... Was Lon Yountis. Stay where you are. Louis Hefner... as coroner, do your official duty and remove the body. Okay, Yance. It's self-defense and justifiable homicide. This town needs a boot hill, and I'll start it with this burial. Come on, boys. Fellow citizens... under the circumstances... we will forego this sermon... and conclude this service with a brief word of prayer. Bless this community, O Lord. Amen. I swan... that's the most surprising church meeting I ever attended. But I must say, your husband did the proper thing. The cleaning out of that gang is one of the first moves... to make this town fit to live in. Thanks to you, Yancey. - Horrible, he might've... - But he didn't, honey. Everything's all right. - Did you have to kill him like that? - No, I could've let him kill me. Congratulations, Mr. Cravat. Haven't seen you since the run. Well, how do you do Miss... Lee? No wonder. - I heard you were in town. - You've known. Yes, I'm here. Thought you'd settle down on that quarter section that I didn't get. Well, I tried to be a farmer, but I had to give up the land. The neighbors' wives formed a vigilance committee, and I left by request. A vigilance committee would. You haven't said a word all the way home, pet. What's stirring you? That woman, smirking and smiling. And you stood there actually talking to her, holding her hand... after she'd stolen your land in the run, too. She wanted that land because she was trying to give up her way of living... - was desperate. - Well, what's she doing here, then? Driven out by the neighbors... she heard the railroad was coming through and came down here. You talk as though you know a lot about her. A little. Comes from a good family, victim of circumstances. Well, in a way, she's a good girl. A good girl? I know a lot of people scattered over Oklahoma... that shouldn't cast a stone at her. Don't you quote your Bibles and Magdalenes at me, Yancey Cravat! - Hello, Bill. - Well, well, well. First anniversary numbers. Say, you've been meaning to pull some blood for a year. Why don't you subscribe? Well, it cost $1. Cravat could use that dollar to buy the new baby a rattle. And a pair of rubber boots till the streets get paved. You sure need rubber boots here, or go barefoot. I got to get a pair of new boots... Darling, she's awake. Hello, baby Donna. Hello, sweetheart. Look, this is Daddy. This is Mama, much more important to you just now. Yancey, darling, I'm so happy. I'm highfaluting myself, sugar, smiling as a basket of chips. I'm gonna do so many things. Build a porch for Donna. Start a woman's club, a real one. Make this town better for Donna to live in. No saloons. No women like Dixie Lee. And I'm gonna have a hired girl as soon as the newspaper... Yeah, all those things, sugar, but you mustn't try too much. The garden looks fine, Miss Sabra, and them morning glories sure is climbing. Thank you, Isaiah. Hi, there. Look, she know me. Who you rolling your eyes at and making faces? Just wait until you get a little more bigger. I've got a lot of things I is gonna teach you. May I come in? I brought you some of the nicest chicken broth, made it myself. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, News has come from Vienna! ""Leopold of Austria has seized King Richard on his return from the Crusades. Our king is being held prisoner. Nothing further is known. His Highness Prince John will make further public pronouncement tomorrow."" And how are the dear Saxons taking the news, Sir Guy? They're even more worried than Longchamps, Your Highness. They'll be more than worried when I squeeze the fat out of their pampered hides. - You intend to act on your plans? - What better moment than this, Sir Guy? Whoever would have thought my dear brother would be so considerate as to get captured... ...and leave all of England to my tender care? He may disapprove when he returns, Your Highness. If he returns. And I'll see to it that he doesn't. We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy. Golden days are ahead. I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow. Tomorrow, Your Highness. - But who's gonna pay me? - Pay! Pay! That's all you Saxons think about. Didn't I tell you it was for Prince John, who's just come up from London? Stop! Stop! This man is freeborn! He's a landowner. You can't make a slave of him! Didn't he refuse to send his men to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field? But I protest...! Dickon, follow me! The rest remain here. - What's your name, you Saxon dog? - A better one than yours. Look to your manners! This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne. Sir Guy or the devil! There's little to choose between them. - What's your name? - Much, the miller's son. - You know it's death to kill the king's deer? - And death from hunger if I don't. Thanks to you and the rest of you Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle. - Be quiet, you. - I won't be quiet! You can kill me if you like, but not until I've had my say. You can beat and starve us Saxons now... ...but when King Richard escapes, he'll take you by the scruff of the neck... ...and fling you into the sea! - What the devil? - Come now, Sir Guy. - You'd not kill a man for telling the truth? - lf it amused me, yes. Be thankful my humor's of a different sort. - By what right do you interfere with justice? - By a better right than you have to misuse it. That goes for your master, Prince John. I'll give him that message at the baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight. Thank you. He does need a bit of a talking to. - Eh, Will? - Yes, he has been getting rather out of hand. - Fetch him along. - Hold there. What's his fault? - He's killed a royal deer. - You're wrong. I killed that deer. This man's my servant. I suppose you realize the penalty for killing the king's deer is death. - Whether for serf or noble. - Really? Are there no exceptions? - Thanks, good master. - Better look before you shoot next time. From this day, I follow only you. There isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire... ...that doesn't know and bless Sir Robin of Locksley. Take me as your servant. Why, in all the forest, there isn't a hunter as good as me. I ask no pay. Just to follow you. Fetch the deer, then. While Richard is bent on adventure in foreign lands... ...it is our duty as Normans to preserve the realm... ...by giving loyal support to Prince John, the only true defender of the Norman spirit. Hail to Prince John. My lords, I thank you. Well, this is what we Normans like: Good food, good company, and a beautiful woman to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian? Was it worthwhile coming with me from London... ...to see what stout fellows our Nottingham friends are? Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne, now. One of our most renowned defenders of the realm. - Must I take him, Your Highness? - Why, you like him, don't you? - Well, he's a Norman, of course. - Is that the only reason for liking him? Isn't that reason enough for a royal ward who must obey her guardian? Oh, nay, I'd not force you, my lady. But he's our most powerful friend in these shires and he's already in love with you. If I could promise him marriage to a royal ward, it might help my plans. - Perhaps when I know him better. - Of course. You're a very wise young woman. Any more objections to the new tax from our Saxon friends? Objections, Your Highness? With a Saxon dangling from every gallows tree between here and Charnwood? Well said, sir knight. But not too many, mind. Else we'll have nobody left to till our land or pay the tax. There's one exception I'd make, Your Highness. - A certain Saxon noble. - Who is that? - Sir Robin of Locksley. - Sir Rob... Sir Robin of Locksley? Why, I've heard precious little else since I've been here. What's his latest outrage? Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer in Sherwood Forest today. And you didn't take him? That would have been a problem, Your Highness. - A Saxon a problem? - He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady. Aye. An impudent, reckless rogue... ...who goes around the shire stirring up the Saxons against authority. And he has the insolence to set himself up as a protector of the people. - I could have captured him long ago, but... - But what? Well, he's the deadliest archer in England, and... And my brave High Sheriff of Nottingham is afraid of him. I want him taken and hanged. At once, do you hear? I'll not tolerate... Open the door! Who is this, this...? Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness. Let him approach. Greetings, Your Highness. You should teach Gisbourne hospitality. I no sooner enter his castle doors with a piece of meat... ...than his starving servants try to snatch it from me. You should feed them, Gisbourne. They'll work better. With the compliments of your royal brother, King Richard, God bless him! By my faith, but you're a bold rascal. Robin, I like you. I'm gratified, Your Highness. I don't think Gisbourne shares that sentiment, however. He does look sour. What's the matter, Gisbourne? Run out of hangings? - I know a ripe subject for one. - lf you'll excuse me... Sit down! Sit down, my dear. He'll not harm you. Sir Robin, this is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter. I hope my lady had a pleasant journey from London? What you hope can hardly be important. What a pity her manners don't match her looks, Your Highness. You hear that, gentlemen? Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian he daren't say ""boo"" to her... ...and this saucy fellow gives her better than she sends. My lords and ladies, I would like to present to you Sir Robin of Locksley. Sir Robin, permit me to present to you your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne... ...and our noble guests. - I'm deeply honored, Your Highness. - Have you had meat? - None but what I brought. Well, sit down. Sit down there opposite me. - Get up, Sir lvor, and give him your place. - Your Highness! Get up! Get up, sir knight! Come, Sir lvor. Out with you. Bring Sir Robin food at once, do you hear? Such impudence must support a mighty appetite. True enough, Your Highness. We Saxons have little to fatten on by the time your tax gatherers are through. Be seated, gentlemen. No need to stand on ceremony on my account. So you think you're overtaxed, eh? Overtaxed, overworked and paid off with a knife, a club or a rope. - Why, you speak treason. - Fluently. I advise you to curb that wagging tongue of yours! It's a habit I've never formed. You know, we Saxons aren't going to put up with these oppressions much longer. Oh, you're not? Then listen to this: As you may know, my brother is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria. And from Leopold, I have received a ransom demand of 150,000 gold marks. That means that you, my friends... ...must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks in the pound, but 3! - And the money's to be turned over to me. - Why to you, Your Highness? - King Richard appointed Longchamps regent. - I've kicked Longchamps out. From now on, I am regent of England. Well, confound it, what are you goggling at? Is it so strange that I decide to rule when my brother's a prisoner? Who's to say I shouldn't? - You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds? - Not I, Your Highness. - You, Sir Boron? - Nor I, Your Highness. - You, Sir Ralf of Durham? - My sword is yours, Your Highness. And what about our young Saxon cockerel here? What's the matter? Have you no stomach for honest meat? For honest meat, yes. But I've no stomach for traitors. - You call me traitor? - You? Yes. And every man here who offers you allegiance. Your Highness. What do you call a man who takes advantage of a king's misfortune... ...to seize his power? And now, with the help of this sweet band of cutthroats... ...you'll try to grind a ransom for him out of every helpless Saxon. A ransom that'll be used not to release Richard, but to buy your way to the throne. Let me ram those words down his throat, Your Highness! Oh, no. Later. Let him spout for the moment. And what do you propose to do? I'll organize revolt. Exact a death for a death. And I'll never rest until every Saxon in this shire can stand up, free men... ...and strike a blow for Richard and England. - Have you finished? - I'm only just beginning. From this night on, I use every means in my power to fight you. Dickon! Such impudence, Your Highness. If I could only reach him. Stand back! Stand back! Open the door! Quick, guards, quick! There's a traitor inside trying to escape! - Shut the door, quick! - Traitor, sir? You infernal idiot! Which way did he go? There, through the gate. - After him! - Guards! Horses! Dickon, follow Mansfield! To your troop! Up you go, quick. Find Crippen the arrow-maker and his friends... ...to pass the word to every man who's been beaten or tortured: - The Gallows Oaks in Sherwood tomorrow. - Yes, master. Off you go, and good luck. Have it proclaimed in every village that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw. - Hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid. - Yes, Your Highness. His possessions are forfeit to the crown. Seize his castle and his lands. Everything he owns. And just to let the people know how the wind has changed... ...the sooner you begin collecting the... - The ransom, Your Highness? Yes, yes, of course. The ransom. There's a death sentence for your Robin of Locksley! I'll have him dangling in a week. - I'm tired. - What? - After a refreshing sleep in the greenwood? - I've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs. - Lovely fresh air. - My teeth ache with chattering. - Nightingales singing. - An owl hooting in my ear all night. Hooting? He was singing you to sleep. There's a lusty infant. He'd be a good one to reason into joining us. By the look of him, his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him. - Let's see what he's made of. - It's your skull, not mine. - Give way, little man. - Only to a better man than myself. He stands before you. Let him pass, Robin. It's much too warm to brawl with such a windbag. When I've brushed this fly off, I'll give you a dusting for good measure. This fly has a mighty sting, friend. I've only a staff and you threaten me with a longbow and a goose shaft. - Aren't you man enough...? - Wait! I'll get myself a staff. - Ready? - Yes. Hey, pretty fellow, play a livelier tune that I can make this puny rascal dance to. You need a merrier tune? Well, how's this? If you want a lesson, you came to the right man! - Where is he? - Who? - This quarterstaff master. - Here. Give my compliments to him. My friend, I should ask payment for what I'm teaching you here today. There's something on account. There's your change. My head hums like a swarm of bees. What's your name, friend? - John Little. What's yours? - Robin. - Not Robin of Locksley? - Aye. - Then I'm right glad I fell in with you. - 'Twas he who did the falling in. I wanted to see what you were made of. And I did. - I hope you'll not hold it against me. - On the contrary. - I love a man that can best me. - I'd like to join your company. You shall. If you can hold a breach like you held that bridge, you're one of us. Welcome. - This is Will of Gamwell. - Yeah. - He took good care not to wet his feathers. - Just brain over brawn, friend. You heard Robin's orders. Look nippy now and spread the word. ""By royal decree, Robin of Locksley is declared an outlaw, condemned to death."" - Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks. - ""Any person aiding him will be hanged."" Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks. Robin in Sherwood. At the Gallows Oak. Robin in Sherwood. Robin. Gallows Oak. Gallows Oak. I've called you here as freeborn Englishmen, loyal to our king. While he reigned over us we lived in peace. But since Prince John has seized the regency... ...Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors have murdered and pillaged. You've all suffered from their cruelty. The ear loppings, the beatings... ...the blindings with hot irons, the burning of our homes... ...the mistreatment of our women. It's time we put an end to this! - Robin's right. - Aye! Now, this forest is wide. It can shelter, clothe and feed a band of good, determined men... ...good swordsmen, good archers, good fighters! Men, if you're willing to fight for our people, I want you. Are you with me? Aye! Aye! Then kneel and swear this oath. That you, the freemen of this forest, swear to despoil the rich only to give to the poor. To shelter the old and helpless, to protect all women, rich or poor, Norman or Saxon. Swear to fight for a free England. To protect her loyally until the return of our king and sovereign, Richard the Lion-Heart. And swear to fight to the death against our oppressors! We do! We do solemnly swear! String him up again! - He'll die if we lash him again, my lord. - Oh, he'll die, will he? Another one of their Saxon impudences. They'll do anything to trick us. Continue! - Mercy, good master! Have mercy! - Start him dancing! This will teach you to defy Prince John! Father! Father! Stop! Five men dead. Murdered. Sir lvor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert. - You don't have to name them. - Our men can't lay a hot iron... ...in the eyes of a tax dodger without getting an arrow in the throat. It's an outrage! - He's got to be stopped! - Have you tried to stop him? Yes, but I couldn't find him. What chance has anyone of finding him? Every villager and woodcutter's his friend. Every runaway serf and Saxon thief in the shire is joining him. I've sent spies in the forest to find out his hiding place... ...but he strikes, and gone like a flash. - While you stay safely at home. Do you question my valor? Am I not personally commanding the force... ...that goes with Sir Guy and Lady Marian to Kenworth Castle... ...to guard the tax money he is bringing back, with my sword and my life? I only hope this murderer does come out of his hiding place. You hope! Enough of this wrangling! I'll lay this outlaw by the heels when I get back. Well, well. A curtal friar, and a mighty fat one at that. - He's the man we need. I'll enlist him. - Be careful, Robin. That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey. He's noted... Yeah, that's right. Noted for his piety. A humble soul, he is, with a heart as gentle as a lamb. - Be easy with him, master. - Oh, I won't harm him. You stay here lest you frighten him. Don't interfere. But that friar's one of the most dangerous swordsmen... Bless my soul, a miracle! Robber! Thief! Give me back my mutton joint! If you're a robber you'll get nothing from me. I'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty. If this is poverty, I'll gladly share it with you. That's what you are doing. Give me back my mutton joint! Not so close, my ponderous one. - I'd have a word with you. - Well? I live in the forest with good fellows who've everything in life save spiritual guidance. And no merit but one. - And what's that? - We're outlaws. Since we're newborn to the greenwood, we need someone to do our christenings. - So we've chosen you. - Not I. - They've probably all got your taking ways. - Of course. But you'll love them, one and all. Now, friar, let's waste no more time. We'll take the shortcut across the stream. - Come. - I'll not. I'm happy here. You will come. Now then, since I don't care to get my feet wet, you'll carry me across on your back. - On my back? - Bend! You must learn obedience. Come on, bend. On, now! Come on! On! On! Faster! I'll have a gallop from you yet. Come now, fat one. Why don't you give up? You can see I'm a better swordsman. After I let a little air into your bellows you'll whistle a different tune. By Our Lady, you're the fairest swordsman I ever met. Must we go on, then? I think we're even now, friar. Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me by half a leg of mutton. - So... - No. Hold there, friar. Enough. Come with me and I'll promise you the finest venison pasty, and the biggest you ever ate. Beef, boar's head, casks of ale. If you'd said that before, you'd have saved us both a wetting. Come along. - You'll join us? - Aye. If only to convert you from your thieving ways. You're Robin Hood, aren't you? The holy henchman! Hail, doubting friar! - Robin. - Aye? He's well named Friar Tuck. It would take half the deer in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern. And twice that to fill your empty head. - Whoa, Will! - What news, Will? - I've got word... - It's all right. He's one of us. One of us? He looks like three of us. Aye. And equal to a full dozen. Now, now, now, now. Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will? Sir Guy of Gisbourne is stopping by the way tonight. - Has he got the tax money? - A fortune! - When does he enter Sherwood? - Tomorrow. We'll have to postpone that stuffing match I promised, but it'll be double tomorrow! Come! Back to camp, men! Here, curb your appetite with that. - Are you ready, men? - Aye. - See anything of them? - Not yet. Is everything ready? They'll think they've got into a blooming hornet's nest. There they come. - Hadn't we better send out flanking guards? - What for? Well, this is Sherwood, you know, and Robin Hood... - Afraid of that gallows-face? - Afraid? Certainly not, sir. But it's here that he's boldest. Don't worry. We're more than enough to take care of him. Outlaws have no face to show themselves against armed troops. Are you sure? I seem to remember... Oh, yes, he jumps out of ambush at small parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us. - Well, you old rooster, what do you see? - Make ready. They're in two sections. - Do you see Sir Guy? - He's leading the second. The treasure wagon is with him. Sir Guy and the sheriff are watering their horses. - The advance guard's far ahead. - Good. Little John! Take your men and cut off the first section. You surround the advance guard. Personally! - Ready, men? - Aye, Robin! Then stand ready for the signal. Come, Will. Come on, let's welcome Sir Guy. - Look! - The guard! Quick! Welcome to Sherwood, my lady. What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you? Why, that's curious. I've often heard that you'd give me a warm welcome if ever we met again. - You're permitting this insolence without...? - Fighting? - I'm afraid he has no choice, my lady. - Well, I have, you impudent rascal! You're not going to harm my lamb, my honeysuckle. Be still, Bess. We've nothing but peaceful intentions. Have we, men? We only want to stroke his pretty neck. - We won't harm him much. - You see? Well, let's away. Don't bother to mark the way. It'll take keener men than you've got... ...to find our camp again. - You'll hang for this, all of you. A small price to pay for the company of such a charming lady. What can a Saxon hedge-robber know of charm? Or ladies? - She means you. - Me? A hedge-robber? You must tell me more about myself. You may have been misinformed. Perhaps, but I don't find it interesting enough to bother about. You just harm one hair of my lady's head... ...and that ugly face of yours will walk about with no neck under it. Now, mind! - What are you staring at? - I ain't never been out walking... ...with a female before. - What female? - You. - Well, of all the impudence! I suppose you say that to all women that tickle your fancy. I've never tickled a woman's fancy before. No, I've never had a sweetheart. Do you mean to say you never had one single sweetheart in all your life? You don't know what you missed, my lad. I've had the bands on five times. My lord! Your robes for the feast. Hurry up, put them on. - I won't! - You will! I will! I will! To them, this is heaven. Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches, limitless food instead of hunger. - Why, they're actually happy. - Are they? Aren't you even a little pleased to see them enjoying themselves? I think it's revolting. Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it, my lady? Too sheltered, perhaps. But if you could know these people as I know them. Their patience, loyalty, goodness. Friar Tuck! These should fit Sir Guy. Me lord. Here is your raiment for the banquet. When you've done with them, give them to Prince John. To the tables, everybody, and stuff yourselves! May I serve you, my lady? I'm afraid the company has spoiled my appetite. Misfortune. Now, mine is excellent. - A little mutton, my lady? - I said I'm not hungry. Why, so you did. I'd forgotten. Well, you will let me know if you regain your appetite, won't you? Friends! Friends! I'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow... ...and a bitter enemy of ours. And yet, look! He provides us with this tasty supper. And is this the end of his beneficence? Why, no! For in his train today he's brought us half a score of boxes full of jewels and silks... ...and more, about 30,000 golden marks wrested from the northern shires. - You wouldn't dare. - Sit down! Some of you might think our host intended this treasure for the coffers of Prince John... ...instead of to ransom the king. And you would be right. But a strange thing happened. A change of heart overtook him in the forest, and there it is, safe and sound! - You speak of loyalty. - Yes. Why not? I suppose you and your cutthroats intend to send this treasure to Richard? You wouldn't dream of keeping it yourselves. Friends! What shall we do with this treasure? Divide it amongst ourselves? - Hold it for Richard! - It belongs to the king! - Convinced? - I may have been hasty... But why you, a knight, should live here like an animal, robbing, killing, outlawed...? Are you really interested in learning why I turned outlaw? Or are you afraid of the truth? Or of me, perhaps? - I'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you. - Good. Then come with me. Oh, so you are afraid. - Well, men. - Hi! Hardly an inspiring sight for such pretty eyes as yours, I'm sure. But these poor devils have all had their homes burned. Their families beaten and starved to death by your tax gatherers. - Bless you, Robin. We'll never forget you. - Our humble thanks, master. - May we be worthy, Robin. - You are, mother, you are. - Have you eaten well, friend? - Yes, thank you, Robin Hood. We humbly thank you, master. I'm sorry to have to show you that. But once these poor people were happy and contented. Just simple villagers who never harmed a soul. And now... Tortured, eyes put out, tongues slit, ears hacked off. They come to me for protection against your Norman friends. But you've taken Norman lives. Yes, those that deserved it. The cruel and unjust. You're a strange man. Strange? Because I can feel for beaten, helpless people? No, you're strange because you want to do something about it. You're willing to defy Sir Guy, even Prince John himself. To risk your own life. - And one of those men was a Norman. - Norman or Saxon. What's that matter? - It's injustice I hate, not the Normans. - But it's lost you your rank, your lands. It's made you a hunted outlaw, when you might have lived in comfort and security. What's your reward for all this? Reward? You just don't understand, do you? I'm sorry. I do begin to see a little now. If you do, then that's reward enough. Now that you've robbed us and had your fill of insulting us, we wish to leave. - Come, Lady Marian. - My men will escort my lady. But before you take leave, it might be well if you thanked her for saving your life. My life? Do you think you would have left this forest alive if it hadn't been for her presence here? - Peter! Harold! - Yes, master? Take six men and guide our loyal host and his nervous friend to the Nottingham Road. But our horses, our clothes. You'll return to Nottingham as you are, on foot. This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson to you in humility, if not in mercy. - Your people will be returned tomorrow. - But the lady Marian. You'd best be started before I have a change of mind. I think we'd better go. Now, my lady. Friar Tuck! Little John! Take the lady to the Abbey of the Black Canons... ...so tomorrow the bishop can give her escort the rest of the way. - May I go too? - With your permission, my lady? Goodbye, my lady. Goodbye. - He took everything you had collected? - Every silver penny. And you two nincompoops sat there and let him do it. - Oh, we resisted as well as we could. - Where are your wounds? Your bruises? - And where are your men? - What did Your Highness expect? With the Lady Marian in our company and Locksley's men outnumbering us. And not an arrow wound to divide among them, I suppose. And more than 30,000 marks in the hands of that wolf's head. That fellow's got to be taken. Understand? And how does Your Highness suggest that he be taken? - lf I may be so bold as to inquire? - Mind your words, Gisbourne. You're fortunate not to be paying for this with your head. Your Highness, sir, I could muster an army and surround Sherwood. - You couldn't capture him... - You mind your words. ...if he sat in your lap shooting arrows at a crow. Arrows! - He said shooting arrows at a crow. - Take that silly looking bonnet off. That stirs something in my mind. Perhaps we can't take him by force. He's too well protected. Knows Sherwood's hidden paths well. But... - But what? - We'll outwit him. We'll hold an archery tournament! Archery tour... And have him fly in on the end of one of his own arrows? That's marvelous. He's the finest archer in the North. Think he'd forgo shooting... ...against the archers of all England? We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow. And ask him to risk his neck for that? That won't be the only bait, with the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself. What do you mean? When they came out of the forest, she seemed very friendly. And didn't you notice how his eyes never left her? - Yes, yes, I noticed. - Well, then! - Well, then, how do we get word to him? - Get word to Robin... ...who has an eye in every bush and ears in every wall? But even if he comes, won't he be disguised? Whether he be dressed as priest, beggar, knight, palmer, what disguise can conceal... ...the finest archer in England? The man who wins the golden arrow will be Robin Hood. Will you take that bonnet off? I hope our little golden hook will catch the fish. - You hope? - Oh, it will if he's here. If he's not, we'll stick your head upon the target and shoot at that. - Are your men sure of their orders? - Yes. They're stationed all around the field. Even a worm couldn't get through. You talk as if this were a trap. Oh, no, my dear. Just a precaution in case the Saxons create a disturbance. By orders of His Highness Prince John, the champions of Sir Guy and the knights... ...will be limited to three flights of arrows for the eliminations. The winning team will meet all comers. - You know it's a trap. - A golden arrow, from the lady herself. - They've cooked up this thing to take you. - Well, what of it? - You know what'll happen if they do. - Where's your sporting blood? Sir Guy accepted our invitation. We'd be rude not to accept his. - It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched. - There, my band getting fat and overfed. Where's your love of fights, risk, adventure? Well, since our friend seems to have gone a little mad, I'll have to see him through. We'll have to see him through. Prepare final flight. Does my lady find it interesting? Lady Marian? - Oh, I'm sorry. - I asked if you found it interesting. Yes, very. They're splendid archers. You'll find it much more interesting later on. The winning team will compete as individuals. Captain Phillip of Arras. Elwyn the Welshman. Matt of Sleaford. They now challenge all comers. The men who'd shoot against that lot have to have the eyes of a falcon. They're far too good for me. I'm not shooting today. Remaining archers will use center target. Matt of Sleaford, out! Elwyn the Welshman, out! - The tall tinker. - Now is the time. Not so hasty, Sir Guy. I'm enjoying myself. Let them finish the match. - But he could... - Have your men close in if you wish. Look. Yeah, they're closing in. I hope Robin sees them. I must commend Your Highness for the subtlety of your scheme. Very good. Would you say you'd seen that tall fellow before? And if I had, what interest could a tinker have for me? Phillip of Arras shoots next. Tie! You will be allowed another flight. Target's a deal too close. Can we have it removed to a fit distance to shoot at? Another 20 paces! If your archer captain wins at that distance, I'll give you 1000 gold marks for him. Win or lose, I'll give him to Your Highness for a favor. Provided you let me deal with this wolf's head in my own way. Done. I'm leaving for Norwich immediately after the tournament anyway... ...so you may do what you please with him. Why, he can't win now. No living man could beat that shot. I'll wager 100 marks on Phillip of Arras! He split Phillip's arrow. The tinker wins! He wins! - What is your name, archer? - Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness. How is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms? Even a peaceful tinker must protect himself these days from treachery and other things. It's earned you more than you bargained for today. I pronounce you champion archer of England. And from the gracious hand of Lady Marian Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward. Advance. I... Here is your prize, sir archer. It's indeed an honor to receive it from the hands of so beautiful a lady. - How is it that you didn't use a black arrow? - That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy. - Its verdict is always final. - Arrest this man! That's a good idea. You're a very rash young man. And I'm sorry I can't be in Nottingham to see what Gisbourne has in store for you. - It'll be something special, I'm sure. - I'm sure. Sorry I underestimated you. Next time perhaps... There'll be no next time. Take him away! ""Robin of Locksley. Known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood. After trial, in which you did not produce one witness in your behalf... ...you've been found guilty of outlawry, theft, murder, abduction... ...false pretenses, contempt of the Crown, poaching in royal forests and high treason."" Haven't you forgotten a count or two? Surely it's a crime under the noble Prince John to love one's country. To protect serfs from injustice and be loyal to one's king. If I could add anything to the charges against you, I would most gladly do so. ""It is the sentence of this tribunal, on the morrow at high noon you be taken... ...to the square in Nottingham and there hanged by the neck until you are dead."" There may be some who will regret that a man of your peculiar talents... ...should be cut off so early in life. But personally... You think the sentence extremely lenient. Thank you. What's troubling you, my lady? Is it the outlaw? Yes. I hate to see a human being trapped... Bess, you know where his men may be found, don't you? - Why, my lady, how should I know? - Don't put me off. That little man who liked you. You've been seeing him? - Yes, my lady. - Tell me where. - Do you want to send a message? - To his men, yes. Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale of a night, just now and again... ...at a place in the town and I won't deny as some of the others were there. Where was it? Oh, Bess, please tell me! It was a tavern, my lady. The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim Court. - The landlord's name is Humility Prin. - Humility Prin. - Knock at the door and say, ""A Locksley."" - ""A Locksley."" - Yes, but... - Get me a cloak, quickly! Yes, madame. Oh, dear... - But there must be some way... - lf we had to, couldn't we storm the place? Why, you'd need an army with a battering ram to even dent it. Aye, he'll be hanged for sure. Maybe Little John's right. Perhaps we should... A Locksley. - What is it, Prin? - A lady, sir. The Lady Marian. - What? - It's a trap, Will. Watch those windows. She has the password, all right. - Is she alone? - Yes, sir. Fetch her in. - What do you want, my lady? - I want to help him. - How did you find us here? - Never mind that now. Please don't stand there staring. Tell me what I can do. - Don't trust her. It's a Norman trick. - Would I come here alone if it were a trap? What's to prevent your killing me if...? Is there no one here with sense enough to see? One moment. We have to make sure, my child. You're a good daughter of the church? You swear by Our Lady that you want to help Robin? I swear, good Father. - Have you thought of a way? - Yes. - Can you get us in the castle? - That's no good. He's heavily guarded. But I thought of another way. Listen. - This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady? - Yes, isn't it? With Locksley out of the way, we'll stamp out the rest. Won't it be a pleasant surprise for Prince John when he returns? And to think that I was once foolish enough to believe that you rather liked him. Why, your hand is trembling. Take him to the gallows. Take him up there. He'll not be so insolent when they've stretched his neck. Get ready. Stop him! Stop! Guards! Friar Tuck! Much! - Here we are, sir! - Here we are, safe and sound! Back to camp! Robin! Where are you? Here I am. Stand by! He is different from anyone I've ever known. He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless, and yet he's gentle and kind. He's not brutal like... Tell me, when you are in love, is it... ...well, is it hard to think of anybody but one person? Yes, indeed, and sometimes there's a bit of trouble sleeping. I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping. Yes, and it affects your appetite too. Not that I've noticed it's done that to you, except when he was waiting to be hanged. Does it make you want to be with him all the time? Yes. And when he's with you, your legs are weak as water. Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you, do you feel a kind of prickly feeling... ...like goosy pimples running all up and down your spine? - Then there's not a doubt of it. - Doubt of what? That you're in love! What do you want? Robin! - I must say. I must say! - Keep quiet, Bess. Are you completely mad? - Why did you come here? - To see you. But don't you realize that...? My men told me what you did for me, so I've come to thank you. And after what I couldn't help overhearing about that prickly feeling... ...I'm very glad I did come. That was a game. Now, you've got to go at once! A game? Well, couldn't I join in? Of course, I probably wouldn't be as good at it as this pretty young girl. But I could do my best. Bess, will you leave us? Please! Now, let's see, where does this game begin? Oh, I know. It's simple. We'll start where you're in love with me. You are, aren't you? Because I am with you, terribly. That's why I came. I had to see you again. You must go at once. And I don't love you. - Oh! Are you sure? - Yes. Very well then, I'll go. You know, this is rather unfriendly of you, exposing me to my enemies like this. Now, let me see. There's a fat old captain of the guard down there with bow legs. If I drop on him that'll bend them out worse. An archer! He's too thin. I might miss him altogether. - Robin! - The very thing. Five men-at-arms in a group. They'll break the fall beautifully. - Goodbye, my lady! - Robin! - Yes? - Please. Then you do love me? Don't you? - Don't you? - You know I do. Well, that's different. - Do you know you're very impudent? - Me? You are! When my guardian, King Richard, finds out about your being in love with me... - I know, he'll make me court jester. - He won't! He'll stick your funny head on London Gate. And a fine decoration it will be, my bold Norman beauty. - I'm not bold. - Well, you're Norman. Well, I don't hold that against you. And you are a beauty. - You're the most beautiful... - You're leaving at once. Please, darling, every minute you're here you're in danger. I'll go. - Marian, will you come with me? - To Sherwood? I've nothing to offer you but a life of hardship and danger, but we'd be together. - But, Robin, dear... - I know. It's asking a lot, but who knows... ...how long it'll be before Richard returns. Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you? Because I love you, Robin, I'd come. Even the danger would mean nothing if you were with me. Then you will? No. Listen to me, darling. You remember that day in Sherwood Forest? I realized then for the first time that what you were doing was right... ...and that we were wrong. No, let me finish. You taught me England is bigger than Normans and Saxons... ...fighting and hating each other. That it belongs to all of us, to live peacefully together... ...loyal only to Richard and to England. But, darling, you could help. I could help much more by watching for treachery here... ...and leaving you free to protect Richard's people until he returns. Now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone? Go now, quickly, dearest. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, my love. - Goodbye. - You gentlemen have traveled far? - Yes, quite a distance. I'm sorry I can't give you better food. - There is little left to us these days. - This will be enough. The inn at Luton was well supplied. How is that? That's a Norman inn. But it's an outrage! I'll complain to Prince John. I'll have this rascal's ears, no matter how. Dares to rob me! Strip my person of jewels! What's this country coming to when a high churchman can't travel the forest in safety? - Who's he? - The Bishop of the Black Canons. - Do you wish to go on after dinner? - No. We can't reach the abbey tonight. - I'll stay. Tend to the horses. - Yes, Your Grace. - Bring food to us! - Yes, Your Grace, at once! It's no longer safe to journey anywhere. Robbers at every turn of the road. - What happened, Your Grace? - I told you! We've been robbed. Not a chance to defend ourselves. They burst on us from ambush. - Who did? - Why, Robin Hood, of course. There's no other with impudence enough. Robin Hood again, sire. - You've heard of him, then? - Oh, he seems well known hereabouts. - Oh, then you're strange to this shire? - More or less. What might be your names, gentlemen? They're hardly important enough to deserve your interest. - Landlord, where's our ale? - Coming, sirs. Will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight? We hadn't decided, Your Grace. What would you advise? Well, there's so much danger on the road, you'd be far safer here. We will then, since we'll have the added pleasure of your company. Well, I should really like to stay, but I recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey. Some other time, or perhaps you would break your journey and sup with me tomorrow. Your Grace is too kind. Then I bid you good evening, gentlemen, and God speed you in the morning. Thank you. Good night. The window! Are there beds prepared, landlord? Let's to sleep, then. I'm tired. - I'm afraid he suspects, sire. - I fear so. His Grace is a Norman. Did you see the fear on the landlord's face when he came in? I've seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned. I ought never to have left England. I noticed when Robin Hood's name is mentioned... The mysterious outlaw whom we have sought. In vain. However, the bishop didn't have any difficulty meeting him. Which gives me an idea. - And you're sure it was Richard? - No doubt of it. How like my dear brother this is! He couldn't rot in Durnstein like any decent man. - But Richard has no army. - No, Your Highness. - lf he had, we should have heard of it. - lf my brother happened to be killed... - England would have a new king. - That would be murder! I'll have no part... You'll do as you're told! That's very simple. Keep your mouth closed. Your Highness, I beg of you! How long will you retain your abbey if Richard survives to find out... ...what you've been up to these years he's been away? Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to...? Dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs... ...over some little mischance. There's nothing he wouldn't do for a king who'd restore him to rank. - You don't love my brother, I hear. - I have little reason to, Your Highness. - You know this tavern? - Yes. - lf Richard dies... - Dickon returns to the roll of English knights. Am I not right? With the manor and estate of Robin of Locksley to support his rank. - When shall I start? - Immediately. How many men will you need? I shall do it better alone, Your Highness. The sooner you're crowned king... The better for my friends? You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne. Thank you, Your Majesty. Return to your abbey and make preparations to proclaim me king... ...here in Nottingham, the day after tomorrow. Do you suppose she heard? I don't know. And now you know why Robin's got to find King Richard at once and warn him. Take this note to Much at Saracen's Head. My lady's hearing is a little defective tonight. When you knock at a lady's door as if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait. You seem upset. Upset? Why should I be? Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian. You've played the innocent long enough. - Let's be frank with one another. - I don't see the need. You're charming, Lady Marian, but not exactly clever. You couldn't have failed... ...to overhear what Prince John and I were talking about. Oh, no, no, no. Please don't trouble to deny it. And your first thought, as Richard's loyal ward, was to warn him. - Am I not right? - Why, how could I warn Richard? How did Locksley and his men arrange his escape... ...from hanging after the archery match? Someone here in the castle must have got word to him. That's ridiculous! When Richard's in danger, what more natural... ...than that you should try to warn him through Locksley? And you do intend to warn him, don't you? - Don't you? - No! If that's true, perhaps you'd explain before Prince John... ...and the Court of Execution the meaning of this. Guard! Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall. Not only has she consorted with this Saxon rebel... ...found guilty of outlawry, theft, murder, abduction and high treason... ...but she has betrayed her own Norman people. Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian? Yes, I am. Bitterly. But it's a shame that I'm a Norman... ...after seeing the things my fellow countrymen have done to England. At first I wouldn't believe. Because I was a Norman I wouldn't let myself believe... ...that the horrors you inflicted on the Saxons weren't just. I know now why you tried so hard to kill this outlaw whom you despised. It's because he was the one man in England who protected the helpless... ...against beasts who were drunk on human blood! And now you intend to murder your own brother! You'll be sorry you interfered. Sorry? I'd do it again if you kill me for it. A prophetic speech, my lady, for that is exactly what is going to happen to you. You wouldn't dare. I'm the royal ward of King Richard and no one but the king himself... ...has the right to condemn me to death. You are quite right, my dear. And it shall be a king who will order your execution for high treason... ...exactly 48 hours from now. Take her away. - Have you got it all in your stupid head now? - Of course I have. Well, give Robin the whole message exactly like I told it to you. Bess, where was Dickon supposed to find King Richard? Oh, never mind him! What do I care about your kings and thrones and such? Robin has gotta do something to save my baby! Come on, old girl. Robin will look after her, all right. - Where's Dickon heading for? - Kent Road Tavern. Kent Road Tavern? You can save three miles and cut him off through Low Wood. Come on, lass, give us a kiss and wish me luck. Hurry up and take your ugly face out of here. Oh, Much. Oh, you will be careful, won't you? Of course I will. Greetings, sir abbot! - You've traveled far this morning? - Too far to be patient with delay now. Perhaps it's the weight of your purse that wearies you. Now, I can remedy that. If it weighs more than a just amount I'll share it with those who have less. Come. You think I hand my purse to every rough lout who asks for it? You see, sir abbot? We're poor outlaws, with nothing to eat but the king's deer... ...while you have property, rents, and silver. So your purse! I've traveled far on the king's business and the silver I have left... ...equals no more than 60 marks. What? Are you friendly to our good King Richard? I love no man better. By that speech you save half your money. Give me 30 marks for the poor and the rest you may keep. Then I can go free? Any friend of Richard's is free of this forest. Would you honor us by sharing meat with us? - Gladly. - Then come. - Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you? - I'm called Robin Hood. It seems I've heard of you. - Nothing good, I hope. - Oh, now I remember! How does your loyalty to Richard set on a killer of knights... ...a poacher of the king's deer and an outlaw? Those I kill died from misusing the trust that Richard left them. And the worst rogue of these is the king's own brother. - Oh, then you blame Prince John. - No, I blame Richard. His task was defending his people instead of deserting them to fight in foreign lands. What? You'd condemn Holy Crusades? I'll condemn anything that leaves the task of holding England to outlaws like me. Much! - Much, what's happened to you? - Take me to Robin, quick! - Much, what's happened? - King Richard's in England. In Sherwood! What? Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road Tavern last night to kill the king. - Will, take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern... - No need, master, no need. I headed Dickon off. He ain't gonna murder no one no more. - But the king? Where is he? - I don't know, master. Men, Richard must be found. He must be brought here for safety. Little John, take a party and scour the country. Friar Tuck, into the town. Will, search every inn and cottage. Don't rest, day or night, until he's found. Understand? You don't need to search for Richard, Robin. - He's in good hands. The best in England. - What do you mean? Where is he? Here! Sire. All these have remained loyal. Rise, Sir Robin. Rise, men of Sherwood. Sire, Prince John's calling Bishop of the Black Canons... ...to proclaim him king in Nottingham tomorrow. - How'd you learn this? - Lady Marian. She overheard. They've taken her for treason. She's been condemned to the block for warning us. He wouldn't dare execute the king's ward. You underestimate him. If we're to save her and your throne, we've got to act now! By attacking Nottingham castle? Without an army it'll be much too strong. Your men will be killed. If the Bishop of the Black Canons is performing the ceremony tomorrow... ...suppose we visit him at his abbey tonight and persuade him to suggest a way. Brace up. Smile! Wider! Still sure it wasn't you who warned my brother I was in England? Why, sire, believe me, I... Your Grace, smile! You'll sweat the lard off that fat carcass of yours... ...before this day's over, my pudgy friend. And I hope some Norman sword whittles you down to size! Oh, Lord, we beseech thee. Sanctify this thy servant, our royal Prince John. Enrich his noble heart and bestow upon him all princely virtues. Amen. No news of Richard. No. None, Your Highness. Then Dickon must have... Sir Dickon, Your Highness. Of course. Of course. We are ready for the ceremony, Your Majesty. Remember. By what authority do you, John Lackland, Prince of England... ...claim to be crowned this day, sovereign of the realm... ...and as defender of the Holy Sepulcher, to receive the blessing of the church? By right of blood succession. According to the law of the realm. Is it of your own free will that you thus depose your brother... ...Richard the Lion-Heart of England? Richard no longer exists! From this moment forward, I, John, am king of England! Aren't you a little premature, brother? Richard! The Lion-Heart! He's lying! He's an imposter! - The king lives! - Men of Sherwood! Robin Hood! It's a trick of the outlaws! Kill him! Seize him! - Did I upset your plans? - You've come to Nottingham once too often! When this is over, there'll be no need for me to come again. Your sword, Gisbourne. - Know any prayers, my friend? - I'll say one for you! Save yourself, Robin! The door, quick! Quick, or I'll trim that beard for you! But, Richard, Richard! I thought... - You thought I was murdered! - Oh, no, no. I didn't mean to... After all, Richard, I am your brother. Yes, sire, he is your brother. Yes, my brother. I could forgive you if your treachery were against me and not my subjects. I banish you and your followers from England for the remainder of my lifetime. Take them away. See that they leave England. I further banish from my realm all injustices and oppressions... ...which have burdened my people. And I pray that under my rule... ...Normans and Saxons alike will share the rights of Englishmen. Long live Richard the Lion-Heart! What about you, Robin? My sword is yours, sire, now and always. Is there nothing the king can grant the outlaw... ...who showed him his duty to his country? Yes, Your Majesty, a pardon for the men of Sherwood. Granted with all my heart. Long live Richard the Lion-Heart! But is there nothing for yourself? There's but one thing else, sire. And do you too wish...? More than anything in the world, sire. Kneel, Robin Hood. Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley, Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham... ...and lord of all the lands and manors appertaining thereto. My first command to you, my lord earl... ...is to take in marriage the hand of the Lady Marian. Long live Robin Hood! Long live Robin Hood! Long live Lady Marian! And what say you to that, Baron of Locksley? May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, As mayor of West Rome, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you. And to introduce our first citizen. Warren Finley Cooper. Thank you, mayor. Friends, Romans, countrymen. Lend me your ears. You see, I know my Roman history. In fact, I have humbly donated this expensive, magnificent temple of Roman art. That the citizens of West Rome may become familiar with the citizen of historic Rome. Come, ladies. Now, uh, this room, ladies is chiefly devoted to the period in which Rome invaded Britain. Over here we have a particularly interesting.. - Fox. - Yes, sir? Is that your hat? No, sir, I, uh.. Careless fool. Now over here, we have.. How did that get there? - You see, sir, I... - Take it away. Yes, sir. I-I-I'll remove it at once, sir. Yes, you'd better before I have you removed. You'll hear more about this later. And over here we have the statue of Empress Agrippa. - Oh! - Eddie! Why, what's the meaning of this? - You can't sleep here. - It is a bit noisy. You see, sir, he has no place to sleep. - Why you... - It isn't his fault. This is the first morning he forget to wake me up. The idea, using the statue of a Roman Empress for a bed? Well, it's the only statue lying down, sir. You see, I can't sleep standing up. The fellow is crazy! Call the wagon! - Yes, sir. - You can't arrest him, Warren. - It's Eddie. - I know who it is. But he has no right to be around town doing nothing. He works for everybody. Just now he's helping out in Keep's Grocery. Oh, please forgive him, Mr. Cooper. He has such honest eyes. Where did you get those big eyes? Well, they say before I was born my mother was always looking for my father. That's why my eyes are so big. Oh, isn't that too bad? Tell me, did she find your father? I don't know. I can't find my mother. Oh, the poor dear. You must forgive him, Mr. Cooper. Well, alright. Get your clothes on. Get out of here. Well, a character like Eddie happens in every town. He knows nothing. Absolutely nothing. Here we have a statue of one of the last of the Caesars 'the Emperor Valonius.' Valerius. Valonius and don't interrupt me. But Mr. Cooper, it's Valerius. I know. The Empress Agrippa, the one I was sleeping with is his wife. - Idiot. - But, Mr. Cooper, he's right. - It's Valerius. - Really? Why, of course. You were right. But if I hear another word out of you I'll have you locked up. Yes, sir. Let us proceed. Well, this is the last straw! No, sir, this is my hot water bottle I've been looking all over for it. If you say another word, I'll have Fox call the wagon. The wagon. Yes, sir. Ladies, this statue has the most interesting history. It's the Empress Silvia. - Unh-unh. - Of Gaul. - Unh-unh. - Who captured Valerius. - And later married him. - Unh-unh-unh. What is the matter with you? I suppose I'm wrong again! No, no, no, no, you're right, Mr. Cooper, except it wasn't the Empress Silvia, it was the Princess Silvia. She didn't from Gaul, she came from Britain She didn't capture Valerius, Valerius captured her and didn't marry Valerius, she married Josephus and your name is Mr. Cooper and Bob.. - Yes? - The wagon. I wanna talk with you. Now, Eddie, if you wanna keep on making deliveries for me you got to stop giving my groceries away for nothing. Well, you charge it against my salary, don't you? Sure I do. That's why you never have any salary coming. Do you realize that last week you gave away.. Wait, I give it to you black and white. Look! You gave away $14 and 50 cents worth of groceries. This is $12 and 50 cents more than your salary. What are you gonna do about it? Couldn't you raise my salary? - You're lucky I don't fire you. - Yes, sir. - Is this my property?"" - Yes. The city condemned that entire block. Why aren't those people out? Well, the sheriff served notice on them but they refused to move. But they know that I'm gonna build a new jail and donate it to the city, don't they? - Yes, but... - There are no buts. Civic progress. Have them evicted at once. By the way, boys we came out alright on the museum. I donated the land but I'll split with the contractors making us just three times what the property cost. Here's your check, Charlie. - Harry. - Thanks. We really don't need a new jail, Warren. 'Well, you can fill it, a smart chief of police like you.' You, uh, think it's safe to give us these checks? Well, I own the bank, don't I? Look at that, Julia, my fourth seven in a row. I owe myself $265. This is my lucky day. Oh, so, it's you again, eh? Now I oughta put you in jail for reckless driving. Don't arrest him, chief, Eddie's harmless. He never really had a chance. Well, have I had any more chance? I started in this town with nothing, but my brains. It was a bad start. Why? Well, we haven't got time to bother with you now. Come on. Oh, chief! Well, I guess they finished our job. They're all moved out now. Come on, Bill. Okay, chief. What is this? What are you doing? Waiting for an earthquake? The city's taking away our home. The city? Why? They're gonna build a jail here. - A jail? - Yeah! What are we gonna do, ma? I don't know, darling, we can't very well live in the street. Why not? It seems to be well furnished. Look, the city put you here, well, you stay here until the city put you somewhere else. What's he sayin'? He said the city put us here and we should live here. He said the city put us here and we should live here. Come here, everybody. Come here. Listen to me. Why not live out here? What's the matter with the sky for a ceiling? But Eddie, how can we live out here? Just as you lived inside. But out here you'll have more fresh air more help and more flies. But it could be done. Look! Don't you believe in signs? You see? Even Mr. Cooper says it's a good idea. Build a little home. You have everything here.  We always have a roof above us   As long as there's a sky  And if we have someone to love us   We're sure of getting by  You don't need a lot of log and stone   Build a home on happiness   Alone   With a million little stars   We can decorate the ceiling   With an optimistic feeling   When we build a little home   Every single little dream   Is a single roll of rafter  We can paint the house with laughter   When we build a little home   It's not a palace   Or a poor house  But the rent is absolutely free  This is my house but it's your house   If you come and live with me   With a carpet on the floor   Made of buttercups and clover   All our troubles will be over   When we build a little home  Look, I'll show you! This can be the dining room this can be the living room. Come on, help me with the couch, will you?  With a million little stars   We can decorate the ceiling   With an optimistic feeling   When we build a little home   Every single little dream   Is a single roll of rafter  We can paint the house with laughter   It's not a palace   Or a poor house  But the rent is absolutely free  This is my house but it's your house   If you come and live with me   With a carpet on the floor   Made of buttercups and clover   All our troubles will be over   When we build a little home   With a million little stars   We can decorate the ceiling   With an optimistic feeling   When we build a little home   Every single little dream   Is a single roll of rafter  We can paint the house with laughter   When we build a little home   It's not a palace   Or a poor house.  But the rent is absolutely free  This is my house but it's your house   If you come and live with me   With a carpet on the floor   Made of buttercups and clover   All our troubles will be over   When we build a little home  Here, here, what's going on here? - You can't do this! - Why not? - We're only building a home. - A home? Sure, everybody is doing it, come on and join in.  It's not a palace   Or a poor house  But the rent is absolutely free  This is my house but it's your house   If you come and live with me   With a carpet on the floor   Made of buttercups and clover   All our troubles will be over   When we build a little home  Stop this nonsense! Mr. Cooper, you're just in time for dinner. I warned you to keep out of my way. My good friends I sacrificed to buy this property and why. A year from now, where those buildings stand you'll see a grand new jail. Say, the old jail was good enough for your father it ought to be good enough for you. What? You think you're a great man, but look what you do. You built homes for statues and criminals and put these people out on the street. Mr. Cooper, you're, you're.. You took the words right out of my mouth. That's enough, this time it's final. - Call the wagon. - Never mind. - I can walk. - Alright, you walk. Walk him to the city limits, and throw him out. Come on. Can I please say goodbye to Julian? Go ahead. Goodbye, Julian. They're throwing me out because I told the truth. Cooper, that big floor flusher. He compares West Rome to ancient Rome. Rome, that was a real place. They knew how to treat people there. Well, here we are. Where am I going? Where am I going to live? Why don't you go back to ancient Rome. You're always talking about it. I wish I could. They didn't put people out on a street in Rome. Send us a telegram when you get there. Sure, we'll come up and see you some time. Get going. Rome. There was a city. Rome. Rome. Rome. Rome. Rome. Rome. Rome. Hey! Why don't you blow your horn? Hail, brother. Hello, fellas. Where's the circus? Down this road and straight ahead. Oh, I thought for a minute.. - What circus is it? - The Circus Maximus, of course. Maximus.. Not Ringling Brothers? Are you bound for Rome? No, I was just thrown out.. I mean, I just left there. Have they heard of our glorious victory over the Bretons? - They lost their shirts. - Yeah, but they got your pants. Look, why don't you boys run back into the dressing room and put them on, huh? Is it thus you greet the soldiers of Emperor Valerius? Me thinks thou art a spy. - Me thinks thou art nuts. - Nuts? Yes, I'm giving you the raspberry. Nuts, raspberry, perhaps he's a food vendor. Well, I used to help out at Keeps grocery but when Cooper saw me with Agrippa. The Empress Agrippa? You know her? Do I know her.. Where do you think I sleep nights? What? He insults Her Imperial Majesty. And by the Gods, he shall die. Hey, this guy is alright, he can act. Hey, look out with that thing, you know you almost cut me then? - Stop! - Let him die like a Roman. With steel in his hand. - And steel in his heart. - Listen you! Keep on playing with those knives the first thing you know you'll hurt somebody. Look at the point of that thing. Look at it. How would you like to have me poking at you like that? Huh? Here. You play with him. And we'll watch. The coward will not fight. Boil him in oil. - Cut his head out. - Let him go. Hold your tongue! Well, it seems kinda silly but if you want me to do it, I'll do it. Tie him to that stake. He will make a worthy target for our arrows. - A good laid plan. - Yeah, what's so good about it? Wait a minute, you can't now, get me around like this. What do you think you're doing? Wait a minute. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Big boys like you playing Indian. If you guys are trying to scare me.. Yes. You're going fine. Oh! Don't worry, whiskers. I can fix it. See, I've got some string here in my pocket. My pockets are gone. My pants are gone. Good heavens! Help! You mean, this is no fooling? I'm really living in Rome? Yes, but not for long. But wait a minute! If this is really Rome, you can't kill me. Oh, no? No, 'cause I haven't been born yet. It would not only be murder, it would be birth control. Say! Wait a minute! Well.. Help! Help! Help! Hail, Josephus, friend of the people. Well, what manner of game is this? It ain't post office, friend of the people. This fellow is a spy. - He is a traitor. - It's your turn now. This dog maligned the Empress Agrippa. Oh, I did not, all I said was I used to sleep beside her at... Enough! This is blasphemy! Death is too good for him. Take him to the slave market. I'd be much much more useful around the fish market. - I used to work for... - Silence! You will be sold to the highest bidder. Perhaps, I'll buy you myself if only to let you feel my whip. Save your money, I can feel it here. At the slave market! - Hah! - Yuu, ya, ya! Well, what am I bid for this sturdy little captive? What am I bid? Ladies, please don't touch unless you're gonna buy. And don't buy. Isn't anybody gonna bid? What, nobody? Well, if nobody wants me I might as well go home. Slaves who are not sold are thrown to the lions. To the lions? Well, what are you waiting for? Let's have a bid. Yeah. Come, come, citizens. What am I offered for this slave? Well, somebody say five dinars? Do I hear five dinars? I don't even hear four dinars. What's the matter with you people? 'Don't you know a bargain when you see one?' Well, somebody make a bid. Look at me. I can cook a little. I can take care of the children. If there are no children, I can take care of that by being a son to you. Doesn't anybody want him? Doesn't anybody want me? It looks like you're going to the lions. Oh, come people, you may never get a chance like this again. I can sing.  All of me   Why not take all of me  - What about this - Look, I can dance. - Take him to the lions! - 100 pifix. 100 pifix. You, oh, mister, you'll never be sorry for this. Tell me, how much is the 100 pifix. One tenth of one gold dollar. Why that's ten cents, what do you think this is, wool wear? Silence! 100 pifix has been bid. - Do I hear more? - One gold dinars. Say, one gold dinars, that's more like it. The dinars is bid by Josephus. Who? Oh, please, mister, don't sell me to him. He wants to whip me. He told me so. One dinars's bid, one dinars's bid. Why don't you sell me to the man with the pifix after all he spoke first. - Pifix are not bad. - One dinars's bid. - Do I hear two? - Look! Look, people, look what you can get f-for two dinars. Look at these skins, imported. - All the way from Russia. - One dinars's bid. One dinars, one dinars. One dinars, one dinars. If I throw in two pair of pants, will you take me? Going to Josephus for one dinars. - Going, going.. - 'Two dinars!' Two dinars! Who bid that? - Somebody over there. - Two dinars a bid! - Three dinars! - Three dinars a bid! - Four dinars! - Four dinars.. - Who bid that four dinars? - Same fella. - Four dinars a bid! - Five dinars! Five dinars! Now let me hear another dinars. Dinar is there anything finer?  - Silence! - Ooh! Ooh! What do I hear? You just heard me saying dinars. Going to Josephus for five dinars! - Going! Going!... - Six dinars! Wrap me up. - Who bid that? - I did.. 'Six dinars a bid.' But, lady, you're just throwing your money away. I'm weak, I can't do any work. I'm not buying you for work. That's just what I was afraid of. 'Six dinars's a bid, do I hear seven?' Listen, buddy, why don't you bid seven dinars? Why the gold in my teeth is worth more than that, see? - Seven dinars. - 'Seven dinars a bid.' - Eight dinars. - 'Eight dinars a bid.' 'Eight dinars a bid, eight dinars a bid, do I hear nine?' No more bid? Alright. Going to the lady for eight dinars. - Going! Going! - What about you. Or you? Mr. Josephus, please, buy me. You can even whip me on my day off. - Ten dinars! - Ten dinars! Going for ten dinars! Going! Going! Going.. Gone. You understand, Olga? Yes, I understand. Wait for me below.  Through the ages   Comes a cry   A woman's cry of despair   Others know it so do I   Oh why did you   Make me cry?   No more sun   In the sky above   Clouds are all I see   There's no more love   In your heart for me   No more birds   Sing their melody   In the willow tree   There's no more love   In your heart for me   No more arms   Hold me tenderly   You are a memory   There's no more love   In your heart   For me   No more arms   Hold me tenderly   You're a memory   There's no more love   In your heart   For me  Have you ever been lashed before, slave? Oh, yes, when I was a kid. Where was that, slave? In the regular place, you know? Well, do you want me to cross your knees? No, I'm not going to whip you. - You're not? - No. Oh, well, then I won't need this. - Hail, Majordomo. - Hail, Marcius. You are a strange fella. I like you. I like you too. But maybe you better let me hold the whip. Oh, that's my chariot whip. Watch. Say, you're a good whipper snapper. Look, could you please let me try it once? - Go ahead. - I just like to try it once. Now you are in trouble. That's the emperor's Majordomo. You dog, I'll have you whipped without an inch of your life for this. I assure you it was an accident. Do you never tire feeding the cause of others? I'm afraid not. Well, the emperor is tired of it, Josephus. If you can take a warning. Gee, thanks a lot. You know, I couldn't have hit him with this thing if I wanted to. All I tried to do was to crack it like this. Well, what are we waiting for? Josephus, our friend. See, everybody seems to be crazy about you here, you know. I like being your slave. You are no longer my slave. No? I guess I'm just a failure, I can't even keep a job as a slave. Oh, I bought you to set you free. Don't throw away the price tag you won't be able to get a refund. Tell me what's your name? - Eddie. - Oh, there's no such name. - I'll call you Oedipus. - Alright, I'll call you Joe. Make way for the emperor! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! When are they going to say ""The gang's all here?"" Hail! Hail! What good are these conquests? - They only mean higher taxes. - Yeah. Josephus, it's an outrage. The emperor parades while we starve. Be patient, my friend. Our day will come. We'll put an end to his tyranny if necessary by force. Look, Joe, a girl. Who is that? It's the Princess Silvia of Britain. A prisoner of war. Why doesn't the emperor let her ride? Only the emperor can ride in the emperor's chariot. Yeah, why doesn't he get a chariot with a rumble seat? Hey, Valerius, you can't treat her like that. Valerius! Valerius! - Take him to the dungeons. - Yeah, take him to the dungeon. Who's got the boar? These wars exhaust me, Domo. I need some relaxation. Have Olga come and sing for me. Olga was sold today in the slave market by your Majesty's command. No, no, Domo. I said depose her. Not dispose of her. Olga has long been my favorite, Olga loves me. True, she has slipped a little, but we must not be ungrateful. You must find some reward for her devotion. Yes, Your Majesty. I have it, she should be made slave to my new favorite. Who better than Olga can tell her what to do? Or more important, what not to do. Meaning, of course, the Princess Silvia. Don't hurry me, Domo. - I know you. - You do? Yes, you are the man I just saw the soldiers bring in here. I know you very well. Too bad you didn't see them arrest me we might have been relatives. Who are those guys? They are the emperor's torturers. They twist your spine and bend your bones. Oh, chiropractors. They torture their victims with hot irons and fire. Oh, come, come, come it isn't as funny as all that. Oh, to me, all life is comedy. I have found the secret of eternal laughter. There is a legend of the gods that a volcano is but a mountain bursting with laughter at the world. I suppose an earthquake is just a giggle. Yeah, from such a mountain I have gathered what no one else in the world possesses. I have lava gas. Oh, you'll be alright. Take a little bicarbonate of soda... Uh, no, no, no. One whiff of this lava gas and you will roar with laughter even though you're suffering. You mean to say if I just take one whiff of this I'll burst right out laughing. - Yes. Yes. - I'd like to try, then. No, only when you are suffering. Oh. What's that? Hungry lions in the next cell. Oh, I'd like to feed them. You will. I guess he laughed himself out. This cell is empty. Wait here. The rest go down there. Stop. Why can't I go with my people? It's the emperor's command. Princess, I'm frightened. Yes, I know. But we mustn't let the Romans know it. In there. Princess, Princess! Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Wasn't it you who tried to save me? Well, I did kinda wanna talk to Valerius about you. Then it's my fault you're here. No, Princess. I'm always in trouble. But don't worry, we won't be here long. Josephus will get us out. Josephus? Who is he? He's my boss. Remember during the parade when you were looking at me? Yes. Well, he was standing right next to me. But I guess you didn't see him on the account of looking at me. - Oedipus! - Joe! Quick, Your Highness, there's no time to lose. - I've come to free you. - It's Joe, Josephus. The man I've been telling you about. What about the guard, Joe? A bribe has made him a friend. Why are you doing this for me? To gain your favor, I'd give my life. - Merely for my favor? - Willing. Take it. It's a bargain. You must hurry, Your Highness. Come, Oedipus. Joe, I can't go with you. I've gotten sort of attached to this place. Get the the key for this. Josephus! The emperor. - Tell him we're out. - You must go. I'll be back. Josephus. Your Majesty. You did not tell me that Josephus was my prisoner. Your Majesty, I'm here to see my slave who has been unjustly imprisoned. You've crossed my path to often, Josephus. I advise you to leave unless you care to stay here permanently. Are you quite comfortable here, Your Highness? Quite, Your Majesty. I only hope that someday I shall be able to entertain you as comfortably. I believe you'll find my palace more restful. I prefer it here. So be it. I take pride in my conquest of the heart. I cannot desire you unless you desire me. Therefore, I should keep you imprisoned here until you do desire me. 'What a lover!' Who said that? I did. And that's not all I'm gonna say. I want to tell you a few words, perhaps.. Who is this slave? He is the dog that tried to attack you during the procession. - I didn't. I merely... - Silence! Before that, he attacked me with a whip. - A horse whip! - That was only one I had. 'Gag the dog!' And now, my dear. Doesn't it flatter you to know that of all the lovely ladies in the Rome I have chosen the Britain for my favorite? I prefer your alliance. I wonder if your countrymen down the corridor have the same preference? - You wouldn't dare.. - Why not? - Come, Domo. - Wait. If I got to your palace.. ...do you promise no harm will come to my countrymen? On my honor. Domo, escort the princess to the palace. And now, put this dog to the torture. And when he's screaming in agony I should come back and enjoy his suffering. You boys leaving? Nice development. - The hot iron! - Make mine cold. Oh! - Much hotter. - Listen, boys. Why can't we talk this thing over? Please, sit down. Just sit down. Let's... Oh! I'll tear you to pieces for this. Honest, mister, I didn't mean it. I feel terribly sorry if I hurt you. Think it's funny, huh? We'll show you. Oh, boys! You're killing me. Oh, you're breaking my arm. Suppposing, I was your own brother. I have no brother. He died last week. Let's chain him and put the hot irons.. ...against his feet. I bet it'd be horribly painful. It will probably cripple you. What is the meaning of this.. I come to watch a slave suffer torture and I hear him laughing. But I am suffering, Your Majesty. Enough of this nonsense! Give him the hot irons! But slowly. 'Closer. Closer.' Now, we'll get some screaming. You fools! You'll die for this. We are sorry, Your Majesty. You sat down on the.. You dare laugh.. ...when your emperor is wounded? But Valerius, you're laughing too! So I am. It's the first time in years. Release him! You shall live, slave. Did you hear that, boys? - As long as you can amuse me. - Yeah. Don't go away, fellas. I might be back any minute. You have a nice war, Valerius? Hmm, rather dull. The weather was warm and the mosquitos were terrible. It's wonderful, my dear having you home again. Thank you, Agrippa. Come, let us drink to our undying love. By all means. - Your health, me dear. - My health? May I keep it always. Always. Food taster. Oh, Valerius! This is horrible to think it might have been you! There, there, my dear. Do not let it disturb you. Perhaps you'll have better luck the next time. - Has there been an accident? - No. Something he ate, no doubt. Oh, you'd love America. And have we got a traffic system with all kinds of lights. Take for instance a man wants to cross the street but he can't do it because the red light is against them. Well, he couldn't do it anyway two policemen are watching him. They've got burglars all over towns speakeasy, people are killing each other but the police have got to see that he doesn't cross the street. Well? When the police aren't looking he sneaks over as far as the safety zone. What's that? That's where the people wait for a street car. They have a white line. It's called the safety zone. And is that a good idea! Phew! If an automobile should hit you while you're within the safety zone, that doesn't count. It's gotta go all the way around and hit you again. Yes, but what about this man? Oh, he gets hit in the front by a truck, in the back by a street car. But he gets there, even if he has to go in an ambulance. 'Where is he going?' To the movies to see ""Mickey Mouse."" - ""Mickey Mouse?"" - 'Sure.' 'Mickey Mouse and his sweetheart, Minnie.' A mouse has a sweetheart? 'And is she a mouse too?' Sure. Otherwise it would be very inconvenient. And when Mickey goes to see Minnie what do you think Minnie is doing? Well, what is she doing?  There was Minnie   Kicking the gong   Around  Oh! See, give me those. - They're my lucky dice! - Lucky? Let me see those cubes. Do you mean to, you've, uh never seen a dice before? Never. Oh, emperor, are we going to have fun? Come on, I'll shoot you for five dinars. You'll shoot your emperor for five dinars? Alright. I'll shoot you for three dinars. - Why... - I mean with the dice. - Oh, oh! - Come on now. Let's see if you're lucky. If-if I win, that's a good sign. If you win, that's a miracle. Come on, seven! 'It's a natural.' 'Oh, dice' 'be good to me.' 'Huh!' Twelve is my point. It's a little tough. But I'll make it. - I win. - Oh, no, no. Just a moment. You lose. 12 was your point. You threw a three and a four. Well, three times four is 12. Isn't it? Well, now let's see how we stand. You owe me the Colosseum and the forum and the Major Domo. Remember? I won him when I rolled a nine. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll give you back everything.. ...that I've won. You will? And I'll tell you what're you gonna do for me. What? You can free the Princess Sylvia. You seem much interested in my prisoner. I am, Your Majesty. I'm crazy about her. Oh, you are? 'How would you like to be the official food taster?' I find myself in need of a food taster. You mean all I have to do is just eat? Exactly. You eat the same food I eat. Only you eat it first. 'Say, that job sounds alright.' But I'd like to ask you one question. - What's that? - Do you like spinach? No. Well, in that case I can go to work right away. Ah, the wine! Your Majesty, this is the last glass of your favorite wine. Hmm, that's a pity. This wine has given me much pleasure. - Taste, Oediphus. - Alright. I don't mind if I do. I would say, uh.. Well, well? Don't hurry me. I may be right. And then.. ...I may be wrong. I was wrong. It's good stuff. - Josephus! - Shh. Find Sylvia. I've come to take her away. Wait here. - Sylvia! - This is madness. - You must go. - And you're coming with me. I can't let you do this. If you're caught, it means certain death. Oh, Josephus, I love you. If you love me come with me. Double the guards about these gardens. And the next time, shoot to kill. Manius bring me Oediphus, the new food taster. What do you want him for? He's in love with the Princess Sylvia. And therefore, should hate the emperor. 'Valerius must be poisoned.' He could be very useful Hello! Hello! Hello! Are you the new food taster? You want something tasted? The empress wants to see you in her chambers. Does the emperor know about this? What the emperor doesn't know won't hurt him. Yes, but what he will know might cripple me. Come. Oediphus. 'Oediphus.' 'Don't be afraid.' What's the matter, empress? Don't you feel well? I don't feel so good myself. I've got hiccups. Sit beside me, Oediphus. - Let me hold your hand. - No. No. You'll start out by holding my hand and pretty soon you'll wanna shuffle the whole deck. Why are you so cold? Maybe it's these clothes. I'm not used to 'em. Excuse me. Oediphus. You'll wear something out doing that. Have you ever been fired by passion? No, but I've been fired by everybody else. Tell me about your country. What do they know about.. ...love? Well, enough to keep things going. We're still building schools. Show me... show me. I'm sorry. I'll tell you what. You scare me. That'll stop it. Listen to me, Oediphus. Tonight the emperor is going to be poisoned. Why should that scare me? See? He's going to be poisoned... by you. That did it, you notice? It stopped. No. It didn't work. - See here, Oedipus. - Wait a minute. I think I can scare myself better. Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Here. They got me. I've been attacked. - We're amongst enemies. - Oh, Oedipus. Look, no more hiccups. I scared myself good, huh? Well, thanks for trying. Wait. What about the poison? Look, you don't have to scare me anymore. - They're gone now. - Stop wasting time. Listen, in a few hours the Princess Sylvia is dining with the emperor. The princess is in great danger. You can save her, Oedipus.. ...by poisoning the emperor at the banquet. Your own husband? Why, that's murder, isn't it? Listen, Mrs. Valerius, of course, it isn't my business but you're not being a very good wife. - You dare? - Yes. Your husband works hard all day to give you a nice house and fine clothes he comes home at night tired and hungry and what does he get for his supper? Poison. Five food tasters are dead because they were afraid to carry out my plans. I'm... not afraid. - I think you are. - No. Really. I'm not scared. See? I command that you leave Rome by tomorrow never to return. At Ostia, a boat will be waiting to carry you to Carthage. See that you do not miss that boat. Take him away. Joe! May I say goodbye to my friend? Goodbye? Why, you haven't said hello yet. Oedipus, I'm leaving Rome forever. You're leaving? Do you have to? The emperor has banished me. Well, he can't get away with that. The people love you, Joe. They won't stand for it. The people will do nothing against Valerius until they have definite proof of his dishonesty. Oh, I'd give my right arm if I could find such proof. Your right a.. Joe, you're hurt. How did it happen? The emperor. I'm lucky he spared my life. Wouldn't it have been wise, Your Majesty, to have had Josephus killed? The people love him far too much. In the present temper, it would have been dangerous. But do not worry, I've forgotten nothing. Josephus will not bother us again. If they're going to serve poisoned food then Sylvia's in danger. Oh, yeah. I must get to her and warn her. Wait. I can't let you do it for me, Joe. You'd be caught. Besides, I, well, you know, Sylvia and I.. But I must, Oedipus, you see, I love her. You... love her? Yes. My heart throbs for her. My blood tingles, my head's in a whirl. Say, you ought to be in bed. You've got the flu. 'Time's up, Josephus.' But Sylvia.. Don't worry. I'll get to her. Tell her I'll be waiting outside the palace with my chariots. If the plot succeeds, bring her to me quickly the three of us will leave Rome together. If it fails, I'll come for her myself. - And, Oedipus. - Yes? Tell her I love her. Have you seen the Princess Sylvia? - She's in the royal bath. - Through the gardens? Wait! If you go in there, it means death. Doesn't anybody around here ever die of old age? You were told to let no man into these gardens yet Josephus got in. I warn you, don't let it happen again. To your posts! Help! Let go, will you? Hey! You've caught me.. You've caught me by the foot. Hello, major. Fancy meeting you here. I'll kill you for this. It was Oedipus. Get him. I found him trying to get over the garden wall. I've waited a long time for this opportunity. Give him a 100 lashes across the back. But, Your Excellency, it's no use whipping him. He can't be hurt, you know how he laughed when the emperor had him tortured. He's right. You'd just be waiting your time whipping me. Why, when I'm hit all I do is laugh. So you can't be hurt, eh? No. Well, we'll see. See? Ha-ha. I didn't feel anything. - No? - No. Well, I'll try again. Certainly. Help yourself. And this time I'll make sure. Well... when are you gonna hit me? - What? - I told you it was no use. It must be black magic. Black magic. That's what it is. Black magic. But how do you do it, slave? Oh, just plain everyday magic. I've got a certain magic word. - Yes? - Yes. If I say that magic word would it mean that I too could never feel pain? Well, I, uh, no, no.. - What is that magic word? - Oh, I couldn't tell you. You'd go around telling everybody. No, I promise you, I'd never tell anyone. Oppo mopo dopo. Oppo mopo.. Wait! We'll try that. I'll say the magic word and you strike me. No. No, no, no, no thanks. Do as I say! Alright, if you insist, but honestly I wouldn't do this for my own mother. One, two. Ready? Oppo mopo.. Ah! You hurt me. - I felt that. - Sure you felt it. You see, I said ""Oppo mopo dopo"" and what did you say? - What did I say? - You see? You don't even know yourself. Come, come, come. I'll get it this time. Yeah? You'll get it. One, two. Ready? Oppo mopo.. Uh! Why, you! I know just exactly what you're gonna say. You felt it again, sure you did. You see? You put the accent on ""Oppo"" instead of putting it on ""Mopo,"" you dopo. - Yes? - Yes. Well, perhaps I'd learn more quickly if I saw you struck again. Oh, no, no, no, no... Guard, you strike him while I listen. And strike him as hard as you can. Oh, but, but listen, it-it-it's silly. How can you learn if I'm gonna do the practicing? Besides, I don't feel anything. Strike him! See? I didn't feel a thing. Sylvia? Oh, yes. This mud is absolutely wonderful. Take this little girl right here. Why, she's only had two treatments and already you wouldn't recognize her. A man in here? I must find him. There, it's all finished. Now keep perfectly quiet. Who are you? - You don't know who I am? - No. Oh, am I glad... to meet you. Oh. Aren't you the Ethiopian.. - Ethiopian. Beauty. Specialist. - Beauty. Specialist. You sure guessed it, that's what I is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! And the emperor sent me down here to kinda look after the Princess Sylvia. Oh, I see. Slave. I'll have you taken to her. Show the doctor to the Princess Sylvia's compartment. Thank you, miss. Sylvia, I have an important message for you from Josephus. From Josephus? Oh, quick, give it to me. Don't eat anything at the emperor's banquet. - Why not. - Never mind. Just lay off the food I'll bring an ice-cream soda later. What of Josephus? Is he safe? He's okay, and he's waiting to take you to Ostia right after the banquet. Oh, thank the gods. I almost forgot. - He told me to tell you.. - Yes? He said he loves you. And I think he means it because he was feeling terrible. Doctor, we just heard you were here. Yes, doctor, can you give us some beauty hints? Well, all I can tell you is.. Athletics cosmetics a weighing machine  Are part of the feminine routine for what?

But, Your Majesty, these taxes will amount to millions of dinars more than your palace will cost. Exactly, if the bill is passed you will share in those millions. You promised us that when we voted on the taxes for the Colosseum. And the Circus Maximus. And we're still waiting for our money. This time I promise it before the gods. I should be for it before we pass the bill. The emperor can do no wrong. So great a truth should be in writing. Also your promise. Then you shall have it in writing for after all, don't we trust each other? Oh. - Oh.. - Who are you? - Idiot. - A fool! I'm pleased to meet you. Have you no respect for senators? Say, boys, you dropped something. Say.. Just like all senators, never listen to the people. Say... Joe might be able to use this. Goodbye. It's been fun knowin' you. Come, Oedipus. Your Majesty, my kitchen is honored. - Is everything in readiness? - Yes, Your Majesty. - Mm, squabs, I love 'em. - Careful. There's enough poison in one of those nightingale to kill 50 men. No wonder the poor little thing is dead. At the banquet, Oedipus, you will be able to eat one of these nightingales. Thank you very much, but I'm on a diet. My doctor has forbidden me any poison. Only one contains the poison. And that one.. ...is for the emperor. - The emperor. - The emperor. Long may he live. Listen closely, Oedipus for the banquet, the emperor has ordered these nightingales his favorite food. When the dish is passed you would take the one without the pasley for the one without the pasley is the one without the poison. In a few hours, I should be the supreme ruler of Rome and you, Oedipus, will be the most popular man... In the cemetery. When I'm ruler, you shall have a province at Egypt. Egypt. What I have always wanted. Remember, Oedipus, the one without the pasley is the one without the poison, there must be no mistake. You're telling me the one without the pasley is the one without the poison. The one without the pasley is the one without the pasl.. No. The one without the pasley is the one without the poison. Come, Oedipus. The one without the pasley is the one without the poisley. The one without the p.. The one without the pa.. The one without the pa.. The one without the poison is the one without the pasley.. Egypt. Egypt. There, I can feed my wife to the crocodiles. The one without the pasley.. The one without. The one without the pasley is the one without the poison. The one without the pasley is the one without the poison. The one without the pasley is the one without the poi.. Let the banquet begin. Where is my food taster? Where is Oedipus? - Oedipus! - Oedipus! - Oedipus! - Oedipus! Did, uh, someone call me? Am I late? I must be late. - You going to bed already. - Oedipus, I... I know just what you gonna say. I'm fired and you're absolutely right. If a fella can't get to work on time he doesn't deserve to hold the job. I hope this will teach me a lesson. Good bye. Wait. I forgive you, Oedipus. What's more? I have a special treat for you. Double nightingales. I don't deserve it. Double nightingales is my favorite dish. Somehow I never seem to get enough of them. You'll get enough of them. - What's that? - My lunch. A hot dogs and the pickle. Domo, get the mustard. You are my food taster and you eat what I eat. Oh! What are you doing? Hey, wait a minute. That frank would've cost me four pifix. Oop! Oww! Oh! - Now what? - He wanted to bite me. - How do you know? - Because he bit me. She won't harm you. That's Cleopatra, the royal crocodile. Well, Cleopatra's made her mark. She almost tore my toga. Go away. Shoo! Scram. Careful, slave, Cleopatra's of royal descent. Well, she doesn't behave like it. Biting people's togas. - The nightingales. - The nightingales. - The nightingales. - The nightingales. - The nightingales. - The nightingales. 'The nightingales.' Egypt. Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! The one without the pasley.. The one without the pasley is the one without.. We'll wait here, Lucius. Banquet must've started by now. If the plot fails.. By the God to save Silvia, I'll kill the emperor myself. - After you, major. - Drink. - Oedipus, what's wrong? - What's the matter? Oh, I've got a pain, maybe it's something I'm gonna eat. Is there a doctor in the house? - No. - Well, alright then. I'll run down to his office. It'll be a little cheaper anyway. Taste the nightingales, Oedipus. You call those nightingales? Look, look how tough they are. But don't worry, we have got a dish here that you'll be crazy about. - Cheese blintzes. - Well, I.. - One cheese blintzes. - We have no cheese blintzes. Oedipus, taste. That's food for your stomach but is the food for your soul? No. - Food for the soul? - Yes, food for your soul music. That's what you need.  Listen friends and Romans   Let me have your ears  Would that I were home for just a day  I could settle all my country's cares and fears  I'd call up my president and say  Tax your food your coat and hat   Tax your income tax your flat   We can't do away with that   Put a tax on love   Taxi cab will have a clock   That will register the shock   Of the kisses on each block   Put a tax on love   Every time you go and steal   A moonlight kiss  Mark it down because you're gonna pay for this   Love a little love a lot  Love that's true and love that's not   No excuse that you forgot   Put a tax on love  Break your frigid there and then  Let's go back when men were men   Bring the iceman back again   Put a tax on love   Married couples have no fear  Though at first your tax is dear  It gets less and less each year   Put on tax on love  Crooners on the radio must understand  The both of them have pasley not on yat yat yat  Here's a law that love is in the land would be endorsing  This is bound to stop a lot fighting and divorcing  Sofas in the palace will need lots of reinforcing   Put a tax on love  Stop. I am not amused. - Taste the nightingales. - Alright, if you insist. - What are you doing there? - She's hungry. You see I am your food taster and Cleo is mine. How dare you risk the life of a royal crocodile? Don't you realize that might be poisoned? Do I realize.. It's an even bet. Are you going to eat? Of course, I'm going to eat. I like nightingales. Why I can eat nightingales all day long. You would never make any.. There's something strange going on here. - What do you do about it? - Nothing, I'm a stranger. - Yeah, I just came to... - Send for the chef! Valerius. Valerius. Don't touch those nightingales. - They're poisoned. - What? He did it. He, Silvia and Josephus. They wanna murder you. The chef just confessed. - Oh, for heavens.. - I can believe of Josephus. And this fool would do anything. But I'm sure you must be mistaken about the princess. You're right, she didn't do it. She didn't even know about it. - Just as I thought. - It is true. I wanted you to be destroyed. You and your whole rotten empire. Don't believe her. She had nothing to do with it. Hush! Hush. The child is hysterical. Olga, take her away. You're the bravest man I've ever known. Goodbye, Oedipus. The stairway. Where are you taking me? To Josephus. Oh, Olga. Well, Oedipus, we come to you. Couldn't you skip me? Your Majesty, oughtn't we first to capture Josephus before he leaves the city? I've told you, I've forgotten nothing, Domo. Orders have been given to kill Josephus and anyone who accompanies him. The moment they set foot on the boat in Ostia. You did that to Joe, you double-crossing... - Silence. - Let them speak. These out his last words. Alright, I know all about you, Valerius. You and your racket, you put up palaces and the people put up twice as much as they cost. - And I've got the proof. - Enough! I commend this very day that the food taster, Oedipus, be thrown to the lions and torn limb from limb until he's dead. Now have you anything to say? No, I guess that covers everything. Take him away. Forward! March! Forward! March! Wait here, Lucius, if Olga succeeds bring Oedipus with you. Goodbye, Olga. May the gods protect you. The paper was taken from us by force. Oedipus attacked us in the corridor. So that's where he got his proof. Oedipus. Where's Joe? We've gotta stop him. He and the Princess Silvia have started for Ostia. Silvia too? Oh! We've gotta stop 'em before they get on that boat or they'll be killed. - How far is it, Ostia? - Fourteen miles. Quick. Step on the gas. Oh! Say, how do you stay in this thing? Chain him to the chariot. - Chain me? - Yes. - Your Majesty? - Yes. - Oedipus escaped. - What? Get him immediately. Catch him dead or alive. Take my fastest charioteers, Domo. And remember, your emperor's honor depends upon it. Oedipus the food taster has escaped. One thousand dinars to the man who brings him back dead or alive. Preferably dead. After him! Faster. Faster. We must get to Ostia. Help! Oh, help! Oh! They're after us. Quick! Faster! Faster! Ram him to the wall! Look out! Look out! - After him! - Come on! We've got to stop Joe and Silvia. There they are! Silvia and Joe. Hey, Joe, don't go to Ostia. The emperor, you'll be killed. They're after us. Stay off the road. I'll follow. Lucius? Oh! Oh! Oh-oh! Hey! Look out! Oh! Ow! Whoo! Hey! Hey! Faster, faster! Oh! Oh-oh! Help! Oh! Oh! - What hit me? - You're alright. The wagon hardly touch you. Come on. Oh, no. Let me go. I forgot something. - I've gotta catch Josephus. - Hm. I have the evidence against Valerius. - Here in my toga. - In your what? It's gone. But I had a toga. And I had the letter written by the emperor bribing the senators. What are you talking about? Here. Here is Valerius bribe to the senators. Here it is. No. No. It's Cooper's bribe to the chief of police. Let me look. Eddie, you're coming back to West Rome with me. - 'Twenty years.' - 'He deserves it.' 'It serves him right.' The town oughta be pretty thankful for Eddie. Eddie oughta get a medal. Yes, Sara. We'd still be living in the street if it wasn't for Eddie. Pa! Eddie's coming! Pa! Eddie's coming! Ma!

Okay. Hold everything for a new front page! We're jimmying the Allenbury yarn. Hey, Mack, hold everything. Wait for a makeover. - What happened, Allen? - Don't load anymore. - Hold it, boys. - Unload all of them. We're trying to kill a story. Have any trucks gone out? - How about it, Joe? - Number 7. Call him back. But he's gone. Times Square and Columbus Circle. Rush a motorcycle after him. Hurry up! We've got to get those papers back. Every one. Pete, get on your machine and stop truck number 7. Okay. Phone all the stands on that route not to sell any papers. Are you ringing Haggerty? All right, all right! Try him again. - Go to Haggerty's apartment. 52nd Street... - I know where he lives. Won't he be at church? Isn't he getting married at noon? You grab a taxi to the church. Bring him here. - I can't ruin his wedding. - Then it'll be our funeral. Step on it! Keep on ringing him. Don't answer it. I've had enough gags pulled on me this morning. Maybe Miss Benton again. I'm afraid... You're afraid? I'm marrying her, and you're afraid. That's loyalty. She say before, ""If you're late, she going tear down church."" Even that won't stop it. No, Ching, I promised I'd meet her at the altar at the stroke of 12:00. And there'll be no reprieve from the governor this time. - I hope you'll be very happy. - Yes, said the spider to the fly. - Very pretty. - I'm the groom, not the bride. Take my advice, Ching. Don't ever get married. Maybe not so bad, Mr. Haggerty. My mother and father, they get married. You're kidding. Here's to the last mile. A merry marriage and many happy comebacks. Mr. Haggerty! - What's wrong? - You're wanted at the office right away. Good old governor. Good old office! Run to the church and tell Miss Benton I've been delayed. It's awful to bust up your wedding. Never mind the wedding. Something break? - The story they had to kill. - What story? The London correspondent cabled last night. A swell story on the Allenbury girl. Connie Allenbury? What kind of story? She was mixed up in some scrape at a garden party. Tried to steal another girl's husband. - Not Connie Allenbury? - Yes, sir. All right, what happened? Jackson cabled this morning. It was all a mistake. It was somebody else. She wasn't at the party. And we printed the story? Holy mackerel! Come on. Wait. You said not to stop for anything... but you've got to have your pants. Yeah, yeah. I gotta have my pants. Can't I stay away for one day without somebody pulling a boner? You call yourself a newspaperman. Where's your nose? - My nose? - Yes, your nose! That thing fairly reeks of alcohol! Jackson was drunk. You got to smell things like that. You don't need any brains. All you need is a nose! - I knew the boss hated her father... - And her father hates us! He'd blow us up, and you hand him dynamite. The one girl that we should handle with kid gloves... and you spread her name over the front page! What? - What'll we use for a headline? - I don't care. ""War threatens Europe!"" - Which country? - Flip a nickel! Yes, sir. The boss is here. He wants you right away. Does he want me or my job? Have you got a drink? There's a fresh bottle on your desk. I thought you'd need one. I'll need it, and how. I knew I'd find you with a drink in your hand. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? What? Didn't Ching tell you? Yes, Ching told me, and I told him, and now I'm telling you. I won't stand for it. You can't do this to me, Warren Haggerty. Not to me! First it was a fire at sea. Then it was a kidnapping. - What's the gag this time? - Darling, there's no gag. - The newspaper's made a mistake. - So has little Gladys. Engaged to a newspaperman. Joe Simpson never treated me like this. - Then why did you divorce him? - I've asked myself that many times. Gladdie, after all, you got no kick. I haven't? First, you said a trip to Bermuda. - You went to Bermuda. - But alone. Then it was Europe. If I wait another year, it'll be Little America. I won't. - I tell you, I can't get away. - It's not Europe. It's the church. It only takes 20 minutes to get married. - But, Gladdie, the trip. - I'll take Battery Park. I'm going to take you on the greatest trip a girl ever had... just as soon as we settle the suit. Nothing doing. For two years I played second fiddle to this paper! But the boss is waiting for me. The preacher's waiting, too. Get your hat. I can't go... the paper's in a jam! We're facing a libel suit! You're facing a breach of promise suit! If you don't want to marry me, say so! Gladdie, you're getting yourself all upset, darling. - A little drinkie, maybe? - Not today I don't. Today, I get married! - Well, I... - Didn't they say I wanted to see you? Say, what is this? Do I own a paper or a lunatic asylum? - You just took the words out of my mouth. - Mr. Bane, my future wife. Nonsense! I'll be in my office! Get rid of this woman! Take it easy, that's the owner of the paper. I don't care who he is. Nobody talks to me like a house detective. How do you know how a house detective talks? Don't you think I read? Where are you... No, you don't. If you think that you can... Gladdie, darling. Now, you tell the preacher to wait... and I'll phone you just the minute I'm free, and we'll get married today. Now, that's a promise. Tomorrow at this time, you'll be a married woman. I swear to it. Joe, come here. Will you show Miss Benton to a taxi? And this is supposed to be the happiest day of a girl's life. Yes, ma'am. Why doesn't London answer? I want J. B. Allenbury. This is terrible, Haggerty. - A mistake like that can ruin... - What do the lawyers say? An open-and-shut case. Pure libel and slander. We haven't a leg to stand on. And now, I've got to get on my knees to Jim Allenbury... a man I fought for 20 years, never giving an inch. They're ready with London, Mr. Bane. Wait a minute. Let me talk to him. You know how he hates you. I'll take all the blame. You know nothing, not even that I'm phoning. - Then if I fail... - You mustn't. Tell him it was just a mistake. Maybe he doesn't know anything about it. Only 50 of those papers got away. Hello? Hello, London? Yeah, we're ready. Hello? Hello, Mr. Allenbury? This is Warren Haggerty of the New York Evening Star. You know the Star? Well, I'm sorry you feel that way about us, Mr. Allenbury. Yes. I realize that we've fought in the past... but it's always been a good, clean fight. No. Nothing serious. But the early edition of the paper carried a little item about your daughter. Not that the item was serious at all, but I just thought I'd phone you... Yes. Yes, that's it, exactly. The spirit of fair play. I appreciate that spirit of fair play, Mr. Haggerty... but you see, my office cabled me a copy of your little item. What? Yes, indeed. Hardly what I'd call innocent... but typical of Hollis Bane and everything that his newspaper stands for. No, I'm not interested, Mr. Haggerty. You can discuss that with my attorney. Now, hold on a minute. This is Charles Archibald, of Archibald, Davis, and Wingert. We're filing suit immediately through our New York office. - You'll receive the papers tomorrow. - Just a minute, Mr. Archibald. Don't forget to mention the amount we're suing for. That should interest them. By the way, you might inform your Mr. Bane... Miss Allenbury is asking damages for $5 million. $5 million. She's insane, she's mad. There never has been a libel suit for $5 million. There ain't that much money. She's got all the money in the world now. It's not money they're after. It's the paper. It's me. For 20 years, I've fought Allenbury. Kept him out of the senate. And when they wanted to make him ambassador, I stopped it. - $5 million. - Their chance to strike back, and they are. The paper will go. Look what a lawsuit did to New York Daily last year. That's not going to happen to us. We haven't begun to fight yet. We've been sued before, big suits. They were after money and were glad to settle. Allenbury will settle, too, when we get through with her. Remember the Farrell girl? That was open-and-shut, till we got busy on her. You can't do that here. There's never been a word of scandal about Connie Allenbury. Not yet, but she's human and I'm gonna throw a man at her. You're not suggesting a frame? No. But we've got to get to this girl... and I'm gonna bring in the best man we ever had. Who's that? A guy that will beat anybody in the world... from Gandhi to Garbo. Bill Chandler. Bill Chandler? Yes. Now, you fired him, the best man we ever had on libel. - You admit it, and you fired him. - Yes, and I'd do it again. He was a vain, double-crossing heel. Tried to run the paper. - Thought he knew more about it than I did. - And was right. He's the only man who can swing this case. Get him! I'll have him here in an hour. Long distance. New York calling Mr. Adams... of The Chronicle at Washington, DC. All right, put Haggerty on. Hello, Haggerty. This is Adams of The Washington Chronicle. Chandler left here over a year ago, headed for Denver. Try The Courier. Sure, I know him. Chandler left Denver four months ago. And the boss's wife almost followed him to San Francisco. That guy is dynamite. He worked here, but he wasn't with The Express two weeks... when he quit and left San Francisco. One of the girls here received a Christmas card from Singapore. Anyone in this great settlement knowing the whereabouts of William Chandler... will please communicate with station ZHM, Singapore. Keep the lines open. If anything comes in, let me know. I'll be here. He left Singapore three months ago. How about Australia? I can try Sydney. He was always crazy about the races. Okay, but rush it. Send another SOS to the syndicated press... and cable London and Berlin. - Do anything, but find him. - Maybe that guy's dead. It would be just like him to die at a time like this. Hello. In case you don't know it, it's 2:00 in the morning, and I've been asleep. What do I do? Put the dress in mothballs for another trip? Change it for a straitjacket and order one for me. - You ought to get some sleep, boss. - No. This coffee will fix me up all right. I press suit up quick. Maybe you try him again this afternoon. - Throw him in the nearest ashcan. - One trail leads to Sydney. The other one to Shanghai. Both report the whereabouts of Bill Chandler unknown. Call up that detective agency, see if they can find him. Chandler? You mean Mr. Chandler... - the fellow who used to work here? - Yes. - I know where he is. - What? Sure, he's a good friend of mine. Just last week, he gave me $10 for my mother. - She's been sick. - What's his address? He's at the Grand Plaza. The Grand... No, that can't be the Chandler we want. Don't you mean Bill Chandler... who was always giving you the raspberry? Yeah! That's the fellow! Tell the cable office we found him. - Right under my nose! - Shall I get him? No, I want to talk to him personally, feel him out a little. So he's living at the Grand Plaza. He must be in the money. Warren Haggerty. From Brooklyn to Bombay... a stab in the back spells Haggerty. I never stabbed you in the back, Chandler, and I want... After all, that was a long time ago, and we should... Bury the hatchet. Or was it a knife? - Now get this, Chandler, I didn't knife you. - You only tried to. That was two years ago. We should... - Let bygones be bygones. - Why, sure. Whatever happened... Is all over now. Goodbye. It was nice to see you. Good morning. Cigarettes, please. Give my regards to the boys at the office. You still at the Star? Old man hasn't gotten wise to you yet. Soon, you'll be out on your ear... then the Star will be a first-class sheet. Listen here, Chandler. If you're... By the way, what are you doing for yourself, Bill? I just finished writing a book, Warren. All about my early hardships, the newspaper business... and the rats I met running about. - Lf you mention me in that book... - Sue me for libel. How is the libel these days? You got a good man on the hush stuff? Yeah, we get along. Where did you go when you left us? The intelligence department, Warren. I always did like contrast. Cheerio. - What's your hurry? - Breakfast time. - It can wait. I got an idea. - I'll take breakfast. I want to talk to you. Warren, you weren't like that when I left. - This is a proposition. - Not before breakfast. - I haven't got time for breakfast. - That's too bad. Goodbye. - Good morning, captain. - Good morning, sir. - Table for one. - Table for two. Very well, sir. This way, please. - More coffee, sir? - No, thanks. Now, Warren, what's on your mind? I've been thinking, Bill. After all, you're a darn good newspaperman. Maybe I was a little hasty when I... You don't mean to give me back my job? - That's it. - Wait a minute. You want to talk business? All right, I'll talk. You're in a jam over the Allenbury girl. You printed a hot story and she's suing you. - Who told you? - Elementary, my dear Watson. I read the story. First edition only, carried by no other paper. That, says I, is the fine Italian hand of Haggerty... the bull in the china shop. - What's she asking? - $5 million. Who does she think she is? Just one of the richest girls in America. Yes, I know all about her. Title-crazy, with a fatheaded old father to buy her in and out. America's international playgirl. That's her rep... and she thinks it's worth $5 million. When I get through with her, she'll take five cents. - Done. You're on the payroll. - No, Warren. No philanthropy. During the six months that I was on the Star, I saved you, all told... some $300,000. What did I get? $125 a week. That's the proposition, drawn yesterday. I've been expecting you for 24 hours. $5,000 down and $45,000 more when you... Why, you're crazy. No other reporter gets that much money. It's robbery. All right. Forget it. You read any good books lately? - Now, be reasonable, Bill. - Take it or leave it. Wait a minute. On second thought, I don't want the job at any price. I got all the money I need right now. Look here. I just got this from my publisher... offering to advance me $5,000 for a second book. - Let's just forget about this. - Now, wait a minute. You ought to be arrested for extortion. You must have dropped this, sir. - What is this? - That is a letter. I get it. So your publisher is going to send you a $5,000 advance? $700 behind with the hotel, you mean. - Not now, I'm not. - I knew I was a sap to believe... That's right, you were. But you'll get your money's worth. Now, here's the plan. Allenburys are in London. So I sail for England at once. But they're coming back in 10 days. That's why I'm sailing, to come back with them. Five days on a boat. Anything can happen on a boat. I meet the girl. Perhaps she comes to my cabin... - No. Not this girl. - Only for a cocktail. Perfectly innocent to her, me, and everyone on the boat. Except our private detective, who radios my wife. - You got a wife? - No. This is a setup, not a confession. But we hire some attractive girl to marry me... and when the time comes... she stages a pretty little scene over her erring husband... and sues Connie for alienation of affection. That's it, that's it. The Star called Connie a husband-stealer. She denies it. We duplicate the situation. This time, she does steal a husband. This time, we're right. Let her go to bat with a libel suit and see what she collects. But how about a girl to marry you? Do you know anybody? Now, that's tricky. We've got to find someone we can trust. I've got the girl, the very girl! Hello. What happened to you? Do I want to get married? What do you think? I'll call the preacher right away. The city hall? Then I can't wear my wedding gown. I won't ask any questions. And don't keep me waiting. Tiny? Tiny, come here. I'm so happy. Today is my wedding day. What, again, Miss Gladys? You can't do this to me, Warren Haggerty. Not to me! Let me out of here. For two years, you've had me on a merry-go-round... waiting for that gold ring, but this is where I get off... - and stay off! - Be quiet. I won't be quiet! The things I've taken for that newspaper... but this gets the blue ribbon, trying to marry me off... to that baboon! Let's not deal in personality. But, darling, it's only for a month, maybe less. Then six weeks in Reno. And, Miss Benton, they've got the loveliest place in Reno. You'd love it. You can play craps there every night. That's right, that's right. I'll come the moment you get divorced. But I don't want a divorce. I want to get married and stay married. If you don't want to marry me, say so. Of course I want to marry you, but don't you understand, Gladys? This comes first. It's our only chance. I'll get fired. There isn't a newspaper in the world... that would hire me as an office boy. Would they, Bill? - Not if they know you like I do. - What do you mean? You remember poor Ed Glover? You remember after he lost that libel suit? They found his car gone over a cliff and a revolver in his hand. - Do you want me to kill myself? - Did you change your insurance? Would I ask you to do this thing for me... if I didn't consider you practically my wife? Would you ask your wife to hook up with that ape? The ape objects. Darling, you're not marrying him, really. A wedding ceremony, six hours in a hotel apartment... during which time I'll never leave you, and then he leaves for Europe. - Don't talk to me. I'm leaving. - Wait a minute. I'm leaving. The deal is off. Here's your contract. $50,000. - I wouldn't hook up with her for $1 million. - Now, Bill, you know the spot I'm in. That's your tough luck. You'll have to get a new boy. - You mean you're walking out on him? - That's it, sister. You know what the Star means to him... you're a newspaperman. You know. It'll ruin his life. It'll ruin his career. A fine friend you are. - Lf you put it that way. - I'm putting it that way. - Good. I'll get the guy. - The things I do for that newspaper. ""And I pronounce you man and wife."" Aren't you going to kiss the bride? Yes! Sure. May I? Why not? Everybody else seems to be doing it. Aren't you going to kiss me? Sure, sure. An old friend of the family. Yes. Darling. Very old friend. I hope you'll be very happy... and don't forget to invite me to your silver anniversary. It'll have to be within the next six weeks. Goodbye, and good luck. Goodbye. Good luck to you. - Take his arm. - I'm taking your arm. Yes. Send it up, and send a waiter, please. Right away? Thanks. That's the wire you sent me. There will be a bellboy and a waiter to witness the very tender scene... when we learn that I'm called to Europe. Now, remember, won't you? You're all broken up. He is torn from your arms, the bridegroom of an hour. - That's too long for me. - To my little bride. I hope you choke on it. - Darling. - Don't call me that. You know what my name is. - Of course, Mrs. William Chandler. - I'd just as soon have a number. - Come on, now. You mustn't fight. - Why not? We're married. You're supposed to be happily married. You're supposed to be in love with each other. I must have been crazy to let you marry me off to another guy. But let me tell you this, Warren Haggerty. From now on, you've got to forget the paper and take me places. I can't take you places, you've got to stay in the apartment. You can sew, sleep, and play the radio. - Maybe you could learn to read. - You're not going to take me out? Honey, I can't take you out. You can't be seen running around with another man. You're supposed to be married. You've got to look married. Maybe twins would help. Now, remember, remember. - Yes? - Telegram for Mr. Chandler. - Just wait. Clear the table, please. - Yes, ma'am. Bill, there's a telegram for you. Thanks, sweetness. Would you open it for me, honeykins? Bill. - What is it? - Read it. - What does it say? - It's from the office. ""Lmperative you sail Queen Anne tonight for director's meeting in London. ""Reservations arranged. Anderson will meet you. Bon voyage."" You can't leave me. Bill, you mustn't leave me! Baby, this is terrible, breaking into our honeymoon like this. But what am I to do, honey? I'll have to go. You can't. It's only for a couple of weeks, Mrs. Chandler. But a couple of weeks are a couple of weeks! - I'll miss my little Billikins. - And I'll miss my little fuzzy-face. I'm afraid you'll have to hurry if you're gonna make that boat. Yes, that's right. Here, boy. Just take my grips here. These leather ones are mine. Sure was a lucky thing that I didn't unpack. Waiter, thank you very much. Darling, I'll miss you every minute. Every second! Hold it. They've gone. Save it for the elevator. - Well, for the... - Here comes the elevator. The bride and groom. Darling, I'll miss you every minute. Every second. Goodbye, old man. He's gone. The maid. Why, he'll come back, Mrs. Chandler. - How do you do, Mr. Chandler? - Hello. - Sailing back with us so soon, sir? - I only came to London for three days. - Lf there's anything I can do, sir. - Thank you. Everything is set. Palmer's gonna take the smack. Fine. Tell the boys to lay it on heavy. Here they come. Beat it. I'll see you on the boat. Boys. Here they come now. Chandler says lay it on heavy. Mr. Allenbury, excuse me, sir. There's been a bit of a mix-up on your baggage. - Come with me. - Shall I attend to it? I'd better go with you, Graham. Wait here, Connie. Will you make a statement for the press? Are you suing for L1 million? - What are your chances of winning? - I've nothing to say. Miss Allenbury, you must be able to tell us something. - No, nothing. - Surely, you'll make a statement. Will you please let me go? - You can't afford to ignore the press. - Can't I? Turn her around, Palmer. Take your hands off of me! Watch the dicky bird, ducky. Just a minute. Obviously, the young lady doesn't wish to be photographed. That's none of your affair. Now, clear out, all of you! Hello. Connie, are you all right? Yes, dear, I'm all right. This is an outrage. You men ought to be arrested. We'll fix him. That was William Chandler, the author. - Remember that name, Graham. - Yes, sir. William Chandler. I ought to have charged that blighter L10 instead of L5. Come in. - How do you do? - How do you do? Mr. Allenbury's compliments. Will Mr. Chandler join him for cocktails before dinner? - Mr. Allenbury? - Mr. J.B. Allenbury. The lady you rescued from those reporters today is Mr. Allenbury's daughter. Yes. I'll be delighted to have cocktails with Mr. Allenbury. - 7:30, the Grill Room bar. - 7:30. Thank you. - You rang, sir? - Yes. Steward... do you know if they have any books in the ship's library on angling? - Angling, sir? - Yes. You know, trout fishing? Yes. We have several. Shall I fetch you one, sir? Yes, just bring me all of them. - All of them, sir? - Yes. The best rainbow-trout fishing is found in Lake... Taupo. Lake Taupo, New Zealand. The best rainbow-trout fishing is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Lake Taupo. The best rainbow-trout fishing is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Now, the best rainbow-trout fishing is found in Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Yes. Mr. Allenbury has been delayed by a ship phone call from America... - but he asked that you order. Do sit down. - Thank you. We appreciated what you did this morning. Most unfortunate. - Here's Mr. Allenbury. - Sorry to be late, Mr... - Chandler. - Chandler. Have you ordered? - A dry martini, please. - The same. Now, if you'll excuse me. - Did we hear from the bank? - Complete accounting. And Jennings, shall he meet you in Washington? No, he'd better come to New York and fly down with me. That's the only time that I'll have. Be sure that the plane is ready. - It's ordered for noon. - Good. Now, young man, I want to thank you... for what you did this morning, both for my daughter and myself. - Quick thought on your part. - I rather enjoyed it. As a matter of fact, newspapers and I are not very good friends. One time in Chicago, I sent a reporter to a hospital. - My publishers never forgave me. - Publishers? Yes. I'm a writer. Indeed? Just now, I'm doing some fishing yarns. Really? Yes. Well, Father? Connie, my dear, I wasn't... - I want you to meet Mr... - Chandler. Mr. Chandler. The man who saved your life. Yes, indeed. Thank you so much. I thought you were with those people from Plymouth. I ran out on them. I simply can't be bothered with people you meet on boats. I'm glad that we met on the dock. - A mint frapp. - Yes, miss. I should apologize for the scene I caused. Waiter, never mind. I won't have any. Mr. Charmers... - Chandler. - Mr. Chandler is a writer. How amusing. What do you write? Father, guess who's with us. Mrs. Burns-Norvell, and that dreadful daughter of hers. We elude them in Europe, and now we meet them on the same boat. Now we're in for it. They'll be asking us to dinner. Not if we see them first. I've been ducking them all day. Are you having fun, Mr... My plane. Father, did you cable about my plane? - Leave it in storage. I've chartered one. - But I want my own. I'm dying to feel the stick in my hands again. Do you fly, Mr. Charmers? Chandler. Oh, yes, I've... I've flown across with Lindbergh a couple of times. But my favorite sport is fishing. Sorry, Mr. Allenbury, it's 7:30. Thank you for joining us. If ever we need your help again, I hope you'll be on hand. It's been so nice to see you. Good evening. Here they are, Mother. Connie! Connie, my dear! We've been looking for you all over the boat. My dears! It's so nice to see you both again. Bert will be so pleased that we're crossing together. - How are you, Mrs. Burns-Norvell? - And you're joining us for dinner. I won't take no. It's my birthday, I'll be 21 at midnight. - I'm very sorry. - No, no excuses. We'd love to, but you see, Connie... I'm sorry if I'm late, J.B., but I had to send a very important wire. Shall we go in to dinner now? - Yes. - We're dining with Mr. Charmers. Mrs. Burns-Norvell and her daughter, Barbara. How do you do? Can't we all have dinner together? - They're going to talk business. - Yes. You see, I'm a writer... and Mr. Allenbury and I are doing a book together. But too wonderful! You must tell me all about it tomorrow. - I'm always up for lunch. - Yes. Well, we're indebted to you again. Thanks. That was fast thinking. I suppose we'll have to have dinner together now. Shall we? Three, sir? Father, you're in luck. Your favorite fish, brook trout. Do you care for trout? Do I care for trout? The one thing in the world that I care for is trout... in any shape or form. Especially on the end of a line. You're an angler? I'm on my way now to Glen Arden... all set to prove they'll rise to a Parmacheene Belle. No, not this early. A Royal Coachman, perhaps. Or maybe a Pink Lady by visible, but not a Parmacheene Belle. - I've caught them. - Not at Glen Arden. I know. I've fished Glen Arden. I've tried it. Father... shall we say trout? What a sport. To feel the trout on your line... to play him, to reel him in. - There's no thrill in the world like it. - Just one that beats it. When you first see him. Not yet on your hook, but rising to the bait. I stand corrected. I remember once, in the high Sierras, I was using a Wickham's Fancy. - No, a grizzly wing. - Father... for two hours we've had nothing but fish. My dear, I was only telling him about my trip to the Sierras. Perhaps you'd like to dance? Shall we? - Did you ever fish the Rockies? - Have I? Fisher Falls. Gluckman's Point. Gluckman's Point? I'm afraid that dancing isn't exactly my line. I should say it was part of your line. - May I be frank, too? - Why not? You dance superbly. I was hoping for something original. Dear, life is so full of disappointments. - Sorry. - Just the lurch of the boat. Afraid I wasn't concentrating. It was your eyes. Beautiful, aren't they? They remind me... Yes, I know. Sparkling diamonds, deep sapphires. No, they remind me of angry marbles. Connie, darling! You must have luncheon with us tomorrow, promise? I've a bone to pick with you. I'm afraid I... I'm sorry, but we can't work on our book without Connie. She's our inspiration. I thought that was rather clever. Yes. I thought you thought so. Don't I get a vote of thanks? Oh, by all means. It just dawned on me that I seem to have made myself... a permanent member of your party. Yes. It's dawned on me, too. Shall we sit down? So, you've fished Gluckman's Point? You're an angler, all right. I should say Mr. Chandler is quite an angler. Will you both excuse me? I'm quite tired. - See you tomorrow. - I think not. I'm going to read books the rest of the trip. - You're not ill, my dear? - Oh, no. That'll give you a chance to talk fish till New York. I could talk fish from here to Shanghai. Couldn't you, Mr. Chandler? Yes, yes, and back again. - Good night, Dad. - Good night, dear. Good night, Mr. Chandler. Don't keep father up too late with your fish stories. Gluckman's Point? Glasses? How do I look? Nobody in the world will know you. Fine. That's the idea. Catching up on your reading? Remember me? Oh, yes. I just left Father. He's enjoyed his three-day fish fest. So have I. - He's waiting for you. - He won't mind waiting. You don't know Father. You know the man. I know the angler. It's nice you have so much in common. I won't detain you. Goodbye, Mr. Chandler. Goodbye. You've got to help me. I'm in a bit of a jam with the Burns-Norvells. I've been trying to duck them, but they finally caught me. Cocktails and dinner tonight. How nice. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Wait a minute, now. It's your turn to come through for me. After all, I inherited them from you. I'm going to tell them that you and your father... will also join me for cocktails before dinner. Mr. Chandler, you think of the sweetest things. Now when the Burns-Norvells arrive... - you come in without your father. - Father gets all the breaks. And announce that he wants to see me right away. A brilliant idea for our book... and that we'll have to work the whole evening. See, could you do that? Good, then cocktails in my stateroom at 7:00. - In your stateroom? - Yes. You see, the bar is too near the dining room. Oh, I see. - Your stateroom at 7:00? - That's right. - Splendid. - All right. Until then. 7:00. She'll be alone with me in my stateroom. Give us about 10 minutes. Swell. How did you manage it? She thinks I've invited a lot of other people. How do you do? Are we late? Late? So sweet of you to send a message by Connie... asking us to have cocktails with you. She asked you to... She said that you were too bashful to ask us yourself. Where is Miss Connie now? - We needn't worry about Connie. - We forgot to tell you. Connie isn't coming. She has another headache. Mr. Chandler? Where are you? - Hello. - The inevitable Mr. Chandler. - How was the cocktail party? - Delightful. So sorry I couldn't come. I trust the Burns-Norvells consoled you. I found them very charming. Far superior to many people one meets on boats. Yes. Babs is one girl in a million. And so rich, too. - Or didn't you know that? - At least she has good breeding. Then... - Everything went off all right? - Oh, yes. In fact, I'm glad now that you didn't come. You are? Why this change of heart? You're so fragile. - Fragile. - Yes, you damage so easily. - Damage? - Sues for $5 million. That fascinates me. Asks $5 million damages. - So the Burns-Norvells told you. - It gave me a new light on you. Who is this marvel, I said, Florence Nightingale? Jeanne d'Arc? What has she done to earn such a precious reputation? - Found a cure for death and taxes? - Aren't you being a little absurd? - Aren't you? - Wait a minute, you don't understand... Do be careful. It might break. I'm not accustomed to handling anything so delicate, so valuable. That should be touched only by royalty, dukes or earls. As a matter of fact, you should be kept under glass. And that is the last I saw of Miss Connie until we reached New York. Five days on a boat, and she slaps your face. - That's fine progress. - So the wonder boy lays an egg. - Would you hush your girlfriend? - Say, listen, nobody's hushing me. I've got my ticket to Reno, my reservations at the hotel... - and even my lawyer. - Postponed only. A million-to-1 we'll never see them again. You lose. He's already invited me for a weekend of fishing. Just you and the father? What do I do, bust in on you and the old man? Connie will be there. I'll take bets on that, too. That wasn't any farewell slap. - When? - We're driving up tomorrow. Perfect. Alone in the mountains, away from the world. The next night, Gladys and I... No. I'd better stay away. - Just Gladys. - What, alone? And a detective. Connie rushes from her room. You come from yours, follow her down. - What'll I wear? - Flashlights! The case is in the bag. Nice work. I knew you'd deliver. I think I'll wear the pink. I look awful cute in pink. - There's only one hitch. - Hitch? - Fish. - Fish? I've told him fish stories that would curl your hair... and I've never even had a rod in my hand. - I'll have an instructor here in the morning. - In the morning? Him? Here? Where am I supposed to be? Now, it'll be all right, Gladys. - You're gonna leave me here alone? - I'm here. It'll be all right. It's just a business arrangement. It's mighty funny business, if you ask me. Where are you going? To get some bedclothes. I'm sleeping out here. You see, it'll be all right. Bill out here and you in there. Do you mean to tell me that you're willing for me, your fiance... - the girl that you love... - Please. I've done plenty for you and the Star... but there's a time to draw a line, and I'm drawing it. I trust Bill like he was a brother. Yeah, but he isn't my brother. He can't even speak politely. - He insults me with every breath he takes. - Pipe down. You'll hurt his feelings. Bill, I'll have that fisherman here the first thing in the morning. The first false move, I'll leave. Unless I'm cuckoo, I'll be out before midnight. It'll be all right, darling. Good night, Bill, good night. - Good night, darling. - Good night, old man. Hello? Flowers? On the way up? Oh, yes. Thanks. Open the door, will you? There are some flowers on the way up. We gotta get these bedclothes out of here. Hurry up! I've lost the keys. Good morning. Where did you get that key? The front-door key always fits both doors. - You mean that key was there all night? - Naturally. - For Mrs. Chandler. - Of course, just wait a minute. For me, Billikins? Yes, my little fuzzy-wuzzy. They're lovely. Thank you, sugar pie. How did you know white roses were my favorite flowers? What? Haggerty sent those. Haggerty never sent me flowers before. No? It's all part of the plan. I'm gonna get some breakfast. I thought the plan was to stay here and look married. - Lf you don't mind. - I don't mind if you don't mind. I don't mind if you... Who started this? What do you want for breakfast? Breakfast. You know, fruit... Will you have some more coffee, Bill? No. This certainly looks married, a little too married to suit me. I'm sorry. Here, have a piece. - Try the funnies. - No, I wanna talk. You do? Well, all right, let's talk. - Who goes first? - I'll start. You are a strange egg. - I bet you say that to all the boys. - I'll get it. - Good morning. Mrs. Chandler? - Yes. I'm Evans from the Angler Supply Company. - I've bought some supplies. - Bring them right in. And this is Mr. Chandler. Good morning, Mr. Evans. I've brought everything, a complete outfit. You'll have no trouble learning to fish with this equipment. No, sir. The elbow low and close. Muscle has nothing to do with it. It's the natural spring of the rod, sir. Too bad I'm not fishing for curtains. I'd be sensational. Now suppose you break your leg, then you can stay home. That's what I call constructive. I was just trying to help. Now, a little patience, sir. Try again. And remember... - the elbow low and close. - Low and close. Bull's eye! Give the gentleman a cigar. I don't quite seem to get it. It's your wrist, sir. Keep it easy and fluid... like rippling water. This way, sir. Darling, don't you want to powder your nose or something? And miss this? Not for the world, sweetheart. Pretend there's a 5-pound beauty in yonder pool... just behind the jutting boulder. Mrs. Chandler, would you mind stepping down here to the corner of the table... - and bending over? - Now I'm a jutting boulder. I'll be a tall, spreading tree just behind you. Don't forget the wrist. Remember, there's a man on second. I know I'm never gonna get this. I was never cut out to be an angler. Look, this is the way I would do it. - You did it, sir. - I'll say he did it. And how. That cast, sir. Why, not one angler in 50... can master the underhand stroke. - Underhand is right. - You mean it's all right? It's perfect, sir. Could you do it again? - Not with this boulder, he can't. - Like a backhand at tennis. - Perfect, sir. - Yeah? This is what makes life worth living. A breath of this early morning air is worth all the medicine in the world. Certainly is. We're not keeping you up, are we? Me? No. I'm always up at the crack of dawn. Here we are, Chandler. My favorite spot. How do you like it? Fine, splendid. Very much like the Lake Taupo country, New Zealand. Go ahead, we'll give you the first cast. Yes. I tell you. I think I'll go on up the way... where the ripples are faster and the brush is sparser. This is going to be good. I still bet he can't fish. Nonsense. He's the best-informed man on angling I've ever met. - Father, darling, you're a sucker. - Now listen to me, young lady. I know a first-class angler when I see one. Yes, and a first-class man, too. - Lf he's first-class, I'll travel steerage. - What did you come up here for? You had a weekend all planned in town. I didn't want to see my favorite father tossed to a wolf. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about that. He's after something, and it isn't fish. Look at those new togs. A new rod. Watch this. Great guns! I take it all back. He's good. Good? He's magnificent. I wish I could master that underhand cast. I've got one. A beauty. So have I. I've got his brother. Another one! Not having much luck, are you, Mr. Chandler? I'm surprised you're not catching any fish, Mr. Chandler. It won't be long now. I wonder if Mr. Chandler's having any luck. Don't worry about him. He's a real outdoor man. Dad, look! Walleye! He's hooked Walleye! But he'll never land him. He'll never land him. Reel him. No. Let him play. Give him some line. Reel him out. Reel him. Here, hold his head up. Don't net him. Don't net him. You did! Boy, what a beauty. - How'd you do it? - I just followed the book. The hook. Walleye. You've got Walleye. - Who? - Walleye. The biggest, most elusive trout in Glen Arden. We've been fishing him for two years and you got him. - It was nothing. - Nothing, you say? But I'm ashamed of you, spoiling his sport with a net. Nine-tenths of the fun is reeling him in. I know. I'm sorry. I was so excited. Unhook him. - What? - Yes. - Unhook him. - Yes. That is, no! You invited me up here, so you should have some of the glory. - So you unhook him. - I don't like to spoil your fun. No. That's quite the contrary. There's plenty of glory to go all around. It's mighty sporting of you to let me do this. Not at all. I think a toast is in order, if you don't mind. Hear, hear. To Walleye, king of trout. How have the mighty fallen. Undone by a Parmacheene Belle... and I thought his weakness was a Pink Lady. Another batch coming up. Say, you certainly have a way with the griddle! - She's a remarkable girl. - I'm beginning to think you're right. - I resent the understatement. - Just a spoiled brat. - Service. - Yes, sir. Coming up. Bulls eye! Never miss. Queen of the flapjacks. - Father? - I must think of my figure. A 20-minute walk, if you can spare me, then eight hours of sleep. - But we need help, Father. - No more for me. Where's my pipe? Alex? Lmagine, you and a flapjack. How'd you ever get together? And they laughed at me when I sat down on the griddle. I still think it's a trick. Nothing in my hands. Nothing up my sleeves. I know. It's all done with mirrors. Young man, there are many sides to my nature. Depths you'd never dream of. - I'll make a study. - Do. - How'd you like a swim in the moonlight? - Swim? Later on. You do swim? Yes. Almost as well as I dance. Then you'll drown. - Isn't it awfully cold? - Extremely. Do you mind? What, me mind? My intimates call me ""Polar Bear"" Chandler. We're only 20 miles from the place. We'll be there in 45 minutes. But I'm not supposed to show up until midnight. What's the difference? You'll bust in on them a half an hour earlier, that's all. You'll find cigarettes over there under the lamp. Thanks. - Say, you're pretty palatial up here. - Like it? - I think it's grand. - I always come down for a plunge. I've even stayed here all night. No, thanks. - What? Here, alone? - Yes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Pretty neat. I like music with my moonlight. You know, you're a funny kid. That's what you seem like up here, a kid. Very different from the girl I met on the boat. I feel different. This place, it's all tied up with my childhood. The trees, the air, the water. Even the frogs. I'm mad about frogs. I love it. We've always had heavenly times up here. Every minute completely filled, like today. - Yes. It's been perfect. - It has, hasn't it? Almost too perfect. And it's costing me a fortune, young man. What? I'm paying dearly for this day of fun. Meaning? It's my own fault for daring to bet with Dad on men. I'm a rotten judge of men. Well, aren't we all? I bet him a new plane that you'd tip your hand in the first 24 hours. It's rather sporting of your father to back a dark horse. Dad's a grand judge of character. He placed you right away. Impetuous, friendly, enthusiastic, guileless. Guileless? Not so sure about that. What's your analysis? Well, I said it first on the boat. Just another fortune hunter chasing $50 million on the hoof. Then? And then you told me off for being fragile... but I still said, he's got something up his sleeve he wants to sell. An oil well, an invention, or an emerald mine. The last young man we took on had an emerald mine. And will you believe it, I even bet you didn't fish? And you lost. ""Live and learn, Connie, my angel,"" I said. ""Next time, don't bet on men."" What are you thinking? I haven't hurt you, have I? I didn't mean to hurt you. It was just my way of saying I hope we can be friends. That's about the nicest thing that's been said to me this lifetime. - Friends? - Yes, please. Then you do forgive me? Don't apologize for suspecting people, Connie. Keep right on. Ring every coin you meet. There are lots of wooden nickels in circulation. Come on. No, I want to talk. You're the first person in years. You're in for it, my lad. The story of my life. The kitten who died when I was six, and my great-aunt Matilde... and all those twisted newspaper stories you read about my romances... and why they weren't romances. There aren't going to be any more twisted stories. What do you think a paper could make of this? And couldn't they just? You, me, here alone on a raft? Single note of the chime indicates exactly 11:00. And who are you, Cinderella's brother? - What happens at the stroke of 12:00? - You'll never know. I hope. - Come on, I'll race you. - All right. Connie Allenbury, you've taken from me the one thing in the world I love... my husband. - How is that? - Great. - Next week, East Lynne. - You just don't appreciate art. - Look, what's that? - What? It's a holdup. - Chandler. - What the... Why, Bill. I had to stop you before you got to the lodge. - She's gone. - What? You mean we aren't gonna finish it tonight? She only came to put the place in order... - then she went right back to town. - Why didn't you call? They don't have telephones in trout streams. I'd better go. Somebody might see you here. Aren't you going with us? Move over. I can't disappear in the middle of the night. What a lady-killer you are. One look at you and the gal disappears. Say, don't worry. Rome wasn't built in a day. It didn't cost $5 million, either. We had a nice, long ride. What are you talking about? We can't miss. - The setup is perfect. - The setup is crazy. We haven't a chance. At the end of the 10th round, it's a draw. The girl was there in the mountains? - But only for one night. - One night is enough. You told your wife you'd been called to Washington, remember? Yes, like it was yesterday. Yeah, but you lied. You didn't go to Washington. You went to Allenbury Lodge for a rendezvous with Connie. Our private detective will swear he followed you. - But her father was there. - That was a blind. - She left the following morning. - Sure. A guilty conscience. - You're insane. - What a mind. Now I know where you get those stories about working nights. Then you come home, you're indifferent to your wife. You fight with her. It's as neat a case for alienation of affection... as I've ever seen, and we slap it on tomorrow! - No, we don't. - Why don't we? Because you can't get away with it. They'd throw that case out of any court in the world. You, too. Not if I wear blue. I'm awfully appealing in blue. A: I was Allenbury's guest, not Connie's. B: I was never alone with her. C... - I know the alphabet. - But you haven't got a leg to stand on. Take it easy, will you? I'm getting a real in with the family... and I'm developing an open-and-shut case. We're gonna file suit tomorrow. Be at Britton & Britton's office at 9:00, and I can catch that noon edition. You'd make your crippled grandmother do a fan dance for that paper. Now, Gladdie. Wait a minute. Give me one week and I guarantee to put her in a real spot. Not a chance. She's walked out on you twice already. You know, Bill, I'm beginning to think you've lost your touch. - Goodbye, Gladdie. Don't be late. - Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye? Well. That's Warren for you. Crazy about me, but boy, how he conceals it. - What's the matter with you? - I just can't make him out. I can understand he's tossing me to the dogs for the paper. - But to do it to the girl he loves... - Who's tossing whom to what dogs? If he goes through with this in the morning... by tomorrow night, we'll all be in jail. - Jail? - Jail. I don't get you. It's the plan we've had right along. Yeah, but we haven't enough evidence to convince a backward child. If we spring this, the Allenburys are bound to smell a frame-up! - Do you really think so? - I'm sure of it. But to think that he'd do this to you. A beautiful girl who loves him, who's doing everything in the world... Believe me, kid. You've put up with a lot. You know, you're one girl in a million. You don't know the tenth of it. You wouldn't believe what I've stood for. I know. The night I met him, he stood me up for two hours. For what? A woman in Jersey had quadruplets... and it's been that way ever since. I know. It's tough. Fine, sensitive girl like you. That's love for you. - The things I could tell you... - I'd like to hear all about them. - Let's have a bite to eat. - All right. - You dance divinely. - Thanks. There have been complaints. Then you must have been out with amateurs. I hope Warren won't mind our dancing like this. What? Him. After all, it's perfectly innocent. Just fun. Sure. Certainly a girl can dance with her own husband... - and you are my husband. - Yes, quite. Besides, this is our last night. What do you mean? If you're going to file suit tomorrow... I'll have to move out of here to prove that we're alienated. - You know, I'm gonna miss you. - I'll miss you, too. - You're a swell kid, Gladys. - You're not such a cluck yourself. I hate to see you get mixed up in that mess tomorrow. Look, you don't want me to file that suit, do you? No, I don't. For your own sake. Then I don't. I don't start anything until you tell me to. It'll mean a row with Warren. It won't be the first one. Let's dance some more. It's pretty late. 2:00. I could dance all night with my Billikins. My little fuzzy-wuzzy's got to get some sleep though. You're kind of cute when you say that. So I'm going to say good night, Mrs. Chandler. - I'm off to get some air. - Air? Yes, I haven't been able to sleep for the last two or three nights. Must be insomnia. I can fix that. My father used to have it. When he did, I'd rub his head with cologne, like that. I'll go get the cologne. It isn't that kind of insomnia. You know, different people respond to different things. Some people respond to rub-a-dub on the forehead. Others drop off to music. Now, me... - I'm a horse's hoof man. - A what? A horse's hoof man. That's what it takes to put me to sleep. The sound of a horse's hoof. Hoof, hoof. You know? Hoof, hoof. Good? Are you amenable to reason? Then you will come to my charity bazaar. No. You turned me down for the horse show. But I ride with you every morning. You scorned my bid to a concert. But I strum my guitar 'neath thy window each eve. And now you refuse my invitation for tomorrow night. But I'm dining with you and Father this evening. It's your last meal, my lad. I'm beginning to tumble. I do very well for the back streets... but you're ashamed to be seen with me in public. Certainly. A gal who smears mustard all over her chin. Thanks. - Beautiful now? - No, just clean. Stop turning my head. Now, for the purpose of the record, what time will you arrive at the bazaar? Once and for all, I am not attending the bazaar. Bill, what is it? What is it? It is a horse. Let's stop clowning. There's something wrong. - Tell me. What is it? - I can't. Why? Please. I swore I'd never mention it again. The libel suit? What's that got to do with your coming to my party? Plenty. Connie, drop the suit, will you? I know you feel that the paper hit you deliberately. Of course it was deliberate, to hurt my father. - So you're striking back. - And you think I'm heartless. No, just foolish. You think you're gonna end all publicity... but instead, you'll be smeared over every paper in the country. And I don't care, because... Let's not go all over it again. You asked for it. That's why I won't be seen with you in public. All you need now is one more good scandal. Why is there any scandal in my being seen with you? Because you're in the public eye more than ever. If the gossip columns link your name with a man's now... don't you see that it's going to make you light, cheap? You're taking this much too seriously, darling. - After all, it's my fight. - And that makes it mine. You're sweet. If I had $5 million, I'd give it to settle this thing. Shall I drop it, Bill? - Will you? - I'll tell you tomorrow at the party. Now you'll have to come. How about the Athletic Club? Try the Yale. Try it again! I've got to get him! Two hours late. This guy is driving me mad. He hasn't seen her in 10 days. I can't make it out. It's not the old Chandler. Hello? Try his apartment. No use. Mrs. Chandler was calling from there. She's looking for him, too. - Didn't you tell her I was here? - She wanted him. She's afraid he's offended at something she said this morning. She wanted to apologize. Gladys wanted to apologize? He was to meet her at lunch and didn't come. She wanted us to try the morgue in case of an accident. She never tried the morgue for me. - Say, what's going on here? - Maybe he's working on the wrong girl. Working on the... What are you talking about? After all, she's his wife. She may be his wife, but she's engaged to me! The boss wants to see you right away, Mr. Haggerty. Yeah. All right. His wife. What about this fellow Chandler? I thought he was supposed to be clever. He's clever, all right. A lot cleverer than I thought he was. What are you talking about? He hasn't seen this Allenbury girl in 10 days. Do you call that being clever? Great scott, man. Do you realize what this means? More than you know. It's your business to find out what he's been doing. That's just exactly it. I'm going to take the matter into my own hands. I'm going to see Connie Allenbury personally. Why do you think she will see you? Mr. Bane, when I was a reporter, I'd get into places... that even a second-story man couldn't break into. All right, try it. Make her see. Appeal to her reason. She has none. This is Connie Allenbury, international playgirl... the spoiled daughter without a brain in her head! But I know how to handle her kind. I'm gonna throw myself on her mercy and appeal to her heart. I'm going to give her all the sob stuff! You know, Miss Allenbury, this situation has outgrown a petty fight. We've got to consider the humanitarian aspect. I must appeal to your social conscience. Thanks. I didn't know your paper thought I had one. Now, now. If you go through with this case... it's going to throw 500 people out of employment. Men and women, jobless, walking the streets... women like yourself, tired, cold, and hungry. - Driven to drink and ruin. - You write the editorials, don't you? Yes. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're saying to yourself, it's not my fault if people starve. - It's the fault of the paper. - Isn't it? No, it's my fault, it's my mistake. And all my life I shall be faced with the knowledge... that I have wrecked the lives of 500 people. That's all I care about, Miss Allenbury. Those poor, unfortunate souls. After all, they shouldn't suffer for... You're right, they shouldn't suffer for your mistakes. Miss Allenbury. Thank you. I knew you'd feel this way. - They must be taken care of. - Heaven bless you, Connie. Miss Allenbury. And you, too, for calling it to my attention. I shall see to it personally... that the whole $5 million goes into a trust fund for them. You mean you're gonna go ahead with the case? I must, to get the $5 million. Now I shall push it doubly hard. Now I have a cause. But the paper will go under. It will fold. Yes, I know, but you said that was secondary. The main thing is to take care of these poor men and women. Yes, I know, but there are other considerations. Is there anything in this house for a hungry man? - Yoo-hoo. - Hello, my sweet. Excuse me. - Hello, darling. - Hello. Dear, Mr. Haggerty of the New York Star. Mr. Chandler. Well, not William Chandler, the writer? Yes, I'm William Chandler. He writes travel books. That takes you to a lot of interesting places, doesn't it? Yes. Of course, it's all in the day's work. I'm just becoming familiar with your work. Yes? I thought perhaps you might do something for our paper. It'd be a little change from what you're doing now. I'm afraid that I'm pretty full up. - Up to your neck, I suppose. - I object. No more work. - Do sit down, Mr. Haggerty. - Thank you. I only see him now once a day. Connie, you mustn't exaggerate. If we must be factual, twice a day sometimes, maybe three. You'll give Mr. Haggerty the wrong impression. After all, he's a newspaperman. - Don't worry about impressing me. - And besides, he's not a columnist. He didn't come to discuss gossip. He came to discuss the case. Yes, the case. By all means. - Yeah, that's right. - And it's all settled. You mean you're dropping the suit? No, but thanks to Mr. Haggerty's social conscience... all of the employees will be taken care of... with the $5 million I shall win from the Star. That was all he cared about, wasn't it, Mr. Haggerty? Absolutely all. And now that you've been so generous... I think I'll say thank you and run along. Please don't hurry. You spoke of other considerations. They really don't matter at all. Just so long as those poor men and women don't starve. You've taken a great load off my mind. - Have I? - Yes, indeed. I don't think there's another thing to discuss. There certainly is not. I'm Warren Haggerty, the managing editor of the New York Evening Star. I know. The butler told me you were here. - He'll show you to your car. - Then I won't keep him waiting. And you can tell your owner, Mr. Hollis Bane... we're not entertaining anyone from his yellow rag in this house. I'll make it a point to tell him. You're entertaining no representatives of the Evening Star. Thank you. Good night. Miss Allenbury, good night. It's a surprise, Mr. Chandler, but a great pleasure seeing you here. Hello? Hello, Gladys? Yes. What? You just saw him there a minute ago? He's been seeing her every day? Sure. He's been protecting her. He's in love with her. That's why he's stalling us. But we got him now, and the case, too. How long will it take you to get to the Allenburys'? A half hour? Perfect. Sure, he'll be there. He can't get away. He was just going in to dinner when I left. Thattagirl. Tear the roof off. And get in touch with me at the office... as soon as you've done your stuff. Right. Bye-bye. By this time tomorrow, I'll be dining on shipboard. - What? Where do you think you're going? - I'm having dinner with my publisher. He's sailing on the Victoria tomorrow, the 8th. Today is the 8th. No, tomorrow is the 8th. Friday the 8th. No, Bill. Today is Friday. Today? - What? - Of course. Friday the 8h. This is terrible. He has a contract waiting for me to sign. I've got to see him. What time does the ship sail? - 11:00, from Brooklyn. - You can make it. - I'll drive you in. - No, you finish your dinner. I have my own car here. I'm so sorry. This is terrible. Mr. Chandler's apartment, please. And would you rush it? Yes? Don't you ""Hello, Gladdie"" me, Bill Chandler. So you were having dinner with your publisher. You've been handing me a line of pretty talk for the past 10 days... and all the time you've been seeing Connie Allenbury. You can't do that to me. Don't forget you're my husband... and I'm telling that to Miss Allenbury tonight. Now, Gladys, that doesn't sound like you. I don't blame you for being upset, but I can explain everything. Will you meet me at the Paradise Roof in 20 minutes? All right, I'll meet you. But nothing you can say will stop me... from telling that Allenbury gal tonight. Remember that. Here's the headline proof on the Allenbury yarn. Swell, elegant, magnificent. We'll write in the gory details when we hear from Gladys. What's keeping her? It's after 12:00. The old man's probably trying to bribe her. Say, that'll make a swell subhead. ""Rich father tries to bribe wronged wife."" I wonder where that skunk Chandler is now. He probably ducked to China or Africa or something. Hello, Warren. - Where have you been? - Dancing. - What did you say? - Dancing. You know... You mean you didn't go to the Allenburys'? You didn't... - No, we decided against it. - Why you... Self-control, Warren. Very important for a man your age. Here. Throw this out. Go on. Now what have you got to say for yourselves? - Don't shout, Warren. We're not used to it. - Are you going to tell me what happened? You'd better tell him, Bill. His blood pressure... Yes. Perhaps you're right. Warren, what would you say if I told you... that I had almost persuaded Miss Allenbury to drop the case? I'd say you were a dirty, double-dealing liar, and I'd be right. I won't stand here and listen to you being insulted. Come on, Bill. Is that so? Wait. Listen to this. Not four hours ago, I heard your two-timing Romeo... whispering sweet nothings into the ears of Connie Allenbury. What do you think of that? Bill told me all about it. That's technique, Warren. You wouldn't understand it. Why didn't you tell me you were seeing Connie Allenbury? Sure, and have you spoil all my good work... as you did tonight, barging in... just as I'd about convinced her to drop the case. We didn't need any charity from her. All Gladys had to do was bust into the house. As Bill says, and have you smear our names all over your paper... you headline hunter. Believe me, this way is better and cleaner. Tomorrow evening, the Allenburys are giving a party. I'll be there. Go right ahead, Bill. I trust you. And what's more, I'll get her to drop this case, once and for all. That is, unless you decide to barge in again. You're so obvious, Warren. Why can't you be subtle, like Bill? Are you gonna listen to him or me? I'm going to listen to Bill. He knows best. How do I know that you can get Connie to drop the case? You'll have to take my word for that. That's good enough for me. Maybe you're right. Maybe this is the best way. Now you're talking sense. All right, go ahead. I'm sorry I blew up, old man. Think nothing of it. Now you see how silly it was to get excited, Warren. After all, I do want you boys to be good friends. - Come on, Bill. Good night, Warren. - Good night. - Good night, old man. - Good night. What's up? That low-down, conniving rat... making Gladys believe he's in love with her. - He won't get away with it. - Can you stop him? I'm going to wash up the Allenbury case and Mr. Chandler with it. Gladys may be eating out of his hand now, but before I get through, she'll be biting it. Here, son. Tell Douglas to print up one copy of the evening edition. Put that item at the head of the society column. - One copy? - That's what I said. Our circulation is certainly falling off. I'll be right back. Gladdie! What are you doing here? Can't a girl have any privacy? I had to see you. I got great news. It better be good, bursting in on me like this. It's about Bill. Say, I certainly had that guy all wrong. He's a wonder. Congratulations. When did you come out of the ether? I was a sap to ever doubt him. He just called me a minute ago. Told me he's getting Connie to drop the suit tonight. Then off he goes on an around-the-world cruise... ending up at the altar... spliced to an eight-figure fortune. What a man. What are you talking about? You know he's got those Allenburys right in the palm of his hand. ""It seems the charity bazaar at the Allenbury house tonight... ""is something in the way of a farewell party. ""J. B. Allenbury and his attractive daughter, Connie, are sailing... ""for a four-months, around-the-world cruise on the S.S. San Ramone. ""Accompanying them on this cruise will be Connie's current favorite... ""William Chandler. ""Do we hear wedding bells?"" - How do you like that? - Let me see that paper. I have to run. Just thought you'd like to hear the good news. Somebody get me out of here! Get me out of here! Have a photographer at Allenbury's home at 9:00. - There's gonna be fireworks there tonight. - Right. Step this way for the great game of skill. Darto. Throw a dart and win a beautiful prize. $1 a dart, and cheap at half the price. Woo lady luck at the wheel of chance. Pick the winning number and win a priceless prize for the lady. Come one, come all. Look, ring the neck of a bottle and win a baby doll. No trick, no deception. Pure, unadulterated skill. Yes, sir. How many? Where's Connie? I must see Connie. I'm so anxious to tell her about Mr. Chandler's wife. - Mr. Chandler's wife? - Yes. You know Chandler, the fish man on the boat? We met his wife. A most amazing creature. But nonsense. He's not married. We never dreamed he was married. He didn't look married and he certainly didn't act married. The married ones never do. I'm sure there's a mistake. No, there isn't. We saw him this afternoon coming out of the hotel. We called him, both of us, but he was getting into a taxi. Let's have a drink. I had to run half a block, trying to make him see me. But he'd gone. So we went into the hotel to leave a message. The clerk asked if we wished to speak to his wife. I said, ""Naturally."" He said that she was in the beauty shop. We saw her. My dear, she's a case. A psychopathic case. She was in a booth, and she kept screaming, ""Let me out of here!"" Before we could speak to her, she rushed past us. Look, there's Connie and Mr. Chandler now. All ready. Hold still, please. Why, grandma, what big muscles you've got. The better to sock you with, grandpa. Hold still. You wait here. I'll get them. We'll make a party of it. Waitress. Mary, champagne cocktails for five, please. I'll be right back. Queen of the air. Now, now. One at a time, please. Connie, I must see you. What is it, dear? I can't talk to you here. - But Bill... - He'll keep. Thank you. Connie? I've been robbed. Driver, can't you go any faster? I can, lady, but the cab can't. Now, what is it? I haven't seen you this worried since I stole your favorite fishing rod. Connie, how much does Chandler mean to you? - Not jealous, are you? - Are you in love with him? Terribly. More than I ever dreamed I could care for anyone. You're sure? I'm sure. Why? You like him, don't you? Of course. Then what are you being so mysterious about? What is it, Dad? The Burns-Norvells say he's married. I don't believe it. You know the Burns-Norvells. I'm afraid it's true, Connie. They've even met the woman. No. I don't believe it. I won't. Now, Connie, please. And yet it explains so much. Why we've always had to meet alone... It's hideous suspecting him... - and yet... - We've got to know. - Roberts? - Yes, sir. - Ask Mr. Chandler to come here, please. - Very good, sir. - But let me ask him, Dad. - No, Connie. Please. It's my problem. Let me handle it my own way. You're sure you don't want me to... You'll ask him point-blank so that he can't misunderstand? Yes. I'll ask him so he can't misunderstand. Go on, darling. I'm all right. And so the flying princess, tired of this Earth... flew back to her home, the moon. - There isn't any princess. - No? There isn't any moon. Just Connie. That's all right with me. Say, I'm glad you ducked out. It's much nicer here. Bill, there's something I've got to ask you. Animal, vegetable, or mineral? It's just... I don't know where to begin. What is it, darling? We've had such fun together, such happy times. But, Connie, darling, what's the matter? What's happened? There's a question. Well? It's the most important question I'll ever ask. Just answer yes or no, but don't explain. If it's no, don't explain. Well, go ahead. Wait till I catch my breath. Bill, have you been proposed to much? Have I been what? You know, proposed to? Your hand in marriage. Well, not enough to turn my head. - Why? - I'm asking you to marry me. What? - Is that the question? - Yes. Will you marry me? Well, Connie... Will you? What do you think? - When? - When? Now? Now? You mean soon? I mean now, tonight. Tonight? - Will you, Bill? - Will I? Is there a preacher in the house? - Not here. We'll take the car. We'll drive... - To the moon. - Awfully glad you've enjoyed it. - Thanks to you. - Pardon me, Mr. Allenbury. - What is it, Roberts? There's a person here who claims to be Mrs. William Chandler. She wants to see Mr. Chandler immediately. Where is she? I took the liberty of asking her to wait on the terrace, sir. Thank you, Roberts. I'll see her. Good evening. I'm Mr. Allenbury. Yes? I'm Mrs. William Chandler, and I can prove it, too. - You'll have every opportunity to do so. - I'll say I will. I want my husband. Where is he? Your husband will be returned to you intact, Mrs. Chandler. Just as soon as I can find him. - I'll go with you. - No. I think it would be wiser if you stayed here. - So, you're afraid I'll make a scene. - On the contrary, I'm looking forward to it. I'll bring your husband to you directly. - Follow that roadster. - I got it. Perfect. Don't lose them, and try to get pictures. - Right. I won't lose them. - I'll be getting the special edition ready. William Stevens Chandler. Ever been married before? Not to speak of. My wife will be the witness. She'll be down in a minute. Here she is now. - Are they sober? - I think so. This is love, not liquor. Join hands, please. William, do you take Constance to be your lawful wife... to have and to hold, in sickness and in health... to love, honor, and cherish... - Did you get Gladys on the phone? - Sure. What did you say? That I was looking for you with some important information. - And? - She fell like a log. She asked me what information I had, so I dropped the bomb. I told her I was driving by the Grand Plaza and saw Connie and Bill go in. On investigating, I found they'd been assigned to suite 805 and 807... as man and wife. - What did she say? - What didn't she say? You know, I've been thinking... that was a justice of the peace they called on. - Maybe he really did marry her. - How could he? He's got a wife already. - I know, but... - There's Gladys now. Okay, buddy. We're off to the races. You wait here. So? - Gladys, this is a surprise. - I'll bet it is. I'm sorry to break into your little party, Miss Connie Allenbury... but this man happens to be my husband. This is the lady I told you about, a Miss Gladys Benton. - ""Mrs. William Chandler"" is the name. - Yes. How do you do? - I said, ""Mrs. William Chandler."" - I've been looking forward to meeting you. - Bill's told me so much about you. - He told you about me? Yes. Won't you sit down? No, you don't. You're not getting out of here! I'm not leaving. I just don't want Warren to miss anything. - Hello. - Hello. Could you hear all right, or shall we start over? Hello, Mr. Haggerty. Do come in. So nice to see you. Let's all sit down. Yes, let's. What are you doing here? - Naturally, she didn't expect you. - I didn't know he was out there. This has nothing to do with you or your newspaper, so you keep out of it. As Mrs. William Chandler, I demand... There must be some mistake. You see, this is Mrs. Chandler. - What? - What? Yes. And has been for a whole hour. - Yes, we were just married. - Have you gone crazy? If you think you can excuse this by pulling a marriage gag... But we are married. Really. Yes. I always carry our marriage certificate right with me. - They're married, all right. - But that's arson. You mean it's bigamy! What a story. Connie Allenbury marries bigamist. Print that in the paper, you'll have another libel suit on your hands. - I'm not a bigamist. - You married me, didn't you? - That one doesn't count. - What are you talking about? About a certain Mr. Joseph Simpson, your lawfully wedded husband. What are you trying to hand me? I've been divorced... You got your divorce in Yucatn, by mail. Three years ago, all Yucatn divorces were declared illegal. I found that out yesterday in the Hall of Records. I also consulted my attorney. Then you and Gladys were never really married? - That's right. - But I made an honest man of him. Dear, don't forget the letter. Yes. This is from Mrs. Chandler, for you. Warren, she was so touched by your pity... - for your 500 starving employees... - You've dropped the suit! - But I... - Connie. Miss Allen... Mrs. Chandler. How can I ever... I just can't thank you enough. Connie Allenbury marries author. What a story! What a scoop! Mr. Haggerty, you've forgotten something. - Yes. My hat. Excuse me. - Your hat and Mrs. Simpson. Mrs. Simpson? Gladdie, of course. That ""Mrs. Simpson"" gets me, Gladdie. I've got to run along to the office. You phone me there in the morning. Just a minute. You want a real scoop? I'll give you one! I found out my Yucatn divorce was no good... so I got a second divorce from Joe Simpson in Reno. - What? - What? - Then, we're not... - I don't believe it. Then try the Reno Hall of Records. - But... - That's quite right. Now where do we all stand? Let's all sit down and talk things over quietly. You and I will have plenty of time to talk this over on our world cruise. I'm sure Miss Allenbury won't mind turning her ticket over to me now. Ticket? World cruise? What are you talking about? You're getting all excited. Now come along... What about this? - It's nothing, Bill. - Yes, what about this? I can explain that thing. I had to use it as a little gag... So it's just one of your little gags to get me here! I'm here, all right. Before I'm through, you'll all be sorry you ever saw me. You were all terribly smart, weren't you? You were all building up to a nice happy ending. Haggerty wins his case. Chandler wins his girl. Where do I stand? I'll tell you where, right behind the eight ball. You thought it was a lot of fun, didn't you, making me fall for you? Well, I did fall. But I'm picking myself up, William Chandler. You can't fool me any more with your hoof, hoof, hoof... or your insomnia or your publisher. You're a pretty poor sample of a husband. But nobody else is gonna get you, not if it kills both of us. - Now look, Gladys... - You're 10 times worse than he is! At least he had some excuse for kicking me around. He was in love with another woman. But you double-crossed me for the sake of a newspaper! Marry the paper and be the proud father of a lot of headlines! That's all you're good for anyway. I suppose this is all very distasteful to you, Miss Allenbury. You're not accustomed to hearing the truth. You've had money to protect you from it all your life! You spent your entire life buying anything you want. My husband isn't for sale. You can't buy him at any price! - Will you let me go? - You can't walk out on me like this! Gladdie! Wait a minute. Wait. Let me handle this. You two diplomats have done enough. - I'm afraid it's locked. - Then please give me the key. - Not yet. I want to talk to you. - I've talked enough. Right. Now it's my turn. - You can't offer me money... - I wouldn't think of it. Pleading won't do you any good. - I'm sure. - What else is there to talk about? - You. - Me? I've a pretty fair notion of what you've been through. - What do you mean by that? - Any woman can be starved by neglect. The little attentions Bill paid you seemed so much greater... because you weren't getting them from Haggerty. The only time he sent me flowers, he signed it ""Bill."" Exactly. He probably never noticed the clothes you wore... never told you how lovely you looked, the way Bill did. That's right. How did you know? Women can't fool women about men. - You don't want Bill. - Oh, no? I know you've got him now, in name anyway. But I have his love. You can't build a life on hate, or a marriage on spite. Marriage is too important. - Mine only lasted an hour, but I know. - I'm not gonna listen to you! A fine mess you made of this, and all because you tried to steal Gladys! I wouldn't steal Gladys if she were the last female on earth. Female? That does it! You can't stand there and insult Gladdie. You've had this coming for a long time. Yes, and I've been looking forward to it! - We'll settle it right now! - With interest. I don't love Warren Haggerty. I'll never love him! I never want to see him. I never want to hear his name! I hate him! - They're fighting! - Warren! Wait a minute! Don't be a sucker. You hear who she is calling? Now, are you satisfied? Say, I got an idea. She'll feel sorrier for you if I punch you in the nose. Warren, darling! Why, Bill! I treated you terribly and now you are hurt. It's my fault, darling. I'm just a mug, Gladdie, but I love you. Let me see. You're bleeding! You big coward, you must have hit him when his back was turned. How dare you? Are you all right? What is this? What's going on here? Hello, Father. I got your telephone call. What's this? Now be calm, please. - I can explain everything. - You'd better explain fast! - You mean to tell me you married him? - Yes, Father. - Who is this woman? - That's Bill's wife. What? Quiet, will you please be quiet! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Well, my lad, they tell me you want to confess. Yeah. That will help the jury. They convicted you on circumstantial evidence. Understand? Yeah, sure. Public opinion. Clear that up, too. Justice itself will feel easier. I'm doing it because I'm scared. It may help the big rap when I go through that last door. You might as well do a real job. I have a couple of newspapermen here, and the judge who sentenced you... Shut that up, will you? Can't you stop that singing? Now, now. It's his turn next. You confess, he sings. Okay. - Bring on your gang. - Good. - Can I do anything for you, Dan? - Yeah, how about a drink? Okay. Thanks. - Do you want to see Father Flanagan? - Sure. I asked for him. He knew me when. How much time have I got? Eternity begins in 45 minutes, Dan. What happens when that door slams shut behind you? - A bad minute or two. - Yeah, I know. After that? Dan, that's been a mystery for a million years. You can't expect to crack that in a few seconds. - Would you be afraid to die? - No. Why not, if you don't know what happens? Well, I've made mistakes, Dan, but I've always been sorry for them. I try to make up for them. If you killed a rat, and it was coming to him... could you find some way to be sorry for that? Dan, life and death should be left to the Creator of life and death. Please stay, will you? How are you, Judge? This is Lane Wellington. His column fought for you. Didn't think you were guilty. Sorry to let you down, pal. If you'd stuck to your guns, I'd have kept you alive for years. I wouldn't try to be funny, if I were you. This man wants to admit his debt to the State. What's that? My debt to the State? If you'd have done this sooner, the debt wouldn't be so big. Is that what this is all about? You're going to take my life, because I owe the State something? When I was a kid, 12 years old, my mother died. Did I go on the cuff to the State for the gutters I slept in? Is that it? That's just sniveling. The State reached its arms out for three years... Yeah, in the reformatory. When I went in, copping a loaf of bread was a job. - When I come out, I could rob a bank! - Holy cats! Get this, big shots. I'm going out that way in a few minutes. So you're getting the lowdown. Where was the State when a lonely, starving kid cried himself to sleep... in a flophouse with a bunch of drunks, tramps, and hoboes? Is that when this debt started? The only pals I had a chance at were the kids in the alley. I had to be tough to string along. Just before we got out of the State's arms... the reformatory, we made up a gang, six of us, and pals. We bet our lives across the board, and let them ride. Crooks! Sure! Your mouths pop open at that one. Greek to you wise guys, ain't it? One of them turned rat for State's evidence, and I killed him. But get this. One friend when I'm 12 years old... and I don't stand here like this! Now, go on, get out of here... you bunch of mush-brained saps! Get out! Listen, Father. I am sorry for my mistakes. I am sorry. 12 years old. One friend. Starving kid. Never had a chance. Reformatory. Break your mugs. Steal our food, will you? Get in your own streets, you mugs! Here. Tommy, stop it. Come on, Tommy. Stop it. Tommy, stop it! Skinny! Loafers! Police! - Good morning, Dave. - Good morning. - Look, $80 smashed. - It's a shame, Dave. Father Eddie, that place of yours draws the rats around. - It's like molasses and flies. - I suppose it does. I sleep beside a machine gun, while you rock-a-bye-baby the 40 thieves. Read all about it! Dan Farrow electrocuted! Read all about it! Where's His Reverend? Don't we get a sermon this morning? Hear ye, my friends. Scoff your coffee while ye may, turn up your toes... call it a day. I didn't start this place to give you men a laugh. I really didn't. I thought I could help you. - Sorry, Father Flanagan. - We apologize. Thanks for the coffee. We all love you, dominie, every one of us. Well, you can pass the word along the road... that somebody else will be running the place pretty shortly. I'm leaving. - But, Father... - Weasel, you're too smart. No, I had decided before. I spent last night, or rather this morning, with Dan Farrow just before he... It was too late to do very much for him... and I guess it's too late to do very much for you. I'm afraid you're satisfied with something to eat and a place to sleep. Father Flanagan! - What is it, Skinny? - They got Jimmy! The cops got Jimmy! Please tell them to let him go. He's my brother. - Who else have they got? - They got Tommy and they got Steve. And they told me to go home. Yeah, home. Where's your mother, Skinny? Come on. We'll see what we can do. Mr. Morris, do you know who broke your window? - Yes, Your Honor. - Pardon me, but does it really matter? It was a free-for-all. Any one of them could have done it. What do you mean, Father? Not to obstruct justice, even if I could, but one boy threw that stone... did this special damage. But he didn't mean to do it. They were all throwing things. They were all excited. I'm trying to reduce it to a definite charge. That's what I was afraid of, Your Honor. - None of us want to abuse children. - But we do, nevertheless. The business of the court is to take care of the honest citizen. You. I have a high regard for you, but... Your Honor, these boys were arrested this morning. It's now... It's 3:30. Has anybody come forward to say one good word for them? Father, mother, uncle, sister. Anybody? Well, you're saying quite a few. And I'll go on, until you take back the privilege you granted me. You heard Mr. Calatieri. - May I question him? - Certainly. - Sit down, Mr. Morris. - Thank you. Mr. Calatieri. Yes, Father? Tommy, stand up. - Tommy came in to buy some salami. - Yes. I wrap my salami. I put him down. He say, ""Half a dozen eggs."" I turn around to get the eggs, I come back, where is my salami? No salami and no Tommy. But you didn't really see Tommy steal the salami, did you? My nice, fresh salami. She no walk away. And the police found the salami, and some bread, some other things. There's no doubt about their being stolen. There's also no doubt that these boys should be taken off the streets... - for their own good. - And sent to the reformatory. I'm wondering if you want to do that to a homeless boy... - just on circumstantial evidence. - Well, what do you want me to do? There's the salami, and there's Mr. Calatieri. They can have my salami. I give it to them, free for present. But next time, please, not the imported. - There won't be any next time. - You should have studied law, Father. Thank you, Your Honor. Well, I guess that's... Unless my good friend wants to identify the boy who threw the rock. My window was smashed. $80 gone to someplace... But I... Well, I can't say who did it, positively. Father Flanagan, what's in your mind? I'll assume full responsibility for these boys if you'll place them in my charge. I'll give them a home, I'll see to their schooling... and I'll guarantee their good conduct. Well, I think you're letting yourself in for a lot of trouble, but I'll give it a chance. I release these boys into your custody. - Thank you, Your Honor. - And good luck to you. Thank you. Come on, boys. You're one of the finest fellows in town. Why in the name of all that's holy don't you want to meet nice people? - Well, Dave, I know you. - You... - Father, do you want this? - What is it, son? It's a puzzle. You have to jiggle it around till you get the eyes in the sockets. Isn't that wonderful. Thank you very much, Skinny. I'll have a lot of fun with this. Dave. Come on, boys. Could you take the boys to your place and keep them there a little while? Sure. What? I've got an important call to make. All right, gentlemen, get in. Oh, boy. A car ride. Tommy, you better sit up here in the front seat. On second thought, you better all sit up in the front seat. I feel safer. Hold on, boys. Be careful. - Dave, I'll see you a little later. - Could you make it a little sooner? Do you want me to drive, Mr. Morris? I gave you permission three years ago for your refuge. You thought you could do a lot of good. Well, I have the right to a mistake or two, haven't I, Bishop? And now you want to do something I think is harder to do... - certainly more unorthodox. - That's true. So I'm going to assign you to a parish. That's good work, and you're a good man. - Don't make the decision yet, please. - Why not? Why, you'd dream the best part of your life away, if I'd let you. But I'm not dreaming. There's one thing I know, I really know. And that is, that there's no such thing in the world as a bad boy. I'm sure of that. Do you realize the fight you want to take on? I know that a mother can take a whip to the toughest boy in the world... and he forgets it, because he knows that she loves him. I know the fight, and I haven't anything to do it with, except faith. But... with your kind permission, I would rather have it than the parish. I can't help you. We have no arrangement for outside things like this. But you have my permission. How are you beginning? First, I must rent a house. No doubt, fumigate and launder it. Bishop, I shall never forget this. My blessing. Hello. I thought you got lost. No. I had a little chat with my bishop. I rented a house. - You're renting houses now? - Yes. Of course, I have to pay something down, so I need a little money. - A little money? Yeah. What security have you got? Well, let's see here. - You want $100 for this? - Yes. Look... you can have any one of those for 65 cents. And any one of them is better than yours. And you want $100. I need the money very badly. With merchandise like that, I need it worse than you do. Got anything else? Wait a minute. - That's a 10-cent toy. - Yeah, you can have a lot of fun with it. Not a $100 worth, I can't. Have you got any other security? Every boy who becomes a good American citizen is worth $10,000 to the State. That's a fact. I have good authority for it. I'm sorry, but $100 for a bum watch like this... and a hunk of tin with a couple of ball bearings... All right, Dave. I don't blame you for turning me down. Thanks just the same. I'll try someplace else. Wait a minute. Couldn't you make a good American for $50? All right, there's your $100. No. You keep the watch. I'll keep this. - I'll redeem that some day with interest. - Yeah. Here, sign this. - No, don't sign it. - Thanks. Now, you'd better leave before I change my mind. I'm not afraid of that, Dave. Now, I wonder if you could show me some furniture. You know, chairs and tables, and stuff like that. $100 worth? I got a little list here that I made out. There. All right. I suppose when your boys grow up, they'll break bigger and better windows. I'll be right with you, boys. Certainly on their good behavior, aren't they? Ten chairs. There's two. - What does the whole thing come to? I'll give you $150 for the lot. It's a deal, for $200. Right. $160. Not a cent more. Why, it cost me almost that much. - Make it $190. - No. Say, wait a minute. What am I doing? I'm bargaining with my own money. I'm losing two ways on the deal. Here's $50 down payment. You're offering me $50 of my own money... as down payment on my own furniture. No! Oh, well. All right. What's the use of my taking the $50? You'd only come around for it again tomorrow. Here's the address. You mind if I throw you out? Look, tonight, just before you go to sleep, you're going to like yourself a lot. I'll send the furniture over. Then I'm going to a doctor and get my head examined. Come on, boys. We're going home. - Father Flanagan? - Yes. I'm from the Morning Herald. My editor, Mr. Hargraves, sent me over to see what you're doing, and... Well, right now, we're putting up a little sign that Tommy made. - We thought we might get some pictures. - Some pictures? Hey, fellows, come on. We're going to get our pictures took. Bring Father Flanagan's coat. - All right, sure! - Oh, boy! - Hotdog! - Take it easy, please. Here. Let's get rid of the rock. Here, hold the rock. Hold it, don't throw it. Come right in here close. That's right. - Put the rock behind your back. - Big smile now. - Okay, Jimmy? - Okay. - All right, hold it. - Big smile. Still. Here he comes! Hey, wait a minute, fellows. You know what we planned. Come on, get in your places. Come on, we gotta sing. Come on. Get in line. Now, altogether... Silent night! Holy night! All is calm all is bright Round yon Virgin Mother and Child Holy Infant so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace Silent night! Holy night! That was a very nice reception, boys. Thank you very much. Tommy, would you take that out in the kitchen? What is it? It's good food. And there's enough there for all of us, too. - What is it? - What's in it? It's good cornmeal mush, not a tummy ache in a carload. What else you got in the bag? Well, I don't know, exactly. I kind of picked these things up hither and yon. Once I got a sleigh. Shut up. I thought you said if we were good, everybody would help us. Well, I did say that, Skinny. I... But... Well, maybe it'll take another Christmas to make friends for us. Gosh, if we was in a reform school, it ain't mush for Christmas. Tommy, are we going to forget what we're trying to do? Gee, if I was home, my old man might wallop me... but we'd have turkey at Christmas. Well, Christmas has other meanings, hasn't it, Bob? Listen, I can get a turkey easy. It's a cinch. Everybody's busy. Bob! You should get down on your knees and ask pardon... for a thought like that on Christmas Eve. Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jingle all the way Mr. Morris! - Merry Christmas, Tommy! - Merry Christmas, Mr. Morris! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everybody! - Turkey and presents for everybody. - Merry Christmas. Am I late? If ever in the world a man was on time. Now, everybody sing. Jingle bells, Jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one horse open sleigh - Thank you, Father. - Hello, Dave. Hello, I came over as soon as I could. What's up? Now, let's get out of here, Dave. It's pretty noisy. Several new boys came in last week. We're suffocating here. Now, look, Eddie, just what do you want? Dave, it's grand to see you. You certainly have had a wonderful year, haven't you? It's been a wonderful year for both of us. - Did you pay all your bills last month? - Yes, sure. Most of them. Skinny, what did I tell you about biting your nails? A few little odds and ends, but I'll get the money for that. That's what I was afraid of. No, Dave, that isn't why I wanted to see you. No, I want you to take me for a little drive. I want to show you something. I'm a busy man. That's just it, Dave. Now, you've been working too hard... with the new store and everything. A little drive in the country will relax you. Just what you need. Just what we both need. - Bye, Father Flanagan. - Goodbye, boys. Now remember what I told you. Lovely country, isn't it? Over 200 acres here of rich, fine soil. You could really live and breathe out here. - What about it? - I want to buy it. Now, look, Dave, I can get it cheap. Just look at it, Dave. We could build a real town for the boys here. They could have gardens, dormitories, gymnasiums, classrooms... Mortgages, and bills, and debts! Be reasonable. First you started with five boys, then it was 20, then it was 50. With this place, you'd be looking for 100 boys. - All right, 500. What? How you going to get the money? How you going to do it? It's crazy. Well, maybe you're right. - What did you say? - Maybe you're right. Eddie, don't you feel well? Maybe it's just a dream that I'll never see fulfilled. It seems a shame though, a lot of boys cheated out of the chance... to live a nice, decent life out in the open, where they belong. Stop it. - How many acres? - Over 200. But you can't handle as big a thing as this... without a lot of public support, contributions. I haven't been a bad risk so far, have I? No, you've paid back everything. How, I don't know. It isn't that. But this time you're biting off more than you can chew. The newspapers aren't friendly to you, as it is. - What do you think they'll say about this? - I know. - What do you suggest? - Hargraves. He owns the most powerful string of newspapers in the Middle West. And he's a tough nut to crack. You get Hargraves behind you, and maybe I can handle it. That's fair, Dave. All right, here you are. It's a bargain. Nothing doing. Not till you get Hargraves. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - How do you do, Father? - Good morning, Mr. Hargraves. We haven't met before, but I know of you. Well, that shortens preliminaries. - Can I help you? - Do you want to? If you mean, do I indorse your work, I don't, I'm sorry to say. Well, that's all right. But why do you go out of your way to hurt me? There's a feeling in official circles that you're setting up a tacit criticism... of things as they are. There was the same feeling when Newton suspected the law of gravitation. There's also a feeling that the sooner you're discouraged, the better. For yourself, too. - No one questions your intentions. - But I'm paving the lower regions, huh? Mr. Hargraves, I have 50 boys I've taken from the slums and the streets. Right now they're on their way to becoming confident human beings. I can do the same with 500. Boys like that get their chances in institutions. You know better than that. Do I, Father Flanagan? You have a string of newspapers. You get reports on human derelicts. You know the percentage of boys who survive institutions. Surely you must know, you above all men. And you have no right to hinder me in helping children. That's pretty stiff, Father. What little I've done, I've done on nothing. These boys, thieves some of them, have gone without clothes... they've even gone without food, but not one of them has deserted. Not one, because they know what I'm trying to do to help them. But there are some impossible young beasts who have to be manacled. Look at this. ""Eleven-year-old boy convicted. Guilty of murder in the second degree. ""Jury renders verdict after 35 minutes deliberation. ""Court will sentence him to life in prison."" A semi-equipped young savage who's right where he ought to be. You'll admit that, won't you? This boy saw his mother being brutally beaten by a drunken father. So he took a gun and killed him. Suppose a man kills because his wife's been unfaithful: Temporary insanity. But an 11-year-old: Just a savage. What do you want of me? I want your help for homeless boys. I want you to let the world know what I'm trying to do. - No, I'm afraid I can't do that. - Why not? Because I don't believe in what you're trying to do. The very foundation is false. ""No such thing as a bad boy."" That's just a catch phrase, sentimental nonsense. Of course you know you're flying in the face of the very best of public opinion. I've seen you do that. You lead public opinion. On my convictions. You want me to throw them out the window. A whole lot of good people feel just as I do... and we're not un-Christian monsters. Well, if I'm right, you're pretty close to it. And so far, I've proven my case. Mr. Hargraves, when you got into trouble at 11 or 12 years of age... you had your mother or you had your father to put their arms around you... to talk things over with. Can you imagine the fright and the loneliness of a boy... without that love and understanding? This poor kid... in prison for life. I want a home for them, where they can stay... and where they can learn. A town for boys... governed by boys. It's worth a shot, isn't it? Your sincerity is worth a shot. Father, I'm not going to fight a plan as unselfish as yours. But understand, when you fail... I'll use you for a lesson in horse sense to the world at large. Fair enough. There we are, Dave. We've got three fine new buildings. A grand beginning. Yes, sir. And three fine mortgages might make a grand finish. - We've had mortgages before. - Yes, little ones. Look at the sweating you've done to raise nickels, dimes, quarters... penny contributions. Now you've got to get dollars, hundreds, thousands. Wait a minute, Dave, wait a minute. This doesn't have to be paid today. - No, but the day will come. - Dave. Now, Eddie, I know. I know you've always been in debt. Debts up to your knees. This time it's up to here. It might not be as bad as that. You've got to stop thinking from here, and think from here a little bit. Now, Eddie, come on. Let's look at the figures, averages... and see what we can set aside. Father, we'll have to go now if you're going to make that train. My goodness, I forgot all about it. I'll be right with you, Paul. Now where are you going? A boy in the State Penitentiary wants to see me. He's in for life. Yes, and you're in for life, too. Thank you. - Goodbye, Mo. - Goodbye, Father. - Have a nice trip, Father. - Thank you. - Goodbye, boys. - Bye, Father. Pee Wee. Are you going to be a good boy while I'm away? Can I get my candy when you're away? Freddie, everyday Pee Wee gets a piece of candy in my office... if he's a good boy. Of course, if he isn't a good boy, then he won't expect it. Because Pee Wee is an honorable man, aren't you, Pee Wee? - Goodbye, boys. - Bye, Father. - Nice trip. - Bye, Father. - Father Flanagan. - Warden. This is Joe Marsh. He leaves for a federal prison today. - Hello, Joe. - Hi. - I'm letting you use my office, Father. - I appreciate that. The guard will let you know when the time is up. - Would you like them to stay? - No, I don't think that's necessary. See you later. I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner, but I was up to my ears in work... when your letter came. Yeah. Nursemaid for a couple of hundred kids ain't no cinch. That's right, no cinch. Look, I didn't want to see you for none of them phony prayers. Nothing like that. I got something else on my mind. All right, go ahead, shoot. Get this, I ain't sorry for nothing. Well, everybody has a right to look at things in their own way. You bet. I went my own way, and I got to be headman, didn't I? Guys took off their hats when I told them to... and there's plenty of them still scared that maybe I might bust out of this joint. Well, now, look, you didn't have me come all the way from Boys Town... just to lord it over me, did you? What's on your mind? I got a kid brother, Whitey. I've been taking care of him ever since my old lady died. Well, he's batty about me. You know, thinks I'm aces. Wants to be number one, like me. But he ain't got what it takes. He'd turn out to be a five-and-ten mug. That's where you come in. - You want me to take him to Boys Town. - That's it. The warden's got $280 I had on me. It's all yours. He'll tell you where to find Whitey. He's here in Lincoln. Well, we're overcrowded, but I guess I can find room for one more. He's pretty tough. You may have to kick him around. I doubt that. Sorry, time's up. - Goodbye, Joe. - So long. Wait here, I'll be right down. - Hello, son. - Hello, Father. - Ante two. - Two? You heard it. Gee, I haven't had a hand yet. I'm sitting in a rummy seat myself over here. Keep your hands to yourself, Shorty. See who it is. - What's it worth? - Two. That's all it's worth. - Hello, Father. - Hello, boys. Hello, sir. Hi, Doc. Which one of you is Whitey Marsh? I've got a message for Whitey. I'd like to deliver it to him alone. Hey, wait a minute. I'm out about $1.10. Come on back here. There, that's better. I'm Father Flanagan. I saw your brother Joe just a little while ago. We had a long talk about you, Whitey. Joe wants you to come with me to Boys Town. You've got a swell chance taking me to that joint. That's right, a swell chance. I've got $280 your brother gave me to take care of you. I don't care if he gave you a million bucks. What am I going to do in a broken-down nursery like Boys Town? There are a lot of things you could do. We've got machine shops... carpenter shops. We've got printing presses, farming. I think you might like farming. It's good for you. Keep you out in the open, put hair on your chest. If you think you'll make a plow jockey out of me, you got another thing coming. Now, look, Whitey, in a pinch I can be tougher than you are... and I guess maybe this is the pinch. You're coming with me to Boys Town... because that's the way your brother wants it. And that's the way I want it. My arm! My poor arm. You broke my arm. You better get me to a hospital. I can't go nowhere. My arm, poor broken arm. - Well, let's see. Where does it hurt? - Take it easy. - Where is it? Right here? - Yeah, right there. Well, I guess we can fix that... Now, why don't you stop acting like a kid, Whitey? - Hello, Father. - Hello, Mo. Hello, Paul. - Hello, Father. - How's everything, Mo? - It couldn't be better. Everything's jake. - Good, that's cheerful. Whitey, this is Mo Kahn, our second baseman and barber. Mo, this is Whitey Marsh. - Hello. - Hi, eagle-beak. I'm going to have trouble. Say, where are you from? You probably got that big schnoz sticking it into somebody else's business. - It's coming. - Come on, boys. Come on now. Hurry up. - Say, how far is this place from Omaha? - About 10 miles. Ten miles? What? Are we stuck out at this place all the time? We never get into town? Once in a while, a football game, or baseball game. Some special occasion. This is Birchwood Drive. This is the main road leading to the home. It leads out, too, don't it? Boys, this is Whitey Marsh. How are you? Whitey, I won't introduce you to all these fellows. You probably couldn't remember their names. Okay by me. Got a lunch counter? When do we eat? When the bell rings. - Hello, Father. - Hello, Freddie. Whitey, this is one boy you have to meet. This is Freddie Fuller, the Mayor of Boys Town. - Hello, Whitey. - Hiya. - I'll put him in your charge. - Yes, Father. This way, Whitey. Okay. I don't like a lot of kids looking at me like I was a freak or something. Come on, gangway in here. Come on, open it up, buddy. Boys, something tells me we're gonna have to use a lot of patience with Whitey. But I don't think he's half as tough as he thinks he is. Hey, Red. Take this bag of Whitey's, will you? Service, huh? Mammy. Mammy. Now I'll show you around. - Do you have to do that? - That's what we do. - Hello, Pee Wee. - Grab them kind of young, don't you? - Hey, what's your name? - Go on, beat it, kid. This is Pee Wee. He's sort of a mascot around here. Everybody likes Pee Wee. Yeah, I know, except I don't like kids hanging around me. - What's your name? - His name's Whitey. Hello, Whitey. Here, cut yourself a pair of diapers. Gee, for me? That's swell. Over there's the band room where the fellows practice. - Got any poker players in the mob? - No smoking, Whitey. Just plain, nice boys, huh? Hey, Whitey, I bet you can't do this. Yeah, watch this, kid. Step back, will you? Give me room. You're wonderful. What? Are you kidding? Hey, what's the skyscraper over there? That's our own branch of the United States Post Office. Well, what do you know about that? Mo, I'm tired. Listen, Pee Wee, why don't you stay here... and play mumblety-peg with your new knife? I can't carry you. Mo, come on. I'm tired. All right. Okay, here we go. Up. Attaboy. Sucker. On a clear day, you can see Omaha from here. Yeah? Then what you got? That's our baseball field over there. One of our players has just been signed by the St. Louis Browns. - I like the Yankees. - You would. Hey, how did you get to be Mayor? Did Flanagan make you Mayor? No, Father Flanagan didn't. I was elected by ballot. We have an election every six months. - I voted for you, Freddie. - I know you did, Pee Wee. Thanks. Just like playing house, huh? Say, Whitey, you carry me for a while, will you? No, I might drop you. There must be a lot of kids taking on the lam around here... with no fences or anything. No, there never was a wall or a fence around this place. Father Flanagan once told us... that a fence can't keep a fellow in if he don't want to stay in. - It's all worked on the honor system. - Honor system? A guy'd be a dope to try to do anything around here with 200 spies... ready to run and tell teacher on him. There's no squealing. Whenever you do anything wrong... you go to Father Flanagan and squeal on yourself. Hey, you wanna know something? I think you and Father Flanagan... and this whole joint is screwy. Now, get this, Whitey. You think you're a lot different from the rest of us. You're not. We've got a lot of tough guys in this place. Guys that'll take you apart and put you together again like a watch. Any time you get an idea like that, let me know. You can depend on that, Whitey. When I get the idea, I'll let you know. Say, Whitey, Father Flanagan wants to see you in his office, right away. I was having such a good time. Well, see you later, Mayor. Come in. All right, Pee Wee, go. You're cold, Pee Wee. Getting colder. Warm. You're red hot, Pee Wee. You're red hot. You took the biggest piece, didn't you? So you've been a good boy, have you, Pee Wee? Yes, Father. Do you know what I think? I think you've been extra good... and that makes a great deal of difference around here when you're extra good. Then everybody's happy, aren't they, Pee Wee? There, now you think that's enough for a really good boy? Yes, Father. Thank you. - Can I sit in the leather chair, Father? - You bet your life. I'd love to have you sit in the leather chair. Go ahead, Pee Wee. Well, how do you like the place, Whitey? The more I see of it, the more I don't like it. Well, you will like it. I'm clearing out of here the first chance I get. There's a chance for that any hour of the day or night. My hunch is, though, you won't take it. I'll give you odds on that. If I was a betting man, I'd take you up on that. - Is that all? - That's all. I like Whitey, Father. You and I, we like everybody, don't we, Pee Wee? - He give me this. - He gave you that. Yes, he gived it to me. Goodbye, Father. - Hello, Mr. Morris. - Hello, Pee Wee. - What you got, the mumps? - No, candy. - Say, what's your name? - This is Mr. Burton, Pee Wee. Hiya, Burt... Mr. Burton. He's the chairman of Father Flanagan's board. I'm gonna be Mayor someday. Eddie, there's a little matter of red ink in the financial statement. In other words, a deficit. You have a rather bad situation here. Yes, we have a boy in trouble. Something new? There's always a boy in trouble. If we don't attend to this, there'll be a lot of boys in trouble. Have all that stuff laid out in the gymnasium, and... Hey, look. Hello, kitchen? Mr. Brown, how soon will lunch be ready? Well, ring the bell right away, will you, please? And give it two or three extra rings. Right. Hello, Your Honor. Finished your tour? The bell saved you, didn't it, buddy? Whitey, you're sitting beside me. All right, half-pint. We thank Thee, Lord, for these, Thy gifts, which we have received... through Your merciful bounty. Heavenly Father, I thank Thee for this food. Gracious God, may the food that we are about to receive strengthen our bodies. What's the matter, can't you all learn the same words? Don't have to. You say the kind of grace you want to say. At Boys Town everybody worships as they please, think the way they wanna think. Sure. Some of us don't have to go to chapel. If you're a Catholic, or a Protestant, you can go right on being one. - Well, I'm nothing. - Then you can go right on being nothing. And nobody cares. Thanks. Hey, who's the swell mob in the back there? - They're the Commissioners. - In the gravy, huh? How'd they get there? Eenie, meenie, minie, mo? No, elections. We vote for them. How cute. Wonder how they'd like to move over? Don't reach for that one, fellas, it's a mile over your heads. But might I of Jove's nectar sup, I would not change for thine The thirst that from the soul doth rise Let him sing. He's doing all right. Doth ask a drink divine But might I of Jove's nectar He's nobody's fool. Sup, I would not change for thine - Here, let me help you, gimpy. - No, that's all right. I can do it alone. - Come on... - Let me alone. I don't need any help, I tell you. I can manage. What's the matter with that lug? I was only trying to help him. For a smart guy, you're an awful sap. - Whitey, gimme a piggyback? - I ain't helping nobody. He didn't mean any harm, Tony. I know that, Father. That's a good idea. I do it myself sometimes. Do you suppose I'll ever have any sense? Why, sure, Tony, you've got a lot of sense. Of course, you have to exercise it, so it'll grow. People will always be trying to help me. - I want to do things myself. - And why not? I'm counting on you to be the Mayor of Boys Town. No. They want a fellow who's good at football and baseball. Somebody they can cheer. Tony, there's a true story about a man... who was very ill for a long time. But he had courage, he got well. People began to cheer him for a lot of things. And he became the President of the United States. And I only want to be the Mayor of Boys Town, someday. - Good night, Tony. - Good night, Father. - Hiya, Tony. - Hello, Mo. Hey, Hillbilly, everything's set. - Kid stuff. - Good night, Pee Wee. Here he comes now. Who's the smart guy that doused the lights? A bunch of wise guys in here, huh? Very funny, boys, very funny. Come on, White-Wings, I want to get trimmed. Okay. Trimmed is right. Yes, sir. Snappy, says I. Nice and neat now, my man. None of that egghead business, get me? By the way, how did you enjoy your golf? That joke died last night. Leave it lay. What shall we discuss, Your Lordship? This great little metropolis, Boys Town. - I'm afraid I'm beginning to like it here. - Goody. Yes, sir. In fact, I think I might even stay. - A light trim. How's about it? - Not bad. No, sir, not bad at all. Now, give me a massage. I thought you were kidding. I ain't kidding. The works, baby, the whole works. Going down. Okay, boss. - I'm going to give you... - I ain't crazy about barbers gabbing. - All right, close your eyes. - I got big problems to figure out... tremendous ones. So button it up and do your stuff. Now you just ruminate about those big plans. You just grow up to be one of them big, strong, silent type of men. You know, things ain't going to stay dead around this place, not for long. I'm looking the gang over to see who's all right for my big plans. I believe in organization. And when I start picking my gang... you'd better hop on the bandwagon, White-Wings. There's roll call. - Roll call? Where's that? - Right back at the dormitory. - I'll finish you later. - All right. Here, buddy, keep the change. - Morris! - Here, sir! - Murphy! - Here, sir! Marsh! Whitey Marsh! Marsh! Whitey Marsh. - Here. - Here, sir. Here, sir. Why, that... - Mr. Mayor, if it please the court. - Yes, Father Flanagan. Whitey, the laws of Boys Town are made by this body and enforced by this body. The law doesn't require anything of a boy that isn't good for all of us. We have to respect each other if we're going to like each other... and living here together as we all do... we have to like each other if we're going to get along. We've been years building up the rules that we live by... and if you break them, you have to answer for it here, in our court. You cannot escape it in Boys Town. Okay. Mo, there was a fight in your barber shop this morning. Yes, sir. - That was no fight. - I'll get to you in a minute. Mo? - Well, he came slamming in my shop... - Who struck the first blow? The first blow? What, are you kidding? There was only one blow. Careful, Whitey. There are extra charges for contempt of court. Okay. Mo? He started riding me the second he struck here. Last night in the dormitory, he... Well, he kept on doing it. Then this morning he comes into my shop, and he says: ""Hey, White-Wings, gimme a haircut, a massage... ""the whole works, baby, the whole works."" He sent me out looking like a mammy singer... and I don't take that from anybody. That's why I sloughed him. - Any questions? - No questions. - Did you ever milk a cow? - Did I ever what? It'll take him a day or so to learn. For a month you will milk one cow a day, night and morning. You mean that I'm gonna have to... The second month, two cows a day. That's for contempt of court. May I suggest that for the fight they seem equally guilty? What's the moving picture for tomorrow night? - Buck Rides Again. - Gee whiz. You will both attend the movie. Hot dog. You will stand in front of the hall with your backs to the screen... while we watch the show. Mr. Mayor, before you dismiss them... come on now, boys, no hard feelings. Shake hands. Okay. Shake the hand that's going to milk 90 cows, kid. Next case. Goodnight, gentlemen. I seen that picture, anyway. I seen it in Madison. - No good? - Terrible. Buck rides over the hill, shoots a bandit, rides back over the hill... scoops up the gal, they all live happy ever after, nothing to it. Hey, a pool room. Come on in, I'll shoot you a game. No, you can't. That's for the Mayor and the Commissioners. Those guys got it pretty soft, ain't they? Say, I think I'll run for mayor. Why don't you? I'll vote for you. - Check. - And you can vote for yourself, that's two. Look, you and me, we're supposed to be pals, you understand? Me, too, Whitey. Can he vote, too? - Honest? - Yeah, but only once. You know what I'd make you if I was elected Mayor? - What? - Finance Commissioner. Yeah? - What'll I be, Whitey? - The forgotten man. - Would I show them an election. - Yes, siree. My friends... - comes the election, we'll all play pool. - Yippee! Leave it pretty long so it'll cover that roller skate. Hi, Tony. Been scouting around for you. Look, you ain't kidding yourself about you got a chance for Mayor, are you? - Well, I have some friends in school... - Sure, I know, but use the noodle. You got to get around if you're going to be Mayor. Look, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll shove you in as a Commissioner... then you won't feel like you bit off more than you could chew. There's only six Commissioners. You've promised 10 that I know of. There's no hard feelings after election. You're a boss then. They got to take it. Forget yourself, for the good of the school. Tell your friends to vote for me. That's the big deal. I'll treat you right. You've given me an idea, Whitey. - I'll think it over. - Atta-kid. - Hi, Whitey. - Mousehead. Hiya, big shot. Hey, Freddie. There ain't no reason why fellows running... against each other for election can't be friends. You've been Mayor for about six months now. Don't be sore if the fellows think it's time they had a new one. It's all right with me, so long as it isn't you. Rather staggering, no doubt about that. We've seen them like this before, haven't we, Dave? - Well, what? - There's a way out. You refused admission last year to over 800 boys, no room. That's true, unfortunately. Did it ever strike you how many of that 800 offered to pay? - No. How many? - At least a third. And your dormitories so full of boys who can't pay, you couldn't take those in. With that kind of school, you could be financed, comfortably... by parents who will pay you to straighten out their boys. - These figures... - Figures. I've made liars out of figures all my life. If I hadn't, there wouldn't be one stone on top of another in Boys Town. Hundreds of boys have been here. They're out in the world now... with their heads up. They're making good, every one of them. That's serving my Creator and my country. In 30 days, Father Flanagan, they'll be obliged to take this place away from you... unless you change your mind. No use, Burton. He'll do what he thinks is right... if the heavens fall down. You know figures are the most... Later on, youngster. Pee Wee. This is Boys Town. All right, Pee Wee, go. You're as cold as Greenland. Getting colder. Now you're getting warm, Pee Wee. You're burning up, Pee Wee. You're red hot. There you are. Hey, Pee Wee... did you brush your teeth? I lost my toothbrush. You lost your... When, Pee Wee? A couple of days. A... Paul, come in here. A couple of... Pee Wee, I'm sorry about that. Now that's my fault. Paul, how in the world could we let Pee Wee go... for two whole days without a toothbrush? Pee Wee, you've got to have some more candy to make up for that. Paul, I want you to go right down... to the storeroom, and get him a brand new toothbrush. And you ask the Commissioner of his dormitory how a thing like that... could ever happen, 'cause he's a good boy, and we've been neglecting him. He wouldn't think of coming in here for candy if he hadn't been a good boy. Take care of that right away, Paul, and make a big fuss about it. It's a shame. I'm awfully sorry this happened. I'll get to the bottom of it. Maybe I can find my toothbrush. You mean, maybe someplace you haven't looked? Yes, Father. It might be there. Pee Wee. You know, Pee Wee, when you don't look at me straight in the eyes... I think maybe you don't like me. - You said 30 days, Mr. Burton? - Right. The only solution you have to offer is to turn away the boys who cannot pay... and take in the boys who can. Every man on your Board of Directors feels the same way. I'm afraid we'll have to think of something else... because that cannot be done. Will you leave me alone with the problem? What are you going to do about it? Something I do very privately, say a prayer. We've been through some pretty tough spots together, haven't we? I can't send boys away, not any of them. Eddie, if you can pray your way out of this, I'll join the school. And another thing... I'm not going to say anything personal about one of the candidates. I'll say that only to him. Don't forget, a lot of us were pretty rough stuff when we came here, too. But he's run a campaign rotten with lies and mud... and promises that he knew were lies when he made them! I'm finished, Father. Boys, I'm sorry I'm late. Now, as usual, I take no side. The election is your business. All right, Whitey, it's your turn. - Friends of Boys Town. - Take off your hat! Excuse me, Father. Well, fellows, here we go. Tomorrow's the big day. I'm not much for making long speeches, but it looks to me... like you've been singing the same old tune around here all the time. But believe me... if you vote right tomorrow, we'll be swinging that old tune. Yes, sir, fellows, we'll be swinging it. And may the best man win. And now, boys, we'll hear from our other candidate, Tony Ponessa. I've been in Boys Town about five years. I've always hoped I might be Mayor sometime. But there's something I want more than that. Boys Town must always be just what Father Flanagan made it. Must have a purpose, high ideals. Well, I'm not sure of myself... but one of the candidates has proven he's the right man. So I retire from the race. I ask my friends to support Freddie Fuller for re-election. Of all the double-crossing tricks. And the day before election! Go on, the rest of you. Quiet, boys, quiet. Now, we have various ways here... of letting new boys find out how things are done. I hope some of you haven't forgotten how long it took you. Fellows. Now, listen to me. Whitey and I have been battling for votes for ourselves... and Tony thought of nothing but Boys Town. If you want a standing vote right now, Tony has it, hands down. You mean ""hands up,"" don't you? If you want Tony for Mayor, raise your right hands. Well, boys, this is very unusual. And a very great honor, Tony. You tried to give it away, and they gave it back to you. Wait a minute. We haven't heard from the other candidate. And I got plenty to say, too. I think you and Tony are a pair of dirty, double-crossing guys. I told you any time I had the idea I could take you apart, I'd let you know. - Yeah? - Well, I got the idea. Any time's all right for me. You know that, don't you? Boys. Well, it looks like this battle is inevitable. All right, Whitey... but all fights here are according to Hoyle, and they're in the ring. Okay! Is that all clear, boys? Now, you break when I tell you. The rounds will be two minutes, one-minute rest. Half a round, and a good long rest for him. Go to your corners. Fight. Attaboy, Whitey! Come on, get up there. One, two. One, two... three, four, five. Whitey! One, two, three. All right, Whitey, you've had enough. It's in the middle drawer, Pee Wee. There's Whitey. Where's he going? Whitey! Wait for me, Whitey! Whitey, wait for me. Whitey! Hey, where you going? Go on, beat it, will you? - You going away? - Sure, I'm blowing the plant. Go on back, will you, Pee Wee? Where you belong. That's a good kid. On your way. But you and me's pals, ain't we? Go on and beat it, will you? Go ahead. I'm your pal, Whitey. Take me with you. No. I can't be bothered. Go on and beat it, will you? No, I want to go with you! Go on, beat it. No, I want to go with you. Go on back and scram, will you? Pee Wee! Speak to me. Pee Wee. I didn't mean it. Honest, I didn't. Speak to me, Pee Wee! Oh, God. I'll do anything, anything at all, Pee Wee. I'll ride you piggyback. Go speak to me. - I'll carry him, Father. - No, I'll take him. Pee Wee. No one is allowed. ...Christ, Our Lord. Amen. Joe Marsh! Joe, it's me, Whitey! Come on, let's get outta here. Yeah, come on. Take the car. Wait at Bogg's Tavern. - But how about you? - You heard me. Get going. I'll meet you later. Sorry, kid. I didn't know it was you. - Where'd he get you? - Right here. - Can you stand up? - Yeah. Come on. We gotta get outta here. Let's go. It's not bad. You'll be okay. Just lie still. What are you doing out of school? I walked out. You walk back, get me? You're going straight. That's why I put you there. Stay right here till I send for you. - How'd you escape, Joe? - Never mind that. Listen, Whitey, no squawking or squealing. No. Don't talk until you're dead sure I got away. - All right, Joe. - Keep that leg quiet. Forget me, kid. My road's a lot too tough. - So long. - Joe, don't go. Unless there's a concussion, he'll be all right. Take a little time, though. Pee Wee, lad, I'll keep the candy on tap. - You're wanted on the telephone, Father. - Thank you, Sister. - Hello? - Father Flanagan... Whitey's hurt. - He's hurt? - Yeah. He's over in a church at 19th and Dodge. Hello? ...and I pray for Pee Wee. It was all my fault, but I didn't mean it. Honest, I didn't mean it. Let him live. Please make him get well. Are you hurt badly, Whitey? - Who told you? - I don't know. - Do you? - I ain't talking. - How's Pee Wee? - He's all right. He'll pull through. - Can you walk at all? - Sure. Here, put your arm over my shoulder. Good evening, Father. Boys, you should be in bed, shouldn't you? - Whitey's up there, isn't he? - Yes, he is. There's trouble, and we know it. Evening, Father. Did one of your boys come home wounded? Yes, Whitey Marsh. There was a bank robbery. The night watchman was killed. Robbery? Well, what has that got to do with Whitey? I found this cap. - And who are you? - Reporter, Morning Dispatch. The boy's name is in it, Father... and Boys Town. I'm afraid there's something to it this time. - Where did you find this? - In the alley near the bank. There was a trail of blood to a church. But we were a little late, he'd gone. Yes, I got him. - Where is he? - In the infirmary. Well, I'll have to take him in. He's been wounded. He shouldn't be moved. - I can't help that. - Sheriff, I'm the head of a community... with complete autonomy and a better record than any in the State. I'll be responsible for Whitey until he's able to be questioned. Well, if the boy's hurt, I'll take your word, of course. But I'll have to leave a deputy. Tim, you stand by. I'll call later. The wound is superficial, Father. Nothing to worry about. Leave us alone, please, Sister. All right, Whitey, let's have it. - What? - The whole story. - There ain't nothing to tell. - Stop that. They found your cap near the bank... and they followed your trail to the church, where I found you. Why don't you leave me alone? If I hadn't gotten there first, you'd be in jail now. Whitey, I don't believe you're guilty. You might as well save your breath. I ain't talking. It was a bad day when I brought you here. I've always said there was no such thing in the world as a bad boy. I've built my life on it. You're the only boy in all these years that hasn't had a heart somewhere... that I could reach, somehow, sometime. Whitey, over 200 boys have a home here, but tomorrow night... they won't have any home. And that's up to you, Whitey. Because I never worked as hard with any boy in my life. I never had to. I don't know nothing to tell, nothing to tell nobody. Were you mixed up in robbing this bank and killing that watchman? I heard some shots. I got scared, and I ran out to the alley... and I got plugged. Then somebody picked me up and took me to the place where you found me. - That's all I know. - You're lying! You know a lot more than that. I just got through telling you all I know! Who picked you up in the alleyway and carried you? You're shielding someone. Are you going to see these boys turned out into the streets, into alleys... into reformatories, and worse? Lose their home? All right, Whitey, that licks me. Yes, it was a sad, bad day when I brought you here. It was, indeed. The Sheriff left a deputy to watch you. I'll turn you over to the police tomorrow. He doesn't feel like talking tonight. Well, my friend, you're sticking to the finish, huh? Eddie, come on down and see Hargraves. They're getting out extras, bad ones. They've got the case tried... and they've got you hung, unless you can do something about it. - Is this it? Is it Boys Town? - Yes. - I got here, didn't I? - Have you come far? - Are you Father Flanagan? - Yes. How far, son? I hitchhiked, maybe a week, but I got here. I suppose you're hungry? Yes, sir. Eddie, please. We have to get downtown. - Freddie! - Yes, Father. Freddie, see that he has a bath, and some food, and a place to sleep. - What's your name, son? - Charley Haines. All right, Charley, tomorrow we'll talk things over. Thank you, Father. What's the matter? I'm going. It's all over. What's the matter, kid? I want to make a confession. A what? All right, let's have it. No, you got to get Father Flanagan. Don't want to talk to nobody else. Okay. Beat it, Mo. I'll wait here. It's my kid brother. How'd you find us? I heard you tell these guys where to go. What are you doing? Steering the cops here? - Nothing like that. - Lay off that stuff, Rod. Listen, Joe, you gotta make a break. I kept my mouth shut, see, told nobody nothing. But I'm as good as arrested for that job down there. I had to even make a sneak to get here. - Why, you... - Paul! Wait a minute. Let's get this. That school, with those kids. They're gonna be closed up tight. Those kids sent to reform school. It's taken away from Father Flanagan. I don't care what they do to me... but I ain't going to see those kids tossed out like that. Joe, I can't do it. I'm telling you straight. Get out, take your chances... because the minute I get back, I'm gonna spill the beans. I don't wanna do it, Joe, but I gotta do it. I gotta. It's okay with me, kid. On your way. We'll make a break. Joe! Stay where you are. We break when we said we would. Before daylight, and the kid sticks until we're well on our way. Get it? - Here you are. Get your paper! - Papers! Paperboy. ""Authorities threaten to close Boys Town."" - Sorry, Father. - Thanks. Extra! Boys Town suspect. Murder at bank robbery! Extra! Night watchman killed! Extra! - Hello, Father. I came as soon... - Mr. Hargraves. What kind of Christian logic can allow you to destroy us... before anybody gets to the bottom of tonight's business? That sounds pretty terrible as you put it. I don't know how much this boy had to do with it. I can't get him to talk. But I have a hunch he's not guilty. I think you should pull your punches until somebody... finds out something, and does it definitely. Now I really do. Father, I left this office an hour ago, because women's clubs, societies... - everybody was calling me. - All I'm asking for is a little time. My friendship for you is definitely known. If I pull any punches, they'll say I forgot my duty as a newspaperman for you. - I can't stand for that. - All right. Suppose tomorrow you find out the whole thing is wrong. Suppose you find out the boy isn't guilty... and that my record is clean and clear of anything like this. How will you feel then? You are my friend. Now tell me, how will you feel? All I want is a little time to let the thing clear itself. That's all. Excuse me. Yes? Police Headquarters? Your friend, Whitey Marsh, has escaped. Two of the other boys went with him. I believe you made yourself responsible for him. That means something like ""accessory after the fact."" Well, I'm afraid that's all. Sorry, Father. Goodnight. Hello, Reynolds? That boy, Whitey Marsh, escaped from Boys Town. Two of the other boys went with him. Put that where the public can see it. And, Reynolds... feature an editorial against sentimental rubbish about juvenile derelicts. Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern. Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern. Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern. Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern. Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern. Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern. Whitey's at Bogg's Tavern. - Good night, Dave. - Good night. Freddie! Tony! Sister, what's happened? The boys, they're all gone. I don't know, Father. I do, Father. They're going to Bogg's Tavern, after Whitey. Bogg's Tavern? Please find Whitey, Father. All right, Pee Wee. You go to sleep now. Freddie, Mo, Tony. Haven't I troubles enough without all of you going crazy? We're not crazy, Father. Whitey's with his pals. We're going to get them. You'll do nothing of the kind. They may be murderers. There's been a man killed. They can't kill all of us, Father. So that's the way you feel about it, huh? Keep out of it, Father, will you, please? No. Bless your hearts. Turn out those lights. Let's go. Here they come. Don't move. Hey! Wait a minute, fellows, give me a chance! Won't somebody give me a chance? Give me a chance to explain! Clear a way, there. We're coming through, Father. Get him! Quiet, boys! Now there's just one thing I want to know. The rest is for the police. Wait a minute. Don't hand the kid over. Hey, Whitey, come here and tell him. Let him go. Come on, Whitey, spill everything. I couldn't tell you nothing before. I didn't have no part in robbing the bank. I couldn't tell you, because I couldn't give my brother up. I didn't come here to make a sneak with them. I came here to tell Joe that I wasn't going to see Boys Town smashed. That's what I came here for. I told him I wasn't going to give him up, Father. That's all. I told him I was going straight back to you and tell the truth. But these other two guys, they held me here. They wouldn't let me go. Quiet. That's the truth about tonight. I've been good and rotten at Boys Town, but that's the truth about tonight, Father. I couldn't squeal on my brother. Eddie, shut your eyes. Now open them again. And this hand is paralyzed from signing for registered letters. And that gorgeous color, black. You win. What would it cost to build a dormitory for 500 boys? One quarter of a million dollars. Come on, sit. Boys, I have a startling thing to say to you. In our midst is a lad who has refused to act as an official here. Now that is reprehensible. He is notoriously shy, a shrinking violet. But... no excuse is good enough for refusing duty when Boys Town calls. The present Mayor, Tony Ponessa... and the rest of the candidates agree with me. No boy can sidestep the call of duty. I ask for a standing vote, acclamation. I nominate Whitey Marsh. My pal, Whitey. I wished I could think of something to say. And if I could think of something... I wished I could say it. I'm going to try to make... I mean... I'm going to try to help to make... I mean... I'm going to try to help... to keep Boys Town the kind of place... What a guy you picked to be Mayor. There is no bad boy. English Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, That's the boy. Miracle Lad. Go on! Break his blasted neck. You keep quiet or I'll take a sock at you. Yeah? Go ahead and I'll take a sock at you right back. There he goes. The last stallion I've got on the place. Hey. How do you think I'm going to run a breeding farm without a stud? Huh? How am I? That's your tough luck. You can figure it out for yourself. Hey, Limpy. Wait a minute. Take that stallion back to the stable. I've got an order from the bank, Mr Bradley. That half-witted son of mine give him over to Ed Kenyon. I'll come into the bank and fix it with Mr Kenyon. Alright, Mr Bradley. If you'll fix it. Your darn tooting he'll fix it. Go on. Take the horse back to the stable the way I told you in the first place. The idea. Trying to take other people's horses. That confounded son of mine. I wonder how he thinks I can run a breeding farm without a stud. Well, now that you bring it up it would be quite a stunt wouldn't it, grandpa. Selling off all the stock on the place. Moonray will be the next on the list, I suppose. I'm surprised he hasn't tried to sell me. Has he had any offers? Ah, but Duke. Think of it. Brookvale. When I was a young man, Brookvale was the show place of all Saratoga. When I first brought my bride home from Niagara Falls. It was all I could do to get her into the house. She was so crazy about the champions in the stables. You're kind of proud of Brookvale, aren't you grandpa. I was then. Not now. Say. We got more dead horses on this place than live ones. Come here. Look at that. Every one of them champions. There wasn't a line bred in Kentucky could touch this stock. We left those blue grass also-rans on every stretch in America. Why, they toasted Brookvale champions .. And drank champagne out of gold slippers. At the old Haymarket way back in my daddy's day in 1881. There is Ebony Star, the greatest two-year old of the nineties. Pranced home at The Hopeful Stakes. And her record has never been touched. And then there is Blue Bold, and the Flying Demon. By Mad Power .. this one's grandpa. And there is his daddy. Dawn Boy. The greatest stud in the history of American racing. I bred him, trained him and buried him myself. Grandpa, I forgot. Why is it Dawn Boy's grave is out in front of the others? Because Dawn Boy was always out in front of the others. And that is where he is going to finish. Dead or alive. Grandpa, I love you. Mr Clayton. Mr Clayton. A telephone call over long distance from London, England. It's Miss Carol. Ah, she don't want me. She wants her daddy. Tell her he's at the doctor. I can't talk so far, Mr Clayton. I gets too scared. Oh go on, Duke. You talk to her. - Alright. I'm only her grandpa. I can't talk to her. She's got so high and mighty since she's been in Europe .. That she won't talk to nobody but Kings. She's got her daddy worried. She moves around all the time and don't leave no address. Yeah, I know. That brat needs a good spanking. She don't mean nothing, Mr Duke. That's just her way. Rosetta. I love you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, daddy. Daddy, this is Carol. Get ready for a big surprise. I'm going to be married. That's alright with me but don't bring anything home to frighten your dad. Who is this? My name is Duke Bradley. A friend of your father's. Why don't you try it sometime? Put my father on the phone. - Who is it? It's some fool. I would like to speak with my father. He isn't here. Where can he get you? I'm at Northborough House. What's the address? Northborough House is the county seat of the Duke of Northborough. Say, you'd better take that crown off your head and come home. What's that? Who do you think you're talking to? Who is it, darling? Will you please tell me where my father is that I may call him there? Well, if you must know. He's down at the doctor's. He's having a little trouble with his heart. Heart? Is .. is it serious? Well, he'd be better off without it. Tell father I'll take the next boat home. Now you're talking, honey. Even if you must bring that foreign monkey with you. What did he say? - Nothing. I .. And please tell my father that I'm marrying a perfectly good American. Hartley Madison of New York. Who did you say? Hartley Madison. Well, nice going, honey. You certainly hooked a big one. Bring him home. I want to give him a kiss. Hey, wait a minute. Here comes your father now. Hello? Hello? Hello! She hung up on me. That's Miss Carol alright. Chock full of temper ever since she was born. Hello, Frank. I've just talked to your daughter. Carol? How is she, Duke? - Get yourself set for some great news. That little lady has hooked herself a very wealthy chump. Hooked? - Getting married. No. - To Hartley Madison. You don't say. Not that rich New York fellah? - Nobody else. A sucker in the family. Now we'll go places. We'll have a real breeding farm again. Hundreds of brood mares and bloodied stallions. We'll put Brookvale back on the map, where it belongs. My, my. You said it, Rosetta. Just a minute. Do you fellows call him a sucker? Sure. Well, who was it I heard took you for $50,000 once at Belmont? Hartley Madison. I thought so. And he's the sucker, eh? Madison just happened to quit when he was ahead. His old man died I think and he had to take over the business. But if I can only get him back again. Hot dog. I'll help you, Duke. I'll make Carol bring him round. Grandpa, you're a pal. Duke, are you crazy? - Why? Why, a big player like Hartley Madison could wind you up. You or any other bookmaker. He has a bankroll like the US Treasury. Frank, ever since the depression I've been making book for piker bettors. Fifty dollars, a hundred dollars. A thousand dollars, tops. But happy days are here again. Your little girl is bringing home the biggest bettor of all. Well, all I can say is you've got plenty of nerve. Frank, I love you. What did the croaker say, Frank? Did Kenyon send over yet for Miracle Lad? Heck yes, and the Duke here wouldn't let him have him. Wouldn't let him? He's going to fix it up with Ed Kenyon. - No, he's not. Now Frank, this is a matter between grandpa and me. Now, there will be no argument. I won't have it. Now dad, you take that horse over to Kenyon. Say, what kind of a son are you, anyhow? I wish you could figure out how to run a breeding farm without a stud. I can't. I'm going out behind the barn to get drunk. Frank. I wish you'd let grandpa keep his stud. No. Thanks a lot, but I owe you too much already. Say, that reminds me. Come in the other room now, will you. You know, Duke. Carol must really like Madison. It can't be his money because nobody knows I'm broke but you. What about the croaker, Frank? Well, he scared me a little and says I really got a bum heart. There is nothing wrong with me that a winning bet won't cure. There wouldn't be a thing wrong with you at all if you cut out this fool betting. Get wise to yourself, Frank. You can't beat us bookmakers. The old law of averages will flatten out the biggest bankroll in the country. Well, anyway. My bankroll can't take it. This is my last season. Now that Carol is going to be taken care of, I want you to have this. What is it? - Deeds of the farm. Security for the sixty grand I've lost to you. Are you nuts? - Please to take it. Your friendship means a lot to me. You've only known me a bit over a year. - I don't care if it's only for a week. We're pals and you want to give me a mark. Put that thing away. Thanks, Duke. But that's the way it has to be. Please shut up and behave. - I mean it, Duke. I won't take that and you know it. - Now, I'm not going to argue. Now listen here. The croaker told me not to start hollering at anybody. Here, take it. Alright. - Thanks. If that's the way you want it. A funny thing. After all the big heart specialists I've seen. Nothing seems to regulate the old ticker as well as plain bicarbonate of soda. That's right. Golly Duke, I'm glad the kid is getting away from racetracks. You know, I've always wanted her to be something more than a dressed-up gypsy. Here's to you, kid. 50 dollars across on Jay Bloom. 550 to win, 250 to place and a 150 to show on number 748. Hi, Duke. She finally got here. Hello, grandpa. Who got here? - Carol. 10-1 on Rester. Yes sir. 60-10 to win on Rester, number 738. Where is Madison? Is he with her? - Sure he is. Take a gander. Oh .. so that's Frank's kid, huh? Well, the sucker is certainly getting his money's worth. Yeah, but she's got so all-fired high and mighty .. You can't understand a word she says. Rusty Gate, 20 to place. Yes, sir. Rusty Gate. 40-20 to place. Number 410. Here Tip, take charge. Come on, grandpa. Front for me. 10 across on Light Fantasy. Light Fantasy. 60-10. 25-10. 12-10. Number 526. - Right. Hello Frank. - Duke. Hello, Mr Madison. Good to see you again. How are you? You remember him: Duke Bradley. I haven't forgotten what you did to me at Belmont once. Oh, of course. Now, I remember. Well, I won some money from you, didn't I? Some money is right. Duke, this is Carol. - How do you do. Charmed, I'm sure. - What did I tell you. I doubt you remember me, Miss Clayton. - I'm afraid I don't. I talked to you on the phone that day. Duke Bradley? I think you were in some Count's place. Oh. Oh, quite. Congratulations on your engagement. You certainly picked a winner. You know, it's good to see a big bettor back on the track, Mr Madison. Thanks. But I'm only a spectator nowadays. The horses are at the gate. Well, the track isn't much fun if you don't bet. If you're looking for a future customer, you're wasting your time, Mr Bradley. We have no intention of being around the track. Not really? We're only here today because of father. Just slumming, huh? Rather comfortable slumming, Mr Clayton. Hello, Duke. Hello, Fritzi. Why honey, you look as sharp as a razor. Why not? I'm married. - No. Who's the sucker? - Harriet Hale. Who? Harriet Hale. The big coldcream and skin man. His real name is Kiffmeyer. - Oh. Plenty of dough, huh? All the government allows. - Honey, I love you. Fritzi, please meet Miss Clayton. - Oh. I'm pleased to know you. How do you do. And how are you, Mr Clayton? - Well .. My ticker has been missing for forty years and I'm alright. I think he's got a horse doctor. What have you bet on, daddy? - I have a big bet on Jay Blue. Come on, Jay Blue. Daddy? What is it, daddy? Hartley, Hartley. - Take it easy. Look honey, will you fetch my bicarbonate. Of course, dad. Fix me a bicarbonate of soda, please. Sure. How are you, Miss Clayton? - Fine, thanks. Don't worry, dear. He'll be alright. He's gotten so grey and feeble, Hartley. - When did you get back, Miss Clayton? Just the other day. You look mighty pretty. - Thanks. Is it for your dad? - Yes. Thought so. Getting to be quite a habit. - Thank you. Keep it. - Thank you. What is it? Well, what is it? Oh, Hartley. Hello? Who? Mr Bradley? Who wants him? Just a minute. Hey, it's Frank Clayton's girl. What? Back in Saratoga? That means the sucker must be with her. Good morning, Carol. How are you? I'm downstairs in the bank, Mr Bradley. Would you be kind enough to come down? ""At the bank?"" Look Carol, couldn't I meet you somewhere else? ""Banks do something to me."" I'll only detain you a few minutes. I'm in Mr Kenyon's office. ""Kenyon?"" That's the granite-faced old buzzard who took grandpa's Miracle Lad. ""He never smiles. When he was born, they had to open his mouth with a chisel."" ""I couldn't talk to Kenyon. He'd dry me up like a dust storm."" Well, you come down here please. I'm in a hurry. Well, look Carol. I haven't had any breakfast yet. Couldn't you bring Mr Madison up here? Hello .. hello. It's getting to be a habit of hers, hanging up on me. I never knew a banker to lay a decent bet in my life. You know, it must be something about the market that Frank made me take the farm. Hey, I must dig that up and give it to her. Give it to her? - Would you have me keep it? She don't need the farm. She'll own half of New York when she marries that chump. Yeah. But grandpa won't. I guess you've blown your topper. Tippy, I love you. Good morning, Mr Bradley. - Good morning, Ernest. No-one can ever tell me Hartley Madison is through with racing. Why, I can see him now putting down 10, 20, even 50 Gs at a clip. Sure sounds sweet. Come in. Good morning, Carol. Good morning. - Well, come in honey. Thank you. Isn't Mr Madison with you? - No, he isn't. Where is he? - Newport. Newport? - Yes. Not to stay? - We're marrying there next month. Oh. Then he won't be coming back here? - No. And as I told you before .. If you are planning on Mr Madison as a victim you might as well give it all up. Well, you can't blame me for being ambitious. Will you have some breakfast? - I will not. No? Well, would you mind sitting down while I have mine? I came up here to learn what you intend to do with my father's farm. Do with it? - I .. I hope you won't dispose of it without at least giving me a chance to buy it. Oh .. I see. I assure you I dislike asking favors of you. But my grandfather doesn't know you hold a deed to his property. I know that. Well, it would be a kindness if you don't let him know the truth .. Until I can have Mr Madison pay you off. Is that all, before I reach for a hairbrush? I don't know how to parry wisecracks with you. I fear I have been away from America too long. I'll say you've been away too long. Sit down. I see coming here was a mistake. I'll leave things in the hands of the bank. Just a moment. Come in. Hello Duke. Oh, hello Carol. How do you do. Hello baby. Honey, are we off to look at horses? Fritzi, I must have a talk with Carol. Do you mind if we postpone our trip? Why, of course not. I'll see you at the track, Dukey. Fritzi, I love you. Goodbye, Carol. - Goodbye. So you think I'm going to foreclose the mortgage, eh? Now I'm going to tell you what I think of you. I'm not interested in what you think of me. I'll not have the frost put on me by a fellah you roped out of Saratoga .. With clover on her heels and finished up with a bad case of swellhead. It's taken mean old men working in banks all their lives .. To figure out notions you just fastened on me. Me, Duke Bradley. One of the boys. Father's friend. Just a moment. My father could have lost to other bookmakers. It seems to me his friendship paid you mighty well. I'll answer that crack by assuring you no matter what other bookmakers do .. I'm not going to oust grandpa because I love the old pest. You can stop worrying about the farm and start springing the trap .. When the sucker is bankrolled. For your information, I'm marrying Hartley Madison because I love him. This is Duke. You can level with me. - I don't know what you talk about. Don't pretend that Frank's daughter has fallen for a Wall Street chump. A Wall Street chump? Where would you people be if it weren't for the word 'chump'? To you it wins any argument. If you call someone a chump, then it proves you're his superior. You, a fly-by-night bookmaker .. Calling a member of one of the most important families in American a chump. A man who could buy and sell 20 petty gamblers like you with his small change. I suppose you'd marry him if he didn't have a quarter? I'd prefer him that way. Now open that door. Alright. I guess you'd better go ahead and marry the sucker and let him pay me off. That's exactly what I intend to do. You'd better quit kidding yourself about being in love, babe. You know from where I sit a gal that puts the bite on a bridegroom .. For sixty thousand smackers before she even gets him to the altar. Is awfully full of larceny. - What ..? Will you open that door? Sure. Honey, you're strutting like a pacer. This bay filly before you is lot 45 'Dubonnet'. Thoroughbred and registered. Her sire is Giva. One hundred and fifteen thousand dollars. Duke. I'm the most unhappy person in the world. What's the matter? - Dubonnet. The yearling I wanted to buy ever since he was born and my husband isn't here. I got him clear up to the gate but he wouldn't come in. What's the matter? No time? No. He doesn't like horses. They make him sneeze. Did you say 'sneeze'? - Yes, sneeze. Hay fever. Oh there he is, the sweetheart. Who, your husband? - No, that colt. Twenty-five hundred. 25 hundred. The gentleman starts right up. 25 hundred. Do I hear 35? Do I hear 35? Oh, there they go. Now don't you worry, honey. Just lead me to Mr Kiffmeyer. And I'll explain to him that Dubonnet is sneeze-less. No, no. Not the two of us together. - Why not? He's jealous. He thinks I'm Cleopatra and every man is in love with me. Well, who says he's wrong? Oh, darling. I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine. Mr Bradley. - How do you do. How .. how old? - Oh, darling. There is the horse I was talking about. There is Dubonnet. Look. Don't try to change the subject. I said how old? Since I was in the chorus. Oh, there he goes. Well, let him .. go. Look Mr Kiffmeyer. A horse would keep Fritzi from being lonely while you're away on business. What? Yes. And besides, he'd be good publicity for your cold cream. Well, my horses don't need any cold cream. I mean cold cream doesn't need any .. - We know what you mean, dear. Well, you know I can't be around horses. And how do I know what you will be doing around horses? While I can't be around .. horses. Why, Mr K. Do you mean that? Well, I .. I .. why? Fifty-five. Fifty-five hundred is bid. Now then, do I hear six? Do I hear six? Six thousand is bid. Thank you, sir. Whose bid was that, please? Whose bid was that, please? Thank you, sir. Six thousand is bid. Now then, do I hear six-five? Gesundheit. Well, you needn't bother. Sold for six thousand. What is the name please? Mr Jessie Kiffmeyer of New York. Here, what are you doing? Sold to Mr Jessie Kiffmeyer of New York. Good work, Mr K. You can't .. we can't .. Boys, how long will to take a picture of Mr Kiffmeyer? Why? Never mind. But I'm all out of plates. - That's alright. There he is, boys. The new owner of Dubonnet. You can't bamboozle me into this. - Fix his tie, Fritzi. Let me make you pretty, honey. - I won't buy that horse. Kiffmeyer is his name but he's enthroned by 50 million women as 'Harriet Hale'. Is that who she is? - The greatest cosmetician in the world. Well, 'beautician' is the more modern term. Hold up your head, Mr Hale. - Miss Hale. Well, 'Kiffmeyer' will do. I beg your pardon, Mr Kiffmeyer. - Yes? Please make arrangements with the cashier. I'm not .. Stay here Kiffy at a good sneezing distance while I go settle for Dubonnet. I'll go help you. - No, wait a minute. I'll take care of your wife. I mean you take care of .. Hi, Duke. Hello, grandpa. I wish you'd talk to that girl. I can't do a thing with her. What girl? - Carol. Carol? She's in Newport. - Newport, nothing. She's right over there getting ready to sell Moonray. The last yearling I've got on the place. Don't worry now. I'll go and see what I can do. Good evening, Carol. - Well, good evening. So you didn't go to Newport, huh? No, I'm at Coney Island. Why Carol, that almost sounded like a crack. You think you ought to sell grandpa's colt? I've found I must have some money. Money? I'll pay you off before my marriage. - Pay me off? Not because of that crack I made about you clipping Madison? That had nothing to do with it. I thought things over. That's all. Well, I think you're an awful sucker. If I had a come-on I'd marry him myself. Besides, this yearling won't bring you more than a few thousand dollars. I can run it up to what I owe you. Run it up? On your stocking? - Bet it. You can't beat the law of averages, Carol. No? - No. Even though you know the track and know all about handicapping horses. That's your opinion. What does Mr Madison think about you postponing his wedding? Mr Madison recognises that there is such a thing as integrity. Oh, I see. Say Carol, if you're ready to sell that horse, they're waiting for you. Evening, Miss Clayton. - Good evening. Good evening. Alright, Miss Clayton. Ladies and gentlemen, this yearling colt is Moonray. He was bred at the Brookvale farm and is by our famous sire Dawn Boy. His dam is that great race mare .. Planet Girl. He has been handled and broken since the first of the year. He has a grand disposition and with his royal breeding .. In a capable trainer's hands should develop into a great racehorse. Thank you. You heard what Miss Clayton has said about this colt. Now what is your pleasure, ladies and gentlemen? One thousand dollars. A thousand dollars. Do I hear two? Do I hear two? Ha. A thousand dollars? His tail is worth more than that. Be still, grandpa. What did I ever do to have such a grandchild? A thousand dollars. Cripes. Five thousand dollars. Five thousand is bid. Thank you. Five. Five. Well, as I live and breathe it is Hartley Madison. And he went for five grand the first clip. What a beautiful sucker. Here's where you get your stake, honey. - But I don't want .. Look out, Mr Madison. I'm coming into this. Go ahead old boy. - Fifty-five hundred. Six thousand. Sixty-five. What are you doing? Bookmakers can't own horses. I'm going to run the stake in for you, honey. Seventy-five. - Good for you. Eight. Say, you're going rather high on the colt aren't you? Think so? Eighty-five. - Stop it, will you. Oh, let him alone. Nine. Nine thousand is bid. Ninety-five. Ten thousand dollars. I don't want him to be stung for more than fifteen thousand. Oh you're crazy. He'll go for twenty. Ten-five. Don't go over fifteen Duke, please. Eleven. Eleven-five. I must just say hello to Hartley. Eleven-five the gentleman bids. Do you make it twelve? That colt isn't worth that much. Twelve thousand. Hello, sweet. - Hello, darling. Twelve-five. Let him have him at fourteen-five. But why dear? Thirteen. I see larceny in your granddaughter's kisser. You do? Please do as I say. Darling, I'd like to own Moonray. - Won't you do this for me? Of course I'll do this for you. Fourteen thousand. - Now let him have him. Fourteen-five. Mr Madison, you've bought a horse. Swell. - But .. But what, dear? - Don't you see that he was trying .. Don't you want me to have Moonray? Well, of course I do, but .. Well, Mr Madison. That was a lot of fun. - Hey, wasn't it. Why did you quit? You know, Carol wanted you to have Moonray. She did? - Yeah. Now, wasn't that sweet of her. Mr Madison, what are you going to do with that yearling of mine? I know you didn't buy him for yourself. How are you, Mr Clayton? - Alright. What are you going to do with him? I got a birthday coming up this month. Grandpa. - Oh shut up. If you want him well trained, nobody can do it better than grandpa. That's an idea. Would you keep Moonray on at Brookvale and train him for me? Of course he won't. - Why not? Darling, he would be doing me a favor. Will you? Oh here I am ending up as nursemaid to a yearling I don't own. And I ain't even got a stud. I sure could use one. Mr Madison. Think you'll do any betting while you're down this time? I don't know. Perhaps. Mr Madison, will you make arrangements with the cashier, please. Oh yes, of course. Duke, look after Carol for me, will you. - With pleasure. You leave him alone. Carol, if a man wants to make a few little bets, why can't I .. I told you Mr Madison wasn't betting. Now leave him alone. You know, you're kind of cute. Do you want to take my bets by any chance? Carol, if you only bring a man around the track once in a while .. Do you want to take my bet? - Oh sure. Alright. Weight a hundred and ten pounds.  I guess that's Miss Fritzi. I guess Mr Duke told her something funny. Will you be still. Look here, honey. You is going to have a nervous breakup working so hard. Belmont, Aqueduct and Maryland. You ain't had a day's rest since we left Saratoga. He's carrying a hundred and fifteen pounds. That means he's picking up five.  Will you tell Mr Bradley I'd like to see him. I sure will. You got a pencil smudge on your chin, honey. What of it? Don't you want to look pretty for Mr Bradley? Why should I? I would fix up for him anytime. If he was only the right color, I'd marry him.  Come in. Good evening, Carol. I didn't know you were on this train. How long will those friends of yours keep up that racket? Surely honey, you haven't forgot how the mob acts on a racing special. We're likely to whoop it up all night. Why not join us and have a little fun? I'm afraid I've gotten away from that idea of 'fun'. Oh .. oh, I see. How are they coming? - I can't complain. No, I should think not. Do you realize you've nicked my books for thirty-seven hundred dollars? Thirty-seven fifty. - No. Why, if this luck of yours keeps up, I'll cut my throat. Oh, it's luck, is it? - What do you call it? I'm afraid I call it hard work. Say honey. If it's noisy here you can change with me and take my compartment. No. No thank you. No trouble. I'll move the stuff. - I prefer not. Rosetta. Tell the porter to switch our bags. I sure will. If there's a crap game there, tell the boys to get out. I will. - And don't get in the game. You go on, Mr Duke. Is this everything? - Yes. Excuse me. Hello, Miss Clayton. - Hello, Clipper. Look folks, we've got an Frank's daughter. Good for you. Thanks. Hello, honey. Good evening, Mrs Kiffmeyer. Hello Fritzi. - Hello, Duke. Hello Miss Clayton. - Hello. You remember 'handwriting Hurley'? - Oh. How are you? Gee, Miss Clayton. It's good to see you. - Thanks. I've been thinking about you a lot since .. since your dad went. He thought a lot of you, too. Hurley. I bet she doesn't remember this one. Hello Miss Clayton. Why that's the baby. Little Katy. It's little Katy, but it's not the baby. Come here .. oh, Pearl. Hello, Miss Clayton. Here is the final edition. Pearl, how you do things. Oh you angel. May I take one. - Of course. Oh Miss Clayton, you've come back home again. Teddy, look out. Duke, take the baby. - Yeah, yeah. Katy, you're going to smother me, honey. Katy, will you be careful and come here and sit down. Hey, take this guy will you. No, Duke. Okay. You're out in front. - Well, here .. Here, take this sucker before I break him. No. You can keep him. I've got another one here. But I didn't want him. Say, I'm doing alright with this guy. Say, Duke. I must hit you for five bucks. You too. What for? - Duggan lost his job. Kick in the green, fellahs. I'd like to get in on that too, sweet. - That's swell. Thanks. Add it for me please. - Okay. Come on fellahs, let's see the green. Hey, Pearl. I think you'd better take this guy. - Oh, of course. Pearl, you'd better take this one too.

The gang won't disturb you in here. You think I'm an awful snob, don't you. No, I wouldn't say that. - I know you do. There are really other things in the world beside racetracks. Well, yes. I suppose there are. - You've never been to Europe, have you? Nope. You should see England sometime. You mean Ascot, Epsom Downs, Newmarket? They must be swell. No. I wasn't thinking about racetracks. Oh no. That's right. You ought to see one of those big English country houses .. Where one family has carried on for centuries. You know, traditions of sportsmanship .. Honor handed down from father to son. Oh yeah, like a line of thoroughbreds, huh? Well, yes. Did you ever look at an old painting and know just what the artist .. Wanted you to feel when he painted it 400 years ago? No, I never did. - Well, I learned all of those things. You know what you'd like? Punting on the Thames. With the oaks making a green roof and the sky coming through. Hey, I did punt once when I was a kid. In a mud scow on the Ohio. There are so many things to do in the world. So many things to see. And so many wonderful people to meet. Now, Carol. I never got you before. I begin to see what you're driving at. You are? - Yeah. I believe I'd go for those things myself in a big way if I wasn't such a mug. You're not a mug. You've got brains, looks, personality .. Will you quit your kidding. - I'm not kidding. Gee honey, it kinda gives me a lift to know you feel that way. I'm all for you getting the things you want. Thanks. I'm glad you understand. I do. But you never put it to me straight like that before. I know. I'm sorry. Say look. I've got an idea that will put us both closer to punting on the Thames. You have? What is it? When you get to Florida, where will you stay? The Park Central. Well go on, Duke. Well, when we get there .. you phone Madison and have him come down. Now all you have to do is to say the word and he'll come running. Then. Let him do a little betting with me. I'll cut you in for 20% of my winnings. And gee honey, you'll have that market paid off in no time at all. Get out of here. What? - I said get out of here. Why, what's the matter? Nothing, except that I thought you had a grain of decency. Don't be like that. You brought me here just for this. Now get out. You'll get wise to .. - Get out of here. Alright, alright. Carol, you don't belong to this .. - I said, get out! Why, Miss Carol. Tell me child, what is the matter? I never want to see that cheap, swell-headed .. Smart-aleck bookmaker again as long as I live. Oh Miss Carol. Why, honey. Baby. Just a minute, please. - Hello, Mr Madison. Hello Bradley. Why are you in New York? - I came to see you. Really? - Yes. This place is tougher to crash than the pearly gates. Duke, will you excuse me just a minute? - Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Where was I? 'If they could be procured on a satisfactory basis ..' I am willing to pay 101 net to me for a commitment up to a million and a half. Kindly advise me regarding this immediately. Yours, etc. That's all. Shall we do any of that new government issue, Mr Madison? I'll see about that later on. - Yes, sir. Now what can I do for you, Duke? Well. It's about Carol. Carol? What's wrong? Carol needs you, Mr Madison. She's not well. No? Why, I spoke to her last night in Baltimore before she left for Florida. Did she seem alright? She didn't say anything about not being. - She didn't seem nervous, irritable? Well, now you mention it. Yes she did. Yes, yes. You know, Carol is not her old self at all. She's seen a doctor? - No. No she hasn't and she's just a bundle of nerves. Why, do you know that last night on the train I tried to make her send for you. And believe it or not she ordered me out of the compartment. She did? - Yes. Flew into a rage. That's bad, Duke. That's very bad. She takes this job of hers so seriously. - Yes. I'm afraid she does. I think you should go to Florida and talk with her. Well, maybe you are right. Yes. With you there to bounce around the track and help her pick those winners .. I'll go, Duke. I'll go right away and .. And say, I'll take Dr Bierd with me. That's what I'll do. He'll find out what's the matter. Hello, get me Dr Bierd on the phone. Dr Harmsworth Bierd. - Now look, Mr Madison. You needn't do that. There's plenty of good doctors down there. Nobody like Bierd. The best nerve specialist this side of Vienna. Yes, I know. But a big doctor like that, he might upset her terribly. But at least he'll find out what's the matter. Hello? Hello Dr Bierd, can you fly to Florida with me right away? Now look, Mr Madison, I don't think .. We are going today. It is for my fiance. It's a bad case of nerves and I want you to look her over. Well, we're leaving from Roosevelt Field in a couple of hours. Uhuh. Alright, I'll pick you up. Goodbye. May I assist you, Miss Washington? - Thank you, Mr Meyers. Why, Miss Carol, there is Mr Madison. Don't be silly, Rosetta. Mr Madison is in New York. Carol. Darling. - Hello, honey. Why sweetheart, what's the matter? - What are you doing down here? Darling, Duke said you weren't feeling up to scratch. Oh, he did? See, I had to go back to New York on business. So, naturally I dropped in to see Hartley and .. Well, here we are. Thought I'd help you pick some winners. - I don't need any help. Why Carol, of course you don't. And darling, it's .. Oh, Dr Bierd. Oh yes. Dr Bierd just happened to be coming down too. This is Miss Clayton, Dr Bierd. Oh yes, yes. How do you do, my dear? - How do you do. I thought Dr Bierd could look you over. What for? What is the meaning of this? You see, Hartley was very worried .. - What are you talking about? Now don't get excited. - Who's excited? Nobody. I'm sorry if I upset you. I'm not upset, but let's get out of here. Carol. Carol. Haven't you forgotten something? What? Oh well, go ahead dear. Don't mind us. Of course not. Of course not, what? You haven't kissed Hartley hello. Aren't you glad to see him? - What do you think? This is absolutely ridiculous, doctor. I said there's nothing wrong with me. Quiet now. Just relax. Miss Clayton, when was your wedding originally planned? Last August. - That's five months ago. Dear, dear, dear, dear. There's nothing organically wrong with that little heart. But it's beating much, much too fast. I told you I was alright. Of course. But you are a highly emotional type. What are you drivelling about? You are a woman who's entire system is regulated by her emotions. You should be married now. And cooing contentedly in your own dear little nest. What? And now I want you to take a soothing lukewarm effervescent bath. I will send you a masseuse who'll give you a light gentle massage. And then in this quiet, darkened room you can have a restful, peaceful nap. I've let you spoil my day at the track. But I won't take a warm, dark effervescent nap for you or anyone else. Dear, dear, dear. Mr Madison should never have come down. Neither should you. - Now, now. My dear child. There is nothing wrong with me. I am perfectly normal. That's just it. Entirely too normal. I suggest you see as little as possible of your fiance until you are married. And I hope I may soon have the pleasure of an invitation to that wedding. Goodbye. Bless your heart. Hey ho. What is it? - Oh, it's nothing, really. Are you alright, darling? What's happened? It's just nerves. You see, she's .. Would you excuse us? - Yes. What did you find? Is it serious? - Yes. But it's no case for a doctor. Well, what is it? 'Amor solum a medicina sanari non posse'. What does that mean? It means that love cannot be cured by pills. Love? Why .. You mean ..? - Uhuh. Why, the poor little darling. - Yes. She ought not to see too much of you. - Alright. We make it as easy for her as possible. - Oh yes. Yes, of course. I'll see you before I leave. - Alright. Thanks. You are a very lucky man. - Hmm. Goodbye, Mr Bradley. - Goodbye, doctor.  ""Nineteen horses are lined up."" This is the race that Carol is on. - Really? Uhuh. Rosetta. Want a hot tip? Yes sir, Mr Duke. Give me something I can hope for. Ski Ball. 3-1. I got it right from the horse himself. Won't them other horses be surprised? I'm going to bet two bucks on him. Oh, make it five. - Alright, Mr Duke. I'll make it ten. Ski Ball? That's Carol's one isn't it? - Uhuh. Want a bet? No, I don't think so. Oh, why not do it for Carol? She's got that wedding date. They've started. Invite me to the wedding and I'll take it. ""At the turn it's Ski Ball by a length."" - Look at that Ski Ball go. Man, look at her go. Odds on Ski Ball now? That's what I offer. How about a thousand dollars? - Make it two. Alright. You're on. - My, oh my. Come in. Will you want me again, Mr Madison? No, that's all today. Come on, Ski Ball. Come on. ""At the three quarters, it's Ski Ball by four lengths."" ""Mink Coat is second by a head."" Where is Gloria Kay? Not mentioned. - Where's Rocket? Left at the post. Were you on Rocket? - Yes. Too bad. I could have given you Ski Ball. Come on. Come on, Ski Ball. Come on. Come on. - Come on Ski Ball. ""It's Ski Ball by five lengths."" Yo! Ain't that Ski Ball a sweetheart? My, oh my .. Did you lose much, Boswell? - Two dollars, sir. That's too bad. Here you are, Rosie. Thank you, Mr Duke. It's just like you made us a present. I'll give you a check, Hartley. - That's alright, Duke. Oh, hello honey. When did you come in? I came in with Ski Ball. One touch of horse flesh makes the whole world, kid. Darling, I won six thousand dollars on Ski Ball. Well, isn't that fine. - Yes, the man is a wizard. For your fund. We are six thousand dollars nearer our wedding day. I can't do that, Hartley. - Why, darling .. Now honey, you're spoiling half of Hartley's fun. Please. I've got to do this myself. You know that. Alright, darling. Just as you say. Duke .. it's been a long time since Hartley and I have seen each other. Do you mind? Oh no. No, of course not. Thanks, Duke. Hartley, when you going to pick a new winner? Oh, I'll make some selections in the morning. Why don't we all have luncheon together on the patio and go to the track later? That's fine. You know, I think Florida is going to do us all some good. Be careful you don't get sunstruck. Isn't she cute? Hartley. I don't want you betting with that fellow. Why not? - Because .. Because, can you see what he's trying to do? He's trying to get you to start betting again. But sweetheart, Duke always lost to me. Look what I did to him today. - That doesn't matter. You don't belong to the track. What do you know about handicapping horses? It's all simply a .. - Carol, wait. What you are trying to tell me is .. Well. Is that .. that you want me to go, isn't it? Yes. Well, I understand, sweetheart. It's alright. Understand what? Why you want me to go. You see, Dr Bierd explained it to me. Dr Bierd? - Uhuh. Dr Bierd ..? But darling, there is nothing to be ashamed of. 'The chump with the dreamy eyes'. 'He'll go boom ti-di ad-da-da da-da-da boom ti-di eh'. What do you think you're doing? - Getting the odds ready for Hartley. Yeah, that was a great idea of yours. Giving him 3-1 on Ski Ball today. I think so. Do you know that Ski Ball was a 10-7 shot? Why you're the meanest man I ever saw. Denying a poor little sucker his bait. Did you say 'sucker'? The trouble with you is you don't know how to deal with the bigtime operators. Why, in ten days we'll be rolling in dough. Yes, and in thirty minutes he'll be rolling off the flying field. His bags are down on the sidewalk now. What? He's leaving for New York. And he took you for six G's. If he's a sucker, I'm a goldfish. Where you going, chump?  Is that you, Rosetta? - Yes, ma'am. It's me. Well, come in. Well. It's Bradley. Fancy seeing you here. So you sent him away, huh? - Of course I did. You didn't think I'd let him stay? - Why you double-crosser. Hello. Hello. Get me room 218. Nice weather for Hartley's flight. Hello, Tip? Pack me a bag right away. I'm catching a plane with Madison. Yeah. Okay. That will do you a lot of good. - All we need is a radio. You've been to Hartley's office, haven't you? Yep. And of course, he'll just drop everything. What do his financial transactions amount to? He'll disregard the stock market and .. Simply devote his time to listening to the radio with you. Look, Carol. Won't you let me have him for just ten days? I think you'd better go now. Hartley phoned and he's coming to say goodbye. Well, what of it? He won't like you if he finds you here. No. That wouldn't look so good for you either, would it? I'll explain: you forced your way in.  Wait a minute. What are you doing? If you're so good at explaining, explain this. Will you come out of there, Duke. - If I were you, I'd ask him to stay. Hartley might not like it if I happen to make some noise.  Duke. Please. Please. Will you come out of there.  Carol, I haven't much time, sweet. Is that you dear? Come in. Hello, sweet. I am sorry. I was too sore. No, no. Don't get up. I've only time to kiss you goodbye. Darling, it's been wonderful being with you. And I do hope that you will feel .. Is there ..? Sweetheart. Well, what is it, Hartley? When did you ..? When did you ..? When did I what? When did you start smoking cigars? Oh, I just picked it up. I am trying to obey doctor's orders. He said .. No more cigarettes. But dear, you'll make yourself ill. Yes. Well, I've got to do something for my nerves. I know darling, but cigars? And that's a strong one. I know. I .. I won't smoke it anymore if you don't want me to, Hartley. You poor darling. I'm so worried about you. But you mustn't worry about me. What is it, sweet? Hartley. I wish you'd stay in Florida. You do, dear? - Yes. Well, darling, I'd only be too happy to stay. That is .. well .. If you are sure my being here wouldn't upset you. Why, of course it wouldn't upset me. I want you to stay. But you said this afternoon .. - Yes. I know. But I'm nervous. Sometimes .. I want you to go and sometimes I want you to stay. Right now I want you to stay. - I know. What difference if I am nervous? What difference if I am a little upset? I want you stay. Don't you see, darling? I couldn't do that. You are too considerate, Hartley. You always think of everybody but yourself. Why shouldn't you have a holiday? Darling, I'm going to go. Please. - No. Please, Hartley. - No more. You mustn't go. You can't go. I won't let you. Darling, we settled all that this afternoon. Now please calm yourself. And believe me darling, I know what's best. Alright .. whatever you say. Goodbye, sweet. Bless your little heart. You will go straight to bed now won't you, darling. And please don't smoke any more of those things. I won't. I'll phone when I get to New York. Goodbye. - Goodbye, darling. Why, the man is an iceberg. Now I've got to steam him up all over again. I hope you weren't too uncomfortable. Well, it was pretty warm until you smoked that cigar. I'll send you a box sometime. Oh but baby, how you went to town for Dukey. You idiot. I did the one thing that would send him away. You did? What was that? - I kissed him. And that sent him away? Oh Carol, you underestimate yourself. You don't understand. Hartley happens to be a gentleman. Oh. Then I'm glad I'm a mug. Kiss me like that and see if I go home. Well .. You don't think that I tried to make him stay here for you, do you? Oh no, no. Of course not. Why, I never dreamed of it. I sent him away. - Yeah. You don't believe me, do you? - Sure, sure. I believe you. Didn't I hear it? He went because the doctor told him I was .. The doctor told him that you were what? - That I was .. Nothing. Will you please leave? Honey. I love you. You and your sucker, huh? We trail him to New York. I bet you all I got against a quarter we get him back. Yeah. Just like your girlfriend got him to stay here for you. Carol tried to get him to stay. She went to town for me like a little champion. She did, huh? She double-crossed you like a 6th Avenue girl. And you thought you were shoving her around. Ha. What a ladies' man. What a ladies' man. Hello Duke. Will you say that again? - Say what? Well, is it really you? - Surprised, are you? Well, no. Not exactly. Sit down. - Thanks. Carol fairly insisted on my staying. She stopped me at the airport. She did? - Yeah. Well, bless her little heart. Meet Carol's fiance. This is my sheet writer. How do you do. - I'm certainly pleased to meet you. Thanks .. say Duke, there is horse Carol likes today: Rester. Rester? - Yes. Did you say 'Rester'? - And Carol likes him? Yeah. Well, he's in this next race. They are at the post now. Oh is he? What price can you give me? How about five thousand? - Hartley, you got a bet. Where's the lady? She's a headache. She's staying in her room. Oh, that's too bad. I'm sorry. Come on, Rester. Come on, Rester! Say .. where is Rester now? I'm afraid he's running a bad third. Yes. I am afraid. Come on. Rester seems to be falling behind. Slightly. Yes, he's now running a deep last. - Carol must have had a headache. Yes, she must have. Well, he'll be home in time for dinner. Anyway, it took eight horses to beat him. That's right. Well, I've got to get back to the hotel and see Carol. Give her my love. - Thanks. I'll give you a check tonight, Duke. - Alright. Put it on tomorrow's bet. Thanks. See you later, boys. - So long. Well, I've certainly got to hand it to you. Is he worthwhile waiting for. But .. why did she ever pick Rester? Why do you think? - Huh?  Dukey, I love you. Mr Bradley. - Morning. One? Hello, Duke. How's things at Huntingdon Downs? Okay. No, never mind. Well, this is luck. Good morning, honey. How are you? Duke. Oh madam, you look broadminded. I've loved this woman for years. You're lucky. Mine only lasted two days. Duke, you remember my husband? Oh yes. Brother Kiffmeyer. How do you do? How do you do. - I didn't know you were on the train. No, that's quite obvious. Would you mind dropping my wife's hand? Where would I drop it? Out the window? - Don't try to laugh your way out of it. Madam, I ask you. Is there anything wrong with this? I wish she'd change places with me. - There. You see? There you see. You were so afraid my wife would be lonely if I didn't buy her horses. Well, I bought her horses. And now I wonder whether she's around the country with horses or whether .. She's around the horses with you. You heard what she said. Madam, would you rather be around horses or would .. or would ..? Mister, I'm afraid you don't understand us women. I? I don't understand women? Madam. Do you know who I am? I haven't the slightest idea. - Yes. Well, I'm Harriet Hale. Not the beauty queen? Exactly, and now Mr Bradley. If you would .. Can you say why your foundation cream always cakes when you put on powder? Cakes? My cream cakes? Madam, you don't know how to apply it. And madam, here for you .. - I'd say you don't know how to make it. Madam. Harriet Hale's foundation cream. Has been the basis for women's beauty for twenty years. Now Mr Bradley, I just want .. - Kiffy please. Well, just a moment. - So how do you apply it? With a circular motion. Don't you read the directions? I tried that. Yes. Well, from now on madam, your face is in your own hands. That's a fine way to talk to your public. Well I .. Yes. Well, I'm sorry. I was distraught. Yes. I distraught him. You keep out of this. If you come to my compartment, madam, I will show you how to apply it. May I watch? If you so much as speak to your wife .. I mean .. his wife. We know whose wife you mean, darling. Well just .. Mr Hale, you'll never know how my face looked before I used your preparation. Yes. Well, I can imagine. All I want to say to you, Mr Bradley is .. I don't fool you for a minute. I mean you don't fool .. You're a pernicious influence. Oh Kiffy, why don't you show the lady how to use the cream? Oh, so you want to get rid of me. That's it, is it? Alright. I'll see you in the compartment. And alone. Do you think he can do my face any good? Well, look at me madam. And I'm forty-five years old. Why, you don't look twenty-five. Well, that's what Harriet Hale has done for me. What's the number of Mr Hale's compartment? 6B. Car 51. Thank you. I'll leave the door open. Thanks. Poor Kiffy. Isn't he an old darling. The salt of the earth. If he just wasn't so jealous. Not only that. You know. He's a pretty smart guy when he's away from the track. A lot smarter than I'd be. - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning, Rosetta. How is Miss Carol? - That cold she caught is worse. It is? - Yes, Mr Duke. I came to get her some more juice so she can take some castor oil .. But I know she won't take it. - Yes she will. You hustle up the orange juice. Bring me some too. Yes, sir. I'd say it's tough on a kid .. Knocking around the country all alone trying to beat the ponies. Yes. You're in love with her Duke, aren't you? Who? - Carol. What makes you think so? - Oh, I've been around the block. I knew it before you did. No you didn't. I knew it the first time I took a hinge at her. Why don't you tell her so? Well Fritzi, Carol's father was my best friend. The last thing he ever said to me was he wanted her to get away from this racket. To be something better than a dressed-up gypsy. I can't ask her to leave what Madison gives her .. Just to knock around a racetrack with me. If she loved you, she'd be happy staying in a barn. No, Fritzi. I haven't the dough to fix up Brookvale the way it was for her and grandpa. And to sure that it would always be kept that way. You know, security. And I expect to get it from Mr Madison. Madison is going to make you and Carol comfortable? And grandpa. Why, you magnificent so and so. Fritzi, I love you. I'll go and give her that medicine. Who is it? - It's Duke. Just a minute. What's the matter, honey? - I'm not dressed. Well, put on something. I don't look good in 'something'. Well then, put on 'anything'. You could be dressed for the Arctic by now. Come in. Good morning, honey. How are you feeling? - I'm fine. Say, you look great in that Kimono. Thanks, but it's a negligee. Well, what did you want, Duke? - What? Oh, I came to doctor that cold of yours. Hey, you've got a fever. - No, it's warm in here. That's all. Oh yeah? Well, I think you'd better get into this bed. Were you in this horse blanket when I knocked just now? Yes. Rosetta brought it for me. Alright. You get right back in it. I know you're pretty. Well. But I .. - Come, now. Get in this bed. This is more work that I've done for a woman since my mother. You got any goose-grease around here? - There is something in that case there. But I don't need anything, Duke. Hey, that's a pretty swell layout. Everything but a pipe. A present from Hartley? - Yes. Isn't that just like him. Thoughtful until the last detail. I don't want that. It smells. - Alright then. Hold your nose. Did Kiffy and Fritzi make the train? - Sure. I just left them. Oh you did? Are you in love with her, Duke? With Fritzi? How you talk. Well, Kiffy thinks you are. Did he tell you that, too? Isn't he cute, the old sweetheart. Only me and fifty others. Roll over. - No. I don't want to. Come on, roll over. - Oh Duke. What's the matter? Oh, I was thinking about that night in Miami. When you tried to smoke my cigar? - If I live to be a thousand .. I'll never forget the way you looked coming out from underneath that couch. Lie still, will you. Lie still. Okay, will you lie still. What's the matter? Here. You alright? Yes. I'm alright now. You had me scared there for a minute. Hey, Duke. Yeah. What is it honey? I love you, Duke. Say, what are you trying to do? Steal my gag line? Isn't it about time we quit kidding ourselves. Kidding ourselves? - Yes. I've just been riding Hartley. Breaking our engagement. You what? It's all over. I never want to see him again. You never want to see him again? - No, I'm breaking it all off. Great guns, honey. He'll be coming down to Kentucky. You can't do that to me. What? I can't do what to you? - Take my chump out of circulation. I can't ..? I can't do it to you? Well, how do you like that. - What's the matter? I see what I've been to you. Just a come on, a steer girl. Will you talk sense. Stop dramatizing. - A steer girl, just a steer girl. There you see. Now get back under those covers. You get out of my room. You get back under those covers. What are you trying to do? Catch pneumonia. Here, take this. - It's the wrong one. I will not. - Take it. Alright. Now, that's a fine thing to do. And to think I nearly let him go. A man. A real man. That's just what I was telling you. The most beautiful man in the world. He is, eh? Right, I'll get him for you. - You will? I'll get him for you in Kentucky. - Honey, now you're talking. I'll handicap for him .. And he'll wind you up on a street corner with a tin cup in your hand. Thank you, honey. And here's luck. My, my. Dixie Gordon has grabbed the lead and he's riding pretty. Looks like you made a bad bet, Hartley. - Hurley's passed him though. When Gordon gets out in front he's hard to catch. Hurley is riding the best horse though. That's why Carol picked him. Hurley is moving up. Come on. Hurley is giving him his head. He will pass Gordon at the turn. Want to double your bet? I'll give you four to one now. Huh? Take it. Okay. - You're on. Gordon is sure giving your horse a ride. - He certainly is. Try it on the outside, Hurley. - I've got the right of way. Stay back or I'll put you into the fence. Who went down? - Hurley. Hurley? That's done it. The little fellow is alright, honey. Just shaken up a bit, that's all. Can you beat that Dixie coming home on a nag that couldn't pull a laundry wagon. Duke .. Duke. Fritzi. Did you see Dixie ride? And I have him. I got him on contract for The Hopeful. What? - Yeah. So The Hopeful is in your pocket, Fritzi. Honey, I love you. Wait a minute. I want you all to witness that I've ordered this man to keep .. It's alright. Don't apologise. - I'm not apologising to you. You keep away from my wife. That's all I'm telling you now or .. Kiffy, look out. You've got the horses doing it. Don't you try to laugh your way out of this. I can't stay around horses. Come on. You'd better watch out, Duke. Do you mind, dear? Let's go. - Right, darling. See you at the hotel. Fine. Too bad you lost today. Better luck next time. Thank you, honey. - What for? For getting Hartley to double his bet. What do you want to make her mad for? The madder she gets, the more she makes him bet and the worse she handicaps him. Hey, son. - Yes? A Coke? No, no. I just want one of these cups. Take her this and tell her I'm sorry it isn't tin. Thank you. Oh, Carol. Duke asked me to give you this and tell you he's sorry it isn't tin. My, my. Oh Miss Carol, here is some more tin cups from Mr Duke. Throw them out. - All of them? Throw them out. - Yes, ma'am. Does you want to hear the note? - No. Well, it says: 'Remember Dukey'. Ain't he the tease? He teases me about my complexion. And he teases you about Mr Madison losing all that money. And he teases Mr Kiffmeyer about his wife. He's always teasing somebody. But nobody gets mad except you and Mr Kiffmeyer. Get me the United States Hotel. These cups is just what I need to put my knick-knacks in. Throw them things in the ashcan. Get Mr Kiffmeyer. Mr Jesse Kiffmeyer. Can't I have just one to remember him by? Throw those things in the ashcan. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yes, this is .. oh, Miss Clayton. Yes, of course Dixie Gordon's contract is in my name. You see, my financial responsibility .. Oh. My wife and that Bradley? Yes. Well, I'd do anything. I mean .. Almost anything. You do? Oh, you don't. Oh you do? Oh. You don't. Well, I mean .. You do. Yes, you can have the contract. You can have the horse if you want to. Well, just hold the phone. I'll see if it's here. Just .. one moment please.  ""It has a lucky new swing."" ""Saratoga.""

What a charming name. Gentlemen, I give you Moonray. I say Hartley, a racing chap up at the hotel .. Has given me Dubonnet to win on account of his jockey. Dixie Gordon is the best money riding jockey on the turf. But Moonray is a great horse. And horses have a little bit to do with racing you know. Hartley, I'm afraid you prejudiced. Maybe, but I think my horse is going to win. And I'm backing .. Ah, of course .. Carol doesn't agree with me but I'm backing him nevertheless. Excuse me, gentlemen. Shall we dance, darling? Why do you aggravate me like this? Wait a minute, Carol. I've lost a lot of money on your handicapping. If I want to bet on my horse it's my risk. But why must you bet tonight? By race time tomorrow, Duke's odds might change. Hello there, you two lovebirds. - Hello, Steve. Keep right on. We don't want to interfere with romance. Thank you. I tell you Moonray can't win tomorrow with Dixie Gordon on Dubonnet. That's your opinion, but my new trainer thinks he can. Your new trainer is trying to keep his job. He can't do any more for Moonray than grandpa did. You're darn tooting. Putting a new-fangled trainer on Moonray. Why, I raised him on the bottle from the time he was four. And nursed him through that bad sickness in September. We know that, grandpa. His sire had distemper twice in '31. And his granddaddy had a quarter crack a month before The Preakness. And I cured them both. Did you know that? - Yes. You told me that Mr Clayton. Yeah. Well, they was both champions. Moonray will be a champion, too. Go and take him away from me just before The Hopeful when he needs me the most. I've been just like a father to him. - Oh, please, grandpa. Moonray ain't going to fold up tomorrow. I got him ready. He's a fit horse. And he'll win. He ain't going to forget nothing I told him. Grandpa, why are you taking your shoes off? I'm taking them off so I won't kick that new trainer of yours. That isn't funny, grandpa. - You ain't funny either. And he's blowed his topper. Shall we go inside? - Yes, Hartley. Goodnight. Confound this halter. Household full of Newport chumps. Nothing in the stable but dry rot. A new trainer. My dogs hurt. Hey .. who are you? Shush. Please, I'm a .. Are you the caretaker here? - Caretaker? Why you infernal jackass. My grandfather built this dump. Oh, well. I'm very sorry. I want to see Miss Clayton. What about? Well, it's .. it's something personal. Very Private? Private? Why you old fool. You're old enough to be her father. What do you mean? Are you insinuating? Why, I am a married man. I wonder. - Here you is, Mr Clayton. Would you tell Miss Clayton I would like to see her at once? It's very important. Yes, sir. Come right in. - No, ask her to come out here please. Yes, sir. You know, I don't know what it is .. But there is something about you I don't like. Oh. Well, if you feel that way, I must say I don't like you very much either. Hello, Mr Kiffmeyer. Miss Clayton, I wanted .. Grandpa, do you mind? Do I mind what? It? I'm going down to the barn where it don't smell. Do you think that we'd better ..? Well, how about it? Well, it's a great idea, but do you .. Think that I am doing the right thing? Is Duke Bradley doing the right thing to you? No. But are you sure that your horse will win if that Dixie Gordon rides him? I'll be my farm on it. And will Mr Madison make a large bet with that Bradley? Big enough to break him. Yes. Well, that's all I want to know. Here it is. She tells me she doesn't care for him .. But I can't believe a word she says now she's been running around with horses. You have to sign this over to me, Mr Kiffmeyer. Oh, yes. But suppose that Bradley finds out and won't take the bet? He can't find out unless you tell him. Don't tell the jockey until tomorrow. Now, sign right here. Yes, well. Alright. I've been trying to place this guy. Do you know who he is? His wife owns Dubonnet. Go along, grandpa. - He's up to something. Look at him. He's as guilty as a horse thief. Now look here, Mr Clayton, you can't .. Will you desist. First of all he calls me a caretaker and then tells me to 'desist'. Get off this place. - Now look here, grandpa. Don't you call me grandpa. - Will you leave us alone one minute. Alright. But I don't trust that guy. A house full of monkeys and no stud. I don't .. Hurry. Before we're interfered with again. Yes. I hope this .. Puts that Bradley where he belongs. - So do I. Yes, and I hope that nobody will know I've been here. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hello? Saratoga 1-5-5-8. Darling, do you think this is quite right? Quite right? Carol, have you and Duke had a quarrel? A quarrel? With that bookmaker? I don't know. You get so violent about the man I can't help thinking that .. Hello? Let me speak with Mr Bradley. Mr Duke Bradley. Please. Has there been anything between you two? You're out of your mind. Hello? Hello, Duke? I'd like to place a bet on Moonray in tomorrow's Hopeful. Did you say Moonray? Well, how about me coming out to talk it over with you? I've nothing to do. Sure, I'll be right over. Goodbye. Well, cross your fingers. Brother Madison? - Yeah. I thought I'd lost him. But he's gone sentimental. - He's going to back his own nag? You know how a sucker goes when he falls in love with his own horse. Fritzi, if luck is with me, this closes my book for good. You wouldn't quit the track? Why not? That leaves me a lone gypsy. Honey, I love you. So long. - Good luck, Duke. How are you, Dixie? - Hello, Duke. Hey listen you little mug. You'd better give that Dubonnet a ride tomorrow. Duke my boy, cracks like that annoy me. I wish I had your humility. Hello, Mr Bradley. How are you this evening? Fine, fine. What's the matter with you? Oh, nothing is the matter with me. I'm quite alright. Give me a brandy, please. Better make it a double brandy. Oh, Kiffy. Hello, darling. Well. It's good to see you alone for a change. Are you going to start that again? Yes, but you haven't been alone long. I just saw your boyfriend leaving. May I sit down? Oh look, darling, are you going to stop that silly nonsense. Well, maybe. Kiffy, darling. - Yes? Duke has given me something to think about. He has? - Yes. He may leave the track after tomorrow. Yes, that's right. He may. What do you mean by that? Well I mean, that's what you just said. Oh, yes. He's been in love with Carol Clayton for a year. But he wouldn't ask her to marry him because .. Well, he didn't feel that he could do as much for her as Madison can. But if Duke wins enough money tomorrow, he's going to tell her. He's ..? You mean he's ..? Duke? Oh. Oh, barman. Get me another .. double brandy. Kiffy, isn't that an awful lot? Well, I'm, I'm .. I am very distressed. Oh, darling. You know. Duke has made me realize how selfish I've been. Dubonnet is in the pink and I'm going to win The Hopeful tomorrow .. And have my hour of triumph, but .. Win, lose or draw, darling. I'm going to quit the track for you. Muggins, darling. I .. Yes, dear? Well, there is something you ought .. Well, what is it? Darling? Hello. Oh, I told you. You shouldn't drink all that. Oh, Muggins darling, I've .. Done something terrible. What is it? - Oh .. Get me another double. Bring me the bottle. Kiffy. Please don't be angry with me. Well Kiffy, what is it? Well .. I've given Miss Clayton. Dixie Gordon's contract. What? - Yes. Isn't that awful? He is going to ride Moonray tomorrow. Will you get me the Brookvale Farm, and hurry please. Say look, this is .. Hello? Hello, Brookvale? Has Mr Bradley arrived there? No ma'am. He ain't come yet. Yes ma'am, I'll tell him just as soon as he comes. Good evening, sir. - Good evening, Sam. Good evening, Mr Duke. Hello Rosetta. Mrs Kiffmeyer just phoned and wants you to phone her right away. I'll call her later. Will you tell Mr Madison I'm here. Yes, sir. Go right in the lobby and I'll tell him. Evening, Duke. - Evening, Hartley. Nice of you to come out. - A pleasure. Where's Carol? She is busy with our guests. She asked to be excused. Do you mind if we get down to cases? - No, of course not. Duke, what price can you give me on Moonray tomorrow? Well .. let's see. Well, twelve horses in the race .. uh .. I think I can give you 2-1, Hartley. That's good with me. - How much do you want? You're quite a cigar smoker, aren't you Duke. Yeah, why? - Oh, nothing. How much do you want on Moonray? - Fifty thousand dollars. Okay. Sure you don't want any more? What's the most you could cover, Duke? Well, let's see. I just figured .. You know, this is a beautiful spot here, Hartley. A few thousand dollars would make it the prettiest place in the world. A new barn stocked with thoroughbreds. I asked you what's the most you could cover, Duke. Would you like to make it a hundred thousand? Is that all you can pay off on? - It's all I want, pal. Okay. Mr Duke. Mrs Fritzi Kiffmeyer is on the phone again and says she's got to talk to you. Thanks, Rosetta. Will you excuse me, Hartley? Yeah. Rosetta. You've been around Mr Bradley a good deal, haven't you. Oh my yes. All I could. He certainly smokes strong cigars, doesn't he. Yes sir, Mr Madison. And he leaves them around all over the place. Yeah. All over the country. Did I make a bet? The sucker just went for a hundred G's. You heard me. A hundred thousand bucks. What? Say that again. Dixie Gordon is riding Moonray? What do you mean? I thought you had him under contract. Oh. Oh, Carol arranged the switch, huh? Well, it looks like I'll be leaving Saratoga on a boxcar. Call it off? No Fritzi, I said yes to the chump. Yeah. Okay, babe. I love you. Well Hartley, I'll be running along. - Won't you have a drink before you go? No thanks. I've got to help Fritzi dig up another jockey to ride Dubonnet tomorrow. Goodnight. Goodnight. Tell Carol I took this. I may be sitting on a street corner after The Hopeful tomorrow. How is he, Medbury? - Fine. Raised him a half this morning. He's a lot of horse today. They'll have to beat him to win. Good. Dixie. I've got a big bet on this race. There will be five thousand extra if you win. Well, you can make out your check right now. I hope you lose. You double-crossing Newport termite. I'll see you after the race, boys. Get away from that horse. What? You heard me. You'll make him nervous. I raised him from the time he was foaled. And I should make him nervous? Get the old buzzard out of here. I told you to keep away from that horse. You and who else? Why don't you go home and go to bed? Hey, I'll sprinkle flit on you. - Alright. That's enough. What's the matter, grandpa? Are you alright? What happened? I guess he fell down. Yeah. I fell down alright. Moonray. I'm going to bet ten dollars agin you. I'll see you again, young fellah. Hey Duke. Come here. Hello, grandpa. What's the matter, pulled a tendon? No, I bumped into a rat and pulled up lame. Say, did you lay off that big bet you took on Moonray? No, no. All the other books are loaded. I've been following the track for sixty years. This is the first time I ever pulled for my own horse to lose. Thanks grandpa. If I'm lucky you'll get your stud. You mean my old stud Miracle Lad? - You bet. I'll see you after the race. - Yeah, alright. Hey Duke .. Duke. I can't lay off enough to talk about it. - Okay. Forget it. Your Dubonnet looks fit. I'll string along with him. You've only one horse to be afraid of and that's Moonray with Dixie Gordon. Dixie is plenty rough and he'll win any way he can. I found that out in Kentucky. - Here we go, Hurley. Keep your horse clear until you come to the stretch. Then pop her a few times. She'll get you home. Thank you Mrs Kiffmeyer for giving me my chance to come back. Hello Duke. - Hello, Fritzi. She looks ready. - I hope so. Hello, Fritzi. Ha. Will you say hello? Why sure. Why not? Hello. Well, I want to take over your losses. Who's lost? Well, you might lose and I want to protect you. Kiffy, I love you. Yes. But she doesn't. Hey, now wait a minute. Fritzi. You give him a kiss or I will. Muggins, will ..? - No. You are the most impossible man in the world. I know I am .. - But Dubonnet had better win. Oh, heavens. I've been holding the thought. Hello, Hartley. Aren't you excited, darling? - Yes, rather. How much have we got on this? - Enough to give you heart failure. Why don't you get back in your wheelchair Hurley, where you belong. Go, get that horse out of here, Gordon. - Ah, shut up. Rocket by a length. Moonray, second by a half. Dubonnet third. Ah, I can't stand to watch this. - Then close your eyes. How is it? Gordon is whipping Moonray. He's going to pass Rocket. Where is Dubonnet? - Third. Come on, Hurley. Gordon is giving Moonray a ride alright. Where's Dubonnet? - Third. Oh, my goodness. Dubonnet is moving up. He'll not touch Moonray. Not with Dixie Gordon riding. Dubonnet is second now. - That's still not good enough. Come on, Gordon. - Gordon? I mean Hurley. Lay up, Gordon. - You can't get through, Hurley. Do you want it again? Come on. - Dubonnet. Maybe he cut that way because he was on the outside. Boy, that was close. Who do you think won it, Tip? Don't ask me. - Alright. I won't. What is it, Hartley? A dead heat? I don't know. How about it, judge. Who won? I think it's Moonray but we can't tell until we see the picture. Slow motion or still camera? Slow motion. It's more accurate. Judge, it looked like Moonray from where I sat. You were sitting down when you trained him. Will you leave before I blow you away? You know, I got a good mind to slug you. How long is it take to develop the pictures? 17 minutes. You'd have saved yourself a lot of time judge if you'd kept your eyes open. Hey. Grandpa. What happened? I think he must have fainted. - Oh. Give me a bicarbonate of soda. - Yes, Ma'am. What's the matter, Fritzi? Nervous? - Yes. I know. A stomach full of butterflies? - Oh, Duke. They feel like pigeons. When you start on that stuff it's time to quit. I'm not getting it for myself. It's for Carol. Carol? Where is she? Outside in my box. She knew you were here. She wouldn't come in. Why not? I think she's the most miserable girl in the world. Oh. Tell her to get wise to herself. I'd have done the same thing she did. Oh no you wouldn't. And she knows it. That's what hurts. We women can do things to a guy we love that a man wouldn't do to a rattlesnake. Yeah, I know. That's what makes me feel so good. What are you going to do if Moonray wins? Well, I'll be in a pretty tight spot. I won't be able to buy grandpa that stud. Or fix up Brookvale or restock it with thoroughbreds. Yeah, that's right. Oh Duke, don't feel like that. Here, you take it to her. - Oh no, not me. Oh, Duke. - Will you turn off that tremolo. Oh you fool. Oh, here you are. Hello Dukey. Hello pal. Have a snort? - Oh, no thanks. I'll see you boys in the judge's room. - Alright. Do that again. - Yes, sir. I don't know what I'm going to do if that Dubonnet doesn't win. And you won't be able to fix up the farm for that lovely lady. Brandy, sir. - Yeah, thanks. Here. You need this worse than I do. - Yes. Well, perhaps I do. Why hello, Hartley. Looking for someone? - No. You'll find her in the Kiffmeyer box. Oh, thank you. I don't know. I don't like that man. Hey, it's about time. Let's see the pictures. Yes. Well come on. What's going to happen if Dubonnet doesn't win? You can give me a job in one of your beauty parlors. Yes, I'll give you one of the beauty parlors. Hurry up, Kiffy. They're ready to start. Where shall I sit? - Right here. Come on. Thanks, darling. Well, are we ready? - All set, Mr Boswell. Close the shades. Oh Duke, I never wanted to win a race so much in my life. For all of us. Let's have the picture. Now which one is that on the rail? That's Dubonnet. Muggins, I can't stand this much longer. Can't they run a little faster? I'm dying. Well, how do you think I feel? Hurley certainly is giving Dubonnet a ride. This is the first time Gordon has been on the outside in a long time. Come on, Dubonnet. Dubonnet wins. - Oh Duke. Kiffy, darling. How about that stud you promised me? Go get him, grandpa. - Hot dog. Did I hear you say 'Dubonnet'? That was Duke's cigar you smoked in Miami, wasn't it? Yes Hartley, it was. You can leave the track now, Duke. Fritzi. I love you.  ""And when somebody shouted: They're off!"" ""To his face came a horrible look of surprise."" ""The horse with the dreamy eyes.""

Goodbye. Thanks, Sergeant. Report of horse rations, Thirtieth Hussars. Regimental and general files. Now, each of these buttons represents troops. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Good. The buttons are thickest up near the Northwest Frontier. Oh, yes, always. We have 300 million people to protect. And most of the danger is there. It's so romantic to a greenhorn like me. Kipling and all that, you know. Romantic? Well, at first, yes. A- another button to move. 41st Bengal Lancers. Here, near the pass. The pass? Does that mean- It means nothing but maneuvers. As CoI. Stone says in his report here. You hear that firing, Hamilton? Typical sniping fire, sir. Yes, and Afridi muskets every one of them. Not a shot from our detachment. Good. Hendrickson's a good soldier. Rough on him, having those Afridi swine popping away at his men and not able to return fire. Well, he'll get a citation if this plan works. Plan's good enough, sir, if it were anybody but Mohammed Khan. He's a clever dog. Yes, of course he is. I ought to know. But he's nibbling at our bait this time. And if we can once draw him down out of those hills far enough, out into the open so that we can cut off his retreat, we've got him red-handed! And that's what I've been waiting for, for 15 years, Hamilton. Afridi swine. When do we go into action, Hendrickson? On no account return fire. CoI. Stone's orders. ColoneI's orders. Narain Singh. Now can we start something? ColoneI's orders, McGregor. But the old fool couldn't have foreseen this. I'd like to have you with me in a war, but for peace time, you're a bit too- Too... Too impulsive. Machine guns! Forward! Most unfortunate, the command devolved upon you. Of course you didn't know my orders. I did know them, sir. Why didn't you obey them? You call yourself a soldier? That's all. The Colonel knows India, McGregor. You don't. You're right, I don't. I'm just a fooI Scotch-Canadian. Came into your outfit to get action. He's got a ramrod for a backbone. He's a terror for drilling, but when it comes to the real thing- McGregor, the Colonel has the right to act as he thinks best and say what he pleases. Mount! One more thing, sir. Two replacements come in today from Delhi. Paperwork. When we came into the regiment as boys, we didn't know that this was 9l10ths of soldiering. No. We thought and acted rather like McGregor. Mmm. What about these two replacements? What are they sending to us now? From the Blues: Lt. Forsythe. The Blues, eh? Well, that's a fashionable regiment. All spit and polish. Who's the other one? From Sandhurst: Lt. Stone. What? From Sandhurst? What, they're sending me a young cub, not dry behind the ears yet? Unseasoned? Straight from, fr-from military college to the Frontier? Oh, bless me. Hmm, what'd you say his name was? Donald Stone, sir. Hmm. And who asked you to interfere in my personal affairs? Will you forget that you're my coloneI for a moment, sir? Yes. Look here, Tom. In about two years, you'll be retired. So you sent for my son because you feel sorry for me, is that it? Not at all. The idea was to keep the name of Stone in the 41st after you're gone. There's no room for sentimentality in the army. Hardly fair to ship him home without a triaI. Still, he'll measure up to my standards, or out he goes. Of course. And at the first sign of favoritism, from you or anyone else, there'll be trouble. And that's an order, Maj. Hamilton. Just as you said, Major. It's the ColoneI's privilege to do and say what he likes. McGregor, you'll meet the two replacement officers this morning. Lts. Forsythe and Stone. Yes, sir. S-Stone? His son. His what? I said, his son. I can't imagine old Ramrod ever having been that human. The train arrives at 10:30, Mr. McGregor. Yes, sir. Madam, you'll marry me Tuesday the 29th. Be at the church at 10:00. That's an order. Furthermore, you're improperly dressed. Ha, Ha. Did you want to speak to me, McGregor? No, sir. I hope he's a nice follow. He won't be. Ramrod. I beg your pardon? One Stone isn't enough. We have to have two. There he is, the younger Ramrod himself. Everything was all right? Thank you, sir. Couldn't be anybody else. Just as sure of himself as... Look at the way they jump around for him. Look at his luggage, everything just so-so. Well, come on, let's get it over with. No, I've got a little business. You get your precious replacements. I'm McGregor, Lancers, sent to meet you. Oh, sort of reception committee, eh? It's nice to know I was expected. The regiment's been practically breathless for a week. Oh? Traveling light, huh? Well, you see, I did expect to stay a little while. That is if you don't mind too much. It's all right with me. Goodbye. And thank you very much for being so kind. Not at all. Your luggage and everything all taken care of? Everything, thank you. May I present Mr. McGregor, Miss Leys? Very happy. How do you do? Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Who's she? I met her on the train, if you don't mind. Bad business talking to strange people out here. You know, this is India. You don't know who they are, and you might- Oh, I see. BeautifuI spy meets the young Lancer officer, makes him give away important military secrets. The Empire goes smash. Melodrama, my dear McGregor, melodrama. It might not be as funny as it sounds, Mr. Stone. I don't suppose it matters to you, but my name isn't Stone. No? No, it's Forsythe. Well, then, that must be Stone there. That's very good, you know. That's really very good. It's almost brilliant. Stone? I'm McGregor, sent to meet you. That's very nice of you. Stone, meet Mister, uh... What did you say your name was? Forsythe. Mr. Stone, Mr. Fort. We met on the train, and the name is Forsythe. Too hot for Forsythe. Fort, Stone. Stone, Fort. Stone Fort. And that's funny. If you two will hold onto each other, I'll tend to your luggage. Pleasant chap. So friendly. Isn't he? Just what I've always imagined a real officer on the Frontier would be like. Well, my mother kept me in the States untiI I made her send me to Sandhurst. I've knocked about a bit in the States. Scotch-Canadian, myself. What is this I'm in? The Foreign Legion? I didn't even think my father knew I was at Sandhurst, untiI this happened. What? His sending for me to his regiment. Oh? Sort of, carry on our tradition, you know? Naim Shah, your servant, Stone. Ali Hamdi, yours. The night watchman, the water carrier, the sweeper. You can hire the rest of them later. Those things hurt my ears. That's odd. They sound to me like a Scotch bagpipe. Your quarters, Stone. Pretty, huh? And soothing. Thought I might entertain you. Wild Scotch airs. Remind you of home. Your room. Someone deeded all this junk to the South Kensington Museum? That junk represents the personal belongings of the man you're replacing. Killed on the border last month. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, McGregor, did my... Uh, the Colonel say anything about what time he'd see me? No, he didn't. And my guess is he won't see you till durbar. Oh. Don't let that get you down. The old- The old man's a stickler for red tape. Durbar. Bugles. And that's an order. Ramrod. Durbar. Oh, a-already? I'll be right with you. I want you to help me to keep them in good condition. You keep then shined and I'II, uh, keep them dirty. Durbar. Whenever you're ready, sahib. Thanks, old ColoniaI. Durbar, Barrett. Not today, old boy. Where to now? Over the border. I wish I'd taken my mother's advice and joined the church instead of the Army. I wish I had the job. Does the Colonel think you're the only one here who talks Pushtu? Who knows what the Colonel thinks? I agree with you there. Well, good luck. Thanks, Mac. Left wheel, turn! Left wheel, turn! Good head, eh? Yeah. How old is she, Major? Places, men. Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, sir. What's this? An Afridi Ghazi, Colonel sahib. Caught in the quarters of Capt. Norton, with this. Anything stolen? He meant to kill Capt. Norton. Said Capt. Norton slept with his feet toward Mecca. There are trees, and we have rope. What have you got to say? Oh. Take him and hang him to a tree, and then sew the dead body in the skin of a pig. Well, that's what will happen to him if he tries it again. You tell him that and let him go. He doesn't seem to like pigs. If that happened, in heaven he wouldn't get the 48 maidens allotted by Allah. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Sad. Capt. Norton. Yes, sir? Have you a compass? Yes, sir. Change the direction of your bed. Yes, sir. Yes, that's all. Mr. McGregor. The two replacements? Mr. Forsythe, from the Blues, Mr. Stone, from Sandhurst. From the Blues, eh? Quite so. Well, that's a fashionable regiment. I am afraid, Mr. Forsythe, you'll find us different. We have a reputation as soldiers, and we're proud of it. Mr. Stone. You've come to us direct from Sandhurst, without previous service. Is that correct? Yes, sir. Yes. Well, you've got a great deal to learn. And I trust that you, and you, too, Mr. Forsythe, will measure up to our requirements. That's all, gentlemen. Crusty old... I'm sorry. Is it over? Is that all? That's all. Lt. Stone. Yes, sir? The Colonel forgot something. I want you to take this to him. Yes, sir. What's so funny? You are. So the rough soldier has a heart of gold. Never mind, it comes out in all of us. It's the mother instinct. Is this it, sir? What? Where did you get this? Mr. McGregor ordered me to give it to you, sir. What infernal impudence! No, uh, not you. Not-not-not you. How's, uh, How- H-How's your mother? Quite well, sir. Good, good. She always hated the army. I- I don't understand why she ever let you go through Sandhurst. She had to. I've kept after her about it ever since I was so high. Oh? Wanted to be a soldier, eh? We've always been soldiers, for generations. Yes. Still, you're not one yet, you know? Yes, sir. Really, you, uh, you ought not to be here. Uh, not on the Frontier. But I am here, sir. Yes, but, uh, don't try to take advantage. Don't expect any favoritism. I don't, sir. I, uh, I- I-I'm glad to see you, of course, and I... I'm sorry that the situation makes any sort of, uh, o-of, uh, social relation impossible. And I-I, uh... No, no, wait! W-wait. Uh, come back a moment. You see, uh, this Frontier, it's not the same as home service. No place for a Cub. A man's got to be seasoned. You've got to start from the bottom. Learn everything, and if you don't measure up, out. The service comes first. Something your mother never understood. Yes, sir. Is that all, sir? What? Uh, uh, yes. Y- Yes, that's all. That's all. I'm very glad to see... Poor kid. I thought if I got them alone... But the old man has ice-water in his veins. You don't know the colonel, McGregor. Neither do you. Mr. McGregor. Yes, sir. As I remarked to one of my other officers this morning, there is no place for sentimentality in the Army. Neither sentimentality nor impertinence, Mr. McGregor. Stone. Interesting, the durbar, isn't it? I'm sorry I sent you in there. I should have known better. Should have known how he'd treat you. What's a son to him, compared to his blasted regiment? Martinet. Ramrod. That's what he is. Everybody knows it. You might as well get used to it. That's a lie. I'm sorry, I can't keep my mouth shut. That's my trouble. Biggest fooI in the Army. I'm sorry. That's all- all right, Mac. "" Sure I love the dear silver that shines in her hair "" "" And the brow that's all furrowed "" "" and wrinkled with care "" "" Oh, God bless you and keep you "" "" Mother McGregor "" Now, when a troop wheels on the move, what do the troop leaders look out for? Mr. Stone, I asked you a question. Yes, sir. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Got it all that time. All right. Bedding should be changed, Mr. Stone. Yes, I see now, Risaldar Major. We don't have these beastly ticks in England. Sergeant, have this horse's shoe attended to. Come on! Give him a good walk while he cools off. A good man, Forsythe. Jump! See the way he took that jump? Yes, they teach them to jump in the Blues. Yes. Yes, what? Oh. Good work, Forsythe. Thank you, sir. Mr. McGregor, you're improperly dressed. I'm sorry, sir. That was a nice jump you made, Mac. Thanks. Hello, Stone. Hello. Remarkable man, your father. Knows a good soldier when he sees one. Appreciates neatness, too. Well, how about a spot of scotch? Thanks. I haven't finished inspection yet. Ten minutes for their backs and five for their bellies. That's the order of grooming. Very touching, the lad's devotion. Must warm the maternaI cockles of your heart. Eh, McGregor? What about pulling a few pegs with me, huh? I'm in favor of it. Let's go. Well, uh, how about 10 Rupees? Make it 20. Ready? Whenever you say. They should make those pegs smaller. Be more sport to it, huh? "" Oh, he flew through the air "" "" With the greatest of ease "" "" And the daring young man owes me 20 Rupees "" Have some tea, Stone? No, thanks. Call it for first in the bath. Heads. Right. You fellows bathe to keep cooI and I bathe because I badly need it. Every time I do this I remind myself of my old man. Whiskers. He was a crabby old cuss. Back in Alberta I had a colt once. Lot of class and nerve. You could tell he was no carthorse when he was a yearling. The old man hooked him to a plow. Took all the spirit out of him. He broke him in, as he said he would and I never forgave him for it. I don't think the horse ever did realize what... what the old man did to him. So I'm the horse. Very subtle, Mac. What the blazes do you mean? I'm no two-year-old. I'm 21. And if anybody thinks my old man's going to break my nerve- What are you talking about? I wasn't thinking of you at all. And let me tell you another thing, I don't need a nurse. Now you can go on shaving. Have a little soap. You need it. Do you have to do that? Why, like you, I have a softer side to my nature. It finds its outlet in music. See? The scales. Hey, Mac, get me a towel, will you? Variations, one hand, Mac. Listen, Forsythe. This Mother Machree business has gone far enough. Why, of course, Mac. I'm sorry. I didn't realize it. Well, let's, uh, just forget all about it. Hm? Thanks. Hey, Mac, that soap's in my eyes. Give me a towel, will you? McGregor. Variations, two hands, Mac. How long are you going to... Keep playing. Variations, Mr. Forsythe, with both hands. Cobras have a softer side, too. Finds an outlet in music. Of course, if you-if you stop playing, You know, you might live a couple of hours. I had a friend once that lived for two days. Try it with one hand. Mac! Allow me. You might spill it. For sale, cheap. One secondhand musical instrument. 200 feet more. Plus 200 east. Elevation, 300. Mr. McGregor. Yes, sir? There's no word yet from Barrett. We must get in touch with him. Yes, sir. You're familiar with the roads north east of Fort Jamrud? I am, sir. Yes, good, good. You'll cross the Frontier tonight. Take one subaltern, one NCO, 10 men, four spare horses. And, uh, rifles. Not lances. I see, sir. Ostensibly, a hunting expedition. What subaltern shall I take, sir? Mmm, any preference? Mr. Stone, sir. No service experience. Take Morgan. He's on leave, sir. Well, then, take Forsythe. Yes, sir. Here are your orders. And this time, obey them. Yes, sir. Forsythe. Huh? We're leaving for the border immediately. What? Action? Can't say. Oh. We leave for the border? Uh, small expedition. Only one junior officer. Forsythe. Yes? One junior officer, so he had to choose- I chose Forsythe. I see. Sir. What do you mean by intruding like this? Why wasn't I chosen to go with McGregor? Are you questioning my orders? Then it was your orders. It wasn't McGregor's choice. It was yours. Mr. Stone. I came out to India to be an officer, and I've been given things to do I learned in my first year at Sandhurst. I haven't asked any favors, and I'm not asking any now. But if you meant to treat me this way, why did you bring me out here? Why did you send for me? I didn't send for you. Y- you didn't? Oh. Are you aware we're being shot at? We camp here. This is no place to camp. Are you out of your mind? They'll rush us in the night and slit our throats. This can't be what the Colonel meant. Easy to see how much you learned in the Blues about Frontier fighting. No firing. He's mine. Rapid fire! You just missed my ear, Mac. You're lucky, Barrett. You got a cigarette? Yeah. Thanks. What shall I tell the ColoneI? Mohammed Khan, is effecting a coalition of all the tribes. But don't forget, Colonel, GopaI's a friendly state. The Emir's our friend, as who knows better than you. Oh, of course, I've known Othman Ali for 20 years. Every year or so I take the regiment up to Gopal for maneuvers and pig-sticking. He's got the best wild pig north of the Ganges. Ah. But two million rounds of ammunition. Oh, no, Woodley. Why, that's enough to start a small-sized war. And then, who knows? Yes, who knows? But he asked for it. And if we refused, well, he mightn't be our friend. And so he gets it, eh? Yes. McGregor, Sahib. Oh, ask Mr. McGregor to come in. Oh, sit down, sir, won't you? You saw Barrett? Yes, sir. He reports Mohammed Khan is trying to stir up all the border tribes, and effect a coalition of all of them. They're listening to him as he's promised to supply them with machine guns, and two million rounds of ammunition. Ammunition? Oh, that's good work. Thank you, McGregor. Thank Barrett, sir. Look at here, sir, I-I know it's none of my business, but couldn't we slip out of here, a small detachment of us, anyway, on our own? Try to get a chance at him, kill him, and-and nip the whole business in the bud? Are you suggesting that I should commence hostilities without orders? And, uh, ahem, without reporting this to the Intelligence? Intelligence, those fools. General staff? You know, sir, they'll send us anywhere but into action. To Gopal to stick pigs for instance, like last summer. An excellent suggestion. Sir Thomas, Mr. McGregor. Mr. McGregor, Maj. Gen. Sir Thomas Woodley. Chief of Intelligence. Army Headquarters. Mr. McGregor. CoI. Stone, your regiment will leave at dawn for GopaI. Yes, sir. Now, get yourself a couple of hours sleep. We leave at 6:00. Yes, sir. Wish I could go with you. I always liked pig-sticking. Pig-sticking. Well, I seem to remember feeling that way once. He's probably right. Hm. But he brought our answer, Stone. A plain two and two that makes a very plain four. Mohammed Khan needs two million rounds of ammunition. And the Emir of Gopal asks us for two million rounds- Yes, yes, and it's not difficult to guess, that Mohammed Khan persuaded the Emir to ask for it. He knows we'll have to let him have it, too. And GopaI's not only remote, but far enough removed from the Khan's home fires, that we shouldn't be suspicious. Very pretty, indeed. And it becomes our very pleasant job, to see that the Emir really is the one who gets the ammunition. That old pussy-footer gets paid for being intelligent. I tell you, Forsythe, everything's going to smash. What? Pig-sticking. We're going to ride all around Gopal sticking toothpicks into pigs. Sounds rather fun. I ought to be rather good at that, don't you think? Hmm. By the way, McGregor, I've got bad news for you. Your ward needs parental controI, I fear. That is, if you can find him. Naim Shah tells me he's been out every night since we left. Rolling home to quarters blotto. Tonight he's still out on a binge. Hm. We leave for Gopal in two hours. Oh, without Stone, it appears. My, what will the stern father say? You'd better do something about it, Mac. The young fooI. Let old Ramrod do what he likes with his son. It's no concern of mine. I'm going to bed. So am I. What are you doing here? The same as you are. Looking for him. And I wish you'd be honest with yourself, and let me know what you're really going to do. If you'd just tell me, maybe I'd get more sleep. Now that we are here, what would you do if you were drunk? How drunk? Pretty drunk. I'd go looking for that music. Come on, speed it up, Stone, or we'll all be doing stable duty. I can take care of myself. Come along, Casanova, these will make a new man of you. Forgot something. I thought you might get lonesome. Get yourself a cobra. The welcoming committee from the Emir. That's his vizier, bringing gifts for the ColoneI from his old paI. His Highness, Othman Ali Bahadur, Emir of Gopal, bids welcome to his friends and allies of the Raj. Welcome, huzoor, thrice welcome, in the name of Allah. Convey my thanks to your master, ahem, my old friend. Uh, m-may he live a thousand years. His Highness orders me to express his wish, huzoor, that you may live long enough to be present at his funeraI. Uh, oh, yes, quite so. Quite so. He went the old man one better that time. Wicked looking birds, aren't they? Hunting falcons, Forsythe. Swiftest thing in the air. Full of fight and trained to kill, like the rest of these mangy-looking fellows. A long-legged man is always full of wind. Barrett. His Highness invites you, huzoor, and all the officer sahibs, to an entertainment in your honor, tonight at the palace. I accept on their behalf with pleasure. All my thanks to His Highness. His Highness awaits you. Salaam, Colonel Sahib. Salaam, Your Highness. May I present the officers of the 41st Bengal Lancers, Your Highness? My poor hovel is yours, sahiban. Everything here is for your pleasure. Please enjoy yourselves. Now, this is what army life should be. Like the Arabian Nights, isn't it? Anything like this in Canada, Mac? Quite a teepee, huh? I sent to London for that, and you- My two good friends. My guest, CoI. Stone. My guest, Mohammed Khan. Very glad to know you Khan sahib. At last, CoI. Stone. We almost met once before, did we not, you and I? Yes, I-I believe we did. Just missed you, didn't I? A blind man wants nothing except his eyes. That's an Afghan proverb. And now, if you will forgive me, I must leave my two good friends together. I must go to see my other guests. Oh, yes, Your Highness. No doubt that Khan and I will find much to talk about. Highness. You were not expected with your lancers. A hasty trip, wasn't it? In search of, uh... Pigs. There's another proverb: The little jackal barks, but the caravan passes. Won't you sit down, CoI. Stone? Yes. I say, look. I saw her first. No, no, no, no, no, no, Mac. A direct frontal attack? That's the wrong tactics. This requires finesse. I'll toss you. The loser stays clear. Right you are. Heads. Now watch closely. Well, uh, go ahead. Uh, I'm watching you closely. Gentlemen. Uh, two more of my officers I should like you to meet. Mr. McGregor, Mr. Forsythe. This is our friend and neighbor, Mohammed Khan. A great pleasure, gentlemen. Let me give you some advice, Mr. Forsythe. Never make fun of military Intelligence. Thank you very much. And now- Uh, wait a minute. That girI and... I've got some things to find out. He plans to leave tomorrow morning. I knew he would as soon as we got here. We must keep him here if possible. I was right. She came here with Mohammed Khan. Aha, so that's how it is. Diplomatic complications rear their heads, huh? Looks like it. We'd better find them. Mac, I've been thinking. I'm very fond of you, you know. I have a feeling this is going to cost me something. Oh, no, Mac. Now, you've done enough for him, really. This time, I'll take on the rescue work. Well, that touches me deeply, but how many times have you told me he was my job? Uh, we'll both do it, Mac. Huh? Mr. Stone, I'm sorry, but uh, but Maj. Hamilton wants to see you. Very important, he said. I beg your pardon. I'll be back in just a moment. Surely. No manners at all, this younger generation. Completely forgot the introductions, didn't he? My name's Forsythe. How do you do? That's McGregor. Scotch, you know. Very queer race. Did you send for me, Major? No. I'm sorry. I made that same mistake once before. How are your pigs this year, Highness? Pigs? My land is overrun with unclean beasts. Oh, that means good sport tomorrow. You'll join us, Khan sahib, of course? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm leaving in the morning. But if you wish real sport, you must come to my country. An invitation? My land and all it contains is at your disposaI. Yes, yes, sahib. Why, he gives his word, the word of a prince. I swear it upon the Koran. An oath? Oh, I'll put it to the test. He has you. What do you demand of him, sahib? Postpone your departure. Join us at pig-sticking tomorrow. I- I-I can't. My affairs demand that- You must. You give your oath upon the Koran. I am honored, Bahadur. Tomorrow, Pig-sticking. I don't believe in explaining orders, but this time it's necessary. Mohammed Khan's men are in these hills, to seize that ammunition convoy before it reaches our friend, the Emir. There's no need to tell you how serious one ill-advised or careless move by any of you might be in this situation. Oh, of course, we're here for sport and maneuvers. And as some of you who are new to India may not know, a wounded pig is a dangerous animal, so a word of advice to, uh, the younger officers. If you wound a pig and he takes to cover, do not dismount and follow. Foolhardiness is not courage. It's not good soldiering and it's not good sport. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Good morning. We shall ride together, sir? It will be a pleasure. You have the advantage of me, in years. The older the English fox, the safer his brush. Cunning comes with age, CoI. Stone. Hunted in the shires, I see. And you on the border. We're fairly matched. But I prefer your English sport to this. You prefer hunting the fox? Mr. Stone. I'm worried about you. Such a dangerous sport. Nonsense. Why, there's no risk at all. Good luck. Old Ramrod's spotted one. Look at him ride. He made a direct kill. Look! 20 Rupees on the first spear. Right. "" Oh, he flew through the air with the greatest of ease "" Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Did you see old Ramrod make that kill? ""A wounded pig is a dangerous animaI."" What rot. Pig hasn't a chance. Think so? Hey, look. There's your chance to find out how simple it is. Stone! Mr. McGregor! Mr. McGregor! You get back on your horse and stay there. Mr. Stone! Mr. Stone! McGregor, give me your tunic. No one, you understand, no one, must know of this. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Mr. Stone, you've seen fit to disregard my advice. You will please be good enough to leave the field. Yes, sir. I, uh, I-I should thank you two. Well, thank you, gentlemen. Now, uh, help me on my horse. And you, too, disobeyed my orders. I distinctly told you not to dismount. Lights out. How do you feel, sir? I, oh, oh, quite all right, thanks. They'll be over at once. What? Much better talk to them yourself, I think, sir. He's your son, you know. Better effect than if it came from me. And when you talk, I happen to know there's quite a strong friendship between the boy and McGregor. Yeah. Yes, yes, of course. Of course, yes. Well, all right. They're here. Well, all right. Come in. Oh, yes, yes, of course, it's you. Yes, I-I... G- Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening, sir. Good evening, sir. Yes, I, uh, I- I-I sent for you. I- I want to talk to you about something. Uh... Uh, sit down. S- sit down, both of you. No, no, no, don't go, Hamilton. It, um, it's about, uh, um... Are your quarters comfortable? Yes, sir. Just like Salisbury Plain, sir. Yes, yes. There are three of you together, I understand. I- I-I mean, my s- Uh, Mr. Stone is quartered with you, isn't he? Yes, sir. Yes. Well, I, uh, I- I-I want to talk to you about something. Uh, Uh, oh, Uh, oh, t-try some of my tobacco, McGregor. I- I-It's my own mixture. You know- you know, that fellow in Jermyn Street. Lot of perique in it. Hm. Too strong for me, maybe. No. No, not for you, McGregor. I- I-it might be for Forsythe. Of the Blues. Late of the Blues, sir. Huh? Oh, yes, yes, late of the Blues. Uh, I-I-I knew your father, Forsythe. Oh, did you really? Yes. Snake charmer, wasn't he? What? Brigadier General, a- a snake charmer? Well, I thought... Well, you see, his son plays one of those... Oh, that's odd. I- I-I never heard of it. Uh... Oh, oh, probably, it's just as well. Probably. Yes, probably, sir. Yes. Yes, I-I-I knew him. Uh... Y- your father must be very proud of you, Forsythe. T- t-the army a-a-and all that sort of thing, I mean. Oh, he took all that for granted, sir. Yes. Yes. Uh... Uh-uh, you-you ought to make a good officer, Forsythe. Oh, you've got a lot to learn yet, of course. Oh, yes, sir. Yes. W- w-where is your father now? Cheltenham. Retired. Retired? Yeah. Well, we-we come to it. We all come to it. Not much to look forward to then. Not much, unless, uh... Well, uh, we've had a hard day. Now, you-you'd better get yourself some sleep. Good night, gentlemen. Good night, sir. Good night, sir. Good night, sir. Yeah, good night, Hamilton. That fellow in Jermyn Street. Pour lumps of sugar. Not much to look forward to. So he wanted to talk to us. Well, whatever it was, he couldn't get it off his chest, could he? Say, do you suppose... Ah, is the light beginning to break? I got it. The old man doesn't know what to do about his kid, and wants us to help him, but just couldn't get it out. That's brilliant, Mac. That's positively brilliant. That's it, all right. I never thought he cared that much. I never thought he was that human. Yet the way he went after that pig when he thought his boy was in for it. Yeah, game old cock. Those tusks got him a lot worse than he lets on, too. Boy's pretty bitter and ugly. Largely the old man's fault, of course. Partly the old man's, partly our system's. But mostly the boy's. Let's wake him up. Well, no, Mac. I leave that to you. He's your ward. Well, the old man talked to you, too, didn't he? That girI. Ah, youth, youth! I trust you won't find the journey too uncomfortable, Mr. Stone. Halt! Who goes there? Guard, turn out. Barrett sahib. As he turned around, we fired and brought him down, sir. Thank you, McGregor. Your version, Forsythe? Mr. Stone was not in his tent. That's all we can say, sir. You've both tried to shield him. All the facts are obvious. He couldn't have been seized in the middle of the camp without some outcry. Just slipped out against orders. Anyway, he can tell where they've taken him, sir. Hamzulla, ask him where Mohammed Khan has taken my son. I think I can make him talk, sir. Well, try. Guards doubled as ordered, sir. Thank you, Norton. Barrett? Bad? The eyes, and the usuaI... Mogala. Thank you, McGregor. I learned that one from you, sir. Hamzulla Khan, take him away and see that he is well guarded. Trial of that Afridi, Services for Barrett, at noon. That's all, gentlemen. But, sir. I thought that- You thought what, Mr. McGregor? That you were going after your son, sir. This incident will not change our plans in any respect. But-But knowing where he's taking your son makes all the difference, sir. We can be at Mogala almost as soon as he is. This regiment can ride, sir. I'm aware my regiment can ride. I'm also aware that I am not going to do precisely what Mohammed Khan has planned that I should do. He took my son to goad me into pursuing him to draw the lancers from their position. He's mistaken his man. But this- In our present position, the regiment holds Mohammed Khan checkmate. The regiment stays here. Then let me go. I can take a small detachment- Mr. McGregor, I cannot weaken the strength of the regiment in this emergency. And I can't permit you or any other officer to risk their lives for Mr. Stone. But he's your son, and we can save him, can't we? That will be all, Mr. McGregor. Then take a look at that. That's what Mohammed Khan does to his prisoners. That's quite unnecessary, Mr. McGregor. I know what may happen to my son through his own disobedience and folly. I'd just begun to think I was wrong about you, but I wasn't. You haven't a human bone in your body. There's not a drop of blood in your veins. You're nothing but a- McGregor. So you'll sit here with your regiment while they kill your son by inches. Well, I won't! I'm going after him whether you like it or not. Mr. McGregor! Pending charges of insubordination you will please consider yourself under arrest. Mr. Forsythe, you will be responsible for the prisoner. You fooI. Can't you see- So you- Mac! Come along. Well, I must say you spoke your mind, old colonial, if there's any virtue in that. ""Regiment, duty, you're improperly dressed. "" That's all he cares about. So they'll say, ""Very good, CoI. Stone,"" and pin another medal on him. Or else he's... Haven't you said enough, McGregor? The coloneI's right and you know it. You're only making it harder for him. If you take my advice, you'll go over and apologize. Not me. Apologize after what he did? Oh, for heaven's sake, man, get some sense. Do you suppose it was an easy thing for him to do? His own son? Why wasn't it? He doesn't care about him. He'd do the same thing to any of us. But to sit here and let them pull his own son to pieces because of a few cases of ammunition- Are you blind, man? You think he doesn't care? Well, I know he does. Well, I suppose if it were your son, you'd sit here, too, like a dummy. You would not- No, I should probably have ordered the regiment out. That's because I'm not the man the colonel is. Nor the soldier. Well, if that's what you call being a man or a soldier, I don't want any part of it. Not me. That kid needs him. It's his own blood, and if he cared a hang about him- Of course he cares. But what's that got to do with it? He loved his wife, too, but he lost her. She was American. Couldn't stick the service, couldn't understand. So he chose the regiment then just as he's doing now. But that doesn't mean he didn't care. I know. I ought to know. We were Cubs together. He put his whole souI into the regiment, and that's all he's had. And he won't have that long, either. Retirement. He'll have an armchair in the club, and a window over the rag, and that's all. And he'll have nothing if his boy doesn't carry on in this regiment. Then he'd have everything? Of course he would. That's what it means to him. But you think he'd let that make any difference to his orders, to his job? Well, why shouldn't it? Why can't he be a little less of a soldier and more of a man? Why can't he forget his blasted duty for once? Man, you are blind! Have you never thought how for generation after generation here, a handfuI of men have ordered the lives of 300 million people? It's because he's here, and a few more like him. Men of his breed have made British India. Men who put their jobs above everything. He wouldn't let death move him from it and he won't let love move him from it. When his breed of man dies out, that's the end. And it's a better breed of man than any of us will ever make. Good night, gentlemen. There's a great deaI of speaking of minds going on here tonight. I didn't think the old boy had it in him, but he's right. According to his way of thinking, maybe. It's funny, your being out here and thinking of it in any other way. On their side, huh? Well, I'm not. So I'm going to do something. There's been enough thinking and talking, too. I'm going. Are you really, now? You know, you put me in a rather awkward position. Look, I don't want any trouble with you, but I'm going. Well, when do we start? What do you mean ""we""? You're my prisoner, you know. I couldn't let you out of my sight. I regret to have to report, sir. McGregor and Forsythe have disappeared. What, desertion? I suppose it is, technically. Well, what did you expect? "" Sure I love the dear silver "" "" That shines in her hair "" "" And the brow that's all furrowed "" "" and wrinkled with care "" "" I kiss the dear fingers so toiI-worn for me "" "" Oh, God bless you and keep you "" "" Mother "" "" Mcgregor "" Why do they want to talk so many languages in India? It's up to you. You'll have to be the talking merchant. I'll be the deaf and dumb one. Well, at least we're in. I hope getting out is as easy. Trying to be funny? No, I'm not trying to be funny. I'm scared stiff. What are we going to do now? Try to look and act like the rest of these merchants. Set up shops. Sell a few doodads while we take a look around. I don't see anything that looks like a plan. As far as I can see, we've just stuck our head in the lion's mouth. A very large and unpleasant lion, too. Suppose you were Mohammed Khan, where would you have put him? Oh, no, you play first. It'll be more fun. All right. You stay here and unpack these things and set up shop. I'll take a look around. Don't forget you're deaf and dumb. You'd better cut your prices, Mac, before I get my throat cut. Do you think she recognized us? I hope not. I don't think so. Anyway, we won't worry about it. Did you see anything interesting? Not a thing. What's that mean? Time to go? Yes. But we're gonna stay right here untiI we can- He's in all right. No doubt about that. And doing rather well, too. Clicquot. I saw the labeI. Iced. If that's the way Mohammed Khan tortures his victims I'd like to change places with him for 10 minutes. That guard's got a key all right. If we can last till night, hit the guard over the head get the kid out, try and steal some horses- Jump them over a 40-foot wall and then that mad dash for the border. Well, you think of something better. Mohammed Khan sent for us. He wants to see our rugs and laces. Do you suppose? No, I don't suppose. Don't forget you're deaf and dumb. Oh, come, come, gentlemen. It isn't everyday that two British officers prostrate themselves at the feet of a poor border chieftain. Mr. McGregor, Mr. Forsythe. I told you, this Mardi Gras would be a washout. I had hoped the ColoneI might come himself but since he has so very cleverly refused, I welcome you to my humble home. You remember, my dear, of course? How could I forget? They were such charming dinner companions. Dinner. Yes, of course. You will dine with me surely, gentlemen, to try my poor savage fare? I know you must be anxious to meet my guest of honor. I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. McGregor. Yes, I've-I've seen good cricket in my time. I was an Oxford man, you know. But I must compliment you, Mr. Forsythe, on your delivery. Superb. Oh, charming compliment. My only regret is that it wasn't a hand grenade. A charming thought. A charming dinner. The mutton was, uh, excellent. Always mutton. We have mutton or chicken up here. But, as you say, good mutton, quite the equaI of your English South Down. Now you put me in a very difficult position. Pride of country urges me to argue the point. But my position as, uh... as a guest, shall we say- By all means a guest, for the time being. For the time being, huh? Pass the wine. My position as a guest for the time being, of course, inclines me to agree with you. Well, a compliment indeed, that we can approach the excellence of anything British. I'm fed up with this cat-and-mouse business. Let's talk sense. You've got us here and now what are you going to do with us? Mac, manners, manners. By the way, we didn't thank the Khan sahib for our charming and picturesque raiment. Suppose we stay with the subject? I'm quite prepared to supply you with horses to return to your regiment. You can tell your coloneI that some of my men misunderstood his son's innocent flirtation. Of course, when I found it out, I punished them at once. An easy explanation of how I came to set you free. And, uh, what's the catch? You have only to answer two very simple questions: By what route is the ammunition train coming and just where does the regiment plan to meet it for convoy? Well, when the furry little animaI jumped out of the bag he really jumped, didn't he? Well, gentlemen. We have ways to make men talk. If you'll forgive me, I- I have a headache. Oh, I'm sorry, my dear. Madame Volkanskaya finds our methods in this part of the world a little too direct for her taste. Your brandy, gentlemen. Take it. We may need it. I regret this, but thanks to your coloneI's cold heart and cold brain I have no other choice, and very little time. Now that we're no longer guests, tell him what you really think of the mutton. Oh, yes. As much as I regret to say this, your mutton is undoubtedly- ""Rotten"" is the word. Thanks, Mac. Come, now, gentlemen, must I proceed to these absurd and unpleasant extremes? Little bamboo slivers but when they're driven under the fingernails and lighted, we find them very effective. Bring the other two gentlemen a little bit closer so they can see well. I shall proceed first with Mr. McGregor. I'll get you some water. I'd rather have a cigarette, Mac. Dentist once in MontreaI hit a nerve. It hurt almost as bad. Well, he's been to a dentist. Let me alone! Come on, Tania. Don't faiI me, Tania. Come along, Mohammed Khan. Show some speed! Tania! For dear old Forsythe. Tania! Tania! Run, jump, do something! Do anything. That's right. Here we go. Tania! One jump. Come on, Mohammed Khan, take that hurdle. Ah, Mohammed Khan, by half a length. That makes 40 million Rupees you owe me. Another day of this, and I'm broke. Another day of this, we'll be going around in circles like those cockroaches. Ah, I wonder when these whiskers stop itching and begin to be a beard! Foulest torture ever invented. Keep us in a cell that crawls and fix us so we can't scratch. All the Khan's horses and all the Khan's men. It didn't take him long. I'd like to have seen the look on the ColoneI's face. It looks as if they were expecting trouble. There's only one answer. The ColoneI's after them. And with all the ammunition here, there's nothing to keep him in GopaI. With those machine guns and two million rounds of ammunition the regiment wouldn't have a chance. The old Ramrod's a fooI to try it. He will, though. There's nothing much we can do about it. I wish I had my toodle-oodle here. I'd play you some wild Scotch airs. Over my dead body, you would. You know, that's rather clever, Mac. Why don't you say it? Why don't you say what you're thinking? Forget it! I'm to blame. I told them, that's what you're thinking. Why don't you say it? Shut up! All right, I told them and why shouldn't I? For him? To stand there and watch and know all the time I was gonna be next to have your nails torn off and those pincers and burning sticks driven into you untiI... And things you can't even talk about. Why should I stand all that? For what? For him? For a service that makes him like he's been to me? He left me here, didn't he? He knew what they'd do. He wouldn't come after me, not him. Regiment, service, duty! Why should I stand what you did for them? Why should I? Why should any of us? Why? I told you to forget it. All right, Mac. But I still don't understand why. Why? Well... Well, there are some things they don't teach you in military college. Can't, I guess. India's big, you know. There are 300 million people and run by, uh, just a handfuI of men. The-The-The job comes first. Like old Ramrod, you can't let death move you, nor love. And it's like... How can I tell you what it's all about when I don't know myself? ""'The time has come,'the Walrus said, ""'To speak of many things ""'Of ships and shoes and sealing-wax, Of cabbages and kings. ""' Oh, shut up! You don't like poetry? How should I know? I never read any. Perhaps something more rugged. ""Ever the faith endures, ""England, my England ""Take and break us, we are yours ""England, my own ""Life is good, joy runs high ""Between English earth and sky ""Death is death and we shall die ""to the Song on your bugles blown, England To the stars on your bugles blown!"" If I had known I was going to say all this, I would have brought my violin. You weren't by any chance thinking how nice it would be if someone spilled the fire into that ammunition, were you? About 200 yards, I'd say. Nearer a 100. My last year in Oxford I won the 220. I ran the 100 in 10 flat at McGill. It's nearer 200. And where's McGill? Mcgill's in MontreaI. And this is a job for a 100-yard man. Forget I'm your superior officer? Forget you're my prisoner? Toss you? The cockroaches. If Tania gets to the wall first, I win. It's a go? Mohammed Khan! Come on! Tania, what's the matter? Mohammed Khan again! It's my job. Your luck's as good as ever, Mac. And now all I have to do is figure a way to get out of here. That's all. Too late, sir. Hopeless to attack that strength. If we retire now and that ammunition is distributed amongst the tribes... You know what that means. Yes, a costly job, sir. I know. But it's worth the whole regiment. Squadron, wheel into line. Gallop! What are you doing? I'm trying to wear a hole in the wall so we can all climb through. It occurred to me, gentlemen that you might like to know what is to become of you. I'm expecting a visit from your colonel in a few minutes. I can assure you he will receive a very warm reception. In the coming engagement, if the Colonel escapes I shall send you all back to him alive. If he is captured, you will all die. In any case, I shall have the pleasure of bringing the ColoneI face to face with a son who betrayed his Empire. Very foolish, Mr. Forsythe. You should always temper courage with judgment. That's a fooI thing to do. We'll get it soon enough. Did you get a gun, too? Just about enough powder in those, I think, to blow that lock off. It took us five days to think of that. Us? Take a little water and mix enough straw and mud to seal this lock. What do we use for a fuse? Mac. Yeah. This idea, I'm in on it. It was my fault, all this, and if there's any way... I mean- Sure, I know. Ready with that wick? I mean, there's not much left that... Well, I couldn't go back, like he said, not to the regiment or to England. If anybody's going to take any chances, I'll take them. Sure you're in on it. Never thought of it any other way. Just stick close and do what you're told till we get this open. There's someone on that tower with a machine gun. Let me get it and cover you while you make a run for it. All right. Look, I've got a hunch we're going to get out of this. We can't let the old man or anybody know what's happened. Mohammed Khan! Mohammed Khan! This way. All right, Mac, you keep me covered. I can make it from here. Bugles. Trumpets. Man needs seasoning. Poetry! Mac! Mac, I... I... He did it for me. To undo what I did! The last thing Mac asked you... the old man mustn't know. It's just as good a way of paying what you owe. Mother McGregor. Lt. John Forsythe by command of His Majesty the King-Emperor, I confer upon you the distinguished service order. Second Lt. Donald Stone, 41st Bengal Lancers. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He attacked single-handed, a group of the enemy and killed their leader thus demoralizing hostile forces at a moment when the success of our arms at Mogala was in the balance. Second Lt. Donald Stone by Command of His Majesty the King-Emperor I confer upon you the distinguished service order. Lt. Alan McGregor 41st Bengal Lancers, deceased. For valor. At the sacrifice of his life he destroyed enemy ammunition supplies contributing thereby to the success of our arms in the action at Mogala. His Majesty the King-Emperor has been graciously pleased to confer posthumously the Victoria Cross upon the late Lt. McGregor. In accordance with the custom of this regiment I place this cross upon the saddlecloth of his horse. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Stand by for the mail. We know you're not a pirate. We know, you'll get your knife back when we dock in Singapore. Say, you just get on a phone and call Scranton, PA... - and ask anybody about J. Wilberforce... - Have you any arms sir? Just these you see growing out of me armpits. You'll do. No excuses Mr. Atkins, your job is to look after this dock. If I ever find it in this state again, I'll, I'll... How's your wife? She's, she's very much better sir and thank you very much for the flowers. Oh, don't thank me, my gardener has to get rid of them somehow. Who's the big shot? Sir Guy Wilmerding, managing director of the line. Right this way Sir Guy. Gangway please. Glad to have you with us again sir. Oh, none of that mush. I know how glad you are. Not bad, not bad at all for a synthetic stone. - You ought to know Paul. - My lovely Olga. Hey, I bet that lug stops in China. That's the insignia of Wing YuLan, everything in the archipelago pays dividends to him. Good morning purser. Good morning Miss YuLan. We've made arrangements to take your chairs aboard in the after gangway. Thank you. Mr. Dawson sir, here comes the captain. Look at him, with a 3 days hangover and watch him grouse. Of all the ungrateful, brass hearted skippers of a rusty old teakettle... who thinks he's still strutting in the Royal Navy. Our captain. Oh Alan? Alan Gaskell? I got some last minute cargo for you. Oh hello Ken, what you doing up in broad daylight? Oh Captain Gaskell. I want you to meet Charlie McCaleb, the American novelist. - How do you do? - How do you do? Well, Hong Kong seems to have taken you to her bottom again. Now wait a minute, I've seen your face before. No, don't tell me, it's right on the tip of my tongue. - Remember Johnson? - Johnson? - Who? - Johnson. Oh Johnny old boy, what you doing way out here? - Oh, maybe you can tell me. - No, no, this is Captain Gaskell. - The master of the ship you're sailing on. - Hiya captain, coming along with us? Yes, yes, I'm afraid so. He's supposed to be over here gathering material for a new novel, I've dragged him... through wars, riots and revolutions. He doesn't even know he's in China. If you should stir up anything exciting, why... shove him in a front seat and tie his eyes open. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm not running a day nursery... and I'm not stirring up any excitement just for the sake of literature, see you later. Don't you worry old fella, I'll be right there, I'm the old Ringside Kid. Got an eye like an eagle. Goodbye Captain Greshall, had a marvelous trip. Ship ahoy, ship ahoy. Ship ahoy. - Are you all right Charley? - I cover the waterfront. - Steward. - Yes sir? Good morning sir. That's your idea of clean brass? - Sorry sir... - You haven't answered my question. No sir, it isn't my idea clean brass sir. You've been sampling my whiskey again, haven't you? Oh, yes sir. - Not as good as the last lot, is it? - No sir. Then why haven't you done something about it? - I will sir. - Thank you. Thank you sir sir Guy wants to see you sir. - Good morning captain. - Good morning. Ah, so there you are. Good morning Mrs. Aiken. We were just talking about you captain. Mrs. Aiken tells me you've been sensationally blotto ever since you went ashore. - Sir Guy? - Oh, she does, eh? You don't like my behavior ashore or aboard ship, you can get a new boy. In fact, I wish you would. - You wouldn't go if you could. - Wouldn't I? I'm so close to being back to England now I can hear Big Ben chiming. I've heard that from men for 50 years. It's only the weak ones that sneak out of the China Seas. It's the bullheads like you that stay on. What about a little spot to keep your brain from addling? No, I haven't the time. I've got to get the pride of your fleet underway. Mr. Rockwell, go to the captain's saloon, check those chronometers. - Good morning sir. - Good morning. Third officer hasn't come aboard yet sir. Yes, I know, I've just been looking him over, he's in the Sepoy Hospital. Tried to clean out High Spade McQueen's last night. - Bad sir? - Yes, knife in the kidneys. Port captain is trying to find someone to replace him. - What you got in your mouth? - Chewing tobacco sir. It's bad enough to have a ship like this and a captain that looks like... me without having a chief officer who looks like you. I'm sorry sir. Had it in me jaw when I came on duty and I forgot all about it. Oh Mr.Willet of the Royal Canada Bank is awaiting to see you sir. - He's just down there at your quarters. - Thank you. - Hello Willet. - Good morning captain. - Gold come aboard yet? - Yes sir. - All stowed away as we agreed? - In the steamroller. - Good. - Thank you sir. Wipe that smile off your face. Is that your idea of clean brass? You haven't answered my question. Did I ask you? A little too big for you, isn't it Mr. Rockwell? I apologize sir. Chief officer sent me down to check the chronometers. Yeah. - But I don't keep them in my cap. - No sir. - What you going to do with that button? - To button it sir. I was just hoping you weren't too angry with me sir. - Oh, carry on. - Thank you sir. Excuse me sir. - Who's in there? - It's China Doll, a gal that drives men mad. What the devil are you doing aboard? Nothing lambie, just showering the dewdrops off the body beautiful. How many hours do we have to spend saying goodbye before it takes? That's just the trouble toots, it took too good. Gee, were sweet to me. Say, I thought maybe you could use all that money you won at the Tai Fan last night. Oh, then we were there? Yeah, we had a million laughs. I made 17 straight passes myself. - Get on your horse, we're shoving off. But why you so anxious to get me out of here? Is that hunk of caviar making the round trip? What hunk of caviar? That red headed Russian princess whose aboard from Singapore. She isn't a Russian and she isn't a princess... and I have my doubts about her hair being red. I don't care what she is, if she was a Chinese sextet, it'd be the same thing to me. What I'm trying to get through your numb skull is that I'm not going to stand by... Now, wait a minute Dolly. You and I are friends. We had a lot of fun together. And as far as I'm concerned, you're a number one girl in the archipelago. But I don't remember making any vows to you nor do I recall asking for any. Don't you get polite at me, when you start talking with your high hat on I... I know you mean it and and scares me. Say, who do you think you are anyway? - If I had a nickel's worth of pride... - Alright. That's the way you feel about, I'm not standing in your way. That's just the soup I'm in, I don't feel that way at all. You, you dog. Oh, that's more like it. Come in. - Pilot tug's alongside sir. - Alright. Stand by to single up your lines fore and aft. Aye, aye sir. Alright, come on now nuisance, over shore. Oh but I'm looking, what I'm going to do with my ticket? It's all paid for and everything. And I knew you'd something up your sleeve. Alright, come on, we'll get your money back. No but I got a job in Singapore. - Honest... - Oh yes, yes, I know. I suppose they've elected you mayor. No but it's on the level, Hoffmann sent me a contract for the rest of the season. No. Look, I know how you feel about it. I won't come near you. Nobody will... No. Alright toots, you, you win, I... I hope you have a good trip, goodbye. Alright, alright, if you've got your ticket and a job, I don't suppose I... - Lambie. - Stop wrestling me around. You turning this skiff into an excursion launch. Come on, snap into it before the fore hold loading. You just came down to say goodbye? You brought enough of your cigarettes to last on a voyage to New York. Oh I'll smoke a lot more cigarettes than that toots, before we ever really say goodbye. Listen, I told you to... - Good morning sir. - Davids, isn't it? Tom Davids? Yes sir. Your port captain told me to report for duty as 3rd officer. - Duty as what? - Third officer. These rocking chair sailors ashore. Here I am in the middle of the typhoon season, a tough voyage ahead. I ask for a fighter, and they send me a punching bag. Give me a chance, is the first one I had for over a year. I know these waters better than most, I've sailed them as a master for over 10 years. No one had a better record on this coast than I had. Then, just because of an accident, I'm not a coward. Stow it Davids, you let pirates scuttle your ship... and you lost every white man aboard except yourself. The board of trade lifted your ticket, I didn't. Give me a chance please. You got a uniform? Nothing clean sir. Alright, I'll have the steward give you one of mine. - Yes sir. - Report to Mr. Dawson. I'll have the uniform laundered and return it to you. No, that's all right. Keep it, you probably need it. Thank you sir. Well, if it ain't old rough on rat himself, how are you, Jamesy? Dolly, you're looking just as pretty as ever, what you've been doing? - Bidding the big boy goodbye, eh? - Goodbye nothing, I'm making this voyage. - No, you're not. - Yeah. Why, I'm just as happy as if I'd won the Calcutta sweepstakes. You ought to have the shekels piled up to the roof by now. I haven't done so bad, you know... Dolly, I'm still willing to share it all with you. Say, there ain't enough dough in all Asia to make me change the way I feel about one guy. Still crazy about that Gaskell, eh? Well, whenever you get tired of running around with an Airedale... and you want to run around with a Saint Bernard, why, you let me know. Sure, whenever I get lost in the Alps, I'll whistle for you. - Alright, I'll come running, goodbye Dolly. - See you later. - You'd be easy with them there pigs. - Well Kingston, you're a wonder. How you've been able to sail with that... sour bellied Gaskell as long as you have, I don't know. - Hello Jamesy. - Well Captain Gaskell, I was just telling... Kingston how happy I was to be sailing with you. - Hey, stow that on the port side. - Yes, yes. You still carrying that cargo of soft soap, eh? No, no, really, I mean it. You don't know what a safe feeling it is to be... sailing with a captain that's never been raided by the pirates. Yes, there's not much profit for pirates in this zoo of yours. Say, who you swindling with this scrubby lot, eh? That's the finest lot of animals I've ever shipped. Well, they're not as noisy as that last batch of sopranos you had. Say now, Jamesy, just between you and me. - What do you give them to keep them quiet? - I just give them one of these little pills. And they sleep and dream all the way across, never lose a pound. I don't suppose you ever thought of giving them a little... gravel just to add a pound though. Why captain, that would be dishonest. They got big feet for singsong girls, haven't they? Well they, they don't bandage the feet nowadays, these are enlightened days. Those feet are big even for enlightened days. - Captain Gaskell sir. - Sir Rockwell. What is a woman do when you throw something at her? - A woman? - She dodges it, a man catches it. Here, catch. Sergeant of guard. Take them to shore, charge them with attempted piracy. And ask the police commissioner to wireless me anything he can sweat out them. Hido, Hido. You go ashore and tell Moray to bail them out before they start to talk. Tell Ngah I'll go through with the job as agreed but he'll need more men, go on. Hey captain, that's good work. You're the finest skipper on this coast. Thanks. - See you on the next trip. - Goodbye and thank you for all your trouble. - Take care of yourself dear. - I will. - So long Sybil and good luck. - Thank you so much. - B-39. - Thank you. - Don't forget to write Sybil. - I won't. - Sybil? - Alan? It is Alan. Oh, so this is your ship. My, I am lucky. Yes, yes, I'm captain of this tub. Are you visiting out here? Just traveling. You might start to unpack Pether. I've been just traveling for some time. I, I heard about Bart, I meant to write, but it was so long after he died. News is slow out here. We spoke of you so often, wondering what you were doing. Oh, getting into trouble mostly, then trying to get out of it. Well, you're in for more trouble now, looking after me for a whole voyage. I'm in your hands again Alan. Look here Alan, can't you get this boat? What's wrong? - Look as if you'd seen a ghost. - I have. - Gangplank secure sir. - All clear forward sir. - Cast off your bow line. - Aye, aye sir. Good morning captain. - Hiya neighbor, the name is Timmons. - Ah, I can take it or leave it alone. No, no, the name, Timmons. T - I - M - M - O - N - S. I'm the guy that can do it too. Who is it? - Who is it? - It's just me toots. Listen, when I told you to stay out of here, I wasn't shadowboxing, I meant it. - Oh, I just came in to borrow a book. - I don't keep them in my bathtub. I decided to improve my mind. You better take two books, give yourself an even break. Now, how about you doing about 3 turns around the deck... before dinner just to work up an appetite, eh? Ok, Ok toots. I know you ain't got much time to fool around with passengers. - It's your own fault, you wanted to be one. - Except maybe that English dame. - You're becoming very observant. - I saw her when she came aboard. She looked like she was smelling a dead fish or something. Considering her surroundings that's highly possible. And I also got a load of you when you moved her into the royal suite. Why didn't you lay out a red plush carpet for her? Well, that's just a throwback to my old manners. The lady happened to know me when I acted that way for the sheer joy of it. Oh, I get it, a hometown honey. I knew her years ago and her husband. Married? Oh, being married don't seem to tie her down none. He's dead. So, so she's back in circulation again. Well, maybe it's a good thing you didn't get hooked up with nobody out here. Thanks but if I'd had a more definite tie, I might've behaved a bit more decently. Say, if you ain't decent boyfriend, you'll do until something decent comes along. Out here maybe. But anywhere else in the world we'd both be a little bit soiled. Did you ever see an English river Dolly? No, I'm dumb at geography, just like I am at everything else. Well, it's cool, clear and clean. Put a stream like that alongside any river out here, dirty, yellow, muddy... you'll see the difference. That was only a few years ago. The pirates killed every white person aboard except the Capt and then scuttled the ship. Better take care of these pearls in the case of piracy. Why? They're artificial, they're not worth anything. 12 and a half bucks, quite a bargain I'd say. Where did you get them Mr. Timmons? - Well, she picked them up... - I bought them myself in Tokyo. Well you know, it's not always easy to tell the real from... - I'm sure you didn't pay too much for them. - Bet your sweet life she didn't. That little woman gets her money's worth every time, eh Poopsie? Hey, you see that chess game over there? When I was 4 years old, I played 10 people all at once, blindfolded. I lost every game. Pirates? Baloney. Where did you really get those pearls, eh? - You won't tell Wilbur, will you? - Twelve and a half bucks to Wilbur. That pirate hooey of yours is stuff they always tell tourists. I'll bet they don't rate one through nine with our rum-runners. Bosh, your rum-runners learned the game from our pirates. Even the hijacking and that trick of identifying each other... by matching the halves of a torn a hundred dollar bill. - Here they use a hundred pound note. - Sunday paper bunk. - Hey mate, come here. - Yes sir? - How are you Mr. Davids? - How are you Sir Guy? Tell him that bunk about the ship they held up and scuttled. Get a load of this, it's terrific. - I don't remember saying anything Timmons. - You can't get out of it like that. Tell him about the one white officer who came out of it alive. What's the matter with that bird? Was I speaking out of turn? I'm afraid you were, that's Tom Davids. Captain of the ship I was telling you about. Say, don't look now, well I think my stomach is full of butterflies. Isabelle. - Isabel MacCarthy. - Yes ma? Would you say that I looked like a lady? No Miss Dolly, I've been with you all too long to insult you that-away. Say, what's the difference? What's that snooty English dame got that I ain't? She's more refined like. She would never wear that dress with all them shiny beads you got. That dress is more my type. You've been hinting for that dress for a month. Go on and take it, you spoiled it for me anyway. You sure got the right feeling though honey. I got to let this out a smidgen. You sure is got the right instincts no matter what they all say. What do they say? Oh, it's just a mite of talk, they say yous got yourself so hooked on to that... Captain Gaskell that he's shaking himself like a wet hound dog... and can't get you loose no how. Yes Miss, they do, like a wet hound dog. He can't shake me off, I hopped off, see? And I'm glad I did, do you hear that? I'm glad, I'm happy. Sure you's happy honey. But don't you worry, you'll get over it. Twenty years on the China Seas and she never lost a spangle. I had a spangle once, it was a cockier spangle. She had a litter of field mice. Good evening Miss Portland, I've got you the other side of Mr. MacArdle. - Oh well, I get it, where is the big guy? - You mean the captain miss? He went, that is I believe he's escorting Mrs. Barclay. Oh, why doesn't she put a ring in his nose so she can lead him around easier? Excuse me sir. Say, Ah Feng, bring me a double hooker of scotch quick. Yes miss. Well Jamesy, you old trambo, long time no see kid. No fault of mine Dolly, you're the original one man girl.. As long as I've got a one gal guy. I just saw Captain Gaskell upstairs walking with Mrs. Barclay. Very lovely looking girl, isn't she? She couldn't take me away from a girl like you in a thousand years. Hey, what makes you think she's taking anything away from me, eh? Get on the belt line and keep them coming. I think you know everybody Sybil, except perhaps Miss YuLan, Mrs. Barclay. How do you do? - And Miss Portland. - How do you do? Hello. You needn't be so confoundedly possessive Alan I knew Mrs. Barclay long before you did. Say, you had such a start. I'm only trying to catch up. Ah, you had your chance Sir Guy but you spurned me. At least Alan didn't meet me till after I was married. That ruins all my guesses. I had such a romantic meeting arranged for you two. The squadron ball at Gibraltar, music, lanterns, uniforms... Her husband was at sea so I claimed every dance. - We walked back to the hotel together. - With or without moonlight? Oh, there was a harvest moon. You've never seen a moon until you've watched the one over China Seas. It'll be full by the time we get to Singapore. Oh glorious. Say, speaking of meetings Jamesy, do you remember that night in that putang joint... in Saigon when you and me met up with a certain party? Oh, do I. There wasn't any moon but he had a shiner on his left eye that lit up the whole street. A cut on his right leg, why he'd bled to death if it hadn't been for China Doll here. - My, that was a romantic meeting. - She saved his life. And never got a word of thank for it, I'll be darned. I wish I could tell you what she said when I tried it. You never used to be so particular about your language. That's right Dolly. This will be an awful comedown after the Royal Mail. Oh, I don't know, there's something very real and dramatic about this atmosphere. You know, pirates and machine guns, barricades... Mr. McCaleb, I want you to meet a literary rival of yours Mrs. Barclay. Oh, good evening Mr. McCaleb. Thanks, I've got all the insurance I can handle. And Mrs. Barclay, I'm sure I saw you in London two years ago. Why, of course Miss Yu-LAN, it was at the American Embassy... and then again at the Gainsboroughs' in Sussex. Peg, isn't she the most amazing hostess? It was only two years before that I... Too amazing for words, there I was, with a cinder in me eye as large as a paving block. With the grand duke on one side of me and the marquis on the other... both trying to get pull my top lid over my bottom. Miss Portland is a professional entertainer. No, I am lady or you'd like me to try something else. No, I'm afraid you haven't anything left for an encore. So you think it's funny, eh? What are you grinning at? - You must be very fond of him. - What makes you think so? To humiliate yourself like this. I'll see you later Alan. Don't worry, he knows where the royal suite is and... so do I, I had it the first time I sailed on this ship. The more violent the storm, the sooner it subsides. When I want you to sound off, golden bells, I'll pull your rope. I, I apologize for this exhibition, it's all my fault. And as the man said when they were about to hang him, this will be a lesson to me. Madam chairman and ladies of this literary group... it is with sentiments of profound respect that I address you this afternoon. Because woman is the mother of all literature, I thank you. Hey look, I'm awful sorry I blew up. Honest, I am. But hookers of scotch and the fact that I'm so fighting nuts about you, I can... You saved me a lot of trouble, you painted the whole dirty picture... for her with a nice, truthful brush, thanks. Gee toots, don't talk to me like that. I get scared when you put the freeze on me. Look, I'll go to her... - apologize, do anything in the world you... - You keep as far away from her as you can. And farther away from me. Come. - Captain Gaskell sir. - Well, what's wrong Mr. Rockwell? Your navigation chart... Excuse me sir, this navigation problem sir, I'm having trouble with it. - Trouble? - Yes sir. Yes, I should say you are. If your figures are correct Mr. Rockwell this ship is in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Yes sir, it has me worried sir. Yes. Well, suppose you try adding here instead of subtracting. Perhaps that'll put us back in the ocean again. Yes sir, thank you sir. - Alright. - Excuse me sir. How's it toots? Well, go on and play dumb if you want to, I just came in to... tell you I'm not going to come around and pester you anymore. Look. I'm taking all my cigarettes. You know, it's moonlight outside. Gee, it's pretty. Ain't it funny, we always fight when it's moonlight and make up when it's raining? It's about time for the rainy season, ain't it toots? Ah, come on out of the trenches, I'm not going to throw any bombs, I'm harmless. Yes, of course, you're as harmless as a revolution. Well, don't forget your cigarettes. I won't, I know an exit line when I hear one. Well, anyway, it won't be so lonely while Jamesy is aboard. I hate to hear you talk like that Dolly. Well, a gal is got to do the best she can with what's around. You owe yourself more than that. The trouble is boyfriend, there ain't any male Mrs. Barclay, so charming, so refined. The real trouble is there aren't enough female Mrs. Barclay. Don't give it another thought Alan. You know, I once hoped you'd know me very well but not that well. But when you once hoped, you, you weren't in this part of the world. No, that's true but here I am. - Yes? - Captain Gaskell. Mr. MacArdle wants to go forward to look after his animals. No MacArdle can't look at his animals. I wouldn't let an admiral go forward without a guard. You find it an exciting part of the world, don't you? Exciting? Nursing and cursing a bunch of leftovers who are supposed to be officers... derelicts for a crew? But ashore, the glamor of... Yes, you saw me this morning after a trip ashore, did I look particularly glamorous? Well, I wasn't thinking of backgrounds. - That girl, she's glamorous, surely. - Sybil, I don't deny her. But you know why I came out here, why I resigned from the service. - It's all I could do. - Yes, we... I might've cracked up Bart's life if you'd stayed. Sybil. If I thought there was the slightest chance, I... I'd stumble out with everything I wanted to say six years ago, I... Alan, I have a confession to make. I'm not just traveling, I followed a memory, traced you here. And now that I've found you, I don't care how you've lived. I'll always be in love with you. I'll jump ship at Singapore. We'll dig up a magistrate or a chaplain. A Buddhist monk, if there's none other. We'll go back together. Oh, England. I've a place in Sussex with a fireplace you can stand in. Your cocoa sir. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Come in old man, come right in. What's the matter? What happened to you? The chef is been at the vanilla extract again sir. Wait for me with a cleaver. A cleaver is a new matter sir. Ah yes. Well, give him a quart of brandy to taper off on, he be alright in the morning. Sybil, I want you to meet the best chief steward in the line, Ted Gary. Honest as the day is long. And he said to Mrs. Barclay, right in front of me, I was the best steward in the line. Honest as the day is long. And never a word about that last bottle of whiskey I pinched. No doubt, the old man is going soft. Relieved me right in the middle of me watch so I could come to breakfast. Called me Bertie. I had a chew of tobacco in my mouth as big as that and he never even noticed. And he said he'd take me to the races ashore. Well... That's the way it is with those two bottle men, I've never seen it fail. - All of a sudden... - I knew a man once in Liverpool that way. Davids. - Aren't you going to wait for your coffee? - No. - It's too stuffy here. - And smelly too. May I please have the sugar sir? Thank you. Mark. - Good. - Lovely shot. That's a lovely gun. I hope that they don't leave them laying around loose. Captain lock them up all the time we no use. - That's good. - Mark. - Hiya. - Ah, good morning. - Good morning. - Oh, good morning. I guess she's still burned. Mark. I got it then. I'm afraid you're much too consistent for me Mrs. Barclay. Oh, not at all. Mark. I received your note, really wasn't necessary. Oh, I'm sorry I acted so crazy. Say Jamesy, how about you and me starting a little competition for the common people, eh? - Alright, I, I'll bet you a shilling. - Ok. Bring us a gun. There you are. Are you and Captain Gaskell going to make your home in Singapore or Hong Kong? Oh, I don't think we're going to stay out here at all. Did you hear what she said? It's all over the ship that they're going to get married... the minute they get into Singapore. - That's why Gaskell is turned sunny side up. - Mark. I think you're very wise not to stay in the Orient. We have a saying out here... After the cheap, strong wine, the most delicate tea has little flavor. - Oh, be careful. - Oh, I'm sorry, I... Quite all right, you had no idea the gun was loaded. Oh, you don't think I pointed it at you on purpose, do you? There's nothing to think about Miss Portland. The gestures of a woman like you simply do not exist. Mark. It's beautiful the way these ducks know how to throw the old harpoon. That's one of the advantages of a very fine cosmopolitan education. Come on Jamesy, let's you and me take a powder. Clay pigeons, that's the thrilling sort of life you're headed for in England Alan. Shooting clay pigeons, eh? Exactly and whether you believe it or not, I'll revel in it. Greetings boyfriend. Well I, I understand congratulations are in order. I'd like to be the first to wish you the best, you'll need it. One day, you'll say something nice and never forgive yourself. Look toots, I... Oh gee, I don't blame you for being sore, I know I've done a lot of stupid gabbing... but this is on the level, I wish you all the luck. And that's one baby you'll never have... to be ashamed of. She's the real McCoy and she'll make a... a marvelous wife for you. - I wish you meant that. - I do. Well, well, that's better. Now, let's quit good friends, instead of like a couple of cabdrivers after a drunken brawl. Yeah, I guess that's the way it ought to be done. But I ain't been brought up to do the right thing like that English dame. All I can say is what's down inside of me. And I don't care how long you've been carrying the torch for her. You can't quit me any more than I can quit... you and you can kiss a stack of cookbooks on that. - Thank you. - Well, anyway it'll be quieter in England. - Wait till you get there, if you ever do. - What's to keep me? Well, I've been trying it for 30 years, there's something about this place. From my windows I can see the whole harbor of Hong Kong. Big ships coming, big ships going, the China I know, the China I've helped to make. And on quiet nights, off in the hills, I can hear the sound of distant firing. They were at it when I came and they'll be at it after I've gone. More guns won't stop them too many of them. And the only things they respect are courage and honor. Yes and England's power, England's place here... can never be any greater than the men who represent her. They might be able to use an Englishman at home sometime, you know. Oh, I was hoping that someday you'd take my place. - I had me eye on you for a long time. - Well, take it off. I'm quitting the China Seas as soon as we dock. Well, if you're... - in earnest? - Dead earnest. I'd better be looking for somebody to take your command, eh? What about Dawson? Dawson? Take my ship? I've always heard you speak highly of him. Yes. Yes, of course I speak highly of him. Dawson is one of the best. Absolutely, you couldn't do better. Dawson? I never forget a name or a face, now, I've seen you somewhere before. You've seen me a dozen times a day since... No, don't tell me, don't tell me, it's on the tip of my tongue. The name is Timmons, T - I - M - M - O - N - S. How do you pronounce that? Timmons, Timmons, Timmons, T- I - M - M... I thought he said Timmons. I drink to the health of Admiral Puff. My compliments to Mr. Dawson. - Tell him I'll be up on the bridge shortly. - I drink to the health of Admiral Puff. Whoopee, are you good Jamesy? - Attaboy Jamesy. - You called sir? What? Oh, yes, yes. See that all the staterooms and portholes are secured. - We're in for a blow. - Will it be a real storm Alan? Terrifying? All seas aren't alike, can't tell much more. I did hope for your sake, though, it'd be an easy trip. That's too much to expect from the China Seas. Attaboy... Anything else sir? What? Yes. Might tell them that anybody that can't hold his or her liquor... better lay off until this blows is over. I'm afraid you're a good influence on him Sybil and I deplore it. - Alright, here we go again. - I beg your pardon. Here's to the health of Admiral Puff Puff Puff, three times. - Ok? - Perfect. - I think you did one bounce too many. - Ah, she was all right. I had my eye on her just like a hawk. My dear fellow, what do you suppose I was doing? Oh, there's two against one, two against one. Captain says the weather is blowing up, a word to the wise. Come on Jamesy, we're off again. Greatest game in the world, that makes men remember and women forget. I'll play this game until you can't remember anything but your little Jamesy. Here's to the health of Admiral Puff three times. Keno, you forgot to say Admiral Puff Puff Puff. Oh, doggone it anyway, I... - Drink up sir and start all over again. - Come on, down the hatch. Ah, don't look so sad toots, you doing swell. Have you ever noticed Sir Guy, that a man is never angry with a woman he doesn't like? - I had not, until now. - Me either. And I shall be more pleasant to her after this, shall we? Good evening skipper, how's the barometer doing? - Falling to a new low. - Well, don't let that worry you captain. Say, where you been keeping yourself stranger? Have breakfast with me in the morning, if you can eat anything. I'll be there, nothing takes my appetite. Say, how about joining the game that kills all care? Oh, I'm afraid it would kill me too, good night. Kill nothing, all you need is a wooden, hollow leg to play this game. Here's to the health of Admiral... - Prosit. - Prosit. Missed out again Jamesy, sock it down boy. It's thickening up like mud sir, we're running right into it. Running into it? We're in it already. Why don't you keep her on her course? What you trying to do? Write your name in the ocean? Old man is getting back to normal, good thing with this coming on. Put your oilskins on and get to your stations, stick her nose right into it. Yes sir. Mr. Davids, tell the steward to look out for his passage... - better get life belts on them. - Yes sir. - Exciting sir, isn't it? My first typhoon. - Really? Well, if you live long enough you may see another one sometime. - Get to your station. - Yes sir. Excuse me sir. Chief, keep up a full head of steam, we're in for a twister. Good old Grandfather. Don't get panicky, just stick by me. Hey, stop showing off, come on up here. Come on lady, slip into this. I really shouldn't you know, with my figure. Tie it up in the front. Let me help you miss. You've lost your pearls. No, I, I broke the string Mr.Romanoff has them. Yes, yes, I will restring them for her as soon as we get out of this. Oh, I never want to see them again. Throw them away, do anything you please. Oh, if we only come out of this alive. Now, now, Poopsie, don't let a little wind blow you off your feet. Have you seen Miss Portland sir? - Isn't she in her cabin? - No. By Jove, if she went out on deck in the condition she was in... You all, you all don't suppose she's been washed overboard? Can't find Miss Portland sir, afraid she may have been washed overboard. - Keep your hand to it. - Aye, aye sir. - Where's MacArdle? - His door is locked sir. - Why didn't you break it down? - Was afraid to without orders. That's the game, you old beachcomber, I beat you, you hear that? I won. Prosit. Hey, that's the typhoon, that's the typhoon Jamesy. Come on, give me the other 20 you owe me, come on. Ah, quit stalling Jamesy, and give me that 20 you owe me. Alright, if you won't give it to me, I'll take it. What a twister that was. Hello Dolly. Well, where you going? Winners always go home, don't they? What's the idea of locking the door? - Caveman stuff, eh? - Oh no, it's... - It's just a force of habit Dolly. - Say, are you trying to insult me? Did I ever take anything that wasn't coming to me? Why darling, you, you know that you could have anything that I've got, anytime. - Now, come on you, fork that over. - Alright welsher. There's 200 that I won and I won on the level, if you ain't a good enough sport... No, you don't, you know what I'm talking about. You know what I mean. You know, it's pretty stormy out there and you never know when you might wash overboard. - Say, are you threatening me? - Dolly, you've seen it. - I haven't. - I tell you, you've seen it. I haven't, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about that half of the 100 note that you just took from my wallet. I don't know what you're saying but I'll forget you ever said anything. Dolly, it would do you no good to double cross me. - Oh, this is a hanging matter. - I don't want to hear another word. If it was anybody else but you, I'd chuck you overboard. But I'm so crazy about you it's eating my insides out. - You're in with me. - I don't want to be, I... Dolly, you're in with me, there's a quarter of a million pounds of gold on this ship. Your share will make you a rich woman. We can go anywhere, do anything. Look, I'm no good to you. - What do you want with me? - Because you're a smart girl. You're smart enough to hide that note, you're smart enough to know what it means. - Yeah, I'm smart enough to stay out of this. - Even as much as I love you... you're in with me from now on or else... I'm going to break that pretty little neck of yours just like... - The marines have landed. - I'm sorry to interrupt. Dolly and I were just sealing a little partnership... which I hope she'll never have cause to regret. Perhaps you better do your sealing in the main salon where there's lot more witnesses. Maybe you're right captain. Look out. - Hold her. - That was a near thing Alan. Dawson. - Get some lines, lash this down. - Come here with that line. Hey, come here. - Cold darling? - Yeah, yeah, cold, that's it. You with me? - It's a tough ocean to try and swim in. - That's a good girl. Now, you keep miles away from that fella Gaskell or... I might think that you're trying to double-cross me. Captain Gaskell, the steamroller is loose sir. It'll mash those coolies like a lot of turnips. Oh, the poor devils. Let it go overboard. Come on. Close up that rail. Davids, lend a hand. Get the tarps off those winches. Alright, turn on the steam. Go to your quarters, you're under arrest. Well, what do you want? I want to thank you sir, for saving my life sir. - Oh, go to bed. - Is it all over sir? Yeah, we'll stand regular watch from now on. Mr. Kingston, what time do you come on watch? - Eight bells sir. - You're one minute late. I'm sorry sir. Keep her half speed and make your repairs on the port engine. Aye, aye sir. - Davids is here sir. - Yes. Alright. I know what I'd do with him if this was my ship. Well, wait till you get a ship. Mr. Davids... Yes sir. Mr. Davids, for the rest of this voyage, you'll be relieved of... duty and confined to your quarters in arrest. When we reach port, I'll have to turn you in to the board of trade... for neglect of duty and disobedience of orders. I don't blame you sir. But it's funny somehow, during the year I've been on the beach... I've prayed every day for a chance. And then when I got it, I couldn't make good. I'm just a washout, that's all. I'm sorry Davids. - Call me when you relieve the watch. - Yes sir. This will cost you your ticket. It's me toots, I've been waiting for you to come off watch. Get out of here. Look, I got a mighty good reason for being here. You've always got a good reason for anything you're doing. In fact, I don't know anybody who could think up any... more remarkable good reasons than you can on short notice. Listen to me toots, I took an awful chance coming here. - I might have got heaved overboard. - Well, don't run any more risk by staying. - Get off on the rest of your rounds. - Toots, you got to listen to me. - I only came here for one thing. - I'm quite aware of that. You're always waiting for a sailor, to comfort him... as only a woman like you can comfort a man who's too tired or too drunk to care who is. Toots, don't be like that, if you keep that up you got to talk yourself right out of... I hope so. Oh, you hope so, do you? Well, you've been begging for it, now you're going to get it. You won't be so high and mighty when I get through with you. You just wait, I'll fix you, you'll be lower than a coolie, you'll be lower than Davids. You'll come crawling to me on your knees. I warned you not to double cross me. You said you could use the gun. Well darling, you're a marvel. You're a real partner. You know, I thought that you was going... What is it matter what you thought I was going to do? You got what you wanted. Ah, don't take it so hard Dolly. Oh, take what too hard? I got what I wanted too. I guess. Sparks, Sparks. Look out sir Malays. Oh look, they're bringing them right now. Got a cigarette Jamesy? I thought you said nobody get hurt. You can't expect the boys to stand there... and take it after someone cuts loose at them, can you? - I must've been crazy, stark staring crazy. - Take it easy, take it easy. Be careful. What you hiding those pearls for? They do not worth anything. I don't want to lose them. You're perfectly right my dear, I've been through one of these things before. They take everything in sight. Something funny about those pearls, I'm going to have... appraised when we get to Singapore. Wilbur, don't be insane. Every one of those guns came out of our arsenal. - Our arsenal sir? - Yes. I don't see how they could've broken down the steel door. An-may in the ife-lay oat-bay. - Davids. - Yes Dawson. - No savvy Malay. - Do you? Not enough but MacArdle does, I'm sure. Hey look here, don't any of these fellows speak English? No savvy. Now, isn't that just too bad? Oh, that's terrible. Yes. Look here, whoever you are, in that lifeboat out there... there are some mills bombs in the seat locker in my quarters. Yeah, if you're not too badly hurt watch your chance and try and get them. I'll hold them here as long as I can. - No savvy. - No savvy? There's your chance Mr. Dawson. - And get those bombs. - He's crazy, what's the use? - I'd only be shot at. - Yes. I understand Mr. Dawson. Get out of my way. As far as I can make out, he comes from a very royal family and is very sorry to... - disturb you like this. - Why, no disturbance at all. He wishes to assure you that no one will be harmed. If you will open the strongbox... he'll willingly take the gold and depart with only the friendliest feelings toward you. - Open the safe. - Yes sir. You haven't lost your ticket ye, old man. If you want me to, I'll be only too glad to put in a good word for you. Where's Alan? You don't think they'll hurt him, do you? No, no, of course not, my dear, no. No, they need the captain healthy. I'm sorry Poopsie, looks like that guy did the appraising. Why that's sand, you're pretty smart Gaskell. Well, apparently the bank patronized some other line. You can't fool these Malays with an old trick like the boxes of sand. Why, whoever is at the head of this gang is got brains. They know when there's gold on board a ship. Why, their spies tell them about every shipment... of gold that leaves any bank in Hong Kong. Listen MacArdle, make it clear to him. If there was any gold aboard, he could have it and welcome. Listen man, I'm talking to you as though I'm your own brother. Save yourself while there's still time. Look here, that's my skipper, you can't... Looks as if the party came too late. Why, it's the boot, the Malay boot. - Why, that's cruel torture. - Size is 9C. Why, you're not going to let him torture you? Have you any suggestions? - Is that the latest style? - Don't let them do that man. Why, you'll never be able to use your... - foot again. - Listen Jamesy, you're a fast talker. Better one I've ever seen, tell him something, tell him anything. Tell him the bank fooled me as much as it did him. I've talked my head off, he won't listen. Tell him where it is, I can't bear it. It's killing me to stand here and not be able to help you. - I can't bear it. - Well, put your fingers in your ears. Stubborn half-wit. - Gaskell, my boy Gaskell. - Don't start counting, I'm getting up. Please tell them where it is Gaskell. Why, it's breaking my heart to see you suffer like this. There can't be any gold, he would've talked. Nobody could be that tough. Come on, club out. Die you... Oh, you poor boy, you. I made them understand there's no gold here. It was Jamesy that saved your poor feet for you. Are they gone? Yes, it's all right, they're getting into the junk. Here, take it easy, there's nothing you can do. Here Gaskell. Davids. - Davids. - Davids. Shut your mouth. - I got the bombs. - Good, good, let me have this one. Keep clear while I blow my way out. And thanks Davids. Can you make it over and heave it in that junk? I'll try. Davids, remember after you pull the pin, you only got five seconds until it goes off. - You're crazy, you'll get us all killed. - Get back. One. Two. Three. Four. Hey, a little less noise please. Captain Gaskell? - What you find? - Not even a scratch on the door sir. The arsenal must've been opened with a key. Tell the chief steward to bring MacArdle and Miss Porter to my cabin. Yes sir. Listen darling, where did you put that half of the hundred pound note? - I know it's safe but I got to... - I hid it. - Where? - In Gaskell's cabin, in a tin of cigarettes. - Well, aren't you a wonder. - It's safe. He won't find it, he doesn't smoke my kind. - Oh, quit worrying, I'll get it. - No, you won't. You'll stay right where you are till this thing blows over. Now, promise me darling, that you won't go near the place. That's easy. I wouldn't exactly enjoy looking... Looking at his bandaged feet. Well, that's too bad. But what about us? What about the poor devils he captured? You know, I wouldn't put it past him to use the Chinese boot on them. - If he does, they'll talk. - Oh, he won't use the boot. - He'd never hit a man below the belt. - Well, we're not hung yet. Gaskell may suspect the whole world but he's got to prove it. - Well, let him prove it, let him prove it. - Are you out of your mind? Alright, come in. Captain Gaskell's compliments and will you come to his cabin? And you too Miss Portland. Just a minute. - Jamesy, that... - Now, now, now, wait a minute. It's simply a matter of routine. If it comes to the worst, I'm the only one that he can prove anything against. So you just sit tight and keep a stiff upper lip. Alright bozo. Order me an upper and lower and I'll keep them both stiff. Alright, come on, answer. - After you left my cabin, where you go? - Back to my own quarters. - What time was that? - About half past 11. - Was anybody there? - Nobody but Isabel, I told her to go to bed. Your maid says she was asleep at a quarter after 9, two hours before. Ah, it's always a quarter after 9 to that numbskull, it's the only time she knows. - Did anybody come to your cabin later? - My dates are my own now. The deck watch saw a man leaving your cabin after 1 o'clock, that was you, wasn't it? - Look here Alan, that's not... - I'm conducting this inquiry Sir Guy. That was you, wasn't it? What do you want me to do? Blacken the lady's name? - That was Jamesy, wasn't it? - Well, supposing it was, what then? Why was he in your cabin? He came to borrow a hot water bottle for one of his pigs. - Got a cigarette Jamesy? - No darling. - Here, here you better have one of your own. - No, never mind, I don't... No, no bother at all, I know what these little attentions mean to a woman. Well I, I don't want one now. I guess it's just nerves, I... Oh. Oh, I'm sorry you don't feel well, you rode out the piracy as such a good shape. - Perhaps you'd like one. - Well, well, thank you. The captain is far more generous with your cigarettes than you ever were. Too generous. I guess I'll take them home with me while there's... still a couple left for myself. - How many tins have you Jamesy? - One. - Four and one are five, are... - Lose any? I thought I left six here. Oh, yes, yes, so you did, I almost forgot. I don't understand this cat and mouse business. Is this the one? Yes, that's it. You won't find what you're looking for, I've both halves of the hundred pound note. Oh, what are you browbeating the girl for? Just a minute MacArdle, your turn is next. One half of the note was found on a dead pirate, the other half was hidden... in her cigarette tin. Hello. - These Chinese characters look familiar. - Yes, they're MacArdle's shipping symbol. Well, that's queer. If I wasn't sure of it, why, I'd swear that I wrote those characters. I'll swear you wrote them MacArdle before any admiralty court. Yes? Well, what will your oath prove? Save your breath MacArdle, we caught two of your men, they've talked. - You used the Chinese boot on them. - No, I saved that for you, if I needed it. How did you manage to get the ship's rifles? You couldn't have done a thing without them. You've answered to all the questions so far, don't stop now. Alright, I won't. - You gave him the key to the arsenal. - Me? She gave me nothing. You were the only one who knew where it was besides myself, you came to my cabin... - Alright, you lost it. - Waited till I passed out... - get to the key and handle over to MacArdle. - That's a dirty rotten lie, I'll sue the line and get plenty too. - Defaming a lady's character... - Yes, quartermaster. - Yes sir? - Tell the sergeant at guard to come here. And send a radio message to the police superintendent in Singapore. - Tell him to meet us at the dock, urgent. - Urgent, yes sir. And you better send for a squad of lawyers too if... you think you going to pin anything on me. - What a dirty little snake you are. - What's that to you? Getting into my cabin because I trusted you. - Trust? When do you really trust... - Waiting for a chance to... - do your double cross. - I didn't. - Turning on your own people. - I didn't, I... - Sold out every man woman coming on-board. - Alright then, I did. I stole the key, yes, I stole it and gave it to Jamesy. But I came to your cabin to warn you about him, figure it out for yourself why I didn't. I'd have stood and fought back to back with you. But you taught me something I didn't even know myself. When a woman can love a man right down to her fingertips, she can hate him the same way. Now call your cops, call every cop in the country, I don't care. If you can dish it out, I can take it. You fool, you hotheaded, crazy little fool. And me thinking all the time that my powers of fascination had won her. Ah, don't be so tough Gaskell. China Doll had nothing to do with it at all. You think it's as simple as all that? I'm not the judge, the jury and the law. You'll find that out soon enough. No, I won't. I've fooled them many a time before and I've done it again. I've cost you millions, and I'd still be fooling them... if it wasn't for the little yellow haired lass sad... that wouldn't even give me the time of the day. - What's wrong MacArdle? - Nothing, nothing. Nothing at all. One of those pills will make a pig sleep the entire voyage. - I'll sleep until kingdom come. - Get a doctor quick. Jamesy. I had a chance darling, to throw you overboard. If I had, I'd still be safe. Loving you is the only decent thing I ever did in my life. Even that was a mistake. - You sent for me sir? - Take Miss Porter to her cabin. Keep a close watch over her until further orders. Aye sir. Well, he's out of it anyway. - He finished the game the way he played it. - Yeah, tough. He didn't yell no dice when they rolled against him, I won't either. Good luck toots. - Singapore. - So am I, where are you from? Lordy, Lordy. Now I got enough clothes to last me a million years. Well, I hope you have better luck in them than I did. Don't you worry Miss Dolly, I got me a conjure. The left hind leg of a black cat that's been killed by a snakebite. Nothing going to touch me no matter what they does to you. Yes? Well darling, have you put your house in order? No, it's in a worse mess than ever. Sybil, I should've told you before, I'll be tied up here for weeks at the hearing. Now Alan dear, what are you trying to tell me? Be frank. That's just it... I want you to escape all the frankness it's going to be thrown around the next few weeks. Everybody will know about it, read about it. Even at home, for that matter, the people you know. But you can live down a scandal if you want to. Yes but this will have an official stamp on it. I'll have to get up in court, tell the whole story. I want to Sybil, because I'm involved. In fact, I'm as guilty as she. Guilty? Oh, what nonsense. How could you be Alan? I am though. She tried to warn me about MacArdle, I wouldn't listen. I nearly threw her out. With as dirty an insult as a man could give a woman. - That's not like you. - I don't know why. Except, I'd just seen her in MacArdle's cabin. I didn't think she get skid that far. And you're really in love with... this old tub after all. No, no but it's that too. After all you can't pile up 6 years... of something and then just leave in the flash, you know? No. No, of course not. Well, I'm off to the hotel. I'll take the next boat home. You know, I came 15,000 miles to find you Alan. Now you're further away than you ever were. You wouldn't like that fireplace in Sussex. I think that's what I've been trying to tell you. Sybil, aren't you clinging to something that I could never be again? Yes, perhaps I am. But I think that's the only beautiful way it ever could be. - Goodbye Alan. - Goodbye Sybil. Come on, you large, limping seagull. Come to the office and resign. Don't worry about that, I'll resign soon enough. All I got to do is scratch my name on a piece of paper. Around this madhouse, it's always a million things to do before you can do what you want. - I'll make it easy, honest I will Poopsie. - Good bye. Hey, you're just the guy, where can I pick up a string of genuine pearls for the missus? Oh, yes, yes, I'll be very glad to arrange it for you. That's a pal, I told you I'd square with you Poopsie. You squared it beautifully. Bank sent for the gold sir. - Alright, turn it over to them. - But there isn't any gold sir. - The boxes were full of sand. - Oh yes, yes, so they were. The shipment is in the toolbox of the steamroller. Steamroller? Toolbox? That stumps me sir, I never would've thought of looking for it there. No, I was counting on that. Oh, so you decided to make the trip after all? Yes. Yes, I just came along looking for local color. Local color, phooey. If anybody could get local color, I can get it. These streets are in deplorable condition. Quartermaster, fish him out before he soaks up all the local color in the harbor. Aye, aye sir. Come in. - Is the police superintendent ready? - He'll be here any minute now, come on. Goodbye, Isabel. Goodbye Miss Dolly, you sure been mighty good to me, - Skip it. - Even if they does hang you. Well, there's the old Quien-Howe. Aren't they ever going to paint that smokestack? Boy, how you used to crab about it when you were first mate on her. Seems like a thousand years ago. Well, you don't need to talk if you don't want to. I was only doing it for the benefit of those mugs back there. That's what I thought. I've never seen the time yet when you could overlook an audience. That's more like it, it's kind of good to have you barking at me again. Always worrying about your performance, you don't care... about anything except, how is the act going? What you crying for? I can't help it. Get in there and quit that blubbering. - Now, listen to me numbskull. - I'm all ears. My official job ends when I turn you over to the police superintendent. From then on, I'll be on your side of the fence. Oh, what's the use? I'll plead guilty and take what's coming. - You're going to tell the whole truth. - Sure I am, that's the least I can do. And I'm going to tell the truth, everything. That you tried to warn me, that, well, that I was drunk. - Oh, no, you weren't. - Yes, I was. Dead drunk. Oh, you big cluck, you'll gum up the works, you'll ruin yourself. You'll bust up your whole career if you do that. It's nothing else to do Dolly, it's your only chance. Oh, never mind me, what about her? She going back to England. - Back to England? But you still love her. - She's leaving on the next boat. Oh, you can't let her do that toots, you still in love her. - Don't start telling me what to do. - I said, you're still in love with her. - And don't yell like that, I'm not deaf. - Oh, you poor sap, you love her. And don't call me a sap. - You love her. - Yes, I love her. But not the way I do you. Oh toots, you can't. That ain't fair, ain't right. A nogood dame like... me why, I'll always have you in trouble Alan. No, you won't. Married life will slow you down plenty. You... You'd marry me? Well no, not if you're going to make it such a blasted favor. Oh, you, you poor sap. Come in. - Good morning captain. - Good morning superintendent. - Here's your receipt for the prisoners. - Yes, all right. I'll be over as soon as I get through. - Anything you want... - Anything I... Toots, I got everything. Come on superintendent, let's get on the horse. What about a nip to cool that aching brow? No, no, fix one for yourself, I got to get around to court. Somebody will have to protect that judge. Those shoes are disgraceful on an officer Mr. Kingston. - A hose coupling just broke sir. - Hose couplings shouldn't break. Change the hose and change your shoes Mr. Kingston. Yes sir. Change your shoes Mr. Kingston. A piracy, a typhoon, a disabled ship swung into port, his sweetheart on her way to... jail and all he can say by way of conversation... - is change your shoes Mr. Kingston. - That bark of his is all front. - He's really pretty sick at heart. - Sick? The man hasn't got a heart. Perhaps not Mr. Kingston but whatever it is he has, it gets things done. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, This way. Court is assembled by the Right Honorable Lords, Commissioners of the Admiralty and I quote: To enquire into the cause and circumstances of the seizure of His Majesty's armed vessel, The Bounty, commanded by Lieutenant William Bligh and to try the said Lieutenant William Bligh for his conduct on that occasion. Surrender your sword and be seated. Lieutenant Bligh. Perhaps it would be useful if you told the court in your own words the events of April 28th last year. Yes sir. If it please my Lords, I will first read a list of the mutineers who seized my ship. The crew is not on trial here, Mr Bligh. You, sir, are on trial. The question at issue is how you came to lose your ship. To understand that, Captain Greetham, it is essential to know who were the mutineers aboard that ship. Alleged mutineers. Continue Mr Bligh. Fletcher Christian, Masters Mate. Wasn't this Christian a friend of yours? He was, sir. Fifty guineas says he's dead. Sixty says he's alive. I'll wager he's still alive. How much? We'll dine within the hour. - How much? - Sixty guineas. Taken. I'll be back to collect it. Graham! Fletcher! What are you all doing? One of our members collapsed. We're betting on whether or not he's dead. What brings you to this den of iniquity? Is there somewhere we can talk? It's a breadfruit. Breadfruit. The Admiralty has instructed me to take breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica. Tahiti? Fletcher, I want you to sail with me again. In what capacity? The Admiralty's already assigned a Mr John Fryer as Master of the ship. He's a good man I think. But I want you to be Master's Mate. - If you agree, that is. - Agreed. Good, splendid! Good. Why take breadfruit to Jamaica? Cheap fodder for the slaves on the plantations there. Bananas are very expensive there these days. It lacks glory, William. Well I don't have your connections, you see Fletcher. I want to make a name for myself, before I'm too old. And this green grocery trip will make your name? Now look, we'll go around Cape Horn to Tahiti. We'll pick up the breadfruit then continue on through the Endeavour Straits around the Cape of Good Hope to Jamaica. And then back to England. We'll circumnavigate the globe. Yes, but why risk going round the Horn? Because it is the quicker route, Mr Fryer. Quicker if we strike the one week in a hundred when there isn't a storm raging. Oh. So you would have us go the long way? Around Africa and Australia. There and back. Avoid the Horn altogether. What conditions do the plants need? Warmth, light and water. I shall be giving up my cabin to them. We shall be like little pigs in a stye. Shan't we? No sir, we shall not. I run a healthy ship, Mr Fryer. I only say the Bounty's too small. We should have a frigate, not a chamber pot. Yes, and I should have promotion to Captain. But the Navy Board would not heed either request. See? Quickly now, children. Ah, my little ones. They've come to say goodnight. Oh, goodnight, goodnight. Off you go... Aren't you going to say goodnight to Mr Christian, Mr Fryer? Don't I get a kiss? Goodnight, young ladies. Goodnight, goodnight. William a toast. To circumnavigation. To circumnavigation. Circumnavigation. And your safe and speedy return. (Bligh) Yes. We set sail two days before Christmas, 23rd December 1787. Stand by to set the mainsail. What are you staring at me for? Aloft! Loose that mizzen topsail, lively. Remove some of these gussets! Back down in the rigging! Stand by, you crew gunners! Away, you crew gunners. Southwest by south. That's your course. Southwest by south. Aye aye sir. Right men! Food up! Come on. (Crew talking) What's the name of the cook? Lamb?! Hey, Lamb! I hope you got some lamb in that stew. Hey, is it true what they say about Tahiti? You mean the women. Do they really go around with no clothes on? All they wear is tattoos. In wonderful places. True? Cross my heart. Paradise. Hey! You're in my place, Quintel. Move yourself. Don't look at him. There'll be trouble. I said you're in my seat. - Piss off. - Bugger off. - What did you say? - Shut it, Churchill. You keep out of this. Look out, he's got a knife. Keep it quiet, Churchill. Keep it down, lads. Churchill! The King. The King. God bless him. To the ship. May she swim well. The ship. The men are very quiet. (Sounds of heavy thuds and timbers creaking) Charming tune. And a fine musician. We're lucky to have him. Yes. He is not there by chance, Mr Nelson. Having him there is good for morale. Dr. Huggen. Another glass? No thank you, sir. You're uncommonly abstemious tonight. Well, more men have died at sea from drink, disease and dirt than ever died by drowning. Depend upon it, gentlemen. I'm determined the Bounty shall not lose a single man. By heavens! I'll drink to that. Then came to one soft push. Then came the sweetest flower to find. - Striking a superior officer. - No I didn't. - It's a hanging offence, sir. - Sorry sir. Can't be helped. We shall all get to know each other pretty closely. I wonder what we shall find out. It depends how inquisitive we are, Mr Young. (Dog barking. Heavy thuds, noise of fighting) It doesn't sound quite right to me. Do you think someone had better go and look? (Singing) There is a ship and it sailed to sea. It's loaded deep. - Good evening, Mr Heywood. Good evening, Adams. Evening, Mr Adams, sir. Everything alright here? Couldn't be better, sir. My place. Stupid buggers. You watch your mouth too, old man. Don't old man me, Churchill. You haven't got a lucky face. Seasick, Mr Heywood, sir? Just leaving England. Oh. Home sick. - Feels you'll never see it again. - Don't say that, sir. It's bad luck. Sorry. Never been to sea before. Two months ago I was still at school. Never been to school meself. Oh. Can't even read. I can't steer a ship. Any fool can steer a ship, sir. It's just knowing where to take it. 23rd December 1787. The end of our first day at sea. Tot of rum, sir? No, thank you, no. Come on, sir. We don't cross the Equator every day. No. Thank you. No. Make sure Mr Heywood has some, though. OK. That'll do. Haul him in. Away. Coming up for sup, Mr Heywood. Sir Here you go sir. Have some of that. Have some of that, sir. Revive the spirit as they say. Have a sup of that. Go on. Get some of this muck down you. Well done, sir. Thank you, Quintel. Lieutenant Bligh, I have your log here before me. In it, there is the frequent entry of a single word: dancing. Can you explain that? I can, sir. A crew on a long voyage may easily fall into melancholy and violence. I believe this can be relieved by regular exercise. So for 20 minutes each day, I had the crew mustered and I had them dance. - Dance? - Yes. They danced. An activity they participated in wholeheartedly? I think so. Yes. And yet Mr Bligh, in your own log, you admit that this rather unorthodox form of exercise led to grave discontent. On one occasion only, sir. And not grave. Charlie. If you only had a frock on, I'd ask you for a dance. Get your knees up, Quintel. I'm doing my best, sir. Don't answer back. We're bloody sailors, not bloody dancers. Mr Christian. Mr Young. Put a gag on Quintel. It wasn't bloody me. Don't make it worse, Quintel. It wasn't him, sir. It was me. Come along, Mr Christian. You've got the wrong man, sir. Churchill said it was he who made the remark. Gag them both. Ah, Jesus Christ. - Do as he says, Mr Christian. - Sir! Fletcher. William, don't you think those men have been gagged there long enough? They were both guilty of an act of insubordination. I could have passed it off with a laugh and have done less harm. The Royal Navy is not a humorous institution, sir. And insubordination is no laughing matter. However, you may cut them loose, Mr Christian. But mind they appreciate the gravity of their offence. Thank you, sir. Captain's orders. Ah, yes. Sure. You can close your mouth. Or I'll put it back in. I hadn't expected this from the Horn. Do you think the weather will stay with us? Perhaps. It doesn't look much. Does it? No, it doesn't, sir. But I've seen the Horn when the waves were as high as three houses one on top of the other. I once saw six men washed overboard on one wave. Someone on this ship is very lucky. Mr Fryer! Close reef! Close reef, sir? Don't argue with me. Close reef. Close reef, Mr Cole. Stand by to close reef! All hands on deck! Move yourselves! Hurry along and take those sails in! Get further aloft! Hurry up, move yourselves! Get those sails in! Doesn't seem to like fair weather, does he? (Cole) Haul on that sheet! Get those sails in! Mr Fryer. I seem to have made a misjudgement. You don't make many, sir. Make sail. Make sail, Mr Cole. Aye, Aye, sir. Prepare to make sail! Let go sheets and tack! Square away! Get aloft! Someone! Mr Christian! Pull! Pull! Robert, mind those bloody pots! Robert, he's on fire! Someone douse him. We'll all be killed! All hands on deck! Close the hatches! Take the wheel, man. Steering to port side. (Continuing shouts of crew members) Man those pumps! Jamie, hold that board. Someone! Don't let go on the pumps! Somebody get a bloody hammer. Sir! Sir! Have the carpenter lash those things down, now! - We must turn back! - What? In my opinion, we should put about. In my opinion we should not, sir. We keep on our course. (Fryer) You'll never make it round the Horn. We must turn back. Mr Cole, Mr Cole! I want my opinion in the log, sir. Mr Cole, have that lashed down. And all the men on deck, now! I want my opinion in the log! Very well, Mr Fryer. If that's what you wish, you shall have it. The ship can't stand it The ship can stand it very well, Mr Fryer! And how long do you think the men can stand it? As long as the officers can stand it, Mr Fryer! Get these things tied down now. Valentine! Come with me, boy! Mr Bligh. How long did you attempt to round the Horn? 31 days. And how far did you travel in that time? 85 miles, sir. 85 miles in 31 days, Mr Bligh. You endangered your ship and your crew for 31 days in order to satisfy your ambition to circumnavigate the globe. My dearest Betsy, Only to you in this bitter moment can I reveal my heart. I have failed completely in my attempt to round Cape Horn and circumnavigate the globe. My doubts about Mr Fryer's commitment to our endeavour have been confirmed. Enter. - The men are assembled, sir. - Come in. Come in. I'm very sorry, William. Oh. It can't be helped. Come along. Lads! We will go about and run downwind for Africa and the Indian Ocean. - Mr Lamb! - Here Sir. As soon as we have put about it will be safe to light your galley fires again. Tonight I want as much hot mush as every man can eat. (Cole) Let's hear it for the Captain, lads! Hip-hip! Hooray! Hooray! However. However. We're still faced with a long hard voyage. I mean to make good use of every hour of sailing time. And to assist me in this, I'm replacing Mr Fryer with Mr Christian who will now act as executive second in command with the rank of Acting Second Lieutenant. Mr Fryer, come back here. Mr Fryer, sir! Come back here! You'll dismiss when I have done with you, sir. Do you hear me? - This is an outrage! - Mr Fryer. In all my years at sea... Your years at sea? Good Lord, man. If I had known your nature, I would not have accepted you as boson of a river barge. Must I suffer this before... You'll suffer my correction, whenever you're at fault, sir! What fault? Damn your eyes, man! You turned your back on me! - Oh, for that I apologize. - Very well. - But I protest. - You protest, do you? I am Master of The Bounty. And I am Commander, by law! I am the first. Do you understand? God damn your hide. And now you may dismiss, sir! - Mr Cole. - Sir. All hands on deck. If you please. Surely, Mr Bligh. It was unwise to replace a professional sailor like Mr Fryer with a relative novice? Fletcher Christian could hardly be called a novice, sir. The fact that he was a good friend of yours, was not of undue influence upon you? Let me know the intent of your question, Mr Greetham. We're trying to establish, Mr Bligh, how you came to lose your ship. I did not lose my ship, sir! It was taken from me by a gang of mutineers led by Fletcher Christian. The man you promoted. Yes. I promoted him because John Fryer was grossly inefficient. And he was also a coward. Fletcher Christian at least had courage. More, perhaps, than you ultimately found to be acceptable. Eh, Mr Bligh? Friday, October 10th. At half-past twelve today, James Valentine departed this life as a result of illness and fatigue sustained at Cape Horn. This after all my care of the men is surely a result of our drunken surgeon's neglect. Oh, God. By whose mercy the souls of all men rest. Bless these waters and absolve from sin he whose body we now confine to them. Eternal rest grant unto him. And may he rest in peace. Amen. Amen. Commit the body to the deep. At four o'clock, we buried Valentine with all the decency in our power. Twenty-five degrees. Thirty-six minutes. Land Ho! Land Ho! Where away? Dead ahead, sir. Stand by to fire the salute! Ready to fire the salute. Fire! Stand by for a second salute! Fire second salute! (Excited voices of natives and crew) Hey. I'll have her. Thank you. Quintel! Sorry sir. Have you ever seen a woman before? Keep your mind and your eyes on your work, man. Come on, get in line there. Oars! Prepare to toss oars. Toss oars. Toss your oars. Thank you. Hail, Capitan Bligh. Hail, King Tynah. Thank you, your Majesty. I bring you greetings from His Majesty, King George of England. How is the great Captain Cook? Captain Cook! He's well and he also sends his greetings. - He lives? - Yes. - He is my friend. - I know. Now you see. Ah! He gave me his picture. Yes. Some people say he was killed by the people of Hawaii. No, er... Captain Cook is very much alive. And, er, he's in good health, King Tynah. He's very much alive. As I said, he sends his greetings to you. And, er, he always talks of you as his very close friend. You told that to this man... Tynah? King Tynah, sir. A savage King. A King, my lord. Descended from many Kings. As our King George is descended from many Kings. Yes, in a way, sir. Then why did you lie to him? Why did you not tell him Captain Cook was murdered in Hawaii 10 years before? Because they believe that Captain Cook is immortal. Literally? They seem to regard his likeness as a sacred image. Interesting. They also believe that every British officer is more or less related to him. So you were more or less immortal too. It would appear so, sir. And-um - I also needed their assistance. Captain Cook was our guarantor. How long you stay in Tahiti? About two months. Round about the islands. Stay here. Do not go to the other islands. No welcome there for you. Everything you need is here. I'm much obliged to you. His Majesty King George has sent you many gifts, King Tynah. Perhaps I could carry back in return. Gifts from yourself to His Majesty King George. Anything for a King. Pigs. Bananas. Coconuts. Breadfruit. Breadfruit. Breadfruit's a very good idea. Yes, breadfruit. I think His Majesty likes breadfruit. Isn't that true Mr Nelson? Indeed it is, sir. His Majesty is a very keen gardener. He would appreciate breadfruit greatly. If you were to send him little breadfruit plants. He could grow them in his own garden. We shall grow him many little plants. Thank you. - Mr Christian. - Sir. Mr Cole. Would you distribute the gifts to King Tynah and his good people. These are gifts from His Majesty King George of England to yourselves. Sir. Take it away, Mr Cole. Oh, dear God. - I hoped to avoid this. - Avoid what, sir? Dammit all man, I'm expected to sleep with her. She's one of King Tynah's wives. A gift from one chief to another as it were. Now look, five minutes after I go below, you must call me up on some important business. Alright? Yes sir. What business? Business, dammit. Any bloody business. Welcome aboard, Ma'am. Yes. Get on with your work. She should soften the old man up a bit. Hot. Enter. Excuse me, sir. I... - Mr Christian. - Sir. What demands my immediate attention? It could wait until tomorrow. What is it? Damn you. The ship is sinking, sir. Good. Ma'am. (Greetham) Was Fletcher Christian at this time still your friend and ally? At that time, yes. There was no indication of any resentment towards you? No. None. Mr Bligh. When you planted out your breadfruit, did not the savages carry out some sort of ceremony? An indecent ceremony? Is this relevant, Captain Greetham? My Lord, if the crew were allowed to witness it, yes. Were the crew present, Mr Bligh? Yes. And was it indecent? It is their deep belief that the earth is rendered fruitful by the coupling of their Gods. And that the Gods can be roused by the coupling of men and women. (Sounds of drums and native chanting) So it did begin at the ceremony? No sir. Not at the ceremony. No, it was Fletcher Christian and the native girl. You misunderstood the depth of the emotion between them? Yes. I realise that now. I had assumed that it was simply youthful passion. It takes more than an infatuated youth to make a mutiny. It takes a discontented crew. The crew were anything but discontented, sir. Fletcher Christian corrupted them. Yes, but what made them so easy to corrupt? I don't know. It was the place itself. (Sounds of native girls laughing and chattering) Come here. Mr, Christian. Come in, whoever you are. Faya! Captain Bligh's surprised that he hasn't had the pleasure of your company at supper for some weeks. Do you still do that? And the Captain says he'll expect you this evening. Today. Today's not Friday. Six o'clock. Prompt, if you please. Areya. Wait, Dr Huggen. I found the most extraordinary plant today. On the west side of the island. Just by the mouth of the river. Mr Christian, it is half past seven. Well, you didn't wait for me. I hope. May I ask why you have come to my table in a state of undress? Well, I couldn't wear the jacket. The tattoo's too painful. Good God. Put on your jacket, Mr Christian. It's very painful, sir. Put on your jacket, Mr Christian. If you please. - May I serve now? - Wait! Thank you, Mr Christian. Very well Smith, you may serve now. Thank you sir. - Mr Nelson. - Sir. When did you last inspect the breadfruit plants? Yesterday, sir. Not today? No sir. Mr Christian said a daily inspection was not necessary. Oh, did he indeed? Well, Mr Christian. And when do you think they will be ready to transport in your opinion? They'll be some time yet, sir. We've already been here thirteen weeks longer than we intended. Will we never leave this place? Because we arrived so late. The plants... I want to be advised of their progress every day, Mr Christian. Unless you need the time to cover the rest of your body in pretty pictures. Wait! The sooner we are seamen again the better. Don't you agree, gentlemen? Now perhaps you will join me in prayer. Oh Lord, our heavenly father. Almighty and everlasting God. Most humbly do we thank thee for what we're about to receive. It won't be long now lads. You'll all be on your way home. You're not coming? I fancy having a look at a few of the other islands around here. They'll hang you for desertion. Only if we're caught. You with us, John? No. I've got a wife and three kids back home. There he goes. Mr Bligh and bloody mighty. How do you fancy the Endeavour Straits? The Indian Ocean? The South Atlantic? The North Atlantic? Nothing but rotten biscuits and pork. And his bloody lordship on your back morning, noon and night. Not me lads. Not me. When do we go then? Who's officer of the watch tonight? I am. Yeah? Yes. Well that's it, then. Hey, Fletcher Christian. Harami. Maieva. Harahai. Thank you. You wanted to see me, sir? My daughter... She has something of yours. Of mine? You are here now. Tamari. Well, I'm sorry, sir, I... Take this tusk. When you see it, you'll remember my daughter and my grandchild. You will never forget Tahiti. Fletcher Christian. Your wife. - Think we should go as well? - No, I do not. Mr Heywood's going to have to answer for this, you know. Poor Heywood. Hey, you bloody fools. The Hottentots out there aren't as friendly as these ones, you know. Yeah. Come on lads. Good luck to them that's what I say. They'll need it. All hands. Thank you, Mr Fryer. Last night. Three men of Mr Heywood's watch deserted ship. The penalty for which is death by hanging. Mr Heywood, how is it you did not see them? Were you asleep? Yes sir. Very well. You shall kiss the gunner's daughter. - Bosun. - Sir. Put this man over the cannon. Do it now! Aye, aye, sir. Now listen to me, all of you. In one week's time... Hiya! Stop that laughing! Silence! You think this is funny? You're a pitiful sight, Dr. Huggen. Go below to your quarters... You think this is a humorous occasion. You are mistaken. From now on there's going to be discipline on this ship. We're going to have order. And we're going to be like seamen. In one week's time we will put to sea. There will be no more grog. There will be no more shore leave. You've become a rabble, all of you. And you will clean up this ship and yourselves. - Bosun. - Sir! Administer the punishment now. Capitan Bligh. Mr Christian! Mr Christian, sir. Sir! I wish to talk to you outside. Now! Coming sir. Thank you. Is there anything wrong, sir? Yes. Last night while the mate of the watch was asleep, three... Stop that noise! Fiya! Three men jumped ship last night. Churchill was one of them. You don't seem surprised? Now that it's happened, no. No, I'm not surprised. I must say I'm no longer surprised myself when I see the example being set by my first officer. Just look at yourself, man. Look at the way you're dressed. Come on. You're no better than one of these natives. At least I am no worse. I think your brain has been overheated, sir. And your body overindulged in sexual excess. I have done no more than any natural man would do. No. You have done no more than any wild animal would do. It always makes me laugh, but when men lose their self-restraint they say they're natural. They are more natural than men who have nothing to restrain. Mr Christian, you will report to the ship before sundown. Is that understood? No. No. What did you say? You said no. Is that what you said? Is that what you said? No. Alright. You will report to the ship immediately. Do you understand me? And you will stay on ship. There will be no more mixing with the degenerate natives of these islands. By any of my officers. Or by any of my crew. You comprehend my meaning, sir? Good. (Crew member) Keep em' coming. Move it along. Don't drop them. Come on, Purcell. Remember that's what we're here for. And the next one please. Come on. Keep them coming. Good lads. Alright. Where are they? I don't know yet, sir. We'll find them. Damn fools. Don't make it worse for yourself. Stand up. Stand up! He can't, sir. Bit of trouble with the locals out there. You know the penalty for desertion, mister? We came back of our own accord, sir. You're a mindless animal, Churchill. I will decide your punishment when you're fit to receive it. Mr Cole! Get Dr Huggen. Aye, aye, sir. Sir. Over here. Is he dead? Yes sir. Poor bugger. Alright, bury him. Will you organise that please, Mr Cole? Fletcher. I've come to say good-bye. You do not come back. Do you? Ever? - I must go now. - No. Not yet. Soon. Eyes front, Mr Christian! Off hats. Take the men below. - Make sail, Mr Fryer. - Aye, sir. Stand aside. Stand down. Stand down! Come on, lads. No sense in this. Well, gentlemen, between ourselves and home are 27,000 sea miles, the Endeavour Straits and the Great Barrier Reef. Now the crew is deeply demoralised, gentlemen. And I must accept, as every captain must accept, the inevitable and theoretical responsibilty for that. The actual and immediate responsibilty, however, I place on you, my fellow officers, who met this crisis with lethargy, impudence and flagrant defiance publicly uttered. And perhaps also for that, I am to blame. I counted on a strength of character which you do not possess. However, the cure for our predicament is discipline. And I shall apply it with an even hand, of course, but most where it is most required. Yes, well that will be all. Thank you. You may leave now. Not you, Mr Christian. Leave it. Now! Alright, Smith, you may go and close the door, please. So. You think I'm harsh with you, eh? Look, I've been at sea many years, Fletcher. Since I was twelve. And I have seen many men, many good men, Iose their heads over native women in these waters. And I've never yet seen it come out well. Of course I understand the excitement and... um. But think to yourself, man. Could you take a woman like that back home to your friends and family? No, of course you couldn't. They're not like us, Fletcher. You think I was harsh with you. But you needed someone to show you where your duty really lay. Because you were at a loss, my friend. You may not thank me now but you will later. So, let's get the ship running properly and get back to where we were before. Now look, Fletcher. Listen to me. I am prepared to forgive and I am prepared to forget. Do you understand me? Will that be all sir? - Yes, that will be all. - Thank you. You sent for me, sir? Yes I did. This ship is filthy, Mr Christian. Sir? The ship is filthy, Mr Christian! Look for yourself. Look! Filthy, sir! Filth there! And there! And there! Look at there! I understand you dismissed the swabbing party. You left these decks crusted with grime. Look at it there! Bloody disgrace. Now you'll be well advised, sir, to call them back again and this time do it properly. Do you understand me? Filth Sir! Filthy Mr Christian. Still filthy! Look! I see nothing, sir, but your finger. I'll not have your vile ways brought aboard my ship, sir! Do you understand? Now you'll call up the swabbing party, yet again! And this time you'll make bloody sure that the decks are clean! Or by God you'll answer for it sir! I'll not have any of your filthy gutter ways on board my ship! Do you understand? Pigs in a sty have more comprehension or cleanliness than you buggers have. Now you'll get these decks clean or by God I'll make you lick them clean with your tongues if you don't mend your ways. There is a thief among us. Yes, there is a thief on board this ship, which is unfortunate because you know what hardship that means for honest men. Last night, my personal store of coconuts was well up to the top of the netting. This morning, I - Well I mean look for yourselves. See. Now if the thief will declare himself, I will punish him alone. And then we can forget the matter. Sir. Hold your tongue, Goddamn you sir! I'm addressing the crew, Mr Christian. Who do you think you are? Now if the thief will not declare himself. I took one. You? I was thirsty. I took one of your coconuts. I thought it of no consequence. One coconut, Mr Christian? A dozen were taken, man. I know nothing of a dozen. Then, unless you're a liar as well as a thief, the rest were taken by other members of your watch who look to you for their example do they not, sir? - Mr Cole. - Sir. Impound the personal stores of every man on Mr Christian's watch and put them on half rations. - Aye, aye, sir. - Thank you. Stand down. That isn' t a raft, it's a coffin. There's a five-knot current running between here and that island. I'll take my chance. You think a lot of us haven't thought of this? You're not the only one to have left a woman behind. Fletcher, the men are ready for anything. What are you saying, Ned? Are you inciting me to mutiny? If I were you, I'd take the ship. That's all. Why don't you, then? I said if I were you. I'm not. What I have to say to you is the result of considerable reflection. Its consequences would be two-fold. Firstly, our journey will be shortened. Which I know is a consideration that cannot distress you. And secondly, upon its successful conclusion not one of you in later years will look back without a surge of pride. We shall go with the winds to Jamaica by way of Cape Horn. You'll kill us all. What did you say, Adams? We tried the Horn before. It was almost the end of us. Damn you, man. Don't you bloody cross me. Mr Cole, take this man below. And tomorrow we will assemble to watch him receive punishment for cowardice and insubordination. Mr Cole. Take him below, sir! You, Mr Fryer. Give him the makings. Sir. Now. We set out to circumnavigate the globe. And by God we shall do it. To the greater glory of us all. Is that understood? Thank you. Now you may dismiss. Enter. - Can I have a word with you? - I'm busy. Is it important? I think, yes. Be brief! William, about your decision to go around the Horn. William? Not sir? Not captain? William. I don't think the men will have it. Oh, the men won't have it. Are they in charge of the Bounty? They might be if you insist. Again. Will you repeat that, please? The men might be in charge. What are you threatening me with? It's not a threat, it's a warning. Oh. There are rumblings, are there? No. There is fear. Around the Horn is the easiest way. The better way. And that is how we will go. Anything more? Don't put Adams under the lash. He was insubordinate. Cowardly and insubordinate. He frightened the men. I did not put that fear there, he did. So he will be lashed and we will go around the Horn. Are you frightened to go around the Horn, Mr Christian? Are you a coward too, sir? There will be no killing. Except Bligh. There will be no killing. We set him adrift. Hi. Christian's taking the ship. Are you with us? (Seaman) Come on, wake up. We're taking the ship. - Wake up. - Mmm. - Wake up! - Whaa! Shut up. Christian's taking the ship. Christian's taking the ship. We're taking the ship. Are you with us? Come on. Come on, Fryer. Wake up! Get up! Come on, Fryer! Mr Bligh. Will you get up? Get up. Get up! On your feet. What the hell do you think you're doing? Tie him. What are you doing? Mr Cole! Mr Cole! Come on, get up on deck. Mr Cole! You'll hang, for this. Mr Nelson. We've taken the ship. We've taken the ship. (Seaman) We've taken the ship. We've got Bligh. Get on deck. Dance. Dance. Easy. Dance. Dance. You shut up. Dance. Dance. Come on. Get going. You're a fool, Quintel. You'll hang for this. - Are you in this, Norton? - No, sir I'm not. Shut up your trap! Desist this madness! Be quiet! Have you any conception of what you're doing? Just shut your mouth! Are you in this, Adams? It's all you fault. There was never a coward on this ship! You're a coward, sir! And that was your mistake! You're a blackhearted villian, sir! Pritchard, get over here. Stay there, Pritchard. Stay Pritchard, you're a man. Get over then. Allison, get over here! Shut up. I'm staying here. Let's kill the bugger now, lads. I said leave him! You sodding bastards! You take you hands off him! Let's kill him. Take your hands off him, now! Kill him! Get your hands off him. Now! Mr Christian, I appeal to you sir. Put aside this madness and it will be forgotten. I give you my word. It's too late. Think of my family and my friendship. Think of my wife. I am in hell. Hell, sir! Why are you being so damn reasonable, now? God damn your blood to hell with mine, sir! God damn your blood! Mr Christian, get a hold of yourself! You be quiet or I will run you through. Do it, Christian. Kill him! Just shut your mouth! Shut your mouth! I will run you through! And then I will kill myself after. You get him dressed now. Get him dressed! Bastard! What's the matter with you all? You be quiet! Gun him down, damn you! They're common criminals. Get out of it, Cole! You will be silent or I will have you killed! You bastard! You do and you will have my blood on your hands. Stop! Quiet! We will get him in the boat. Set him adrift. Get him dressed! Will someone give me my britches? Pass us your watch up here then. Come on, move yourselves. You blackguard! Traitors! Mr Bligh, come here, please. If you wish to leave some of these men on the ship, I give you my word they will not be harmed. Lads. One of you will have to come out. There's no room. Mr Fryer, you come up here. (Seaman) We'll do without him. We don't want you. Mr Fryer. Get up here. Stay where you are. Or I'll blow your head off. God damn you! You're the scum of the earth! Fulman. Get up here. Come on, Fulman. Move yourself. Faster, man. It will be fairly reported that you were not part of this rabble. Thank you. Smith bring that chest to me. Do it now. Get in the boat. What use is that without charts? I need the charts. Turn around. You really think you'll be able to command this rabble? I'll do my best. Well, I did my best and I had the authority of the law. You're a dead man, Fletcher. That's enough of that. Get on the boat, sir. Quickly. You've not seen the last of me, Ned Young. Take my word for it. Thank you, Mr Lamb. Or you, John Adams. You've not seen the last of me. - I wouldn't wager on it. - We shall see, sir. I'll see you hanged. Veer them away. - Did you bring anything, Smith? - Yeah I got a carpent... Veer them away... (Cole) Get ready, boys. Get the oars out. Sorry to see you go. Isn't this what you came for? Here you go. (Cheers and jeers from the mutineers) (Mutineer) Goodbye, boys. Hope I never see you again. If you get home, tell my mother that I love her. She's got a lovely little Tahitian grandson. Have a long ride, Tim. I hope they bloody eat yer, Fryer. (Bligh's voice over) I hope never to see Fletcher Christian again. Unless it is to see him hanged. How could he betray my friendship and kindness to him? I can only assume he has decided to return to a life in Tahiti. After taking stock of the meagre provisions allowed us, I have decided to make for the island of Tafuha in the hope of supplementing our supplies of food and water. By now, there are many natives about us. And by their manner, we do not expect our welcome to last much longer. - Mr Cole? - Sir. You take charge of my log... and slowly make your way out to the launch. - Easy, Mr Cole. - Aye, aye, sir. Go now? Now. That's right. You give me no summer, my boys. Nasty bugger. Come on lads. Get in the boat! Lose that barrel. Stop playing games. Is that what you want? Everybody in the boat! Prepare to pull away! Mr Bligh. Where's the captain? Where's Mr Bligh? Over there. Come on then. Norton come back. You fool. Mr Bligh! What are you doing? Get aboard, sir! Mr Bligh. Get back, you bastards! Keep back, you bastards! I'll have your eyes for footballs! Get back in the boat! Help the man. Get in the boat, sir. My God, no! Row for your lives! Take your clothes off. Throw your clothes over! Bloody savages! We're chops and liver to them if they catch us. That's the spirit. Come on, we'll do it. We cannot risk going ashore again. What are we going to do, sir? Well, we shall just have to try and reach Coupang. Without charts? Well, I shall have to navigate from memory, Mr Fryer. It'll take us close to the most savage islands in these waters. The Fiji islands where cannibalism is perfected almost to a science. And from there, my friends, God willing, we shall proceed onward to the Great Barrier Reef itself. Then to the coast of New Holland and from there across the Timor Sea to Coupang. Now it will take us at least two months and we have provisions or more enough to last us one week. So that is the situation, gentlemen. Plain and simple. Well, we'll just have to make the best of it. Won't we sir? Make the best of it, Smith? Yes, but will you? That's what I ask myself. Will you make the best of it? Do you hear me? Are you prepared to make the best of it? All of you? Because all I can promise you, lads, is relentless pain and hardship. Now, if you're prepared to make do and make sacrifices and furthermore are willing to swear by it, I promise you our chances of survival are fair. You hear me? You all say, aye. Aye. Good. Mr Fryer, make way. Prepare to make way. Make way. (Bligh and crew sing a sea shanty) Fletcher! Fletcher! In the box are gifts for the people of Tahiti. We did not expect you back. We have already given you everything. We only want our women. And perhaps some men to help me sail the ship. Where's Captain Bligh? Why doesn't he come himself? He's no longer with us. I've taken the ship. He's dead. No. No, he's not dead. We set him adrift with some of the crew. You shame me by coming here. You shame me. King George will send many ships with many guns to punish us for what you have done. We can give you nothing. Go now. Some of the men would like to remain here and wait for the next ship. Er, they wanted to go with Bligh but there was no room in his boat. (Chief and advisor speaks in native dialect) They can stay, but not you. Take your gifts and go. No! Should she not be allowed to choose for herself, sir? Ah. (Chief 's daughter speaks in native tongue) Where will you take her? I don't know. Somewhere the British ships won't find us. Take her. You will have all the men you need. Go now. Goodbye, Peter. Good luck, sir. I think you'll need it more than I. Thank you. I'm not coming, Fletcher. I've thought it out. And I'm staying here. Let's go. I think I'll stay too, sir. Get out. Let's go. Come on lads. They'll hang you. I might just have a lucky face. Here they come. Get it. Good one. Loads of them. They're all over the place. Here we go. There we go. Go on. Sod it. Who loaded these things? Come on, man. Quick. Yeah! The only one I wholly trust is Adams. I go everywhere with a loaded pistol. And where we are to head beyond the reach of justice, I know not. Thursday June 11th. In the afternoon we saw gannets and many other birds. And at sunset we caught one in our sail. Which I reserved for our dinner next day. Who shall have this? Smith. And who shall have this? Mr Fryer. What about the rest of us? You just have to wait your turn, Purcell, like everyone else. Some of us haven't had nothing in days. That's enough, Purcell. Well, it's not enough for me, sir! I'll tell you something. The officers and their lot get everything. Shut your mouth, Purcell. I'm as much a man as you are, sir. What did you say? I said I'm as much a man as you are! Are you indeed? I'm not so certain about that. Sit down, damn you! I'll knock you on the head with it. Sit down! Sit down! Mr Cole, give this man my share of food. (Christian's voice over) I am committed to a desperate enterprise. I have said farewell to everything I've been accustomed to regard as indispensable. But I suppose I have found freedom. So you've found freedom, have you? Freedom, retribution, that's what you want. Isn't that why you gave him your compass? I wanted to give him a chance. A chance to survive so he'll come after us again. How can he come after us? He'll be marooned on some island. I only wish to God I'd given him muskets. Now get out. (Christian's voice over) At least ten times we have touched land. Only to find either barren rocks or hostile inhabitants. And once nearly ran a foul of an English frigate. Our stores are low. The spirit of the men, even lower. His royal highness woken up at last, has he? Given you a rest, has he, darling? Fletcher wants you. Ned, I found it. Listen. Where is it? July 2nd, we discovered an island, seeming uninhabited. It was well timbered. But we did not linger for we could find no anchorage. That's perfect. Every ship in the Royal Navy has a copy of that book and those charts. They never drew it on the charts. All they give is a latitude, 25 degrees south. Now it seems to me, all we have to do is simply sail along this line of latitude. We'll find the island. Somewhere. And if we don't? These men need a home, Fletcher. They've mutinied once. Oh, they'll have a home. Pitcairn's Island. They'd better. (Bligh's voice over) I can no longer write for lack of strength. Commend me to your parents and our loving daughters. Mr Bligh, when my spirit is gone, there will be nothing but flesh remaining. I beg you use that poor flesh to save the others. No, no, Mr Nelson. We're civilised men not savages. And as civilised men we shall die. Have no fear. Sir, we'd like a word. We've had it up to here. There is no island. We want to turn back to Tahiti. And who'll navigate? You. You're the navigator. I'll navigate. This ship's going to Pitcairn's Island. Sir! Sir! Smith. It's land. - What? - I think it's land. Mr Cole, you'll hoist the Jack. It's not proper to land without identification. Oh. God. Sir. I am Lieutenant William Bligh. I'm a British naval officer and I have to report an act of piracy. We've found it. We've found it, Ned. It's our island. (Cries of excitement from mutineers and natives) We could easily have missed it. Yes. We'll never get off this island now, will we sir? Never see England again. This court finds that the seizure of His Majesty's armed vessel, Bounty, was an act of mutiny by Fletcher Christian and others of her crew. And that her captain, Lieutenant William Bligh, is in the opinion of this court, to be exonerated of all blame on this occasion. Indeed, in the matter of his command of the Bounty's open launch, we commend Lieutenant Bligh for his courage and exemplary seamanship. Will you please come forward Lieutenant? My Lord. Thank you. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, All right. Pack her up there. Hey, Sandy, Put on a straight line, will ya. Come on, Alec, get off that lard. What do you think this is?

I've drunk everything from bug juice to rotgut. I got it off a fellow outside the 12 mile limit. - Ivan Novich. You know him. - Oh the Russian. Yeah. How much is it gonna set me back? $10 for the 6 bottles. - TEN BUCKS? - Yes. I'd kill a Russian for ten bucks. Ten bucks, why? Why don't you go 50/50? You'll swill most of it down. Now ain't that gratitude? After me boarding with you for years and paying my rent every week. Well, you ain't sore, are you, Bill? Yeah. Well no, I'm not so sore now. You go up to the hotel. I'll be up in a minute and we'll crack one of those bottles. - You old hooliver. - I'll be right up. Brush up on your minute tour gulf. Come on, let's get these fish off of here. What do you think this is, a holiday, Alec? - Come on, gang, I'll see you later. - Okay, Min. - Hey, where's Nancy? - She's upstairs. Weird. - Hey, Nancy? - I'm coming. Why do you always hang around upstairs for? They're fumigating the bed. Fumigating the bed again. Min, a couple things. That cop was here again. You can go belly-aching around after all I done for you? Honestly, I didn't see. I told them you've always been good to me. Yeah, now cut out the applesauce. Just what did you say? Well, I told them that my mother I left me here when I was a baby. And that you'd brought me up. And I helped you with the work. - That you've always been good to me. - Oh that's all right. Did they say anything about taking you away from me? Yes, he did. Well? What did you say? I said I couldn't stand to be taken away from you. You ain't lying? Honest, Min, I ain't. I swear it. Yes. Oh well, go on. Take that fish in the kitchen. Hey! He didn't say nothing about coming back, did he? I said he didn't say nothing about coming back. Oh no. No. All right, get out of here. Go on, go on. Well, Nancy. Ain't you gonna say hello to me? What for, Alec? Any mail for me? Not a chance. That blonde forgot about you long ago. Maybe I could do with a brunette for a change.. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Did you miss me? Who are you kidding? - Nobody. - Oh yeah? Come on, Nancy, don't be stingy. Let me go. I've got work to do. What was he saying to you? Oh. He was only kidding. Alec's like that. Aw, he didn't mean nothing. Sticking up for him, huh? I want to tell you something. Any time he comes here and he says to you... Hey Min! Come on out here. I'm wait for a shave. Go on. Finish your work. Come on, Min. Will ya? Come on, quit your poking around. I want to get a shave. Get out here. Oh yes. What's eating on you? Fleas. Besides that? Well... Alec's been making eyes at Nancy. The way you worry about her, you'd think she's your own kid. Sometimes I wish she was. Don't go feeling sorry for yourself. So you give me a pain in the neck. Yeah, you ain't so hot yourself. When I was young, I used to make them sizzle. Back in the Civil War days, they were not so particular. What's that about the Civil War days? Aw, Min! Did you ever hear the story about the old Civil War veteran? Yes. Now pike pike now when I was a kid. You get out of here! All ears. - Say, uh- - I don't want to hear it now. Hey handsome, how are you? Well, how are you? I'm fine. Hey, there. What are you doing up there? Cut that out! You don't you watch what you're doing? Aw, gee, I didn't do it on purpose. Oh no. Of course not. Hey, you ain't so special. I oughta give you my bucket too. Yeah, you do and you'll be sorry. - Oh yeah? - Yeah! Any more gab out of you and I'll have a go. Hey, what's the matter? What's the problem? What's wrong? - He's a liar. - Who's a liar? Why? I just dumped some trash overboard and he said I did it on purpose. You can't call her no liar. I won't let you. She just threw a bucket at me. I did not. If you don't like it around here, you get out! See? I'm running a decent joint. I don't go for you boys chasing around here at all. Get out of here! Now go. Min, what's the matter? He calls her a liar. He insults me. I want him off the place. Calm down. Listen. That's old man Cameron's son. He runs the cannery over there where I work. I don't give an abalone if he runs the jail. And he can't park his putt putt under my pylons either. - Hey, where are you going now? - None of your business. Paying my taxes around here. I ain't gonna have nobody tell me what I'm going to do. Don't touch that water. You'll get in trouble! I pay my taxes. What are you doing in that boat? I'll gonna get this bucket. Get the bucket and come on out! Come out right now. I don't want anybody hanging around- Hey, stop it. Stop that motor. Help! Stop! Bill! Bill! Help!! Bill! Bill! You're trying to kill me. Rats! I'm dead. Hey, give us more speed! Help! Help! - Hello, Min. - Hello, Bill. How are you feeling now? Feeling? I ain't got no feeling. I'm numb all over. My neck is broke. - Your neck? - Yeah, my neck. - Let me get my big paws on it. - Wait a minute. - I won't hurt you, Min. - Well be careful. I'll be careful. You just hold still. Let me get a hold of you. Is that all right now? Ow, you got your big thing in my spherix! That's all right? How is your spine? My spine. It's never been better in this life. - Oh Bill, wait a minute. - I'm waiting now. Come on, I'm fine. - I'm fine, Bill. - Fix it all right? Yeah, you'll fix it. Yeah, I'm fine. Cut the cards and I'll tell your fortune. I'm fixed all right. I had a dream last night. About me, Min? No, about a canary flying in the window. - Oh you did. - Yes I did. Look it there. See all them spades. I tell you there's nothing but trouble around here. - Hey Min! - What is it? The cops! The cops? What do they want? - They are for me. - For you? They'll get your over my dead body. Min, pull in your horns. Cops is cops. Cops or no cops, they're not gonna take the kid away from me. Bill, I'm scared. Come out with me. What do you want? Groot's my name. I'm a truant officer. How long have you had this girl? Ever since she was six months old. Where did you get her? Her mother left her here. Where is her mother now? How do I know? She kicked the bucket. Reports come in this girl is terribly overworked. She don't work any harder than anyone else. That's the gospel truth I don't. The cook gets up at 4 o'clock. But I don't get up until 5. I suppose you finish your work about 9 o'clock at night. Sure I do. Sometimes 8:30. Oh. Of course. Or course. Well, that's why you don't go to school. I won't go back to school. I hate those stuck-up kids. They give me a pain in the neck. You've been kept from school. Come on, tell me the truth! Don't be afraid! You think I'd tell a lie to a cop? Shut up and answer this guy as if he was a gentleman. Yes, ma'am. A young girl like you needs schooling. A nicer environment. Discipline. You can't get that here. I do too. I don't walk a chalk line. Min wears the life out of me. Don't you, Min? That's discipline, ain't it? It certainly is. Another complaint is that you've been a party to the selling of liquor. - You mean booze? - Yeah. You think we'd give that bootleg stuff to the gang? Why we wouldn't give that to Bill! You've seen it around, haven't you? Sometimes. When some of the fellas brings him a flask. Then he breaks it over his head. That's just how sore it makes him. Say, you're not going to take this kid away from me? I think as much of her as if she was my own kid. I... who are you? Perhaps you remember me? I'm superintendent of Nancy's school. We were very much interested in her when she attended. I thought now that she's going back. You might let her come to our home. Mrs. Southard will be very kind to her. Can help a little in the household. It will be a nice quiet environment in which to study. I don't want to go. Now you shut up now. No, she ain't going. She's gonna stay right here with me. Get that? Right re with me! Of course, she can go to school though. I don't mind if she goes to school. Now you see that she's in school tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock. And if I have more complaints about this place, I'll see that it's closed up! Yes, yes. Gee that was a tight squeeze. I'm gonna wet my whistle. That was a swell lie I told about the booze, wasn't it? It sure was. I couldn't have done much better myself. Min, they can't take me from you. I would just die. Aw, cut the bull now. Go on out in the kitchen where you belong. Go on. Get out of here. What does it read? - All right. Hand it over. Nancy, how about a dance? Swell. Yeah, I'll take that too. Hey! You get out in the kitchen where you belong! Go on, get out of here. Go on! And Alec Johnson! You watch your step! Ohh! You come out here and I'll sock you in the jaw, Min. Is that so? Come on in here. I'd like to see you try it. You're a sneak. A sneaking thief. That's what you are. Gee Min, but you're a hellion. Yeah. I guess that's why I like you. Is that so? A bum. That's how you are. So that's where you keep your socks. You know it ain't safe. Some dirty skunk might peek through the keyhole some night. Is that so? Well, if he does, I'm ready for him. You trust me, don't you? Sure I trust you. You're too dumb to be anything but honest. That's the same way I feel about you, Min, too. Gee, it's hot in here. Open up a window or something. No Bill, nobody's gonna get my hard-earned dough from me. I've been over 40 years saving up them dimes and nickels. When I get enough, I'm going back to Seattle, where I come from. And I'm gonna buy myself a sealskin cap. Mm-hm. Yes and a new bridge with three gold teeth in them. - Min! - What? There's Alec with his arm around some gal. - It ain't Nanc is it? - I think he is. Don't whistle. Wait a minute. Gee, it's swell out here. You know, I love this old boat. I used to come here when I was a kid. I dreamed about going places. You'll be going places before long. And you won't be alone either. Who's gonna take me, you? You said it. We'll sneak away, me and you. And we'll go up to Frisco. Yeah? Fat chance I've got of getting anywhere. Hey you know Nancy, you're a lot prettier out here. That's gotta stop. You won't have to work anymore if you come with me. I know a way you can make a lot of money. Let me go. You smell like hot steam. Well? What's the idea? You get in the house! Go on! Get! Bill. Calm him down. What's the idea? Ain't Min asked you a dozen times to let that kid alone? Gee Min, I didn't do nothing. Go on. Get up there. Go on. I saw you fooling with Alec? Oh I didn't do nothing, Min. I washed dishes and cooked stuff all day long. Well, I'm crabbing about that. Girls got to have some fun. You call that fun? - He didn't mean nothing by it. - Hmm. That's what you think. I don't see why it ain't right for me to dance and flirt and have a good time like the rest of the girls who come here. - You don't? - You don't try to stop them. You tell them ""Go out and dance and have a good time in your joint."" But me. Well you ain't gonna have a say over me much longer. I'll be old enough to put makeup on and dance and drink with the gang if I want to. - Then I'll show you. - Yeah. You'll be showing me. That teacher and the cop was right. This is no place for a kid like you. What are you doing? You're not going to send me away, are you? You're gonna live with the school teacher. Don't do it, Min. I don't want to leave you. - Now you stop... - I'm sorry I made you sore. Stop squawking now. And go and pack your duds. I'll be a good kid, I swear it. Please don't send me away. No. I want to stay here with you. I'm sending you away because I don't want you to make me no trouble. I don't care nothing about you. Just me. Go on now. You ain't got no time to use. Now we ain't got no time to lose. Go on. - Don't send me away. - Now you listen to me. No. You may think she's no common kid. Oh no. Yeah, her father was a doctor in the Northwest someplace. And her mother brought her on here when he died. When she drifted in here, she was dying when she come to this place. Well, that's all there is. You see she ain't legally mine. So there won't be no papers to sign or nothing. But I'm just like your own kid. You can't send me away. Why this is a swell joint. Gee if you can't be happy here, you're dumber than I thought you was. Well, that's all there is to tell. I guess I'll beat it. Min! Min! Please! Go on away. I got my work to do. Min, please! Hello, Nancy, how are you? Fine, how are you, Captain? Fine. Can I fish? Sure. Help yourself. Gee, that's great. So you got homesick for us, did you? You're darn right, I did. That's why I'm back. Up easy. Did Min say so? I don't know. I stopped in to see her. They said she was at the grocery. But she'll let me stay when I explain. Yeah? Mm-hmm. That's a great fish, Nancy. Aw, gee! How did I do that? Oh, up to your old tricks again? Here's your cap. What you need is a darn good spanking. Is that the way you treat a lady? You're no gentleman! You big abalone. What's the matter with you? Come on in here! What's the matter with you? Say. Say. What are you doing here? Did you see what he did to me? Yes, I did. And that's what I ought to be doing to you. What are you doing back here, playing hooky? I can't stand it any longer, Min. I come back for good. You think you come back for good. You're gonna get right out of here and go right back to school. I can't go back, Min. - You can't? - No I-I- What have you done? - Uh... - Well. - I hit a girl in the eye. - Well? She called me wharf rat. Why didn't you give her- That's exactly what I did. That isn't here or there. You just go back to Southards where you belong. Now go on! Get out of here. Oh Min, I can't stand it at the Southards any longer. The evenings are so quiet. Gee, they don't ever have a fight. Don't get sore. It's just like a jail up there. Well... that's just what you're aiming to do. Send me to jail. What do you mean? I mean just what I say. If the cops don't find you're not at school, they'll take my license away. You're just an ungrateful little brat. That's what you are. Trying to ruin my business. Go on back to Southards where you belong. Go on, on, on. Go on now. Oh but let me explain. I'll explain. Will you get out of here? Go on now. Please. Give me just one more chance! I'll give you a chance. Get out of here. Go on now! And I never want to see you here again! Yeah. He did? That's funny. Hello Min. Hello, Min. Hello, Bella Pringle. What are you doing here? You know what I'm doing here. Come on upstairs to my room. Wait a minute. How long you been here? About an hour. Belle's my old friend of mine from Seattle. About 14 years since we've seen each other. Let's drink to old times. You said it. How long you gonna be here? Oh I don't know. Say. I thought maybe I'd look over the place. And get the lay of the land. Yeah. Stick around a bit. Oh get you. I don't mind, Bill. Ain't nothing doing around here. - Naw? - No. There's a boat going to Frisco this afternoon. Yeah? Who says I was leaving here this afternoon? Come on, Bill. Come on. Show us the bottom of the bottle. You're like a sieve, ain't you? Belle, come on upstairs to my room. Wait a minute. Will ya? Wait a minute. Here's to ya, big boy. You ain't so bad. I've seen worse. Yeah, I've been told that before. Hey Belle, I've got something to tell you. Come on upstairs. Come on. Pardon me. What are you doing here? You know what I'm doing here. - Where's my kid? - She's dead. - You're a liar! - Who's a liar? You're a liar. She died in Fresno five or six years ago. What she die of? You know she was a puny kid. That's right. - Tough luck for me, ain't it, Min? - Yeah. I thought that kid would take care of me in my old age. It's too bad. Come on Bella, take off your duds and rest a bit. You look all in. - I'm a wreck. - Yeah. Ain't it just like a kid? The more you do for them, the more ungrateful they are. I know. There ain't no gratitude in the world. There ain't nothing. No there ain't. That's right. - Nothing, I'm telling you. - All right, Belle. You just rest there a while. You'll be all right now. - Min? - What? Just one more little drink. You'll find them in the bureau drawer there. The last- I'll be back in a minute. Hi, baby. Hello, big boy. Come on in. How's chances for a little snort? I won't be difficult. Come on. Sit down. Make yourself at home. Here you are, kid. Ma'll kill you for it. What's the little thing, boy. Why don't you turn on something snappy? That's the way I always feel when I see a swell-looking guy like you. You mean that? And how! Wait, I'll turn on the phonograph. Make it snappy, baby. - Oh how do you do? - How do you do? I come to see Nancy. - Won't you sit down? - No. I can say what I got to say standing on my feet as well as I can sit- Min! You've came for me! Come for you? Nothing. Oh. - How do you do? - Hello. We're so grateful to you for sending Nancy home. We think she'll be much happier here as time goes on. Yeah I hope you're right. - Min, I... - Will you shut up? Say, her mother left some money for her with me. And I got it here and it's a big wad too. - Really? - Yes, it's real. I had intended to keep it myself. But every once in a while, my conscience goes crazy. And I have to do the right thing. Well anyhow... when she was dying, she says to me ""Min..."" ""when my Nancy grows up to be a girl, I want you to see that she goes to a young lady's school."" My mother said that? Will you stop horning in? When you gonna send her? Now speak up quick before you get the dough. I know a very fine school up north. The Westmoreland School. A friend of mine is head of it. That's the ticket. Here. You see that see goes quick too. Because she's never gonna get nothing hanging around here. Not that I give a hoop. Min, you've been so kind to me. Aw. Can the baloney, will ya? - Won't you say goodbye? - Goodbye. And you see that behave yourself the next joint you go to. You come on out here. I want to see you. I just want to tell you. Get that kid out of here before 24 hours or I'll take her back. - But why? - Never mind why. You just do it. All right. Why you dirty... What kind of a drunk? Get out of here! Hey Bill, wait! I'll get you for that! I'll get you someday! Bill, she's trying to kill me! Bill, help me. Min's trying to kill me! You filthy old wretch you. You dirty old rotten louse! Well. That's what I'll give you. I'll get you! You come back! You ain't mad at me, Min, are you? No, I ain't mad at you. We just had a couple snifters. And I got to feeling kind of wild. Cant you take a joke? You stupid dummkopf! Don't you talk to me. Stop your fooling, will you, Min! Oh now, Min! Now, now, ho, Min. No, Min. No, Min! There goes my mother's picture! Will you stop that? Min, will you stop that! Stop it, Min. Stop what? Come here. Come here! Min, you're pulling my pants off. Now stop that! Stop this, Min. Get this thing out of my eye, will you? Get your hands out of my- Don't call me a dummy. Stop that! I'm warning you. Stop it, will ya? Cut it out! Cheat with me, will ya? Hey, Min! Dog gone you anyway! Will you come here? Come here. Come here, you prick. Come here, you. Come on out here! Come on out here and finish this! Go on away from here, Min. And let me alone, will ya?! What you so quiet for, Min? You give up? Give up? Give up nothing. You come out! Aw, stop that, dear. Stop that, will ya? Stop it. Come out here and take your licks like a man. - Come on now! - Stop it! Give me that thing, will ya? Give me that ax. Give me the ax before you hurt yourself, Min! - Give me! - Give me that. You'll be sorry! Dog gone you anyway. I don't bite my arm! Stop! Now stop that, Min! Min now mad. Bill, you ain't hurt? Be ya? Are you hurt, Bill? Oh, gee. You made me so sore. Bill! Dear Min, I'll be home soon. And I do hope you changed your mind about seeing me. Last Christmas they told me you had gone away. And the day I was leaving, I saw you on the wharf. Bill, she seen me on the wharf. You couldnt hide that face of yours with a beard. It'd break my heart if I thought I'd done anything to hurt your feelings. After all your kindness to me. Do you realize it's over two years since we've seen each other? I'm so grown up, you wouldn't know me. Bill, she's grown up. Sure, she is. Why not? Do remember Dick Cameron? I'll tell you a secret. We're coming home on the same boat. Oh Min, he's wonderful. I'll tell you all about him if you'll only see me. - Say hello to Bill for me. - Hello. We're coming on the HS Alexandria. With love and kisses, Nancy. Bill, when does the Alexandria get in? It docks in the morning. The morning. Oh don't go blubbering around. Too windy? Let's get married as soon as we get home. Dick, I'd love to have Min come to the wedding. Of course we'll ask her. But I think she'll won't come. I do. If I beg her to. She doesn't care for you very much, does she? Oh yes she does. Then why doesn't she want to see you? I don't know. But I'll see her tomorrow. And I know she'll be happy when I tell her... What's the excitement? I'm sorry but gentlemen are not allowed in the ladies' cabins. Oh. That's a lie. There is no gentleman in my stateroom. Besides, he ain't no gentleman. Oh, it's snooty time. We're not good for you. You remember Dick. Yes, I'm happy to see you. How do you do? Where's my grip? My valise. - Hello Bella. - Hello, old rigamathing. What are you doing here? I just thought I'd look the old place over. Are you coming down to the joint? No. Not a chance. Aw, come on. Let bygones be bygones. I wouldn't be a bit surprised. Min pays. A nice kid came in this morning. - She did? - Sure, come on. Come on, Bella. You go right upstairs. Hey Min. You ain't gonna give me another sendoff like you done a couple years ago. Oh no. Everything's all right now, Bella. Where is that big bozo? I don't know where he goes. Hey, you. Come on back! We're all friends again. Yeah, we're all washed up, Bill. All right. Hey, listen you. You never saw me before in all your life. I don't even know you. Hi, you big hippo. As far as I'm concerned, you just stink. Yeah? Yeah. Aw, Min. You can't guess who I just saw down at the dock. She had clean ears and... What are you laughing, you hyena? Was I laughing? Maybe I was thinking about something funny. Okay, Min. Hey, Min? Hey, what? Where is that hair tonic? You drank it. Oh, so I did. Min, come here a minute. Aw, what do you want? The back of my hair needs touching up a bit. What it needs is a couple of fine tooth combs. If you find any gray hairs, pull them out. - Yeah. - Oww! If I pulled them all out, you'd be bald as an egg. A bad egg. That's me all right. What's the matter, got the dropsy? Oh say, Bella. I got fine tonic down in the barbershop. I'll bring it right up. You wait here. Don't you think you'd better see her alone? Maybe I had. I won't be long. Min, darling. What are you doing here? Didn't you get my letter? Yeah I got your letter. What of it? Well, I wanted to tell you about... If you want to tell me anything, you come on in the barbershop. Go on. Well... Shoot. Get it off your chest. Min, I'm going to be married. To Dick Cameron. And we want you to come and live with us. I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, Min. We're going to live in Boston. - In Boston? - Yes. He's going to have part of his father's cannerys. - Oh Min. - Yeah. We're going to have a sweet home. With green terraces and gardens. And a beautiful orchid room for you. With windows that look right out on the sea. And I'd be at home in a trellis in an orchid room. Dick's going to give you a limousine for a wedding present. What is lemonzine? One of those lovely motor cars. Oh, automobile. Think of it. Can't you see us? You and me... staying in a home with our noses in the air. Oh it's just like a dream. A dream... Say. Now I want you to get this right under your bonnet. I ain't gonna never leave this joint. And I ain't never gonna live on charity. Oh, Min. I didn't mean it that way. You misunderstood me. Well, understand this then. You go live your life and please let me live mine! Charity! But Min, Dick wants you. Yeah? Now you go! Get out of here! Ohh. So it's the snooty girl that I met on the boat, huh? How do you do, dearie? Min, you were so long getting that hair tonic I thought for goodness you were drinking it. Say, Bella, what do you say you and me open a real bottle just for the sake of old times? Baby, you're an elk. That's right. What's the matter, Nancy? She never wants to see me again. What happened? I tried to tell her what we wanted to do for her. Oh, Dick! She just doesn't care anymore. That's all right, honey. I do. We'll forget all about her. Going down the coast, Bill? Yeah, going down off Mexico. The tuna's running down off Magdalena. How soon you shoving off? About a half hour. Gee ain't she a pip? Yeah. That's Cameron's boat. Young Cameron is gonna get married today. They're going east in it. Yes, Min was telling me. She sure is a beaut. Now cut them three times towards you. - All right. - That's it. Keep your shirt on. Yeah. Little nervous today, ain't you? Oh there you go. Bellla? - Yes? - King of diamonds! - You're gonna meet a rich guy. - Ha! Gee, Min. You're a pain in the eye to me. That's over. Yes, sir, it is. - Say, Bella. - Yes? Come on back here. You're gonna wear diamonds. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I wouldn't be a bit surprised. - Mm-hm. Say, Min. Where's a curling iron? What for? What do you suppose what for? To pick my teeth with? I want to crimp my hair up. In the top drawer of the bureau there on this side. All right. Thinking of taking the afternoon boat to Frisco? I don't know. Go on, talk. I ain't deaf. I can hear you from here. Whoa, you're gonna ride in a big car. Oh a hoist? Oh no, a swell car. Yours. - Mine? - Mm-hmm. Gee I tell you when you get this guy, you're gonna be sitting pretty. - When I get him? - Yes, it's all here in the cards. Frisco is the place. I tell ya. Yeah, that's a swell line, Min. But I ain't thinking of getting out of here. - No? - No. - Ain't you? - No, I ain't. I kinda like this joint. I think I'll stick around a while. Well, I think you're foolish. It's all here in the cards. You think so, Min? Gee, that must be the whistle from the yacht, huh? That's a fishing boat. No, it ain't, Min. I seen it this morning from the porch. Alex pointed it out to me. It belongs to the Camerons. I hear that Cameron guy, that young fella is gonna get married this morning to a girl by the name of Smith. Oh. - Ever hear of her? - Sure. There's a million Smiths around here. They say she used to hang around the waterfront. I have never seen her. That's a lie, Min! And you know it. That's my kid. What are you talking about, Bella Pringle. You're crazy. I ain't so crazy. You can't make a fool of me no longer, you dirty lying rat! I don't know what your game is. But you can't make a sucker out of me no longer. Now Bella! You can throw me out of your dirty old joint. Now I'm gonna get even with you, Min. For everything you ever done to me. See? Bella I... I- I don't know what you mean. What do I mean? I'll show you what I mean! I'll nail you on a cross. You can you dirty little stuck-up brat. Bella! I'll teach ya. You don't know what you're saying. Oh I don't, huh? The game is over, darling. Yes, Bella. At the end of a long journey. You're darn right they'll be diamonds around me. And I'll see that I get them too. And that she'll give them to me. Or I'll know the reason why. Hey. The dirty little snob. Turning up her nose against me as if I'm not good enough for her. You wouldn't hurt the kid. Aw, say, please now... Leave me alone, will ya? A fat chance! She's a swell kid. The first break she's ever had. Break? I'll give her a break for hiking out on me. - It wasn't her fault. - Ha! She never even knowed she had a mother. I suppose you told her that the stork brought her. Well, I told her you was dead. That's where you're out of luck, you filthy old liar. I'm gonna show you up. Both of you. You wouldn't do that. It'd kill her. Say, this is her first chance to be happy and respectable. Respectable? Ha ha ha! Respectable! So she's gonna live in a swell house on the top of a hill, is she? And she's gonna have diamonds and servants to wait on her? And I'm gonna be right there to get my share, believe me. I'm gonna get those diamonds you seen in my castle. Or I'll know the reasons why. He's gonna have a church wedding, huh? And the mother's gonna be right there in time to kiss the blushing bride. If they see you at the church... Aw, dry up, will ya? You've had your say. Aw, don't. Don't look at me like that, Min. I ain't afraid of ya! I ain't afraid of any of ya! If they don't like me, they know what they can do. They can pay me to get rid of me. And plenty too. If they don't do it, I'm gonna yell it from the housetops. I'm gonna stand on the corner and I'm gonna spit at them! So good-bye, Min. I'll point my finger right straight at her. And tell her who she really is. And what I think of her. You know me, Min. When I call a spade a spade, nobody forgets. Mm-hmm. You ain't gonna leave this room. No? Who's gonna stop me? I'm gonna stop ya. You ain't got the guts to do it. You got you just where I want you. Yeah? Now you listen to me. You, gutter rat! You or nobody else is gonna ruin that kid's chances! No, sir. I loved her with all the clumsy love that I had. And I'm gonna tell you something. She's a swell kid. Clean, loyal. Even to an old sea cow like me. And I'm warning you, Bella. You ain't gonna leave the room! I ain't? No, you ain't. - You mean that? - Umm. Gee! Min! Min! Min. What did you do that for? What did you do it for? That boat of mine is all ready to go to Mexico. You're going with me. Min, come on. Let's go. Will ya, Min? Bye! - Bye! - Goodbye, Nancy! Min, let's go, will ya, please? Let's go, Min. Bye! Come on. What's the matter? She ain't done nothing. She knows. Come on! Aw, don't get tough with her.

I've never been in a situation like this in my life. - Where do you come from? - I'm Alexander P. Lovett. - Why aren't you registered? - It'd serve you right to be left behind. How could I know a war was going to break out over my head? Right over my head. My word! Those Chinese were pouncing on me. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape. - Where were you hiding? - Hiding? No. Hunting. I was in the interior hunting fossils. - This morning I looked up suddenly... - And a war broke out right over your head! Next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British consul. Very good, Freshie. Put his name on the list and make out a report later. I beg your pardon, brother. - What did you say you were hunting? - Fossils. - Fossils? - I'm a palaeontologist. - A what? - A palaeontologist. I see. I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebra from the lumbar of a Megatherium, found in Asia. - What do you know about that? - Found in Asia. When I get home, I'll probably be knighted for it. You don't say! - Do you mind if I take a look at it? - Not at all. Sorry. This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me. From this vertebra, I'll be able to reconstruct... ...the entire skeleton... You expect to be knighted for finding that soup bone? This is the vertebra of a Megatherium found in Asia. I remember. You said that before. Sir Henry Derwent was knighted. He never got beyond the Mesozoic era. - Poor fellow! - Yes, it just shows... I don't know why I'm talking to you. Who are you? - Okay, brother. - Don't call me ""brother. "" Okay, sister. No offence. Cigarette? - I say, will you have a cigarette? - No. You're an American, aren't you? Go and annoy the rest of your playmates. Let me alone. Look what I found. Just what I needed, too. You. Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Think of it. A cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means? Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me. Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway, England's new Foreign Secretary. Hooray! How I'm going to bask in reflected glory. People will point to me and say: ""There goes George Conway, brother of the Foreign Secretary. "" - Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle. - That's why they're sending for you. With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen. You can laugh if you want to. But whom else can they get? Who else in England is half the fighter and half the diplomat... ...who has half your knowledge of the foreign situation? They can't stop you now. Hello, Freshie. - Did you make that report out yet? - Yes, Bob. - Did you say we saved 90 white people? - Yes. Hooray for us. Did you say that we left 10,000 natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count. You'd better try to get some sleep. Just you wait until I'm foreign secretary. Can't you just see me with all those other shrewd little foreign secretaries? The trick is to see who can outtalk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing. If you can't get it with smooth talk, you send your army in. I'm going to fool them. I'm not going to have an army. I am going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships. I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. When the enemy approaches, we'll say: ""Come in, gentlemen. What can we do for you?"" So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think? They'll say, ""Something's wrong here, we've been duped! ""This is not according to form. ""These people seem quite friendly. Why should we shoot them?"" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants. And I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum. You'd better not drink anymore. You're not talking sense. Don't worry, George, nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little foreign secretary we've ever had. Just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else. - Do try to sleep, Bob. - Yes. Good thing, sleep. Ever notice the sunrise in China? You should. It's beautiful. Good morning, Lovey. - I beg your pardon? - I say, ""Good morning, Lovey. "" Good morning. Look here, young man. I didn't care for ""sister"" last night, and I don't like ""Lovey"" this morning. - My name is Lovett, Alexander P. - I see. - It's a good morning, anyway. - I'm never conversational before coffee. Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? We're supposed to be travelling east, aren't we? - Of course. - It looks to me as if we're travelling west. - That's ridiculous. - Is it? It certainly is. Any child knows how to tell direction. I don't care where the child is, in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is north, your left hand is south. I get it twisted because I'm left-handed. - Really? - Yes. Just reverse it. Your left hand is... What difference does it make? The north is the north. All I know is the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it. Now you're irritating and absurd. Of course. Boy! We're travelling in the wrong direction. - We're going in the wrong direction. - Couldn't you make less noise? We're going west, and Shanghai is way east of here. Quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. - It's Fenner. - He may have lost his way. That's what I told him. You can't expect him to sail in the dark. Calm yourself. I'll speak to Fenner. Fenner! I say... - Bob, it isn't Fenner in the cockpit! - Stop it. The bloke up there looks Chinese or Mongolian. We're nowhere near Shanghai. We're going in the opposite direction. We're over the desert. That's funny. Charming chap. Nice puss to meet in a dark alley. - That's that. - I wonder what happened to Fenner. Who is he? How'd he get there? Do you think we stopped last night and changed pilots? That's not possible. If we'd landed, we would've awakened. We never left the air. I didn't sleep the whole night long. - That fellow got on at Baskul. - Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know. What are you going to do? - I'll make him tell us his game. - What if he refuses? - We'll smash his face in. - Brilliant! Can anyone here fly a plane? That's no good. - I guess we're in for it. - In for what? I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane. - When he lands, we'll find out. - You won't do anything till we land? - What do you suggest? - Why, you... - He may dash us to pieces. - It might afford you a great deal of relief. I am going back to sleep. I was having such a peaceful dream. As soon as he lands, let me know. We're heading down! We're going to land. We're coming to a village. - What are these people? - I don't know. I can't get their dialect. They're loading up with gasoline. Imagine having that fuel there, waiting for us! Something tells me our journey is just beginning. Where are we going? If you ask me, we're heading straight for those mountains. Douglas plane from Baskul with Conway and four others aboard still missing. Unreported between here and Baskul. Make it very emphatic that His Majesty's government... ...will hold the Chinese government and all governors of Chinese provinces... ...responsible for the complete safety of Robert Conway. Good morning, gentlemen. - No news yet, sir? - It's fantastic. The plane couldn't disappear into thin air. Cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai. Leave no stone unturned to find Conway. - Robertson? - Yes, sir. Postpone the Far East conference. We can't meet those nations... ...without Conway. This can't be kidnapping. They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it. What do you make of it, Bob? You must have some idea. I give it up. Not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway. Mr. Conway, for a man who's supposed to be a leader... ...your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing. - What do you want him to do? - I don't know. I'm a palaeontologist, not a foreign secretary. - George, come on. - It's not knowing that's so awful. Not knowing where you're going, why, or what's waiting when you get there. We got above that storm. I can't stand it any longer! Take us down! I can't stand the pain any longer. Let me out of here! I can't stand it any longer! Let me out of here! It's oxygen. - Take this in your teeth. - Let me alone. Come on. That's right. Bite on that. What's that? - What's happening? - He must have run out of fuel. Look! Look down there! George! Everybody! Better get back towards the tail. He may nose her over. Into the corner! Quick, George! Cushions! Blankets! Take that behind you. - Everybody all right? - Yeah. - He's fainted? - Looks like it. You smell those fumes? Here, George, take the gun. Hold the light. I'll search him before he comes to. We might find something interesting. There's a map. - He's dead. - Dead? It must have happened when he hit the ground. Let's take a look at this map. What is it? - See that spot? - Yes. That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilisation ends. We must be 1,000 miles beyond it. Just a blank on the map. - What does it mean? - It means we're in unexplored country. Country nobody ever reached. Conway! What's happening? Our chances of getting out of this are slim, but it's up to us. We can't have three hysterical people on our hands. - What do you say? - Everything's all right. The pilot won't trouble us anymore. He's dead. - Dead? - Probably a heart attack. What are we going to do? Nothing until the morning. The storm will probably die down before then. My suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night's rest. Why not tell them the truth. We're a million miles from civilisation... ...without a chance of getting out of here alive? It's slow starvation. It's slow horrible death. That's perfect. Just perfect. What a kick I'm going to get out of this. A year ago, a doctor gave me six months to live. That was a year ago. I'm already six months to the good. I'm on velvet. I haven't got a thing to lose. But, you, the noble animals of the human race... ...what a kick I'll get out of watching you squirm for a change. What a kick! They've been gone for hours. Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. - Heroes of the newspapers. - All right. Keep quiet. Here they come. Hello, everybody. We found some food. No chance of starving now. - What is that? - Mountain grass. It's good. Have some. I've read of people lasting 30 days on this stuff. My brother and I have worked out a plan. If we use our heads we'll keep alive for weeks, till he gets back. - Gets back? - Where's he gone? He's starting out right away in the direction of India. Sooner or later, he's bound to run into a tribe or something. Here's the idea. We found a cave over that small hill. As soon as we bury the pilot, we'll move in. We can have a fire. I shouldn't be surprised to see Bob back within a week. You haven't a Chinaman's chance of getting out of here alive. You know it. - Cave? Where? - Over by that hill. Hey, look! Look, Bob! - Where are they? Do you see them? - Yes. Do you think they're cannibals? I am from the nearby lamasery. My name is Chang. He's speaking English. - And mine's Conway. - How do you do? You've no idea how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and l, and the lady in the plane... ...left Baskul the night before last for Shanghai. But we were travelling in the opposite direction. At the mercy of a mad pilot. - We'd be eternally grateful if you... - Where is your ""mad"" pilot? He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead. We were going to bury him when you came along. Pardon me. If you will be good enough to direct us to your lamasery... It is an honour to accompany you and your friends. You'll need suitable clothes for the journey. - It is not particularly far, but quite difficult. - Thank you. Welcome to Shangri-La. You see we are sheltered by mountains on every side. A strange phenomenon for which we are very grateful. It's magical. - I definitely do not like this place. - Will you quit squawking? - Look at what they gave me to wear. - You never looked better. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they'll give them back to us, Lovey. Something tells me this means food. Come on. I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner. If this be execution, lead me to it. That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them. - You're a scream, Lovey. - Please don't call me ""Lovey. "" That was refreshing. The food looks good. Some layout they got here. You see the rooms? Couldn't do better at the Ritz. All the conveniences for the condemned. - Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery. - I don't like this place. It's too mysterious. It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it? Is there something I can do for you? - What do you want? - I've ordered you some warm broth. - I thought perhaps... - Get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here... Please. Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do. I don't need any advice from you. Get me a doctor. - I'm sorry, we have no doctors here. - No doctors. Well, that's just fine. - Please let me help you. - You can help me jump over that cliff. I've been looking at the bottom of that mountain... ...but I haven't got the nerve to jump. You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometime? Don't preach that cheap, second-hand stuff to me. Go on, beat it! Beat it! Peace be with you, my child. Good evening, my friends. Please sit down. - I hope you found everything satisfactory. - Swell. Excellent. - You shouldn't have waited for me. - Where's the girl? Miss Stone. She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well. Please go on without me. I eat very little. There's certainly nothing wrong with that meal. Thank you. - And the wine is excellent. - I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley. Now that dinner is over, we're very anxious... ...to discuss ways and means of getting back home. First, we want to cable the Foreign Office. England's waiting for news of my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai to take him back. Really? As regards cabling, I'm afraid I can't help. Unfortunately we have no wireless here. As a matter of fact, we have no means of communication with the outside world. - Not even a radio? - It's been a source of deep regret... ...but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible. We'd better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilisation. - Are you so certain you are away from it? - As far away as I ever want to be. The porters will be very well paid. That is, within reason. I'm afraid that wouldn't help. We have no porters here. No porters here? What about those men we met this morning? Those are our own people. They never venture beyond where you were met this morning. It's much too hazardous. How do you account for all this? Who brought it in? There is a tribe of porters some 500 miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favourable weather, they make the journey. - How can we get in touch with them? - In that respect you are very fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now. What do you mean by ""almost any time now""? We've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years. - Two years? - Yes. Well... But I assure you, gentlemen, if there is a prolonged delay... ...Shangri-La will endeavour to make your stay as pleasant as possible. And now, if you will excuse me, it is getting late. I do hope you all sleep well. Good night. Good night, Mr. Conway. Good night, sir. That's what I mean, mysterious. I don't like that man. He's too vague. We didn't get much information out of him, did we? It seems we should be grateful. We were in a bad mess this morning. After all, this is quite pleasant. Why not make ourselves comfortable until the porters do arrive? That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? - I saw some cards in the other room. - Not for me, thanks. I'm too weary. How about you, Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge. - I'm thinking. - Thinking? - What about some double solitaire? - In fact, I'm very good at it. - No kidding? - Yes. Then I'm your man. Come on, Toots. - Hello, George. Cigarette? - Thanks. I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure. There's been plenty of it in the last few days. It's far from over from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps. Hidden away like this, no contact with civilisation. You don't seem concerned at all. I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything. I think I'm going to like it here. You talk as if you intend on staying. Something happened to me when we arrived here that... Did you ever go to a strange place and feel sure you'd been there before? - What are you talking about? - I don't know. You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you: ""The man who always wanted to see the other side of the hill. "" Do you ever want to see what's on the other side? What else could there be, except another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. It seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. - I'd give anything to be in London now. - Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, you should take that job with Helen's father. What do you mean, ""lf""? - Did I say, ""lf""? - That's what you said. Well, I mean... You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here. I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? Why did those clothes materialise so conveniently when they met us? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there, unless it was to meet us? Chang's first question was about the pilot. There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. What reason could they have for doing a thing like that? That's what's on the other side of the hill. It's 3,000 feet practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over 2,000 people in the valley besides those here in Shangri-La. Who and what is Shangri-La? You? Goodness, no. - So there are others? - Yes. - Who, for instance? - In time you will meet them all. For a man who talks a lot, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be. There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss. That's the fourth time you've said that. You should record it. Let's go inside. I'd like to show you our rare treasures. - Good afternoon. - Excuse me, l... Please, don't go. Tea will be served any moment. Won't you come in? My name is Maria. Won't you sit down? By the way, what religion do you follow here? To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind. Even including excess of virtue itself. That's intelligent. In the valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness... ...and in return, we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest, moderately chaste... ...and somewhat more than moderately happy. How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police? Good heavens, no! How do you deal with incorrigibles, criminals? We have no crime here. What makes a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy. The desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime when there is a sufficiency of everything. You have no disputes over women? Only very rarely. It wouldn't be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted. Suppose he wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang... ...if it was good manners or not. In that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man... ...to let him have her. That's very convenient. I think I'd like that. You'd be surprised how a little courtesy all around... ...helps to smooth out the most complicated problems. At some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her. Some man had better get ready to be very courteous to me. Mr. Chang, all these things, books, instruments, sculpture... ...were they all brought in over those mountains by porters? They were. - That must have taken... - Centuries. Centuries. Where did you get the money to pay for all these treasures? We have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes... ...because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it. That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them? Our valley is very rich in a metal called gold... ...which, fortunately for us, is valued very highly in the outside world. - So, we merely... - Buy and sell. Buy and sell... Pardon me. Exchange. I see. Gold for ideas. There's something so simple and naive about all this... ...that I suspect there's been a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start? That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man. Who? A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault. The first European to find this place and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught the natives... ...and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault. When was all this? Way back in 1713, I think it was... ...that Father Perrault stumbled into the valley, half-frozen to death. It was typical of the man that one leg being frozen... ...and there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself. He amputated his own leg? Oddly enough, when he had learned to understand their language... ...the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would've healed without amputation. - They didn't actually mean that? - Yes. They were very sincere about it, too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health was the rule here. They've never known anything different. What was true for them, they thought would be true for anyone else living here. Well, is it? Rather astonishingly so, yes. Particularly in the case of Father Perrault himself. When he and the natives had finished building Shangri-La... ...he was 108 years old and still very active... ...in spite of having only one leg. 108 and still active? You're startled. No, I'm just a little bowled over, that's all. Forgive me. I should've told you it's quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression: ""He worried himself to death,"" or, ""This thing or that killed him""? - Very often. - And very true. Your lives are, therefore, as a rule, shorter. Not so much by natural death, as by indirect suicide. That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course. You surprise me. I surprise you! Now, that's news. I mean your amazement. I could've understood it in any of your companions, but you... ...who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognise one of your own dreams when you see it? If you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed... - ... in moderation, of course. - Then everything's quite all right? It's terrific! I just saw something that'd make your hair stand on end. You see those hills over there? Gold. Popping right out of them. Tons of it. You keep this under your hat. If the others hear about it, they'll declare themselves in. But if I can mine that stuff, I'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street. Now look, I've got a plan and if l... Say, honey... ...you ain't feeling so well, are you? Don't pay attention to what those doctors tell you. I've seen a lot of people fool 'em. And I've got a hunch this place is gonna be good for you. Honest I have. Come on, you be a good kid and snap out of it. And I'll cut you in on the gold deal. I'm going up and make a deal with Chang right now. Oh, my! - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Conway. - You speak English? - Yes, sir. - Would you like to take a ride? - No, thanks. Not just now. Well, I think I'll take that ride. Fossils! Why? What for? Running around digging up a lot of old bones. You didn't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance? You seem gay. Did you find out anything? I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours if he's got any manners. - Nothing about the porters yet? - Porters? We've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing. Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, have we? I'm afraid the porters are just a myth. Guess we'll never know why we're here or how long we'll be held prisoners. Hurry up, you slowpokes. I'm starved. ""Please, do not wait for me. ""I eat so very little. "" - Good evening. - Good evening. I'm glad to see us all finally organised. Okay, handsome. Dish it out and make it snappy. - What's happened to you? - Nothing. Why? You look beautiful. That's unkind. Miss Stone always looks beautiful. I got it. It's your make-up. You've got none on. Honey, you look a million percent better. Wholesome, kind of, and clean. Take a tip from me, don't ever put that stuff on your face again. It's like hiding behind a mask. Who're you to talk about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you. Have I? Strange, you've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why not take your mask off for once? Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde. All right, I will. I'll let my hair down. Why not? It can't make any real difference now. Lovey... - ... were you ever chased by the police? - Certainly not! Believe me, it's no fun. When you picked me up at Baskul, they were on my tail for a year. The police? Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant? Chalmers Bryant? Bryant Utilities. That's me. I knew it. I knew I had a reason for hating you. Sir, you're a thief! He never stole from you, did he? I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities I bought with money... ...l'd saved for 20 years, teaching school. Now, I couldn't sell it for postage stamps. That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation. Now look at me. The nerve you have sitting there, talking about it so calmly. The swindler of thousands of people. That's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me, starts out in life as a plumber. An ordinary, everyday slew-footed plumber. And by the use of a little brains, he builds up a gigantic institution. Employs thousands of people. Becomes a great civic leader. Then the crash comes. Overnight, he's the biggest crook the country ever had. You're a thief and a swindler... ...and I'll be glad to turn you over to the police when we get back. ""When we get back! "" What makes you think we'll ever get back? You're all prisoners here. We were kidnapped and brought here and nobody knows why. I don't want to be a prisoner. I'm finding out when we're leaving here. I'll make that Chinese talk if it's the last thing I do. Where's Chang? Where's Chang or I'll blow your brains out? - What do you think you're doing? - Let me go. Come here! Come here, you! You idiot! Had to sock him? - Let me up. - You all right? Sorry. Is it true about us being kidnapped? I say, is it true about us being kidnapped? Mr. Chang! Do you mind stepping in here for a moment? Won't you sit down? You have been very kind to us and we appreciate it. But for some reason we're being held prisoners here... ...and we want to know why. Personally, I don't mind at all. I'm enjoying every minute of it. But my brother is not of the same opinion, nor are the others. It's time we were told what it's all about. We want to know why we were kidnapped, why we're being kept here... ...but most important of all, do we get the porters and when? Until we get this information... ...l'm very much afraid we cannot permit you to leave this room. You know, it's very strange... ...but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news. The High Lama wishes to see you. - The High Lama? Who in blazes is he? - I thought you ran this joint. High lamas or low lamas, do we get the porters? The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come. - Don't believe him. - Sounds like a stall to me. - Better have him talk... - One moment. You say the High Lama's the only one who can give us information? The only one. And he can arrange for the porters to take us back? The High Lama arranges everything. Then he's the man I want to see. Will you come along? Better wait here until I get back. We'll soon know where we stand. Good evening. Please, come in. Sit here, near me. I'm an old man and can do no one any harm. Are you the High Lama? Yes. I trust you've been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival. Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as... It's astonishing and incredible, but... What is it, my son? You're the man. Chang told me. You're the first who... Two hundred years ago. You're still alive, Father Perrault. Sit down, my son. You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours... ...for a great many years. Not of Conway, the empire builder and public hero. I wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books said: ""There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal. "" That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here. That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea? Sondra Bizet. The girl at the piano? Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you. As have we all. Of course, I've suspected that our being here was no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community? We need men like you here... ...to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence... ...you can expect 20 or 30 years... ...of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri-La... ...by our standards, your life has just begun. And may go on and on. To be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. If that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on. We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision... ...long ago. I saw all the nations strengthening... ...not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiplying... ...until a single-weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder... ...would rage so hotly over the world... ...that every book, every treasure would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving... ...that I determined to gather together all things of beauty... ...and culture that I could and preserve them here... ...against the doom toward which the world is rushing. Look at the world today. Is there anything more pitiful? What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership. A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other... ...compelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend... ...when this orgy will spend itself. When brutality and the lust for power... ...must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here... ...and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here, we shall be with their books... ...and their music and the way of life... ...based on one simple rule: Be kind. When that day comes... ...it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La... ...will spread throughout the world. Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other... ...the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled... ...and the meek shall inherit the earth. I understand you, Father. You must come again, my son. Good night. Well? - What did you find out? - We thought you were never coming back. - When do we leave? - What about the porters? Porters? - Didn't you find out about the porters? - Why, I'm sorry, but l... What were you doing all this time? What's the matter with you? You went there... Do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight. Hello. Good morning. ""Lay thee down now, and rest ""May thy slumber be blessed ""Lullaby, and good night ""Thy mother's delight ""Bright angels around ""My darling shall sound ""They will guard thee from harm"" Do you mind? ""They will guard thee from harm ""Thou shall wake in my arms"" This is Mr. Conway, children. Good morning, Mr. Conway. - How do you do? - Very well, thank you. Children, Teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon. So, school's dismissed. Please. I hope you're not going to run away this time. My name's Sondra. I hope you'll forgive me for... You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it? You mean my pigeons. It's these little flutes that I attached to their tails. See? Come along with me and I'll show you how I put them on. This is how we tie them on. By varying the size of the flutes, I can get any notes I wish. The wind does the rest. Here's a little fellow who has lost his. - Was this your idea? - Yes. Hold this pigeon. You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in? - That was easy. I'd read your books. - You've read my books? You do more things. What have my books got to do with it? I saw a man whose life was empty. ""A man whose life was empty. "" I know, it was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere and you knew it. As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark. ""A little boy whistling... "" Do you realise that there was a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai... ...smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings... ...waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London. Do you know right now there are headlines shrieking the news... ...that Conway's missing? Does that look like a man who's life was empty? Yes. You're absolutely right. I had to come to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person... ...who knew it. May I congratulate you? I only brought you here to show you my pigeons. Don't worry about them. Now you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet. I've so many questions I'd like to ask, I don't know where to begin. I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. - That I was born here. - Thank you. Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My parents were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered for a year. When Chang found us only father and I were alive. He was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up by Father Perrault. I envy you. - I talked to him last night. - I know. I can't quite get used to this age thing. I'm 30. You're going to make life very simple. It's inconceivable. - What? - All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world... ...with its glorious concepts. And now you come along and confuse me entirely. I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. Why do I confuse you? Am I so strange? On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I had the same idea about Shangri-La. The sense I've been here before, that I belonged here. I'm so glad. I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow... ...familiar. The very air that I breathe. The lamasery... ...with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley... ...while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you... ...all somehow are familiar. I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably. With the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why? Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it. - I wonder. - I'm sure of it. Just as I am sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I've never seen the outside world, but I understand there are many people... ...who are supposed to be mean and greedy. I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot... ...where there is peace and security. Where there's beauty and comfort. Where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. I just wish the whole world might come to this valley. Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long. I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard or Mr. Chalmers Bryant... ...or Mr. Embezzler, or whatever your name may be. - Just call me Barney. - Barney? Why should I? Never, we have nothing in common. What effrontery! Okay, Lovey. And this trip to the valley. Why did I allow you to drag me here? You don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed. They're very nice people, except that they've got horns. - Horns? - You know. Horns. What kind of horns? Come on. They won't hurt you. All I want is a glass of wine. - Thanks. - Sit down. Now this is fine. This is swell. No, thanks, just a drink. I've been walking and I'm a little thirsty. That's all right. I just don't happen to be very hungry. All I asked for was a glass of wine. Look here, I've got to have some help with this. Where is Lovey? Look! Mr. Barnard! Come here! I asked for a glass of wine, look what I got. Come on, sit down. This is where you are. I might have known. - No wonder you couldn't hear me. - Relax and have a glass of wine. - Sit down! - And be poisoned out here in the open? - Won't you please have a glass of wine? - I never drink wine, in the daytime. - There you are. - This doesn't obligate me in any way. No. The bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said: ""Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "" And then the mama bear said: ""Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "" And then the big papa bear, he roared: ""And somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "" You have to admit, the poor little bears were in a quandary. Well, I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey. - They were in a quandary. - Come on, Lovey. Why, ""Come on"" all the time? What's the matter, you going to be a fuss-budget all your life? Drink it up. Aren't you having any fun? - Where was I? - In a quandary. I'm telling this story. The poor little bears... ...they didn't know what to do. Somebody had been sleeping in their beds. Who slept in their beds? Who was it, Lovey? You called me ""Lovey""? Look at those eyes. There's the devil in those eyes. ""Here we go gathering nuts in May ""Here we go gathering nuts in May Early on Tuesday morning ""Here we go, Shangri-La, Shangri-La ""Here you are in Shangri-La"" Hello, Maria. You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long. Sorry. - I haven't got any cigarettes left. - I'll make some for you. You will come today? Perhaps. Please say you will. The days are very long and lonely without you. Please. All right, I'll be there. Thank you. You'll tell me the things I want to know, right? Who's in charge? Why we were kidnapped and what will happen to us? Chang's been lying about those porters, hasn't he? Beautiful. - I'm waiting for the bump. - ""Bump""? When the plane lands at Shanghai and wakes us all up. You see. It's not a dream. I sometimes think that the other is the dream. The outside world. - Have you never wanted to go there? - Goodness, no! From what you tell me, it doesn't sound very attractive. It's not so bad really. Some phases of it are sordid, of course. That's only to be expected. Why? Usual reasons. - A world of people struggling for existence. - Struggling? Why? Everyone naturally wants to make a place for himself. - Accumulate a nest egg and so on. - Why? If you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. - And don't ask me why. - I was just going to. It's the most annoying word in the English language. Ever hear a child torture his parent with it? ""Mother's darling mustn't stuff her fingers in the salad bowl. "" ""Why?"" ""Because it isn't ladylike to do that. "" ""Why?"" ""That's what forks are made for, darling. "" - ""Why, Mother?"" - ""Mother read it in a book somewhere. ""If Mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers... ""... out of the salad bowl this instant, Mother's going to wring her little neck. "" - Would you like to wring my little neck? - I'd love it. Why? I'm sorry. I've thought about it for years. I knew you'd come. And I knew when you did, you'd never leave. Am I forgiven for sending for you? Forgiven. When we were on that plane... ...I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow... ...racing along over mountains and valleys... ...covering 10 times the distance of the plane. Yet always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane... ...and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life, I've been rushing up and down hills... ...leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles... ...never dreaming that one day, that beautiful thing in flight... ...could land on this earth and into my arms. This place is amazing. That marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth weavers are all so happy. You may not know it, but right here you have Utopia. - You're very kind. - I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due. I'm very anxious to have you realise that I never for a moment believed... ...that ridiculous kidnapping story. - I'm so glad. - Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? I held a sort of a self inventory. I said to myself last night, ""Lovey, Mr. Lovett... "" - I said, ""You are an ungrateful fool. "" - No. Those are my very words to myself last night. ""These people here are doing everything to make your stay comfortable... ""... and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation. "" What would you like to do? I thought with your permission and while I'm waiting for these porters... ...l'd like to organise classes for the children in the valley... ...and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology. - Splendid. - Isn't it? I was a professor for 20 years. - And a very good one. - I'm sure you were. - When would you like to start? - Immediately. Then it's done. Thank you. You get the idea? From this reservoir here, I can pipe the whole works. I'm going to get a kick out of this. It's just to keep my hand in. With the equipment we have here... ...I can put a plumbing system in the whole village. Rig it up in no time. Do you realise those people are still going to the well for water? - It's unbelievable. - Think of it! In times like these! What about that gold deal? - Gold, you know... - Oh, that. That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it. I've got to get busy. I want to show this layout to Chang. - Don't you take any wooden nickels. - All right. You're acting like a child. You haven't talked for two weeks. There's nothing to say. - I'm afraid that does it. - I'm afraid it does. Shall we have another? Not tonight, if you don't mind. Come in, my dear. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I thought Mr. Conway's brother was here. Excuse me. Charming, isn't she? Yes. Charming. Your brother seems quite fascinated by her. Why not? She's an attractive young woman. Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed... ...when her carriers lost their way in the mountain. The party would've perished, but for meeting some of our people. Amazing. Still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance? Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely. Suppose she should leave? Leave Shangri-La? That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out. I mean her appearance. If she should leave the valley, what would happen? She'd quickly revert in appearance to her actual age. It's weird. How old are you? Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. Each time you Westerners... ...celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds. There you are! You're just the man I'm looking for. A fine trick. Smart, aren't you? What lies you told us about those porters! The minute they arrive we can leave, if they'd take us. - But you know you'd tell 'em not to. - My dear boy... You've been lying since we arrived. It's worked for some people. Because they lack the courage to do something. But not me. You're up against the wrong man. I'll leave, even if I have to blow this place into the valley. I'll get out, porters or no porters! You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive. I can't let him go alone. It's suicide. Yes, of course your brother is a problem. It was to be expected. I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help. You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem. Mine? Because, my son, I'm placing in your hands... ...the future and destiny of Shangri-La... ...for I am going to die. I knew my work was done, when I first set eyes upon you. I've waited for you, my son, for a long time. I've sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I've looked into their eyes and heard their voices... ...always in hope that I might find you. My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath... ...for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient. To care for the riches of the mind. To preside in wisdom... ...while the storm rages without. Do you think this will come in my time? You, my son, will live through the storm. You will preserve the fragrance of our history... ...and add to it a touch of your own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens. But I see at a great distance... ...a new world stirring in the ruins... ...stirring clumsily... ...but in hopefulness... ...seeking its lost and legendary treasures... ...and they will all be here, my son. Hidden behind the mountains... ...in the Valley of the Blue Moon... ...preserved as by a miracle. We run the pipes through here and connect with the main waterline here. Where are you going to get pipes? That's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay. There you are. You'd better get your things together. We're leaving. - Leaving? - The porters are taking us back. We've got clothing, food, everything. When are you going to start? This very minute. They're waiting for us on the plateau. That Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along. I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on the next trip. You mean you don't want to go? Well, I'm... You're afraid of going to jail. You see I've got this plumbing business. If you insist being an idiot, I won't coax you. How about you? You don't want to go yet, honey. She'll stick around, too. That right? If you want me to. Sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you. All right, suit yourself, but just remember you had your chance. - How about you? Do you want to go? - Where? Home. I've got porters to take us back. I'm sorry. That's impossible. I have my classes. I don't care what you've started. Do you want to go? No, I think I'd better wait. - Yes, I'll wait. - You'll wait until you rot! - Hello, Gloria. - Hello. I've just finished translating an interesting old tablet. It told me of the origin of the Masonic symbols... - That's swell. - What? I want to show you something. Isn't that pretty. What is it? Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village. Hello, George. You can stop worrying now. I've made arrangements to leave. If you let me close that window, I can talk to you. That noise is driving me crazy. I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilisation. I made a deal with the porters. They're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us outside the valley. Get your things together. - Where's your topcoat? - You can't leave. What's going to stop me? - You've got to stay here now. - Stay here? What's the matter with you? You've acted strangely since we came. I've never seen you like this. What's stopping us from leaving? Something grand and beautiful. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it and I can't leave it. You mustn't either. I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that's eating you up. - Tell me about it. - I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastic and unbelievable... ...but so beautiful. As you know, we were kidnapped and brought here... And that's the whole story. He died, as peacefully as the passing of a cloud's shadow. His last words were: ""I place in your hands, my son... ""... the future and destiny of Shangri-La. "" Now you know why I can't leave. I really don't know what to say. - Except that you must be completely mad. - You think I'm mad? What else can I think after a tale like that? Things like that don't happen today. - We're living in the 20th century. - You think it's nonsense? You've been hypnotised by fanatics. I wouldn't believe it in England. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you know these things are true? - Did they show you proof? - I don't need proof. I knew there was a reason why I hated this place. I'd love to fly over it with bombs for what they've done to you. All this talk about lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates? I can't believe it. A bunch of old men sit around and dream about reforming the world... ...and you, two-feet-on-the-ground Conway, want to join them. It's horrible. Is that all my story meant to you? What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk. Then you'd better go. This is no place for you. It's no place for you. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here till you're half dead? Till your mind starts corroding like the rest of them? - I don't want to talk about it anymore. - You've got to talk. And me? They stole the plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility. I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead. It's that girl. - That girl has twisted and turned... - That's enough. Never mind the girl. Why don't you go? Look here. Ever since I can remember you've looked after me. Now, you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother. If there's something wrong with you... ...let me help you. I don't feel like making that trip alone. You couldn't possibly stay here, could you? I'd go mad. I may be wrong. I may be a maniac... ...but I believe in this and I'm not going to lose it. You know how much I want to help you... ...but this is bigger, stronger if you like, than brotherly love. I'm sorry. I'm staying. I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye. Are you sure the porters will take care of you? It's all set. - Maria made the arrangements. - Maria? - The little Russian girl. - How's she involved? - She's going with me. - You're crazy. - You can't take her away from here. - Why not? You can't. Do you know what will happen if she leaves Shangri-La? She's fragile and can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo. What do you mean, ""Fade away like an echo""? She came here in 1888. This'd be funny, if it weren't so pathetic. She isn't a day over 20. - You're wrong. - I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway. I found out a lot of things last night. I'm not ashamed of it. It's one of the few decent things... ...that's ever happened in this hellish place. Everyone is happy in Shangri-La. Nobody would ever think of leaving. It's all just rot! She's pleaded with me since I came to take her away from this place. She's cried in my arms, for fear I'd leave her here. She's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters. For me! I don't believe a word of it. All right, I'll prove it to you. You've believed everything they're told you without proof. I'll prove my story. Come in a minute. I've got some bad news for you. My brother and I've decided we can't take you along. You can't take me? You promised to take me with you! It's all your fault. It was all arranged until he spoke to you. Why can't you leave us alone? - You want to leave Shangri-La? - I'll die if I have to stay another minute. I've waited a long time for this chance and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. I brought the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out. The High Lama told them not to take anyone. The High Lama! Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. They only want to know how much gold he'll give. I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to leave this place. To leave the High Lama, who calls himself Father Perrault. He's been insane for years. - Father Perrault is dead. - He's dead! That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him. You must take me with you. Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you? Old woman? - Chang told you that, didn't he? - Yes. I thought so. He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He gets mad when anyone comes near me. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I'd have left long ago. But he always stops me. Six months ago I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy. Look at me! Do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes. Are these the eyes of an old woman? She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were. I don't believe it. I can't believe it. She's lying. You're lying. Every word you've been saying is a lie. Say it! You're lying, aren't you? No, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? Chances are we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive. But I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm, be buried alive... ...than to stay here one more minute. - You say the porters are waiting for us? - Yes. - Clothes? - Yes, everything. What about the others? I've asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them. Come on, we're wasting time. - Are you taking me? - Certainly. Come on. It won't be long before we're in London. Can't you just see everyone when we pop in out of the blue? We'll have them breathless when we tell them our story. You had me worried for a while. I thought you were gone completely. Lucky for me you snapped out of it. You saved my life. - I never could have made it alone. - What was that? - I was saying... - Shut up! Must you go on babbling? - What's happened? Where's Bob? - He's going, my child. - Going? - But he will return. No! I can't stand it. I can't go on anymore. I've got to rest. How long is this going to go on? I can't stand it. Can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day. There's nothing that would suit 'em more than to lose us, but we must go on. - Come on, darling. - I can't. You've got to let me rest. Target practice again. One of these days they're going to hit us. As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe. Come now. Look at her face! ""Dropping from nowhere after a year! "" - Cable from Gainsford. - Read it! ""Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. ""Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. ""Is suffering from complete loss of memory. "" Signed, Gainsford. - ""Loss of memory""? - All right, give it to the press. - All of it? - Yes. Might as well all of it. I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him. Conway's gone again. Listen to this, from Gainsford. Let me have it. ""Aboard S.S. Manchuria. ""Last night Conway recovered his memory. Talked about Shangri-La. ""Telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. ""Insisted upon returning there at once. ""Locked him in, but he escaped and jumped ship at Singapore. ""I'm leaving ship to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. ""Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La, which I am forwarding. ""Lord Gainsford. "" Here's Gainsford now. - It's good to see you back. - Glad to see you. - It's good to see you again. - Thought you would never come. - Sit down. Have a drink. - Scotch and soda. I'm parched. Here you are. Ready and waiting. - Any news of Conway? - We're eager to know what you discovered. Where is he? Gentlemen, you see before you a very weary old man... ...who has just ended a chase that lasted nearly 10 months. You never caught up with him? Since that night he jumped off the ship, till two weeks ago... - ... l've been missing him by inches. - You don't mean it. - Was he that determined to get back? - Determined? Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life, I've never encountered anything so grim. During those last 10 months, that man has done the most astounding things. He learned how to fly, stole a plane, got caught, put in jail, escaped... ...in an amazingly short space of time. This is only the beginning of his adventure. He begged and fought, pushing forward to the Tibetan frontier. Everywhere I heard these amazing stories of the man's adventures. Positively astounding. Till eventually... ...I trailed him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet. Of course, he had already gone. But his memory... His memory will live with those natives for the rest of their lives. ""The man who was not human,"" they called him. They won't forget the stranger who tried six times... ...to climb a mountain pass that no other human being dared to travel. And six times was forced back by the severest storms. They won't forget the madman who stole their food and clothing. Who they locked up in their barracks and who fought six guards to escape. Their soldiers are still talking about their pursuit to overtake him... ...and shuddering at the memory. He led them the wildest chase through their own country. Finally, he disappeared over that very mountain pass... ...that they themselves dared not travel. And that, gentlemen... ...was the last that any known human being saw of Robert Conway. That's what I call fortitude. - Think of it. - Tell me something, Gainsford. What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La? Do you believe it? Yes. I believe it. I believe it, because I want to believe it. I give you a toast. Here's my hope... ...that Robert Conway will find his Shangri-La. Here's my hope... ...that we all find our Shangri-La.

Hot digidy! What he do it in? 1 minute, 40 seconds. Yeah. Gee, that knocks another second off. He's liable to break the worlds record. Hi, Bill. Ata boy. He can sure pick em up. He's still stalling. Stalling? Yeah. Going as fast as you can see. Nice work. He's great. Whats this? She taught Skeeter to do that. Skeeter? Miss named him that way. You got a mascot, pal. Biggest pals. You know more about him than I do. You hang around a lot, Princes. Make something of it? For Emperor Higgins. Don't let him catch it. Emperor Higgins doesn't know I'm alive. I'm just the young brat. Get married, give him another soninlaw. Someone to take care of another Higgins enterprise. No, thanks I'm coming. Walk him around for about an hour. Any carrots? Six, but no more. Not seven? Take care of him or I'll break your neck. Come on, Bill. A great horse! I wish he run right now. He's got background, stamina. Ana a will to win. Thats important in a horse. The Imperial Racetrack opened last week. Don't you think I know it? I saw you boyfriend, Bill Taylor. Why don't you? Don't what? Take Broadway Bill down to the track. Are you crazy? What are you waiting for? You've been dying to get out of Higginsville. Your heart is in horses and you're making paper boxes. It doesn't make sense. Whats got into you? Oh. You're a fool, daddy. I am, huh? Yes. You've become another Higgins' slave. Mind if I have an idea? What is it? I've always been honest. I'd cut off my right arm before I'd lie to you. What is it? I read my bible and don't mess around. What do you want to tell me? I've been addin' things up. And subtracting, dividing and multiplying. And get the same answer. It wouldn't be honest to race Bill for anyone else. Who asked you? Go on, get out of here. Yes, sir. See you. Come on, Bill. Mr. Brooks! Your wife wants you to come right home. There's a meeting tonight. Beat it. But she... Get out of here, I told you! I was just trying to tell you. Its very important. Margaret... Yes? He made 1:40. How's that? Who made 1:40? Broadway Bill. With Whitey. He must weight at least 150. There's a meeting tonight. Finish dressing. Lets dock the meeting. You take a bath? Sure. Smells horsy to me. I'll take 4 if we dock the meeting. Don't be silly. There's a full moon. Lets go out and sit under it all night. Or 2 nights, a week. What do you say? Whats eating you? Same old bugs. Father'd have a royal fit if we didn't show up. We've got to go. Hang the meeting. What difference does it make? Your father'll do all the talking, and we'll go: Yes, J.L. Of course, J.L. I've got a chronic pain in my neck from nodding. Don't be a fool. Lets go throw rock as the meeting. You say such stupid things. Lets do something else. Why don't you get a zipper? Some day you'll be calling the meetings and won't want rocks. They'd be absolute idiots. Now hurry up, we're going to be late. What about the moon? Come on. Margaret... Good heavens. I know I'm a pest. We'll never get there! I'm serious. What if I tell you I'm miserable here... dying a slow death? Would you go away with me? Where to? Anywhere... where I can make my own living, do what I want. The racing business, I suppose. I'm not interested in making paper boxes. Do you really want me to give up all this? Why not? Live not knowing where my next meal's coming from. Wait for miracles. Its better than this. Doesn't it bother you your husbands a parasite? Thats what I am. There's no use kidding myself. I've got a job cause I married you. Father thinks you're terribly clever. Thats why the others are jealous. He has great plans for you, and someday... Yeah, I know. A crown prince. Good evening, Johnson. Evening, Mr. & Mrs. Early. J.L.'s in the study. Good evening, J.L. Good evening. Father. Good evening, father. Don't scold, I'm on time. J.L.'s in the study. You're not the smartest, but the bestlooking. Thanks. Henry, Matilda. Good evening, father. J.L. Good evening. Mrs. Brooks, Mr. Brooks. Hello, Johnson. J.L.'s in the study. Yes, sir. Good evening. Hello. Hello, dad. Hello, Princess. You're late. I know. Its all my fault. We'll get started. Want to know it was? You and Broadway were talking too long. Think I'll be thrown into the Bastille? You'll be lucky if not beheaded. Before I go to the chopping block... could you dig up a slug of whiskey? Whiskey, in this house? Doesn't anything change around this mausoleum? Yes, bedspreads and underwear. Thats something. Regarding the Acme Lumber Company... we bought it today. And this morning its become the Higgins Lumber Company. I trust that meets with your approval. Sure. Naturally. I trust it meets with yours. Naturally, J.L. For the present, it has no active head... and shall remain so... until the one vacant chair here... becomes suitably populated. If you're referring to me, you're wasting your time. Whats that? The man I marry won't care for the lumber business. Don't be impudent. I'm sorry. There's no further discussion of business... until after dinner. I'm happy to say all the Higgins enterprises are doing well. All except the Higgins Paper Box Company. I'm sorry to report sales have dropped to a dangerous extend. I have the figures in front of me. The first 3 months of the fiscal year... style 4, all colors, dropped 14%. The Higgins Special we manufactured for 20 years... with which we are nationally identified... The Company needs more application of its management. You can't expect a business to flourish when the head... is off gallivanting with a horse. Whats your point? My point? Yes. Its quite obvious. You came here 3 years ago penniless and... with a questionable background. Some sort of association with the racetrack business. I was broadminded enough to overlook that. You and Margaret wanted to get married and I approved. I put you at the head of the Higgins Box Company... on of the largest and successful of the Higgins enterprises. You accepted that responsibility with enthusiasm... and I might even say gratitude. You were the envy of Mr. Early and Mr. Winslow. Your first 2 years were successful. But this past year the company has suffered immeasurably. I attribute it to one cause: Neglect. Shameful neglect. Beginning tomorrow morning, you will devote yourself... exclusively to your business. And get rid of that horse. See that its done. I've gone over the books of the Acme Lumber Company. Cash on hand and in banks, $13,672 and 86 cents. Accounts receivable, $32,842... Wait a minute, Mr. Higgins. I won't sell my horse. I'm leaving Higginsville in the morning. Quiet! What you say is true. I have neglected the business. The reason's simple: I've always hated it. Its a good business. Its all right... for you, or Mr. Winslow, or Mr. Early. They are suited to it, and I'm not. I may sound crazy, and maybe I am but, you strike me the same. Everything seems lopsided. Higginsville, the Higgins family... the Higgins enterprises. We don't speak the same language. You're interested only in... accumulating money, expanding, bobbling up the little ones. You've just snatched Acme away from some poor people. Hope it makes you happy. Careful with what you say! You haven't taken a vacation in 40 years, rotting away in your kingdom. If thats your idea of high living... it isn't mine, nor Margarets. I wouldn't get rid of that horse for you or anybody else. Someday you'll take off your hat to Broadway Bill. I was broke when I came here, but we want nothing from Higginsville. Accept my resignation. I'll wait for you in the car, Margaret. You needn't bother. The meeting's adjourned. Why shouldn't I applaud him? He should have gone long ago. What sort of talk is this? Your little monarchy is fast folding up. Your crown prince is through. Stop this nonsense! You're a strong and powerful ruler, oh mighty king. But you're not going to crush him any longer. Whats the matter with you? You seem very happy he's going. I'm so happy I could shriek. I could go out on rooftops and shriek. I prayed for him every night. I hope he never sets foot in Higginsville again. Oh, father. Look, look. I feel 10 years younger. How you feel? I'm headed for the last roundup. The time has arrived. I'm gonna leave sad times aside. I'm headed for the last roundup. Hey, whats up? Whats up? She's here, Gallant Lady. Gallant Lady? I gotta take a look. Hello, Dan. Where've you been all these years? Hiding under rocks. Bradshaw, come here. Where do you think you're going? Hello, Mike. Get back there. I can't bring Gallant Lady out like this. She's too nervous. Get off the platform. Get back, will you? Officer, do your duty. Don't tell me what to do. Okay, Mr. Whitehall. All right, get her out of here. The pony first. Bring her out. Keep her head down, watch her feet. Thats a beautiful animal. She'll win the Derby. Make way. Hello, Mr. Morgan. Dan Brooks, remember me? How are you? Fine, thank you. Who you betting on? Gallant Lady, of course. Don't put your money down yet, I may have some use for it. We were betting on Sun Up. Why not broadcast it? Don't be a sucker, you haven't a chance with that horse. Try some small races first. I'm coming back in style. Nobody knows anything about Broadway Bill, and if he wins... You don't believe he can beat Gallant Lady, do you? Why not? In his first race? I know what he can do. How much is the entry? I give up. You must have rapped your senses in paper boxes. Its a $25,000 race. Thats cheap enough. You make out the check? Now? You can do it the day before the race, its in 2 weeks. Yes, I'm having funds transferred. You've got to nominate him before 6 o'clock, today. How much? I'll be right back. How much money you got? Money? Yeah, bring it out. You've come to the wrong place. I got this one, sad and lonesome dollar. I'm short 5. Bring it up. Yes. I'm the poorest man you ever did see. See that? If there's any money there, I'd be surprised. Bless my soul! Thats what I say. Hey, boot, you ain't my pocketbook no more. Your receipt. Thanks. How about a stable? I had one left and just gave it to Gallant Lady. Whitehall insisted on having it to himself. He'd take Gallant Lady out of the race if... Without Gallant Lady you wouldn't have an attraction. Thats it. Go over and see Pop Jones. He hangs out around the warehouse. He's got an old barn. Okay, thanks. I'm awfully sorry. Broadway Bill's been brought up in a barn all his life. Good luck. Thanks. What do we eat with? When I get hungry, I get hungry. When you're hungry, eat. Can't go without food. Ain't gonna do my stomach no good. Where we get the money to buy it with? We'll have to rely on the old man with the whiskers. Who that? A miracle man. When he puts his arm around you, you're troubles are over. A good man to meet up with. Looks all right, Pop. We've had some pretty fine horses here. Yeah? Who's the feed man here? Hey? The feed man? Feed man? Yes. Right here. I want a supply of stuff sent in. Some oats, bran, barley, carrots and... about 10 pounds of salt. For cash or credit? What do you mean? Don't you trust me? I don't know you... I settle all my bills at the end of the week. I need cash... And a couple of cots, Pop. Hey? A couple of cots. Cots? Something you sleep on. To sleep here? You don't think...? You don't know it, but there's the winner of the Derby. Think I'll let him stay by himself? I'll show you how you can clean up a bankroll. That horse is a sleeper. A what? A sleeper. You want a cot for the horse too? You hear Pop? You're quite a kidder. Come on, its feeding time. Whitey. Yes? We gotta get to the bank and make that deposit. Thats for sure. You still here? We got to get that feed in. Hurry up. How was that? He fell like a log. A little slow though. See his eyes? The old man with the whiskers is working already. Mr. Brooks! Them clothes sure is elegant. Think Colonel Pettigrew will be impressed? Colonel Pettigrew? Who that? A gentleman, Whitey. With great understanding and a soul. A man to borrow money from, if he has it. Borrow? When I borrow I were my old close, my rundown shoes. You got funny ideas. Thats the secret. Never look down and out, no matter how hungry you are. You sure got the secret. If he's got money, you'll get it. All he's got to do is look at them clothes. Colonel Pettigrew. I hope he's got 500 bucks. Colonel Pettigrew? Yes? Take your feet off my chair. Yes, my love. A fortune. Just by investing the sum of $50. Stop dreaming. Where you gonna get $50? You can be very annoying. Don't do us no good with those phone numbers you're popping. Thats 5,000 you owe me. Double or nothing. No you don't. Last season I had you up to $80,000. I traded, didn't I? For a buck and a quarter. But in cash. See if you can find a flaw. I read fairy tales at night. It won't be when I get the 50. Then go to work. I'll have it without work. Where from, vinegarpuss? Colonel Pettigrew. Yes, my love. A man who races horses... Dan Brooks, a very dear friend of mine. Anybody had $50 wouldn't be a friend of yours. Dan Brooks' got a thousand times 50 and never turned me down. We're his guests at lunch today. He'll buy us lunch? At the Ritz Hotel. Colonel! My old and trusted friend! Glad to see ya. Meet my business associate Oscar McGuire, known as Happy. This is Dan Brooks. How do you do? How are you? Come on, sit down. Its been a long time. Yes. I'm a starving man. Bring me the whole lunch. I'll take the same, please. The same for you, sir? I'm not here to make a speech. Right, sir. Colonel, you look fine. I hear you're rolling in wealth. Just soso. Don't believe all the stories you hear. I was talking to the boys and they agree. You know they exaggerate. How about you? Holding my own, thats all. Don't be modest. Racing horses again, aren't ya? Just keep my hand in. Thats what I always said about you. I always said: Dan Brooks? A lad who'll come through. How long does this go on? Don't mind him, Friday the 13th. Here's your soup... and one more soup. I'm glad I run into you, Dan. I got a proposition to clean up $160,000, and want you in on it. That so? Just for old time sake. Thats nice of you. Nothing at all. I'll need a little financing though. You'll need what? With a start of $50, I got a pile of... You're not by any chance trying to borrow $50 from me, are you? Not borrow, exactly. Wait a minute. I came here to borrow $500. Don't tell me you're broke? Yes, totally. And you came...? Yeah. And I came...? Yeah. Thats the funniest! Whats son funny about that? Everything satisfactory? Yeah. How broke are you? A veritable pauper. Not even enough for the meal? No. How about you? No. No, no, no! Gentlemen, we're in a situation. I haven't been thrown out of a place like this in years. You finished, gentlemen? Yes, quite. Finished? Yes. Waiter. Come here. Whats the idea? I'll never come here again! I'm so sorry. Here they are, redhot. You're a good trader. Its not the size I wanted. What did you expect for a hamburger, a telephone pole? I ain't kickin', but... I ought to have a hat. Give you a Coke for the hat. Don't like Coke. A pie for the tie. Forget the tie. You have to have dessert. Look. We may be in for dinner tonight. Spats. You should ought to see me in spats. There we go. I'm a sight for sore eyes. Another hamburger for the spats. Maybe tonight. Okay, dinner tonight for the hat, spats and tie. Its a deal. We got a little business. You mind? Oh, sure. If you got anything for my wife... Bring her in and we'll cut her up. Smart guy, huh? What now? Raising $500 is no childs play. You're a great disappointment. From what you say, Broadway Bill must be a superb animal. If I can get him in that race. Don't worry, thats as good as done. My time and wisdom are devoted to your welfare. I'm sorry for you. I got an ace in the hole, Edna. A 50 to 1 shot. You got to marry her first. Who's Edna? That vinegarpuss landlady at the boarding house. Why she expect to marry you? I encouraged her. An economic necessity, you know. Thatll give you an idea of what I've been driven to. Driven to, my eye. He'd rather make false love to her than to go to work. Trouble is he's got a landlady in every town in the country. Its kept me in food and lodging for years. And you too. Do you think she'd fall for a Ford truck? Thats a perfect mating. Quiet! I'm not kiddin', Happy. I got a Ford truck I want to sell for $35. But we need 500. There are small races tomorrow with $500 stakes. If we win one, we're home. Broadway Bill is a breeze. We need $35 for expenses. 10 for a jockey, 25 for nomination. An inspiration. Thats as good as in the bag. Vinegarpuss will own a Ford truck... even if I have to make the supreme sacrifice. Bravo! Its a long shot. Got to try it. Is this it? Yes. Sturdy and dependable. What is it? Does it look like a lawnmower? Might as well be. Come on, beloved, Broadway Bill's in the 2nd race. Oh, darling! I couldn't sleep last night thinking of you. You make love so beautifully! Thats only the beginning. Lets go. Give them plenty of start. I can still hear them. Whats the matter? They've been there 10 minutes. Having trouble with Broadway Bill. Turn him round there. Hold him. Get back there. Turn him around and bring him in here. Guess he ain't ready yet. Sure he is. Nervous in his first race. He'll outrun them all. Hold him! Don't let him through. Number 5. That horse is half nuts. Joe, we're going home. Thats the end of Broadway Bill in this race. Don't let him start again. AII right. Poor Dan. I wonder what he's going to do with Broadway Bill now. Hello, darling. Hello. Thats a nice robe. Thank you. Any news from Dan? I had a letter from him. Whats he say? All about being sorry, hopes I understand... He still loves me, wishes I'd join him. I think that was about all... the rest of its about a rooster. Skeeter? What did you call him? Skeeter. I gave him that name. Broadway Bill won't run without him. 3 pages devoted to a rooster, and one to me. Thats a perfect division. Did you send Skeeter to him? Of course not. Broadway Bill needs him. Don't be silly, he'll be back soon. Maybe this trip's what he needed. He'd never get it off his chest. Margaret... I... Please don't mind if I talk to you about this. I know its presuming of me to give you advice. But, please don't do it. Do what? Don't give him up. I haven't given him up. But you're thinking about it. Why not stay with him. You'll not find someone as... What are you getting so excited about? He loves you. Doesn't that mean anything? If Dan loves me, he'll come back. You're homesick, pal. He won't perk up till that rooster comes. She gonna send him? I don't know. She hasn't answered my letter. Skeeter! Skeeter! Princess! God, its good to see you! Look out for Skeeter! I almost crushed him. Hello, Skeeter! Bill, here's your boyfriend! Look who's come to see you. I told you I'd bring him back. Look, Bill. Skeeter, get up there. Take them out for a walk. He missed Skeeter? He was down in the dumps. Horses get that way sometimes. They get stuck on a mascot. Princess, you're a lifesaver. Lets take a walk. Come on. Lets take a walk. Sit down and tell me about it. How's Margaret? Margaret? She's all right. She's coming down? I'm afraid not. She wanted to but Matilda got the grip. You know Matilda, always sick at the wrong time. Thats too bad. You didn't have to come. Margaret asked me to come. She did? Well, give her a big kiss for me when you get back. I'm not going back. What? Come on! You're taking the next train back to Higginsville. Says who? Says me. How much money you got? I need $25 to enter Bill in the race tomorrow. I'll leave you some. Thats me, bighearted Dan. Its not Higgins' money? No, its mine. I can't take Higgins' money. Come on, beat it. I'm staying till the race is over. You can't hang around a racetrack town like this. Don't be so patronizing. Whatll the emperor think? Hang the emperor! Another revolutionary, huh? First the crown prince consort, then the little princess. Lo the poor emperor! You getting to be quite a little dish. Will I have difficulty here? What do you think? Go out and get myself a peasant and get married. Don't do that, Princess. Save yourself for me. When Margaret throws me out, you and I'll hit the road together. Nice idea, if my peasant doesn't object. Who is he? That guy back home? Come on, tell papa. Don't be so smart! He's perfect! He's 11 feet tall, has no ears and eats babies. Princess! Princess, look here! You know me enough to take a little kidding. Pay no attention to what I say about your peasant. You can marry anybody you like. I ought to sock you for taking me so seriously. Lets give Bill a workout. Hold it! Put him in number 6, Joe. Let nobody through. Hold it. Hold him back, now. Come on! He's getting it now. Bring him tomorrow. See what that rooster makes? Saddle the rooster. Might have a better chance. Put him in number 8. Don't stop him this time. I want to clock him. Back him up a little. Come on! Bring him in the morning... Thanks What he do it in? Go get him and cool him out. Here comes a spy from the Confederate Army. What do you want, Mata Hari? Glad you stopped around, Pop. We just clocked him. How about that feed bill? Know what he made it in? I don't give a hang! I want that feed bill paid. You worrying about a little thing like that? All I've been getting is promises. I always keep my promises. I can't pay my bills with promises. If I don't get my money, I'm going to the law! Colonel Pettigrew will guarantee all my bills. Right? Of course I guarantee that. How much is it, $1,000? Don't pay it now. All Pop wants is your guarantee. He's a stranger to me. What? You don't know Colonel Pettigrew? Can you imagine? He's one of the biggest men... I don't care! I want my money! I'll let you in on a good thing. You know what Broadway Bill made the mile in? 1:37. He made the mile in 1:27! Why tell him that? I thought this was on the Q.T. I have a good mind to withdraw my $25,000. Don't get excited. I didn't invest $25,000 for you to slip information to... a pennyantie feed man. Pop Jones is a friend of mine. I don't care if he's your brother! He can be trusted. You can trust him, I won't! I'm through! Please! Let him go, I'll take his share. You've got $50,000 in already. Your horse is good enough. I'll write you a check. Hope I haven't caused you any trouble, Mr. Brooks. If you know whats good for you, leave Dan Brooks alone. Anyone who looks to the Lord will find heaven. Heaven. Heaven. I want to walk with the Lord... to heaven. Whats going on here? A little vocal gymnastics. I mean you. What are you doing here? Whats it look like? Get back to your hotel. You hang around here too much. Get washed, dinner will be ready in a minute. Is this s girls seminary? You'd better put on some pants. What about these? Where'd you get those? From your bag. My only pair of dungarees. Take them off. Mr. Brooks, please! You little mug, ya. You're kind of cute in that. Sure, ravishing. Sailors swoon at the sight of me. You've grown up, too. Some guy's gonna cop you off. That peasant guy, maybe. Bill Taylor. What about Bill Taylor? I've got work to do. When did you eat last? Whitey says you don't eat. I have plenty to eat. You can't win races if you don't eat. I'm not running. Where'd you get these? Only a few supplies. Oh, boy, Princess! You're a little angel from heaven! I married the wrong woman. What will we open tonight? Which one? Oh... the split pea soup and the succot. The split pea soup... and the succot. The split pea soup and the succot. The split pea soup and the succot... had a fight upon a timer. Said the split pea soup to the succot: Without corn you'd just be lima. Oh, lima. Lima. Without corn you'd just be lima. Get out of here! What makes you so happy? Happy? Well, I'll tell you. Because the old man with the whiskers got his arm around me. Because we entered Bill in the $500 race tomorrow... with the money you forced on me. Because I've got a winner, and our troubles are over. Gosh darn, you're not very much yourself now. You're not very much yourself now. What rimes with self? Molasses? I ought to let you have it. You want to win that race? You'll never know how much. You will, I'm sure of it. Got my fingers crossed. I know you have. I got to get the money to do things. Buy more horses, train them right. I may even go in for breeding. Sounds wonderful! I'm going to have the finest thoroughbreds in the country. Its starting to rain. Put Bradshaw on! Mr. Whitehall. How's Gallant Lady? Its raining hard. Make sure all the windows are shut. We don't want her catching any colds. She's liable to catch pneumonia. She won't. She's as snug as a bug in a rug. Right, I'll hop to it. Check those windows. Go on, hop to it. Go was up. Dinner will be ready in a minute. Rain's coming in. Margaret wants to be sure, and its up to me. Rain's coming in. What? The roof is leaking. The roof's leaking? Yes, sir. Holy smokes! It was clear a minute ago. That don't matter. Whoa, Bill. Get up there and stuff that up. Its getting on Bill. Don't be long, dinner's ready. There's another one to your left. Stuff it up. Hurry up! Whoa, Bill! Whitey! Come on down. Help me close these doors. What a storm! Close that door! Whoa! Go to the Whitehall stables, see if they got a stall for Bill... just for tonight. Hurry up! Whoa, Bill. I'll get you dry. These are soaking wet. We have to take them off. Boss! Couldn't get a thing. What do you mean? Did you tell them this is like a sieve? Yes, but they run me out. They did? I did my best. Keep Bill dry! Yes, sir. Where are you going? What are you gonna do? Plug up those holes. Here. Hot in here! Have a look at that thermostat. Mike, turn down that radio. But real soft. Cheer up, Gallant Lady, the storm will soon be over. Whitey, get dry rags. Poor darling. You won't catch cold, will you? Poor darling. Its cold again. What time is it? 4 o'clock. Get some sleep. I'm wide awake. Go to bed. You'll be all right tomorrow. Whitey, come take care of Bill. You're going to bed. I don't want to. Never mind. Come on. I don't want to. I'm not sleepy. Stop arguing and get off that wet coat. Sit down. You ought to be in your hotel, nice and warm. Lay down. Thanks, Dan. You're a sweet kid, Princess. Dan. Yeah? Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right. Sure. Yeah. Come on, doctor, right in here. Sick animal. Bad? Yep. Running a high fever. Needs care and rest. Looks so pathetic. It may be some time before he runs. I'll send the medicine back with the boy. Doc! What about Saturday? He's got to run. Thats the big race. Saturday? I don't know. Animals are very funny. Sometimes they snap out of it like this... Don't take him out 'till the fever's disappeared. Even then, don't work him too hard. Give his heart a chance. Rest him up 'till the last minute. Come on, boy. I know. Its Alice I'm worried about. What did she go for? She took him a pet rooster. Sounds insane! Thats no place for her! Little imp! I sent her a telegram ordering her to come home. She replies: ""Having a good time. Back after races."" We got to get her back. Don't bother, she'll be back. And so will Dan. What makes you think so? Thats why I came to see you. I know others want to manage the paper box factory. Leave the others out of this. They forget that I'm the eldest daughter. I can't keep his job open indefinitely. You owe it to me. It was your fault that he left. My fault he doesn't like paper boxes? You thought you'd order him around, like the others. Thats very interesting. You may not know it, but people are laughing at me. They're saying I have a horse for a rival. And the horse won out. I've got to stop that blabbering. You think he's coming back? I know he is. Don't be so cocksure. Go down there with him. Thats a fine attitude for you. He's your husband. When he's here at home. You won't let Dan down. A cold can't stop you. Don't be a sickie. Get up. Get up. Come on, get up. Try to get up. Come on, get up! Come on, try. Come on. Ah, thats it. Come on, boy, come on.

It too many people bet, it brings the odds down. I promise not to bet much. Just enough to get even. Sorry, stranger. I didn't want the Colonel to see me. How'd you like to have the name of that horse? How would I like it? Cost you $25. Okay, forget it. Wait a minute. I could lose my job. Its a lot of money, but... Make it snappy. Here, $25.

Maybe its the Greek. The Greek's with us. Where's it come from? Use your brain. Every bet on Broadway Bill is a 2buck bet. Does that sound like wise money? It was 50 to 1. Meat for suckers. Barbers, maids scrambled to get aboard. Before you know, all losers hock their undershirts. I've seen it happen a million times. Sack money... I still don't like it.

It drives him crazy to be held back. He's got plenty of wind. Sounds great. Go get dressed, got to be on time. Take power cause you're riding a winner! Sure. Man with the whiskers, I thank you! Princess, we can't lose! I feel like dancing! So do I. Go ahead. The split pea soup... Got her doing it. Fell in love one spring and summer. The split pea soup caught the succotash on a dormer You want an honest race? I don't like this implication of my jockey. We spend a fortune every year on detectives. Why? To break honest. If not, we'll close up the track. What makes you think my boy's involved? I had Morgan and his men trailed. I was determined to know what he had up his sleeve. I found out. Its your jockey, Roberts. Thats the works. How much we got down? 100,000, average 12 to 1. Over a million bucks. Its the one we've been waiting for, and I'll take care of you. Boss, Roberts has been suspended. He ain't gonna ride Gallant Lady. How'd you find out? I saw it on the bulletin. They got Bobby North. Somebody smelled a rat. This is a mess. I knew this was too good to be true. On Gallant Lady. Gallant Lady. $50 on Gallant Lady. She's gonna win. $50 on Gallant Lady. $50 on Gallant Lady. The horses are now at the padder. You'll do your stuff, Bill. Don't let the fever bother you. Doc said you were all right. You know what this race means to us. Saddle your horses. I'm interested in one horse. Sunup, number 5. Beat him and you win this race. He's a tough customers. He might try anything. Gallant Lady must win this race. He won't get away with a thing. One horse you gotta beat, Gallant Lady. I don't care how. You've won lots of races. Win this one, $5,000 for you. Use your head, or anything else necessary. You understand? Yes, sir. If anyone gets in front of you... swing around on the outside. Don't worry about loss of time. One thing you got to remember. You listening? Yes. Don't hold him back. I've got to win this race. My whole future depends on it. I can't explain it to you but, good luck. Good luck to you. Jockeys up. Remember, its up to you. If your smart, you'll cop this race. Well, Bill, its up to you now. What are you shaking for? Who's shaking? Its a thrilling sight, the grandstands are packed... the blood pressure is running high and... and the great question today is... who will win the Derby? Until a few days ago, Gallant Lady was an outstanding favorite. Since then, for some mysterious reason... Broadway Bill has received terrific support. Overnight, the odds went down from 100 to 1, to 6 to 1. Thats what makes horse racing. If he wins the race he's not coming back? Wouldn't you like to know. Thats the way, Skeeter. Lets go see a good race. They're going on to the track. Won't be long now. We've got to win. If we don't, its ""goodbye, Colonel"". Whats the matter? My heads in a noose! I promised I'd marry her if Broadway Bill loses. You can always change your mind. She made him put it in writhing. It can't be done. I'm slightly married already. With who? To another in Deytonia. In a moment of... I'm sure that time the horse forgot what he came for. I've got to get back to that skylark. So long and luck. Thanks. The guy that puts his dough... on them actually believes in fairies. Pay no attention to him. Good luck. Thanks, Princess. Well, here we go. I may be on my way back to Higginsville in a while. Don't think about that. You'll win. Whats the matter with you? Nothing. Nothing. Good luck, darling. There's Sunup! There's your horse! Shut up and sit down. I'm going to go see him start. I wish I knew how this was gonna end. Broadway Bill look all right. Why worry? I don't think he was ever sick. He looks all right. I got a bet on him. I got plenty on him. Excuse me, lady. Did you bet on Broadway Bill? If you didn't, you're crazy. They're getting ready. $2 on Broadway Bill. Broadway Bill. Fill this out. May as well go crazy with the rest of the world. What do you want? What? Your bet? Broadway Bill on the nose. Your bet? Gallant Lady, of course. Me too. Now they're at the barrier of a mile and a quarter. A sport of kings, one of the oldest sports. Gallant Lady, the favorite. Sunup, a great money horse. Broadway Bill, who threw his jockey... Johnson! Some say Dan Brooks has a screw loose for entering him. But we'll keep an eye on him. Any Scotch in the house? No, sir. Get some. Get some! Yes, sir. I think they're ready for the bell now. Keep your eyes open. Anything's liable to happen. Don't forget to break, Bill. He's in the vanguard! Broadway Bill first, Gallant Lady second! Come on, Bill! Oh, boy! Thats the baby! Let go of his head! I told him not to hold him! You're holding him, . You're holding him! You're holding him! Gallant Lady's got it made. Old man with the whiskers. Put your arm around me! Hey! I'll throw you over the fence! You're crazy! Come on! Let go of that bit! Let go of him! Let go of that bit! Come on, Bill! You can win! Come on, Broadway Bill! Yeah, Broadway Bill! Broadway Bill is coming up fast. He's 4th by half length. Broadway Bill! Friend of the lost souls, come on! Come on, Bill, thats it! They're on the last stretch. Come on, Bill! Come on, Bill! Get out of the way! Come on, Bill! Pull back, are you crazy? I can't hold him! Come on, Bill! Come on, Sunup! Go, Bill! Come on! Yes, sir! He did it! Bill! There's a horse down. Don't invade the track. Everybody keep back, you know how dangerous it is. Get back now. What are you doing? Don't you know thats dangerous? Keep off the track! Let me in! Thats my horse! Get back, everybody. What happened? This way, Doc. Are you a doctor? A veterinary? What happened? What happened, Doc? Broadway Bill fell. He was over, he won, and then dropped. Whats the matter with him? Just a minute. Too much for him, burst his heart. He was dead when he hit the dirt. Too bad! A picture, please. Get back. Get those men out of here. Everybody, back. Tough break, kid. These old eyes have seen some great horses, but I... Off the track, everybody. Princess. Dan. Don't cry. The winner of the Imperial Derby. We are grateful to Mr. Brooks for permitting us to... lay Broadway Bill to rest on these grounds. So that his fine spirit may always be with us. What he did yesterday was a lesson in courage and loyalty. The ideal and purpose of horse racing... is to teach us lessons like this. If we profit by them... then racing is something more than a sport. Broadway Bill must never be forgotten. Mr. Brooks. I'll have to say goodbye now, Dan. Going home? But you won't. No. I guess I'm on my way. Good luck. You've been swell, Princess, you've helped me. Thanks, Dan. There's Dad. Dan! JL. Margaret come down with you? No. She counted on your coming back to Higginsville now that... Yeah, I see. She figures this is a stroke of luck. I'm not going back, JL. Well... Margaret will be a hard girl to leave Higginsville, Dan. Maybe she shouldn't. Maybe you're right. Nothing seems to matter anymore. Take Alice back home. Thats my decision and its final. Whats gotten over you? I understand selling the factory when Dan and I were divorced, but selling all of them is absurd. Now the ironworks. And the bank. Not the bank! Not the bank! In 2 years you got rid of everything. Its mine to get rid of if I want to. I'm giving them back to the people that founded them. I'm a man, not a whale that gobbles up minos. You're forcing us out. Whatll become of us? You'll have to go to work. Go out and find jobs. I wan soninlaws that are men, not dependents. I want...! Its Dan! Its Mr. Brooks. ""Release the princess from that tower"", he said. Don't be an idiot like your sister. Go on. Hello! Dan! Hello! Hello, Princess! Its good to see you. Look, Broadway Bill II... and the Princess. Dan! We're headed for Letonia. Come on. Goodby, Dad! Hello, Whitey. Wait for me! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Now listen, men. Spring is here... and spring is a dangerous time of the year, especially in Paris. The wanderlust is in the air. Travelers are coming here from everywhere - from Cincinnati and Singapore. - Now, what do they come for? -  We know. That's right. Chicago packers don't come here for a plate of cold cuts. Big planters don't come from Brazil just for nuts. From Norway and Sweden, they don't come here to fish. But whether they come from Amsterdam or Birmingham or Siam... we let them do whatever they wish. We let them play in any way... as long as they're willing to pay.  That's okay. But spring is here. And after dark, our cafs are empty. But every park has standing room only every night. - Now that's wrong. - That's right. The situation is not funny. Our best cafs are losing money. We must clean up the public parks. We must clean up the public parks. Here's your slogan: Cleaner parks and more prosperity.  Cleaner parks. Cleaner parks. More prosperity. More prosperity. Come on.

Madame Bertier. - So you're married, eh? - Yes, Officer. And you expect me to believe that? - Oh, please. - Please. Now let me tell you something. You're the only married couple in this park.  Get out! Well, there's only one other place to go. Why not? Listen, Officer. Do you see that moon? If he could talk French, do you know what he would say to you? Phooey. Ladies and gentlemen, I must talk to you. This is a very delicate situation. There is Colette, and here am I. And I know what you think. Oh! I know. How dare you. You remember that policeman? He was wrong. And so are you. Believe it or not, we are married. I am her husband. And she is my wife. And I can prove it to you. Oh, look. This is a picture of our wedding. Myself and the bridesmaids. And this is my wife. Before the wedding, naturally. And look at this lady. My mother-in-law. A marvelous cook. In other words, I am married, and I like it. I'm sorry to disappoint you. Now, gentlemen, as a doctor... let me ask you a personal question. How long since you have been in a park? I mean - I mean, with your wife. Ah. Ladies, that's what's wrong. Build up your park life to ensure your home life.  Darling. That's for me. Sweetheart. That's for her. I'll be with you in a minute. That's for both of us.

The gentleman reading a newspaper.  The lady looking out of the window.  Explain that to your wife. She won't believe it! Would you believe it? - Never! - I wouldn't believe it myself. No, and let me tell you something. My husband wouldn't believe it either. Your-Y-Your- Oh, m-madame, we're in a terrible situation. Oh, we're as good as guilty. All the facts are against us. What shall we do? Throw your newspaper away and let us face the facts. Madame. Monsieur. Driver, stop!  Madame, you may think I'm a coward. I am! - Mitzi! - Colette!  Darling!  You look marvelous!  Oh, Mitzi, my darling. How have you been? I haven't seen you since that day in Lausanne. I've so much to tell you I can hardly begin. But werert we happy and gay in Lausanne? You look just as smart and as stunning as then. Oh, I'm much wiser, though, thanks to several men. Oh, how's the composer you went with so much? He's gone, but he had such a wonderful touch. And the painter who painted you all draped in gauze? One night I found out what an artist he was.  Your boudoir's adorable, simply divine. And that bed - It's too gorgeous. I wish it were mine. My favorite perfume. Femme de Paris. Yes. Andre's so generous. He gave it to me. - Ah. - Oh, I must show you my new lingerie. Too stunning for only a husband to see. - Those dresses - how thrilling! - Yes, they're really quite fair. I was just telling Andre how I've nothing to wear. - Ah? - Of course, these are his. Oh, they're as cute as can be. But where is the rest of them? Oh, pardon me. - Well - - Colette!  I buy all his things, and believe it or not, he wears even the ties. - Well, he must love you a lot. - How's the professor? - Which one do you mean? - The one that you married. - Oh, he's still on the scene. - You don't sound so happy. Unless you're well mated, this business of marriage is much overrated. Oh, Mitzi, you don't know how sorry I feel. As for Andre and me - well, he's just too ideal. He sets me atingle. I set him aflame. #And no matter what happens # #We still stay the same # # Day after day # #We will always be sweethearts the same # #As the day we began # # Do what he may # #We will always be sweethearts # # For he is my boy # #And my man # # He kisses me and my lips are so willing # # But we both agree # #That each time it's more thrilling # #And so I can say # #We will always be sweethearts the same # #As the day # #We began ##  Darling. This is Mitzi. And this is Andre. I'm - I'm extremely happy, madame. Doctor, the pleasure's mine.  My very best friend and... - my very, very husband. -  Don't you like her? Oh, y-yes. Oh, yes. I - I like her.   Look at him. Look at him.  Oh. No. Isn't he darling? I think he's cute. Oh, please. Oh! -  You mean to tell me - -   - He can? - Yes, he can. - No! - I tell you he can! Let's see him do it. Darling, look like an owl. - Oh, no. - Oh, please, darling. Please. - No, no. - Oh, please do, Dede. - Oh, no, no. - Oh, please, Doctor. Look like an owl. - Oh, now, madame. Will you - No. - Yes, please do. - I can't do it - No, no, no. - Please. Please, Doctor. Madame, luncheon is served. It's about time. - After lunch you'll do it? - You will do it for me? - No, no. Really, I - - Mitzi, I hope you have a good appetite. - Do you play Ping-Pong? - Oh. Now, now stop it.  My wife thinks I am a darling. And my wife's friend thinks I'm cute.  It's a terrible situation. But I am determined not to weaken. We'll see.  Oh, madame. Oh, call lyses 0546. Tell Dr. Bertier to come. - Yes, madame. At once. - Describe my condition. - Tell him you fear the worst. - Oh, madame! Madame, what happened? Please tell me. Tell me. Come on. Do as I tell you. lyses 0546. Tell Dr. Bertier to come. Now hurry up. Hurry up. Oh!  lyses 0546.  Hello. Yes? Yes? What? What? She's sick? Oh. Oh, yes. Mitzi's sick. Tell her I'm too tired. Uh, what? Well, yes. Yes. Naturally. She wants the doctor right away. Can't she make it tomorrow? Just a minute, please. Andre, this is no time for joking. But why should I go? Let her get another doctor. Let her get two other doctors. I don't want to mix business with Mitzi. He doesn't want to mix business with you. - Why can't you be nice to my friends? - But this is business. This is different. - You hate her. - Oh, darling, don't be ridiculous. - I have nothing against her. - I know you hate her. - But why should I hate her? - Well, you certainly don't like her. I'm crazy about her! - Then why don't you want to go? - Because I don't want to mix ""musiness"" with Bitzi. Business with Mitzi. Oh, Mitzi, Kitzi, Bitzi.  All right. I'll go. Yes, Madame Bertier. Yes. Thank you. The doctor's coming. Oh!  Good-bye, sweetheart. Good-bye, darling. And remember. No matter what she has - heart trouble, appendicitis... rheumatism, neuritis - I love you. ## ## ## Oh!  Madame, you sent for me. I want it to be clearly understood that you're sick. Oh, Doctor.

This is Dr. Bertier. My husband, Professor Olivier. Dr. Bertier? Dr. Bertier, physician. Professor Olivier. Ancient history. - Doctor. - Professor.  Ah.  Ah, yes.  - Ah.  -  Darling, I'm not feeling very well. Why should you? Oh, no, Professor. Madame is in a very serious condition. Why-Why shouldn't she be? Conditions are bad everywhere.

You are the husband of my wife's best friend. And I am the husband of your wife's best friend. I am looking forward to a very happy Christmas. Now get out. - Hurry. Hurry.

It's 7:30. I have a million things to do. This is no time for silly conversation. Hmm? Hmm?  Colette, am I sitting next to you tonight? Colette, tonight, next to you? Now, Adolph, listen. You're Andre's closest friend. You were best man at our wedding. That's as far as I'll go. What? Romeo? You're coming as Romeo? Yes. Yes, Romeo. Of Romeo and Juliet. What? What? Not a costume party. Oh. Oh, all right. - Marcel. - Yes, sir? Why did you tell me it was to be a costume party? Ah, monsieur. I did so want to see you in tights. Uh, I don't think that Martel girl is so attractive. I do. All right. All right. I - I - I won't argue with you.  Everybody- Everybody is entitled to his own opinion. That's what makes the world go round. For instance - For instance, take Russia. Darling, I swear I've been true to you. Why did you change those place cards? Sweetheart, you know I love you - and only you. Why did you change those place cards? If I tell you the truth, would you believe it? No.  Darling, I'm going.  Good-bye, angel. Sorry I can't go with you. Are you staying out late tonight, precious? Yes, beloved. I don't think I'll be home before morning. Aw, that's too bad. Good-bye, sweetheart. Good-bye, darling. - What are you doing tonight? - Nothing, madame. - Wouldrt you like to go out? - No, madame. I'm too tired. Too tired? For a little dance and a good time? - Not really. - Yes, madame. - You can have the night off. - I'm sorry, madame, but really I'm too tired. Other girls are grateful for a day off, and you -you're too tired. Oh, you're a most unreasonable girl and most ungrateful. - Oh, but I - - Oh, be quiet. ##   Mitzi, I suspect Andre. Colette. You know what I found out? How should I know? He didn't want to sit next to you tonight. - And you know why? - Why? He wanted to sit next to Mademoiselle Martel. Uh-huh. What do you mean, ""Uh-huh""? - Have you heard anything? - Now, Colette, darling. I believe Andre is absolutely faithful. I don't care what people say. People say? - So everybody knows. - Oh. - Oh, tell me, Mitzi. Tell me everything. - Darling. Darling. There's absolutely nothing to tell. Nothing definite.  There she is. Look at that dress. - Terrible. - Ghastly. - And look at the way she wears her hair. - Bleached. Ah, madame. Oh. Oh, my dear. How are you? I'm so glad to see you. - You look perfectly stunning. - Do you really think so? Oh, gorgeous. I'm simply crazy about that dress. And you're looking so well too. You must have gained. Hello, Andre. Where is Colette? - What's the matter? - I want to say ""How do you do?"" to her. Dinner is served.   Let's be happy. Let's be gay. Come on. Let's drink and be merry. Let's have a good time. - Are you talking to me? - Yes, Romeo. Oh. Oh, Colette.  ##  Colette, when are we going to dance? Oh, when are we going to be gay? When are we going to have all that fun? Hmm?

Mitzi, don't be so Mitzi. Why do you do that? I can't tie a tie. I never could tie a tie. But I can tie a tie... and how. - There you are. -  Just a sample. Mitzi! Mitzi! Mitzi, my tie! ## Pardon me. I'm a prisoner on my own veranda. If I go inside, my wife sees me... and I get into trouble. If I go to the garden to Mitzi, I get into trouble too. But anyhow, I get my tie fixed. What shall I do? I go inside, my wife sees me, and I get into trouble. I go to the garden to Mitzi, I get into trouble, too, but anyhow, I get my tie fixed. I go inside, my wife sees me, I get into trouble. I go to the garden to Mitzi, I get in trouble, too, but anyhow, I get my tie fixed.  I go inside, my wife sees me, I get into trouble. I go to the garden to Mitzi, I get into trouble, too, but anyhow, I get my tie fixed. I go inside, my wife sees me, I get into trouble. I go to the garden to Mitzi -  I get my tie fixed. A night in May. Look at the moon. Colette, how does the moon affect you? It turns me inside out and upside down. I tell you, if I didn't have such a splendid education, I'd - I'd yield to the animal in me. Yes, I - I admit I come of a very fine family. Well, should a refined gentleman not have any luck? Does one have to be a roughneck to get along in the world? I wonder where Andre is. I love you, Colette. Colette, I love you. Let's - Let's - Let's run away. Let's live. - You're still a young woman. - Andre! My tie. My tie. - Andre. - Andre! Andre? Andre?  Oh!    - We had a most delightful time, Doctor. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good night, Andre. - Good night. - Thank you. Good night, Dr. Bertier. I had a perfectly charming evening. - Thank you so much. - It was a pleasure, madame. I'll be waiting in a taxi on the next corner for five minutes. Impossible. - Ten minutes. - Ridiculous. All right. Fifteen minutes. Positively maybe. Good-bye, madame. - Good night. - Good night. #Why did I kiss that Mitzi # # I still can feel it yet # #And now I'm in a spot And what a spot # # For right out there is Mitzi and right up there Colette # # Should I be brave and misbehave or not # # Should I say yes or no # # Should I stay home or go # #Why should I be afraid to fall # # I'm only human after all # # I love Colette # # I'm crazy for Colette # # But, oh, that Mitzi # # I kiss Colette # #And I get all upset # # But, oh, that Mitzi # #To stay or go I really can't decide # # But this I know We can't all three be satisfied # # I love Colette I haven't weakened yet # # But, oh, that Mitzi # # Some girls are slow Some even answer ""no"" # # But, oh, that Mitzi # # Some girls are cool and others only fool # # But, oh, that Mitzi # #There's no mistake about the way she clings # #Why, she could make an angel throw away his wings # #And yet I claim Colette can do the same # # But, oh, that Mitzi ##  Why don't you go back to Mademoiselle Martel? -  Oh, darling. - It may be a joke to you, but it - Our romance is over.  Oh, darling. If I wanted to start something with Mademoiselle Martel... would I do it here? Couldrt I call her to my office? So, that's what goes on in your office! Darling, we have been married for three years. And for three years, you've gone to your office every day. Sweetheart, take my word - This Martel girl - - I don't believe you! - I demand that you believe me. I saw what I saw.   Let's not talk about it. Let me take you in my arms. I love you. You're lying!  - Darling, if you don't believe me - -  If you don't believe me, in two and a half minutes, I'm going out. Oh. So you're threatening me, are you? All right. Go out. Darling, I warn you, I'm going. I heard you. Go! All right. - I'm going. - My compliments to Mademoiselle Martel. Andre! Andre! Andre!

You'll have to call louder than that if you want Andre to hear you. But if you want Adolph, all you have to do is whisper. Oh.  Sorrow makes you look even more beautiful. Thank you, Adolph. More feminine... younger. - Do you really think so? - I do, Colette. Oh, thank you, Adolph.  Any man who leaves a woman like you... on a night like this, with a man like me... deserves it. But it was my fault. I was wrong. You have a right to be wrong. You're a woman. Women are born to be wrong. I like my women wrong. You poor, lonely little thing. Oh, I'm so unappy. - You need love. - Yes. Love. Lots of love. Lots of love. ##  Get out! Get out, or I'll call my husband! - Oh, darling. - My dear, how excited you seem. I just had a dream, a terrible dream. I dreamed that last night, when you were gone, I was downstairs alone and - Yes, yes? Go on. Suddenly a man took hold of me. I - I struggled, and he - - Choked you? - No. - Shot you? - No. What did he do? He kissed me. Oh. Kissed you.  Your dream shall come true. But the man wasrt you. Someone I know? - He's your pal. - What a pal! - It was Adolph. - Oh, no. Not Adolph.  That's a scream. It couldn't be Adolph, even in a dream! Adolph! #And still I feel guilty # # It doesn't seem right # # But you shouldn't leave me # #At night # # Day after day # #We will always be sweethearts # #The same as the day # #We began # # Dream what I may # #We will always be sweethearts # # My lips are for no other man # # Dear, never fear # # I won't ever neglect you # # Each night I'll be here # #To adore and protect you # #And year after year # #We will always be sweethearts # #The same as the day # #We began ## -  -  Come in. Darling, whatever- - Professor! - Doctor. - Oh, it's nice of you to drop in. - Uh-huh. - We missed you a lot last night. -  -  Wort you sit down? - Thank you. Yes. - Excuse me one minute. - Yes. - Uh, it's a bit drafty, eh? - Yes. Did you, uh, have a good time last night? Well, we -we tried our best. First we had, uh -we had dinner. Then we danced. And then we -we played a little. Played? May I ask what? - Cards. - Cards? Bridge. You didn't play cards last night, Doctor. Oh! Professor. I ought to know.  You were in my apartment last night. - In your apartment? - Mm-hmm. Let me see. You left your house... at 2:10. You went to the corner, jumped into a cab. My wife was in that cab. Yes. Yes, that's true. That's absolutely true. Uh, your-your wife - your wife was alone. See, naturally, as her host... I wanted to see her get home safely. Thank you for protecting my wife, Doctor. - It was only my duty, Professor. - Yes. Now, let me see -The car arrived in front of my house at 2:35. You and my wife stayed in the car... for eight minutes... up to 2:43. Right. Right. Your-Your wife just - just asked me something. And then I answered. Then another question, and then another answer. One question follows an answer. You know?  Eight minutes - Eight minutes can go like that! Yes. Yes. Then you, uh - you got out of the car. You went to the house, and at the door... my wife handed you the key. You unlocked the door... and after a short conversation, you went in. This was exactly 2:51. Uh -Am I boring you? Oh, not at all, Professor. Uh, yes, y-your wife - your wife said... ""Wort you come up and have a little brandy?"" And I said, ""Ah, a little brandy can't hurt."" - So, I - I went up. - Yes. And, uh - And you had the brandy? Yes. Was it good brandy, Doctor? Excellent, Professor. You drank this brandy from 2:53... to 4:44. Professor, I assure you... that there is absolutely nothing wrong. We just -We just had a chat... and a few laughs. You know, y-your wife - your wife is very amusing. Yes, everyone says so. It must be true. Now, Professor, all appearances are against me. I know. I know. But let me tell you again - Not another word, Doctor. - I believe you. - Thank you. You're very welcome. I believe you. But no one else will.  Too bad, isn't it? I just came up here this morning to ask you... if you would appear, voluntarily, as a... shall we say, witness in my divorce suit?  Professor, please believe me. I'm an innocent man. I'm not guilty. And neither is Mitzi. I mean - I mean, your wife. My friend - May I call you my friend? - Please. - My friend, nobody is guilty. I have a theory that nobody is responsible for their actions. Right! That's absolutely right. Our doings are controlled by circumstances over which we have no control. Oh, excellent. Truer words have never been spoken. Therefore, nobody can be held responsible for his actions. Oh, what a beautiful thought, Professor. You know - You know that you're a poet?  This, of course, has nothing whatever to do with our case. - Good morning, Professor. - Madame. Ah, I'm so glad you dropped in. We should see each other more often.  I'm afraid the doctor doesn't like me. Oh, Professor. Where did you get such an idea? Oh, by the way, how's Mitzi? - Mitzi? - Yes. Oh, Mitzi. Uh, let me see. She left this morning for Lausanne. - Lausanne? - Mmm. - Oh, to see her mother. - I suppose so. - I hope nothing's happened to her mother. - To her mother? No, I don't think so. Well, we'll see. I'm sorry, but I must be going now. Well, you must come again sometime. And when you write Mitzi, you'll give her my best regards, won't you? Oh, I surely will. And yours, Doctor? Please. - Well, good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Don't you think he behaved strangely? Oh, no, not at all. Andre? There's something wrong between the professor and Mitzi. Oh. What an idea, Colette. I feel it. I feel it. My womars instinct tells me. And there's a man in it. Andre? You know who the man is? - Who? - This Russian artist Rodovsky. - No. No, it's not Rodovsky. - How do you know? I don't know. I don't know. My- My instinct tells me it's not Rodovsky. I tell you, it's Rodovsky. All right. All right. Everybody- Everybody is entitled to his own opinion.  Let's hope it's Rodovsky. You're right, Andre. It's not Rodovsky. Now I know who it is. - Who? - That American - Goldberg. Maybe - Maybe you're right. I - I wouldn't be surprised if it were Goldberg. Andre! - I have it now. - Who? No. No. No, it can't be. # I didn't want to do what I did but I did # #And now what can I do # # I'd better take a trip Yes, a trip on a ship # #To China or Peru # # I knew the moment that she began # #Where it was leading to # # It might have happened to any man # # It might have happened to you # # It was late and she was lonely # #And she begged for sympathy only # # Now I ask you what would you do # # In a case like that # # If her head was on your shoulder # #And she grew a little bit bolder # # Now I ask you what would you do # #With a girl like that # # Do you think you could resist her # # Do you think you wouldn't have kissed her # #Would you treat her like a sister # # Come on, be honest, mister # # If you saw her turn the light out # #Would you get your hat and get right out # # Now I ask you what would you do #  #That's what I did too # # It was late and she was lonely # #And she begged for sympathy only # # Now I ask you what would you do # # In a case like that # # If her head was on your shoulder # #And she grew a little bit bolder # # Oh, I ask you what would you do # #With a girl like that # # Do you think you could resist her # # Do you think you wouldn't have kissed her # #Would you treat her like your sister # # Oh, come on Be honest, mister # # If you had a sweet and pure wife # #Wouldrt you be faithful to your wife # # Now I ask you what would you do # # Heh, that's what I did too ## Darling. - Have you had any breakfast? - Yes.

Sit down, darling. Darling, I've got to disillusion you. Your instinct was right. There is something wrong in Mitzi's marriage. Didrt I tell you? Didrt I tell you? And who wouldn't believe me?  Oh, darling, tell me. Tell me all about it. You were right. There's a man in it.  Rodovsky? - No. - Goldberg? - No. - But who is it, darling? Tell me, who? Me. You? You? My husband... and my very best friend. Look at me, Andre. Oh!  Go away! Either you leave this house or I do. - But, sweetheart - - Our marriage is over. - Darling - - From now on you're nothing but a doctor to me. - I love you. - Tell it to my lawyer. Believe me, there was nothing wrong in it. I know I shouldn't have done it... but please, please forgive me for- for what I didn't do. I don't want to hear another word! You can keep the house, my jewels, the furniture, everything! I don't want any alimony!  How do you do, sir?  Adolph. Don't go. Sweetheart, you must forgive me. Forgive you? I'm in no position to forgive you. You think you were bad? No. You were just a naughty little boy. Look at me. I'm the one that's bad. You think you're a Don Juan, eh? Well, if you're a Don Juan, then I'm a Cleopatra. You, with your one hour. What's your one hour compared with my 25 minutes? Remember the dream I told you about Adolph and me? Well, that was no dream. It happened, right here, on the night of our party.  - Oh, so you think a man couldn't fall in love with me. - Let me kiss you. - You think I'm not attractive enough? - Maybe I'm too old. -  - Well, I'll show you. - Oh, darling! Darling.  Adolph! Adolph, I want the truth... and nothing but the truth. After the party was over, did you or did you not... wait in the garden till after Andre had gone? And didn't you come into the house in the dark? And didn't I find you on the couch?  Yes. Well? Sit down! And then, Adolph, didn't you, with - with an uncontrollable impulse - didn't you untie your tie? - Yes. - Well? Sit down! And then, Adolph - then didn't you take me in your arms and kiss me? And didn't we sit on the couch, and didn't you kiss me again? And didn't I like it? - I guess so. - Answer yes or no! - Yes. - Well? Sit down! Well, Doctor? We're even. A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye... an Adolph for a Mitzi. Fifty-fifty. But if I ever catch you aga - Kiss me, sweetheart. - You don't mind, do you, Adolph? - No. - Ladies - - And gentlemen - - If he were your husband - - And she were your wife - And you find out he's a Don Juan - And you find out that she has dreams - - And he confesses - - And she admits - - But you like him - - And you love her- - And you adore him - - And you're crazy about her- What would you do?

That two rolling mosses gathers a bird in the bushes. George. You got something there. There's a little horse in the big race called Fast Asleep. L... Fast Asleep? What kind of horse is that? - Forty-to-one shot. - Smartest racehorse in the country. - Last time out he won by a lip. - A lip? - He puckered. - Puckered? - Oh. A smart horse. - Peter. That sounds like the best bet to me. It's a cinch. Nicki. You give us 20 bucks and we'll place it for you at the track. - How much could I win? - Twenty will get you 800. Come on. What do you say? You heard what my uncle said. No more bets. - And I mean it. - Eight hundred bucks ain't buttons. Buttons. Who wants buttons? I got buttons. I want bucks. L... How much you got to put up for the 800? George. Old pal. It will only cost you 20 bucks. No. Absotively. No. I only... Nicki. Come here. Listen. This time I got a hunch. When your Uncle George has got a hunch. He's got something. What do you say we both put 10 bucks apiece on Fast Asleep's nose? How's about it? Do you? - Okay. Uncle George. - That's right. Here. L... Oh. Here's your 20 bucks. And for your sake. I hope the horse don't get sleepy in the race. - You can bet he'll win. - What? Ain't that what I'm doing? Wait a minute. George. You got nothing to worry about. PETER: Goodbye. Nicki. - So long. George. So long you bring me back the 800 bucks it's all right. And no monkey business. And don't give me the cross double. MAN : And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes our fifth anniversary program. One hour of delightful music brought to you... ... by the famous Whipple All Day Ice Cream Sucker... ... the ice cream that sticks on a stick until it melts in your mouth. We wish to thank the sponsor of this delightful program... ... the man who made the world Sucker-wise... ... that pioneer of American enterprise, Herman J. Whipple. So don't forget every Tuesday at this hour, The Whipple Sucker Serenaders. And remember, there's a Whipple Sucker born every second. Wonderful. The best program of the series. ""A Whipple Sucker born every second."" My pet. That is the greatest slogan I ever thought of. - You paid $ 10.000 for it. Didn't you? - Yes. But I thought of buying it. Herman. Our train leaves at 9:00. We'd better be going. Yes. Of course. My dear. At once. Bertram. I'm leaving for Pimlico. If anyone calls. Say that I'm out. - Make no appointments. - But you have an appointment. - Mr. Raleigh is waiting. - Of course. Young Raleigh. - Can't you see him some other time. Dear? - No. My pet. Raleigh is the man who wrote the songs you heard on our radio program. He wants to produce a musical show and I'm going to back it for him. Oh. So you're going to be an angel and put thousands of dollars into a show... ...for someone you know nothing about. My pet. I'm always the businessman and never neglect to investigate first. I even checked on you before we were married. How nice. Did you find anything interesting? Several things. My dear. That's why I married you. Bertram. Read me the report on Mr. Raleigh. Herman. You're not putting my money... I mean our money into this stupid show. - But. My pet. I have already agreed. - I'll settle that. Show the gentleman in. So you checked on me before we were married. Eh? Well. Brad Street didn't do you any harm either. - Hello. Mr. Whipple. - Hello. Steve. Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. I thought you were alone. I am. I mean. This is Mrs. Whipple. Mr. Raleigh. - How do you do. Ms. Whipple? - How do you do? - I've been hearing a lot about you. STEVE: Good. I hope. I brought the contracts and I think they're exactly as you requested. I put up my show. Book. Lyrics. And music. Against your money. If it's a hit. We split fifty-fifty. If it's a flop... ...well. Then. We'll all be sorry. Okay? Steve. Mrs. Whipple and I have been talking this over. And she doesn't quite approve... ...of my making any theatrical investments at this time. I should like to have you release me from my promise. Will you? Of course. I wouldn't hold you to it if Mrs. Whipple objected. But I didn't object. If you want to break your word with Mr. Raleigh... ...don't use me as your excuse. - But didn't you say...? I simply said that I didn't know Mr. Raleigh. Now that I do. I'm terribly enthusiastic about the whole idea. Thank you. Mrs. Whipple. I wish there were producers like you when I was in the chorus. - Come. Herman. Sign the contract. - Yes. My dove. Yes. By the way. Why don't we invite Mr. Raleigh... ...to Pimlico with us? - Will you? Mrs. Whipple's horse. Star Gazer. Is running in the big race tomorrow. Why not come along and help us root him in? Well... Do you like horses. Mr. Raleigh? Oh. Yes. Very much indeed but... Well. At least we have one thing in common. ANNOUNCER: They're rounding the turn toward the stretch. What a beautiful sight. Star Gazer and Fast Asleep shoot out in front by two lengths. They're increasing to four lengths. Both jocks use the whips. The battle is on in the home stretch. Jocks are calling for that last ounce of speed. Star Gazer in front by a head. Now it's Fast Asleep by a nose. They're even. Eye to eye as they speed toward the line. Fighting furiously for an added inch. There they go, nose and nose under the wire. - It's a photographic finish. - That was a close finish. I got a hunch we should have placed that 20 bucks on Fast Asleep. It's a fine time to be getting hunches. We had to use that dough to get here to Baltimore to get this job. If that horse puckered. We're sunk. We just got the results of the photographic finish. The winner, Fast Asleep. I win $800. - But half of that is mine. - Don't be technical. I win! Herman. What do you suppose ever happened to Star Gazer? I didn't know. Dear. It looks like he's pulled a tendon. All right. Yes. He'd have won that race if he hadn't. You bet he would. You wanna rub his leg down good and bandage it. We're pulling out for New York on the 6:45 train. - Have you located the car? - It's on the siding. - Get your horses loaded and bedded down. - Okay. Mr. Blakeley. - Mr. Blakeley. I'd like to go work for you. - Have you had any experience? I used to be a jockey. - What did you ride? Elephants? - No. I was a little guy then. - Little? How big you are now? - Six-feet-one in my underwear. WOMAN: Say. You're doing that all wrong. - What? - Well. It's none of my business... ...but why don't you put his leg right in the tub? Why don't you go back out to the track and see the 8th race? It's better for the horse's leg if his foot's right in the water. Well. If you don't mind. I'll do this my way. What are you gonna do now? I wouldn't do a thing without asking you. Hey. What's going on there? You gotta take care of this quickly. Pulling a tendon is plenty serious. Some horses are laid up for months and sometimes they never run again. - What have you got there? - Leg brace. Give it to me. Give it to me. That's right. Just what he needs. Who's the gal? I don't know. I never saw her before. Sure knows what she's doing. Look. Run and get me some bandages. You heard what the lady said. Run and get her some bandages. I'll walk but I won't run. Get out. Here comes Mrs. Whipple. If she sees you fooling with that horse. I'll get fired. - How's his leg? - It's in pretty bad shape. Mrs. Whipple. I'm afraid Star Gazer will be laid up for quite a while. Think he'll be all right for the race at Belmont? I don't think he'll run again for two or three months. Oh. That's ridiculous. He should be turned out to pasture for a while. He's been running too much. We're leaving for New York on the 6:45 train. We'll take him. Maybe I can get him in shape for Belmont. If you can't. We'll sell him. I only want horses that can run. - Come on. Herman. - All right. Dove.  Hey. Psst. - There's somebody in the car. - Oh. Why don't you stop reading that stuff? You'll drive yourself crazy.  Shh.  SONNY: Turn on the lights. Hey. You. Come on out of there. Come on. Come out of there. What are you doing in here? What did you give that horse? I'll teach you to steal rides in cars. So it's you again. What did you think I was. A football? - Let me help you up. - I'll get up myself. - You hurt yourself? - Sorry we pushed you. - Why didn't you tell us who you were? - You never gave me a chance. Say. What are you doing in here anyhow? Look. Fellas. I was afraid you wouldn't take good care of Star Gazer. Say. Why are you so worried about that horse? I ought to be worried. He was born on my dad's farm and I raised him. - I even named him. - Why did you sell him? We had to. We had to sell everything. He's a great horse. Mrs. Whipple never got the best out of him. Yeah. I guess you're right. - Say. What's your name? - Sally Lee. I'm Sonny Ledford. This is my pal. Peter Trot. - Glad to know you. - Likewise. You fellas don't mind if I ride to New York with you. Do you? It's okay with me if the horses don't kick. We can't put you off now. But if Mrs. Whipple comes here... ...we'll probably all get fired. - She won't come up here. SONNY: What are you gonna do in New York? - Oh. I don't know. Probably have to find work when my money runs out. You're a good-Iooking girl. Ever think of going on the stage? - Were you ever stage-struck? - Yeah. Hit me right here.  We were in vaudeville together. Say. We played the Palace once. That is. Just once. Yeah. We didn't stop the show but we sure slowed her down. - Wanna see the act? - Uh-huh. - Let's show her the act. - All right. Let's show you the act.  - Hello. Dink. What do you think? - Hello. Fink. How about a drink? - A drink with snazz? - Yeah. Man. - Oh. Boy. Play that jazz. - Play that jazz. BOTH : Harmony, harmony Marvelous.

Come on out of there. Mr. Whipple. I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean to. That is. L... Well. L... I hope you're not mad. I'm not Mr. Whipple. And I'm not mad. In fact. I'm extremely happy at this moment. - What's going on here? - Oh. Ho! They had a... Oh. I beg your pardon. Mrs. Whipple. We were sort of... - Well. We're just relaxing. - Who is he? Oh. He's my helper. Mr. Blakeley put him on today. Likewise. I see. - Did Mr. Blakeley engage you also? - No. I'm just traveling. At my expense? Oh. No. I'm helping the boys look after Star Gazer. Mm-hm. Who are you? Why. I'm... She's my sister. - Your what? - Yes. Well. I must say I fail to see any resemblance. Different fathers. Come on. Steve. I'll be with you in a moment. How long have you two been brother and sister? Since Mrs. Whipple came in. Tell me. What's a girl like you doing around horses? I was practically born on one. Well. You ought to send that in to Ripley. No. Seriously. What are you gonna do in New York? - Try to find work. - At the track? No. On Broadway. Well. That's the fastest track in the world. So I've heard. Do you know where Hamilton Brown's casting office is? No. No. I don't. - I do. - You do? Sure. I've spent days waiting in that office. Swell. Now. Iook. Will you see that Miss...? Lee. Sally Lee. Uh... Will you see that Miss Lee gets there and asks for Mr. Brown? - I sure will. - Be sure now. CAROLINE: Steve? - Well. Goodbye. Miss Lee. - Goodbye. See you later. - What are you. A prowler? - I was on the platform getting some air... ...and I heard you playing the piano. So I listened. - Oh. An eavesdropper. Huh? - It was lovely. - Will you play some more? - Lf you'll come in. Oh. No. I wouldn't dare. No. Don't be afraid. Come on in. - Say. Did you ever write a song? - Oh. Sure. When I was 6 years old. But it was terrible. - Well. I'm afraid mine is too. - You mean the one you were playing? - Mm-hm. - Oh. That's beautiful. - You really think so? - Oh. I wouldn't fool you. - Let's hear the words. - That's just the trouble. I haven't finished them yet. I got the chorus all right. But I certainly dried up when I got to the verse. Hey. How about you helping me? - Me? - Sure. If you can write a song when you're 6... ...you ought to be able to give me a suggestion now. ""Words and music by Steve Raleigh."" - That's you. Isn't it? - Yeah. - Lovely name. - But it doesn't seem to rhyme... ...with what I'm trying to write here. - But it ought to be good for a start. Start. That's it. - Say. You're great. - What did I do? You'll find out. I've got a feeling you're lucky coming in here like this. Lucky. Lucky. That's it. - Oh. You're marvelous. - What did I do now? - Practically finished it for me. - But I haven't said anything yet. - Of course. It would make me happy... - Happy. Happy. Happy. That does it. There you are. You finished it. - You mean. I've written the verse? - Exactly. Are you sure you're feeling all right? Absolutely. Now. Come on. Sing it for me. - But I'll wake up everybody. - Don't worry about that. Now take the verse nice and slow-like. Oh. No. You sing it. Me? If I sang one note. They'd stop the train... ...come running back looking for a flat wheel. - Now. Come on. Sing it. - But after all. It's your song. No. It isn't. It's yours and mine.   Love can come along In the strangest ways It looks at a lucky couple And sets their hearts ablaze I can feel that fire in my happy heart For we are the lucky couple Couple Look what we have for a start The stars that shine Are yours and mine The rainbows in the sky Are yours and mine The song of springtime The lullaby of fall The sunshine of summertime Belongs to us all The moon above Is yours and mine The right to fall in love Is yours and mine The hope of finding The dream our hearts design All this is yours And mine How do you do? I'd like to see Mr. Brown. What do you want and who are you? Why. I am Alice Clayton. Surely you've heard of me. - The name is familiar. - So it should be. It represents 80 years in the American theater. Really. I must say. Madam. You carry it very well. You idiot. I was speaking of my family. - I was a child of the theater. - Oh. I see. Yes. Now I am a mother. She. Too. Is a child of the theater. Born in a dressing room. Raised in a wardrobe trunk. How romantic. Believe me. If I'd known show business would turn out what it has today... ...I would've slammed the lid down on her. - Oh. How very ghastly. There you are. The last and youngest of a royal family. And it is my hope that she will carry on for the Claytons. - Oh. The Claytons are a bunch of hams. - Betty. I'm sorry. Ma. It slipped out. - You see. She is too young for her talent. - Yes. Really. Yes. Mr. Brown is busy with Steve Raleigh lining up a cast for his new show. But that's what I came to see him about. Yes. So I gathered. Well. You'll have to wait. Who's this? Marie Charnelle. The sensation of the Folies Bergere in Paris. And I can get her for you. To Marie Charnelle and Steve's new show. Thanks. Duffy. - How much? - Fifteen hundred a week. That's too much. To Steve's new show. Without Marie Charnelle. Who is she? Lucille Burton. The best tap dancer in the world. And for a 20-week guarantee. I could get her for $2000 a week. And her name's worth it. To Steve's new show and Lucille Burton. - It's too much. Brown. - With that millionaire Whipple behind... I'm not putting on this show to make money out of Whipple. He's my partner. I make money for him. She's out of the question. - To Steve's new show... - Without Lucille Burton... ...or any more highballs. - Okay. Boss. Don't suppose you saw the morning papers? - Yes. They're great. Duffy. - Great. Why. Your press campaign for the past two weeks has been colossal. Stupendous. Your show isn't in rehearsal yet. And around Times Square... ...your name is a household word. I don't remember what the word is now. But it's a big one. And who did all this for you? - You did. - You guessed it. And now I'm going to do something for you. Here's the $200 you loaned me when things were tough. - Why. I can hardly believe it. - You can't believe I'd pay you back? I can hardy believe I ever had it to lend to you. You did. There's your first two weeks' salary. Oh. This is too much. Steve. I feel faint. - I feel better. - Right. But see that you carry on... ...where you left off. I expect something in the papers every day. Okay. But you gotta give me something to write about now. Gonna have a big name in the show. I suppose. Well. He should have if he expects to put it over. That's why this Lucille Burton is a great buy. I can't use her. Brown. In the first place... ...she's not the greatest tap dancer in the world. Because I've got her. - Yeah? - Yes. - Who? - Sally Lee. - Never heard of her. - So did I. You'll hear plenty when they see her. - Where did you find her? - In a boxcar. - I beg your pardon. - In a boxcar. - You know. The thing they carry horses in. - With a horse? - Yes. - Let me get this straight. - You found a girl and a horse in a boxcar? - Right. - And she's a great dancer? - Right. - You mean the girl? - Yes. The girl. That's a relief. And you're gonna put her in the lead in the new show. I certainly am. I've seen her do several dances... ...and I've heard her sing the songs. I'm sold on her. But. Steve. You can't put a show over with an unknown in the lead. Why can't I? The picture people do it. They're giving some unknown a chance... ...praying to make good so they can cash in on a new star. But pictures are different. They print them on celluloid. If the girl doesn't make good... ...they can just take a pair of scissors and... ...cut her out like that. This girl gets on the stage and she has to stay there until the curtain comes down. By that time. You'll be over in Newark looking for a new backer. I'll be apologizing to the newspaper boys for having called you a smart producer. Well. Don't start apologizing until you've seen her. - Where is she? - She'll be up here today. There's a strange woman outside with a child who insists upon seeing you. Have her arrested. Mr. Brown wants to know what the kid does. Oh. He does. Does he? Well. We'd like to show him. No. He's terribly busy now. He can't hear anyone. - What's the matter. Is he deaf? - Well. He was the last time I asked him... ...for a raise. Listen. You. We came here for a purpose. Mr. Brown is gonna hear Betty sing today. If she has to sing here in this office. Well. Go ahead and sing. See if I care. - Oh. Mom. I'd rather not. - Oh. Don't be silly. Little girl. You go right ahead. Sing to your heart's content. All right. Betty. Go ahead and sing and sing loud.

It was wonderful I bet he heard that. All right. Go on and ask him how he liked it. - Madame. I hate to disappoint you. - Now what? - The walls are soundproof. - Soundproof? Yes. I screamed my head off in here one day last week and not a soul heard me.  Sing a song of sixpence Pocket full of rye Four and twenty blackbirds Baked into a pie I beg your pardon. May I see Mr. Brown. I'm sorry. Miss. But Mr. Brown is very. Very busy. - Don't you believe a word he says. - I thought you'd left. Mr. Brown is in that office right now with Steve Raleigh making cast suggestions. - Oh. Really? - Yes. - I've met Mr. Raleigh. I'll wait. - Well. I won't. - My card. Come. Darling. - Nice boarding house. I'll be up for dinner sometime. Yes. Bring your own duck. Will Mr. Raleigh come out this way when he leaves? - He will. If he doesn't jump out the window. - I don't think he'd do that. - Well. I did once. - You did? Why? Oh. I don't know. I thought I could fly. See you later. Jerry. Hello. Hello there. Say. Am I glad to see you. I looked all over the station for you when the train got in. - I got off with the horses. - Yeah. What a break for the horses. - Say. Are your ears burning? - No. Why? Well. They should be. I just spent over an hour in there talking about you. - Good or bad? - Oh. Good. Good. The very best. - Curious? - I am. Tell me. Can't. It's a secret. I'll tell you later. - Oh. Please tell me now. - Not now. Go on. Tell her. I'm not a busybody but the suspense is killing me. - Where are you stopping? - I haven't found a place yet. - What do you say we go look for one? - I know of a boarding house. Here's the address. The place is full of actors and termites. But it's comfortable. - Let's go. - All right. I hope she has better luck in show business than we did. She will. She's got more talent than we had. I don't know. Remember that time at the Palace? Why. For the first 15 seconds we were a riot. Then the audience started hissing that act that was on ahead of us. GEORGE: Aha! So that's where are you. - I want my money. - I want $800. - Well. Where is he? - I don't know. He said he'd wait here for me. - Is that yours? - Yes. Looks like your boyfriend left you holding the bag. - I guess you're right. Thanks. - Here. I'll take it.  Listen. Everybody. I was over to see Hamilton Brown today. I understand he's casting for a new show. And Steve Raleigh is going to produce it. Now. Instead of all of you people eating yourselves out of shape at my expense... ...why don't you go over and see Steve Raleigh. And get yourself a job. Oh. That guy is harder to see than a house detective. I'll tell you. I spent four hours waiting...  A- hunting we will go A- hunting we will go A- hunting we will go Da-da-da Da-da-da-da-da A- hunting we will go A- hunting we will go ALICE: What's going on here? Get those dogs off the table. Come on. Get those dogs. This is not a zoo here. What is this? Aha. A stowaway. Why do you allow those dogs to get on my table? They are trained dogs. - Did you train them to do that? - Oh. No. That was their own idea. Come on. Get busy and clear those dishes. Why should I? Europe's greatest dog trainer... ...and character actor. Wait on tables. For 20 weeks. I was a sensation in Pinsky's Theater. Moscow. Thousands cheered when I was at the end of a rope singing:   Professional jealousy. Thirty weeks I played in Budapest. Forty weeks I played in the Folies Bergere in Paris. Fifty weeks you've been here. You haven't paid your rent. Money. Money she wants. A capitalist. Well. You've got to work out your back-rent. I quit. I'm moving. How much do I owe you? - A hundred and seventy-eight dollars. - I'll stay another week.   What's matter? You got a cold? Oh. No. No. My interest in sneezing is purely scientific. You see. They're just one of the forms of human sound phenomena... ...like snores.  You know. Snores. Oh. Yes. That's nostril opera. I. Uh... - I'm concentrating on sneezes. - Is that so? Well. I usually get my feet wet and sit in a draft... ...and catch cold to give my talk on sneezes... ...because it helps me to illustrate my lecture with a... With a...  That was Type 1. The feline or pussycat sneeze. Well. You couldn't object to that. Now an extension or expansion of this... ...is Type 1 A... ...the atomizer or seltzer siphon variety.  Type 2 is the trombone... ...or cataclysmic form... ...produced by attempting to impede the expulsion of the breath... ...by compressing the superior and inferior labia or lips.  Sounds logical. Another result of attempted stifling. Futile. Of course... ...is the ratchet or clock-winding Type 2A.  Are you following me? Yes. But not for long. Perhaps it is just as well to stifle a sneeze. - You're telling me? - Because some of the results... ...of lack of stifling are quite extreme. Most of us have heard the windows rattle and the echoes chase each other around... ...in some large public building when a man has issued... ...what seemed to be an order to a boarding-house kitchen... Not Mrs. Clayton's. Of course. - As in Type 3. the mess call.  One hash coming up. Excuse me. And in direct contrast to this. We have Type 4... ...the disappointing or non-eventuating flivver... ...in which the inspirational element is so much more noticeable... ...than the anticipated climax.  And now. We have number five... ...the chickle or chewing gum mandatory.  And the carburetor backfire or explosive.  Well. At any rate. We're up to the articulates. They sound like spoken words. As in Type 8... ...the good-luck sneeze. Horseshoe! And that little Friday sneeze. Fish! And the violent or pugilistic form. Hit you! - And finally... - Good. ...we come to the most colorful of all. The interrogatory or scandalmonger's sneeze. This is an expression not only of human interest... ...but the true spirit of science... ...curiosity and investigation. Who is she?  I'll find out. - How do you do? - Hello. - Anyone you wish to see? - The landlady. If it's rooms you're looking for. We haven't got it. The place is packed. - Nobody pays. Nobody leaves. Goodbye. - Just a moment. - Where is the landlady? - What's going on here? - What's going on here? - Looks like a song and dance team. - Get your rent in advance. - I'll take care of this. Now. You get back into the kitchen and bathe those dishes. All right. But I'm warning you. It's against my artistic temperament. - I beg your pardon. What can I do? - We'd like to see a room. - Single or double? - Single. It's for Miss Lee. How do you do? I met you in Mr. Brown's office. - Remember? - Oh. Yes. Yes. How do you do? Mr. Raleigh was kind enough to bring me here. - Not Steve Raleigh? - Mm-hm. For goodness' sake. Mr. Raleigh. How do you do? - How do you do? - It's thrilling to have you here. Do come along. Mr. Raleigh. Do come along. Listen. Everybody. This is Miss Sally Lee. A new member of our happy family. - How do you do? - How do you do? And this is Mr. Raleigh. Mr. Steve Raleigh. MAN 1: Steve? Well. How do you do? MAN 2: It's a pleasure. How are you. Mr. Raleigh?  Nice up here. Isn't it? At least it isn't so crowded. I'm sorry about what happened downstairs. Oh. You needn't be. I rather enjoyed it. You were awfully nice about it. Well. Why not? They're nice people. I hope I can have memories like theirs someday. Look. Broadway. Yep. That's Broadway. The place people come to from all parts of the world... ...to write home for money. It sort of scares me a little. Oh. It shouldn't. It's really not such a bad place. Look at the thousands of careers it's given to people. I hope it gives me mine. Maybe it will. If I can just get a little start. I'll be satisfied. What would you think if I said you were going to play the lead in my new show? I'd think your show was going to be terrible. That's what Duffy and Brown think too. But I don't. I believe in you. Sally. And I'm gonna take a chance with you. A big chance. Aren't you even gonna say thank you? Yes. Sure. As soon as I can believe it. You can start believing it right now. But. Steve. You can't do this. You need somebody important. Someone with experience. Will you let me worry about that? But if I didn't make good. It would ruin you. Look. Sally. I'm putting this show on with another man's money. If I didn't think you'd come through. I'd never take the chance. - See? - I see. Oh. We're gonna put a ring through Broadway's nose and lead it around. Just you and I. You're not doing this because you... Well... ...because you like me a little. No. Just because we'll be working together doesn't mean I shouldn't like you. Does it? No. Because I couldn't help doing that. I'm glad you can't help it. Now. - Well. That wasn't work. Was it? - No. I think we better have some rules about this thing. Now. In the first place. It's going to be nothing but hard work from now on. Morning. Noon and night. Never stop. You mustn't think about anything or anybody. Just your work. There are gonna be a lot of headaches... ...and a lot of heartaches before the show opens. And then... ...if we're still talking to each other... ...we'll talk about us. - Do you understand? - Uh-huh. Okay. And we stick to the rules. - Right? - Right. Ten o'clock. Wednesday morning. Royal Theatre. You got it? Got it. And we stick to the rules. That's just to show you how to break them.  Hello. Good-Iooking. Come here. - What do you want? - Will you tell Mr. Raleigh... ...I'd like to see him? - Mr. Raleigh is much too busy to see you. Listen. You. I came here to see Mr. Raleigh and I won't leave until I do. Madam. I'm not only following instructions. I don't own the joint. I merely toil here. STEVE: Hey. What's going on here? Oh. Hello. Steve. - How are you? - Fine. Thank you. What are you doing here? - I came here to see you about Betty. - Is she here? - No. - That's too bad. I'm having auditions today. - That's why I left her home. - Now. Why did you do that? I knew I'd have to say a lot of nice things about her. I was afraid it might turn her head. Are you sure you didn't come here to see me about yourself? No. Son. I've had my day. Yes. I remember. You mean. You saw me? Of course. Many times from the gallery. Don't you sometimes get a feeling that you'd like to go back? - On the stage? - Sure. Why not? No. I'd be disappointed. You know. Steve. I'm smart enough to know... ...that the high spots of a career can never be recaptured. I have my memories. They're grand bubbles. And I'd hate to burst them. But the thrill is gone. The thrill of opening Monday afternoon at the Palace Theatre in New York. The greeting of a London audience. I gave a command performance once. - Before the king? - No. - A gangster. - What did he make you sing? The one you heard from the gallery. Louis. You know the one I mean.   Some of these days You'll miss me, honey Some of these days You'll be so lonely You'll miss my huggin' You're gonna miss my kissin' You're gonna miss me, honey When I'm far away That I feel so lonely For you only Because you know, honey You've had your way When you leave me You know it's gonna grieve me You're gonna miss your red-hot mama Your mama, some of these days AUCTIONEER: Third and last call. And sold for $ 1250. Thank you. Sir. And now. Ladies and gentlemen. The next horse offered for sale is Star Gazer. You all know his brilliant performances. There is nothing I can say to impress you with his greatness. However. I must tell you that in his last race at Pimlico... ...Star Gazer bowed a tendon. And whoever purchases him... ...will do so with full knowledge of this injury. Ladies and gentlemen. What am I offered? Come. Come. Do I hear an opening bid? - Three hundred. - Three hundred. Thank you. Sir. I have 300. I have 300. Who will make it five? - Four hundred. AUCTIONEER: Four hundred. I thank you. Sir. I have 400. I have 400. Who'll make it five? Five hundred. AUCTIONEER: I have 500. Who'll make it six? Who'll make it six? Well. Are you all through bidding? Are you all done? All right. Going for $500. Going once. Twice. Third and last call. Seven hundred and fifty. AUCTIONEER: Seven hundred and fifty dollars. Is that your bid. Miss? - Yes. AUCTIONEER: Thank you. Thank you very much. - Sally. What are you doing? - Steve. He's a dealer. He'd ruin Star Gazer. How can you buy him? You got any money? If the bidding doesn't go any higher I can. I have that much. AUCTIONEER: Who'll make it a thousand? Do I hear a thousand? DEALER: One thousand. AUCTIONEER: I have a thousand. I have a thousand. Who'll make it 1250? Twelve-fifty. AUCTIONEER: Thank you. I have $ 1250. - Hi. Mr. Whipple. HERMAN: Hello. Steve. Have a drink? - No. Thanks. AUCTIONEER: I have $ 1250... Mr. Whipple. I'd like to borrow some money. But. Steve. I just gave you some money. Yeah. I know. But this isn't for the show. This is personal. - Personal? - Yeah. I need $ 1250. Well. I'd like to help you out. Steve. But after all. $ 1250 is $ 1250. All right. I'll make a deal with you. You think our show's gonna be a hit. Don't you? Of course. I'm backing it. All right. Then. I'll put up my half of the show for. Say. 60 days if you'll loan me the 1250. Fair enough? Fair enough. I'll do it. I have $ 1250. Do I hear any offers over 1250? Will somebody make it 1500? Fifteen hundred. Seventeen-fifty. - Ledford? AUCTIONEER: Seventeen-fifty is the bid. Yes. Mrs. Whipple? Who's the girl bidding 1750? - Why. That's... - She got that amount? No. Ma'am. I don't think she has. Then why is she bidding? - Well... CAROLINE: Blakeley. Tell the auctioneer I want the horse sold to that girl for 1750. - All right. - But. Mrs. Whipple... ...that girl hasn't got a dime. That's what I thought. Yes. Ma'am. I've got $ 1750. Who'll make it 2000?  Sold to the young lady for $ 1750. STEVE: Hello. Sonny. - Hello. Steve. - Glad to see you. - Glad to see you. - Sit down. - Thanks. - I'll be with you in a minute. - Oh. Take your time. I'm in no hurry. I suppose you'd like to know what this is about. - Yes. I would. - Well... ...it's about Sally and that jam she got herself into down at the auction. Gee. You know. I've been worried about that too. I don't know how she's gonna pay for that. - That's where you come in. - Me? I'd like to see her get the money. But I can't give it to her myself. Gee. Steve. I'd like to help you out. But to tell you the truth. I'm flat too. I've only got a buck and a half. Oh. No. No. No. I've got the money. All right. Now. Iook. Sonny. Here's $ 1250. I want you to give it to her. Well. Wait a minute. Why don't you give it to her yourself? Well. You see. It's like this. She wouldn't take it from me. Twelve hundred and fifty bucks. Say. Where am I gonna tell her I got it? Well. Tell her anything. Tell her it was bank night. I get it. Tell her anything except that it came from you. That's right. You kind of like her. Don't you? Sure. Don't you? Sonny. That's an awful lot of money. I don't know how to thank you. Oh. You don't have to thank me. Sally. It's nothing at all. Nothing? Twelve hundred and fifty dollars? Say. Where did you get that money? Why. Uh... Well... You see. Sit down and I'll tell you all about it. Look. Here's what happened. Last night. I figured out a three-horse parlay that won and paid the limit. - Twelve hundred and fifty dollars? - Yup. Seems almost unbelievable. Doesn't it? Yeah. That doesn't happen very often. Does it? Oh. No. No indeed. Very seldom. Well. I suppose you're pretty happy to own Star Gazer again. Yes. But I'd feel much better if I knew where his next meal was coming from. Why don't you let your trainer worry about that? - My what? - Your trainer. I forgot to tell you. There's a fellow hanging around Mrs. Whipple stable... ...that's just dying to work for you. - Oh. That's fine. He can start in tomorrow at. Shall we say. Um... ...nothing a week? Well. I guess that would be all right. I don't think you could get him any cheaper. On the level. Sally. You have got a trainer. You see... ...this fellow's kind of crazy about... ...Star Gazer. I get it. No. Sonny. You've done too much for me already. I won't let you give up your job. It's too late. I quit this afternoon. - You didn't. - Sure. Now on. I'm working for you. Nothing a week. If things get tough. I'll work for less. Sonny. I won't let you. Say. Listen. You're not gonna fire me too. I can't afford to lose two jobs in one day. Oh. Iook. Sally. I'm not doing you a favor. You're doing me one. Don't you understand you're giving me a chance to develop a real champion? Why. We can't miss. You and I work together. In a couple of months... And in the meantime. You're broke. I'm broke. Well. Sure. We're all broke. But we're happy.  Though I'm flat Though I'm broke Though I'm bent I'm contented to never sigh As time goes by There's a gleam In my eye And inside of my heart I'm a lucky guy Here's the reason why I'm feelin' like a million Though I haven't got a dollar A shilling or sou Still I'm feelin' like a million And I want to get this over to you I'm feelin' like a million Though I haven't got a sofa A pillow or bed Still I'm walking like a million With my hat on the side of my head What's this thing that I've found Through the days that I've clowned? Is it you that's around? I get a crazy feeling I could jump up to the ceiling 'Cause I'm feelin' like a million Though I couldn't buy a collar A necktie or glove Still I'm feelin' like a million Is it you? Is it me? Is it love? I feel like Mrs. Astor Though I haven't got a townhouse A motor or yacht Still I feel like Mrs. Astor Though a horse and a tap Are all I've got You know, I feel like Mrs. Whitney Though my dresses are not satin And my collar isn't fox Still I feel like Mrs. Whitney And I'm proud of the runs in my socks You're a Vanderbilt kin With a Tiffany grin Where have you been? You're another Cinderella You're a dime from Rockefeller You're that million-copy seller Gone With the Wind I'm feelin' like a million Though I couldn't buy a collar - No, sir - And I couldn't buy a glove - No indeed - Why, I couldn't even buy a little posy - How ridiculous - All I've got is love I'm feelin' like a million bucks    - Well. Boss. How does he look? - He looks okay to me. Sound as a 1929 dollar. Let me look at that leg. Aw. That's beautiful. - Hi. Kids. SONNY: Hello. Pete. Hello. Peter. Where have you been? What are you doing now? Taking violin lessons? Where's the feed?  The good provider. Gee. Thanks. Peter. I don't know what we'd ever do without you. Oh. It's nothing. Hey. Come here. - Where are you getting this feed? - I borrow it from Mrs. Whipple's stable... ...when she's not looking. - What's the idea of the fiddle case? - That's to get by Blakeley. What if he asks you to play him a tune? If he does. It'll be the last straw. Aha! So that's where you live. Where are they? Where did they went? - Where did they go? - Wait a minute. Where did who go? The two men was standing right here. Let me tell you something. If I catch them. If I find them. If l... Aha! So that's where you are. Who do you think you are. Jack and the Beamstalk? - You come down from there. - Oh. No. Not me. - You better come down. - You bet you my life... ...you better come down. I bet he thinks I'm mad. Will you come down from there? Not until you put the razor away.  The dog. Call off the dog. Call him off. If that dog sues me. I'll bite you. - George. How are you? Glad to... - Don't you ""hello"" me. - I want my $800. - Wait a minute. Just a minute. Sonny. What is this all about? We took 20 bucks from George here to bet on a horse called Fast Asleep. A 40-to-1 shot and the horse won. So that's where you got the money you gave me to pay for Star Gazer. No. That had nothing to do with this. We didn't bet his money. What? You didn't make the bet? - I want my $800. - Well. We haven't got $800. - We'll give you back your 20. - I don't want $20. I want 800. and I want it quick. Is it? All right. All right. Sonny. It seems to me that both you and Peter are in the wrong. Please. Let's take the 20 bucks and call it even. No. Absotively. No. I want 800. Mr. Papaloopas. Would you care to take a chance on a horse... ...to get more than your money back? One minute. This is all Greek to me. Explain it. Please. Do you? Look. We'll give you a third interest in Star Gazer. Now wait minute. I can't let you do this. You owe him $800. The only way we can pay the debt is make him a partner. If Sally insists. You get a third interest in the horse. You gonna make me partners in the horses? That's right. Thank you. Hello. Hel... When are you going to put my horse in the races? We're going to enter our horse in the $25.000 jumping race at Saratoga. Oh. Can he jump? - Can he jump? - Can he jump? Can he jump? You'll be the first to know. Come on. We'll find out. Where's the horse? So he's a jumper. Huh? I wanna back out from the deal. - I want my $800. - Well. We haven't got $800. But you haven't given the horse a chance. He can jump. I don't care. I want... - Eight hundred dollars. - Yes. Hello there. What's going on here? - Hello. Steve. - Who sent for you? Listen. L... Where are you? Do you know who that was? - I don't care. I want $800. - It was Mr. Raleigh. Steve Raleigh. The producer. L... You mean the man what makes the shows on Broadway? - Sure. - That's a fine how-do-you-feel. That's the man I want should hear you sing. Come on. - Mr. Raleigh? - Yes. I'm George Papaloopas. This is my nephew. Nicki Papaloopas. - Say hello to the gentleman. Hello. - How do you do? Mr. Raleigh. I've been reading a lot about your new show. - Oh. Is that so? - Yes. You know. My nephew's a singer. He sings just like a knocking bird. Someday you're going to listen to him. Is it? Why. Yes. I'd be glad to but some other time. There's no presence like the time. You gotta make hay while the iron is hot. Come on. Nicki. Sing for the gentleman. You stand there and sing. Nicki. I'll play. Don't go way.  SONNY: Whoa! Whoa. Boy. Whoa. Hey. Stop the guy singing in there. He's driving the horse crazy. Star Gazer. Whoa. Boy. Hold him. Boy. Whoa. Star Gazer. Whoa. Hold him. Boy. Hey. Sally. Tempus fugit. And that's ""I'll be seeing you"" in any man's language. Goodbye now.  That's a terrible cold you got. Oh. Welcome to the health club. I'm Emma Snipe and I know what you want. Your underweight. You're sick. It's a wonder you can stand up. Sit down. I don't wanna worry you. But the undertaker is right behind you. But don't worry. I can put 30 pounds on you before you can say... Uh. Let me hear you say ""Rumplestiltskin."" Rumplestiltskin. Rumplestiltskin. You don't put any oomph into it. You've burnt your candle at both ends. What you want is more oomph. Isn't it? You can't be vital without vitamins. How do you eat? - Like a horse. - Frankly. You'll have to cut that out. From now on. You'll sit up at a table just like anyone else. Look. I don't wanna put on weight. I wanna reduce. I'm a jockey. And if I don't take off some weight... ...they won't let me ride at Saratoga. - How much do you wanna lose? - About 70 pounds. Seventy pounds? Frankly. You take that much. You'll be nothing... ...but a blood vessel to keep your clothes warm. I'll still do it. How much will it cost? We charge by the pound. 50 cents a pound. You pay that much for good rump steak. - What's your name now? - Same as it always was. Peter Trot. Oh. I used to just adore Peter Rabbit. Will you stick out your tongue. Please? Now. Can you whistle? Mm. Frankly. That's bad. Has difficulty in whistling. You can stick it back in. You're getting your tie wet. Now I'll turn you over to my assistant. Oh. Babe. Come and get it. Of course. We could take 10 pounds off right now if we cut your hair. - Betty. What have you got there? - Nothing. Mom. - Come on now. Let me see it. - Well... Come on now. Let me see it. ""Sincerely yours. Clark Gable."" So you've been writing to the actors again. Eh? Well. I'll put a stop to that. Oh. Mom. I paid a quarter for that picture. First it was Donald Duck. And now it's Clark Gable you're crazy about. Now look here. Young lady. You stop thinking... ...about these moving-picture actors and you go right to sleep. And mind you. No dreaming about them either.  Dear Mr. Gable, I am writing this to you And I hope that you will read it So you'll know My heart beats like a hammer And I stutter and I stammer Every time I see you at the picture show I guess I'm just another fan of yours And I thought I'd write And tell you so You made me love you I didn't wanna do it I didn't wanna do it You made me love you And all the time you knew it I guess you always knew it You made me happy Sometimes you made me glad But there were times, sir You made me feel so sad You made me sigh 'Cause I didn't wanna tell you I didn't wanna tell you I think you're grand That's true, yes, I do 'Deed I do, you know I do I must tell you what I'm feeling The very mention of your name Sends my heart reeling You know you made me Love you Oh. Gee. Mr. Gable. I don't wanna bother you. I guess you got a lot of girls that tell you the same thing. And if you don't wanna read this. Well. You don't have to. But I just had to tell you about the time I saw you in It Happened One Night. That was the first time I ever saw you. And I knew right then you were the nicest fellow in the movies. I guess it was because you acted so. Well. So natural like. Not like a real actor at all. But just like any fellow you'd meet at school or at a party. And then one time I saw you in a picture with Joan Crawford... ...and I had to cry a little because you loved her so much... ...and you couldn't have her. Not till the end of the picture. Anyway. And then one time I saw you in person. You were making a personal appearance. And I was standing there... ...when you got out of your car. And you almost knocked me down. Oh. But it wasn't your fault. No. I was in the way. But you looked at me and you smiled. Yeah. You smiled right at me. As if you meant it... ...and I cried all the way home just because you smiled at me for being in your way. Oh. I'll never forget it. Mr. Gable. Honest Injun. You're my favorite actor. I don't care what happens Let the whole world stop As far as I'm concerned You'll always be the top 'Cause you know you made me Love you Here's to Steve's new show. Yeah. It's plenty rough in spots. Hey. Burt. Come here. You've gotta clean up that finish. It's no good. They're all tired out. It's after 1:00. We'll call it quits for tonight. All right. Girls. You can all go home.  See that you go home. I'll expect you in the morning. Ten o'clock in the morning. Girls. Be here on time. No alibis. STEVE: Sally. Come here a minute. Sit down. I didn't like your rehearsal today. I'm sorry. That love scene was pretty bad. You didn't mean it. But I tried. That's probably just the trouble. You're trying too hard. No. Just be simple and sincere. Now come on. Read that line for me. - Which one? - The one where you say. ""I love you."" I love you. Really I do. I love you with all my heart. Well. That's more like it. Why didn't you say it like that at rehearsal? I'll try to do it better tomorrow. Be sure you do. It's very important. Sally. Yes? - I'm sorry I had to pick on you today. - Oh. That's all right. I understand. Remember I told you we'd be lucky if we were still speaking... ...to each other at the end of rehearsals? - Uh-huh. Speaking of rehearsals. Let me hear that line again. I wanna see if you remember it. Why don't you read it for me. Then I can tell what you really mean. All right. I love you. Really I do. I love you with all my heart. That sounded nice. Steve. Now let me try it again. I love you. Really I do. I love you with all my heart. CAROLINE: Steve. If you two can stop loving each other with all your hearts for one moment... ...I'd like to see you in the office. You better run along home. Sally. And get some rest. - You've got a big day tomorrow. - All right. Steve. - Well? - Herman. Are you going to tell Steve... ...or shall I? - Oh. Yes. Dear. Steve. We have some rather bad news for you. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Yes. So am I. But we've come to the conclusion. Steve. That we can't go on with the show. Here now. Wait a minute. We're partners. We made a deal. That's right. So we did. Steve's right. My dear. We didn't agree to waste your money on an unknown girl. I know the idea of a Broadway show... ...resting on an unknown may sound foolish. But that's been my plan from the first. New faces. Fresh talent. That's the idea you bought when you agreed to finance me. We didn't agree to finance your love affairs. I hardly expected that. I suppose you're not in love with the girl? Yes. I am. If I didn't think she'd make good. I'd never had her in the show. I don't suppose you can understand that. Herman. Are you gonna sit there and let him talk to me like that? Certainly not. My dear. What did he say? I want you to tell Steve that unless the girl leaves... ...you're withdrawing your financial support. That's right. Steve. You can't have two angels in one show. Can you? I'll do the show without you. But according to our contract. I own half of it. Not if you fail to go through with it. You don't. Mr. Raleigh forgets. Dear. That you hold his personal note for $ 1250... ...and if it isn't repaid within 60 days. Even his half of the show is yours. Darling. That's right. Dear. I'd forgotten about that. Now. You shouldn't have given me a note like that. Steve. That was a mistake. - How did you ever come to do that? - Mr. Raleigh's romantic. Dear. Of course. That's something you wouldn't understand. Here. Let's go. - So they walked out on you. Eh? - Yep. Well. Here's to Steve's new show without Sally Lee. Don't you believe it. I'll find another backer. And she'll be in the show. Now listen. Steve. Any guy that would give up a city bankroll... ...for a farmer's daughter. If he isn't crazy. Then I am. You can't do this. You can't throw away that Whipple money... ...just on account of this Sally Lee girl. You can find hoofers all over town. You'll never find another like Whipple. STEVE: Oh. Don't worry about it. He's out. Listen. Now use your head. Will you? The Whipples will back the show if the girl is out. Forget about her and do it Mrs. Whipple's way. Make a name for yourself first and then you can star the girl and her horse. Forget it. Will you. Duffy? Sally. Yes? - I thought you'd gone home. - I'm leaving now. - Wait. I'll go with you. - Don't bother. - I'd rather go alone. - All right. I'll see you at rehearsal tomorrow. Huh? I'm not coming tomorrow. What do you mean. You're not corning? I'm leaving the show. Now. Wait a minute. Stop your kidding. Will you? I'm not joking. I'm afraid of it. I don't think I can make good. Even you didn't like my rehearsals today. Well. That's what rehearsals are for. To improve your work. Now. You haven't been listening to Duffy out there. Have you? No. I've been up in my dressing room. Thinking this all out alone. I really don't fit in here. Steve. I belong with Star Gazer and Sonny. - Sonny? - Yes. This isn't fair to him. What do you owe Sonny? He works for me for nothing. Besides that... ...he gave me the money to buy Star Gazer. - He gave it to you? - Yes. He did. Oh. Yeah. That's right. He did. Didn't he? Well. That's no reason why you should leave me. My show. I mean. Believe me. It will be much better without me. Good night. Steve. Where is she? - She quit the show. - Say. That's great. Boy. Are you a lucky stiff. I tried 10 years to get rid of a girl I married in South Bend. Indiana. I'm gonna put this show on with that girl if it takes me a year. You haven't got a year. You got only 60 days. Right. I gotta work fast. Look. Have you still got that 200 bucks I paid you back? Funny. I never felt that dough was mine. Thanks. Duff.  I'm sorry to hear you're leaving tonight. Thanks. Dora. Bet you haven't saved a dime all summer long. Oh. It takes money to keep a horse in training. - Honest. Sally. I admire you. - Thanks. You'd make a swell wife for some guy. What made you think of that? If you'd go through all this for a horse. What would you do for some man?  LOUIS: The. Uh. Same answer? That Raleigh don't take no for an answer. Does he? Oh. Why don't you see him. Sally? You know you want to. Why don't you give your heart a break? Perhaps I'd rather give him the break. The sooner he forgets me. The sooner he'll get his show on. I'm sorry. Sir. She will not see you. - What did she say? - Nothing. Sir. She read the note? Yes. Sir. But the answer is still no. All right. Thanks. Louis.  Get away. BLAKELEY: Hey. You. Where are you going? Hey. You're putting on a little weight. Aren't you? - Oh. I'm just taking out my laundry. - Yeah? Oh. So you're a musician too? Yeah. I decided to be the life of the party in 10 easy lessons. Well. Play something for me. You'd like it better after the next lesson. I'd like it now. Play. It'll sound awful corny. Yeah. Give me that. I think you're fired. Now I know you're fired. So that's where my feed's been going. Eh? You get out of here. Hurry up. Go on. Get out of here. That was a good. Stiff workout. He jumps like a kitten. I'll say. He's in top form. Right on edge. Well. That's your last workout before you go to the post. Jimmy. Cool him out and don't give him too much water. Yes. Sir. - What do you really think of him. Sonny? - I think he's got a great chance to win. Gee. I hope so. Sally. I wanna talk to you for a minute. - Come on sit down. Huh? - All right. Sally. There's... There's been something bothering me for a long time. - Something I want to tell you about. - Well. What is it? Well. I feel pretty bad because I know how things are between you and Steve. There's nothing between us anymore. Do you mind if I tell you I don't believe you? You're still kind of crazy about Steve. Aren't you? Sure. You are. I knew it all the time. But I've got an idea. An idea that'll make everything all right. Now. There's $25.000 in it for the winner of tomorrow's race. That dough would go a long way towards helping Steve put his show on. Wouldn't it? Would it? But you don't mean that we'd... Sure. I do. With that 25.000 bucks. Steve's troubles are practically over. How could I give it to Steve? Part of that money belongs to you. No part of it's mine. That's another thing I wanna put you straight on. You see. The money you thought was mine. Steve gave me to give to you. He did? But what about Nicki and George? - They own a part of Star Gazer now. - Oh. Don't worry about Nicki and George. I fixed it with them this afternoon. They're willing to put their winnings into Steve's show too. Oh. Sonny. You're a darling. GEORGE: Hello. Peoples. - Hello. SONNY: Hello. George. - How are you? - How are you? - Glad to see you. - How are you? Wait a minute. Tell me. How is my horse jumping? Just like a kitten. - Do you think he's going to win? - George. He's got to win. I want to thank you and Nicki for what you're doing. Oh. That's all right. Maybe Steve is going to put my nephew in the show. You know Nicki sings just like a robin red chest. SALLY: Hello. Peter. GEORGE: Hi there. - Hello. How are you? - Hello. - Say. What's the matter with you? - Got a load of grief for you guys. Bad news? SONNY: Well. We're sure getting the breaks. - Yeah. And they're all bad. Where's Peter? I don't know. But he ought to be ready by now. Any you guys got a pin? Hey. Pete. Come on. Will you? It's almost post time. Are you all ready? - All I need's a pin. - What do you want a pin for? - To hold your hat on? - To keep my pants up. There's a pin. Hey. Get away from there. Come on. Up you go. Listen. Star Gazer. You've got to win.  My dove. Do you think Dubonnet will win? He'd better. This is one race I want to win. Well. He's a very likely-Iooking animal. MAN 1: Come on up a little bit. Come on. - Up. Easy. Now. Take it easy. MAN 2: Now. Go.  - Oh. Sonny. L... - Nicki. Come with me. Sing.  Oh. Sonny. I'm afraid he'll never overcome that lead. SONNY: Come on. Star Gazer. Come on. Boy. Come on. Nicki. Sing. Sing. Nicki. - Come on. Star Gazer. - Bring him in. Come on. Star Gazer. Come on. Star Gazer. - Come on. Star Gazer. - Get him in there. Pete. Get him in.   Wait a minute. Children.

There's an honored guest tonight. He's one of those men, who are being feted by the smart-set. We'll see that he gets what he deserves. Treat him as they do a king, in manner royal. Like a subject to a king, you must be loyal. On this you must have your hearts set. We'll do nothing to get on his nerves. Again I mention: Be on your toes, men. He craves attention, he's one of those men. We will give him just what he deserves. Oh, Hives... - Yes, Mrs. Rittenhouse? I'd like to reassign the rooms. - Very good, madam. Mr. Chandler should have the Blue suite. Captain Spaulding, as guest of honor, gets the Green duplex with 2 baths. Two? - Yes. I think the Captain would like 2 baths, don't you? If he's just returned from Africa, he may need 2 baths. Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler. Mrs. Rittenhouse! Well, I... Mr. Chandler! So nice to see you. - The famous Beaugard, as promised. How can I ever express my gratitude? - Oh, 'tis nothing. Nothing? You return from Europe with a masterpiece worth $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you let me unveil it at my party for Captain Spaulding. You call that nothing? - Mrs. Rittenhouse, I... Please remove it to where it will be exhibited. - Very good, sir. And very careful, please. You think that is something? I would do much more for you. You are a very beautiful woman. - No, no, Mr. Chandler. Well, maybe I'm wrong. - What? Please do not go. I love you. - I know. Mr. Chandler, now look... Hello, Mother. Playing house? Well, if you'll pardon me. Have you seen Johnny Parker? - Forget him. Think more of our guest. Your problem is you don't take these social affairs seriously. What would you suggest, Mom? Suicide? I would suggest... That must be him. - Captain Spaulding has arrived. What a pleasure! I'm so glad. Friends, Captain Spaulding has arrived. At last we are to meet him, the famous Captain Spaulding. From climates hot and scalding, the Captain has arrived. Most heartily we'll greet him, with plain and fancy cheering, until he's hard of hearing. The Captain has arrived. The Captain has arrived. Mr. Horatio W. Jamison, Field Secretary of Captain Spaulding. The Captain insists on these conditions under which he camps here. In one thing he is very strict. He wants his women young and picked. As for men, he won't have any tramps here. As for men, he won't have any tramps here. The men must all be very old, the women warm, the champagne cold. It's under these conditions that he camps here. I'm announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding. He's announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding. Oh dear. He is coming. At last he's here. Well, what do I owe you? From Africa to here, $1.85? Outrageous! I told you not to take me through Australia. That's criminal. Turn around. I want to see your license plates. I'll attend to you later. You're one of the most beautiful women I've seen. Doesn't say much. Captain, Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal. I'm grateful for this magnificent washout, ah, turnout. Now I'd like to say a few words. Hello, I must be going. I cannot stay. I came to say I must be going. I'm glad I came, but just the same, I must be going. But you must stay. If you should go away, you'll spoil this party I am throwing. I'll stay a week or two, I'll stay the summer through, but I am telling you, I must be going. Before you go, will you oblige us and tell us of your deeds so glowing? I'll do anything you say. In fact I'll even stay. - Good. But I must be going. There's something I would like to say that he's too modest to relay. The Captain is a moral man. Sometimes he finds it trying. This I emphasize with stress. I never drink unless... somebody's buying. The Captain is a very moral man. If he hears anything obscene, he'll naturally repel it. I hate a dirty joke, unless it's told by someone who knows how to tell it. The Captain is a very moral man. Hooray for Captain Spaulding, the African explorer. Did someone call me Shnorrer? He went into the jungle, where the monkeys throw nuts. If I stay here, I'll go nuts. He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science. He is the only white man to cover every acre. He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science. Hooray for Captain Spaulding, the African explorer. He put his name on dying fame and that is why we say: Hooray, hooray, hooray. My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion. And I want you to know... My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion... My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion. Hooray for Captain Spaulding... Well, somebody's got to do it. It is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home. Oh, it isn't so bad. Wait. You're right, it's one of the frowziest joints I've ever seen. The wallpaper! You're letting this place run down. You're not getting the class of people you need. These people look like you. Let's put up a sign, ""Under new management"". We set up a 75-cent meal that knocks their eyes out. Then we can charge whatever we want. Sign here and give me a check for $1,500. This insurance policy provides for your little one and your old age, which will be here in a few weeks. I feel that the time has come, the walrus said... You stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times. Alright, I'll do that. In the dark forests of Africa, you dared all dangers. You mind if I don't smoke? Fearlessly you have blazed new trails, scoffed at the lions' roar and the cannibals' tom-toms. Says you. Never once in all those months did your footsteps falter. Cowardice is unknown to you. Fear is not in you. Pardon me, a caterpillar, Captain. The caterpillar must have frightened him. Oh dear. Don't just stand there, get the whiskey. Where's the whiskey? - In my little black bag, in the right-hand corner. Signor Emanuel Ravelli. How are you? Where's the dining room? - This is a surprise. I used to know an Emanuel Ravelli who looked exactly like you. I am Emanuel Ravelli. - You're Emanuel Ravelli? No wonder you look like him. But there is a resemblance. And he thinks I look alike. - If so, it's a tough break for you. You are one of the musicians? Aren't you due tomorrow? Tomorrow's too quick. Lucky they didn't come yesterday. - We charge for yesterday, too. What do you get an hour? For playing, we get $10 an hour. - And for not playing? $12 an hour. - Clip me off a piece of that. For rehearsing, we make special rate. That's $15 an hour. For rehearsing? And for not rehearsing? You couldn't afford it. If we don't rehearse, we don't play. And if we don't play, that runs into money. How much for running into an open manhole? - Just a cover charge. Well, drop in some time. - Sewer. Well, we cleaned that up pretty well. - Let's see how we stand. Flat-footed. Yesterday we didn't come. You remember? That's $300. Yesterday you didn't come. That's $300? Oh, that's reasonable. Today we did come... - You owe us 100. I bet I'm gonna lose on the deal. Tomorrow we leave. That's worth... - A million dollars. Yeah, that's alright for me, but I got a partner. The Professor. The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered. How do you do? Goodness. You haven't got chocolate, have you? He's got everything. - Hives, take the Professor's hat and coat. And send for the fumigators. Don't you see that there are ladies present? Put that hat down. What are you doing? Get out of here. Go on. A little more to the right. That's better. See that the drape is well-hung. The mistress will inspect it later. Hello, Hives. - Mrs. Whitehead! This is a surprise. - And how about me? - Miss Grace! You've grown so. - You haven't lost any weight, either. No, unfortunately not. It seems strange to find you working here instead of our own home. After you left for Europe, Mrs. Rittenhouse made me an offer. Lovely. By the way, what's the secret about the painting? No secret. It's Beaugard's ""After the Hunt"". The original? - Most original. Be careful. Where did she get that? Is it very valuable? - It must be worth a fortune. It looks as if Mrs. Rittenhouse gets the Social Award of the Season. Can't we do something? - We might shoot ourselves. I'd rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse. I have an idea. I copied that painting at art school a year ago. Well, what of it? But I still don't get it. I'll get the copy. We'll substitute it for the original and when she unveils it, she'll have a cruel imitation. Grace, you're wonderful. - That's what I've been telling you. I won't be long. - Alright. See you later. Oh, Hives? Do you still feel a bond between us? - Most certainly, Mrs. Whitehead. Strong enough for you to do me a big favor? - Anything at all. If I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard... Do you mean... - Temporarily, of course. And substitute something of my own? - Quite an unusual request. It is, but somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads. You may count on me. My soul is yours, even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse. Why, Hives! Oh, Mrs. Whitehead! - Arabella! May I present Mr. Parker? - Of the Massachusetts' Parkers? Why, no. - Then the Southern Parkers? No, the Central Parkers. You know, the Benches and Trees. I see. Meow! Oh, I don't like that woman. You sit down here and tell me whom you do like. Oh, so that's your game. - Now listen. Do you really love me? Marry me and find out. - Marry you? On what? Last year I sold 2 paintings. One at 100 and one at 50. Could we live on $150 a year? - We wouldn't need money. I've got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue. If I had any brains, I'd give up painting and get a regular job. I had a cousin who made $50,000 in Wall Street last year. I don't wanna marry your cousin. I'm a darn fool and wanna marry you. Say... we could get that old bluff Chandler to buy a portrait from you. Chandler? What does he know about art? The less he knows, the easier it'll be for you. They're right upstairs. You can't miss them. Go round the other side. Mrs. Rittenhouse. Captain Spaulding! How are you? Tell me. Are you alone? - Captain, I don't understand. You don't? Don't give me that innocent stuff or you'll be alone. A big cluck like you turning cute on me! Mrs. Rittenhouse... - Yes? Oh, pardon me. You've been affected like this before? Oh no, Captain. - You will be. Mrs. Rittenhouse... Ever since I've met you, I've swept you off my feet. Something has been beating in me like the incessant tom-tom in the jungle. Something that I must ask you. - What is it, Captain? Would you wash a pair of socks for me? - I'm surprised. It's been on my mind for weeks. It's my way of saying I love you. I love you. I've never been... - Captain! Pardon me. Am I intruding? Are you intruding? Just when I had her on the 5-yard line. I should say you were intruding. Pardon, that you are intruding. I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense. Yes, we're way past tents, we're living in bungalows now. Mrs. Whitehead, you haven't met Captain Spaulding, have you? No. How are you? - How are you? - Fine, thank you. How are you? And how are you? That leaves you one up. Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes? - No. Well, you have. And so have you. He shot her a glance. As a smile played around his lips. I've never seen four more beautiful eyes in my life. Well, three anyway. You two girls have everything. You're tall and short, slim and stout. Just the kind of girl I crave. We three would make an ideal couple. You have beauty, charm, money. You have got money? If not, we can quit right now. The Captain is charming, isn't he? - I'm fascinated. I'm fascinated, too. Right on the arm. Fascinated, whim-wham! If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two. You're fortunate the Theater Gill isn't putting this on. And so is The Gill. Pardon me while I have a strange interlude. You couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you? Strange how the wind blows tonight. It reminds me of poor old Marsden. How happy I could be with either of these two, if both of them just went away. Well, girls, will you marry me? Which one of us? - Both of you. Let's all get married. It's my party. Party... Party... Here I am talking of parties. I came down for a party. What happens? Nothing. Not even ice cream. The gods look down and laugh. The world would be better for children if the parents had to eat the spinach. What do you say? We all gonna get married? - All of us? - All of us. That's bigamy. - Yes, and that's big of me, too. Let's be big for a change. One woman and one man was enough for your grandmother, but who wants to marry her? Nobody. Not even your grandfather. Think of the honeymoon. Strictly private. No other woman allowed. Well, maybe one or two, but no men. I may not go myself. You want a companionate marriage? It has its advantages. You'd live with your folks, I'd live with your folks. And you'd sell Fuller brushes. Living with your folks... The beginning of the end. Drab yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows. Hideous footsteps creaking along the misty corridors of time, and in those corridors I see figures. Strange figures. Weird figures: Steel 186, Anaconda 74, American Can 138. Where were we? Oh yes, we wanted to marry. What do you think? Should we? - Marriage is a noble institution. The foundation of the American home. - Yes, but it can't be enforced. It was put over on us while our boys were over there and our girls over here. I've waited at these stairs for years for just this moment. Captain, where are you going? - I'm sorry, ladies, we'll have to postpone the wedding for a few days. Maybe for a few years. Before I get married, I'm gonna sow a couple of wild oats. The Captain's so amusing. - Isn't he charming? That's the famous Beaugard, eh? Great picture, isn't it? You've seen it before? - I spent 3 days in Paris copying it. You did? - Me and a million other artists. I bet yours was better than the rest. - It wasn't bad. I'll show it to you sometime. Listen. - What? - Mother's going to unveil it tonight. Yeah? Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all. Suppose it's yours. - You want to swap mine for his? Exactly. - You're crazy. What good would it do? What good? Listen. They'll unveil it. Chandler will tell everyone how fine it is. They'll cheer like mad, and then we'll tell them who really did it. They'll say you're a great artist. You'll get 6 commissions, and we can be married and divorced in no time. Sound great. But what if they don't like my painting? Isn't the chance worth taking? I see you're admiring my picture? - Yes, yes. Your picture? - Yes, my picture. - It don't look like you. Some place I met you before. Your face is very familiar. I am one of the most well-known men in America. The newpapers keep running my photograph. You're not Abe Kabibble? - Nonsense. If you're not Abe Kabibble, who are you? Now please. My name is Roscoe W. Chandler. I don't get about the name. Some place I met you before. Were you ever in Sing Sing? - Please. No. I got it. Joliet! - Let me alone. Alright. Don't run away. Leavenworth! I've never been in these places. I've spent most of my time in Europe. I've got it now. You come from Czechoslovakia. You're wrong. I've never been there. Hey, come here. - I tell you. Get away from me. You remember him? He come from Czechoslovakia. You are wrong. I told you before. He come from Czechoslovakia. And I know who it is. Abie, the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia. - Ridiculous. We prove it. He had a birthmark. Please, what are you trying? Let me alone! There it is! The birthmark! Abie, the fishman. I confess. I was Abie. How did you get to be Chandler? - How did you get to be Italian? Whose confession is this? Don't tell anyone about this and we can come to some agreement. One that is mutually satisfactory. Money. Money. - Shall we say $500? Fie to $500! - All the cash I have with me. $500? I tell you what. We'll take your IOU. That's my best offer. - That's all you'll give? Abie the fishman! Abie the fishman! Please, be quiet. Come here. I have a check for $5,000. Is it good? - Of course. Who would give me a bad check? I would. See if it's good. Alright, if you don't want it... - That's all we get? Yes. - He's Abie the fishman! Give me that handkerchief. My tie! Where's my tie? Nothing but a pair of thieves. I get the tie. What you got? The birthmark! Where's your tie? - Why I... Fine way for a millionaire to run around. Have you got garters? - Of course. Oh, they've taken them. A likely story. Have you at least got socks? Certainly. Here. - They look pretty old to me. Whose are they? Well, old socks. Let me introduce myself. I'm Captain Spaulding. Roscoe W. Chandler. - This is a treat, your treat. You have heard about me? I've heard about you for years, and I'm getting pretty sick of it. Quite naturally, I've also heard of the great Captain Spaulding. Fine. I've heard of you and you've heard of me. Have you heard the one about the two Irishmen? - Oh yes. Then let's get down to business. My name is Spaulding. Roscoe W. Chandler. - Geoffrey T. Spaulding. What's the ""T"" stand for? Thomas? - Edgar. You were close, though. I want to talk to you about something. Would you like to finance an expedition? - That is a question. You certainly know a question when you see it. I congratulate you. And that brings us back to where we were. Will you finance an expedition? Do you have a particular one in mind? I've always wanted to do something before I quit. - What is that? Retire. Now, would you be interested? My retirement would be the greatest contribution to science ever. This is your chance. When I think what you have done for this country. What have you done, by the way? - Oh well... I've always tried to do what I could. Especially for art. How have we drifted around to that? What is your opinion of art? I'm glad you asked. - I withdraw the question. He takes things seriously. You can't ask a simple question. Where will you build your new opera house? - Near Central Park. Why not right in Central Park? - Could we? At night, when no one's looking. Better yet, in the reservoir. But that could interfere with the water supply. After all, art is art. On the other hand, water is water. And east is east, west is west. If you stew cranberries like applesauce, they tastes like prunes. Now tell me what you know. I would gladly giving you my opinion. Dandy, I'll ask you for them someday. Can you be in my office at 10 tomorrow? Ask for my secretary. If he sees you, I'll discharge him. Saturday at 3. No, make that Tuesday. I'm going to Europe Monday. My name is Spaulding. I've always wanted to meet you. What do you think of the problems of traffic and marriage? What do you think of when you go to bed, you beast? Well, I ... - I'd rather not hear it. There are children present. My dear Captain, it boils down to a question of money. The nickel is not what it was 10 years ago. I'll go further than that. It's not what it was 15 years ago. You know what this country needs? A 7-cent nickel. We've had the 5-cent nickel since 1492. Nearly 100 years. Let's give the 7-cent nickel a chance, and then try an 8-cent nickel. You buy a 3-cent paper and get the same nickel back. One nickel carefully used would last a family a lifetime. I think that's a wonderful idea. - Really? - Yes. Then there can't be much to it. Forget it. Tell me, Captain Chandler... Excuse me, Spaulding. I'm Spaulding. You're Chandler. Let's have no more of this. Alright. - Bad enough being Spaulding. - Tell me, Captain Spaulding... Spaulding is the right name? - Right. I'm Chand... No, I'm Spauld... Show me the program. For all he knows, I might be coming next week. Captain Spaulding, you're quite a traveler. How about South America? I'm going there soon. Where exactly? - Uruguay. You go your-a-way, I'll go mine. Let's change the subject. Take the foreign situation. Take Abyssinia. And I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye. Let's see what the boys in the back room are up to. Let's see how yours compares with the original. - Alright. No difference! - Look closer. Maybe you'll find it's better. You seen my partner? - No. Oh, Mr. Raviola! Ravelli. Ravelli. - Oh, Mr. Ravelli. Would you do something for me? I'd do anything for you. What do ya want? You see that painting? - You mean this piksh? Take it out of the frame and put this one in its place. You want I should take this one down and put this one upstairs? - Yes. You want I should steal? - No. It's not stealing. Then I couldn't do it. - Oh, Mr. Raviola! Hey, get up. Come here. That's all you do. Chase the women. Oh, stop. Everybody plays cards, but they don't ask us. We just wasting our time. We've been here all day. How much we make? Nothing. Soon we go to the old ladies' home. How do you like that? No, that's no good. These people here got money. We gotta find someone to play with us. I'd play anything. Poker, pinochle... - Signor Ravelli, I want to talk to you about the music. What's wrong with you? It would be nice... Go away from me! What is this? Hello, Professor. What's the matter with his feet? We play all kinds of games. Blackjack, soccer... One, two, three... Why don't you leave him alone? Now that this game is over, how about some bridge? You play bridge? - A little. - What do you play for? Just for small stakes. - And french-fried potatoes? Set it up right over there, Hives. - Very good, madam. What is he up to? Look at this. Take it away, Hives. - Extraordinary. How do you want to play? Honest? - I hope so. You put that right away. It's your own fault. We'll cut for partners. - No, I only play if he's my partner. It's against the rules. We have to cut for partners. Alright, we cut for partners. I got ace of spades. He's got ace of spades. Coincidences! Two aces of spades? - Yeah, he's got thousands of them. He has the choice of seat then. - You have the choice of seat. Not on her lap. - Sit down. What's the matter with him? - He thought it was contact bridge. Just a moment. Shuffle the cards. - You gotta scrumble them up. Just a moment. I'd like to cut them. That's a winner. Your bid, partner. You pass? Misdeal. You pass? I bid one spade. I pass. - Three spades. Four spades. One club. - I don't understand this bidding. You don't have to. You bid four spades, eh? I haven't a spade in my hand. - Alright. We double. Something's wrong here. Let's do over the bidding. Oh, she want to bid again. He bids one. One? One what? - That's alright. You'll find out. But we have to know what he's bidding. - Later. Now I bid two. Two what? - Two of the same he bids. Now the bidding's over. That's enough. It's your lead. You can't lead that. - Why not? We can't take it. - What should I lead? He'll show you. Ace of spades. That's -a very good. Three of spades. Four of spades. You trump it? You call that finesse. No spades, partner. No spades. Ace of hearts. Ace of clubs. Dummy leads. The dummy leads. I'm not the dummy. - Well, you could be. Ace of diamonds. Hundred aces, eh? Two hundred? That's better. Ace of hearts. Atta boy. Make a big slam. Make a big, big slam. Ace of spades. Ace of spades. That's a good guy. Plays a good game. Ace of spades. Plays a fine game. Ace of spades. - I refuse to play any longer. You're nothing but two cardsharps. - My shoes are gone. Graciousness. He has your slippers. Come along. Hey, you take-a the ladies' shoes? Quiet! Hide. Somebody's coming. Alright, I make a mistake. Get up, come on. Come on. Hurry up. You know what we do? We hang that picture upstairs, for the lady. Don't touch. You got everything ready? Shovel, axe, dynamite, pineapples? Where's the flash? Flash, flash. That's no the flash. That's a fish! I don't want the fish. Flash! Stop it. You crazy. When you go out at night, you gotta have the flash. That's no flash. That's a flisk. Flash. When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have the flash. That's a flush. What I gonna do with the flush? That's a flitz. What I gonna do with flitz? What do ya got? That's a flutz. All you got is a fish and a flutz and a flitz and a flutz... Stop this. Where's the flash? Look, when everything's light and you wanna make 'em dark. What ya do? Hey, you crazy. I want no blackjack. My mistake. When everything's dark and you wanna make 'em light. Yeah, that's a flash. That's a flash. Hey, that's good, alright. The storm put the lights out. Nobody can see what we do. Where's the flash? Where's the flash? I no want the fish. Flash. No, no flutz. What's the matter with you? Flash. Before the people are coming. What's a matter? You lose it? You gotta find it. Look for it. Alright, never mind. We'll work without it. Hide! Hide! Somebody's coming. Hide. Quiet, quiet. Shut up. Keep quiet. I know where you are. It's alright. Oh, Captain Spaulding, where are you? - Yeah? Oh, Captain... - What's the trouble? The lights have gone out. You can't see your hand before your face. It wouldn't be very pleasant, anyway. Well, I'm going to take a nap. Leave me a call for three o'clock. Make it three-thirty. The service here is excellent. Pardon me, did you lose a fish? - What? Somebody lost it. Will you have it fried for me? Did you hear that? Somebody's over there. I say somebody's over there. - Nonsense. The house is settling. Anybody over there? - I don't see anybody. There you are. If anybody was there, he'd see him, wouldn't I? What is it, Captain? What is it? You know what I think? I think you got roaches. You got roaches alright. And the biggest one has asthma. Horrible! Come on, Captain. This can't be the library. This must be the operating room. We get the picture and we don't make a sound. Somebody turned on the lights. Alright, we get the picture and don't make one sound. What do you want? Oh, the fish. Go on. That's some storm, eh? A regular tornado. Let's go this way. I think it's a shortcut. Come on, let's go. California. Before we start the musical program, Captain Spaulding will tell us about his trip to Africa. Captain Spaulding. - Me? Friends, I'm going to tell you of that great, mysterious, wonderful Africa. Africa is God's country, and he can have it. We left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2. After 15 days on the water and 6 on the boat, we reached Africa. We proceeded 300 miles inland, where I shot a polar bear. This bear was 6' 7"" in its stockinged feet, with shoes on. - Just a moment. I always thought polar bears lived in the frozen north. You did? This one was anemic and couldn't stand the cold. He was a rich bear and could afford the trip. You take care of your animals, and I'll take care of mine. Frozen north, my eye! From our arrival, we led an active life. The first morning saw us up at 6, breakfasted and back in bed at 7. This went on for 3 months. We got so we were able to be in bed by 6:30. One morning I was smoking some meat... Smoking some meat? - Yes, there was no cigar store. I was sitting in front of the cabin, when I bagged 6 tigers. Captain. Did you catch 6 tigers? I begged them to go away, but they hung around all day. They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen. The principal animals in Africa are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias. You all know what a moose is. The first day I shot two bucks. As I say, you all know what a moose is. A moose eats cheese and is chased by cats. The elks live in the hills, and hold their convention in the spring. It's interesting when they come to the waterhole. Boy, do they run when they see it's only a waterhole. What they're looking for is an alco-hole. One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in them, I don't know. We tried to remove the tusks. That's not so easy to say, tusks. Oh, simple. Tusks. My name is Spaulding. I've always wanted to meet you. As I say, we tried to remove the tusks, but we couldn't budge them. In Alabama, the tusks are looser. But that's entirely ir-elephant. We took pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed. But we're going back in a couple of weeks... Very enlightening. - Hooray for Captain Spaulding. Three cheers! Three cheers for Captain Spaulding! Three cheers... - No one asked for the chairs. Put them back. Now get along. Go on, go on! And now, friends, Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano. His first selection is ""Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping"" with a male chorus. Say, if you get near a song, play it. I can't think of the finish. That's strange. I can't think of anything else. You know what? I think I went past it. If you come around again, jump off. I once kept this up for three days. You wouldn't consider hush money, would you? I can't get 'em now. I've gotta wait for inspiration. - It's about time. Play the song about Montreal. - Montreal? ""I'm A Dreamer, Montreal."" Don't know it. I'll play one of my own compositions, by Victor Herbert. Make it short. He plays them both well. Your team scored that time. And the old blue one. Why do you push? - They may exterminate each other. The best thing for either of them. That one's for old Purdue. I was afraid of that. I thought I had the finish. - I wish you did. Yours. Play the song about the Irish chiropodist. ""My Fate Is In Your Hands"". Is there a horse in the house? They got everything else here. And now, Mrs. Rittenrotten... Rittenhouse. - Yes, a slight error. I have a surprise for you. The man is here for the piano. - Oh, Captain! When I departed from the natives in Africa, they gave me a gift. And this I give to you, at a low fare. - How wonderful. Don't be too hasty... - I can't wait... It was all done with the white of an egg. What is it, Captain? What is it? It's a hope chest for a guinea pig. This magnificent chest... No, this magnificent chest I present to you with my compliments. - This leaves me speechless. See that you remain that way. - And now, ladies and gentlemen... Step outside and say that. Mrs. Rittenhouse has perhaps a greater surprise for us in the library. This way, Captain. Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives? By the week or by the pound? And now it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of Franois Jacques DuBois Gilbert Beaugard. No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot. ""After the Hunt."" There! I said you were a great artist. Shall we spill the beans? - Wait. Something might happen. We'd all enjoy a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us something of Beaugard's life and work. And keep it clean! Mr. Chandler! My friends, you are all familiar with Beaugard. This is perhaps his masterpiece. In it he has achieved a greatness in the handling of color and line. Now you will see here... Wait! This is not my picture. This is a rank imitation. What do you mean? - See for yourself. You are right. It's not the Beaugard. - Certainly not. A dog is missing. Captain Spaulding, what shall I do? - Call the dog-catchers at once. They've taken the original. - I'll throw some light on this. Anyone have a match? - What happened? Hives, where are you? Turn on the lights. Did you lose that fish again? - I'm so worried. Good heavens. That one is gone, too. - Oh, this is awful. The crooks are escaping. Follow me, men. No, just the women! Right this way. They went out here. Oh, the excitement. I never saw anything so funny before. This is great. And there goes her old party. Wasn't it funny? - Oh, v-v-v-very. You're not afraid, are you? - Oh no. Not at all. But they were talking about the police and I don't want them suspecting me. They won't suspect you. - Oh yes! The last time they suspected me, I got four years. - Hives! You give me the painting, and I'll take care of it. - Good. Good heavens. It's gone. - Gone? - I left it in there. There must be thieves at this party. If I'd known that, I never would have come. Wait! That professor! - The Professor! I see! That's the culprit. We've got to get that picture away from him. Might I suggest this? Very satisfactory in these cases. A few drops on a handkerchief and the Professor is out. You're sure it'll work? - Absolutely. You want to try some? No thanks, Hives. Let's find the Professor. How did the thieves get away? And who was it? Lucky that we switched it. Imagine them getting the original. Oh? It would have been okay had they taken mine? I didn't mean that. But what would Mother do? It's worth $100,000. How could she have replaced it? Oh, I understand. Isn't it exciting? Just think, the thief was in the room with us. Isn't it romantic? All the boys I've known used to say I was made of stone. I would always leave them alone in despair. I've been on the pan, I've been called an electric fan, told I'm even much colder than Frigidaire. I began to wonder if I was all wrong. I thought so till you came along. Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic? When you're near, why am I so romantic? What a grand feeling, when your lips meet mine. That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine. I don't know what it is you've done to me. You don't know half of the good you do me. Other boys bore me, they just leave me blue. Oh, why am I so romantic with you? Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic? When you're near, why am I so romantic? What a grand feeling, when your lips touch mine. That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine. When we touch, close in your arms you hold me. I forget all that my mother told me. Other girls bore me, they just leave me blue. But why am I so romantic with you? Oh, Signor Ravelli! I've been looking for you all morning. I was busy all morning. - You've got to return that painting. Painting? What painting? The painting you changed last night. You mean the piksh? - Yes. First you want it upstairs, then downstairs. Make up your mind. I do thank you. But you've got to return it before the police come. The police are coming? - Yes. - I give it you. You put it back. Where's the piksh? - What do you mean? I put 'em in here. It's gone. You take 'em? - Me? No, I know. Abie the fish peddler. Did Mother invite a fish peddler here? I don't know, but he's here. Come on, we find him. Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Jamison. How is Captain Spaulding? He didn't sleep a wink. He went horseback riding last night. I'm sorry. We've all been pretty upset. Good morning, Captain. Did you enjoy your ride? What are you looking for? - I lost my horse. He slipped out from between me. I had my feet in the stirrups, too. Never mind. But I lost the bit you loaned me. I'll get you another bit. - Then I owe you two bits. I hope you weren't distressed by last night's sad occurrence. You mean dinner? - No, the stolen painting! A painting was stolen? I haven't seen one in three weeks. Why didn't you inform me? What do I engage you for? I didn't know it. - You should have asked me. I'm sorry. - You're sorry? You're a contemptible cur! I repeat. You're a contemptible cur. If I were a man, you'd resent that. Please keep quiet! I can get along without you. I got along without your father. And your uncle. And your uncle. And my uncle. I didn't come to be exonerated. - I beg your pardon. You do, eh? I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat. The police are here. - Have them come in. Oh, so that's your game. You can't shut me up! You can talk to my attorney. Jamison, take a letter to my lawyers. I'll show you a thing or two. Or three. I'll show you a thing or three. Sending for the police! Take a letter to my lawyers. Sending for the police! Take a letter to my lawyers. - I am. Read me what you have so far. Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, c/o Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga & McCormack. Semicolon. How do you spell ""semicolon""? - Alright, make it a comma. Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, Hungadunga... & McCormack. Gentlemen, question mark. Er-r-r! Do you want ""er-r-r"" in the letter? - No, put that in an envelope. Now then... In re yours of the 5 inst, yours to hand and beg to rep, brackets, that we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe, i.e., to wit, e.g., in lieu, that despite all our precautionary measures, we seem to believe it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment. Quotes, unquotes and quotes. Hoping this finds you... - Finds him where? Let him worry about that. Don't be so inquisitive. Sneak! Hoping this finds you, I beg to remain... I'll show you where I get off. Sending for the police. Now read me the letter. ""Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga."" That's it. ""C/ o Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga & McCormack."" You've left out a Hungadunga. You left out the main one, too. Thought you could slip one over on me, didn't you? Alright, leave it out. Put in a windshield wiper instead. I tell you what. Make it three windshield wipers and one Hungadunga. They won't all be there when the letter arrives. ""...and McCormack. Gentlemen, question mark."" Put it on the penultimate and not on the dipthonic. You should brush up on your Greek. Get a Greek and brush up on him. ""In re yours of the 5 inst."" - I see. A lot of things you said weren't important, so I just omitted them. Oh Captain! Good gracious. Omitted them, eh? You just omitted the body of the letter, that's all. Just left out the body of the letter. Yours is not to reason why. You've left out the body. Alright, send it that way and tell him the body will follow. The body in brackets? No, it'll never get there in brackets. Put it in a box. Put it in a box and mark it 'fragilly' Mark it what? - 'Fragilly! ' F-R-A-G... Look it up in the dictionary, under fragile. Look under the table if you don't find it there. ""Quotes, unquotes and quotes."" - 3 quotes? - Yes, sir. Add another and make it a gallon. Regards. - That's a fine letter, Jamison. That's an epic. Make two carbon copies and throw the original away. Then throw the copies away. Just send a stamp. Air mail. Mrs. Rittenhouse? I'm Inspector Hennessey. - How do you do? I'm Captain Scotland of Spaulding Yard. No. Spaulding, Scotland Yard. Don't make the same mistake again. - I'm glad to know you. Between us we can solve this crime. Especially if you go home. No hasty arrests, please! I don't want my guests embarrassed. We won't arrest anybody. - He's lucky to not go jail himself. Would you take the Inspector and his men to the scene of the crime. Certainly. This way. Come on, boys. Jamison, count the spoons. I didn't know you'd been a detective. - There's a lot you don't know. I suppose so. - Darn right! Where were you on June 5, 1774? I don't know. - Where was I? I don't know. - Me neither. If I did, I wouldn't tell you. Take a number from 1 to 10. - Alright. Which one? - 7. - That's right. 7 is right. I could solve this in 5 minutes if I wanted to worry. I don't want you to worry. Nothing should interfere with your weekend. Nothing interferes with my weak end. And don't be so personal! Where's my secretary? Jamison! - I didn't want to offend you. Dastardly cracker! I wish I was in the jungle where men are monkeys. Captain, I'm so sorry. - Jamison! No, no. Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse! - Good morning. Charming party. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. It's just full of surprises. - Glad you're enjoying yourself. Hives! Good morning. Some breakfast? - Nothing doing. Where's the painting? I watched all night, but the Professor did not sleep in his room. Very strange. - Good heavens. What will we do? I don't know. Until we see the Professor... You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle. Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time. Did you get it? - Yes. - I'll engage him in conversation. You trail behind and knock him out when the time comes. Very good, madam. Hello. I've been looking all over for you! Where were you? What's the matter with this? Are they the morning papers? No, that isn't the one I want. Show me the others. That still isn't the one. Out! Yes, out! The birds... Come on, sit down. I want to talk. Don't you like me? You don't? Well, I like you. I like little boys like you. How old are you? Five years old? You're just a baby. Oh, isn't that nice? I like that. No, no, no. All joking aside, isn't there someone you do like? Isn't there someone you love? Think again. Isn't there someone you really and truly love? Is there? Tell me who! Why, that's a horse! You love a horse? Come on, lift him up. Come on. He's out. - Let's go. Arabella! - I've been trying to find you. Ravelli has lost the painting. I just found one on the terrace. The Beaugard? - No. - Oh, yours? If it's not yours, and not the Beaugard, whose is it? Someone switched it for mine, thinking they got the original. Somebody swiped my scheme, eh? Then Chandler never saw your painting? - No. You may still be a great artist. Where is this picture? Up in my room. - You get it and I'll get the Captain. He'll get to the bottom of this. Then John found the third painting. - Very interesting. Well, sort of. We have to keep our eyes open. - If I don't find it, Mother's out $100,000. Give me 24 hours for the case. Then we'll call in someone else. Wait till tomorrow. Remember the Charlie Ross case? I was on that, and he was never found. Captain Yard of Scotland Spaulding always gets his women, or paintings. Do you know what's happened with the painting I found? It's been stolen from my room. You see! I've been on the case five minutes and another one is gone. I bet it's not even three minutes. My watch is gone. This is too much. It wasn't going, and now it's gone. And my room was locked. - Who could it have been? Wait. I think I've got a clue. No, it's a red hair. The Professor? No, it couldn't be. He's Crook of the Month this month. Anyhow, we'll investigate it. You know Conductor Hennessey? - Inspector! Inspect her yourself. You know that redheaded fellow? - Yes. Well, get those flagpole sitters of yours to find him. Come on, boys. We'll soon get to the bottom of this. Hey, what's that cop doing there? It didn't take that long to find him. - This is it! Yes, but which one is it? - The one just taken from my room. Maybe my watch is back, too. Now the fob is gone! Well, I still got the pocket. Anything I retain now is velvet. Except the coat. That's Prince Albert. Well, all the jokes can't be good. If we find the fella who painted this, it'd be a pretty good clue. - What? If we find the fella who painted this, it'd be a pretty good clue. You just said that. How dull you turned out to be! Let me see that a minute. It's signed ""Beaugard"". There's the criminal. No. Beaugard is dead. Dead? Then it's murder! Now we've got something. What do you got? - Jacks and aces. And you? Good. I was bluffing. - Does something strike you funny about this picture? It isn't as funny as all that. Did you ever see a tree like that? Tree? That's a spinach. - It can't be. Where's the egg? It could be spinach. Look at all the sand. You mean it's an old Spinach custom? No, it's not that. No. That's my mistake. You know what it is? Coleslaw. Coleslaw? - Yeah. Did you ever see a coleslaw like that? - Sure, look at this. I don't want any of your lip now. Did you ever see anything like that? You know what this is? A left-handed painting. There's a signature. - That's right. This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner. If we can find the left-handed person, we'll have ""The Trial of Mary Dugan"". I saw that. Goodbye. - Wait. I'm going to need you. We mustn't lose this evidence. Take it to your room and leave the door open this time. And not a word about this to anybody. Not even to me. Ravelli, we've got to find the left-handed painting. The first thing to do is to find the motive. What was the motive of the Beaugard crooks? I got it. Robbery! Would you mind crossing the street when it's red? Si, Capt' Sit down. I know how we find this painting. In such a mysterious case, you gotta get the clues. You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method. It goes like this: You say, ""What happened?"" The answer: ""Something was stolen."" You say, ""What was stolen?"" The answer come back: ""A painting."" Are you a ventriloquist? Now you say, ""Where was this painting stolen?"" The answer: ""In this house."" Now, so far I'm right? It's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself. You go a little further and say, ""Who stole the painting?"" A very important question. When you answer it, you got the whole solution. Especially if you find the picture. Now put all the clues together and what do ya got? - Bread pudding. No. Something was stolen. Where? In this house. By who? Somebody here. Now all you gotta do is ask everyone in the house if they took it. I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters. You're going to ask everyone here if they took the painting? And suppose no one here took it? - Go next door. Great. Suppose there is no house next door? Well, then we gotta build one. Now you're talking. What kind of house should we build? My idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable. Exactly, nothing elaborate. A little place to call home and tell the wife I'm not coming for dinner. I see. You want a telephone booth. No, in that case I'd just call Chic Sale. What do ya say we build right about here? Here? - Yeah, here. - I'd like it over here if possible. I don't like junior crossing the rails on his way to reform school. Actually I don't like junior at all. Alright. We got something over there, and believe me, that's convenient. You just open the door, step outside, and there you are. There you are? Where? - Outside. If you want to get back in again? - You had no right to go out. Don't do anything until I hear from you, will you? Maybe the painting is in the cellar! - That's no cellar, that's the roof. Down there? - Yeah, so the chimney don't get wet when it rains. I'm off to get x-rayed. I'll be back in a little while. I think you're wrong, Ravelli. - Don't get excited. Here's the rooms. This is your room. This is mine. And this is the maid's room. I'd have to go through your room? That's alright, I won't be in it. You couldn't put the maid in your room? - Who says I couldn't? There's going to be a lot of traffic. I can see that. Well, what do ya say? You ready to sign the lease? I'd like to talk to my husband first. Could you come back later? You married? - I've got a girl as big as you are. Alright. Get me one. - Don't get vulgar, Ravelli. How about the painting? We take care of that. I'll tell you my idea. The kitchen should be white. Outside, green. Inside, cerise. The painting, I say! What you think I talk? Painting the kitchen white... The painting that was stolen! - Stolen? Don't you remember? Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a painting worth $100,000. No, I'm a stranger here. What do you think I am? One of the early settlers? Don't you remember Mrs. Beaugard lost a Rittenhouse oil painting? No, but I've seen you someplace before. Yeah, I was there. But I'll stay away in the future. Hey, Capt! It come to me like a flash! This painting wasn't stolen. It has disappeared. Yes, disappeared. And you know what make it disappear? Moths! Moths eat it! Left-handed moths! Go away. I'll be alright in a minute. Left-handed moths ate it? - That's my own solution. I wish you were in it. Left-handed moths! I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open. Hey, I got pair of shoes. He's crazy. Let's go and get the reward. We solved it. You solved it. It was eaten by left-handed moths. - We did good work. Are you tired? Lie down for a couple of years. Lie down until rigor mortis sets in. I know what we'll do. Go to court to get a writ of habeas corpus. To get rid of what? I never should have started that way. I say, we'll go to court to get a writ of habeas corpus. Yes, corpus. - Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus? No, but I see ""Habeas Irish Rose"". Good morning. - Good morning. Why don't you go to the beach with the others? You'd feel better. I'd feel better with my Beaugard. We're doing everything we can. Mrs. Rittenhouse! I have it! - The Beaugard! Wonderful! My Beaugard! Wait. This is a rank imitation. Where did you find it? In Mr. Parker's room, madam. - Parker? One thing is certain. Whoever did this also stole the Beaugard. Hives, ask Mr. Parker to come here. Wait. My men will bring him in. Get Mr. Parker. What's wrong with this? - It's obvious that it's a rank imitation. Mother, what's wrong? Something very strange has occurred and only you can explain it. Gladly. We found this in your room. What have you done with the original? Come clean! - I think it would be wise... I don't know where the Beaugard is. Why did we find this in your room? You'd better come with me. You can't take him. This program is coming to you from the House of David. Either this suit is on upside-down or there is no law of gravity. Einstein or no Einstein. - My tie! Captain, what shall I do? They're going to arrest John. Who? - I am! In Scotland Yard they teach you never to arrest an innocent man. He's not innocent. I'll have to arrest him. Of course, or nobody's safe here. You can't arrest him. I stole it. - Don't listen to her. I did it. They're both lying. I did it. - He's crazy. I confess. I did it. Maybe there was no painting. - That's right. I saw it. Stop this! Who stole the painting? I did! - Good gracious. You? You took the picture? Where is it? Aw, that's a horse. That is my Beaugard! - No, that isn't your Beaugard. Ridiculous. I paid $100,000 for this. I know what I bought. Look at the signature. John Parker. Somebody changed it. That is my Beaugard! That's it, I tell you. But that one has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard. Only a master could have produced a painting like that. You mean, you painted it? - Yes, sir. - You're a genius. I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately. It'll have to wait until tomorrow. I'm going to be busy all day. - Yes. You come with me. - Don't take him away, officer. He returned the paintings. My name is Spaulding. I've always wanted to meet you. Alright. Just this time. But I want to tell you something. You're running around with the wrong people. You wanna be a crook? Why don't you go home? - He's got no home. Go home and stay home. Your poor old mother sits there... ...sits there, night after... night after night... waiting to hear your steps on the stairs. - Ain't got no stairs. And I can see a little light burns in the window. No you can't! The gas company turned it off. What I'm telling you is for your own good. And if you listen to me, you can't go wrong. This may go on for years. - There's just one thing... What's delaying that coffee pot? Where's the cream? - You certainly surprised me. Me too. I thought he had more. - No use giving you any advice. Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him. Come on. Oh, what are you doing? My dear! What's the idea? - Take a letter to my lawyers. Oh no, don't! Anything but... That I've got to go! So young! Good. Let's get out of here before they all wake up. Hurry up., ""Senator Samuel Foley dead."" Died here at Saint Vincent's. ""At the bedside was political sidekick Senator Joseph Paine."" Long distance? Joseph Paine speaking. I want the governor's residence, Jackson City. Oh, Joe! Oh, no! Couldn't have happened at a worse time. Call Jim Taylor. Tell him I'm flying home tonight. Right away. What is it? - Sam Foley's dead. - Great saints! Of all times... ...Foley had to go and die on us. Who are you calling? Taylor, my dear. What's up, Happy? Sam Foley died tonight. That's too bad. Well, don't get excited. Is Paine coming? Yes, Jim. Yes, Jim. He'd drop dead if you ever said no. My dear, this is no time for jokes. I've got to appoint a new senator. The governor will see all committees. The governor will see all committees. Tell him I won't wait any longer. Probably got Taylor in there, telling him what to do. Tell them to wait. I'll see them immediately. I can't put those howling citizens off any longer. They'll want something to say about who takes Foley's place. Ten to one they've got a man. Relax, Happy. Stop having kittens. Go and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine... ...I'll give them one more minute to make up their minds. You go tell Jim Taylor. I will tell him. It's high time I told Jim Taylor a thing or two. If you and Joe gab any longer about this appointment... ...I'll see those committees. You'll see them when we're finished. But hurry, will you? That's telling him, Happy, old boy. Jim... ...with this Willet Creek Dam coming up... ...the man who takes Foley's place... ...can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him. That's why I say Horace Miller. He'll take orders all right. Suppose we don't try to go through with this dam. Suppose we postpone it until next session of Congress. Or drop it altogether. That'd be a crime, Joe. After all the work we put in on it? Burying it in this deficiency bill... ...as nicely as you please. Having it approved. It's rolling along. Like taking candy from a baby. Is it worth the risk of a scandal, with a new man in the Senate? Worth the risk? What's the matter with you? Where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk... ...especially with your great reputation in the Senate. Here, look. Look at the campaign I started for you in all my papers. A little obscure, isn't it? I don't know. Maybe. But after all, you're the logical man from the West... ...for the national ticket. At the convention, anything can happen. If what you say is possible... ...why not do as I say and drop things like this dam? We can't do it, Joe. We've been quietly buying all the land around that dam... ...and holding it in dummy names. If we drop it now, it'll bring about an investigation. It'll show that we're going to sell it to the state... ...under phony names. The smartest thing for us to do... ...is to push this dam through... ...and get it over with. All right, appoint Miller. If you're sure he'll take orders. Don't worry. He'll take orders. Come on. Just a minute. Just one more minute! We've got your man. Horace Miller. A born stooge! Horace will perform like a trained seal. What did I tell you? If I throw a party man like Miller... For reasons I can't go into, it's got to be him. Do you understand? Now make out your ticket. Come on. But I've got to see those angry committees first. Work for harmony. Harmony! In considering candidates who might have the high qualifications... ...of U.S. senator... ...one name shone out like a beacon... ...the Honorable Horace Miller. A party man. He's Taylor's stooge! Please! New Citizens Committee won't stand for this! So they named their own candidate, eh? Who? - You won't like him. - Come on, who? Henry Hill. That crackpot? You should've killed that so fast... I couldn't. - Those men were... - Never mind. You forget about them. That bunch is out for blood. If l... I said forget about them. Horace Miller goes to the Senate, and that settles it. I won't send Horace Miller. - You won't? - No, I won't. I won't let you callously wreck my whole political future. Your political future? I bought it for you as a present. I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head swim. You've got a nerve to sit and worry about your future... ...when we're in a spot like this. The man is Miller. Hello, Dad. What's the matter? Is it getting you down? Is what getting me down? You're in a deuce of a pickle. Looks like Henry Hill or else. It's Horace Miller or else. Peter! I wouldn't appoint a twerp like Miller, Taylor or no Taylor. May I ask what Taylor has to do with this? He's still running the show, ain't he? I won't have conversation of this sort carried on at dinner. Why don't you listen to them for a change? No doubt they can make this appointment for me with ease. That's easy. Jefferson Smith. I beg your pardon? He's the only senator to have. He ought to be President. I like Jeff Smith. You too? Now everybody's been heard from. Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know him from a hole in the ground. - Gosh, head of the Boy Rangers! - Oh, a boy? No, Dad. Jeff's a man. Jeff Smith. Biggest expert we got in wild game... Right now he's the greatest hero we ever had. It's all over the headlines. Didn't you see about the forest fire all around Sweetwater? I did. What about it? - Jeff put that out himself. - Himself? If you really want a senator... I do not want a senator. I do not want any more nonsense. He's the greatest American we got. He can tell you what George Washington said, by heart. And Stuff has the swellest stuff in it. What ""stuff""? Boys' Stuff. The name of Jeff's paper. He prints it. Look, here's one. Everybody reads it. All the kids in the state. A million of them. Let me read... I'm in no mood to listen to childish prattle. Prattle? You're all wet. You couldn't do better. - Better than what? - Jeff for senator. Emma, if you please! Want to get out of a pickle, don't you? Always looking for votes, aren't you? Here's 50,000 kids, two folks each, and they vote. If you want to do some good in this state... If you're ever going to stand up like a man... That settles it! I won't be belittled by my own children in my own home. All my nerves are strained to the breaking point! Henry Hill.... Horace Miller.... Miller? Hill? Hill? Miller? Heads, Hill. Tails, Miller. That's good enough for me. Good evening. Is Jefferson Smith at home? Won't you step in? - A Boy Ranger to the U.S. Senate? - Listen. The simpleton of all times. A big-eyed patriot. Knows Lincoln and Washington by heart. Stands at attention in the governor's presence. Collects stray boys and cats. He does what? You know, a perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't know what it's all about in 2 years, let alone 2 months. The important thing... ...this was the genius of the stroke... ...it means votes. The hero of 50,000 boys and 100,000 parents. Look over those congratulations pouring in. I tell you, gentlemen... You made this appointment without asking me. When lightning strikes... - You didn't ask me. Now wait a minute, Jim. Happy may have hit on something here. There, you see? Do you really think you can handle him in Washington? Do you think it's all right? I think it's all right. A young patriot... ...recites Lincoln and Jefferson... ...turned loose in our nation's capitol. I think it's all right. Chick. Turn the ballyhoo boys loose. It's the greatest appointment ever made. Give a banquet and declare a holiday. A star-spangled banquet! And how did your governor confer that honor? Did he give it to some wealthy citizen, merely to curry favor? No! Did he give it to some unworthy political hireling? What did he do? He went down... ...among the people. And there he found... ...a nugget. It is in that spirit that we're here tonight... ...to acclaim and wish Godspeed to Senator... ...Jefferson Smith. Thank you. I can't help feeling... ...that there's been a big mistake somehow. Of course, I never could see... ...why we needed two senators from this state... ...when we have a man like Joseph Harrison Paine... ...representing us. He doesn't remember me. He knew my father very well. Clayton Smith. They... ...went to school together. They were very good friends. Just to... sit here with him... ...is a very great honor for me... ...because I remember Dad used to tell me that... ...Joe Paine was the finest man he ever knew. Go on, get up. Take a bow! I don't think I'll be much help to you down there in Washington, senator. I'll do my best. Although with all my might... ...I can promise you one thing: I'll do nothing to disgrace the office of... ...United States Senate. Senator Jefferson Smith... ...the Boy Rangers are very proud... ...to take this opportun... Occasion! We are happy to take this opportunity... To present.... To resent this... ...small token of our affection and esteem... ...to the best... Friend! Aw, heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff. We all pitched in. For to carry your laws when you get to Washington. It isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. Boys' Stuff. Why, printer's ink runs in your veins. You're just like your father. - Thank you, sir. - Even to the hat. Same old dreamer too. One look at you and I can see him... ...back at his roll-top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher. And champion of lost causes. Dad used to say the only causes worth fighting for were the lost causes. You don't have to tell me. We were a team, the two of us. Struggling editor and the struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they called us. Ma's told me about it a thousand times. His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper... ...against that mining syndicate. All to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. They tried everything. Bribery... ...intimidation. And then.... Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning. Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him. At that old roll-top desk. Still with his hat on. Still with his hat on. I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine... ...when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that... ...one man by himself can't get very far, can he? Washington, huh? Yes, senator, for the fifth time. Washington. I'd better see about my pigeons. The porter has them. Just a second. I'd better make sure. Joe, my head's like a balloon. Two whole days! I never knew there was so much American history. They're all right. That's fine. That ends that crisis. Come along, senator. Hello, Father! - I saw! - He's mine! Let me get to him. I don't care to meet him till I get my money. A dollar each, please, for the milk fund. That's $5. You've got $5, haven't you? Can't seem to find anything except keys. Jeff, this is my daughter Susan and her friends. - Not the new senator? - He's marvelous. What have you got there, senator? - They're pigeons. - To carry messages back to Ma. It's just for fun. The one that makes it home in the best time... ...I'll enter in the Nationals. - Joe! - Hello, Chick. - Hello, Joe. - Carl, how are you? Glad to see you, Bill. Jeff, come here. Meet Cook and Griffith, from State Headquarters. Great pleasure. You'll do the old state proud. Welcome. The wildlife here is different from what you're used to. They wear high heels. We must see a lot of you... - ...and your little feathered friends. - Thank you very much. Come on, Father. Chick. I've got him. We'll be along. Good luck, senator. Goodbye. Things sure happen fast around here. You'll have to get yourself out of low gear. Let's get these bags and livestock. Okay, Chick. Look, there it is! Who? What? The Capitol dome. Yes, sir, big as life. Been there a long time now. Yes, sir. This way, senator. We thought we'd meet him in short pants... ...with hatchets. Taxi. What's he got pigeons for? What for? Suppose there's a storm. The lines are down. How you going to get messages back to Ma? This way, senator. Where is he? Senator? I told that Cookie to.... Let's find him. Senator! Senator Smith? Positively not in the station. What happened? Did you look in the...? I'll brain that guy. Call Paine. Call Saunders. Call the Marines. Call somebody! Saunders? McGann. Has Smith showed up at his office there yet? What do you mean, the slip? What's so funny? Nothing. Why don't you try a butterfly net? If he shows up... ...Paine's waiting at the hotel with newspapermen. Let him know right away. Understand? I'll hang a light in the belfry. One if by land and two if by sea. - Diz? - Yeah. What do you think? Daniel Boone's lost. Lost in the wilds of Washington. If your boyfriend's going to blaze trails... ...I'm going to the press club. Stick around. He might want us to put on short pants and go hiking. You wouldn't want to miss the exercise. When I think of exercise, I have to lie down... ...until the feeling leaves me. Wouldn't it be funny if he was lost? The Boy Ranger? Oh, he'll show up. He must have a compass with him. Where would I go if I were a Boy Ranger? Boy, am I tired. I'm all in! Call all the hospitals. And get me a bed while you're at it! Boss, will you hold this a minute? Thank you, sir. Here! Come back here! ...that from these honored dead we take... ...increased devotion that that cause for which they... ...gave the last full measure... ...of devotion... ...that we here highly.... - Resolve. - Resolve... ...that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation... ...under God, shall have a new birth of.... Freedom. Freedom. And that government, of the people... ...by the people... ...for the people... ...shall not perish from the earth. Why don't they try the police? Call out some bloodhounds... ...or Indian guides. One place he knows is the Senate office. You stay there and wait. All right, another half-hour. Just one half-hour. Goodbye. Oh, why don't I quit? Eight to five, little boy blue's plastered. When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times have I said I'm fed up with politics and l... No, I let them talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes. Would you settle for a husband? I sure would. You know my old standing offer. Diz Moore... ...poet of Washington correspondents. Oh, that again. I'd cherish you... ...and I'd stay sober. Diz, you're a wonderful egg. I don't know, maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed or something.... I don't think even that would do it. No point in combing my hair for nothing. ""Honorary appointment."" Scratch this and you'll find they need a dope here for a couple of months. Yes? Yes! What do you want? Office of Jefferson Smith? The man downstairs said... They sure must have picked the prize dummy... Say, wait a minute! That wouldn't be Daniel Boone? Say, mister... ...what's your name? Jefferson Smith. Oh, yes, please... ...come right in, Mr. Smith. This way. Now, hold everything. Stay there. Now, don't move! Helen! Get me the Madison. Senator Paine. Hurry up, will you? Is anything the matter? My dear senator... ...it may be customary out on the prairie to take leave of people... ...and not show up for five hours... I'm very sorry about that, Miss Sau... You are Miss Saunders, aren't you? Yes, and this is Mr. Moore, member of the press. Mr. Moore, meet... ...the senator. I'm very happy to know you. I see you cut your way through that forest. Senator Paine. We've got him! Came in on his own power, and he's sober. Next thing on the schedule, I'll have him over there. Now.... I'm awfully sorry. It wasn't until I was well along on the bus that... Did you say bus? It was one of those sightseers, you know? And... ...I've never been called absent-minded before... ...but there it was, all of a sudden. It was staring at me through the station doors. There what was? The dome. The Capitol dome. As big as life, sparkling away under the old sun out there. And l... ...I just... ...started to go toward it. There was a bus outside and... ...I just naturally got aboard. Most natural thing in the world. I don't think I've ever been so thrilled in my whole life. And that Lincoln Memorial! Gee whiz! Why, Mr. Lincoln, there he is. He's looking right straight at you as you come up those steps. Just sitting there, like he was waiting for somebody to come along. Well, he's got nothing on me. Oh, I'm sorry. If you're ready, we'll go to the hotel. Senator Paine's waiting for you. This is my office? No, you'll have a private office. - In there. - Private office? In there? Right in this door? All right, now, senator.... Where is he? Has he gone out again? He's in there. I'll see you later. I got to go out and drink this over. Whose statue's that? I wouldn't know, in the daytime. You wouldn't? Oh, look! Look at the Capitol dome! It's all lighted up. You better relax, senator. You'll get yourself plum wore out. Gee whiz! So many things happening all at once. Miss Saunders, what time does the Senate.... Convene? - Twelve noon. - Twelve noon, huh? Oh, boy, that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning? No, what had you better? I think I better go out to Mount Vernon. Be sort of a fine thing to do. Visit Washington's home before walking into the Senate for the first time. Think it's a good idea? Wonderful! Puts you right in the mood. What's that? What's that? Movie houses. Hi, Saunders. I'm still asking myself, what is he: Animal, vegetable or mineral? Maybe an oyster. When I think of myself playing straight for that phony, patriotic chatter. Me! Carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists. I can't take it, Diz. I quit. I'm through. Now take it easy. Simmer down. Here. Take this. Know what he's doing tomorrow before taking the Senate seat? Going up to Mount Vernon... ...to get in the mood. A warm-up. Who? Your boss? A nut! I knew there was a story in him. I smelled it! Go chase an ambulance. It's meat and drink to me. Let me at him five minutes. I'll make it right. What do you mean ""right""? I'll tell you what I'll do. World Series. A pass! In a month it'll be worth 15 bucks. Well! You're not talking to this guy. - What do you say? - Nothing. Beat it. How would your pals like to get in on this? - I want a scoop. - Beat it! That's out. Either it's lots of reporters and tickets, or.... Better call him before I change my mind. Okay. I'll see you right here. What are you going to do? Get my whole fall outfit and quit this job in style. You've got more sense than to put Nosey on to that guy. Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Tell us about yourself. I hear you got a boys' club, senator. Any special ax to grind? - Ax? - You know. Pet idea. Save the buffaloes, pension bill. You must have one idea that would be good for the country. Well, I have got one idea. That's what we want. For the last couple years, I've thought it would be... ...a wonderful idea to have a national boys' camp in our state. Boys' camp? Sure. Very good! If we could get poor kids off the streets... ...out of the cities for a few months in the summer... ...and let them learn something about nature... ...American ideals.... Marvelous. What would it cost the government? Nothing. Nothing at all. You see... ...the government just lends us the money for the camp... ...and then the boys... ...pay it back by sending pennies, nickels, nothing more than a dime. That's really something. Government's got enough to do without... The government's putting too much dough... ...in too many places now, boys. Well, now, senator, tell me... ...what do you think of the girls in this town? Down at the station, four of them... ...kissed me when I got off the train. Were they pretty? - Pretty? That Miss Susan Paine... ...is about the prettiest I ever saw. Senator, you got a good eye! How about some more pictures? You're a nature lover... ...can you handle sign language? I could manage, if... What about birdcalls? You know any? - Can you make a sound like an eagle? - How about a bobwhite? Here's one. I'm the only one in the state... ...that knows this one. We could use that! His ""First 'Whiff' of Washington""? Do I actually see this? What is it? Did you want to see me? What's this I hear about your quitting? - I'm not a nurse. Stop being funny. How'd this happen? - I haven't the slightest idea. - Yes, you have. How'd it happen? I merely took him home. I didn't tuck him in. That's McGann's job. McGann just phoned. Smith's gone again. Do you know where? He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address. That's fine. Now you go back to Smith's office... ...and get him to the Senate by 12:00. Senator, I wasn't given a brain... ...just to tell a Boy Ranger the time. Don't be a fool. If certain things happen... ...you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington. When I came here, my eyes were big blue question marks... ...now they're big green dollar marks. Smart girl, eh? Finish this job properly and you'll get a bonus. I mean, keep Smith away... ...from anything that smacks of politics. Including Willet Creek Dam? Including Willet Creek Dam. Now go back to your work. This is it, senator. The United States Senate. Come on. Mr. Carson, Senator Smith. - How do you do? - How do you do, senator? Page! - Glad to see you. - Thank you. Show Senator Smith to his seat. Right this way, sir. Well, goodbye. Wish me luck. - Sure. Bye. So that's the boy wonder? I don't know what the Senate's coming to. - Hi, Diz. - Hello, Saunders. Daryl, Sweeney. I see you got Daniel Boone in all right. Daniel in the lion's den. Nice job you and the ambulance chasers did... ...in the papers this morning. - Did you like it? - Great. Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it. Daniel Webster sat here? Holy mackerel! Give you something to shoot at, if you figure on doing any talking. I'm just going to sit and listen. That's the way to get re-elected. This is the calendar for the day. You'll find this and a manual, in here. Anything else... ...just snap for a page. Where's the majority leader? Majority leader? Right over there. Senator Agnew. That's Senator Barnes, the minority leader. Where's the press gallery? There, above the vice president's chair. Those in the front row represent the big news services. What's up there? That's for guides and sightseers... ...who come in for five minutes at a time to rest their feet. That section is reserved for the senators' friends. Front row, the empty one, is for the President and his guests. I see. Over the clock is the diplomatic section. They and the pageboys are the only real class we have here. - Thanks so much. - I'll take your hat to the cloakroom. I want to give you a Boy Ranger button. Swell! What's your name? - Richard Jones. Thanks ever so much. Good luck, senator. Keep your left up. - See you in the White House, Joe. - You're not kidding! - Jeff. - Hello, senator. I was in committee. That's all right, sir. I see you had a little publicity. Have you got your credentials? Miss Saunders gave them to me. Is that right? That's fine. When the vice president calls you... - ...I'll meet you in the center aisle. - Center aisle. This is Daniel Webster's desk. Did you know that? He won't mind. The Senate will come to order. Chaplain will pray. Oh, God, our Heavenly Father... ...in these critical days... ...when our beloved country labors with such grave problems... ...look upon us... ...and give us the strength to be just and merciful... ...so we may best serve our people... ...and our fellow men everywhere. Amen. - Clerk will read... - Mr. President... ...I ask unanimous consent the reading of the journal be dispensed with. Is there objection? Journal stands approved. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum. Clerk will call the roll. - Mr. Agnew. - Here. - Mr. Albert. - Here. - Mr. Alfred. - Here. 88 senators have answered to their names, all as present. - Mr. President. - Senator Paine. I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith... ...who has just been appointed by the governor of my state. The designate is present. I ask that the oath of office be administered at this time. The senator designate will present himself. The oath will be administered. Mr. President... ...I rise to a question of order. - Here it comes. - I seek to ascertain if the gentleman... ...about to be sworn in is aware of the responsibilities of his office. I refer to his shameless performance... ...for the newspapers. A versatile performance, I grant you... ...and one that his party, no doubt, will applaud. But one that lowers his rank... ...to the level of a sideshow entertainer... ...and reflects on the sincerity, if not the sanity... ...of the highest body of lawmakers in the land. I seek to learn if this is the gentleman's conception... ...of the nature of his office. I don't understand. The designate has no voice here until taking the oath of office. Mr. President, I will answer the gentleman. My colleague was innocent in this matter. He was completely misquoted. I know Jefferson Smith, and I will personally vouch for him. He has the greatest respect for his office and for these gentleman. Mr. President. The swearing in of the senator designate is the order of business. The gentleman will raise his right hand. Do you swear to support... ...and defend the Constitution of the United States... ...against all enemies, foreign and domestic... ...and that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same? That you take this obligation freely... ...without mental reservation or purpose of evasion... ...and that you will faithfully discharge the duties of this office... ...so help you God? I do. Senator, you can talk all you want to now. Meet the majority leader. He'll be a good friend to you. How do you do, sir? Any friend of Joe's is a friend of mine. Don't worry about the others, they're just senators. - Mr. President. - Senator MacPherson. The shameless way the deficiency bill has been delayed... ...is nothing short of criminal. Government agencies are in desperate need of these funds. The prime business of this body is the immediate passage.... - Hello, Nosey. Who let you in here? Why aren't you chasing ambulances? Smith's punching everybody he meets. I just got away. Uh-oh, Tarzan! Boys, meet Senator Smith. You act like something's on your mind. Why don't you tell the people the truth? - The truth? - He wants the truth! The man wants the truth. ""'What is the truth?' said jesting Pilate... ...and would not stay for an answer."" How do you want it? Dished out or in a bottle? People pick up their papers, and what do they read? This morning they read that a clown arrived in Washington... ...parading like a member of the Senate. If you thought as much about being honest as you do about being smart.... We're the only ones who can be honest in what we tell the voters. We don't have to be re-elected, like politicians. We tell them when phonies and crackpots come here to make their laws. If you want the truth, why are you in the Senate? What do you know about making laws? Or what the people need? I don't pretend to know. Then what are you doing in the Senate? What's he doing? Why, honorary appointment! When the country needs men who know and have courage as it never did before... ...he's going to decorate a chair and get honored. But he'll vote! Just like his colleague tells him too. Like a Christmas tiger, he'll nod his head and vote... ...""Yes!"" You're not a senator. You're an honorary stooge. You ought to be shown up. Have a drink, senator? It'll taste better than the truth. Hey, senator. Don't let it get you down. 100 years from now, nobody'll know the difference. The point is, sir, they're right. I'm just sitting in the Senate, decorating a chair. If I'm going to vote, I ought to study the bills that are coming up. The bills? Yes, sir. Otherwise, I'm just a Christmas tiger, like they said. These bills are put together by legal minds after long study. I can't understand half of them myself, and I was a lawyer. Come on. Forget it. I'll advise you how to vote. I know you will. That's the point. There's no reason for me to be here. Didn't you say something about wanting to create a national boys' camp? - You were in earnest, weren't you? - Yes, I was. Why don't you do it? There's a job for you. Get a bill started. Present it to Congress. It will be great experience. Senator Paine, I've been aching to mention it to you. If I could do that one thing while I'm here, I'd feel... What's to stop you? Saunders will help you. Well, I'll do it. I will! I knew if anyone could help me, you could. Thank you again for your time. Good night. Where are you running off to? I'm anxious to get back to the office. The man on the front page! - He just dropped in for a minute. - How do you do, senator? How do you do, Miss Paine? I'm on my way to the office. - How are the pigeons? - They're fine. I miss the dear little things. I released one this morning with a letter. He flew right straight up in the air to get his bearings. He went around the Capitol dome, then headed west, like a bat out of... Just like a rifle shot. I suppose by about this time... ...he's probably over Kentucky. Isn't that wonderful, Father? And was the letter to your girl? No, I don't have a girl. Don't you think I'd better hold this for you? No, I think I'd better go. Good night. Doggone! It's all right, sir. That's all right, my boy. Don't bother. Gee, I'm sorry. Good night. Good night, Jeff. Good night. Oh, Father! Dear me! At the expense of some of the furniture... ...you've made another conquest. Not old Honest Abe! And with Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man these days, Susan. We're going ahead with it. Ahead with what? My bill for a national boys' camp. Where's my briefcase? Do I understand... ...that you're going to present a bill? Senator Paine and I decided... Senator Paine decided with you? I should have been the one to think of it. My dear senator... ...have you the faintest idea how to get a bill passed? No. You're going to help me. If I were triplets I could. Senator Paine said you'd help me. What do we have to have? Look, do you mind... ...if I give you a rough idea what you're up against? No, go ahead. A senator has a bill in mind, like your camp, right? What does he do? He has to sit down and write it. The why, when, where, how and everything else. That takes time. But this one is so simple. I see. This one's simple. - And with your help... - Oh, I'm helping. Simple, and I'm helping... ...so we knock it off in record time, say three or four days. Oh, a day. - A day? - Yes, just tonight. Tonight. I don't want to complain... ...but in civilized countries there's an institution called ""dinner."" I'm sort of hungry myself. Couldn't we have some stuff brought in on trays, like big executives? Oh, sure. Dinner comes in on trays. We light into this... And we finish the bill before morning. It's dawn. Your bill is ready. You introduce it. How? You get to your feet... ...take a breath, and start spouting. Not too loud. A couple of the senators might want to sleep. A curly-headed pageboy takes it to the desk... ...where a clerk reads it, refers it to a committee... Committee, huh? Why? Committees. Small groups of senators have to sift a bill down... ...study it, and report to the Senate. Can't take a bill nobody ever heard of... ...and discuss it among 96 men. Where would you get? I see that. Good. Now, where are we? Some committee's got it. Days are going by, senator. Days, weeks! Finally, they think it's quite a bill. It goes to the House of Representatives for a vote... - ...but waits on the calendar. - Calendar? That's the order of business. Your bill has to stand back in line... - ...unless the steering committee... What's that? Steering committee? Do you really think we're getting anywhere? Tell me, what's the steering committee? Committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a bill is important enough to be at the head of the list. Well, this is. Pardon me. This is. Where are we now? - Over in the House. Oh, yeah. House. More amendments, more changes, and the bill goes back to the Senate. The Senate doesn't like what the House did; they make more changes. The House doesn't like those changes. Stymied. So? So they appoint men from each House to go into a huddle... ...called a conference, and they battle it out. Finally, if your bill is still alive after all this vivisection... ...it comes to a vote. Yes, sir! The big day finally arrives... ...and Congress adjourns. Catching on, senator? Shall we start right away or order dinner first? Pardon me? I said, shall we start... Oh, sure. Why not? Do you mind if I take the time to go get a pencil? - Go right ahead! - Thank you very much. Go right ahead. And lots of paper too. Now, the... Doggone it! Ever have so much to say about something, you just couldn't say it? - Try sitting down. - I did. I got right back up. Let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it? How many boys will it accommodate? You've got to have all that in it, you know? And something else, Miss Saunders. The spirit of it. The idea. How do you say it? That's what's got to be in it. The Capitol dome. On paper? I want to make that come to life for every boy in this land. Yes, and all lighted up like that too. You see, boys forget what their country means... ...by just reading ""the land of the free"" in history books. They get to be men and forget even more. Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men should hold it up in front of them... ...every single day of their lives and say... ...I'm free... ...to think and to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can... ...and my children will. Boys ought to grow up remembering that. And that steering committee, they've got to see it like that. I know Senator Paine will do all he can to help me, because... He's a wonderful man, isn't he? - He knew my father real well. - He did? We need a lot more like him. His kind of character, his ideals. Let's get on with this. This camp will be in your state? About 200 of the most beautiful acres that ever were. You've never been out in that country, have you? I've been over every single foot of it. You have to see it yourself. I don't know. The prairies, and wind leaning on the tall grass... ...lazy streams down in the meadows... ...angry little midgets of water up in the mountains. Cattle moving down the slope, against the sun. Campfires... ...and snowdrifts.... Everybody ought to have some of that, sometime in his life. My dad had the right idea. He had it all worked out. He used to say to me, ""Son... ...don't miss the wonders that surround you. Because every tree, every rock, every anthill, every star... ...is filled with the wonders of nature."" He used to say to me... ...""Did you ever notice how grateful you are to see daylight... ...after coming through a long, dark tunnel?"" ""Well,"" he'd say, ""always try to see life around you... ...as if you just came out of a tunnel."" Where did you come from? I guess I've always lived in a tunnel. You mean here? Baltimore. Pure city dweller. Have you always had to work? Since I was about sixteen. Sixteen? I take it your parents couldn't... No, Father was a doctor. He thought more of ethics than he did of collections. Speaks well for Father, but it wasn't so... Now, look, we'd better get back to this. Hasn't been easy, has it? No complaints. For a woman, you've done awfully well. Have l? I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent.... I don't know where I'd be in this bill if it wasn't for your help. I don't know where you are with it. Gee whiz, we've got to get going with this. All right, now, let's see. Everybody calls you just plain ""Saunders."" Why can't l? Go right ahead. Saunders. That's much better. ""Hello, Saunders."" ""Good morning, Saunders."" - ""How's the bill coming, Saunders?"" - Terrible, thank you. Anyway, I got that ""Saunders"" business straightened out. All right, now! I... What's your first name? Why? Everybody calls you just ""Saunders."" I also answer to whistles. You've got a first name? Yes, but we just better forget about it. All right, all right. I was just curious. A picture popped into my mind of a pump without a handle or something. Of course, I know what it is. Violet. No, it isn't. Abigail? Letitia? Lena? You might as well tell me. I've got a lot more. All right. You win. It's Clarissa. Clarissa. All right, Saunders, let's go! Now, Susan's an awfully pretty name, isn't it? Susan? Susan Paine? Oh, it's beautiful. She's a beautiful woman, isn't she? Isn't she a beautiful girl? I think she's about the most beautiful... We've got to get started on this, or we'll never get it finished. Get set, because I'm going to talk much faster than you can write. You ready? The location of this camp. About 200 acres... ...situated in Ambrose County, Terry Canyon. Running a quarter mile on either side of Willet Creek. What? Willet Creek. W-I-L-L-E-T. It's a little stream. In Terry Canyon? You don't know it, do you? You've never been there, you said. You've discussed this with Senator Paine, haven't you? No, no. Why? Nothing. It doesn't matter. There's no reason to talk it over with him. ""A quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek."" And the land to be bought by the contribution of the boys... ...the money to be loaned to us by the United States. Excuse me. Pardon me. What did you get me out of bed for? Sit tight. The show's about to commence. Mind telling me what's going on? Certainly. There's the principal actor in our little play. ""Don Quixote"" Smith, Man With Bill. - Here, one of the supporting characters. Who? That gorilla in man's clothing, McGann. You mean Puss-in-Boots? Mostly Puss. Another prominent character in our play, the Silver Knight. Soul of honor on a tightrope. You wouldn't be a little goofy, would you? Don Quixote will stand up in a minute and speak two important words... ...""Willet Creek."" Then the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope... ...and ""Puss"" will jump out of his boots. It is so ordered. Introduction of new bills... ...and joint resolutions. Mr. President! The chair recognizes the rather strong-lunged junior senator... ...Mr. Smith. I'm sorry. I have a bill... You may speak a little louder. But not too loud. I have a bill to propose. Order, gentlemen. Our junior senator is about to make a speech. You may proceed. ""Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives... ...that there be appropriated as a loan... ...a sum sufficient to create a national boys' camp... ...to be paid back to the U.S. Treasury... ...by contributions from boys of America. This camp... ...to be situated on land at and adjacent to... ...the headwaters of a stream known as Willet Creek... ...in Terry Canyon... ...for the purpose of bringing together boys of all walks of life... ...from various parts of the country. Boys of all creeds, kinds and positions. To educate them in American ideals and to promote mutual understanding. To bring about a healthful life... ...to the youth of this great and beautiful land."" Our senator will make a good orator when his voice stops changing. I'm getting leery of him. We call him dumb, but he keeps getting in our hair. When he finds out a dam is going up where he wants his boys' camp... ...he's going to ask questions. Be quiet. I'm trying to think. This deficiency bill will be read tomorrow. Tomorrow? He'll hear that section on the Willet Dam. He can't be there. I'll take him to see monuments, even if I have to hit him on the head with one. That won't work. This boy's honest, not stupid. Susan. My daughter won't carry out such assignments. Senator! If you let me handle your publicity... Down, everybody! Who are those people? Phonies, office seekers, cranks. ""Get my son in or out of West Point..."" This machine creates a fever 10 miles away. It'll make you a fortune. Long-distance fevers. A woman wrote a song to replace ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Want to hear it? - Not today. I feel like a house afire. Even went to see Mr. Lincoln. - How did I do? - Great. My heart was right up to here all the time. What did Paine think? - Tickled pink. Oh, boy! I hope so. What's all this? - From boys who read about your camp. Already? All these letter... Those are only local. Wait till they start pouring in from all over. You mean... I'd better open one up. Let's see what they say here. Look, there's money. Let me see. ""Dear Senator Smith... ...I'd like to come to camp. I shine shoes at the station. Here's 9 cents."" Isnt that wonderful? And he signs it, ""Yours truly, Stinky Moore."" Isn't that marvelous? If there's money in each one of these, what will we do with it? A bank! That's perfect. You can see how important this bill will be. Is there any paper? Second drawer. That's fine. I'll be pretty busy tonight. Not another bill? Letters. I'm busting with news! I introduced a bill. Me, Jeff Smith! I spoke in the Senate! Want to dictate them? - The letters? I couldn't talk letters. I'll sit here and scratch them down. And say... ...I'm going to tell Ma all about you. And if I tell it right, you'll get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted. Thank you very much. Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you. Don't mention it. Without you, I couldn't have, I mean.... Who? Susan Paine. How do you do? Yes, I can talk. Go right ahead. I'm sorry to bother you, but you've got to help me. I'm elected to snatch Mr. Smith from the Senate tomorrow. You're what? I'm to turn my glamour on for him. You sympathize, don't you? Awkward, isn't it? Take him out and buy him a suit of clothes that fits... ...and a hat that he can hang on to. And a manicure and a haircut wouldn't do any harm. As one woman to another, I hate to ask you to do this, but.... As one woman to another, of course. Thanks, and... Just a minute. Miss Paine. Susan Paine? She wants to talk to me? What does she...? Holy mackerel. Hello, Miss Paine. How are you? Yes. Fine. What? What? Escort you? I'd be delighted. All right. Reception for a princess? She wants me to... Goodbye, Miss Paine. Goodbye. What do you know? A reception for a princess. - Can you imagine? - Get your hat. We have a lot of shopping to do before tomorrow. Where are your bitters? In the thing there. Behind the thing. I don't mind who gets licked in a fair fight. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Siccing that horrible dame on him when he's goofy about her. What dame? Paine. Better be nice to her. Her dad's the party choice for the White House. She may be the next First Lady of the land. Imagine reading ""My Day"" by Susan ""Paine-In-The-Neck."" He isn't going to be hurt enough. She has to twist a knife in him too. The regal jackass. ""I'll turn my glamour on him,"" she says. What's it to you? Nothing. I'm just saying... Then stop worrying. I told you, the dopes will inherit the earth. I wonder if this Don Quixote hasn't got the jump on all of us. If it isn't a curse to go through life wised up like you and me. If you're going to wonder, let's go down and do it over a steak. Come on, snap out of it. Drink up! Here's to bigger and better dopes. And to Don Quixote. Do you know how I felt? How did you feel? Quick. I felt just like a mother. Sending her kid off to school for the first time. Watching the little fellow toddling off in his best bib and tucker. Hoping he can stand up to the other kids. Say, who started this? I'm just waiting for a streetcar. Well, cut it out, see? Who cares, anyway? I apologize. All right, then. After all, what's it to me? So they drop him out of a balloon. All I care is, I don't want to be around. I'm squeamish, see? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. I won't be party to murder. I'm going to quit. I'm through. Again? It's a good idea. Let's get married. It's a good idea. When? Anytime. Tonight? You don't mind? I'd cherish you. You're a good egg, Diz. I know. Maybe we could clear out of this town. Get to feel like people. Live like we just got out of a tunnel. - Tunnel? - A tunnel. You've never seen prairie grass... ...with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz? Does the wind get tired out there? Or angry little mountain streams... ...or the sun moving against the cattle? You've never seen anything like that, have you, Diz? Have you? Do we have to? I can't think of anything more sappy. Then let's get going. Where? We're getting married. That's right. In case you don't know, I want to give you a chance to back out. What? My first name's Clarissa. I know. It's okay. Don't say ""okay."" Say you think it's beautiful. Okay. I mean... You don't know any name offhand that you like better, do you? Not offhand. Nothing like ""Susan"" or anything? Susan? I won't take it, see? I won't be party to murder, see? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that Taylor mob is low enough... ...but helping that dame cut him in little bits... ...nobody's going to make me do that! No, sir. You said it. I'm going to get out of there right now. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm clearing out. Everything I own. My extra hat, everything. Wait a minute. We're getting married! See you later. Saunders? What do you want? - You should have been there. - I know. It was a wonderful party, and your suit went over big... ...and she looked beautiful. And when you left she said... ...""Thank you, Mr. Smith."" But it was the way she said it. You nearly fell through the floor. Horseradish. What are you looking at? You didn't think I was a lady, did you? A lady wouldn't work for this outfit. Even I can't take it anymore. I quit. There's a lot I can't take. Can't take a simple... Why don't you go home? Tell your little streams about your camp and the land of the free. This is no place for you. You're halfway decent. Now go home! That's all I wanted to tell you. Meet the man I'm going to marry. That's me. Say something. Don't just stand there like a... Wait a minute. Why don't I do this right? So you want to be a senator? Build a camp on Willet Creek? See this? Deficiency bill. Section 40. A dam going up where you think your camp will be. Ever hear of it? They read about it in the Senate today, but you didn't hear. That's why that ritzy dame took you in tow. That's why they sent you here. You don't know a dam from a bathtub. Go ahead. Be a senator. Try and mess up Mr. Taylor's little graft. But if you can't... ...and you can't in 9 million years... Go home! Don't stay around here making people feel sorry for you. Come on, Diz. Hey! This way. Come on, kid. We'll dig up a preacher. We're going to get married. Come on, I'll take you home. There are 100 other places in the state that really need the water. Kenneth Allen owns some land there. He didn't mention a dam. There's something wrong here. I know there is. I won't vote on it till I get some questions answered. - Jeff, you're fighting windmills. - I am? Trying to understand everything about a project that took two years to set up. - The reasons, the benefits. - The benefits? Who is Taylor? What's he got to do with this? What makes you think he's got anything to do with it? I've heard that this is all his idea to get graft. Do you know what you're saying? You're accusing me of framing a bill for one individual's benefit. Of helping to put through a scheme for graft. Long distance? Get me James Taylor, Jackson City. Boy Ranger, eh? Answer to a prayer? Manna from heaven. Didn't even know how to tell time. Will you tell me exactly what he's done? He's about to blow the machine to smithereens, and you with it. Me, Jim? How? You wouldn't understand that. Listen to me, Mr. Ten-Thumbs, I'm on my way to Washington. No matter what happens, I'm all ready for that Boy Ranger of yours. Take your instructions from Ken Allen. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Use your high office to help Alan get things done. Do you understand? I doubt it. Come on, Alan. I haven't been able to show him a single monument. Not even one that high. No, he's been on our tail. You've got to keep this guy off of us. Ever since he found out we represent the Creek, he's been running us ragged. I told you I'd handle him. I object to you coming here like this. You proved how you can handle him. You're the one that started him writing bills. Chick, let him in. - You didn't ask Smith here? What do you think? Don't open that door. Jim, you can't do this. Let him in, Chick. All right, Jim. You can count me out. Good morning, senator. Come right in. What did you mean, count you out? You can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. He's a senator. However it happened, he's a senator. This is Washington. Steamroller stuff? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done well by you. That's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest. He thinks the world of me. We can't do it! What am I supposed to do? Stand around and let that drooling infant... ...wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck? Not me. Either he falls in line with us... ...or I'll break him so wide open they'll never find the pieces. Jim, I won't stand for it. You won't stand for it? I don't want any part of crucifying this boy. I see. Our steamroller methods are too hard for your sensitive soul. Is that it? The Silver Knight is getting too big for us. My methods have been all right for the past 20 years. Since I picked you out of a flyspecked hole-in-the-wall... ...and made you look like a senator. And now you can't stand it? Maybe you don't have to stand it. Maybe we can fix it so you and the boy can go home together. - You don't have to... - It's all right, it's all right. Seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years. Especially now, with a national convention coming up. Joe, I put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends. I guess we'll survive. We'll just find somebody else who's got a little more sense. In the meantime, you go in and explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill. It's your reputation. If he can't find enough facts to break you with... ...send him to me. I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home. So long. Come here, will you? It's just that I like the kid. I don't want to see you get too rough on him. I'm glad you came to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute. Go back to your office. I'll call you when I get through with Smith. ""The Silver Knight."" Hello, senator. I was just passing through. I thought I'd like to meet you. Sit down. You met all the boys here, I suppose. They say you've been on your toes since you got here. That's fine. You know, some people told me that you were dumb. I think you're smart. You're smart enough to understand a situation... - ...when it's explained to you. - Like what? Well, for instance... ...building a dam on Willet Creek. Just what's your interest in this? What's my interest? Anything that benefits the state is mighty important to me. Owning a lot of its industry, newspapers and other odds and ends. If I felt you had the welfare of the state at heart like I have... ...I'd say you were a man to watch. Now, what do you like? Business? If you do, you can pick any job... ...in the state and go to the top. Or politics. If you like being senator, there's no reason why you can't come back... ...and stay there as long as you want. If you're smart. Now, you take the boys here, or Joe Paine. They're doing all right. They don't have to worry about... ...being re-elected or anything else. They're smart. They take my advice. You tell these men and Senator Paine what to do? Why, yes. Joe Paine has been taking my advice for the past 20 years. You're a liar. I've got to see Senator Paine. Senator Paine is out of town. Out of town? He couldn't be. Hello, Jeff. Come in. Did you have a talk with Taylor? He said he's told you what to do for 20 years. I called him a liar. Come over here and sit down. I don't feel like sitting down. Oh, I know how you feel. I was hoping you'd be spared all this. I was hoping that you would... ...see the sights, absorb some history, and go back to your boys. You've been living in a boy's world. For heaven's sake, stay there. This is a man's world. It's brutal, and you've no place in it. You'll only get hurt. Take my advice. Forget Taylor and what he said. Forget you ever heard of Willet Creek Dam. But you still haven't answered me, sir. Can a man like Taylor tell you and those other men what to do? Listen, Jeff, please... ...and try to understand. I know it's tough to run head-on into facts. This is a man's world, and you got to check your ideals... ...outside the door, like you do your rubbers. Now, 30 years ago I had your ideals. I was you. I had to make the same decision you were asked to make today. And I made it. I compromised. So I could sit in that Senate and serve the people in 1000 honest ways. You got to face facts. I've served our state well, haven't l? We have the lowest unemployment and the highest federal grants. But I've had to compromise. I've had to play ball. You can't count on people voting. Half the time they don't vote, anyway. That's how states and empires have been built since time began, understand? You can take my word for it. That's how things are. I've told you all this because... ...I've grown very fond of you. About like a son, in fact. And I don't want to see you get hurt. When that deficiency bill comes up tomorrow, don't say a word. Great powers are behind it, who'll destroy you before you start. For your own sake... ...and for the sake of my friendship with your father... ...please... ...don't say a word. Owing to the urgency of the deficiency bill... ...there is a unanimous consent agreement... ...that no one will speak more than once or longer than five minutes... ...on any section of the bill. Clerk will read. ""The bill for deficiency appropriations for the fiscal year, Section One. On emergency relief: To create and erect public improvements on rivers... ...harbors and roadways, $150 billion. Section 40: An appropriation to divert and impound Willet Creek... ...to the natural basin of Terry Canyon, $5 million."" Mr. President? Senator Smith desires to be heard on Section 40? I do, sir. The senator understands he's limited to five minutes? Yes, sir. You may proceed, sir. Mr. President, this section of the bill, this dam on Willet Creek... ...is nothing but... Does Senator Smith wish to yield to his colleague? Why, yes, sir. You may proceed, senator. Mr. President... ...I have risen to a difficult task... ...to say from evidence that has come to my attention... ...I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body. You boys go out and get the senators. Something going on inside, come on. The senator will suspend until order is restored. All senators are wanted on the floor, please. What's going on? - I don't know. You may proceed. I refer to the bill... ...he has introduced for the creation of a national boys' camp. He named a portion of land to be dedicated to that purpose... ...and to be bought by contributions from boys all over America. Senators... ...I have evidence to prove my colleague owns the land described in his bill. He bought it the day after his appointment to the Senate... ...and is holding it... ...using his privileged office for his own personal profit! Boy Ranger had a wreck. This doesn't make sense. Accordingly... ...I offer a resolution... ...an inquiry by the Committee of Privileges and Elections... ...as to the fitness of my colleague... ...to continue to sit in this chamber. Order! Chairman, clear the galleries unless order is restored. Flash! Ranger senator branded by colleague. Flash! Paine brings charges to expel Smith. Where's Saunders? - She'll have the lowdown. I wish I knew. She left town in that jalopy of hers. Paine accuses Smith of introducing a boys' camp built for his own profit. Give me a cigarette. Paine's asked for a hearing before the Committee. Well, frankly, my dear senators... ...the morning that Mr. Allen burst into my office... ...bringing proof that Smith had the deed to that campsite... ...I was dumbfounded! Pardon me, what did you do when this was brought to your attention? I consulted with the head of the Department of Records... ...Mr. Arthur Kim. Mr. Kim, do you remember recording such a deed? On the date set forth here, Mr. Allen came before me... ...to record this deed... ...setting over 200 acres in the name of Jefferson Smith. How long have you known Senator Smith, Mr. Allen? Oh, a good many years. He used my land by Willet Creek every summer for his Boy Rangers. Seemed like a mighty nice fellow. One day he made a proposition. Said he had a chance to sell that land for at least $500 an acre. I'd be glad to get 25 for it. So we set it up like this: I deeded him the land, and he gave me a contract... ...guaranteeing me half, if he made the sale. Mind you now... ...the whole thing sounded fishy at the time. That contract you mentioned... ...have you got it? That land wouldn't be in his name if I didn't. Yes, sir. Signed and delivered. I never signed any such contract! He certainly did! Just a moment, please. After a long study of this signature, it is my professional opinion... ...that it is definitely in Jefferson Smith's own handwriting. As an expert on handwriting... ...I'd say the name of Jefferson Smith on this contract has been forged. I would stake my whole 20 years professional career... ...on the fact that this is not a forgery... ...but is Mr. Smith's own signature. This is a very painful duty for me. This boy's the son of my very best friend. I sponsored him in the Senate. I helped frame his bill. When he presented it, I went to congratulate him... ...but pointed out a dam was already going up... ...on the very site he'd chosen for his camp. There are other good campsites nearby... ...so I suggested he choose another. He became furious. He said, ""Move the dam."" I was amazed at his violent reaction. I couldn't understand. Until the evidence came to me that he owned those very 200 acres. And as you have heard... ...had carefully laid plans to make an enormous profit... ...out of the nickels and dimes scraped together by the boys of this country. Faced with that... ...regardless of my personal feelings for the boy... ...my sense of duty told me his expulsion from the Senate... ...was the only possible answer. Beautiful, that Taylor machine. Senator Smith, please. Will you take the chair, please? The Committee is ready to hear you now, Senator Smith. Keep your seats, gentlemen! Committee is not adjourned yet. Quiet! Please! That Ranger never knew what struck him when Jim Taylor opened up on him. Which one of you girls wants this? - Do you want it? - Oh, yes. You know, I had a hunch I'd find you here... ...when you weren't anyplace else. How've you been, Saunders? Oh, all right. Your husband. How's he? Old Diz. We're not married. Good thing I got back just when I did. You know what I found waiting for me? Jar of preserves from your mother. Oh, you did? What was it, strawberry? That's the best kind. I see by the papers you certainly got to be a senator. You sure had the right idea about me, Saunders. You told me to go back home and keep filling those kids full of hooey. Just a simple guy, you said, still wet behind the ears... ...lot of junk about American ideals. That's certainly a lot of junk, all right. - Now look, senator... - I don't know... ...this is a whole new world to me. What are you going to believe in... ...when a man like Senator Joseph Paine gets up and swears... ...that I've been robbing kids of nickels and dimes? A man I've admired and worshiped all my life. I don't know. A lot of fancy words in this town. Some of them are carved in stone, some of them.... Guess the Taylors and Paines put them up there so suckers like me can read them. Then when you find out what men actually do.... Well, I'm getting out of this town so fast... ...away from all the words and the monuments and the whole rotten show. I see. When you get home, what will you tell those kids? Well, I'll tell them the truth. Might as well find it out now as later. I don't think they'll believe you. They're liable to look up at you with hurt faces and say... ...""Jeff, what did you do? Quit? Didn't you do something about it?"" Well, what do you expect me to do? An honorary stooge like me against... ...the Taylors and Paines and machines and lies. Your friend Mr. Lincoln had his Taylors and Paines. So did every other man who tried to lift his thought up off the ground. Odds against them didn't stop them, they were fools that way. All the good that ever came into this world... ...came from fools with faith like that. You know that. You can't quit now. Not you. They aren't all Taylors and Paines in Washington. That kind just throw big shadows, that's all. You didn't just have faith in Paine, or any other living man. You had faith in something bigger. You had plain, decent, everyday common rightness... ...and this country could use some of that. So could the whole cockeyed world. A lot of it. Remember the first day you got here? Remember what you said about Mr. Lincoln? That he was waiting for someone to come along? You were right. He was waiting for a man who could see his job and sail into it. Who could tear into the Taylors and root them out into the open. I think he was waiting for you. He knows you can do it. So do l. What? Do what, Saunders? You make up your mind you won't quit, and I'll tell you what. Been thinking about it all the way back here. It's a 40-foot dive into a tub of water, but I think you can do it. Clarissa... ...where can we get a drink? Now you're talking. Come on over to my place. Mr. Dearborn. Mr. Dernell. Mr. Dwight. They're going to expel Smith today, eh? Where are the drums? Where's the guillotine? In fact, where's Smith? Hasn't stopped running since he left the Committee. - Mr. Singleton. - Here. Mr. Smith. Here! That guy's batty. The clerk will continue with the roll call. Here comes Saunders. Is this some of your shenanigan? What's the matter? Pray, Diz, if you know how. Did you have anything to do with bringing him in here? Are you crazy? Ninety senators have answered to their names. Quorum is present. Proceeding now to the regular order. Mr. President. Senator MacPherson. I desire to call up the report of the Committee... ...on the expulsion of Jefferson Smith. Clerk will read the report. ""The Committee on Privileges and Elections reports... ...it appears to the satisfaction of the Committee... ...after hearing a number of witnesses... ...that justice requires that Smith... ...no longer continue a member of this body. They report this resolution with recommendation that the same do pass. Resolved: That Jefferson Smith be expelled from his seat in the Senate."" I move for the immediate adoption of the resolution. - I addressed the chair first. - I have the floor. I'm asking for a roll call on the passage... ...of the resolution without further delay. The senator can have nothing to say that would not... However, Senator Smith is still a member of this body... ...and has an equal claim on the attention of this chair. You were about to recognize me. That was merely your impression. Let him speak! Before proceeding further... ...I remind the visitors in the gallery they are here as our guests... ...and should conduct themselves as such. And I might add that their sentiments in no way will affect... ...the judgement of this chair. The chair recognizes... ...Senator Smith. Thank you, sir. Diz, here we go. I guess the gentlemen are in a big hurry to get me out of here. The way the evidence is piled up against me, I can't blame them much. And I'm willing to go when they vote it that way... ...but before that happens, I've got a few things to say. I tried to say them once before and l got stopped colder than a mackerel. I'd like to get them said this time. I'm not going to leave until I do get them said. Will the senator yield? - Senator yields? - No, sir, I'm afraid not! No, sir. I yielded the floor once before, and I was practically never heard of again. No, sir. And we might as well all get together on this ""yielding"" business... ...right off the bat now. I had some pretty good coaching last night... ...and I find that if l yield only for a question... ...or point of order or personal privilege, that I can... ...hold this floor almost until doomsday. In other words, I've got a piece to speak... ...and blow hot or cold, I'm going to speak it. Will the senator yield? Will Senator Smith yield? - Yield how? Will he yield for a question? - All right. I wish to ask my junior colleague... ...this piece he intends to speak... ...does it concern Section 40 of that bill, the dam on Willet Creek? Every aspect of this matter, everything... ...was dealt with in committee hearings. - Mr. President? - I ask my distinguished colleague... ...has he one scrap of evidence to add now... ...to the defense he did not give and could not give at that same hearing? I have no defense against forged papers! The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for every member... ...when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character... ...has to say about any section of any legislation before this House! - Order, order, gentleman! - Mr. President... ...I stand guilty as framed because Section 40 is graft. And I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you... ...that a certain man in my state, Mr. James Taylor... ...wanted to put through this dam for his own profit. A man who controls a political machine... ...and controls everything else in my state. A man even powerful enough to control congressmen. I saw three of them in his room the day I went to see him. Will the senator yield? - I will not yield! This same man, James Taylor, came down here... ...and offered me a seat in this Senate for the next 20 years... ...if I voted for a dam that he knew and I knew was a fraud... ...but if I dared to open my mouth against that dam... ...he promised to break me in two. I got up here and I started to open my mouth... ...and the long and powerful arm of Mr. Taylor... ...reached into this sacred chamber and grabbed me by the scruff of the neck... Mr. President, a point of order. Mr. President? Senator Paine will state it. It was I who rose in this chamber to accuse him. He's saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence. He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a senator, and I demand... ...that he yield the floor. I did not say that Senator Paine was one of the congressmen in that room! I was in that room! Order, gentlemen. I accuse this man. By his tone, by his careful denials... ...he is trying to plant damaging impressions on my conduct. I'll tell you why we were in that room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our state... ...had brought with him the evidence against this man... ...and we were urging him to resign. Why? To avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable state. But he refused! Mr. President... There is only one answer to a man like him. The truth, which I rose and gave to this body. Mr. President... ...he is trying to blackmail this Senate as he tried to blackmail me. To prevent his expulsion, he'll even try to... ...hold up this Deficiency Bill, vital to the country... ...which must be passed immediately! Have I the floor? I have lost all patience with this brazen character. I apologize to this body for his appointment. I regret I ever knew him. I'm sick... ...of this contemptible young man. And I refuse to stay here and listen to him any longer. I hope every member of this body feels as I do. Get off the floor! Yield the floor! Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please address the chair! Mr. President, what does the gentleman want of this body? I'll tell you, sir! I want a chance to talk to people who'll believe me. The people of my state, they know me and they know Mr. Taylor. When they hear my story, they'll rise up... ...and kick Taylor's machine to kingdom come. I want one week to go back there and bring you proof. In the meantime, I want this Senate's promise... ...that I won't be expelled and this bill will not be passed. Will the senator yield? - For a question. Has the gentleman the effrontery to stand, convicted and in disgrace... ...and try to force postponement of the Deficiency Bill? - For one week. - Mr. President! I appeal to the senator. Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses... ...delayed and delayed? Millions will be without food and shelter. Public works will be at a standstill! Will we keep relief from the country? The people of my state need permanent relief... ...from crooked men riding their backs! Mr. President, if the Senate yields... ...to this sort to blackmail, it'll become a laughingstock. It is an insult to this body to have to listen. An insult to our colleague, Senator Paine. I, for one, will follow the senator's example... ...and refuse to remain in this chamber as long as that man holds the floor! Order, gentlemen! I guess I'll have to speak to the people of my state from right here! I'll tell you... ...wild horses won't drag me off this floor until those... ...people have heard everything I've got to say, if it takes all winter! Filibuster! Well, Mr. President, we seem to be alone. I'm not complaining for social reason, it's just.... I think it'd be a pity if these gentlemen missed any of this. And.... I call the chair's attention to... ...to Rule Five... ...of the Standing Rules of the Senate. Section... Section Three. ""If it shall be found that a quorum is not present... ...a majority of the senators present..."" And that looks like me. ""...may direct the sergeant at arms to request, and if necessary... ...compel the attendance of the absent senators."" Well, Mr. President, I so direct. The absence of a quorum being suggested. - Bring the call to quorum. - Call to quorum. There's no hurry, Mr. President. I got plenty of time. Quorum call! Call to quorum! All senators wanted on the floor! Clerk will call the roll. - Mr. Agnew. - Here. Mr. Albert. Mr. Alfred. - Mr. Ashman. - Here. Joe, get this! Smith got the floor and is holding it. Just as they were about to kick him out! He did it, Diz. It's wonderful! It was terrific! A filibuster! This is the miracle l wanted. What a yarn! Get everything he says back to that home state. It's a pleasure! They're going to hear this in Patagonia. In protest, the whole Senate body walked out! Not that straight stuff. Kick it up. Get on his side. Fight for him, understand? You love this monkey, don't you? What do you think? Now go to work. Do as I tell you. Take this: This is the most titanic battle of modern times. A David without even a slingshot rises to battle... ...against the mighty Goliath, the Taylor machine... ...allegedly crooked inside and out. For my money you can drop the ""allegedly."" We're bringing everybody up from headquarters. Where are they? Come on, get these telegraphs moving! - You get Hendricks? - They're looking for him. ""They're looking for him."" An editor. Why isn't he at his desk, where he belongs? Don't you think you better get back to that Senate? The boy's talking to that state. If he can raise public opinion against us... He'll never get started. I'll make public opinion within 5 hours. I've done it all my life. I'll blacken this punk so.... Leave public opinion to me. Now, go back into the Senate... ...and keep those senators lined up. I hit him from the floor with everything I knew. I haven't got the stomach for it anymore. If he convinces those senators, you might as well blow your brains out. This is the works, Joe! Either we're out of business or we're bigger than ever. We can't stop at anything until we smash this yokel... Hendricks on the phone. Go back to the Senate, will you? Hello, Hendricks. Well, the chips are down. Keep everything that Smith says, or any other pro-Smith stuff... ...out of all our newspapers. Understand? And all the others you can line up in the state. Those broken-down opposition papers, who won't play ball with us... ...I want you to tie up for 24 hours. Stall their deliveries. Push them off the street. I don't care! Bury them for 24 hours. That'll give me plenty of time. And you defend the machine. Hit this guy! The usual thing. Criminal, and blocking a relief bill... ...and starving the people. Joe, will you get back into that Senate? And Hendricks, get the hoi polloi excited. Have them send protest letters, wires, anything you like. Buy every minute you can of every radio station in the state... ...and keep them spouting against Smith. I don't care what it costs. Pay out. Get moving. Get the whole state moving! This filibuster is a cowardly attempt to turn your attention... ...from the true facts which are beyond question. Jefferson Smith was caught red-handed, stealing from boys. Relief will be stopped. Men thrown out of jobs. - I've seen filibustering, but... - Smith can't go on. It's ridiculous. We've got to get him off the floor. As long as Mr. Smith holds that floor legitimately... ...he's going to continue to hold it. If you ask me, that fellow's making sense. Sense? You call blackmail sense, Henry? Joe, I didn't like this boy from the beginning. But we feel that no man who wasn't sincere... ...could fight like this against these odds. I'm very glad to know that, Martin. After 20 years, I'm very glad to know you'd take his word against mine. Yes, that's what it means! If he's that much right, then I'm wrong. Joe, can't we work out some deal... ...to pull that Willet Dam out and let the Deficiency Bill go through? It isn't a question of Willet Dam. It's a question of my honor and reputation. The integrity of the Committee, the integrity of the Senate itself. If you want to throw out Section 40, go ahead. - I'll resign. - Now, wait a minute, Joe. This is a lot of nonsense. Joe's right. A deal is impossible. We've got to go on with this. Break him, keep him talking. No relief. Maintain a quorum in relays. - ls that how you feel, John? - For once, I agree with you. It's time to relieve the floor. How a man that green knows as much as he does.... Can't go on much longer. ""...that they're entitled by their creator... ...with certain inalienable rights... ...and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of..."" Well, looks like the night shift's coming on. Senator will please suspend until order is restored. This is H.V. Coltenborn speaking. Half of official Washington is here to see democracy's finest show... ...the filibuster: The right to talk your head off. The American privilege of free speech in its most dramatic form. The least man in that chamber... ...once he gets and holds that floor, by the rules... ...can hold it and talk as long as he can stand on his feet. Providing always that he does not sit down... ...and that he does not leave the chamber or stop talking. The galleries are packed. In the diplomatic gallery are the envoys of two dictator powers. They have come here to see what they can't see at home... ...democracy in action. ""...life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness... ...and to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men... ...deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed... ...that whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends... ...it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it."" How am I doing? - Quit stalling and move! - Clark, Jim. - Oh, Clark... - Mr. Taylor? Yes, wait a minute Phone Senator Paine about it. This is Jim Taylor in Washington. About this Smith filibuster. Newspapers in the Southwest must realize... ...that this bill he's trying to block... ...will affect your section as well as any. It's the patriotic duty of every newspaper... Wait a minute. Yes? - Jackson City calling. - Hold them! We've got to keep hammering at this man until we smash him! I get a great kick out of that part of the Declaration of Independence. You're not going to have a country that can make these rules work... ...if you haven't got men that have learned to tell human rights... ...from a punch in the nose. That's good for a headline. It's a funny thing about men, you know. They all start life being boys... ...I wouldn't be surprised if these senators were boys once. That's why it seemed like a good idea... ...to get the boys out of crowded cities... ...and stuffy basements for a couple of months out of the year... ...and build their bodies and minds for a man-sized job... ...because they're going to be behind these desks someday. It seemed like a good idea, getting boys from all over the country... ...boys of all nationalities and ways of living. Getting them together... ...let them find out what makes different people tick. Because I wouldn't give you 2 cents for all your rules... ...if behind them they didn't have a little ordinary everyday kindness... ...and a little looking out for the other fellow too. That's pretty important, all that. It's just the blood and bone and sinew of this democracy... ...that some great men handed down to the human race, that's all! But if you've got to build a dam where that boys' camp ought to be... ...to pay off some political army, that's a different thing. Oh, no! If you think I'm going back and tell those boys in my state... ...""Fellows, forget about it. All I've been telling you about the land you live in is a lot of hooey. This isn't your country. It belongs to a lot of James Taylors."" No, not me. Anybody here that thinks I'd do that, they got another thing coming! I just wanted to find out if you still had faces. Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen. I know I'm being disrespectful to this honorable body. A guy like me should never be allowed to get in here in the first place. And I hate to stand here and try your patience like this, but l... Either I'm dead right or I'm crazy! You wouldn't care to put that to a vote, would you, senator? Will the senator yield for a question? - I yield. In view of the gentlemen's touching concern for the senators... ...and the fact that he's been talking for 7 1/2 hours... ...and must be very, very tired... ...would he permit a motion to recess until the morning... ...at which time he may better continue with his profound babblings. No. No, don't! Ask him! Mr. President, what happens in the morning... ...I mean, about my... ...having this floor to go on with my ""babblings""? If the senator permits this motion for a recess... ...he won't have the floor in the morning... ...to babble with or anything else... ...unless he is recognized first by this chair. As I was saying, gentlemen... ...I'm either dead right or I'm crazy... ...and I feel fine. What have you got, Dick? - From Miss Saunders. Is the senator yielding the floor? Yield? Oh, no! I feel fine! The Constitution of the United States. Page one, top left-hand corner. ""We the people of the United States... ...in order to form a more perfect union...."" Yeah? Well, buy it or wreck it! Brady's column too? Holy smokes! What's the matter? This is murder, you got to call him off. - He's getting nowhere. What are you talking about? Not one word of what he says is being printed in that state. Oh, no! Taylor has practically every paper in the state lined up... ...and he's feeding them doctored-up junk! - One man muzzling a whole state? - And how! Freedom of the press! Wait a minute! I've got an idea! Jeff has a paper there, Boy Stuff, right? Terrific! They aren't letting what Jeff says get printed in the state. If I give you a raft over the phone now... Write me a front-page raft, Diz. Can you print it out... ...and spread a billion copies of it? Swell! Get ready to take it down, will you, Mrs. Smith? All right. Boys, everything about Jeff. Get pencils and paper, quick! All right, here we go! All ready, Clarissa. She called me Clarissa! Okay, Ma! ""Jeff Tells Truth. Shows Up Taylor."" I want the whole morning edition. Push him off the floor! Start your campaign for protests. Wired! ""Willet Dam is a fraud to line the pockets of the Taylor machine."" Here's your front-page editorial. Wait! ""A convicted thief representing you... ...holds the floor of the United States Senate."" All right, boys. Hurry up! She said rush! Get cracking now! Come on! Bring on the paper! ""...charity wanteth not itself... ...is not propped up... ...and now abideth faith... ...hope, charity... ...these three. The greatest of these is charity."" Read about Jeff. Boy's Stuff circulars. Peddled by 9 million kids. What are you standing there for? Get the boys out! Kill it! Get these papers out of here. Read all about it! Jeff Smith lies in Senate! Wire Congress! Are we going to let a man like Jeff throw mud at a man like Joe Paine? Are you for Joe Paine? Hurray for Jeff Smith! Children hurt all over the city. Tell Jeff to stop! Yes, all right. Goodbye. ""Senator Smith has now talked for 23 hours and 16 minutes. It's the most unusual and spectacular thing in the Senate annuls. One lone and simple American... ...holding the greatest floor in the land. What he lacked in experience, he's made up in fight. But those tired Boy Ranger legs are buckling. Bleary-eyed, voice gone. He can't go on much longer. And all official Washington... ...is here to be in on the kill."" There's no compromise with truth. That's all I got up on this floor to say. When was it? A year ago, it seems like. Terrible things are happening. I've got to stop him. They're listening to him. Anything might happen now. Just get up off the ground. That's all I ask. Get up there with that lady that's on top of this Capitol dome. That lady that stands for liberty. Look at this country through her eyes if you want to see something. But you won't just see scenery. You'll see the whole parade of what man's carved out for himself... ...after centuries of fighting. Fighting for something better than just jungle law. Fighting so he can stand on his own two feet, free and decent... ...like he was created. No matter what his race, color or creed. That's what you'd see. There's no place out there for graft... ...or greed or lies... ...or compromise with human liberties. If that's what the grownups have done with this world... ...we better get those boys' camps started fast... ...and see what the kids can do. It's not too late. Because this country is bigger than the Taylors... ...or you or me or anything else! Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here! You just have to see them again. Mr. President. Will the senator yield for a question? Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague? Yes, I yield for a question. The senator has said he is speaking to the people of his state. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it... ...for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentlemen be interested in what those people have to say? Here it comes. Yes, sir, you bet I would. Mr. President. Have I permission to bring in... ...evidence of the response of my state? Is there objection? You may proceed, senator. Pageboys! I can't stand it. I can't stand to see him hurt like this. Public opinion made to order. Taylor-made. There it is. There's the gentleman's answer. Telegrams. 50,000 of them... ...demanding that he yield this floor. I invite the Senate to read them. I invite my colleague to read them. The people's answer to Mr. Jefferson Smith. Stop, Jeff! Stop! I guess this is just another lost cause, Mr. Paine. All you people don't know about lost causes. Mr. Paine does. He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for. He fought for them once. For the only reason that any man ever fights for them. Because of just one plain, simple rule: Love thy neighbor. In this world today... ...full of hatred... ...a man who knows that one rule has a great trust. You know that rule, Mr. Paine. And I loved you for it, just as my father did. And you know you fight for lost causes harder than for any others. Yes, you even die for them. Like a man we both knew, Mr. Paine. You think I'm licked. You all think I'm licked! Well, I'm not licked! I'm going to stay right here and fight for this lost cause! Even if this room gets filled with lies like these... ...and the Taylors and all their armies come marching into this place. Somebody will listen to me. He's okay. He just fainted. - Let me go! What's the matter, Joe? I'm not fit to be a senator! I'm not fit to live! Expel me! Expel me, not him! Willy Taylor's a fraud! It's a crime against the people who sent me here... ...and I committed it! Every word that boy said is the truth! Every word about Taylor and me and graft... ...and the rotten political corruption in my state! Every word of it is true! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust! Expel me, not that boy! We did it! We did it! Order gentlemen! Please! He did it! Let go of me! Yippee! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, There'll be none of that. No trays. The Star-Telegram has you quoted quite definitely:... ...""Before departing by plane for New York, Mr. Cheyne stated... ...that the new equipment is to be provided by the present bond issue"". The other papers have virtually the same. What does the confidential bulletin say? ""Tuesday morning. Paris wires... ...the President will probably sign the Bannerman Mining Bill today"". Van Wyck's London cable says:... ...""Conservatives will support the new air program"". Tokyo: ""Mr. Gordon's condition excellent. Appendix had not burst. ""Our property loss in our tuna-factory fire will amount to not more than $15,000"". 8:45, Mr. Cheyne. - Our guests still asleep? - Yes, sir. Reynolds will drive them out to Connecticut at 11:00, sir. - Well, let them sleep an hour more. - Very good, sir. - Will you be dining at home tonight? - I don't know. - You can call me at the office. - Very good, sir. Burns, give this to my son. Have him call me at the office on a private wire. Very well, sir. Shall I waken them now, Mr. Burns? No, Mr. Cheyne wants the dear things to sleep an hour longer. They can never wake up, as far as I'm concerned. Yes, Master Harvey? Well, Burns said that... Oh, here he is now. Yes? Your breakfast will be ready in the dining room, Master Harvey. Yes, but... But... Oh, very well. It wants its breakfast in its rooms. Prepare the tray. Why can't I go downstairs and eat my breakfast if I'm hungry? Is that the way you act in people's houses? In people's houses, they let you eat when you're hungry. Well, you're my guest, and you'll do as I say. Besides, I bet you never had breakfast in bed. My mother has it, but it's sissy for a fellow to have it, unless he's sick. Who are you calling a sissy? I'll take care of it. Did you say I was a sissy? I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy. Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey? You heard me order it. Go ahead, Charles. It'll be in your room. You want to have some breakfast, don't you? Yes. I like to eat the way people eat. Will mine be in my room? Sure. Think we only got one servant? Wait a minute, Pogey. Why do you want to go around making him mad for? What if he is? You just can't remember one single thing. Getting my father to get his father... ...to make him spend the Easter with us was a plot, wasn't it? - Yes. - Come in. Well, then, what do you want to go around spoiling plots for? I just wanted to make him feel he owed you something. - Could you get coffee if you wanted it? - Sure. I just don't like it. - Do you want some? - No, I like cocoa. Your father instructed me to give you this. - What for? - He didn't confide in me. You're to telephone him, if you get up. - Is there anything more you wish? - Yes. You can fill my bath for me. With pleasure. We thought you were in bed. No, and I'm going to eat mine on that desk. - Are you sorry Easter's over? - I don't know. Haven't you been having a lot of fun? I guess so. You're the one that's from Providence, aren't you? Uh-huh. Why, I'd think a boy from Providence'd be very happy to make a trip to New York. I'm from way out in Indiana. All right. I've got a little brother that I bet'd be happy to have all the luxuries you've had. He can have my room. Hello. Hello, Father? Just a moment. I'll see if your father's in. Morning, Son. What? I'm going back to school now. Yes, sir. $40. That's it. I thought you might have to stop for lunch somewhere... ...before you get back to school. You can treat the boys. Have a good time, Son. See you in June. Goodbye. Goodbye, Father. He's a wonderful boy. He was 5 here. I wish his mother had lived to see him now. 10 years old and yet he's one of the editors of his school paper. Think of that. Now, watch. Sit up, Conrad. Do you hear me? Sit up! Sit up! Move. This isn't the way my Treasure Island looks. It's the very first way anybody ever saw Treasure Island. Gee, it's very valuable, huh? Sure. Would you like to have it? - It belongs to your father. - It does not. My father gave it to me so as I could have it when I grow up. - You take it as a present, Charles. - You're going now. Gee whiz! I'm glad you like the book, Charles. Look, Harvey, maybe I oughtn't to take it. That's all right. That's just an act of friendship. Sometime, maybe, you'll want to do an act of friendship for us. What? Oh, maybe we might like to join the Buffaloes. You're the president of the Buffaloes, aren't you? Yeah, but there's 15 other fellows in the club. Yeah, but when you get together in Mr. Tyler's room... ...and toast marshmallows and things... ...you talk about who you're going to let in, don't you? I'm not allowed to tell what we do. That's all you do. You sit around Mr. Tyler's fireplace... ...and talk about camping and things like that. Well, do you want to do an act of friendship? What if the others don't want you in? Now look here, Charles... ...you like being the president, don't you? Certainly I do. It's an office of honor. And what if you weren't the president anymore? - You can't do anything about it. - Oh, yes, I can. What if you weren't at the school anymore? I'm going to be at the school. Harvey could buy the school and shut it up. Couldn't you, Harvey? No. That isn't what would happen. Your father sells my father's automobiles in Providence, doesn't he? Yes. Well, then, do you think he'd like it if you had a chance... ...to do me an act of friendship and didn't do it? What if he woke up one day, and my father took away... ...all the automobiles he let him have to sell and said:... ...""You're fired"". You know how many people are out of jobs? Millions of people. And they're all hungry and in rags. They can't send their sons to school. You're not old enough to work... ...so you'd have to go out with your mother and father and beg. And that certainly would be awful... ...to have your mother sitting there, all dressed up in rags... ...and eating rotten bread and things like that. Wouldn't that be terrible? Your father can't do that. Now look, Charles, I don't want him to do it. I just say I don't want him to have to do it. I know they won't let you in. Monsieur Gattard will continue with... ...second and third form French on Thursdays... ...which will replace Dr. Spitzer's science section... ...moved up to Friday afternoon. That will give Dr. Spitzer more time for golf. - Thank you. - That covers everything, gentlemen. We'll reconvene at tomorrow night's regular faculty meeting. - Oh, Mr. Tyler. - Yes, sir? Harrison's doctor feels he needs another month's rest. Could you possibly take over first form Latin? Oh, I think so. I thought you might like what added salary the extra work would bring. Well, that's very kind of you, Dr. Finley. Did you get straightened away from last winter's difficulties all right? Yes, and now that you've brought that up... - I don't know quite how to thank you... - Oh, don't mention it, Bob. This ought to make things easier from now on. - Yes, sir. And thank you very much, sir. - Glad to do it, Bob. Hello, Charles. What's the matter? Can Harvey Cheyne make his father do anything he wants? I don't think so. Why? He says if we don't let him and Pogey Williams and Alvin Savage... ...join the Buffaloes... - I'll have to leave school. - What? I don't know what to do with this. He gave it to me. It's awful valuable, and he won't take it back. He gave you this? He says if he doesn't get in the Buffaloes... ...he'll get his father to take away my father's automobile business. Well, that's absurd, Charles. Well, he wanted to be on the school paper... ...and he got his father to give a new printing press, didn't he? So they had to let him on, didn't they? - He's always... - Come in here, Charles. Come in here. Come on. We've got to set type up now. - There isn't room for any more. - What did he write? - It's about his vacation. - I want more than this in. There isn't room for any more. If you wanted more, you ought to write it sooner. Give it here. Hey, give that here! I want to write some more. We told Mr. Tyler he could read proof at 5:00. I don't care. You treat me like I wasn't one of the editors here. Oh, you used ""like"" as a conjunction. - I did not. - Oh, yes, you did. That makes 10 cents more you owe to the dunce box. Yeah, and you still haven't paid up for saying ""either, or""... ...instead of ""neither, nor"" down at the dining hall this noon. I did not... Come on. You're awful slow with that proof. - It's not ready yet, Mr. Tyler. - Yes, so I assume. You have half an hour. Come here, Harvey. I want to talk with you. It's their fault it's late. They wouldn't let me... Harvey, I put that first edition of Treasure Island in your room. Oh, you did? Thanks. It was a nice gift, but Charles didn't think he ought to take... ...such an expensive present, and I'm inclined to agree with him. Oh, that's all right. I want him to have it. Why, Harvey? Well, it's... We don't need it. We've got lots of them. Harvey, you know that's a silly answer, old man. - Well, it was an act of friendship. - You mean a bribe, don't you? - What's a bribe? - A bribe's a dishonest gift. A person who accepts it knows that he must do something dishonest in return. Be honest, Harvey. All I wanted was to belong to the Buffaloes. Look, people give presents after someone's been nice to them, don't they? So what's dishonest with giving presents before someone's nice to you? Harvey, why do you think you don't belong to the Buffaloes? 'Cause Charles don't want me in. It isn't Charles that kept you out. I kept you out. What? You said you were a friend of mine. I am, but sometimes we have to do things for friends... ...that we don't particularly like to do. Harvey... ...do you remember me saying it hadn't been wise for you to tell the boys... ...that you ought to be a member simply because your father was so important? Yes. And I said the way to get in was for you to be important... ...to stand on your own feet... ...not depend on your father for everything you want. My father gives me everything I want. Did you talk this over with your father, Harvey? No. He's got more important things to do. He's anxious for your happiness, isn't he? Sure. - I'm perfectly happy. - Oh, no, Harvey, you're not... ...because you know you've been dishonest. - Well, so were you dishonest. - Now, Harvey. Well, you took a bribe. What are you talking about? Didn't you find some money in your room... ...a couple of days before Christmas vacation... - ...lying on your table in an envelope? - What? Yes. Only it wasn't a bribe. It was a present... ...because I thought you were a friend of mine. - Did you put that $50 there? - Yes. I was going to tell you it was from me. I thought maybe you'd make the history exam easier. You went to the dentist and came back late, and I didn't get a chance to tell you. - I had no idea it was from you. - You kept it, though. It'll be returned, Harvey. I'm afraid you need a little sterner lesson than I can give you. What are you going to do? I'm going to talk it over with Dr. Finley and see what he thinks ought to be done. You hate me. - Where's Coventry? - It isn't a place. It means he can't talk to anybody, and you can't talk to him. You just have to pretend he doesn't exist. And if he tries to talk to you, you have to report it to a master. What did he do? I don't know. He's a fresh kid. That's all. ""Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere Take thou there from my brand, Excalibur And fling him far into the middle mere Watch what thou seest and lightly bring me word To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere"" - Well, what did Sir Bedivere say? - That's all I was supposed to commit, sir. Ten lines. Does anybody know what Sir Bedivere replied? We'll have to find out tomorrow. I know what he said, sir. Persons in Coventry do not speak after a class is dismissed. Kind of funny about Eddie stopping where he did. Yes. Yes, it was. I guess I got a right to look at it, haven't I? The only reason you got your old paper was 'cause I got it for you. You make me sick. Punching somebody isn't speaking to him, is it? No. All you got to do is say he tried to break Coventry with you. Takes some people an awful long time to learn something. - It'll only cost $10 if you want to go back. - I'm never going back. - Why, Son. What's happened? - I just got here. I'm all right, I guess. - What's the matter with your leg? - Oh, it's all right, I just sprained it a little. Here, here. Sit down. - Yes, Mr. Cheyne? - Ask Dr. Walsh to come in. Oh, I don't need a doctor, Father. - What's all this? Tar? - It's ink from the printing press. A little of it got on me. I left school. Dick, I wish you'd see if this boy of mine is all right. - Well, well, son. Been in a fight? - I fell down trying to escape. Take a look at that right leg. - What do you mean trying to escape? - It doesn't hurt now. - Can you walk on it? - Yes, sir. It was just a lingament or something. I think you'll pull through. - What happened to him? - I'm trying to find out. Why do you say you escaped, Harvey? Because they had me prisoner at the school. Nobody could talk to me. - I guess they were scared I would talk. - Who was scared? That old Tyler and all of them. - Who's old Tyler? - He's a master. He kept me out of the Buffaloes and took a bribe. - What bribe? - I gave him $50 at Christmas... ...to make the history exam easier. And yesterday I found out he wasn't a friend of mine. - He fixed it so as I couldn't tell anyone. - Let me get this straight, Son. Do you mean to say that a teacher let you give him $50? - Yes. - And then locked you up... ...because you threatened to tell about it? Yes, in the basement. I had to fight my way out. - Good heavens, what school is this? - Green Hill, Connecticut. - Does Dr. Finley know about this? - Sure he does. He's trying to keep it quiet, too. He's scared because you gave so much to the school. It's very important that Dr. Finley be at my house this evening. - I also want to see that teacher, Tyler. - Yes, sir. Maybe you oughtn't have anything at all to do with them, Father. You just let me handle this, Son. I bet they make up some awful lies about it. I must point out the extraordinary sums of money that he's had at his disposal. Very large sums for a small boy. Well, the boy was confused... ...bewildered, almost terrified when he came into my office. Your mere assertion that I give him overlarge sums of spending money... ...in no way seems to justify the severe treatment... ...to which he's obviously been subjected. Mr. Cheyne, Harvey's ""severe treatment"" came from no member of the faculty. I've told you of his attempt to bribe Mr. Tyler. Here's the $50, by the way. Behind that lies a long list of infractions... ...based on his attitude that he's a special, privileged character. His attempt to resist the normal, healthy discipline of being put into Coventry... ...brought no further discipline from us. But it did bring him a solid bash on the nose from one of his fellows. It was a blow, I am sorry to say, that any one of the other 120 boys... ...in the school would have been glad to deliver. Oh. Well, in that case... - ...have some coffee, Dr. Finley. - Thanks. Now, tell me. This bash on the nose came from a Bison? - A Buffalo. Wellman is a Buffalo, isn't he? - Yes, sir. Perhaps you will accept some coffee, too, Mr. Tyler. Thank you, sir. Really, Mr. Cheyne, Harvey is great material. He's simply been misdirected, that's all. Smart. Why he has a mind as fine as any in the school. Well, he certainly fooled me. It seems that I have begotten a sort of junior Machiavelli. Perhaps it's not my place to say this, Mr. Cheyne... ...but it's simply because you and he have never had any relationship. To him, you're just a machine pouring out money, a machine he's trying to imitate. If you take time out from being a tycoon in big business and spend more time... ...getting to know your own son, you'll realize... I'm sure Mr. Cheyne realizes that very clearly now. I can see that the school would do with a little more cooperation with me, yes. But you gentlemen must realize... ...that besides being both father and mother to Harvey... ...I'm tied up in my own work... ...in matters that also relate to his future welfare. I suppose what you want from me, Dr. Finley... ...is permission to deal as drastically with Harvey... ...as his future conduct might deserve. I'm afraid we'll have to leave that in your hands for a while, Mr. Cheyne. For the rest of the spring term at least, Harvey will have to be rusticated. Rusticated? ""Temporarily canned,"" I believe the boys call it. Well, that is news. And here I'm trying to put you on the carpet. It seems a bit thick... ...after the printing press and all your other generosities... ...but for that very reason, for the effect on the other boys. Oh, I understand perfectly, Doctor. You've no other course. Well, Bob, if we're going to catch that train, we must be off. Goodbye, Mr. Cheyne. I'm sure that when Harvey comes back in the fall... ...he will be a boy that we can all be proud of. Well, good luck. My young Mr. Tyler is pretty intense, but he's quite right. You're rather a nice fellow for a... What did he call you? - A tycoon. - Oh, yes. Well, you're rather a nice fellow for a tycoon. So take the boy in with you for the next few months, will you? You won't mind the extra work. If you give him a chance to live up to you... we're liable to have another splendid citizen on our hands. - Good night. - Good night, Doctor. Thank you. Harvey. Don't, Mr. Tyler, please don't. Don't. Two hours ago, you might have gotten away with that very nicely, Harvey. From now on, it doesn't go. That's all we'll have to say tonight, Son. - Elliot, I am going to be a father again. - Good heavens, Mr. Cheyne. No, no, no, Elliot. No, it's just that it seems that smart little boys... ...from so-called wealthy, well-bred parents... ...don't grow up very successfully by themselves. - Lf you're speaking of Harvey, sir... - Yes, I am. - Did you get passage for next week? - Yes, the Queen Anne on the 7th. You wanted to go over the London corporation papers... - ...before you retire. - Yeah. Well, get a larger suite. Harvey's going with us. It seems that he's been... - ...rusticated. - Oh, I am sorry, sir. Will you be taking a tutor along with him? So how the deuce did you know what that meant? Frankly, I jumped at an obvious conclusion. Well, you're smarter than I was, Elliot. No, no tutors. I've got to get closer to that boy. I'm darned if I know just where to begin. Poor kid, maybe it's all my fault. I don't know. Oh, well. I'll make it somehow. If the radio tells them where every ship is, why do they have to... - Radiogram, Mr. Cheyne. - Oh, thanks. What, Harvey? I said, if the radio tells them where all the ships are... ...why do they have to keep on blowing that old foghorn all the time for? We're off the Grand Banks now. A lot of small fishing boats out there. Too small for a radio. They don't want to hit any of them. I bet this boat could go right through one of them. Why do they have to come so far out from land to fish for? This is where they get all the codfish and halibut off these banks. Those boys wouldn't believe you own this boat. I don't, Harvey. I am just one of the directors of the line. Well, you're the chairman, so that's the boss, isn't it? Look, Son, why don't you have some fun with these kids for a while? I've got a radio to send and then... ...well, later on I'll pick you up, and we'll go up on the Captain's bridge, huh? Hear that? My father's taking me up to see the Captain... ...when he gives him some orders, later on. - Oh, bushwah. - I'll play you both. Can't you see we're already playing? All right, then, I think I'll get an ice-cream soda. You can't. The soda fountain doesn't open till noon. Oh, no? We'll see about that. Hey, Purser. Hey, you, come here. Well, are you the three important customers? Yes. Have you any money? - I've got a dime. - That's not enough. We'll have three chocolate ice-cream sodas. Make them big ones. You know we're not supposed to open till noon, don't you? You've got nothing else to do. Oh, of course, you'd know all about that. I know everything about this ship. I've been all over it. - Meet with your approval? - It's all right. Crew would be glad to know that. All right, drink them up, boys, and don't take all day, huh? There's no hurry. We're going to have another. - This will be enough for me. - Me, too. What's the matter with you? I could have five or six of these. - Yes, you could. - You bet I can. Make another. But I'll be glad to make them for you, even though I know you can't. Yeah, I'll show you. There. You didn't think I could do it, did you? That's fine, you certainly surprised me. I think I'll go meet my father now. That's a boy, and go and eat a great big lunch now. Look, he's getting sick. He's gonna be sick. - Uh-oh. I hadn't counted on that. - I am not. I feel fine. I can go and meet my father if I want to, can't I? Come on, I'll bet you anything. Which way is it to the deck? How do I get outdoors? First to your right. There he goes, come on. He came out here. Hey, Harvey! You try run Manuel down, huh? You big killer whale with smoke spout. You try swallow Manuel like he little smelt, huh? That's all you ever got to say. On the Isle of Fishamingo Lived a chief called Bingo-Bingo What's this? That whale she have calf, huh? Little bull calf, too. All full of ocean inside. Here. Here, come on now. I pull you out of ocean, now you give some of that ocean back. Come on now. Give back. Come on, give back. Fifteen years I've been fisherman. First time I ever catch a fish like you. Hey! Aboard the vessel! Hey. I bring you new kind of fish. What'd you get? I've got new kind of fish. He got no tail. He got pants on his dorsal fin. - I think maybe he about 10 year old. - Oh, it's a kid, ain't it? Go on, tend your bell. - But, Dad... - You know better than leave your watch... ...especially in the fog. Go on, tend your bell. Lend a hand here, Olley! I pump him out a little bit. I guess maybe he need more pumping yet, I think, huh? Get a buoy-keg. Roll him. He must have fell off that liner. Sure. He no like that big foolish... He come visit Manuel. He got more salt water in him, ain't he? Where... - Where is this? - Oh, you's awake? How's you feeling, boy? I... I fell, didn't I? - Did you pull me out of the water? - No, Manuel, he fished you aboard. Who are you? I's Doc. I's the cook. How does your throat feel? - Awful. - Always do. Take some of this and you'll feel better. Oh, that's worse. - What smells so bad? - Smells? Ain't nothing smells bad around here. Oh, you means the fish. But they ain't got no smell. Them's nice, clean salt fish. 70 quintals already done salted down in that forehold. Is this the bottom of the ship? Well, where's my father? Was your pappy overboard with you, too? - Oh, this is some other boat. - That's it. We done picked you up. Oh, where are my shoes? I've got to see the Captain. Back here. Here you is. You reckon you're pert enough to hop on deck? You find the Captain and tell him to come down here. I reckon you're lucky he didn't hear you say that. - Where are my clothes? - Here they is and they ain't dry. - Boy, you... - Where is the Captain? Up on deck. You sure is a tonic to yourself. How do you do, son? So you slipped from your mooring. Going to stay with us awhile. You look like a spring herring now... ...but you're going to fatten up before the fall. I don't know what you're talking about. Where's the Captain? Aft. - How do I get to the Captain? - You got to him. - Well, how are you feeling, sonny? - You mean you're the Captain of this boat? That's the general opinion. How long would it take you to get to Europe? Well, I don't know, sonny. I never tried to sail there. But I want you to take me there. I've got to meet my father. Well, that's a pity, because I'm afraid it can't be done. All right, then, take me to New York. I don't think you understand, sonny. We're working off the Grand Banks. This schooner is from Gloucester, Massachusetts. We'll take you there when we're through fishing. I don't want to go to Gloucester. You don't? Well, now. - Is he the Captain? - We let him think he is. - Maybe he'd like to be captain, Dad. - Oh, I don't know, Dan-o. I know you want to get home, son, but we're out here to catch fish. We ain't going to leave here till we catch enough to fill the fore and after hold. Say, look, my father is Frank Burton Cheyne. Don't you believe me? I don't doubt you know your own daddy's name. But we'll pay you if you take me to him. Don't you want to make some money? That's what we're hoping to do catching fish. But he's rich. He can buy more fish than you ever saw. Why, he owns the boat I fell off. - You mean the liner? - Yes, he practically owns it. It might have been the fall that done it. Dories in, sir. Now you take it easy, son. - Now you've got to listen to me... - Dan-o. Uncle Salters'll take the bell. You take him down below and let him bend on some of your clothes. No matter what course we take, son, you can't tack around like that. Then you go and rest a little more. - Now, what's your name? - Harvey Ellsworth Cheyne. Well, mine's Dan. Come on down below. So, how'd you fall off that boat in a calm? There was a storm coming down. This morning? There wasn't no storm this morning. It was a flat calm. Well, I ought to know. There ain't been no more than a little swell all day. Wait'll we get a rough day out here. What do you call a rough day? When she's putting most of her cabin house under water. Here, put these on. Wait till you see some of the places we go. What places? Stone Fence, St. Pierre's Bank, Whale Deep, Virgin Rock. Pop gets a ride along with the fish. Folks say he thinks like a codfish. Well, if thinking like a codfish is gonna get me where I want to get... I don't care how he thinks. Pop don't make no hasty judgments. Hey, these are the worst clothes I ever saw. This stuff itches. Wait'll you wear them for a little while. They'll shrink to your tonnage. - Round to port. - Come on, get this stuff on. Dories in. That's got nothing to do with me. For those 850-pounders They're more than out-floundered - Did you bring them in better? - Lean to port, man. - Hey, Dave, hoist away. - Starboard bin, and pull up. Got plenty of coffee boiling, Doc? - Yes, sir, Capt. Disko. - Look at Long Jack. He's got such few fish they die of loneliness, I think. You did better, maybe? Wait till you see what I get. I get fish with hair on him. There my new kind of fish! How you feel, little fish? Hey, are you gonna cut up all these old fish and stuff before we get going? I want to get to my father. Well, it'll be some little time, yet, son. Easy on that salt, Henry. - When? - It's just like you said, Tom. They're running kind of smallish. - About three months, son. - Three months? When we head into Gloucester with a full load of fish... ...we'll help you find your folks. - But I want to get going right away. - Excuse me, son. Was them sharks ravenous today. Right stole all my gear. - Hey, can't you understand me... - Now, look here, sonny. I've been close-hauling your problem, and I want to help you... ...but we've got our problems, too. All of us here share in the fishing... ...and heading back to Gloucester now... ...we'd maybe lose all next winter's daily bread for us and our folks. You wouldn't want that now, would you? Are you crazy? I told you my father had more money... Hoist away, Jack! Are you going to listen to me, or don't you understand... Stand away, boy. Hey, if you think I'm going to stay on this boat for three months... Now, look here, son... I don't blame you none. Now you won't me either after the bile's out of your system. And even if your daddy was half what you say... ...it wouldn't be right nor just to gamble two weeks good fishing... ...against a yarn give out by an upset boy. But I am a fair-minded man... ...and while you're aboard, I'll pay you wages. $3 a month. - Now come on, sonny. You start helping Dan with them cod livers. Here's a pair of gloves. We wash them out first, then we put them in there... ...and after we get the bucket full, then we put them in the barrel. That's how we get cod-liver oil. - You think I'd do that? - Here, they won't hurt you, little fish. Yeah, you heard pop's orders. You're one of the crew now. I am not and I'm not going to work on this boat and nobody can make me, either. Hey, Disko, you hear this? Come on now, don't be scared, little fish. You keep away from me. All of you keep away from me. None of you can make me do anything. Hey, Disko. You got mutiny on board. If you don't want to help, just keep quiet. When I get off this boat, I'm going to get my father to put you all in jail. You're all kidnappers. Well, I guess there ain't nothing else to do. I'll bet they put you all in jail. In jail for the rest of your lives, and I'm going to do it, too. You hit me. Now you just sit there and think about it, sonny. Look at Manuel. He's saving fish to sleep on. Catch up, there! Hey, I do more work as you do with your best girl's six brothers. Who in the tarnation laid that bucket there? Dag-diggit! Now, mind what I told you, son. You're too young to be telling a crew of men... ...what you'll do and what you won't do. But you might as well start in learning a few things. You see that gurry? Well, when you've hove them fish heads overside... ...you can come below and get some supper. Until you do, you get nothing. I'm not going to eat, either. You do as you mind to about that. Let it rain some more coffee, huh, Doc? Fog's lifting. It'll be clear in an hour. How is my little fish? Smiling and happy? No, he's still sulking. He's the orneriest kid I ever seen. Maybe his papa's got so much money he don't want that little boy no more. - Maybe he throw him overboard. - He sure spins a yarn for a kid. - Aye, his papa own that boat. - Yeah, interesting talker, all right. Why, he's a good enough liar to write books. A rope's end, that's what I'd give him. I'm telling you, it's the fall he took that did it. It plumb distracted him. My cousin Eben back from Vermont was like that. He fell off of a barn, and he played with rag dolls for 30 years. If you want what I think, as soon as this fog lifts we'll take him into Saint John's. - I mean it. - And lose two weeks good fishing, huh? Better than taking a chance on three months bad luck. Now we have plenty sunshine for Mr. Happy Face. He's a passenger on a fishing schooner, and you know that's bad luck. What happened to the Orinoco last year... ...when they took on the passenger at Newfoundland? On the way home, two men get killed and they don't get hardly a quintal of fish. - By golly, that true. - My brother was on the Bedford... There was a passenger on the Dorothy Clemens... ...when she got rammed by the liner. Well, that's nothing. There's lots of vessels lost out of Gloucester... ...never had no passenger on board. I was a passenger on my father's boat... ...and I never brought him no bad luck. - Daniel, here... - Your own son ain't being a passenger. Skipper, when we trawled this bank last year... ...there was nothing but dories loaded to the gunwales. This kid comes aboard this morning and look at today's catch. Now, look here. Wait a minute. - There ain't no passenger on board. - Why not? Well, I made him a member of the crew. Well, it stands to reason if I'm paying him wages, he ain't no passenger, don't it? No, sir. You can't just buy Jonahs off that way. I hold, he's still a passenger as long as he ain't done no work. Yeah, and Jack's right. Well, he'll work as soon as he gets hungry. What's going to happen between now and the time he does? Now look here. I decided this. Manuel's responsible for him being on board. So you got to put him to work. - Me? - You got to, Manuel. Yes, sir. Manuel, that's only fair and just. - I stick his face in that gurry. - You got to do it. Please do, Manuel. We don't want no Jonahs happenings aboard. - You gonna do it now? - I go stand my watch. - I mean it, Manuel. - All right. I think I pay doubles for my mistake, huh? Me, what likes kids like tub of rat poison. And that kid, two tubs. He just say one word to me, I throw him right back to the fish. Ah, the supper she is great tonight, Olley. Doc has fish cakes like the stars. I sure could stow away about a dory-load. I never taste such fish cake. And this raisin bread... Just like cake. Say, look, you could get me some food, couldn't you? - But I'm sick and I'm hungry. - Go away from me. - Do you want to make some money? - Go away from me, I break your neck. Why do you want to be a kidnapper? Look, do me a favor, huh? Shut your face. - You're just as bad as the rest of them. - You crazy. Nobody bad round here. You just bad luck. Listen. Listen, you. You clean up gurry little bit, I give you a nickel, huh? See, look, I'm trying to give you $10,000, maybe. You get out one of those boats and take me back to New York. You and me in that dory, huh? Yes. How far are we from New York? You want row a Nova Iorque, now, huh? Well, I know how. I've been taught in school. Now, look. You clean up little bit, huh? Anything. Just so little work. You want nice boat look nice, huh? It's a dirty rotten little boat I wouldn't even spit at. Say, you... Say, this is finest schooner out from Gloucester. Jonah, for the last time. You gonna work or no? I'm not gonna have anything more to do with you. That is good here. Hey, Jonah. Hey, kid. Where you hiding? Hey! What you doing? - I'm going to New York. - You what? - I'm going to get away from here. - Why, you... - You keep away from me. - Hey, you. - Put down that oar. - I won't. Put down... Hey, put... You bad luck, all right! You... I can do this long as you can. Oh, you crybaby, too, huh? I am not. No? Good. Now look... - ...you still want row a Nova Iorque? - Yes. - You still hungry? - Yes. Then come here. Now. Now you can go below and eat. That man said I could eat. - Manuel? - It's okay, he do some work. - I did not. - You clean something off deck, no? - You made me do something. - That was work. That's fine. Sit right here. - Yes, sir. - How did you get him to do it? He do anything for me. Even break my leg, maybe, too. Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Once Doc baked some biscuit And throw them away Next day no more fish Come around boat to play Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Said cabbage to fish cake Who lay on one dish I beautiful cabbage You only poor fish Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry - Who's that? - Me. The food was awful. But it was better than nothing, I guess. If you hadn't choked me, I wouldn't have had to kick you. You kick me? I feel nothing. All cleared up, hasn't it? The weather, it's nice now. - It was till you come up. - Well, they sent me up. No. No, I bet they ask you stay. They said you wanted to show me how to go on watch. Nice fellows. - All right. Go ahead, watch. - How? Just keep quiet. Go someplace. Go look for iceberg or boat or something. Is that all there is to watching? That seems like a lot of hooey. Hooey? What kind smart talk that ""hooey""? You better tell sailor's angel that smart talk. He like to hear that, I think. - Who's he? - I guess you don't know nothing, huh? Sailor's angel, he fly around up there all time. You watch here, look out for 25 men below. He watch up there, he look out for you. You go sleep, maybe. He tap you on shoulder with his wing and he say:... ...""Hey, Manuel, wake up. What's the matter? I ashamed for you"". He very nice fellow. Everybody know that. Oh. Well, nothing on the port side. That fine. Anything on starboard? No. Nothing on the starboard, either. And nothing in the head. That port, that starboard. I bet I know a lot of things you don't know. I know that's not French you're singing. That's right. About 10 million people know it's Portuguese. - I bet you can't speak French. - Right now I sorry I speak English. What's this? That's a boat, that's easy to see. Yes, maybe your father come back see if you good and drowned, huh? Yeah, that boat's no bigger than this one. - What do you keep singing for? - Because I like to sing. - I've never heard that song before. - Me, neither. I just make him up. You can't write songs. I don't write them. I just find them in my mouth. A song can't be any good like that when you just make it up. Say, that's best kind songs. When you feel good inside, like trade wind, she just come out. O my beautiful lady People learn songs. Songs aren't just inside of people like that. Say, sometimes a song so big and sweet inside, I just can't get him out. And then I look up at stars and maybe cry. It feels so good. Don't you never feel like this? - No, I guess you don't. - Nobody else ever did, either. Say, my father, when he alive, he made better songs than me. And what kind of songs did he sing? Songs about the sun and the sea. Songs about the clouds. Big songs about the wind and the storms. And little songs, too, about the tip of my mother's nose. Oh, my father, he feel beautiful inside. - Is that all he did, was sing? - Is that... My father was the best fisherman in the whole Madeira Islands... - ...and that's every place. - Well, that's not so much. How you mean, not so much? Well, I mean, he didn't do much for you. I mean, he didn't leave you anything. He didn't leave... He leave me this hurdy-gurdy that his grandfather leave him. He teach me how to fish, how to sail a boat. He gave me arms and hands and feet, feeling good outside... ...and he teach me how to feel good inside. My father do all this. He have 17 other kids, beside. What else a father do, huh? - Oh, I don't know. - Say, listen, my... Capt. Disko! Capt. Disko! That Jennie Cushman, she is even now under our stern! She come make you happy, I think! The Jennie Cushman? I might've known it. Yes, sir. That's her nosy, long topmast prying into our wake. Hey, there! On the Cushman! Where's that poor excuse for a skipper you got aboard? And who is it might be wanting him? You know consarned well who wants him, you bilge-raised haddock! Well, if it ain't Disko Troop. And me thinking I was gonna fish here all alone. Who passed you the word I was here so you could follow me, Disko? Now look here, Walt Cushman. I'm sick near to retching... ...at you using my brains to catch a trip of fish. Sailing under my wake every time I find a good spot. Why, Capt. Troop. Now, is that the way for one gentleman to talk to his colleague in commerce? You're trailing me 'cause I can find cod... ...where you can't find half a pound of sick squid. I'll do the fishing, Disko... ...you just get out that checkerboard and try to figure out how really smart you are. So what, he beat you at checkers last winter, huh? Yeah, and he cheats at that, too. He'll beat us into Gloucester this trip, too, I think. Oh, you think so, do you? Well, now, listen to me, I'm gonna tell you something. I ain't so dumb. Fussing around like that will make him think the fishing is good here. Then, in the morning, when the fog banks roll in... ...we'll sneak out and leave him sitting here baiting big and catching small... ...while we're out finding fish. We'll have a full hold and be tied up in Gloucester... ...by the 1st of August, and he'll still be out here... ...floundering around, trying to catch fish... ...or I'll look more like a halibut than he does. They sure are mad at each other, aren't they? No, no, no. They're not mad. They just make it up. They do that all time. About everybody's crazy here. You make up your songs, they make up they're mad. You got bunk, you better go below. - No, I'd rather stay here. - You go below. - No, I'm gonna stay here and watch. - I watch here. You go there, watch. Go sleep. Do something. I no understand you. There's a place in my heart For the one I love best And I still keep her picture Tattooed on my chest Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Well, I stole a march on Walt Cushman all right, I reckon, that time. Yes, we did that, certain sure. We did, you darned old farmer. Go on, hold her to her course, northeast by east. She heels over so much. Well, leave her heel. You ain't steering no mowing machine, now. Heave that lead, Manuel. He think he got hold stern end of cow, maybe, huh? Hey, kid. Hey, wake up. Come on, wake up, little fish. Hey, wake up, wake up. Somebody think you dead, they have celebrations. So that's your tub of rat poison. You tucked him in his little bunk last night, huh? What do you mean? This foolish kid, he bother me. I don't know. He fall asleep, pulled tarpaulin over him, I guess. And me, I look all over for this. You did, huh? I suppose he pulled your coat around him, too. I look for my coat, too. - So you stole my coat, too, huh? - Why, no, I... Sure, he stole it right off your back. So big tough fisherman is gonna throw him back to the fishes, huh? Some day, I think I... Ten fathom. Thanks. Thanks for covering me up with your coat and everything. That's all right. Would you by any chance be showing any blue pebbles from the bottom? I never did thank you for saving my life. I ought to thank you for that, all right. You feel better this morning, huh? I guess so. Well, when you got it figured out, you come and let somebody know, huh? Blue pebble, she is. By golly, I think that Disko know this ocean better... ...as I know inside my shirt. - Are you fishing now? - Sure. I fish for bottom, so she don't fish for us. Go away with your foolish questions, which don't have no brain. All right, then, if that's the way you feel about it. Fifteen fathom and clear away! By golly, I beat you this time. He who has a daughter Oh, what a terrible man Oh, what a terrible man Speaking in his native lingo He said, ""Marry Bingo-Bingo"" Oh, what a terrible man Oh, what a terrible man He will bring you beans and sorrows Yes, I know about his morals Oh, what a terrible man Oh, what a terrible man Bingo-Bingo came to woo her Brought a lot of presents to her Oh, what a terrible man Oh, what a terrible man Dag-gummit, of all the consarned... What's the matter, farmer? Think you're sticking hogs? This dad-bitted boat keeps bouncing around under me, of all... - What you laughing at? - Him. - Well, don't laugh. - Why? Everybody else did. It's all right, they got right to laugh. They know how chop bait. - You know how? - Doesn't look like anything. Go ahead, chop. Tail first. Try it again, harder. You fish for sperm whale, maybe. Don't laugh. Beside, you laugh no good. Like seagull. I guess I want to do something. Yes, but you wanna do just what you want to do. I tell you what you do. You go below in galley and help Doc. You carry slops. You sweat in galley like Dan did before you talk about being fisherman. - Go on now, go on. - All right. You think Manuel soft with that kid, huh? You think 'cause I catch him I let him still be Jonah, huh? Not on your livings. Kid, he drive me crazy. Think I break his neck. Kid. - Spit. - What? - Spit first. - Why? You'll find out. Oh. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - You go out fishing? - Sure, sometimes me and Uncle Salters. Who goes with Manuel? Nobody. You don't see him baiting a trawl, do you? - You mean, he doesn't fish? - Sure he does. He fishes hand line. He ain't used a trawl or had a dorymate since his pop died. Oh. - Did you start fishing with your father? - Sure, that's natural, ain't it? Get your dories ready! Come on, boys, step lively. Get your dory to the rail. Lower your dory to the rail. Keep well to the westward, Tom. We'll head straight down the road as soon as we got all the dories spilled. Come on, get her in the water. Don't crack that one on me. Ease a little. - Thank you, Uncle Salters. - Manuel, he all set. Here's a hook. Isn't it too rough to go out in that little boat? - What do you mean? - I mean, to go out alone. I not go alone. Five minutes, I have 100 fish keep me company. I mean, wouldn't it be better if you had someone to row, maybe? Who I get to row? Doc? Disko? You very foolish this morning. Well, I rowed a boat at school. I could row... Oh, I see. You row this boat, huh? What you know about boats when you cannot even chop bait? I know lots about boats, see? I know that's the jib, and that's the jumbo... ...and that's the fore rig, and that's the fore topmast... ...and that's the foremast, and that's the triadic stay. That's the main topmast, and that's the main mast... ...and that's the main rigging, and that's the gurry kit. That's the Duncan Street, and anything else you want to know? Where you learn all this? I read a book on it in Capt. Disko's cabin, and I don't care who knows it. And you can go row your old boat all by yourself. I wouldn't go out in it for anything. By golly, that's smart kid. About time to break his neck, ain't it? I got no time break necks. I got fishing to do. Lower away. Hard alee. Stand by the headsail! Twenty-eight fathom. She's shoaling fast, Capt. Disko. We're getting to her. Twenty-six fathoms, bottom rock. We're on the bank. Let go your anchor. Tie up your jib and jumbo! Stand by your foresails. Bait them snug, boys, bait them for home and mother. - This fog is going to lift for you. - Well, that's something. Oh, what do you care, Jack? Pop could find fish in a graveyard. There's a run of cod on this bank... ...that Walt Cushman won't know nothing about. Ahoy there, on the mud scow. Whose anchor chain is that a-rattling like it's full of rust and roaches? Well, if it ain't Disko Troop. Did you spring your fore stick trying to follow me, Disko? I suppose you'll deny I showed you the road to this spot... ...a year ago this very day, you cross-eyed mackerel. You want to row over for a game of checkers? Fishing is mighty sparse here. We'll never sink under the weight of fish we been catching. Well, I ain't doing so good myself. I can lay it to your presence, maybe. He's lying, the same as me. He's a plank deeper in the water than he was the last time we seen him. I think that Walt Cushman, he smart fisherman. Maybe we better sail after him all time, huh? Well, boys. You gotta start in filling fish from now on. That meddling buoy-tender's near as full up as we are. We'd be way up around Virgin Rocks by now if it weren't for picking up Jonahs. He's been working mighty hard, Mr. Jack. I don't think there's much Jonah left in him. Honest. Or we might fill faster if our Jonah-catcher... ...would throw away his hand line and bend on a trawl for once. You don't think I catch as much fish as you, huh, Jack? I ain't saying that. Maybe you just bump your head on bunk when you get up this morning, huh? Or maybe you Portuguese just don't know nothing about trawl-fishing. I tell you what I do. I take Jonah kid with me tomorrow. I fish hand line, I show him same time. I bet you we bring in more fish as you and Nate toguessers. ""Toguessers"". Speak English, will you? More fish as me and Nate together. More fish than you and Nate together. Reckon we take that, Nate? You mean I'm going to be your dorymate? I mean nothing of kind. You just sit in boat and be Jonah. I do fishing. - I'm going out with Manuel in the morning. - That's fine. Did you say you'd like to bet a little something on that, Manuel? Oh, you think you scare me on bet, huh? I tell you what I do with you. I bet you my brand-new safety razor I buy last Christmas. 98 cents, mail-order house, I... You put up 50 cents piece. Brand-new, this year's. That's a wager. You sure you didn't bump your head, Manuel? I no bet on sure thing. I bet on myself. Just as good. I guess I didn't mean what I said about going in your boat. Make no difference what you mean. You in it now. I'm awful glad I am, Manuel. I don't think I'll be a Jonah, honest. What your name? Harvey? Well, I gotta call you something. I'll call you Harvey. Oh, that's better. You no laugh like seagull now. Come on now, I feel tired. You gotta help row. Really? Gee! Put in the pins. Put the oars in the pins. We gotta go someplace. Now, when I say three, you row. All right. I'm ready. One, two, three. That fine school you go to, you row on your back, huh? I was too anxious, I guess. Never mind anxious, you leave me be anxious. Now, come on. One, two, three. Row! Row! We get someplace. Bottom of the ocean, I think, maybe. Now we fish. Well, go on. Bait your hook. How you think you gonna fish sitting there looking at me? You bait just like you row boat. Here. Look, you must put barb all way through. Like this. Otherwise that fish he spit that out six, seven times when he feel something. You know this fish, he don't go to school... ...he don't know French, but he pretty smart, too. Now drop him down to bottom. Then pull up about six inches, maybe... ...so he look fish straight in eye and say, ""Look here. I got corn beef and cabbage"". Hey, I've got one. You got new idea, maybe, too, huh? What you think, we just feed fish free here for nothing? I guess I was too anxious again. I told you, stay away from that anxious business. Let the fish be anxious. Here, look. One, two... ...now it's in his mouth. Now up he comes. Gosh. Can I take him off the hook? We got no time for that. We don't know this fish personal. - Hey, I've got one now. - All right, pull him up. Don't let him stay down there and tell all other fish what going on. Pull him up! Hey, wait a minute. Hey... ...you gonna bring fish up see you, you going down to see him? - Pull him up! - I will. Oh, the boat tipped and I... Oh, he got off. How you expect catch fish, falling on your backside all time? Bait your hook. Don't look like they was jumping in your dory. I wait till I get soft place for them to land in first. I'll catch the next one. You'll beat Long Jack and Nate. Don't you worry. He won't get your razor. You think so, huh? Nothing going on here now. That fish, he have meeting down below. He tell all other fish there's something not so funny going on. Has your father been dead a long time? Six year, next month. Seem a long, long time. How did he die? He drown off Cape Sable in storm. Wave come at night and wash him overboard. - Didn't they find him? - No. - Oh, I'm sorry. - What you sorry about? Well, I mean your father. They didn't find him. What they need find him for? He all right. Well, but, drowning out in the ocean, all alone at night... Well, what's trouble about that? That fine way. The Savior, he take my father up to fisherman's heaven... ...up with all his old friends. Quick he take him up. Quick. Just like I pull up this 35-pound fish. The Savior, He see my father all tired and wet down there in the water. So he light the harbor buoy and he say:... ...""Come on up, old Manuel... I so happy you come up here to help us fish"". And my father, he say, ""Thank you. I very happy to come up, too. And maybe I show you something about fishing up here, huh?"" And then they all laugh. And the Savior, He put his arm around my father... ...and He give him brand-new dory to fish in. You think they really fish in heaven? Why, sure they fish in heaven. What else they do? The Apostles, they all fishermen, I think. You remember that Simon, called Peter? Remember that time when... ...he don't catch no fish in the sea of Galilee? And the Savior, He stand on the shore and He say:... ...""Simon, you throw your net on the right side"". And Simon, he throw his net on the right side... ...and he catch so many fish, his net, it almost break in two. I think the Savior, He the best fisherman. But my father, he come next. And not fishing like this. Oh, no, no. Fish bite all time. When no more fish, the Savior, He make more fish. He make more fish. He make more bread. He make more wine. And at night He stand watch all by Himself. He say:... ...""Good night, fishermen. You tired now. Go to your bunks. And no snorings, please. Good night, Manuel's father"". Oh, that very nice place. Oh. Sometimes I think I go there right now. Then I say, ""Now, whoa, Manuel. You gotta be better fisherman first. That Savior, He only give dories to first-class fishermen, like your father"". So I keep on fishing. I no hurry. I know my father keep place for me in his dory. Hey, sleepy-face, look. - You log on a bump. - Oh, say. I didn't... Easy now, easy. He's a big one. And stay off your backside, you hear me? Come on, pull him up. I'm trying to... You want Manuel help, huh? I think you get blisters. Blisters good for fishermen. Come on. Pull him up, pull him up. - Hey, what's this? - Yeah. - Pull him up. Pull him up. - What is he? He's a halibut. Big, like mainsail, huh? The boat tipped again. Gosh, I told you I'd get one, didn't I? By golly. My little fish catch fish bigger than he is. I feel my whiskers disappear now. I told you we'd beat Long Jack and Nate, didn't I? Sure, we beat everybody. Manuel and his little fish, they beat everybody. We make fisherman out of you, huh, little fish? What chicken-livered squid done this? Easy, Jack, them hooks! Hey, Long Jack. What's the matter? We were putting out our second tub, and Jack was snagged overside. He might as well have fastened to an octopus. - Get him a knife. - Cut him off. Nate, I think you need new dorymate, maybe. One what's good fisherman. Maybe next time you get one what ain't old lady... ...what gets all mixed up with knitting needles, huh? - That Long Jack, he is mad. - I knew he would be. That will stop him fishing for a while, I guess. What you mean you knew? When I heard you betting last night with Long Jack... ...I sneaked up on deck and tangled up his trawl. What you do? Sure. I put some knots in it and took a lot of bait off the hooks. What are you going to do? You still alive and strong, huh? That good. You go back. You tell other fish:... ...""Manuel ain't got no fisherman in his boat. He got no dorymate. He just got cheat"". And I no catch big, strong, honest fish like you that way. Tell them good and loud. Oh, but, Manuel, I just wanted us... I just wanted you to win. That's all. Well, what have we got here? What's the matter? I don't remember hoisting no signal to come aboard. We lose something. Something we never have, I think. This kid, he no like our way fishing. He want come back. Manuel, won't you listen? You give him hand, maybe. He got no way cheat himself overside. Come on, son. Kid, come here. Don't like fishing, son? What happens... What do you do when people don't speak to you around here? Now, you have to settle that yourself, son. I'm skipper to a crew, but I ain't dry-nursing them. I don't take no part in squabbles. They settle that between themselves, just like everything else. Whatever's foul between you and Manuel... ...you will have to free and clear yourself. Hey, Doc. Yes, sir, that sure do beat all. - What was he saying about me? - He don't say nothing about you. Just got a new funny story, that's all. You should have come aboard this morning, Jack. These things are worked in pretty deep now. And lose a day's fishing? No, sir. That's what somebody expected me to do. No yellow-livered job is going to keep me from doing my share... ...or winning a bet, either. I can pull this one through, Jack... ...but I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut the others. Fine. Here's the bet, Jack. I pay prompt, huh? I'll take it 'cause I won it fair and square. That's a sight more than you tried to be. You crazy, Jack. You don't think I fouled your trawl? That trawl fouled itself, maybe? I been handling trawl for 20 years, Portegoosie... ...and I never seen line snarl itself that way, except by human hands. Well, maybe you too anxious to win bet, Jack, huh? Maybe you no keep your mind on things. Listen, Portegoosie. Either you or that kid done it. It stands to reason. If I found he put his Jonah flippers into my trawl... ...I'll wind him twice around the capstan and break him off short. I think you put hooks in yourself so you got chance to drink more rum, huh? You call me a cheat? Jack, you talk too loud, you drink too much rum, huh? I'll discover right now who done it. Or, by thunder, I'll cut hooks out of you where there ain't none. Jack, you hurt your arm. Don't, Long Jack, don't. It wasn't Manuel. I did it. I did it last night while you were having supper. But I didn't mean you should get the hooks in your arm this way. Honest, I didn't. I just thought we'd have a little fun and win... - Why, you sneaking little... - Jack, what you do? You keep out of this, Portegoosie. Oh, Long Jack, what do you worry about? He admit the whole thing like regular grown fella. He say he sorry. Everything all right now. Nothing's all right till I beat his ears off. Get out of my... - You touch that kid, I tear you apart, see? - Yeah? Me, Manuel talking. I tear you apart, see? So don't get me mad, Long Jack. I get all crazy and sick inside. All right, start cutting, Disko. Maybe he cut picture of your girl out there. Huh, Jack? I am telling you, Manuel, keep that kid away from me. He's a... He's a Jonah, and you'll find this is only the beginning. What's the matter, little fish, you sleepy? - I'm so ashamed, Manuel. - Sure. We all got be ashamed once. So we don't do things again what we got be ashamed of, see? Yes, but you not speaking to me... ...and those hooks in Jack's arm... Jack, he very tough man. All fishermen have hooks in them. Oh, sure. Two, three, four hooks. My father, he have hook in his arm right here. And three year later, he think he have pimple on back of his neck. You know what was it? Hook coming out. And my father, he say, ""So that's what's been in Denmark all this time, huh?"" That fine. There's a school of fish Way down deep in the sea Where the little fish Studied geography My father, he teach me this song. And I put your kind of words to it. There they write on a slate And they read from a book Learn to run with the bait Then just leave them the hook I got to sing every time I get mad. It drive those flying fish out of my stomach, do you know? Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry You'll be a baleia By-and-by Baleia, that mean big fish... ...like whale, you know? With fins and a tail To help you sail And maybe some wings To help you fly Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Yeah, ho, little fish Don't cry, don't cry Here's Disko. Cod must be coming. Hello, friend! - Hiya, James! - Come on over. There the Blue Gill. She's from Gloucester, same as us. And there's the Elizabeth K. Brown. She sail good when the skipper he is sober. There the Flying Swan. She drag her anchor all time. Everybody comes here and fishes last... ...because it's the biggest and best bank, huh? Sure. Only some come too soon, some come too late. Disko, he come right with codfish, see? - Say... - Look, look, look! There Virgin Rock I tell you about. Now watch, watch, she gonna roar. Say, that's the bottom of the ocean. Sure. She get lonesome sometimes. She come up for a little look around. Yes, sirs, by thunder, there she is. I think that Jennie Cushman she filled with fish already. She beat us home, huh, Disko? He got here too early. The real run ain't started yet. By this time tomorrow, we'll be fishing 72-hour stretches, hand line. The cod will be covering this bank like herring. Walt Cushman beats me into Gloucester, I'll hang myself with an eel. Hey, at the wheel, there. Downwind! All right, up, up, up. Hurry. Pick it up. That thing's squirming. Bring him in, Danny boy, bring him in. In case some of them ain't expecting this. We're full up and ready for home. Hey, little fish, that's for us. Disko say we all full up and we go home. Come on. Hey, pitch up that last fish, Manuel. Then you and Harvey's going to take me a-visiting. - Hey, Daniel? - Yes, sir. As soon enough hands come aboard, tell them to turn to... - ...and heave up that anchor short. - Yes, sir. Hey, aboard the vessel. Would anyone on the Flying Swan be wanting to send any mail to Gloucester? We got sickness aboard. We're heading for home. Go on, Disko Troop. You and your sickness. You're just crowing, that's all. No, we all catch too many fish, too soon. We all sick about it. Well, some of the lads expected you, Disko. You could mail those, if you will. It's a pleasure to be postman to you, Benjamin. Why don't you sign up with me next season... ...and get home before the snow flies? I know what you're going to say, Disko. I don't want none of your sarcasm. We heard your bell and saw your flag. I hope you founder with all hands. It's nice to have your good wishes, John. Hey, Disko. If our new baby is born before I get back... ...talk Molly out of naming him Hubert will you? - She wants to call him Hubert. - Another baby, Martin? Well, you ought to stay at sea all the time. That's what he do if he stay on this boat. Hey, there! Aboard the Bluegill. Any mail for Gloucester? Kind of late starting the crew, ain't you, Disko? Well, I just thought I'd like to carry your mail, Peter. We just come back from rowing our mail over to the Jennie Cushman. - That's a poor attempt at a joke, Peter. - Yeah? Does that look like a joke? Why the sneaking sand shark. Never ring a bell nor nothing. Never give us no sign he was going to swing off today. Get back to the vessel. Give me them oars. - But I can... - Well, go on then. Put your back into it. Hey, aboard the vessel. - Get that anchor in! - Hey, what's eating Disko? - Is he liquored? - Aye on that. It's the Cushman. Pull up your foresail. Hey, Disko. Here comes the Cushman. You don't think I took it for a waterspout, do you? Hey, get that anchor in. A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho. Goodbye, Disko. What's the matter? Have you run aground? You haven't any mail for Gloucester, have you, sir? If you'd save your wind to fill your sails... ...you might keep us from passing you. - We're going to race the Jennie Cushman? - Sure. Come on. This fine kind racing business. You got that backside anxious business, huh? You gonna row or swim to Gloucester, maybe. This fine time diving and swimming. Put your back into that windlass. You don't think that anchor's going to float up out of the water, do you? Sway up on them halyards... ...and you needn't be afeared of parting them. Wipe down them dories. We're going to bury her nose this trip. I can't work with this in me. Pull it through, will you? - Start hollering. Nobody hear you. - I haven't the time. Now stick that in your face and suck blood out. Anchor all clear. Get it aboard and cathead it. On your main halyards now. Sway up that mainsail! Come on, sway her up. Two blocks is where I want to see her. Come on! She's got a good lead on us, Capt. Disko. Yeah. Got his topsails set already. Running like a scared sardine. I'll climb over his stern rail or sail the bottom out of us. She's stepping now. Just look at this lady go. It's awful heavy going, Disko. If a big one ever hits her when she's heeled over like this... Don't you worry about this little lady. She can take care of herself. I told you so. Now what'll I do? Ease her off a bit. Give her a hand. She'll right herself. Disko must have picked up an engine someplace. Yeah. Well, wait till tonight. I'm shortcutting across Franklin Shoals. He won't dare follow me with his draft. - Six fathom. - Six fathom. Yes, sir... ...he's taking a shortcut across this bank, and thinking I'm going to get scared... ...and swing her off. Well, I'll cut shorter. Five fathom. They're feeling for the bottom, all right. - Five fathom. - He can do it with that hull of his, Disko. But we draw more water than the Cushman, don't we? I know what water we draw. You keep her to it. Three-and-a-half fathom. Hey, Disko, you ain't been looking down the neck of a jug again, have you? Now listen here, farmer, I can draw 16 feet of water... ...and not find bottom, can't I? I ain't ripping out no keels, but I'm going to beat Walt Cushman... ...into Gloucester and that's all there is to it. So don't you swing her off. Why, I know this bottom as well as my wife knows her own kitchen. - You keep her to it now. - I'm with you, Capt. Troop. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'll bet old Walt's hot under his hatches. - Shake your bustle, little woman. - Yes, sir. Manuel, we're gonna pass them soon. Oh, sure. That Disko, he pass anything. He half porpoise, I think, huh? What are you doing? I figure up how much I get my share fish in there. If market price good, say four-and-a-half, five cents pound, Manuel, he get... By golly, I gonna have lots of money. And with my $3 a month, I'll have $9, won't I? Sure. We very rich men, now, huh? We have fun spending it when we go ashore, you and me, huh? - What will you do ashore? - Well, first I gotta go church store. You know, where you buy a crucifix and Madonna and things. And I buy a little two-place gold candlestick I see there... ...that I take to church, and I light candles for my father's birthday. 3rd this month, August. Oh, that's very nice, Manuel. Not so nice as my father should have, maybe. It's nice in small way. I think maybe I light candle for myself, too. - I have few bad thoughts this trip. - You never had any bad thoughts. - Oh, sure. - What were they? - I forget them now but I have them I think. - Then what will you do? Oh, then I get dressed up. Oh, I go to get nifty suit. You know, purple-colored. Oh, very nifty suit. With cloth-topped shoes to match, you know? And big pearl buttons. And then I get new tie with big yellow flowers. Then I walk up and down Duncan Street, and I say, ""Hey, girls, girls... - ...hey, look, look. Manuel is in town"". - Girls? Oh, sure. Beautiful girls. I got maybe five, six girls in Gloucester. I tell each one I like her best. You gotta tell big lies to girls... - ...to make them happy. - You don't go with the girls? Oh, sure I go with girls. Every man go with... I guess maybe you're right. - I don't go with girls. - I kind of thought you were kidding. Oh, sure, sure. That girl business is all kidding. Sure. I think maybe I gotta do some more kidding from now on, huh? Here we talk all time about what I do. What you do? You talk to your father on telephone, huh? You tell him you live and happy, huh? My father? You forgot about your father what own that big boat you fall off... ...and he think maybe you swallowed up by shark or something. Oh, well, I don't know. You don't know how happy he be, huh? - Oh, I guess he'll be glad, all right. - He leave his skin, I think. He hug you to pieces and take those pieces back home with him, huh? But I don't want to go back home, Manuel. You don't want go home? Well, I mean... What do you mean, little fish? I want to stay here with you in Gloucester and go out fishing again this way. You want be fisherman? I want to be a better fisherman than Tom Platt or Dan. I want to be as good as you are. As good as me, huh? Oh, that very nice, little fish. But how about your father? He come, too? Oh, well, I could see him between trips, if he wants to see me. What you mean, if he want to see you, little fish? Oh, well, he's got his business and everything. He'd be all right. I want to be with you, Manuel. Please. My little fish. If you all want to see a boat what's going to be passed, come and see one. Hold her to it, Manuel. We'll lay her right alongside them. It will be the best boat from here in. I'll take a reach for his beard as we pass by. Them topsails will carry away if we keep this up. I'll take the lower spars out of her before I'll let Walt Cushman... ...work the windward of me. She's driving now. Yes, sir! Walk along, little girlie. They're coming now, Walt! I guess they got us. No, he ain't! There's more than one way to open a clam. Stand by to come about! What's this? Disko, he coming about. For more funny business, I think. Why, the calm-weather coward! Can't take an honest licking. Try and bluff me, will he? Stand by the main sheet! Steady, Manuel. Now watch him jump and holler when he has to give way. I'm gonna cut plumb across his bow! - Give away to her, Disko. - Well, I ain't giving way, neither. - You've got to budge. - I'll budge like a barnacle. She'll cut us down, sure. - Steady as you go! - Hold her to it, Manuel! Don't lose an inch. Land sakes, Disko, here she comes! Hard to starboard! I had the right of way, you old beach goat! - You must have mislaid it somewhere! - Still riding anchor, ain't you? Well, we ain't to Gloucester yet. I'll do more than keep you in sight, Disko! Capt. Cushman is a sailor But he should have been a tailor Oh, what a terrible man Oh, what a terrible man Cushman might have been a grocer But a first-class seaman, no, sir Oh, what a terrible man Oh, what a terrible man Poor old Walt broke his jib, and he's checking his topsails. You'll best do the same, Disko. That main top'll go if you don't. Well, since you're such a nervous galoot, and we got old Walt licked to a frazzle... I'll mind what you say. Go aloft with Jack, Manuel. Stand by to try the topsails. I go up to get a little air, I think, maybe? Want to luff her first? I'll luff her when you reach the masthead. Somebody open window and let in nice breeze, eh, Jack? I'll bet Manuel is the best fisherman in the whole fishing fleet, isn't he? Stand by to clue up the fore topsails! - Step lively up there now! - Slack away below! Hey! Look out for yourselves! - Watch it! - Manuel! Jump down! Manuel! Luff her, Nate! In heaven's name, Nate, luff her. I can't, she's jibing! Hold fast, Manuel! Manuel! Manuel! Get a dory overside! Are you all right, Manuel? Can you work free? Doc! Capt. Disko! We'll get you out of this in a minute, Portegoosie! He says he's good as dead. Gone. He knows it. Why, Doc? Why? He's stove in. All the bottom half of him's gone. But he don't want the kid to know. You're all right, aren't you, Manuel? You aren't hurt, are you? I all right, little fish. What's holding up that dory? Disko, don't put dory overside! You hear what Doc... But we've got to free you, Manuel. No. I say don't put dory overside! What's he mean? What's the matter, Manuel? Manuel! Hey, Harvey! Harvey, mind the boy! No, not out here. Go back. You're all right, aren't you? You aren't hurt, are you, Manuel? I all right. Get that dory in the water. I can't do nothing, Disko. He's fouled in the backstay. Manuel! The drift's tightening, Disko. You'll have to cut him loose, or it'll take him in half. No. We ain't cutting loose unless it's going to help you free Manuel. You cut him away, Disko, you hear me? Get me an ax! No, Capt. Disko. No! You cut that line, it'll carry him under. We can't just keep him out there till the line saws him in half. Get me an ax. I sorry about race, Disko. You beat him next year, huh? Manuel! Now listen, little fish... I go now and fish with my father. You remember I tell you he keep seat for me in his dory. What are you talking about? You're not going. We'll save you. We have good times together, eh, little fish? We laugh, we sing, so you smile now. Come on, smile. Long Jack can fix it. You'll be all right. See, Manuel? Good. Manuel, he be watching you. You'll be best fisherman ever, little fish. No, no, Manuel. No. Manuel! Well, goodbye again, Harvey. So long, sailor. Going down to get your pay, Harv? I guess so. You're leaving too, huh, Long Jack? Yep. You'll begin to grow whiskers right soon, and I thought maybe this might be... ...a good thing for you to start in with. Thanks. Thanks, Long Jack. You've just got fuzz now, but if you start scraping them off they'll toughen up... ...and get like... Get like... Fair weather, Harv. Goodbye, Long Jack. I got everything, I guess. Yeah. Say, Dan, these clothes... I guess I kind of wore them out some. Oh, that's all right. Well, Dan, I'd like to keep them... ...but I can't pay you out of my pay yet because... ...well, there's something I sort of wanted to do. So I was just thinking... There ain't no hurry. Your pop can settle it with my mom when he gets here. Say, is he really flying out here all that way? All in one day? I guess so. You sure got the laugh on all of us... ...him having all that money you said he had and everything. Say, Dan, when somebody... ...I mean, when something happens to somebody... ...what do they do with the rest of their things? Their family get them, I suppose, or whatever kin they have. Well, did he have any kin? No, not that anybody knowed of. Well... If someone liked someone a great deal... ...and he didn't have any kin, that would sort of make him a kin almost, wouldn't it? And, well, if they had something like this, for instance, that wasn't worth a lot... I don't know, Harvey. You better ask Pop about that. He'd know more about that. Oh. Well, boy, come to get your pay? Why... There you are, our deal when you signed on. Fisherman's Home? Yeah, that's where the poor and old and crippled of us... ...set on a sunny porch and try to out-lie each other. Manuel would want it that way. You wouldn't have a better idea, you think? Well, he wanted to get a candlestick for his father with two places. How much would that cost? Oh, $2 or $3, I reckon. Here. Oh, then that's all right. I have enough. What'll you do with the rest of Manuel's things, Capt. Disko? Oh, we'll send them up along to the Home, I guess. Does this have to go? Why, no, Harvey. I thought maybe you'd like to keep that. Your daddy will be here directly. You're kind of stretching to see him. Ain't you? Yes, sir. When are you going out fishing again? Oh, in about six weeks, when we're shipshape aloft. Well, will Dan go, too? No, that's the winter season. Dan'll stay here ashore, school. Then you'll need someone to take his place, won't you? Yes, sir, I need a good hand to take Dan's place. Well, I was thinking... Maybe I'm not quite good enough yet... ...but Manuel said I was getting... Manuel said... Well, son? Well, Manuel taught me so much, I know I could. And if you'll take me along, I'll... Well, now, there's nobody I'd rather sign than you, Harvey. But ain't you kind of forgetting... ...all the lost time you and your daddy have to catch up with each other? You'll want to berth alongside him for some time to come, won't you? - Yes, sir, but... - Harvey! ...he has lots to do. And I like being a fisherman. I've been thinking about it. I want to be as good a one as... I mean, I want to stay here with you on the We're Here. Harvey! Hi, Harvey! Where are you? It's Father. There's your daddy now, ain't it? Yes, sir. So if you'll tell me now... - ...whether I can... - Harvey! Hello, Father. Harvey, Son. Well, well. My boy again. So you see, Harvey, by leaving early tomorrow morning... ...we can get the sleeper plane out of Boston. - Yes, sir. - You'll like the sleeper plane. It's great. Big berths and everything, just like a Pullman. - I know. But, look, Father. - What? I was thinking that if... Maybe I could go somewhere on a boat. All right. I was going to put the yacht up for the winter... ...but we might take her out and go to Bermuda. I didn't mean the yacht, I meant the... Oh, well, I don't know. Well, you see, the plane would get us to the ranch... ...in time for the rodeo after the roundup. You'd like that, wouldn't you, Son? But there's no fishing out there, is there? The best trout fishing in the world. And if I do say it myself, I can teach you to cast a fly wherever you want to put one. Yeah, I read about that kind of fishing once in a magazine. Manuel said that any fish that ate a bug was some kind of a frog. Who's Manuel? He sounds like a pretty funny sort of person. He's the man that picked Harvey out of the water. Well, I certainly want to meet that man, Capt. Troop. - Where is he? - He's dead, Mr. Cheyne. Where are you going, Son? Just out. I'll be back in a little while. - Don't you want me to go with you? - No. I mean, I'll be back in a little while. Really, I will. Well, I guess that's all the vittles. Will you come in the parlor and chat a while? Yes. Where was he going, Capt. Troop? Oh, I reckon he has a couple of errands to do. Will you have a pipe? I got some pretty fairish tobacco here. - No, thanks. - Have a chair. That was fine pie, Mother. Thank you, Discobolus. I'll leave the dishes awhile. Dad, is this boom set in here just right? Well, let's see now. Capt. Troop, tell me, that hurdy-gurdy... ...and the razor, were they Manuel's? Yes, they was, Mr. Cheyne. He must have been a pretty fine man. Harvey's a fine boy now, the kind of boy I'd always hoped he'd be. Yes. They was real dorymates, Mr. Cheyne. Yes, I had that chance once. I'm afraid I threw it away. Now that I got the chance again, I... Well, I guess I'm just getting what I deserve. Well, as long as you set your course a little too late... ...maybe Manuel sailed it for you. But that don't say you can't sail it after him. You're still the boy's dad, man. A boy is never too old not to need a dad. You just hold a hawser out to him. Someday he's going to lay onto it and pull you right into his heart. And when you do get in there, you'll find Manuel mighty satisfactory company. Yes, sir. Sure you won't change your mind, have a pipe, Mr. Cheyne? No thanks, Capt. Troop. I... I think I'll take a little walk, if you'll excuse me. Yeah, why don't you do that? Stroll up by the church, maybe? Yes, it's mighty pretty there this time of evening. That one is from Manuel to his father. Yes, my son. And that one is from me to Manuel. Do you think they're good enough? I only had $9. Oh, I know they are. - What do I do now? - Would you like to kneel here and pray? - Can I say anything? - Anything. Do you have to stay here? No, my son. Look... ...I guess you have an awful lot of things to do... ...taking care of everybody. Look, if it is that way, the way Manuel said... ...could you fix it so someday... ...there'll be an extra seat in Manuel's father's dory... ...with him and Manuel? Because I just got to be with Manuel. I got to. I guess that's all I wanted to ask. So, please. Harvey. Harvey, Son. I just wanted to get out in the air for a little while. Go ahead, Son, let it go. I know about it. - I know about Manuel. - Please, please go away. Harvey, we haven't talked much before, have we? But we can start now. We can talk this over. We can talk over everything from now on, can't we, Son? You better go up to the house. I'll be back in a little while. - Really, I will. - No, let me stay here with you. Maybe I can help. Come here to your dad, Son. I don't mind your crying. Please don't get in this boat. This is Manuel's dory. Manuel's and mine. I know it hurts, Son, but you won't always feel like this. Just think, tomorrow you'll be on that big sleeper plane. Before you know it, you'll be flying right over the tops of the Rocky Mountains. I don't want to go anywhere but here. I want to stay here... ...and go fishing, the way Manuel did. - I want to be where Manuel is. - Harvey. Son, won't you listen? - I'm lonely, too. - Please, please go away. I'll be all right, if you'll please let me alone. Please. And so we are met here today... ...facing the open sea on three points of the compass... ...to pay tribute to the men who have sailed from this port... ...and gone down to that sea, never to return. For three centuries... ...women and children of Gloucester men have stood upon this shore and cried: ...""There go the ships"". This year, as every year... ...there are those that have waited in vain. It shall be ever thus. In years to come... ...women of Gloucester shall watch and wait... ...sending their prayers and faith to men over the horizon. Men whose every day is one of life and labor uncertain... ...but men of strong faith in themselves... ...in their ships... ...and in the God who is on land and sea. So to those of these men... ...whose last resting place is beneath the sea they loved... ...we pay our humble tribute... ...as we cast these wreaths and flowers... ...upon the waters of their outgoing tide.

If we could find your uncle. Ned Arrowsmith. I guess he'd take us in. Nobody ain't gonna take us in. We're going West. There's a whole lot of new things I aim to be seeing yet. And that was your grandmother. Martin. Fine stock to come from. Pioneer stock. Stubborn stock. That would make a medical man out of you. if anything will. It would make a real scientist out of you. if you live up to it. - Reading old Gray. eh? - Yes. sir. That's right. Physician's library. Three books... Gray's Aratomy. The Holy Bible. Shakespeare. Study. Martin. Someday you may be a great doctor. Get training. Go to college before you go to medical school. Study chemistry. Latin. physics. biology. Be a fine doctor. - Yeah. well? - My name's Arrowsmith. - Arrowsmith? - Martin Arrowsmith. I'm just starting medical school. and I thought I'd like to take my Bacteriology with you this fall instead of waiting till second year. That is. if you don't mind. Yeah? But I do mind. Well. I'm not going to be just an ordinary doctor. No? No. I want to be a research scientist like you. Dr. Gottlieb. Not as great as you are. of course. but... but I'm not interested in just giving pills to people. I'd rather find a cure for cancer. Yeah. if you can do that. you will be much greater than I. I really mean I want to find out things for myself. I know how little I know. and I'm not afraid of hard work. So now we begin to talk sensibly. M o To be a scientist. that is born in a man. And in very few men. It may be born in you. But first. go and be a medical student. Go learn the names of the diseases. Learn to work in the dissecting school without being sick. Learn to watch the blood flow without fainting. Go and get your M.D. after your name. And then... come back to me. - All right. Doc. up you go. - Fine. - You're new. aren't you. Doc? - I'll say so. I was born yesterday. That's why I come along. These people get kinda excited down here once in a while. Does anyone here speak English? - Tutto. sure. - Where's the patient? Well. congratulations. You're the father of a fine boy. No. no. I'm the uncle. he's the father. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Viro? Why. certainly. You know. Doctor. he's his first baby. Well. it's my first baby. too. - Nurse. I want to find Ward D. - Do you? - Can you direct me? - I could. yes. - Well. if it isn't interrupting your work... - This isn't my work. Nurses aren't supposed to scrub floors. Superintendent caught me smoking a cigarette. You go back for Ward D. turn right and then left. I've been informed that the first duty of a nurse is to stand when she speaks to a doctor. Gee. I've been getting fresh again. It may interest you to know that I'm Dr. Gottlieb's assistant and that I'm on my way to Ward D to take a strain of a very dangerous microbe. When I've done what I came here to do. I shall report you. What's your name? - What's yours? - Arrowsmith. - You're not reporting me. you know. - Gee. there I go again. Scrubbing floors just makes me rebellious. and being rebellious just naturally makes me fresh. and there you are. My name is Leora Tozer. It's a silly name. isn't it? What's wrong with it? I kinda like it. Thanks. When can you get away for dinner? With you? I've decided to overlook reporting you. How about tonight? - Well... - Why not? - I don't mind. - What time? You will report the patient's temperature to me every hour. I'll look in again at 7:00. At 7:00. - I've talked too much. - You haven't bored me. - I've been pretty technical. - I liked it. Made me feel intelligent. Well. at that. you've got to get used to hearing my ideas. - I'm gonna hear a lot of them? - You're going to marry me. - You don't tell me. - I certainly do. Now. you know. I shouldn't wonder if you're right. Of course. it's a little early in the game to be dead sure. but I shouldn't wonder. Guess you're pretty pig-headed and self-centered. aren't you? But I like you so much. I'd be a fool to pass you up. Have you got a nickel? Certainly. What for? I want soft music. You know. I wasn't being funny. I didn't think you were. M oa ovo M ovo oovo I hope you mean that. Because. I warn you. I'm never going to give you up. I've found you. My life's begun. I have sent for you. Martin. to tell you that I am leaving this place where I teach young doctors to kill their patients. I have been called to the McGurk Institute of New York where I shall do only my own research. McGurk? The McGurk Institute is the greatest scientific plant in the world. I am very happy. - Yes. sir. I should think you would be. - And I am happy for you. too. Martin. I have arranged for you to go with me as my assistant. You will have great opportunity there. You're the greatest man I've ever known. Dr. Gottlieb. I'd black your shoes for you. But I can't go to New York with you. It is many years since my shoes have been black. Martin. Anyway. I was not taking you as a bootblack. Why can't you go with me? I'm going to be married. And a man can't marry on what a lab assistant makes. so... I'll just have to practice medicine after all. Practice? Practice! To give pills to ladies. to hold their hands for them. to make their diets for them. Practice? You? You. who have the stuff that makes scientist in you? I'm sorry. sir. but that's how it is. Oh. well. I am too wise to argue with a man in love. You will be a bad doctor for a while. and then you will find your way back to us. And when you do. Martin. let me know. and... I will make a place for you. Go. Good luck to you. - I wish you happiness. - Thank you. sir. By the laws of God and by the laws of the state. I hereby pronounce you man and wife. Two dollars. please. The lady gets it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Don't mention it. Next. Well... we're married. - I don't feel any different. - I feel kind of flat. - So. where do we go from here? - You start practicing. How does a doctor start practicing? I've often wondered about that. Well. I thought you might take a train with me to my hometown. - That's Wheatsylvania. South Dakota. - Dakota? We got 366 inhabitants in Wheatsylvania. And not a doctor in the lot. Dakota. yeah! Real man's country. Frontier! Opportunity! You're gonna love South Dakota. Come on. we're on our way! For what we are about to receive. Lord. and for all the many blessings Thou hast bestowed upon our house. may we be truly grateful. Amen. - I always... - Leora. - What is it. Mom? - Look! Oh. that. - That happened day before yesterday. - This is too much. - Do you mean to tell me... - You've broken your old parents' hearts. - Now. Iook. here. l... - Martin. please. let me. I'm sorry. darling. but I've got to make my position clear. Mr. Tozer. I've been living alone and working hard for a long time. I intend to go on working hard. But I'm not gonna live alone any longer. That is. I'm not gonna live without Leora. You couldn't have stopped us getting married. But you would have tried to stop us getting married. And I can't waste time now. You asked me this afternoon if l... if I had any money. and l... If you think for a moment you're going to get one red cent out of this family simply because you've butted in where you weren't invited. I wanna know about it. I certainly wanna know about it. I'm not asking for money. I'm asking for your good will. I'm asking you to help me to start in practicing here. so I can support... Martin may not be asking for any money. but I am. Pa's gonna lend Martin $1.000 to start up an office. Martin'll pay him interest on it. That is. if Pa doesn't want to give it to us as a wedding present. - A thousand... - You can afford it. Pa. You know you can. - A thousand... - You sit down. And I don't wanna hear any more talk about it. because Martin's giving up a great career as a research scientist to be a country doctor so he can support a wife. And... and you all ought to just get down on your knees and appreciate him and stop scrapping. Will you give me a cigarette. please. Martin? - Leora! - You ain't learned to smoke cigarettes? Yes. I have. And now you can scream at me for a while and lay off Martin. Hey. Lee. Iook. That ought to bring 'em rolling in. Come inside and see what I've got. What have you got? Wait till you see. - What's that? - It's Pa's old Prince Albert. - What. for me to wear? - Certainly! Come on. Martin. stop. Now. this is serious. You put that on. Come on. - Now. let me see. - In a Ford. Well. you're a doctor. aren't you? I'm a country doctor. You bet you're a country doctor. Martin. You gotta to make the young folks get married when they ought to and stay married when they don't want to. You gotta lecture the big boys on the evils of drink and do your own drinking with the shades down. You gotta see that the backyards are tidy. and the milk's fresh. and the meat's pure. That's what being a country doctor means. Martin. I'm proud to know you. Fellow citizens! Do you realize. fellow citizens. there are 366 human souls in this town. and only one man to keep 'em fit? Yay! Leora. sweet. I didn't know a man could be so happy. - Is it a patient? - I think so. Hello. yes. the doctor speaking. My little girl. Mary. she's got a terrible sore throat. She look bad. Can you come right away? Yeah. I'll be right there. Sore throat. Might be diphtheria. - First patient. - About time. There's always a time when things begin to happen. - Four miles to go. - Four miles to glory. Four miles in eight minutes. Good luck. Martin! Don't cry. Mama. Doctor's here now. She looks pretty bad. We done all we could for her. Last night and tonight we steamed her throat. and we put her in the new bedroom. I think it's croup. A little wider. That's a good girl. A little more. That's it. Croup. huh? It is diphtheria. Diphtheria? What's that. diphtheria? I don't know. You fix her up good. Doc? You should have called a doctor before this. If this were a hospital. I'd operate. Try and... try and get some sleep. I'll let you know if there's any change. No. Doctor. Gottlieb was right. I am a rotten doctor. Don't say that. Martin. You did your best. No. I didn't. though. I should have operated. No matter what. I should have operated. You have followed me tonight through the jungles of Africa. You have seen how David Bruce conquered sleeping sickness there. You have waded with me in the Italian marshes where Grassi identified and doomed the malarial mosquito. I have sung to you tonight the praises of your four American doughboys who sacrificed their lives. volunteered to become human guinea pigs. that mankind might be saved from yellow fever. Here in India. and in China. too. from where comes the bubonic plague. I have seen village after village dying. with no help from no doctor nowhere. except me. I sound like pretty important fellow. huh? Well. I am. Not so far ago the whole population of London was nearly wiped out because a little rat carried the germ of the bubonic plague on a ship from China to England. Now that could happen again. I tell you. we don't want no more old-style soldiers. We want new-style doctor-soldiers. Scientific soldiers. Yeah. That's all. - Thank you. Doctor. very nice. - Thank you. thank you. Yeah. - And you. you have questions to ask? - My name's Dr. Arrowsmith. I thought perhaps if you weren't due someplace. you might care to come out and have a... - A drink? - Something of that description. yes. I just think I would. You know some nice place. cool place. here in Detroit... Where am I tonight? - This is Minneapolis. - Min... Yes. there's a fine beer joint here. With real beer. I buy you a drink. Come on. I was assistant to Max Gottlieb. You know him? Gottlieb! The greatest. The spirit of science. I had once the pleasure to speak to him in New York. But let us not be serious. Let us drink. Let us sing. She's a dark and roving eye And her hair hung down in ringlets She's a nice girl... Yes. I've a new lease on life. No doubt about it. you can see for yourself. I'm a new man. I've been stagnating for two years. I'm not going to stagnate any longer. - Have some coffee. - Thanks. Bacon? Eggs? No. thanks. Have some toast. - You must eat something. you know. - I can't. Lee. sweet. It's all right. Lee. sweet. Good babies always make their mothers a little sick. Poor Martin. - You'll be tied down worse than ever now. - What do you mean. tied down? I don't have to go to Africa to save mankind. Plenty of mankind around here. We'll see the world yet. And we'll take the boy with us. Even if he turns out to be a girl. we'll take him. Martin. going places! In the meantime. you watch me stand this town on its ear. - Doc. - Dr. Arrowsmith. - What is it? - It's about Johnny. - Johnny? - He wants to get his tooth pulled. Are you Johnny? All right. get around to the front. I guess I can't save mankind till I've saved Johnny. Poor Martin. Come on. Johnny. Stand over here. and let's have a look at that tooth. You boys sit on the sofa. And you better hold that dog. He might think I'm hurting Johnny. I wouldn't hurt him. Only dentists do that. And I'm no dentist. Now open your mouth. Is that the one? Yes. I thought it would be. All right. Johnny. you sit over here. You can shut your mouth. Did you ever stop to consider. Johnny... ...how wonderful nature is? In giving us two chances of growing teeth? We get a practice set first. Just to practice brushing our teeth on. Then we get a real set later. And you know. Johnny. somehow... I don't think you're making the most of your tooth-brushing opportunities. Had coconut pie for supper last night. didn't you? All right. Now. Johnny. I'll tell you what's gonna happen. The pain is gonna leave that tooth and it's gonna come all the way along this... this piece of string and disappear into something I've got here in my hand. Now look out. Johnny. it's coming! There you are. Hey. boys. listen. Here's half a dollar. That's a soda apiece and a dime over for gumdrops. then I can get the rest of your teeth. Come on. - Thank you. Doc. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. Doc. What's the matter. Henry. trouble? Well. my cattle got blackleg out by my farm. - Blackleg? - Yeah. Half my cows is dead already. Blackleg. What do you do for that? - Well. the state ""vegeteterian."" he come. - The state what? The... the cattle doctor. That's him over there. Oh. yes. the vet. Yeah. he's got a needle thing just like you got. But he don't do no good. The poor cows just die quicker. Come on. let's have a look at it. Come on. Henry. I'll be turning vet on you before you know it. That's a pretty bad swelling. You better milk her before she dies on you. - Hello. Doc. - Howdy. Doc. That's my cow there. I'm sorry. gentlemen. but this corral has been commandeered as a state experimental station. It ain't open to the public. - Are you the state veterinarian? - That's me. Well. I'm Dr. Arrowsmith. - I don't believe I know that name. - Well. I'm only a physician. Well. if you've got any influence with these crazy Swedes around here... they seem to think I'm a miracle man. There's no medicine on earth that's sure-fire. - Novak says you use a serum. - Sure. we use a serum. I like to fool around with a microscope. Doctor. and if you'd let me have a bit of your serum and a blood specimen from one of these sick animals... just for the fun of the thing. Why. sure. You. let me have some of that. - Great things. these serums. - Oh. yes. yes. - What is it? - Research. darling. research. Blackleg. cattle disease. I'm turning vet on you. Saving cows may not be the same thing as saving mankind. but it's a step in the right direction. Here's the blood and here's... - Yes. Martin. - I was right. That serum wasn't any good. Yes. Martin. Now. I'm ready to go. and we'll try mine in the morning. Yes. Martin. I'm gonna take it over to Henry's and shoot all his cattle full. Yes. Martin. You see. I'm gonna try a different... a different strength dose on every cow. And then we can see which gets well quickest and which dies quickest. Yes. Martin. Darling. are you hungry? Darling. are you hungry? Hungry? Yes. by gosh. I'm famished. - I'm not surprised. it's after 10:00. - Well. let's have some dinner. How can I cook dinner when you're using the whole stove to cook your old cow medicine? We can have some sandwiches. We've had nothing but sandwiches for days! What's the matter with sandwiches. dear? Five days. Henry. and not a new case yet. Not a one. Doc. I thought she was a goner. but she looks all right now. By golly. Doc. you should be state's vet in South Dakota. I'm sorry about that pair. Henry. You should have shoot your stuff in them. too. That's where you're wrong. Listen. the ones we gave the serum to are all right. The ones we didn't give it to are dead. Don't you see? You have to try both ways when you're experimenting. That's how you find out which way is best. Well. I ain't kicking. Doc. How much I owe you? Forget it. It was just for the fun. Pretty good fun for me all right. Doc. Thanks. Next time you see Dr. Arrowsmith. tell him for me that I don't stand for this kind of monkey business. and if he can't keep off my cattle. he'd better keep out of my way. I'll run him out of the state. I'll see the governor. see that his license is taken away from him. Hiya. Doc. How are ya. Doc? - I've got some things to show you. - You got nothing to show me. - You know best. - Where you been. Doc? - You're quite a vet. Doc. - Best in town. - I'm back on the bellyaches now. though. - That's where you belong. - How's that? - I say bellyaches is where you belong. I don't want to say anything. Doc. but... I don't quite like the tone in your voice. - It's about time you understood... - What? Suppose you try understanding that I've made a blackleg serum that's better than yours. because mine cures the cows. and yours doesn't. When you get that through your head. drop over and I'll show you how to make more like it. If you think you're gonna discredit me and then hold me up... I'm not holding you up. I'm giving you this. Well. you see this? It's what I'm giving you. If you won't take the serum from me. you'll take it from the government. I've sent my reports and samples in to Washington already. Now. what was that you were going to give me. Doctor? Why. you! - That's all right. - You're all right. Doc. Right on the jaw. - Dr. Arrowsmith! - What is it. Johnny? - They've been looking for you all over. - They? Who? Everybody at your house. Your wife took sick this morning after you left. I'll have to ask you to be quiet. Doctor. I'm Dr. Hesslikn. of Leopolis. They called me when they couldn't locate you. The baby? But you can't blame yourself. Doctor. You couldn't possibly have foreseen it. It would have happened anyway. Well... ...as long as I've still got her. Thank you. Doctor. My darling! Lee. sweet! My darling. There... I'll never forgive myself for leaving you like this. Shh. darling. N o o Now I can't have a baby. I'll have to bring you up. I know. Make a great man that everybody will wonder at. Like... like your... Sondelius. or your Gottlieb. even. Don't feel badly. Martin. Lee. sweet. If we could only... Anyway. now we... Oh. let's get out of this! Now I remember. I got a telegram in my pocket for Doc Arrowsmith from New York City. Well. I... I'm gonna love New York! - Scares me. though. - Yeah. me. too. I guess this is us. - All of that? - No. Only the 25th floor. Way up there? ""McGurk Institute only."" - Did you say 25th floor. Martin? - 25th. yes. I'm not going up that high yet. - No. sir. I've got to get used to this first. - Right. Going up! Go. I'd like to see Dr. Gottlieb. if I may. Have you an appointment? Well. he's expecting me. I wired him I was coming. My name is Dr. Arrowsmith. It's Dr. Tubbs you want to see. Dr. Tubbs is our director. You may come with me. - Doctor. - Martin. my boy! So... you have come back to me. as I said you would. Glad to be with you again. sir. And you have come back on your own feet. without any help from me. - I am very glad. - Thank you. So this is the big cow doctor from the West. Delighted to welcome you. Dr. Arrowsmith. A most interesting experiment of yours with the cattle disease. Yeah. Martin. this is Dr. Tubbs. our director. And this is Terry Wickett. a fine chemist. You will be able to meet your other colleagues later. But. Dr. Gottlieb... You will leave my prodigal son to me for a moment. eh? Let me conduct him to his laboratory. Do you think I know enough to work here. Dr. Gottlieb? Now. let us be clear. Martin. You will do your own work here and have no one but yourself to satisfy. A man should do fine work with all this. This? This does not make a scientist. His equipment is here. And a man who cannot make his own laboratory out of toothpicks and a piece of string. he should buy his ideas along with his fine equipment. God give me clear eyes and freedom from haste. God give me anger against all pretense. God keep me... looking for my own mistakes. God keep me at it till my results are proven. God... ...give me strength not to trust to God. Winter again. Well. it was bound to come. I mean. it always has come. That's a fine mess of bugs you got here. Shove them in the incubator. and let's go out and catch a drink. Well. I'll put them in the incubator. but. if you don't mind. I'm going home. Martin. for the love of Pete! I'm sorry. Terry. but I don't feel like drinking tonight. - You are in a bad way. So long. - So long. Terry. - Is that you. Martin? - Yup. How did things go today. any better? About as usual. It just scares me to death to see you this way. Well. you won't be scared much longer. Lee. I've made up my mind to chuck it before they fire me. I've been down there two whole years and haven't accomplished a darn thing. I'm no good. I'm worse at science than I was at doctoring. You mustn't say such things. I won't have it. You may be on the verge of a great discovery this very minute. I've got kind of a feeling that you are. No. don't look at me like that. I mean it. And you'll feel much better when you've had your dinner. too. It's a swell dinner. I bought a beautiful fish this afternoon. Fish. I wish you'd get that old lab out of your mind. I'm through with the lab. all right. I'm not hungry. Lee. Neither am I. I think I'll go for a walk. - I'll come along. - In this snow? I love snow. Come on. I'll get your things. We'll hike across the park. Martin. It'll be like the Canadian Northwest tonight. The park's this way! - Why. Lee. sweet! - I thought you'd be coming back here. And you... you tagged along all that way? You poor kid. That's all right. I didn't mind. I'm a brute. You ought to get a new husband. - Come inside. I'll get you a taxi. - I don't want a taxi. - Let me go up with you. - But. my dear. l... - I have to work. It may be late. - I don't care. I won't bother you. I promise not to open my mouth. Only please. don't send me home. It-it's such a scary night... - I'll imagine things. - What things? Things. All right. Come along. Well... what... What is it? It's got me. Something funny. I left these three flasks thick with bugs. And these two are still thick with them. But this one... They've completely disappeared from this one. Nothing ever happened like that before. Is that good luck or bad? I wouldn't know. I don't know. We're just starting on something new. it's... - Then it is bad luck. I'm sorry. - I don't know that it's bad. Might be something... ...better than anything. Quick. Lee. light that... light the burner. Give me that stain. No. the other one. What is it. Martin? I was right. They're dead. Bugs don't commit suicide. What killed them? Does it matter? ""Does it matter?"" Lee. I'll say it matters. Something in this clear flask killed them. Maybe it was some fool mistake of mine. but I've got to find out what it is. Because it might... it might just happen that... ...that it turns out to be the greatest thing... How? I won't say it. I won't throw my luck. I'm going to work it out. - Tomorrow. Martin. - No. no. tonight. Right now. You go home and get some sleep. What I need... I've got to have some of... some clean flasks. That is enough of chemistry for today. Terry. We go out now. and drink maybe one glass of beer. Maybe one. maybe two. Sounds reasonable. Chief. I'll get Martin. Where's he been keeping himself lately? I haven't seen him since... - For the love of Pete! - Martin. what is it? - Been working. - You look it. All night long. Two nights. a couple of weeks. I don't know. Look. Notes. Wish you'd look at them. Chief. - Think I may have found something. - What? Don't ask me. All I know is it's... it's hell on the bugs. Dissolves them. eats them up. slaughters them. wipes them off the... You're groggy. aren't you? It's all right. Terry. I fancy I must have been all in... when I started. I need sleep. Food. I need a drink. Terry. I need that more than anything. I'll get it for you. Here. Just wrap yourself around this. Two shakes of a lamb's tail. What? You have a big thing here. A great thing. Terry. Iook. N o Now you must find out what it is. How many different kinds of bacteria it will destroy. That way you will find out what it is good for. You will begin working in earnest. I am very glad. Martin. I'm glad you feel that way. sir. Boy! You are shooting high! We're gonna celebrate. I don't care how tired you are. we're gonna celebrate. - I always knew the kid had talent! - Thanks. Terry. - What do you mean by getting up? - I got to go back to work. Look at you! What's wrong with me? I shaved. You promised you'd stay in bed 12 hours. and you haven't been there three. I couldn't sleep those three hours. I'm not gonna have any more of this. do you hear that? I'm not gonna stand by and see you kill yourself. I'll walk out on you. I mean it. You mustn't ever say that. no matter how mad you get. Lee. I love you so. Even if this darned work does tie me up. I know I've been neglecting you. But when this is over. I'll take time off every day. and we'll go to the movies. and we'll have friends in. and I'll send you flowers every morning. Nice big red roses. I'll even learn to play bridge. Stand by. old girl. Have some coffee? You got the nastiest way of treating me. Martin Arrowsmith. As if I wanted flowers every morning. All I want is for you to take care of yourself. You're a rotten husband. But I'd rather have you than all the decent ones in the world. Please. go back to bed! What is it? - Where's my hat? - What's the matter? That cheap publicity hound Tubbs is the matter! Murder's the matter! Make a cheap fake out of me. will he! You wait a minute! You forgot your... - Hello. Dr. Arrowsmith. - How about a picture? - Very good. - Is Mr. Tubbs down yet? Yes. Dr. Arrowsmith. I'll see if he's engaged. - No. I'll see for myself. - Just a minute. Doctor! - Good morning. Martin. - Are you responsible for this? I don't deny the responsibility. I claim it. A slight overstatement to catch the public eye... A slight overstatement. You tell the papers that I can cure all disease when you know I can't even cure whooping cough yet. And you call that ""a slight overstatement."" - I can understand your surprise. - My surprise? My only surprise is that I don't wring your fat neck. - My husband's a violent man. - I know your husband. And I mean the world to know him and appreciate him as I do. After all. he's still got his name to make. You've done that for me. You've made my name smell from one end of this country to the other as a quack and a faker and a racketeer. Call your reporters in and tell them I'm through with you and your front page publicity and your cheapjack institute. I'd much rather tell them of the paper I've just signed. Yes. Dr. Gottlieb. We are busy at the moment. Busy turning my friend Martin into a megaphone. - That's all right. Chief. - Something has happened. But it's something not altogether bad. Martin is not the discoverer we thought he was. But you don't mean that someone has stolen... Yes. A Frenchman. D'Herelle of the Pasteur Institute of Paris. He has published his report. It is the same thing. You have got into the newspapers too soon. Dr. Tubbs. Of course. there can be no talk of the Head of Department now. No raise of salary. either. Well l... I've got to say something to those reporters. I am sorry. Martin. Come to my office later. I love that man Gottlieb. He might have gloated. Three stowaways in the hold. sir. dead. What is it? Come on. Sondelius. we have a look. Where was your last port of call? Blackwater. St. Hubert Isle. Did you hear anything there about bubonic plague? - No. - No. These three men died of bubonic plague. I tell you. gentlemen. in West India is bubonic plague. Are you certain of this. Dr. Sondelius? I have investigate. If you don't believe me. call up my good friend Captain Gunnersson of the steamer Sverker. He will tell you. He live by the hotel... What the devil's the name of that hotel in Hoboken? My dear Dr. Sondelius. I'm not questioning your authority. but it's difficult to believe that in the West Indies... Nothing is difficult to believe where rats are concerned. I am no novice at rats neither. Dr. Tubbs. I am only novice in scientific institutions where. all day long. scientists sit and look through microscopes and see nothing. But. my dear Dr. Sondelius! - In common justice to a fine institution... - Excuse me. Dr. Tubbs. Yes. Miss Robbins? A cable just came from London. Doctor. It's from the Colonial Office. There. Dr. Sondelius. is your confirmation. I don't need none. I should like the Institute to have a part in this. Miss Robbins. ask Dr. Arrowsmith if he can receive Dr. Sondelius and myself. Yes. Doctor. Well. what does Dr. Arrowsmith...? Only one year ago. one little year. Dr. Tubbs. you were so excited about my friend Arrowsmith's discovery. Oh. yes. to be sure! But that was... Only something that killed bacteria. that is all? Thank you. Dr. Gottlieb! - I wonder... - I think so. Arrowsmith... Don't I know that name? Young fellow? Dark? Mustache? Sure! Didn't I got drunk with him in Montreal? No. no. Indianap... Well. well. Arrowsmith. it is the same. How are you. my friend? So. you are become great! You hold the stuff of salvation in your hands. I'd like to believe that. I can't quite believe it yet. though. Martin is a very careful fellow. Dr. Sondelius. He has only worked one year on this discovery. After five years. he may be confident that he is right. Five years? He cannot wait for five years. In five years. the whole population of the West Indies will be wiped out. The bubonic plague will be raging in New York. I don't know anything about bubonic plague. But I know. I will teach you what I learn in China and in India. Give me blood germs. give me rats. rat fleas. little jumpy fleas. I will teach you what I learned in China and India. I will show you. Then I will go with you. So. you are off to the West Indies tomorrow. That's right. sir. We have called you in. Terry and I. to give you your final instructions. What are they. sir? Can you be trusted. Martin. to conduct an experiment where you are going? What is the experiment? It is agreed that it will be of value to know what this stuff of yours is good for. Why. yes. of course. Well... If you could give injections to. say... only half your patients. and sternly deprive the other half of them... then you would know. I certainly would. yes. That is the experiment. Martin. I've done that sort of thing with cattle. but. good Lord. these are human beings. So. you're just a country doctor. after all. Country doctor be blowed. I've got compassion in me. These people are gonna be dying and begging me for help. It's up to you to stand up and take it on the chin. So many men are kind and neighborly. so few ever add to human knowledge. It's a good deal to ask. just the same. Spare your pity for generations not yet born. Martin. and you may be the man to end all plague. I am an old man. Martin. I have been an honest scientist all my life. I look to you to carry on my work after me. Are you going to fail me? No. sir. no. I am not going to fail you. I... I knew. For the old man's sake. keep your notes complete down there. And keep them in ink. You sound as though you thought I wasn't coming back. Don't be silly. All ashore who's going ashore! I'm not much of a seeing-off committee. but good luck to you down there and take care of yourself. - Take care of Gottlieb. - I will. Good luck to you. Doctor. We will drink your health in good West Indian rum. It's time. Lee. Yes. Martin. We won't say good-bye. - Will you try not to be too lonely? - I will. That's a brave girl. Excuse me. madam. but which cabin does the trunk belong in? - In Dr. Arrowsmith's. of course. - Yes. madam. - Wait. I haven't got a trunk. - Don't confuse him. It's my trunk. - What do you mean. your trunk? - You had to find out sooner or later that I'm going along with you. - Lee. you're not. - Yes. I am. in spite of everything. You'll do no such thing. Hold that gangplank! On board? - What is it. Doctor? - Get her ashore. - Have to step lively. madam. - No. I won't step lively. I told you I wouldn't let you go there without me and I meant it. And you can't put me off. Nobody but the captain can. I've got a ticket. - No. Lee. please! - I love you. - She stays. - Step to the cabin. madam. I shall divide my group into two halves. To one. I shall give injections of our serum. I shall deprive the other half of any injections whatsoever. I shall then watch which half resists the plague more successfully. When I have done that. I shall know what our serum is worth. Good heavens! The man's a lunatic. Order. gentlemen. order. order. I can handle this. Order. Do you mean to say you can't find any other way to test your serum? There is no other way. You call yourself a doctor and want to see half your patients die? No. sir. no. no. The uninjected half will be fully as well taken care of as they are at present. You actually propose using the inhabitants of this island as you use guinea pigs in your laboratories? Well. you put it unpleasantly. Sir Robert. but that is what I do precisely propose. and for precisely the same benefit to mankind. Well. we decline the honor in the name of civilization. Hear. hear! Hear. hear! I think civilization's on my side. Sir Robert. You see only this one epidemic on this island. I have to see whole continents and generations of children yet unborn in China. in India. and even. it seems. in your own West Indies. I have to say to all humanity. ""This is the prevention. this is the cure. ""You may count on it as you count on quinine for malaria and castor oil for the bellyache."" Because that is what humanity wants to hear. Humanity is not going to hear it at our expense. Well said. Sir Robert! N o While you are on this island. you stick to your doctoring. - That is for me to say. not you. - What the devil do you mean? I mean that if you prevent this experiment. my instructions leave me free to withhold my serum until you come to heel. Confound your instructions. But what... what are we going to do. sir Robert? Sir Robert. hadn't we better reconsider? Order. order. This meeting is adjourned. But. Sir Robert. what shall we do? Die like men... before we let these bandits turn us into a shambles. If it weren't for the quarantine. I'd drive them off the island with whips and scorpions. Sir Robert is quite right. I tell you this... - That was a fine fight. - If I hadn't lost it. You didn't mean that. about holding the serum back? I made them think I meant it. Call me inhuman! I'll show them what the word really means! How's that. Gottlieb? Dr. Arrowsmith. My name is Oliver Marchand. Dr. Marchand. I have my M.D. from Howard University. I've been listening to your proposal. Doctor. I need hardly say that it has my complete sympathy. Thank you. May I offer you an alternative? If you care to come along with me. I believe I can provide the opportunity you're after. - Did you hear that. Gustav? - Yeah. I hear. It will be a privilege to assist you. And if you succeed. it will be a privilege for my people to have served the world. How soon will you be starting? If you'll come over to my place... You don't have to tell me. it came off all right. For once you're wrong. Lee. It couldn't have come off worse. That is. until my savior turned up. This is my savior. Dr. Marchand. my wife. - How do you do? - Come in. Doctor. We've got to move fast. no time to lose. I'll put my things in here. Lee. throw some clothes in a knapsack. - You're going away? - You bet I'm going. - With him? - With him. God bless him. He had the nerve to take a chance and let me do my stuff. Yes. he's a man after my own heart. Wait. where are you going? To his district. Island of Carib. Native population. plague raging. Ideal conditions. - Are you going now? - As soon as we get packed. Sondelius is out chasing up his squad of rat catchers. You might put his things in. too. will you? - Excuse me. Doctor. - I'll wait outside. What is it. Lee? Are you planning to leave me behind? Lee. I've got to. I didn't come here to be left behind. I should have choked you before I brought you along here. You did everything but choke me to stop me. But now that I'm here. I'm not going to be left behind. I've come here to look after you. How can I look after you if you leave me behind? - I'll be all right. sweet. - How do I know that? lt... it might get you. And if it did. there's nobody but me could nurse you. And even if it didn't get you. I'd go mad being without you. Can't you see? I haven't got any life beside you. I'm you. and I've got to be with you. You cannot leave me behind. Lee. sweet. Be reasonable. We don't know where we'll be living off. what we'll be getting into. I daren't take you along with me. It's no place for a woman. Darn being a woman! Give me the comfort of knowing you're safe. - All right. - There's a brave girl. N o Now. will you help me with this knapsack? Bella? Will you come in here. Bella? Bella. I want you to pack the doctors' knapsacks for them. I want you to put in their pajamas. the thin ones. and their underwear and their socks. And. Bella. their razor. toothbrushes. and toothpaste. Can I help you. Martin? I'm all right now. Sorry I cracked up. That's a good girl. Now. here we are. Alcohol. serum... hypodermics. notebooks. Yes. they're ready. - Fountain pen. - Fountain pen. Thanks. - How about these? You want these? - No. I don't want those. Have you got any water boiling on the stove? There should be. Stick the whole works in. will you? - I can't leave those around. - What is it? Plague virus. Enough to kill half a dozen armies. Everything's ready. missy. All right. I'm off to glory. Lee. Wish me luck. I can't go outside. Will you kiss me good-bye here? No. no. Lee. Steady. old girl. This is only the first of our big hikes. If I pull this thing off on Marchand's island. I'll be a great man in science. I do love you. Martin. Wait for me. Lee. I won't be long. Here's where we land. Doctor. It's the island of Carib. You can see the jetty right ahead of us. The worst-infected place in the entire colony. You'll have plenty of opportunity here to do what you want. Voodoo. Their voodoo is just about as effective as anything we've been able to do. Yeah. we show them a new kind of voodoo. The only thing to do with this place is to burn it. - If we can only get the authority. - We'll take the authority. General Sondelius is now in command. We'll get these people out of here and find them a clean place. We'll take off our coats and get to work. We'll get in the supplies. - The medical supplies. - And build a hospital. Sure. we'll kill the rats. the bugs. the germs. I'll get these people out of here. Here. here is food. canned food. - Where is the owner? - The owner lives in London. - How about the agent? - The agent. he's dead. - Who are you? - I'm watchman. Good. you are a fine watchman. Break down the door. Come on. What the devil is the meaning of this? You have empty bunkhouses and beds. We want them right away for emergency hospital. If you think you're going to bring that filthy plague onto this plantation. you can go to blazes! That's just where we are going. We accept your hospitality. Martin. move in. - Come on. - Hurry up. - All right. Gustav. - Yeah. Martin. Don't forget. half to get the injection. half to be sternly deprived. All right. Marchand. let them in. We're off. Gottlieb. All right. two lines here. Right and left. Go on. Go on through. - Don't we get nothing. Doctor? - Not on the right. Keep moving. It's Dr. Arrowsmith's orders. Half to the left. half to right. You ought to be glad to be hurting. I'm sorry. I can't do anything for him. poor baby. You take him. Don't holler before you're hurting. I am clumsy. That's four hypodermics I broke this morning. Get some more from Dr. Arrowsmith. Hot. ja? I think I'll sit down. Just a little. I apologize if I seemed to be unfriendly last night. Doctor. Didn't know what you were up to then. I approve thoroughly. Indeed. it's splendid what you're doing. Doctor. No objections to giving us a shot? We stood in line with the rest. We'll step over to the other line if you like. Doctor. this is my daughter. And this is Mrs. Lanyon. from your New York. Marooned here with the rest of us. That's quite all right if you'll get into line with the rest. I didn't mean to be rude just now. but you took me by surprise. I wish you'd find something I could do to help you. You? Yes. I feel an awful rotter doing nothing. You! Why? Do I strike you as being so hopelessly useless? If I had a twin sister. I think she'd be rather like you. That's how you strike me. That's an original compliment. That's no compliment. it's a scientific fact. Now. would you pass along. please. and let science carry on? All right. Miss Twyford. Dr. Sondelius is sick. sir. Would you come right away? Sondelius sick? What's the matter with him? Here. Marchand! You take over for me. I've got to... Gustav! - What is it. Gustav. what is it? - I don't know. Martin. I'm not feel so good all day. but now l... Good Lord. Maybe the bugs have got me. Martin. You wouldn't take your shot before. but you're gonna take it now. - Quick. bring me one of those trays. - At my age! I was just thinking. Martin. I am nearly 60 years of age. I could lift weights once no sailor could touch. And now... l'm so weak. I... - Bring me a glass of rum. - No. Later. You're going to take this shot now and go back to Blackwater and have Leora nurse you. I. who have quarantined so many. It is my turn now. Why the devil didn't I bring Leora along with me? No chance? Steadily worse. I'm afraid. Thanks. Don't let us keep you. - Rain. - Only a shower. I'll take you home. No. you go. Mr. Twyford. I'll wait. if you don't mind. You'll get soaked. You ever think the jokes God plays? The best one is on the tropics. He made them so beautiful and so rich. And then He give them the plague. All right. I am quite peaceful. Did you ever see Sto... You ever see Stockholm? I would like just once more to see the Strandvagen at dawn. with the young snow falling white. and stagger home through it with one more last good drunk. I feel fine now. I think I'm a little weak. It's a great life. You try to save all these poor devils. Save all of them. Let science experiments go. I never knew before people could hurt me so much. I think I'll sleep... just a little. I'm sorry. He used to troupe all over the country lecturing on heroes of health. Now he's one of them. all right. It was good of you to come. You take it pretty calmly. Doctor. When one of your field officers in the war died in battle. you couldn't stop to mourn for him. You must come home with us. You must let us put you up. Well. thanks. I... I'd love to. But I can't come till Marchand and I have... Let me send down two men to do it for you. I'd rather do it myself. if you don't mind. It's little enough. And then? Why. then. we... we carry on. of course. Lord. Lord Lord. Lord Why hast Thou turned Thy face away. Lord? Lord. save us Lord. preserve us Lord. don't let thy children die Lord. Lord Oh. Lord Arrowsmith. where are you? Well. there you are. Your friend Marchand wants to see you. Hello. Marchand. Nothing wrong down below? I've been called back to Blackwater. I hope your working with me hasn't made trouble for you. The port doctor is down. Seems there's no one but me to call on now. You'll have to go. then. That means I'll have to stay longer than I expected. I had intended putting Marchand in charge of our show. but now... Well. somebody's got to watch things. You're welcome to stay here as long as you care to. Doctor. - Ten days should do it. Doctor. - Ten days. Is there anything I can do for you in Blackwater? You might look in on my wife. Marchand. Tell her... - Tell her not to worry. - Certainly. Hold a while. please. he'll be here in a minute. - It's for you. Arrowsmith. - Thanks. Dr. Arrowsmith? This is Marchand calling from Blackwater. Yes. Marchand. what is it? I can't hear you. Marchand. Are you there. Marchand? Operator. operator. get me the Surgeon General's office back again. Dr. Marchand. Well. you've got to make them answer. Then send somebody over there at once. Dr. Marchand's ill. This is Dr. Arrowsmith at Carib. No. I'm two hours away. Send somebody at once. Anybody. My dear fellow! It's Marchand. It's more than Marchand. it's my wife. I've got to get her over here. I've got to. She'll be alone in that hole now. - Bring her here. of course. - Certainly. bring her here. - How soon can I get her here? - How soon? What if I start now? Have you got a boat of some sort? Yes. I'll get it ready. You have... You have... You have to come home. Help me. Martin. Please. Gone. Missy gone. M goo M goo M goo Lee! Leora. wake up. we're here! She's dead. I thought she'd be safe! But she's dead. We'd better pick her up. No. let me. I'd rather... I loved you. Lee. You knew that. didn't you? Didn't you know I couldn't love anyone else? Didn't you know that. Lee? Give them all the serum. Shoot 'em full of it. Come on. open the doors. let 'em all in! - Open the doors! - Come on! Let them in! Come. come. children. Let them in. Go on. hurry. hurry. Go around. Get all your... Doctor. l... I just... Great job. Thank you in the name of the colony. I'm licked! You never beat me. but I'm licked. Go on. line up. get your shot. Get over there. get your shot. all of you. Go on. line up. Get your shot full of serum. Kill all the rats. Burn all the villages. To hell with the experiment. to hell with science. to hell with Gottlieb! My dear Martin. congratulations. There's never been anything like it. It's stupendous! Letters from the British government. You have ended plague. M oa ca o o In my enthusiasm of the moment. I forgot. My deepest sympathy. Great story. Dr. Arrowsmith. Tell us all about it. Do. Keep on the left. On the left. folks. On the left. folks. You'll have to hurry. my dear fellow. My man will take care of your luggage for you. - Hold it. right there. - Right there. please. That's fine. One more. Hold still. Just a minute. Doctor. Right. We'll get another one. Doctor. Please. - One more. now. Very nice. - Right this way. Doctor. What have you got to tell us? - Hello. Martin. - Hello. Terry. - Sorry. Martin. - Thanks. Terry. - How was it? - Bungled it. Terry. - Afraid you had. - What'll Gottlieb say? You'll find that out. - How is the old man? - Well. I'm afraid he's... Dr. Gottlieb? Are you ready? - What for should I be ready? - For the reception. Doctor. They're bringing him up in the elevator now. He will come to me. He is my son. More than my son. Even if you do make a clown out of him. Out of my laboratory with your... your nonsense. Dr. Mayne. how d'you do? Glad you're here. - Where's Dr. Gottlieb? - We'll send for him. - Will you fetch Dr. Gottlieb. please? - No. please. I'll go to him. Master and pupil. you know. I want to confess. You gave me everything you knew of truth. And when you gave me my chance as well. I betrayed you. I had an excuse. perhaps. but I don't want to go into that. Because whatever I may have accomplished. I did not add to knowledge. I did the humane thing. I lost sight of science. Now. say what you've got to say and throw me out. Dr. Gottlieb! Martin. what's happened? - Dr. Gottlieb. - He's had a stroke. This is most unfortunate. I mean. coming at a time like this. He's gone down into the darkness believing in you. Martin. He never understood a word I said. Not a word. No. no. of course. He couldn't have. But you really must pull yourself together. you know. We've got to get through with this luncheon. in spite of Dr. Gottlieb's regrettable collapse. But before we go in. I want to tell you that from now on. you're department head. with 15.000 a year. I guess that ought to buck you up. How are you. Martin? You didn't expect to see me. did you? I know all you've been through. If my friendship has any meaning for you. will you take that? For all it's worth. Martin. I'm taking him away now. where he can be looked after. But I want to tell you what I'm going to do then. I'm going to clear out of this swell joint with all its swell equipment and publicity. I'm going to build my own lab in the Vermont woods. and I'm going to work. and do nothing but work. And I wouldn't wonder if you'd want to do it with me. because he counted on you to carry on after him. If you want me. you'll know where to find me. We are ready. Martin. Joyce. my dear. Thank you. But will you try and think kindly of me. even if you never see me again? I see. Martin. M a o o a o oa Ready. are you? Well. so am I. It's all right. it's just a few things I want to take along with me. Notes. notes. where are those notes? - But. my dear Martin! - Now. what else? Yes. Why... what in heaven's name are you going to do with... Just an old friend. Did well enough by me before I came. it'll do well enough by me after I'm gone. - Gone? - I can't stay for that luncheon after all. Surely the Institute deserves better of you than this. It certainly does. You know what old Gottlieb used to say? That the man who couldn't make his own lab out of a few toothpicks and a bit of string had better buy his ideas along with his fine equipment. - Martin. what are you thinking of? - The rest of my life. So long. Tubbs. Hey. Terry. hold your horses! Terry. wait! I'm coming with you! Lee and I. we're both coming with you! Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Moonyeen, Moonyeen. If only I could be with you. If only I knew the way to you. John, John.. My dearest one. I'm always with you. I'm here whenever you need me. Why must I go through this any longer? Be patient, dear heart. Someday, we'll be together again. These years have really only been but a few moments. And the years we must still wait will be just as short. Try to hear me, darling. Sometimes you do. Moonyeen, Moonyeen. 'Sir John, Sir John.' I might have known you were here. Confound you, Ellen. You frighten everybody away. Now, look here, Sir John. I've told you time and again no good will come of you wanting to talk with her who's gone these 30 years. No good? It's the only thing that keeps me alive. 'Uh, hello, come in.' Beg pardon, Sir John. Dr. Owen. - Hello, John. - Owen. - Well.. - So, you're back. Well, that's the general impression. Well, well, how do you find Ireland? Oh, great fishing, best in years. Oh, I missed you, John. You should have come. Change would have done you good. - I don't need no change. - That's where you're wrong. - What? - Well.. You know what people are beginning to say, hmm? Mmm, I know. They think I'm a bit touched, eh? Well, it's this confounded living in the past and trying to conjure up ghosts, you know. It's not doing you any good. Still we won't talk about that now. That's where you are wrong, Owen. In the first place, I shall live the kind of life I want to live. Of course, John. Heaven knows I'm not interfering. - I know better than that. - And now, will you listen? And in the second place, I get a great deal of comfort out of what you call conjuring up ghosts. You see, I happen to believe that there are times when Moonyeen is very close to me. And I shall continue to believe so. Whatever people may think or say. John, old fellow, I said let's not talk about it. - Mind if I take a pew, hmm? - Sorry, sit down, sit down. - Have a drink? - Of course, I'll have a drink. 'Good.' Ah, well, here we are. - John. - 'Mm-hmm.' Moonyeen's sister is dead. No. She and her husband were drowned a few days ago. A squall struck their boat off Dublin Bay. - That's horrible. - Yes. And that little mite of theirs is left practically unprovided for. Yes, yes, I remember. There was a child. Yes, a little girl. She's a, she's a lovable little tot. They're, uh, they're talking of putting her into an orphanage. - What? Impossible. - That's what I thought. - Yeah. - So, you see, I.. Now, John. Uh, don't bite my head off but.. What would you say to having her here? - Here? A child in this house? - Yeah. Oh, don't be ridiculous. No, count on me for any amount... A child is what's needed in this house. Give you something to think about besides yourself. - Out of the question. - But, John, if you... - No, no, no, no, no. - You see what I... Owen, please, let's.. Let's drop the subject if you don't mind. John, I don't think I realize until tonight how much these years have changed you. - Oh! - Your grief's become a habit. You've grown selfish, morbid. You'll be good enough not to interfere in my affairs. You've huddled in your burrow so long, you've grown to hate life. - I shall do as I... - Goodnight. Goodnight. I'll do as I please. Huh, ridiculous nonsense. I'll manage my own life. Nobody's gonna dictate me. Found.. What the.. Well, what do you want? Here, now come here, come here, come.. - I don't think I like you. - Well.. Oh, indeed. I resent that. - Why not? - You're so grumpy. I shall tell my daddy. Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. I had no intention of being disrespectful, I assure you. Well, uh, won't-won't you shake hands? We haven't been introduced. No, we haven't, have we? Well, wh-what's your name? Kathleen. What's yours? Mine is John. How do you do? - How do you do? - How old are you, Kathleen? I'm five in June. How old are you? Me? Well, I, uh, I'm a little older than that. Well.. Hey, v-very pretty. This is a new frock. Very becoming. And I've got on my best panties with a little tuck. Yes, uh, charming, charming, uh, uh.. W-won't you sit down, Kathleen? Would you, uh.. Would you like-like to see some pretty pictures? No. No, thank you. You wouldn't, eh? Must have had a rough crossing? - Yes, thank you. - Hmm. I, uh.. Uh, would you care for some... milk or something? No. No, thank you. Uh, would you, uh, by any chance, uh.. like to make your home with me? - No. No, thank you. - Why not? - Don't you like me? - No. No, thank you. Oh! I-I think I better be going now. Well, w-won't you say goodbye? Goodbye. Uh.. 'Mr. Toastmaster, ladies and gentlemen' 'and Miss Sheridan.' It is my pleasure and my privilege on this auspicious occasion.. - Hear, hear. - I thank you. to offer my felicitations to as charming a lady as ever graced a bachelor's board. - Hear, hear. - 'Hooray!' Hooray! Hooray! I thank you, I thank you, thank you. Now, now to blow out the candles. Remember, you don't get your wish unless you blow 'em all out at once. Now, when I say three, Kathleen blows. 'Ready, one, two..' '...three.' How's that for blowing? 'Nothing wrong with those lungs.' Anything else you want me to blow out around here? - Now, well, what's the wish? - Yes, what is it? Come on... Now, please, gentlemen, don't rush me. I wish that you weren't so generous. You leave me nothing to wish for. And what's more, you're the nicest person in the world. And I love you tremendously. There, that was rather sweet of me, wasn't it? Yes, I think so. Even allowing for little exaggeration. Why do you look at me like that? Strange. Every year, you grow more like her. - It's almost uncanny. - Moonyeen Clare? - Hmm. - Oh, but she was beautiful. Yes, she was beautiful and charming. You are very like her, my dear. Thanks, darling. There, now look at that. You made me all weepy. I knew it, I knew it. I've that confounded thimble again. Ah-ha, the ring. Good Lord, a wedding. - Willie Ainley. - Oh, help. - 'Willie's not a bad fella.' - Willie is a dear. ""I say, you know, Kathleen, I'm frightfully gone on you. I'm not a bad sort of chap. I'm steady, I'm reliable."" Oh, come, you mustn't make fun of Willie. '""Oh, you could always rely on my being' 'just as I am now. I should never change.""' 'Look here, old girl. I can't talk the romantic stuff.' 'But I think you are simply ripping.' I am dripping, Willie. No, but look here, Kathleen, I've simply got to talk to you. It's my last chance. You know I'm going to camp tomorrow. Whatever induced you to drag me miles from home in a storm. But the paper said fine and it wasn't raining when we started. Well, what are you going to do? I can't think. There hasn't been a soul inside this house in nearly 50 years. There will be two of us inside within 50 seconds. Oh, my. Isn't that a candle? Wait a jiffy. Willie, do you mean to say that nobody's been in this house for 50 years? 'Uh-huh.' You know, Willie, there's some sort of mystery here. People don't go away and leave a house like this. 'Why didn't the maid tidy things up?' 'Put that chair on its legs, the nighties of the furniture?' 'Well, why worry about it?' 'People were afraid to come into this room.' Something had happened here, something.. Something strange and terrible. You have got an uncomfortable mind. They locked the doors and went away for ever. As though there were a curse on the house. I say, you know, you're giving me the creeps. - Willie! - Oh, good heavens. - What is it now? - A wedding invitation. ""Mr. and Mrs. Richard Clare of Castle Clare, Wicklow ""request the pleasure of the company of Jeremy Wayne... "" ""Jeremy Wayne, on the occasion of the marriage of their daughter, Moonyeen with Sir John Carteret."" By Jove, Sir John. Moonyeen Clare, my mother's sister. But they never were married. She died that year. It was the tragedy of Uncle John's life. Strange. Do you suppose it could be linked in some way with this house? With this man? - Beats me. - Look at this. When Jeremy Wayne got it, he crushed it in his hand and threw it away. Why would he do that? Probably he was blotto. He's emptied half the decanter. Don't be an ass, Willie. It's as clear as day. 'Jeremy Wayne. He loved her too.' I know what happened in this room. - He killed himself. - What? That's why they closed the doors and left things as they were. He couldn't face life without her. They found him here. 'Just a log.' Don't you think perhaps we'd better get out of here? Shh. A carriage. Do you suppose it's a real carriage? Shh. - How do you do? - How do you do? How do you do? - Uh, ghastly weather, isn't it? - Ghastly. - Ghastly. - Yeah, ghastly. You were caught in the storm, I suppose. Yes. Yes. Yes. Pardon me if I'm inquisitive but are you, uh, are you stopping here? Oh, dear, no. No, I-it was raining very heavily. We were standing under a tree and the lightning hit the next tree and, uh, a-and killed two cows. Cows? What cows? Yes, two cows. No, three. Yeah, I saw the bodies. Oh, so then we broke in to get out of the storm. Yeah, we were, we were all wet. Oh, yeah? I wish the place were more comfortable for you. Oh, I am glad you were able to make the fire. Yeah, uh, thank you, thank you, I can do that. Oh, thank you. Oh, I'm afraid you've got a cold. Yeah, I wish I could offer you something warm. Excuse me. You mind if I take this for a moment? - Well, really... - I, uh, I shan't be long. - Who on earth is he? - I've a pretty good idea. - Well.. - Watch him. Did you see the way he looked at that silver? Oh, don't be silly. - 'Oh, boy.' - Shh! Got something under his arm. The very thing for you. Old port. Look. That's the best I could find. A-any old port in the storm. Perhaps, we should introduce ourselves. - My name's Ainley. - Oh, I'm pleased to meet you. Well, you surely don't intend to open that. - Do you? - I'm going to do my best. But, uh, really, you know, it isn't your property. That's a nice point, but I'll take it up later. Do you realize that stuff's worth three or four pounds a bottle? Ah, it ought to be pretty good. Well, are you going to sit there and be a p-party to this? - I thought of doing just that. - There we are. Oh, you mind? - Thank you. - Not at all, not at all. Oh, just a very little. That's enough. When! Fellow criminal. - Won't you join us? - Certainly not. Oh! How, uh, how about a toast? - I know one. - Yeah? Here's to your health, your honor and the health of all your descendants, great and small. That's a mighty handsome toast. It's an Irish toast, the best I know. Now, you keep as young and as pretty as you are until doomsday. And never forget the man who wished it. I wonder now as I look at you, have we never met before? No, I guess we haven't. I shouldn't have forgotten. Could you be Irish too? Yeah, I could if I saw enough of you. Well, if you're not Irish, you're American. - How do you know that? - Oh! - By the way you said ghastly. - Now, how should I say it? Well, if you mean how do I say it, ghastly. - Ghastly. - No, just ghastly. - Ghastly. - Ghastly. - Ghastly? No? - No, no, like this. - No? - No. Afraid not. Oh, never mind. We, we won't worry about it. Ridiculous. Mm, what I've been missing all these years not ever drinking uncle's port. Mm-hmm. I think you're making a mistake, Willie. I don't think I am. Oh, uh, sit down, old boy. Sit down, please. Tell me, what are you doing in England? - I came over to join up. - But it's not your war. Well, I'm half English, and a scrap's a scrap. I like that. Do you know this is scandalous of us? - But I don't think he'd mind. - Who? Why, the owner, Jeremy Wayne. - Isn't he a romantic figure? - Yeah, grand. I love that devil-take-you look. Do you know you don't look unlike.. - That's my father. - Your father? 'Cause I'm Kenneth Wayne. Well, this is romance. You're telling me.. - Why, hello. - Hello, Mr. Wayne. - Isn't this nice? - Eh, great, great. Gosh, I-I just happened to be taking a bicycle ride around the country. All alone? How too bad. 'Oh, yeah, just all alone, you know.' Oh, you see, I always take an extra bicycle with me in case anything happens. Why, of course, how stupid of me. Yeah, I might possibly run into some man who, uh wants to take a ride with me. Or some lady? You, uh, you know any ladies who like to ride bicycles? I couldn't possibly interest you in a horse, could I? Oh, I have lots of them in my stable. - Oh, is this where you live? - Mm-hmm. Oh, what a coincidence that I should just happen to be sitting on your wall. A charming coincidence. Gee, it's a shame that you live there, you know? I mean you, uh, you seem so human. I hope you're not going to run away from me because of where I live. I thought you Americans were democratic. Well, it's sort of a shock to, uh find out that Cinderella is really a princess. But I turn back into a pumpkin at midnight. Well, I wasn't sure that it was your house. I mean when I saw you in it, I, uh, still had hopes that you might just have been visiting. In it? When did you see me in it? Oh, last night. You watched me from the outside last night? Well, just till you went to bed. I-I mean, till you went upstairs. Well, I'll be darned. A window peeper. Oh, no, I wasn't peeping. No, I was just looking. See, there's not much to do around here nights and, uh I sort of wanted to see where you live, you know? - Oh! - Oh, well, anyway. I might have known it wouldn't work out. So you wanted to see where I live, mm? - Yeah. - What do you mean not work out? Well, a princess wouldn't wanna go bicycle riding. No? But Cinderella might. H-here, wait, let, wait, let me help you. I haven't ridden in years. Here, oh! Window peeper. - Some more tea? - Mm-mm. It's mighty good tea. - Not as good as I can make. - No? - I make very good coffee too. - Mm. Can you sew on buttons? Mm-hmm. Darn socks and I-I'm very nice with children. You know, you-you'll make somebody a good wife. Thank you, sir. That I will, sir. - Uh.. - What? Oh, I suppose I'll have to go home and get dressed for dinner. Oh, no, not yet. Well, we-we've just come here. We've been here for three hours. - Oh, no. - It has been fun, hasn't it? Oh, it's been swell. I never knew that bicycling could be so enjoyable. Oh, yes, there's nothing like a good bicycle. You know, it's a little like that old song ""A Bicycle Built For Two."" - I don't know it. - Well, neither do I. I mean, it's-it's sort of a song. I see, about-about a bicycle built for two? Yes. Yeah. Gee, you're a great girl. Well, uh, have some more tea, hm? What's doing that? France. - Guns. - Mm-hmm. Gee! Alright, alright, alright, don't get impatient. I'll be over there in a month. - A month? - Mm. Oh! Is there anything else I can get you? Oh, no, thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Crouch. It was lovely. - A month. - Well, just about. Mm-hmm. Oh, Mrs. Crouch, uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to stay for dinner. - Dinner, sir? - Mm-hmm. Oh, I don't serve dinner, sir. Oh, well, it, uh, it, uh looks too much like rain to risk going out. You see, Miss Sheridan here had an aunt who-who caught cold in a rainstorm once and-and almost died. - Oh, that's too bad. - Mm-hmm. But it isn't going to rain, sir. Oh, but you can never can tell. Please, Mrs. Crouch, just something easy. Or we can cook it ourselves. Just some chops and maybe a steak. Have you, have you got any ale? And how about a little salad, huh? I don't know. 'Cause I think love is.. Do you know what love is? What? Well, of course, there's.. There's different kinds of love. I know but... we were talking about.. real love. Yeah. Real love.. lasts forever. - Yes, I know but... - There are no buts. 'I know what I'm talking about.' 'Love is..' 'Love is something you feel. It just happens.' 'You can't do anything about it.' 'If I love somebody... I'd love him forever.' To Major Owen, RAMC. Well, I never saw the child drink port before. - In your honor, sir. - Oh, thank you, my dear. A soldier, a gentleman, but a miserable chess player. Absolutely untrue, isn't it, Kathy? - What vintage is this? - Huh? Uh, Coburn's '96, if it really interests you. '96, hmm, not bad for new wine. - Pardon? - Not bad, eh? Oh, listen to the girl. Coburn's '96, not bad. I don't mean it's not good but it doesn't compare with the '47. Hmm, '47? What do you know about the '47? Well, I had a glass of it the other day. - Oh, you did, eh? - Mm-hmm. - Who gave it to you? - A man I met with Willie. - Aha! What man? - Yes, come on, Kathleen. I'd like to know a man with a bit of '47. Could we meet him? - Oh, yes, I suppose so. - Come on, out with it. Well, Willie and I went into an old house to get out of the storm the other day. - Whose house? - Um, just a big, empty house. Oh! I smell a story in this. Well, there's no sense of making a mystery of it. - It was the old Wayne house. - Wayne house. You know that old, deserted house back of the maid's new road. Not a soul been in it for 50 years. And then quite unexpectedly, in walks the owner from America. What? He's back. Jeremy Wayne. Oh, no, Uncle John. Not Jeremy Wayne. Jeremy Wayne is dead. This is his son. He came to join up. Dead? - Uncle John! - 'John! John!' Owen, what is it? What did this Jeremy Wayne do? - I can't tell you. - But in heaven's name, I... That's his wish, Kathleen. You must forget it. Forget it? How can I, Owen? You must tell me. - No, I can't. - Then I must ask him. Oh, no. You must not, please. You don't know how it would hurt him. - I know... - Oh, don't insist, my dear. It's better so. Believe me. Won't you come in, dear? I'm sorry I said anything that hurt you. Kathleen, this young man, this Wayne. He's in the army, you say? Yes, he's in Camp It's just half an hour from here. Oh, but let's not talk about him, dear. I should prefer that you don't ever see him again. Uncle John? Why mustn't I see him again? He's really awfully nice. I think you'd like him. We've become rather good friends. - Friends? - Yes, and I'm sure... Be silent! You sicken me. When did you meet this man? - A week ago, almost. - Have you seen him since? - Yes. - 'How often?' - Why, quite often. - Kathleen? You must promise me never to see him again. I can't promise. I want to see him. - Why shouldn't I? - Are you in love with him? Are you? Answer me? I don't know, I.. If I am in love with him.. I don't know, he's not in love with me anyway. At least, we've never said anything. I only know I can't bear the thought of not seeing him again. I'm sorry, Uncle John, I can't help it, I.. I just can't. Listen, my child. I'm going to tell you something you should have known long ago. It's been my fault, I suppose. But I hoped I never would have to tell you. I hoped I never would have to live it all over again. It's almost 50 years ago. I can see it as if it were yesterday. This garden, a June night.. the same scent of roses on the air. Excitement. People coming and going. Little lanterns among the trees. And from the ballroom, the sound of an orchestra. It was the night before our wedding. I remember it so well. The house was filled with people. - Sweetheart. - Oh, ho ho. - This is our dance, isn't it? - Is it? I forgot. Of course, it is. Come on. Oh, where on earth have you been? Yes, what kind of a best friend are you, eh? Uh, John, you don't deserve this. I'm sorry, old man, but you don't. I know it, I know it, but it's too late now. - Crazy! Absolutely crazy! - Well... Hasn't said a sensible thing all evening, Owen. Can we blame him, hmm? To tell you the truth, I'm not making much sense myself. I've never been so happy. - You had a drink yet, Owen? - Oh, yes. I stopped for a quick one at the Georgian Dragon. - Oh, you did, eh? - Well, no, no more, John. - Go on. - Oh, no, well.. Oh, by the way, uh, Jeremy Wayne was there. Oh, why didn't you bring him along? Well, he was in pretty bad shape, John. Drinking more than was good for him. Yeah, he takes it pretty hard, doesn't he? Poor devil. Well, I can't say I blame him either. You know, Wayne's a wild sort of fellow, John. I'm a bit worried about him. He was making vague sort of threats against you. Yeah, you know what that is? That's-that's that Georgian Dragon brandy. Pretty dangerous stuff. Do you remember the night when you wanted to marry the barmaid? After just two glasses of it. Oh, we have had some good times, haven't we? Haven't we? Oh, my God. And don't you think they-they're gonna end either, you blithering idiot. Not, but, um, seriously, John... Now, drink it. Go on, drink it. Alright. I want to get back to Moonyeen. I can't bear to let that girl out of my sight for more than a minute or two. Ssh! Listen! * There's a little brown road winding over the hill * Uh, j-just look at that now. * To a little white cot by the sea * * There's a little green gate * * At whose turnings I wait * * While two eyes of blue * * Come smiling through * * At me * * There's a gray lock or two * * In the brown of her hair * * There's some silver in mine too * * I see * * But in all * * The long years * * When the clouds brought their tears * * Those two eyes of blue * * Kept smiling through * * At me ** I promised him I'd tell you he was here, Miss Moonyeen. But I wouldn't see him, miss. Not if I was you. Quite right, Mary, you go back into the house. But I don't think he's quite himself, miss. - I'll tell Sir John. - No, no, Mary. You mustn't. Oh, Jerry, I knew you couldn't let me get married without coming to wish me joy. What's the matter, Jerry? What is it? - You know what it is. - Come in, we're expecting you. - Oh, no, you're not. - Please, Jerry. Don't act like this on the night before my wedding. You don't need to remind me what night it is. Jerry, dear, we're not going to go all over that again, are we? As though I weren't tortured enough. As though you weren't driving me mad. That's not quite fair, is it? You look so beautiful in that dress. Thanks, Jerry. I had an awful time getting it to fit. I was so afraid it was going to be an utter failure. Oh, Moonyeen, Moonyeen. Oh, Jerry. Please, don't. Haven't you any pity for a man in hell? Oh, Jerry, dear, you mustn't. Get up. You're not going to marry him. All my life, I've loved you. Jerry, it isn't easy for me either to have you say things like this. I'm so fond of you. It was understood between our families that we were to marry. It was understood by everyone. Yes, but, Jerry, this needn't mean the end of our friendship. Nothing should end that. After all, girlhood and boyhood sweethearts don't always marry. Hmm, girlhood and boyhood sweethearts. You were such a cunning, little boy. And you were such a beautiful, little girl. Now, we mustn't ever let anything spoil that. Don't you see what I mean, dear? Tomorrow you'll be in his arms. This man you're marrying what right has he to take you from me? Why is he better than I? What is there in me that's wrong? Nothing, Jerry, nothing. Is it because I drink? I drink because I'm unhappy. And I'm unhappy because of you. This other man, he has no faults, he's perfect. But I tell you, he shall not have you. The man doesn't live who can take you from me. The man will not live who takes you from me... Jerry! I'm marrying John tomorrow. I'm marrying him because I love him. I loved him from the moment I saw him. I shall always love him, because he stands for everything that's beautiful, and fine, and true. And even if he didn't, I should still love him. Mmm! Moonyeen. Ah, good evening, madam. If you're not busy tomorrow afternoon how do you like to marry me? What's the matter, dear? Is something wrong? - No, nothing. - Something I've done? Something I've said? 'Cause if it is, I-I didn't mean it. No, John, dear. Hold me close. - Anything about the wedding? - No. You're not unhappy, are you? How could I possibly be unhappy tonight? - You're a funny little thing. - Am I? - 'Moonyeen!' - 'John!' 'Where are they?' Shh! Don't let's answer them. Well.. You know sometimes, I-I get a little scared. How on earth did we two ever happen to get together? I know, to think that out of all the millions of people in the world. Can you imagine what fun it's going to be in this house? - Oh, darling. - Just you and I. Everything's fun. I'm so excited about going to Paris. - Are you, dear? - Mm-hmm. You know I know a marvelous restaurant in the Rue Vavin. - You do? - Yes, you wait. Oh, God, what's the use of going to Paris? Hmm, what's the use of doing anything? Except sitting here the rest of our lives. Except the food's awfully good in Paris. It's gonna be a beautiful honeymoon.. spent in a restaurant. Mm, darling. - Like my ring? - It's a beauty, isn't it? Belonged to my great-great-grandmother. - Really? - Mm-hm. I say, let's practice, shall we? With this ring, I thee wed. This was pretty good, wasn't it, huh? Alright, maybe I better practice dropping it once or twice, huh? Look, there-there's really nothing to this getting married. You see how easy it is? I-I can do it with my eyes shut. With this ring... I thee wed. - You know, this is fun. - What on earth are you doing? It's fun opening my eyes and seeing you. Wouldn't it be marvelous if every time I open my eyes for the rest of my life, you-you were there? I will be. And always as beautiful as you are tonight. Well, after I get the ring on, what happens next? - Mm? - You kiss me. Oh! That-that's going to be very difficult. - Hello, dearest. - Hello, my sweet. Tonight is the last time we ever have to say goodbye. - Isn't it? - Yes. Never any more partings. - No more separate plans? - No. No different thoughts. Just we two... made one. - Forever. - And forever. Amen. - 'Moonyeen.' - 'John.' 'Moonyeen! Where the heck is she?' Will thou have this man to thy wedded husband to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? Will thou obey him and serve him love, honor and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him 'so long as you both shall live?' I will. - Wayne! - Jerry! - 'At my wedding.' - There will be no wedding. Be silent, sir. Are you mad, Wayne? Get out of here! You took her away from me. But, by heaven, you'll never have her. No, Jerry, no! After him! He went this way. Come on. Go on. Catch him fast. He's probably around the lake. Come on. Moonyeen. But surely you can do something? You must do something. - John? - Yes, dear. It hurts. Make it stop. Are you alright? Yes, dear, of course. Am I? Is it.. It's nothing, darling. Owen will help you. John.. Darling.. Wear.. the ring. Dear? Dear, don't be sad. Our love could never die. - John, where are you? - I'm here, my love. Darling... don't leave me. Don't leave me. John.. isn't it a pity? For me too, it was the end. She lay white and still in my arms. She was dead. All that I lived for was gone. It was the end. I came back alone to this house. All gay with flowers for her. I sat alone where I sit now the whole night through. Poor darling. I've sat here many times since. Whenever I'm in trouble or sorrow, I come here. For it's here that she returns to me. Year after year, she has come. Always when I needed her she was beside me, she was here in this garden. I know, dear, I understand. Kathleen, tonight you told me that Jeremy Wayne was dead. - I'm sorry I didn't kill him. - Uncle John. After the police had given up the search I tracked him for years through half the ports of South America. For years, I hunted him in my dreams. I killed him in my dreams. Now, he is dead. And his son.. His son! But Kenneth never knew his father. He was a baby when he died. But, Kathleen, listen.. you must promise me to have nothing more to do with the son of that man. You mean, it's.. - It's never. - Never. Kathleen? Yeah, I promise. - Uh, good evening. - Good evening. - Is, uh, Miss Sheridan home? - No, sir, she's out. You told her I called Wednesday? - Oh, yes, sir. - And, uh, and Friday? She was sorry to miss you, sir. Oh, is she? Well, uh, I guess I'll wait. - But really, sir... - I'll-I'll wait. He won't go. What's the matter with you, Ellen? I didn't want to interrupt you, sir. - It's for Miss Kathleen, sir. - Oh, uh.. It's the man from the canteen, miss. He's here again. Man from the canteen? What's he doing here at this hour of the night? I better go and see what he wants, dear. I won't be a minute. Very peculiar. - Hello, Ken. - Why wouldn't you see me? - I can't tell you here. - 'Ellen! Ellen!' - Who's that? - That's my uncle. He mustn't know you've come. Why not? What's wrong? What's it all about? We can't talk here, Ken. I guess I shouldn't have come. Oh, please, don't think that. We'll get away from the house. Yeah, I suppose he's right. Certainly is great to find out that your father did a thing like that. I'm sorry, but... I had to tell you. Oh, sure, it's, uh.. Well.. Well.. There's...there's really nothing else we can do, is it? No, I guess the whole thing was cockeyed anyway with me going to the front so soon. Besides, we...we hardly know each other, do we? No, this, uh.. poor-boy-rich-girl thing's usually a bust anyway. Yes, I guess we were just as lucky to stop it now. - Weren't we? - Yeah. It's a pretty close shave though, we.. We might really have a, got a.. Yes. Well, it was nice to have known you, miss. - If you're ever in Cleveland.. - Cleveland.. That sounds so awfully far away. Uh, I promised. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - We don't seem to be.. - Oh, we don't, do we? - If we are in love? - Oh, we can't be that, can we? We mustn't see each other though. - Or must we? - That wouldn't be right. Except that as long as I'm going to France... But wouldn't it be easier if we didn't... - I don't know if it would... - We can't just.. - We aren't children, are we? - Oh, that's right, we.. We've got to use our heads, but.. - 'Well..' - Hm? What? This is a douche of a game with you going to sleep after every move. I wasn't asleep. Even if I were, I could beat you. By the way, where does Kathleen keep herself these days? Oh, heaven knows. Why? Well, haven't seen much of her lately. Nobody has. Canteen keeps her pretty busy. - I see. - 'Hmm.' The canteen. Worse than ever today. Those guns must be over 100 miles away. And still they go out in thousands to fill the gaps. I thought I'd never get away today. - Same here. - Am I very late? - Only a minute. - A minute's a year. - Hello, darling. - Hello, you. Sweet.. Glad to see me? - Now, what do you think? - I don't know. Oh! Good heavens. Look at that spread. Those big sticky buns. I've already had one tea. Oh, well, pretend to eat, darling or you'll break her heart. Oh, good afternoon, Mrs. Crouch. Good day, miss, I'm bringing the tea, fresh made. Ah, sinkers. They're not sinkers, sir. They're donuts. - Oh, yeah. - There. Now, I've just got to get the scones. - Scones? - They're in the oven. Well, now let me see. What may I help you to? A radish? A sinker? Uh, neither, if you please. - Yeah, uh, neither. - If you please. Yeah, if you please. Well, how about a cookie? You pick me out a nice, slender one, please. - How about that one? - Ah, thank you. - Darling. - Darling. Hey, Kathleen.. - Kathleen.. - What is it, Ken? We're, uh.. We're pushing off. When, dear? - Tonight. - 'Here we are.' And piping hot, and they're good. Though I said it, I shouldn't. I'm sure they are. Thank you, Mrs. Crouch. My mother taught me to bake. My word, she was a one to bake. And her dumplings, oh! You just put your fork into them and they went, pfft! Eh? Well, I dare say you'll be wanting to be alone. If there's anything at all you want, just call me, will you? Yes, thank you. Ken, how can they? You're not half-trained. I know, I guess they need more men. Yes, but.. so soon. Well, I'll get leave, you know, darling. Of course. - Well, uh.. - Let's be nonchalant, shall we? Naturally. - Allow me. - Many thanks. No use. I feel like one of Mrs. Thingummy's dumplings. I've-I've gone pfft! Kath, sweet. Oh, dear, no. Oh, no, darling, don't. Please. I'll be back, you know. Ken, just how long have you? We've got to make Dover tonight. We have a day's leave there and then, we're off to France the next morning. Couldn't you get leave now until the time to leave from Dover? Well, only if.. only for something extra special. Take me to Dover with you... tonight. Have you thought, darling? It's only a few hours. Then I'll leave you... and I may not come back. But we shall have had those hours, dear. It will help me to wait. And if it's all we ever have.. it will help me to live. I shall have been...your wife. My wife. Darling. I love you. Darling. Uh, Ken, go back to camp. Get leave to join the draft at the boat. Tell them you're gonna be married. I'll throw some things in a bag, then you come call me. Yeah, sure. I'll be with you half an hour. Sweet. Oh, what-what about your uncle? What will you tell him? I'll tell him the truth. - I must now. - He'll never consent. Whatever happens, darling, I'll be waiting. Pray for me. Mrs. Crouch. - Uncle John? - Uh-huh, what, darling? There's something I must tell you. What is it, my dear? I've broken my promise to you. What-what promise? I've been seeing Kenneth Wayne. We love each other. We're to be married. - Married. - I meant to keep my word. I tried. I really tried. He called several times, and I refused to see him. Then when I did see him at last, it was.. it was only to explain. I should never have promised, Uncle John. I loved him from the first. He's splendid and fine. Won't you try to forget what his father did? Won't you meet him, just for my sake? He's going to the front. We've only tomorrow.. We're to be married before he leaves. I'd sooner see you dead. Excuse me, Sir John. - Miss Kathleen? - Ask him to wait, Ellen. No, bring him in here. - Uncle John, please... - Bring him in here. 'This way, sir.' Good evening, sir. I'm Kenneth Wayne. My uncle wanted to see you. It's, uh, it's alright? I'm ready to go with you. I hope you understand, sir. I understand only one thing about a Wayne. What's that? The quality of your breed is not to take its medicine. That's why your father took the life of one person and ruined that of another. He couldn't take his medicine. I don't think you have any right to put it like that. Kenneth, I'm going with you just as I promised. If she marries you, if she becomes your wife just as you're leaving, and you never come back you'll have smashed into her life for a few futile, cowardly hours because I shall never forgive any part of it. I'm coming back, and I'm going to make her happy. It's the only thing in the world I want to do. You ought to forget and forgive, and try to help us. When I forget, it will be because I'll be dead. 'If he takes you from me, then he can take care of you.' That's my last word, Kathleen. I shall not change it. Come on, let's get out of here. We can get the next train and be in town in time for dinner. We mustn't wait a second, dear. - We have so little time. - Kathleen, we can't do it. I'd be an utter cad. I've nothing but my shilling a day. Oh, we can talk about that in Dover. You're not coming to Dover. He meant what he said. He wouldn't take you back, and day after tomorrow, you're... I don't care what happens day after tomorrow anymore than I care what happened 50 years ago. - Oh, darling, I love you so. - Is that all? All? - Don't you want me too? - Oh! I want you. I'm not ashamed to say it. I'm yours, you're mine. I want that to be true before you go. D-darling, I-I can't. I'd have no piece of mind. Oh, Ken, don't send me away. We may never be together again. We will regret all our life that we wasted these last hours. I can't, Kathleen. It wouldn't be fair. - Oh, Ken, if you love me... - Kathleen. - Would you listen to me? - No! I won't listen. I won't. I won't. But, dear, please be reasonable. Gee, this is our last half hour and we've wasted in an argument. I can't take you from comfort and security and leave you with nothing. I can't do it. Oh, well, I can't force you to take me. You haven't convinced me at all. But of course, if you, you don't want me? Oh! Oh, darling. Darling, uh.. - Ken. - Hmm. You're right. I've known it all the time. - I've been an awful prune. - Oh, no, darling. - No, you haven't. - Yes, I have. You're far from a prune. By the time I get through with you you won't be fit to fight anyone. You're telling me? That is sweet. Come on, darling, I've got to get going. The train leaves at ten after. Uh, no, dear, at twenty after. After. After. Will you, uh, will you see me to the station, hmm? I don't think I could, dear. All those people, I.. I know I'd disgrace you. Oh! Better say goodbye.. now. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Oh, Ken, I can't let you go. I can't. Oh, darling, you're not gonna start this all over again? No, dear, I love you, I can't help it... But, darling, it's the war. And I'm in it. Then why can't you take me with you? If I don't go, I'll get court-martialed. - Oh, I don't care if you're... - Oh, for the love of my.. I'm afraid she isn't coming back, John. She couldn't do that to me. I don't believe.. 'Kathleen.' Kathleen. Well.. Because of your threat.. he wouldn't marry me. He's gone now. He may never come back. If God's just, he never will. John! John, what devil has got into you? Go after her. Beg her to forgive you if she ever can? - I haven't asked your advice. - I'm giving it. That boy you wished dead is a fine chap. I met him several times at the depot. One of the best. So, after all we've been through together.. you're on his side too. I'm on Kathleen's side and I say you're wrong. You're doing a wicked thing. And one day, you'll bitterly regret it. Just a moment, Owen. You say I'm doing a wicked thing because I can't take the son of her murderer to my heart? Well, I can't. I may be all you say but at least I'm loyal to her which is the best I know and I shall continue to be so till the end. And who pays the price of your loyalty? You must think of the living as well as the dead... You've said enough, Owen. You're willing to sacrifice every decent human sentiment to a bitter memory that should be forgotten. Owen, if you can say that.. If that's how you feel.. I don't think you and I can go on as we have done. Do...you mean that, John? I never meant anything so much. It's...it's been a great many years, John. I've said my last word. Moonyeen. Moonyeen? Where are you? 'John, I can't get through to you.' 'Your hate is standing between us.' I need you, Moonyeen. You must come. If I could only reach you, dear. If I could only make you understand that they love each other.. as we did long ago. He may never come back to her, John. If you build a barrier between those who love.. you'll stand between your soul and mine.. for all eternity. Beloved? Beloved, can't you hear me? Unless you drive this hatred out of your heart unless you right this wrong.. why, you can never come to me. Never! Never...never. Why have you deserted me? Will it never stop? - I can't bear it! - Kathleen! I'm sorry. Ken! Oh, Ken! Oh, Willie! - Hello, Kath. - Hello. I thought, perhaps, you might be looking for me. My mistake, Kathleen. I'm so glad to see you, Willie! Don't you look well? Oh, please forgive me for not answering your last letter! Or the one before that? You're a fine one. You are. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, that's alright, Kath. I really didn't expect you to. Well, I suppose I'd better be barging along. All the luck in the world, Kath. Thank you, Willie. I'll see you again sometime. See ya. 'Fall in, men! Stay-stay calm!' - I've six cases tonight, sir. - Very good. 'Alright.' That's it. Oh, there...careful. That's it. - 'Orderly!' - Sir? Careful, now. Careful. Take your time. Alrighty. So sorry, boys. Here we are, sir. Take it easy. I'll fetch you a cab or something. Oh! 'That's all of it, I think.' 'Wayne!' Kenneth Wayne! Who is it? Oh! Oh, hello-hello, doctor. Well, it is.. It's good to see you again. Nice to have you back. Splendid! Listen doctor, will you do me a favor? Will you, for heaven's sake, look at my legs and stop being so nice about them? Of course! You're, uh.. You're coming up to the hospital! Oh, no! No. I'm discharged. - Splendid! - Yeah. Then you can stay with me. I know of someone who's waiting. I'm sailing for America tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes, tomorrow. I just came down to...get some things from the old house. But Kathleen.. Do I look like a man who wants to see a girl? She, uh...she loves you, Ken. She loves me, does she? Well, what of it? She'll get over it, won't she? You want her to get over it? For heaven's sake, doctor, use your head. Yes, yes, yes! Let her get over it! You're a doctor. Give her pills! Love is a disease, isn't it? Cure it. Cut it out of her! I'm afraid, it is not easy. Alright, it is not easy. So what? Tell her I'm a dirty swine. Tell her I'm going back to America to marry a million dollars... tell her I got married to mademoiselle from Armentieres. Tell her anything. Oh, but it means so much to her, Ken. Why not just see her? Why not? Because I haven't got the.. Because I'm shot to pieces. Because I'm still in love with her, if you must know. And, now, will you, for the love of Judas, let me alone? Let me alone! Let me alone! Captain Wayne, sir! Captain Wayne. - Orderly! - Sir? 'Kenneth!' - Take it easy. - Now, up with him. - That's right. - Give me that. - That's it. - Steady, now, Ken. Gimme-gimme-gimme that foot. - Here you are. - There we are. Oh, you wait here, sir. I've got a carriage waiting. I'll get it. I'll-I'll-I'll walk to it. - Now, Wayne.. - Well? - Well, you see, doctor? - Yes, I see. Hey, now. I'm sorry, I...I blew up like that. Oh, please! Thanks, doctor. Goodbye. And...forget what I told you. Forget you saw me. We certainly had great luck with our girls, didn't we? 'Here we are, sir!' 'All that dust down there' 'is enough to choke ya.' I've packed up the few things you wanted, sir. - Anything else? - No, that's all. - Come on, let's get going. - Righto. Oh, beg your pardon, sir.. but just now, a most extraordinary thing happened. Yeah? I was down in the cellar.. and I accidentally ran into a.. a few bottles of very old port. Uh-uh, do we take it? - Well, what do you think? - We take it! Shan't be a minute. Pack it up. What time is the train? Ten five, sir. Then you better make it snappy. Snappy is the word, sir. Well, old man.. we've got an hour. Let's sit down and feel sorry for ourselves. Here's to your health, your honor and the health of all your descendants, great and small. That's a mighty handsome toast! It's an Irish toast, it's the best I know. Now, you keep as young and as pretty as you are...until doomsday. And never forget the man who wished it. 'Oh, Ken!' 'Ken!' 'Ken!' Kathleen, hello! Oh.. Oh, it is you. God! I can't believe it! Darling, I knew you'd come. I knew you'd come. Oh, sweet! It's-it's so wonderful to have you in my arms again. I-I-I waited so long. And darling, and how are you? How are you, dear, sweet, poor darling? Let me look at you. I wish I wasn't crying so much, I could see you properly. Oh, darling.. Uh-uh, sweetheart, are you glad to see me? - You haven't said so, you know? - Of course, I am. Oh, darling...of course you are. You know, I went down to the station, I didn't find you. I must have missed you, somehow or other. I was so frightened. Oh.. But here you are.. you are here and-and you're alive and that's all that matters, isn't it? How did you know I was here? I...I saw the light in the window, dear. I just took a chance, I ran up here all the way. My heart was pounding, I was so afraid I wouldn't find you. - So you ran all the way? - Yes, I ran all the way. I broke the record! Oh, uh, what do you say, we-we sit down? - Shall we? - Oh, darling. Oh! - O-o-over here, see? - Alright. When did you get in? Why didn't you let me know? Why haven't you written all these months? Oh, I lost your address, now.. Lost my address? I thought you'd lost an arm or something. You didn't-you didn't lose an arm, did you? No, I don't think so. - Lose anything else? - Huh? - Lose your heart? - Oh, hundreds of times. Liar, mine's still here, too. It's so excited, my heart. It's so happy. Darling, is your heart happy, too? Yeah, I-I don't see why not. It's been such a long, long way to Tipperary. - Such a long time to wait. - Yeah. But now there's no reason why you.. I mean, no reason why I.. why you and I.. Because you have come back to me, dear. You know, I sort of thought that maybe you wouldn't be here when I got back. That's a strange idea. Why not? Well, I don't know, everything else in the world's so changed I...I sort of thought maybe you.. might not still be so crazy about-about this place and.. Why, I love it here. You know that. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. Oh, Kenneth, what are you driving at? Want me to live somewhere else? You know I'd live anywhere in the world with you. But you.. - You like it here, eh? - Yes. Oh, that's fine. Dear, that's fine. Maybe-maybe I was right that day that I.. I made you go back to your uncle when you wanted to come with me. Well, maybe, but.. Oh, don't let's talk about those things now, dear. You're back...and that's all that matters. By the way, how, uh... how-how is your uncle? He hasn't changed about you, dear. - But neither have I. - Hasn't changed, eh? Still nursing that old sorrow of his? But we are not gonna let that make the least bit of difference, now, dear. See, it...must be great to be like that.. love one woman all your life. Why...yes, it must be. How's everything else been? How's, what's his name, Willie? Did Willie get back alright? Oh, that's good, that's good. You know, Willie-Willie might be just a type at that. Willie would love somebody.. all of his life. Ken, what are you talking about? - I-I'm just rambling along. - Well, will you stop? Just reminiscing. Gee, we had a lot of fun here, didn't we? Remember the day we met. Right in this room, wasn't it? - Yeah, a lot of fun. - Yeah. Gee, how badly we felt that afternoon I we found out I was shoving off for France? Oh boy, was that love or wasn't it? Kenneth? We certainly took it seriously that little affair of ours. To bad, we had to go to war and grow up. Kenneth, what are you saying? What are you trying.. What do you mean, ""Little affair of ours?"" - Ken, what's happened to you? - Well, I've-I've been to war! I know you've been to war and I've been waiting for you because I love you. And I thought you loved me. I thought you wanted me. I, uh.. I'm sailing for America.. tomorrow. What do you mean? Alone? Alone. But, Ken, I am...I'm ready to go with you, dear. Oh, you're joking. Don't joke, dear. Don't scare me... Alright, Kathleen, let's not-let's not.. When a thing's over, it's-it's over. Oh.. it's over. I see. It's over. Then why did you come here? Did you wanna make sure you didn't love me? Well...I hope you're sure now. I hope you'll forget all about our little affair. Forget that I loved you, that I waited for you that I would've waited for you always. Kathleen, I've-I've changed. Yes, that's right. That's certainly right. Four years and.. well, you change. Yes, of course. I know. Of course, you've changed. I'm sorry, Kenneth, I.. I didn't mean to throw myself at your head. I didn't mean to embarrass you like this. I've been quite stupid, haven't I? Taking it for granted that you'd still be.. Well I...guess there's not much more to say, is there.. except goodbye? Goodbye, Kenneth. 'Here we are, sir. Anything else?' Take it easy, sir. Steady now. Steady. Kenneth Wayne is just as welcome here now as he was four years ago. And no more. John, John, old friend, you can't do this. You're hitting a man, when he is down! You've got to tell her about him. I can't do it. I can't take the responsibility of sending her to him if you won't help. John...he's leaving in an hour! Let him go. Is that plain? Let him go. You've chosen to empty your life of everything, but hate. Well...I believe that same hate will be around you in the hereafter 'and the sweet soul of Moonyeen will never get through it.' 'I believe this, John, and I beg of you' I...I beg of you that you'll do something about it. Now, John...now! Kathleen.. Kathleen? Where have you been? Have you seen him... Kenneth Wayne? Have you? I'm not quite sure. I went up to his house. Do you think that was.. I'd give a great deal if I hadn't. Badly smashed up? No, not physically, but.. Oh, I don't know what to think. He doesn't seem the same to me. Seems to have forgotten that we were ever.. that we.. I don't know what to think. So he ended it, eh? Well, perhaps it's for the best. You'll get over it, my dear. You didn't. But it's not the same, is it? You knew that somebody loved you. You were sure of it. You had that memory. I have nothing. I thought I was sure of it. Now, I.. I have nothing. His train leaves at 10:00. Oh, I wish he were gone! I can't help hoping the maddest things. If a car were to drive up.. and if it was he.. come back to me.. that gate would have opened. He would have come into this room. But, you don't understand that, do you? Oh, yes, I understand. You know, it's the little things his laugh.. the crazy things he said and did. He was absolutely crazy, you know? Doesn't make sense. Absolutely crazy. She said that once about me. It's no use. I'll always love him. I'm just that sort of a fool. I have no pride. I'd love him, whatever he'd done however bad he'd treated me. And if he'd died.. I'd always have loved him.. all my life.. as you loved her. Kathleen.. My child.. Kathleen, listen. I better tell you this. He's wounded. You mean, Kenneth is wounded? Yes...badly. Wounded? Oh, no! Why didn't he tell me? He didn't think he had the right. Owen saw him at the station. Then that was why.. Oh, but doesn't he know I'd love him even if.. God, my poor darling! Then he does love me, he does love me! As if anything else mattered, anything else in the world! The train leaves at 10:00. Oh, is that clock right? I must catch him! Kathleen! I...I hope.. 'I-I-I should like it if..' Do you think you could possibly.. come back here again? And bring him with you? Oh! Oh! We'll both take care of him, won't we? Owen! Hello, Kathleen! - What is it? - Go to Uncle John, quickly! - Oh, hello. - Oh! Well.. Kathleen seemed to think you needed me. Anything wrong? Wrong? Uh, not with me! Where is Kathleen? She seemed in a hurry. She's gone down to the station. She seemed anxious to get there before the London train left. Oh! She'll be coming home? They'll be coming home. They? That's what I said. Oh! I see! Well.. Well, I'll be jogging along, hm? Uh-uh, would you, uh.. would you care to play a little chess? I mean, now that you are here. Oh, I don't mind if I do. Hmm.. Forgotten your chess, hm? Forgotten more than you ever knew. Ah! I wonder if she'll get there in time. We'll soon know. John.. I know of someone who would be glad of what you've done tonight. Yes. She is glad. I know. Oh, uh.. By the way.. have I apologized to you, Owen? Apologize? For what? - Right you are. - Mm-hmm. Almost too dark to see. 'Well..' I would like to play one game and have you keep awake till the end. Hm? Good old, John. John? John! - Moonyeen? - John! You've come back to me. No, darling. You've come to me. It's been so lonely without you. I've missed you so much. You know.. I almost made an awful mess of things. No. You must forgive me, dear, this time. I'm getting very old. Old, darling? Why, look. Oh! Why, then.. is this what they call, ""dying?"" - It's nothing, is it? - Nothing, dear! And everything. We're together now, forever. And forever. Come. Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, There's the 23rd marker, sir. Twenty-three miles in one hour and 14 minutes. Gentlemen, that is moving. Our engineer is trying to set a record on the first run. But I doubt if we can maintain this speed on our regular schedule. Why not? If this train can do it, the rest of them can. Providing Col. Dodge's new town is worth speeding to reach. Worth it? You wait and see. Now it's just the end of the line, but in a few years... it'll give your railroad more business than any town west of Chicago. I hope you're right, Colonel. You've stuck to that argument for five years. Why shouldn't I? I've raised that town from two hog pens and a buffalo waller. How big is it now, Colonel? Well, at the last census, gentlemen, they had three buffalo wallers. Look, there goes the stagecoach from Wichita. We'll be carrying the mail from now on. Listen to that snorting teapot. She's already winded. By Jove, we'll run her into the ground. Better put your whip to them. - Willie? - Yes, sir, boss? You go up and tell our engineer... if that stagecoach beats us to the end of the line, he's fired. Yes, sir. And if this train go any faster... I'm gonna get off and walk... 'cause I don't like this zest of the Lord. By George, he's making a good showing, you know it. - We'll get him. - We'd better get up some speed here. - There he goes. - We've got him. Gentlemen, that's a symbol of America's future: progress. Iron men and iron horses. You can't beat them. Lucky devils. Nothing to do, but eat and sleep. That's right, hardhead. The only difference between you and them is a pair of horns. Hush. Say, Wade, let's cut out a couple of them. No. We've killed our last buffalo, boys. The railroad's finished and so is our contract. Besides, we've a little appointment to keep, you know. Come on. Here comes our meal ticket for the last six months. So that's what a steam engine looks like: a coffeepot on wheels. Come on, let's pay our respects to the Colonel. - Hello, Colonel. How are you? - Fine, son. See you soon. We'll be there. By golly, Dodge, you know everybody in Kansas. Not quite. Those boys have been working for us... hunting buffalo to feed our construction gang. The young Irishman is Wade Hatton. I met him during the war. He fought for the rebels in Jeb Stuart's cavalry. Been everywhere, done everything. Sort of a rover. Well, it takes all sorts of men to build a railroad. No, sir. Just a couple of us Irishmen. On your toes, men! We're gonna start moving. Watch those hides they don't slip. Keep on your toes. We're gonna start moving. You drivers keep close together. Ready to start whenever you say, Jeff. All right, let's move fast! - Which one of you men is Jeff Surrett? - I am. Why? I'm John Barlow, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, from Kansas. - You're under arrest. All three of you. - For what? For the illegal killing of buffalo and selling their hides. We got those buffalo on free land, just the same as he did. He has a government permit to kill buffalo for the railroad workers. - You got any such permit? - No. - Is this some of your business, Hatton? - I made it my business. As soon as I found out you were shooting buffalo on Indian territory... stealing the hides, and letting the meat rot in the sun. When any Indians protested, you shot them down in cold blood. This has been going on all winter. It took you till now to catch up with us? We didn't want to. We just watched you and counted the animals you killed. You're lying. You'd have made them stop us before, if you'd known. Why? It seemed a better idea to let you and your pals work your head off... packing and curing those hides until they caught you. So that's why you waited so long? The Indians might just as well get the hides in good salable condition. All right, Hatton. But I hope you stick around Kansas for a long time... because we're gonna collect for every one of those hides in full. Right. If you're ever around our way, look us up. All right, boys. - Congratulations, Colonel. - Thanks, Rusty. Wade, you've been a great help in building this railroad. Now the real work begins. We've got to make it pay. That's up to you. No, it isn't. I've got other work to do. We're looking further westward. I want you to take charge here, help build up this town. - Organize trade for our road. - No, thanks, sir. We're on our way back to Texas. We'll drive cattle up to meet your railroad. If we keep hanging around here, these two galoots are gonna get civilized. We better leave here before old fog head starts eating with a knife and fork. A knife, anyway. You couldn't keep Wade here, Colonel. He's the most moving-on man you ever saw. First off, he was in the English Army over in India. Then he got mixed up in some kind of a hooray revolution down in Cuba way. Then he started punching cattle in Texas. That was before he enlisted in the war. So he's either the greatest traveler ever lived... or else he is the biggest liar. And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you... the man who made this progress possible: Col. Dodge. Ladies and gentlemen... today a great chapter of history has been written... and we take justifiable pride... in bringing this railroad to the terminal furthest west in this country. Someday, and I believe it will be in the near future... a great city will spring from this very spot upon which we now stand. A city which will represent all that the West stands for: honesty, courage, morality, and culture. For all the noble virtues of civilization. I can see a great metropolis of homes, churches, schools. A fine, decent city, which will become the flower of the prairie. A city whose name... Yeah, Colonel. Just what do you aim to call this here perfect metropolis? What are we going to call it? Why not call it after the man who made it possible? Dodge City. That's right. Dodge City it is. Be sure to give those cattle plenty of salt. The more water, the more weight. Cattle is sure some business. They must come to Dodge City from all over the world, don't they, Pop? Almost, son. Hold my horse. Wait, Surrett. You can't ship those cattle. Where's my money? You'll get it, Cole. Why don't you stop worrying? You've got no right to ship those cattle until I'm paid. $15,000 dollars, cash in hand. Those were the terms we agreed on. Take it easy. I can't be running to the bank every time a train leaves town. If you don't trust me, other cattle brokers will. Maybe they used to, Surrett... but not since what happened to Sam Chapin and Kit Sproull. They trusted you, too, didn't they? But not me. I'm coming to your place tonight to collect for these steers. You have the money waiting for me, or I'm slapping a warrant on you. You gotta get what's yours when dealing with men like that. They're no good. Sure, Pop, but we can handle them. Hold my horse, son. I won't be but a minute. Take your time, Pop, but get all that's coming to us. - Come along, boys, this is the place. - Here's the Texan! You look great tonight, Ruby. I sure like that new dress. - Thanks, darling. - Just for luck. You don't need any more luck. That's right, I don't, not as long as I've got you. That's me. - Hello, Surrett, I was looking for you. - Hello, Matt. You ready to see me? - I was on my way up to get your money. - I'll go with you. Mind waiting a few minutes? I got some business first. I don't mind. But don't try and run out on me. This is the last chance I'm giving you. Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of you in a minute. Come on over and wet your whistle. - Hey, Jack. - Yes, sir? Give Mr. Cole anything he wants, on the house. Yes, sir. What'll it be, Mr. Cole? - A glass of beer, please. - Yes, sir. Nice-looking bunch of steers we shipped today, Cole. Yeah. They'd look a lot better if I'd been paid for them. What do you mean? Haven't we always paid? Not from what I've heard. Maybe you've been listening to too much talk. Maybe. Maybe not. Are you calling me a liar? I'm not calling you anything, Yancey. In fact, I'd rather not talk to you at all. - Keep your hand off that gun! - Why, I... ""... in sure and certain hope of the resurrection of the dead. ""Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. ""Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. ""Give us day by day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts... ""as we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us. ""And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. "" To have him go this way. It's so cruel, so useless. You promised you wouldn't cry, Mom. John, will you look after Mrs. Cole? You don't have to, Mr. Orth. I can take care of her. That's right, Harry. You're the man of the family now. Funeral's over. There's your man, Marshal. Serve your warrant. It's about time those guerrillas were taken in hand. What are you waiting for? Go on. Don't push me. I know my duties. Hello, Marshal. Yancey, I've got a warrant here to arrest you for the murder of... Matt Cole. Why don't you go ahead and serve it? What are you waiting for? - Mind riding back into town with me? - Yeah. That's all right, Yancey. You go ahead and ride in with the Marshal. Why, sure, Marshal. Come along. Come on, boys. Come on, Al. After all, the law's the law. Now, just a minute, Marshal. - This is your... - Now, hold on there, boys. - Wait a minute. - Get him in there, boys. Hurry up. Come on, boys. We'll ride him out of town in style. What's the use of trying to make an honest town of Dodge City? Surrett's crowd scares off the honest, law-abiding settlers. They're all going on to Wichita and Kansas City. I tell you, Ellen, we're the public disgrace of America. You know what the New York newspapers are saying? There's no law west of Chicago, and west of Dodge City, no God. I'm afraid they're not far wrong. It's becoming unsafe for a woman to walk on the streets in this town. And as for children... I almost wish Lee and Abbie weren't coming to live with us. They'll be all right, unless they're as bullheaded as their father was. We haven't had a word from them since they reached Texas. When do you suppose they're gonna get here? I kept a record somewhere. - I always used to... - They're on the table. Yeah, the dates. They left Fort Worth three weeks ago with a cattle-drive party. Now, let's see. Yeah, they must have crossed the Red River about here... then on up the Chisholm Trail into the Indian territory. I'd say they'd be about Broad Plain by now. Tex. - Have you seen my brother? - Yes'm. He's over yonder somewhere hotfooting it around. He swiped one of the boss's horses and I reckon he sure is drunk again. I consider that a very impertinent remark. Yes'm, I guess maybe I shouldn't have said he's drunk... even if he is drunk. I don't know what I'm going to do about you. Broad Plain, huh? This is where the Indians are supposed to be? Yes. If you keep up the fuss you're making... you'll have them right on our doorstep. I wish they would attack us. It's dull plugging along like this day in and day out. It's dull, but that's no reason for you to act like a lunatic. Maybe they don't even know we're here. Let's tell them. Stop it! Was that you who fired those shots, Mr. Irving? - Sure it was him. - Sure it was. What about it? Nothing, except it seems like a silly waste of ammunition. He won't do it again. He was just bored. Faith, now, that's a great shame. - So am I. - Really? Well, I'm sorry. Perhaps things will get enlivened for you if that shooting stampedes the cattle. Since you seem to know what troubles him... I'd suggest you see he drinks less. Them two youngsters is more trouble than they're worth. I'll certainly be glad to hand them over to their uncle in Dodge. She sure is pretty, though. Yes. I'd still trade the two of them for one good cigar. All right, this is it! Tex! Rusty! Tex, get the steers watered. Rusty, line up the wagons at the bottom of that slope. - Get moving, flat neck. - Hush, I'll get moving. All right, folks, we're bedding down. Watch your cook fires, now. The grass is awful dry. - Don't you wander off. - Ma, I'm hungry. All right, get your teams hooked up. We're pulling out. - Move as soon as you're ready. - Tex, get the herd started. Wade, you better watch old bullet head here. I caught him riding in the wagon yesterday. - Hush. I was... - Hush up. Good morning, Mrs. Harper. Did you rest well? - Thank you. Fine. - Good. Be sure you boil that water before you drink it. I'll bet two minutes after you were born, you were telling the doctor what to do. Think so? I'm sorry, Miss Irving. You know, it's really no fun playing boss... but someone's gotta say what's to be done, haven't they? You know, out here... a trail boss has sometimes got to take the law into his hands. Yes. ""Pioneering,"" I believe you call it, don't you? That's right. You don't seem to be enjoying it much. Enjoying it? Can anyone enjoy being jolted along week in and week out... through a nightmare of heat and dust... with sand in your teeth, eyes, and hair? Faith, now. If you didn't like sand, maybe you shouldn't have left home. I wouldn't have. But we didn't have much choice after Father died. I see. I'm sorry. Here, can I take that? It looks heavy for you. No, thanks. I can manage it. I'm sure you can manage a bigger one in each hand, if you wanted to. But why should you? - Because I happen to be in a hurry. - We'll wait for you. There. See? If everyone in the camp obeyed orders as willingly and charmingly as that... we wouldn't have any trouble at all. My brother and I seem to be causing you a great deal of trouble, Mr. Hatton. No, just your brother. You know, I think you spoil him by mothering him, don't you? Maybe I do. May I make a suggestion? Why don't you go... Look here, Mr. Irving! This ain't no picnic grounds. Put up that gun before you stampede them cattle. Get down off your high horse, will you, cowboy? Watch me shoot the handle right off of this one. - Are you out of your mind? - Hiya, Abbie. You're just in time to witness an exhibition of some real fancy shooting. Put up that gun before somebody takes it away from you. Who's gonna take it away from me? You're drunk, you don't know what you're doing. Don't start to lecture me. I've had enough of that for now. Lee, don't! It's a run! Tex, head in those leaders and keep them milling. See what you've done. I hope you're satisfied. I've been waiting to see some action since this trip started. You crazy galoot! You saw what nearly happened. What? Just gave you lazy cowhands a little exercise, that's all. Irving, you're giving us a great deal of trouble. - You're gonna force me to be unpleasant. - Let me alone. I'm not on your payroll, and I'll do as I please. No, you'll do as I please. You people in the wagons came to us for protection. You paid for it, and you're getting it. You'll obey orders until we reach Dodge City. You may not realize it, but the Civil War is over... and you're no longer in the Army, Mr. Hatton. I'm not gonna argue with you. Sober up and stay sober, or I'll confiscate your liquor. If you lay a hand inside our wagon, I'll blow it off. Look, Irving... we've got a very special treatment for bad little boys like you. You behave yourself or you'll ride into Dodge City backwards on a mule. You'll look very silly. Now we're moving. You better get started. - Lee, be sensible. - Let me alone. I can hardly wait to see you on that mule. You sure will look funny. Take that stupid grin off your face, you big hyena. Drop that gun, Irving! Drop it, I tell you! You've killed him. Here you are, Tex. That's for Dr. Irving. Take the shortcut into Twin Forks. Bear left from there. It's three hours to Dodge. Understand? Sure I do, Wade. I tried to explain in it. Tell him I'll call on him when we get there. I sure hope that doctor is more understanding than his niece. - Good luck. Get going, Tex. - Goodbye. Miss Irving. I know how you must feel about all this... and I know how you must feel about my part in it. My shot was unavoidable. I'd never have fired it except to defend myself. I've no words to tell you how badly I feel about it all. Will you leave me alone, please? Well, so this is Dodge City, huh? It sort of smells like Fort Worth, don't it? That's not the city you smell. That's you. We'd better get you to a bathtub before somebody shoots you for a buffalo. Gentlemen, can I hold your horse? Lady, can I carry your basket? Gentlemen, can I hold your horse? Gentlemen, can I hold your horses? I'll watch them real careful. - What's the idea, sonny? - I'm in business. I'm the man of the family now. You're certainly making an early start. What do you charge? A quarter just for keeping an eye on your horses. 50 cents for watching them extra good. All right, then. We'll take $1 worth of the extra good. Didn't Shakespeare begin by holding horses? - Who? - Hey, stranger, where's the money? So you don't get any credit here, either? Here you are. - Thanks, mister. Much obliged. - You're welcome. William Shakespeare. I never heard of him. What part of Texas is he from? Stratford-on-Avon. - Good morning, boys. - Good morning. - You fellows look pretty dusty. - We certainly are. It's on us about an inch thick for each state in the country. What's the news in Dodge? Just about the same as always: gambling, drinking, and killing. Mostly killing. Had one here just the other night. Coldest-blooded thing I ever heard of. Man named Yancey shot Matt Cole over at the Gay Lady. Matt Cole? I used to know him in Texas. What was the trouble? What was the trouble? How long since you been in Dodge? Quite some time. We always ship up through Wichita. This town is run by a man named Jeff Surrett. Cole was trying to collect for some cattle he sold. $15,000, Surrett owed him. Good morning, gentlemen. How long before you'll be through with this fellow? In about 10 minutes, Mr. Surrett. All right, hurry it up. I'm gonna take a bath. Yancey. I'm sorry, there's somebody in there already. Hey, shut that door! There's a draft in here. What's the idea, Charlie? You know I always take a bath on Saturday mornings. Get that fellow out of there. I'm sorry, I can't do that, Mr. Surrett. He ain't been in there half an hour. He's been in there long enough. You tell him to get his clothes on. All right. - Wait a minute. - What did you say? My friend in there paid for that tub. Much as you undoubtedly need a wash, he needs it even more. If it ain't our old friend Hatton. Right. Quite a coincidence, isn't it? You figuring on being around Dodge City long? No, just as long as it takes me to finish my job. Maybe longer, if I find it interesting. Any objections? No, I think we can make it pretty interesting for you. Yes, I'm sure you might. I hear you made it pretty interesting for Matt Cole the other night. You always did hear a little too much. It's possible you boys were always a little too noisy. Come on there, Charlie. Finish me up. Put some of that green stuff on. Make me smell like a geranium. - Say, Wade. - What? You know, it just come to me who that fellow was. It did? Marvelous. Naturally, our nephew's death was a great blow to us. But now, since your explanation, I can understand how it happened. There's no sense in holding any grudge against you. Thank you, sir. We're used to death here in Dodge City, Mr. Hatton. Even of the people we love. That's hard to say, but it's true. Yes, I suppose so. Thanks again, Doctor. I wonder if I might pay my respects to Mrs. and Miss Irving on my way out? No, my boy. I wouldn't advise that. Walter, Mr. Evans wants you to come as soon as you can. - Excuse me. - Ellen, this is Mr. Hatton. - How do you do, Mrs. Irving? - He's come to tell us about Lee. It's regrettable that we have to meet under these circumstances, Mrs. Irving. I'm sorry, my boy. But, you see, we never had any children of our own. And to my wife, Lee was... Well, you can understand how she feels about it. Yes, of course. Anyhow, it was very gracious of you to receive me, sir. Don't bother about that thing, sir. I can... Miss Irving. I'll not be troubling you with any further apologies. But I would like you to know that if ever I can be of any service to you... - I shall be only too happy. - Thank you. The only way you can be of service to me is to keep out of my sight. I wouldn't take that too seriously, my boy. Women's logic and emotions are often very confusing. I think I've heard my father say the same thing. I'm sure that Miss Abbie has a more biting tongue... than my mother ever had. All right, gentlemen, let's begin the auction. One thousand six hundred and nineteen head of prime Texas steer. Grass-fed, fat, frisky, fresh off the Chisholm Trail. Is that correct, sir? Go ahead. But don't make any sale until I tell you. Right. The agent reserves his right to refuse all bids. Now then, who'll start us off? What am I offered? $25 a head. $25 from Mr. Surrett. I'm going to $28. $28 for the finest herd of steers that ever come out of Texas. - Who'll say $28? Mr. Cagle? - No, sir. Mr. Orth? Here's a cash profit of $50,000 begging to be picked up. - All right, $28. - Thank you, sir. $28 is bid. Who'll say $30? - Nobody will raise it? $30 from Mr. Surrett. Anybody raise that? Anybody say $32? How about you, Mr. Orth? Going to Mr. Surrett for $30. Once. Going twice. Hold on. Will Mr. Surrett and Mr. Orth be kind enough to step up here? Mr. Surrett, Mr. Orth, will you come over here, please? You offered $30. Was that cash? What's that to you? Do you own those cattle? I'm the agent for them. I'm protecting the owner's interest. I see. I'll give you part of it in cash tonight and the balance in 30 days. I see. How about you, sir? I could've paid the full amount in cash today. - You could have? Right. They're yours. - Mine? - But he offered... - I said, sold. What are you trying to do? I made the high bid on those steers. I heard you. But I prefer to make my deal with cash buyers... who don't pay off in the back rooms of saloons. I'm at the Drovers Hotel, Mr. Orth. If you care to meet me at 3:00 in Room 15, we can close this deal. - I'll be there. - Right. Deal is made, Mr. Auctioneer. Thanks. Good day. Sold to Mr. Orth. - Joe, did you hear that? - I'll put it right on the front page. - Who's that fellow? - I don't know. But you can bet I'm gonna find out. - How are you, Harry? - Hello, Mr. Orth. - I'll hold your horse for you. - Good. - For a quarter. - Well, that's fair enough. - Here. - Thanks. How are you, Frank? - Fine. How are you, Mr. Orth? - Just fine. - Howdy, Mr. Orth. - Howdy. Stick 'em up. Rusty, we're done for. It's Dangerous Ambrose, the terror of the prairie. He's got us in his power. Yes, sir. I'm a pretty desperate character. I can see that. Would you take ransom if we offered it to you? Try it and see. How's that? Thanks, mister. I'll watch your horses better than they were ever watched before. That's fair enough. I sure hope you stay in town a long time. I'll bet you do at that. Mr. Orth come in yet? He went upstairs a few minutes ago, Mr. Hatton. My name is Joe Clemens. I'm editor of the Star. I'd like to publish your impressions of Dodge City, if you don't mind. Jack Orth. Somebody shot him. He's laying right outside of Room 15. That's too bad, Hatton. I don't think your deal with Orth will go through. But I'm still offering you $30 a head for those cattle. Listen, Surrett. Those cattle aren't for sale to you at any price. It's a shame about Jack Orth being killed, isn't it? Must have been a big surprise to you. Excuse me. Another murder. Four or five a day. Surrett's getting to be the undertaker's best friend. It's sure getting dangerous to live around here. Why don't you get out? Clemens, I see by that bulletin that you're looking for trouble again. What's the matter? We're just printing the plain facts. We've put up with you and your paper long enough. Now we mean business. Yancey, you're not scared of that fellow from Texas, are you? We'll take care of him. But I'm warning you, don't print no story about Surrett. Is that clear? I'm waiting for an answer. I reckon you get the general idea now. Rusty, I don't like the look of those clothes. They look like you're up to no good. I ain't had store clothes on for a long time. I kind of felt like I wanted to clean up. I got a call to make down here, so you're on your own. Just try and keep sober and stay out of trouble. You know I signed the temperance pledge before we left Texas. Sure, I know that. You were blind drunk when you signed it. No, you're confusing the issue. I'm a reformed man. Even a reformed man can get into trouble when the boys get paid off. No, I ain't gonna touch a drop. I'm just gonna mosey around and take in the sights. Look out you don't become one of them. Wade, don't you worry none about it. You don't think after me getting store clothes... that I'll have anything like that happen to me, do you? Hey, mister. Please help me over, will you, young man? Come closer. There you are, ma'am. Glad to be of help. - Hi, Rusty. Come on, have a drink. - Hi, Rusty. Come with us and get your feet wet. - Sorry, Tex. I'm just leaving. - What do you mean, leaving? We got a lot of Kansas dust to wash down. Come on. Waste my pay on liquor and gambling? Not me, boys. I'm on the pledge. You ain't serious, Rusty? I tell you, boys, I've saw the light. I'm through with your sinful ways and your riotous living. He must be crazy with the heat. Hey, you old walrus, you! I don't want that. Give me one of those. That's more like it. My gracious! Howdy, young man. Are you a stranger in town? Yes, ma'am. But I sure didn't know this was just for women folks. But it isn't. Not at all. We're mighty glad to have you. But first of all, let me introduce our beloved president, Mrs. McCoy. So delighted to meet you in this charitable institution. Ma'am, my name is Hart. Algernon Hart. Mr. Algernon Hart. Well, Mr. Hart, you're just in time for the meeting. But first, come and have a cup of tea, Mr. Harvey. Hart, ma'am. I'm so sorry. Mr. Hart. Come, girls. Help me. Now, here's your tea. I hope you like it. - One or two? - Three, ma'am. Are you married? - Hey, Joe! - Yeah? How about that Dixie? That's for the Fifth Kansas Infantry. He chased those fellows so far from Fredericksburg... they ain't stopped running yet. Yeah? They must have stopped running long enough to get their picture took. Nobody ever chased the Fifth Kansas, mister. - Do you belong to it? - All of us do. So is that a fact? You must have had to run a long way to get back to Kansas. Well, it's gonna be a longer run back to Texas. It's that dreadful saloon next door. Mabel, please close the shutters. I'm so sorry, Mr. Hart. And there I was, a poor orphan, no ma, no pa. Brung up by Comanche Indians. No matter where you go, fighting ain't good. It ain't no use to fight. Fighting is a thing I... I don't like it myself. And now I want... That's a present from U. S. Grant. That's for Robert E. Lee. Yes, sir. And I want to say to you, sisters... that when righteousness flows from the... It was smooth. Who's next? Come get these fleas out of my hair. Stop it, you fools! Stop it, I say! Stop it! Thanks, Rusty. Just in time. Stop it, you fools! All right, boys. Looks like we dusted this place out pretty good. That's one fight you Yanks didn't win. But take it easy. We'll send a veterinary right over. Come on! Somebody's gonna pay for this and it ain't gonna be with money. When I seen the light, it come to me sort of vision-like. And I was saved. Hey, Jeff, there's one of them Texas heroes left behind. - Let me take a sock at him. - No, I'll handle this. You boys had a lot of fun, didn't you? - We sure did. - That's fine. I've been waiting a long time for you and your pal to make a move... - and this looks like it. - What are you gonna do? I'm gonna have some fun now paying back an old debt with interest. Come on, boys. Let's take him out to the plaza. Bring him along. - Hey, Doc! Mr. Hatton! - What's wrong, Joe? Your men just wrecked the Gay Lady saloon. - Anybody hurt? - I don't know. They're gonna hang one of your boys. - Where are the rest? - They've ridden back to camp. - Where's the hanging party? - Right in the middle of the plaza. You're plum loco. - I ain't done nothing to be strung up for. - Shut up. Hold on, boys. Be careful, Mr. Hatton. Take it easy. That rope is strong enough for both of them. What do you think of that? I've no wish to spoil your fun, Surrett. But would you be kind enough to tell those men to let him go? Sure. We'll let him go just as quick as he gets through dancing around up there. You heard what I said, I think. Tell them to let him go. All right. String him up, boys. Put 'em up! Stick 'em up! Keep reaching high, boys, or you know what happens to Surrett. Get over here, Rusty. Get his gun. We may never be this close again, Surrett. I'm anxious to hear what the sheriff has to say about this hanging. Start walking. - What are you gonna do with him? - No warrant for his arrest. Did he have a warrant to hang this man? You can't jail him without a sheriff's order. That's where we're going. To get a sheriff's order. Wait a bit. What's this? Where's the sheriff? Somebody ran him out of town. Mr. Surrett's the law in Dodge now. I see. Why don't you make him sheriff then? Yeah. That's not a bad idea. Why not? And if I can be of any service to you gents, just let me know. That's the first jail I've ever seen you couldn't get in. Come on. Good day, gentlemen. - It was all a mistake. - A mistake? I thought you promised me you weren't going to get into trouble. Shucks, Wade, I really wasn't in trouble. I see. You're the sort who doesn't really get into trouble... until they start nailing the lid down on your coffin. What's that? ""Pure Prairie League of Dodge City. "" Wait till I tell Tex about this. Don't tell Tex. Well, gentlemen, what's this all about? You all look as though you lost a dollar and found a dime. All right. Go ahead and tell him, Doctor. Thank you. Mr. Hatton, we've invited you here this afternoon with a special purpose. We want you to help us clean up our city. Up to date, our police officers have not been equal to the job. They've either got killed or run out of town. Won't you take the job? Gentlemen, I certainly appreciate your confidence in me. But I'm afraid a position like that isn't quite in my line. You're asking me to turn policeman. I have about as much qualifications for that as I have teaching the ballet. You seemed to be well-qualified the other day in the plaza. I had to get that big hardhead out of that somehow. Any one of you would have done the same. No. We know what we're asking of you and the chances you'd be taking. But it's finally come to a showdown. Who's gonna run Dodge: we or Surrett? We're inviting peaceful emigration here, family men with women and children. And we meet them with what's come to be called Hell Street. I can certainly appreciate everything you say. But as far as I'm concerned, it can't be done. I'm in the cattle business. That demands all my time and attention. I'm sorry. I wish you'd think it over, my boy. We need you. You're asking the wrong man, Uncle Walter. He isn't interested in the lives of innocent people. Why should he care what happens to you and your families? Your struggle to make a living in a decent city? What Dodge City needs is a man with a sense of public pride... and the courage to back it up by shooting it out with men of equal skill. But Mr. Hatton's bravery consists of gunfights with impulsive boys. Abbie, stop it. Well, gentlemen, I don't think much remains to be said. Mrs. Irving, thank you. Goodbye, gentlemen. Quickly as you can. Come along. Harry, keep out of that lunch basket. I can't seem to get my mind off those pies, Miss Abbie. - How long before we eat? - Not till we get to Sycamore Springs. - Come along. - I'll do my best to wait. Everybody in? Here we go. Come along. Cross the river here, Russ, and bear due west on Wichita. When are you fixing to get started? First thing in the morning. I'm sick of this town. Good morning. I know that man. Hello, stranger. Hello there, Shakespeare. - Here. - Thanks. You'd better watch that riverbed, too. It's probably gonna be dry. Steady! I'll help you! Give me those reins. Let me drive. Let me through. Darling! He was trying to help me. Get a doctor, quick. I'm afraid a doctor won't be any use. Even children. This has got to stop. Oh, my darling. My little baby. Go on. You're all under arrest. Take them out, boys. Get in there. I wanted to be sure you'd seen this, Surrett. So I paid you a special visit. I've already seen it. It looks like you're trying to run everybody out of Dodge City. No, not everybody. Just the undesirable element. There's no law in Kansas that prevents a man from carrying a gun... - or coming or going where he pleases. - There's going to be one. Sit down, Hatton. The merchants are not gonna stand for this. Yes, I think they will. The merchants helped me draw this law up. They're willing to take their chances. I just wanted to be certain about you, though. - Let's get down to cases, Hatton. - Right. What cases? You and I have had a couple of run-ins. But I'll forget them if you do, and see if we can't work together. If you really mean that, that'll make my job easier. - Your job is just what you make it. - So I hear. The last few sheriffs here didn't do so well, did they? They weren't your type. Just a bunch of dumb sheep wearing badges. I never even bothered to talk to them. I'll bet if you had, you'd have told them a thing or two. Not what I'm gonna tell you anyway. Now listen, Hatton. There's no reason that Dodge City can't be run properly. Just so long as you don't try to change things too much. Because this is a cattle town, the biggest one on earth. And that's what it's always gonna be. There's more than $20 million worth of beef and hides... comes through here every year. You know that because you bring them up. You've been holding the wrong end of the sack... because the real money ain't working for those Texas breeders. No, sir. It's right here in Dodge City because this is where they pay off. You mean, on your roulette tables. Sure, coming and going. If not for the Gay Lady, that money would go out of Dodge City... and the trade would move right on to Wichita. You know that cattle crowd. After months of backbreaking work getting the cattle here... they want a little fun and freedom. If it's not here, they'll go where they can get it. - And you'd go broke. - Sure. But I ain't aiming to. You see, I make $100,000 a year one way or another. Frankly, I don't need that much money. Naturally, I'd be willing to make a deal with anybody... that would sort of see things my way. Make a mighty good deal for both of us. You mean, a little friendly bribery? You can catch more flies with molasses than you can with vinegar. True enough. I hope you'll not be offended... but I don't like the smell of your molasses. You'd better get rid of that gun by Monday. You're north of Front Street... and that jail's apt to be a little crowded. What's the matter? Didn't it work? He wouldn't listen to reason? No, he wouldn't. All right, Russ, let's go. We've a lot to do. Don't ever do nothing like that unless I tell you to. This ain't the time. We gotta wait a while. They sure make a fella feel at home around here. Yes. They'll even dig you a home, if you're nice to them. One at a time here, fellas. Line up. There you are. - Will I get this stuff back again? - You sure will. - Disarm me? Not for no man. - Nobody gets my gun. - What a leery idea. - Who does he think he is? - Bet two. - I'll call it. - Raise it five. - Call five. - I'm dead. - Kings up. - I guess we better quit, boys. - Quitting because you're winning? - You read that sign, didn't you? - We don't believe in signs. That sheriff's a big four-flusher and that sign's been bad luck to me all night. Guess that'll show you Hatton ain't bluffing. That's right, gentlemen. Hatton's not bluffing. - You're all under arrest. - For what? For not believing in signs. All right, deputies, take them. - Come on. - Let go, now. I tried to warn them, but I guess they gotta learn through experience. I don't know what you're warning people about. - What do you mean? - You're north of Front Street, aren't you? - And you're carrying a gun, aren't you? - Yeah. - Right. You're under arrest. - What? Come on. But I'd feel undressed without my gun. Where you're going, you won't need any clothes for a few days. If I was you, I'd rather arrest my brother than me. Hey, Rusty, you are a traitor... I'm sorry, boys, I can't do anything about it. Wade, you ain't gonna keep me in here, are you? Sorry, Tex. You read that notice the same as anyone else. Three days in there won't do you a bit of harm. You can't do this to me after all we've been through together. We fought the war together, built the railroad... we ate, drank, slept, lived, and died together. Now we're gonna be in jail together: you in there and me out here. Isn't that wonderful? That makes seven families that have moved in this week. That does my heart good. There's the Turner family, moving back from Wichita. And after she said she'd never set foot in Dodge again. Welcome home, Mr. Turner! - How do you do, Mr. Clemens? - Hello, Joe. Isn't that the sweetest bonnet she's got on? It's brown moir. Moir. How do you spell ""moir""? M- O-I-R-E? Who in tarnation gives a hoot what Mrs. Turner's wearing? Just about every blessed woman in town, that's all. What happened in this fight between the Indian and Jim Kendall? I went into that pretty thorough. There wasn't no fight. They called each other names, the Indian throwed a knife at Kendall. Kendall sort of fired a couple of shots. Nobody got hurt. Nobody got... I see. It wasn't a real fight, it was just a sort of friendly argument. - Hello, Tex. - Hi, fellas. Come on in and sit down. What are you doing with that secondhand store around your neck? Where've you been? We ain't saw you for days. Around. Been doing a lot of thinking lately. Thinking? I hope you're gonna take that job I offered you. We need another good deputy around here. That's what I've been thinking about. I've decided to go back to Texas. - What for? - I don't know. This place is getting too big, and calm, and peaceful-like. You mean, Rusty and I have stopped all the fun? It's all right for women and children, but I've decided to go back to Texas. If you've made up your mind, that's that. There's nothing we can do to keep you here? - No. - So long, Tex. - So long, Wade. - Give him back his gun. Number 27. If you're ever around here, that job will still be waiting for you. No, sir. I just don't fit in a sissy town like this. I certainly hate to see you go. I'll miss you fellas, too, a lot. We had a lot of fun together. So long, knot head. If I hung around here much longer, I'd be riding a side saddle. Yes, I suppose so. All right, Rusty. Arrest that man. - Who? Me? - What for? He's carrying a gun, isn't he? Give him back his old room. - Morning, Joe. - Hello, Wade. What's the news? You ought to know. Haven't you read your paper? Got those tax notices ready? - Hack's just running them off. - Fine. - Come on in. - All right. Have a chair. You look as though you're pretty busy... - Fred? - Yes, ma'am. - Would you set this in my copy, please? - I will, ma'am. - Joe... - Good morning. Did you want something? I'd like to have my curiosity satisfied. What are you doing here? Obviously, I'm working. Obviously. But at what and why? The town is growing by leaps and bounds, and the paper needed somebody... who would write things that would interest its women readers. I see. Tell me, what are the vital interests of your women readers? What other women are wearing... how to make Lady Baltimore cake with two eggs... who invited the minister to tea... and whose baby is going to be born and when. - Fascinating. - Is there anything else you'd like to know? What do the doctor and Mrs. Irving think about it? They made the same stupid objections that you're making mentally now. But when I decide on a thing, I usually manage to carry it through. Yes, I've noticed that. You realize that people are inclined to think that a newspaper office... is an odd place for a charming lady like you to be working, don't you? Are you the delegation sent to tell me that? No. I stop trouble around here. I don't start it. - What's wrong with my working here? - It's undignified. It's unladylike. You ought to be home doing needlework. Things like that. Sewing buttons on for some man, I suppose. Buttons come off. Someone's gotta sew them on. That's a fine career for an intelligent woman. - Here are your tax notices, Wade. - Thanks. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth when these go out. Abbie, I know this isn't in your line... but as long as you insisted on the job... will you stop calling them ""cows in the stockyard""? They're steers. Steers. I don't see any difference. ""A rise is expected this season in the price of longhorn cows. "" Never mind. I'll correct this copy myself. ""Longhorn cows. "" I must be running along. By the way, may I let you into a little secret? What? You've got a smudge of ink on your nose. Goodbye. Goodbye, Joe. Goodbye, Wade... I'm sorry. Abbie. Is this showing proper respect for the law? I never saw the law fall on its face before. I didn't fall on my face. There's an old saying in the British Army: ""The law must always save its face in front of the natives. "" And what if the natives object to its face? We just put them across our knee... and spank them soundly. You're not suggesting that I'm a native? No. The only real native of Kansas is the buffalo. He's got a very hard head, a very uncertain temper... and a very lonely future. Apart from that, there's hardly any comparison between you. - Goodbye, Joe. - Goodbye, Wade. Goodbye. I like that fella. ""Cows in the stockyard. "" Of course, I ain't a man who believes in taxes. But I can see they're a necessary evil. Somebody's gotta pay for schools and churches and such things. Especially now that the town's getting so darn big. Yes, sir. They do say there's nothing certain except taxes and death. Get up, Hatton. What for? A couple of the boys are waiting outside to have a little talk with you. I see. You know, I'm really surprised at Surrett. I thought he had more intelligence than to send you here on a silly deal like this. - You haven't got a chance... - Shut up and get out of that chair quick. About 10 days for this customer. Five to cool off and five to think it over. You bet. I'll take care of it personally. Come on, sonny boy. I'll buy you some candy. - What were you saying about taxes? - What taxes? I don't remember. Shall I trim your mustache? No, thanks. I think I can manage. See that big herd of buffalo grazing away so peacefully down there? The trouble with the buffalo is they had things too easy at the start. It works the other way around, too. Take us, for example. We had such a bad beginning. We'll have a wonderful future. That's typical Irish logic: totally unconnected. You think so? It may be Irish, but it's not unconnected, and I can prove it. Thirty years ago, my father met my mother at the Londonderry fair. He'd come down to sell some prize pigs. Big, fat, lovely pigs they were. Mother was down there after winning the grand prize for her roses. Roses of Sharon, enormous, big things, as big as your face and nearly as beautiful. I don't suppose there were ever roses like that in the whole of Ireland. What must happen? The very last day of the fair... Father's pigs get out and eat up every single one of Mother's prize roses. Root, stem, flower and all. Did any two people ever get off to a worse start than that? Look at them now: six big lusty sons, a score or so of prize pigs... and the most beautiful rose garden in the whole of Antrim. I envy you people who have kissed the Blarney Stone. You do? It's cold on the lips. I think we'd better be getting back. I'm afraid it'll be dark before we get there. - Are you sure it's the dark you're afraid of? - What do you mean? - Maybe you're afraid I might kiss you. - You wouldn't dare. I wish I were as sure of that as you are. May I? Thank you. You know, I was just thinking... the buffalo wouldn't be so badly off if the buffalo didn't have a one-track mind. But then the buffalo wouldn't be a buffalo, would it? I suppose not. You wouldn't be you unless you thought you might like that kiss. - You seem very sure of my reactions. - Oh, no. That's something you can never be sure about until you've tried it. Can you? Good morning, Abbie. Good morning, Mrs. Cole. How are you? So-so. Won't you come in and sit down? There. Is there anything I can do for you? Yes, I'd like to run this advertisement in your paper. That is, if it doesn't cost too much money. Our advertising rates are very low. I'm sure we'll be able to. You want to sell your house? No, I don't want to. I have to, Abbie. Let's get a new lead line on this church bazaar story. How do, Mrs. Cole? How are you today? - Good morning, Joe. - How much will you charge on this? One, two, three, four... You're selling your house? You're not leaving town, are you? No, I just... Joe, I can't afford to keep it up. I can't even begin to meet the taxes on it these days. I can't understand that. Matt always made good money. Just the day he died... he collected $15,000 from Surrett. Didn't he? That's what I thought, too, but I've never seen a penny of it. Well, what have you done about it? I've spoken to Jeff Surrett about it several times... but he'll never give me a straight answer. It looks to me like Mrs. Cole needs help, and we might be able to help her. Yeah, it does look that way. Mrs. Cole, would you mind if we kind of looked into this? Mind? I'd consider it a very great favor. There are a lot of accounts in this town to be settled. Now, let's see. How's the best way to tackle this? There you are. The entry, the date, and the figures. $15,000. What Matt Cole did with his money after that is his business, not mine. He had $10 on his body when he was found. He never left the saloon. I make it a point not to discuss the affairs of my customers. But as long as you force my hand, I'll give you the facts. Matt Cole lost that $15,000 playing roulette. Playing roulette? I'd like you to remember that, Abbie. Don't worry, I'll remember. As a matter of fact, we'll all remember it. He never went near those roulette tables. He went straight to the bar and Yancey killed him there. - According to who? - You'll find that out in court. If you've got such a clear case, why don't you arrest me now? I think we'll wait a few days. I want to talk to a few more people... before we start giving you board and room at the state's expense. You're bluffing, Hatton. You're holding a pair of deuces. You're bluffing. Am I? Munger killed Orth because he spoiled a cattle deal for you. Yancey killed Cole because he tried to collect $15,000 you owed him. And more citizens in this town have been killed trying to do business with you. That's what the three of us are going to prove in court. We'll see if the jury thinks we're bluffing. Take that book, Joe. I want to look at it again. I can hardly wait to start writing this story. Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be the most important article... that's ever appeared in the Dodge City Star. There it is. We'll have it out by noon tomorrow. How did you find out all these other things about Surrett? Abbie, a good newspaperman has two jobs. One is to write the news as it happens, day by day. The other is to be ready for it, and write it first... all but the end. This is Jeff Surrett's morgue. I must be an optimist at heart. I've been getting it ready for a long time. You two, haven't you got any homes to go to? It's past midnight. You'd better be running along, Abbie. The Doc will skin me alive. We've got Surrett by the scruff of the neck. You have? Why not let it go tonight and resume your grip in the morning? You two realize what kind of a target you'd make from out there? I'm gonna take you home before your uncle gets after Joe with a shotgun. Here's your cloak. I'll come back and stay till you finish, Joe. The story's all written. You don't have to worry about me. I'm just gonna mark it for the printer, then call it a day. Italics. Don't hang around, or Surrett might come in and mark it for you. They wouldn't try anything at this stage of the game. You think not? I hope you're right. Good night, Abbie. See you in the morning. - Good night, Joe. - Good night, Wade. Lock this door after us when we go out. Mr. Hatton, I am accustomed to being up after dark. - Lock it. - All right. - Good night. - Good night. ""The laws of Dodge City must be respected... ""not only by one group of citizens... ""but by all groups. "" Paragraph. I like that. What was that? Whoever killed Joe Clemens ought to be strung up. And, by golly, I'll furnish the rope. If he's got enough neck left to put a rope on. They sneaked up on him. Never even gave him a chance. The bullet went through his heart. I can only blame myself for this. But it's one thing they won't get away with. Little fella sure was aces. It's too bad. I can't understand it. Everybody knows that Joe didn't have any enemies except Surrett and his gang. Who else could have done it? Isn't it sufficient proof that Joe's story is gone and the whole file on Surrett? This door was locked. I know that because I tried it myself. It's an old lock. Any key will fit it. - There's nothing here. You're sure? - He always left his copy here on top... so we could set it up first thing in the morning. I'm sorry, Sheriff, that's printer's ink. You can't wash it. It has to wear off. Did you ever read the contents of Joe's files on Surrett? I certainly did, and there was enough in it to hang him. Keep that to yourself. I think you ought to go now. You're looking tired. Good night. See the doctor and Miss Irving home, will you? Right. - What's the next move, Wade? - I suppose we're going to... Are you sure he isn't in his office upstairs? I tell you, Surrett left town on the 4:30 train this afternoon. If you don't believe us, go ask the station agent. Jeff was halfway to Wichita when the shooting occurred. You're barking up the wrong tree, mister. Thanks. Your bet. - Your bet. I call. Who's winning all the money? Been playing long? Ask the bartender. He's got a watch. What do you know about Joe Clemens, Yancey? No more than you, except that he's dead. How did you know he was dead? I heard some of the boys talking. People keep dropping in and out of here all the time. Bet you $5. I call. Three fives. - You're under arrest, Yancey. - For what? For the murder of Joe Clemens. Keep my stack, Bud. I'll be back in half an hour. I wouldn't count on that if I were you. Take him along, Rusty. What's the matter, Taylor? Are you nervous? Go ahead. Deal them. Yancey seemed a little vague about this game. Suppose you tell me what happened. How should I know? - Why don't you ask one of them? - I'm asking you. Did Yancey ever leave this table after the game started? No. He never left the room. I told you a hundred times, he never went out of the place. Come on, you're wasting valuable time. - Answer my question. - No, he never left the table. Stop lying. You're bad at it. Yancey left that room between midnight and 1:00, didn't he? - No. - What time was it, then? He didn't leave. Let me work on him, Wade. I can make him talk. If you can't, I can. Let him alone. Listen, if you're too stupid to realize... you're facing a charge of murder, you deserve what's coming to you. What do you mean? I'm gonna have you indicted for murder as an accessory after the fact. I had nothing to do with it. You're gonna be dancing in thin air the same as Yancey. Do you wanna swing, or you wanna tell me and save your neck? All right. I'll tell you. Come on. He went out about 12:30. Came back in about half an hour. That's better. I'll do you a favor, Taylor. Lock him up. - Good morning, Mrs. Irving. - Good morning. Morning. Did you get anything out of Taylor? I did. Where's the doctor? - In there. What's wrong? - What'd he say? Morning, Mr. Hatton. Won't you join us? No, thanks. I came to tell you... it's imperative you get Miss Abbie out of town as soon as possible. Why, for heaven's sake? Because only two people beside myself heard Surrett tell that lie... that he saw Matt Cole lose his money playing roulette. One of those people was Joe Clemens. That's why Surrett killed him. You're the only other person who can bear me out in court. Without you, he can deny it and the jury might believe him. That's all the more reason why I should stay. I started this, and I'm going to see it through. Will you not be a little idiot? You're life isn't worth a nickel as long as Surrett stays out of jail. You're the key to our case and he knows it. We can't go to trial for two weeks. Your life's gonna be in danger till then. Even in this house, on the street, everywhere. I know Surrett and I know what he'd do. You know I'm right, Doctor. I want you to get her out of town. And stay out till I send for you. - You're right. - I see what you mean. Abbie must take the next train for Wichita. She can stay with the Merrills. I'll pack a valise at once. Come and help me get it down off the shelf. I'd never forgive myself if anything happened to her. - I won't go. You can't boss me around. - Can I not, now? I'm the law in this town and you'll do as I say. I don't care what you are, I'm staying here. Aunt Ellen, don't pack... You are the most stubborn female I ever met in my life. Can't you understand I'm doing this because I love you? All right, you two. Stop arguing. Don't worry, Mrs. Irving. We've stopped. What he needs is a rope. He don't deserve a trial. Hand him over to us. We'll give him a trial. This is more like it. The last time I saw a mob like that was in Texas... when they gave Curley Hawks a necktie party. Mr. Grant, I want to talk to you. There's your man. You got 10 minutes. - Hello, Yancey. - Hello. What's going on here? What's the mob doing... Now, take it easy, Yancey. You might as well know this now as later. They wormed it out of Taylor that you left for a half hour. They can't hang me on that. I might have gone anywhere. Maybe a jury wouldn't hang you... if you ever get to a jury. What do you mean by that? What're you trying to say? Joe Clemens was a mighty well-liked man, Yancey. He had a lot of friends. Half the city is planning to break in here tonight... and take things in their own hands. Where's Jeff? He's gotta get me out of here. I telegraphed him an hour ago. He got off the train at Spearville. He got off? For what? Jeff's smart enough to know this town's gonna be warm for a few days. So he's just laying low until the excitement blows over. Too warm for him? So I stay here and get hung for doing his job. - If you think that I... - Shut up, you fool! - You want to tell the whole town? - You bet I'll tell them. I'll tell them who paid me to shoot Joe Clemens and Matt Cole. Let them hang me, sure. But if I go, Jeff's going with me. You rustle him up and telegraph him that. He has to get me out by tonight or I'm giving the whole story to Hatton. But how can Jeff get you out of here? I don't know. That's his problem. Keep your shirt on, Yancey. I got an idea how Jeff and I can handle this. First I'll see Hatton. You got the right man, Hatton. What are you waiting for? Yeah, what are we waiting for? If you don't know what to do with Yancey, we do. - You bet we do. - Will you give us some action? If he won't, we will give him some action. What are you stalling for? You know he killed him. If you don't turn him over to us, we'll come get him tonight. Listen, men, you fellas put me in this office to enforce the law. And I'm going to enforce it. That means a fair trial for any and all prisoners. Including Yancey. And understand this: There is going to be no mob rule around this town as long as I am sheriff. They're bringing up a pole for a battering ram. You see? They're right at the door. Listen to them. You're in charge, Sheriff. What are you gonna do? Wade, what are we gonna do? The whole town's set on getting him out. You can't stop them, the five of you against the town. They'd burn down the building to get in here. We'd save a lot of trouble if we'd feed him to the mob. You want to throw my client to that pack of hungry wolves? Listen, no one's gonna get your client but a jury. - I promise you that. - There's only one way to protect him. Yancey's gotta be taken out of Dodge City before night. Fat chance we'd have of getting him to the station. You can hire a closed carriage, drive him to Spearville... and catch the train for Wichita. Keep him in jail there till he can be tried legally. - Yes, that might work. - It will work. My client's entitled to a fair trial... and it's both our jobs to see that he gets it. You want me to rustle a carriage, Wade? Wait a minute. I got a better idea. But you agree we got to get him out in a hurry? Yes, but we'll do it my way. - This is a sample of your future. - Get in, Russ. Get in. Hold them off as long as you can. I'll send word from Wichita. - Say, what the... - Keep calm, it's official business. Come on. I'm Sheriff Hatton of Dodge City. I've got a prisoner here for Wichita. - Is it all right if we ride with you? - All right, Sheriff. - Mind shutting and locking this door? - Not a bit. Get over there. You can sit there and rest your face and hands. How many stops do you make between here and Wichita? - None. - Good. Keep going. I'll tell you what to do. Put 'em up. - But, gentlemen... - Take him away, Joe. Get in there. Get your hands up. Get them up, I said! Now unlock those cuffs. We've gotta stop. The train's on fire. Don't slow down till the water tower. Hold it, Jeff! We're all gonna burn. Got a friend of yours here, Hatton. Take a good look. Throw me those guns! Pick them up. Unlock those handcuffs! Come on! Hurry up! Close that door. Rusty, this end. Look out! Hurry up! So the lamb killed the butcher. Now, listen to that. Singing hymns and it ain't even Sunday. No one in sight even friendly drunk. Doggone, if this place ain't getting so pure and noble it ain't fit to live in. I'm sure enough going back to Texas now. Imagine asking me to lead the Pure Prairie League. Why not? You're one of the leading lights in it, I hear. First thing you know, they'll be starting a chamber of commerce. - Faith, it's not possible. - What? Look, Col. Dodge. - Hello, Colonel. - How're you, Colonel? Hi, Colonel. How are you, boys? By golly, Wade, it's good to see you alive. - It's good to be alive. - Come on up. - Hello, Colonel. - Wade. By golly, son, it's good to see you. Hello, Tex. How are you, Rusty? I couldn't complain, Colonel. Wouldn't do no good. Sit down over there, sir. I've come all the way from Virginia City, Nevada, just to see you. I'm building a railroad there from San Francisco. It's the richest square mile on earth. Gold, silver, copper. We've got a solid mountain of the stuff. But it's a bad town, Wade. A wild, murderous town. Worse than Dodge City ever was before you cleaned it up. And that's saying a good deal. - I want you to come back with me. - I knowed our luck had changed. We've got 4,000 people out there. Decent men and women with families who are living in terror. Think of them 4,000 poor people. There might be more by the time we get there. We need you, son. The city is teeming with crime and corruption. What law we've tried has failed... because the men behind it hadn't the brains and courage to back it up. You can get plenty of men for that job out here, Colonel. I'm getting married next week. Got tickets for New York. Shucks, you can get married anytime. We'll even go on your honeymoon with you to Virginia City. Thanks. Getting married has ruined a lot of good men. Doesn't it mean anything to you to know... that someplace there's terror and death that you could put a stop to? Yes, it does, Colonel. But the decision isn't as simple as that. If I were free, it might be different. I'll soon have a wife to take care of. Abbie doesn't want to go pioneering anymore. We're planning on coming back here from New York and settling down. There's a wagon train leaving here the middle of next week for Nevada. It'd be a great trip, wouldn't it? Hello, darling. I was just telling the boys how we're going to settle down... - Lemonade? - Thank you. - Lemonade? - Thank you, ma'am. Darling, I was just telling Col. Dodge about our honeymoon in New York. How we're going to see all the shops, theatres, and Niagara Falls, and things. Col. Dodge, when do we start for Virginia City? Wade, it looks like you're marrying the right girl. Virginia City! English Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app, Everybody who's in show business is somebody who wants to be there. In her case, she had to be there. I mean, she didn't even have the urge to. She just did it, and everybody said ""Look at that."" She was a star at four and one of the biggest stars in the country. The minute she was born the doctor slapped her, and she started singing. Believe me when I tell you she's a history of show business. Every phase of entertainment for literally 87 years. The longest career I've ever heard of in show business. Vaudeville, radio. Broadway. The history of television. She used to entertain Al Capone. He loved her. She was tough. She was clearly a woman. One of the boys. She had colorful language and didn't mind using it. She was outspoken. There's no question about it. She had a loud voice. I think people resent the fact that she knows so much. You can't be in the business all your life without being tough. She cut through barriers. Paved her on way. There was a woman that was a heroic, bigger than life character. She'll cut your head off and rightfully so, by the way. I'm with her. - Rose Marie. - Rose Marie. - Rose Marie. - Rose Marie. But she's the only one left. Can I tell you this story? Are you rolling? God love you. God love you. First memory I can recall... I guess was in New York. Fourteenth Street in New York at that time was the 42nd Street of New York today. All the theatre, all the stage shows, everything. My mother loved show business. And so she used to take me. I was three, four years old. So, the minute I came home from seeing the show I would sing for my mother's friends, as I called them lovingly the Pollocks, because my mother was Polish and they were Polish. One day, the Polish people said, ""We entered her in an amateur contest ""at the Mecca Theatre on 14th Street."" They bought my dress, which I still have. They bought the brocaded shoes, Mary Jane shoes, which are at the Smithsonian, and a four year old kid's singing like Sophie Tucker.  I looked around for the longest time   For someone to love And moving like Sophie Tucker. And sounding like Sophie Tucker. She didn't sound like a little girl even then. She sounded like a mature woman. She never had a child's voice. She had an adult voice. Somebody put the wrong box in there.  Hey ah I do Who the hell do you think won the contest? After that, my mother and father took us to Atlantic City. At that time, nightclubs were not like today. Nightclubs had family people. You could bring your children. They had a line of chorus girls, fully dressed, a comic, a singer, a dancer. And so we went to the Little Club in Atlantic City. Evelyn Nesbit was starring. Evelyn Nesbit was a big star at that time because of the scandal that she was in. Her husband shot her boyfriend, and I think he went to jail or the guy was dead. I don't remember. I wasn't there. So we went to see her because she was a big star. Naturally, I'm watching her sing, and what do I do? I start to sing with her. She, being smart, instead of stopping and making a whole big deal, took me by the arm and brought me onstage, and I sang with her. And I heard the crowd saying, ""Get the kid back! ""We want the kid! Get the kid back! ""We want 'em to sing!"" Evelyn Nesbit said to my father, ""What is her name?"" And he said, ""Dainty Rose Marie."" And she said, ""She's a baby. Call her Baby Rose Marie."" So that's how Baby Rose Marie came about. We went back home, and NBC had heard about this child wonder. My father signed the contract with NBC. NBC arranged for a radio program at five years old going into six years old coast to coast, and I sang three or four songs every Sunday morning at 12:15. In 1920, there was just one radio station attempting a local broadcast, and that was in Pittsburgh. By the time Rose Marie signed with NBC, 60% of American homes had a radio, and NBC was the only network broadcasting to the entire nation. Rose Marie's fame took off. She became known as the darling of the airwaves, and this happened before Shirley Temple was even born. And she sang these songs, and we didn't realize what she looked like until we saw her picture in Variety. She had a cover of Variety. And at four or five everybody knew her. I was doing this radio show, and the mail came in, said ""That's not a child. ""That's a 45 year old midget. ""No child sings like that.""  You've got bo bo button   I like your bo bo button  Ah boop boop be doo Oh gee, don't be like that  NBC was affiliated with RKO Theaters all across the country. So, they booked me in the latter part of Vaudeville in the RKO houses to prove I was a child. Pre-dating the cinema and radio, Vaudeville was a massive network of theaters throughout North America. Any given night was a mash-up of singers, dancers, magicians, jugglers, trained animals, acrobats and really anything else that sold tickets all sharing the same stage. I played every theater across the country back and forth. Now the Gary Society, which is the children's society of New York, called my mother in and said ""She's not allowed to sing in New York"" because of the child labor law. And they said, ""There's got to be something we can work out."" So, the plan was I would go out and do my show, and they would arrest my father for five minutes. He would come back home, I would do my second show, they would arrest him again. I come back and do the third show, they would arrest him again. He was arrested 128 times. When I was about 10 years old, I'm working at the Palace Theatre in Chicago with Milton Berle. The doorman says to my father, ""There's a man wants to see you outside."" He went outside, it was Al Capone. He said to my father, he said, ""Hello, Happy."" I thought that was strange. Nobody ever called him ""Happy."" He knew those kind of people. He lived in that kind of a world. I found out later that his nickname was ""Happy Hank."" My father used to go into these places and... and burn up the place if you didn't join the union, you know, those kind of guys. He wasn't very important. He was one of the ""Do this and do that guys."" But they knew him as ""Happy Hank."" He also ran the Diana Ballroom, which is where my mother met him. She loved to dance. She was a wild little girl. She was crazy. And that's where she met my father. But anyway I looked at Al Capone. He was very strange looking. He was heavy. He wore a dark suit, well-dressed, very well-dressed. Hat on the side. ""The boys want to meet the kid."" The doorman is white. And he says, ""You know who that is?"" And we got in the car and went to Cicero, which is out of Chicago a little bit. And we walked into this mansion, which was... didn't belong there, this mansion. It really didn't belong there. It was out of place. And the dining room was as long as you could see. And so all the guys were there, all the big guys were there. And they all came over to me and gave me a hug and said ""We think you're wonderful, we love you, ""and we're glad to meet you."" And I said, ""Thank you."" They went back to the table, and Al gave me a dinner ring with three diamonds in it, which I still have, and picked me up in his arms and said, ""You call me Uncle Al from now on. You understand?"" And I said, ""Yeah, Uncle Al."" Okay, and he says, ""Anything you need, ""anything you want you call me."" Turned to my father, he says, ""We'll take care of her from here on in."" And out we went back to the theater. I think she should've been managed better when she was young. My mother was the force of me liking it and doing it. My father would run the show. My father was boss, and he was a mean man. I disliked my father intensely because my father had another family. I was born illegitimately. My father had another family going with two kids, same names as my brother and I. He was a rough, gruff man who was going to take advantage of his property. And his property was Baby Rose Marie. The minute I won the contest and we went to Atlantic City and I started working the different places, he knew there was a buck there. And he took charge, he ran everything. He was my manager, my agent, everything. And I was making thousands, and my father took it all. At the height of success, Baby Rose Marie was making over a thousand dollars a performance. Her voice landed her big jobs not just on radio but theatrical cartoons like Betty Boop. There's no way to know how much money her father made, but it's millions of dollars in today's currency. And Ro, she never saw a penny. I had no idea that my career was building. I just loved what I did. I did it without question. I never said, ""No, I don't want to do that."" I loved every bit of it. In fact, I still love it today. I really love it today. Work meant everything. Work meant everything. And to do your best meant everything. To always be at your best. And she never went onstage without this. And she had great respect for an audience, which is something that you don't see anymore. Because I loved to work for an audience, and I loved to hold 'em in the palm of my hand, which I do. That's the secret. I was now about 14.  So far above me... An awkward age, very awkward. Not a lady, not a grown-up, not a child. I was an in-between till I got to be about 15, and a very wonderful thing happened. Now ladies and gentlemen, it's time for a song from Baby Rose Marie. But first, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you that she no longer is a baby. For today she's a grown-up lovely young lady, and we call her Miss Rose Marie. I was only 16, 17 years old. And I started playing theaters in and around New York. And I played the Roxy Theater. I played the Capitol Theater on Broadway. Till I started doing nightclub work. With Prohibition now over, when the sun went down Americans flocked to the nightclubs. And onstage, the biggest names of the era. Behind the curtain, the biggest mobsters of the time. When I played the Copacabana in New York, I was sitting with some friends, and the maitre d' came over, Lopez, and he said, ""Mr. Fisher wants to see you."" I said, ""I don't know a Mr. Fisher. ""I'm with my friends, leave me alone."" ""Mr. Fisher wants to see you."" ""Oh,"" I said. ""Oh, okay."" And I said, ""Excuse me,"" and I went up to the lounge, and there was Joe Fischetti. Joe Fischetti, Chicago gangster, cousin of Al Capone, the man who would later get Frank Sinatra investigated by the FBI. And I said, ""Why didn't you tell me you changed your name?"" He says, ""Never mind, at least you came up. ""I came to see you. How you doing, honey? ""Everything all right? You need anything?"" ""No."" ""Want something to drink?"" ""No."" ""Want something to eat?"" ""No."" ""Everybody treating you all right?"" ""Okay."" ""Where you working next?"" ""I really don't have anything booked after this."" ""Well, you're gonna play Tahoe."" ""Oh, okay."" And that's the way it went. I was going from one place to another all because of the boys. They were absolutely wonderful to me. That era was the best era. You had to work. You just didn't go in and do a TV show. You went from Buffalo to Cleveland. You really had to work hard. With World II on, Americans needed an escape, which kept performers like Rose Marie busy as hell. The date is 1944. I'm working at the Terrace Room in Newark, New Jersey. And there was this soldier sitting there. He says, ""You were very good."" He says, ""I enjoyed it."" I said, ""Thank you."" That soldier was a trumpet player named Bobby Guy. He started like everybody playing jobs in bars in little bands. And he gradually worked up till he played with Kay Kyser, who had a very popular radio show called ""Kay Kyser's College of Musical Knowledge."" And Bobby played first trumpet. Bobby was then drafted, landing him a gig in the U.S. Army Band and a transfer to New York City. And I went home, I started thinking about him. I said, ""He's weird, you know. He's very weird."" The next night I went in, he was sitting there. So, now I go home the second night, the next morning I get a telegram saying: ""Caught your act. ""Need new material and can book you four weeks ""on the Gus Sun Time."" Which broke me up because that was strictly a funny telegram. And I get into the club that night, I said, ""I got your wire."" ""Oh, did you know it was me?"" I said, ""Yeah, I knew it was you."" One of my best girlfriends, Jerri, came down with me, and I introduced her to Bobby. I said, ""How do you like him?"" She says, ""He's all right."" I said, ""That's the man I'm gonna marry."" She says, ""Are you kidding? ""You're going to marry that fat sergeant? ""You only knew him three days."" I said, ""He's not fat."" I said, ""He's just chubby. ""Yes, that's the man I'm gonna marry."" ""How do you know?"" ""I don't know, I'm just telling you. ""That's the man I'm gonna marry."" Bobby was full-bodied. He was chunky. He didn't look fat, but he didn't look like a muscle builder with a big smile. She was crazy in love with him, and he was crazy in love with her. And Frank was absolutely panicking that she was going to get married and go away. And there was a lot of problems. We get a little more friendly, then he says to me, ""Gene Krupa opens up after you close here. ""Would you like to come to the opening?"" I said, ""I'd love to."" And on the way over to Gene Krupa's, this is a week and a half, maybe two weeks, he says ""I'm gonna get out of the army soon."" He says, ""I got to go back to California. ""That's where my clothes are. That's where my horns are. ""I don't know what's ahead, ""but if you're willing I'd like you to go with me ""and be with me."" I said, ""Is that a proposal?"" He says, ""Yes."" ""You're asking me to marry you?"" ""Yes."" ""By telling me you're going to California, that's it?"" He says, ""That's it. Do you want to go?"" ""You mean do I want to marry you?"" I remember this conversation word for word. I said, ""Fine."" I remember she was working at the Capitol Theater doing four or five a day. And Frank had cops outside and in the theater looking for him to come in and have him arrested. Arrested for what, I don't know. What are you going to arrest him for? But he was that vicious about Bobby Guy. Bobby came to pick me up, and we walked down Madison Avenue window shopping and stuff but just having a great time. And I got into NBC, and Bobby used to wait for me downstairs. He wouldn't come up. When Bobby was waiting at the corner of 52nd Street, he was holding onto the lamp post like this. My father came up to him like this and said, ""You sonofabitch, you stay out of our life. ""I'm going to kill you, you no good..."" And he called him every name in the book. By now, a crowd had gotten around. And everybody kept saying, ""Hit him, soldier. ""Hit him, soldier."" And he kept saying, ""You no good SB, ""you this and that and this thing."" And Bobby just kept holding back like this and saying, ""He's her father, he's her father, ""I can't do anything, he's her father."" ""You stay away from my daughter ""or so help me God I'll kill the... out of you."" And the only way she got away was she and Bobby eloped. Otherwise, he wouldn't let her go. I called my girlfriend Jerri, I said, ""Listen, you got to help me. I'm eloping tomorrow."" And she said, ""Oh my God. ""Come to the house tonight, ""under my window I will throw you out my suitcases ""full of clothes."" Sure enough, she came that night. I opened my window, I threw my suitcases out the window. We got married in City Hall, and every time the judge says, ""Is any reason this should not go through?"" I thought my father was going to bust in and say ""Whoa!"" you know. But he didn't. I got married. Wedding night... mm-hmm. And he went to AAA and got a list of hotels and how far it was from this hotel to that hotel to this hotel and that hotel, which was all news to me. On the way, I would call up people that I knew. I remember Scarpelli, one of the bosses, one of the big mob bosses, he's a big guy like this. He and his wife Kay had become very friendly with me and my father, you know. And she said, ""Your father called. ""Stay out of Chicago. ""They're looking for you in Chicago."" She says, ""Come here to St. Louis."" Because I had worked the Chase Hotel there. Now I get ready to go to the bathroom with Kay, and my husband is left alone with Jim. Jim says, ""You know her father called."" He says, ""You hurt one hair on her head,"" and he banged the table, the whole table shook. Bobby was scared, so scared. We come out of the ladies room, you know, and I'm looking at him, and he's looking at me, and he's going ""Ohhhh..."" And when we got out of there and they said goodnight, we went up to the room and he says, ""I've never been through anything like that in my life."" He said, ""Thought for sure I was gonna get shot."" And we started on our honeymoon.  If I didn't care   More than words can say  If I didn't care Would I feel this way?  He said, ""This is a motel. ""We're going to find these all the way to the coast."" Now, I had never been to a motel. I didn't even know what they were.  Then maybe I'm wrong   But why do I lie awake all night   And dream all day... It's hard to explain. We didn't know what we were gonna do, how we were going to do, why we were gonna do.  Would it be the same?  Would my every breath... We just were very happy and stopped whenever we wanted to stop, stay overnight whenever we wanted to stay overnight.  And would I be sure  That this is love beyond compare   Would all this be true We had no idea what was in store for us. We just had a fantastic honeymoon. My father swore up and down that I was going to support my husband, which I never did. Never in a million years. He wasn't that kind of man. He had his own right, his own position and his own name. He was Bing Crosby's first trumpet player. Bing Crosby's show was incredibly popular. Next to Jack Benny, it was probably the most popular radio show on the air. And the way they opened that radio show was Bob... was the trumpet, solo trumpet. And if you could imagine yourself being sitting with a cold piece of brass like this, and you're called upon when somebody goes ""Now"" coast to coast, nationwide you played the theme, you started the theme all by yourself sort of like this.  Someone waits for me And then the show was on. Ladies and gentlemen, our first guest for this evening is a very charming young lady. Very talented too, a smash dynamite vocalist. Started out in show business, this girl, when she was just a baby. See apparently Bobby Guy, our trumpet player, is doing his best to give you some sort of a big send-off, Rose Marie. He must be a fan of yours or something. Well, I don't know how much of a fan he is, but he is my husband. I think anybody that ever put my father on a job knew that he had a special sound. And I can still hear it to this day. I know what records he's on. I know what movies he's on. It was unlike any other trumpet player in this town. Boy, he was something else. Jerry Lewis was a very good friend of my father's. Jerry had heard this one song called ""Too Late Blues."" My father does a solo on it, and it is the most exquisite piece of music you will ever hear a trumpet player play. Whenever my father was available, he was on a Jerry Lewis film. He was liked, and he was respected for who he was, what he was, and how he played. And he was... the best. Just the opposite of Rose Marie. He was a rock, an awfully sweet, sweet guy. He never strove to be like a star. He was quite happy showing up, playing the job, going home. I was out here in California, and I had done the Rudy Valle show. And somebody said, ""You've got to work at Slapsy Maxie's."" That wastheclub at that time. My husband says, ""You know you're going to have to do ""about an hour"" because I used to do about 30 minutes, 35 minutes, three or four songs, that was it. I said, ""Why?"" ""Because you're gonna be on all alone. ""There's gonna be no comic, gonna be no nothing, just you."" No female was doing comedy at that time. Nobody. And little by little I was doing comedy in my act, singing and getting more and more into comedy. My reviews opened up with ""She's someone to be reckoned with. ""This young lady with the beautiful gowns ""and the gorgeous hair and all this and that."" ""She's a hell of a performer."" I couldn't write a better review. I couldn't write one. And now everybody was calling to work and this and that. One night a guy came in who owned ""The Hollywood Reporter."" He said, ""Saw your show, we want you to open in Vegas."" I said, ""What's Vegas?"" He says, ""We want you to open with Xavier Cugat ""and Jimmy Durante."" I said, ""Jimmy! To work with Jimmy?! ""Oh my God, that would be wonderful!"" Jimmy Durante was a comedian who was a big star on television and made an awful lot of MGM movies.  Now you point your toe up  And then you fix your bow up  I used to do a little piece of Durante in my act.  Then you turn her... She did the best Durante of all.  You got to go round with a smile  And you'll be well-dressed all of the while   The real happy guy is in style  So go round and round and round and round  And wait a minute, wait a minute. Stop the music. Stop the music! And now I get ready for Vegas. Las Vegas as a city was nothing. It was desert, all desert. We had one cab driver on the whole strip. His name was Louie. And if you drank you didn't want to drive. So you hired Louie. The strip was just The El Rancho, The Last Frontier, The Desert Inn, and The Flamingo, that was it. And Vegas, as it exists today, is all because of The Flamingo. Gangster Bugsy Siegel and his partner Billy Wilkerson set out to build the highest class casino resort in the U.S. The Flamingo was an unbelievable thing to everybody. They were afraid of it. Neon lights and bright lights and this. It was like Monte Carlo. The rest was all sand. Ro opened The Flamingo. She opened it with... for Bugsy Siegel. Bugsy Siegel was very good to me. He was very sweet to me. His girlfriend, Virginia Hill, he called her ""The Flamingo."" That's why that club was called The Flamingo. Nobody knew that. A little secret. Bugsy thought of The Flamingo as a place in Vegas, and the mob loaned him two million dollars. And he kept saying ""I need more money"" because the locals took him for every dime he could get. They did everything wrong so they could fix it over again and do this and do that. So, the mob got mad and said, ""No more money."" The building costs soared to over six million dollars, all borrowed from the East Coast mob. Now his life literally depended on the success of this building. And everything depended on opening night. I was supposed to open tomorrow. It rains. One plane to Vegas does not take off. There's only one plane to Vegas then. In the morning, everybody was on that plane. Xavier Cugat, Abbe Lane, Tommy Wonder, Jimmy Durante. Despite the bad weather, the Hollywood elite showed up. Opening night, the place is jammed. Lana Turner, Clark Gable, Barbara Stanwyck. We had a hell of a crowd. The show was wonderful. It was brilliant. The next night they were all there again. The third night, they were gone. Everybody went back to California, and we worked to nine people. And, if you want to see something sad, you watch Jimmy Durante work to nine people. First week, I'm sitting in the coffee shop with the dancer, Tommy Wonder. We're having a cup of tea, and this man comes in, and ""Here's your check."" I look at my check, and there's $11 missing. I said, ""Wait a minute, psst! Come here, please. Sir! ""You took $11 out of my check. Tell me what's that for?"" Tommy Wonder, he's exhausted. He goes: ""Do you know who that was?"" And I said, ""No."" He says, ""That's Bugsy Siegel."" I said, ""Oh my God, ""they're gonna pick me up in an envelope."" ""How dare you talk to him like that."" I didn't know who he was. A few minutes later, he came back. He says, ""Here's your $11. I'm sorry about the mistake."" Sweetest man in the world. Little did she know that Bugsy lost $3,000 that first week. But he didn't give up. He bet it all on The Flamingo and was determined to see it succeed with Rose Marie as his star. One night, Bugsy Siegel came over to me and said, ""Here's $10,000. Go play some baccarat."" I said, ""I'm not a shill. I'm a performer."" ""Yeah, but if you get up there and start playing, ""maybe people will come to the table ""and start playing with you."" ""I don't do this."" He says, ""Do it for me."" I said, ""Okay."" I go over there, and sure enough playing with somebody else's money I won $25,000. And now the second show is gonna go, and I've got to go on. What do I do with this $25,000? I can't find him. Where the hell is he? I finally put the $25,000 down here, I do my second show. I come back, and he's sitting in the coffee shop there. I said, ""Where have you been?"" ""Mr. Siegel,"" I said, ""I am not a shill. ""Here's your damn money. Don't ever do this to me again."" And he laughed, he says, ""You'll be playing here quite a bit, you're all right."" I'll never forget that. He says, ""You're all right."" He says, ""And we'll be seeing you again."" I said, ""Thank you, Mr. Siegel, it's been a pleasure."" Got my check, and I left. And five days later he was killed. And then Bugsy had the last laugh because it was... he's still turning in his grave because it turned out to be quite... Look at Vegas today. Vegas today is unbelievable. So little by little they were building hotels, and every time they built a hotel one of the boys was behind it. All the guys from Cleveland, Moe Dalitz and Tucker Brothers and all those guys came in and took over. Thank goodness because they were the most wonderful guys in the world to work for. I can't tell you how terrific they were. You're working for the mob, the so-called mob. If you were a good kid and you didn't get out of line or drink or go after their women or gamble, the world was anything you wanted. You never paid for anything. Thank God for Vegas. Without Vegas, I don't know how I'd have raised my family. Each mob had their own area. And I played them all, and we became very good friends. They looked after me and thought I was the cat's meow. Once in a while, she would mention some of the tough guys she knew back then. Moe Sedgway, Doc Mangini, Jerry Maloney, Blackjack, Willie the Icepick. That's a good one. Killed with the ice pick like that. They treated her like a daughter. They didn't treat her like a girlfriend or somebody they're gonna have sex with. They treated her like somebody they were trying to protect and take care of and be good to. And I knew all of them and used to hang out with all of them. And but I always said I'm a Flamingo girl. Bugsy... his girlfriend Virginia Hill said to me ""Your show is wonderful, your gowns are beautiful."" I said, ""I have this very famous designer ""in New York that makes... he's a Frenchman. ""He's fantastic."" She said, ""They're gorgeous."" But she says, ""I think you should lose a little weight."" I said, ""Don't tell anybody, but I'm five months pregnant."" She says, ""You're kidding."" I said, ""No."" The gowns still fit, but I'm a little overweight. I say, ""As soon as I have the baby, I'll lose the weight."" In 1947, Rose Marie and Bobby welcomed a daughter, Georgiana Marie Guy, affectionately nicknamed Noopy. For a decade, Rose Marie traveled the United States headlining various nightclubs and theaters. I think my mother was on the road most of the time in my early years. Not typical behavior for a '50s housewife. So, when they could, her family came along. When I was about four years old, Sam Levinson called up my mother and said he would like to have me on the show. What's your mommy's name, darling? Rose Marie. Ladies and gentlemen, from the movies, from TV and from ""Top Banana,"" we bring you Rose Marie. So I got on national television, and I sang ""Top Banana."" I had a father that was a musician and a mother that was a singer, so I better have a good voice.  If you want to be a top banana  You got to start from the bottom of the bunch  You got to know the joke about the farmer's daughter  Take it in the kisser with the soda water   If you want to be... I wasn't Baby Rose Marie. I'll talk about ""Top Banana"" now. I got a call from Phil Silvers. In the late '50s, the army sitcom ""The Phil Silvers Show"" would make him a household name. But at this time he was just a character actor working for MGM. He says, ""I want you to do a Broadway show."" ""Phil, I live in California. ""I can't come here and live in New York ""with my husband and baby in California."" He says, ""They can come in and visit you. ""But you need a Broadway show. I want you to do this show. ""I want you to do this show, please."" I said, ""All right, send me a script."" I had wonderful numbers. The duet with Phil and myself, ""A Word A Day,"" stopped the show every night. We did the show. The show was a smash. The reviews came out, it was all about Phil. Not one of us got mentioned. Not one of us. I'm sitting at Sardi's very depressed. Marlon Brando comes over to me and says, ""What's the matter?"" I said, ""It didn't even mention me."" He says, ""I saw the show tonight. ""You were great. ""You stopped the show four times."" I said, ""I know, but they didn't even mention me."" He says, ""F 'em."" He says, ""You were great. ""I was there, remember that."" And he walked away. All that ""Top Banana"" hype earned Phil Silvers a Tony award for his performance and solidified the show as a hit. They made it into a movie when the show was very successful. Phil Silvers kept calling me. He says, ""I want you to do the movie."" What can I say? It was not good, period. That's just about the size of it. I had a producer that wanted to make fun and give me an offer, which I tried to refuse. It was a dirty offer. Want me to tell you? The producer comes over to me and says, ""I'll show you a few positions if you're interested."" And I said, ""Oh, that's funny. ""Oh yeah, you're wonderful, that's funny."" ""I'm serious, this could be your picture."" And in front of everybody I go, ""You couldn't get it up if a flag went by."" Which didn't sit too well with him. All my numbers were cut in the picture. There isn't one number of me in the picture. I think my mother's experience of doing the film of ""Top Banana"" pushed her away from wanting to do movies. Finally I decided I got to get into television. I got to do some television. That's the thing to do today. In 1950, only 9% of American households owned television sets. But by 1957 that number grew to 78%. What was first thought of as a novelty quickly became one of the most influential inventions in the history of entertainment. And they said, ""You've got to get an agent."" Jim Maloney, I go and see him with my reviews from Slapsy Maxie's. I'm a good actress, I do comedy. He says, ""Rose Marie Guy?"" And I said, ""No, no, just Rose Marie."" He says, ""Don't you want a last name?"" I said, ""Just Rose Marie. ""That's what everybody knows me by."" He says, ""Nobody knows you out here by that."" I said, ""They will. It's just Rose Marie."" I was the first one to have a one name thing. Now there's Cher, there's Liza, there's everything. I was the first one. So now he calls me one day, and he says, ""I've got a script for you."" ""Gunsmoke"" starring James Arness as Matt Dillon. I said, ""That's a very big show."" ""Yeah,"" he says, ""the part is Mrs. Monger."" Okay, I get the script, I read it. Monger... Mrs. Monger is 60 years old. I'm an adorable, white gloved cutie, and I'm going to play a 60 year old woman? Know damn well I'm not gonna get it. I know in my heart I'm not gonna get it. I figured, ""Well, my voice is low, I'll make it lower."" And the line in the script was ""Poorly, thank you."" I say... Poorly, thank you. He says, ""That's enough."" He says, ""Thank you."" I said, ""Okay."" And John Rich the director comes over to me, he says ""Would you mind cutting your nails?"" I say, ""What?"" He says, ""Would you mind cutting your nails?"" I said, ""Why?"" He said, ""I don't think a woman, a 60 year old woman ""sawing wood would have nails like that."" I said, ""You want me for this part?"" He says, ""I think you'll be great."" I said, ""Thank you,"" and I got the part. That was my first television show in California was ""Gunsmoke."" After ""Gunsmoke,"" Rose Marie found herself with a huge break. She landed the lead role in ""Just Off Broadway,"" a pilot produced to replace ""I LoveLucy's"" summer timeslot. All right, rise and shine, up and at 'em, let's go. There you go, up and at 'em, there you go. But it didn't get picked up. Then she guest starred on ""The Jackie Gleason Show,"" ""My Sister Eileen"" and""The Bob Cummings Show."" One day, I get a call from the casting office saying ""They want you down at Desilu's ""to see Danny Thomas."" I say, ""Ah, finally got it. ""Finally got the guest shot."" She says, ""No, this is for a new show ""called 'The Dick Van Dyke Show.'"" I say, ""What's a Dick Van Dyke?"" Nobody ever heard of me. So I went down there, and that's when I met Carl Reiner. So we're looking for a woman writer, and somebody said there's only one person to play this role, Rose Marie. And Carl said, ""I hear you're terrific."" I said, ""Yeah,"" I said, ""I'm pretty good, you know."" I said, ""May I ask what this is all about?"" Dick Van Dyke is a head writer on a comedy show. He goes and slaves away on that while Mary Tyler Moore stays at home and deals with that creepy kid. And Carl says it's about three comedy writers so forth and so on and so forth and so on. And I said, ""Who plays the third comedy writer?"" And I was thinking of a young guy like Mel Brooks. And I was thinking we've got to find a Mel Brooks. And Rosie said, ""There's only one guy who can play ""this other part,"" and she mentioned Morey Amsterdam. She cast him like that. I said, ""We're very friendly."" Morey wrote all the material for my act. We've been friends since I've been 11 years old. And I came home, and I called him, and I said, ""They're going to call you about a new show, ""new television show called 'The Dick Van Dyke Show.'"" He says, ""What's a Dick Van Dyke?"" I said, ""Your guess is as good as mine, but get out here."" Well, here comes two people I know you're gonna be crazy about. But don't go by me. I voted for Tom Dewey. Well, you know them as the co-stars of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie, I love you. Look at this sanitarium. Hey, how about that! Well, is this gorgeous? I think it was built by Frank Lloyd Wrong. I went along with her because Morey Amsterdam was the human joke machine. We knew about that. And through the years anytime we needed a one-liner he gave you 12 possibilities. This man can make a joke out of any word in the English language. Any word at all, come on. Any word, any word. Horse. I have a lady, she has a word. Horse. A joke about a horse? Horse, horse, let me see. If everybody owned a horse, the country would be more stabilized. He didn't even have to read. Neither one of us read. I was amazed at her comedy timing, she and Morey Amsterdam. I learned comedy from those two. When I saw what was happening in the first couple, I said, ""You know something, we've got a classic."" I knew it. It was a classic. Carl's writing and the direction, we just knew we had something that was better than most. You turned on purposely to see it every week. You believed those characters were real in spite of all the blocking and the beautiful lighting and how hot they were and how funny and charming. You truly believed that these people were your neighbors. You suspended that disbelief quite successfully. And that we're still trying to do. ""Big Bang Theory"" aspires to that immersion. When asked what am I most proud of in the history of my career as a performer, writer, I said ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" hands down. No question about it. People went crazy that worked with us because Carl's mind, Morey's mind, my mind, we kept finding changes that were better. Our rehearsals all week were really rewrites. We'd get on our feet and, of course, Rosie and Morey brilliant stuff came out of them. So the show was very different by the time we shot it than it was on the printed page. That's why people say, ""Was your show that much ad-lib?"" No, it wasn't ad-lib, it was scripted. But we would come up with things in the middle of it that they would shove in the script. We knew that as soon as Rosie put her foot down that we knew that scene was going to work. She was the flag pole. She was... She was so steady. She always had a way of saying, ""Wait for your laugh, ""wait for your laugh."" She always insisted that I would jump in too soon. Had to wait for my laugh. In all the years, and there was 158 shows, everybody blew a line. Everybody blew a thing, got in the wrong place, stood in the wrong place, said the wrong... Not Rose Marie. She never, ever blew a line. And nobody got mad at anybody. Nobody yelled at anybody. She got mad at me a couple of times. When there was something... Somebody had a beef, and I was supposed to go up as the star and talk to the producers about it, which I never did. And her nickname for me was the ""6 Foot Tower of Jell-O."" Whenever somebody had to, she would say, ""Send the 6 Foot Tower of Jell-O up there, ""he'll take care of..."" I mean, you can sit over there. How long do you want me to sit there? ""Go over there."" I'm not going over there. Never heard him say a bad word about anybody. He was a jellyfish. He could do anything. And he wouldn't say anything about it. I don't think he questioned anything we did. Even the script, I really don't think so. She kind of thought I was a spineless wimp when it came to that, which is true. Old blood and guts, there he goes. Hasn't got the guts to tell you. You had a certain amount of sympathy with her, you know, because she was in with all these guys, and it was a man's show in a sense. I think it's time we appreciated having a bright, attractive gal around the office. Yeah, when is she gonna start work here? How hard do you think it must have been on a day to day basis to be that singular performer in that singular role? It's like still hard to be a woman in a writer's room in real life, let alone playing that character. Here was this woman fighting for her position in the show and in real life. And she did it. She just mowed 'em down, and said, ""Sit over there and shut up."" It was really tough for women back then, especially for the character that Rosie did, because she was very masculine. When you look back on it, if that character weren't in it would we remember the show, would we study it? She didn't play the pretty girl, the sexy girl. Like a non-sex person. It had nothing to do with sex. Rose Marie is not sexualized. On the other hand, she hasn't been de-sexualized. She's constantly talking about dating and dating men, but she's not co-dependent. She's constantly talking about how ugly they are and what losers they are and these dates she's going on. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We made jokes about the fact that nobody took into account the fact that she was a lady. Hey, Mel, how about a little poker game Thursday night? Oh fine, who are the players gonna be? No women I hope. Nah! No, just buddies, me and Sally. Count on me. Morey Amsterdam won't help her lift a heavy typewriter. She's... chivalry is dead because she's one of the guys. Hey, buddy, give me a hand. Very funny, now will you help me, please? Come on, you're stronger than I am. Do it yourself, Mack. Rose Marie is the high status character in the room. You could admire her. You could want to be her. I would argue probably a lot of dudes maybe back then watched that show and were like ""I'm not really the Morey Amsterdam archetype, ""I'm really kind of the Rose Marie archetype."" I want to be a comedy writer, and it had nothing to do with gender, let alone all the women out there, the little girls watching that show that were like, ""Wait, that's a job? ""You can have that? You can be creative?"" After Lucille Ball, you didn't really come up with any women who were that strong. And the next niche was Rose Marie. When I got the show, I thought it was going to be Dick and me. I thought Mary was going to be a sideline. She thought the show was about comedy writers and that the whole show would take place there in the comedy writing office. And she didn't realize it was going to be also some home with Mary Tyler Moore and me. I do remember my mother coming home from doing the series and being upset because the show was shifting to Mary Tyler Moore. She would say, ""I have to fight for the office scenes."" When Rose Marie was offered the job, they said it's about writers in a writers' room. That's what they told her. They didn't tell her it's about a husband and wife who was also a writer. And my life, I wrote about my life. My life was really about my family. And Carl kept saying, ""No, no, it's Mary and Dick. ""You're the sideline."" I couldn't get over that. I didn't understand that. Because I was supposed to be co-starring. And, if you see the credits, it says ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" with Rose Marie, I'm the next one lined up. It's important to note that Mary Tyler Moore, the reason we all know that name is because of how incredible she looks, specifically on that film stock and that lighting. As soon as people started taking pictures and covers and cover of ""Look"" magazine, ""Life,"" it was Mary. Just the way it was in the office and home, Mary and Rosie hardly ever talked, I don't think. That was a little scary, you know. But it worked for the show. They weren't best buddies, so to speak. It was professional, how about that? It was professional. Rosie was always upset from the first year. She was always upset that she and Morey didn't have enough to do. I could hear both her sigh: ""Oh gee..."" You know, the mumbling, and wanting more to do. Only thing I said, ""I want more."" It finally got so bad that I had a talk with Rosie, and I said, ""Rosie,"" I said, ""you're the best one that could ever be doing this job, ""but if you can't stand the fact ""that the people, the audiences ""care more about Mary and Dick as I do ""I care more about my family than I do about my workers, ""and I write about that."" I write more deeply more that. I said, ""That's what the show is about. ""Unless you can accept that, don't come back. ""Please don't come back."" And I used real strong language. I said, ""You both have beautiful legs. ""They want to look at her legs."" Anyway, from then on we were fine. Dick came over to me and said, ""Does Bobby feel all right?"" I say, ""Why?"" He says, ""Because he's leaning up against a chair, ""and that's not like Bob."" I said, ""He's got a cold. He can't get rid of it."" We go home, it's getting worse. They were very, very close. He came to every show and watched every show. They were deeply in love. There was no question about it. They needed each other, they had each other, and they gave to each other. We went to this doctor. So he examines him, and he says, ""I'd like to examine it a little further,"" and Bobby says, ""I got to work."" He says, ""You can't. ""Call up Bing Crosby, and tell him you can't make it."" So I left him there. I went to work. The doctor called me and said, ""Your husband has hepatitis."" That was the going thing that year. Everybody got hepatitis. And Morey came over. Morey says, ""What's wrong?"" I said, ""He's sick. They don't know what's wrong. ""This guy, I don't like this doctor."" ""Wait a minute, just a minute. I'll call Jerry. ""He's got to have the best doctor."" He calls Jerry Lewis on the phone. Jerry says, ""Look, in five minutes ""a Dr. Levy is going to call you. ""You tell him what you just told me."" I said, ""Okay, thanks, Jerry."" He examined him, he says, ""He doesn't have hepatitis. ""I don't know what he's got,"" but he says ""It's some sort of blood infection."" Jerry called, and he told the doctors ""Do everything you can to help this man. ""He's a friend of mine, a very dear friend of mine."" I heard that, and they sent his blood all over the world, all over the world to find out what was wrong. And he was so thin. My father was always big. He was a stocky guy. And he got ill and slowly began to lose weight. And Bobby just wasted away. She was going through the worst experience anyone can go through, just slowly losing a loved one. But I was trying to do the show at the same time. And Rosie being a pro, because she is, managed to do that show. And you would never have known the difference. The minute that camera went on, she was the old Rosie. I had to. That was my job. That was my job. I couldn't let all those other people down. They would've folded up. Or would've kicked me off the show, which is worse. But we could see it was just killing her, especially the frustration, not even to know what's wrong with him. I was supposed to do the Carson show. I said, ""I can't do it. ""I'm in no mood to do another show. ""I'm lucky I'm doing this one."" So, word comes back to Carson, he says, ""I can't get a replacement. ""She's got to do the show."" You can get a replacement for Johnny Carson. Everybody in the world wanted to do that show. He says, ""I can't get a replacement. ""She's got to do the show."" Okay, I said, ""I'll try."" All of you if you watch television at all know our next guest. She's been on with me several times, and very big on the... I can mention the show. It's silly not to mention it, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" She has a major role, and she is delightful. Rose Marie. I go down there, and we do the show. Rosie is a fine performer. You break me up every time. We've done a lot of shows together. And we're a good audience for each other. Not... you know, we enjoy it when we work together. - Very much. - It was Pagliacci. She had to come and make people laugh, and she was crying all the time, you know, in the dressing room. Pagliacci... All about laughing while people while your insides are crying. It's easier to grin when your ship comes in and life is a happy lot, but the man that's worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts creep up in a knot. Get through, I kiss Johnny on the cheek. And he says, ""Do you feel any better?"" He says, ""I tried to get your mind off of it ""for a little while."" These are angels, these guys. Jerry Lewis, Dr. Levy, Johnny Carson they're angels to me. Dr. Levy brought Bobby home at one point, and Bobby was home for a little while, and he had to go back into the hospital. And he died in the hospital in 1964. He was 48 years old. The diagnosis was a blood infection. They don't know where it came from or why. And I miss him. We were both at our peaks in our careers. It just fell apart after he left. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do this. Get me on the subject of my husband, I can't help it, sorry. Oh yeah, that was a great marriage. It was a great love affair. Yeah, they really adored each other. When he passed, she started wearing the bow for Bobby. Two things never happened after Bobby died. She never married again. And she never wore a bow in her hair that wasn't black. Two years after Bobby died, Rose Marie had to say another goodbye. With 158 shows in the can, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" came to an end. I said at the very beginning, I said, ""We'll go as far as we go while we ""while it's still fresh."" And in the fifth year I kept seeing repetition in story ideas and everybody itching to go places. Dick Van Dyke had already done ""Mary Poppins,"" and the movies were running after him. Mary went off to go to Broadway. And I said, ""We all have some place..."" I was starting to do feature movies. And I said, ""Let's go out strong. ""We'll just go out with strong shows."" We were all heartbroken. I was just sick. That combination and the chemistry. Mary and I almost became mind readers. And it was such... it was an improv. We were an improv group. And I just hated to see a team like that break up. It just made me so sad because I've never had that experience since, that kind of wonderful tight involvement that we had. I hated to see it end. We were devastated. But we finished because Carl was afraid that we were dried up. I said, ""We haven't done one in color."" We could go another two years in color. And that's how the show ended. We were very sad, all of us. I always wondered. She was as good as Lucille Ball or Carol Burnett. She should've had her own show at one time I think. My husband had passed away. I didn't want to do anything. I didn't want to sing, I didn't want to talk. I wanted to be left alone. Starring in a big television show is very different today. Each main cast member generally gets a share of the profits. ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" had a residual schedule then of after six showings there are no more residuals. Meaning Rose Marie hasn't made money off ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" in over 50 years. She had always worked because she loved it. But now, as a single mother, Rose Marie needed to work. Mary Markham who was booking ""Hollywood Squares"" called me up and said, ""I want you to do this show. ""All you got to do is sit up there and talk."" Well, that didn't seem too hard. Rose Marie was no stranger to the game show genre. In the late '50s, she was the first female game show host in history. The program was called ""Scoop The Writers."" Before have Wendell to explain how our little game plays, I should like to introduce you three boys. Boys! These guys were boys when Madame Butterfly was a worm. But at the same time the popular quiz ""Twenty One"" was discovered to be rigged and put under Congressional investigation. Most networks cancelled their game shows. Our celebrity and comedy-driven ""Hollywood Squares"" brought the game show back into the American living room. They got Peter Marshall who was the best that ever happened. And he's still the best. He knew when to coach you on, he knew when to stop you. He knew when to lead you. He was wonderful. - Listen, Ro. - All right, Peter. Please, we must move along here. People have to win cash and prizes. According to ""Dear Abby,"" is there a law that can force a man to marry a woman? Yes, and I think it's called a mother-in-law. I thought it was going to be a 13 week show, to be frank with you. Then of course I ran 16 years. So, you never know what's gonna happen in this business. I was with the show 14 years. And, for some reason or other, I was just there. Nobody ever said ""Go home."" I was just there. I never knew any of the jokes. All I had was the questions. Important: We were never told what the questions were going to be. And nobody was told anything except be funny, do your best. And we couldn't even pass the people in the hallway of NBC. We didn't... they didn't want us to talk to any contestants because of the scandal that they had. So they were very careful. It's the easiest thing I ever did. Oh God, it was fun. It was just fun. It was like a party. And you got paid wonderfully well for this. And it left you open to be able to work Vegas or whatever you wanted to do. Then I was lucky enough to go to ""The Doris Day Show."" Now Doris had just lost her husband. And I had just lost mine. And I thought, ""God, we have something in common ""to begin with."" It's going to be cry on whose shoulder, you know? And I went into rehearsal, and she was just unbelievable. She was... she's the greatest lady I've ever known or worked with. For some reason or other, I have never stopped in this business. After I got through doing a play, and there were no plays to do I'd get into something else. I would do my concert act, you know, in concert. If there wasn't enough places around to do that, I would get into television again. And if there wasn't enough television going on I would make personal appearances. I always went from one thing to the next. Rose Marie's role on ""The Doris Day Show"" only lasted three seasons. My mother's at home. She's not working. She's calling her manager every day going ""Why aren't I working? ""I'm not doing anything. Get me a damn job."" Out of this persistence, her manager says, ""Well, I'm working on something."" 4 Girls 4take one. 4 Girls 4was a strange combination of people. Rose Marie, Rosemary Clooney, Helen O'Connor, Margaret Whiting. Four big egos. They were each stars in their own right, in their time, but it had been 15 or 20 years since anyone had been performing onstage making that kind of noise again. I thought, ""Who the hell is gonna pay money ""to go see four old broads up there on a stage ""singing with a band?"" Yeah, at their age, but they didn't move like their age. Miraculously, it caught on right away. They started to play these theaters and these venues that were huge. And they're sold out. They're sold out! It was selling out week after week after week. They were selling to 15,000 people a show. You know, they were... they were rock stars. You've got to be kidding me. The audiences loved them. I mean, it was standing ovation time. And what was going on backstage? Chaos. Oh, the egos were at it, fighting, fighting, fighting. Frankie Ortega, my conductor, he goes with the show, or I don't go. My mother took charge of the show. I was the one that put the finale together. She had to have a closing number. Learn this, we're going to do this for the finale. You do this, you come out here, you do this, you do that. Oh, come on, Frank. Hold it, Frank. Hold it, Frank! Frank! Frank. Hold it. Hold it, you don't seem to understand. See that part I go, ""Smiley face..."" You're not supposed to play in there, see, because I'm going to the next phrase, and if you're playing that while I'm singing the next phrase it's not going to sound good, and they're gonna think I can't sing, see. So you don't play anything. That's all me. Was she stubborn? Was she sweet all the time? Was she a pain in the ass? She was all of those things. She was no pushover, that's for sure. She could be the sweetest, most loving person, but you don't want to cross Rose Marie. She'll cut your head off. I was the production manager, and I had to do the lights and the sound and the touring things. But I also had to act as the, you know, as the peacemaker. They carried piles of luggage, and everybody had piles of music and piles of costumes. - Hold Rose Marie's bag. - Sure. Oh, geez! Rose Marie, is this your bag? What do you have rocks in here? That's just my hair brushes. And piles of ego. Helen wasn't that nice. She was a troublemaker. I love show business. You love it before? - Or you go out you love it? - I adore it. Helen, when you get out there, do you love it? - No. - When do you love it? Never! I love music. I don't like to perform. She thought she owned4 Girls 4. And she hated me because I was the one that made all the suggestions, and they were taken. I think it's safe for me now to say this. I haven't said it to anybody before. But walking across the street in New York City one day with Margaret Whiting, Margaret said to me and this was a woman that always spoke well of people. I mean, she was a gentle, gentle soul, a loving soul. And she said to me, ""I just want to pull all of Helen's nails out ""and hold her hands over fire."" There were times we wouldn't talk to one another for days. And one time she got in with me for some reason or another. And Clooney says, ""Well, you know how she is."" Clooney and I got along great. Rose Marie and Rosemary had a camaraderie like nobody else. They spoke the same language. They both slept till the middle of the afternoon. They both stayed out late at night. I mean, they were party girls. They were a lot of fun. We knew what we had. We knew that something was good happening to us. And we were very proud of it because every one of us was good, you know. Even Helen. For Rose Marie, it was a wonderful thing because she hadn't been doing that much. And she needed something like that. She... there was no place to perform anymore. Where you gonna perform? You have understand that on the business end these women before4 Girls 4 were probably, you know, a thousand dollar act on their own. When they did4 Girls 4, their numbers grew to such a point where they were making tens of thousands of dollars. And then tens of thousands of dollars each week and then times 38 weeks. So, the income level for women in that situation was quite extraordinary. I kept saying to them ""You know how lucky we are ""at this stage of our life?"" Rose Marie's always anxious about work. Any performer is as good as their last show. When you finish one show, you've got to start again. You've got to go find another show whether it's a show, a recording, a television thing. Whatever it is, you have to go find a new one. Well, that's not easy. I mean, work supersedes everything, always has. I don't want to say it's a drug, but I think in her case it's a drug. It's something that she has to do all the time. She's never stopped working, ever, ever. From the time she was a child, she has never stopped. I've literally seen her get on the phone and call Aaron Spelling, and she says ""I'm not working this week,"" and the following week she has a ""Love Boat."" My resume reads four pages, you know, of just episodic guest shots. I've done all the big shows. She did a couple of ""Murphy Browns."" ""Caroline in the City,"" ""Suddenly Susan,""""Wings."" But it was getting to the parts of playing pain in the ass mother-in-laws that were mean or whatever. She became a ""character actress."" This is your woman, huh? Hey! Dainty little miss, ain't she? When Gus van Sant decided to remake ""Psycho,"" he needed somebody to play the mother. And who did he get? Don't you touch me! Don't, Norman! Put me down! And I'll walk on my own! As her daughter, I thought it was typecasting. Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?! Jesus, scared the hell out of me. I saw her do some of the character parts where she played all the people. She'd do it wonderful. She was great. But there weren't enough of them. The last thing that she did was a voice playing a witch in a Garfield cartoon. I'm free, free from the prison of that dusty old book! And she absolutely loved doing that, loved it. And she was ""working"" again, she was working. And she was a different person when she did that. Even though she was willing to play character parts and play old people, it was hard for her to get work. The frustration of her not working is... is huge. Of course, she wants to work. She really does want to work. I feel strange that I'm left. Why am I left? I don't... I can't do anymore. I can't do anything. What can I do? Go out and do a show again? Ro, you know, physically is not she can't run around the block. But mentally she's as good as ever. She has told me that she'll lay in bed, and she will go over her act in bed just... just doing it. And that ""Is there a way that I can come out in a wheelchair and do my act?"" And it's a horrible feeling when you when your mind is working and your body refuses to be with you. Now we're contemporaries. I can still play a little golf. I can still run, I can walk. So I work, you know. I've been on the radio for many, many years. ""Music of Your Life."" I've been doing it for like 25 years. And I still do a lot of stuff with PBS. So I'm busy. I'm one of the lucky guys. I've had a 70 year career, and still I just made a movie in February. So it's... and I'm not about to retire. Too much fun. Look, I'm 92, and I'm writing my fourth my third, maybe my fifth biography, believe it or not. I may be the oldest writer ever to have written novels and, this way, biographies. I miss my career. I'd give $1,000 to do my act right now and show them how it's done because nobody does a good act anymore. They smell, all of them. And I want to go out on the stage and show 'em. That's being conceited. But I'm good, I know I'm good. She's been overlooked in a lot of areas. She's had multiple Emmy nominations. She's always lost out to someone who passed away that same year. Huge joke in the industry. You don't want to be nominated opposite Rose Marie, or your life may be in peril. She's an aggressive woman, but she's never been aggressive in pursuing awards. And in this industry you have to because you have to nominate... You have to put yourself in for an Emmy. You have to put yourself out there. And she's never been aggressive in pursuing acknowledgement for her work whereas there are a lot of performers who do. The last time I saw Ro I represented her when she won the Shirley Temple Award. And I said if anybody should win the Shirley Temple Award it should be Rose Marie because Ro was to radio and Vaudeville what Shirley Temple was to motion pictures. She started out when she was three years of age. You know, the award tonight is the Shirley Temple Award, probably the greatest child star of all time in motion pictures. And Rose Marie was three years old in radio, probably the greatest child star radio ever had. She was the biggest singing star in America, and she introduced hit after hit after hit. And then she went on to nightclubs, and her life is... I mean, she worked with people like Joey Lewis and the Ritz Brothers and Milton Berle when she was a kid, when she was a kid with all these people. She used to work for, seriously, Al Capone. That's not a joke. And I'm just so proud to have her as my buddy and my friend. And I'm very proud to be able to present to her the Shirley Temple Award. I have no idea where the award is. The Shirley Temple Award was created to acknowledge an individual who was able to make a transition from child star, in her case Baby Rose Marie, to adult star with ease and with recognition, constantly working. She never stopped. She's one of the very few that continued to work, didn't just stop. Is this on? It's on, it's on. Yeah, it's on, it's on.  Gotta dance Thank you. Thank you, Peter. You can sit down now. Thank you. What a wonderful group you people are to do this and to give it to me. I mean, Shirley Temple was something very special. I was going to tell you all about her, but somebody else did that. I was going to tell you about me, but Peter did that. So I have nothing to say except I hope the salad's good. I think... you know, I'm so used to telling a joke that I've got to tell you a joke. This guy dies and goes to heaven, and he goes and he says to St. Peter ""I want to see the Lord."" St. Peter says, ""I have to talk to the Lord."" Goes to the Lord, he says, ""There's a guy out here ""who wants to see you."" He says, ""Go back and ask him what he did."" Goes back to the guy, the guy says, ""What did you do out there?"" ""Well, I gave an old man a dollar once."" ""That's good."" Goes back to the Lord, he says, ""Man says he gave him a dollar once."" ""Ask him what else he did."" Goes back he says, ""Peter, you've got to find out ""from the Lord what else did you do."" ""I gave an old lady a dollar once."" Goes back to the Lord, and he says, ""Gave an old lady a dollar once. What will I do?"" Lord looked at him, he said, ""Tell you what, ""give him his two bucks back, and tell him to go to hell."" I thought I'd leave 'em laughing. Oh, I love those Irish songs, they're so... You should only know what that means. Just play the notes. Don't dilly dally around. Just play the notes.  Lazy Mary, will you get up  She answered back that ""I'm not able""   Lazy Mary, you've got to get up  Because we need the sheets for the table   Oh la la  Get up, we need the sheets  Oh la la Get up, we need the sheets   There is a cow down on our farm   She's young young and tricky  That's a cow? Lots of luck.  But last night she ran away with a bull   And now she's a Bolsheviki   Oh la la Going to get better as we go along.  Oh la la She is a Bolsheviki   Spaniards have their native wine   And the Germans have their beer   The Irish drink their whiskey straight   Because it brings them cheer  The English drink an awful lot   Because it brings on dizziness   We Americans have no choice at all   We drink that whole darn business   Oh la la Watch Movies, TV Series & Live Sports www.admitme.app"
