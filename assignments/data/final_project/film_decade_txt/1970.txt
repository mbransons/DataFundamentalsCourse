"They've killed the boy! They've killed young Paolo! They've killed your son Paolo! Murderers! Murderers! My son... All my respect, Don Ciccio. You killed my husband because he wouldn't give in to you. And his oldest son Paolo... ...because he swore revenge. But Vito is only nine. And dumb-witted. He never speaks. It's not his words I'm afraid of. He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone. But when he grows, he'll grow strong. Don't worry. This little boy can't do a thing to you. When he's a man, he'll come for revenge. I beg you, Don Ciccio, spare my only son. He's all I have left. I swear to God he'll never do you any harm. Spare him! Vito, run! Move and I'll kill him! Run, Vito! Kill him! Any family who hides the boy Vito Andolini will regret it! You understand? Anybody who hides the boy Vito Andolini is in for trouble! Vito, we're praying for you! If anyone is hiding the boy Vito Andolini... ...turn him over to us. Don Ciccio will thank you for it! It'll be better for the boy, and better for you! Any family who hides the boy Vito Andolini will regret it! Nurse. Money? Interpreter! Where are you from? -What is your name? -Maria. What is your name? Come on, son. What is your name? Vito Andolini from Corleone. Corleone. Vito Corleone. Okay, over there. Next. Tell him he has smallpox. Quarantine three months. Vito Corleone! Here he is. This is him. Did you bring the car keys? Laurie! Laurie! Mama! -Look who's here. -Father Carmelo. -This is Father Carmelo. -I'm Merle Johnson. Mama! -Here I am. -Constanzia, after one week? I sent the car to the airport last week to pick you up. It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just one week late. This is for my mama! -What is this? -You remember Merle? Hello. How are you? Thank you. Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him and I can't wait on line. You go see your children first. Then you worry about waiting on line to see your brother. Like everybody else. Ladies and gentlemen... A most distinguished guest would like to say a few words. Please welcome Senator Pat Geary of the State of Nevada. And there is Mrs. Geary. Thank you very much. This is a very, very happy day for me and my wife Mrs. Geary. We see Nevada far too seldom. But today we can join with old friends, we can make new friends and we help celebrate a young man's first Communion. And also to thank that boy's family for a magnificent contribution to the State. I have here in my hand a check made out to the university and it is a magnificent endowment in the name of Anthony Vito Corleone. The check is signed by that young man's parents whom I think we should recognize. Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please. Let the folks see you! Folks, I want you to join me in giving a real Nevada thank you to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone! We also have, as a special added attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir who have chosen a certain special song and a special arrangement to honor their host, Mr. Michael Corleone. Boys. The plaque. Okay, fellows, did you get that one? Okay, that's good. Now, Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone. My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary. He arranged everything through your man Turnbull. -Yes, yes. -Sit down. I thought that you and I would talk alone. I trust these men with my life, Senator. To ask them to leave would be an insult. Well, it's perfectly all right with me but I am a blunt man and I intend to speak very frankly to you. Maybe more frankly than anyone in my position has ever talked to you before. The Corleone family has done well in Nevada. You own, or control, two major hotels in Vegas and one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in so there was no problem with the Gaming Commission. Now my sources tell me that you plan to make a move against the Tropigala. They tell me that within a week, you're going to move Klingman out. Quite an expansion. However, it will leave you with a little technical problem. The license will still be in Klingman's name. -Turnbull is a good man. -Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit. I don't want to spend more time here than I have to. You can have the license. The price is 250,000 dollars. Plus five per cent of the gross monthly of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone. The price for the license is less than 20,000 dollars, right? That's right. -Why would I pay more than that? -Because I intend to squeeze you. I don't like your kind of people. I don't like to see you come out to this clean country in oily hair dressed up in those silk suits and try to pass yourselves off as decent Americans. I'll do business with you, but the fact is that I despise your masquerade, the dishonest way you pose yourself and your whole fucking family. Senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy. But never think it applies to my family. All right, all right. Some people have to play little games. You play yours. Let's say that you'll pay me because it's in your interest. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. One more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on you deal with Turnbull. Open that door, son. Senator, you can have my answer now if you like. My offer is this... Nothing. Not even the fee for the gaming license, which I would like you to put up. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Ladies! I didn't know you were out here. -Honey, we have to go. -Really? I'm sorry. -It's been delightful. -It was our pleasure. It was wonderful talking to you. Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch, you look great! Frank Pentangeli! I thought you was never coming out west, you big bum! I've got to check on my boys. -What's with the food here? -What's the matter? A kid gives me a Ritz cracker with chopped liver and says, ""canaps. I said, ""Can of peas, my ass. That's a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"" Bring out the peppers and sardines! Seeing you reminds me of New York in the old days! You remember Willi Cicci, who was with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn? We were all upset about that. Heart attack, huh? No, that was no heart attack. That's what I'm here to see your brother Mike about. -But what's with him? -What do you mean? Do I have to get a letter of introduction to get a sit-down? -You can't get in to see Mike? -He's got me waiting in a lobby! -Johnny Ola. -Al Neri. -Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen? -I remember Tom from the old days. Rocco. -What's this? -It's an orange from Miami. Take care of Johnny's men. They look like they might be hungry. Johnny? Tom won't stay. He only handles specific areas of the business. Sure, Mike. -What are you drinking, Johnny? -Anisette. -If you need anything, I'll be outside. -Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom. -I just left Mr. Roth in Miami. -How is his health? It's not good. Can I do anything or send anything? He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect. That casino... Registered owners. Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys. The real owners are the old Lakeville Road group and our friend in Miami. Klingman runs it and owns a piece of it too, but I've been instructed to tell you that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along. It's very kind of him. Tell him it's greatly appreciated. Hyman Roth always makes money for his partners. One by one, our old friends are gone. Death, natural or not, prison, deported... Only Hyman Roth is left, because he always made money for his partners. I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional musicians there isn't one Italian! Let's have a tarantella! You! Up, up, up! Questa mano! What the hell have we here? -I'll see my sister alone. -It concerns me too. May I stay? How are you, honey? You've met Merle, he was with me in Vegas. -I saw him with you. -Could I have a drink? Al, please get him a drink! We're going to Europe. I'd like to book passage on The Queen. Why don't you go to a travel agent? We're getting married first. The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet, and you're getting married? You see your children on weekends. Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno for a theft you don't even know about. You fly around the world with men who use you! -You're not my father! -So why come to me? I need money. Connie, Connie, Connie... I want to be reasonable with you. Why don't you stay with the family? You can live on the estate with your kids. You won't be deprived of anything. I don't know this Merle. I don't know what he does or what he lives on. Tell him marriage is out of the question and you don't want to see him anymore. He'll understand, believe me. Connie. If you don't listen to me and marry this man, you'll disappoint me. -Famiglia! -Cent' anni! What's ""Chen dannay""? ""Cent' anni"". It means 100 years. It means we should all live happily for 100 years. The family. -It would be true if my father were alive. -Connie. Hey... Merle, you've met my sister-in-law, Deanna. -Fredo's wife. -My pleasure. With all respect, I didn't come here to eat dinner! I know, I know. -I just want to dance! -You're falling all over the floor. You're just jealous because he's a real man! -I'm going to belt you right in the teeth. -You couldn't belt your mama! These Dagos are crazy when it comes to their wives. Michael says that if you can't take care of this, I have to. -I think you'd better. -Never marry a Wop. They treat their wives like shit! I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't! What are you doing to me, you big slob? Help! Fredo! -I can't control her, Mikey. -You're my brother, don't apologize. Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers three territories after he died. You took over and didn't give it to them. I welched. Clemenza promised them lu cazzo. He promised them nothing. -He hated them more than I do. -Frankie, they feel cheated. You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains and you're drinking... -What's he drinking? -Champagne. Champagne cocktails, and passing judgment on how I run my family. Your family's still called Corleone. And you'll run it like a Corleone. My family doesn't eat here, doesn't eat in Las Vegas... ...and doesn't eat in Miami... ...with Hyman Roth! You're a good old man and I like you. You were loyal to my father for years. The Rosato brothers are taking hostages. They spit right in my face, all because they're backed up by that Jew in Miami. I know. That's why I don't want them touched. -Not touched? -No, I want you to be fair with them. You want me to be fair with them? How can you be fair to animals? Tom, listen. They recruit spics, they recruit niggers. They do violence in their grandmothers' neighborhoods! And everything with them is whores! And junk, dope! And they leave the gambling to last. I want to run my family without you on my back. I want those Rosatos dead! -No. -Morte. I have business that's important with Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed. Then you give your loyalty to a Jew before your own blood. You know my father did business with Hyman Roth. He respected him. Your father did business with Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth, but he never trusted Hyman Roth or his Sicilian messenger boy, Johnny Ola. You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired, and I'm a little drunk! I want everybody here to know, there's not going to be no trouble from me! Don Corleone. Cicci, the door... You want him to leave now? Let him go back to New York. I've already made my plans. The old man had too much wine. It's late. How's the baby? -Sleeping inside me. -Does it feel like a boy? Yes, it does, Michael. Kay? I'm sorry about all the people today. Bad timing. It couldn't be helped, though. It made me think of what you once told me. ""In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate."" That was seven years ago. I know. I'm trying, darling. Did you see this? Why are the drapes open? Kay, are you all right? -Are you hit? -No. It's all right. Stop! Stop! Halt! They're still on the property. Please stay inside. -Keep them alive. -We'll try. Alive! Stay by the door. Yeah, come in. -Mike, are you all right? -Yeah. There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. And I know that's upset you in the past. You felt it was because of some lack of trust or confidence. But it's because I admire you and love you that I kept things secret from you. Now you're the only one I can trust. Fredo? Well, he's got a good heart. But he's weak and he's stupid, and this is life and death. Tom, you're my brother. I always wanted to be thought of as a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother. I know that. You're going to take over. You're going to be the Don. If what I think has happened, has happened, I'm leaving here tonight. I give you complete power. Over Fredo and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone. I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife and my children, the future of this family. -If we catch them, will we find out... -We won't catch them. Unless I'm very wrong, they're dead already. They were killed by somebody close to us. Inside. Very, very frightened that they botched it. You don't think that Rocco and Neri had something to do with this? See... All our people are businessmen. Their loyalty is based on that. One thing I learned from Pop was to try to think as people around you think. On that basis, anything is possible. Mike, they're dead! Right outside my window! I want to get out of here. They're lying there dead! Over here! There's two of them. Looks like they were hired out of New York. I don't recognize them. Won't get anything out of them now. Fish them out. Get rid of the bodies. -Where's Mike? -Rocco. Anthony, everything is going to be all right. Try to sleep. -Did you like your party? -I got lots of presents. I know. Did you like them? Yeah. I didn't know the people who gave them to me. Well, they were friends. -Did you see my present for you? -It was on my pillow. I'm going to be leaving very early tomorrow. -Will you take me? -No, I can't, Anthony. -Why do you have to go? -I have to do business. I could help you. I know. Some day you will. Get some sleep. She's really beautiful. You've got to see her. Wait till you see her. Words can't describe her. I left Naples. I left Mama. For a no-good tramp! Now here I am in America, in New York. Alone! Thinking of my mother. Without news from home. Finally, a letter from Naples! Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? She's very beautiful. To you, she's beautiful. For me, there's only my wife and son. Our dear mother - ...is dead! We'll go backstage later and take her to eat. Sit down, you bum! Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci. We'll go see her backstage. Who was that? The Black Hand. That's Fanucci...the Black Hand. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Tomorrow! Always tomorrow! You'll pay me today! Let's go. Not my daughter! Let her go! Here, take all my money! Vito, come on. I know what you're thinking. But you don't know how things are. Fanucci's with the Black Hand. The whole neighborhood pays him. Even my father, in the grocery store. If he's Italian... ...why does he bother other Italians? He knows they have nobody to protect them. Forget that. Did you like my angel? If you're happy, I'm happy. Don't you feel well? Is your boss treating you all right? Forget it. Hey, you speak Italian? Hide this for me! Next week I'll come and get it! Abbandando, meet my nephew! How's business? It's good, it's good. Fanucci's mad. Says the neighborhood's getting sloppy. People don't pay on time, don't pay the full amount. Says he's been too nice to everyone. So Fanucci's changing? Sure. He wants double from everybody. Even from my father. I'm a friend, right? So you'll let him work here? I've got some bad news. I feel rotten about telling you this... But Fanucci...he's got a nephew... And you have to give him my job. You've always been good to me, ever since I came here. You looked after me like a father. I thank you. And I won't forget it. Vito! Oh, no! Take this to your family. Thanks anyway. But please, I can't accept. What a nice pear! I'm Clemenza, you still have my goods? Did you look inside? I'm not interested in things that don't concern me. A friend of mine has a nice rug. Maybe your wife would like it. Sure she would. But who has money for a rug? It would be a present. I know how to return a favor. Yeah, sure. My wife would like it. That son of a bitch! He isn't home! Damn, he didn't even leave the key. Well, he won't mind. Come on in. Hey, Vito, come on in! This is your friend's place? This is a real palace. One of the best. Vito, give me a hand, will you? Look how pretty it is, Santino! Come on in. It's all right. Hyman's in there. -Would you like a tuna sandwich? -No, thank you. ...pick up of two by Holden. Second and eight for S.C... -Mr. Roth? -Come in, Michael. Sit down, make yourself comfortable. It's almost over. -Do you follow the football game? -Not for a while I haven't. I enjoy watching football in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country. Baseball too. Ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series in 1919. I heard you had some trouble. Stupid. People behaving like that with guns. The important thing is you're all right. Good health is the most important thing. More than success, more than money. More than power. I came here because there's going to be more bloodshed. I wanted you to know, so another war won't start. Nobody wants another war. Frank Pentangeli asked my permission to get rid of the Rosato brothers. When I refused he tried to have me killed. He was stupid, I was lucky. I'll visit him soon. The important thing is that nothing interferes with our plans for the future. Nothing is more important. -You're a wise and considerate man. -And you're a great man, Mr. Roth. -There's much I can learn from you. -Whatever I can do to help, Michael. -Excuse me. Lunch. -Come in. -Thank you, my dear. -You're going to break your eardrums. -Enjoy it. -Thank you. You're young, I'm old and sick. What we'll do in the next few months will make history. It's never been done before. Not even your father would dream that such a thing could be possible. Frank Pentangeli is a dead man. You don't object? He's small potatoes. What's up? We got company? What's going on? Michael Corleone is here. Where is he? He's in your den. You better hurry. He's been waiting a half hour. Is something wrong? I wish you would have let me know you were coming. -I could have prepared something. -I didn't want you to know. -You heard what happened? -I almost died. We were so relieved... In my home! In my bedroom where my wife sleeps! Where my children come to play. In my home. I want you to help me take my revenge. Michael, anything. What can I do? Settle these troubles with the Rosato brothers. I don't understand. I don't... I don't have your brain for big deals. But this is a street thing. That Hyman Roth in Miami. He's backing up those sons-of-bitches. -I know he is. -So why ask me to lay down to them? It was Hyman Roth that tried to have me killed. I know it was him. Jesus Christ, Mike. Jesus Christ, let's get them all. Now while we've got the muscle. This used to be my father's old study. It's changed. I remember there used to be a big desk here. I remember when I was a kid. We had to be quiet when we played near here. I was very happy that this house never went to strangers. First Clemenza took it over. Now you. My father taught me many things here. He taught me in this room. He taught me, ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still good. That's what I want him to think. I want him relaxed and confident in our friendship. Then I'll be able to find out who the traitor in my family was. -Yeah? -Fredo, this is Johnny Ola. -We need some more help. -Johnny? Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it? -Who's that, honey? -Listen good, Fredo. Why are you calling me? I don't want to talk to you. Pentangeli is going to accept the Rosato brothers' deal. -Oh, God. -Will he come alone? I don't know. You've got me in deep enough already. Everything will be all right. Pentangeli says he's willing to make a deal. All we want to know is if he's on the level, or if he'll bring his boys. You lied to me. I don't want you to call me anymore. -Your brother won't find out we talked. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Who was that? -Wrong number. -Frankie, I've got nobody here. -Wait in the car, Cicc'. -Frankie. -That's okay, Cicc'. -What's this? -A lucky C note for our new deal. Ritchie. Give us a taste. We were all real happy about your decision, Frankie. -You won't regret it. -I don't like the C note, Rosato. I take that as an insult. Michael Corleone says hello! Close the door! Your friend the cop... Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here. Are you open or closed? I just came in to clean up a little, you know? What's the matter? -Is that something on the floor? -Carmine, not here! Anthony! You open this bar and I'll blow your head in! Freddy, it's good to see you. -How is he? -He's okay. He's in the back. Girls, take a hike. In this room here. -I want to talk to him alone first. -Come on. I thought I could help you, Senator. Hagen? -Listen, I did not... -It's all right. -I didn't do anything. -It's okay. You're very lucky. My brother Fredo operates this place. He was called before anyone. Had this happened some place else, we couldn't have helped you. When I woke up, I was on the floor. -And I don't know how it happened. -You can't remember? I passed out. Just a game. Jesus. Jesus, Jesus! Jesus God! God! I don't know, and I don't understand why I can't remember. Doesn't matter, just do as I say. Put in a call to your office. Explain that you'll be there tomorrow. You decided to spend the night at Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe. -As his guest. -I do remember that she was laughing. We'd done it before, and I know that I could not have hurt that girl. This girl has no family. Nobody knows that she worked here. It'll be as though she never existed. All that's left is our friendship. -Yes? -Sorry, but we're not to let you through. -I'm just going to the market. -We'll pick up anything you want. -Whose orders are these? -Mr. Hagen's. He's coming. I'll speak to him. I wanted to explain, but I had business in Carson City. It's Michael's request for your safety. We'll get anything you need. -So I'm supposed to stay in my house? -No, within the compound will be fine. -We were going to New England. -That's off. -Am I a prisoner? -That's not how we see it, Kay. Come on, kids. We're going back to the house. Joe. Cuba, Cuba! Most respected gentlemen. Welcome to Havana. I want to thank this distinguished group of American industrialists for continuing to work with Cuba for the greatest period of prosperity in her entire history. Mr. William Shaw, representing the General Fruit Company. Messrs. Corngold and Dant, of United Telephone and Telegraph Company. Mr. Petty, Regional Vice President of the Pan American Mining Corporation. Mr. Robert Allen of South American Sugar. Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada, representing our associates in tourism and leisure activities. And my old friend and associate from Florida, Mr. Hyman Roth. I would like to thank United Telephone and Telegraph for their Christmas gift. A solid gold telephone. Perhaps you gentlemen would like to look at it. -Mr. President? -Yes? Could you discuss the rebel activity and what this can mean to our businesses? -Of course. -Heavy stuff. I assure you that, although the rebels have started a campaign in Las Villas, my staff indicates, with assurance, that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara before the New Year. I want to put you all at ease. We will tolerate no guerrillas in the casinos or the swimming pools. He said that they're making an arrest, and in a few minutes he'll let us through. Johnny... It's nothing. Just some lousy bandits. The police are cleaning them up. Viva Fidel! I hope my age is correct. I'm always accurate about my age. Make sure that everybody sees the cake before we cut it. I'm very pleased you're all able to come from such distances to be with me today. When a man comes to this point in his life, he wants to turn over the things he's been blessed with. Turn them over to friends, as a reward for the friends he's had and to make sure that everything goes well after he's gone. -Not for years. -Hear, hear! We'll see. The doctors would disagree, but what do they know? These are wonderful things that we've achieved in Havana and there's no limit to where we can go from here. This kind of government knows how to help business, to encourage it. The hotels here are bigger and swankier than any of the joints in Vegas. We can thank our friends in the Cuban government which has put up half the cash with the Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis and has relaxed restrictions on imports. What I'm saying is that we have now what we have always needed... Real partnership with a government. Smaller piece. You all know Michael Corleone and we all remember his father. At the time of my retirement, or death, I turn over all my interests in the Havana operation to his control. But, all of you will share. The Nacionale will go to the Lakeville Road Boys, the Capri to the Corleone family, the Sevilla Biltmore also, but Eddie Levine will bring in the Pennino brothers, Dino and Eddie, for a piece and to handle the casino operations. We've saved a piece for some friends in Nevada to make sure that things go smoothly back home. I want all of you to enjoy your cake. So, enjoy! -Happy birthday! -L'chaim! I saw an interesting thing happen today. A rebel was being arrested by the military police. Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade he had in his jacket. He killed himself and took a captain of the command with him. -Those rebels are lunatics. -Maybe so. But it occurred to me, that the soldiers are paid to fight, the rebels aren't. -What does that tell you? -They can win. This country has had rebels for 50 years. It's in their blood. I know, I've been coming here since the Twenties. We were running molasses from Havana when you were a baby. The trucks were owned by your father. Michael. I'd rather we talked about this when we're alone. The two million never got to the island. It mustn't be known that you held back the money because you worried about the rebels. Sit down, Michael. Sit down. If I could only live to see it, to be there with you. What I wouldn't give for 20 more years. Here we are, protected. Free to make our profits without Kefauver, the goddamn Justice Department and the FBI. 90 miles away, in partnership with a friendly government. 90 miles. It's nothing. Just one small step for a man looking to be President of the United States and having the cash to make it possible. Michael, we're bigger than U.S. Steel. Mikey, how are you? Okay? -Hi! Freddy Corleone. -Mio frati. Jesus Christ, what a trip! I thought, ""What if somebody knows what I've got in here"". Can you imagine that? Two million dollars on the seat next to me. -Excuse me. -It's okay. You want to count it? What's going on? I'm totally in the dark. The family is making an investment in Havana. This is a gift for the President. That's great! Havana's great. It's my kind of town. -Anybody I know in Havana? -Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola? No. I've never met them. Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of... Kind of nervous from the trip. Can I get a drink or something? I thought maybe we'd go out together. I know a place where we can spend some time together. Sometimes I think I should have married a woman like you did. Like Kay. Have kids. Have a family. For once in my life, be more like Pop. It's not easy to be a son, Fredo. It's not easy. Mama used to say, ""You don't belong to me."" ""You were left on the doorstep by gypsies."" Sometimes I think it's true. You're no gypsy, Fredo. Mikey, I was mad at you. Why didn't we spend time like this before? You want a drink, right? Waiter! Por favor... -How do you say Banana Daiquiri? -Banana Daiquiri. -That's it? -That's it. Uno Banana Daiquiri and a club soda. Senator Geary flies in from Washington tomorrow with some government people. I want you to show them a good time in Havana. -That's my specialty, right? -Can I trust you with something? Of course, Mike. Later in the evening we're all invited to the Presidential Palace to bring in the New Year. After it's over they'll take me home in a military car, alone. For my protection. Before I reach my hotel, I'll be assassinated. -Who? -Roth. It was Roth who tried to kill me in my home. It was Roth all along. He acts like I'm his son, his successor. But he thinks he'll live forever and wants me out. -How can I help? -Just go along, as if you know nothing. -I've already made my move. -What move? Hyman Roth won't see the New Year. You're to take it easy, he'll be back tomorrow. Fly in my own doctor from Miami. I don't trust a doctor who can't speak English. -Gracias, seor. -Buenas noches. -Honey, go to the casino. -If you're feeling better. Feel fine. -Play the bingo game. -Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Paul. My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought a bag full of money. Where is it? -You're pulling out? -Just want to... Just want to wait. -How do you feel? -Terrible. I'd give four million to be able to take a painless piss. -Who had Frank Pentangeli killed? -The Rosato brothers. I know, but who gave the go-ahead? I know I didn't. There was this kid I grew up with. He was younger than me. Sort of looked up to me, you know. We did our first work together. Worked our way out of the street. Things were good. During Prohibition we ran molasses into Canada. Made a fortune. Your father, too. As much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.s going to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man. A man of vision and guts. And there isn't even a plaque, signpost or statue of him in that town. Someone put a bullet through his eye. No one knows who gave the order. When I heard it, I wasn't angry. I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong. Talking loud, saying stupid things. So when he turned up dead, I let it go. And I said to myself, ""This is the business we've chosen."" I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with business. That two million in a bag in your room... I'm going in to take a nap. When I wake, if the money is on the table, I know I have a partner. If it isn't, I know I don't. Does everybody know everybody? You know Senator Geary. Good to see you, Mike. I'm glad we spend this time together. Senator Payton from Florida... Judge DeMalco from New York... Senator Ream from Maryland... Fred Corngold from UTT. -That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha! -He does? Gentlemen, it's refill time! You might try some of the local drinks. Cuba Libre, Pia Colada... I think I'll try one of those redheaded Yolandas. -That you got! Con gusto... -Johnny! You don't know my brother Fredo. Johnny Ola, Fredo. -We never met. Johnny Ola. -Pleasure. Gentlemen, to a night in Havana! -Happy New Year! -Happy New Year! -Feliz Ao Nuevo! -Happy New Year. -Hey, Freddy, why are we standing? -Everybody stands. -It's worth it. You won't believe this. -I don't believe it already. -50 dollars, right? -You've got a bet, mister. That's Superman. Did I tell you or did I tell you? -I don't believe it! -It's got to be fake. It's real. That's why he's called Superman. Hey, Freddy, where did you find this place? Johnny Ola brought me here. I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing! -I see it, but still don't believe it! -50 bucks, Pat. Roth won't go here, but Johnny knows these places! -Watch, he'll break a cracker with it. -I want to see him break a brick! Relax, we're taking you to the hospital. ...and you'll continue to get those. I don't believe that President Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba as we have over one billion dollars invested in this country. The American public believe in non-intervention... Fredo! Where are you going? I'm getting a real drink, because I can't... What kept Mr. Roth? I understood he was coming. Reeves, what's the protocol? How long should we stay? I think a half hour ought to do it. Just long enough to bring in the New Year. It's New Year's Eve. Come on, just for a minute. There's a plane waiting to take us to Miami in an hour. Don't make a big thing about it. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! Due to serious setbacks to our troops in Guantanamo and Santiago... ...my position in Cuba is untenable. I am resigning from office to avoid further bloodshed. And I shall leave the city immediately. I wish all of you good luck. Salud! Viva la revolucin! Viva Fidel! Fredo! Come on. Come with me. It's the only way out of here tonight. Roth is dead. Fredo, come with me! You're still my brother. Fredo! I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator. Fidel! Fidel! Fidel! Al. Get me a wet towel. Does Kay know I'm back? My boy? Did you get him something for Christmas? -I took care of it. -What was it, so I'll know. It was a little car with an electric motor that he can ride in. It's nice. Thank you, Al. Fellows, could you step outside for a minute? Where's my brother? Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami. He had a stroke, but recovered okay. Your bodyguard is dead. I asked about Fredo. I think he got out. He must be somewhere in New York. All right. I want you to get in touch with him. I know he's scared. Tell him everything is all right. Tell him I know Roth misled him. That he didn't know they would try to kill me. -They can come in now. -There was something else. What? What? Come on. Kay had a miscarriage. -Was it a boy? -At three and a half months... Can't you give me a straight answer? Was it a boy? I really don't know. Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia. Young man, I hear you and your friends are stealing goods. But you don't even send a dress to my house. No respect! You know I've got three daughters. This is my neighborhood. You and your friends should show me some respect. You should let me wet my beak a little. I hear you and your friends cleared $600 each. Give me $200 each, for your own protection. And I'll forget the insult. You young punks have to learn to respect a man like me! Otherwise the cops will come to your house. And your family will be ruined. Of course if I'm wrong about how much you stole - I'll take a little less. And by less, I only mean - a hundred bucks less. Now don't refuse me. Understand, paisan? I understand. My friends and I share all the money. So first, I have to talk to them. Tell your friends I don't want a lot. Just enough to wet my beak. Don't be afraid to tell them! 600 bucks... Suppose we don't pay? You know his gang, Tessio. Real animals. Maranzalla himself let Fanucci work this neighborhood. He's got connections with the cops, too. We have to pay him. $200 each...everybody agreed? Why do we have to pay him? Vito, leave this to us. He's one person, we're three. He's got guns, we've got guns. Why should we give him the money we sweated for? This is his neighborhood! I know two bookies who don't give anything to Fanucci. Who? Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro. They don't pay Fanucci. If they don't pay Fanucci, then somebody else collects for Maranzalla! We'll all be better off if we pay him. Don't worry. Now what I say stays in this room. If you both like, why not give me $50 each to pay Fanucci? I guarantee he'll accept what I give him. If Fanucci says $200... ...he means it, Vito! I'll reason with him. Leave everything to me. I'll take care of everything. I never lie to my friends. Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci. He'll ask for the money. Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants. Don't argue with him. Then I'll go and get him to agree. Don't argue with him, since he's so tough. How can you get him to take less? That's my business. Just remember that I did you a favor. Is it a deal? Yes. His family's out of the house. Fanucci's alone in the cafe. Vito, here's my 50 dollars. Buona fortuna. Are you sure he's going to go for it? I'll make an offer he don't refuse. Don't worry. It looks like there's - $100 under my hat. I was right. Only $100... I'm short of money right now. I've been out of work...so just give me a little time. You understand, don't you? You've got balls, young man! How come I never heard of you before? You've got a lot of guts. I'll find you some work for good money. No hard feelings, right? If I can help you, let me know. You've done well for yourself. Enjoy the festa! Oh, this is too violent for me! What've you got there? Michael, your father loves you very much. Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942 to the present time, you were an employee of the Genco Olive Oil Company? That's right. But in actuality you were a member of the Corleone crime organization. No, we called it the Corleone family, Senator. What was your position? At first, like everybody else, I was a soldier. -What is that? -A button, you know, Senator. No, I don't know. Tell me. When the boss says ""push a button"" on a guy, I push a button. See, Senator? Mr. Questadt. -You mean you kill people? -What? You kill people at the behest of your superiors. Yeah, that's right. And the head of your family is Michael Corleone? Yeah, Counselor. Michael Corleone. Did you ever get such an order directly from Michael Corleone? No, I never talked to him. Mr. Cicci, could you amplify your answer a bit? -Do what? -Could you expand on your answer? I'm particularly interested in knowing, was there always a buffer involved? Someone in between you and your superiors who gave the order. Right, a buffer. The family had a lot of buffers! You may find this very amusing, but the members of this committee do not. Tell me something, Ma. What did Papa think... deep in his heart? He was being strong... Strong for his family. But by being strong for his family... ...could he... ...lose it? You're thinking about your wife... about the baby you lost. But you and your wife can always have another baby. No, I meant...lose his family. But you can never lose your family. Times are changing. It's my pleasure. I don't want money. Take it as a gift. If there's something I can do for you, you come, we talk. Signora Colombo, why did you come to see me? Your wife told me to ask if you could help me. She's in bad trouble. Her neighbors complained to the landlord about her dog. He told her to get rid of the animal. But her little boy loves that dog. So she hid it. When the landlord found out, he got mad and told her to leave. Now she can't stay even if she gets rid of it. I'm so ashamed! He said he'd get the police to throw us out on the street. I'm sorry, but... I could give you a couple dollars to help you move. I can't move! I want you to talk to him! Tell him I want to stay here! What's your landlord's name? His name is Signor Roberto. He lives on Fourth Street, near here. They break the windows, they dirty the floors... A real pig-sty, eh? My name is Vito Corleone. Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife. She says she's been evicted for no good reason. She's a poor widow, she has nobody to take care of her. She has no relatives, no money. All she has is this neighborhood. I already rented the place to another family. I told her that I'd talk to you. That you're a reasonable man. She got rid of the animal that caused all the trouble. So let her stay. Impossible. Are you Sicilian? No, I'm Calabrese. We're practically paisan, do me this favor. I already rented it! I'll look like an idiot. Besides, the new tenants pay more rent. How much more a month? Five bucks. Here's six months increase in advance. But don't tell her about it. She's very proud. Come see me in another six months. Of course, the dog stays. Right? The dog stays. Who the hell are you to come give me orders? Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass right into the street! Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. What a character! That landlord is here...Roberto, the one who owns those rat holes. He's been asking all around the neighborhood about you. I hope I'm not disturbing you, Don Vito. What can I do for you, Don Roberto? What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary! Of course Signora Colombo can stay! I'm giving back the money you gave me. Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'! Because after all, Don Vito, money isn't everything. Can I sit down? Your kindness to that widow made me ashamed of myself. The rent stays like before! I'll even lower it. I'll lower it $5. I'll lower it $10! Can I offer you some coffee? I'm late for an appointment! I can't this time! Ask me another time! You'll have to excuse me for now. I wish I could stay longer! Just call me and I'll be here! He won't be back. He'll hide out in the Bronx! -Vito, what do you think? -We'll make a big business! -New York City. -Would you speak up, please? New York City. -Are you the son of Vito Corleone? -Yes, I am. -Where was he born? -Corleone, Sicily. Did he at times use an alias that was known in certain circles as Godfather? Godfather is a term used by his friends. One of affection and respect. Mr. Chairman, I would like to verify the witness' statement. For years many of my constituents have been of Italian descent. I've come to know them well. They have honored me with their support and their friendship. I can proudly say that some of my very best friends are Italian-Americans. However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately I have to leave these proceedings in order to preside over a very important meeting of my own committee. Before I leave, I do want to say this, that these hearings on the Mafia are in no way whatsoever a slur upon the great Italian people. I can state from my own knowledge and experience that Italian-Americans are among the most loyal, most law-abiding, patriotic, hard-working American citizens in this land. It would be a shame, Mr. Chairman, if we allowed a few rotten apples to give a bad name to the whole barrel. Because from the time of Christopher Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi to the present day, Italian-Americans have been pioneers in building and defending our nation. They are the salt of the earth, and one of the backbones of this country. I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague. Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights. We have testimony from a previous witness, one Willi Cicci. He stated that you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in the country. -Are you? -No, I'm not. He testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York police captain in 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo. -Do you deny this? -Yes, I do. Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of ""the Five Families"" in New York to assume and consolidate your nefarious power? -It's a complete falsehood. -Mr. Questadt. Is it true you have a controlling interest in three major hotels in Las Vegas? No, it's not true. I own some stock in some of the hotels there, but very little. I also have stock in IBM and IT&T. Do you have any control over gambling and narcotics in New York State? No, I do not. Senator, my client would like to read a statement. Mr. Chairman, I think this statement is totally out of order at this time. Sir, my client has answered this committee's questions with sincerity. He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment, so this statement should be heard! No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone to read his statement. I'll put it in the record. In the hopes of clearing my family name to give my children their share of the American way of life without a blemish on their name and background, I have appeared before this committee and given it all my cooperation. I consider it a great personal dishonor to have to deny that I am a criminal. I wish to have the following noted for the record... That I served my country faithfully in World War Two and was awarded the Navy Cross for actions in defense of my country. That I have never been arrested or indicted for any crime. That no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra or any other name has ever been made public. I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment, although it's my right to do so. I challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me and if they do not, I hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have besmirched it. I'm sure we're impressed. Particularly with your love for our country. We'll be in recess until 10:00 a.m. Monday when we will produce a witness who'll corroborate the charges against you. At which time you may very well be subject to indictment for perjury. I remind you that you're still under subpoena. Adjourned! Ten-to-one shot, you said. A ten-to-one shot he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose! You sound like my bookie. I owe that monkey my life. -Well, just get a good night's sleep. -Yeah. You've got a big day tomorrow. I've got you a new suit, new shirt, new tie. I'll shave you myself in the morning. You'll look respectable for 50 million of your fellow Americans. Tomorrow... My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow. Come on! I saw this 19 times. You've got a great home here, for the rest of your life. Nobody gets near you, you're not going anywhere. That's great. Beautiful. Some deal I made. You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero. You'll live better here than most people outside. Some deal! Alive. Pentangeli is alive. -How did they get their hands on him? -Roth. He engineered it, Michael. When Frankie went to make a deal with the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him. He thought you double-crossed him. Our people with the detectives said he was half dead, scared and shouted that you'd turned on him. They already had him on possession, bookmaking, murder one and more. The FBI has him airtight. He's on an army base, 24 hour guards. We can't get to him. You've opened yourself to five counts of perjury. What about Fredo? What does he know? He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him. Roth, he played this one beautifully. I'm going to talk to Fredo. I haven't got a lot to say, Mike. We have time. I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much. What about now? Is there anything you can help me out with? Anything you can tell me now? They've got Pentangeli. I didn't know it was going to be a hit, Mike. I swear to God I didn't know. Johnny Ola bumped into me in Beverly Hills. He said that he wanted to talk. He said that you and Roth were in on a big deal together. And that there was something in it for me if I could help him out. He said that you were being tough on the negotiations but if they could get a little help and close the deal fast, it would be good for the family. And you believed that story? You believed that? He said there was something in it for me, on my own! -I've always taken care of you, Fredo. -Taken care of me? You're my kid brother! You take care of me? Did you ever think about that? Did you ever once think about that? ""Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that!"" ""Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."" ""Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!"" I'm your older brother, but was stepped over! -It's the way Pop wanted it. -It's not the way I wanted it! I can handle things, I'm smart! Not like everybody says. Like dumb. I'm smart and I want respect! Is there anything you can tell me about this investigation? Anything more? The Senate lawyer, Questadt. He belongs to Roth. Fredo, you're nothing to me now. Not a brother, not a friend. I don't want to know you, or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels. I don't want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know in advance, so I won't be there. You understand? Mikey. I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive. There's more people than at a ballgame in here. -Hey, there's Willi Cicci! -Frankie Five-Angels... This committee will come to order! -State your name, please. -Frank Pentangeli. -Where were you born? -Partinico, it's outside of Palermo. Where do you live now? I live in an army barracks with the FBI guys. We have here a witness that will further testify to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal empire that controls all gambling. This witness has had no buffer between himself and Michael Corleone. He can corroborate enough charges for us to recommend a charge of perjury against Michael Corleone. -Senator. -Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Pentangeli. Mr. Pentangeli. Were you a member of the Corleone family? Did you serve under Caporegime, Peter Clemenza, and under Vito Corleone, also known as the Godfather? I never knew any Godfather. I have my own family. Mr. Pentangeli, you... You are contradicting your own sworn statement. I ask you again, sir, here and now under oath... were you at any time a member of a crime organization led by Michael Corleone? I don't know nothing about that! I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago. We have a sworn affidavit. Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered on the orders of Michael Corleone. Do you deny this confession, and do you realize what will happen if you do? The FBI guys promised me a deal so I made up a lot of stuff about Michael Corleone, just to please them. But it was all lies. Everything! They kept saying, ""Michael Corleone did this"" and ""Michael Corleone did that"". So I said, ""Yeah, sure. Why not?"" Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify the gentleman sitting to your left? I can answer that. His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli. -Is he related to the witness? -He is, I believe, his brother. -Will he come forward and be sworn? -He doesn't understand English. He came at his own expense to aid his brother. He's not under subpoena and has an impeccable reputation. -He knows nothing about this? -To my knowledge, nothing. I'm going to find out what happened! This committee is now adjourned. -The witness is excused. -Senator! Senator! This committee owes an apology! This committee owes an apology. Apology, Senator! -Michael, excuse me. -Hello, darling. The children are outside. We're going. What do you mean? We're leaving tomorrow. Rocco? I'll be in my room, Mike. Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada. I brought the children to say goodbye to you. I'm very happy for you. I always knew you were too smart to let any of them beat you. -Why don't you sit down? -No, I'm not going to stay long. There are some things I'd like to talk to you about. Things that have been on my mind, changes I want to make. I think it's too late for changes, Michael. -I wasn't going to say anything... -What do you mean, ""too late""? What really happened with Pentangeli? -His brother came and helped him. -I didn't even know he had a brother. Where is he now? He's on a plane, back to Sicily. All he had to do was show his face. It was between the brothers, Kay. I had nothing to do with it. I don't want you going! Not you, not the kids. No. You're my wife and my children. I love you and won't allow it. You say you love me, but talk about allowing me to leave! Things between men and women will not change. You've become blind! Look what's happened to us. -Look what's happened to our son! -Nothing's happened to him. He's fine! -Anthony is not fine! -I don't want to hear about it. -Anthony is... -I don't want to hear about it! Over! At this moment I feel no love for you at all. I never thought that would ever happen, but it has. Kay... We're leaving tomorrow. Why don't you take the kids back to their room? -Michael, you haven't heard me. -Kay, what do you want from me? Do you expect me to let you go, to let you take my children from me? Don't you know me? Don't you know that that's an impossibility? That I'd use all my power to keep that from happening? Don't you know that? Kay... In time, you'll feel differently. You'll be glad I stopped you now. I know that. I know you blame me for losing the baby. Yes. I know what that meant to you. I'll make it up to you, Kay. I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll... I'm going to change. I'll change. I've learned that I have the strength to change. Then you'll forget about this miscarriage and we'll have another child. And we'll go on, you and I. -We'll go on. -Oh, Michael! Michael, you are blind. It wasn't a miscarriage. It was an abortion. An abortion, Michael. Just like our marriage is an abortion. Something that's unholy and evil! I didn't want your son, Michael! I wouldn't bring another one of your sons into this world! It was an abortion, Michael. It was a son and I had it killed because this must all end! I know now that it's over. I knew it then. There would be no way, Michael, no way you could ever forgive me. Not with this Sicilian thing that's been going on for 2,000... -You won't take my children. -I will. -You won't take my children! -They're my children too. Fredo, give this to Grandmother. Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino. Allow me the honor of introducing someone. My partner in America, in New York. His name is Vito Corleone. We'll send him olive oil from here. To his company in America. They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio. We'd like your blessing, and your permission to start work. Where is this young man from New York? Have him come closer. I can't see him so good. My respects, Don Ciccio. Give me your blessing. Bless you! What's your name? You took the name of this town! And what's your father's name? His name was...Antonio Andolini. Louder, I don't hear so good. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... ...and this is for you! Michael, say goodbye. Hi, Al. Can I speak with you for a second, Tom? Tom, where's Mike? Waiting for you to leave. -Can I talk with him? -Sorry, Fredo. No chance. -Can I see him? -He's in the boathouse. Michael, it's Connie. Michael... I'd like to stay close to home now, if it's all right. Is Kay coming? No. Fredo's in the house with Mama. He asked for you and Tom said you wouldn't see him. That's right. Kids, why don't you go outside for a while? Please, I want to talk to you. Michael, I hated you for so many years. I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you'd know that I could hurt you. You were just being strong for all of us, the way Papa was. And I forgive you. Can't you forgive Fredo? He's so sweet, and helpless without you. You need me. I want to take care of you now. Connie. Tom, sit down. Our friend and business partner, Hyman Roth, is in the news. -Did you hear about it? -I hear that he's in Israel. The High Court in Israel turned down his request to live there. His passport's been invalidated, except to return here. He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday. He offered them a million dollars if they'd let him live there. -They turned him down. -He's going to try Panama. Panama won't take him. Not for a million, not for ten million. His condition is reported as terminal. He's only got six months left. He's had the same heart attack for 20 years. -That plane goes to Miami. -That's right. That's where I want it met. Impossible. They'll turn him over to the Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI. It's not impossible. Nothing's impossible. It would be like trying to kill the President. -There's no way we can get to him! -Tom, you surprise me. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone. -Rocco? -Difficult. Not impossible. Good. Why did you ask me if something was wrong when I came in? I thought you were going to tell me that you were moving your family to Vegas and that you'd been offered the Vice Presidency of the Houstan hotels there. -I thought you'd tell me that. -Must I tell you every offer I turn down? -Let's do business. -All right. Just consider this, Michael. Just consider it. Roth and the Rosatos are on the run. Are they worth it, are they strong enough? Is it worth it? You've won. Do you want to wipe everybody out? I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all. Are you with me in these things, or what? Because if not, you can take your wife, your family and your mistress and move them all to Las Vegas. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. What is this? So...you're staying? Yes, I'm staying. What do you want me to do? Hey, Anthony. How would you like it if I taught you how to catch the really big fish? -Would you like that? -Okay. You know, when I was your age, I went out fishing with all my brothers and my father. Everybody. I was the only one that caught a fish. Nobody else could catch one. Do you know how I did it? Every time I put the line in the water I said a Hail Mary and every time I said a Hail Mary, I caught a fish. Do you believe that? It's true. That's the secret. -Do you want to try it out on the lake? -Okay. What else have you got? Everything will be okay. -Did my brother go back? -Yeah, don't worry. He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned. He didn't want dinner, just wanted to go home. That's my brother! Nothing could get him away from that two-mule town. He could have been big here. He could have had his own family. Tom, what do I do now? Frankie. You were always interested in politics and history. I remember you talking about Hitler back in '33. Yeah, I still read a lot. I get good stuff in there. You were around the old-timers, who built the organization of the families, basing them on the old Roman legions, with ""regimes,"" ""capos"" and ""soldiers"". -And it worked. -Yeah, it worked. Those were the great old days, you know. We was like the Roman Empire. The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire. Yeah, it was once. Frankie. When a plot against the Emperor failed the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes. Right? Only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off and all their estates went to the Emperors. Unless they went home and killed themselves, then nothing happened. And their families were taken care of. That was a good break, a nice deal. Yeah. They went home and sat in a hot bath opened up their veins and bled to death. And sometimes they had a little party before they did it. Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels. Thanks, Tom. Thanks. -See you, Tom. -Addio, Frankie. Kay. You have to go. -So pretty... -Kay, please hurry. He's coming. Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye. Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye! Anthony, say goodbye to Mama. Anthony. I love you, Anthony. Kay, please. All right. Mary, come here. Anthony. Anthony, please. Kiss me once. Easy. Anthony! Anthony! -He's here, we're going fishing. -No! Michael wants to take him to Reno now. Shit! Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno with your pop. -I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay? -Okay. Hey, Anthony. Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret. Let's go. -Mr. Roth, I must take you into custody. -I understand. What's your reaction to the Israeli High Court ruling? I'm a retired investor on a pension. I went to Israel to live there as a Jew, in the twilight of my life. Hey, Frankie! Come on out, let's play some Hearts. Frankie! Is it true you're worth over 300 million dollars? I'm a retired investor, living on a pension. I came home to vote in the presidential election because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot. Jesus Christ. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. Hey! Everybody, pay attention. This is my friend Carlo Rizzi. -You know my brother Fredo. -Sure. This is my stepbrother Tom, and that's his girl Theresa. This cute little thing is my sister Connie. Say hello to Carlo. He's good-looking, isn't he? Yes. The droopy thing is Mike. We call him Joe College. Sit down. Talk to each other. Hey, Mr. Einstein... -The cake. -Sally, get in here! -I was scared. -Come on. -Where's your father? -Christmas shopping. Let's see that thing. That's nice! -Should I put the candles on now? -Yeah. You help her, Carlo. -What is that? Rum? -Yeah. Don't touch the antipasto until Pop sees it. He's not ugly... What do you think of the nerve of those Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday. They didn't know it was Pop's birthday. Not surprising after the oil embargo. They've got no right dropping bombs! Are you a Jap-lover? -30,000 enlisted this morning. -Bunch of saps... -Why are they saps? -Let's not talk about the war. You talk to Carlo. Only saps risk their lives for strangers. -That's Pop talking. -You're right, that's Pop talking! -They risk their lives for their country. -Country isn't your blood. -I don't feel that way. -Then quit college and join the army! I did. I've enlisted in the Marines. -Why didn't you come to us? -What do you mean? -Pop managed to get you a deferment. -I didn't ask for it. I didn't want it. Come on! Knock it off! -Punk! -Sonny, sit down. Mommy, Daddy's fighting again! Go and show Carlo the tree. Nice. Break your father's heart on his birthday. That's swell, Mike. Congratulations. Don't encourage him! Get me a drink. Go on! You don't understand. Your father has plans for you. Many times he and I have talked about your future. You've talked to my father about my future? -My future. -Mikey, he has high hopes for you. -I have my own plans for my future. -Did you go to college to get stupid? He's here! Come on. Stupid! Surprise! For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow That nobody can deny Nobody can deny..., Come on, boys! The way you're lollygagging around here with them picks and them shovels... ...you'd think it was 120... It cant' be more than 114. Dock that Chink a day's pay for napping on the job. Now, come on, boys, where's your spirit? I don't hear no singing. When you were slaves, you sang like birds. Go on. How about a good old nigger work song? ""I get no kick from champagne. ""Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all. ""So tell me why should it be true... ""... that I get a belt out of you? ""Some get a kick from cocaine. "" What the hell is that shit? I meant a song. A real song. Something like... ""Swing low, sweet chariot... "" Swing low? Sweet chariot? Don't know that one, huh? How about ""De Camp Town Ladies""? ""De Camp Town Ladies""? Ah, you know. ""De Camp Town Ladies sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah. ""De Camp Town race track five miles long, all the doo-dah day! ""Gonna run all night, gonna run all day. ""Bet my money on the bobtailed nag, somebody bet on the bay!"" What in the wide, wide world of sports is going on here? I hired you people to try to get a little track laid... ...not to jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots! Sorry, Mr. Taggart. I, I guess we kind of got caught up. Dummy, the surveyors say they may have run into some quicksand up ahead. Better check it out. Okay, I'll send down a team of horses to check out the ground. Horses! We can't afford to lose any horses, you dummy! Send over a couple of niggers. You and you. Sir, he specifically requested two niggers... ...but to tell a family secret, my grandmother was Dutch. Get on that hand car and take it down to the end of that line! Just trying to help you out. I didn't know your grandma was Dutch! ""Oh, de Camp Town Ladies sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah. ""Camp Town race track five miles long, oh, doo-dah day. ""Going to run all night, going to run all day. ""I waged my money on the bobtail nag, somebody bet on the bay!"" Am I wrong... ...or is the world rising? I don't know, but whatever it is, I hate it. Let me ask you something. What is it that's not exactly water, and it's not exactly earth? Quicksand! Oh, shit, quicksand! Goddang, now we are in trouble! They're in trouble! Get your rope there. Get over there quick. Dang, that was lucky. Doggone near lost a $400 hand cart. Yeah, we can take it right off to the, just a little bit to the left of that hill. But we're going to die, Bart. They're going to leave us here to die! Take it easy, Charlie. My foot is on the rail. Then maybe down that canyon. I think it's pretty level off there. We can't swing back to the right 'cause of that hill there. That looks like the way we'll have to go from here. Yes, we'll put her right down through there over that ridge. Well, boys, the break is over. Don't just lay there getting a suntan. Won't do you any good, anyhow! Take that shovel and put her to some good use! What? Don't do that now! I have to. Send a wire to the main office and tell them I said... OW! Send wire, main office, tell them I said, ""Ow"". Gotcha. And right here, Mr. Lamarr, is where we ran into quicksand. Quicksand. Splendid. And so the railroad has got to go through Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Splendid. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Be still, Taggart. Be still. My mind is aglow with whirling, transient nodes of thought... ...careening through a cosmic vapor of invention. Ditto! Ditto? Ditto, you provincial putz! I'm sorry, sir. A plan. We need a plan. What in the hell was that? We can't hear ourselves think! Sorry, your Worship, but I've got two men home sick with the flu... ...and it's utter chaos down here. I'll try to keep it as quiet as possible. But as you can see... ...this one is a doozey. Yes, the Doctor Gillespie killings. Well, do your best. Now, let's see. Where were we? Rock Ridge. Yes, when that railroad goes through Rock Ridge... ...that land will be worth millions, and I want it! I want that land so badly, I can taste it. There must be a way. Clumsy fool! Wait a minute! There might be a legal precedent. Of course! Land-snatching! Land. La-land. ""See 'Snatch'."" Haley vs. United States. Haley, seven. United States, nothing. You see, it can be done. It can be done. Unfortunately, there is one thing that stands between me and that property. The rightful owners. There must be some way of scaring them off, driving them out. Getting rid of every human being alive in that... It's down the hall and to the left. I've got it! What? What? I know how we can run everybody out of Rock Ridge. We'll kill the first-born male child in every household! Too Jewish. We'll work up a Number Six on them! I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that one. That's where we go riding into town... ...and a-whapping and a-whooping every living thing... ...that moves within an inch of its life! Except the women folks, of course. You spare the women? No, we rape the shit out of them at the Number Six dance later on! That's marvelous! That's so creative! Why, Taggart, you've been hurt! That uppity nigger hit me on the head with a shovel. I'd sure appreciate it, sir, if you could find it in your heart... ...to hang him up by his neck until he was dead. Got him locked up downstairs. Consider it done, stout fellow. I've got a special. When can you work him in? I couldn't possibly fit him in until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid. Monday. Splendid. Thank you, sir. And don't you worry. We'll make Rock Ridge think it's a chicken... ...that got caught in a tractor's nuts! It's all right, Taggart. Just a man and a horse being hung out there. ""There was a peaceful town called Rock Ridge, ""... where people lived in harmony. ""They never had no kind of trouble. ""There was no hint of misery. ""The town saloon was always lively... ""... but never nasty or obscene. ""Behind the bar stood Anal Johnson. ""He always kept things nice and clean! ""And all at once the trouble started. ""A pack of murderers and thieves... ""... like swarms of locusts they descended... ""... their aim to make the townsfolk flee. "" Well, that's the end of this suit! Have you ever seen such cruelty? ""Now is a time of great decision. ""Are we to stay or up and quit? ""There's no avoiding this conclusion. ""Our town is turning into shit!"" Well, I don't have to tell you good folks... ...what has been happening here in our beloved town. Sheriff murdered, crops burned... ...stores looted, people stampeded... ...and cattle raped! Now the time has come to act. And act fast! I'm leaving. You get back here, you old pious, candy-ass sidewinder! There ain't no way that nobody is going to leave this town! Hell, I was born here and I was raised here... ...and goddamn it, I'm going to die here! And no sidewinder, bushwhacking, hornswoggling... ...cracker croaker, is going to ruin my biscuit-cutter! Now who can argue with that? I think we're all indebted to Gabby Johnson... ...for clearly stating what needed to be said. I'm particularly glad that these lovely children... ...were here today to hear that speech. Not only was it authentic frontier gibberish... ...it expressed a courage little seen in this day and age! What are we made of? Our fathers came across the prairie... ...fought Indians, fought drought, fought locusts, fought Dix! Remember when Richard Dix came in here and tried to take over this town? Well, we didn't give up then... ...and by gum, we're not going to give up now! Olson Johnson is right! What kind of people are we, anyhow? I say we stay and fight it out! Dr. Samuel Johnson is right about Olson Johnson's being right. And I'm not giving up my ice cream parlor... ...that I built with these two hands for nothing or nobody! Howard Johnson is right! Well, if we're going to stay, and I think it's a big mistake... ...we're going to need a new sheriff. Now, who is it going to be? Why don't we wire the governor to send us a sheriff? Why should we get our own men killed? Howard Johnson is right. We'll wire the governor. Then let us pray for the deliverance of our new sheriff. Will the congregation please rise? I shall now read from the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke... ...and duck! We've got to do something at once! Governor, may I disturb you for a moment, sir? If you will just sign this, governor. Right here. Yes, what the hell is it? Well, under the provisions of this bill... ...we would snatch 200,000 acres of Indian territory... ...which we have deemed unsafe for their use at this time. They're such children. 200,000 acres! 200,000 acres! What will it cost, man? What will it cost? A box of these. Are you crazy? They'll never go for it, and then again they might. The little red devils, they love toys. May I try one? These things are defective. Right as usual, sir. Show-off! Just sign this, sir. Right here. Okay, give us a hand here. Work, work, work. Hello, boys, have a good night's rest? I missed you. Just one more bill for you to sign, sir. What is this? This is the bill that will convert the State Hospital for the Insane... ...into the William J. Le Petomane Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane. Gentlemen, this... ...this bill will be a giant step forward... ...in the treatment of the insane gambler. Yes, bravo! Beautiful. Thank you, Hedy. Thank you. It's not Hedy. It's Hedley. Hedley Lamarr. What the hell are you worried about? This is 1874. You'll be able to sue her. All right, help me in with this. Just, ah, think of your secretary. Ah, that was a very good suggestion. Okay, is that it? Anything else? Just this urgent telegram from Rock Ridge. It arrived last Friday. Read it, read it. ""Sheriff murdered. Church meeting bombed. Reign of terror must cease. ""Send new sheriff immediately. "" Holy underwear! Sheriff murdered. Innocent women and children blown to bits! We've got to protect our phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen. We must do something about this immediately, immediately, immediately! I didn't get a ""hrumph"" out of that guy! Give the governor a ""hrumph. "" You watch your ass. Gentlemen, please, rest your sphincters. Well put. As Attorney General, I can assure you... ...that a suitable sheriff will be found to restore the peace in Rock Ridge. Meeting is adjourned. Oh, I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean to overstep my bounds. You say that. What? - Meeting is adjourned. - It is? No. You say that, governor. - What? - Meeting is adjourned. It is? Here, play around with this for a while. They are sweeping the country. Why don't you give these out to some of the boys... ...in lieu of pay? Here you go. And one for Miss Stein, my beloved secretary. Play with these, boys, in lieu of the other things. This friggin' thing is warped. Why do I always get a warped one? A sheriff! But law and order is the last thing I want. Wait a minute. Maybe I could turn this thing to my advantage. If I could find a sheriff who so offends the citizens of Rock Ridge... ...that his very appearance would drive them out of town... But where would I find such a man? Why am I asking you? Welcome to Hanging House. Not to worry... ...everyone is equal in my eye. Oh, not my ear! Governor! Official business, sir. Is it important? It's very crucial. Be with you in a minute. Throw something on and stay in that position. Forgive me, I was just, ah, walking the parapet, taking a look around. What can I do for you? Governor, as per your instructions... ...I'd like you to meet the new sheriff of Rock Ridge. I'd be delighted... Wow! I've got to talk to you. Come here. Have you gone berserk? Can't you see that man is a nig... Wrong person. Forgive me. No offense intended. Have you gone berserk? Can't you see that man is a nig? Don't worry, sir. Now, Hedley, I've always trusted your judgment before... ...but haven't you taken a giant leap away from your good senses? Please, don't fly off the handle, sir. I'm about to make you an historic figure. Maybe even get you a cabinet post. A cabinet post! Did you say that? Wonderful! Yes, the first man ever to appoint a black sheriff! Just think, sir... ...Washington, Jefferson... ...Lincoln. Le Petomane! Sir, you have the seeds of greatness in you. Nurse them, caress them, pour water on them. Don't short-change yourself, sir. It will never work. They'll kill him dead in one day! One day is all we'll need to secure your name in the annals of Western history. And to get for you a nomination for, dare I say...? Dare, dare! The Presidency! Hail to the Chief! Hail to the Chief! ""Four score and seven years ago... ""... our forefathers brought forth on this... "" Are you coming back? In a moment, dear. Gentlemen, affairs of state must take precedent over the affairs of state. Yes, of course, sir, we understand. Will you make all the arrangements? I will make all the arrangements. Especially the funeral. Good luck, good luck, boys. Wonderful working with you. Good luck! Hurry up, get those flags up. He'll be here soon. I just got a telegram from the governor's office. The sheriff will be here at noon! Noon! I'd better rehearse my speech! ""As Honorary Chairman of the Welcoming Committee... ""... it is my privilege to extend to you a laurel and hearty handshake!"" Wonderful! Excellent! Can you see him yet? The sheriff is coming! Ring out the church bell! Hey, the sheriff is a n... What did he say? The sheriff is near! No, no, dag blame it, gol darn it, the sheriff is a n... As Chairman of the Welcoming Committee... ...it is my privilege to extend a laurel and hearty handshake to our new... ...nigger. Excuse me while I whip this out. ""By the power vested in me by... ""... the Honorable William J. Le Petomane... ""... I hereby assume the duties... ""... of the Office of Sheriff in and for the Township of Rock Ridge. "" Gentlemen, let us not allow anger to rule the day. As your spiritual leader, I implore you... ...to pay heed to this good book and what it has to say. Son, you're on your own! Hold it! The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it! Hold it, men. He's not bluffing. Listen to him, men. He's just crazy enough to do it. Drop it! Or I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town! Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate! Do what he say! Do what he say! Isn't anybody going to help that poor man? Hush, Harriet. That's a sure way to get him killed. Help me, help me... ...somebody help me! Shut up! Oh, baby, you are so talented. And they are so dumb! Goddamn it! I said, ""Order""! You know, Nietzsche says, ""Out of chaos comes order. "" Oh, blow it out your ass, Howard! Now everyone be quiet... ...whilst we listen to Harriet van Johnson, our esteemed schoolmarm... ...as she reads a telegram that she herself has composed to the governor... ...expressing our feelings about the new sheriff. ""To the Honorable William J. Le Petomane, Governor. "" Louder! Speak up! We can't hear you! I'm not used to public speaking. ""We, the white, God-fearing citizens of Rock Ridge... ""... wish to express our extreme displeasure... ""... with your choice of sheriff. ""Please remove him immediately. ""The fact that you have sent him here... "" ""... just goes to prove that you are the leading asshole in the state. "" The drunk in number two must be awake. Are we awake? We're not sure. Are we black? Yes, we are. Then we're awake. But we're very puzzled. I think I better straighten myself out. Need any help? All I can get. That's okay. Sit down over here. Hey, maybe you should eat something first. No, thanks. Food makes me sick. A man drinks like that and doesn't eat, he is going to die. When? What's your name? Well, my name is Jim, but most people call me... ...Jim. Okay, Jim, since you are my guest and I am your host... ...what is your pleasure? What do you like to do? Oh, I don't know. Play chess... ...screw. Well, let's play chess. Checkmate. Checkmate. Why, you devious son-of-a-bitch! Happy days! Man, why do you do that to yourself? Oh, you don't really want to know that. I do, I do! Well, if you must pry. I must, I must! I don't know if you ever heard of me before, but... ...I used to be called the Waco Kid. The Waco Kid. He had the fastest hands in the West! In the world! Well, if you're the Kid, then show me something. Maybe a couple of years ago I could have shown you something, but today... ...look at that. Steady as a rock. Yes, but I shoot with this hand. See, I knew you weren't the Waco Kid. You were just pulling my lariat. See that king? Put your hands on both sides of it. Now when I say, ""go,"" you try to grab it first. Man, that's no contest. You're a mile away. Anyway, when you hear the word ""go,"" you just try to grab it. Ready? You looking for this? Well, raise my rent! You are the Kid! Was. Yeah, I was the Kid. What happened? Well, it got so that every piss-ant prairie punk... ...who thought he could shoot a gun... ...would ride into town to try out the Waco Kid. I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille. It got pretty gritty. I started to hear the word ""draw"" in my sleep. Then one day... ...I was just walking down the street and I heard a voice behind me say... ...""Reach for it, mister!"" I spun around. And there I was face to face... ...with a 6-year-old kid! Well, I just threw my guns down and walked away. The little bastard shot me in the ass! So I limped to the nearest saloon, crawled inside a whiskey bottle... ...and I've been there ever since. Have a drink. Anyway, that's all ancient history. Now you tell me your story. What's a dazzling urbanite like you doing in a rustic setting like this? If you really must pry. I must, I must! Well, back in '56... ...my folks and I were part of this long wagon train... ...moving West. Well, not exactly part of it. You might say we were bringing up the rear, when suddenly, ...from out of the West, came the entire Sioux Nation! And let me tell you, baby, they were open for business! Naturally, the white folks didn't let us travel in their circle... ...so we made our own. Shvartzes? Luzem gayen! Cop a walk. It's all right. Thank you. Abi gezunt. Take off. They're darker than us! And the rest is history. Impressed? Always like to keep my audience riveted. How about some more beans, Mr. Taggart? I'd say you've had enough! I understand there's a new sheriff in town. Who wants to kill him? Why don't we give him to Mongo? Holy shit, that's too cruel! I'll be danged! That is a unique idea! Down, boy, down, boy, down, Mongo! Hey, it's me. Taggart. Here, smell. Smell. That's a good Mongo. Hey, how about it? How would you like to mutilate that new sheriff? Have a cigar. Oh, by the way, I got a note this morning. From who? Well, I'm not sure. It was addressed to the Deputy Spade. Well, once I establish myself in this town... ...Deputy Spade might turn out to be a groovy position. Listen, Bart, I want you to do me a favor. I don't want you going out there this morning. You can't win these people over, no matter what you do. They're just not going to accept you. I'm glad those fingers ain't loaded! Just like old times. Like I told you, once you establish yourself, they've got to accept you. Catch you later. Good luck. Ah, good morning, ma'am. And isn't it a lovely morning? Up yours, nigger! What did you expect? ""Welcome, sonny. "" ""Make yourself at home. "" ""Marry my daughter. "" You've got to remember these are just simple farmers. These are people of the land. The common clay of the new West. You know. Morons! What the hell is that? Mongo! Santa Mara! I believe in it. And if any one of you... ...friends and neighbors, kind of gather around and... Holy shit! And they say that now in Paris, France, even as we speak... ...Louis Pasteur has devised a new vaccine... ...that will obliterate anthrax once and for all. Hey, you can't park that animal over there! It's illegal. Think of it, gentlemen. Hoof-and- mouth disease a thing of the past! Never mind that shit, here comes Mongo! I don't know what it is. Sheriff, Mongo's back! He's breaking up the whole town! You've got to help us, please! Did you hear that? Now it's ""please. "" This morning I couldn't get the time of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway? Well, Mongo ain't exactly a ""who. "" He's more of a ""what. "" What he said. Well, I don't know... Oh, thank you very much! The fool's going to... I mean, the sheriff's going to do it. No, no, don't do that! If you shoot him, you'll just make him mad. Candygram for Mongo! Me, Mongo. Sign, please. Mongo like candy. A little further down, to the right. I thought sure that Mongo would mash him up... ...into little bitty sheriff meatballs. I just don't understand it. Be still, Taggart. My mind is a raging torrent... ...flooded with rivulets of thought... ...cascading into a waterfall of creative alternatives. Gol darn it, Mr. Lamarr... ...you use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore. Wait a minute, that's it! And it will work! You bet it will! What will work? Elementary, cactus-head! The beast has failed. And when the beast fails, it's time to call in beauty. Beauty? She's never failed me before. She'll turn him into jelly! She'll bring him to his knees! Where's my froggie? Where's my froggie? I don't know. I didn't see it when I came in. Damn your eyes, look for it! Oh, there it is. That was a close one! Daddy loves Froggie. Froggie love Daddy? I don't know how you did it. He was nothing. The bitch was inventing the candygram. They probably won't give me credit for it. Good evening, sheriff. Sorry about the ""Up yours, nigger. "" I hope this apple pie will in some small way say thank you for your... ...ingenuity and courage in defeating that horrible Mongo. Thank you. Much obliged. Good night. Of course, you'll have the good taste not to mention that I spoke to you. I'm rapidly becoming a big underground success in this town. See, in another 25 years you'll be able to shake their hands in broad daylight. Well, I'm not going to hold my breath for it. Come on, I don't want to be late. Lili von Shtupp is opening tonight. Lili von who? Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome. Come on in. It's Hedley. For you, my dear. Oh, how ordinary. Oh, Lili, Lili, Lili, legs, Lili, Lili! I can't find the words to truly express my joy... ...at the rekindling of our association. Bullshit, what's the job? I love it when you talk dirty. Come on, Lamarr, let's get down to bwass tacks. What do you want me to do? I want you to seduce and abandon the sheriff of Rock Ridge. You think you can do it? Is Bismark a hewwing? Oh, Lili, you're magnificent! Kiss me! And now, folks, the gal you've all been waiting for... ...the Bavarian Bombshell herself! Let's hear it for Lili von Shtupp! ""Here I stand, the goddess of desire... ""... set men on fire. I have this power. ""Morning, noon and night, it's drink and dancing... ""... some quick romancing, and then a shower. ""Stage door Johnnies constantly surround me...

"" Goddamn it, I'm exhausted! Hello, cowboy, what's your name? ""Tex ma'am""? Tell me, Tex ma'am... ...are you in show business? Nope. Well, then, why don't you get your friggin' feet off the stage? Hello, handsome. Is that a 10-gallon hat, or are you just enjoying the show? Oh, Miss Lili, oh, my lovely lady! ""Tired of playing the game. ""Ain't it a crying shame... ""... I'm so tired. ""She's tired. ""Sick and tired of love. Give her a break. ""She's had her fill of love. She's not a snake! ""From below and above. Can't you see she's sick? ""She's bushed. ""Tired of being admired.

""I must see you alone in my dwessing woom right after the show. "" Wie gehts, meine schatzie? Faw out! A wed wose. How womantic! Have a seat, shewiff. Won't you excuse me for a moment... ...while I slip into something a little bit more comfortable? Bitte, baby. Why don't you loosen your bullets? Ahh, I feel wefweshed! Isn't it bwight in here? There! Isn't that better? Pardon me, I'll be back in a moment. How is it going? He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands. By morning he will be my slave. Splendid. Oh, just let me have a little feel. Where were we? Where are you? Let me sit down next to you. Tell me, schatzie... ...is it, ah, twu what they say about the way you people are gifted? Oh, it's twu, it's twu! Vill you care for another schnitzengruben? No, thank you. Fifteen is my limit on schnitzengruben. Well, then, how about a little...? Baby, please, I am not from Havana. Excuse me, honey... ...besides, I'm late for work. I've got some heavy chores to do. Vill I, vill I see you later? That all depends on how much Vitamin E I can get my hands on. Nein, nein, achtung! No, no, you mustn't go! I need you! I never met nobody like you! I can't live without you! Please, you're making a German spectacle of yourself. Auf wiedersehen, baby. Oh, what a nice guy. Oh, deary, dear. Look what the cat dragged in. What's happening in the clean world? Bad news. I've got a writ here for Mongo's release signed by Hedley Lamarr himself. Why would a dude like Hedley Lamarr care about Mongo? It's legal. Oh, those schnitzengrubens can wipe you out! Wake up time! Okay, Mongo. You're free to go. Mongo no go. Oh, come on, Mongo. You're a free man. Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart. Sheriff first man ever whip Mongo. Mongo impressed, have deep feelings for Sheriff Bart. Oh, you better watch out, big fella. I think Mongo's taken a little fancy to you. Mongo straight. Maybe you know why a high-roller... ...like Hedley Lamarr is interested in Rock Ridge. Don't know. Got to do with where choo-choo go. Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care about where the choo-choo goes? Don't know. Mongo only pawn in game of life. I think this might be a good time to mosey out... ...to where they're building the railroad... ...and maybe do a little snooping. Damn, damn, damn! Hey, how are you doing Bart? Get down off that horse! Oh, you shifty nigger! They said you were hung! And they were right! Look at that star, hoo-ee! Civil service! Wait. Back off, scamp. You are addressing the duly appointed sheriff of Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge? Hey, the railroad is going through there! Back up off your brother! Don't mess up your brother! Holy mother of pearl! It's that nigger that hit me on the head with the shovel! Now what the hell do you think you're doing with that tin star, boy? Watch that ""boy"" shit, redneck! You're talking to the sheriff of Rock Ridge. Well, now if that don't beat all! Here we take the good time and trouble... ...to slaughter every last Indian in the West, and for what? So they can appoint a sheriff that's blacker than any Indian! I am depressed. Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir, but I sure do hate to see you like this. What if me and the boys were to shoot that nigger dead? Would that pep you up some? Well, it might help. All right, boys. On the count of three. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Don't pay no attention to that alky. He can't even hold a gun, much less shoot it. Like I said. On the count of three. One... ...two... ...three! Well, just don't sit there looking stupid, grasping your hands in pain. How about a little applause for the Waco Kid? All right, I'm through being Mr. Goodbar! The time has come to act and act quickly! All my plans have backfired! Instead of the people leaving, they're staying in droves! Vhy don't you admit it? He's too much of man for you. I know. You going to need an army to beat him! You're finished. Fertig! Fahrblunged! Fahrcocked! Shut up! You Teutonic twat! I must think. Wait a minute. She said army. Of course! An army of the worst dregs ever to soil the face of the West! I've decided to launch an attack that will reduce Rock Ridge to ashes! What do you want me to do, sir? I want you to round up every vicious criminal and gunslinger in the West. Take this down. I want rustlers, cutthroats, murderers, bounty hunters... ...desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, half-wits, dimwits... ...vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits... ...muggers, buggerers, bushwackers, hornswagglers... ...horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers... ...shit kickers and Methodists! Could you repeat that, sir? Where's everybody going? Read this. Well, can't you see that's the last act of a desperate man? We don't care if it's the First Act of Henry the Fifth! We're leaving! Now, wait a minute! Wait just one doggoned minute! Just give me 24 hours to come up with a brilliant idea to save our town. Just 24 hours, that's all I ask. No! You'd do it for Randolph Scott. All right, sheriff. 24 hours. Next! Qualifications? Rape, murder, arson and rape. You said rape twice. I like rape. Charming. Sign right here. Take that badge. Qualifications? Arson, armed robbery, mayhem. Wait a moment. What have you got in your mouth? Nothing, eh? Lyle. Gum! Chewing gum on line, eh? I hope you brought enough for everybody. I didn't know there was going to be so many. Boy, is he strict! We've got to get in there close and find out what's happening. There's our ticket! Hey, boys! Look what I've got there! Hey, where are the white women at? Man, that was pretty! I liked that. Be ready to attack Rock Ridge at noon tomorrow. Here's your badge. We don't need no stinkin' badges! Next! Qualifications? Stampeding cattle. That's not much of a crime. Through the Vatican! Kinky! Why, Rhett, how many times have I told you... ...to wash up after weekly cross-burning? See, it's coming off. And now, for my next impression, Jesse Owens! Catch them! Hold up, men, we'll head them off at the pass! Head them off at the pass? I hate that clich! Say, ""hello. "" Hello. Listen to me, and listen to me good. I want you to get all the brothers together... ...round up all the lumber, canvas, paint and nails you can lay your hands on... ...and meet me tonight 3 miles due east of Rock Ridge at midnight. You understand? Say, ""goodbye. "" Thanks a lot, brother. All right, folks, I know you're a bit confused wondering what you're doing... ...out in the middle of the prairie in the middle of the night. You bet your ass! I'm hip. Now, before the sun comes up... ...we're going to build on this sight an exact replica of the town of Rock Ridge. Every building, every storefront, every rock and every tree... ...right down to the orange roof on Howard Johnson's outhouse. I get it! And tomorrow when Hedley Lamarr and his men come riding in... ...to destroy the real Rock Ridge... ...they'll actually be destroying the fake Rock Ridge! But they'll think it's the real Rock Ridge! But we'll know it's the fake Rock Ridge! How're we going to do it? We don't have the time nor the people. Wrong! There's why. Who the hell are they? Railroad workers. They've agreed to help us make our dream come true. And all they ask in return is a little plot of land... ...they can call their own to homestead. What do you say? We'll give some land to the niggers and the chinks... ...but we don't want the Irish! No deal. Ah, prairie shit! Everybody! Oh, Lord... ...do we have the strength to carry on this mighty task in one night? Or are we just jerking off? Okay, okay, we have done it. Now, let's see what we have done. Men, you are about to embark on a great crusade... ...to stamp out runaway decency in the West. Now you will only be risking your lives... ...whilst I will be risking an almost certain Academy Award nomination... ...for Best Supporting Actor. Now raise your right hand for the pledge. Right! And repeat after me. I... ...your name... ...your name... Schmucks! ... pledge allegiance... ...pledge allegiance... ...to Hedley Lamarr... ...to Hedy Lamarr... That's Hedley! ...that's Hedley... ...and to the evil... ...and to the evil... ...for which he stands! ...for which he stands! Now go do that voodoo that you do so well! Hold the happiness. We are in trouble. Yep! We forgot one little detail. Nothing is missing. Everything is here, down to the last hitching post. People. There are no people. Now don't panic. Don't panic. We just made a perfect copy of Rock Ridge. Now all we've got to do is make perfect copies of ourselves. But they'll be here in half an hour. Right, so we've got to start working fast. You men start working on the dummies. Jim and Mongo, come with me. I've got an idea that will slow them down to a crawl. All right, let's go! Yeah, that's nice. Le Petomane Thruway! Now what will that asshole think of next? Has anybody got a dime? Somebody's got to go back and get a shit-load of dimes. Hurry up. Speed it up or we're never going to get to Rock Ridge! Come on, move them through! Well, they're through the tollbooth. Look at this, they're buying it! All right, here we go. Hold your ears, folks! It's show time! Nothing! What are we going to do? Any minute now they're going to discover the town is fake and pull out! You think you could squeeze off a little shot from here... ...and set off the dynamite down there? I'll give it a try. Oh, Lord, keep this man's eye keen... ...and may God grant... It's a fake! We've been suckered in! Okay, folks, let's wipe them out! Forgive me, Lord! ""Throw out your hands, stick out your tush. ""Hands on your hips, give them a push. ""You'll be surprised, you're doing the French Mistake. Voil!"" All right, cut! Wrong! Just watch me. It's so simple! You sissy Marys! Give me the playback. And watch me, faggots! Have you got it? Yessssssss. Sounds like steam escaping! Action! Okay, wait until I get out. Cut! What in the hell do you think you're doing here? This is a closed set! Piss on you! I'm working for Mel Brooks. Not in the face! Thank you. They've hit Buddy! Come on, girls! You vulgar shit! Why, you miserable pansy! I'm parked over by the commissary. You brute, you brute, you vicious brute! All right, all right... How many days do you have left, Joey? They lose me right after the bunker scene. What the hell is that? Get your pies for the great pie fight! This is our Studio commissary where some Hollywood stars... ...come to eat. Keep in line. And now we'll go to the Special Effects Department. Yankee bean soup, cole slaw and tuna surprise. Taxi! Drive me off this picture! You dropped your beads. One, please. Uh, student. Are you kidding? Pain in the ass. Look, Herman, I'm in Hedy Lamarr's shoes! Hedley! Freeze it! Okay, Lamarr, go for your gun. Wait, wait, I'm unarmed. All right, we'll settle it like men. With our fists. Sorry, I just remembered. I am armed. How did he do such fantastic stunts with such little feet? You shot the bad guy! Well, what do you want to do now? Come on, let's check out the end of the flick. I sure hope there's a happy ending. I love a happy ending. Sheriff, you can't go now. We need you. My work here is done. I'm needed elsewhere now. I'm needed wherever outlaws rule the West. Wherever innocent women and children are afraid to walk the streets. Wherever a man cannot live in simple dignity. Wherever people cry out for justice. Bullshit! All right, you caught me. To speak the plain truth, it's getting pretty damn dull around here. Good luck, Bart, and God bless you. 'Bye, baby brother. Keep the faith, brothers! Where are you headed, cowboy? Nowhere special. Nowhere special. I always wanted to go there. Come on! ""He conquered fear and he conquered hate. "" ""He turned our night into day. "", Previously on Siren... Just want to know where he is, the one who killed my dad! That's the reason you can't go back in the water. You help me with my problem, I help you with yours. I sense he is one of us. I knew I was different. Addiction, mental illness, rare autoimmune condition. Stop! Your mother. My sister. Gone. - Cute place. - Glen, what are you doing here? I need you, Susan. You need me, too. Maddie, when did you get home? You're high. Ben is in my dream. You might just be scared of your feelings for him. Who do you think about?  Ben. And you. - Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 - - www.addic7ed.com - Good morning. That was nice. Being together last night. Yes. Together. Yeah, it was. When we kiss, why do Ben and Maddie stop? Don't look at me. Well, we thought maybe you weren't ready to... Do more. Yes. Ryn wants more. In water, we mate. On land, we mate, too, but we also... Make love. Make love? Yeah. It's, uh... It's like mating, just not for making babies. It's, um... Mostly we do it because it, um... Because it feels good. Because we love the person. I don't think mating feels so good for them, especially the males. The females, uh, they bite them, they hit them with their tails. Sometimes males die from too much mating. Right. Um, on land, it feels better when things are equal. Equal? The same. It feels good for everyone. Everyone gives love and gets love. In water, female, male not equal. Maybe this is bad? No, not bad, just different. And on land, things aren't always equal, either. I would like to make love. With Ben and Maddie. I think we'd like that. Yeah. Sister's daughter's gone. What? Maybe she went to see the others. Helen, it's Maddie. Damn! They can't keep doing this. They're nocturnal, I'm not. Okay, I'm not gonna lie. This is, uh... This is probably gonna hurt, all right? Ready? Whoa! Yesterday, your guts were hanging out. Today, you're healed. All right, so, um... So I think this is gonna work. Our little arrangement? Win-win. I scratch your back... Maybe that's, um... We both want the same thing. You want to get back in the water, I want that, too. I'll figure out a way to make that happen. And you, you're gonna help me get the one who killed my dad. Okay. Let's do this. Katrina. Stop! Down. Now. Not safe to change. Only when you need. That's why they came here? They want to be in water. In their natural state. Someday, you can go back home. Just not right now. Oh. Thank God, they're here. I brought a little bit of food. There's not much, Ryn. They're going to have to share. You eat now. You eat with them. Go. You eat. Hey! Where you going? Hey! Hey, come back here! We had a deal! Come on! Okay. Fine! Fine, just... Do it your way. It was important, what you did. For them to stay here, they have to let go of the old ways. And it won't be forever. Yes. I know. Okay. We go. Ben. Uh, yeah, sure, you can come with me. I got work to do. Come on. I'll keep a good eye on them. Is he okay here on his own? Yes. He protects. It is good for him. Spaghetti for you! Spaghetti for you! Mommy, I love you. Watch! Slide! Whee! I really need to go check on my mom. I've avoided her long enough. Mother makes you sad. I can handle it. Come. You have pain. Inside. Mother. I bring you to her. Oh, uh, hey. Finally. You guys really set your own hours around here, huh? Uh, yeah, things have been a little unpredictable lately. That is, uh, Levi, my intern. Hey, Levi, what's up? So what's, uh... What's going on? Look, I owe you a thank you. You told me that Klesco Oil was connected with those beached whales? - Yep. - You were right. They were dragging that sonic cannon, like you said, mapping the ocean, and looks like they found something down there. What did they find? Oil. Or, actually, the, uh... The potential for oil. Right. So now they bring in a drill ship, and they start poking holes to confirm the deposits. Did they say where this might be happening? Just off the coast here. If they find oil down there, none of this is gonna stop. The mapping, the drilling. Might have more than a few beached whales on your hands. The ecosystem can't handle it. It'll collapse. These assholes can't get away with it. So let's get this out there. Once my segment's ready, you do an on-camera with me. Of course. Whatever it takes. Did you happen to catch when the drill ship is being brought in? If I had to guess, any day now. Here is mother. No. There was a fight. Your mother was hurt. Who hurt mother? A human. Human? - Human?! - It was accident. Not all humans are bad. Not all humans kill. You! Human! When we were at the Marine Research Center, that guy came by. Did you understand what he was telling me? Ben? Shit. - Hey, man, you here? - Get back. Not a sound, okay? - Hey, Xan, what's up? - Hey. We need to talk. All right, let's, uh... Let's go down to The Anchor, grab a bite to eat. I'm starving. Yeah. Yeah, sure. All right. Aw, damn. Uh, my phone. I'll be right back. Yes. Xander. The man you killed, that was Xander's father. Now, that is why I need you to stay inside here. If you go out and Xander sees you, bad things will happen. Tell me you understand what I'm saying. Yes. I stay. Okay. I'll be back.  Nobody's home...  Yesterday, when you stopped by the boat, I was hiding something. Someone. I found one of them, the one that was there the night of the street fight? She was dying in the middle of the road, so I took her back to The North Star... Xander, she is dangerous, man. You gotta be careful. I know. She's crazy, for sure. I mean, I started calling her Katrina, - with the hurricane? - Yeah. She says that none of them want to be here. I mean, they want to go back. I want to help make that happen. They can't go back, not with the noise pollution out there. - And it's only getting worse. - What do you mean? They found oil. They're bringing in a drill ship. It's all ramping up. What's that gonna do to our fishing lanes? Honestly? Five, ten years, there won't be anything left. Xander, we're gonna stop this. We're gonna figure it out, Xan, save our waters. Mom? I'm back. Mom? Mom! Mom? Uh, yeah? I didn't hear you come in. Are you okay? What happened? I'm sorry. I was doing good, I was, and then I... I messed up, and I called him. Who did you call? His name is Glen. - Who is he? - He's... He supplies me. He brought drugs into this house? I started to get really shaky, and, um, I don't know, I knew where he was staying, so I went there for more. All right, gentlemen, here are your pancakes. Thanks, babe. And I'll see you later tonight? - Yeah. Yeah, definitely. - Okay. ""Thanks, babe""? She's nice. Okay? We're just seeing where it goes. I'm happy for you. She seems cool. Yeah.  And it burns, baby, I'm bad   'Cause it's so good, good to be bad   Don't blow it now   I don't brag, brag  -  It's so good, good to be bad   If it burns, baby, I'm bad   'Cause it's so good, good to be bad  The others? Ryn. I bring together. To water. Home. Come. The others. Where? Lot of people been installing these lately. That right? Yeah. It's... It's the drugs. It causes a rise in crime. We hear about it all. Locksmiths, we are the first line of defense. - Oh, hey. - Hey. You have a break-in? Break-out, actually. My house guests like to wander. Where are they now? Upstairs, sleeping. I shouldn't have stopped by. No, no, not at all. I'm happy you came. All set. Nobody's getting in or out, unless you want 'em to. Ooh. I forget every time what it feels like to come down. Thank you. Perhaps you should think about that next time you start using. There are things that I can't control. Like your father going off to Seattle and leaving me alone. Mom, you gotta stop blaming someone else for your problem. Have you been cheating on Dad? No. I know I'm a lot of things, but a cheater isn't one of them. Glen was my dealer up there, but we were never romantic. Why did he come find you here? Because I called him. Yesterday. I know your father gets back tonight, and I will tell him the truth, that I relapsed. And no matter what happens, I promise you, I will not stop trying to get better. You're my proof that I did one thing right. Glen? He said he had business in Port Angeles. Stay here. Ryn. Mom, it's my friend! I'll be right back. Is everything okay? I tell sister's daughter what happen. That human kill her mother. No more secret. What did she say? She say Ryn... Is human. Hi. Um, Helen just went to put some clothes in the laundry. That's... That's mine. Uh, I don't think you want that. That's medicine. Hurt? Yeah, I... I am. Oh, good. You're getting acquainted. Something like that, yeah. Maddie, aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend? Mom, this is Ryn. Nice to meet you. I'm Susan. Hello, Susan. You girls don't have to stay out here. Ryn, do you like tea? Mom, it's okay. Tea? Be careful, it's hot. Nice tea. Ryn, do I, uh, detect an accent? She's an exchange student. Oh, okay. I'm really good at this. I'm gonna say somewhere in Europe. Scandinavia? Iceland. More like Finland. Okay, that's close! Your face is hurt. Yes. I got hurt. Why? Mom, you don't have to... I spent time with some bad people. You are bad? No. She's not bad. She's good. I guess you can say I'm a work in progress. No. No. - No no no no no! No, no! - What's wrong? - My ring. - What? I like your mother. Really? Yes. She love Maddie. It's not in there. It must be in his room at the Siren Song. I gotta go! I gotta get my ring! No way! He might be there. He's gone at least until tomorrow. I have to get it. Mom, you can't. It's my wedding ring. I'll take you. Come on. I go with you. Mother. Human kill mother. Yes. Ryn let human kill. I go home. To water. Come. No humans. No Ryn. What'd your mother do now? Nothing. Oh, now you got me really worried. Yeah. You heard about Klesco, how they've been mapping the area for oil deposits? Sure. They're gonna be moving in a drill ship just off Thompson Seamount. Hmm. Where'd you hear that? A reporter reached out to me. This is gonna destroy our waters. You know that, right? Let's not overreact, Ben. First of all, these things take time. Nothing's going to happen overnight. If they were just mapping, you might be right. But they're not. They found oil, Dad. Do you get that? They're not going away. What do you want me to do about it? Form a coalition, local business owners. Put some pressure on them. Because, you know, we can't stop progress. This is not progress. You got a good heart, Ben. I wish we were all more like you. I'll make a few calls, see what I can do. Thanks, Dad. They know about art? Oh, they know about a lot of things. Civilized, in their own way. There's something I have to tell you, Helen. When we first met, you asked me if I had any living relatives. I said no. Yeah? This is my sister. Beth. She's like us? I'd always assumed I was the only one, but of course there are more. Beth isn't like us. How so? She's got a perfect life. Husband, kids, nice house. I didn't fit into that, obviously. We got into fights, and, uh, she said that I was a danger to her. She had me committed to a state hospital. After that, she refused to see me. Like I don't exist. I'm so sorry. Maybe if you told her the truth, she'd understand. Maybe your sister has been struggling on the inside the same as you. - What, a camera? - Yeah. I want to see what we're really up against. What, the oil boat? No, they're dragging a sonic cannon through the water for mapping. Right. So, what's my job? You get me close, then you wait. Uh, what if they spot me? Sockeye are running. Just a wayward trawler out for an evening catch. All right. Dumb fisherman. Part I was born to play. Let's go. Mom, wait. Do you have the room key? No. We need to be smart about this. I need to get that ring back. Mom, you're not gonna break into a motel room. All right, so then what do we do? I'll figure it out. What room is it? Um, 202, but I don't want you cleaning up my mess. I'm not cleaning up your mess. I'm helping you. Big difference. I find your ring, you put this behind you, and we move forward. Okay. Yes. Hello? It's Helen. Are you here? We brought you some food. Ohh... My God. You're beautiful. Where did you and Maddie meet? On land. I hope so. I meet Maddie with Ben. Oh. Okay. Maddie really seems to love that Ben. Yes. Ben is love. Oh. That's sweet. I would like to make love with Ben and Maddie. Oh. O... kay. These are restricted waters. Clear the area. Repeat. Clear the lane. What?! - Clear the area! - No, I can't hear you! It's a... It's a good night for sockeye, yeah?! They're really runnin'! Had to push 'em apart into the wall, but... As they're coming out of the turn, he is leaving him absolutely no room. I mean, they are just screaming tandem. Family. You come with. Um, excuse me? Yeah. Somebody threw a bunch of lounge chairs into the pool. Seriously? Seriously. I don't get paid enough for this shit. Shit. Who the hell are you? What're you doing here? - The power of that thing. - Yeah? Yeah, I had no idea it would be so intense. It blasted me back, Xander, like, a hundred feet. Wow, that's crazy, man. Hey, there they are. Uh, dude, you should see this. Well, I appreciate you understanding me needing to get my mom's ring back. No problem. Your mom, she's very special to me. I need to get going. I was just needing to... Not yet. Hang out for a bit. My mom's married to a sheriff. Yeah. Where's he? I don't want any trouble. No one does. I was just living my life, and then, ring, your mom calls up, wants to make things right. She wants to move on with her life. Does she? 'Cause she called me. You bitch! No! All right, you and me time. Come on! Yah! - Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 - - www.addic7ed.com -, All right, Eleanora. Eleanora. Miss Holiday. You better haul your little black ass in here. Slow. It's about time. Girl, if you wants to lay around all day, you is in the wrong end of the business. When I give it away for the first time, it ain't gonna be to no $2 john... in East Baltimore. That's for damn sure. At the rate you going, by the time you decide to give it away... you'll have to pay some john $2 just to take it. I's here, y'all. I got my $2. That's dynamite.

I'm trying to talk to this... Now, what do a fine man like you want with a child like this? She ain't 15 years old yet. - What that got to do with anything? - I know. I come here to spend my money. Suppose I take you over here and show you a real woman... who could give you your money's worth. No. No, that one's plenty woman enough for me. Don't try to give me no jive, broad. I see what I want. I come here to spend my money. And I see what I want, and this is it. - Come on. Come on, now. - Well, you can't get what you see. And since you don't want what you can get... then you know where you can go, and this is it. We don't need his kind, no way. Imagine him making all that fuss over one young kid. - He must have been good and drunk. - Yeah, drunk or blind. Shit. All right, honey. You can go now. That's enough. Honey. You are wearing this thing out and me with it. Now, why don't you take it with you and make it a good home? You mean, I can have it? If you can get out of here with it before I can count to 10. One... two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight... nine, ten. Eleanora. Eleanora. The good Lord give you two long legs to run with... and He give me two strong hands... to beat your black behind blue the next time you slowpoke home... when you know we got an all-night drive before we get to Cousin Charlotte's. - Sorry. - Now, here. You take these here keys and make sure you use them. I don't wanna come back here Sunday night and find the house all cleaned out. Talking about cleaning, you didn't do the steps this week... and the oven could use a good scrubbing. I didn't have time to make the beds, and there's washing to be put out. Wave goodbye to your cousin Eleanora. I'm gonna call Reverend Jones and make sure you get to church on Sunday. Now, you be a good girl, Eleanora, and next time you can come with us. There's a letter inside from your mama from New York. And empty out the pan under the icebox.

Funny girl! And then the missus woke up... and saw that he hadn't come home all night. And then wouldn't she hit the ceiling! Went running all over the place... flopping that old yellow nightgown of hers, you know... and looking for him and calling, ""Charles? ""Charlee?"" I sure hope they get their problems all settled... before they get back here in the morning. Uh-oh. Got my polishing to do. See you, girl. - This your kid, Sadie? - Yes, sir. You know she shouldn't be walking around by herself in this neighborhood. - You know what I mean? - Yes, sir. Guess you heard about what happened. I came all the way from Baltimore to see you, Ma. My baby. Thank you, Mama. Sure is gonna be great staying together again, ain't it, Ma? Ain't it, Ma? Honey, you know there ain't nothing your mama wouldn't do for you. Nothing in the world. You can stay the night, but the madam's coming home in the morning. I understand, Mama. Sister Edson. I bet you, if I called her and asked her... She's a lady from our church, and she's always willing to help nice, young girls. And since you're my daughter... I bet she'd be willing to let you do some housework... for your room and your board. - I'm sorry, baby. - It's all right, Mama. Can't fault you for what ain't your fault. I'll be all right. Come in, missy. Excuse me, miss. Is you ""Miss Lorraine Edson... 290139th Street, Harlem""? Yes, honey, I sure am. And you must be Sadie's girl. Yes, ma'am. I am. Well, the good Lord's delivered you safe and sound. My mama told me to say thank you for taking me in. And she told me also to tell you... that you have the best rooming house in Harlem... and that I ain't supposed to be lazy and I supposed to work real, real hard. Well, now, that's a fine spirit you got, honey. And I want you to just make yourself right at home. Okay. Rest your things. Look around. I'll be right back. That's a fine young girl. Well, now, honey, I'll show you my whole place, upstairs and down. I don't want to see the upstairs, Miss Edson... 'cause my Mama told me you had a job for me as a cleaner. And that's what I got, missy. I mean, you're the one with other things on your mind. Wishful thinking, I call it. 'Cause, girl, let's face it... you got a long way to go... before you can earn $2 for just 10 minutes of your time... or ain't you looked at yourself lately? That lazy bitch. She don't look where she's going. Ain't it a shame how some of God's children have it so easy... and others have it so hard? ""Ain't it a shame?"" Last night, night before Two different robbers at my door Come on. Kid, come on, beat it. - Mister, is the boss around? - You're saying goodbye to him. Bye-bye. Okay, but look, I work in the neighborhood already... and I'd be willing to quit working and come up here and work for you. Yeah, I'd be very happy to quit, too. Come on, honey. - But I can sing. I really can. - Yeah. I can dance, and I know the words to every song that's out today. I mean, I've been really rehearsing and everything. That's very good. So do I. But I tell you... in order to be a showgirl, you gotta have something to show. Well, I got something. I really do. All you have to do is push it up a bit and put some lip rouge on. I could do it, mister, give me a break. Look, really, I'm good. - All you have to do is give me a chance. - Listen, girlie. Listen to me. I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but no amount of slinky... and makeup is gonna change you into a female that looks... like that. Louis, so good to see you. I'll get you a great table. How about a nice table for Mr. McKay? What you looking at? Don't your mama make you wash steps? Shake it to the east Shake it to the west Shake it to the one that you love the best - Now? - No, not yet, don't you peek, Mama. - Now? - Not yet. - Now? - No. Now come with me. Surprise. Jesus.

God bless Sister Edson. I can see she's doing right by you. Every time you come over here... you're looking better and better. Still cleaning and washing, no cooking yet? No, not yet. Hey, Mama, I gotta go. It's getting late. I don't wanna miss my train. Honey, I forgot. I got a surprise for you, too. I got me a new job starting next week, and it's gonna be close by you... and I'll be able to walk over most evenings, won't that be nice? And we can visit. That'll be swell, Mama. That'll be just swell. - Just what we always wanted. - Yeah. We'll be able to spend more time together. That'll be real great. Lord have mercy. My baby done made me so happy this day. Eleanora, you're late again. Girl, you done missed two tricks already. You better get the spirit, sister, and get yourself on up them steps... and quit your lollygagging. Didn't you mama teach you how to close doors? If you don't want this job, somebody else sure do. You fine, young thing. You're new in the neighborhood. So, honey, I gotta love you real good. Looky here what Lorraine done sent to me. I never accomplished any great feats... but you know something, baby? I'm something else under them sheets. You see my father was a jockey, and he taught me how to ride. He said, Big Ben, you got to get it from side to side. Now, in case you don't know who I am... I'm Big Ben, baby. Yeah, the lover-man. We gonna have ourselves a ball tonight. Lorraine done sent me this fine dinner. Young and tender. This is where her head was. Won't be there when I get through. 'Cause, see, I'm from the city, and I'm gonna kiss your little titty. Young, and fine, and mellow. Light as a feather. Big Ben told all his men Don't you take no numbers After half past ten What? What's the matter with you, woman? Ain't nothing personal, mister, but I just quit the business. Hell, bitch, you crazy? Ain't this a killer? Lorraine. Hey, Lorraine. Lorraine. What's happening? Who's making all that noise up there? - He said his name is Big Ben. - Big Ben? Ain't you supposed to be upstairs with Big Ben? - I ain't doing it. - What you mean you ain't doing it, girl? You give my place a bad name. Big Ben's the best customer I got. You can't do that. All the girls love Big Ben. He's my best customer, and I'm trying to make something out of you. I sent him up to you. Now, what's the matter with you, girl? You better get the spirit, sister, and get on back upstairs and do your work. - The Lord knows I'm trying to help you... - Miss Edson, honey, I done quit. Done quit? Well, you get on away from around here, then. 'Cause you ain't nothing. You ain't never been nothing, and you ain't gonna be nothing. 'Cause you don't go messing like that with Big Ben. - That's right. - Get your ass back in the house. - You looking for someone, Miss? - Yes.

Nice to meet you. - Louis McKay. - We... We're just fans of yours. And I need all the fans I can get. Pull up a couple of chairs, fellows, and join us. Thank you. Where do you fellows play? Well, actually, we're playing no place right now. Fact is, we're trying to form a band to take a tour around the country... and we wanted to talk to you about joining us. Joining you? You serious? Very. A colored singer with a white band? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? You must want to keep playing no place. Well, you see, that's exactly the point. We wouldn't be just another band with you singing. We'd be something special because, well, you're special, Billie. Here. There you go. Thank you. We'd go straight to the top. I know. I don't know about no straight to the top. I'm just trying to get to a club downtown. We all are. Of course, you don't understand, see, the way you get downtown is... I mean, you know, the way you do that is that you go out on the road... and you build up your name in the sticks, and then, blam! You get snapped up by network radio, who're always looking... for someone big with the hicks to sell them soap or something. Yeah, then you come back to New York... and besides radio, there's records, club dates downtown... - you name it, Billie. - Just like that, huh? Well, it works that way sometimes. You mean to tell me that I have to travel all the way to East Jesus and back... before I can get in some club downtown less than five minutes away from here? - Well... - They full of shit, ain't they? I just think it'd be fantastic if you just came with us. - How about that? - I'm sorry, fellows. I think your band is gonna have to start without me. I'll tell you what. Piano Man's got my telephone number. If you give it some second thoughts, give us a call. How you like my timestep, Reg? I think we might have a part for you, Miss Holiday... but we'll have to see your legs. You know the last time I saw fields and farm animals... I was hitching up north from Baltimore to see my mama. Leader, I am trying to follow a rule called ""food three times a day""... but I sense we are dangerously behind. Let me explain to you. This is only Tuesday, and I only feed on Friday. Stop complaining, Oklahoma. That's a horrible-Iooking thing. You mean we have all this fun, and we still get paid? Well, about $12 a week, to do with what you will. $14? Would you take $8? Fantastic. I'll take whatever you give me. I get the chance to travel. I get a chance to do everything. I sense we're in for a lot of candy stores and a lot of jelly beans. Can you imagine someone liking to tour? Yes, some fun, Billie. Miss Holiday... Miss Holiday... you're in the South now. Jesus, look at this. You got a half an hour, that's all. Billie, let me help you out of there. - A whole half-hour? - Let me help you out. Half an hour's all we got. - Put your shoes on, man. - Get on out here. Billie, what'll it be? What do you want? What do I want? What do I really want? What do you really want? Well, I'll tell you. - What? - I really want... a steak smothered in onions. And I really want a big pot of collard greens. Right. - And I want some yams. - Right. - I want some black-eyed peas and rice. - Right. And I want... potato pie. One hot dog, coming up. - Mustard? - Oh, crap. - Hey, Reg... - Hello, I'm from the Board of Health. Billie, you ain't missing a thing. I cried for you What a fool I used to be Now I found two eyes Just a little bit bluer I found a heart Just a little bit truer And I cried for you Now it's your turn To cry over me Still think it's fun, Billie? Watch it, will you? Sorry to say it's that time again. This has been the Oasis Cosmetics Hour from New York, New York... featuring the new mellow sounds of our Sweet Sam... and His Society Swingers. - So untiI tomorrow night... - Man, did you hear that? - Here we go again. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. - Sweet Sam and His Society Sissies. That's supposed to be us, man. That should be our gig. Do you want to be a sissy? Man, here we are, riding our asses off all over this cotton-picking country... trying to win these hicks over, and what do we got to show for it? Zero. Nothing, man. Bullshit. Where is that big radio cat that's supposed to discover us, Reg? Where is that son of a bitch, anyway? Watch your mouth. Can't you see there's a lady present? That's right. Show some respect, you motherfucker. Billie. Who is it? It's Harry. What do you want? Can I come in? Come on. Gonna be a rehearsal downstairs in 10 minutes. Oh, boy. We got a full day off next week. I'll be dead by next week. I'm taking the night off. You take tonight off... and, sure as hell, that'll be the night... that Mr. Network Radio Scout is sitting out front and all the things... I mean, everything that we've been doing goes right down the drain... because, let's face it, Billie, you are the cream in our coffee. You got that the wrong way around, don't you? We are just another band without you. Okay. Give me a shot of that bourbon in my bag, will you? Well, how about a real... A real what? One shot and you'II... be flying. Look, Harry, like I've been telling you... what you do is your business. I may be tired, but I ain't dumb. You're walking across a street. A truck hits you. You're laying in the street. They take you to the nearest hospital. What's the first thing they do? They give you a shot of morphine. Now, morphine ain't an aspirin. It's dope. Do you think that makes you an addict? One goddamn little shot ain't gonna... make you a junkie, but, you know, it keeps you flying. Okay, Harry. If I get hit by a truck, I'll call you, okay? Now get out of here. Reg, how much longer before we get to the next town... - or a gas station or something? - Well, from the looks of things... it's gonna be back roads and cow pastures for quite a while yet. Pull over to a clump of bushes or something then? - No. - A hedge? - Come on, please. - All right. You have but to ask, madam, this vehicle is at your disposal. - How about the lake? - Come on. All right. You should take a look at it out here. It's beautiful. Look at those trees. Hey, Billie. Where you going? You forgot the sheet music. Just turn your head. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on, Billie. Let's go. All aboard. Southern trees Bear a strange fruit Blood on the leaves And blood at the root Here is a fruit For the crows to pluck For the rain to gather For the wind to suck For the sun to rot For the tree To drop Here is a strange And bitter Crop Now we're proud to present our feature vocalist, Miss Billie Holiday.

All I had to do is listen to your voice on the telephone, and I knew. Who do you think you're talking to? One of those old fake cats you be running around with?

I gotta prove it to them, I gotta prove it to myself. What're you proving with that needle? That you're not woman enough to make it without a crutch... a magic way out when the going gets a little too rough? I want you to make it, too, baby, but not this way. Not this way. Okay. Okay, I promise you I won't take any more stuff. I promise you. I gotta stay out here. You're gonna let me stay? - No. - Louis, please. I get it.

Billie, get out of sight., (thunder crashes) (thunder crashes) (clock strikes) If we look at the base of a brain which has just been removed from a skull there's very little of the mid-brain that we can actually see. Yet, as I demonstrated in my lecture last week if the under aspects of the temporal lobes are gently pulled apart the upper portion of the stem of the brain can be seen. This so-called brain stem consists of the mid-brain a rounded protrusion called the pons and a stalk tapering downwards called the medulla oblongata which passes out of the skull through the foramen magnum and becomes, of course, the spinal cord. Are there any questions before we proceed? I have one question, Dr Frankenstein. That's Fronkonsteen. I beg your pardon? My name. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen. But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein who dug up freshly buried corpses and transformed dead components into Yes, yes! Yes! We all know what he did! But I'd rather be remembered for my own small contributions to science and not because of my accidental relationship to a famous cuckoo! (laughter) Now, if you don't mind, can we have your question? Well, sir, I'm not sure I understand the distinction between reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses. Good. Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction why don't we proceed? Mr Hilltop here, with whom I have never worked or given any prior instructions to has graciously offered his services for today's demonstration. Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet and stand beside this table? Nice hopping. Mr Hilltop would you raise your left knee, please? You have just witnessed a voluntary nerve impulse. It begins as a stimulus from the cerebral cortex passes through the brain stem and to the muscles involved. Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee. Reflex movements are those which are made independently of the will but are carried out along pathways which pass between the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch! (students gasp) We are not aware of these impulses. Neither do we intend them to carry out our contraction of muscles. Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves. But what if we block the nerve impulse by simply applying local pressure which can be done with any ordinary metal clamp just at the swelling on the posterior nerve roots for, oh, say five or six seconds? Why, you mother-grabbing bastard! As you can see, all communication is shut off. (Hilltop moans) (students laugh) In spite of our mechanical magnificence if it were not for this continuous stream of motor impulses we would collapse like a bunch of broccoli! Ohhh! (applause) In conclusion, it should be noted Give him an extra dollar. Extra dollar. Yes, sir. that any more than common injury (moans)  to the nerve root is always serious. Because once a nerve fibre is severed there is no way, in heaven or on earth to regenerate life back into it. Are there any last questions before we leave? Uh, Dr Frank Fronkonsteen Yes? Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means it actually began to move with a voluntary motion? Are you speaking of the worm or the spaghetti? Why, the worm, sir. Yes! It seems to me I did read something of that incident when I was a student. But you have to remember that a worm, with very few exceptions is not a human being. (laughter) But wasn't that the basis of your grandfather's work, sir? The reanimation of dead tissue? My grandfather was a very sick man. But as a Fronkonsteen, aren't you the least bit curious about it? Doesn't bringing back to life what was once dead hold any intrigue for you? You are talking about the nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind. Dead is dead! But look at what has been done with hearts and kidneys. Hearts and kidneys are Tinkertoys! I'm talking about the central nervous system! But, sir I am a scientist, not a philosopher! You have more chance of reanimating this scalpel than of mending a broken nervous system! But what about your grandfather's work? My grandfather's work was doo-doo! I am not interested in death! The only thing that concerns me is the preservation of life! Class is dismissed. (applause) Dr Frankenstein That's Fronkonsteen. My name is Gerhart Falkstein. I have travelled 5,000 miles to bring you the will of your great-grandfather. Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein. Oh, my sweet darling. Oh, my dearest love. I'll count the hours that you're away. Oh, darling, so will I. Not on the lips. What? I'm going to that party at Nanna and Nicky's later. I don't wanna smear my lipstick. You understand. Of course. All aboard! Oh, dear! Well I guess this is it. Freddy, darling! Oh, how can I say in a few minutes what it's taken me a lifetime to understand? Won't you try? All right. You've got it, mister. I'm yours. All of me. What else can I say? My sweet love The hair! The hair! Just been set. Sorry Sorry. I hope you like old-fashioned weddings. I prefer old-fashioned wedding nights! Oh! You're incorrigible! Does that mean you love me? You bet your boots it does. Oh, my only love. (gasps) Taffeta, darling. Taffeta, sweetheart. No, the dress is taffeta. It wrinkles so easily. Oh. All aboard! Oh, there's that horrid man again. Well, hurry now, before I make a fool of myself. Oh! Nails! Oh Sorry Goodbye, darling. Goodbye, Freddy. Darling! (she coughs and splutters) Harry, he was at it again. So what do you want me to do about it? Every day! Let him! Let him! New York next! Everybody out for New York! Heinz, er macht das schon wieder. Na, was soll ich denn da machen? Aber jeden Tag! Nu, lass ihn, lass ihn. Transylvania nchste! Jeder aussteigen fr Transylvania! Transylvania nchste! Jeder aussteigen fr Transylvania! Pardon me, boy! Is this the Transylvania Station? Ja, ja! Track 29! Oh! Can I give you a shine? Uh No, thanks. (train puffing) (footsteps and scraping) Dr Frankenstein? Fronkonsteen. You're putting me on. No. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen. Do you also say Frodorick? No. Frederick. Well, why isn't it Frodorick Fronkonsteen? It isn't. It's Frederick Fronkonsteen. I see. You must be Igor. No. It's pronounced I-gor. But they told me it was Igor. Well, they were wrong then, weren't they? Uh You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you? Yes. My grandfather used to work for your grandfather. (giggles) How nice. Of course, the rates have gone up. Of course. I'm sure we'll get along splendidly. (hollow sound) Oh! Sorry. I Uh You know, I don't mean to embarrass you, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I could help you with that hump. What hump? Let's go. Allow me, master. Oh Thanks very much. Walk this way. This way. (thunder crashes) I think you'll be more comfortable in the rear. Oh (woman) Ooh! What was that? Oh, that'll be Inga. Herr Falkstein thought you might need a laboratory assistant temporarily. Oh. Ooh! Hello! Would you like to have a roll in the hay? It's fun!  Roll, roll  Roll in the hay Hah! (Freddy) Oh (thunder) Oh! Sometimes I am afraid of the lightning. It's just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of. (howling) Werewolf! Werewolf There! What? There wolf! There castle! Why are you talking that way? I thought you wanted to. No, I don't want to! Suit yourself. I'm easy. Well There it is. Home. What knockers! Oh Thank you, Doctor. Oh. That's all right. There we are. (door creaks) I am Frau Blcher. (horses neigh) Steady! How do you do? I am Dr Fronkonsteen. This is my assistant. Inga, may I present Frau Blcher? (neighing) I wonder what's got into them. Your rooms have been prepared, Herr Doktor. If you will follow me. L-gor! Would you bring the bags as soon as you're finished, please? Yes, master. After you, Frau Blcher. (neighing) Blcher! (neighing) Follow me, please. Stay close to the candles. The staircase can be treacherous. Und this is your room. It was your grandfather Victor's room. I see. Well! Seem to be quite a few books. This was Victor's the Baron's medical library. Where is my grandfather's private library? I don't know what you mean, sir. Well, these books are very general. Any doctor might have them in his study. This is the only library I know of, Dr Frankenstone. Fronkonsteen. Fronkonsteen. Well, we'll see. Good night. Would the doctor care for a brandy before retiring? No Thank you. Some warm milk perhaps? No thank you very much. No, thanks. Ovaltine? Nothing! Thank you. I'm a little tired. Then I will say good night. Good night! Good night, darling. (kisses) Good night, Herr Doktor. Good night, Frau Blcher. (neighing) (groans) No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not a Frankenstein. I am not a Frankenstein! I'm a Fronkonsteen! Don't gimme that! I don't believe in fate! And I won't say it. All right, you win! You win! I give. I'll say it. I'll say it, I'll say it. Destiny! Destiny! No escaping that for me! Destiny! Destiny! No escaping that for me! Destiny! Destiny No escaping (gasps) Dr Fronkonsteen! Wake up! What is it? You were having a nightmare. (faint violin music) What's that strange music? I have no idea. But it seems to be coming from behind the bookcase. Behind the bookcase Hand me that robe, would you, dear? You were right. It's coming from behind this wall. Where is it? Where is it? What? There's always a device. If I can just spot the triggering mechanism Hello! It seems louder over here. Hand me that candle, will you? Put the candle back! All right! I think I have it figured out now. Take out the candle and I'll block the bookcase with my body. (crunch) (high-pitched voice) Listen to me very carefully. Don't put the candle back! With all of your might shove against the other side of the bookcase. Is that perfectly clear? I think so. Good girl! Put the candle back! Oh, look, Doctor! A passageway! Whatever that music is, it's coming from down there. I'd better take a look. Oh, let me come with you, Doctor, please. I don't wanna stay up here alone. All right, then. Close your robe and follow me. Oh, Doctor! The candle Good thinking. Let's try this one. Stand back! ( violin continues) (thunder crashes) (Inga gasps) (squeaks) Don't be frightened, dear. Just a rat. A filthy, slimy rat! (door creaks) Good Lord! Oh!  I Ohh!  Ain't got nobody  And nobody cares for me  Yak-a-tata, yak-a-tata-ta-ta, hah! L-gor! Frodorick. How did you get here? Through the dumbwaiter. I heard the strangest music from the upstairs kitchen and I just followed it down. Call it a hunch. Brrrm-chee! There must have been someone else down here. It would seem that way. And there's the only other door. Wait, master. It might be dangerous. You go first. Aren't there any lights in this place? Two nasty-looking switches over here, but I'm not going to be the first. Well Damn your eyes! Too late! (Inga) Ohh So this is where it all happened. (man) Just think! A dead brain ready to live again in a new body! Look! No blood, no decomposition. Just a few sutures. Throw the main switch. Yes, master. (crackling) What a filthy mess! I dunno. A little paint, a few flowers, couple of throw pillows Well, it seems as if our mysterious violinist has disa p Disa what? peared. Ssh! (whispers) There is a light coming from behind that door. (whispers) Follow me! (gasps) Doctor! Look! Well This explains the music. It's still warm. Mm. But who was playing it? I don't know but whoever it was just barely finished putting out his cigar. Such strange goings-on! What is this place? Music room? But there's nothing here but books and papers! Books and papers? It is! This is my grandfather's private library! I feel it! Look! Look at this! (heavy breathing) (Freddy) Until, from the midst of this darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me. A light so brilliant and wondrous, and yet so simple. Change the poles from plus to minus and from minus to plus. Ah ah I alone succeeded in discovering the secret of bestowing life. Nay, even more I myself became capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter! It could work! (thunder crashes) Kipper? Mm. Thank you, Doctor. As the minuteness of the parts formed a hindrance to my speed I resolved therefore to make the creature of a gigantic stature. Of course! That would simplify everything. In other words his veins, his feet, his hands, his organs would all have to be increased in size. Exactly. He would have an enormous Schwanzstck! That goes without saying. Woof! He's gonna be very popular. So then What we're aiming for is a being approximately seven feet in height with all features either congenitally or artificially proportionate in size. Something like this? Hello You've caught something there. Crude, yes, primitive, yes, perhaps even grotesque yet something inexplicable tells me that this might be our man! All right, all right. That's good enough for the likes of'im. Get down, you fool! Now! What a filthy job! Could be worse. How? Could be raining. (footsteps) Quick! Need a hand? Uh No, thanks. I have one. Thanks very much all the same. Just a moment, sir! I know everyone around here, but I've never seen your face before. Can you account for yourself? Yes. I am Dr Frederick Fronkonsteen, newly arrived from America. Oh, yes, sir! I was told you were here. Well, I'm Constable Henry, sir. Pleased to meet you. (Freddy stamps foot) How very nice to meet you, Constable. Why, you're chilled to the bone, sir. Ooh! A nice, warm fire would be the thing for you. Yes, yes. A little nip from the old bottle wouldn't be too bad either, sir. That's the ticket, yes! Well, if you have everything in hand, sir, I'll say good night. Thank you very much, Constable. At your service, sir, always. (stamps foot) Good night, Constable. Good night, sir. Oh, what an awesome sight! What a profound and reverend night is this. With such a specimen for a body all we need now is an equally magnificent brain. You know what to do? I have a pretty good idea. Good man. Didn't you Didn't you use to have that on the other side? What? Your, uh Oh, never mind. Do you have that name I gave you? I have it written down. H Delbruck. Hans Delbruck. (thunder rumbles) Ohh! (Inga) He is hideous. (Freddy) He's beautiful. And he is mine! (thunder crashes) Hurry now. We're fighting time and the elements. Are you ready? Are you sure this is how they did it? Yes, yes! It's all written down in the notes! Now tie off the kites and hurry down as fast as you can. What's the hurry? There's a possibility of electrocution. Do you understand? I say There's a possibility of electrocution! Do you understand? I understand, I understand. Why are you shouting? Did you Did you tie off the kites? Of course. Oh All right. Good. (hollow sound) Uh Check the generator. Yes, master. L-gor! Release the safety valve on the main wheel. Yes, master. (thunder crashes) Can you imagine the brain of Hans Delbruck in this body? Oh, Frederick! This is the moment. Well, dear Are you ready? Yes, Doctor. Elevate me. Now? Right here? Yes, yes. Raise the platform. Oh! The platform! Oh, that! Ja yes. From that fateful day when stinking bits of slime first crawled from the sea and shouted to the cold stars I am man! our greatest dread has always been the knowledge of our own mortality. But tonight we shall hurl the gauntlet of science into the frightful face of death itself. Tonight we shall ascend into the heavens! We shall mock the earthquake! We shall command the thunders and penetrate into the very womb of impervious nature herself! (thunder crashing) (wind howling) When I give the word, throw the first switch! You've got it, master. Get ready! Get set! Go! (electricity crackles) Throw the second switch! Throw the third switch! Not the third switch? Throw it, I say! Throw it! Life! Life, do you hear me? Give my creation life! Turn everything off and bring me down! Nothing! Oh, Doctor. I'm sorry No, no. Be of good cheer. If science teaches us anything it teaches us to accept our failures as well as our successes with quiet dignity and grace. Son of a bitch, bastard! I'll get you for this! What did you do to me? What did you do to me? Doctor! Doctor! Stop it! You'll kill him! Agh! I don't wanna live! I do not want to live! (sobbing) Quiet dignity and grace. Ohhh! Mama! Oh, tosh! This man is different, I tell you! You can see that after you've talked to him for five minutes. Yes? He's a Frankenstein! And they're all alike! (shouting in agreement) It's in their blood. They can't'elp it. All those scientists, they're all alike. They say they're working for us. What they really want is to rule the world! (gavel) That's enough now! I will not have this meeting become a free-for-all! These are very serious charges you're making and all the more painful to us, your elders, because we still have nightmares from five times before. Now we haven't heard from the one man most qualified to judge the situation fairly. Inspector Kemp! Will you talk to us, please? (clicking) (hissing) A riot is an ugly thing und once you get one started there is little chance of stopping it short of bloodshed. I think before we go around killing people we had better make damn sure of our evidence. Und we had better confirm the fact that young Frankenstein is indeed vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps! (all) What? Vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps! Vootstaps! Oh! Footsteps! I think what is in order is for me to pay a little visit on the good doctor und to have a nice quiet chat. (Freddy) Reputation! Reputation! (Inga) Oh, Doctor! You mustn't do this to yourself. You've got to stop thinking about it. Why, look! You haven't even touched your food. There! Now I've touched it. Happy? You know I'll never forget my old dad. When these things would happen to him the things he'd say to me. What did he say? What the hell are you doin' in the bathroom day and night? Why don't you get outta there and give someone else a chance? Oh, maybe it's better this way. The poor lifeless hulk. Maybe it is better off dead. (monster) Mmmm! What is this? Schwarzwlder Kirschtorte. Mmmmm! Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial to desserts myself, but this is excellent. Who are you talking to? To you! You just made a yummy sound, so I thought you liked the dessert. I didn't make a yummy sound. I just asked you what it is. But you did. I just heard it. It wasn't me. It wasn't me! Well, now, look here. If it wasn't you and it wasn't you Mmmm! (monster moans) (Freddy gasps) Alive! It's alive! It's alive! Stand back. Hello, there. I'm going to set you free. Mmmm Is the sedative ready? (Inga) Yes, Doctor. Mmmm. I want you to sit up. Mmmm. Stand on your feet. (high-pitched) Mmm! You can do it. Mmmm. Now walk! Doctor, I'm frightened! Don't worry. Good. Good! (monster screams) What is it? What's the matter? Quick! Give him the (monster yells) Quick! Give him the What? Give him the what? (gasps) Three syllables. First syllable sounds like Head! Uh, sounds like head! Bed! Uh Said (both) Said! Said! Said! Second syllable little word. Uh this, that, the A Said a Said a Dirty word! He said a dirty word! Oh, sounds like Uh, to give! Give! Said Said a give Give him a said a give! Oh! Tive tive Sedative! On the nosey! (monster groans) (Freddy pants) Said a give Oh, Frederick! Are you all right? Yes! Would you excuse me for one minute, dear? Of course, Doctor. L-gor (clears throat) May I speak to you for a moment? Of course. Sit down, won't you? Thank you. No, no. Up here. Thank you. Now that brain that you gave me Was it Hans Delbruck's? No. Ah! Good. Uh Would you mind telling me whose brain I did put in? Then you won't be angry? I will not be angry. Abby someone. Abby someone Abby who? Abby Normal. Abby Normal I'm almost sure that was the name. Are you saying that I put an abnormal brain into a seven-and-a-half-foot long 54-inch wide gorilla Is that what you're telling me Quick, quick! Give him the What? Three syllables, yes! (loud knocking) I wonder who that could be at this hour. Inga, quick! See who that is. You put that thing back on the operating table. And strap him down tightly! Where are you going? To wash up. I've got to look normal. We've all of us got to behave normally! Hah! Monsters! Excellent shot. This is the 20th century, Kemp. Monsters are pass like ghosts and goblins. Not to the good people of this village, Herr Doktor. To them he is a very real thing. Especially when there is a Frankenstein residing in this house. (imitates sound of darts) Nice grouping. Thank you. I wouldn't think an intelligent fellow like you would fall for all this superstitious rot! It is not superstition that worries me, Herr Doktor, but genes und chromosomes! Rubbish! Hm, well, you might say, but this is Transylvania! Und you are a Frankenstein! You, uh seem unusually upset by this discussion. Not in the least. (cat yowls) I find it extremely amusing, that's all. (glass smashing) Well this was fun! Now, if you don't mind, Inspector, I'm a little tired. Then I may give the villagers your complete assurance that you have no interest whatsoever in carrying on your grandfather's work? (monster) Mmmmm! May I take that for a yes? Mmmmm! Very well. You can find the way out by yourself? Of course. Until we meet again Herr Baron. Yes. Drop by any time. We are always open. (clicks heels) Dieser verdammte Arm! (door creaks) (door creaks) (gasps) Oh, Victor! Victor We have done it! I'm going to set you free. Would you like that, meine Seuchekopf? Mmm! (sobbing) They wanted to hurt you! But I'm going to help you! Thank heavens that's over with. Frau Blcher! (neighing) Stop! Don't come closer! (Freddy) What are you doing? I'm going to set him free! No! No, you mustn't! Yes! Are you insane? He'll kill you! No, he won't. Not this one. He is as gentle as a lamb. (monster roars) Stand back! Stand back! For the love of God, he has a rotten brain! It's not rotten. It's a good brain! It's rotten, I tell you! Rotten! (roars) Ixnay on the ottenray. (Inga gasps) I'm not afraid! I know what he likes! (roars) ( violin tune) (Freddy) That music! (Frau Blcher) Yes! It's in your blood! It's in the blood of all Frankensteins! It reaches the soul when words are useless. Your grandfather used to play it to the creature he was making. Then it was you all the time! Yes! You played that music in the night. Yes! To get us into the laboratory. Yes! That was your cigar in the ashtray! Yes! And it was you who left my grandfather's book out for me to find! Yes! So that I would Yes! Then you and Victor were Yes! Yes! Say it! He was my boyfriend! (monster screams) You will never catch him now! He's free! Do you hear? Free! (roaring) Gone! Gone! We've got to find him, do you understand? We've got to find him before he kills someone! What have I done? Oh, God in heaven! What have I done?  Oh, I love my pretty little flower  Oh, I love my pretty little flower  Oh, I love my flower Mmmm That monster is loose Boards must be tight! There. Thank God you put Helga to bed. With all this monster business, I take no chances. I remember the last time. But, Papa! I told you that I was turning the Rostbraten, don't you remember? I asked you to put Helga to You Now throw a kiss and say bye-bye. Mm-mm. Oh, dear. Nothing left. What shall we throw in now? Maybe she was in the bathroom when you looked! But I didn't even look upstairs. I thought you did! You didn't look upstairs? Sit down. Sit down! (both) Ahhh! ( Schubert Ave Maria) A visitor is all I ask. A temporary companion to help me pass a few short hours in my lonely life. (roars) Thank you, Lord. Thank you! Mmmm! Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't speak. Don't say a word. Oh, my joy and my prize from heaven. Oh, you must have been the tallest one in your class! My name is Harold and I live here all alone. What is your name? Mmmm! I didn't get that. Mmmm! Mmm! No Oh, forgive me. I didn't realise you were a mute. You see how heaven plans. Me, a poor blind man, and you, you a mute. An incredibly big mute. Ahh! But your hand is frozen, my child. How does a nice bowl of soup sound, huh? Mmmm! Well I know what it means to to be cold and hungry. Yes And how much it means to have a little kindness from a stranger. Are you ready for your soup? Mmmmm! Hold out your bowl, then. Oh, my friend, my friend You don't know what your visit means to me. How long I've waited for the pleasure of another human being. Sometimes in our preoccupation with worldly matters (whimpers) we tend to forget the simple pleasures (screams)  that are the basis for true happiness. Yes, yes, yes. Oh And now a little wine with your soup? Mmm. Good, good. Huh? Good Yes Wait! A toast! A toast to Yes! Long friendship! How hungry you must have been. Mmm. Now now, now for a little surprise.

Where are you going? I was gonna make espresso. (monster roars) ( violin tune) Now! (roaring) Quick! Give him the sedative! He's out! I know. I'm going in there. Bring me that candle. (Igor and Inga) No! Yes! Love is the only thing that can save this poor creature. And I am going to convince him that he is loved even at the cost of my own life. No matter what you hear in there, no matter how cruelly I beg you no matter how terribly I may scream do not open this door, or you will undo everything I've worked for. Do you understand? Do not open this door! Yes, Doctor. Nice working with you. (monster groans) (roars) Let me out. Let me out of here! Get me the hell out of here! What's the matter with you people? I was joking! Don't you know a joke when you hear one? Ha-ha-ha-ha! Jesus Christ! Get me outta here! Open this goddamn door or I'll kick your rotten heads in! Mommy! Nein! (yells) (muttering) Obviously Hello, handsome! You're a good-looking fellow, you know? People laugh at you. People hate you, but why do they hate you? Because they are jealous! (growls) Look at that boyish face. Look at that sweet smile. Do you wanna talk about physical strength? Do you want to talk about sheer muscle? Do you want to talk about the Olympian ideal? You are a God! And listen to me You are not evil. You are good! (sobs) Oh This is a nice boy. This is a good boy. This is a mother's angel. And I want the world to know once and for all and without any shame that we love him! (sobs) Oh I'm going to teach you. I'm gonna show you how to walk, how to speak, how to move, how to think! Together you and I are going to make the greatest single contribution to science since the creation of fire! Dr Fronkonsteen! Are you all right? My name is Frankenstein! Distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight it is my great privilege of introducing to you a man whose family name was once both famous and infamous! And now may I present to you Doktor Baron Friedrich von Frankenstein! (MC claps) My fellow scienti (hissing) tists and neurosurgeons, ladies and gentlemen. A few short weeks ago, coming from a background believe me, as conservative and traditionally grounded in scientific fact as any of you I began an experiment in, incredulous as it may sound the reanimation of dead tissue. (laughter) What I have to offer you might possibly be the gateway to immortality. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present for your intellectual and philosophical pleasure the Creature! (screaming) Remain in your seats, I beg you. We are not children here. We are scientists. I assure you there is nothing to fear. First may I offer for your consideration a neurological demonstration of the primary cerebellar functions. Balance and coordination! Walk heel to toe. (applause) Backwards! Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen the Creature perform simple motor activity but for what you will see next we must enter quietly into the realm of genius. Ladies and gentlemen mesdames et messieurs Damen und Herren from what was once an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues may I now present a cultured, sophisticated man about town! Hit it! If you're blue and you don't know where to go to  Why don't you go where fashion sits  Puttin'on the Ritz Different types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes  Or cutaway coat, perfect fits  Puttin'on the Ritz  Dressed up like a million-dollar trouper  Tryin'mighty hard to look like Gary Cooper  Ooper-dooper Come, let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks  Or umbrellas in their mitts  Puttin'on the Ritz (applause) (screams) Nothing! Nothing, I tell you! Five, six, seven, eight Come on! Are you trying to make me look like a fool? (booing) Please! I beg you! For safety's sake, don't humiliate him! Come back! Do you hear me? I will not let you destroy my work! As your creator I command you to come back! (screaming) (shouting) Chained. Chained like a beast in a cage. Oh, Doctor I feel so terrible. There's only one answer. If I could find a way to equalise the imbalance in his cerebral-spinal fluid why, he'd be as right as rain. But how? How, before it's too late? Oh, Frederick If only there was some way I could relieve this torture you are going through. (Freddy) Mm mm mm mm If there was some way I could help to Mm mm mm relieve the tension. If there was just some way I could give you a little peace. Doctor, I have Doctor? (Freddy) What is it? Doctor Where are you? I'm sorry, Doctor. This cable came while you were gone. I thought I told you never to interrupt me while I'm working! I'm sorry, Doctor. I thought this was an emergency. You see, your fiance will be arriving any second! What Elizabeth here tonight? Yes. I will go prepare a room at once. I suggest you put on a tie! Darling. Darling! Surprised? Surprised. Love me? Love you? Well Let's turn in. Darling! It's been a long day. I'm sure you're very tired.

I am a bit tired after all. I'd like you to meet my assistants, Inga and I-gor. How do you do? How do you do? Uh This is my financier Elizabeth. I'm so happy to meet you at last. Uh Finance. Excuse me, darling. What is it exactly that you do do? Uh, well, I assist Dr Fronkonsteen in the laboratory. We have intellectual discussions und we As a matter of fact, we were just having one May I? What? Wait a minute, wait a minute Uh I-gor, would you give me a hand with the bags? Certainly, you take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban. Oh (growls) Stop that! I'm talking about the luggage. Yes, master. Ladies, this way. It'll be a long night. If you need any help with the girls (mutters) Get in there! Ah (man laughs) You settle down now. Cos we gonna be pals. Right? (snarls) Nice and cosy. Just like old friends.

Is your room just down the hall in case I get the frights during the night? Well, yes, but I thought perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might stay here with you. Would you want me like this now? So soon before our wedding, so near we can almost touch it? Yes! Whoa, boy! Or or to wait just a little while longer when I can give myself to you without hesitation when I can be totally and unashamedly and legally yours? That's a tough choice. You're a tough guy. (kisses) I suppose you're right. Of course I am. I always am. Now give me a kiss and say good night. No tongues. Good night, darling. (mutters) Good night, sweetheart. (mutters) I love you.

What is it? What's the matter? Is it that music? It's probably from some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about. Where are you going? Where You men are all alike! Seven or eight quick ones and you're off with the boys. To boast and brag! You better keep your mouth shut! Oh, I think I love him Ohh! ( violin tune) (Inga) Oh! Oh, look! He's coming back! Oh, look!

You realise you're risking both your lives? Yes. (clanking) Switching off! How how will I know when they are done? The doctor said to allow 15 minutes. Not one second more or less. (shouting) How long now? Two more minutes. Eins, zwei, drei, jetzt! Eins, zwei, drei, jetzt! Eins, zwei, drei, jetzt! What's that noise? I don't know. What time is it? Almost time. Oh, my God!

Undjust who do you think you are that you order these people about? I am the monster! Ja. I see that you are the monster. For as long as I can remember people have hated me. They looked at my face and my body and they ran away in horror. In my Ioneliness, I decided that if I could not inspire love, which was my deepest hope I would instead cause fear! (villagers gasp) I live because this poor, half-crazed genius has given me life. He alone held an image of me as something beautiful. And then when it would have been easy enough to stay out of danger he used his own body as a guinea pig to give me a calmer brain and a somewhat more sophisticated way of expressing myself. Well, this is, of course, an entirely different situation. As the leader of this community may I be the first to offer you my hand in friendship. (sobs) Thank you. You are entirely welcome. Und now let us all go to my house for a little sponge cake und a little wine  und Shit! To the lumberyard! (Freddy sings Here Comes The Bride) Hello, Mrs Frankenstein. Mrs Frankenstein!

Honey, I hope you didn't find Daddy's little party too boring. I mean, he did it just for you and he meant so well. Say you liked it. Mm-hm. Honey, did you see? I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts and the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies. Here I come! (hisses like a cat) (snorts) (imitates cymbal) (singing) (sizzling) Mmm. Ohhh Mmmm! (Inga) Mmmm! The feeling is mutual. You know, it's a puzzlement. There's something I've always wanted to ask you about that operation. You know in the transference part The monster got part of your wonderful brain, but what did you ever get from him? Mmmmmmm! (Inga) No! Ohh! I don't believe Ooh! Ow! Oh! Oh!  Ah! Sweet mystery of life  At last I found you (Igor continues playing song) Subtitles by Visiontext ENGLISH HOH, - Yes, sir.

Okay, thanks. - And this is... - Your lavatory and sink, sir. - Nice, big room. - Very convenient. - What's this partition? - Oh, that turns the room into a double suite.. We used to have a lot of calls for 'em... from the honeymooners. I'm sorry. I'm not doing it on purpose. This latch seems to be stuck. Everything's changed. Did you say something? No! No. I-I agree with everything you said. All I wanna do is take it easy. Good, good. Then just settle back and enjoy the trip. Because it ain't gonna be too exciting, now, but we'll get you there on time. - Okay. Have a nice rest. - Thanks a lot. - Bye-bye. - Good evening. Board! So long, L.A.! Bye! Do you like this perfume?

Right in here's a town called Ashland, Missouri. Cross the big Mississippi. Two and a half days, right up there in Chicago, Illinois. - That's some trip, huh? - Mm-hmm. - You from Chicago? - No, Los Angeles. I'm from Chicago. My name is Bob Sweet.

Here. There's a sample for ya. Vitamin ""E."" Now, that is great for the old pecker. Yeah, it really keeps the pencil sharp, and I'm not kiddin'. Have you had a chance yet to check out the action? No. Actually, this is the first time I've ever taken a train. - You're kidding me? - No. Come on - Well, you're in for the ride of your life. - Oh, yeah? You just pick out a little chickie, my friend... and it's hug and munch all the way to Chicago. - Really? - I do it all the time. I tell my boss that I'm afraid of flying... and I get this action twice a year. It's a cathouse on wheels. No... Hey, listen. Come on. It's something about the movement of the train that does it. All that motion makes a girl horny. Well, I'll tell you, Bob. I'm not really interested in a shipboard romance. - I took the train to rest and get a lot of reading done. - Hold it, hold it. Right there, George. I believe I see my chickie for tonight. Hi, there. Can I, uh, buy you a drink? - I have one. Thank you. - Well, I'll just, uh, join you then, huh? That's an old-fashioned, bartender. - You go all the way? - What? I said, do you go all the way... to Chicago? Oh. Yes, I do. - Well, then maybe we can do it together. - Do what? - Go to Chicago. I mean, you know, we're gonna be, uh... stuck on this train together, and we can't jump off. Do you feel that motion? Are you hot? What? I said, are you hot? Lady, I am always hot. Maybe I can cool you down. How's the latch? May I? Yes. Please, sit down. What a nice surprise. I said, how's the latch? We have connecting rooms. The latch. Good. It's good. It's fine. Thank you. It's a little bit rusty, but nothing serious. I'll get the porter to look at it. There's no rush, is there? Would you folks like a cocktail? Uh, a martini on the rocks with a twist. - Two. - Yes, sir. - My name is George Caldwell. - Hilly Burns. That's short for Hildegard. What's that pencil for? Oh, you have to fill out your own menu card. ""One macedoine of fruit, beef Oriental, rice, carrots... coffee, apple pie a la mode. "" You print very well. Thanks. I'll have the same thing. You do it for me. I can't even read my own writing. I don't do shorthand, and I can't type. What do you do for a living? I'm a secretary. - Well, how do you keep your job? - I give great phone. I have a terrific personality. - You going to Chicago? - Yes. I'm going to my sister's wedding. How come you're taking the train? You afraid of flying? No, I'm not afraid of flying. I, uh... I just want to be bored. And you? Oh, my new boss likes the old-fashioned ways. He's just written a book on Rembrandt... and he's gonna kick off his publicity campaign with a lecture at the Art Institute. Oh, yes? I'm in publishing. What's his name? Professor Arthur Schreiner. Have you heard of him? Most people haven't. He's, um... He's been a recluse working on this book for about  20  years. - Where is he now? - Oh, he's in bed... with a glass of hot milk and molasses. He's a health nut. - What do you publish? - Oh, mostly nonfiction. Gardening, cook books, how-to-do-it books. Like sex manuals? - I've edited a few. - An authority, huh? I know what goes where... and why. - That's very interesting. Are you married? - Divorced. How come? My friends all told me that my wife was too good for me... and after a couple of years I decided they were right. Sounds sad. You say that your boss is in art history. Is that what you're interested in? Not really. just got this job because I was available. I was willing to travel. - Would you like some wine with this meal? - Oh, what a question. Um, we'll have a bottle of the Mouton Cadet. Very good, sir. - You do that very well. - I give great French. - He'll never talk. - We gotta find those papers. Come on. We'll look in his compartment. So that was your introduction to high society? Look, he was very good to me. He taught me everything from the pill to Picasso. - What was missing? - A marriage license. Is that what you want? I did then. Right now, I'd like some more champagne. - Uh-oh. Shall I get another bottle? - Two. This place seems to be closing down. Why don't we take our glasses... and go to our rooms? We could even open the connecting door. We could even break down the whole partition. - I'll speak to the porter. - I'll get the champagne. You were right. It's that motion. I didn't understand it, but you were right. Good night. - Rapist! - No, no, no, no! Pardonez-moi, por favor. Excuse me. Um, this won't take a minute. Good. Excellent. These are all right. Sorry. Good evening. Come in. This is very nice. - Would you like some champagne? - Yes. I can't get over the size of this room without the partition. They are small rooms by themselves. They're perfect forjuggling. - For what? - For juggling. When you practice, the balls would always bounce off the walls. Do you juggle a lot? I know what goes where and why. I like that song. If I ever hear it again... it'll be difficult not to think of you. - You put that very nicely. - Thanks. To traveling by train. Trains that pass in the night. You like my new shoes? - Yes, I do. - Why don't you take them off? You can put them in that little locker over there... and the porter will have them shined for you in the morning. - Really? - That's terrific. - Is that the master's work? - Mm-hmm. He gave me this copy for safe keeping. Do you want to read it? Slide over. It's beautiful, isn't it? Very. Do you really edit sex manuals? I really, really do. But I have a confession to make. I'm much better at books on gardening. - Really? - That's my specialty. Well... is there anything that you might wanna pass on? - You mean about gardening? - Yes. Some helpful hints for the beginner. Well... One tip is... always be nasty to nasturtiums. - Is that so? - They love that. - They like it rough? - The rougher, the better. Great. What else should I know? I could teach you the secret of how to treat azaleas. Oh, tell me. I'm all ears. I can see that. Well... just treat them the same way as you would a begonia. - No kidding? - That's gospel. You mean what you're saying is what's good for azaleas is good for begonias? - You got it. - George, this is fascinating. I thought you'd be interested. I'd like to delve deeper. - Be my guest. - Thank you. What would happen if you treated an azalea like a nasturtium? Now, this is the really interesting part. - What is it, George? - Did you see it? Did you see that man? - What man? - There was a man hanging outside this window. - He was shot in the head. - What? Hilly, a dead man fell off the roof. I saw it. His coat was stuck. Oh. I should do something. I should report it. Maybe they could stop the train. George, I'm sure you saw something. You probably saw a kid's kite or an old newspaper out... Look! Like that. You see, George, it could have been anything out there. But his eyes were so clear. I think they were clearer than your head. - You imagined this, George. - I didn't. I know I didn't. Then why don't you call the conductor and tell him your story? - I feel dizzy. - You know what? Here. Lie down here, George. Whew! If this is what the D.T. S are like... I'm gonna give up the bottle for life. The mind plays funny tricks on you all the time. You know that, George. Come on. Relax. It's okay. Relax That sure is a pretty song. Yes, it is. You're very beautiful, Hilly. I like you too, George. Hilly, wake up. Hi, George. Hilly, the man that I saw outside the window last night... this is him. - That's my boss. That's Professor Schreiner. - I know it. That's what I'm talking about. - What time is it, George? - It's just after 8:00. 8:00? Oh, no. Wake me up again when it's after 10:00. Hilly, this man has been murdered. - Well... Why don't you go down the hall and discuss it with him? And then come back here and discuss it with me. He's just right past the diner, room ""C."" Hilly, I didn't imagine it. Good night, George. You're a wonderful gardener. - Rapist. - Oh! Hey, George, you devil. Come on. Join me for coffee. All right. I'll be right back. I just have to check on something. What is that? Yeah? What do you want? I'd like to see Professor Schreiner, please. - Yeah? Who are you? - My name is George Caldwell. You a friend of the professor? No, not exactly. I'm a friend of his secretary's. We were a little worried about him. Yeah? What are you worried about? Can't I talk to the professor? What are you doing in there? I think you're sticking your nose in where it don't belong. You and that broad are gonna get yourself in trouble. In fact, she's already in trouble - You're the one who's in trouble, mister, not me. - Reace! Get rid of this bum. What are you doing? Who is that? Hey! Listen, you big lummox, let me go! What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? What the hell's the matter with you? All right, listen, buster, you're in trouble... and I mean big trouble, because I'm reporting you. Oh, no, you can't be serious. Wait a minute. All right. Enough's enough. If you're willing to forget it... I don't believe this! Are you kidding? Goddamn it! Son of a bitch! This is terrific! - If that's you, Pepe, you're in one heap of trouble. - No, it's not Pepe. - Where's Pepe? - I don't know. My name is George... Goddamn it, I knew it! He's gone off again with that no accountin' Manuel. - My name is George Caldwell. - Those two get together, smoke a little weed. Next thing you know, they're off buzzing the turkeys in the pickup. - Excuse me, dear. - I should've fired him 30 years ago. Excuse me. Do you think I could use your telephone? - Telephone? - Yes. - You ain't from around here, are you? - No, I'm lost. I'm not lost, but I was thrown off of the Silver Streak. Thrown off? That a fact? Tell me, is there a woman in this? - Well, there's a girl, but... - I knew it. No, no, no. It's nothing to do with what you're thinking. Actually, she's in a great deal of danger. That's why I have to use your telephone... so I can call the police and have those people who threw me off the train arrested. - Well, it sounds like you're in an awful hurry. - I am. That's what I'm trying to tell you. That suits me just fine... 'cause I'm running a little bit late myself. - Tell you what, Steve. - George. George Caldwell. - Rita Babtree. - How do you do? If you'll finish milking old Harriet over there... I'll go in and change and you can ride into town with me. - Oh, great! - The sheriff's a good friend of mine. Wonderful. Just tell me what I have to do. Well, you just take this bucket and milk her. Milk her? I've never milked a cow before. Cut the gas, Steve. You're a grown man. I'm sure you've had some similar experience. Look, you just sit down... take a tit in each hand and let nature take its course. All right. These cows are so full... it's like tapping a trip valve on Niagara Falls. - I'll go in and change and meet you outside in 10 minutes. - All right. I'll do my best. Hello. Let's see. Just be nice. Be nice. Wait a minute. Something's wrong. You've got four of them. Oop.! Come on, Harriet. Come on. Give me a break. Nice, fresh milk. Here it comes. Nothing's coming out though. Here we go. All right, now, I know I'm a slow starter, but where's Niagara Falls? Hey, Steve, whatcha doin'? I was just looking at my schedule for the Silver Streak. No, I don't mean that. I mean... why are you sittin' in that car? We ain't goin' in that. - We aren't? - No! Come on, Steve. Follow me. Put these packages in the front seat... and I'll get the wheel blocks. I sure hope Pepe filled it with enough gas. We're not going in that, are we? What's the matter? You afraid of flyin'? No, no. I'm not afraid. Great, 'cause it ain't no fun soarin' with a turkey. Look out for the windmill. Look out for the windmill! - You okay with those packages? - Yeah, I guess so. Well, it won't be long. We should be in Stavely by 2:00. 2:00? That's two and a half hours from now. Where's Stavely? Sixty miles the other side of Albuquerque. - Wait a minute. - What'd you say? The Silver Streak stops there at 2:27. If we got there by 2:00 the sheriff could meet the train when it arrives. Yeah, I suppose so. - This is fabulous! - Ain't it the truth? They talk of the joy of sex, but it don't last like the fun of flyin'. Look! There's the Silver Streak.! - I think we're going to make it. - Look at those sheep down there. Don't they make a lovely sight? I'm just itchin'to buzz 'em. To do what? - You never buzzed sheep? - I don't think so. Hold on, Steve! We're going in! Look at those little critters run.! Come on.! Let's buzz 'em again.! Whoo-hoo.! Here we are. - Hello, Rita. - Hi, Burt. Is the sheriff in? - He's over at Clancey's Dairy. He'll be back in about... Look! There's the Silver Streak.! - Thank you. Thank you, Rita. - Don't you wanna go get the sheriff? - No time! Thank you, dear. Good-bye.! - So long, Steve. This time, try to stay on! Come on! Come on! Jump up! Jump! You got it! All right! Hey, welcome aboard. - Don't you just love train travel? - I love it. - Loves it. I asked you to join me for breakfast. This is lunch. Sorry. I lost track of time. Well, what were you doin' back there? Gettin' a little ass? No, I was squeezing tits. You are a sexy devil, aren't you? Kind of worked up a sweat too, didn't ya, you horny bastard? Well, what do you expect? I mean, she's a hot little number. And he's very heavy competition. You know him? Doesn't everybody know him? That's Roger Devereau. He's Chicago's own jet-setter. I mean, you know, he's a big cheese on the Art Institute, something like that. Like I say, very heavy competition. Are you gonna take him on? Are you all right? What's the matter? - Honey, what's the matter? - What's the matter? Who left who? Last time I saw you, you were gonna go visit the professor. - Hilly, the professor is dead. I'm sure of it. Listen to me. I went to his room this morning, and he wasn't there. Two dumb thugs were looking through his things. They pushed me out of his room and threw me off the train. -Threw you off? -The point is they were searching for something. I don't know what, but they've killed the professor for it and now I'm positive they're gonna go after you We've gotta get off the train and contact the police. - No, George, you've got it all mixed up. - I don't have it mixed up. I'm just worried about you. Hello, Roger. This is my friend George Caldwell. Roger Devereau. - How do you do? - George has just been telling me how he'd been thrown off the train. Oh, you're the one? I'm so pleased to see you. Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. - Oh, that's good news. As soon as I was told, I contacted the police in Albuquerque... and told them to spare no expense to make sure you were safe. Reace... he's like a child... got off the train and tried to find you... say he was sorry. - How did you get back on? - Who's Reace? He's the one that threw you off. You must remember him... a large man with not very attractive dental work. I do remember, but what does he got to do with you? He works for me. He's my chauffeur. Not very bright, but extremely loyal. And naturally, I assume total responsibility for all his actions... and will pay for any damages. And what about that other fellow? I met another man this morning. Does he work for you too? Oh, yes, of course. You don't know the entire story, do you? Early this morning, I was having breakfast with Professor Schreiner... and he wanted to show me some important papers connected with his book. But, unfortunately, they were missing So we searched his compartment twice... and eventually we discovered them in his trunk in the baggage room. t was something of an upset, but if you know the professor.... you'll know he's slightly absent-minded. Mr. Devereau, I'm very confused. I don't understand how you could've had breakfast with Professor Schreiner. George thinks the professor's been murdered. - Murdered? - That's right, last night. That's extraordinary. Why should you think that? Because I saw him fall off the roof of this train just outside this window. - He was shot in the head. - You were in this compartment? I was lying right here. Hilly, you'll have to go back to my compartment, straighten it out. That man Whiney doesn't know what he's doing. Devereau. Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduce Professor Schreiner. Professor Schreiner, Mr. Caldwell. - Hello. - How do you do? What did you do to your jacket? Mr. Caldwell is the man that Reace inadvertently threw off the train. Oh, yes. That stupid person. I do hope you weren't hurt. No, no. I'm all right. I suppose I'm to blame for this morning's fracas. After all, none of this would've happened if I hadn't misplaced the Rembrandt letters. The what? It doesn't matter. I'm so glad that you're all right and managed to get back on the train. Oh, Professor? Professor, I put back as much... I put back... Hey, how'd you get here? Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduce an associate of mine, Mr. Whiney. If an apology is due, I'm sure that he'd be prepared to make it. It's a pity that Reace is not here to do the same. Reace, that moron. It was all his fault. I was looking for the papers. I never touched you, did I? - No, no. - See? It's been very hectic for me. I think I'll have a scotch and lie down. - Why don't you use my compartment? - Thank you. I will. Hilly... will you help him with that mess? Mr. Caldwell, it's been nice meeting you. I hope the rest of the trip for both of us is a little less exhilarating. Let's hope so. Well, I think I've made a silly fool of myself this morning. - No, no, not at all. - No, no, I did. I was just sticking my nose into a lot of stuff that's none of my business.. and coming up with some crazy ideas. You were right. I guess I was imagining a lot of things last night. Probably the champagne. - Well - Let me clean your jacket.. Oh, that's all right. I have another one. We get to Chicago tomorrow and I did come on this trip to do some work. So I'll say good-bye. - Couldn't you possibly join us for dinner? - Oh, yes, do. Thanks. No. I think I'll just eat in my room. This latch... seems to be stuck. I'll get the porter to fix it right away. What are you up to there, lover boy? Hello, Bob Sweet. - Hello, Bobby. - How are ya? I'm all right. Better yet, uh, what are you? A miniature alcoholic? Did you know that the Blanard Tunnel... was the highest point on this line? Yeah, I knew that. Did you know that when we reach it, I intend to be higher? - Just don't fall off, huh? Okay? - Oh, no. I've left this train once already. That's enough. You have? What do you mean? Last night... just as I was about to... kiss my beautiful blonde... I saw her boss hanging outside the window. Wait. You saw her boss, Professor Schreiner, huh? That's him. That's the fellow. He was shot in the head. I knew that I had been drinking... so I went to see the professor this morning... and I found this little weasel of a guy in his room. - Edgar Whiney. - That's him. - How did you know that? - Oh, I-I know. I just know. Go on, go on. Well, then this huge mountain... with a gold mine stuck in his gums... picked me up and threw me off the train. - What... But you never saw the professor, huh? - No, I saw him. - I saw him this afternoon. - Where? In Hilly's compartment. See, the man I saw last night was a hallucination. - What did he look like? - Who? The professor, you know, that you saw this afternoon. Like his picture. - Did he say anything to you? - Why are you asking me all these questions? - Did he say anything... - Nothing, nothing. He was tired and wanted to have a scotch. You don't have any ice in your drink. - That's it! Scotch! Listen. See, you didn't have a hallucination. The professor's been murdered. The guy you saw this afternoon was a fake. Oh, no. Yeah. Listen, I talked to the real professor last night. I mean it. He didn't wanna have anything to do with Mr. Devereau. Besides that, he's a health nut. Doesn't touch alcohol. Oh, Bobby, just because you're a vitamin salesman? My name is Stevens. I'm a federal agent. We've been working on this case for two and a half years. Well, what are you tailing the professor for? I am not tailing the professor, I'm tailing Devereau. Come on. Let's go. Wait a minute. What about Hilly? Don't worry about it. They're not gonna kill her till we get to Chicago. I don't even think they'll try to kill you till then. Come on. Devereau's men must've brought the professor back here... after 9:00 pm last night. - How do you figure that? - Because I left him at 9:00 pm. And because this is the easiest access to the roof. Somehow, he must've escaped. He got out to this ladder, then ran back down the train before they shot him. You're not going up there, are you? Yeah. The Blanard Tunnel is up ahead. Come on up and keep a lookout, will ya? All right, I'll try. What did you find? It was hooked on a protruding bolt. Then I was right. I did see him. I'll bet Devereau has already got the body picked up and placed in cold storage someplace. Too bad. He was a sweet old guy. Buy why did he have to kill the professor? He was going to be embarrassed by the findings in the professor's book. Two of the institute's Rembrandts... both bought and authenticated by Devereau... were going to be proved forgeries. The professor had the proof in his possession. I asked him last night, ""What was the proof?"" He told me I was going to have to wait for his lecture. And Devereau wasn't going to wait. I think the idea was to kidnap the professor... then kill him... and then substitute some phony look-alike... who would botch the lecture and discredit the book. - We've gotta find the proof. - But they have the proof. They have it. That's what Whiney and everyone was looking for this morning... the Rembrandt letters. They said that they found them in the professor's trunk. They're lying. That's the first place they would've looked... before they started turning his room upside down. No! No, the professor hid them someplace, somewhere simple... as a precaution when he found out Devereau was on the train. My God! I know where they are! Come on! Come on! The Rembrandt letters. Holy Toledo! I think you've found it. This is the genuine article, penned by the old boy himself, huh? ""Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn. "" Yeah. My guess is there's a fact there's some kind of a date in all this... that proves the charges the professor makes in his book. Push the button for the porter, will ya? I wanna get the conductor to radio ahead to the next town. You know, it's difficult to believe that a man was killed over those. This is the tip of an iceberg. You know that plane crash in Cologne, Germany last year? That was a Devereau special. A hundred people got killed in that one. It was just to cover up his involvement in the Metropolitan Gallery scandal. We knew he was responsible. We couldn't pin it on him. These letters are gonna blow his multimillion-dollar operation in art sky-high. That's why she was so distant. They must've had her in a corner. I want you to remember that your neck is on the line too. You already told him you saw the real professor shot. Yeah, I did. So what do I do now? You be responsible for Hilly. Get her off the train and to safety. - I'm gonna take care of Mr. Devereau. - Here comes the tunnel. We'll make our move when the train gets to Dodge City tonight. That's appropriate, huh? Gun smoke at the O.K. Corral. What happened? Bob, what happened? Put-Put 'em back. Go on, now. Do it. Get my gun. Take my gun. Take my gun. Go on. Get the girl off the train, okay? Go on.! You know, I got a funny feeling this bullet was meant for you. Shoot.! That man's dead.! - Holy moly, you shot him! - I didn't... No. - No! Wait a minute! - He's been shot! A man's been shot! I didn't shoot him! Hey. Hey, you're not... Hey! He's not dead! Hold it! Don't move, or I'll shoot! Son of a bitch! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Hello! Hello! Hello, please! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a... Come on, please! Stop! Thanks a lot, Eddie. That's it, boys.! Blow those babies'heads off! Excuse me. Just a minute. Geez, would you look at that! That boy is somethin', ain't he? Commercial. - Now, what can I do for you? - I want to report a murder. A murder. A man's been shot on the Silver Streak... and there's a girl who's in great danger. We have to stop the train. Now, wait a second. You say a man's been shot? - Yes. - Jumpin'Jiminy! We've never had a murder before. Sit down. Have a cup of coffee. Help yourself. Now, uh, let's get the facts. - What did you say your name was? - Caldwell. George Caldwell. I'm from Los Angeles. L.A. Okay. Who was shot? - Actually, there were two. - Two? Yes. The first was Bob Sweet. He was a federal undercover agent. - A fed? No shit? - Yes. And the second was a man by the name of Reace. I shot him. - You shot him? - Yes. He shot Sweet. - Because Sweet was a fed? - No, because he thought Sweet was me. - Reace shot Sweet, and you shot Reace? - Right. - With a spear gun. - W-With a what? You see, I took Sweet's gun, but I dropped it... so I had to use a spear gun. Uh, don't you... can't we call someone? Wait a second. You say you shot Reace with a spear? Yes. He was going to shoot me. - With a spear? No, with a bullet! He shot the professor. - Who shot the professor? - Reace. - Reace shot Sweet! - And the professor. Makes three. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. The professor was shot last night. - Uh, can't wejust do all of this later? - Was there anyone else? - Anyone else what? - Shot! No. No, but there will be soon if we don't stop the train. Please, just pick up the phone and call your superiors. Tell them I have the Rembrandt letters. - That's why the professor was shot. - Was he with the feds? - Who? - This guy Rembrandt. - Rembrandt is dead. - Dead? That makes four. Listen, feller, you sure you're not makin'this up as you go along? I'm an officer of the law and I got better things to do than listen to that funnin'. That's my hot line. Now, you take the time to get your facts straight. When I come back, I want your answers clear and to the point. Got that? And you can start with who shot Rembrandt. Hello. Yeah. This is Chauncey. No shit! Jumpin'Jiminy! He's sittin' right here in my office. That's right. Came in here spoutin'some bull about shootin' some people on the train, wanted to confess. I knew he was a loony right off. Oh, yeah. Don't you worry. I've handled loonies before. Gotcha. Sheriff, I'm sorry. I guess I was a little rattled before. - It must've sounded crazy to you. - Oh, that's perfectly all right, Mr. Caldwell. That is what you said your name was, didn't you? George Caldwell? Yeah. I really think that we oughta get on the phone to Washington. If they heard what I have to say, they would stop the train. Oh, yeah. Them boys in Washington, they're pretty smart. You ever watch 'em on TV? Bam, bam. Sheriff, listen to me! They know all about Sweet and Devereau. I figured that the Silver Streak should be in Kansas in an hour. We could stop the train at Scott City or maybe Dodge. All right, mister! Keep your hands where they are, and we'll have no trouble! - Give me that! - Don't shoot. ""Don't shoot""? You stupid, ignorant, son-of-a-bitch, dumb bastard! Jesus Christ! I've met some dumb bastards in my time, but you outdo them all! Get over there! What the hell do you think I'm doing? I come here to help a girl who may be killed at any minute... and you're playing cops and robbers! There ain't no way you're gonna get away with this! Get a... Pick up the phone! Pick it up! - We know who you are. - What are you talking about? That was the county sheriff. They're comin' to get you. You ain't got a chance. - Get me for what? - For killin' a vitamin salesman on the Silver Streak. He was no vitamin salesman. He was a federal agent. They should know that. If you'll just put down that gun and come along quietly. You're outnumbered. Ain't no way you're gonna escape. What is that? That's my deputy. - Get outside. - All right. - Get outside! - Don't shoot. - Don't shoot. - Don't shoot. - Keep your hands down. Keep your hands down. - Uncle Oliver, look what I got! - Keep your hands down. - Uncle Oliver, he's got your gun. Get your hands up! Get against the wall. Keep your hands up. - The whole county knows about you! - Get back! - Keep those hands up. - They ain't gonna rest till they hunt you down.! Keep your hands up. Keep 'em up. Uncle Oliver, he's takin' your car! You ain't ever gonna get away with this! - Uncle Oliver! Uncle Oliver, he's got your car. - Moose! One more word outta you, I'm gonna smash your mouth! J.J.! J.J.! I got... I got bad news for ya. Caldwell's escaped. Yeah, look, let's not go into that now. He's headed down 350... and we can stop him before he crosses the state line. Right. Dumb, stupid bastard. Shit! - Who are you? - I'm a thief, man. Take it easy. I ain't gonna freak you out no more. How about handin' me them keys. I'd like to get these cuffs off. Sorry. That's real nice the way you handled yourself back there with old Oliver. I was listenin' - What they want you for anyway, man? - Murder. Drop me off anywhere along in here, okay? I don't mess with the big ""M."" I'm not stopping anywhere. Do you know the roads around here? Maybe we could make a deal. I'm not a murderer. I'm trying to prevent one. But in about a minute, we're gonna be surrounded by cops. If you can get us out of it, you'd be doing both of us a favor. What do you think? I think you better make a right up here and then a sharp left. I'm comin' over. Jesus Christ, man! That's how you murdered your victims? Put 'em in a car and bounced 'em to death? - Sorry. - Sorry, my ass! You're dangerous. Proves one thing, though. You don't do this for no livin'.. - No, I don't. - All right. Just take it easy. I'm gonna take over in a minute.. Don't make no more sudden moves, okay? I'm gonna check with headquarters and find out the game plan for tonight. He said he was gonna get back on that train. He has to cross into Kansas on 120 or... on 116 or 350. Now, I figure if we put stakeouts on all of those roads, we'll get that feller. The first should be at the junction of Taubman's Road, on 116. - What are you slowing down for? - There's a truck up ahead. So there's a truck up ahead. We the man.! Let's turn on the siren... get them hippies off the road! Put some foot into it.! Move it.! Oh, God! Would you like to drive for a while? Car 36 report your position. Do you read me? Car 36. Chauncey,... we're moving in for the roadblock at the intersection of Taubman's Road and 116. That's fine, fellas. Car 45 is already there. We're going in for a double block on all points. The old double roadblock, huh? That's all I wanted to know, Oliver. Fasten yourself in, partner. You ain't got nothin' to worry about. I got the nerve and I got the touch. Better pull it tighter. Real tight. I used to do this all the time back home in Texas. - Do what? - Demolition derby. I hear somethin' comin', but I can't see anything yet. That's fine, boys. We got 'em boxed in now. - Aren't you gonna slow down? - Slow down? Open your eyes, man, 'cause I'm gonna make a criminal out of you yet. Goddamn it! Fellas, watch out! Hello, car 36! What the hell happened to you guys? Hey, Chauncey! This is Grover T. Muldoon! You wanna know what happened? We just whooped your ass! We whooped your ass! ""I don't know. I met him last night."" I've never seen him before. That's what you told us this morning, and I'm finding it... increasingly hard to believe. - Well, it's the truth. - Is it? No matter, when the time comes, we'll take care of Mr. Caldwell. Meanwhile, we're going to take... extremely good care of you. - What are you doing? - I'm following the plan. Just changed my mind. Are you crazy? I thought we were gonna take the Chevy in back. Chevy? That's a jerk-off, man! This here is pure pussy. Pure pussy? I'll tell that to the judge. Don't worry about no judge. This here's gonna get us to Kansas City on time. Well, how about jail? Did you know the office was right in front of us? Go check the guard, okay? This ain't gonna take but a second. Hold it right there, nigger. Hey! How you doin', old dude? What's happenin'? Step away from the car. was listenin' to the engine. Sounds real good, man. - Does it come with whitewalls? Just move. Okay, I'm gonna move now. You just take it easy. I said move! A pussy, huh? A pussy! Can we go now? I thought you was an amateur. You're a real pro. A real pro. Man, that was beautiful. Ain't nobody gonna mess with you. - Oh, yeah. - I mean it. You're a pretty bad old dude. All I wanna do is get to Kansas City by the morning. Don't worry about that. With this honey, we're gonna be in Kansas City. You just get some sleep, 'cause we're on our way to Kansas City! You thinking about her? Yeah. Crazy thing is I just met her two nights ago. That's the way love is. I always lose my memory when I fall in love. Like you said, you know, we just get on the train, get her off... tell the police, let them handle the rest of that stuff. Yeah. Yeah, but what? I only hope she's still alive. Arriving passenger Hall... please report to the information desk in the north concourse. Great! We've got 10 minutes! I'll get the tickets. Just wait right here! - You go get the tickets, and it's good-bye, George. - What are you talking about? That! That's my driver's license picture. I hate that picture. Yeah? Why don't you just shuffle right over there and tell them about it. - Are they the police? - No, they're from Travelers Aid. - How are we gonna get on the train? - That's a good question. - I've still got the gun. I could start a diversion. - Yeah, blow your brains out. Wait. I got an idea. You come with me - How much you want for that radio? - Thirty dollars. - We'll take it. Pay the man. - What? Pay the man. - That's a bad hat you got on.  I'll give you five dollars for it. - It's yours. - Thank you. Pay the man. - What? Pay the man! And another five for the shoe polish. - What do we want with shoe polish? - Don't argue. Pay the man. - One, two, three, four. Forty dollars. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - See anything else you want, just make me an offer. - No, thank you. - Uh, how about a brush? - Nothing! Can't win 'em all. That is the stupidest idea I have ever heard. You wanna save that girl's life? Then it's this or we're dead. Now take off your jacket. Come on! - I can't pass for black! - Who're you tellin'? I didn't say I was gonna make you black., I said I was gonna get you on the train. We got to make them cops think you're black. - It'll never work. Never. - What, are you afraid it won't come off? That's a good joke. That's humorous. Like that, huh? May I speak? This is crazy! It'll never work! Don't you understand? Are you kiddin'? Look at that. AI Jolson made a million bucks lookin' like that. Now here, you try. Don't worry about your eyes, 'cause you're gonna be wearin' these. There you go. That looks good. Get on top of your head. Put on my jacket. Then we'll slap this beanie on your head. There you go. All right, ace or deuce? That's bad, man! You're lookin' good! Now here, take this radio. When you step out of here, step out like King Shit. You bad! Put that radio to your ear. That's gonna help cover your face. Just move with the rhythm of the music. Move your body with the rhythm of the music. That's all you gotta remember, okay? Let me see you try it. Step to the music. Step to the music. Yeah. Step to the music... Stop. How come you whiteys got such a tight ass, man? How are you gonna walk outta here with a tan face and that white walk? Just get into the music. Come on, George. Loosen up. Listen to the beat. Let your feet move. Now, do it! Can't you feel it? The tempo's right here. Right in there. That's all you gotta do. Yeah, now try it! Don't you feel it? Yeah. Needs work, George. Needs a lot of work. You know that? Will you practice? Man, you gotta practice, but let it be loose! Listen to the music. Follow the beat. Hear? - Feel it comin' up? Feel it? - I got it. It's comin'? Yeah, that's it. I'm gonna get the tickets. Okay? I'll be back. Work on it. God, honkies! Come on, man, get some jive goin'. Be cool. Shake it, but don't break it. That's it. Hey, man, how do I look? You look sharp, mister. I feel sharp! You hear? I feel like the sun around midnight. You dig? Outta sight! Get down! Get down! Feelin' good! Feelin' fine! Feelin' real fine! That's it. Just loosen up those hips, sugar. All you whiteys got a tight ass. Yeah, get that ass movin'. Outta sight! I'm a macaroni! Get down! I'm the king! Number one, baby.! - Um, um, I'm not.... - Hey, you must be in pretty big trouble, fella. But for God's sake, learn to keep time. Shit, that's my man! That's my man! - I don't think we'll make it past the cops. - We'll make it past the cops. I just hope we don't see no Muslims. - Who you lookin' for? - White guy. Well, if I see any, I'll let you know. Your attention, please. The AMRoad train, the Silver Streak... departing for Chicago is now loading on track three. - This the Chicago train? - First class. Yes, sir. There will be no visitors permitted beyond the gates. Board! - She's gone. - Sure that's her compartment? Yes, of course. Hey, wait a minute. Where are my clothes? All my clothes are gone - You sure this is your compartment? - Of course I'm sure. The police must have taken everything when they found Sweet's body. We've gotta see if Hilly's still on the train. How are we gonna do that and you can't leave this compartment? Go down to the phony professor's room. It's four cars back, room ""C."" Ask him what happened to his secretary. Give me the gun. Now give me your wallet. - What the... - I gotta get a disguise... a porter's uniform. You know, these disguises are getting expensive. Crime costs. Where's it at? Four cars back, room ""C."" Stay out of trouble. - Hilly, are you all right? - George, watch it.! Don't come in here. Are you all right? That's what I was gonna ask you. I'm sorry about your head. I never would have gone back to the compartment if I thought that you were gonna... - The Rembrandt letters. - Devereau's got them. He found them in your jacket. - I guess I blew it. - Poor George. I tried not to get you involved,... but they came to me yesterday and they told me that they'd killed the professor... and that unless I cooperated, they'd kill me too. I thought that... I'd go along with them and that then you'd get away. I was really happy when you did, but I was afraid I'd never see you again. George, I was so frightened. So was I. I was scared you wouldn't be here. I missed you, Hilly. You did? I missed you too. You've got shoe polish behind your ear. I'll explain that to you later. - Where are we? - Just passing the Illinois River Canal. Well, how are you? I hope I didn't slug you too hard. - Where's Devereau? - Isn't that perfect? You want to see him, and he wants to see you. Ladies first, hmm? Come in. Uh, please sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Miss Burns, how are you? Bring us some fresh coffee, toast and marmalade for our guests, would you? - Yes, sir. - Right away. I'vejust been looking over this correspondence you brought me... And... uh, it's fascinating. The professor was right. It's a remarkable find. I'm almost tempted to destroy it... but then on the other hand, I've always had a soft spot for things of beauty. Particularly when they were genuine. Whiney, would you put these in my safe, please? I don't think they propose... any further threat. Do you? I hope you're not too disappointed if this doesn't work. Oh, but on the contrary, I think it will. This has been a very difficult project, and I have made an error or two. One of them was bringing that man Reace out here. What happened to him? I shot him. Good for you. He probably deserved it. You did have him kill the professor, didn't you? Oh, no. Oh, no. On the contrary. He did that on his own. An unfortunate mistake. I knew we couldn't kill the professor until we had the Rembrandt letters. So I had to set up a scenario whereby the, uh, professor was kidnapped... and an imposter impersonated him in order to discredit him. We would have killed him anyway, but his escape attempt the other night... upset the entire scheme. Come in. Excuse me, sir. It's all confirmed. - The car will be waiting at Rockdale. - Good. Oh, Mr. Caldwell, you do rememberJohnson? He played the part of the professor... and would have done the same thing at Chicago, had it been necessary. How long before we arrive at Rockdale? - About an hour and a half, sir. - Thank you, Johnson. Now all that remains is to clear up a couple of points. Meaning the two of you. So I've arranged a new scenario... wherein you are responsible for the murder of the professor. - Why would I kill the professor? - To get the Rembrandt letters. He found out and you had to shoot him because he tried to blackmail you. Which brings us more or less up to date... Except that in about 45 minutes from now... the professor's trusty secretary is going to quarrel... with her partner/lover... and shoot him. And he dies... but not before shooting her. Ah, enough of this talk of plots and scenarios. Uh, join me in a cup of coffee, would you? Coffee, mister? - Thanks. - The professor's book is still gonna be published. Oh, yes, indeed, my dear. But without the letters... I'm afraid it will be regarded as the jottings of a revisionist crank. An ex-crank, as a matter of fact. The Silver Streak does have its drawbacks, but please try the marmalade. - They do provide an excellent cuisine. - Oh, thank you, sir. I'll tell the boys in the kitchen. We aims to please. - Coffee, miss? - No, thanks. - He ain't bullshittin' about the cuisine. - Steward? - Is that your lady, man? She's somethin' else. - Steward! - Stand up, mama. Let me get a look at you. - Steward! - Mm, mm, mm! Have mercy! - Steward, you may go. Thank you very much. - Just a little more coffee? - No, thank you. Half a cup? Oh, sorry, sir. - Look what I've done. - You... Get out of... - See what I've done... - You ignorant nigger! Who you callin' nigger, huh? You don't know me well enough to call me no nigger! I'll slap the taste out your mouth! You don't even know my name! I'll whoop your ass! Beat the white of your ass. - Who are you? - I'm a thief. It's all right, Hilly. He's a friend of mine. - Hello. - Hi. - So this is Mr. Big. - That's the man. You ain't sayin' shit now, Mr. Big. I must admit that I'm slightly at a loss for words. But on the other hand, I should warn you... that you are a killer... and you are wanted by the police in every state... and I recommend that you, uh, be careful. You're the killer who's wanted by the police in every state. That man you had shot wasn't a vitamin salesman. He was a federal agent. They've been after you for two years. Ever since that plane crash in Cologne, Germany... when you caused a hundred people to die, just to cover up your link... with the scandal at the Metropolitan Gallery. So why don't we get them the proof that they wanted? Let's go and get the Rembrandt letters. Get up. If you insist. - Get up, Whiney! - Just do what he says. Get the letters, Hilly. Mr. Caldwell... I take it that you are a reasonable man and that,... like all men, you place a reasonable value on your life. Are you trying to bribe me? No. I'm merely pointing out that life is short... and the smart man hedges his bets. You can't protect bets. If there's one thing I have learned from this trip... it's that you play the game and take what you get. - I found them! - Come here, Hilly. Get the girl.! What do you think this is? A western? - What are you doing? - I'm trying to save our asses! - I'm not jumping! - There's a bridge coming up. Get ready! Goddamn it, I'm not jumping! I left this train twice already! - Get ready.! - I'm not jumping! Here it comes! Go! Son of a bitch! Shit! Not again! What are we gonna do now? All right.! Hold it right there.! Shit. I just talked to Chaney. He'll have the helicopter ready in Rockdale. Just about five minutes from the station. We'll be there in 46 minutes. Is there any way of stopping this train between here and there? Aside from the engine, there's an emergency brake in each car. - Disconnect them. - Okay. All of them? Yes, all of them. And take her with you. Come on. They're yours. - You George Caldwell? - Will you please... Would you just tell me... Goddamn it! Would you please tell me what the hell we're doing here and what you want from me! - You are George Caldwell? - Yes, I'm George Caldwell. - I want some information from you, and fast. - I did not kill Sweet. We know that. And if you weren't so dumb,... you would've realized that we planted that news story for your own protection. I've had men posted in every town since Dodge City trying to pick you up... while you're gallivanting around the countryside wasting time. - I didn't know they were federal agents! - Well, let's see what you do know. Here. - How many men has Devereau got on the train? - Two. - What's his plan after they get to Chicago? - He's not going to Chicago. He's getting off at Rockdale. I was afraid of that. Okay. Matthews, over here! We're gonna stop the train before Rockdale. Closest is... the Harris Mill Junction. Contact the railroad. Tell them to make out like it's a routine emergency inspection. Have Bronsky bring his men up in choppers from the south.. Get all the passengers off the train, and I don't want any slip-ups. We'll be there as soon as we can. Caldwell, you come with us. Steward, what do you want to do? This has been a nerve-shattering experience. I'd like to go home. Take him anywhere he wants. Okay, men, grab your rifles. Let's move it.! Caldwell, your shells. Let's go.! - What does he think I'm gonna do with this? - Blow the tires out on the train. Thanks for everything. My pleasure. Goddamn it.! Caldwell, get out here.! If there's ever anything that you need... don't call me. Don't let 'em get you killed. Take it easy, killer. Stay loose. Where'd you like to go, fella? Well.. I left myJag in Kansas City. I don't know, Frank, but that's what they said. Everybody off at the Harris Mill Junction. Everybody off? Okay, I'll tell my crew. - Why are they stoppin' the train? -I don't know, sir. Tryin' to get some security check here. That's the damnedest thing I ever heard! - They want us to get off the train? - Yeah. - Hey, there's the police! - Watch your step. Watch your step. - Well, I'll be... - Come on, get back! You guys are just totally uncontrollable. You know that? - The police are here. - What? The porters are askin' everyone to get off the train. Are they? Keep moving towards the clearing, please. This is a routine investigation. None of you is in danger. Please cooperate with us so we can complete our investigation quickly... and get you back aboard and on your way. Please keep moving... Excuse me. Yeah, excuse me. - Everybody off, please, Mr. Devereau. - Yes. What's happening here, Conductor? We're not sure. We got a call from the police wanting everyone evacuated. - Maybe it's a bomb scare. - A bomb scare? - Then we'd better get off. - I certainly am. Stay with her. Cover us from the window. We're gonna start the engine and take this thing to Rockdale. Hey, what are you doin'? Everybody's gone. What are you doin' with those rifles? You bastards! Everyone's off, Chief, except our boy. Hold it right there, Devereau! - Shit! - Take it easy, killer. What are you doing here? What's going on? Who's in charge here? Would you get down! What did you come back here for? - Uh... I forgot your wallet. - Oh, some thief you are. - Is that your old lady Hilly? - Yeah. Okay, follow me. - Start the engine. - We can't do that. You, move, start it. Mr. Devereau. Mr. Devereau! Guido, come with me! Keep your foot on the pedal. - Come on! - Where are we going? We're getting off at the next stop. - What are you doing? - This is combat. Watch out for the engineer. Sit! - Are you all right? - Yes. How about Grover? Are you all right? - Is it over? - Shit.! Look out! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. Just give me one more pass. Just give me one clear shot. - What happened? - Don't look. Don't look! All right, get theJunction on the radio. Tell them they've got a runaway train. Hey, we're comin' into the station. George, why didn't we stop? What's going on here? I'm not sure, but I don't think that there's anyone in the engine. - No driver? - That's right. Oh, God! Whiney cut all the emergency cords. What are we gonna do? - Well, we have to find some way to get to the engine. - How? The roof? I think so. Come on! - How's it going? - They don't believe us. Look, the engineer is probably anxious to bring the train in on schedule. This is Chief Donaldson. Who's this? This is Jerry Jarvis. I'm the assistant controller. Assistant? Get me your boss. Uh, he's out to lunch, but I'm sure I can handle any problem you might have. It's not my problem. You've got a dead engineer and a runaway train... - that's gonna hit Chicago in 15 minutes. - What are you gonna do about it? All right, I'll check with the signal towers. But, uh, you see, it's impossible. If the engineer is dead, who's driving the train? - What's happening? - Hey, you all right? - Listen, is there any way... - Holy moley! The killer! - No, he's okay. - Listen to me. Is there any way to get to the engine without going over the roof? There ain't no way to get to the engine, period! - Why are we goin' so fast? - Because there's no one driving this train. - Impossible. It would stop. - Does this look as if we're stopping? No, the hell it don't.! I better go pull the emergency cord. The emergency cords have been cut. Damn hippies! I received a report from the signal towers. They see no engineer in the cabin. Great. Now you've got the facts. Throw one of those switches and have the train run off. That's the problem. All the tracks are computer programmed. Switching the Silver Streak would only cause a collision with another train. Then what the hell are you gonna do? There are people riding on that train. Oh, no. You see, the standard procedure... in such an emergency would be to derail the train. Derail it? In the middle of the yard? Yes. Actually, I can't take that responsibility. Uh, I'd better get my boss. You better do something, you idiot, because in 10 minutes... you're gonna have 200 tons of locomotive smashing through Central Station on its way to Marshall Fields! - Where are we going? - If you wanna stop this train, you got to follow me! Hey, Jack, have you seen Benny? Uh, yeah, yeah. I saw him in the coffee shop, Jerry. Now what we have to do is uncouple the cars. You gotta pull up that bar, turn it to the left. When they pull apart, they will bust open the air pressure lines... and the brakes will clamp on throughout the train, then you can jump on back. - But that's dangerous.! - Impossible, man. Grab hold of my belt. - What are you gonna do? - Guess! - Have you seen Benny? - Well, if it isn't the little Caesar of the railroad. - Have you seen Benny! - No. No! Try next door. What's the matter? The Silver Streak is a runaway. What do we do? Jesus! It's gonna be here in four minutes! Your attention, please. May I have your attention, please. You are requested to walk to the nearest exit as quickly as possible. Please do not run. Walk as quickly as possible to the nearest exit. People waiting for the arrival of the Silver Streak on track five... are requested to vacate that area immediately. This is an emergency. Please continue to the nearest exit where a station security... Exit as quickly as possible. You must leave the building.. We did it! We made it! We made it, man! Whoo! Holy shit! Hello, Chicago! Hello! Gotta drink to that! I don't know about you, but next time I'm gonna take the bus. Maybe I'm crazy, but it looks as if it's grinning. Yeah, like the cat who swallowed the canary. - Where's Grover? - I don't know. Take it easy, killer. Stay loose! What's he doing? He's crazy. Crazy? He's got the right idea. - Let's get outta here and go to a park. - A park? Yeah. I want to lie back on the grass... and have you teach me some more about gardening., Virtually the entire Pacific coast of our hemisphere rests on a series of geologic faults. One of the most unstable of these is the San Andreas fault, running 600 miles through the state of California. Some sections of the fault are slipping. The two sides are sliding past each other slowly. The streams accumulating are being dissipated rather harmlessly without generating large earthquakes. At two points, however, the sides of the fault are locked, permitting no slippage. Elastic strain energy is being built up. Invisibly, the land is being compressed and warped, storing energy like a colossal spring under the crust of the earth. Many scientists feel this energy will break loose and a cataclysmic earthquake will occur within the next decade. Other feels it could happen tomorrow. One of the critical points is north of San Francisco. The other, just a few miles east of Los Angeles. Damn it! Your last words last night. The very first words you greet me with this morning. Don't you think you ought to do something about expanding your vocabulary? Yeah, while you expand your chest. Didn't you get enough exercise jogging this morning? Don't you ever get tired? I don't think I'm gonna have time for breakfast this morning. Why not? It's ready. Denise Marshall's boy asked me for an autographed football. I'm gonna drop it off on the way to the office. An autographed football from you. And you haven't played football in 16 years. Well, I guess it's part of this nostalgic binge everybody's on. Anyway, it's the ball Frank Gifford signed. That's the signature he really wants. You know, I find it peculiar. Almost amusing. The widow Brian Marshall comes back into town after seven months, and you rush off without even so much as a cup of coffee. But if I ask you... If you ask me to stop off at the market to pick up a head of lettuce for you, I'd find some excuse. You know, if it wasn't 7:30 in the morning, I would have a drink. I didn't know you were a clock-watcher. What? What did you say? I said, I didn't know you were a clock-watcher. Don't you dare lower your voice to me. Look, what's this all about? I know you. I've been married to you long enough. I know the more contempt you feel for me, the lower the voice. Ah, Remy, you'd hardly call this a marriage, would you? Going now, Remy. I said, I'm leaving. Remy. Remy. Remy. Remy! Remy. Jim? Stewart Graff. She's done it again. Yeah, I think we'll get faster action if you call the ambulance. Well, of course I'll induce vomiting. I know the rules by now. Just get over here, will you? Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, oh. If you're going to throw the pills in the toilet, you might at least flush it. Man, that was a jolt. You can forget your coffee. We got an emergency inspection to run. I'm off duty in half an hour. It was just a little tremor. That's a solid concrete dam. Well, those are the rules, Max. You can always use the overtime. Yeah, I suppose so. Is everything okay? Yeah. Why don't you check the base? I'll look down below. At 7:46 this morning, a minor earthquake registering 3.1 on the Richter scale was felt in the Los Angeles area. No injuries were reported. However, minimal property damage... Repeating a KJB Sig Alert. Hello, Laura? This is Mr. Graff. My secretary in yet? Yeah. Well, tell her I'll be a little late, huh? All right, Mr. Graff, I'll tell her. Let me speak to him. Oh, Mr. Graff? Just a moment, it's your father-in-law. Stewart, see me as soon as you come in. I want to go over that Bill Cameron matter again. Sam, I'm not gonna budge on this. I don't want to lose this contract. I'll talk to you about it later. Thank you. Yes, sir. Fred? Fred? Fred! Fred? Watch it, Lou. You nearly wrecked us up in that last turn. You see? I told you. We're gonna hear about that one. Want to drive, Emilio? No, no, no. You're driving, you're driving. We're over the city line. The Captain will bust our rumps if we mess up here in the county again. Do you remember what happened with that guy Merle? I still don't think his gun went off by accident. I get along just fine with nine toes. I told you to stay out of the county. Merle... Some guys are just too goddamned dumb to stay where they belong. Do you know who owns that hedge you just wrecked? I'm gonna tell you, Slade. It's Zsa Zsa Gabor. Corry, forget about the dishes. You'll be late for school Come on. And remember to go to Mrs. Clark's when you come back, huh? She'll look after you until I'm home from the studio. Stewart! Hi. Come on in. Hi. You brought it. Sorry I forgot it last week. Where did Frank Gifford sign? Right there under the laces. Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Graff. That'll look great on my bookcase. That's really nice of you. Thank you. Couldn't let down my last fan. Hurry. Okay, have a good day. Goodbye, mom. Bye-bye. So long. You know what? What? I've got a part in a movie. Oh, great. Yeah, great. Three days shooting, 22 lines. It's hard. I've been out of it so long. Well, at least I feel alive again, and I didn't for so long after Brian died. Well, I guess I should get dressed. Hey, did you feel that tremor this morning? It really wasn't very strong. No? Would you like some coffee? Yeah. If there's an unbroken cup somewhere that I can find. It'll have to be instant. Yeah, well, instant will be fine. You know, Barbara says you're the best, Barbara? Yes, Barbara. Your boss's secretary. Oh. And my one good friend. Well, she says you're the best engineer in the country. Yeah, well, Barbara's paid to say things like that. Oh, that's the script of the movie I'm doing. ""Movie I'm doing."" That's the overstatement of the year. Here I am, two small scenes, and I'm so worried, I'm so nervous. I was up all night trying to figure out how to make this thing work. Can I help you? Yes. You could read the lines with me. It's just one scene. One page. I think I know it. Right here, near the top. Okay, let me fill you in. I play a bit player. Now, the part you read is a big movie star. A drunk, a gambler, married 18 times, the whole thing. And there's a dinner party. Now, an assistant director invited me, only he's not enough of a, whatever, gentleman, to pick me up. I have to drive myself. Well, that's okay. Now, they're all talking about me just before I come in. You know, asking him the usual questions about bit players. Talk, talk, talk, talk. I come in. Introductions, introductions, introductions. Then our big star, you, makes his appearance. You ignore me, for quite a while. So, I say to you, ""Hello, Mr. Sheppard. ""It's been a long time. ""How have you been?"" And you say, ""Do we know each other?"" ""You bet we do."" That kind of a script. Oh, and the character I'm playing is also supposed to be a nymphomaniac. - Mmm-hmm. - Yeah? And the director of the picture is a strong believer in typecasting. But anyway, I'll cope with that. You want it black? Yeah. Black's... And don't worry. Worry about what? I'm not a nympho. Mind you, I'm not Mary Poppins, either, but I'm far from being, what's the male equivalent of a nympho? Satyr, I think. Satyr? Yeah. Oh. And you don't need to worry, either. Worry? What I mean is, I'm not Billy Graham exactly, but I'm no satyr. Mmm-hmm. That tremor must've stopped the clock. It's a little after nine. And I have a 10 o'clock call. - I'm sorry, I've got to run. - I'm overdue at the office. Listen, thank you for everything. I mean, the cueing, the football and the sympathy. And as Mary Poppins would say, ""Bye-bye."" Eight stitches to close his lower lip, six loosened teeth. You aren't supposed to do things like that to a brother officer. Not a brother officer, sir. Merle is a county cop. I'm talking about Los Angeles cops and county cops. That kid stole a car. Then he got stoned and he slammed into a little girl. A little Mexican girl, about six years old. That little girl was thrown about 15 feet in the air. She was probably dead before she hit the sidewalk. Her blood covered three whole cement squares. Not spattered. Solid. Just like paint. The driver never even slowed down. You will receive a formal notice of suspension. And a date for departmental trial. Now, get on home. Hey, Lou, how'd it go? Michelle, get me the Valley reading. Okay. Have they plotted the epicenter yet? Yes, sir, it was quite a shock. Yes. Yes, nevertheless, there's no scientific evidence that a 3.1 earthquake can loosen dental fillings. No. Right, thank you. Walt! Your turn on the PR desk. Yes, that's right. Dr. Adams. Room 14. He isn't? Well then I'd like to leave a message. Walt! Just a minute, okay? Would you have him call Walter Russell at the Seismology Institute? Yeah, it's very important. Yes, thank you. Here's a strange one. ""Caretaker at the Hollywood reservoir dam ""drowned at the bottom of an elevator shaft."" They still haven't figured out what happened. Okay. What's the matter? You look sick. I just found out Dr. Adams stayed up at the fault an extra day. So? Well, I sent some figures and a memo into the Director's office late yesterday afternoon. I don't think he's even read them yet. Figures on what? Well, I know you'll laugh, but I think we're gonna have a really big quake. Probably today. Tomorrow at the latest. And I wanted Dr. Adams here to back up my computations. Thought you were leaving yesterday, Dr. Adams. We've been held up. But we hope to have most of the instruments planted by noon. Still haven't figured out exactly what it is you fellas are trying to do. It's rather technical. That device records minute variations of seismic waves. Huh. Well, better start my plowing. Thanks again for letting us on your land, Mr. Griggs. Once the trench is filled in, you'd never have known we were here. Well? That was nice. Real nice. Yeah, tell me this, you gonna have this thing ready for this afternoon? I'll have it ready, don't worry. But I think we'll need an extra can of butane there. Come on, Sal, huh? We'll pick one up when we go for Rosa this afternoon, all right? All right. What I want to know is, are you gonna get her to help us? Yeah, yeah, she'll help us. Well, she's not too crazy about our line of work, man. Miles, I'll get her. Well, you better, because this Vegas job is the biggest break we ever had. Miles, I'll get her. I'll get her. What do you want? Will you relax? All right. Wow. That'll be $20.16. Forgot to bring enough cash? That's right. Hey, I'll put this back. Who needs protein anyway? Don't worry about it. Drop the money off the next time you're in. Thanks. Find anything? All okay as far as I can tell! I'll check again! I guess we won't find anything until after the shaft is pumped out. But everything looks fine. Right. People drown in elevators every damn day of the week. Officer, can you order these freaks out of here? They've been scaring my customers away, and I've been trying to get them to leave. You got something against religion? What'll you have? Double bourbon, Jay. In uniform, Lou? Naked in a glass will do just fine. Spiro T. Agnew. You asked to see me, Dr. Stockle? Yes, sit down. Russell, this is very interesting. You forecast an earthquake in the three to four point range this morning. We had an earthquake in the three to four point range this morning. I'm impressed. Thank you, sir. However, isn't it rather slender evidence for predicting a catastrophe? Sir, these are based on this morning's signals from those stress measurement instruments that Dr. Adams sank during that experimental well project. They indicate another pre-shock, probably before noon today. And if it happens? Then the big one follows in 48 hours. At least seven point. Now, naturally, if that second minor shock doesn't occur, then it just proves that my computations were based on insufficient evidence. But I think we have a strong... Russell, Russell, you are still a graduate assistant. Are you seriously contending that a graduate assistant would be the first scientist in history to pinpoint a major earthquake within 48 hours? No, sir. But I am following through on Dr. Adam's theories and the probability curves that he drew up. But I feel that I've been on the project... Dr. Adams is on a field trip upstate. I sure wish he wasn't. Thank you, Russell. Leave those. Fiona, I want some figures run through the computer. And try to get Frank Adams for me in Fresno. Yeah? Morning, Sam. Morning, Stu. Listen, you still refuse to handle the Bill Cameron job unless he upgrades the specifications? Absolutely. Okay. But you're gonna have to convince him that those changes are necessary. I could never talk him into anything. Oh, do me one more favor, huh? Don't muff the deal. Oh, just a moment. Mr. Royce, your daughter's on the phone, 347. Thank you. He'll be right on. Remy? Hello, Remy. Fine. Well, I was planning on eating here in the building. Well, come on in. No, away from the office. Oh, it's terribly important. Oh. Okay, honey. The Windsor at 1:15? And try to calm down. Okay. Bill, here comes another one. It's a pretty good shake. Hey, that shot didn't count. No way can it count. Hey, nothing in the rule book about earthquakes. It didn't count. Yeah, it did. Hardly ever get two in one morning. Two what? Earthquakes. In another half hour, I won't feel the one that's supposed to knock California into the ocean. The Captain's cooled off. He's gonna do his damnedest to straighten things out. I don't want to be a cop anymore. Right since the time I was a kid, I figured on cops helping folks, you know? Folks who couldn't help themselves. All right, maybe that was dumb of me, but that's the way I figured. But folks don't count for a diddly, do they? Take it easy, now. I'll call you at home later. Sure, Emilio. The shot counted. Bobby Riggs. That wasn't there before the tremor. I know every inch of this dam. It's a new one. Max, I'm a trained technician. You're a watchman. Now, stop trying to teach me my business. It wasn't there. There's no such thing as solid concrete and you know it. Hairline cracks are bound to appear from time to time. You don't panic over them. The water's rising. It's gone up half an inch since the quake. He's right. This is your captain. We will passing over Grand Canyon National Park in approximately one minute. So that you may better enjoy the grandeur of its beauty, we will turn the plan to the right. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles long, a mile deep, and in some sections, 18 miles wide. Now you can see the Colorado River directly below us. On your left is the south rim. On your right is the north rim. They're about 10 miles apart. We are returning to our course. We'll be arriving at Los Angeles International in approximately 55 minutes. Is that all your interested in is Stewart Graff? Right now, honey, I'm interested in our future, which happens to be in the hands of Stewart Graff. Now, you know how important this interview is. But I don't wanna live in Los Angeles. Couldn't you try for a job in New York? Honey, we've been over this so many times. I don't think you realize what an opportunity this could be for us. Well, all I know, is ever since we've been married, all you do is either talk or read about that man. It's like I don't even exist. Look, I'll tell you what, after we stop over in Los Angeles for my interview, we'll take the very first plane out to Hawaii. And I promise you, I won't mention anything on our honeymoon about Stewart Graff, okay? Then how will I know if you got the job or not? Already I'm learning there's no pleasing a woman. I'll tell you whether or not I was accepted and then I won't discuss it, all right? But that's no way to start off a marriage, keeping things from me. Katherine, what's the matter with you? You've been bored with your card games before. Now, if you love me, do me a favor, get yourself a magazine, play solitaire, anything, but just let me finish studying this article. Tony, you know, you've never talked to me like that before. Do you know this is our first real quarrel? Boy, I certainly know who the boss is gonna be in this family, and it's not me. Well, good. Now we won't have any more problems, will we? Let me tell your fortune, okay? Not again. Come on, I wanna find out about your interview. See what the cards say. Shuffle. All right. If it'll keep you busy. Roger ASP-153. ASP-153. Go ahead. We have had a second tremor this morning with only minor damage. There is no reason to alter your course. Thank you, LAX. Hmm, boy, it's a good thing my wife's a native Californian. Why's that? All those earthquakes never bother her. I wish my wife was more like that. Every time we have a little shake, she hounds me to move to the country. Nine of hearts. Realization of an important goal, success in your career, both in prestige and financially. That's exactly what you told me last night. Oh, come on. Ah, the eight of hearts. That's a happy card, signifying mutual love and domestic bliss. You will have three children. The seven of spades casts a shadow. No, no. It is doubtful whether you'll have them or not. Double king, ace of diamonds. You have strong character, insist on having your own way. Boy, that fits you. Hard working, ultimate success in business. Now, the four of spades and the jack of clubs. There'll be an illness in a young person close to you. Hmmm. There's danger to travel at this time, possibility of death. Well, just as well you weren't listening. But it could all be coincidence. I don't see running wild over some untested theory, at least until we've heard from Frank Adams. After all, it's his research project, and not Walt's. No one can find Frank Adams. No one was sure the atom bomb would work until they dropped it. It worked. Our present problem is what in God's name do we do now? Well, we warn people. Do we? Think about it. A public announcement now that a major earthquake is imminent, whew, that could create incredible panic. People climbing over people trying to get out of the city. That could be a worse disaster than the quake itself. But an orderly evacuation could save hundreds of thousands of lives. An orderly evacuation to where? The desert? The mountains? How do you feed and shelter four million people in open country? And suppose we release this information and there isn't a big quake? Well, what's the point in learning how to predict an earthquake, if you don't do anything about it after you predict it? Russell! Russell, look! Dr. Johnson and I are not cynical. But a false alarm now, even if it went no further than the Mayor or the Governor's office, would destroy the institute's credibility. Credibil... Look, Russell! Four or five years from now, we come up with a foolproof detection system. Who in authority is gonna believe us then? Yeah? No. No, no, don't call his wife. I'll take care of it myself. Frank Adams is dead. So's young Ward. They were working in a trench across the fault. The walls collapsed. Fiona, get me the Mayor's office. It's a matter of gravest urgency. See if you can push the blueprint room on those revised drawings for the Cameron job, will you, Carl? He'll want to see them this afternoon. Okay, Stewart. I've got to get out of here for a while. This place is closing in on me. Denise, hi. You finished working already? Never got started. Would you believe it? The tremor damaged the set, and they rescheduled my scene for tomorrow. So, I thought I'd drop in on Barbara. Something wrong? No, I need a drink. Oh. Are you one of those solitary drinkers? Not if I can help it. Would you join me? Yes. Yes. Do you realize what you're asking of me? What's really happening with you two? He's been seeing Brian Marshall's widow. Well, of course. He feels obligated to help her out. Her and her boy. Oh, Albert Schweitzer wasn't that dedicated to mankind. There's more to it, Remy. It was Stewart who assigned Brian that propane cavern job, and he's been blaming himself for what happened ever since. Oh, Dad, don't be so naive. I know they're having an affair. When you met Stewart, he was a dirt-poor boy trying to work his way through college on an athletic scholarship. I think you still half see him that way. But he's a top man now. He doesn't need me, he doesn't need anybody. There isn't a firm in town wouldn't take him on his own terms. How big a quake? A seven on the Richter scale, possibly higher. That could release more than the total energy generated by the Hiroshima, Nagasaki nuclear bombs combined. If I issue a public warning, you know what will happen to this city? Of course we know, that's impossible. But there are some precautions you could take, aren't there? Alert the police, the fire department. Have the Governor mobilize the National Guard. Well, he could announce that it's necessary to prevent looting at the Valley quake site. Well, the police have that situation totally under control. Mayor Louis, the next situation, if it comes, would be somewhat different. The Governor and I aren't even in the same party. If this turns out to be a false alarm, he'll make me look like the biggest fool west of the Mississippi. Second biggest. I'll top the list. What do you say, Lou? Hey, Rosa, Hiya, pal. The ladies room is through that door and a couple of steps to the right. You still pursuing those evildoers? Not as hard as usual. Hey, Jay, we want a couple of burgers and some orange juice to go. Two burgers and orange juice to go. The 50 bucks, Miles. You owed me for three weeks. Hey, listen, man. What if I pay you tomorrow. Okay? Hey, the 50. You're a great bike rider but a lousy pool shooter. Officer, I mean, you're not gonna let him get away with this, are you? Yes. 50 bucks, or I'll break your back. Peter Fonda. Hey, hey, Sal. Hey, wait. Here. Take it. Yeah, I'll take it. Thanks. Brother. Miles, what're you doing? All I've got is a dollar and some loose change on me. Hey, Lou, hey, come on. Lend me 10 bucks, huh? I don't have time to go to the bank. You better stop breathing those gas fumes so much. Hey, listen, Lou, this is an emergency, man. We need a butane tank for the stunt. I'll have it back to you tomorrow. I promise. Come on, Lou. This is really important to me. This big guy is coming down from one of the big Vegas hotels to see this act. Now, there has never ever been anything like this. If that hotel sponsors us, man, I could wind up on ABC's Wide World of Sports, man. And after that, you can forget about Evel Knievel. It'll be just the Miles Quade Story. You know, I'm sorry I ever arrested you two. I've been paying for it ever since. Hello. Rosa, I want you to meet Lou Slade. He's the cop who flattened Miles and I with a blackjack at the North Hollywood rally last year. Hey, that's right. And we didn't even start that ruckus. Well, you should've knocked their brains into place. Come here, Rosa. I want to talk to you. Come here. Listen. If I had the bread, I would hire a beautiful, sexy broad this afternoon, and I would kick your all the way home. Well, I don't need your help. Bye. Now, Rosa, will you listen to me? Daredevil motorcyclists always have to have beautiful, sexy broads hanging around. Rosa, that's right. What do you want, us to look like phonies or what? Sal, I'm your sister. What about Maureen? She's your girlfriend. Come on, Rosa. Maureen is too flat-chested. Rosa, come here. Now, Rosa, I want you to show the officer your T-shirt. Oh, yeah, Lou, take a look at this. We're gonna have 20, maybe 30,000 of these made up after the Vegas show. Go ahead, take a look. See what you think of it. I think it's beautiful. My wife will ask me, is she pretty? And I'll say, quite. And she'll say, something like, that figures. Tell me about her. And you'll say, nothing much to tell. We just had a drink. And she'll ask me, no small talk? Very little. A trait that goes with engineering. Yeah, maybe it does. It's good. Can I ask you something? Sure. Anything. When we made love, when you made love to me, it was with such, such, I'm trying to think of exactly the right word. It was with such anger. Anger? Yeah, anger. Did I anger you? No. I think you are absolutely lovely. Well, I think so, too. I'm not hurt. Tell me, how long has Barbara worked at the office? Oh, 10, 12 years. Well, did you ever know me to drop in on her before? No. Certainly not since you got back to LA. Well, maybe I didn't want to see Barbara. Maybe I wanted to see you. Hmm? How about that? Yeah, how about that? So, you didn't seduce me. I seduced you. Great. Well, next time I'll do the honors. Oh, don't feel there has to be a next time. Don't think that you just made a lifelong commitment. Come here. Why? Come here. I have to go to Oregon this summer. All summer on a hydroelectric project. Come up there, with Corry. I'll rent a house for the two of you. It's such beautiful, really beautiful country. It'd be great for him. Please. I'll think about it. I'll come back tonight. I'll think about that, too. We interrupt our regular program to bring you a special bulletin. The Governor has just announced that the following National Guard units have been put on emergency active duty status. The Fourth Infantry support group, the 227th Heavy Transport Battalion, the 112th Headquarters Company, the 33rd Communications Battalion, the 47th Engineers Company. Let me show you What's happening. First of all, we start up there. Then it's down that ramp, like hell into that first big loop, up this ramp, zoom over the truck, down this ramp and straight into that big figure eight. Then it's down that ramp right into that fire ring. Now, that fire ring doesn't just have flames on the outside, like in your dog acts. No, no, we rigged those gas jets to shoot flames right in the center. Then it's down that ramp, over that pit, and we're home free. Now, you take a guy like Knievel. Now, he'll jump 20, maybe 30 cars, and call it a big thing. But, baby, let me tell you something, compared to those, landing on a roof of a car at 100 miles an hour, that's like landing in a water bed. Miles, you're out of your mind. Hey, but, Rosa, wait a minute. No, no way. If you want to help your best friend kill himself, fine. Rosa, listen, now, listen. Don't be rotten. There's nothing to it. It is simple! Who do you think you're kidding? I'm going to a movie. I'm going home to change into some fresh duds. Ciao. You're gonna fix it up. You're gonna fix it up. All right, all right, all right. She's nervous. She's... Yeah, sure. Just a minute. Oh, hello. Hi. Oh, I'm sorry, I was going to pay you tomorrow> Come in and I'll get... Oh, no, no, no. Miss Amici, that's not what I came here for. You didn't? No, there's been an emergency. The National Guard's been called up and I have to report in for duty. I mean, after that second tremor, I wanted to make sure that you were okay. Sure. Sure, I'm fine, why not? Well, come in and see for yourself. Oh, thank you. I never seem to find time to clean this dump. I'll be glad to give you a hand. No thanks. Sit down. Oh, it's my brothers idea. It's sort of an advertising gimmick for his business. Say, um, how did you know where I live? Well, I followed you home at night just to make sure you got home safely. You gotta be kidding. No, no. Somebody as pretty as you needs to be looked after. Don't you worry about a thing. I'm gonna take care of you. Are you for real? My family doesn't even worry about me. I can take care of myself. You know, you're not very neat, Miss Amici. Bet then again, my mother wasn't either. Look, uh, I was gonna go to a movie. You wanna go with me? That is if you've got time. No, I've got official business to take care of. Besides you shouldn't be going out so much alone anyway. Now listen, you stay right here. I have to report for duty, then I'll be back to look after you. You believe me, Miss Amici. I know exactly what's best for you. You just stay right here, okay? Bye-bye, now. How about a lift? You and that bike can take a lift outta here. Hey, give me a hand here. It's gonna be rough to get this one under control. What a terrible sight. What do you mean terrible? It's not terrible. It's beautiful. We're probably gonna have more fires from the aftershocks. Oh, I hope not. Where's them cantaloupes? We asked you for some free cantaloupes, Jody. Say, my friend, what kind of friend are you? Still playing soldier boy, Jody? That's right. We saw on television where you're gonna go play soldier boy. Say, say, say, say, say, say. Is it true that blondes have more fun? Oh, no. Look at that. Fall in! Hey, yo. Left, right, left, right. Let's decorate the warrior. Eyes straight to the front, soldier. Quit looking around. Now the motion in this model was programmed from the actual recorded ground motion of a 6.2 earthquake. Long Beach in '33. Now, a magnitude of eight would produce a motion... What's your point? Bill, we live in an earthquake zone. What can I tell you? That I've failed to meet city or state safety requirements? That's not the point. I think we should go beyond the codes. You remember the Sylmar quake. A lot of buildings that met the code collapsed. I thought you were gonna chew me out for leaning on Bill Cameron. Oh, I just figured it was time I kicked myself upstairs. And I always like the feel of that name, Chairman of the Board. Has a nice ring. Congratulations, Mr. President. Thanks, Sam. Oh, listen. You're gonna have to forget about that Oregon project, I guess. We can't have a new company president pouring cement out in the woods somewhere. What's the matter? Look, I just promoted you. I didn't fire you. No, Sam, you're gonna figure I'm crazy, but I'd like a little time to think this over. Okay. Any problems I ought to know about? No, just a few priorities I've got to get straight in my head. Sure. Sam, Remy didn't have anything to do with this, did she? Don't worry. You'd have this job even if you weren't my son-in-law. Oh, hold that. Hello? Hello, Denise? Stewart. Hi. Look, I'm not gonna be able to make it tonight. Something important came up at work. Any trouble? No, no trouble. I've just got a problem to solve. I'm sorry. I'm sorrier than you are. Oh, it doesn't matter about tonight. We'll have lots of time together up in Oregon. Okay? Bye-bye. Goodbye. Mom? Mom. Yeah? Okay if I go to the playground? Sure. Just be careful crossing that bridge, huh? And, Corry, if I'm not home when you get back, don't worry. I might take a walk later. If leave the kitchen door unlocked. I think I'll make a practice run. Loosen up the machine. All right, Sal. Miles! Miles, you all right? Huh? Came out of that damn thing. What happened? Huh? Come on, help me try again. Listen to me, Miles. We only have one 250 left. You understand me? Huh? What're you talking about, man? I gotta try it again! Okay. Okay, you're the boss. Come on. All right, Miles, come on, baby. Come on, come on! Let her roll! Delay in the contract, I suggest, Barbara. Mmm-hmm? You knew Brian Marshall? Yes. Ever meet his wife? Sure, we see each other all the time. What's she like? She's a very nice girl. Yes, I was afraid of that. Yes? Mr. Royce, your daughter's on the way into your office. Fine. Remy. Good afternoon, Mrs. Graff. Hello, Barbara. Have you spoken to Stewart yet? Yes. He said he wanted to think about it. Los Angeles approach. This is ASP-153. Do you read me? This is Los Angeles approach. Go ahead ASP-153. ASP-153, go miles northeast at 10,000. BFR on time. Request landing information. Roger, ASP-153. Use runway two five left. Wind, 15 knots. You are number two, following the world's 747. Maintain present heading and altitude to intercept the ILS. Upon intercepting the ILS, you are cleared for approach. Report on outer marker, please. Roger. Miles, here he comes now. The guy from Vegas. Oh, baby. This is gonna be the greatest run of my life. I'm tuned to just the right pitch. Now, you go on home and put this right out of your mind. You look exhausted. Thanks, Dad. Sam, I, hello, Remy. Well, I guess you've got yourself a new president. Great! And you'll stay away from that Marshall woman? Stewart. Stewart, wait. Stewart, where are you going? Anywhere. A bar. Why are you so angry? Remy, don't you understand? That was a bribe. Another bribe! Our whole marriage has been a series of bribes. And you took them. Well, it's time I quit. I'm not that stupid. Please fasten your seatbelts. We are now approaching Los Angeles International Airport. I hope you had a pleasant flight. Enjoy your stay in Los Angeles. Please remain in your seats until the plane has come to a complete stop. Don't forget to check your luggage in the compartment above and under your seat. Thank you. LAX tower, this is ASP-153 on the outer marker, inbound. Roger, ASP-153. You are clear to land on runway two five left. Roger. Clear to land on two five left. Max. Hey. Finally found the trouble. I guess the earthquake busted the conduit and it's flooded the bottom of the shaft. Get down! Holy mother of God! Help me! Oh, God, help me! Help! What is she doing? What's happening? Tony! ASP-153, go around, go around, runway breaking up. One, five, hold that. Come on. Next Sunday night on The Big Event, NBC will present part two of Earthquake. Jim, Stewart Graff. She's done it again. Now jut get over here, will ya? Oh, oh my God! Oh! Fred! Fred! Fred! Fred? Russell, this is very interesting. You forecast an earthquake in the three to four point range this morning. We had an earthquake in the three to four point range this morning. I'm impressed. Thank you, sir. However, isn't it rather slender evidence for predicting a catastrophe? How big a quake? A seven on the Richter scale, possibly higher. That could release more than the total energy generated by the Hiroshima, Nagasaki nuclear bombs combined. Hey, yeah, Lou, take a look at this. We're gonna have 20, maybe 30,000 of these made up after the Vegas show. Go ahead, take a look, see what you think of it. I think it's beautiful. Could I ask you something? Sure, anything. When we made love, when you made love to me, it was with such, such, I'm trying to think of exactly the right word. It was with such anger. Anger? Yeah, anger. Did I anger you? No. I think you are absolutely lovely. That wasn't there before the tremor. I know every inch of this dam. It's a new one. Max, I'm a trained technician. You're a watchman. Now stop trying to teach me my business. It wasn't there. There's no such thing as solid concrete and you know it. You will have three children. Ace of diamonds. You have strong character, insist on having your own way. Boy, that fits you. Hmmm. There's danger to travel at this time. Possibility of death. Oh, hello. Hi. Oh, I'm sorry. I was gonna pay you tomorrow. Come in and I'll get it. Oh, no, no, no. Miss Amici, that's not what I came here for. You didn't? I mean after that second tremor, I wanted to make sure that you were okay. Sure. Sure, I'm fine, why not? Well, I guess you got yourself a new president. Great. And you'll stay away from the Marshall woman. Why are you so angry? Remy, don't you understand? That was a bribe, another bribe. Our whole marriage has been a series of bribes. And you took them. Well, it's time I quit. Tony! ASP-153, go around, go around. Runway breaking up. Please help me. Where's the door? Somebody's gotta get us outta here. Help! Mother, help me up! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Hey, Al, give me a hand. Come on, over here! Turn off the gas! Oh, my God! Stay here. Help. Is there a doctor around here? Barbara, Barbara! Barbara! Mr. Cameron threw me out of the elevator. And then I heard all those people screaming! All right, take it easy, everybody. It's over now. It's over. Over here. Take care of it. Ben, get the first aid kits over there. All right, all right, now listen to me, everybody. Let's just settle down. The worst is over, do you understand? The worst is over. Hey! Break the windows. Break the windows! Come on, over there! It's not safe here! You gotta get, come on, get out of here. Get out of here! Whoa, all right. Come on, hurry up, hurry up. Come on. Don't slow down! No stairs! Corry! Corry? Calling Van Nuys. Calling Van Nuys. We really got problems. Thank God we had mobile units to bring in. Let's get to the control panel. Fires out of control, Van Nuys Hospital, all roads blocked between Victory and Kittridge. Is there any way I can broadcast to the whole city, get picked up on transistor sets? There's a few commercial stations on the quake fringe area still operating. We might be able to rig a microwave relay to one of them. Well, get on it, then. Hey, you, come here. Help, damn it! Slide him out from under there. Hey, who do you have to know to get a drink around here? Shut off that gas valve. Help me. Help me. Help me. You guys, check that edge. Both sides. You two, check up here. Both sides. Couple of guys down below. It held. My God, it held. How much longer? I'm gonna divert some water into the spillways. We gotta cut down on the pressure. Not Without official permission, you're not. It's dead. I told you to leave that alone. The city's gonna need every drop of water it can get. There's dozens of fires down there already. If this dam busts, there won't be nothing between here and Wilshire Boulevard left to burn. The quake may have broken something inside. It won't budge. It won't budge. Gotta get outta here! Stewart, you'd better get out of here. The whole building is full of phosgene. You'd better get out, too. Maybe there's some way down through an elevator shaft. Shut the door. It's giving. I've got it. Shut it. Get me, Get me a chair, with arms. All right, put it down there. Pull it all the way. Here, hold this. All right, pull the chair. Hold it up here. We need something flexible to strap 'em in. Pantyhose. Barbara, take off your pantyhose, damn it. You, too. Come on. Take off your pantyhose. Get it out. Here's one. Here comes the first one. Let her down as slow as you can. And keep down the sway. Steady. It's okay. You made it. There. It's all right now. Now, let me give it another shot. Now, try it again. Yeah, yeah! You guys owe me a six-pack. You got it. Corry! Corry, sweetie. All right. Okay. I'll get you out. Okay, it's going to be all right. I'll lift you up. Okay, try. Help! I don't believe it. I don't believe it. What do you mean? Busted! The ramps are busted, the loops are busted, the rings are busted. I hope to God Evel Knievel was in town today. Why? Huh? Help! Please, help me! Help! Help! Help! Here, down here! Help me. My son is hurt. Help us. - Huh? - Come on. Okay. Take it easy, lady. Yeah. Come on, push him up here. Push him up here, lady. Slowly. Got him? Got him? Yeah, I got him. Careful. Stay right there and watch those wires. It'll be hours before we drain off enough to do any good. Help! Help me. Hold on, lady. Help me. Hold on, lady. Miles, put him right here. Here we go. Where are we gonna take him, huh? There's no hospital for miles. I guess we better head for the police station. Yeah. Yeah, let's go. How can I find out about my daughter? She's in County Hospital. My store. The whole front is gone. You've got to help me protect it. Why aren't the firemen here yet? Please, help me find a doctor. My husband's legs are broken. Stop! You're all gonna have to help yourselves. Most of the police in this district were killed in that station house. And the guys that were on patrol when the quake hit, well, they probably got more to do than they can handle. Now, look, you get as many volunteers as you can. Go to that hardware store over there. Now, if it's locked, break in. Find as many picks and shovels as you can. And start looking for people who are buried alive. There are plenty of 'em, believe me. Give him a hand. Move it! Now, I want all the women and the kids who have houses in any kind of shape at all, to go to them and to stay there. Now, turn off all the gas lines... Hey, I'm getting something. Ladies and gentlemen, stand by for a message from the Mayor of Los Angeles. This city has suffered the greatest natural disaster in the history of the United States. The state and the nation are rallying to our aid. But for the next few hours, until massive help can reach us, we will have to depend on our own physical and spiritual resources. Private physicians should report to emergency aid stations, now being set up at key sites throughout the city. Bring all the medical supplies you can carry. Clinics have been established in the following locations, the Hollywood Bowl, the Occidental Insurance building, the Wilson Plaza... Laura! Laura, my father? Is he all right? My father! Laura, my father! God! Go on. Come on, you're next. Move. You all right? Sam, why didn't you go ahead of some of the younger guys? Staying up here was crazy. I don't think I'm strong enough to lower you all the way by myself. So, get ready for a jolt. Oh! Let's get out of here. Give me your hand, will you? Watch yourself. Okay. Easy. Do you know Denise Marshall, Barbara? Yes. See if you can get to a phone, find out if she's all right. Are the phones working? Try, please! Okay. Come on, let's get out of here. Officer, are the phones working? Nowhere. Out all over the city. Hey, Lou. Miles? Look, we got a hurt kid in the back. He's in shock. Well, all we can do is keep him warm until we can get up to a doctor. Here. You figure you can find your way to Wilson Plaza in this heap? They got an emergency medical station set up down there. I got to find my sister Rosa. She went to the movies. We've got a lot of injured to move and you're gonna move them in this. And I'm gonna stay here. Come on, now give me the bike. I've got to find Rosa. Listen, just do what he says. I'll find Rosa on the bike. I can get around better than anybody. Okay. Move out. Single file. Hey, grab the cash! Okay. This way. Let's go this way. Did you get it? Yeah, hang on. Yeah. Over here. Let's go. Hey, get away from that cash register. I was just trying to get home and I was hungry. Look, I'd like to let you go, miss, but we have strict orders on looters. They're all supposed to be placed under arrest. I was just hungry... And no exceptions. Now, come on, let's go, come on. Cars must leave the garage area after dropping off patients. Hot coffee and food is available in basement shopping levels two and three. Please keep moving. Move right along. Please keep moving. More doctors are waiting at the first garage level. Hot coffee and food is available in basement shopping levels two and three. All cars must leave the garage area after dropping off patients. Please keep moving. More doctors are waiting at the first garage level. Cars must leave the garage area after dropping off patients. Hold it. Hold it. Oxygen. Get me a blood pressure. Wait. How do you feel? Hard to breathe. Chest pains? Yes. He's had a heart attack. Come on. Start him on a liter of 5% dextrose. Cars must leave the garage area after dropping off patients. Stewart! Denise and her boy will need help, too. I've got to try and find them. Is she more important than me? Than our life together? Than everything, Remy, for God's sake, Stewart, we tried to be, please. I'm sorry. Bye. Cars must leave the garage area after dropping off patients. Please keep moving. Hot coffee and food is available in... I'm talking with the people at the dam, Mayor Louis. They're maintaining a constant inspection. I can't take any chances, Colonel. Dr. Stockle said we can expect aftershocks. And I just got a report from the Building and Safety Department. They say some structures may look perfectly sound but have been so weakened, that even a minor quake can bring them down. Evacuate the area immediately below the dam. This is a precautionary evacuation. We repeat, there is no present danger of the dam collapsing. Move to high ground, west of Highland Avenue and north of Franklin. This is a precautionary evacuation. I repeat, this is a precautionary evacuation. Wait, wait! They're not lying to you. You've got plenty of time. Stay there, stay there. Come on, lay down. You're gonna be all right, you're gonna be all right. Halt. Hey, Sid. Hi. How come you took this bunch prisoners? Suspicion of looting. Hey, how about turning that dark-haired girl over to me? She's a friend. Yeah, sure. Hey, you. Come here. Yeah, come on. Can I go home now? Can't allow that. You're my responsibility. - But... - Come on. It's a couple dozen blocks back to your house, and now that it's getting dark, the animals are loose. But... You just make yourself comfortable inside the store here. I have to send out patrols. You all patrol that area up there and watch out for looters. Move out! Hey, Sarge, look what we found. Jody, what a break! Caught these guys around the corner. Their car broke down. Look at the goodies they had with them. We didn't steal 'em, honest. The old lady gave us the jewelry. You think we ought to shoot 'em? Jody, we've just been putting you on. You can't kill guys for that. Maybe they didn't steal these necklaces and things. Maybe they're just fags who like to dress up in women's jewels. You find any dresses in the car? No, Jody. Well, I guess we'll have to shoot 'em. Hey, wait a minute, Jody. I was telling these guys just today to lay off. I swear to God, I was. Ask 'em, ask 'em. Sure, those naked guys on the wall, that didn't mean nothing. We knew that you lifted weights. Scum like you think you can get away with anything. Push people around when you want to. Steal when you want to. Make fun of men who have to work for a living, huh? But not today. Hey, come back, you guys. I was only kidding. Hey, Hey, don't do that, man. Not like back in the store, is it, Miss Amici? Coming in asking for double Green Stamps two days after the special's over, huh? None of that stuff. Move it! I want this whole patrol area quarantined. No civilians are to be allowed through without being questioned. Can't tell. They might be looters. What about the people trying to get through to Wilson Plaza aid station? I meant everybody. There's no other clear streets around here. Move out! Denise! Denise! All right, out. What are you talking about? You're healthy enough to walk. I got a lot of injured to move and I mean, fast. That dam up there is liable to go at any minute. I've got some people I've got to find. This thing looks like it'll go anywhere and that's just what I need. Now, get out. Just a minute. You're one of those trouble makers, aren't you? I've never shot a trouble maker before, or are you gonna get out? Look. I'm looking for a girl and a little boy. They mean a lot to me. Send your butler. Where's the shift? All of them. Depends on what you want to do. That's a customized transmission. It's got eight forward speeds, and three reverse. All of them a hell of a lot harder to operate than that.38. All right, you're an ambulance driver. What? I'm sorry, it's been a hell of a day. Okay, that's it. We got one more. We are in desperate need of blood type AB negative. Check Red Cross blood bank, and report back. Officer Scott. Coffee and food is available in basement shopping levels two and three. I never thought we'd get here. Careful. A long time to go a couple of lousy miles. Listen, lady, I gotta go now. I gotta move the truck out. I'll see you. Thank you very much. He's had a bad fall, he's hit his head and he just won't come to. Can I go with him? No, no. We'll get in touch with you. On the third level. Thank you. Right around there. Coming through. Please keeping moving. Those not needing medical aid, please stay away from the field hospital. Please, help me, somebody. Doctor, nurse, anybody, The building must have its own generators. Barbara! Barbara! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm just terrified. You? I'm fine, but Corry's had a bad fall. He's upstairs with the doctor. Oh! Stewart Graff, is he all right? Yeah, he's all right, the last I saw, but Mr. Royce had a heart attack. He's had a heart attack? I'm just waiting word from the doctor. Listen, I've got to get out of here, I'm going up for some air. Will you come with me? No, I'd rather stay here. I'll see you later. Take care. He's gone. He never had a chance. Should I tell his daughter? I don't want any deaths reported to the survivors until things settle down. Miss Amici. Miss Amici? You better eat. This is nice and fresh. Hank got into the deli down the street. A lot of guys with hair over regulation length wear 'em. Oh. You know, I really used to look forward to seeing you in the supermarket. You never complained like all the rest of those women, carrying on. Thank you. And I hope the lousy store was knocked flat. What I really want to do is open a karate school. I'll have enough saved pretty soon. A lot of money in karate, you know. I'll give you free lessons. I'm not really very hungry. It's a hot night out. Why don't you take off that jacket? You always liked me, too. I could tell. You never said anything, but I could tell. Don't, don't hurry me. It's no real fun that way. Everything all right? Yeah, fine. Another one of those damned earth slides on the other side of the reservoir? Uh-huh. That's a scary sound. Uh-huh. How is he? Oh, he's going to be all right. Mild shock and a concussion. I've given him something to help him sleep. Where are you taking him now? Well, the Army Medics have set up their field x-ray trucks in the third level garage. Doctor! Doctor! Why aren't you with my father? Don't bother me now. Get down, get down! Red Cross emergency aid stations are already functioning. Are you sure you know the way to Wilson Plaza? Damn it, that's where I just came from. The Mayor's office has not yet released a damage report on the aftershock. However, details are expected momentarily. Please stand by. There's other buildings sure to have come down. First time in my life I'm ashamed of my profession. We never should have put up those 40-story monstrosities. Not here. Hey! What's the matter? The door's out of line. It wasn't before that aftershock a few minutes ago. Don't be scared. We'll be feelin' those quivers for days, the CO said. That looks great. A pretty girl ought to have nice things. I've always thought so. Hey, you gotta forget about the way it used to be. Your brother could be dead. Nobody left but me to take care of you. Well, I've got another brother in San Francisco. And he's in the Mafia. There's another car coming, Jody. This area's quarantined. You'll have to detour. I'm a police officer. We're transporting injured people. This is an emergency. What isn't after an earthquake? Go back or take them to a Hare Krishna temple. Lou, help me. He's nuts! Crazy. What the hell are you doing? I know this kid. She's under detention. Looting. Take it easy. All right. Okay. Go back the way you came. Okay. Move out! Don't leave me with him! Lou! Lou, help me! Lou, help me! Lou! I'm going for an officer. That guy in there is cracked. Come on, hey, come on. Pull up another hundred feet. Pull it around the corner and stop. Nuts, am I, huh? You got your nerve. Rosa! Let's go. Better not. Come on, Rosa. Come on. Settle down, will you, huh? Earthquakes bring out the worst in some guys, that's all. Here. Come on. Here, look. Look what you got. Look at what you got to take care of. Caused by a ruptured gas main. Oh. Total evacuation is under way. My brother told me you were a strange kind of cop. Dozens of weakened structures collapsed when the aftershock hit. The worst disaster was the four-year-old, supposedly earthquake-proof, Wilson Plaza. The Army Corps of Engineers is rushing all available workers and equipment to the scene. Stand by for further bulletins. I've never been so afraid in my life. Well, you're safe now. We were lucky to get seats on this flight. A couple hours we'll be in Honolulu. I don't know if it's me or the drink, but I'm really getting sleepy. Why don't you take a nap. It'll do you good. Yeah. This is your captain. We have just received the latest news on the Los Angeles earthquakes. The big one that hit early this afternoon registered 9.9 on the Richter scale. Greater than the San Francisco quake in 1906, which registered 8.3. So far, the dam at the Hollywood reservoir, although damaged, is still intact. The dam has been under close and constant surveillance since the first earthquake that hit at 7:46 this morning. The aftershocks have been causing more damage. Hospitals and soup kitchens have been set up at various locations. As of now, it has been impossible to estimate the number of people injured or dead and the amount of damage. Wait just a minute, folks. The cards were right. What did you say? Oh, no, nothing. I'm just glad that we're both all right. Kathie, I want to talk to you seriously. Can it wait? No. Here's the latest from Los Angeles. The last aftershock has caused more building to collapse. One of these buildings was the Wilson Plaza, where a hospital has been set up in the sub-basement. The fate of the people trapped in the sub-basement is unknown at this time. As the news comes in, I'll keep you informed. I'm gonna leave you in Hawaii and go back to Los Angeles. Whatever for? To help, in any way I can. They're gonna need all the engineers they can get. But this is our honeymoon. Kathie, you're not thinking straight. We were almost victims of that earthquake ourselves. You're right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be selfish and unfeeling. I know you didn't. Can't you wait a few more days before you go back? No. Two days? No. One day? All right, one day. Oh, my God. Inspector! Inspector! Hold it. Stop. You can't go any farther. I'm a police officer, transporting injured people. Okay, come on. I'm sorry, lady, now you can't go... Officer, I've got to get to. It's urgent. Listen, listen. Mr. Graff, they're still down there. Remy and Mr. Royce. Denise, too. She asked for you. Where were they in the building? The third level below. Come on. I agree. There's a chance people could still be alive in the sub-basements. It'll take days to unearth all this debris. Look, the air supply can't last more than a few hours. I know the design of this building. I've been through it 100 times. The basement extends clear out to the street on this side. If the storm drain runs down deep enough, all you'd have to tunnel through is a couple of layers of concrete and a few feet of dirt. I got radio word a few minutes ago, that the Hollywood reservoir dam is disintegrating. We're on high ground here, but those drains are 40 feet down. Believe me, if the dam goes, they'll fill up in minutes. Dams have lasted for weeks with major breeches in them. It's too dangerous to try. Besides, the sewers must've cracked around like whips. You know, the eastern approach is totally blocked. Yeah, well, what about the other end? Well, I was just gonna call up an inspection team. Come and see for yourself. Let's go. Make way, fellas. Lou, where are you going? I'm going with them. Let's have a look. Can't you get through here? We don't know how far this opening runs. You haven't checked? My men stay here. That could cave in any second! Hey, you know as well as I do, the chances are 100 to one, that everybody in that building is dead. Holy mother! I got through. Can you get me a jackhammer and a bolt cutter? You use a jackhammer in there, the roof'll fall in. Look, I think there's some people alive in there, and I'm gonna try and get 'em out. Well, nobody else is. And you can't do it all alone. Yeah, I won't be alone. He's coming with me. Make sure they don't turn on the compressor for this hammer until we signal. Right. Any word from the dam? The last radio report we had, said no further cracks had appeared. Swell. Hey, you sure I can't talk you out of this insanity? Colonel, I really wish you could. Good luck. Watch your head. Keep it coming! I've paced it off. We ought to break through right about the third basement level. This thing ready? All right. The pressure's ready. Hold on. I'm getting outta here. Inspector! Inspector! Get the hell outta here! It's breaking up. Get out! Get out, get out! It's breaking up, get out! Should be a couple of feet of earth then just the basement wall. Hand me that light. We're through! Oh, my God! They're through! We're saved! Anybody in there? About 70 of us. Got it. Stewart. Denise. Come on, let's go. Be careful of the loose area down there. Easy, easy, easy. Careful of the loose stuff down there. No, not again. Oh God. It stopped, it stopped. Take it easy and watch your head down below. I got you, I got you. Take your time and watch it down there. That stuff is all loose. Give us a hand down here. Straight up. Straight up. Nice and easy. Okay. That's all of them. Let's go. Yeah. Watch it. Don't panic now. Women first! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Relax, there's lots of time. Take it easy, take it easy. Take it easy. One at a time, women first. Take it easy, take it easy. Don't panic. Go on, Remy. Wait, wait. Remy! Lou! Lou! I'm sorry to bring you more bad news. The dam has broken. At this very moment, it is destroying everything in its path. Los Angeles is being completely demolished. There is no hope. I think we should observe a few seconds of silent prayer for all those caught in this appalling catastrophe. As soon as we land, I'm gonna contact the Honolulu office of Royce Construction Company and offer them my services. Well, what if they refuse? They won't. If that happens, I'll find some way to get back and help. Well, I'm going with you. No, I think you'd be better off in Hawaii. A wife's place is with her husband. You mean that? That's the way I was brought up, and besides, I love you very much. Los Angeles has to be rebuilt. And I wanna be a part of it. Okay? You're the boss. This used to be a hell of a town, officer. Yeah. Thank God some of them made it., Sir, what's that there? What's that? Well, that's not the cuttlefish that I told you to look for. That's for a start. That is an insulator. Aye, an insulator, that is. Probably off a German battleship. I'm sure there's no German battleships coming here, sir. - You don't know, there might be. - No, Timmy's right. Now, tell me this. Why is there so much stuff around Killins Bay? It's a tide... Tidal eddy around the head. Tidal eddy. Very good, Tim. Good. All right, come on, now. Go on looking. The tide's going down. Go on, hurry up. Go on, Kathleen. Off with the others. You never know, you might find a diamond tiara. Sir, sir. Aye, that's a cuttlefish. - Good lad. - I'll try and find a bigger one. You do that, Tim. Come on. What is it, sir? No, it's nothing. Nothing. 'Tis all right, Kathy. Come on. Time we had lunch. We're eating at Barrow. It's a long way to Barrow, sir. Step off, then. That's where we're eating. Tide's coming in, sir. So it is. Hey, would you look at Michael? Michael. It's the Major. Hey, Tom, will you have a look at this? He's getting worse, you know. Michael, let's have a look at your V.C. - How many Germans did you kill, Michael? - All right. All right, very entertaining. Michael, you're a perfect fool. You ask for trouble. Come on, now, take the foolish things off. Michael, take them off, now. Come on. Michael! What's eating him? - What've you been doing? - Don't know, Father. We've not done anything. Come on now, Michael. What're you up to? Let go! Michael, let go, or I'll hit you. Michael, darling, let go. Major, darling, let me touch your V.C. You see, my husband hasn't got one. Well? Well. What was the meaning of that pantomime? I don't know. - Where have you been? - Riding... - with Major Doryan. - You're bold as brass. You think that's a suitable connection for a decent Irish wife? I think that is for my husband to say, Father Hugh. - You've told him, have you? - Yes. Yes, you would. Your husband would say anything you wanted, pretty well... because he loves you sorely, doesn't he? - Yes, he does. - Have you nothing to say to me? - What should I have to say to you? - You could say: ""Father Hugh, there's nothing between me and Major Doryan. "" - There isn't. - Say it, then. There is nothing between me and Major Doryan. Look at me, Rosy. Oh, child, what a face. - Rose, tell me now. - What? You'll have to tell it in confessional, you little fool. I don't have to come... - to the confessional. - Child! Child? - Father. - Hello, then. Rosy... was there something? No, I just... - Will you take the prayers, then? - Aye. ""Our Father... ""who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. ""Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done... ""on Earth as it is in heaven. ""Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses... ""as we forgive those who trespass against us. ""And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. "" In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. All right, children, off with you. Thank you, Father. Good day. Glad to help, Charles. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, I don't think so. Well, I'll be off home, too, then. - You're late. - I took them for a nature walk. Up Brandon? Along the shore. - For cuttlefish? - Aye. For cuttlefish. If you'd come up Brandon, we might have seen you. Why? - Did you go to Brandon? - Aye. I got some heather. So you did. You haven't been to the beach, then? No. Oh, well. - It's nice up Brandon. - Aye, it's grand. Is something the matter? I don't know, Rose. Is there? There's nothing the matter with me. Nothing's the matter, then. And the jam, and the... The jam... and the soap. Maggie. That'll be 18 pence. Could it wait to the end of the week, missus? Aye, to the end of the week. Not to the crack of doom. Thank you. - What was it, then? - I want a dishcloth, please. - I've none. - Oh. Then I'll just take some potatoes. Five pound. I've no potatoes, either. What's them, then? Aye, them. They're gone. I've no potatoes. Oh, I... I see. The way I see it, Mrs. Kenyon, there's loose women and there's whores... and then there's British soldiers' whores. - Coming up fast, Father. - Aye. Will you look at those things? You'd think they was announcing the coming of Christ. - Off you go! - Right. Put her down! Slowly does it. All right, now! That's it. Come on, Joe, there's a good lad. Come on, it's late. All right. Come on, Sean. Come on, Tom. You've got to go to sleep. Go on. Good night! Hello, Tom. - You? What are you doing here? - Come on, now, Tom. Phoenix Park, 1913. Tim O'Leary. Come on. Right, lads. Now, what do you usually do at this time, Tom? - I go to bed. - Right. This is Bernard. Go on up, lads. - Paddy. - Paddy. Sean. Joseph, Peter... Mr. O'Keefe. - And you know Pat. - Which room? At the back. But, Commandant, sir, what's happening? Guns, is it? - That's right, Tom. German guns. - German? Dynamite, grenades. All the stuff the movement needs. We tried to launch the boat... - You must get to them somehow, then. - We can't. But Sean here says there's a good chance some of it will break away and come to us. - Float in? - You're on to it. But, if it does, we won't know where. You can't see the nose on your face out there now. So we'll wait till daylight. - Absolute madness. - Will you shut up? Tom... if it's to be done in daylight, it's to be done quick. So we must have some fellows, say a dozen... good, strong fellows, and that's where you come in. - What if it don't break away? - Exactly. Then we'll wait one hour and go without it. One hour, Tom... and 12 strong men. That's all I'm asking. Can you do it? I could rout out a dozen, yes. - Do you want them now? - Not at all. The later they know we're here, the better. You let them lie till nearer morning. Can you find us something to eat? It's gonna be a long night. Paddy, Tom. Take the Constable his breakfast. Jesus and Mary, what a night. Now, do not make one sound, Constable. Right. You. Fat guts, get the handcuffs. - Where are they? - In the cupboard. Turn around. - I'm acting under duress. - Shut up. Put them on him. Open your mouth, Constable. Is that a telephone line? Cut it. Oh, God. Why have you done this to me? Hello? This is Ryan. - Did you cut the wire? - I did. You're doing well, Tom. - Where's the Constable? - In the cellar. We can put a bullet in him if you like. Constable... No! - Then get your men. - Aye, Commandant. Right. They've gone! Busted loose! It's no good, Commandant! Why don't you get up out of it while you can? Tim! - Hey, are you Tim O'Leary? - Yes, son, yes. Father, what the hell have you done this for? I didn't, they did! Well, do you know what you're doing? - Do you know what we've come for? - Aye. - Have you got it? - Well, look. - T'will be on the slabs. - Where? The slabs! Tim! Come on. Yes, Kathy? - Aren't you coming to the beach, sir? - The beach? Everyone's at the beach. - And why is everyone at the beach? - I don't know, sir. I think it's a wreck. A wreck? Now, that's enough, Tom. You're not as young as you used to be. Aye, come on! Oh, God. Pull! Right, up you get. You, too, Father. Up. Keep it going. That's right, darling. That's right. Hey! Dynamite. What are you doing here? - Why shouldn't I be? - Why? Thank you, ma'am. You know, we made speeches about these people... but, by God... Thanks. You're a man! Come on, then! One! Two! Three! Sean? - I must take a chance. - Aye. Good luck. Thank you. Get down, please. - Sergeant? - Sir. You, here. You. No. No trouble now, for your own sakes. O'Leary. That thing could kill a lot of people, Major. Sir? No. Go on. Run, Tim! Run, Tim. Make it, Tim. Come on! - Run. - O'Leary! Sir. - No! - No! - Murderer! - Don't shoot. What's wrong with the bastard? Boo! Shoot that slut, Shaughnessy. Careful, man. My God, they're a well-matched pair. All right, sir? - Got a cigarette? - Yes, sir. Is there anything you want? Cigarette. - Anything else? - Yes. Get out of my country. God bless you, Tim O'Leary! What are they going to do with them boys, Father? They'll hang them, dear. They'll hang them. Bastard! Bastard! Get out! You're very kind to me today. Am I? Yes. Why? Am I not usually kind to you? Yes, you are. Always. Charles, do you know or not? I know. - Since when? - The beginning. Don't lower your head, Rose. Why didn't you speak? I should have, shouldn't I? I don't know. It was easier not to, I suppose. I didn't want to know, you know. And then I thought, if I let you burn it out, the pair of you... you'd perhaps come back to me. Charles? Charles? Mr. Shaughnessy has been called away, so I'm taking class. What's the first lesson today, Danny? - Danny? - My father says not to speak to you, miss. - It's right then, he's not here? - No. I don't know where he is. - You mean he's gone off? - Yes. When? Last night. You had a row? I wasn't here. Where were you? Oh, I see. There's nothing I can do tonight, I'll find him in the morning. - If he turns up, you'll tell me. - Father? You'd better take his clothes. His clothes? He was in bed? Yes. You left his bed and went to... Rose. Oh, Rose. Come on, this isn't a picnic. All right, Corp, but there's nothing here. He's got something there, sir. Padre. Good morning, padre. I'm sorry, but what is it you have there, please? A man's clothes. I see. - And where are you taking them, Father? - To the man. Come on, padre. I don't suppose you mean any harm... but after the other day, we've got to be careful. What man? A man whose wife went off two nights back with her fancy fellow. And a man I've been looking for since dawn today. - A man- - Excuse me, sir. A man who must be half out of his mind to have gone off as he did, barefoot. That's right. Charles Shaughnessy. I think we're finished here, sir. Very well. - Hello, Charles. - Hello, Father. I've brought your clothes. Thanks, Father. I was wondering how I should get home. - And something to drink. - Thanks. - Yourself? - Aye, I will. - You seem all right, man. - Aye, more or less. Well, I'll get dressed now. Michael. He'll be after catching a few flounders. So, what have you been doing down here, Charles? Oh, thinking. About Rosy? About myself, mostly. Thanks for the clothes. You're a man in a million, Father Hugh. The children haven't come today, then? No. Rose, I have something to say to you. Come in. Sit down, will you? Rose, I thought I could stand by and let you two burn it out, like I said. But I find I can't. I'm not sure I ought to have tried, but anyway, I can't. So I'm going to leave you. - Very well. - Sit still a minute, Rose. What about you? You and him? - Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? It's over. Was that because I went and stayed away? No. It's over. - Have you told him? - No. He doesn't know, then? Yes, he knows. How? He must. You're as close as that, are you? We were, yes. Rose, you must tell me the truth. Do you think you're ever gonna forget him? Of course not. He'd be like a ghost about the place. Rose, am I right? Yes, you're right. It's busted, Charles. I busted it. Now, have you thought what to do? - No. - Well, I have. I don't think either of us can stay in this village any longer. No. It's time I moved on anyway. And you were never worse suited here. I've reckoned up, I've got about 200 pounds. Take all this, without the gramophone, fetch another 50. We'll split it down the middle. I can't do it. We're not enemies, Rose. Stop that! There's to be none of that. But why must it be Rosy? Because she was fornicating with the fellow. So, you're back, are you? What is this? What do you want? - Not you. - Well, then get out. - Go on, get out. - Shut up, Shaughnessy. We're waiting for her. You. You've been tried and found guilty. You're the informer. - What? - Busting at the seams with innocence. Joe, for God's sake, don't hurt her, Joe. Don't hurt her. If she was a man, Mr. Ryan, she'd be shot. - What is this? - Listen, numbskull. Someone that morning went up to the camp... and betrayed Tim O'Leary. Now, who lives near enough? Who had time enough? Who would? Who did? That bitch you call your wife. String her up! But anyone could have, if anyone did. The whole village was abroad. No. The village was down on the beach. - Except you. - You came late. - We came together. We spoke to no one. - You'd say that, of course. Young Kathy was with us. Young Kathy would say black was white if you told her. Then anyone, anyone at all could've gone into the police station... - and used the telephone. - That's where you're wrong. They couldn't. Could they, Tom? - No. - Why not? Because Tom went in there himself and cut the wire. Didn't you, Tom? Well, you went in there yourself, didn't you? - Yes. - And you cut the wire, didn't you? Yes. Well, what do you say now? Nothing. Take her out. No, you're taking her nowhere. Stop it! - Informer. - There she is! Hold him. Take him by the hands. Quiet! Get back! Get back! Do it. Princess... What is it? There she is. Look here, Father Hugh, the stripping of her was an accident. Steady, Joe. You're taking advantage of your cloth, Father Hugh. - That's what it's for. - Come on, Joe. It's not right. A priest is only a man. Go on. Go on, Michael, get off. Get off out of it! Hello. Keep it. What? They really thought... I was the one who betrayed that man. Rose... I don't for one moment suppose that anyone betrayed him. Why should they? They just... They just wanted it so, that's all. And they wanted it to be you, too. For other reasons. Truth was told, they envy you. They always have. They've always had a rare, old contempt for me, too. I tell you, I'm not for letting any of that lot know we've busted up. We'll just keep up a front until I'm well and out of it. What? I don't know. It just seemed funny, that's all. Michael, give that to me. All right, keep it. I thought we were friends. That one, too. Give it to me. No! Look. For Christ's sake, man, I'm not going to hurt you. - It'll be the soldiers. - Soldiers? Aye. The beach was fairly littered with stuff. They'll be destroying it. Oh, yes. Come on, lads, pick them up. What about my blisters, Corporal? - Well, they're not mourning long. - No. Does she think he killed himself deliberate? She says... I think he was a man who suffered, Father Hugh. You love her sorely, don't you, Charles? Yes. - Ready, then? - Yes. It's not all your doing, Rosy. I should not have married you. No. You can tell Father Hugh that we're parting if you like. No. - Rosy. - Father. It'll be a fair day for the journey, yet, I think. I hope so, yes. Well, now, how shall we manage? Margaret. Come here, Margaret. Come here. Kathy, come in. Kathy, will I take the belt to you? Take my arm. A rousing sendoff. We'll be out of it in five minutes. Dad. Goodbye, Dad. Bye, princess. I'm all right. - Are you, darling? - Aye. I'm looking forward to Dublin and that. Really. That's your mother speaking. - Do you remember your mother, Rose? - A bit. Do you, like... - remember the rows? - Aye. - I never raised a fist to her, Rose. - I know that, Dad. You wouldn't hurt a fly if you could help it. - I'll write to you. - And I'll write to you. - Well, maybe. - No. I swear to God, Rose. - I will write every... Every- - All right, Dad. We'll both write regular. Bye-bye. Well, wait a minute, I must say goodbye to your husband. You know, Rose... when you married him, I thought you could have done a lot better. Now I'm not so sure they come much better. Would you tell him that? It's not a thing one fellow can easily say to another. Shaughnessy. Mike. Goodbye, Shaughnessy. Goodbye, Mr. Ryan. Are you all right for money, you two? I have a bit by me. We're fine for money, Dad. Thanks. Goodbye. Good luck. - Get out and don't come back! - Get out! Informer. Bus will be here in a minute. It's brightened for you, like I said. Aye. Grand day for a journey. Sign of good luck. Thanks. Bus is coming. You won't have an address in Dublin yet, I suppose. No, Father, we... I've wrote down here the name and address of a decent woman... who'll ask six shillings a week for a dry room and a clean bed. Six shillings, the pair of you. You'll not do better than that, not in Dublin. No, I don't suppose so. Thanks, Father. Bye, Michael. I have a parting gift for you here, Rose. It's supposed to be a fragment of St. Patrick's staff. I don't suppose it is, though. God bless you, child. Come on, now. Come on, get on up. I'll help you load up. Thanks, Father. Thanks for a great many things. Charles? I think you have it in your mind that you and Rosy ought to part. Yes, I thought as much. Well, maybe you're right, maybe you ought, but I doubt it. And that's my parting gift to you. That doubt. God bless. I don't know. I don't know at all. Come on, Michael., Hiya, Tony. Two or three? Two. Two. Give me two. That's good. Hey, you guys do layaway? As long as it don't turn into a 20-year mortgage. All right, look, put me down for $5 for that blue shirt in the window. - Hold it for me. - Hey, wait for your receipt. - I trust you. - Please don't. Don't trust me. - What did he charge you? That bastard. Wait till he runs out of something. Listen, you know what to tell her. Excuse me, ma'am, I gotta get by. - Got a second? - Just a minute. Look what I got for you, Carnival, gold, just like you wanted. Where have you been? I've been here for a half hour. That's all right. Look, I'm gonna make you a deal on this paint. - I'm very angry with you. - That's all right. Look, I'm gonna make you a nice deal on this. $1 off for you. $10.98 on this special gold paint. - How you like that? - Thank you. - I'll take a gallon of this. - All right. You got it. Heads up. That's all right. Customers like that, it gives them a sense of power. I need some brushes. All right, how much painting you planning to do? After these two rooms, I wouldn't paint my wife's ass purple. What color is it now? You wanna know what color my wife's ass is? You brung it up. Actually, it ain't got no color, just stripes, them stretch stripes. What about them brushes? Right. See that second display counter? Over there. - Hey, Mr. Fusco, can I get an advance? - Payday's Monday. I know payday is Monday, but every place else is Friday or Saturday. And they're broke on Monday. - Boozing, whoring... - Oh, come off it. Pissing away their money all weekend. This way, you're paid on a Monday, you got money all week. - You can save a little, build a future. - Oh, fuck the future. No, Tony, you can't fuck the future, the future fucks you. It catches up with you, and it fucks you if you ain't planned for it. Look, tonight is the future, and I am planning for it. There's a shirt I gotta buy, a beautiful shirt. Blue... Sorry, Tony, no exceptions. Just wait till you need an advance, all right? Big shot. Hey, come on. Thanks, Tony. Where you been? Your mother wants to know where you been. Where you been? Your father's asking you! Where you been? Dinner's gonna be late tonight, they was out of things at the market. But you'd have been late if it was normal. - Hey, Tony. - Hey, hot stuff. Give me a kiss. - Look what I made for you. Here. - Oh, that is beautiful. - You like it? - Yeah. You'll put it in your room? Yeah, I'll put it in my room right now, how's that? - Okay. - All right. - Dinner's on the table. - I ain't hungry. Hey, just because you're kicking in for food, don't mean you don't gotta eat. You still gotta eat. - I got my shirt on, all right? - So? So, I don't want to get anything on it, that's what. You got nothing to be afraid of. Your mother's spaghetti sauce don't drip. It don't taste and it don't drip. Let's go. How come every day it's the same thing? I come home, you tell me I'm late for dinner when you know that I gotta work till 6:00 and I can't make dinner on time. You should've been a priest, like your brother, you wouldn't worry about a job. Yeah. Every time you mention Frank, Jr., you gotta cross yourself? He's a priest, ain't he? Father Frank, Jr., your brother. Your mother doesn't have much to cross herself about these days. You're so jealous of Frank, Jr. - Oh, shut up, will you? - Hey! - What are you doing? - Hey, the shirt! Watch the shirt, stupid. - Basta! - All right. Come on. - Mangia, mangia. - Yeah, go ahead. Eat, eat. I got more pork chops, more spaghetti. What do you mean, you got more pork chops? I'm out of work. Yeah, well, as long as we got $1 left, we eat good in this house. - What? - Yeah, I might even get a job myself. Like hell, you will. Twenty-five years in construction work, I always brought home a paycheck. What, six, seven months I'm out of work? Then, all of a sudden, what? - You're hitting me and talking back. - All right, all right. Talking about getting a job and hitting me. All right, all right. No hitting, no slapping at the dinner table. Okay? That's the rule. And you was the one that was hitting. You never hit me before. Never. Not in front of the kids. - One pork chop! One! - Hey, Frank! It's disgusting, Ma. He's sick. Will you just watch the hair? You know, I work on my hair a long time and you hit it. He hits my hair. Take care of his hair. I'm gonna take a walk. Tony, you walk me to church later? Didn't you go already today? Yeah, confession. I gotta go back and pray for something. For what? I gotta pray for Father Frank, Jr. To call me. Why don't you call him direct? I want him to call me. A son should call his mother. Wait a minute. You're going to church to have God make Frank, Jr. Call you? - Right. - I don't believe it. You know, you're turning God into a telephone operator. Go, go, now! Hey, you scumbags! Get back here! - Assholes. - Come on, fuckhead! Hey, the stubborn fuck won't budge. - Will you put two hands on the wheel? - I got two hands on the wheel! Hey, you know, you assholes almost broke my pussy finger. Oh, yeah, you wouldn't know which one it was. Hey, get some of this, will you? Hey, Gus, tell them what we got. Oh, yeah, we got some ups, we got some downs, three ludes, two Js, and a half a bottle of vodka. All right, yeah, yeah! That's what you got, huh? I bet I'd get a bigger high from a fart. - You want something? - No. We ain't dropping nothing till I say so. - Oh, come on. Why the fuck not? - Hey, bullshit. I got my reasons, all right? I got my reasons. Oh, fuck, Tony. What's wrong with you, man? Hey, give me the vodka. Hey, when're you gonna get new tapes? These things are four years old. I bought them in the bargain basement. You don't like my tapes? I'll get new tapes. Hey, looking sharp, huh? Sharp as you can look without turning into a nigger. - Or a spic. - Spic, spic. Would you put your dick in a spic? - Does it get bigger in a nigger? - I don't know. I gotta score tonight, man. I'm horny, you know what I mean? Horny. Yeah, man, I know what you mean. Horny, right? Horny! Hey, anybody scores, you get in the car for 10 minutes, and you're out for the next guy, all right? If you get five, you get a medal of honor with rubies, and a piece of the Pope's ass. What are you talking about, man? The Pope don't got no ass, that's why he's the Pope. Now, shape up, you assholes. We're the faces. Tony, how's it going? All right? Hey, Moe! Hey, Tony, you seen Pauline around here at all? No, we ain't seen Pauline. Joey, you seen Pauline? Hi. What would you like? - Oh, give me a Seven and Seven. - Yeah, I'll take a beer. Hey, I'd like a vodka and tonic. You guys wanna go see the Knicks on Tuesday? Anybody? - Give me a... - Wanna see the Knicks? Tony. - Yeah. - What do you mean, ""yeah""? Well, I mean, I could dance with you, but, you know, you're not my dream girl or nothing like that. You want a dream girl? Well, then go to sleep and have a nightmare. Hey, Gus, here's the speed. What are you doing? Here, take this. Hello, again. This is beautiful Monti, your delicious deejay, reminding you about the Universal Disco sweepstakes, so get in line to get the prize. - Oh, looks good! - Go, baby. A trip. A good trip. Feel the music, baby. Look at that chick. I'm gonna dance with her. Which one? Come on, Tony! Dance! All right! It's so beautiful in there. I like your new haircuts. I like that polyester look. Turn yourself there, baby. All right! Yeah! Hey, Tony, you know something? You're the king out there. You're great. You're a great dancer. You could do as good as me if you practiced. Yeah? Think I'd be a good dancer, Tony? Sure. Why not? No. - No? - No. - Ain't you gonna ask me to sit down? - No, you'd do it. - But you'd ask me to lay down. - No, you would not do it. Double J, move over. I want you to meet my friend here. Hey. Hey, Tony, listen, you want some speed? It's very good stuff, Ton. Really, it's good stuff. You want some? Can't you guys get off on dancing? Tony, can I wipe off your forehead? Why not? Sure. Go ahead. Hey, Doreen, it ain't no blowjob. You don't know fuck about women, Joey. You get a blowjob easier than you get that. I noticed. I love to watch you dance, Tony. - Oh, yeah? - I love it. I love to watch you dance. I just love it, watching you dance. Hey, Tony, listen, do her a favor. Why don't you take her for a dance, huh? That's a good idea. Wanna dance? Would you like to dance with me? I'd dance with you. It's for charity. Any kind of dresses with the lace on the side. Weirdest chick I ever seen. Ton, I love to watch you dance. I just love it, watching you dance. Doreen, move up a little bit. Come on, doll. She's doing a two-step with him. Jesus Christ. Get your head out of his belt, there, doll. Oh, Jesus. You can't dance to this shit. - Let's get the fuck out of here. - I paid $5 to hear this shit? You paid $5? I fucking paid for you to get in. Hey, Monti, what are you playing that shit for? What are you talking about, baby? Look at that chick, she's dancing, man. She's grooving. - Joey? - Yeah. You know that girl? No. - You ever see her before? - No. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I seen her here about a month ago. She can dance, you know that? She got the wrong partner, of course, but she can dance. - Go ask her. - Fuck you. Yeah? Which position? Who the hell's that guy? - Hey, Penny. - Hey, Tony! - How you doing? - Okay. How you been? All right. You gonna dance for me? - Sure, why not? - Okay. - Hello, Lucille. - Hello, Nureyev. How you doing? - You got a Seven and Seven for me? - Sure, doll. Give me one of your butts, too, all right? Sure. Having another sweepstakes. I know that. It's double the prize money. $500. You gonna enter? Well, you'll need a partner. We won before. But we're gonna have to practice. We'll have to practice. They got people coming in from Manhattan. Revelation, Gazebo's. You know that, right? We'll have to practice. That's ""practice,"" Annette. It don't mean dating, it don't mean socializing, it means practice. Why not? We had a date. Yeah, once, and once was enough. Why? Why? Annette, the whole time, you talked about your married sister. And then, you was talking about your other married sister. And then, your third married sister. I got the idea that all you was interested in was being a married sister yourself. I got bored with it. Hey, look, I told you I'd take care of it, huh? Hey, Tony, look, Double J's been in the car 25 minutes with some chick. So what? So, I can't get the selfish prick out. These guys can't do nothing without me, you know that? Hey, listen, are you gonna make it with Annette? No, I don't think so. You know, Joey, you make it with some of these chicks, and they think you gotta dance with them. Look at this guy, huh? All right, get out. You've been in there 20 minutes. - Come on! - 25 in the car, 20 in the chick. Yeah, well, get out before we pull you out. - She ain't come yet. - Since when do you care? Hey, come on! Whoa. Okay. - Harder! Harder! - Okay, it's happening! It's happening! It's happening! I'll be out in a minute, man. Harder! I'm coming! I'm coming! Oh, yeah! Yes. What did you say your name was? Kiss me. Kiss me! Oh, I just kissed Al Pacino! Al Pacino. I don't look like Al Pacino. Well, I could look like him. Al Pacino. Yeah. Al Pacino. Al Pacino! ""Attica! Attica! ""Attica! Attica! - ""Attica!"" - Hey, give me the ball. Hey, you wanna go see that Bruce Lee picture at the Orpheum? - Yeah! - Hey, you wanna know something? Bruce Lee's dead, so I don't give a damn about him. - Hey, look. - Man, you got no respect for the dead. What kind of shit is that, huh? Hey, you guys see what the Knicks are gonna pay Frazier? We're never gonna make that much money in our whole life. - Hey, douche! Douche! - It's all right. It's okay. Hey, you know why you don't kill fags on Sunday? You kill fags on Sunday, they go straight to heaven. Hey, sweetheart! Hey, your turn, isn't it? You look so heavenly, it makes me want to die, you know? Hey, Double J, hey! You know, this is a drag. What's with you today, huh? Nothing. I'd just rather be doing 2001 tonight. Yeah? Well, fucking do it. Oh, ""fucking do it."" 20, 30 bucks, asshole! You got 20, 30 bucks to blow twice a week? - Come on, Tony. - Hey, Tony. Man, I'm gonna get myself one of these, you know. You're never gonna get yourself one of these. These things cost too much money. You'll never have that kind of money. Hey, you, you know, I've had you up to here. That's your favorite speech. You're never gonna have that kind of money. Not you, not me, not anybody. Hey, get it together before it's all over the street, huh? You see this? This is a Caddy Seville. My Uncle Nunzio's got one of these and he's got a Mercedes Benz, too. You know how he got it? He forced his partner to sell out. He gave him a real screwing. It's a dog-eat-dog world, right? Everybody's out for what they can get. It's true. They got it all locked up. Ain't nobody gonna give you a chance. Nobody gives you nothing, Joey. Yeah, you know, it's every man for himself. It's a stinking rat race. Hey, that stuff goes on beautiful, Tony. Best vinyl I ever seen at that price. See? I told you. You just listen to me, right? You know, you saved me a bit of change on the job. You know paint. You ever want a job as a painter, why don't you let me know, huh? You make twice as much as you make here, but you break your back. You interested? - I don't know. - Don't be interested. You'll make twice as much, but you'll break your back. - No advances, no nothing. It's payday... - I gave you a raise. - You gave me what? - A raise. - You kidding me? - No. Come on, look. See how much it is. You gave me a raise? Thank you. I can't believe this. Wait, hold on, you better look first. I don't gotta look. It don't make no difference. You gave me a raise. That's the important thing. - It's only $2.50. - So what? That's $2.50. It ain't much. The important thing is it's a raise. I think that's really great. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna give you $3.50, all right? - You do not have to, Mr. Fusco. - I'll give you $3.50. - I like the raise just the way it is. - I'll give you $1 more. Shut up, will you? $4. I'll make it an even $4. Christ, I've never seen anybody so shit-ass happy over a crummy $2.50 raise. Wait a minute. $2? You just said $4.00, didn't you? What the hell are you doing? - I just feel like it, all right? - Girls do that. I got a raise today. How do you like that? Yeah? Why didn't you say so during dinner? We could've used the conversation. Put them down. Come here. - How much you get? - It's gonna be $4.00. It was... It was $2.50, right? But he raised the raise when he found out I wasn't so, you know, disappointed. - Yeah. Shit. You know what $4.00 buys today? It don't even buy $3.00. I don't see nobody giving you a raise down at Unemployment. $4.00. Shit. I knew you'd piss on it. Go on, just piss on it, right? A raise says, like, you're good, you know what I mean? You know how many times somebody told me I was good in my life? Two. Two. Twice. Two fucking times, this raise today and dancing, dancing at the disco. You sure as fuck never did. Asshole. $4.00. Shit. Why ain't you waiting inside? Well, I wanted to watch you come down the street. I like the way you walk. Shit. Tony, listen, I've been thinking. Maybe I'll make it with you. That's what you call thinking, huh? Jesus Christ. You know what? You're too much, Annette. You know that? I mean, you say we're gonna make it, that means we're gonna make it, right? I mean, like, I got no say in this at all, right? It's time we went out. You told me you wanted to do it. You told me how horny a man gets when he's 19, how much his balls ache morning, noon and night, six days a week, sometimes seven, if he don't get it. How do you remember those things? Look, Annette, we're gonna be spending a lot of time together, you know, rehearsing, practicing, whatnot. If we was balling, it would be like we was going together. And I won't be going with you. Look, I mean, what are you, anyway? You a nice girl or you a cunt? I don't know. Both? You can't be both. I mean, that's a thing a girl's gotta decide early on. You gotta decide whether you're gonna be a nice girl or a cunt. - How you doing, Pete? - Hey, Tony, my man. - You got a studio free or what? - Yeah, two is free. - Good. Hey, how you doing? - Steady at 65%. Pete. He's always busting my onions. I send him a lot of customers, you know. He gives me free studio time when... What did he mean, 65%? Oh, that... Oh, that means that he... He scores with 65% of the chicks that come in here. And one, two, three, two, two, three. One, two, one, two, three. One, two, three. Good. Two, two, three. Good. One, two, one, two, three. Good, that's it. Now do it again. That's it, good. All right. All right. Again. Tony, it's only dancing. Jesus. Only dancing? Forget it, Annette. If you're not gonna take this seriously, I don't wanna dance. - Don't get mad. - ""Don't get mad."" Jesus. Look, I think we done enough dancing for today. So, why don't we... Why don't we dance Wednesday, all right? Yeah. Sure. - All right. Here. - You walking home now? No. I'm gonna stick around and talk to Peter a little bit, and, you know, work on some stuff myself. - I'll see you later, all right? - Yeah. You was good today. Hi. How you doing? Hey, you know, you're a very good dancer, you know that? I would like to meet you. Look, would you... Would you mind just going away, okay? - What? - Don't be hurt, but I... Don't be hurt? Yeah, I wanna be by myself now, you know? Listen, I seen you at 2001 the other night. Yeah, so? So? Well, I mean, you was looking at me and I was looking at you, remember? Well, what is this? I look at a guy longer than a millionth of a second, already, he gets delusions of grandeur. You know what you are? I'm gonna tell you what you are. I bet it begins with a ""C,"" Mr. P. Oh, fine. Fine. That's... I know the type. I know the type. Fine. What you doing up so late? What is this? I walk in, you don't got no criticism of me? - Your brother's upstairs. - You're kidding. - Yo, Frankie! - Tony. - Hey, how you doing? - Hiya, kid. - It's good to see you. - You, too. Yeah. You look good. No, I don't. You do. You look wonderful. - You checking out my trophy? - Oh, yeah. That's you, huh? - Yeah. - ""First prize."" Looks just like you. Hey, what did you say to them downstairs? They look crazy, they look like zombies, like... Like somebody died or something. I think they're in shock, Tony. In shock? Well, how come they're in shock? I'm leaving the church, Tony. Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure. Leaving the church. - Tell me another one. - I'm leaving the priesthood. Oh, come on, Frank. Don't fool around like that. Do you think I'm losing my hair? It looks awful thin right over here and here. Are you serious? Can I borrow some of your clothes until I buy some? I don't want to wear the uniform. I'm sorry, Frank. I really am. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? You got fired, huh? I didn't get fired. I quit. You quit? Yeah, you can do those things, you know. What did Mom say? What did she say about it? She said, ""Dear Lord, what am I gonna tell Theresa and Marie?"" - And Dad? What did he say about it? - They're ashamed, the both of them. They're ashamed, right? You ashamed of me, Tony? Yeah, you are. - They didn't ask why or nothing? - No. I think they're afraid to. Like, I might say, ""celibacy."" But... You gonna sleep here tonight? You wanna sleep in my room? - Yeah, I thought I would. - All right, you can... I'll get your blankets for you. Frank, how come you left? Really? It's not easy to explain, Anthony. A lot of things. One day, you look at a crucifix, and all you see is a man dying on a cross. But that's only a backdrop to something else. Mama and Papa, their dreams of pious glory. They turn you into what they wish at a time... You can't defend yourself against their fantasies. All I ever really had any belief in was their image of me as a priest. That's all. Guess we're gonna have to take your picture down from the mantle. Know what's weird? Like, I always felt like I was the shit of the family, and you was always, like, perfect. Now that I'm the disgrace to the family, I'm not so perfect anymore. So, maybe you're not shit anymore. Yeah, maybe if you ain't so good, I ain't so bad, you know? Yeah. Ha. - Give me the groceries, motherfucker. - Hey, come on. - Hey, don't take my groceries, man. - I'm hungry. - I'm hungry, Gus. - Hey, what are you doing? Hey, come on! Hey, come on! Hey, don't eat the apple! - Give me... Give me it back. - Here. Jesus. What's the matter with you anyway? What are you doing? What are you doing? My brother, he quit the Church. You believe that? - Yeah? - I feel... I feel wild. I got all this energy. I can't believe it. Yeah? Hey, listen, I'll call you later tonight, all right? Yeah, we'll do... Hey! - See you later, Gus. - I'll see you. Come on, honey, higher with the arms. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, do it to me! Pete, she come in? I told you on the phone, she comes in on Tuesday. - I know. So, did she come in or what? - And what is it today, huh? - It's Tuesday. - Yeah. Hey, Ton! Watch it, man. That one's practicing to be a bitch. Come on, people! Good, yeah. Oh, that's good. You're doing great. Yeah. Hello, Stephanie Mangano. I'm Tony Manero. We both got the same last initials. How do you like that? Wow. We get married, I don't have to change the monogram on my luggage, huh? Somebody told me you was practicing to be a bitch. Is that true? All right, Mr. Manero. What do you want to ask me? I would like to take you out to coffee. Would that be good? That's it, huh? You want me to have coffee with you? I think you're a very good dancer. You know that 2001 Odyssey, they got a dance contest now. And I think that we could be a dynamite team together. - How old are you, huh? - I'm 20. Well, I'm 19 at the moment, but I'll be 20 very shortly. What I think is this. There's a world of difference between us, you know? Not just chronologically, but emotionally, culturally, physically, every which way. And this world would get much bigger and much worse with every passing week. What kind of shit is that? - Coffee, not sex. - Just coffee, huh? See, look, where I work, the people are very remarkable. They're not like these here Bay Ridge people at all. You mean snobs instead of slobs, right? - What? - Nothing. Hey, you know, Bay Ridge ain't the worst part of Brooklyn. You know what I'm talking? I mean, you know, it ain't like a hellhole or nothing. Yeah, well, it ain't Manhattan. It isn't Manhattan. You got no idea how it changes, you know. Just right over there, right across the river, everything is different, completely different. It's beautiful, just beautiful. The people are beautiful, offices are beautiful. The secretaries, you know, they all shop at Bonwit Teller. Oh, yeah? And, like, the lunch hours are beautiful, too. Like, you know, they'll give you, like, two hours for lunch - to do something that's related. - Oh, yeah? Like we've seen Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet. Over here. Romeo and Juliet, yeah? I read that in high school. That's... That's Shakespeare, right? No, it's Zeffirelli, the director of the movie. - You know, the movie? Film. - Yeah. You know what? What I never understood about that Romeo and Juliet, I never understood why Romeo, he took the poison so quick, you know? I feel like he could have waited or something. Well, that's the way they took the poison in those days. Hey, you gonna eat? Here, look at a menu. No, no. I'll just have tea. Tea with lemon. I started drinking tea recently, you know. It's really a lot more refined. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. All those women executives in my office, they all drink tea with lemon. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. And you notice that I do, too. - I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee. - Yeah. You see, like, I've only been at this agency a really short time, but already I'm functioning in a, kind of, public relations capacity, you know. I fill in for the agents when they're elsewhere. Like, this week, you know, I had... I had business lunches with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque - and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal. - Oh, far out. Yeah. You heard of those restaurants, huh? No, I don't know those exact restaurants. I know the type. Yeah, but you must have heard of the artists. No, I... Not... I don't know... You know. Not really. So what did you say ""far out"" for, huh? 'Cause it sounded, like, far out. Wasn't it? I mean... - Well, yeah. - We'd like a lemon with some tea now. And I'd like a cheeseburger and some coffee. Hey, you know who came in the office the other day? - Who? - Laurence Olivier. Who's that? Who's Laurence Olivier? You don't know who he is? Laurence Olivier, man! He's the greatest actor in the whole world. Oh, come on, you know who he is. He's the English actor, the one on television who does all those Polaroid commercials. You know, Laurence Olivier. - Oh, him. Oh, he's good. He is good. - Yeah. Well, anyway, he comes in the office, right? So, I just do a few errands for him. So, he goes around, he tells everybody in the entire office, he says I'm the brightest, I'm the most vivacious thing in the entire office he's seen in years. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Do you think that you could get, like, a camera from him at a discount? I didn't ask him about a camera. 'Cause you got one already, right, you sly fox, you. Hey, look, are you enjoying all this stuff I'm telling you? Sure. I think it's good. Well, I just think maybe you can't handle hearing about a kind of life that is so completely different than yours. - You mean ""better,"" don't you? - Yes, I mean better. Sure, it's better. Can I have some ketchup, please? I mean, I'm out of this scene almost completely, you know, this Bay Ridge scene. I'm moving into Manhattan. I'm getting my own apartment. I'm changing. I'm really changing as a person, and I'm growing. You know what I mean? Nobody has any idea how much I'm growing. Why don't you go on a diet? Okay, listen. I like you. We could dance together. That's it. We could just dance together and nothing more. Nothing personal. I don't want you coming on to me. Why not? Because I don't date guys like you anymore, for one thing. You're too young, you haven't got any class, and, yeah, I'm sick of jerk-off guys ain't got their shit together! Oh, come on. It's easy to get your shit together. All you need is a salad bowl and a potato masher. Get your shit together. - Would you like to know what I do? - It's not necessary. I'll tell you what I do. I work in a paint store, and I got a raise this week. Right. You work in a paint store, right? You probably live with your family, you hang out with your buddies, and on Saturday night you go, you blow it all off at 2001, right? - That's right. - You're a clich. You're nowhere, on your way to no place. What do you got? A fucking stairway to the stars or what? - Yeah, maybe. - Yeah. I'm taking a course, nights, at the new school. Next semester, I'm gonna take two. Now, you, you probably didn't get no college, did you? No, I did not. Well, did you ever think about going to college? - No. - Not ever? - No. Did you? - Well, not back then, no... Then why the fuck are you bugging me about it for? Well, why not? Why didn't you ever want to go to college? - Oh, just fuck off, will you? I did not. - No, really. Tell me. Why not? Oh, Jesus Christ! I didn't! The thing is the high I get at 2001 is just dancing, it's not being the best or nothing like that. The only thing is that I would like to get that high someplace else in my life. You know? Like where? I don't know where. I don't know. Someplace. You see, dancing, it can't last forever. It's a short-lived kind of thing. But I'm getting older, you know. You know, I feel like... I feel like, you know, so what, I'm getting older. Does that mean, like, I can't feel that way about nothing left in my life? You know? Is that it? Listen, we gotta split here. No, I'll walk you the rest of the way. No, I'll meet you at the dance studio, just like we said, okay? Stephanie, I can walk you home. Look, nothing personal, right? Oh, come on, Stephanie. I can walk you. Oh, Jesus Christ! You know? I don't know where he is. - Did you call him? - No. What's the matter? What's going on? It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital. The spics got him. - Spanish Barons? - Barracudas. - Hey, that's my fucking car! - Forget the car! - Save it for the spics. - Just give me the keys. - You're asking for it. - I can't believe it. I just saw him. He could have run, you know? But he hung tight. That's Gus. Don't worry about it. Okay? All right? I got in the hospital to see him. He got a broken nose, busted ribs, a broken leg and four teeth knocked out. Shit. I mean, all he was doing was walking along the street carrying his groceries, and three of them do a shove number on him. They spill his fucking groceries into the street. So, he says under his breath, ""grease balls, spic dicks,"" and they laid into him. All right. Go check it out. Nobody in there, man. All right, all right. This is what we're gonna do. We're just gonna cruise around until there's enough of them that we can handle. Yeah, yeah, we'll just pick off a couple on the street. - That's pussy, man! - Fuck, man. Fuck. - You're fucked up! - I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're sorry. Oh, forget it. We'll get them tomorrow. All right, dream good. Jerk off better. Tony, I'm getting married. Will you cut it with that shit? No, listen. I just wanted to let you know, all right? All right. Look. If you get married, we'll all go with you on your honeymoon, all right? - You will? Okay. - Okay, good. Take it easy. Come on, Bobby. Get in the car. Hey. Hey, you know, we should go to the hospital tomorrow. You know what I'm talking? And you, cool off! You know? All right. Good night. Tony, what did you say to Father Frank, Jr.? - What? - What did you say? What did you do? Yeah, what did you say? - What are you talking about? - You must have said something to him. You sleep in the same room. You talk to him. The next night he stays out all night, he don't come back. - I said nothing to him. - A priest staying out all night. A priest is not a priest no more, and he's grown up, so he can do what he wants. Something you said to him. Oh, yeah? You try and blame me now he ain't a priest no more? You been writing to him. I don't believe this. You're trying to hang this on me? Forget it, all right? He called. He called. He called. In a couple of days he's gonna see he's wrong. He's going through, like, a trial of the soul, you know? He's going back to the church. He's going back. No, he won't. He's not going back to the church. Yes he is. He's going back to the church! I'm telling you, he's going back! You know what? You don't got a priest no more! And you got no saint! You got nothing but three shit children now! Good. Good. No. I'm sorry, Mom. I just... I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'll never say that. I love you, Mom. I really do. Go on. Get out of here. - How you doing, Annette? - Okay. - That's good. - Yeah. Hey, listen, look, Annette. I gotta tell you something, all right? It's very hard to tell you this, but... I changed my mind about us dancing together. I got another partner. Look, it's professional. You know what I mean? It's like... Things like this happen when it's professional. Oh, Jesus Christ. My fucking mother, now you. Why do you hate me so much? All I ever did to you was like you. Give me a break, huh? Hi. You're late. Five minutes. That's not late. How long you been here? I don't know. Six, seven, something like that. Pete said you been here 15. Well, who's he? Hey, I got some records over here. I don't know if you like them or not. - You like these guys? - Yeah, yeah. Super. Do you do the New York hustle, the Latin hustle, what? - New York, Latin, I do it all. - Okay. Follow me this time. Yeah, that's really nice. What'd you do, make that up? Yeah. Yeah. No, I saw it on TV first. Then I made it up. Hey, you know what? I know this one. What I do is... Wait a minute. This is simple. Let me just check something out. - Come on. Come on. - What you doing? Okay, stay right there. Now we can dance. Let me show you the step, okay? The Latin one I was gonna show you, okay? Now, take your hand like this, and count one, two, three. Two, two, three. Three, two, three, kick, two, three. - Okay, I got that. - Okay? - Looks good. - All right. - That's good. I like that. - Yeah. - Do you know the tango hustle? - Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's try that. - Would you like some coffee? - Yeah. No, no. Look, I really gotta go home. You know something? I like you when you're like this. When you're quiet and you ain't laying all that shit on me and everything. Oh, yeah? Well, as a matter of fact, guess who I had lunch with today? Paul Anka. I had to open my big mouth, right? It was very interesting. Very interesting. Very interesting. Very, very intelligent fellow. You cream over that word, ""interesting,"" don't you? - Well, what's wrong with ""interesting""? - I don't know, something. You know, I want to tell you something. I've never told you this before, but I think you're full of shit. - Oh, you do, do you, huh? - Yeah, except I'm not sure. I'm not sure how much is just shit and how much is bullshit. Well, listen, when you figure it out, just let me know, all right? We should really practice a couple more times. Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd. How about Saturday? Would that be good? Maybe. Stephanie, I wanna ask you something, all right? I don't know how to say this. Do you think that I am either interesting or intelligent? Interesting? Yeah. Yeah. Intelligent? I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. I gotta know you better. You know what I mean? You got a way of putting things together, you know? Seeing things a certain way. Interesting? Yeah, yeah. Intelligent? Yeah, maybe. Maybe intelligent. Well, what do you know? All right. Hey, Stephanie, how come we never talk about how we feel when we're dancing? - How come we never talk about that? - Good night and thanks. No, maybe I could walk you the rest of the way. - Let me do that. - Nope. You shouldn't have asked. You should have just done it. Oh, hot stuff, Jesus. - Hey, what's happening, Tony? - Bob, what's up. My brother, Frank. Hey, how you doing? Double J. Hey, how you doing? - Come on up to the table over there. - Oh, okay.

I heard, like, the Pope, he gives special, - you know... - Dispensation. Yeah. Do you think the Pope could give Pauline an abortion? You mean give you a dispensation for an abortion? Yeah, you think you could do this? I don't think so, Bobby. Well, maybe, you know, maybe you could do it for me. - Maybe? - I'm sorry, Bobby. I don't think so. I was just thinking.

You didn't expect me to stay the whole night, did you? No, no. I didn't... Yes, I thought maybe you'd stay a little longer. - No, it's not your scene. Of course not. - I'm sorry, Tony. Don't worry about it. It's nothing, you know. So what, right? Come on. I'll walk you to the door. Hey, you know, your dancing is really marvelous. It's exciting.

I knew that you could. - I knew that you could. You stupid bitch. I wish you was staying longer, you know, Frank? Ex-priests don't stay back home. Listen, everyone's too shocked and disgraced. A family raises a priest, they think they've scored points in heaven, - and now they're gonna lose them. - Hey, Frank. How you doing? Okay. We better get a move on. I gotta pick some people on the way. Okay. Listen, we gotta keep in touch. Yeah. You gonna like this settlement house? What do you think? - It'll do until I figure out my next move. - Yeah. - What about you? - What about me? Are you gonna do something with your dancing, Tony? I don't know. People ask me all the time. But I don't know, I mean, you know, I feel like my whole life, right, I've been told I'm the no-good in the family and that... Tony, the only way you're gonna survive is to do what you think is right, not what they keep trying to jam you into. You let them do that and you're gonna end up nothing but miserable. Huh? - Hey, have a good trip, all right? - Yeah. I left you something in your room. - What did you leave me? - A souvenir. Money? Leave me money. So, what are you standing there for? How come you wasn't there Saturday night? I didn't say I was gonna be there Saturday night. - The fuck you didn't. - I said maybe. Maybe's a maybe. I didn't think you'd go and get upset about it. Oh, forget upset. I'm not upset. It's just that we needed the practice. I mean, you know, you should've been there. All right, right, let's practice then. We can't. I didn't bring the records 'cause I didn't think you was gonna be here. Yeah? So what did you come for, huh? - Stugats. You know ""stugats""? - Yeah, I know ""stugats"". All right, we'll use some of this stuff. ""If you're not of a mind to break up..."" What's up? We've been waiting, man. Pete said you was practicing, you know. Hey, Tony, we were cruising you know who. Looking good. Not now. Don't talk about it now. Talk about it later. Stephanie, this is Joey, this is Double J, this is Bobby C. - How you doing, Stephanie? - How do you do? - You a dancer? - Yeah. - You hungry? - Yeah. What do you wanna eat, huh? - I'm gonna change and then... - All right. What maracas. She's got maracas. She's got nice tits. It's like, I'm gonna be traveling, you know. Promotional tours with authors and performers. Of course, I'm gonna hate to leave Manhattan, even briefly. There's certain ballets and concerts I'm just gonna have to miss. Tell them about the people who come into the office. That's what they wanna hear. Tell them that. Oh, you know who came in today? This guy, David Bowie. - He comes in, has this Astrakhan coat... - He's a fagot. - He's a half-fagot, man. - Hey, relax! Come on. Sit down. You mean, he's a bisexual. Yeah, he swings both ways. Men and boys. - What's so funny? - Oh yeah? Well, you know who came in today? Joe Namath. You know Joe Namath? He comes in and he wants some coffee, so I brought him coffee. And then he asked me to sit down, have some coffee with him. You had coffee with Joe Namath? Yeah, that's right. We were talking a little bit. He wanted to know what it was like to be 21. I told him I didn't know 'cause I was just 20. - Yeah, what else? - That's all. Ain't that enough? Hey, don't you never chew, Tony? Don't you never chew? Hey, look, when my mother dies, I'll give you the job, all right? You know what's going down your throat, man? Big chunks of hamburger, you know. Big gobs, like dog food, dog friskies, dog yummies. You know something, Joey? He's gonna turn into a dog. Stephanie, listen, can I talk to you for a second? I was listening to what you said in there before, and you seem to know a lot of people, and a lot of places and a lot of things. I got a friend of mine, you know, he's a very good friend of mine and he got a girl pregnant. He got a girl pregnant, and I wanted to know if you had to make a choice between getting an abortion and have to get married to somebody, what would you do? Well, who would I have to marry? You'd have to marry me. You'd have to marry me. Yeah. I think I'd get an abortion. Hey, so long, Tony. It's very nice meeting you. So, what'd you guys think of her? Hey, Tony, I liked her. I thought she was nice. I liked her a lot. She's a snotty bitch, man. She's cool. You just gotta get to know her, that's all. Hey, Ton, did you fuck her, yet? - What do you think? - I don't think so. You know, you guys got a lot of growing up to do, you know that? A lot of growing up. You're babies. Yeah. Hey, Mr. Fusco, look, I need the afternoon off. Sam's out. Harold's sick. Here, take these. - But I gotta, Mr. Fusco. - Sorry, Tony. Look, all I'm asking for is one afternoon off. I've been here almost eight months. I didn't miss a day yet! - Not today, Tony. - Oh, come on, Mr. Fusco. Some of those old farts, they miss three, four days at a time, you don't say nothing to them. Hey, cool off. Look, I got to have the afternoon off. I'm taking it. - You do, you're fired. - I'm doing it. - Then you're fired! - Then fuck you, asshole! And the fuck horse you rode in on. - Fucking cocksucker asshole! - Tony. Tony, I don't wanna marry Pauline. I don't give a fuck about this cunt. - So, don't marry her! - Tony, I gotta marry her! Fuck it. She won't get the abortion. - Everyone says I gotta marry her, Tony. - Who says that? Oh, fuck, her fucking parents, my fucking parents. The fucking priest on the corner. Her fucking high school guidance counselor. Tony, I'm paralyzed. I got no more control. I mean, you and me, Tony, we've been friends for so long. I mean, I'm hurting. Shit! You're always together. And I'm always fucking up, and you're always all right. You know? I... Oh, come on. Everybody fucks up. Really. - Don't worry about nothing. - You know, you're great. I'm in a terrible rush. I hate to leave you like this. You got no idea how much I appreciate this. I mean, this car's very important for me today, you know? - Will you call me tonight? - Yeah, I'll call you. Don't worry about nothing, all right? Take care. - I'll talk to you later then? - Yeah. - Call me tonight, right? - Yeah. You're gonna call me tonight? You know, Stephanie, this got me fired. - What? - This got me fired. You know, you couldn't do it on Sunday, so, my boss, he fired me. Well, I just wanted to get everything in, you know, so I could start fixing up when I move in on Saturday. Yeah. Nobody bitched at my office. I got the whole day off. Hey, I'm sorry. Oh, it's all right. No problem. No big deal. I can handle it. Yeah, come on in. Now, put that over here. Hey! I thought you were gonna be out of town. I postponed the trip. Jay, this is Tony Manero. He's a friend. - Tony, this is Jay Langhart. - Unspecified status. How do you do? Well, I've decided to leave you all the furniture. What, are you kidding? You're not gonna take any of this stuff? No, I'm gonna start fresh. What the hell, you picked out most of it anyway. - Well, super. - Stephanie, I told you not to say ""super."" Nobody says ""super"" anymore. Can I get you a beer? Glass of wine? No, man, it's all right. Hey, I read that book you told me to. You know, the... Kerr or the Lawson? - The Kerr. - Should have read the Lawson. Listen, if I can help you guys move in, you just say the word. Be glad to help. I'll get the rest of the stuff. Stephanie, who is that guy? He's an arranger, a record producer. He wants to do films. He's gonna move now to a more expensive apartment. I met him at the agency. He didn't want his wife to know how much money he had until the divorce was final. Come on. Let's go. I mean, who is he to you, Stephanie? That's what I'm talking about. He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a friend. And I was living with him for a little while. Are you in love with this man or what? I mean, tell me the story. - That's all I'm asking, is the story. - No, I'm not. We had a thing. You know? It didn't work out, and it's over now, and he's my friend, and he still likes me. He likes you. He likes you to have... To have you around for a quick piece when he feels like it. He helped me, man. You don't know what it's like at that place. It's crazy. You don't know shit! You know? I didn't know how to do stuff, so I'd go to him and I would ask him, and he would tell me how to do things. And then I'd go back to work and everything would be all right. Otherwise, I'd be walking around like an idiot, going, ""I don't know. I don't know. I don't know."" - And he helps me. He does. - Yeah, he helps you. Helps you what? Get in and out of the sack? Is that what he helps you do? - He helped me. - Sure. What the hell do you expect me to do, man? What do you expect me to do? He helped me. Don't cry about it. I mean, you know. All right, so he helped you. That's good for you. All right. Come on. Let's get out of here. I'm sorry. It's all right. Don't worry about nothing. Don't worry about that. Don't worry about nothing. Stephanie, don't. Look, we'll stop here for a while. We'll sit down. All right? Don't stop. Just take me home. Just take me home, man. No, come on, we'll sit here for a while, all right? Just, don't worry about nothing. It's pretty, isn't it? Sit down. You know how tall that bridge is? That bridge, that tower right there, goes up 690 feet. They got 40 million cars going across there a year. 127,000 tons of steel is involved in that. The concrete there, they got almost three-quarter of a million yards of concrete. That's right. The center span, right there, is 4,260 feet long. And with the on-ramps, it all together totals, like, something like 2.5 miles. You know all about the bridge, don't you? That's right. I know everything about that bridge. You know what else? They got a guy buried in the cement. Yeah? Know how it happened? Well, they was working on it, apparently, at the time. And they, I guess, they were pouring the cement, and he slipped off, you know, on the upper part of the bridge and, you know, fell in. Dumb fuck. - What a way to go. - I come down here a lot. You know, I get ideas. Oh, yeah? What kind of ideas you get? I don't know, daydreams, you know? I daydream a lot. Mr. Fusco, I come for what I got coming. Tony. Come on. Things got a little hot under the collar, don't you think? What are you talking about? I don't want to lose you, Tony. You're a good kid. Customers like you. I want you to stay on. - You mean, I ain't fired? - No. Come on. Here. - Jesus Christ. I don't believe this. - You got a future here, Tony. Here, Harold's with me 18 years, since I opened. Mike, 15 years, huh? Come on, now. Give Harold a hand, huh? He's making a mess. Pete, what are you doing? Trying to get up to 70%? Whoa, man. I didn't know you hung your label on her. What are you doing? That guy's the biggest cunt hound in Bay Ridge. Oh, my God. I've been in serious danger. It's no fucking joke, Stephanie. That guy's a fucking sleazy whore. I was dancing with the fella. You know? Dancing. - No, no. No, forget it. - Come on. Let's dance, huh? You disgust me, you know that? - Well, what do you mean? - Forget it. - Forget it. - Tony, I was just dancing with the guy. Tony! Tony! - Annette, what do you want? - Just look. Look. Oh, Jesus. Beautiful, man. They got six or seven of them in there and a couple of chicks. Listen, why don't we wait till they get down to about three, four people? - Yeah, one or two? - Tony! - All right. I'm thinking, I'm thinking. - Tony, listen, you gotta help... - Shut up! Shut up! - Back up, all right? What are you doing? What are you doing, Double J? - Trying to back it up! - What are you, crazy? - Tony, I'm gonna get married. - Shut up! Come on, fuckers! Tony! Tony! Tony, help me! Please, God! Hey, what the hell you think you're doing, huh? Ton! Ton! Come here, it's me! Come on! - Let's get out of here. - You okay? Jesus! He chickened, man! Where is he? Go, man! Go! - Where the hell were you, huh? - Tony, I was just driving around. - Oh, Jesus Christ! - I was looking for you. Where were you? Hey, Gus. Did you get the number of the truck that hit you? Don't make me laugh, all right? Do not make me laugh. - Look at this. We don't love you, right? - Right. - We got them. - Does that hurt? Yeah, really, huh? Hey, you guys really, you know, you really kicked their asses? Hey, come on, we got them where they breathe, Italian style. Yeah, that's great, you know. Only, you know, I ain't so sure it was the Barracudas. Dr. Allison to Emergency. Hey, what are you talking about? You said it was. No, I said it probably was. Don't be pulling our legs now. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - You said it probably was. - Yeah, I said probably. - That's what you told us. - I said probably 'cause I wasn't sure. You know? I mean, it could've been a Spanish... Stupid, fucking bastard. - We almost got our heads busted. - Yeah, not you, lover. You know, you got some fucking pair of balls on you, you know that, Gus? - Hey, hey, come on. - You know that? Hey, you know, I had to say something. Right? I had to lay somebody out for it. What are you, stupid? You can't see who hurt you, right? Oh, my God, what are you doing? If I said I didn't know who it was, they would have got off. Come on. Yeah, well, fuck you, Gus. You know what I feel like doing? I feel like breaking your broken leg. That's what I feel like doing. - Hey, come on. - Let's get out of here. Oh, God, I can't believe this whole fucking thing. You wanna know something? I could have killed him. - You couldn't kill a fucking crab lice. - Oh, shit, what do you think I am? - You think I'm a coward? - What do you think you are? Enough of that shit, already. I'm bored.

Okay, listen. Now, if I open this door, you're not gonna pull any funny stuff on me, right? No, of course not. First time I ever let a known rapist in my apartment. Hey, look, I'll just stay right here, all right? So, that way you don't think that I'm gonna, you know, jump you or nothing. What's wrong with you, man? Nothing. I'll tell you later. Right? Well, you cant just stand there. This is ridiculous. Come on. I've been up all night just walking and looking around. And, you know, I'm gonna get myself my own place. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm getting my money, I'm coming back, you know. 'Cause I ain't going back there. Wait a minute. Why don't you sit down, okay? Come on. - So, what are you doing? - What am I doing? I'm just not going back there, that's all. They're assholes back there. - I'm fed up to here with it. It's bullshit. - Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do? What do you do? You come in. You get a job. You know. Do what you do. Get a nice apartment. Okay, what kind of job? I don't know. What did you do? You came in, you couldn't do nothing, right? I could type when I came. No big deal. I'm an able person. I mean, I can do these things. Yeah, of course you can. Tony, I wanna tell you something. Now, you know, I said all that stuff to you about... Using you, practicing my act on you, you know? It wasn't true. There's a lot of other reasons that I was hanging around you. - What do you mean? - You made me feel better. You gave me, like, admiration, you know? Respect. Support. Stephanie, maybe now that, you know, like, I'm gonna be in town like I planned, maybe, like, we could see each other. No, I don't mean like that. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, like, I'm promoting your pussy, but I ain't. I mean, like, friends, right? You know, like you once said, we could help each other. - Wanna be friends? - Yeah. I'd like to be friends with you. Think you know how, huh? Think you could be friends with a girl? Could you stand being friends with a girl, huh? - The truth? - Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I could try. That's all I can say, Stephanie. I could try. Okay. Okay. Let's be friends, all right? We'll just be friends. All right. Okay. Friends, man., Here comes the President's helicopter, Marine helicopter number one... landing in the Plaza on the east side of the east front of the Capitol. Helicopter hovering gently, just off the ground. Amazing timing. The President flying all the way across the world... across the Atlantic Ocean... arriving almost exactly as scheduled at 9:30... in the Capitol Plaza... so that he can go up the steps of the House of Representatives... go into the chamber, and address the members of the House and the Senate... the Supreme Court, the diplomatic corps of Washington... all of whom are inside waiting for him... in the chamber of the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker... the President of the United States. And the President, accompanied by the Escort Committee... comes down the central aisle, approaching the podium... greets members of his Cabinet... and those who are waiting to be confirmed as members of his Cabinet... as he reaches the rostrum. Shakes hands with the Speaker, Carl Albert... A happy President, smiling. Ladies and gentlemen, President Nixon will, in a moment... address the Congress and the people of the United States. Thank you. Car 727. Car 727. Open door at the Watergate office building. Possible burglary. See the security guard. Are you sure you want us? 517 is closer and they're in uniform. They're getting gas. You take it. Unit 1 to Unit 2. Unit 1 to Unit 2. - What? - We're home. Base 1 to Unit 1. Base 1 to Unit 1. We have some activity here. Silence is advised. Shut it off. Base 1 to Unit 1. Lights on the eighth floor. Base 1 to Unit 1. Is there anybody there? There's people, people on the balcony. Armed people. Base 1 to Unit 1. Base 1 to Unit 1. We may have some problems. Someone's here. - Hold it, you... - Police! Put your hands up! Drop that jacket! Walkie-talkie, two 35mm cameras. Got it. That's good. All right, stay there. I already got something for you. Did you see this? A couple sleeping in bed, car hits the house... goes through the bedroom, comes out the other side. Good morning. Crash. Lewis is over at Democratic headquarters. One of the burglars had $814. One $230, one $215, and one $234. Most of it was in $100 bills and in sequence. - Woodward? - Yeah? There's been a break-in at the Democratic headquarters. - There's been an arrest. - Local Democratic headquarters. They were bugging the place. Check the time of arraignment, and get over there. And, Woodward, it was National Democratic headquarters. All right. - Anything else? - Anything else? Break-in, car crash. That's not bad for a Saturday. Okay, let me know what happens. Hello, Carl. Got anything on that couple? Harry, I know somebody on the staff over at Watergate. Bernstein, why don't you finish one story before trying to get on another? I finished it. - The Virginia Legislature story? - I finished it. All right, give it to me. I'm just polishing it. I'll work the phones. Polishing it? Yeah, you work the phones. Excuse me, I'm sorry, who are the lawyers for the five men arrested at Watergate? Do you know? - Well, these two were assigned to it. - I'm sorry? These two were appointed to the case. But only now it turns out the burglars have their own counsel. - The burglars have their own counsel? - That's right. That's kind of unusual, wouldn't you say? For burglars it's unusual. - You know the name of the counsel? - I don't know. Some country-club type. You are charged with soliciting prostitution... at 14th and east street. And you get as your solicitor, one Perry Woodstock. Your Honor, Mrs. Hawkin has in the past been a reliable, hardworking parent. Parents are sworn over. I think $300 would be acceptable... Excuse me, what is your name? I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. - Markham. - Markham. Mr. Markham, are you here in connection with the Watergate burglary? I'm not here. Okay. Well, clearly, I am here... but only as an individual, not as the attorney of record. Who is? Mr. Starkey. - Do you have any... - Whatever you want... you'll have to get it from him. I have nothing more to say. Starkey. S-T-... Mr. Starkey was very helpful. Four Cuban Americans and another man, James W. McCord. Look, I told you inside, I have nothing more to say. I understand that. What I don't understand is how you got here. I assure you there's nothing very mysterious involved. Well, a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of the lawyers... assigned to represent the burglars. So? They never would have been assigned to represent the burglars... had anyone known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. Only, the burglars couldn't have arranged for their own counsel... since they never even made a phone call. So, if no one asked you to be here, why are you here? I don't want you to take this personally, Mr... - Woodward. - Woodward. It'd be a mistake to do that. I just don't have anything to say. Did one of the other men involved in the break-in call you? What reason do you have to assume that there were other people involved? Well, one of your clients was arrested with a walkie-talkie. They're not my clients. Now, I don't want to talk about this anymore. You're a lawyer and you're here. One of the defendants, Mr. Barker, and I met at a social occasion once. - Where? - I have nothing else to say. A Miami social occasion? Mr. Starkey says the Cubans were from Miami. L-62, James McCord. L-63, Bernard Barker. L-64, Virgil Gonzales. L-65, Eugenio Martinez. L-66, Frank Sturgis. Please step forward, Attorney Starkey. All charged with Burglary 2. - Mr. Starkey, will you represent all five? - Yes, Your Honor. And are all five gentlemen charged with burglary, second degree? Yes, Your Honor. Your names, please, and state your professions. Bernard Barker, anti-communist. Anti-communist? That, sir, is not your average profession. James McCord, security consultant. Where? Government. Recently retired. - Where in the government? - Central Intelligence Agency. Where? The CIA. Sturgis, Frank A., salvage operator. Holy shit! Eugenio Martinez, known as Gene Valdez. James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin. Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini. All five of them had at least one alias. Is there any proof they were trying to bug the National Democratic Chairman? It's obvious they were trying to bug O'Brien. They wouldn't go to all that trouble to bug secretaries. - There's no proof. - Wait a minute. I called a lawyer in Miami I know. He said four of the guys who were arrested were from Miami... Gonzales, Martinez, Sturgis, and Barker. Yeah, Barker. And all four of them were involved in CIA activities... - No, they weren't. - Yeah. No, only one of them was admitted CIA, and the CIA won't confirm that. In fact, they deny even knowing McCord. Yeah, but I just think it's obvious that with all that money and equipment... they weren't out to work by themselves. Somebody hired them. I'm not interested in what you think is obvious. I'm interested in what you know. What we don't know is why they wanted to bug Democratic Headquarters. Whether they were working for themselves... or other individuals or other organizations. Could be a story, or could just be crazy Cubans. Bachinski, when you get there tonight, take it easy. The police are nervous. Yeah? Bachinski, calling from Police Headquarters. A friend just showed me what they found in the hotel rooms... of the Watergate burglars. There's something here you might want to look into. Hang on. Okay, go ahead. There's a strange entry in two of the burglars'address books. - Yeah. - One says, ""H.H. At W.H."" The other says, ""Howard Hunt, W. House"". You can dial the White House direct, can't you? Yeah. - What's the number? - 456-1414. - White House. - Howard Hunt, please. Mr. Hunt isn't here just now. He might be in Mr. Colson's office. I'll connect you. Thank you. - Charles Colson's office. - Howard Hunt, please. - Mr. Hunt isn't here just now. - Do you know when he'll be back? No, I don't. Okay, thank you. - Have you tried the Mullen Firm? - I beg your pardon? He also works as a writer at Mullen & Company Public Relations. Do you have a phone on that or an address, please? No, I don't. I'm sorry. All right, thank you. Harry? Who's Charles Colson? Who's Charles Colson? Sit down. You know, I'm glad you asked me that question. The reason I'm glad you asked me is because... if you had asked Simons or Bradlee, they would've said: ""You know we're going to have to fire this schmuck at once because he's so dumb!"" Who is Charles Colson? The most powerful man in the United States is President Nixon. You've heard of him? Charles Colson is Special Counsel to the President. There's a cartoon on his wall. Caption reads, ""When you've got them by the balls... ""their hearts and minds will follow"". Mullen & Company. - Howard Hunt, please. - One moment, please. Howard Hunt here. Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. Yes, what is it? I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number... were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate? Good God! Do you care to comment? In view that the matter is under adjudication, I have no comment. Hello? This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. I was told that you had worked with a Mr. Howard Hunt. Why would anyone say that? You do know Mr. Hunt? No, I don't believe so, and I can't imagine why anyone would say that. Listen, I'm really sorry, but I was on my way out. Goodbye. Could we just confirm a couple... Bye. - Did you say the Washington Post? - Yes, that's right, the Post. Your publishing firm was listed in some papers in connection with a Howard Hunt. Yeah, he's one of our authors. He wrote spy novels, I think. What type of spy novels were they? Were they modern, or were they period... You say, ""wrote""? You mean he's no longer with you anymore? No, not at this time. How long has it been since you've heard from him? A couple of years, I think. Could you tell me some of the names of the novels that he has written? - Hello? Is this Mr. Paul Herrera? - Quin? This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. Bob Woodward of the... Do you speak English? Momento, momento. Do any of you guys speak English? Do any of you guys speak Spanish? - Seor. - S. Never mind. Thank you. Thank you. Never mind. - Hello. - Mr. Bennett? - Yes. - This is Bob Woodward... of the Washington Post. Sorry to bother you at home. I was wondering if you could confirm some information... on one of your employees, Mr. Howard Hunt? What kind of information? It's just profile information mostly. We know, for example, that he works for Mullen & Company... or did work for Mullen & Company as a writer. He's also a novelist. We know that he works in the office of Mr. Charles Colson at the White House. And the CIA. And the CIA. If you're conducting that kind of investigation... then certainly it comes as no surprise to you that Howard was with the CIA. No, no surprise at all. Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970. From '49 to '70. Now, this is on deep background... but the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in. What else you got? According to White House personnel... Hunt definitely worked there as a consultant for Colson. That's Charles Colson, the President's Special Counsel. Did you call the White House Press Office? I went over there. I talked to them. They said Hunt hadn't worked there for three months. Then a PR guy said this weird thing to me. He said, ""I'm convinced that neither Mr. Colson... ""nor anyone at the White House... ""had any knowledge of or participation in... ""this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee"". - Isn't that what you'd expect them to say? - Absolutely. So? I never asked about Watergate. I simply asked what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered he was innocent when nobody asked if he was guilty. Be careful how you write it. Looks like we've got a White House consultant linked to the bugging. Harry, this isn't a police story anymore. This is national. We need a top political writer on it. Well, they don't want it. They're all over the goddamned map covering the Primaries. Besides, this guy has busted his ass. He's been on this paper for only nine months. - What's the matter with you? - He's a humper! What's he been writing about, rat shit in restaurants? - He's got no experience. - He got a few of them closed, didn't he? Minor incidents. Small government agencies. Have Mr. Moffitt come in here, please. And see if Mr. Bradlee's free. I want Ben to hear this. Sure Moffitt'll want the story for the National desk... now that we've built it into something. Even Bernstein's busting his ass! I read that cockamamie memorandum he wrote on the break-in. All right, so some of it was bullshit. What is the matter with you? You told me yourself you were going to fire him last month. Look, he wants on the story bad. They both do! He knows a lot of people. Howard, they're hungry! You remember when you were hungry? Hello. Can you get me Nigel... Right away. - How's it going? - What are you doing? - Polishing it a little. - What? - Polishing it. - What's wrong with it? Nothing. Nothing. It's good. Then what are you doing with it? I'm just helping. It's a little fuzzy. May I have it? I don't think you're saying what you mean. I know exactly what I mean. Not here, I can't tell from this whether... Hunt works for Colson or Colson works for Hunt. - May I have it, please? - Some of the conclusions... - May I have it? - Yes. I'm not looking for a fight. I'm not looking for a fight, either. I'm just aware of the fact that you've only been here nine months. What's that got to do with anything? I've been in the business since I'm 16. What are you saying? I'm trying to tell you that if you'd read mine and then read yours... - May I read yours? - Yeah. I walked by, gave yours a glance, it didn't look right... so I just figured I'd refine it a little. The first paragraph has to have more clarity... if the reader's going to understand it. You don't mention Colson's name till the third paragraph. I think mine's better. But you go ahead and read it. If you think yours is better, we'll give yours to the desk. I've got Colson's name up front. He's a White House consultant and nobody knows it. You're right. Yours is better. If you're going to do it, do it right. Here are my notes. If you're going to hype it, hype it with the facts. I don't mind what you did. I mind the way you did it. Woodward. Bernstein. You're both on the story. Now don't fuck it up. Steuben, what's the name of that girl that you bombed out with... - that works in Colson's office? - Sharon Lyle. - Why are you looking at me like that? - You're attractive. You are very attractive. You know, my girlfriend told me to watch out for you. - Who? - I'm not giving any names. Steuben said you worked for Colson. Steuben's crazy. I never worked for Colson. That's what he said. I worked for an assistant. Colson was really big on secrets, anyway. Even if I had worked for him, I wouldn't know anything! Did you know Howard Hunt? Didn't he work in the office? Yeah, I knew Howard. - Nice? - He's a nice person. He's secretive, he is secretive, but a decent man. Do you have any idea what he did? The White House said he was doing some investigative work. What do you say? - He was doing investigative work. - On what? - Different things. - Like what? She warned me. I'm not going to take my book out. I'm just asking you. The scuttlebutt for a while was that he was investigating Kennedy. Go on. The White House was real paranoid about Teddy Kennedy. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk. And he was always getting material out of the White House Library... and the Library of Congress, and anything he could find. White House Library. Hi, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post... and I was just wondering if you can remember... any books that a Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy? - Howard Hunt? - Yes, ma'am. Yes, I think I do remember. He took out a whole lot of material. - Why don't you hold on and I'll see? - I sure will. Thank you very much. - Mr. Bernstein? - Yes, ma'am? - I was wrong. - I beg your pardon? The truth is, I don't have a card that says Mr. Hunt took any material. I don't remember getting material for... I do remember getting material for somebody, but it wasn't for Mr. Hunt. All right. The truth is, I didn't have any requests at all from Mr. Hunt. The truth is, I don't know any Mr. Hunt. I was just wondering if you have any books... Hello? Yes, we're checking that information now. We'd just like to find out just what it was that Hunt did... when he worked out as a White House consultant on the Pentagon Papers. Yes, I'd appreciate that, if you could. Yes, sir. Thank you. I just got off the phone with the White House librarian. You want to look at the notes on it? This is some stuff from the Eisenhower campaign in 1952... that Hunt was connected with. Did you call the White House Communications Office? No, I just got off the phone with the librarian. - 524-743. - I know the number. Between the first and second quote there's a complete contradiction. It's a space of about five seconds. - My feeling is... - Was this all... Mr. Clawson's office. This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. - Could I talk to Mr. Clawson, please? - One moment, please. Thank you. When she came back she said she didn't even know... - Ken Clawson. - Mr. Clawson, this is Bob Woodward. Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post had a conversation... with a White House librarian... on some books a Mr. Howard Hunt took out on Senator Edward Kennedy. She first said that Howard Hunt had taken out books on Senator Kennedy... and then she denied even knowing who he was. I was wondering if you'd like to comment on this confusion. Listen, let me call you back on this matter. - I'm going to check on it for you. - All right, thank you. Bye. - Call back? - Yes. - This was all one conversation? - Yeah. She says first of all, ""I think I got a bunch of books on Hunt"". She comes back five seconds later, she says, ""I don't even know a Mr. Hunt"". It's obvious someone got to her. Not enough proof. I mean, if there was just a piece of paper... that said that Hunt was taking out books on Kennedy and Chappaquiddick. Like a... I don't know, library slip. Hunt also took out books from the Library of Congress... but what's more important is that somebody got to her in that space of time. - How do you know somebody got to her? - Because she said that Hunt... There was a lot of books that Hunt checked out. And then she comes back and she don't even know him. - Woodward. - Mr. Woodward, Ken Clawson calling back. - I've just talked with the librarian. - Yes, sir. She denies that the conversation with Mr. Bernstein ever took place. She said she referred him to the Press Office. Excuse me, I'm sorry, you say she denies even knowing... about the conversation taking place? That's right. She said someone did call her asking about Mr. Hunt... but all she did was refer him to the Press Office... and she denies that... - any other conversation took place. - Total bullshit. - I hope that's been of some help to you. - Thank you. - We've got to get something on paper. - The Library of Congress. Mona? Excuse me, Mona, could you take any calls for me, please? - Sure. - Here's my note. If I get any calls... - Will you be back later? - I don't know when. You want all the material requested by the White House? All White House transactions are confidential. Thank you very much, gentlemen. - We need a sympathetic face. - We're not going to find one here. You want every request since when? - When did he start? - July of '71. I imagine the whole last year. I'm not sure you want them, but I've got them. Maybe they pulled the cards. Maybe they changed the names. There might have been a card there, and we missed it. Hey, wait a minute. I met a White House aide once at a social occasion. - So? - He might confirm. - Do we need W.H. In White House? - Not in the second paragraph. - I don't think we do. Do we? - White House will be enough. - White House. - Just use White House. Forget the W.H. I want to know about Colson. What was his job at the White House? - Special consultant to the President. - I gotta say it. These notes on the White House librarian, are they accurate? The White House librarian, the notes, are they accurate? Yeah, but I wanna hear him say it. - Okay, let's have it. - Here you are, Ben. It's a good, solid piece of American journalism... that the New York Times doesn't have. You haven't got it. A librarian and a secretary saying Hunt looked at a book. That's not good enough. A White House aide told me that Hunt was investigating Kennedy. Who was it? Who was it? You want the name, you mean? No, how senior, how high up? I don't know titles. ""Showed a special interest"". No, we said the White House was investigating Kennedy. ""Showed a special interest in him"". Jesus, the story's stronger than that. The White House librarian says Hunt checked out a lot of books. We got a secretary in Colson's office said Hunt was sitting... All right, Carl. Ben, that's a Page 1 story. Stick it inside someplace. This is a goddamn important story. Get some harder information next time. Asshole. Bradlee's just sticking up for the Kennedys. - We didn't have it, that's all. - Bullshit. We had it cold. - No, we didn't. - Why didn't you say something? Do you think bitching about it is going to get the story where we want it? Throw it in the can. - Yes? - This is Woodward. I want to talk about Watergate. I know... We're not going to talk about that subject. - We talked about Wallace. - But this is different. That was about the shooting of a man running for President. - This is different. - How? Not about this story. Don't call me again. Good luck, Mr. President. Taxi. - Where are you? - Stuck. The story's stalled on us. And you thought I'd help? I'll never quote you. I wouldn't quote you even as an anonymous source: You'd be on deep background. You can trust me. You know that. Go on. - Can you tell me what you know? - You tell me what you know. Hunt worked for Colson at the White House. Hunt was investigating Kennedy at Chappaquiddick. That should tell you a lot. What else? We're beginning to hear a lot about a lawyer at CREEP named Gordon Liddy... who's... Gordon Liddy... was fired by Mitchell because he wouldn't talk to the FBI. - You'll hear more. - Will he talk? I was at a party once, and... Liddy put his hand over a candle, and he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh was burned. Somebody said, ""What's the trick?"" And Liddy said, ""The trick is not minding"". The story is dry. All we've got are pieces. We can't seem to figure out what the puzzle is supposed to look like. John Mitchell resigns as the head of CREEP... and says that he wants to spend more time with his family. Sounds like bullshit. We don't exactly believe that. No, but it's touching. Forget the myths the media's created about the White House. The truth is, these are not very bright guys... and things got out of hand. Hunt's come in from the cold. Supposedly, he's got a lawyer with $25,000 in a brown paper bag. Follow the money. What do you mean? Where? I can't tell you that. But you could tell me that. No, I have to do this my way. You tell me what you know and I'll confirm. I'll keep you in the right direction if I can, but that's all. Just follow the money. - Goddamn New York Times. - What is it? Phone calls from burglars in Miami to the Committee to Re-Elect. Fifteen phone calls. At least 15 phone calls and those phone calls were made as early as March 15... which is a full three months before the break-in. ""$89,000 issued in the name of a prominent Mexican lawyer"". $89,000 in Mexican checks? Why didn't we get this? Who are their sources? I even know someone who works at the phone company. Carl, if John Mitchell wanted your phone records... you'd be running around yelling invasion of privacy. Was the New York Times article accurate? - Yeah, but I can't get you a fuller listing. - Why? They've subpoenaed all of Bernard Barker's phone records. I think they're trying to find out if the Watergate burglars broke any Florida law. - Who subpoenaed them? - Miami DA. - What's his name? - I don't know his name. But, the guy who's heading the investigation is named Dardis. Dardis. What's his first name? I don't know his first name. I guess you'll have to find that out. Hi. I'm Carl Bernstein, I have a 9:15 appointment with Mr. Dardis. Yes, Mr. Bernstein, I'm afraid that Mr. Dardis... won't be able to see you this morning. His calendar is really quite full. There must be a mistake. I made the appointment with him personally. - I called from Washington. - It should've been made through me. If you care to wait, I'll see if I can squeeze you in later. Oh, thanks very much. I guess it's difficult when he makes his own appointments. Yes, well, we try to handle it. It's 4:00, we'll be back in 15 minutes. You want anything? - Coffee, black. - Coffee, black. I'm still here. I'm so glad. If you could just get me in to see him for five minutes, I'd appreciate it. - No, Mr. Bernstein. - I have to get back. We're going to try. Oh, hi. He's expecting you. I do have a couple of things to do. I'll be at the Sheraton if you want to reach me. If he has any space tomorrow, I'd appreciate it. Number's on the back. - Fine. - Thank you for your patience. Thank you, Mr. Bernstein. Tomorrow it should be better. I guess so. Mr. Dardis' office. Hi. Please tell Mr. Dardis that Mr. Bernstein has just left. He'll be available all day tomorrow. I think we can probably squeeze him in around 4:30. Yes. And please tell Mr. Dardis that he doesn't want to be late for his 6:30 appointment. - Yes, I will. - Thank you. Mr. Dardis' office. - This is Mr. Martinson over at the County... - I beg your pardon? Martinson, over at the County Clerk's office. There's some records here that Dardis wanted right away. Could you come and get them? We're closing. Well, yes, I'll be right over. Could be easier, too. All right. Hold it. - What? - Excuse me. Hi. Can I help you in some way? I'm Carl Bernstein. I've been waiting since 9:00. - Would you wait outside? - I've been waiting out since morning. - Go ahead. Finish your call. - Wait outside, please, will you? No. I'm the reporter from the Washington Post. We talked on the telephone yesterday... and you told me to come on down here and I'm here. Okay, yeah. I've got the press here. I'm gonna have to call you back. If you didn't want to see me I don't know why the hell... you didn't tell me when I was in Washington? I just wasted a whole goddamned day here. My paper's waiting for a story. You tell me yesterday to come here. You said I got a 9:30 appointment. - I've been waiting out here the whole day. - Caught me on the worst day possible. The man I work for has just started a re-election campaign. Now, we're gonna have to see each other tomorrow. Okay? No, sir, I'm facing a deadline and my paper's saving a space for me. - I just don't have a minute now. - Well, I'm sorry... Mr. Dardis, I'm really very sorry about this. Mr. Bernstein... I beg your pardon, ma'am, but this gentleman... made the appointment with me specifically. And I think the Washington Post deserves the same courtesy... as any of the people waiting out there, with all due respect. I'll buzz you in about five minutes. The lady takes good care of me. The fact is we just can't go into it this evening. It's going to have to wait till tomorrow. Okay? I just wish you could've told me that before I left... because I gotta go back to my paper now and write that story... one way or another, that's all. Do you want to see Mr. Barker's phone records and his money records? You told me on the phone if I'd come here you'd show everything you got on Barker. - That's all I want. - Well, that's what I've got. Well, that's fine. Okay, you and I are going to have to have an agreement... that you're not going to reveal the source of your information. All these are cashier's checks on a bank in Mexico City. - All these checks from Mexico? - S. How come? Did the money originate there? Well, I doubt it started off as pesos. Wait a minute, what's this one? What's... Okay, $25,000. - Who's that? - Kenneth H. Dahlberg. We haven't been able to ascertain who that is. Bob, listen, I think I got something. I don't know what it is. But somewhere in this world there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg. And we've got to get to him before the New York Times does. Because I think they have the same information. Got a pencil? Write this down. Quick. Kenneth H. Dahlberg. D-A-H-L-B-E-R-G. McGovern, who at first had voiced complete support for Eagleton... has more recently expressed doubts... and said that Eagleton must make a decision... whether to stay or leave the ticket. You're the one that wanted the articles... - on Dahlberg, Kenneth H. Dahlberg? - Yeah. Couldn't find anything in the clip file at all. Oh, wonderful. I did find one picture though, if it's any help. Thanks. Minnesota. Minneapolis... I base that conclusion upon my conversations with his doctors... and my close personal and political association... - Outside line, please. - Yes. - Thank you. ...the joint decision... that we have reached tonight, health would not affect. But the public debate... over Senator Eagleton's past medical history... continues to divert attention from the great national issues... that need to be discussed. I have referred to the growing pressures that ask... for Senator Eagleton's withdrawal. Hello? - Could I please... Mr. Dahlberg? - Yes. - Kenneth Dahlberg? - Yes. This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. - Yes? - About that $25,000 check... deposited in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars... Mr. Bernard Barker... As you know, sir, the check has your name on it. We were doing a story on this... and I was wondering if you would care to comment or explain? I turn all my money over to the Committee. What committee is that, sir? The Committee to Re-Elect? - Yes. - Why would you do that? I raise a lot of money. I'm Midwest Finance Chairman. For the Committee to Re-Elect? - Hello? - Yes, that's right. How do you think your check got into the bank account of the Watergate burglar? I'm a proper citizen. What I do is proper. Oh, I understand. I've just been through a terrible ordeal. My neighbor's wife has been kidnapped. How do you think your check got into Barker's account list? - Committee to Re-Elect the President. - Could I speak to Mr. Clark MacGregor? - One moment, I'll connect you. - Thank you. Yes? - Mr. MacGregor? - Yes. This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. - Hello? - Yes. This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. I just spoke to a Mr. Kenneth Dahlberg... who says that he is Midwest Finance Chairman. Yeah, I know Ken Dahlberg. Well, I can't seem to get an explanation on why a check... for $25,000 made out to Mr. Dahlberg... that he apparently sent to the Committee to Re-Elect the President... would end up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar. I don't know. - But you're head of the Committee, sir. - Look, I just came aboard. John Mitchell was the head of the Committee. He might know. Well, what would the explanation possibly be... I don't know. You're implying that I should know... and if you print that, our relationship will be terminated. Sir, we don't have a relationship. The issues of the campaign are peace and prosperity... not a campaign check. - Bob. - Sir, no one is saying... ...this happened before I came on board. - Mr. Dahlberg is on line 2. I'm running a campaign for the re-election of the President. We've raised $60 million and you're asking about a $25,000 check. Mr. MacGregor, excuse me, could you hold one second, please? - All right. - Thank you. Yes? - Hello. - Mr. Dahlberg? - Yes? - Could you please hold one second, sir? - Yes. - Thank you. - Mr. MacGregor? - Yeah? Can I call you right back, sir? I'm very sorry. - Yeah, okay. - Mr. Dahlberg. Yes. I'm sorry I hung up before. I wasn't sure you were a Washington Post reporter. I believe we were talking about a $25,000 check. Obviously this is difficult for me. I'm caught in the middle of something and... I don't know what. What do you think it could be? I deal with a lot of important people. People who work for the Committee? Hello? For the Committee. - The Committee to Re-Elect the President? - Yes. You see, I raised that money in cash... and I have a winter home in Florida. - Is that Miami? - Boca Raton... and I didn't want to carry all that cash around. - Now, you can understand that. - Of course I can. So, I had it exchanged for the cashier's check. And how do you think it got into Barker's account? I know I shouldn't be telling you this... I gave it to Mr. Stans. I beg your pardon? I gave it to Stans. Maurice Stans? - The head of finance for Nixon? - Yes, in Washington. Now what he did with it, I really do not know. I see. Were there any other checks that you might be aware of, that could... That's all I have to say. Mr. MacGregor... Mr. Dahlberg... I'm sorry. Thank you very much. - Bob? - Yeah. - Carl Bernstein on line 1. - One? - Yeah? - Woodward? - Bernstein. - I think I got a lead on Dahlberg. - I just... I got it. - What? I just talked to him. I just hung up from him. Bernstein, listen, it goes all the way to Stans! - What're you talking about? - It goes all the way to Stans. He gave the check to Stans for the Committee to Re-Elect! - Did he say that? - He said it. I've got it in my notes. - Jesus. - It's down on record, Bernstein. That money winds up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar? - Yes! - Fantastic. I'm coming home. Okay. ... catapulted the unknown Senator from Missouri into national prominence... by naming Eagleton as his running mate. ... bolstering of support for the Democratic ticket... Scott, what happened with that Taiwan thing you were telling us about? Japan is going to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan... when they recognize Red China. The irony, of course, that's a direct result of Nixon's visit to China. Jesus, what did he tell them? What did he say to them? Incidentally, that's a great parallel story... if you're going to do that piece on dtente. Right, ""Queen Elizabeth proclaims a state of emergency... ""to deal with what we call a 'dock strike' "". Breaking it off... I'll give you a human interest. ""Thirty-one days of rain in the Philippines... ""is being blamed on the theft of a statue of Jesus"". We had one like that before. - I'll put my best writer on that. - What about the one in India? Laugh, gentlemen, it'll be the only story everyone reads. Okay, National? We have the Bremer diary. ""Wish to kill Nixon"". He took a car trip to New York, Ottawa, and Washington to kill him. We have the ""Senate approving the ABM Treaty"". ABM. Of course, we have ""McGovern offering the VP spot..."" to everybody. - Yeah, that's news. - I have... Because everybody's been offered it. Now, I'll tell you what will be news. When somebody accepts it. That's news. Here is some great art. McGovern and Humphrey at breakfast, smiling their asses off. Isn't that great? - He says, ""I am George's friend..."" - Why is that man smiling? Sounds friendly. Very friendly. ""I'll be helping him in ways he never dreamed possible"". Breakfast followed by lunch. Okay. Metro? Well, we got the schoolteachers on Capitol Hill. They want a 17% increase in pay or this fall they go on strike. Harry, I think we could mention that this might be the time... to go to the front page on the district home rule. - Oh, come on! - Listen to him. Ben, this time it could go all the way. The House is going to vote next week on a Senate resolution. Okay then, well, when they pass it, we'll run with it. Okay, fellas, let's go around again now. Foreign? Taiwan emergency, Philippines. Okay, fine. National? I'll stand on the Eagleton follow-ups... McGovern not being able to get a replacement. He's offered it to Humphrey, Kennedy, and Ribicoff. All turned him down. That's the Page 1 lead right there. You're ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions. Nobody cares about the Dahlberg repercussions. Now look, it was our story that got the General Accounting Office... to start an audit with CREEP Finance. We printed that didn't we? When the frigging audit's done, we'll print that, too. Let me tell you what happened today. I was having lunch at the Sans Souci, and... this White House guy, a good one, a pro... came up and asked me, ""What is this Watergate compulsion with you guys?"" Compulsion? This is a story. This is not compulsion. I said, ""Well, we think it's important"". And he said: ""If it's so goddamn important, who in the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?"" Now, what do you expect him to say from the White House? ""You're doing a great job""? Why don't you ask him what he's really saying? He wants to take the story away from Woodstein and... - give it to his National desk. - At least I have... some experienced guys sitting around who know the politicians... - who have the contacts. - We're aware of that. You said it. Sitting around. Ben, it's a dangerous story for this paper. - What if your boys get it wrong? - Then it's our ass, isn't it? We all have to go out and work for a living. National gets eight columns. Nine for Foreign. Metro, 15. That's it, fellas. Hey, Scott, I need to see you. How dangerous? Well, it's not just that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me... or that everything we print, the White House denies... or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff. What then? Look, there are over 2,000 reporters in this town... are there five on Watergate? Where did the Washington Post suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom? Why would the Republicans do it? McGovern is self-destructing, just like Humphrey, Muskie, the bunch of them. I don't believe their story. It doesn't make sense. Yeah, Bernstein. Now? All right. Woodward, Bradlee will see us now. Answer the phone for me, will you? Are you trying to find the lowest possible common denominator... Ben, it's the hottest item. - It's in over 500 papers. - What is it? Yesterday's weather report for people who were drunk... and slept all day. Jesus! Send it out... to the San Francisco Chronicle. They need it. - How about the crossword puzzle? - No. Anagrams? - No space, Mickey. - Goodbye. The last thing you bought from me was the obituaries. - Make him buy something, will you? - All right. Hey, what do you guys want? The GAO report's due out the morning of Nixon's renomination. Sit down. Well, that's two weeks from now. Since they're only responsible to Congress... there's no way the White House can control the investigation. There's a source over at General Accounting that tells us... there's a whole rat's nest of illegal shit going on over at CREEP. - Like what? - Like a slush fund. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of unaccounted-for cash. Hundreds of thousands of dollars? Any comment from CREEP? Yes. Unavailable for comment. They're not talking. But what else besides the money? Where's the goddamn story? The money's the key to whatever this is. - Says who? - Deep Throat. - Who? - Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak... his source in the executive... Garage freak? Jesus, what kind of a crazy, fucking story is this? Who did you say? He's on deep background. I call him ""Deep Throat"". Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing... Nixon's guaranteed the renomination... and the Post is stuck with a story no one else wants. It'll sink the goddamn paper. Everyone says, ""Get off it, Ben"". And I come on very sage... and I say, ""You'll see. You wait till this bottoms out"". But the truth is, I can't figure out what we've got. What else are you working on? We're after a list of CREEP employees. - Where is it? - It's classified. - How are you gonna get it? - We haven't had any luck, yet. Get some. Anything else? You made a mistake in there. What? You said to Brad that we haven't had any luck yet... and that's the thing that he jumps on. You can't talk about luck. If you can't talk in specifics, you shouldn't say anything. Is there any place you don't smoke? - What? - Hold it. - What're you doing? - Kay Eddy. Doesn't she go with a guy that works for the Committee to Re-Elect? - The E.R. - All right. - Eddy? Hey. Kay, can... - Just a second. - 757-6521. - Okay, I'll get back to you on this, thanks. Don't you go with a guy that works for the Committee to Re-Elect? - Not anymore. - You did go with him, though. I think you were engaged to him, weren't you? - Yeah. - You got out of it? - So? - You're looking better. Look, we need a list of the people that work there. Do you think that... - I can't do that. - Why not? It's personal. What do you mean? You said it was over. You're asking me to use a guy I care about. - No. We're not asking you to use him... - Well, sure... ...just to help us. I mean, we'd do the same for you. My only chance of getting that story is if I see him. I don't want to see him again. - Do you have to see him? - Sure, I have to see him. No. Do you have to see him that way? Can't you just call him up on the telephone... and say you want to have a drink with him, just feel him out? You say the relationship is over. What the hell do you have to lose? Forget it. We don't want you to do anything that would embarrass you... or that you don't feel right about. Forget it. Don't let her just get off. I think she was going to say something. You just overdramatized it, she was going to give us what we want. It's over. - What? - It's over. Is this the whole list? Look what it says. ""Personnel, Committee to Re-Elect the President"". This is all in alphabetical order. You can't tell who works for who. Well, find out the department heads like Mitchell, Magruder, Stans. Here. John Mitchell. - What's the number? All right. Find somebody who has a number close to it. - They probably work for him. - There's a 303. Okay. Okay, we have to find out how the money got from Maurice Stans to the burglars. Somebody who worked in Finance. All right. Here's the head of Finance. Maurice Stans, 269. If we can just get somebody who works under Stans. - Sloan? You need him? - He's the treasurer. - What's the number? - Hugh Sloan, 287. Is there a secretary? Wait a minute. Manley. Here it is. Irene Manley? 1406 Lee Jackson Memorial Highway. - Hi, I'm Bob Woodward. - I'm Carl Bernstein. We're from the Washington Post. We'd like to know if we could speak to you for a few minutes. We understand your daughter works for the Committee to Re-Elect. - Wouldn't be anything embarrassing. - Would you object to just... - Yes? - Hi. Miss Milland? Betty Milland? - I'm Bob Woodward. - Carl Bernstein. We're from the Washington Post. I know you're trying to do your job. I mean... You don't understand the pressure that we're under. It'll just take a couple of seconds. If we can just come in for a couple of... - No, I really don't... - We don't want to come in. We understand that there was some documents... that were shredded at the Committee. Well, there... There's often shredding. We do that a lot. - Were you there during the shredding? - Yes, I was. I see. Were there any department heads from... the Committee who were also present? Yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night. John Mitchell? The Attorney General? He was carrying a raincoat over his head. I thought he was going to go... Did he supervise the shredding? Can I not answer any more questions? I'd just soon not... Okay? Maybe I could call you? - Are you being told not to talk? - Will you call us? I don't know. I'll try. What about all that shredding that took place after the break-in? Need to know more about the papers that were in shredding. I think you've some idea what's in the papers... when the former Attorney General comes to the office... when it's taking place at the Committee to Re-Elect... and got a raincoat over his head. Why's he in a raincoat? Could be raining is what could've happened. Let me go through the story again. You got a woman who's frightened at the door. Works for CREEP. She said there's shredding taking place. We don't know what's in the papers. We know the former Attorney General comes in with an overcoat over his head. It could be raining. There's a lawyer present. We don't know what he asked them. She wouldn't talk about it. Now, will you please tell me where there's a story? There's a story in the fact that the interview did not take place in her home... but in the office of the Committee to Re-Elect. How's there a story in that? It's not enough! There's a story because there's a lawyer in the office. - I mean, you're more resistant than she is. - That's right. - Why? - Because there's not enough fact. Well, let's just turn around and go back and question her again. - This won't take long at all. We just want... - Please go away, okay? Will you please leave before they see you. - Who did you mean by... - Who do you mean, ""they""? Could you give us their names? We haven't revealed the sources of people that have talked to us. You know, I really can't talk about this because... Would ""they"" be members of the Committee? Someone got to that woman. It's the key to the whole cover-up. How can you write that there's a cover-up? We don't know that there's a cover-up! Well, then, I don't know what the hell you need. So, you tell me what you need. I need more fact for a story is what I need... and I think you should need the same thing. Okay, if you get in the car... and there's music playing in the car, hypothetically. There's music playing in the car for 10 minutes... and there's no commercial. What can you deduce from that? - Is it AM or FM? - Come on, Bernstein! Is it AM or FM? A guy can come up to me on the street and he can ask me an address. Now, is the man interrogating me, or is he lost? What kind of a story do I write? What kind of a deduction do I make from that? Because you don't have a gut feeling that the woman is trying to help us? No, I don't have enough gut feeling and I wish I did. We're from the Washington Post... Abbott, Addis, Agusto, Albus... Is there something that strikes you as odd about this? - What? - It's almost like there's a pattern... to the way they're not talking. The way they say ""no""all the time. I think it's odd. - Mrs. Hambling? - Yes. Hi, we're from the Washington Post. I'm Carl Bernstein, this is Bob Woodward. A friend of the Committee said that we could contact you. - Who was it? - We can't reveal that. You can talk to us. We don't reveal our sources. You people... You think you can come into my home, ask a few questions... have me destroy the reputations of men that I work for and respect? Do you understand loyalty? Have you ever heard of loyalty? - Hi. - Yes? I'm Bob Woodward. Carl Bernstein. We're from the Washington Post. Yes. I've read what you've written. I want to thank you. I've been a Republican all my life, but this goes beyond party politics. Would you mind if we asked you a few questions? No. Come in. Would you like coffee? Sure. What they've done is a threat to the Constitution. It goes against everything we stand for. Could you be a little bit more specific than that? I'm afraid your articles have just scratched the surface. You don't mind if I just take a few notes, do you? No. How long have you worked at the Committee? Committee? Yes, the Committee to Re-Elect the President. Oh, I don't work at the Committee to Re-Elect the President. I work at Garfinkel's, in the accounting department. - Miss Abbott? - Yes. Judith Abbott? Carolyn Abbott. We're just doing something wrong. - Never been there. - No. We're doing something wrong. It's just not good enough. How can you keep going at something past the point when you believe it? We just have to start all over again. Nasmith, Narrow, Ness... Nickels, Nixon... Ed Nixon. Jolson, Jones... Jordan, Jost. If we could only get somebody that worked for Finance to talk. I can't believe it. - What about the bookkeeper? - Which bookkeeper? The bookkeeper that worked for both Slans and... - Oh, you're all right. - Sloan and Stans. I've been there. I've called her twice. There's no answer. I say we should start again. Abbott, Addis, Agusto... Albus, Aldus, Alexander... Balowski, Clan, Donstille... Boyle, Brenner, Bromley... Jost, Nasmith... Narrow, Ness, Nickels... Martini, Sandstrom... Skroes, Skully... Skully. We've been there twice. All right, Willcox, Windfall, Winter... Two weeks work, half the names crossed off and what've you got? People aren't talking, Harry. And it's the way they're not talking that's unnatural. Harry, we've been up all night. We went over all the quotes of the people. - Slamming doors in our faces. - It's like they're getting instructions. Want to hear some real news? That GAO report in which you placed so much faith... well, it's been postponed till after tonight's renomination. - What do you mean? - Hughes got a call from Stans in Florida. Says he has new information, not to republish without it. They're going to bury the report until after the renomination. The Grand Jury indictment will be out soon and every indication says... the indictment will stop at the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy. And that's the end of your story. The vote of all the delegates has been recorded. The vote for Richard Nixon... is 1,347. The vote for Paul McCloskey is one. And therefore I declare the nominee of the Republican Party... for President of the United States... President Richard Nixon. Four more years! The President, and the future President of the United States of America! Wonderful young faces I see out there. Your enthusiasm, your idealism, your hard work. This is your first vote, and years from now... I just hope you can all look back... and say it was one of your best votes. Thank you. Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and... I just want to ask you a couple of questions. Well, you don't want me. You want my sister. It's for you. It's Carl Bernstein. Oh, my God. He's the guy from the Post. Get rid of him. Could I just borrow one of your cigarettes there? Sure. You've really got to go. Sure. Could I just get a match? I can understand your being afraid. There's a lot of people at the Committee just like you... who wanted to tell the truth but some people wouldn't listen. Certain people have gone back to the prosecutors and the FBI... to give information which they were never asked. You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance... and we were just wondering if you were... promoted to work for Mr. Stans immediately after Mr. Sloan quit... or whether there was some time lapse? I never worked for Sloan or Stans. Can I get you some coffee or something? Yeah. Thanks very much. Door sticks. Could I just sit down for a second? Sure, you can sit down, but I'm not going to tell you anything. Okay. I was just curious why you lied just then. Have you been threatened if you tell the truth? No. Never in so many words. - How do you like it? - Just milk. - Thanks. - Okay, I'll just get that. I saw in the wires that Mrs. Stans was in the hospital. Is she feeling better? The GAO, the General Accounting Report said that... there was $350,000 in the safe of the Committee to Re-Elect the President. Were you aware that it was that kind of funds from the very beginning? A lot of people are watching me. They know I know a lot. Was it all in $100 bills? A lot of it was. I thought it was an all-purpose, political fund... you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that. $350,000 for dinners? How was it paid out? Not in one big chunk. There was a list of 15 names and the amount of money... given to each person next to the name. What happened to the list? It was destroyed. It was the only record. Don't pay attention to this. This is for my memory. I have a very bad memory. You won't be quoted by name. In fact, we get confirmations before we print anything. I can't be... positive that that money was used for the break-in, you understand? Yes, I do. - But, people sure are worried. - Which people? Think you could help me with the disbursement of money... in terms of the number of people that were involved? How many? A group of them. About five. I don't know their names. Would Mr. Sloan know? - Would he... - I don't want to say anymore, okay? I won't be much longer. I wondered if you could just help me a little bit about... the money. We hear all kinds of figures. - There's so much of it. - How much is ""so much""? In one two-day period, $6 million came in. - Six! - Six million, cash. We didn't know where to put it all. I thought it was all legal. I mean, I guess I did until... after the break-in when I remembered Gordon got so much of it. - This is Mr. Liddy? - It's all so rotten. It's getting worse. And the only one I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. So, he quit. I was wondering... if Hugh Sloan was being set up now as a fall guy for John Mitchell. What do you think? If you guys could get John Mitchell, that would be beautiful. Coffee's cold. Is there any evidence that... any of Mr. Mitchell's assistants... were part of this? I had all the evidence. It was destroyed. I don't know who destroyed it. - I think Gordon did a lot of shredding. - Hard evidence? Well, I can't say that it would positively prove that they planned the break-in... but it would come pretty close. Can you tell me anything about who got the money? We have... had some help on this from a couple of sources... and this is a way of confirming it. I don't want you to feel that you're in a position... where you have to disclose names. I can just ask you initials... and then that way you're not divulging any information. We have some idea. Would that be all right? Was there an ""M""? Can you just nod either way? Did it go that high up? ""L""? I don't want to say any more, okay? I'm sorry. You said ""L""... or... I get confused. Could we just go back for a second? In one six-day period, over $6 million came in. You wouldn't believe what was going on inside that woman. The stuff was just ready to pour out. I'm pouring down cups of coffee trying to get it out of her... before she throws me out of the house. - Give me your notes so... - These are the notes. - These are the notes? - I've got stuff on napkins, matchbooks... I'm writing in the bathroom while she's getting coffee. - I'm a walking litter basket! - You're crazy. You'd be crazy, too, if you were operating on 20 cups of coffee. Could you give me something I can get down? I got it. I got it all. Okay. Write. - Mitchell was in control. - Wait a minute. - There were men working under Mitchell... - How many? I don't know how many, but the men working under Mitchell... received the money from the slush fund. Do we know how much money? We're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars. And these men are the key to what that money was used for. Boy, that woman was paranoid. At one point, I suddenly wondered how high up this thing goes... and her paranoia finally got to me. I thought what we had was so hot, that any minute CBS or NBC... would come in through the windows and take the story away. You're both paranoid. She's afraid of John Mitchell, you're afraid of Walter Cronkite. - Right. - Can we go back to what she said? Here. ""L,"" ""P,"" and ""M."" - What do you mean? - It's ""L,"" ""P,"" and ""M"". - She'd only give initials. - Initials? The initials are the name of the men that worked under Mitchell. ""L,"" ""P,"" and ""M."" You couldn't get the names? If I could've gotten the names, I would've gotten the names! I'm with the woman, trying to get anything I can. She said ""L,"" ""P,"" and ""M,"" that's all she would give me... are the people who worked under Mitchell. She said something about Mitchell. She hates him. She said, ""John Mitchell... ""If you guys could get John Mitchell, that would be beautiful"". Wait a minute, what's this here? What are you writing about Sloan? ""Sloan was the treasurer of the Committee to Re-Elect. ""His wife is pregnant and she made Sloan quit because apparently... ""he no longer wanted to be a part of it"". We've got to go see Sloan. Okay. Make a note of it. So, what have we got? Where's that matchbook? - Here. - ""L,"" ""P,"" and ""M."" Okay, ""L,"" ""P,"" and ""M."" - ""L"" could be La Rue. It could be Liddy. - ""L"" is Liddy. - How do we know that? - Because she said it. Right here. She said, ""At the time of the break-in... ""there was so much money floating around... ""that I know Gordon got part of it"". So I said, ""You mean Gordon Liddy?"" She said, ""Yes"". So, ""L"" is Liddy. Okay, that leaves ""P"" and ""M."" ""P"" could be... Parkinson. It could be Porter. It could be... Wait a minute! There was a guy once. There was a guy we talked to last week. Didn't he say that there was a Bart Porter... who at one time was a member of the Committee to Re-Elect? Porter was called before the Grand Jury investigation. So ""P"" is definitely Porter. ""P"" could be Porter. ""P"" is Porter, ""L"" is Liddy. All that leaves is ""M""! ""M"" could be McCord? That's out. It could be Mardian. It could be... - Magruder! - I think it's Magruder. - I think it's Magruder, too. - Why do you think it's Magruder? Because he was second in command under Mitchell. Why do you think it's Magruder? Because at one time he was a temporary head... of the Committee to Re-Elect, before Mitchell. I don't want a cookie. We've got to get that bookkeeper to say it was Magruder. Never get her to say anything about ""M."" We have got to go back there and try to get her to say it. If we could make names of the initials... then we'll know the people at CREEP who paid off the burglars. We'll at least know who got the money. The indictments that came down from the Grand Jury today... stopped... with the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy. Carl, we have got to go back there and get that bookkeeper... to say who the names are and not initials. She ain't going to give it to you... because I was with the woman for six hours. - We have to try. - Then you'll have to trick her, threaten her. - She's not going to do it. - Wait a minute. - You know what we could do? - What? - Listen, we go back there... - Yeah. ...and you ask her who ""P"" is. - Yeah. And then I say, ""No, don't worry about it... ""we know 'P' is Porter"". I just bury it. Okay. Now, wait a minute. I say to her, ""Who is 'P'?"" - And then you say to me... - I say, ""No, we know 'P' is Porter"". - You mean, you try to fake her out? - Right. - And what if she denies it? - We're screwed. - So? - But if she doesn't, we know we got it. - We know ""P"" is Porter. - Try it. Hi. They'll see you. Not if you let us in, they won't. And I'm Bob Woodward. - They'll see your car. - We parked around the corner. You have answers for everything, don't you? If we did, we wouldn't be here. You wrote what I told you. Oh, no. Not your name. No one knows it was you. Could you tell us who got the money? And how much? You mean like, ""What did you do with the $25,000, lady?"" What? Little jokes they're making down at Finance these days. If people are to be convinced... that Stans and Sloan are innocent, then our reporting must be precise... and you can help us. Who is ""P""? ""P"" we know, is Porter. You said, ""$25,000."" Is that how much Porter got? Was it more? Was it more than $50,000? Was Magruder the only ""M"" to receive money? Who told you about Porter? I'd like to move on now to the subject of the break-in at the Watergate... and the controversies that keep coming up out of that. It has recently, very recently been reported now, that... some documents were torn up... at the Committee to Re-Elect the President. Are you investigating the tearing up of those documents... Well, I think that came out in a story in the Washington Post. - Yes. - I think the investigation... that has just concluded itself... has probably been one of the most intensive... that the Department of Justice and the FBI has ever been involved in. Some 1,500 persons were interviewed... 1,800 leads were followed, 333 agents were involved... 14,000 man-hours... fifty-one of the 59 FBI field officers were involved. And that, I think... is a great credit to justice in this country. Did you know that documents had been destroyed? No, I did not. All these neat little houses and all these nice little streets. It's hard to believe that something's wrong in some of those little houses. No, it isn't. - Hello, I'm Carl Bernstein. - Bob Woodward. We'd just like to talk to Mr. Sloan for a couple of minutes. - He's resting right now. - Are you Mrs. Sloan? - You're the two from the Post, aren't you? - Yes. This is an honest house. That's why we'd like to see your husband. Faced with certain criminal charges that might be brought... against some people that are innocent, we just feel that... It's really for his benefit. No, it's not. No, it's not. Deborah, tell them to come in. Thanks. - Hi, Carl Bernstein. - How do you do? Hugh Sloan. - Bob Woodward. - How are you doing? I appreciate you giving us the time. You know, the reason that we're here, basically... is that we've talked to certain people who... have indicated that the reason you left the Committee... was because you no longer want to be part of it. Yeah, right. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation... why the money was handed to Liddy and Mitchell's aides. Try to understand this. - I'm a Republican. - I am, too. Well, I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House for four years and so did my wife. What happened on June 17, I don't think the President knew anything about. Is it possible that some of his people might have known? I'm not sure about that. Do you think the truth will ever come out at the trial? - That's another thing I'm not sure about. - Why? Well, obviously, because certain people lied to the prosecutor. No. We were never told flat out, ""Don't talk!"" But the message was clear, though. In other words, by their very silence, there was a cover-up. Well, they didn't urge us to come forward and tell the truth. ""They,"" meaning the White House? Well, the Committee's not an independent operation. Everything's cleared with the White House. And I don't think the FBI or the prosecutors understand that. That report on the cash... in the CREEP safe, that $350,000? - No, more. - Was that a correct figure? No, it was closer to $1,000,000. And, as treasurer, you could release those funds? When so ordered. We don't know the names of the people who could order you. - We just know that there were four. - No, there were five. Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're obvious. - There had to be a White House overseer. - Yeah, Colson. No, Colson's too smart to get involved directly with anything like that. It's Haldeman. Right? I won't talk about the other two. They both worked at the White House? One of them did, the other one's not in Washington. But that's all I'll say. - Kalmbach. - Nixon's personal lawyer. - Right? - Nixon's personal lawyer? I can't say anything. I'm sorry. - Well... - When's the baby due? Soon. Next month. - Are you going to stay here? - No, I don't think so. Decided where you're gonna go? I've been looking for a job in the private sector, but it's... It's very hard. My name's been in the papers too much. You know, one thing I'm just still not completely clear about? When you handed out the money, how did that work, exactly? Badly. I think what Bob means is, that ordinarily, what was the procedure? Routine. I'd call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department. He'd say, ""Go ahead, give out the money"". This was all done verbally? Yes. Okay, we know there were five men who controlled the slush fund. Mitchell, Stans, and Magruder. Yeah, those three we've got. And all three have been named by two sources. What about the other two? - Kalmbach. - We're pretty sure of Kalmbach. Maybe we better wait until we get all five, huh? Certain on Mitchell? We know that he approved payments to Liddy while he was Attorney General. - You've got more than one source? - Yes, Harry. - Who are they? - Sloan. Sloan and who else? There's another guy at Justice who so far won't confirm... the names of the others who control the fund. We're working on it. - What about Deep Throat? - He's not a source on this. - But do any of them have an axe? - No. Personal, political, sexual. - Is there anything at all on Mitchell? - No. - Then can we use their names? - No. God damn it! When is somebody gonna go on the record in this story? You guys are about to write a story that says the former Attorney General... the highest ranking law enforcement officer in this country is a crook! Just be sure you're right. - Essex House, may I help you? - John Mitchell. Yes? Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post... and I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour. Tomorrow we're running a story in the paper... and we just think that you should have a chance to comment on it. What does it say? ""John N. Mitchell, while serving... ""as United States Attorney General... ""personally controlled a secret cash fund... ""that was used to gather information about the Democrats... - ""according to""... - Jesus. ""...sources involved in the Watergate investigation"". - Jesus. - ""Beginning in the spring of 1971... ""almost a year before he left the Justice Department... ""to become President Nixon's campaign manager... ""on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund"". All that crap. You're putting it in the paper? - Well... - It's all been denied. You tell your publisher, tell Katie Graham... she's going to get her tit caught in the big ringer if that's published. Christ, that's the most sickening thing I ever heard. Sir, I was just wondering if I could ask you some questions? - What time is it? - It's 11:30, sir. 11:30? Is it morning or night? It's 11:30 at night, sir. Sir, the Committee to Re-Elect has issued a statement to our story... but there are just a couple of questions... Did the Committee tell you to go ahead and publish the story? You fellows have got a great ballgame going. As soon as you're done, we're going to do a story on all of you. Sir, there's just a couple of questions... Call my law office in the morning. There's no question you properly identified yourself? He said it right off the top. Mitchell know he was talking to a reporter? Yeah, but I think I woke him up. - Get good notes? - Verbatim. He really said that about Mrs. Graham? Well, I'd cut the words ""her tit"" and print it. Why? This is a family newspaper. You know, once when I was reporting... Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word. They were looking for a successor for J. Edgar Hoover. I wrote it and the day it appeared, Johnson held a press conference... and appointed Hoover head of the FBI for life. When he was done, he turned to his top guy... and the President said, ""Call Ben Bradlee and tell him, 'Fuck you' "". Then everybody said, ""You did it, Ben. You screwed up. ""You stuck us with Hoover forever"". I screwed up, but I wasn't wrong. How much can you tell me about Deep Throat? How much do you need to know? Do you trust him? Yeah. I can't do the reporting for my reporters which means I have to trust them. And I hate trusting anybody. Run that, baby. The Washington Post reported that while still in office as Attorney General... John Mitchell had personally controlled a secret Republican fund. Mitchell denied any such involvement and called the story ludicrous. The new charge also brought a response from Vice President Agnew... at his stop in Tampa. I have full confidence in Mr. Mitchell... and in the people in the Republican organization. And I think that that kind of unattributed report... at a time like this is counterproductive. We must bear in mind that those who published it... have already shown their sympathy for the other ticket. A band and some young cheerleaders... All non-denial denials. They doubt our ancestry, but they don't say the story isn't accurate. I mean, did you understand one thing he was saying? What I can't figure out is, what is a real denial? Well, if they start calling us goddamn liars, we better start circling the wagons. When do you think they'll start doing that? When they get out of Tampa. Joe, come on. What's going on with you guys at the FBI? I've been trying to get to you for weeks. Your secretary says you're not in. Last night I called, you said you couldn't talk... and this morning, as soon as our Mitchell story hits the stands... you call me and say you've got to see me right away. Why? Look, you guys have been causing big trouble at the Bureau. Why? Our reports are showing up in your paper almost verbatim. I mean, you've really been on the mark, except for Mitchell. Now, we didn't have that... - that he controlled the funds. - Right. Our agents have been busting ass... but we're gonna go back now and see if we've missed anything. What I don't understand is all the people... who might know details of the bugging operation... the FBI hasn't even talked to. And why have you conducted your interviews of CREEP personnel... at CREEP headquarters... instead of at their homes where they might feel freer to talk? Joe, wait a minute. Why have the interviews at CREEP always been conducted... within the presence of the lawyer who works for CREEP? Look, you know I can't answer for the whole Bureau. - Oh, come on, I'm just... - I do what I'm told. I followed my orders. Period. What orders? Wait. Woodward! Wait! Bob! Out of the blue. Out of the blue. Okay, this morning I get a tip to call a guy by the name of Alex Shipley... who is now the Assistant Attorney General of Tennessee. Now, the guy told me, that called me, that said... He said that Shipley was asked in the summer of 1971... by an old army buddy, a Donald Segretti... to join a group of other lawyers... for Nixon's campaign to sabotage the Democratic candidates. Listen, make a left when you can. We'll go to my place. Sabotage Democratic candidates? That's right. Now, I was able to make a couple of calls today... and I got Segretti's records for the year... His travel records for the years 1971 Does the FBI know about... - Did you say left or right? - Left! We're going to my place. We gotta go over the records. - Does the FBI know about Segretti? - The FBI interrogated Segretti... and found out he wasn't involved in the break-in so they dropped it. They didn't follow through on it. - Where is he? - He's in California. - Jesus, look at this. - What? Segretti crisscrossed the country at least a dozen times. He only stayed in cities where there were Democratic primaries. Well, if the break-in is just one incident in a campaign of sabotage... that began a whole year before Watergate... then for the first time, the break-in makes sense. This isn't so crazy. This thing didn't start with the bugging at the headquarters. Segretti was doing this a year before the bugging. And a year before, Nixon wasn't slaughtering Muskie. He was running behind Muskie, before Muskie self-destructed. If he self-destructed. - Hi. Donald Segretti? - That's right. I'm Carl Bernstein from the Washington Post. Hi. What can I do for you? Well, my paper just sent me out here to try to persuade you to go on the record. Why me? I guess because you were the head coordinator... of Nixon's sabotage campaign against the Democrats. - Carl, you want some coffee? - You read my mind. Carl, tell me something. What do you imagine the head coordinator does? Well, I guess basically you're involved in recruiting other people like yourself... other lawyers. - Lawyers? - Like Alex Shipley. I made it clear that I would not do anything violent or illegal. What do you mean by illegal? Watergate, I mean, that's... The whole bugging. That's horrendous! And what kind of stuff do you guys do then? Nickel-and-dime stuff. Stuff. Stuff with a little wit attached to it. You mean, when you sent out on Muskie's stationery that... Senator Hubert Humphrey was going out with call girls? Listen, if anything, it helped the man's image. What was the one on Muskie's stationery that you sent out... that said that Scoop Jackson was having a bastard child? So, sometimes it got up to a quarter. Off the record. I think one of the most interesting ones was the Canuck letter. What about it? Come on. Where you claimed that Muskie slurred the Canadians. No, I didn't write that. Do you know who did? Carl, when you guys print it in the papers, then I'll know. Smart guy, Donald. You're no dummy. I'm a lawyer, Carl. I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer... and I'll probably wind up going to jail and being disbarred... and I don't know what I did that was so goddamn awful. I'll tell you something. None of this was my idea. I didn't go looking for the job. Well, that's important. Chapin came to you. You know what? It's funny, but I keep forgetting that you guys knew each other in college. You were friends at SC, you and Chapin. Who else was there? There was me... Dwight... Ziegler... all the USC mafia. And that's when you got involved in meaningless student elections... when you start to try to get your man in so you stuffed ballot boxes and... What's that term you guys use for screwing up the opposition? - Rat-fucking. - That's right. You were just doing the same kind of stuff... when you were out campaigning for President Nixon. Let me tell you something, we did a lot of worse things in college. Look, let me ask you something, Carl. What would you have done if you were just getting out of the army... been away from the real world for four years... didn't know what kind of law you wanted to practice... and one day you get a call from an old friend... asking if you want to go to work for the President of the United States? Chapin was the appointment secretary for Nixon when he called. Yeah. Listen, if those sinister things really happened... I don't think Dwight knew anything about them. He just did what he was told. Told by who? What's the topic for tonight? Rat-fucking. In my day it was simply known as the double-cross. In our present context... it means infiltration of the Democrats. Segretti won't go on the record... but if he would, we know he would implicate Chapin. And that would put you inside the White House. Who? Be specific. How high up? You'll have to find that out for yourself. I don't like newspapers. I don't care for inexactitude... and shallowness. The CREEP slush fund that financed the rat-fucking... we've just about got that nailed down. I don't know how... Did you change cabs? Yeah. Does the FBI know what we know? Does Justice? Why haven't they done anything? If it didn't deal directly with the break-in, they didn't pursue. Who told them not to? Don't you understand what you're on to? - Mitchell knew? - Of course Mitchell knew. Do you think something this size just happens? Haldeman had to know, too. You'll get nothing from me about Haldeman. Segretti said that... Don't concentrate on Segretti. You'll miss the overall. The letter that destroyed the Muskie candidacy... the Canuck letter, did that come from inside the White... You're missing the overall. But what overall? They were frightened of Muskie, and look who got destroyed. They wanted to run against McGovern. Look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people... false press leaks, fake letters. They canceled Democratic campaign rallies. They investigated Democratic private lives. They planted spies, stole documents, and on and on. Now, don't tell me you think this is all the work of little Don Segretti. The FBI and Justice know this? - Carl? - Yeah. Why don't you pick up your messages more often? - Right. You got a cigarette? - Yeah. Who's Pete Teller? I haven't the slightest idea, Carl. I have this whole place to take care of. - Carl? - Yeah, one second. Tell him to leave his phone number next time, all right? Hi, Sally. Listen, do you guys know about the Canuck letter? Yep. I'm sorry, I'm late. I just wanted to make sure you knew who wrote it. What? You mean the letter that sabotaged the Muskie candidacy? All right, come here. When did he tell you this? Gotta tell Bob. - Woodward. - What? One second. Very important... Come here. Tell him what you told me. Here, sit down. Just exactly the way you said it to me, say it to him. Ken Clawson told me he wrote the Canuck letter. The letter that said Muskie was slurring the Canadians. Clawson? The Deputy Director of White House Communications wrote the Canuck letter. - When did he tell you this? - When we were having drinks. - Where were you? - My apartment. - When did you say he told you? - Two weeks ago. What else did he say? He didn't say anything? Come on, you're hedging. You think he said it to impress you to get you to go to bed with him? - Jesus. - No, I want to hear her say it. Do you think he said that to impress you, try to get you to go to bed with him? Why did it take you two weeks to tell us this, Sally? I guess I don't have the taste for the jugular you guys have. You're claiming it was all a misunderstanding? Absolutely. Sally's got it all wrong. I never told her that I wrote that letter. We were just shooting the breeze about the election. She's an awfully good reporter. I don't remember her getting that much wrong before, do you? Look, that's a real bullshit question, Woodward. That is a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas. Listen. One last thing. Do you remember where this shooting the breeze took place? What do you mean, where? I mean, was it a restaurant, or her apartment, or a bar? Now, look. I'd forgotten the entire incident... but it most certainly wasn't in her apartment. - Do you remember when it took place? - I don't have time for this. I'm a busy man. Did you get all that? What did he say about meeting in a bar or restaurant? He said he forgot the entire incident. - That means he didn't deny it. - That's a non-denial denial. Wichita, Kansas? Yeah, he said that's a bullshit question, Woodward... I know what he said. But I'm from Wheaton, Illinois. Hey, Bob, Carl. He's on the phone. - Who? - Clawson. Get over there on line 4 and transcribe this, will you? Four. - Four? - Okay. Yeah. Yes, Ken. Sally, for Christ's sakes, don't tell them I came to your place. Why not? What's wrong with coming over for a drink? You and me? In your apartment? Well? Jesus Christ, you just shot me down. If that appears in the papers that I'm over at your house, having... - Do you know what that does? - No, I don't see why. You don't? You don't? - There's nothing bad about it. - Well, there sure is. This is just incredible. Well, I have a clear conscience. Sally, I have a wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat. She said that he was in her house having drinks. Now, look, I don't care where it happened. What happened is what counts. When we asked him about it, he said he forgot the entire incident. - Yeah? - Ken Clawson on the line. - Ken Clawson on the line. - Jesus. Ken. What's up, kid? Ben, now, look, this whole thing that's going on over there, Ben... I want you to know that I never claimed authorship of the Canuck letter! Says he never wrote the letter. It's some kind of misunderstanding, a confusion, I want you to know... Slow down, Ken. You sound frazzled. Now, Ben, please, listen. If you're going to refer to that alleged conversation with Sally Aiken... you can't print that it took place in her apartment. I have a wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat. ""A wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat"". Right, Ken, right. Yeah. Now, Ken, I don't want to print that you were in Sally's apartment. Thank God. I just want to know what you said in Sally's apartment. - Hello. - Bernstein... I just got a tip from our FBI source. The secret cash fund financed Segretti. - Jesus. - All right. Now, listen. Chapin hired Segretti, we know that. And we know Haldeman hired Chapin. Haldeman has to be the fifth name to control the fund. Sloan knows. We've only got four out of the five who controlled the fund. It has to be Haldeman. I don't think we've got it. We know the fifth is a top White House official. But no one has said it. No one has named Haldeman. - No one's denied it. - That still doesn't prove it was Haldeman. If you go to bed at night and there's no snow on the ground... when you wake up and there's snow on the ground... you can say it snowed during the night, although you didn't see it. But if we can't prove the fifth man is Haldeman, we're wiped out. Everything in that campaign is done with his approval. We know that everybody who works under Haldeman... does so with his knowledge. And everybody is under Haldeman, except the President. Common sense says it's Haldeman. If we go and see Sloan... and we tell him that we know that he named Haldeman to the Grand Jury... Then all we would need to do is have him confirm it. Right. - Want to do it that way? - Yes. Let's go back and see Sloan. We can't go now 'cause he's not home yet. He may not be answering, but he might be there. - Hi. - Please. Listen, we've already written the story. We just need you to define... Deborah's in the hospital and my in-laws are coming... - Two questions? - We understand. Two questions? The cash that financed the Watergate break-in... five men had control of the fund. Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach. We have confirmations on those four. - We just found out Haldeman's the fifth. - I'm not your source on that. We're not asking you to be our source. All we're asking is to confirm it. I'm not your source on Haldeman. Okay, look, when you were questioned by the Grand Jury... You had to name names. - Of course, everything they asked, yes. - Lf they asked you. All right if they... I don't know... Say we wrote a story that said that Haldeman... was the fifth name to control the fund. - Would we be in any trouble? - Would we be wrong? Let me put it this way. I would have no problems if you wrote a story like that. - You wouldn't? - No. - That's okay. Yeah. - Okay. - Oh, you had a baby. - Yes, my wife did. - Little boy or girl? - That's terrific. It's a girl. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - We're sorry to bother you. - Yeah. - Will you give our best to her? - I will. Well, I think that, Woodward, and I am curious of the fact... that the FBI, in its entire inquiry, never talked to the... Or did any inquiries into the second most-powerful man to the President. You don't seem to understand. No, you get nothing about Haldeman out of me. But we don't need to know anything, Joe. Tomorrow we're going with a story on the FBI. Now, what does that mean? And we're going to establish in that story... that you guys just about blew the whole investigation. Oh, no, we didn't miss so much. You didn't know Haldeman had control of the slush fund? Oh, yes, we did. It's all in our files. - Not about Haldeman. - Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman. Look, now, look, I'm very busy. I've got to go put the kids to bed. That's the confirmation right there. Wait a minute, wait a sec. Did he say John? - He said Haldeman. - He said John Haldeman. What the hell difference does it make if he said Isaiah or David? There's only one Haldeman. Yeah, well, Isaiah or David aren't assistants to the President. I don't know, it still feels thin. Christ, I just wish we knew if we could print this. Now wait a minute, we didn't make them do these things... but once they did, they're fair game! Harry, let's go over your sources again. I want to hear it. Sloan told the Grand Jury. He answered everything they asked him. That means there's gotta be a record somewhere. He told the Grand Jury, the FBI confirms. What more do you need? I happen to love this country. You know, we're not a bunch of zanies out to bring it down! Harry, weren't you arguing the opposite way? No, not at all. All right, now hold it. One thing has nothing to do with the other. We're about to accuse Haldeman who only happens to be... the second-most-important man in this country... of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House. It would be nice if we were right. - Have you double-checked your sources? - Jesus. - Bernstein, are you sure on this story? - Absolutely! - Woodward? - I'm sure. I'm not. It still seems thin. Get another source. How many fucking sources do they think we've got? - Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm? - He won't confirm, I told you that. What about the guy in Justice? You can't call him. He's right next to the Grand Jury. - We have no choice. It's trouble. - It's 20 minutes to deadline. I don't even know if I can get him on the phone. - Dr. Kissinger's office. - Deputy General's office, please. Do you know when you expect him back? No, sir. I believe he's left for the evening. If you'd like to leave a message... Oh, could you hold, please? Hi, this is Carl. I'm sorry to disturb you now... but we're going with the story that Haldeman was the fifth man... in control of the fund and they're hassling us here. We've got three confirmations. If you could help us, I'd appreciate it. I won't say anything about Haldeman. Not ever. I understand. We wouldn't want you to do that. We know it's against the law for you to say anything. If there's a way you could warn us to hold on the story, we'd appreciate it. I'd really like to help you, but I can't. Look, I'm going to count to 10, all right? If there's any reason we should hold on the story... hang up the phone before I get to 10. If the story's all right, you just be on the phone after I get to 10, all right? - Hang up, right? - That's right. - You got it? - Yeah. We're straight. All right, I'm going to start counting, okay? - We all right? - Yeah. Okay, I'm counting. One, two... three, four, five... six, seven... eight, nine, ten. You got it straight now? Everything okay? Everything's fine. Woodward! We got it. - He confirmed. - What happened? I said if I get up to 10 and you don't hang up, it's solid. - Did he confirm it? - Absolutely. We've got to tell Bradlee! Bernstein got another source. The guy at Justice confirmed. If there's any doubt, we can run it tomorrow. You don't have to. The story's solid. We're sure of it. I just got off the phone with him. It's gold. Okay, we go with it. Woodstein! - You know what it's about? - No. Sloan, who resigned as campaign treasurer... after the Watergate break-in... showed up for a deposition in the common-cause suit on... disclosure of campaign contributions, and denied naming Haldeman. Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment on testimony before the Grand Jury? I'd like my attorney to answer that question. Gentlemen, the answer is an unequivocal ""no"". Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman in that testimony at all. It is in his testimony that Mr. Sloan acknowledged... - that it was an espionage fund? - No, not at all. Did he mention any use of funds for espionage activity? None, whatsoever. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Sloan expanded his denial to include his statements to the FBI... and to all federal authorities. A short time later at the White House... News Secretary Ronald Ziegler delivered a strong attack... on the Washington Post. Why is the Post trying to do it? You have a man... who is the editor of the Washington Post by the name of Ben Bradlee. I think anyone who would want to honestly assess... what his political persuasions are, would... I think come to the conclusion, quite quickly... that he is not a supporter of President Nixon. I respect the free press. I don't respect the type of journalism... the shabby journalism that is being practiced by the Washington Post. All I know is that the story that ran this morning... is incorrect and it's been so... stated as being incorrect... by not only me, but by the individual... whose Grand Jury, secret Grand Jury testimony... they based their story on. And that individual has denied that he ever so testified. No sooner had Ziegler finished, than the President's campaign manager... Clark MacGregor, met with reporters. Using innuendo... third-person hearsay... unsubstantiated charges, anonymous sources... and huge, scare headlines... the Post has maliciously sought to give the appearance... of a direct connection between the White House and the Watergate. A charge which the Post knows... and half a dozen investigations have found to be false. The hallmark of the Post campaign is hypocrisy... and its celebrated double standard is today visible for all to see. I'm not talking to you about Haldeman or anybody else. - Then what went wrong? - Nothing. Just tell us what went wrong? Didn't you say that the FBI had the information on Haldeman in the files? - No. - Because we have it in the notes... from the conversation we had on the telephone right here. We have to go talk to your boss if you don't talk to us. What the hell are you talking about? I'll deny everything. We're not trying to get anybody into trouble. We're just trying to find out if we made some errors. If we made a mistake, then we'll come off the story. Just tell us if we're wrong. Tell us if we screwed up. I'm not talking about it. I am not talking to you about Haldeman or anybody else. In fact, I can't even be seen talking to either one of you bastards. - What are you afraid of? Who got to you? - Are we being set up? - Are we, Joe? Tell us! - Are we being set up? - Just tell us, we won't print it. - Fuck you. And fuck you! Honest to God, I just don't know. - Oh, I see. - It's in the notes! Yeah, we had another call on a long list and I've got another call, I've gotta go. - Did you mean Bob Haldeman? - Yeah, Bob Haldeman. Jesus, what was our mistake? Maybe there was no mistake. Then they're just setting us up. Then the whole thing was a set-up? And they just hung us. More denunciations. You'll have to make a statement, Ben. One senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes. I knew we had enemies, but I didn't know we were this popular. Wow, look at this. My non-denial denial. Fuck it, let's stand by the boys. Okay. Foreign? All right, here's our headline. Radio Hanoi reports the United States-North Vietnam agreement... for a settlement of the Vietnam War. Woodward, what did you find out? What'd he say? What time is it? - You fell asleep? - God damn it! Over here. You let Haldeman slip away. Yes. You've done worse than let Haldeman slip away. You've got people feeling sorry for him. I didn't think that was possible. In a conspiracy like this... you build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, everybody feels more secure. - You put the investigation back months. - Yes, we know that. And if we're wrong, we're resigning. Were we wrong? You'll have to find that out, won't you? Listen, I'm tired of your chicken-shit games! I don't want hints. I need to know what you know. It was a Haldeman operation. The whole business was run by Haldeman, the money, everything. It won't be easy getting at him. He was insulated. You'll have to find out how. Mitchell started doing covert stuff before anyone else. The list is longer than anyone can imagine. It involves the entire U.S. Intelligence community... FBI... CIA, Justice. It's incredible. The cover-up had little to do with Watergate. It was mainly to protect the covert operations. It leads everywhere. Get out your notebook. There's more. Your lives are in danger. Hi, I finally got Sloan on the phone. Why the hell didn't you tell me over the phone? - Woodward says phones aren't safe. - Can't trust them. - Come on in. - We can't come in, sir. Woodward says there's electronic surveillance. - Surveillance? Who's doing it? - It's being done. People's lives are in danger. Maybe even ours. What happened to that Justice source of yours? I guess I made the instructions too complicated. Because he thought I said ""hang up"" when I just said ""hang on"". - Oh, Jesus! - The story is right. Haldeman was the fifth name to control that fund... - and Sloan would've told the Grand Jury. - Sloan wanted to tell the Jury. - Why didn't he? - Because nobody asked. Nobody asked him. The cover-up had little to do with the break-in. It was to protect covert operations and the covert activities... involving the entire U.S. Intelligence community. Did Deep Throat say that people's lives are in danger? Yes. - What else did he say? - He said everyone is involved. You know the results of the latest Gallup Poll? Half the country never even heard of the word ""Watergate"". Nobody gives a shit. You guys are probably pretty tired, right? You should be. Go on home. Get a nice hot bath, rest up 15 minutes... then get your asses back in gear. We're under a lot of pressure, you know, and you put us there. Nothing's riding on this except the First Amendment of the Constitution... freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country. Not that any of that matters... but if you guys fuck up again, I'm going to get mad. Goodnight. And now, fellow Americans... the Honorable Chief Justice will administer the oath of office... to the President of the United States of America. Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. President, are you ready to take the constitutional oath? If you will place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand... and please repeat after me. ""I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear... ""I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear... ""...that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States... ""...that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States... - ""...and will, to the best of my ability... - ""...and will, to the best of my ability... ""...preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States... ""...preserve and protect and defend the Constitution of the United States... - ""...so help me, God"". - ""...so help me, God"".,  pull that in there. right back to home. let's move it.  yeah, not bad, not bad. okay, let's go for two now. okay, go for the bunt. everybody stay alive. go! 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50. okay, on your back. 20 sit-ups. come on. hit the deck.  and one, two, three,  four, five, six,  seven...  temperature today is expected to hit 78. and in downtown l.a., they're expecting... ten, eleven... come on, keep up...     19 and 20.  go!  hey, way to go, chris!  thanks, mister.  get it in there! come on, fellas! talk it up! i'm going to go around the infield, then around the outfield. you got it? okay. move! charge the ball! let's go! fire it in there! around the infield now! we'll do it around the infield, then around the outfield.  hey, buttermaker. what the hell took you so long? i had three pools to clean. uh, you know my son toby, right? hi, buttermaker. this little guy is going to be a great ballplayer. i really appreciate this. it's a shame that none of the fathers have the time for it. if i wasn't so busy down at city hall... you got my check, whitewood? check? uh, son, why don't you get your bike off the car? yeah. wow! i thought we were going to be quiet about the money. oh, yeah. sorry. it's going to be rough, buttermaker. you just got one week till the first game. i wanted to introduce you to some of the administrators... you forgot to sign the check. check is not signed. oh. helps, right? you ask around for a woman they call cleveland. she'll get things set for you. here. here's a list of the boys on the team. don't let any of these bastards give you a hard time. put that away. hang in there.  how about a ride home?  race you back to the dugout! you know, i think we're doing a really fine thing. yeah. dad said you played pro ball. yeah. i thought you just cleaned swimming pools. says you were really great once. that's nice of him.   hey! hey! get that bike off the field! i said get it off the field! you're marking it up. excuse me. sorry he yelled at your boy. that's not my boy. my husband's uptight about the infield. he sometimes yells. jill, honey. hey, jill, honey. my name is buttermaker. i'm coach of the new team. i'm looking for miss cleveland. she's in the equipment room. it's straight ahead. goddamn class-action suits are gonna be the ruin of this country. it wasn't so bad when the courts made us take girls. at least the ones that came could play, but now this. this equipment's kind of had it, miss. you're damn right, mr. buttermaker. this is normally a six-team league, not seven. you're gonna have to be happy with what's left. look, buttermaker, the problem is your friend whitewood. he could have got those boys in any of the other leagues. why did he sue this one? we're different than the other leagues, and he knows it. we run a highly competitive program here. i mean, it's highly competitive. want to know something? it's not us. it's the boys. it's the boys themselves that want it that way. buttermaker, new rule book. see that you memorize it. you got, uh, not even an hour to practice on that field. good luck, huh? when i say your name, step forward and tell me what position you want to play. - rudi stein. - pitcher. um, can i play p... sure. regi tower. i got a pretty good arm. my father said for me to play infield. mr. buttermaker, i'm on your team. last year, i was playing baseball... i'm tower... for the first time... my dad's been a yankee fan all his life. he never heard of no buttermaker who ever played for the yankees let alone pitched a no-hitter! i don't know who you are, but sit down and shut up. can i play second or third base? the situation with the glasses is... forget about the glasses. all right, guys, let's get one thing straight. i was a heck of a ballplayer, but i never pitched for the yankees... you never played in the major leagues. but you did pitch for phoenix in the minors. in 1951, you won nine games, lost six, had 170 strikeouts, and had an e.r.a. of 2.86. good work, kid. ahmad abdul raheem. ahmad abdul raheem. here. what position do you want to play? i want to switch hit like my big brothers. and i want to play where hank aaron played. right field. aaron played right field. then right field. he also played quite a few games on second base. then second base. mike engelberg. my dad thinks i should try out for catcher. he can play third and short at the same time. keep it up, whitewood! if you wanna get ""kung-fued."" shut up, tubs!  timmy luppus... all right, all right...  timmy luppus.  lupus. crud. does that booger-eatin' spaz make me want to puke. what do you want to play, luppus?  lupus. he's shy, coach. shy, my butt. he's an idiot. shut up, tanner. he's just quiet. timmy and i could do a fine job sharing right field. let's not talk anymore about it. everybody out on the field and take any position you want. we'll figure out where you play later. could timmy and i play right field? anyplace at all. just get out there. just shut up and get out there. let's go, boys. mister, uh, buttermaker, i think my dad said something about these two boys were mexican. they don't speak any english. all right, let's get one. hey, can't you hold off of that until after practice? there's energy in chocolate. i need energy. oh. all right, let's get one.  damn it, regi! attack that ball. pay attention out there. it was right at me. attack it! all right. get one.  look alive.   oh! how could you?  hey, engelberg. what? there's chocolate all over this ball. look, mr. buttermaker, quit bugging me about my food. people are always bugging me about it. my shrink says that's why i'm so fat. you're not doing me any good so just quit it! okay, okay, okay. all right, look alive. let's get one. are you ready? let's get one out there. engelberg? what? that is a bunt... b-u-n-t. the catcher is supposed to pick up the bunt... and throw it to first base. how was i supposed to know? you made such a big deal yelling out to them. diversionary tactic, engelberg. now get the ball. why are you always picking on me? what did i do to you? quit your bellyaching and throw the ball to first base!   estupido. don't blame me. i didn't even know it was your car. it's dumb, parking it so close to the field anyway. all right, boys. let's get back to basics. this is a baseball. the object of the game is to keep the baseball... within the confines of the playing field. wait a minute! you don't think we know what a ball is? i don't think i like that kind of talk. he's been in enough fights this week already. we keep playing like this, we'll be the laughingstock of the league. what do you expect? all we got on this team... is a bunch of jews, spics, niggers, pansies, and a booger-eating moron. tanner, you should be reminded from time to time... that you're one of the few people on this team... who's not a jew, spic, nigger, pansy, or booger-eating moron. so you better cool it, or we may be disposed to beat the crap out of you. - oh, yeah? - yeah. cut it out! now, guys, somebody's gonna pay for this windshield. and i think, engelberg, it's gonna be your father. bullshit.  come on, babe. we were supposed to be here by 7:30. isn't that something? it looks like a baseball field. they did a nice job, didn't they? i had them leave off the anchovies... because i didn't know whether to use them as bats or the baseline. besides, most people don't like the taste of anchovies. i don't like them. you see? carol, where is frank? is he still practicing? of course. you got to keep after him. you all look terrific. all right, everybody be patient! pizza's on very, very soon.  jill, i'm getting ready for the slide show. glad you could make it. i wouldn't miss it for the world. we have one of these every year. it helps to get things off on a friendly note. after the start of the season, we all don't always get along so well. well, how are the uniforms coming along? what? the uniforms. your team uniforms. hey, buttermaker, you better get on the ball. all the best colors have been taken... green and white, blue and white, red and white, maroon and white, white and maroon. uniforms? hey, whitewood. what's this crap about uniforms? what do you mean crap? i've been meaning to ask... you're paying me to coach. you told me i'd be coaching some kids just a couple of hours a day. i've got a lot of pools to clean. i can't be out looking for uniforms. will you be quiet for a minute? you've been hired as a manager, right? yeah. one of the responsibilities of being a manager... is to get a sponsor and to get uniforms. wait. no. you didn't tell me that. i'm telling you now. it's easy. you go around to these different businesses and you talk to the guys. they all like baseball. how could you possibly strike out ted williams? i had a mother of a screwball. he means ted williams was a major leaguer. you never got past the minors. it was spring training, vero beach, florida. struck him out a couple of times. you're not supposed to have open liquor in the car. it's against the law. so is murder, engelberg. now put that back before you get me into real trouble. if you were so great, how come you never made it to the major leagues? contract disputes. when are we gonna get our uniforms? i'm working on it. hey, ahmad, even hank aaron peels the old eyelids before he takes a swing. maybe i should try left-handed. no. not just yet. when are we going to get our uniforms? i'm working on it. all the other kids got their uniforms. when are we gonna get ours? you worry about your hitting. let me worry about the uniforms. my hat fell in. dummy. oh, god. you too? how's the vacuuming coming, toby? not enough suction. just move it back and forth. it will come. when we're through, can we go swimming? don't jump in, engelberg. you'll flood the valley. how's it going, ogilvie? well, there's not enough pressure, but i'm adjusting the intake valve now. you got a hell of a future in pools, kid. where have you been, you crud? it's been an hour. i've been out getting what you creeps have been bitching for... uniforms. best pitch i ever taught her was the curveball. how could you teach a 9-year-old girl to throw a curveball? not only a curveball, but the most tantalizing knuckler you ever saw. this thing was a thing of beauty. it came up to the plate and disappeared. it was like a ball of melted ice cream. here. thank you, luppus. lupus. lupus. sorry. ahh. that's superb. thank you very much. tell us about the time you struck out ted williams again. ted williams, 1947, vero beach, florida, spring training, around march 15th. score was tied nothing to nothing. it was the top of the ninth. no. it was the bottom of the ninth.  bases were loaded. there was old ted coming up to the plate,  swinging a menacing bat. ""strike one."" what's the matter? come on. let's keep playing. he might be hurt. i think he's dead. he's not dead! he's drunk! had enough beer. what a mess. a lot of smoking too. what do we do? nothing. he ain't any good to us sober either. opening day's tomorrow. we don't know what the batting order is. we don't even have our positions set. all we got is a cruddy ""alky"" for a manager.  come on, red. let's straighten your hat there. engelberg, how about buttoning those buttons on your uniform, will you? i been trying all morning. it's too small. well, come on. look neater, you know.  ladies and gentlemen, i want to welcome you here to the opening game of the season. what i want is to see every boy in america... out on the baseball field playing the great game of baseball. thank you. well, uh, this is the moment we've been waiting for. it's opening day. now, i'd like to call your attention to our new scoreboard... named in memory of tommy martin... look out! get back!  que pasa? get off the field!  hey! all right, come here! let's go! let's go! you little punk, you just... what were you doing, you little punk? i'll deck that kid! you'll have to get rid of the bike! uh, what was i... oh, yes, the new scoreboard in memory of tommy...  tommy martin.  and, uh, well...  after the taking of the team pictures today, parents and friends are encouraged to stay... for the game between the bears and yankees. come on, indians. line up. a second game will begin at 3:00 this afternoon. we urge you to return at that time... to see the athletics against the mets. mr. buttermaker! they're taking the team pictures! i want you to look like champions... because you're going to be champions. stand up straight and look at them. that's it, boys. you got that champion look about you. come on! quick! he's going to take the picture! hey, my uniform's too small. ah, shut up. take the picture! okay, boys, come on, straighten up. big grins. come on. look at the birdie!  smile! smile! smile!  that's it. that's perfect. thank you. what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming o'er the rockets' red glare the bombs bursting in air gave proof through the night that our flag was still there oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave  play ball! batter up!  first in the yankee lineup today, andy berger, number seven, center field. come on, baby! take two of them!  you got to tag him, dummy!  what are you doing?  joey turner, number two, pitcher. here we go. let's go, joey!  let's go, joey! hey, left fielder, throw it in! come on in, joey!  don jacobsen, second base.  all right! i got a bead on it! where's our shortstop? aren't you the shortstop? was that an error? it's an error on the throw, but no error on the infielder...

okay, hurry it up, though. you got it. hey, turner. yeah? what do you say we call this thing off? this is getting ridiculous. they're going to call it off in 15 minutes anyway so let me give you a little advice. let your team stay out there. they'll be able to say they didn't give up. and you won't make quitters out of them. i'm calling this off right now. i was just thinking of your boys, that's all. the hell you were. the hell i wasn't. what i saw out there today made me sick, you know that? your team has no right being on that field. look at yourself, ""butterworth."" look at that team. i mean, why don't you do this league a favor? you and the bears just drop out. i mean it. i mean just... just drop out. i mean it. it's a forfeit. we forfeit the game. you forfeit? yeah. that's it! that's the game! forfeit by the bears!  come on in, fellas!  the remainder of this game has been canceled... by the request of the bears' manager and forfeited to the yankees. next up, the athletics and the mets. up the alley, down the street, who's the hardest team to beat? bears! bears! yay! well, guys, it ain't so bad. i was once in a high-school game where the score... come on, guys, will you? it's only a game. hey, nice try, bears. maybe next time you'll get a chance to bat. hey, tanner! come down, tanner! get down from there. forget about that. now, sit down. i want to talk to you. i'm not listening to you, crud. i'm leaving. sit down, tanner. ta... hey, wait a minute. where are you guys going? mr. buttermaker, i got to talk to you! wait a minute. it's important! i got to talk to you! what do you want? ahmad's up a tree. says he's not coming down. ahmad? yeah. what do you mean, climbed up a tree? says he's not coming down. tell his family about it. said if i told them where he was, he'd kill me. and anyway, i promised him i wouldn't. how's the view up there, ahmad? hey. how come you're not wearing your clothes? don't deserve to wear no uniform. you get away from here, buttermaker. this ain't your tree. anybody can climb up here. just leave me alone. keeping your family waiting, you know. can't face them. why? what do you mean, why? errors, that's why. easy fly balls. there's nothing easy about those fly balls, ahmad. they were tough chances. the sun was in your eyes. don't give me any of your honky bullshit, buttermaker. i know they were easy. let's not bring race into this, ahmad. we got enough problems as it is. anyway, your brothers will understand. no, they won't. they would never make flubs like that. they were all big athletes. when they were my age, they were captains of all their teams... and great players, and i'm not. i'm lousy at football, basketball and baseball. i'm quitting the whole damn thing. thank god hank aaron didn't act like this. what? don't give me that ""what."" you know what i'm talking about. what are you talking about? the 42 errors. 42 errors? come off it, will you, ahmad? stop pulling my leg. you know what i'm talking about. you know all about hank aaron. his first year in sandlot ball, he committed 42 errors. he was 9 years old. broke his little heart. he damn near quit. thank god for us he didn't. there'd be no great old number 44. buttermaker, you're so full of... it's common knowledge, for crying out loud! ask ogilvie. i'm surprised you didn't know that. he's your favorite player too. well.  kind of ruins my plans. i was thinking around the fourth game, you'd be switch-hitting. i figured with your speed and right side of the plate, those few extra steps you get, you'd be a tough out. you know, bunts, things like that. i am kind of fast, huh? you're very fast.  at present there are at least two to three instances... of cardiac arrest or heart seizure at every major sports event at the coliseum... you're two and a half hours late. i told you to meet me in my office. i couldn't find it. jesus. i couldn't believe that score... 26-0. what a beating! my son wouldn't come out of his room all weekend. that's why i want to disband the team. have you told the boys yet? not yet. i was hoping to sneak away from the office this afternoon and drop by the field. actually, it might be better if you told them yourself. i mean, they really do like you. and, uh, i'd appreciate it. what if the boys don't want to quit? that's not important. this has been very humiliating. we've put these boys in a situation they just can't handle. i hope you think that's fair. mr. harrison is here with his 2:30 appointment... about the police academy bill. would you sign these first? i know this has all been my fault. i just want to end it as quickly as possible. good-bye, buttermaker.   i know it says $1.25 on the map, but what it really is is $2.00 because of inflation. hey, boilermaker, long time no see. hey, pretty fancy neighborhood you're working these days, amanda. coming up in the world, huh? what are you doing here? i didn't have any pools to clean, so i thought i'd drop by and say hello. how's your mom? fine. what's it to you? is that the way to talk to me? i haven't seen you in two or three years. if you're looking for money, you can forget it. i'm not looking for money. i'm not looking for anything. be sociable, for crying out loud. hey, what's that? what's what? it's a mitt. what? that. oh, yeah. i thought if you weren't too busy, maybe you'd like to play catch. no, thanks. no? well, it was just an idea. i mean, it's... er, er, uh... - how's your fastball these days? - why? well, to tell you the truth, i'm coaching a bunch of kids some baseball. maybe if you're not doing anything, you can drop by the field. maybe join the team for old times' sake. i knew you were up to something. i'm through with pitching. my mom says you almost ruined me with that sports stuff. - how did i ruin you? - that fastball put my arm in a sling. it's a fine way to act toward me. i figure you owe me a thing or two. 0we you a thing or two? i was like a father to you. ha! some father. didn't i take you to all the ball games? you'd have gone to them anyway. didn't i take you horseback riding? didn't i take you and your mother to the movies twice a week? didn't i pay for your math tutor? the math tutor guy was a drunk like you. i got a ""d"" in math that year. didn't i let you hang around while i cleaned the pools? while you cleaned the pools? who you trying to kid? i'm the one who did all the work. you sat there and drank your beer all day. by the fourth pool, you were out cold. i had to call my mom to come pick us up. what about your appendix? who rushed you to the hospital? who saved your life? would you be alive if it weren't for me? yeah, but when you weren't saving people's lives, you were sitting around the apartment drunk. then you just split. you made my mother sick. you know, she wanted to marry you. boy, was she dumb. your mother and i didn't get along too well, amanda. i liked her very much though. i still do, matter of fact. i'm just not the marrying kind. i guess i handled it badly, huh? you handled it like shit! hey, don't use that kind of language... you can't tell me what kind of language i can use. yes, i can! if you're gonna talk that way in front of me... look, boilermaker. you're not my father, and i ain't interested in playing baseball for you anymore. so why don't you get back into that sardine can... and go vacuum the bottom of the pacific ocean? i've got business to take care of. you're blocking my customers with your car. all right, boys. let's go. up. everybody up. practice. come on! all right, all right. i'm an asshole. go ahead and yell. get it off your chests. i deserve it. we really appreciate these new uniforms, buttermaker, but we're not going to be needing them anymore. we've been taking a lot of razzing in school about opening day, and... and they were laughing at us, picking on us. anyway, we took a vote and decided that we'd quit. what the hell happened to you, tanner?  tanner got into a fight because of it. who with? the seventh grade. what? the seventh grade. you took on the whole seventh grade? you want to quit, tanner? crud, no. i want to play ball. i can understand how you guys feel. i haven't been much of a manager... or much of anything else, for that matter. and i'm sorry. but this quitting thing... it's a hard habit to break once you start. you're a damn good bunch of boys. you probably deserved a lot better than me, but we're stuck with each other. jimmy, grab a bat. engelberry, get your gear on, get behind home plate. what for? we need to practice. but we disbanded the team. we took a vote. goddamn it! nobody's vote counts around here but mine! get your gear on and get your fat ass behind the plate before i kick it up there. and the rest of you pansy-ass quitters, move your asses before i kick them all. we got a game with the athletics next wednesday, and that means only one thing... bad news for the athletics! oh, no, no, no. you're dragging your right foot, jimmy. you got to plant it. here, i'll show you. right here. just plant it. make sure it stays there. okay. let's look alive out there. let's look alive. way to go, jimmy! good hit! way to go! no, tanner, no! everybody watch this. you get down on your left knee there, so if you miss the ball, it hits your body, you can still make the play. up, everybody. all right, engelberry, hit it again. that's it! that's the way to do it! you see how easy it is? you see how simple that is? you just get down on your left knee. you miss the ball, it hits your body. you still make the play. you understand? okay, let's do it again.  a busted bat and a long fly ball... any day now durocher will call! ooh! shit! ow! any second now... it'll be... heart-attack time. i'll send flowers to your funeral. must have... sustenance. couldn't you at least have unwrapped it? i got it! i got it! good move! ""butterworth."" hello, roy. what's your boys doing out in the field? getting ready for a game with the athletics. the athletics? haven't you heard? councilman whitewood told the league committee he's calling it quits. he is. we aren't. what are you, one of those sadists or something? didn't those kids take enough of a beating on opening day? what the hell you trying to do? win the pennant. this schedule says that on the last day of the season, june 19th, the two best teams play for the title. we intend to be one of those teams. be a lot of fun if you were the other. two hands, engelberg, two hands! all right, guys. i want to see some hard-nosed play out there. now, everybody, once more with feeling. first base! second base! do we have to do that one? it's so corny. come on, listen to me. once more with feeling. first base! second base! third base! home! around them bases we shall roam! come on, batter! check the big play! batter can't hit! batter... swing! ball four! take your base. go home! home! go home! here! home! go home! all the way home! go home! out! crud! come on! catch it! who do we appreciate? bears! bears! yay! all right, come on, guys, lighten up. we finished the whole game, didn't we? tanner almost got a base hit in the fourth inning. i thought you were safe, tanner. come on, fellas. rome wasn't built in a day. yeah. it took several hundred years. we lost 18-0, ""buttercrud."" and the athletics are the worst team in the league. second worst. sorry, i forgot. snap out of it! nobody said it was going to be easy. don't look so glum. well, we committed 24 errors. their pitcher threw a no-hitter against us. but there is some good news. two of our runners... almost managed to get to first base, and we did hit 17 foul balls. that's right. that's the spirit! cokes and hot dogs on me. yeah! this way. buttermaker, i said i wasn't interested. there's nothing to be afraid of. i'm not afraid. i'm just through with all that tomboy stuff. baseball's not tomboy stuff. it's your country's national pastime. it's healthy. it's a lot healthier than sitting around here on a stupid street corner selling dumb maps to a bunch of ignorant hicks. look at that gut on you. i beg your pardon. there isn't an ounce of fat on me. there will be if you keep sitting around here. this is sure a lousy job you got. it ain't lousy. half the state of iowa came by last week. cleared 85 bucks. bet it's more than you make. you saving any of that money? of course i am. what are you going to do with it? i'm going to get braces. i'm going to be taking ballet lessons pretty soon. i'm... i'm going to be a model. well, now we're getting somewhere. i'll tell you what... you come and pitch a few games for us, i'll pay for the modeling thing and the ballet lessons. can't do anything about the braces 'cause that's big money. buttermaker, you're so dumb. those boys aren't rough. you won't get hurt. that's got nothing to do with it. i'm almost 12, and i'll... i'll be getting a bra soon. well, maybe in a year or so. i can't be playing no dumb baseball. you're right. you're absolutely right. you're turning into a regular little lady. it was a dumb idea anyway. i mean, you wouldn't have helped the team much. you were great when you were nine, but girls reach their peak athletically about that age. probably haven't picked up a ball in two years anyway. give my love to your mom. don't be such a stranger. hey, boilermaker. yeah? got my curve breaking 2 1/2 feet. oh, yeah? then you have been practicing, huh? but don't give me no baloney... about a curve breaking 2 1/2 feet, though. for how much? ten bucks. make it 20. we got a bet. i thought we were going to see some curves. okay, the next one's coming right between your eyes. twelve ballet lessons. nine ballet lessons. they're $3.00 a shot. i can't... twelve ballet lessons or no go. i just lit that cigar. that's terrible. make it nine ballet lessons... i want the imported kind of jeans. jeans? yes. french jeans. i'm not getting you any jeans. you know how many pools i got to clean to get imported jeans? what's the matter with american jeans? i don't like them. who do you think you are, catfish hunter? who's he? boys, i'd like you to meet your new pitcher... amanda whurlizer. jews, spics, niggers, and now a girl? grab a bat, punk. jimmy feldman, toby whitewood. toby! yeah! right. sixth. no, you're seventh. seventh.  first up for the mets... roy close, number seven, left field. come on, amanda. right through him! strike.  come on, mandy! strike three! you're out! ohh!  now batting for the mets... david delmardo. what's she doing now with the... ah, that's the, uh... that's the spitter. wets... wets her fingers, you see. then she appears to dry them on her cap, but she's not 'cause she has vaseline under there. strike three! you're out! strike three! you're out! take it easy on the first few batters. i want to see how our infield handles balls.  carl paranski, number six... the cool, calm paranski shift! you're holding up the game. let's get back in the box.  forget it, forget it. forget it, miguel. no. strike three!  come on, guys! pay attention! they can't win if they don't score!  nice work, engelberg. good game. nice going, tanner. two, four, six, eight! who do we appreciate? bears! bears! toby, jose, timmy... lupus, you dumb spaz, we would have won if it weren't for you! come on, leave him alone. will you cut that out? let's not have any shoving. now cut that out! move over. all i know is, when we win a game, it's a team win. when we lose a game, it's a team loss. now, on friday, we play the white sox. now, what does that mean to you guys?  bad news for the white sox! damn right. look alive out there. let's look alive. i got it! no, you don't! it's over the fence! hey! hey, punk!  i thought i...  i thought i told you to quit hanging around! jumpin' catfish! what a great arm! who is that kid, anyway? of course he's got a great arm. he's the best athlete in the area. but you don't understand... that's kelly leak. you guys talking about kelly leak? yeah. that dude is a bad mother. you're talking about a loan shark. i borrowed a nickel from him last week. he said if i didn't give him a dime by friday, he'd break my arm. es un bandido. i don't know what he's talking about, but i like him. he's got balls. why screw around guys? if the guy can play ball, he can play ball. let's get him on the team.   want to go again? no. anybody else? saw you throw the ball the other day. got a great arm. so-so. we could use a good outfielder on our team. you call what you got a team? what you got against baseball anyway? the baseball you guys play is for faggots and old farts... who don't have anything better to do with themselves. you must like those kind of guys. you sure do hang around the field often enough. there's nice ass at the field. that's why i hang around there. i hear you like to gamble. we go a dollar a game here. serve it. i don't want to play for money. if i win, you play baseball for the bears. - and if i win? - name it.  well, how did it go? i lost. what? you said you were supposed to be so good at those games. i am, he's just better at it! that's the last time i ever listen to you. 8:00 friday night. what's that? nothing. what's 8:00 friday night? i lost that game, so i gotta go to the rolling stones concert with the creep. that's the most ridiculous thing i ever heard of. 11-year-old girls don't go out on dates. of course they do. where you been? they don't go out with people like that. boy, you take the cake. first you blow the game, then you get roped into a date with an ex-con. you're like a chimney. i'm sick of it. start the car, and let's go. probably lost on purpose. you probably like the little baboon. blow it out your bunghole! what if he tries something, uh... i'll handle it. rolling stones. 11 years old. i know an 11-year-old girl who's on the pill. don't ever say that word again. jesus, just who in the heck do you think you are? your goddamn manager, that's who. big wow. lupus, could you go somewhere else while i'm eating? you make me sick. cripes. hey, lupus, man, how's it going? give it! what do you need it for? you hardly ever play anyways. sit down. we was only kidding anyways. ha ha ha ha! that looks neat, man. we ought to do that to all the bears. they might play better.  hey, joey, you hungry? you want my burrito? i wouldn't eat your burrito if you paid me to. aw, go on. take it. that's the best way to eat it. you little... i'm going to kill you! i'm going to knock your head down so far you're gonna have to take off your hat! i'm going to beat the crud out of you. i'll take on all the yankees after this. i'm going to kick your butt, you little shit. you owe me 30 cents for that burrito. you little shit. that's one bear down, 11 to go. come to think of it, they ain't worth it. thanks. nobody ever stuck up for me before. well, lupus, if you wiped your nose once in a while, people wouldn't give you so much crud all the time.  how many times you got to be told to quit hanging around here? i'm just sitting here. this field is for ballplayers, not for juvenile delinquents. i can play baseball better than anybody in this league. it's a shame we're never going to find that out. nobody here wants anything to do with you. now get the hell out of here. come on, get out of here.  there's something i forgot to tell you guys... it's a league rule. cups and supporters...  do we have to? got to be worn at all times. que es esto? they're very uncomfortable. well, either you wear them, or you don't play. can we stop this already? we got another hour of practice. no me voy a poner esto. esto duele. what? what are you saying? i've been brushing up on my spanish of late, and i think he's saying something about his being a catholic and it's a sin. oh, for christ's sake. it's not a gas mask. i know what it is. this is a free country. let's be democratic and take a vote. - there will be no vote, engelberg. - what about amanda? you ain't strapping one of these things on me. if she don't wear one, i don't wear one. yeah! yeah! yeah!  anyway, it's too small. if she doesn't wear one, neither do i. what are you doing here? some asshole changed my mind. a little harder, huh? who's this turkey think he is, mickey mantle? rifle one. they win one lousy game, next thing you know, they'll sue for the right to play in dodger stadium.  engelberg! engelberg! did you take my hamburger? no! hey, would you shut up? right on my punch line. i pledge allegiance to the flag... of the united states of america... and to the republic for which it stands... one nation, under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. i just get an eight count here. i know, but it's okay. i got the whole thing figured out. this is what i do. i take my two outfielders, henry and thor, play them right and left center. oh, would you stop it! you're embarrassing yourself. three of my white sox have got the flu. i've got a goddamn little jesus freak in bakersfield at a revival meeting. i am sorry! the white sox are gonna have to forfeit the game. it's a forfeit. the white sox have to forfeit. all right! two, four, six, eight! who do we appreciate? white sox! white sox! yay! can't this thing go any faster? sure.  would you look at that? i can't help it. i really hate that kid. out! out! shit! he's out. uhh!  stop it! somebody's hurt!  ow. right in the balls. hey, give him some air. come on, now. get back to the dugout. he got hit in the balls. cleveland! stretcher! a stretcher for his balls? let him stretch out. that must hurt. buttermaker, do i have to go? no. we're just going to get you checked out. no. i want to go play. we have to check you. it's a sensitive area. i want to play.  don't worry. you'll play. buttermaker, you better start worrying... about your team finishing the season in one piece... instead of trying to get in the play-offs. i just pray he's wearing his cup.  one, two, two, two, three, two, four, two, ready to go back. one, two, two, two, three, two, four, two, ready to go back. one, two, two, two, three, two, four, two, ready to go back. one, two, two, two, three, two, four, two, and bow. very good. very good. would you like a piece of chicken? would you turkeys blow on out of here? i will not allow this! engelberg, the white sox beat the mets! we're talking championships. young man, i am teaching a class here. you ain't doin' a very good job of it. no one here can dance worth bat turds. tanner, get the hell out of here! i will kill you! out! go!  i'm hitting .841. i'm on the bears. you live around here? i got a harley-davidson. does that turn you on... harley-davidson? i don't have to remind you who we'll be playing in the championship tomorrow... after we beat these athletics today. i got one last question. let's see who can answer it. what does this game mean to the athletics? ahmad? it means a hell of a lot of badass losin' for the athletics. let's go! kelly. kelly. i want you handling the ball as much as possible out there today. this game is too damn important for us. any ball you get near, go for it. way to go!  and so, at the top of the third inning, the bears are leading 1-0 over the athletics. hey, tanner, does he go to the bathroom for you too? hey! tanner!  now batting, tom mckay, number ten, third base. what you doing? sorry. we got nine men out here, you know? yeah. okay.  batting for the athletics, keith mirron, number three, left field.  going into the last half of the sixth and last inning, the score is tied two and two. when i give you an order, i expect you to follow it. you're up first this inning. grab yourself a goddamn bat. let's get the run back. and now batting for the bears, number three, kelly leak. strike! strike two! that was a ball, you stupid ump! again? 0-2, and stein is up next. time. what's the matter with you? what are you doing? you trying to win this thing or not? i'll put miguel in. at least he'll try. just get out of here and let me hit, coach. all right. let's go!  that's the way to go. kelly! congratulations. give me ten!  we have the final score. bears... three runs, four hits, three errors. athletics... two runs, five hits... see you tomorrow at the big game. thank you. i was really scared for a minute there. he's just a rotten ball hog. yeah. i'll see you tomorrow. does anybody want to go for a ride?

after that, we're going to the drive-in movie. it's a double feature. let's play it by ear, see how things go tomorrow. please don't try to blow it. she wasn't too keen on it at first. i had to work hard to get it set up. yeah. i bet you did. i don't think it's a very good idea, amanda. no excuses, boilermaker. it's all fixed and i'm paying, so you can't cry poor. yes, but listen... last sunday i made a killing. a guy wanted to wallpaper his bathroom... and bought 35 maps. amanda, you know damn well that your mother and i don't get along. so we're not going to dinner or a movie or anywhere else together. do you understand? just keep your elbow in the water. then just you and i will go. yeah, right. you and i will take the whole team out and get some hamburgers. well, i was just thinking us. just us, no outsiders. well, then, maybe we could go horseback riding or something, or maybe to a matinee. yeah. we'll see. how does it feel? why do you always change the subject? you're always pulling that number. the subject is your arm. you're pitching tomorrow. but what about after tomorrow? after tomorrow, we do what all ballplayers do... we shake hands till we see each other next season, then we go fishing or hunting, make some personal appearances, get to know the wife and kids again. i don't have a wife and kids. neither do i, but i got my pools to clean. you got your maps to sell and your ballet to learn. i could help you with your pools. cut it out, amanda. no, it wouldn't be like you're taking me anywhere. it would be like work. you could use the help. no, i couldn't! and besides, you shouldn't be wasting your time cleaning pools. look, amanda, you're a terrific kid. you shouldn't be hanging around with me. i'm an old, broken-down, third-rate ballplayer. i like to drink too much. i like to smoke my cigars without anybody bothering me, including you. i'm happy that way. i'm a bum. no, you're not. you taught me how to pitch. goddamn it! can't you get it through your thick head i don't want your company? if i did, i would have looked you up two years ago. did you ever think of that? if that's the way you feel, fine.  hi, amanda.  will children under the age of 18... please don't occupy the seats in the stands... until all the adults are seated. ogilvie. hey, kelly. hey, ahmad. you, me and tanner will play three-way. does anybody mind if i warm up too? we didn't think you needed anybody but yourself to play catch with. just cool it, runt. hey! hey, hey, hey! what the hell is going on here? what the hell's the matter with you? kelly's a crud. he's been hogging the ball in all these games and we're sick of it. he's not the only reason we got this far. well, he's most of the reason. just shut up! if you played better, he wouldn't have to cover up for you. look, woman, don't you be telling us how to play. yeah! let that turkey loose. i'll chew his ears off and stick them back in his face. you're acting like a bunch of babies! now, cut it out. nobody has to worry anymore because i'm quitting. no, you're not. you came this far. you're going the rest of the way. if it's yesterday you're worried about, blame me. i'm the one who told kelly to cover for you. why? ""why?"" what do you mean, why? we're in the championship, aren't we? well, that's what you wanted, wasn't it? now, just behave yourselves and act like men. come on. the yankees have got the field now. let's get back to the dugout. i'm not gonna talk about winning. i'm gonna talk about losing. 'cause if you guys lose this game, each and every one of you, you're going to have to live with it. you're about the best team i ever coached. play a good game. first up for the yankees, number one, chris love, left field. put 'em down in order... one, two, three.  come on! you want to win, don't you?

we're playing clean, hard baseball. you call spiking an 11-year-old girl... spiking? the umpire called it safe. my team plays by the book. all right, pus-head. you got any crying to do, cry to the umpire. get back to your dugout. maybe your team could use your help, but i doubt it. all right, eddie! you guys play by the book, i know you do. one ball, two strikes, one out! strike three! you're out of there. joe, you better pitch better than you're hitting. or i'm gonna take you right out. turner, she's going to ram it down your throat! andy, what the hell's the matter with you? unless you can play ball, you go on home!  you run out every hit! i don't care if he had you beat by a mile! ball. way to go, ahmad. he's going to walk you. he can't find the plate. way to go! and now batting for the bears, number three, kelly leak, center field. what the hell is the matter with you?

i don't want to get hurt. all right. but you want to win the game. yeah. engelberg is up after you. we need runs. he's been murdering the ball lately. do as i tell you. let's get on, rudi. ball one. that's the way to take it. ball one. let's get on, rudi. take your base. rudi, take your base, boy. everybody moves! everybody! come on. let's get a hit, engelberg. well, well, well, if it isn't ""engelpuke."" how would you like me to stick this bat where the sun never shines?

you in love with that ball or something?  end of the first inning. the bears lead 2-1 over the yankees.  safe. what? he was out by a mile. what, do you think you got to kiss ass around here... because they been here longer than us? there's two teams here, umpire. two teams, not one. don't turn your back on me. what, are you a friend of roy turner's? you going to call like that all day, let us know now. we may as well go home. get a pair of glasses. stein, same thing. no. i don't want to. stein, we're still in the game. this hurts. i don't like it. you don't have to get hit in the back. get hit in the arm or legs. don't make it obvious. go ahead. rudi stein, number ten. james henry won't take curveballs. buttermaker, you better take amanda out now. she's hurting pretty bad. yeah, i know, but she wants to play. if you don't take her out, she'll throw her arm out. - who's managing this team, you or me?

what did they do, give him a six-pack before the game? mr. buttermaker, i don't know about you, but i want to win, so don't send me in. listen, lupus, you didn't come into this life... just to sit around on a dugout bench, did you?

America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend, not an Italian. She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. I didn't protest. Two months ago he took her for a drive with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted, she kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal. When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain. But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life. Beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again. Sorry. I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, but suspended the sentence. Suspended the sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. Those two bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, "" For justice, we must go to Don Corleone. "" VITO: Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do. What is that? (WHISPERING) I want them dead. That I cannot do. I'll give you anything you ask. I've known you many years, but this is the first time you've asked for help. I can't remember the last time you invited me for a cup of coffee. Even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And you were afraid to be in my debt. BONASERA: I didn't want to get into trouble. I understand. You found Paradise in America. You made a good living, had police protection and there were courts of law. You didn't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say, "" Don Corleone, give me justice. "" But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. You come on my daughter's wedding day and ask me to murder for money. BONASERA: I ask you for justice. That is notjustice. Your daughter is alive. Let them suffer , then, as she suffers. How much shall I pay you? Bonasera, Bonasera. What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come in friendship, the scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if an honest man like you should make enemies, they'd be my enemies. And then they would fear you. Be my friend? Godfather? Good. Some day, and that day may never come, I'll ask a service of you. But until that day accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.  -Grzie, Godfather. -Prego. Give this to Clemenza. I want people that aren't going to get carried away. We're not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker says. (BAND PLAYING TRADITIONAL ITALIAN MUSIC) -Where's Michael? -Don't worry, he'll be here. We're not taking the picture without Michael. -What's the matter? -It's Michael. VITO: Don Barzini. Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine. Paulie! More wine. -You look terrific on the floor. -Are you a dance judge or something? Take a walk and do your job. Sandra, watch the kids. Don't let them run wild. You watch yourself, all right? 20 , 30 grand. In small bills, cash. In that little silk purse. If this were somebody else's wedding... Sfortunato! Hey, Paulie! I got two gabagool, capocol, and a prosciut. PAULI E: Stupid jerk! What's the matter? -Have to go back to work. -Tom. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day. Don Corleone,  honored and grateful that you have invited me. Get out of here! It's a private party. Go on! What is it? It's my sister's wedding. SONNY: Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing! Come here, come here, come here! ...but towards the end, he was paroled to help with the American war effort, so for six months he's worked in my pastry shop. Nazorine, what can I do for you? Now that the war is over , this boy, Enzo, they want to repatriate him back to Italy. Godfather , I have a daughter. You see, she and Enzo... You want Enzo to stay in this country, and your daughter to be married. NAZORINE: You understand everything. Mr. Hagen. Thank you. Wait till you see the wedding cake I made for your daughter! The bride, the groom and the angel... -Who should I give this job to? -Not to our paisan. Give it to a Jew Congressman in another district. Who else is on the list? Hey, Michael! TOM : He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you. Is this necessary? He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding, so he wanted to thank you. Don Corleone,  honored and grateful that you have invited me on the wedding day of your daughter. May their first child be a masculine child. Michael... That man over there is talking to himself. See that scary guy over there? -He's a very scary guy. -What's his name? His name is Luca Brasi. He helps my father out sometimes. Michael, he's coming over here! You look terrific! My brother Tom Hagen, Miss Kay Adams. Your father's been asking for you. -Very nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Why does your brother have a different name? My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen in the street. He had no home, so my father took him in. He's been with us ever since. He's a good lawyer. Not a Sicilian. I think he's going to be consigliere. -What's that? -That's a, like a counselor , an advisor. Very important for the family. You like your lasagna? Don Corleone. honored and grateful that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding. On the day of your daughter's wedding. And I hope that their first child will be a masculine child. I pledge my ever -ending loyalty. -For your daughter's bridal purse. -Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend. Don Corleone,  going to leave you now, because I know you're busy. Thank you. Signora Corleone! No! (SPEAKING ITALIAN) (SINGING CHE LA LUNA) (SINGING CHE LA LUNA) Senator Cauley apologized for not coming, but said you'd understand. Also some of the judges. They've all sent gifts. What is that outside? Johnny! Johnny! I love you! He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come! -He's probably in trouble again. -He's a good godson. Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song! You never said you knew Johnny Fontane! -Sure. You want to meet him? -Great! Sure. -My father helped him with his career. -He did? How? (JOHNNY SINGING I HAVE BUT ONE HEART) -Let's listen to this song. -Michael... Please, Michael. Tell me. When Johnny was starting out, he was signed to a personal service contract with a big bandleader. And as his career got better and better , he wanted to get out of it. Johnny is my father's godson. My father went to see this bandleader. He offered him $ 10 ,000 to let Johnny go, but the bandleader said no. So the next day my father went to see him, but this time with Luca Brasi. Within an hour , he signed a release for a certified check of $ 1 ,000. -How did he do that? -Made him an offer he couldn't refuse. -What was that? -Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and father said that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract. That's a true story. (SINGING IN ITALIAN) That's my family, Kay. It's not me. MAMA CORLEONE: Beautiful! I'll take care of it. Tom... I want you to find Santino. Tell him to come to the office. How are you, Fredo? My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams. -Hi. -How are you doing? -This is my brother Mike. -Are you having a good time? Yeah. This is your friend? JOHNNY: I don't know what to do. My voice is weak. It's weak. Anyway, if I had this part in the picture, it puts me right back on top again. But this...man won't give it to me, the head of the studio. -What's his name? -Woltz. He won't give it to me, and he says there's no chance. TOM : Sonny? Sonny? TOM : Sonny? -Sonny, are you in there? -What? The old man wants you. One minute. JOHNNY: A month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best -seller. The main character is a guy just like me. I wouldn't even have to act. Godfather , I don't know what to do. You can act like a man! What's the matter with you? Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood finocchio that cries like a woman? (M I M ICKING JOHNNY) ""What can I do? What can I do?"" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous. -You spend time with your family? -Sure I do. Good. Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. You look terrible. I want you to eat. Rest, and in a month this Hollywood big shot will give you what you want. It's too late, they start shooting in a week. going to make him an offer he can't refuse. Just go outside and enjoy yourself, and forget about all this nonsense. -I want you to leave it all to me. -All right. -What time does my daughter leave? -Soon, after they cut the cake. Do we give your son -in -law something important? Never. Give him a living, but never discuss the family business with him. -What else? -Virgil Sollozzo called. -We'll have to see him next week. -When you come back from California. -When am I going to California? -Tonight. I want you to talk to this movie big shot and settle this business for Johnny. If there's nothing else, I'd like to go to my daughter's wedding. Carlo, we're going to take the picture. M ICHAEL: Wait a minute. KAY: No, Michael. Not me. Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it! MAN: You need a little more heat on that arc. Start talking. I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane. This friend would give his friendship to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor. Give Johnny the part in that war film you're starting next week. And what favor would your friend grant Mr. Woltz? He could make your future union problems disappear. And one of your stars has just moved from marijuana to heroin. Are you trying to muscle me? Listen, you son -of-a -bitch! Let me lay it on the line. Johnny Fontane will never get that movie! No matter how many Dago Guinea greaseballs come out of the woodwork! - German -Irish. -Listen here, my Kraut -Mick friend. - going to make trouble for you! - a lawyer. I haven't threatened... I know New York's big lawyers. Who are you? I have a special practice. I handle one client. I'll wait for your call. By the way, I admire your pictures very much. Check him out. -It's really beautiful. -Look at this. -It used to decorate a king's palace. -Very nice. WOLTZ: Why didn't you say you work for Corleone? I thought you were some cheap hustler Johnny was running in. -I only use his name when necessary. -WOLTZ: How's your drink? -Fine. -Now I'll show you something beautiful. You do appreciate beauty, don't you? There you are. $600 ,000 on four hoofs. I bet Russian czars never paid that for a single horse. Khartoum. Khartoum. not going to race him, though. going to put him out to stud. Thanks, Tony. Let's get something to eat. TOM : Corleone is Johnny's godfather. To the Italian people that's a very sacred, close relationship. I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything else. This favor I can't give him. He never asks a second favor when he's been refused the first. You don't understand. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. That part is perfect for him. It'll make him a big star. going to run him out of the business, and let me tell you why. Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable protgs. We trained her for five years. Singing, acting, dancing lessons. I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her , to make her a big star. Let me be even more frank. To show you that  not a hard -hearted man. That it's not all dollars and cents. She was beautiful. She was young and innocent! She's the greatest piece of ass I've had and I've had them all over the world. Then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive oil voice and Guinea charm. And she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous! And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous! You get the hell out of here! If that goombah tries any rough stuff, tell him  no bandleader. Yeah, I heard that story. Thank you for dinner and a very pleasant evening. Maybe your car can take me to the airport. Mr. Corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately. -You're not too tired, are you, Tom? -No, I slept on the plane. I have the Sollozzo notes here. Now... Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's supposed to be very good with a knife, but only in matters of business with reasonable complaint. His business is narcotics. He has fields in Turkey, where they grow poppy. In Sicily he has plants to process them into heroin. He needs cash, he needs protection from the police. He'll give a piece of the action. I don't know how much. The Tattaglia family is behind him here. They have to be in it for something. -What about his prison record? -One term in Italy, one here. He's known as a top narcotics man. -Santino, what do you think? -A lot of money in that white powder. Tom? TOM: Yes. There's more money in narcotics than anything else. If we don't get into it, somebody else will, maybe the five families. With that money they can buy more police and political power. Then they come after us. Now we have unions and gambling, and that's great, but narcotics is the future. If we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything in 10 years' time. So? What's your answer going to be, Pop? Don Corleone. I need a man who has powerful friends. I need a million dollars in cash. I need those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like nickels and dimes. -What is the interest for my family? In the first year your end should be three, four million dollars. And then it would go up. And what is the interest for the Tattaglia family? My compliments. I'll take care of them, out of my share. So I receive 30% for finance, political influence and legal protection? That's right. Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve this generosity? If you consider a million dollars in cash just finance, te salud, Don Corleone. I said that I would see you, because I heard you were a serious man, to be treated with respect. But, I must say no to you. And I'll give you my reason. It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics. They wouldn't be friendly long if I was involved in drugs instead of gambling, which they regard as a harmless vice, but drugs is a dirty business. It doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living. But your business is...a little dangerous. If you're worried about security, the Tattaglias will guarantee it. -The Tattaglias would guarantee our... -Wait a minute. I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I spoil them. They talk when they should listen. But anyway... Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to congratulate you on your new business. I know you'll do well, and good luck. Especially since your interests don't conflict with mine. Thank you. Santino. Come here. What's the matter with you? Your brain is going soft from playing with that girl. Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again. Go on. Tom, what's this nonsense? It's from Johnny. He's starring in that new film. -Take it away. -Take it over there. And tell Luca Brasi to come in. a little worried about this Sollozzo fellow. Find out what he's got under his fingernails. Go to the Tattaglias. Make them think that you're not too happy with our family and find out what you can. I got something for your mother and for Sonny and a tie for Freddy, and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen. -What do you want for Christmas? -Just you. (HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS PLAYING ON RADIO) VITO: Andiamo, Fredo. -Tell Paulie to get the car. -Okay, Pop. I'll have to get it myself. Paulie called in sick this morning. Paulie's a good kid. I don't mind getting the car. Buon natale, Caro. Grzie. -Luca!  Bruno Tattaglia. -I know. You know who I am? (IN ITALIAN) I know you. (IN ITALIAN) You have been talking to the Tattaglia family...right? I think you and I can do business. I need someone strong like you. I heard you are not happy... ...with the Corleone family. Want to join me? What's in it for me? $50 ,000 to start with. Not bad! Agreed? Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas. -Glad to see you. I want to talk to you. -I haven't got time. Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car. What are you worried about? If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already. Get in. -Fredo,  going to buy some fruit. -Okay, Pop. Merry Christmas. I want some fruit. Would you like me better if I were a nun? Like in the story. No. -What if I were Ingrid Bergman? -Now, that's a thought. Michael. No, I wouldn't like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter? They don't say if he's dead or alive. -Sonny, it's Michael. -Where have you been? -Is he all right? -We don't know yet. There are all kinds of stories. He was hit bad, Mikey.  -Are you there? -Yeah,  here.  -Where have you been? I was worried. -Didn't Tom tell you I called? No. Look, come home, kid. You should be with Mama, you hear? SANDRA: Oh, my God. Sonny! Stay back there. -Who is it? -Open up, it's Clemenza. There's more news about your old man. Word is out that he's already dead. -What's the matter with you? -Take it easy! -Where was Paulie? -Sick. He's been sick all winter. -How often? -Only three, four times. -Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard. -Pick him up now. I don't care how sick he is. Bring him to my father's house right now. -You want anyone sent over here? -No. Go ahead. going to have a couple of our people come over to the house. -Hello? -SOLLOZZO: Santino Corleone? -Yeah. -We have Tom Hagen. In three hours he'll be released with our proposition. Listen to what he has to say before you do anything. What's done is done. Don't lose that famous temper of yours, Sonny. I'll wait. (HANGS UP) SOLLOZZO: Your boss is dead. I know you're not in the muscle end of the family, so don't be scared. I want you to help the Corleones and me. We got him outside his office about an hour after we picked you up. Drink it. It's up to you to make peace between me and Sonny. Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he? And you knew it was the right thing to do. -Sonny will come after you. -That will be his first reaction, sure. So you have to talk sense into him. The Tattaglia family is behind me. The other New York families will go along with anything to prevent war. Let's face it, with all due respect, the Don  - rest in peace  - was slipping. Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him? Well, now he's dead, Tom, and nothing can bring him back. You've got to talk to Sonny, to the Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza. It's good business, Tom. I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi. Yeah, well... Let me worry about Luca. You just talk to Sonny. And the other two kids. -I'll do my best. -Good. Now you can go. I don't like violence, Tom. a businessman. Blood is a big expense. He's still alive. They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive! That's bad luck for me, and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal. Your mother is at the hospital with your father. Looks like he'll pull through. It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon... M ICHAEL: You gonna kill all those guys? Stay out of it. TOM : If you get rid of Sollozzo, everything falls into line. What about Luca? Sollozzo thinks he can control him. If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble. -Has anyone been in touch with Luca? -We've been trying all night. Hey, do me a favor... TOM : Luca never sleeps over with a broad. Well, Tom, you're consigliere. What do we do if the old man dies? If we lose the old man, we lose the political contacts and half our strength. The other New York families might support Sollozzo to avoid a long war. This is almost 1 946. Nobody wants bloodshed anymore. If your father dies you make the deal. -Easy to say. He's not your father. - as much a son as you or Mike. What is it? -Paulie, I told you to stay put. -The guy at the gates has a package. Tessio, go see what it is. -Shall I stay? -SONNY: Yeah. Are you all right? - fine. -There's food. Are you hungry? -No. -A drink? Brandy will sweat it out. -Go ahead. -That might be a good idea. Take care of that son -of-a -bitch. Paulie sold out the old man. -Make that the first thing on your list. -Understood. Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys and go to Luca's apartment. Maybe we shouldn't get Mike mixed up in this too directly. Hanging around the house on the phone would be a big help. Try Luca again. -What's this? -TESSIO: A Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. - going. -When will you be home? Probably late. -Don't forget the cannoli! -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rocco, sit on the other side. You block the rear -view mirror. Sonny's running wild. He wants to go to mattresses already. We have to find a spot on the West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street. -Know a good spot on the West Side? -I'll think about it. Think while you're driving. I want to hit New York this month. Watch the kids. ROCCO: Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up 1 8 mattresses and bring me the bill. PAULI E: Yeah, all right. ROCCO: Make sure they're clean, because the guys will be there a long time. PAULI E: They're clean and exterminated. ROCCO: (CHUCKLING) That's a bad word to use. Exterminate! Watch out, so we don't exterminate you! ROCCO: Pull over. I've got to take a leak. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. CLEMENZA: Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey! -Yeah. -Phone call! -Who is it? -Some girl. -Hello. Kay? -KAY: How's your father? He's going to make it. I love you. Huh? I love you!  -Michael? -Yeah, I know.  -Tell me you love me. -I can't talk. Can't you say it? I'll see you tonight. Why don't you tell that nice girl you love her? I love you with all my heart. If I don't see you again soon,  going to die! Come and learn something. You might have to cook for 20 guys some day. You start with a little oil, then fry some garlic. Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, fry it and make sure it doesn't stick. You get it to a boil, you shove in all your sausage and meatballs. Add a little bit of wine. And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick. Cut the crap. I have more important things for you. How's Paulie? You won't see him no more. -Where are you going? -To the city. -Send bodyguards with him. - going to the hospital... CLEMENZA: He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows he's a civilian. -Be careful. -Yes, sir. Send somebody with him anyway. (ALL OF MY LIFE PLAYING ON RADIO) -I have to go. -Can I go with you? No, Kay. There will be detectives there, people from the press. I'll wait in the cab. I don't want you to get involved. When will I see you again? Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll call you at your parents' house. -When will I see you again, Michael? -I don't know. What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here. Michael Corleone. This is my father. What happened to the guards? Your father had too many visitors. They interfered with hospital service. The police made them leave about 10 minutes ago. Get me Long Beach 45620 , please. Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here. Sonny,  at the hospital. I got here late, there's nobody here. No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.  -Don't panic. -I won't panic. sorry, but you will have to leave. We're going to move him to another room. Can you disconnect the tubes? -That's out of the question! -Do you know my father? Men are coming here to kill him. Do you understand? Help me, please. -Who are you? -I am Enzo, the baker. -Remember me? -Enzo. You'd better go, there's going to be trouble. If there is trouble, I'll stay here to help you. For your father. Listen. Wait for me outside, in front of the hospital, all right? I'll be out in a minute. Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now. with you now. with you. Get rid of these. Come here. Put your hand in your pocket, like you have a gun. You'll be all right. You did good. I thought all you Guinea hoods were locked up! -Why isn't anyone guarding my father? -You little punk! Don't you tell me my business! I pulled them off. -Stay away from this hospital! -Not until my father's room is guarded. -Phil, take him in! -The kid's clean, Captain. -He's a war hero. He's never been... -I said take him in! -What's The Turk paying you? -Take a hold of him. Stand him up. Stand him up straight. the Corleones' attorney. These men are hired to protect Vito Corleone. They're licensed to carry firearms. If you interfere, you'll have to appear before the judge and show cause. Let him go. -What's with all the new faces? -We'll need them now. After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad. We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning. Jesus Christ. Looks like a fortress around here. Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen on the street 24 hours a day. That Turk shows one hair on his ass, he's dead. Mike, let me look at you. You're beautiful, beautiful. You're gorgeous. The Turk wants to talk! Imagine the nerve of the son -of-a -bitch. -He wants a meeting today. -What did he say? What did he say... He wants us to send Michael to hear the proposition. He promises that the deal is too good to refuse. -And Bruno Tattaglia? -That's part of the deal. -He cancels out what they did to Father. -We should listen to them. No more! Not this time, Consigliere. No more meetings, discussions, or Sollozzo tricks. I want Sollozzo, or we go to war... -The other families... -They hand me Sollozzo! -They shot my father... -Even that was business, not personal. Then business will have to suffer. Do me a favor. No more advice on how to patch things up. Just help me win. I found out about Captain McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey has agreed to be The Turk's bodyguard. So when Sollozzo is being guarded, he's invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain. All the families would come after you. The Corleone family would be outcasts! Even the old man's political protection would run for cover. Do me a favor. Take this into consideration. All right, we'll wait. We can't wait. We can't wait. No matter what Sollozzo says, he's going to kill Pop. That's the key for him. We've got to get Sollozzo. -Mike is right. -SONNY: Let me ask you something. What about this McCluskey? What do we do with this cop? They want to have a meeting with me, right? It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo. Let's set the meeting. Get our informers to find out where it's going to be held. We insist it's a public place. A bar , a restaurant. Some place where there are people, so I feel safe. They'll search me when I meet them, right? So I can't have a weapon on me. But if Clemenza can figure out a way to have a weapon planted there for me then I'll kill them both. Nice college boy. Didn't want to get mixed up in the family business. Now you want to shoot a police captain because he slapped you? This isn't like the army! You have to get close and get their brains on your suit. You're taking this very personal. Tom, this is business and he's taking it personal. -Where does it say you can't kill a cop? -Mikey... talking about a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop. A cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming. That's a terrific story. We have newspaper people on the payroll, right? -They might like a story like that. -They might. It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business. CLEMENZA: It's as cold as they come. Impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints. I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt. Try it. Is the trigger too tight? My ears! I left it noisy, so it scares away any pain -in -the -ass innocent bystanders. You've shot them both. Now what do you do? -Sit down, finish my dinner. -Don't fool around. Let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out. Everybody will still think you've got it. They'll stare at your face, so walk out fast, but don't run. Don't look anybody in the eye, but don't look away either. They'll be scared stiff, so don't worry about nothing. You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation, nobody knows where, and we'll catch the hell. -How bad do you think it will be? -Pretty goddamn bad. All the other families will probably line up against us. These things have to happen every five, 10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood. Been 10 years since the last one. You have to stop them at the beginning. Like they should have stopped Hitler in Munich, not letting him get away with it. You know, Mike, we were all proud of you. Being a hero and all. Your father too. Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing. Even Sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting will be held. How much time do we have? They're going to pick you up outside Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half. CLEMENZA: We could put a tail on them. Sollozzo would lose our ass. -What about the negotiator? -He's playing pinochle with my men. -He's happy. They're letting him win. -Too risky. Maybe we should call it off. The negotiator plays cards until Mike is back safe. -He could blast whoever is in the car. -CLEMENZA: They'll expect that. Sollozzo might not even be in the car , Sonny! I'll get it. Louis' restaurant in the Bronx. -Is it reliable? -My man in McCluskey's precinct. A police captain is on call 24 hours a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10. -Anybody know this joint? -Sure, I do. It's perfect for us. A small family place, good food. Everyone minds his business. Perfect. They've got an old -fashioned toilet. You know, the box and the chain thing. We might be able to tape the gun behind it. All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant, you eat, talk for a while, you relax. Make them relax. Then you go to take a leak. No, better still, you ask permission to go. Then you come back blasting. Two shots in the head apiece. I want somebody very good to plant that gun. I don't want him coming out with just his dick. -The gun will be there. -You drive him and pick him up. Let's move. Did he tell you to drop the gun right away? Yeah, a million times. Don't forget. Two shots apiece in the head as soon as you come out. How long do you think it will be before I can come back? At least a year. I'll square it with Mom, that you're not seeing her before you leave and... I'll get a message to that girlfriend when the time is right. Take care. Take care, Mike. glad you came. I hope we can straighten everything out. It's not the way I wanted things to go. It should never have happened. I want to straighten everything out. I don't want my father bothered again. I swear on my children that he won't be, Mike. But you have to keep an open mind when we talk. I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny. You can't talk business with him. McCLUSKEY: He's a good kid. sorry about the other night, Mike. I've got to frisk you, so turn around. On your knees, facing me. I guess  getting too old for my job. Too grouchy. Can't stand the aggravation. You know how it is. He's clean. Going to Jersey? Maybe. Nice work, Lou. -How's the food in this restaurant? -Try the veal. It's the best in the city. McCLUSKEY: I'll have it. - going to speak Italian to Mikey. -Go ahead. What I want... What's most important to me is that I have a guarantee. No more attempts on my father's life. What guarantees can I give you? the hunted one! I missed my chance. You think too much of me, kid. not that clever. All I want is a truce. I have to go to the bathroom. Is it all right? When you got to go, you got to go. He's clean. Don't take too long. I've frisked a thousand punks. Okay, you take over. I love you, Grandpa. CONNIE:  sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet. "" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish I see you soon. Your grandson Frank. "" Go with your mother. Take them downstairs. Go on, Carlo, you too. Go on. -What's the matter with you, Carlo? -Shut up and set the table. Since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on our operations. And also the other families. There's been a lot of bad blood. They hit us, so we hit them back. Through our newspaper contacts we've been able to put out material about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo in the drug rackets. So things are loosening up. And  sending Fredo to Las Vegas, under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A. -I want him to rest. - going to learn the casino business. (SOFTLY) Where's Michael? It was Michael who killed Sollozzo. But he's safe. We're starting to work to bring him back. I want you to find out where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding. I want him now. Sonny, things are starting to loosen up. If you go after Tattaglia, all hell will break loose. Pop can negotiate. -He must get better first. I'll decide... -War is costly. We can't do business. -Neither can they. Don't worry about it! -We can't afford a stalemate. -No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard! -You're getting a great reputation! Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime consigliere. I wouldn't be in this shape! Pop had Genco. Look what I got. sorry. I didn't mean that. Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday. Niggers are having a good time with our policy banks in Harlem. Driving new Cadillacs, paying 50% on a bet. That's because they've started making big money. Papa never talked business at the table. -CARLO: Shut up, Connie... -Don't you ever tell her to shut up. Don't interfere. I'd like to talk to you after dinner. I could do more for the family... We don't discuss business at the table. I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino. Why are you so far from the house? You know  responsible to your father for your life. The bodyguards are here. It's still dangerous... We've heard from Santino in New York... Your enemies know you're here. Did Santino say when I can go back? It's out of the question. Where are you going now? To Corleone. Take my car. I want to walk. Be careful. Michael. Corleone. Where have all the men gone? They're all dead from vendettas. There are the names of the dead. Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. ! Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. ! Clark Gable! America! Take me to the America, G. I. ! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth! (IN ITALIAN) Mamma mia what a beauty. I think you got hit by the thunderbolt. (IN ITALIAN) In Sicily women are more dangerous than shotguns. Did you have a good hunt? You know all the girls around here? We saw some real beauties. One of them struck our friend like a thunderbolt. She would tempt the devil himself. Really put together. Right, Calo? Such hair , such mouth! The girls around here are beautiful...but virtuous. This one had a purple dress... And a purple ribbon in her hair. A type more Greek than Italian. Do you know her? There's no girl like that in this town. My God, I understand! What's wrong? Let's go. It's his daughter. Tell him to come here. Call him. Fabrizio, you translate. I apologize if I offended you. a stranger in this country. I meant no disrespect to you or your daughter. an American, hiding in Sicily. My name is Michael Corleone. There are people who'd pay a lot of money for that information. But then your daughter would lose a father instead of gaining a husband. I want to meet your daughter. With your permission, and under the supervision of your family. With all respect. (IN ITALIAN) Come to my house Sunday morning. My name is Vitelli. (IN ITALIAN) What's her name? Apollonia. SONNY: I'll knock you dizzy. Save it for the library. We've got to pick up my sister. What's the matter? What's the matter? -It was my fault! -Where is he? It was my fault. I hit him. I started a fight with him. I hit him, so he hit me... just going to get a doctor to take a look at you. Sonny, please don't do anything. What's the matter with you? What am I going to do? Make that baby an orphan before he's born? You spic slobs still betting Yankees? Tell them to stop taking in action. (COMMENTATOR NARRATING BASEBALL GAME ON RADIO) We lost enough money last week. Come here, come here! If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you. Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay. You should call. Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling. -I want to reach Michael. -Nobody knows where he is. All we know is that he's all right. -What was that? -An accident, but nobody was hurt. Tom, will you give this letter to Michael. Please? If I accepted that, a court could prove I have knowledge of his whereabouts. He'll get in touch with you. I let my cab go, so can I call another one, please? Come on. Sorry. -Hello? -WOMAN: Is Carlo there? -Who is this? -A friend of Carlo. Tell him that I can't make it tonight until later. Bitch! -Dinner's on the table. - not hungry. -The food is getting cold. -I'll eat out later. -You just told me to make you dinner! -Vafangool! I'll vafangoolyou! She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat. That's it, break it all, you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all! Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner? Maybe I will. -Clean it up! -Like hell I will! You skinny, spoiled brat. Clean it up! Clean it up! Clean it up! I said, clean it up! Clean it up! Clean it up. Clean that up, you... Clean it! Clean it up! Yeah, kill me. Be a murderer , like your father! -All you Corleones are murderers! -I hate you! Come on, kill me! Get out of here! -I hate you! -Now I'll kill you. You Guinea brat. Get out of here! Connie, what's the matter? I can't hear you. Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying. Santino, I can't understand. I don't know. Yeah, Connie. You wait there. No, you just wait there. Son -of-a -bitch. -Son -of-a -bitch! -What's the matter? Open the goddamn gate! Get off your ass. Sonny! -Sonny. -Get out of here! Go after him, go on! Son -of-a -bitch. Come on! Give me a drop. My wife is crying upstairs. I hear cars coming to the house. Consigliere of mine, tell your Don what everyone seems to know. I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. But you needed a drink first. Yeah. Well, now you've had your drink. They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead. I want no inquiries made. I want no acts of vengeance. I want you to arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families. This war stops now. Call Bonasera. I need him now. This is Tom Hagen.  calling for Vito Corleone, at his request. You owe your Don a service. He has no doubt that you will repay it. He will be at your funeral parlor in one hour. Be there to greet him. Well, my friend, are you ready to do me this service? Yes. What do you want me to do? I want you to use all your powers and all your skills. I don't want his mother to see him this way. Look how they massacred my boy. It's safer to teach you English! I know English... Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday. Greetings, Don Tommasino. How are things in Palermo? Michael is teaching me to drive...watch, I'll show you. How are things in Palermo? Young people don't respect anything anymore... times are changing for the worse. This place has become too dangerous for you. I want you to move to a villa near Siracusa...right now. What's wrong? Bad news from America. Your brother , Santino, they killed him. Let's go...you promised. Fabrizio! (IN ITALIAN) Get the car. Are you driving yourself, Boss? Is your wife coming with you? No, take her to her father's house until things are safe. Okay, anything you say. (IN ITALIAN) Calo, where is Apollonia? She's going to surprise you. She wants to drive. She'll make a good American wife. Wait, I'll get the baggage. Fabrizio! (IN ITALIAN) Where are you going? Wait there! I'll drive to you. No, Apollonia! VITO: Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping me organize this meeting, and the other heads of the five families from New York and New Jersey. Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx, and from Brooklyn Philip Tattaglia. And from Staten Island we have with us Victor Strachi. And the other associates that came as far as from California and Kansas City and all the other territories of the country. Thank you. How did things ever get so far? I don't know. It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary. Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son. We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees, then  willing to let things go on as before. We all know him as a man of his word. A modest man who listens to reason. Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest. He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket. He refused to share them. When did I ever refuse an accommodation? All of you know me. When did I ever refuse, except one time? And why? Because I believe this drug business will destroy us in the years to come. It's not like gambling or liquor or even women, which is something that most people want, but is forbidden by the Church. Even the police that have helped us in the past with gambling and other things are going to refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics. I believed that then and I believe that now. Times have changed. It's not like the old days, when we could do anything we wanted. A refusal is not the act of a friend. If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians, then he must share them or let others use them. He must let us draw the water from the well. Certainly he can present a bill for such services. After all, we're not communists. I also don't believe in drugs. For years I paid my people extra, so they wouldn't do that kind of business. Somebody says to them "" I have powders. "" "" If you put up 3 -4,000 dollar investment, we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "" They can't resist. I want to control it as a business, keep it respectable. I don't want it near schools, I don't want it sold to children. That's an infmia. In my city we would keep the traffic to the colored. They're animals, so let them lose their souls. I hoped that we could come here and reason together. And  willing to do whatever is necessary to find a peaceful solution. We are agreed. The traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled. Don Corleone will give us protection in the east, and there will be peace. I must have strict assurance from Corleone. As time goes by and his position becomes stronger , will he attempt any individual vendetta? BARZINI : We are all reasonable men. We don't have to give assurances. You talk about vengeance. Will vengeance bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? I forgo the vengeance of my son. But I have selfish reasons. My youngest son was forced to leave this country because of this Sollozzo business. And I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely. Cleared of all these false charges. But  a superstitious man. If an unlucky accident should befall him, if he should be shot by a police officer, or if he should hang himself in his jail cell, or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning, then  going to blame some of the people in this room. And that I do not forgive. But, that aside let me say that I swear on the souls of my grandchildren, that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today. Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's drug middlemen have clean records? Mention it. Don't insist. -Barzini will know without being told. -You mean Tattaglia. Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. But I didn't know until this day that it was Barzini all along. Come on, Nancy. Keep together , everyone. Brian. Okay, all right. How long have you been back? I've been back a year. Longer than that, I think. It's good to see you, Kay. working for my father now, Kay. He's been sick. Very sick. But you're not like him. You told me you weren't going to become like your father. My father is no different than any other powerful man. Any man who's responsible for other people. Like a senator or president. -How naive you sound. -Why? They don't have men killed. Who's being naive, Kay? My father's way of doing things is over. Even he knows that. In five years the Corleone family is going to be completely legitimate. Trust me. That's all I can tell you about my business. Kay... Michael, why did you come here? Why? What do you want with me after all this time? I've been calling and writing. I came because I need you. I care for you. -Please stop it, Michael. -Because... I want you to marry me. -It's too late. -Please, Kay... I'll do anything you ask to make up for what's happened to us. Because that's important, Kay. Because what's important is that we have each other. That we have a life together. That we have children. Our children. Kay, I need you. And I love you. TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it! -Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat! -M ICHAEL: Be patient. TESSIO:  not asking for help. Just take off the handcuffs. M ICHAEL: Be patient. CARLO: We must protect ourselves. -Let me recruit some new men. -M ICHAEL: No. -Barzini would get an excuse to fight. -TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong. CLEMENZA: Don Corleone... You once said that one day Tessio and me could form our own family. Till today I would never think of it. I must ask your permission. Michael is now head of the family. If he gives his permission, then you have my blessing. After we make the move to Nevada you can leave the Corleone family and go on your own. -TESSIO: How long will that be? -Six months. Forgive me, but with you gone, me and Pete will come under Barzini's thumb. I hate that Barzini. In six months' time there will be nothing left to build on. -Do you have faith in my judgment? -Yes. -Do I have your loyalty? -Always, Godfather. Then be a friend to Michael. Do as he says. Things are negotiated that'll solve your problems and answer your questions. That's all I can tell you now. Carlo, you grew up in Nevada. When we make our move there, you'll be my right -hand man. Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere. He'll be our lawyer in Vegas. That's no reflection on Tom, just how I want it. If I ever need help, who's a better consigliere than my father? That's it. -Thank you, Papa. - happy for you, Carlo. Mike... Why am I out? You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom. Things may get rough with the move. Tom. I advised Michael. I never thought you were a bad consigliere. I thought Santino was a bad Don, rest in peace. Michael has all my confidence, just as you do. But there are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen. -Maybe I could help. -You're out, Tom. I can't get over the way your face looks. So good! This doctor did some job. Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey! Leave them out here. He's tired and wants to clean up. Let me open the door , all right? (PLAYING FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW) -Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas! -All for you, kid! It's all his idea. JOHNNY: Your brother Freddy. FREDO: Girls? -Anything you want, kid, anything. -Who are the girls? -That's for you to find out. -Get rid of them, Fredo. -Hey, Mike... - here on business. Get rid of them. tired. Get rid of the band too. Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go. Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo. Hey, come on! Scram! Come on, honey. I don't know what's the matter with him, Johnny. Sorry. I don't know. He's tired. What happened to Moe Greene? He had some business. He said to give him a call when the party started. Well, give him a call. -Johnny, how are you? -Nice to see you, Mike. M ICHAEL: We're proud of you. JOHNNY: Thanks. Sit down, I want to talk to you. The Don is proud too. Well, I owe it all to him. He knows how grateful you are. That's why he'd like to ask a favor of you. Mike, what can I do? We're thinking of giving up our interests in the olive oil business and settling here. Moe will sell us his share of the casino and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. -Tom! -Are you sure? Moe loves the business. He never said nothing about selling. I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. See, Johnny... We figure that entertainment would draw gamblers to the casino. We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year. Perhaps convince some of your friends in the movies to do the same. We're counting on you. Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for my godfather. Good. Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows. Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom. -Good to see you. -How are you, Moe? Have everything? Specially prepared food, the best dancers, and good credit. Draw chips for everybody, so they can play on the house. Is my credit good enough to buy you out? Buy me out? The casino, the hotel. The Corleone family wants to buy you out. The Corleone family wants to buy me out? No, I buy you out. Your casino loses money. We can do better. -You think  skimming off the top? -You're unlucky. You Guineas make me laugh. I took Freddy in when you had a bad time, and now you try to push me out! You did that because we bankrolled your casino Yes. First of all, you're all done. You don't have that kind of muscle anymore. The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by the others. Do you think you can come to my hotel and take over? I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal with him and still keep my hotel! Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? That was nothing, Mike. Moe didn't mean nothing by that. He flies off the handle sometimes, but we're good friends. I have a business to run. I've got to kick asses sometimes. We had an argument, so I had to straighten him out. You straightened my brother out? He was banging cocktail waitresses! Players couldn't get a drink. What's wrong with you? I leave for New York tomorrow. Think about a price. Son -of-a -bitch! Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were out with cheerleaders. Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea. Tom, you're the consigliere. Talk to the Don... Just a minute. Don is semi -retired and Mike is in charge of the family business. If you have anything to say, say it to Michael. Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that! Fredo... You're my older brother , and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever. I have to see my father and his people, so have dinner without me. This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to the city, see a show and have dinner. Your sister wants to ask you something. -Let her ask. -She's afraid to. They want you to be godfather to their boy. -We'll see. -Will you? Let me think about it. Come on. Barzini will move against you first. He'll set up a meeting with someone you absolutely trust. Guaranteeing your safety. And at that meeting you'll be assassinated. I like to drink wine more than I used to. -Anyway,  drinking more. -It's good for you, Pop. I don't know. Are you happy with your wife and children? -Very happy. -That's good. I hope you don't mind the way I keep going over this Barzini business. -No, not at all. -It's an old habit. I spend my life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless, but not men. -How's your boy? -He's good. He looks more like you every day. He's smarter than I am. He's three and can read the funny papers. Read the funny papers. I want you to arrange for a telephone man to check all in - and out -going calls. -I did it already. I took care of that, Pop. -That's right. I forgot. What's the matter? What's bothering you? I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it, so I'll handle it. I knew that Santino would have to go through all this. And Fredo... Fredo was, well... But I never wanted this for you. I worked my whole life. I don't apologize for taking care of my family. And I refused to be a fool, dancing on a string held by all those big shots. I don't apologize. That's my life, but I thought that, that when it was your time, you would be the one to hold the strings. Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone. Something. Another pezzonovante. Well... Just wasn't enough time, Michael. Wasn't enough time. We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there. Now listen, whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting, he's the traitor. Don't forget that. Can I hold it, please? -Can I water these? -Yes, go ahead. Over here, over here. Be careful. You're spilling it. Anthony! Come here, come here. That's it. We'll put it right there. I'll show you something. Come here. Stand there. Give me an orange! That's a new trick. You run in there. Run in there. ANTHONY: Where are you? Mike, can I have a minute? Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. He says we can straighten out any of our problems. -You talked to him? -Yeah. I can arrange security. On my territory. -All right? -All right. Do you know how they're going to come at you? They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground. Where I'll be safe. I always thought it would be Clemenza, not Tessio. It's the smart move. Tessio was always smarter. But  going to wait. After the baptism. I've decided to be godfather to Connie's baby. And then I'll meet with Don Barzini and Tattaglia. All the heads of the five families. (RECITING CONTINUES) PRI EST: Michael, do you believe in God, the Father , Creator of Heaven and Earth? I do. Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord? MICHAEL: I do. PRIEST: Do you believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church? MICHAEL: I do. (RECITING CONTINUES IN LATIN) (BABY CRYING) (RECITING CONTINUES) PRI EST: Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan? I do renounce him. And all his works? I do renounce them. WOMAN: Oh, God! -And all his pomps? -I do renounce them. Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized? I will. Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may the Lord be with you. Amen. Kay! Kiss your godfather. Can't go to Vegas. Something's come up. Everybody has to leave without us. -CONNIE: Mike, it's our first vacation! -Connie, please. Go back to the house, wait for my call. It's important. I'll only be a couple of days. We're on our way to Brooklyn. -I hope Mike can get us a good deal. - sure he will. Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a separate car , so you two go on ahead. -That screws up my arrangements. -That's what he said. I can't go either , Sal. Tell Mike it was only business. I always liked him. -He understands that. -Excuse me, Sal. Tom, can you get me off the hook? -For old times' sake? -Can't do it, Sally. You have to answer for Santino, Carlo. -Mike, you got it all wrong. -You fingered Sonny for Barzini. That little farce you played with my sister. -You think that could fool a Corleone? - innocent. I swear on the kids. -Please, don't do this. -Sit down. Don't do this to me, please. Barzini is dead. So is Philip Tattaglia. Moe Greene. Strachi. Cuneo. Today I settle all family business, so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo. Admit what you did. Get him a drink. Come on. Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think I'd make my sister a widow? godfather to your son, Carlo. Go ahead, drink, drink. No, you're out of the family business. That's your punishment. You're finished. putting you on a plane to Vegas. Tom. I want you to stay there. Understand? Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence. Makes me very angry. Who approached you? Tattaglia or Barzini? It was Barzini. Good. There's a car waiting outside to take you to the airport. I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on. -Mike... -Get out of my sight. Hello, Carlo. - trying to tell you... -CONNIE: Mama, please! Michael! KAY: What is it? CONNIE: Where is he? Michael, you lousy bastard! You killed my husband. You waited until Papa died, so nobody could stop you. You blamed him for Sonny. Everybody did. But you never thought about me! Now what are we going to do? KAY: Connie. CONNIE: Why do you think he kept Carlo at the Mall? He knew he was going to kill him. And you stood godfather to our baby. You lousy cold -hearted bastard! Want to know how many men he had killed with Carlo? Read the papers! That's your husband, that's your husband! No! No, no... Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor. She's hysterical. Hysterical. Michael, is it true? -Don't ask me about my business, Kay. -Is it true? Don't ask me about my business. Enough! All right. This one time. This one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Is it true? Is it? No. I guess we both need a drink. Come on. Don Corleone., I hope our new Commander-in-Chief isn't the coward they say he is. Whatever they say, Yamamoto is the kind of leader we need. He believes in the value of the airplane. But why a Vice-Navy Minister for such an important position? Maybe the climate in Tokyo was detrimental to Yamamoto's health. The Army is against him for opposing their policies. So he runs away to sea. Now he has the entire fleet to guard him. This order makes you Commander-in-Chief. The Imperial fleet consists of... Save your breath, Yoshida. Those details are in the documents. You haven't changed! With the Army controlling politics... ...your job as Navy Minister will be difficult. Thank God you're here. We know your life has been threatened. I'm not that easy to kill. Army hotheads are demanding an alliance with Germany. That would be tragic for Japan. As Navy Minister I will... ...continue to fight with the Army. You are our last hope, Yoshida. The Navy must stand firm against the alliance. America is against the war we are waging in China... ...and angry that we are negotiating with the Germans. Now we are threatened with an embargo of the raw materials we need. Either we improve relations with the U.S. and withdraw from China... ...or find another source of raw materials here in Indo-China. Why worry about threats from America? President Roosevelts attention is on Europe... ...where Germany is winning a quick victory over the Allied Armies. Now is the time to strike. The British, the Dutch and the French are withdrawing their forces... ...from Southeast Asia to strengthen their armies in Europe. We must be careful. The Americans have an Army in the Philippines... ...and they have moved their Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor. Yes, and that fleet is a knife leveled at Japan's throat. The Japanese ambassador just arrived. He should be up shortly. Thank you. The Japanese are stalling, Henry. You know that. When Nomura took over as ambassador... ...I had some hopes of settling our differences. But our meetings so far have been unproductive. He brings me proposals, I offer compromises. He brings me counterproposals, and so on. I tell you, Henry, Nomura was sent here to buy time. That's what he's doing, at our expense. The president believes him to be a man of honor... ...that we can trust and deal with. Mr. Ambassador, we meet again. It is always a pleasure. I assume you know Mr. Stimson, the head of our War Department. Oh, yes, of course. Mr. Ambassador. I do hope, Mr. Stimson... ...your presence here does not indicate anything ominous. Of course not, Mr. Nomura. Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down? Thank you. Well, since our last talk a week ago... ...I have received certain... ...shall we say... ...questions from my government... ...to put to you to clarify certain matters. Good morning, Colonel. There it is. This machine let's us intercept every word between Tokyo... ...and all Japanese embassies. The coded material is fed into that machine. It goes round and round in there... ...and comes out here, decoded in Japanese. All we have to do is translate it. We decode this quicker than the Japanese embassy... ...right here in Washington. No wonder you decided to call it ""Operation Magic."" - The latest intercept, sir. - Thank you. Things are getting a little hotter in the Pacific. As long as we're sharing this assignment... ...take a look at this. Behold the 12 apostles. The chosen few are authorized to see the magic intercepts. Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, isn't on the list. No, and not one of our overseas commanders. Excellent! Who is in command of those torpedo planes? Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir, from the carrier Akagi. Send him this message from me. ""Congratulations on brilliant torpedo attack."" If we are forced into a war with America... ...Japan's only hope... ...is to annihilate the American Pacific fleet at the outset. I wonder if we could use torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor? Stand by. Execute. Look at that entrance to the harbor. Sink one good-sized ship in the channel and you've bottled up our whole fleet. You know as well as I do, this harbor is a mousetrap. Fleet should have stayed in San Diego where it belongs. I made the mistake to point that out to Roosevelt. We're expected to obey orders. We're also expected to exercise our own good judgement. I didn't ask for the job. Sorry, Kim, but this was my command, and it's become habit... ...to worry about the security of the fleet. The British, flying some old biplanes... ...torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships at Taranto. - Harbor very much like this one. - Well... ...I share your concern, but CNO doesn't think it can happen here. Why not? A torpedo dropped from a plane plunges... ...to a depth of 75 feet or more before it levels off. I know, and Pearl is only 40 feet deep. I'm still worried, Kim. Frankly, sir, I was stunned when I heard of your proposal. You think the plan is reckless? You suggest using torpedo planes against the American Fleet... ...but Pearl Harbor is too shallow for that. Taranto is also a shallow harbor... ...but the British torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships there. I know as well as you do that my plan is a gamble. And it's risky, but we have no choice. What I need immediately is a plan for such an attack. Then we should consult with Genda... ...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi, a superb strategist. Yes, I remember Genda. We'll talk to him. Glad to see you, Genda. So this is the new Zero? Type 21, with folding wings. This means we can carry more fighters now. This Zero is fast, manoeuvrable and has a long cruising range. Better than the Messerschmitt or Spitfire? Definitely. I've seen both in combat over London. You outrank me, so it must be true. Now that you're Staff Officer here, things will be tough. You don't have to worry, you won't be here. You're going to the Third Fleet with a promotion. The Commander-in-Chief must think you're good! Of course he does! And I've got proof! Here is his telegram. Want to read it? Ten-hut! Do the planes have to be parked like that? Way at the edge of the field. Standard dispersal procedure, General. In case of enemy air attack. There are 130,000 Japanese on this island. Our main problem is sabotage. It'd be too easy for enemies to sneak in at night... ...and blow up every one of them if they're left out there. Make a note, Fielder. We'll have to make changes. Yes, sir. Ten-hut. - Yes? - Admiral Halsey's here to see you. Send him in, please. Blast me, break me, court-martial me, draw and quarter me... ...if you think they're gonna send my ships... ...on convoy duty in the Atlantic. Kim, I think they've gone nuts in Washington. How will I fight a task force if they send ... ...my ships to the Atlantic? That damn ocean is a swimming hole compared to the Pacific. What are we, a fighting fleet, or are these toy boats out here... ...so the Japs can buy them at Christmas? All right, Bill, now ease it off. It's not just you. They asked for some of our tankers too. How do they expect to feed these wagons... ...parked out here on this land-locked duck pond? You're still planning on rotating half of them at sea? I was. Look, Kim, you've got to make them understand what's going on out here. I'm gonna do everything I can, Bill. Even go to the president. By God, I knew there was at least one man... ...in this man's Navy who hadn't gone nuts. ""Gandhi"" is still in hiding, sir. A strange man, he works in his cabin like a hermit. But he should be here. Watanabe, go and ask him to join us. When ""Gandhi"" concentrates on a plan, he is lost to this world. Please don't bother me! This is important... ...so I'm not going. Genda's plan for attacking Pearl Harbor... ...is foolproof. It's brilliant! He stresses the importance of combat aircraft. Just think of it. We use six aircraft carriers... ...torpedo planes... ...high-level bombers, dive bombers. Zero fighters for cover... ...go by the northern route, use the new torpedoes... ...we attack on a weekend. Genda has thought of everything... ...refuelling... ...the weather.... And we go on to say, ""It should be noted that Japan ... ...has never preceded hostile action by a declaration of war. We have concluded it possible that a fast-rated ... ...Japanese carrier force may arrive in Hawaii with no prior warning... ...from our intelligence service. The most favourable time to the enemy would be dawn. He probably would employ a maximum of six carriers... ...strike on a weekend. - We recommend that the Air Corps..."" - I read it. Yes, sir. I appreciate the work that you and General Martin have put in. These reports are very useful to General Short and myself. General Martin, you don't pull any punches, do you? ""We recommend that the Air Corps... ...maintain a thorough 360-degree search... ...of the Hawaiian area during daylight. This will require a force of 180 B-17 airplanes."" We can't search the sea approaches... ...unless we have the planes, sir. One hundred and eighty B-17s? For God's sakes, that's more than the number existing in the States. It looks fine on paper, but that's not a paper fleet out there. Squadron from the Enterprise. Bill Halsey's working the tails off his men. Wish we had more like him. Makes the most of what he's got. Doesn't keep asking for the moon. Well, not one bomb anywhere near the target for the past hour. Your pilots can see it, I suppose. - Who's next? - It's Anderson, sir. Now, that's more like it. - Maybe your boys finally get it. - I hope so, sir. Who's next? Lieutenant Dickenson. Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me... ...he couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle. Yes, sir. Ten-hut. - Carry on. - Carry on. This it? Yes, sir. Our new radar. It's a remarkable scientific achievement... ...capable of spotting an intruder on the sea or in the air... ...and at quite a range. - Now, listen, Colonel, as you know, we're short on patrol planes. We're gonna have to rely on this... ...thing to detect the enemy. General, radar should do the job. What's it doing here, not set up? We're about to truck it up that mountain. That peak up there is the ideal spot to put our main radar post. At that height, we'd be clear of all interference. Obviously. But, sir, we can't get permission to put her up there. Permission? From the National Park Service Department of Interior. See, all of this belongs to the Hawaiian National Park. The Hawaiian National Park? Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation Society is raising hell too. And we can't get permission? No, sir. Not unless we want to fight them. Fight them? You're damn right we're gonna fight them. - Now you make a note of that, Fielder. - Yes, sir. Wildlife Preservation Society. I feel like a damn fool. Without even consulting me... ...our Army has decided to occupy Indo-China. There is no hope for peace now. I've said it before and Ill keep on saying it... ...if we fight the Americans, we can't stop at Hawaii or San Francisco. We'll have to march into Washington... ...and dictate peace terms in the White House! Army hotheads who speak so lightly of war should think about that! As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy, I can do nothing. I'm sorry. Don't blame yourself. The Army leaders are at fault, not you. I must get back to the fleet. There is a lot to be done. It's no use, Hal. I spoke to General Miles. He took it up with General Marshall. The order stands. The president is off the ultra List. Incredible. Withholding information from the president. Security found a copy of an intercept in a wastebasket at the White House. Truth is, the brass don't trust some men close to the president. Does anyone trust anyone anymore? - Do you even trust your own wife? - Do you? Come to think of it, I believe I do. Part two of No. 1390, Colonel. Tokyo to embassies in Washington and Berlin. Thank you, Miss Cave. The Japanese are moving south to occupy French Indo-China. - This is big trouble. - Yeah. Well, ultra list or not... ...someone has to tell the president about this one. ""Therefore, we will impose a full embargo... ...on all trade with Japan. We do not anticipate immediate hostile action by Japan... ...but you get this information... ...so you may take appropriate precautionary measures."" ""Appropriate precautionary measures."" What the hell does that mean? Now, this is signed jointly by General Marshall and Admiral Stark. Until we know how the Japanese will react, we're not gonna take chances. - We go on full alert. - Yes, sir. Stark says they don't anticipate hostile action. Why send a warning at all? Damn it. Damn it, why can't Washington give us the full inside story? I'd sooner form my own opinion. ""Don't anticipate hostile action."" Well, all right, we'll go ahead. Increase air and sub patrols, alert senior commanders. Maybe out of this we can find out how well we can function. Kaminsky. This is Captain Earle. Going on full alert. Yes, captain. We're going on full alert. Notify all ship, sub and air patrols. What the hell is going on here? What are you doing? Carrying out orders. General Short's concern is sabotage. All aircraft not ready for flight from now on... ...will be parked in the center... ...so they can be kept under guard. Suppose there's an air raid. They hit one plane, and it all goes up in flames. I'm sorry. General's orders. Today's war games... ...of a theoretical attack on Pearl Harbor... ...clearly show the need for six carriers in the attack force. The General Staff... ...wants to limit us to only three carriers. We must have six! If we reduce our striking force... ...from six carriers to only three... ...our mission will fail. Before attacking anything else, we should attack our General Staff. We believe in aircraft, but they cling to the ancient theory... ...that decisive naval engagements must be fought between battleships. Unless we dispel this myth... ...we'll never get their approval. They are not the only believers in the ""battleship theory."" Many officers here today also support the idea. I'm one of them. We'll soon have two new unsinkable battlewagons... ...each with a displacement of 65,000 tons and huge guns. Anything that floats can be sunk! The ""unsinkable"" ship is a myth. The war in Europe is being decided by the airplane. There can be no ictory on land or sea, without control of the air! I have been chosen to command this task force. And I consider this operation risky. How can we travel 3500 miles to Hawaii without being detected? This mission will fail unless we achieve complete surprise. My ships can't carry fuel for a trip there and back. Stopping to refuel increases the possibility of detection. I am confident that our ships will reach Hawaii safely. You are too cautious. The case for using six carriers is sound. To criticize the plan is defeatist! No more bickering! As long as I am Commander-in-Chief... ...Pearl Harbor will be attacked! I am aware that this is a dangerous gamble. But we can't afford the luxury of playing it safe now! Gentlemen, whether we adopt this plan or not is no longer an issue. Let us now decide how best to carry it out. Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back! Fuchida! What a surprise! I'm your new Air Commander, so treat me well. You're joking. How did you rate another promotion? Well, exceptional people get exceptional treatment! This ship is crawling with Admirals. Something important must be happening. We have called you here... ...to explain the purpose of a new training program. This, of course, is a matter of strictest secrecy. It looks just like Pearl Harbor, doesn't it? And that area down there looks like Ford island, eh? Beautiful! Navy pilots attract geisha girls but they frighten the fish. It's not an ideal radar sight, but at least we got a permit. Let's get the other units working. Easier said than done. What do you mean? We have to get all six units adjusted and link them by phone to headquarters. That means training men to operate an information center... ...so they know what to do with the information. Take it easy, Murph. - You'll figure it out. - Yeah, I'll figure it out. Don't just stand there. You know how to operate this thing. We know the theory. Let's put that theory into practice. - Switch on. - Yes, sir. Stay put and keep watching the screen. In two hours, close down. I'll send a truck to pick you up. Excuse me, sir, but what are we watching for? Anything unusual. Any large blip coming from the sea. Colonel, if we do spot something, what do we do? Report it to headquarters, damn it. - How, sir? - What? We haven't got a telephone, sir. There's a gas station a mile down the road. They must have a phone. We got 183 combat planes on this base, General. The way they're parked now, a one-eyed monkey hanging from a balloon... ...could scatter them to hell with one hand grenade. General Short gave the order. Come in. - Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch. - Okay, send them in. You two men get in your planes and fly over to Haleiwa. Yes, sir. What are our orders when we get there? Just sit tight. Listen for the phone. That's all. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Haleiwa is one of the subsidiary fields. We send those two up there, two more here. Only way I know to disperse a few of the planes. If I'd get away with it, I'd send all to the neighbour islands. - You know why we're being transferred. - Them poker games. - Been winning too often. - Yeah. Some sucker loses his shirt, so he bitches to the General. That's it. It's hard to believe the Emperor agreed... ...to fix a date by which the final decision must be made... ...between war and peace. His majesty's signature is a mere formality. The cabinet is responsible for all matters of national policy. The Emperor recently read a poem to his Ministers to show how he feels. ""If all people are brethren... ...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"" ""If all people are brethren... ...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"" This clearly shows how much the Emperor wants to avoid a war. Yes, he has urged us to solve our differences with Washington. But, sir, the deadline is October. Can a solution be found by then? Perhaps. But if we fail... ...if war does come... ...tell me frankly, from the Navy's Viewpoint... ...what are our chances against the Americans? If we must, we can raise havoc with them for a year. After that, I can guarantee nothing. Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you will continue the negotiations. Please remember, there is no last word in diplomacy. Tokyo has ignored my repeated inquiries... ...and still has made no reply... ...to the compromise proposals offered by Secretary Hull. The war that I have dreaded for so long... ...may soon become a reality. Nomura has offered his resignation several times. But Tokyo won't let him quit. Instead they're sending a second ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out. Do you really think this Kurusu can do any good? Well, I doubt it, Frank. He's hardly the most tactful choice. When he was ambassador in Berlin... ...he signed the Axis Pact on behalf of Japan. You will sail from Hittakopu Bay on November 26 under my strict orders. The code, ""Climb Mt. Niitaka"" will be confirmation to go on. We have tentatively set the date for the attack... ...on Sunday, December 7th, Hawaiian time. But you must understand that we are still negotiating in Washington. If a peaceful solution is found... ...the fleet will be recalled at once. Once at sea, to turn back would be a disgrace! It would destroy the morale of the men! They're in a high state of readiness, physically and psychologically. Enough! If any commander is inclined to reject an order to return... ...when the path for peace is open... ...let him resign now! Finally, gentlemen... ...many misinformed Japanese... ...believe that America is a nation divided, isolationist... ...and that Americans are only interested... ...in enjoying a life of Luxury... ...and are spiritually and morally corrupt. But that is a great mistake. If war becomes inevitable... ...America would be the most formidable foe that we have ever fought. I've lived in Washington and studied at Harvard... ...so I know the Americans are a proud and just people. - You sick or something? - No. I've been piecing together this batch of new intercepts. - A frightening picture is taking shape. - Oh? Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu asked their government... ...to extend a deadline for suspending negotiation between Japan and America. - You remember that? - Yeah. Now, according to this latest intercept... ...Tokyo wants to conclude negotiations with us... ...no later than November 29... ...after which, and I quote: ""Things are automatically going to happen."" Now... ...look at this intelligence report from the British. Five Japanese troop transports with naval escort... ...were sighted off Formosa, heading south. We've been monitoring their fleet. Most of it seems to be on home waters. I'm not so sure. I'd make a bet they're going to attack us. Japan is going to attack us. The 29th is only four days off. The 30th is on a Sunday. We're gonna be attacked on Sunday, the 30th of November. The pieces fit together. But can you prove it? No. But I'm convinced I'm right. Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall. Oh, General Marshall's at Fort Benning, sir. Then get me the secretary of war. I've got the evidence, AI. And I'm gonna make the brass around here admit I'm right. Bratton's analysis makes sense. His facts are undeniable. Henry, I'm washing my hands of the whole matter. From now on, it's in your hands... ...and in those of the Navy Department. I'll call the president. A message declaring a full alert will be sent out. Sir? General Marshall anticipated an emergency like this. Before he left to attend manoeuvres... ...he made out this alert order. As you know, after the Cabinet decided to send Japan to war... ...they held an Imperial Conference at the palace. His Majesty, who participated in this conference... ...which is a mere formality... ...was depressed and silent all through the meeting. Today His Majesty will ask the customary questions about the war... ...and you will make the traditional replies. There can be no more tragic ritual than this conversation... ...between His Majesty who does not want war... ...and Your Excellency, who has opposed it so vigorously. As Minister of the Imperial Household... ...I am not allowed to attend this ritual. Fortunately for me... ...I won't have to witness this tragic ceremony. I can go no farther. The Military Attach will take you from here. Sir, a message! ""From Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet... ...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet... ...climb Mount Niitaka."" Hostilities will begin on December 7th... ...exactly as scheduled. Read this back to me. ""Japanese future action unpredictable. But hostile action possible at any moment. If hostilities cannot be avoided... ...the United States desires that Japan commit the first overt act."" Wait a minute. Read that again. ""If hostilities cannot be avoided, the United States desires... ...that Japan commit the first overt act. This shouldn't be construed as restricting you... ...to a course of action jeopardizing your defense. Prior to hostile Japanese action... ...you are directed to undertake reconnaissance... ...and other measures as you deem necessary. These measures should be carried out... ...so as not to alarm the civil population ... ...or disclose intent. By order of General George C. Marshall."" ""Not to alarm the civil population."" What do you make of it? Well... ...if you ask me, sir, it's double talk. But the chief of staff doesn't go in for double talk. - We're going on alert. - Again? But the men are confused. So many alerts. - Damn it, unconfuse them. - Yes, sir. ""Japanese forces may attack the Philippines... ...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo. This dispatch is to be considered a war warning."" Well, there it is, gentlemen. You now have as much information as I do. That's the second warning in three days. ""Japanese forces may attack the Philippines... ...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo."" They don't mention us. That's correct. I think it should be considered significant. Well, gentlemen... ...we have a job to do. Washington wants us to send a squadron of fighters to Midway. And another squadron to Wake. When can you sail? Well, the Enterprise can sail tomorrow morning. I'll need a day or two. We're just completing repairs on the Lexington. Hurry things along, John. I want you out there to probe. I want planes up in the air morning and afternoon. I want a report on any sign of hostile ships. Understood. Do you want battleships along? Hell, no. They're too slow. If we're gonna probe, let's probe. We don't want anything holding us up. You're right, but I'm not ready to commit them myself. Not until I know when and where. Do you plan to keep half the fleet at sea while the carriers are gone? No, it's too risky. I'll have to keep the fleet here at Pearl while you're away. Get out. Get back as soon as you can. I don't like the idea of having my battleships without air cover. Yes, sir. Admiral. Kim. Level with me. I want a clear directive. If I run into a Jap ship, what action do I take? Use your common sense. That's the best damn order I ever had. If I see so much as a sampan there... ...I'll blow it out of the water. ""Intelligence Report, U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor... ...six battleships, three light cruisers... ...16 destroyers and one aircraft carrier."" No information about the other American carriers. You know today's date? December 1st. Yes, but tonight will be November 30th. When we cross the International Date Line... ...we'll push the clock ahead five hours... ...and turn the calendar back a full day, making today yesterday. Don't be silly! Today can't change into yesterday! You're not too intelligent but I'll try to explain... ...so listen carefully. It's a little before 1300 hours, right? So why are we making supper at this hour? 1300? It should be lunchtime. Right! And the Date Line makes up for that time difference... ...by turning today into yesterday. I don't quite understand, but if we see the enemy across that line... ...I guess it would be useless to shoot at them. Because how can today's shells hit yesterday's enemy? What is it this time, getting me over here? Tokyo has alerted their embassy to stand by... ...for a very long message in 14 parts. Look, Rufe, you scared me and everybody else last week. We're not doing that again, are we? You should see this. It's the latest report on those Japanese troop transports. Remember those troop ships? They're still heading south with an escort... ...only 14 hours from the coast of Malaya. What about their aircraft carriers? We don't know. Intelligence was keeping track of them until recently. Now we've lost them. Look, Rufe, try to put yourself in their minds. Where do you think I have been the past week, night and day? I am still convinced they're going to attack us. What can we do that we aren't doing already? I don't know about you, but I know what I'm gonna do. Where is everybody? Oh, it's past 12, sir. They've already gone. - Get them back. - On the weekend? Yes, on the weekend. ""Only specially screened members of your communications staff... ...are to be permitted to process the 15-part message... ...and prepare the typed translation."" It will be difficult without the help of a skilled typist. The situation right now is extremely delicate. We must be prepared... ...to have each part of the message decoded as soon as it comes in. I'll alert the code room. We'll reach Point D soon, sir. From Point D proceed to Point E. Battle speed. So this is the sound of Hawaii? Disappointing news, our main targets, the American carriers... ...have left Pearl Harbor. This completes 13 parts? Yes, Tokyo is holding the final part till morning. I wonder why. It's almost 9. Harry, I'm going to make the rounds with what we have here. Thank God the president's back on the list. Have Brotherhood call me when the missing part is in. Right. You're late. - Well, I was... - Please, take me to the White House. If you told me we were invited to the White House, I would've dressed. You know Mrs. Roosevelt. She's informal personally, but a stickler for protocol... Darling, will you shut up and drive? Once more! Steady. Great! We just sank the Nevada! Pennsylvania! Oklahoma! Enterprise! No, you idiot! It's your own flagship! Well? Captain Wilkinson's. Did you see the president? No, I saw Harry Hopkins. And did he read the whatever it is? No, he doesn't have the key. I gave the pouch to our Naval aide, Lieutenant Schulz. He took it in to the president. And the president has a key, I suppose? Of course he has. And did Lieutenant Schulz say anything? He said, ""Thank you."" Darling, step on it, will you? If we can see nothing, then neither can American patrol planes. I'm more concerned about a submarine detecting us. Dead on schedule. Admiral Stark can't be reached. Should I take it to chief of staff? It's after 10, General Marshall always retires early. I see no reason to disturb Marshall with something that's incomplete. - Wait till you have the final part. - Yes, sir. If you're so concerned... ...why don't we call chief of war plans, Admiral Turner? His telephone doesn't answer, sir. - You don't happen to know where he is? - No idea. The president has already discussed it with me. He sent a personal message to the emperor. But when the final part of this comes in, I'd like to see it then. - Good night, commander. - Good night, sir. I was starved. I'll bet you are. Oh, thank you, dear. Can't you tell me anything? Even a hint? You'd think the world was falling apart. Admiral Stark talked to the president. What did the president say? He sent a personal message to the emperor. Gordy. Ed. We got those B-17s coming in from California in the morning. Honolulu radio will stay on the air all night... ...so the planes can home in. You and I had better be in that control tower at 7:30 sharp. - Yes, sir. - Dear. - Tyler, I've got a job for you. - Sir. Report to the new radar center at Fort Shafter at 0400. At 4:00 in the morning? From 4 to 7 a.m. Our marvel of science only operates for three hours. Lucky boy. Lucky boy! Captain, how's it feel? First command, first patrol. Just fine, Mr. Young. In fact, I think I'll turn in for a while. - Good night, sir. - Good night. The Commander-in-Chief has sent a message... ...wishing us good luck. That, plus the Imperial Proclamation... ...has undoubtedly stirred your loyalty to the Empire. The success of this mission... ...depends on surprise. If we achieve it... ...the code words ""Tora, Tora, Tora,"" will be sent out. Now that the hour for battle draws near... ...I will not burden you with the usual pep talk. Instead I shall hoist the famous ""Z"" flag... ...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief Togo led his fleet to Victory... ...in the historic battle against the Russians. Here you are. Kramer. AI, listen to this. The fourteenth part. ""Will the ambassadors please submit our reply... ...to the United States government at precisely 1p.m... ...December 7th, your time."" 1p.m.? ""Precisely 1p.m., your time."" I'll be right over. Look at the president's message. I should have had it hours ago. As you know, communications have been delayed ... ...and frequently garbled lately. Or deliberately interfered with. Gene, call the foreign minister. Tell him I want an immediate audience with the emperor. Why is this so important? Does this Roosevelt message say anything new? It merely proposes a heart-to-heart exchange... ...between the two Chiefs of State. It could start negotiations afresh. It's too late for that. It's just as well the message didn't come a day or two earlier. What do I tell Ambassador Grew? You are Foreign Minister! Report to the palace alone with the message. ""After deciphering... ...part 14... ...destroy at once... ...your cipher machine... ...all codes... ...and secret documents."" Translate this immediately. - Give a copy to Kramer when he comes. - Yes, sir. I've got to get the hell out of here. Hey, look at this. Finally got one. Communication center. It even works. That's great. Opana Point, communications check. Are you reading us? Coming in loud and clear. Where's the General? It's Sunday, sir. This is Colonel Bratton. Connect me with Chief of Staff, General Marshall. Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer. Chief of staff's quarters, Sergeant Aguirre speaking. Yes, Colonel Bratton. I'm sorry, sir, the General isn't here. Where he always is this time Sunday morning. - Where's Colonel Bratton? - Gone to see General Marshall. He left this for you, sir. Here is another part of the message, sir. We are instructed to submit the message at 1:00 p.m. today. One p.m.? The 14th part of this intercept Kramer just delivered... ...indicates to me the Japanese are going to attack. None of us doubt that war is coming. We know they have an expeditionary force heading south. Sir, as hostilities seem imminent... ...I recommend you telephone Admiral Kimmel ... ...in Hawaii. No. I better call the president first. Now, if you'll all please excuse me? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. The men are in good spirits, sir. They are eager to go. Yes, they are eager because they do not know the taste of battle. The mechanics asked me to give you this for good luck at Pearl Harbor. Bring her into the wind. ""The Japanese government regrets to have to notify... ...the American government... ...that, in view of the attitude of the American government... ...it cannot but consider that it is impossible to reach... ...an agreement through further negotiations."" - Sir. - Hm? - There are supplemental messages. - Thank you. Gentlemen, I am convinced the Japanese intend to attack... ...at or shortly after 1:00 today. - I'll alert all Pacific commands. - Yes, sir. Colonel Bratton, just a minute. Take this to communications center. We will follow that ship into Pearl Harbor. Come in. Captain, can you come to the bridge? Very well. Sub contact, Mr. Goepner? - We're not sure. - What ship? The Navy tug Antares. Look astern of her, captain. She's towing a target raft. Look between the ship and the raft, sir. That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine. She's sneaking through the net into the harbor. General Quarters. - Sound General Quarters. - All engines ahead, full. Come left 15 degrees, sir. - Tell Antares we're attacking. - Aye, aye, sir. Flags, tell Antares we're attacking. - Mount one, commence firing. - Mount one, commence firing. - Stand by to roll depth charges. - Stand by to roll depth charges. Roll one. Roll two. Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges on a sub in our security zone. Aye, aye, sir. Captain Earle speaking. - We have a message from the ward. - All right, read it to me. ""Have dropped depth charges on sub operating in our security zone."" We've had so many of these false sightings, Kaminsky. But this is the real thing, sir. Closer than any previous sighting. Just off the harbor entrance. You and I know the skipper of that destroyer is a green kid. I'll pass it to Admiral Block. With all due respect, sir, I think we should alert all commanders. Confirmation, Kaminsky. I want confirmation. The sunburst reminds me of our flag, a good omen. Ed, this is hot. General Marshall wants it sent to all commanders by the fastest route. Right. The General's handwriting, it's hard to read. You're gonna have to help me with it, Rufe. Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu on the radio. Check your direction-finder dial. It's coming from five degrees to port, sir. Okay, keep riding that beam. Major, I picked up some great music from Honolulu. That's fine, pipe it through. Okay. Where's the damn chow truck? Shut the thing down, George. It's already after 7. Hey, Joe, come here. What do you make of that? I've been watching it for minutes. It's moving in, fast. I've never seen anything that big. - Looks like two main pulses. - Hey, Joe, I got it. I make that about 140 miles north, three degrees east. Don't make sense, we got no planes out that far. We gotta contact the information center. Our problem is over at 7:00. The center might make some sense out of it. Okay, suit yourself. Information center. Yeah? I don't know, Mac, we're all closed down here. Is that right? Hang on a minute. Lieutenant, sir. Lieutenant Tyler. Sir, this is Private Elliot, Opana Point. There's a large formation of planes coming in... ...140 miles, three degrees east. Yeah? Well, don't worry about it. The boys at Opana Point must have picked up the B-17s... ...coming in from the mainland. - He said not to worry about it. - Come on, let's go eat. Colonel, I sent this to Manila, the canal zone and San Francisco... ...but the direct channel to Hawaii is out. Atmospherics again? Yes, sir, it's real bad today. We could give it to the Navy. What makes you think their atmospherics are better? - Send it as a telegram. - Yes, sir. Our ultimatum should be delivered in Washington before the attack begins. I hope everything is on schedule. Don't worry, sir. The Emperor insists... ...that we follow the rules of the Geneva Convention. Our declaration of war will be delivered... ...at 1:00 p.m., 30 minutes before the attack begins. The typing still isn't finished. We'll have to postpone our 1:00 appointment with Secretary Hull. Do you mean a submarine was sighted over half an hour ago... ...and that it's taken this long to report it to me? I don't care if it still hasn't been confirmed. I should've been informed after the ward radioed a first report. A submarine that close is a serious matter. A very serious matter. Get the confirmation, all the reports to my office. I mean, right now. Have my driver get the car. Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir... ...should I tell General Short you'll miss the golf date? No, damn it, get my car. A message for the General at Fort Shafter. - Is it marked urgent? - No. It's a little bumpy, Davey... ...but you have to fly in all kinds of weather. Sure, Miss Fort. Don't let the nose drop. That's better. You're doing just fine. I'm taking over, Davey. Warrant Officer Mizuki, signal all planes, ""prepare to attack."" A signal from Fuchida, ""objective sighted, preparing to attack."" Everything is strangely quiet. The American anti-aircraft batteries haven't fired a shot! And no enemy fighters over the harbor, sir! We've done it! ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" Stand by. Execute. Get his number. I'll report him for safety violations. Come on! Alert all commands: ""Air raid. Pearl Harbor. This is no drill."" General Quarters. General Quarters. Man your stations. Man your stations. Sir. Battle stations. Battle stations. Fire your gun. Fire at will. That bastard! Station six, man your pump. Plane to starboard. You bastard! Pearl Harbor is being attacked. - Pearl Harbor? - Pearl Harbor is being bombed. Pearl Harbor's being attacked. Go back to your quarters. Pearl Harbor's being attacked. What in the hell is going on? Why wasn't the Army notified? Did anyone think to inform Washington? I thought so. - General. - Put all units on a full war footing. Alert the territorial guard. Open a command post at Aliamanu Crater. - Yes, sir. - I'll be right down. Oh, my God. The island's under attack. Those bastards will kill us all. Men, get to the armory. Get guns, ammunition. - You too, lieutenant. - Yes, sir. - Operator. - Duarte Air Field. All the phone lines are jammed. Well, try the radio again. Hose down that plane. Run for it. Run, run! There's Hickam. Major, I heard something funny on the Honolulu radio. What kind of traffic control is this? The radio said something about an attack. They're Japs, sir. What a way to fly into a war. Unarmed and out of gas. Oboe leader to Oboe flight. We've flown into the middle of a war. Get out fast. Anywhere. If you can't make Hickam, try Bellows or Wheeler. Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious. They shot one circuit box. The landing light isn't working. Better use the hand crank. Hurry. - Major. - Yeah. One wheel is stuck. Well, jolt it loose. We're going in. - I tried. - Try again! Here they come. Fire! Tell them to stop shooting at us! We're Americans. Major, no go, sir. Like I said, it's a hell of a way to fly into a war. - Run for it! - Hurry up! Tower to B-17, there's a Jap on your tail. Goose your engine and get out. Have damage control report all damages. Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry. Okay, sergeant, let's get the men down. All right, you guys, let's go. Where the hell are our fighters? Captain, the main fuel tanks are fractured. Lower deck's flooded, we're listing eight degrees. Counter flood, counter flood. You wanted confirmation, captain? Take a look. There's your confirmation! ""Oklahoma, capsized. Nevada's taken a torpedo forward and is down to a head. West Virginia, subjected to six torpedo hits and several deck fires. Raleigh and Helena damaged and listing."" The California, two torpedoes, fires all around, temporarily abandoned. I've just come from her. It's spent, sir. Would've been merciful had it killed me. A message from Flight Leader Fuchida. ""Have inflicted serious damage on numerous battleships."" Better than we had dreamed! Where are our priority targets... ...the American carriers? Mr. Secretary. ""Air raid. Pearl Harbor. This is no drill."" No, this can't be true. They must mean the Philippines. No, sir. It's Pearl. Get me the White House, the direct line. Yes, sir. Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you in a moment. Please be seated. Mr. President, has this been confirmed? Then, sir, I'd like you to have it confirmed ... ...before I receive Nomura and Kurusu. They're waiting outside. Operator. Operator. Get me Haleiwa field. Fast. George, get a hold of a car, a truck, anything. I'm calling Haleiwa to get them to start our planes. Go. Right! Battleship on the left, sir! It's the Nevada. She's making a run for the sea! If we sink her in the channel, the harbor will be blocked for months! Recommend course 2-3-0, sir. - Very well. Stay at 2-3-0. - Stay at 2-3-0, sir. Take cover! More hose! More hose! - More water. More! More water. - Abandon ship! Abandon ship! - Abandon ship! Abandon Ship! - Over the side! Can't get through the outer channel in this shape. She goes down here, she'll block the south channel. We'll have to beach her there so she's clear. File these. G-5. - I need five copies each. Messenger. - Take this to General Short's office. - Right. File these. Corporal. This has to be decoded for the General. Take it to the decoding room. Ask them to send it back soon. Yes, sir. Run! Run for it! Drop the hose and get the ladders and axes. What are you waiting for? - We got no water. - Why? What's wrong? It's the Arizona. She cut the pipes in the mains. The tanker in the ocean there is full of aviation fuel. If it goes, we'll blow up half the harbor. Come on, hurry up! Get out of the way! Hey, look out! In all my 50 years of public service... ...I have never seen a document so crowded with infamous falsehoods... ...and distortions... ...on a scale so huge... ...that I never imagined until today... ...that any government on this planet... ...was capable of uttering them. Mr. Hull. Go. What's the matter? Why in hell doesn't the next wave take off? But, sir, no one has given the order. We've knocked out the American airfields... ...sunk four battleships, heavily damaged three more. Sir, Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's carrier has signaled! ""Attack group ready for takeoff."" Unfortunately, the American carriers were not at Pearl Harbor. Since we don't know where they are... ...we can't use our limited supply of fuel to look for them. We must not forget that enemy submarines will be searching for us. We have been lucky so far. No take-off signal yet? There is a signal now! It says, ""All ships head for Japan as soon as our planes return."" It can't be! It must be a mistake! We cannot turn back now. We must destroy the American carriers and their dry docks... ...no matter how long it takes! You're wrong. Our mission has been completely accomplished. This task force is vital to us. It is my duty to return it intact. This war is just beginning. We have a long way to go. Yes, all right. This came from the decoding room, a cablegram from the War Department. Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel. Pardon me, admiral. - From Washington. - Thank you. Gentlemen. ""The Japanese are presenting at 1p.m... ...Eastern Standard Time today... ...what amounts to an ultimatum. Just what significance the hour set may have, we do not know... ...but be on alert accordingly."" Signed ... ...George C. Marshall, chief of staff. My God. This leaves the Navy with only two combat groups in the Central Pacific. Ours and the Lexington. We don't want to get caught like they did. I don't intend to. When can you be ready for sea again? We can fuel and provision and be under way before dawn. Good. That's good. Here is an announcement from the Navy Department released December 7th. ""Before daybreak today, the Imperial Navy successfully launched... ...a large-scale air raid against the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii."" We salute the Commander-in-Chief of our Fleet... ...Admiral Yamamoto. I had intended to deal a fatal blow to the American fleet... ...by attacking Pearl Harbor... ...immediately after Japan's official declaration of war. But according to the American radio, Pearl Harbor was attacked... ...55 minutes before our ultimatum... ...was delivered in Washington. I can't imagine anything... ...that would infuriate the Americans more. I fear all we have done... ...is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve., Michael Rennie was ill The day the earth stood still But he told us where we stand And Flash Gordon was there In silver underwear Claude Rains was the Invisible Man Then something went wrong For Fay Wray and King Kong They got caught in a celluloid jam Then at a deadly pace It came from outer space And this is how the message ran Science fiction Double feature Dr. X Will build a creature See androids fighting Brad and Janet Anne Francis stars in... ...Forbidden Planet Oh At the late-night Double feature Picture show I knew Leo G.

You and Betty have been inseparable... ...since you met in Dr. Scott's courses. Tell you the truth, Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place. I mean... Okay, guys, this is it! You ready? Look, Betty's gonna throw her bouquet. I got it! - I got it! - Hey, big fella. Looks like it could be your turn next. Who knows. So long. See you, Brad. Come on, hop in. See you, Brad. Brad, wasn't it wonderful? Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful? Just an hour ago she was plain old Betty Munroe. And now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt. - Yes, Janet. Ralph's a lucky guy. - Yes. Oh, I always cry at weddings. Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook. Yes. Ralph will be in line for promotion in a year. Yes. - Hey, Janet. - Yes, Brad? I've got something to say. I really loved The skillful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet Oh, Brad. - The river was deep but I swam it - Janet - The future is ours, so let's plan it - Janet - So please don't tell me to can it - Janet I've one thing to say and that's Damn it, Janet I love you - The road was long but I ran it - Janet - A fire's in my heart and you fan it - Janet - There's one fool for you and I am it - Janet I've one thing to say and that's Damn it, Janet I love you Here's a ring to prove That I'm no joker There's three ways That love can grow That's good, bad Or mediocre Oh, J-A-N-E-T I love you so - Oh, it's nicer than Betty Munroe had - Oh, Brad - Now we're engaged and I'm so glad - Oh, Brad - That you met Mom and you know Dad - Oh, Brad I've one thing to say and that's Brad, I'm mad For you too Oh, Brad Oh, damn it I'm mad Oh, Janet For you I love you too There's one thing left to do Ah-ooh - And that's go see the man who began it - Janet - When we met in his science, exam it - Janet - Made me give you the eye, then panic - Janet Now I've one thing to say and that's Damn it, Janet I love you Damn it, Janet Oh, Brad, I'm mad Damn it, Janet I love you I would like, if I may... ...to take you on a strange journey. It seemed a fairly ordinary night... ...when Brad Majors and his fiance, Janet Weiss... ...two young, ordinary, healthy kids... ...left Denton that late November evening... ...to visit a Dr. Everett Scott... ...ex-tutor and now friend to both of them. It's true there were dark storm clouds... ...heavy, black and pendulous... ...toward which they were driving. It's true also that the spare tire they carried... ...was badly in need of some air. But they, being normal kids and... ...on a night out... ...they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening. On a night out. It was a night out... ...they were going to remember... ...for a very long time. I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent... ... to every instinct in my body. But as president... ... I must put the interests of America first. America needs a full-time president... ... and a full-time Congress... ... particularly at this time... Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist that's passed us. They sure do take their lives in their hands. Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap to that type. What's the matter, Brad, darling? We took the wrong fork a few miles back. Oh. Where did that motorcyclist come from? I guess we'll just have to turn back. What was that bang? We must have a blowout. Damn it! I knew I should've gotten that spare tire fixed. You stay here and I'll go for help. We're in the middle of nowhere. Didn't we pass a castle a few miles back? Maybe they have a telephone I could use. I'm going too. - Both of us don't need to get wet. - I'm coming with you. Besides, the owner of that phone might be a beautiful woman... ...and you might never come back again. In the velvet darkness Of the blackest night Burning bright There's a guiding star No matter what Or... ... who you are There's a light Over at the Frankenstein place There's a light Burning in the fireplace There's a light, light In the darkness Of everybody's life The darkness must go Down the river Of nights dreaming Flow morphia slow Let the sun And light come streaming Into my life Into my life There's a light Over at the Frankenstein place There's a light Burning in the fireplace There's a light Light In the darkness Of everybody's life And so... ...it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet... ...and they had found the assistance that their plight required. Or had they? Brad, let's go back. I'm cold and I'm frightened. Just a moment, Janet. They may have a phone. Hello. Hi! My name's Brad Majors. This is my fiance, Janet Weiss. I wondered if you might help us. Our car broke down up the road. Do you have a phone we might use? You're wet. Yes, it's raining. Yes. Oh. I think, perhaps, you better both come inside. You're too kind. I'm frightened. What kind of place is this? It's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos. This way. Are you having a party? You've arrived on a rather special night. - It's one of the master's affairs. - Oh. - Lucky him. - You're lucky. He's lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky! It's astounding Time is fleeting Madness takes its toll But listen closely Not for very much longer I've got to keep control I remember Doing the time warp Drinking Those moments when The blackness would hit me And the void would be calling Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again It's just a jump to the left - And a step to the right - With your hands on your hips You bring your knees in tight But it's the pelvic thrust That really drives you insane Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you can't see me No, not at all In another dimension With voyeuristic intention Well secluded I see all With a bit of a mind flip You're into the time slip And nothing can ever be the same You're spaced out on sensation Like you're under sedation Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again I was walking down the street Just having a think When a snake of a guy Gave me an evil wink He shook a me up He took me by surprise He had a pickup truck And the devil's eyes He stared at me And I felt a change Time meant nothing Never would again Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again It's just a jump to the left - And then a step to the right - With your hands on your hips You bring your knees in tight But it's the pelvic thrust That really drives you insane Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again It's just a jump to the left - And then a step to the right - With your hands on your hips Bring your knees in tight But it's the pelvic thrust That really drives you insane Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again Say something. Say! Do any of you guys know how to Madison? - Brad, please, let's get out of here. - Keep a grip on yourself, Janet. - But it seems so unhealthy here. - It's just a party, Janet. - Well, I want to go. - We can't till I get to a phone. - Then ask the butler or someone. - Just a moment. We don't want to interfere with their celebrations. This isn't the Chamber of Commerce. They're probably foreigners with different ways. They may do some more folk dancing. I'm cold, I'm wet and I'm just plain scared. I'm here, there's nothing to worry about. How do you do I see you've met My faithful handyman He's just a little brought down Because when you knocked He thought you were the candyman Don't get strung out By the way I look Don't judge a book by its cover I'm not much of a man By the light of day But by night I'm one hell of a lover I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transsexual... ...

Transylvania Hit it! Hit it! - I'm just a sweet transvestite - Sweet transvestite From Transsexual... ... Transylvania So come up to the lab And see what's on the slab I see you shiver With antici... - pation But maybe the rain Is really to blame So I'll remove the cause But not the symptom Thank you. Thank you very much. Brad! We'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right. Slowly, slowly. It's too nice a job to rush. Hi. My name's Brad Majors and this is my fiance, Janet Weiss. You are...? You are very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory. Some people would give their right arm for the privilege. People like you, maybe? I've seen it. Come along. The master doesn't like to be kept waiting. Shift it! Is he...? Frank, I mean, is he your husband? The master is not yet married. Nor do I think he ever will be. - We are simply his servants. - Oh. Magenta. Columbia. Go and assist Riff Raff. I will entertain... Brad Majors and this is my fiance, Janet Vice. - Weiss. - Weiss? Enchant. Well, how nice. And what charming underclothes you both have. But here, put these on. They'll make you feel less vulnerable. It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality. Hospitality! All we wanted to do was use your telephone. Goddamn it! A reasonable request you have ignored! - Don't be ungrateful. - Ungrateful?! How forceful you are, Brad. Such a perfect specimen of manhood. So dominant. You must be awfully proud of him, Janet. Well, yes, I am. - Do you have any tattoos, Brad? - Certainly not. Oh, well. How about you? Everything is in readiness, master. We merely await your word. Tonight, my unconventional conventionists... ...you are to witness a new breakthrough... ...in biochemical research. And paradise is to be mine! It was strange the way it happened. Suddenly... ...you get a break. All the pieces seem to fit into place. What a sucker you've been. What a fool. The answer was there all the time. It took a small accident to make it happen. - An accident! - An accident! That's how I discovered the secret. That elusive ingredient. That spark... ...that is the breath of life. Yes. I have that knowledge. I hold the secret... ...to life itself! You see... ...you are fortunate. For tonight is the night... ...that my beautiful creature is destined to be born. Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator. And step up the reactor power input... ...three more points! Oh, Brad! It's all right, Janet. Oh, Rocky! The sword of Damocles Is hanging over my head I've got the feeling someone's Gonna be cutting the thread Oh, woe is me My life is a misery Oh, can't you see That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer I woke up this morning with a start When I fell out of bed That ain't no crime And left from my dreaming Was a feeling of unnameable dread That ain't no crime My high is low I'm dressed up with no place to go And all I know Is I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer - That ain't no crime. - Oh, no, no, no. - That ain't no crime. - Oh, no, no, no. Oh, my baby! The sword of Damocles Is hanging over my head That ain't no crime I've got the feeling someone's Gonna be cutting the thread That ain't no crime Oh, woe is me My life is a mystery And can't you see That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer - That ain't no crime. - Oh, no, no, no. That ain't no crime Well, really! That's no way to behave on your first day out. But since you're such an exceptional beauty... ...I'm prepared to forgive you. Oh, I just love success! - He is a credit to your genius. - Yes. - A triumph of your will. - Yes. He's okay. Okay? Okay?! I think we can do better than that. Now, Brad and Janet... ...what do you think of him? Well... I don't like men with too many muscles. I didn't make him for you! He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval. A weakling weighing 98 pounds Will get sand in his face When kicked to the ground And soon in the gym With a determined chin The sweat from his pores As he works for his cause Will make him glisten And gleam And with massage And just a little bit of steam He'll be pink And quite clean He'll be a strong man Oh, honey But the wrong man He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs Try to build up his shoulders His chest, arms and legs Such an effort If he only knew of my plan In just seven days I can make you a man He'll do press-ups and chin-ups Do the snatch, clean and jerk He thinks dynamic tension Must be hard work Such strenuous living I just don't understand When in just seven days Oh, baby I can make you a man Eddie! Whatever happened to Saturday night When you dressed sharp, felt all right Don't seem the same since cosmic light Came into my life I thought I was divine I'd go for a ride with chicks who'd go And listen to the music on the radio A saxophone was blowing On a rock 'n' roll show We climbed in the back seat We really had a good time Hot patootie, bless my soul I really love that rock 'n' roll Hot patootie, bless my soul I really love that rock 'n' roll Lovely party! My head used to swim From the perfume I smelled My hands kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt I'd taste her baby pink lipstick And that's when I'd melt She'd whisper in my ear Tonight she really was mine Get in front and put some hair oil on Buddy Holly was singing his last song With your arms around your girl You tried to sing along It felt pretty good Really had a good time Hot patootie, bless my soul I really love that rock 'n' roll Hot patootie, bless my soul I really love that rock 'n' roll One from the vaults. Oh, baby! Don't be upset. It was a mercy killing. He had a certain naive charm... ...but no muscle. But a deltoid And a bicep A hot groin And a tricep Makes me... ... shake Makes me want to take Charles Atlas By the hand In just seven days Oh, baby I can make you a man I don't want no dissension Just dynamic tension I'm a muscle fan In just seven days I can make you a man Dig it if you can In just seven days I can make you a man Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah! Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah! There are those who say that life is an illusion... ...and that reality is simply a figment of the imagination. If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe. However, the sudden departure of their host... ...and his creation... ...into the seclusion of his somber bridal suite... ...had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. A feeling which grew as the other guests departed... ...and they were shown to their separate rooms. Who is it? Who's there? It's only me, Janet. Brad, darling, come in. Oh, Brad! Yes, my darling! But what if...? Everything's going to be all right. Oh, I hope so, my darling. - It's you! - I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice? You beast, you monster! What have you done with Brad? Well, nothing. Why, do you think I should? You tricked me! I wouldn't have. I've never, never... Yes. Yes, I know. But it isn't all bad, is it? I think you'll really find it quite pleasurable. - So soft, so sensual. - Stop! I mean, help! Brad. Oh, Brad! Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this? Like this, like how? It's your fault! You're to blame! I was saving myself. Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet. Promise you won't tell Brad? Cross my heart and hope to die. Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here! It'll destroy us. Don't worry. We'll be away from here in the morning. Oh, Brad, you're so strong and protective. You! I'm afraid so, Brad. But isn't it nice? Why you... What have you done with Janet? Nothing. Why, do you think I should? You tricked me. I wouldn't have. I've never, never, never! Yes, I know. But it isn't all bad, is it? Not even half bad. I think you'll really quite enjoy it. - So soft. So sensual. - No, stop. Oh, Janet. Janet! Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this? Like this, like how? It's your fault! You're to blame. I thought it was the real thing! Oh, come on, Brad, admit it. You liked it, didn't you? There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure. Oh, Brad, you have wasted so much time already. Janet needn't know. I won't tell her. You promise you won't tell? On my mother's grave. Master, Rocky has broken his chains and vanished. The new playmate is loose and somewhere in the castle grounds. Magenta has just released the dogs. Coming! What's happening here? Where's Brad? Where's anybody? Oh, Brad! Brad, my darling, how could I have done this to you? Oh, If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons. Oh, Brad. What have they done with him? Brad, how could you? But you're hurt. Did they do this to you? Here. I'll dress your wounds. Baby, there. Oh. ""Emotion: Agitation or disturbance of mind... ...vehement or excited mental state."" It is also a powerful and irrational master. And from what Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their TV monitor... ... there seemed little doubt that Janet was indeed... ... its slave. Tell us about it, Janet. I was feeling done in Couldn't win I'd only ever kissed before You mean she...? I thought there's no use getting Into heavy petting It only leads to trouble And seat wetting Now all I want to know Is how to go I've tasted blood and I want more More, more, more. I'll put up no resistance I want to stay the distance I've got an itch to scratch I need assistance Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me I wanna be dirty Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me Creature of the night Then if anything grows While you pose I'll oil you up and rub you down Down, down, down. And that's just one small fraction Of the main attraction You need a friendly hand Oh, and I need action Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me I wanna be dirty Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me Creature of the night Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me I wanna be dirty Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me Creature of the night Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me I wanna be dirty Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me Creature of the night Creature of the night. Creature of the night? Creature of the night. Creature of the night. Creature of the night. Creature of the night Creature of the night. Creature of the night Mercy! How did it happen? I understood you were to be watching. I was only away for a minute, master. Well, see if you can find him on the monitor. Master. Master, we have a visitor. Hey, Scotty! Dr. Everett Scott. You know this earthling... - this person? I most certainly do. He happens to be an old friend of mine. I see. So this wasn't simply a chance meeting. You came here with a purpose. I told you, my car broke down. I was telling the truth. I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr. Everett Scott, his name is not unknown to me. He was a science teacher at Denton High. And now he works for your government. He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation... ...of that which you call UFOs! Isn't that right, Brad? He might be. I don't know. The intruder is entering the building, master. He'll probably be in the Zen Room. Shall we inquire of him in person? Great Scott! Frank N. Furter. We meet at last. Dr. Scott! Brad! What are you doing here? Don't play games, Dr. Scott. You know perfectly well what Brad Majors is doing here. It was part of your plan, was it not? That he and his female should check the layout for you? Well, unfortunately for you all, the plans are to be changed. I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott. I know Brad is. I assure you, Brad's presence comes as a complete surprise to me. I came here to find Eddie. - Eddie? I've seen him. He's... - Eddie? What do you know of Eddie? I know a great deal about a lot of things. You see, Eddie happens to be my nephew. Dr. Scott. - Janet! - Dr. Scott! - Janet! - Brad! Rocky! - Janet! - Dr. Scott! - Janet! - Brad! Rocky! Listen! I made you... ...and I can break you just as easily. Master, dinner is prepared! Excellent. Under the circumstances, formal dress is to be optional. Food has always played a vital role in life's rituals: The breaking of bread, the last meal of the condemned man... ...and now this meal. However informal it might appear... ... you can be sure there was to be very little bonhomie. A toast. To absent friends. To absent friends. And Rocky. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Rocky - Happy birthday... - Shall we? We came here to discuss Eddie. Eddie! It's a rather tender subject. Another slice, anyone? Excuse me. I knew he was in with a bad crowd, but it was worse than I imagined. Aliens! Dr. Scott! Go on, Dr. Scott. Or should I say Dr. Von Scott? Just what exactly are you implying? It's all right! That's all right, Brad. From the day he was born He was trouble He was the thorn In his mother's side She tried in vain But he never caused her Nothing but shame He left home... ... the day she died From the day she was gone All he wanted Was rock 'n' roll porn Und a motorbike Shooting up junk He was a low-down, cheap little punk Taking everyone for a ride When Eddie said He didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no-good kid But when he threatened your life With a switchblade knife - What a guy - Makes you cry Und I did Everybody shoved him I very nearly loved him I said, hey, listen to me Stay sane inside insanity But he locked the door And threw away the key But he must've been drawn Into something Making him warn me In a note which reads: What's it say? What's it say? ""I'm out of my head Oh, hurry, or I may be dead They mustn't carry out Their evil deeds"" When Eddie said He didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no-good kid When he threatened your life With a switchblade knife - What a guy - Makes you cry Und I did When Eddie said He didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no-good kid But when he threatened your life With a switchblade knife - What a guy - Woe, woe, woe - Makes you cry - Hey, hey, hey Und I did Hey Oh. Oh, Rocky! How could you?! This way! This way! Shut up! I'll tell you once I won't tell you twice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss Your apple pie Don't taste too nice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss I've laid the seed It should be all you need You're as sensual as a pencil Wound up like an E or first string When we made it Did ya hear a bell ring? You got a block Well, take my advice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss The transducer Will seduce ya My feet! I can't move my feet! My wheels! My God, I can't move my wheels. It's as if we were glued to the spot. You are. So quake with fear, you tiny fools. We're trapped. It's something you'll get used to A mental mind fuck can be nice No! You won't find Earth people the easy mark you imagine. This sonic transducer... ...it is some kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device? - You mean...? - Yes, Brad. It's something we ourselves have been working on for a while. But it seems our friend here has found a means of perfecting it. A device capable of breaking down solid matter... ...and then projecting it through space, and who knows... ...perhaps even time itself! He's gonna send us to another planet? Planet schmanet, Janet. You'd better wise up Janet Weiss You'd better wise up Build your thighs up You'd better wise up And then she cried out: Stop! Don't get hot and flustered Use a bit of mustard You're a hot dog But you'd better not... ... try to hurt her Frank Furter You're a hot dog But you'd better not... ... try to hurt her Frank Furter You're a hot dog My God! I can't stand any more of this. First, you spurn me for Eddie, then you toss him like an old coat for Rocky. You chew people up and then you spit them out again. I loved you. Do you hear me? I loved you. And what did it get me? I'll tell you, a big nothing. You're like a sponge. You drain others of their love and emotion. Well, I've had enough! Choose between me and Rocky, so named because of the rocks in his head. It's not easy, having a good time. Even smiling makes my face ache. And my children turn on me. Rocky's behaving just the way that Eddie did. Maybe I made a mistake... ...splitting his brain between the two of them. I grow weary of this world! When shall we return to Transylvania?! Magenta... ...I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother, Riff Raff. You have both served me well. Loyalty such as yours shall not go unrewarded. You'll discover that when the mood takes me, I can be quite generous. I ask for nothing, master. And you shall receive it in abundance! Come. We are ready for the floorshow. And so, by some extraordinary coincidence... ...fate, it seemed, had decided that Brad and Janet... ...should keep that appointment with their friend Dr. Everett Scott. But it was to be in a situation... ...which none of them could have possibly foreseen. And just a few hours after announcing their engagement... ...Brad and Janet had both tasted... ...forbidden fruit. This in itself was proof... ...that their host was a man of little morals... ...and some persuasion. What further indignities were they to be subjected to? And what of the floorshow that had been spoken of? In an empty house... ...in the middle of the night? What diabolical plan... ...had seized Frank's crazed imagination? What indeed? From what had gone before, it was clear... ...that this was to be no picnic.

A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter. You're going to kill him? - What's his crime? - You saw what became of Eddie. Society must be protected. Exactly, Dr. Scott. Now, Frank N. Furter, your time has come Say goodbye to all of this... ...and hello to oblivion. No. No. No! Good God! You killed them. But I thought you liked them. They liked you. They didn't like me! They never liked me! You did right. A decision had to be made. You're okay by me. Dr. Scott... ...I'm sorry about your nephew. Eddie? Yes, well, perhaps it was for the best.

Ms. Roberts, has it ever happened before that so many thousands of rounds of ammunition were fired into the dormitories in such a short period of time? It happened many times before here. Kent State, the Orangeburg Massacre-- 27 kids were shot at that one. Or Jackson State or Houston, any one of a dozen others. Students are slaughtered by trigger happy police, and nothing is ever done about it. Besides Billy Jack, who else was shot? How many were actually killed? There were three deaths, and two still on the critical list. Dr. Bernard Russert, Dr. Russert. Has Washington replied to your request for an investigation? Are you kidding? Remember after Kent State how Attorney General John Mitchell said there was no need to explore the causes of the killings because he knew in advance the causes couldn't possibly be the National Guard or the police. But didn't an FBI report subsequently prove that there were no shots fired by the students but there was grave culpability on the part of the Guard? They sure did. But, as usual, Washington did nothing about it. Does this mean that it's the end of the school? Will you have to close it down now? Maybe. Maybe not. I honestly don't know at this point. I'm sorry, folks, Ms. Roberts is very tired. You're going to have to leave. Thank you, Ms. Roberts. My publisher still thinks that it's vital that a book be done about your school and how the massacre happened there. I wouldn't even know where to begin. Maybe you could start with the arrest of Billy Jack. Wasn't it what happened at the trial that made you so determined to make the school succeed? Yes. That was-- what-- four, four and half years ago. Wasn't Billy Jack's main belief that a man who doesn't go his own way is nothing? That's right. That's why they tried Billy. But we all knew that what they were really trying was each man's right to find his own center, to follow his own conscience and to do his own thing without hurting or interfering with anybody else's. That ideal, to all of us, was Billy Jack. What your saying, then, is that it doesn't make any difference to you whether this jury finds you innocent or guilty, and it doesn't make any difference to you whether you live or die. You expect us to believe that you have absolutely no fear of the death penalty? I have a lot of fear, but I have a lot more respect. Long ago I learned that he is my constant companion. He eats with me, he walks with me, he even sleeps with me. I'm sorry, I must have missed something back there. Who is this faithful companion of yours? - Death. - Oh, I see. Tell me, is this death companion business some special part of your Indian beliefs? No. Every one of us has death as his constant companion. He sits with every one of us every second of our lives, only we're too terrified to really think about that, but once you do, it will completely change your entire outlook on life. How so? You ask yourself, even in the most serious crisis, how important would this really be if I were suddenly told that I just had one more week to live? So, you learn to take nothing too seriously. On the other hand, you ask yourself, if this were my last act on earth, is this what I really want to do? So you learn on the one hand to be detached from the temporary things of this world, and on the other hand you learn to appreciate every little thing in it all the more. During the trial, Sheriff Cole resigned, and Posner, who never really quite recovered from the death of his son, sold out all of his companies to his brother the banker, and he quietly left town. And though we were happy about it then, it turned out to be one of the worst things that ever happened to us. The prosecution, for it's part, savagely attacked our character and tried to make it look like I wasn't even raped. So Miss Garrison lies, and you swear to it. - Objection. - Sustained. Now, Ms. Roberts, isn't it true that you were never raped? Isn't it true that you made up this story in a desperate attempt to try and justify the violent and insane killing by the man you love? Objection. Order. I feel terribly sorry for your children, Mr. Williams. You feel sorry for my children? Yes, and you, too. You know me, and you know I don't lie. It must be terribly degrading for you to pretend in front of all of these people, that I do, just to earn your money. Yes, I was proud to go through West Point. I was taught there a code of honor and manliness that, while it went overboard at times, I basically liked. Yet you brought charges against your own officers, including two staff commanders and a general. That's right. I charged them with the deliberate and senseless slaughtering of innocent women and children in the field either directly or by men under their command, and by failing to report these atrocities or covering them up with full knowledge of same. And after you proffered these charges, the Army suddenly made up charges against you, of cowardice in the field, and they offered to drop these charges against you if you would drop them against the officers. That's correct. And did you refuse to drop the charges? I did refuse Could you please tell us in your own words exactly what led up to your refusing to obey this order in the field? Was it before or after My Lai? It was about seven months before My Lai. We were out on a search-and-destroy mission on a small South Vietnamese hamlet. Just like at My Lai, there had been plenty of advance warnings, so when we got there, there was no resistance, no military in sight. Not a shot was fired. All the village was filled with was women, children, and old men. They were frightened and very eager to please, so we quickly herded them up into a ditch, and we sat around waiting for several hours for some word from headquarters as to what we were to do with them. People in the meantime were kept in the ditch in the boiling sun, and were not allowed to relieve themselves or go for any water. Get them in the ditch! Way down to the end. There must be some mistake. There's no mistake, sir. The order was perfectly clear. Get me headquarters on the phone again. Give me that phone. I want to hear it myself. If you fellows refuse, all hell can break loose. You know that. Are you absolutely sure, sir? There can be no mistake down the line? Yes, sir. I understand, sir. Waste them. You mean the civilians? That's the order, clear as hell. Direct from Saigon. We're to waste them. All right, all you men on your feet. Think clearly, now. You disobey this order, and they can hang you. Lock and load! God almighty. What's happening to us? Aim! Fire! So it was this senseless slaughter and sadistic brutality coming as official orders from Washington that turned you against America. No, not really. In war, when you've brainwashed men to become cold-blooded killers, you expect them to kill. Then what was it that made you bitter toward America? - Lieutenant Calley. - Lieutenant Calley? You mean because he was tried for war crimes at My Lai? No, he should have been tried. And so should all those Colonels and Generals and White-House Aids who ordered the whole affair but were mysteriously let off soot-free. Then why Lieutenant Calley? Because America made him into such a great hero. To me they were sick and diseased men filled with evil, who cut innocent women's throats and blew out the brains of babies, and America had raised him up and made him an national idol. What was that part about the President switching his colors? On December 8 1969, every newspaper in this country carried President Nixon's sacred promise that he would personally investigate My Lai and he would personally see to it that everyone involved, if they were found guilty, was punished to the full limit of the law. And so you feel that since every officer involved to date has gone free, Nixon failed his pledge. Like any other mealy-mouth sell-out politician, when he found out that he could get more votes by supporting Calley, he did a complete flip flop. And when I saw that the American people supported him in this, I knew then that the American conscience was dead and that the great spirit of this nation, which to me began back in Boston and Virginia duflng the American Revolution, that it could never again be revived. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a decision? We have, Your Honor. We the it""!!! Unanimously find Billy Jack guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Well, that's that. I think you'll find that the end of your little school out there, Doc. Well, it's not my school, but, I'll take a bet on it. Billy Jack wasn't the center of power of that school. Who, then? Jean? You know, to prove something for Billy, she's going to make that place grow and grow. My guess is it's going to take off like a brush fire. That quiet little girl? That quiet little girl, my butt. That's like saying a rattle snake's got a quiet little bite. For all our sakes, I hope your wrong. Respecting your good intentions, Doc, when people have such wildly different attitudes, there's no way they are going to live together without generating violence. We've all had too much of that already. So, Though the trial of Billy Jack as a person was over and he was sentenced from 5-15 years in the state penitentiary, the kids decided that Billy Jack was really kind of a symbol to live by and that the Trial of Billy Jack as that kind of an ideal, had just begun. So they immediately set out to make the school bigger and better than ever before. That first year that Billy was in prison, they found an old abandoned Military Academy, which they renovated entirely by themselves, begging, borrowing and scrounging everywhere they could for money or materials to make it go. Listen, everybody. I just had a bakery that donated 100 loaves of bread. The entire school was built and owned by the kids, and they governed themselves on the simple philosophy that where there is power, there can never be love, and where there is love, there's no need for power. Knowing that you can't really deal and understand other people until you first understand yourself, every program was based on learning how to cope and understand your own feelings first in order to understand and relate to other people. This philosophy they carried into everything, from meditation and body awareness exercises, all kinds of dance, even belly dancing. Music, band, drill team, arts, crafts, advanced physics, mathematics, psychology, the classics, even into athletics, which they called yoga athletics. From yoga tennis to yoga football, and every sport in between. The idea always being that the thrill of participating and the self discipline one develops while training, preparing and learning, made one a winner for the rest of his life, no matter how well he played or how the temporary contest came out. And so winning and losing or worrying about someone grading your efforts was just not all that important anymore. Growing and having the fun and privilege of doing-- that was everything. I heard something about taking the grant that was given as part of the deal for Billy Jack's surrender and then building a radio station or a recording studio or something like that. That's right. They went out and sold their own recordings door to door and the royalties really helped the school to continue to grow.  At last our day is here  The day we both did fear  To show this love inside  We can no longer hide  Just to touch you now  To show you how  I've wanted you  To want me, too  To give my love  All my love  To you With some of the royalties, they started an institute for child abuse and children's rights, and in working with these abused and orphaned children, they were stunned to find out what was secretly going on in children's orphanages and juvenile courts, state institutions for disturbed and retarded children, children's hospitals, and education in general. Was that when they started their Nader-type newspaper and magazine and then began those scorching exposs on government corruption and consumer rip-off. That's right. And it was in doing those exposs that our troubles really began. We've been digging. Remember back in December of '73 when the-- the Interior Department, called in, was it 250 oil executives to work on the fuel allocation, right? So we started digging behind that, and we found out that the oil barons and the White House manipulated the whole energy crisis, including the Israeli war, for just unbelievable profits. It makes the Alaskan pipeline look like kids' stuff. But are you aware what could happen? I mean, that could blow the dome off the capitol. I mean we'd have the FBI, the CIA, the plumbers, the plumbers' plumbers, the sequel to the plumbers... it'd be a tremendous blow. You know what they can do? If we don't tell our sources they can arrest us. Just like that. She's absolutely right, I mean, it happened in '72. The LA Times spent $200,000 in legal fees defending their reporters who were subpoenaed to reveal their sources. I mean that's the LA Times. We don't stand a chance. They're either gonna blow us up altogether, or they're just gonna close the school down. I want to do an expose on the IBM ribbon conspiracy. The fantastic reader response made the kids determined to bring these exposes to a wider public so they decided to build their own TV station. They put on a Fourth of July- type fundraising drive which they called ""1984 is closer than you think. And it culminated in the largest drill team and band marathon ever held in this country. Kids came from all over the US and Canada at their own expense, and every day and night the donated coliseum was filled. Just pull it down. Hurry up. You're on next. Wanting to love you not wanting you to know   I love you  Whoa I love you Was that before or after Billy got out of prison? No, it was just before. I remember because Ford had just shocked the nation by pardoning Nixon and agreeing to let him destroy the tapes. We were all so angry at the way politicians at every level of government constantly used television to lie, con and manipulate people. Oh, I know. I covered a candidate in California once who had campaign contributions from the oil companies. Would you believe he dared to advertise himself as the one the oil companies feared the most? That's right. And because of things like that the kids decided to fight fire with fire before it was too late. I mean, look at how they packaged Nixon as the law and order candidate who would bind the nation's wounds and bring us all together. Well, we all bought it. That's right. So the kids decided to use television to fight television before it was too late. And they took their investigations being done in the magazines right into the streets where the public could see for themselves the secret deals and rip-offs right where they were happening. So in other words, Mrs. Childs, you missed one payment while you were in the hospital. No, I missed three payments. I was behind before I went into the hospital. Okay. So you missed three payments and then they repossessed your furniture. And when you went to make up the payments, you had found that they destroyed your furniture and repossessed it and now they refuse to refund the money to you on which you paid on it two years before they repossessed it. - Now ,is that correct? - Honey, that's correct. Twenty-three years in this town doing a helluva job, just following orders, and because of one crazy nigger, I'm dead. It's not the woman. It's that school and their TV station. I think the manager's going to come out. Get on camera two. Okay. All right. Excuse me. Um, we think as assistant manager that we should have the store's side of the story so that we can have all of the viewpoints presented fairly. May we have a comment? No comment. We were just trying to be fair, sir. We tried. Hello? Yes, sir. Just a minute, please. Telephone, Mr. Bromner. It's the home office. Yes, sir. Well, thank you, sir. It's a tough situation. Right. Well, I just went according to the manual, sir. Right away. Replace the old lady's furniture. With used furniture? With brand-new. It just hit the wire services. Those crazy, lousy kids. What do they think, I wanted to take the old lady's furniture? It was shortly after that they started bugging our phones and the FBI started making mysterious and routine calls to the school pretending that it was was for clearances for the federal grant that the government had been giving us ever since Billy Jack surrendered. I guess it was at that point that I really should have realized and made the kids stop. Did you have proof that your phones were bugged? Yeah, one of the kids, a graduate of Cal Tech, I think, not only developed a device which could tell us when our phone was being tapped but he and another couple of electronic geniuses developed a lie detector that was even more accurate than the polygraph machine. I don't get it, how does it work? Well, just by a person's voice alone, off the telephone or off or off the television. It's even more accurate than a normal lie detector. I don't believe it. Well, watch the-- Watch the thing and watch the needle. And so it is your contention then, Governor, that the threat of exposure by the Freedom School television station will in no way find any wrongdoing or kickback of this federal money ever touching the state capitol? As God is my judge, Mr. Mudd, if there were a stack of Bibles on this table before me, I swear to you that I have absolutely no knowledge of any kind of corruption by any member of my staff. - Not one. - Wow. Good Lord, that guy's lying through his teeth. Grover, think of what this machine would do to the advertising industry, it'd just blow it apart. Think of what we could have saved on the Watergate hearings. - Yeah. - Yeah. I've got an idea. Why don't we get the tapes to the Watergate hearings and run them off on this thing and finally find out the truth? Pardon me, Mrs. Merrick, we're from the FBI and, uh, we'd just like to ask you a few routine questions about your child. Is something wrong? No, uh, does she go to the Freedom School? Yes, sir. Do you know about the TV station that they operate? Yes, sir. Does she have anything to do with that? No. No, she doesn't. Now, during all this time Billy was in prison, did you visit him regularly? No. Billy's humiliation at being caged up like an animal was so great that he wouldn't let any of us visit him. Ever. For all four years? Didn't you miss him? Terribly. But he wrote to me every day and that helped keep me going. Except, every time the mail came, I held my breath, hoping he hadn't given them an excuse to extend his sentence or even kill him. Have the doctors told you if you'll be able to walk normally again? Of course she'll be able to walk normally again. So you really didn't think they'd let Billy out of prison alive? No, not even if they had to shoot him when he was going through the gates on parole. Bet you remember that day when he got out. I sure do. It was the day we had our first international seminar on child abuse. Child abuse? Yeah, the kids had done an expose on child abuse, child battering, and how widespread it is here in this country. Pretty soon, we became recognized as one of the few places that could successfully help parents who battered their children. This is our one-to-one type therapy. Almost all of it is done by lay therapists. Our kids here at the school. Was the boy born without his hand? No, his father cut it off in a fit of rage. It's a horrible history of torture. All of our professional staff has pretty much given up on him. Only Carol refuses to take no for an answer. You don't really think she'll succeed? You obviously don't know Carol. Okay, tough monkey. Time to shower up for the press. Go ahead. You're just a couple of hours away from freedom. Go ahead and give me one of those fancy kicks. Now, Indian Buck, move out. So in summary then, you're saying to love those that we find really despicable, that we really can hate, and I can really hate these people that cut off the fingers and beat their children, and somehow in the experience of loving them, they are going to change before our eyes and stop beating their children. That's it, exactly. As you know, in a normal parent-child relationship, the parent is there to supply the child's needs. But, in the case of the child abuser, the parent is so desperate for love, he expects the child to fulfill his needs. Well, when the child can't do it, or is incapable or for whatever reason, the parent ends up beating him. I'm sure some of you have experienced this, say, of some parents that have watched their children in little league? We find that one child usually becomes the scapegoat. It's usually the child most resembling the parent doing the abusing. You know, when you think about it, there are many, many kinds of child abuse. But it's only when it breaks out in physical violence that we recognize it as something horrible. Dr. Roberts, your complete claim then is that by loving these battering parents instead of punishing or confining them, that that actually works in stopping further beating of their children. Absolutely. You're involved in child abuse, and I'll bet you're using some form of punishment, threat, or maybe even jailing, I don't know. Now, you know your cure rate is less than 25 percent. Ours, on the other hand, is over 90. Dr. Roberts? - I'm sorry. - I beg your pardon. Go ahead. The whole fate of the human race depends upon our ability to handle and recognize normal aggression and the hostility in us. Now, have you thought about applying this to other areas of our society? Yes, as an example, this entire school here is built upon the same principle. And we would fervently like to try it in other areas. What Jean has really taught us here and in the child abuse center, is that everyone has inside of them a fantastic force, and it can really change people once it's unleashed. So that's where the school gets its pacifism? I'm sorry, I just can't stomach that word pacifism. Because when people hear that we're pacifists, they automatically feel we're sitting around waiting and sometimes even retreating from life, whereas we feel the thing that we've got here is a living, dynamic, positive force that has the ability to change the most warped lives, turn on the most confused and lost people and I think we all literally feel here that it could possibly rebuild the world. Is this what you call nonviolence? No, I'm sorry. We call it by something much cornier than that. We call it love. - Can any of us go along? - No. Billy, there's a big press contingent waiting for you up in my office. And I think it would be a good idea for you and me to get together and talk about what we're going to say. That it? Billy, it would be to everyone's advantage if you would cooperate with Warden Cells. He's a hard head. He'll be back. No way. They've already got him marked. You mean they'll kill him?  Oh what a life what a life On a Saturday night oh Lordie J""  Oh what a life what a life On a Saturday night oh Lordie J"" He's coming. He's coming. You're not little Carol? And Sunshine? Carol, could you come in here a minute? Billy. Billy, Carol wrote a tune, uh, especially for you when you went away, and I think we should hear it about right now. Why don't we all kind of be quiet and listen.  Shed a tear Running Deer  Don't turn back Billy Jack  I am crying  Are you dying just for me? Whenever trouble came about  I could feel you coming out   You were there I could feel you in the air  J"" When anyone had a happy moment to share   You were there When anyone had a burden they couldn't bear  You were there to share the load   Shed a tear Running Deer  Don't turn back Billy Jack   I am crying Are you dying just for me?   When they took you   from the church  I couldn't bear to watch the town stare   You aren't an animal You're a man   It wasn't fair It just wasn't fair  J"" And they tried you for murder, they said you were guilty it just wasn't fair  Wanted to tell them they were unjust   I didn't dare I could only stare  What will happen to you now?  You've got to live but I don't know how  I am crying are you dying just for me?   Shed a tear Running Deer  Don't turn back Billy Jack I am crying are you dying just for me?  Thank you. Nope, I missed. Mike? Hai. - Karate? - Hapkido. I know that, but what are you doing in it? What do you mean by that? It's just funny, I'm sorry. You're such a timid, squeaky clean little mouse. I thought you were supposed to be nonviolent, for God's sakes. Even the Buddhist monks had to learn something to keep from being attacked. Think about all those men out there who'd like to get her hands on their sexy little body. Think about all the men out there who'd like to get their hands on her sexy little body. Here, let me help you. All I care about right now is my own body. My God, you broke my back. Billy, I'd like you to meet Mr. Han from Korea. A hapkido master here in the United States. How do you do. I have had the honor of hearing about your kicks in Korea. Thank you. Is it true, do you really-- Can you jump the spin kick? After you. Be my guest. Just hold it, like that. I haven't seen one of those in a long time. Would you like to try it? After you. Be my guest. You and I and my master are the only ones I know who can do that. Thank you very much. Running Deer and his two sons have been lost for almost a week in that snow storm up in the Taos mountains. Blue Elk wants to know if any of our skiers or any of the kids from the survival program can go up and search. How about the rescue patrol, Blue Elk? Have they been notified? The highway patrol and the ranger stations, they don't give a damn when Indians are involved. At the rangers station all they could tell us is that he's probably out drunk someplace and they refused to help us. Okay. I'll get the sheriff. Carol, you go get some of the kids in their winter gear. And tell them to dress warm 'cause it's a terrible blizzard up there. The family has been starving for weeks. The father and the two sons went out after deer, and they're probably lost in that storm up on Independence Ridge. See if you can get a chopper into Latigo Canyon. If not, try to get someone to ski down the other side of Independence. Over. There's no way I can get it open. Okay. Uh, Ground Control, Ground Control, over. This is Ground Control. Over. We're moving down the south range and will try to get in with some ground equipment. Over. Ground rescue is underway. Team three, is there any way you can get around the storm? Try to come in east of the Taos divide? This is air rescue four. We're over the Taos divide right now. It's just as socked in up here. Looks like it's moving south. What about ski patrol? Over. They're all over the place but the blizzard's so bad on the ground they can't even see. Stand by. Uh, this is chopper seven, the only way you would get down there is to lift them up these ridges and let them ski in. Over. They're being lifted now. Over. Ground, this is chopper seven. We found two of them, two boys. one's dead. The other one's almost. Alert central we're on the way. This is instrument four, instrument four calling. Can anybody read me? Please somebody come over. Somebody please, damn it, come on in. Rescue three, I've been getting a weak signal that keeps fading in and cutting out and it could be coming from the other side of these peaks. Let's go have a look. Is he alive? Just barely, and I can't get anybody on this thing. No. You never will with these peaks. Can you get below this storm down over on Independence Ridge? I can try. Go. All right. Let's take this one down to the Morgue, huh? Sheriff. I'm really sorry. Why are you bringing him in here? That's what they told me to do with him. Well, he goes down to city hospital. Bundle him up good and go with him in the ambulance. Ambulance? Where are you taking him? - Down to the Indian Hospital. - Well, that will waste time. Why not treat him here? I wouldn't do it if I thought it were dangerous. You mean you can't even keep an Indian here one or two days in an emergency? Look, I'm just an intern. I don't make the rules. Well, you're not gonna move him. He could lose a hand or a foot. - Well-- - Tell me. What would you do if he were a white man and you could treat him? Well, I'd pack his extremities and start him on some vasodilator of IVs. Show me. You could be arrested for making me do this. You know that. Now. What the hell is going on here? Vasodilator IVs for each one. Come on, Doctor. I'll take the responsibility. And bring those packs over here and start applying them to their lower legs and I'll take the hands. And raise them up. Come on, Doctor, move. My client Running Deer wishes to have it entered into the record that it is his position that the Indian is a member of the Sovereign Nation and is not subject to the laws of this land and this state. And that therefore, this court has no jurisdiction. So entered. Your Honor, in so far as the defendant is still hospitalized, and in addition has suffered the severe personal hardship of the loss of his oldest son, the state petitions the court for leniency and pleads for a lesser sentence. Hey, don't rip your pants, buster. In view of the voluntary pleading and the personal hardships encountered, the court reduces the mandatory sentence for trespassing and illegal hunting of deer from one year minus a day in jail to ten days in the county jail. Quiet. Quiet. And a period of probation to be not less than one year. Bailiff. Bailiff. Oh, Lord. Now what are they being hassled for? All right, Ken. Tell headquarters that we don't need any more help. I demand to know what's going on here. Look, lady, mind your own business. Get back in your car. This is my business. These are my students, now tell me what's going on. Lady, they were disturbing the peace, we got a report of possession. We're just checking it out. Now, I suggest you stand back or I will arrest you for interference. You just try it. Hey, they can't search you unless they've got a warrant. All right, punk. Move it out. I've got every right to stand here, I'm a citizen. Well, so am I, punk, now move it out. They have no right to search you without a warrant. Tell them so, out loud, and they'll be in contempt of court. What the hell do you think you're doing? It's your choice, lady. You can do as you're told or get your head split open. Listen, buster, you're not gonna feel me up. I'll search you right here, or in the paddy wagon. It's your choice. Jim, you're out of line, now knock it off. Well, my dear. You can feel me up right here, in the bus or the lawn. Anywhere you want to do it. Well, can't win them all. All right, folks. Move it. We aren't gonna ask you again, now move it. Okay alley lawyer. You can go now. Unless you've got something else to say. Hey, we've got a tough monkey here. Feels he don't have to move off like the others. Okay, mister. You were ordered to disperse. And that means now. Somebody else need a lesson? Yeah, our tough monkey here. Say, isn't that-- We're gonna have to shoot him. Too big a mess. Billy, you heard what the sheriff said. You just can't keep doing this. Well, what would you rather I did, then? Let them club him to death? Under alienation and guardianship the government has the right to sell, trade or give away all the Indian land to whomever it pleases. Yeah. Which are usually their friends who put up campaign funds. And under guardianship they control our water, they control our plumbing, they control our worship, they control our land and they control our money. They control every damn thing in our lives. Mr. Strump. As our agent, we want to know what you going to do. What the Congress declared was a bill giving you self-determination. Hah! Congress is a bunch of filthy rotten, lying thieves. And to get some industry in here by either leasing or selling this land which isn't worth a damn to anybody anyway. If it isn't worth a damn, why the hell are all these oil companies and mining interests so eager to get their hands on it? We'd like to know, Agent Strump. Tell us. Yellow Hawk, give us those statistics which show how many jobs will be provided for here on the reservation by these people. That's not Yellow Hawk. That's little uncle Tommy Hawk. He's what Crazy Horse called a loaf around the fort. He's a bought and paid apple and you know it. It happens every time you radical activists come in here. You tear up everything and then you skip out. And it's the children and those of us that are left behind that have to stay and take the beating. My father was a tribal chairman. And my grandfather was a man of medicine for many years. And I'm an activist. He doesn't mean you, Blue Elk. - He means me. - And me. And in a sense he's right. They do have to put up with pressure every day. - They control our-- - How's it going? Not very good, I'm afraid. And you know who the trustee is. It's Posner's First National Bank. In this state. And he's got $80 million of Indian money in his trust. I thought we were here to discuss Running Deer. To get the tribal permission to use him as a test case for international law before the world court. We've got names, we've got dates and exact amounts, and we're going to bring it out in international court. A person could get killed with foolish talk like that. Many of us already have been. Because if they can't buy us out with scholarships and grants, they kill us. Yeah. Well, what happened? They voted it down. And that damned Yellow Hawk will probably get a personal invitation to the White House for that. I don't understand. How in the world do they keep him in line so? They caught him embezzling funds and the White House promised to hush it up if he'd cooperate. You know, the same old story. Why don't you guys take Running Deer's case to world court just by yourselves? I mean, you don't have to bother with all these committee and tribal decision things. Well, that just divides us by having Indian fighting Indian. You know, divide and conquer. That's the way that they've always beaten us. Now, that's your whole problem right there. - Hmm? - What? You got all chiefs and no Indians. That is so bad. I can't even believe it. That is really poor. That is really bad. If it's illegal for an Indian to go out and hunt deer, how come it's all of a sudden legal for you and your bunch? Because it's deer hunting season, and we've all got our licenses. That's why. Not on Indian land it isn't. Not for you anyway. It's still illegal. Carl, this is no longer Indian reservation land. It's all been terminated. The Indians won't accept that. Besides, this land's sacred to them. There'll be trouble. We do this every year, Carl. You know that. Yeah, but you don't lock up a starving Indian every year. Tempers are still pretty hot over that one. Carl, on this bus we've got corporation presidents, Pentagon officials, Washington politicians, and even the lieutenant governor. You big ignorant pig. - Who you calling a p_ig? - I'm calling you a plg. With all of those big wheels back there, do you expect me to go say, ""Sorry, we gotta all go home""? Order. Order, order! Order! Crazy drunks. Shooting at anything that moves. Our women and children are afraid to move out of their homes for water. Yeah! Who is it they're shooting? What are you talking about? Running Deer couldn't even kill a deer and feed his starving family. Right! Indians have to go hungry. But these trophy hunters, they come in here and they do as they damn please. And kill all the deer they want. Yeah! All right. The question is, what are we going to do about it. Let's run them out. I think we should take some cameras and go down and take some pictures of them and their call girls in the nude and turn them in to the newspaper. Hey. Better than that, better than that. Let's send them to their wives. --Got a right to hunt on Indian land. That's what the law students were trying to tell you before. That's no longer Indian land. That's part of the reservation that they've been quietly terminating for our own good. Not to me it isn't. What is that supposed to mean? I never voted for termination. Did anybody in this room ever vote for termination? No! Do you know of any tribal member who knowingly voted for termination? No! Then to me they're still illegally on Indian land and this tribal council has the authority to arrest them and drive them out. What do you mean, arrest them? Who's gonna do it? I will. The tribal police. Or anyone in this room who is man enough to go with me. Or tell me something. Are you afraid to stand up to the white man even when he's shooting at your wives and your children? No! Me and my rifle can be any place you say within half an hour. Now, they're calling this the international symposium on the law. And the American Indian legal rights-- And let me tell you guys something. The real purpose of this is to make it look like everybody's stealing from the Indians. Oh, come on, Posner. I've handled dozens of land sales of Indians and even I don't know what termination is. Do you? Look, these radical Indians are taking payoffs on all sides. Who cares? As long as they don't terminate my lease. I've only got 92 more years for it to run. Well, you sure as hell better hope that conference never takes place. Because if it does, we're all in for a lot of surprises. I order you to drop your guns. You sentence our brother Running Deer to jail for killing a deer to feed his starving children, and yet you dare to come here and do this? What, do you call this sport? I was wrong. I'll correct that injustice to the Indian. Well, tell me. Just how are you going to do that? He's already spent ten days rotting in your lousy jail like a caged animal. I'll give Running Deer a job. A good job. More money than he could possibly earn. Because he's an Indian? And you've got one pay scale for your whites and one for your Indians? Aw, come on, now. Don't be childish. All of you. You are all illegally trespassing on Indian land and you are all going to be tried by us. Here and now. If this is a tribal decision, where is Yellow Hawk and Little Bear? Probably back home sucking up your spit. Billy. I'm Lieutenant Governor Barnes. This is George Shipley. He's the president of Stonehearst Mining Company. This isn't Indian land. After it was terminated we purchased a leasehold on it. My company holds the rights to it and these men are here as my guests. How many days after the president signed that termination bill did your company get your leasehold? Oh, I can't, I can't remember. I don't see that has any bearing. How many days? The clay after termination was signed. And how much money did you just happen to contribute to the secret campaign fund? What did you say your name was? My name is George Shipley. I'm president of the Stonehearst Mining Company. You know, Shipley, I think I'll just kill you right where you stand. We've made a terrible mistake and you've got the upper hand for now. Take advantage of it and all you'll do is fan the flames of hatred higher. And then later on, all of us here, somehow, we'll get even. Trying us isn't going to solve anything. Blue Elk? Rolling Thunder? I know we don't think much of each other, but we're realists. Now, what the lieutenant governor has to say is true. You may feel good now, but you're gonna suffer later. All right. We'll not try you now. We'll just take a good clean picture of each and every one of you for future reference. Okay. You heard him. I want two lines here. Women to the front and men to the rear. And I want all the men to take off them hats. Now. Oh, you've really gone too far this time, Billy. You're making a terrible mistake photographing those men. You know, the last time one of you Posners uttered that lousy cliche, one of you got killed. Now tell me, don't you ever learn? You people back there. That means you too. Let's go. And I'll swear to God you're really gonna pay for this one. Take that hat off. I'm talking to you. Jean, how much more is gonna have to happen before you get those kids to pull back on those exposes? Taking pictures of those people just infuriated them. It made matters much worse. I know that, Carl. But I can't tell the kids on one hand I have complete confidence that they can govern themselves and then on the other hand take it away when there's an important decision to be made. Either you decide to trust them on the vital decisions, or you don't. It's as simple as that. Yes, but you can speak out, can't you? I mean get up and present your point of view. I don't see why you can't argue against something you think is bad or destructive. As long as the kids have the right to vote it down if they don't agree with you. Yeah, I know. But oftentimes kids have a tendency to hero worship and I just think if Billy or I got up and argued a point some of these kids would just blindly follow because they identify with us so much. And I'm sorry, I just don't think that's fair. What you're saying then is that when you get right down to it, you don't really believe they're adult enough to make their own decisions. Grandfather, I would be honored if you would teach me how to pierce the veil and go to that other world and make my own inward journey to find my own center. I would be honored, Grandfather, if you would teach me the way. You have many enemies in this world waiting to destroy you. If you are to survive, you will have to find peace in yourself first. That is why I want to make the inward journey. The inward journey is dangerous. Filled with terrifying evil. There are many demons of great power. It takes much wisdom to learn that they are of your own making. And first, you must learn to see your own shadow. How will I learn to see my shadow, Grandfather? Many cannot survive the dangerous inward journey. But if you do, in time you will come face to face with your own shadow. Then you will know what I mean. I think I see it, Grandfather. Yes, I see it clearly now. What color is it? Blue. Bright blue. That is a spirit looking to see if you are worthy. It takes many forms. Where did it go? When you can tell me where the flame comes from, I will tell you where it goes when it goes out. Grandfather, where will I look for my shadow demon? We think the spirits live out there but they and the shadow demon live inside you. He is all the evil in you that others can see in you but you cannot. Why is that? We all put forth an image that we want other people to think we are and that we'd like to think we are, but we all have the secret evil side that is painful to discover, though others can see it in us very easily. How can I come to know my evil side, Grandfather? By the things in others that make you angry. Whenever you get upset at someone or something, it's because that quality that you're upset about really exists in you. It is always easier to see the evil in someone else and by trying to change him, think you are getting rid of your own evil, your own shadow. It takes superhuman courage to see that this fault really exists in you. That what you're really hating and trying to change is a quality of yourself. Like the rugged man who hates long-haired youth. Underneath, he is secretly afraid of his own femininity. Grandfather, may I now descend to the cave of the dead? No, you are not yet ready. First, you must seek your own vision. When your heart is open, your vision will come. And only after you've received your vision will you have some chance to survive in the cave of the dead. Hello, Blue Elk. How long has Billy gone without food and water? Seven days now. And on the eighth, if he's worthy of it, his vision will come. But if a woman enters these sacred grounds the medicine is lost. You'll have to go back, I'm sorry. What are you guys gonna do when the women's lib hears about this? You'll have to take that up with the spirits. Come, Billy Jack. Come. For I am going to show you the true nature of the white man through all of history. Come and look with me over this river of time. Look out. There's St. Augustine, preaching the Christian creed of love to the Druid Britons, with the tips of their lances dripping with blood. Oh, and there's King Richard the Lionhearted, slaughtering the heathen until they convert to Christianity. Here you see the lie of that old romanticism you were taught about the Crusades as a boy. See how they butcher everyone in this village of Jews in the name of God and love? And remember that great brave Indian fighter, Kit Carson? Well, he had rounded up over 400 Navajo women, children and babies into this cave, and his men bravely and methodically shot them to death. What the white man calls the spread of civilization, his Christianity, and so-called democracy have a secret shadow. Greed and power. Look well into your own heart, my brother. See how much of your violence comes from the same lust for power over other people. We've got names, we've got dates and exact amounts and we're going to bring it out in international court. A person could get killed with foolish talk like that. No! That worked pretty well. Which one do you think goes next? Come on, try it. Let's try this one and see what happens. No good sons of bitches. Oh my God. I don't know where she gets the patience. You've gotta remember, Carol, Danny has been in over 20 foster homes, and he was even put in solitary confinement in one of the detention homes when he was 4 years old. He's never known anything but brutality and rejection. I understand all that. But what can I do about it? Every single expert told me he's hopeless. Honey, we can keep loving him and loving him no matter what he does. But you've got to remember he's going to have a hard time accepting that love because he's gonna be afraid that it will be torn away like everything else in his life. Because he's convinced he's so evil. So we just can never never get mad at him and more important we just cannot give up loving him. Oh, I'm not going to give up. But what I want to know is, while we're doing all this loving, who's supposed to be loving us? I'll love you, honey. This school has no legal right to detain the child. Now, if we have to find Danny's parents and get them to regain custody we will, and if that doesn't work, we'll have him committed to a mental hospital. You'll do what? Any attempt by your group, or Posner's group, or any other makes to attack this school through this child will be met by the finest lawyers and the most widespread publicity that money can buy. You're just trying to get back at us because we've exposed the filthy conditions of your state hospitals. Why don't you go and clean them up so they're fit for human beings? - You do that. - We have evidence the child is unhappy here, and is constantly going into fits of rage. Mister, you are so stupid it's unreal. Harry. Harry, this is not constructive. Now, it's clear that Jean is not going to give up the child without a legal battle, so if you want to see it through you're just going to have to take her to court. Fair enough. It shouldn't be too difficult to prove that this environment is too radical an environment to bring up a young child in. What you men are really saying is this constant harassment and this bugging of our telephones, it will all magically stop if we decide to give up the Indian rights seminar. Oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry. I haven't any idea what you're talking about. But I'm sure your phones aren't tapped. That's illegal without a court order. Would you go get bugger and tell him to bring the machine in here, please? So you can just go back and tell whoever sent you that they can just stop bugging our phones because we can knock out their bug anytime we want to. Is this phone now being tapped? Oh, yes. With an infinity type that is picking up everything being said in this room from this phone without you even lifting up the phone receiver. So, whenever we want to talk without anyone else listening in, we just call on Bugger. Bugger, hit the switch. You didn't turn this thing off, did you? - Turn off what? - I don't know, it's weird. It's gone blank, I can't hear anything. Well, check your relays. Mr. Posner, allegations have been made that the $80 million trust that was given to you by the Indian Bureau for the land sale was turned over to you as trustee, instead of the bank in Wyoming, and this is because of your heavy campaign contributions in Washington. Look, that's ridiculous. I'm not even aware of what campaign contributions my executive committee decides to make. But I do know that they are made on a strictly impartial basis. You mean you have no friends at all in Washington? I mean, there isn't anybody up there-- Well, certainly I-- Or any heavy campaign contributions? Certainly I have friends in Washington. Don't you? Now, what can I do for you, princess? Aren't you responsible for helping Eisenhower back in the '50s effect the transfer of Indian trust money to local banks here and throughout the state so that you could, uh, invest it at a great personal profit? Ah, well, that was quite a long time ago but no, no, that's not true. Absolutely not. What does it say? What does it say? Basically, it says the man is lying through his teeth. What's that ticking? I'm picking up a strange ticking sound from the transmitter. What's it sound like? The governor's putting the town under martial law. The town? Why the hell isn't he out here protecting the school? Something about fearing the kids coming in and retaliating. Oh, bull. That jackass would do anything for publicity. Well, as long as the laws work one way for the rich and one way for the rest of us, looks like there's only one thing left for us to do. Go in at nighttime and bomb the hell out of them. The police won't help us, we know that. And we also know that our nonviolence just gets us stomped on. The only thing those racist pigs will ever understand is terror. Wait a minute, Jocelyn. Why don't you quit using race as an excuse for your own neurosis. I don't think all these marches and protests and demonstrations accomplish anything. Oh yeah, well, look at Wounded Knee. Well, look at Wounded Knee. What was accomplished? Plenty. Frightened middle-class people who see things changing so fast around them, just when they are becoming humane and beginning to see that there is an injustice, they see violent demonstrations and flee like hell right back to where the politicians want them. She's exactly right. Why don't we come up with something different? Something that we really want to show the people in town we're not monsters and we don't go around clubbing people and throwing bombs. Michelle, come on. King tried that approach and tell me where is he today? Oh, come on. Come on. That's beside the point and you know it. The hell it is. I'm right on the point. Where's everything he's done, or anybody else for that matter? They blew it off like they blew off his head. To go in and bomb now is not acting, it's reacting to what they've done to us. And the guy who's making you react is in fact controlling you. I agree with Michelle. Instead of reacting to them, why don't we just once go in and do what's good for us? I'd like to add something to that if I might. Would you like to come up here and speak, Jean? Come on. I thought we were supposed to make our own decisions. Come on. All this ruckus isn't getting you anywhere. But doesn't she have a say so just like you do and she and she and she? Yeah, say so, say so, but she knows she's gonna get up, and make a speech that everybody in this room is going to follow blindly. That's right. I don't gotta tell you. Now, look, either we decide or Big Mama over there decides for us. Joanne. Joanne. Big Mama doesn't want to tell you what to do, she just has some thoughts she'd like to give. It's a crisis right now and you're trying to tell us what to do? That violates everything that you've taught us to believe. Here we go again. Here we go again. Well, it's about time. My God, at least someone's got common sense. What do you mean? Stopping these riots before they start. Thank God at least we've got a governor with guts. Aw, come on, Blue Elk. We came all the way up here just to see Billy. Well, I can't help that. You can't see him now. This is a gathering of medicine men. Some of them are using smoke from religious herbs and others are purifying themselves for Billy's sacred journey. This whole mountain is closed. You mean they purify themselves just to take drugs? No, no, only some do. And for them the smoke of the medicine is a divine spirit. If one is not totally prepared to meet him, if one has not fasted, or purified oneself thoroughly, or if outsiders interfere, the spirit would be angry and make Billy sick, or even take him away. Like when a kid is spaced? - Off in stony land? - No, no. You people don't know anything about the other world or about the power that can so easily kill you. So when like fools you take drugs for kicks or to get high, you run a great danger. And when something happens, all you can talk about is mental illness, or you describe it as suicide. Come on, Blue Elk. We know all that. But when can we see him? Tomorrow morning. Maybe. But you're going to have to wait half way down the mountain. - Now leave. - All right, you guys. Come on. You are going to descend to the cave of the dead, where our people were massacred. Be very careful, because there are many spirits there who would like to take you with them. And others who do not want to pass on to the next world, so they would like to enter and possess your body. The souls of these dead wreak for vengeance and they will know your heart. If it is that of a white man, you will not survive. I am ready, Grandfather. There will be demons also. If you show any fear, they will tear you to pieces and the ghosts will possess your soul. If you show you are not afraid no matter what they do, the demons will stop terrifying you and become your friends. Are you afraid? You once taught me that courage is not the absence of fear, Grandfather, but the conquest of it. I am ready. Beware most of all the red-eyed demon. By his screams you will know him. He is the most powerful of all the demons and because you will do much good if you survive, he will kill you on the spot if you show any fear. Good luck. No cobras live in this country, my friend. I know who you are and I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I've got to go down the tunnel. You're me. I am loweklow. Your inner self. Someday, when you fully accept your fate and your death, then you will have me as your inner guide, but for now, you are to go to the desert and learn from the maiden. I'm sorry, I just can't understand all that's happening here. But that's your trouble. You always try to think and understand everything with your head instead of just feeling it with your heart. Now go and just experience what the maiden offers you. Billy Jack, over here. Now who are you? And where are we? I am here to show you the way to the house of the great one. But first you must prove yourself generous of heart. All right. I'm ready. Go and slap him in the face and no matter what he does, do not strike back. And no matter what he does, I'm not to hit him back? That's right. Run, get going, run there. Go, go. I've got a little bet. No way. I don't think you're going to particularly like this. Why, you stupid son of a-- That man was on the lowest level and reacts only with animal instinct. Treated with violence, he was immediately pulled down to the violent animal level. No better than the man that hit him. And so he ends up being controlled by the animal in the man who hit him. Hit another. War of honor is something that went out in the Middle Ages. War today is nothing but economic gain, economic gain for a few individuals in this country who control the top, top companies in this country. These companies go all the way to soft drink manufacturers, all the way to prepackaged foods. EXCUSE me a moment. This is gonna seem as stupid to you probably as it does to me, but-- He was on the second level. He could not be pulled down to the level of the brute beast acting on physical violence, but was easily pulled away from what he was doing and lost control of his own center. So he too did not own his own soul, but could quickly be controlled by another. Once again. Forgive me, I have no idea why I am doing this. I feel sorry for you. Only a child thinks that being a man is being tough and violent. Someday you may learn that being a man has to do with self-discipline over one's time and one's emotion with a deep and... compassionate understanding for other people's feelings. This man has reached the third level where he is his own person, so that no man can force him to react, thereby control his actions or take anything away from him. But what about the fourth level? Who told you of the fourth level? I don't know, nobody told me about the fourth level, it just kind of popped into my head, that's all. Look, can I go to my spiritual guide now? You may never go to him. He comes when he wills. And of yet, you are not ready. So why not? I thought I just conquered my demon. You just met him, and learned that your own worst demon is yourself. Your task now is to come to thoroughly know your shadow and accept it, and by accepting your weaknesses and human frailties. When your shadow has become your friend, then your spiritual guide will come for you, and only then will you be ready. Grandfather. How is all of this happening to me? I tried to get them to go wait down the mountain, Billy, but they insisted on seeing you. That's all right. We can talk on the way down. Look, we're worried because the kids at the school are just going to forget the whole thing and go off on one of their nonviolent love kicks again. And all that will happen is we'll get bombed again and more of our kids will get killed. Yeah, look, Billy. There's a whole group of us. Billy, we'd like you to lead us in. You know, hit them with a counterattack. We could go in at night and bomb their TV station for a change or kidnap somebody from the town. Fight back. Look, being strong is one thing, but bombing is another. Why, because it's not open? No, because it's the act of a sick coward. So what the hell are we supposed to do? Just roll over and play dead? Yeah, Billy, how much can we take? Look, if I were a kid in the barrio or the ghetto today, and I had to grow up seeing my parents every clay out of work or else lucky to get a two-hour bus ride into the city so they can make a few dollars cleaning up the white man's filth and then return only to be insulted by the landlords, the teachers and the police-- The police? They're so damn corrupt. I know they are, and I sure as hell would be tempted to go off and do things that would make the fanatic radicals look like kindergarten kids. Well then, come on, let's do it. Nothing else we can do. Does that mean you're going to lead us in to bomb them back? - Yeah, come on, Billy. - No, not in a million years. Why not, Billy? Because that kind of violence never helps anybody or liberates anybody. It just gives some psychotic who's filled with a lot of self-hatred an excuse to kill a lot of innocent bystanders and maybe grab a lot of headlines by spouting some sophomoric slogans about class struggle. And the end result of the whole thing is it gives the law and order mentalities like Posner a chance to grab even more power. As far as what's going on back at the school I think you kids are just gonna have to go back and decide all that for yourselves. What the hell is that? I don't know, sir. Sounds like drums. Lieutenant, you better put the men out on alert. Sergeant, go out and see what the noise is. Hey, colonel. Maybe your revolution is gonna come limping in here with a musket, fife and drum. Lieutenant, I don't think you're gonna believe this. Come one, come all to the world's first total man meet in history. Howard Case, where are you'? Each team has a poetry team, a belly dance team, a rock band, a sprinter, a pole vaulter and a relay team. No prizes, no awards, and no politics. Just the fun of competing. Anyone can form a team and join in. Man is both body and soul, and physical and spiritual, so come to the first total man meet in history. Hey, colonel. These radical demonstrations can be awfully dangerous. Think you and your men can handle this one? Lieutenant, escort them. Attention all units, attention all units. Be on the alert. This could be a clever diversionary tactic. All right, Carl, knock it off. It's no use, the wheel is just getting deeper and deeper. Have you got the tow truck yet? Hey, Jerry? I've already called the tow truck and they can't come out until morning. Send another bus. Oh, wait a minute. I think maybe there's help coming. Yeah, someone's on their way. Russell, that's not help. Jerry? Jerry? Something funny's going on. Call the sheriff. Well well well. If it ain't our candle waving culture group. Looks like you've got a little problem here, huh? Well, I tell you, while you're waiting for help, we'll, uh, we'll provide you with a little culture, okay? Give me one of them violins. That is a guitar, stupid. They still can't find the sheriff and Billy's on his way. Tell him to keep trying. Try the state police. Well, lookie here. Really big man, Jason, aren't you? Fellows, we can't fight and we're not interested in-- Just tell us what you want. Look, now, you've had your fun and you've really damaged our bus. Now, you don't need to burn it too. Please, don't burn our bus. Oh, my my my, huh? You boys out for a little fun and games? You just decide, it's Saturday night, roll a bus over or two, huh? Well, it's something to do. Yeah, it beats going to church, doesn't it? Well, yeah. Yeah. Oh, man. He's a big one, Jas. _ 6.9_ _ 6.9.-_ Really? How much do you weigh, about 265 pounds? - No, 285. Two hundred and eighty five pounds? - Right. - Jason, I didn't think you guys piled it that high down here in your part of the county, huh? Well, you know the funny thing about being so big though is that a little girl, like this luscious little belly dancer here, she could take you right off at the knees just like that. What's she going to use, a buzz saw? No. She wouldn't use a buzz saw. Just her knee. Her knee? She couldn't even get her knee up high enough. She doesn't have to kick you in the family jewels. What she would do is... right down there inside the thigh. Oh, I'm sure. And you know, not only that, but if she did it right, you would not only go down like a bomb, but she might even tear that muscle all the way down under the kneecap. You might even have to have surgery. Indian, you're full of karate crap, you know that? Well, I knew he was going to say that. I just knew you were going to say that. And I suppose that means that I will have to say to you that I will have to show you, right? Be my guest. And I suppose that's all right with you, isn't it, Jason? Good luck. That's one thing about you, you've always had such a generous heart, Jason. You don't mind at all that I-- - Go right ahead. - ...take him on, or-- - Sure. - Wonderful fellow, wonderful fellow. Well, you can't say that I didn't warn you. Right? - Right. - And you can't say that I didn't warn you? - No, no. - Is he a valuable man? - Ahh. - So-so. So-so? That's all you are? Well, in any event, you can't say that I didn't warn you, right? Now I suppose we're down to that time when there's really nothing left to do but show you, is there? Be my guest. Joanne, what do you think you're doing? Getting even. What do you mean getting even? This just pulls you down to their level. Well, what the hell do you call what you just did? Come on, Billy. Come on, you can debate your visions later. Law association wants to know if you want to open the legal seminar, - or speak last. - Last. After everyone else has gone home. What's the matter? Look who they said would never leave his room. Danny thinks he might like to have that thing now, wouldn't you, Danny? What thing? The thing that will help his arm grab onto things. How in the world did you ever do it? Okay, almost. But you've got to put this here, right like that. - I'll never learn. - Yeah, you will. And you'll sing up on the platform - like the rest of the kids. - I'd be so embarrassed. Will I really get to play up there? Yeah, but you've gotta work hard, okay? Ready? - Really? - Yeah, okay. I saw three ships come sailing in  Do you mean he's actually talking now? Yeah. With Carol he's become a regular chatterbox. That's beautiful. I saw three ships come sailing in  On Christmas Day on Christmas Day  Change over to here, like that. Well, Jean, I hope this is going to end your Indian Legal Rights seminar. I know, I know. Not a mark on him and death by accidental drowning. Well, what the hell did you expect? Yeah, a sign? Courtesy of W. A. Posner and his friends from the CIA? The mass confusion over really what are the Indian rights makes it impossible for even Indian lawyers to grasp the laws that are mostly aimed at depriving him of 13 million acres of prime real estate in the United States. Let us now look closely at how these committees control the entire Congress and the entire spending, so that 220 million people are totally controlled by the votes of 4 or 5 men. The traders are given a complete monopoly on the reservation by the Bureau. Prices are inflated, sometimes as much as a thousand percent. And when the little money that these people have is gone, the traders extend credit to them at interest rates usually falling between 48-75 percent annually. And the BIA parading their sell-out Indians around before the public as a camouflage, refuse to throw the traders off the reservation or to even regulate or in any way control them. Can you tell me why? The only possible reason must be kickbacks, tied in with the First National Bank and Mr. Posner's trust funds. These again regulated by the BIA. And the people that are going to be the ones that are suffering are my people. People that are on the grass roots level. Not the tribal councilmen. Not the fat tribal councilmen with their... government or tribal cars. Not them. And for years since I was a little girl I've seen this go on amongst our own people. Graft and corruption. I call you brother, but I have my hand in your pocket. She calls me sister. She has a knife in my back. We talk about unity. Unity in the world, in the government? Better start at home. Charity begins at home. And so in closing, please let us try and remember the overwhelming despair gnawing at every Indian and every other person in the United States knowing that there is no longer any way he can directly affect the destiny of his country, and therefore, he can no longer control his own life. You know, it's hard to believe that this country, which was started in a small corner of Virginia, where even though the population was very small, God created such incredible people as James Monroe, James Madison, George Washington, Patrick Henry, George Wythe, Peyton Randolph, George Mason, the unbelievable Thomas Jefferson and many, many others. The question now is whether that incredible spirit of those men which created this country is to be completely obliterated by the greed and corruption which exists at every conceivable political level from the White House to the teeniest trading post on the Indian reservation. Do you know that one word, just one word could change the entire course of the American Indian legal destiny and thereby change the destiny for all of us here? And that is the word ""honest. That one word could change this government and special interest groups back to the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. Which is of government of the people. Jefferson summed it all up in one phrase. ""The entire art of government is being honest. To those of you who make peaceful evolution impossible, it is you and only you that will make violent revolution inevitable. Thank you. A conservator is like a guardian, young lady. If you hit me, you'll be in contempt of court. I'll do it, I swear to you I'll do it, now get out. I'm taking the child. No, you're not. What the hell do you think you're doing? I haven't discharged this patient yet. We petitioned the court to name me as conservator. Normally, I am a peaceful man, Carl. But if he's not out of this room by the time I turn around I'm throwing this vile, decaying dung heap right through that window. Now you get him the hell out of here. Until the court does appoint you conservator, this is illegal, Harry, and you know it. Now come on. Let's go down the hall and talk this over. Now, don't you worry, honey. We're gonna get him back to the school. All right? Phew. They're coming to arrest Grandfather. All right, Cole, what's this warrant for? You're not going to take him in, Cole. Cole, I don't believe this. This is absurd. Absolutely absurd. Grandfather would never accept lease money. Yellow Hawk is behind this. Obviously that's a frame up, but just as obviously you can beat it. Unless someone else does something stupid. He's right. Come on, Grandfather. I'll go in with you. Hey, Blue Elk. It's me, Jas. Got a minute? What's up? Well, uh, they asked me to come out here and see if maybe you want to come in for a little private talk. Maybe we can do something about the old man. Who's they? They just, uh, told us to come out here and see if you would be interested in a deal. That's all. They just want us to come get you. You wouldn't be playing any games, would you? Now look, if they'd have wanted to hurt you, they would have done it a long time ago. Yeah. What do you think? Well, if it will help. Yeah, why not? Columbus took a chance, didn't he? There you go. And look what happened to the Indians. Just go around the other side. Hey. Hey! Well, we worked him over then we worked him over again but still no deal. - Well, where is he? - He's out back. Well now, what in the world happened to you, Blue Elk? What's the matter with you, Posner? I'm not one of your drunken Indians. Doing this to me is going to create a lot of attention. That's the general idea. In other words, Blue Elk, we're going to make an example out of you. Ladies and gentlemen, we got a special attraction here tonight. Our good friend Blue Elk is going to do an authentic Indian war dance for you. Ain't you, boy? A little music there, Maestro. Let's get out of here. Give me that stick, drummer boy. That damn Indian ain't gonna dance, Jaycee. Oh, he's gonna dance, all right. Ain't you, boy? You gonna dance, ain't you, boy? 'Cause if you don't dance, son, I'm gonna burn all the skin off the bottom of your feet. Use your head, Billy. I thought after the last time you'd see this creates problems, it doesn't solve them. What about your vision, you going to throw that away again, too? Damn it, Billy, does somebody else have to be killed before you'll learn? Look. There is a human being lying down there who also happens to be my friend. Now you tell me what do you want me to do, just leave him lie there? Oh my God. Come on, honey, this is insane. Let's get out of here. Why? It's time they got theirs. I said now. Mrs. Clure, how could you do this? Dr. Alem, you're a dentist. You took an oath. Don't you dare turn away from me. Look at him. How could you possibly enjoy this? What are you, a bunch of animals? Aw, come on. You guys aren't going to really use all of these things now, are you? Try us. If you're giving me a choice, I would just as soon quietly walk out of here and go on home. Billy, stop it. Somebody stop it. What are you, insane? All we want to do is take our friend Blue Elk and quietly walk out of here. Not this time, Billy. Oh, Posner. For God's sakes. There are witnesses. Hundreds of them. He's not walking out of here. Well, if that's the way it's going to be, buster, you're going to have to club me down first, are you ready to do that? If I have to. Damn you. Somebody get the police and hurry. Just your feet against all of this? Well, looks like we're just going to have to improvise. You know, I don't remember who it was, but somebody one time told me that if there's absolutely no way that you can get out of taking a terrible beating, the only intelligent thing for you to do is to try to get in the first lick. Get him. I dislocated it. Oh come on, it's just separated. Quit bellowing like such a baby, I'll set it for you. Bring it up. This part's going to hurt you. Oh, Posner. Look, up until now, it has been just a couple of broken bones. So why don't you put the gun away, and back off. Tell me something. Were Posners all born to be jackasses? If you miss me, you're going to hit one of your own men. Please. I'm asking you nice, if that will help. Why don't you just put the gun away let's quietly go on home. I'm arresting you for assault. You have no right to hold me here. I'm a free man. I'm arresting you too. One false move and I'll kill you. By God, I'll kill you. Han, don't. Please. I'm begging you. Don't think I'm kidding. You satisfied? I'm taking you in, Billy. No, I can't let you do that, Cole. My God, man. When are you going to stop being a fool? If I let you take me in, we both know that would be a bullet in my head. Not while I'm around. Billy, I have to do this. No, Cole. I'm not going to let you take me. It's a full-scale riot. They want the Guard and the standby federal troops. Yeah, who's screaming the loudest? You want them in alphabetical order? I heard Posner's been killed. Are you sure? Yes, sir. How? Billy Jack. Well, get him. I'm afraid we can't, sir. The whole world saw it, it was clearly self-defense. I said arrest him. Glad you got here, Colonel. You have no legal right to be here. Sorry, ma'am. We're taking our orders directly from the governor's the governor's office. This show of force is just going to fan reaction. Is that what you want? Just what are your orders? To stay in this position until Billy Jack is placed under arrest. On top of everything else, now it starts to rain. I don't know, Billy. Maybe I should have listened and cut back on some of those exposes. You know what I think? No, what? I think that your refusal to stop those exposes and give advice is kind of a cop out. Just what do you mean by that? Well, by not ever giving advice you don't ever have the awesome responsibility of someone following your advise and making a terrible mistake. Maybe getting hurt. It's kind of a nice, safe way to do it. Are you accusing me of being afraid of responsibility? In some ways, yes. Why else didn't you speak up about the exposes? I mean, after Nixon resigned, why didn't you do something about it then? Because I thought the kids were doing the right thing. Your trouble is that you think everybody is pure of heart and gives a damn. What's that supposed to mean? Well, you think that all you have to do is bring all these injustices out in the open and everybody's going to rise up and do something about it. Look what happened to Kennedy after Chappaquiddick. Or all the crooks with Nixon and Watergate. Things went right on. People forget. Come on, to hell with all that. The only important thing now is how can we get out of this mess without somebody getting hurt. I think you've got to try and slip out of here a"")! Way you can. It's funny. Last time you were the one who couldn't wait for me to surrender. It's not funny. It's totally different this time. They're going to kill you, Billy. How many kids were shot at that Kent State and all those other-- What in the hell does that have to do with anything? It has everything to do with it. If they have to force their way in here looking for me a lot of people are going to get hurt. Now look at who's the nonviolent one. No, I'm not being nonviolent. I'm just trying to buy a little bit of time. Besides, they wouldn't dare hurt me now. Carl. Don't anybody move. All right, I'll surrender peaceably if I have the governor's personal word that you'll take all these troops, move off the campus and clear out of the reservation. Those are the governor's orders. We're to pull out just as soon as you're in jail. That's the deal, Billy. You heard it personally? That's right, Billy. I was there. All right. I'll be down shortly. Look. I came up here so fast I forgot to bring bullets. Come on. They wouldn't dare do something to me now, it'd be much too obvious. I'm sorry, Carl, but this warrant is from the state's Attorney General. He's under state custody. The hell he is. - I'll take him in. - No, you won't. The Attorney General received orders directly from the state supreme court and gave them personally to me. I'm sorry, Carl. Then I'll follow along and make sure nothing happens. He's yours, Stanley. Move that truck. Are you going to move that truck or am I? Now move it. Sergeant, do you think we have someone who can do something about this? What the hell is that? Just a precaution, ma'am. What do you mean precaution, I thought the deal was when Billy surrendered the governor would take all you Gestapo out of here. Don't bite at me, lady. I'm just an order taker. All right. Go ahead and take your leak. I never said I had to take a leak. Regulations. Pick it up. It may be dangerous out there in the dark. Now, that's the funniest thing. You know, one time, I don't remember where, somebody told me that if at any time I was ever arrested and they gave me a handgun and said something about taking a leak-- Oh! My God, man. Do you realize what they will do to us? Shut up and fan out. I'm not going out in the dark after him. Are you nuts? To hell with you. I know I hit him. Fan out. Move it. One sound and I tear out the windpipe. Now get your handgun out and bring it up to me very easy. All right. Now, I want the keys to these cuffs and the coil wire from this car and the microphone. You understand? Real slow. Well, did you see anything? No, sir. Not a damn sign of him. Yes, there is. This looks like blood. Turn on the headlights, Ed. Swing it over here. I was wrong when I said to turn the other cheek. Brute power can only be met by brute power. We've got to fight back. Better than that, we can bomb the dam. Shut up. We'll get that coverage on CBS. We don't want to hear some speech. Shut up! Shut up! Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Now, Jean, built this school without any help from us and she does not need any help from us to rip it down. She can do just fine on her own if that's what she wants. I think she has a right to, you know, voice an opinion on what she wants. Stop that. As long as this is the end of our dream, and the end of our school, I think we should let Jean talk. Stop. All of you. Damn it, I'm mad. And you, Jocelyn, I don't care if you want a speech or not, you're going to hear one, baby. I've never asked for one thing from one of you in this school in my life and damn it I'm going to ask now. I've decided this minute after sitting here and watching you guys, I'm going to stop giving. And I'm going to demand that you give me five minutes of your lousy time, and believe me, right now it's plenty lousy. I can tell you, I can promise you, if the cop came into this room that shot Billy Jack, I'd shoot him. I'd shoot him. I know that. But God help me he's not here now so I don't have to and I can think a little bit. Now, we could go out there. Some of us would get shot. A few of you would get killed. You, maybe, Jocelyn. You can die now if you want to. Go ahead. What's a life? It's easy, you can make them like that, right? Dying is a big step, and if we wanted to, and if we really want to die and if we really want to ruin this school and totally destroy it, I think we can do it just as easily tomorrow as we can tonight. And it may give us a chance to find out why we're doing this. Why, what's this happening for? My feeling is, and I know right now it doesn't mean a damn thing to any of you but I'm going to say it anyway, I feel that right now this is our crucial test. Oh, we're all big mouths. We've got great mouths in telling about this great love we have here. And what it means. And boy this whole school is really built on it, isn't it? I saw it tonight. It was beautiful. Just gorgeous. But the question is can this great love withstand what they are doing to us out there right now? Or is that brute violence the thing that's going to overcome the world? Now, you all know Danny, and you know the tremendous love and time Carol has put in to what everyone told us was an absolutely hopeless case. She has been working for over one month to try and teach him a song because he's wanted to come up here on this stage like you big guys, you big shots, and sing. Well, there may not be a platform here tomorrow, there may not be a school here tomorrow. You may not be here tomorrow. You may not be here tomorrow, because you may decide to go out and get yourselves shot. So I'm going to ask you one small favor. Can you give Danny his chance to be a big guy? And I hope to God he doesn't turn out like some of you. So Carol, Danny, would you please come up now and please, let him have his chance. Ready? Want to start us off? I saw three ships come sailing in  On Christmas Day on Christmas Day  I saw three ships come sailing in  On Christmas Day in the morning  J"" And all the angels in heaven shall sing  On Christmas Day on Christmas Day  J"" And all the angels in heaven shall sing  On Christmas Day in the morning  And all the souls on earth shall sing  On Christmas Day on Christmas Day  And all the souls on earth shall sing  On Christmas Day in the morning N' We did it. All the way through it. Good. Thank you. I'm well aware of that, but ask for them anyway. I don't give a damn, we need some help. All right. Well, they won't pull out. We're trying to ask for federal marshals. Has anybody gotten through to the governor yet? Oh, Jean, I've been trying to get him all afternoon. No, he doesn't have time for a phone call. But look at him. He's acting like the archangel Gabriel. So I pledge to you that while we will never provoke any confrontation-- - Damn you liar. - ...we will never surrender one square foot of this state to any lawless anarchists. Wherever the first firebomb is thrown, wherever the first brick is thrown, wherever the first house is set on fire, then we will make our move. I have been in contact with Washington and have been promised full support. Well, so much for any hope of getting the federal marshals. And to every citizen in this state, let me be perfectly clear. We will move with everything in our power to protect all life-- Oh, no. Would you believe it? Look at that. This has been a remote telecast direct from the governor's office at the state capital. God above. How can they be so stupid? No, it's not stupid. It's a well thought-out plan. Oh, I almost forgot. Call Joe, tell him I won't be in to work k for three or four more days. Please, please be careful. Don't worry, for God's sakes. Why is Mommy so upset? Well, she's just being silly, Danny. Now give your old dad a hug. It's gotta last me a couple days. The governor's office wants verification that radicals are pouring into the school from all over the state. - Verified. - Verified. All right. Now, it's your job to cover the hill. Any kid comes up from the school you warn him once. You fire a warning shot in the air and then you shoot to kill. Now, they've got snipers all over the place out there. Is that clear? Do you understand that? Does he really expect us to shoot college kids? You're damned right. Their snipers will hit you without batting an eye. Pardon me for sounding stupid, but, uh, what are we shooting them for? The medicine failed. Those bullets are killing you. Grandfather said it's because you didn't respect your vision. You acted the same way after as you did before. Grandfather is right. But we still have to stop them, because they're going to try to kill Jean. Will any of you help me? Please. I can't do it alone. Ah! Let's burn their supply shack. Have any of you guys seen Danny? Please, have any of you seen Danny? - No. - Yeah, I think I saw him running back towards the girls' dorm. Thank you Has Danny been through here? - You mean little Danny? - Yes. Yeah, well, I think I saw him go down to the bonfire. Carol, you can't go down there. I have to. I have to find Danny. Carol, please. Now they've set a shack on fire. You better send a fire truck and more men to push them back. Right. Over. Form your lines. Form your lines, gentlemen. This is Jean Roberts at the Freedom School. I have urgent information that can stop all this. Tell the governor he's got to get on the phone now. Wasn't that a sniper? Sure looks like it. Well, why didn't you fire back? I'm not doing anything until I get my orders. Why don't you just go call an ambulance. Governor? Yes. Any kind of statement from you will calm things down considerably. Would you please let me go out and tell them anything? Anything direct from you? If the students draw back, and seal themselves in the dormitory, then I'll pull back the militia. If not, we'll stop this at all costs. Well, you pull back your militia and I'll get the kids inside. God above, at least give me that chance. - Have you seen Danny? - No, I've been with Joanne. Try the playground, I'll try the barn. He's probably down with his burro. General, there is a sniper. Lieutenant Stowe, take your squad around the hill to the other side of that wall and see if you can find that sniper. Yes, sir. What kind of buck shot are you using? Double ought. That's equivalent to a .38 caliber, sir. I know what it's equivalent to but if it will kill a deer, it will kill those bastards. Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Hendrick, fire a warning shot. What the hell was that? The sniper, he's firing at us. God, they're really shooting at us. This is Sergeant Tibbs at the north wall. Being fired on by a sniper. One man's been hit. Over. They're firing on all sides, sir. Damn it to hell, return fire. All state troopers. Fire at will. Danny? Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! Carol. What the hell are you waiting for? Come on, move it. Not in the damn air, mister. Down into the crowd. Now. Carol? Danny? Danny? Please someone help me! Please help! What the hell? Colonel, what's going on down there? Help me! Under authority of the Treaty of 1868, I am arresting you for being illegally on Indian land. If you resist, or if you want to continue this senseless slaughter of these unarmed students who are here under our protection, then you'll have to shoot your way through us. This is a monumental step you're taking. You give us no other choice. If this country must have another civil war, then let it start here. What the hell is he doing? All right. I'll notify the governor. Somebody help us, please. No, we're pulling out. You should have been here tonight, old buddy. We got a couple of them. It's funny. I thought the Freedom School was a symbol of everything good and right in the American spirit. We had kids of different races, ideologies, religions, all living and working together in peace and harmony. For all the kids at the school, we really want you back. Aren't you going to open it again? It's not the kids. It's the townspeople. They not only supported the shooting, but if you can believe it, they were actually happy about it. What do they think? Will he come back or is he dead yet? No, not yet. Some of the old men say that he's lost the will to live. Go see if you can find Jean and get her up here. You have not learned enough to come over to this side permanently. Why? My spirit progresses so poorly on the other side. That's because you don't value your visions. You must carefully listen to them and change your life according to what they say. I understand that. But why can't I do that here? You must go back, for when people can see how someone as violent as you can change and find inner peace, then you will set a good example. After you have gone back and practiced the fourth way, then you will meet your spiritual guide. Well, how am I supposed to do that? I don't even know what the fourth way is. My friend will tell you. But you will not be able to reach the fourth way until you stop covering your weaknesses with violent acts. The fourth and highest level is when, no matter what they do to your body they cannot touch your soul, because you are so deeply into your own center. Then you see violence and anger and bullying not as threats, but as cover-ups used by panicked men who are frightened and in pain. Instead of hating them you truly feel sorry for their weakness, and can easily turn and offer them your other cheek. Now go back and do what you must do. And take Carol, for she will help you carry on the teachings. How are all the kids? I don't know. I haven't been back there yet. What do you mean you haven't been back there? You mean you, you haven't been back to the school? Why not? Don't they need your help getting the whole thing started again? You mean you really want to go through all that again? Are you telling me you're quitting? Look over there. Well, that's a strong sign. That doesn't change your mind at all? Tomorrow, all over the world kids are going to march to rebuild the school. We're going to try to start other schools, all over, just like you've done for us here. Instead of stopping the exposes, we've got to work harder now than ever. With Ford and Rockefeller, nothing will really change. Everyone suddenly forgot about all the urgent reforms so we've got to keep on fighting until those reforms really happen. We've all decided. Everybody. We're going to dedicate the march to you. Please come in.    Golden lady made of love  You gave so much to me  When I  Had nothing I want to give you something too  Something of that from which   I am made  As your love came from you  Golden lady full of hope  You showed me that IAs well when I  Had nothing I want to give you something too  Something of the dreams only I can see   As hope was seen by you  You are my sister  You gave me friendship  You are my mother  I am reborn  You are my teacher  You taught me everything, President Truman will be here tomorrow, so you folks in Dallas turn out. This is Cowboy Rhythms on KTRN, Wichita Falls. Here's Hank Williams' hit tune, ""Cold, Cold Heart."" You ain't ever gonna amount to nothing. Already spent a dime this morning, ain't even had breakfast. Give me the chalk. Why don't you comb your hair, Sonny? It sticks up. I'm surprised you had the nerve to show up... ...after that stomping you took last night. What'd you say? Could've been worse. Yeah. You can say that about everything. A few teams have had some luck with tackling. Keeps the other team from scoring so often. Sounds too rough for me. You don't care if it was your last game. You'll never get stomped for your high school ball team again. - Where's your school spirit? - Don't know. You working today? The truck's being greased. See, this is what I get for betting on my own hometown ball team. I ought to have better sense. Wouldn't hurt if you had a better hometown. Mind pointing that at the floor till I get by? I don't want my eye poked out. Don't let Billy get too far away. You're damn more dangerous in a pool hall than on a football field. You ever heard of tackling? Hey, Duane! Boy, I froze my ass last night! Why can't you kids learn to tackle? How about taking Genevieve some change, as you're going that way? Toss me one! Look, Larry, they can catch. Feisty sons of bitches. Wish they could tackle. Or do something useful. Team wasn't worth a kiss-my-ass this year. Fade out, Crawford. One more time. All right, you boys. Cut it out. I got enough problems without you playing that game. We could've run off to Mexico with this, you know. - Play the new one we heard. - Which one? Down payment on breakfast. Let someone rich play the jukebox. Nobody rich would eat here. - I ain't very hungry. - Well, I am. You want the pickup first? I oughtn't always get it first. It's half yours. - Go ahead. - You sure? Yes. Anyways, I got lots of deliveries to make. And I have to go clear to Ranger. I'll be lucky to get back for the second show. My goodness, Sonny. Frank oughtn't work you so late on weekends. That's what I tell him. You ain't got in in time to see the comedy in three weeks. Hope you don't want popcorn. There ain't none. And you missed the newsreel too. The main show's done started, so I'll just charge you 30 cents. Thanks, Miss Mosey. I was wondering if my daughter had deserted us, when I heard her voice. Kay was our only daughter. A father's not supposed to have favourites, but when it's Kay... - You smell good. - You like it? - What's that? - An atomizer. What'd you get? A present? Who from? Somebody. I decided you had a wreck. What's happened? You look different. - I do? - Yeah. You look all lit up inside. You're not wearing your usual deadpan look. That ""How'd I get into this family?"" look. Father. You've been taking the vitamins Dr. Gray sent you. That's right. I guess I'll get me some of those vitamins. I'll get it, Delilah. What's wrong? She looks kind of queer. Guess what? What? It's our anniversary. What? We've been going steady a year tonight. Yeah? Seems like a lot longer. You should've got me some anniversary present. You can have another stick of gum. That's all I got. You can give me the dollar it cost me and Marlene for the show. What are y'all doing back here in the dark? He's coming for me soon. I'll get your coffee. Where'd the boys go? Ben had some date. Tommy's at basketball practice. - Bring the coffee, please. - Yes, Miss Banks. I don't see why they should get the pickup first all the time. All they ever want to do is neck anyway. Buckley says it's not too young for a man to marry. I didn't marry your mother till I was 25. - Need some help, Jessie? - Yeah, sure do. - So long, Sam. - Bye. - Sure did like the picture. - Well, good. Crack your window. Leave the motor on. It's just too cold in here. Your hands are like ice. Put on my gloves. What's the matter with you? You act plain bored. Quit. Quit. You said this was our anniversary. Let's do something different. Well, I like that. You cheapskate. Didn't get me a present, and now you want to get me pregnant. My God, Charlene! It was just my hand. One thing leads to another. My mama told me how that old stuff goes. We'll have plenty of time for that when we get married. You wasn't no livelier than me. Because you ain't good-looking enough. You ain't even got a ducktail. Well, anyway, I'm done late. Let's go on home. Some anniversary. If that's the way you feel about it, I'd just as soon break up. I don't want to spoil no more anniversaries for you. That's the way nice girls get treated. I might've known you wasn't dependable. You wasn't even in the backfield. This jacket's got a hole, but don't ask me to sew it for you. Give me back my pictures too. I don't want you showing them and telling how hot I am. You wasn't very hot. I hope you ain't down about Charlene. - I ain't blue about her. - What are you blue about then? Ain't nobody to go with in this town. Jacy's the only pretty girl in school, and Duane's got her. I'd call that his tough luck. You don't have to eat so fast. You ain't in a race. Jacy'd bring you more misery than she'll ever be worth. Did your dad give you this? He needs all he's got. Wouldn't hurt you to take something from him once in a while. I don't know. You and Duane both in a boarding house. Him with the mother and you with the father. Don't seem right. And your dad's taking too many pills, you know. But I'm no one to talk. I never got on with Mama. I still don't. I hear Dan's going back to work soon. I guess you'll be quitting before long. We got $4000 worth of doctor bills to pay. I will probably be making cheeseburgers for your grandkids. What are my chances this morning of interesting you kids in John Keats? None at all. Joe Bob? I read that poem of his about the nightingale. I didn't think it was so good. Sounded like he wanted to be a nightingale. I don't think he wanted to be a nightingale, Joe Bob. Maybe he just wanted to be immortal. All you have to do to be immortal is lead a good Christian life. Anyone can do it if they love the Lord. Well, maybe so, Joe Bob. Maybe so. Here now, let me read you this: When old age shall this generation waste Thou shalt remain in midst of other woe ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,""... that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. Run, you little pissants, run! Tough it out! You gotta be men like the rest of us. None of you pretty enough to be women. Here, Joe Bob. Quit flapping your arms. You look like a damn goose. Even a preacher's boy ought to be in shape. What kind of female will you ever get? Tough it out! Run, you little pissants. All right, off the court. If y'all didn't jack off so much, maybe you could stay in shape. Come here a minute, Sonny. You do me a favour, and I'll do you one. Sure, coach. My old lady's got to go to the doctor tomorrow. You know women. Always something wrong. I guess. Take it from me. Anyway, I don't have time to drive her. Now, if you'll do this for me, I'll get you out of civics class. I'll be glad to. The best offer I've had all day. Tell her you got to get back for practice so she won't stay too long. I've got enough bills to pay already. "" Know what the trouble is with you? You ain't got no school spirit."" You need a haircut. Come on, Jimmie Sue. We're hungry over here too. I'm coming. Hold your horses! Better watch it. Here comes your mama. We're having supper at home tonight. I expect you there in 15 minutes, you hear? Okay, Mama. I was just giving the boys a ride. Here's a tune that's been on the hit list for some weeks. Tell us the name. What is it? What is it, huh? - ""Shrimp Boats."" - You got it! Very good, Thomas. You were in on that too. There's $120. We're going along fine. Now we come to City Limits. This is... Guess you hate me tonight. I love you, but I love Duane too. Even if you don't like it. I don't care. I'd just hate to see you marry him. You wouldn't be rich anymore. I don't care about money. You're pretty stupid then. You married Daddy when he was poor, and he got rich, didn't he? Scared your daddy into getting rich, beautiful. If Daddy could do it, Duane could too. Not married to you. You're not scary enough. You're rich and miserable. I don't want to be like you. Not much danger of that. - You slept with him? - Mama! Go to the doctor and arrange something... ...so you don't have to worry about babies. You must be careful. But it's a sin unless you're married. You know I wouldn't do that. Don't be so mealy-mouthed! I thought if you slept with him... ...you might find there isn't anything magic about him. Then we can send you to a good school... I don't want to leave. Why can't I stay and go to college in Wichita Falls? Because. Everything is flat and empty here. And nothing to do! Can I have some of that? Help yourself. Don't you have any? Yeah, but I feel like smelling good right now. Don't you ever feel like doing anything right now? Leave your face just like that. All you need is a little eyebrow pencil. Okay. Good night. Just remember, beautiful, everything gets old if you do it often enough. So if you want to find out about monotony real quick, marry Duane. Number one hit in the country, right here on KTRN... ... your mutual station in Wichita Falls. Our old friend Hank Williams wrote that. You're with us on Strike it Rich. I'd like to remind you that we're on television every day. Also, every morning, we're on radio on another network. Check your paper for times. Strike it Rich Box 500, Grand Central Annex... Hello. - Abilene, you asleep? - No. Feel like company? I thought I'd drive out, see how my well is coming. Drill hard. You're better at oil wells anyway. Hello, Sonny. What you want? Coach said you need a driver. Didn't he tell you? No, he didn't mention it. I thought he'd drive me himself. I guess he just couldn't get off. Let me just get the radio. Is it something bad? No. It's something... ...very... Thank you. Here's the keys. I guess I'd better be getting back to school. It was nice of you to drive me. Well, it beats sitting through civics, ma'am. Wouldn't you like to come in and have a soda? If you can stand me for a few more minutes. I hate these northers. Would you prefer milk? Sit at the table. Or you can go now if you want. I was just scared to be alone. I'm sorry I made you come in. I'll take a Dr Pepper. You'll never forgive me, I know. Go on. You don't have to stay any longer. Thank you for the Dr Pepper. I guess you'll be glad when basketball season's over. Why? Coach probably don't get to stay home much... ...during football and basketball season. My God, you don't know a thing about it, do you? You better go on to basketball practice. Thanks for the Dr Pepper. - Hi, Jacy. - Oh, hi. Duane coming? - You know Bobby Sheen at Wichita Falls? - I met him at the country club. He's having this midnight swimming party tonight. - You want to run over there with me? - I can't. You hear about the last one? His folks were gone to Miami, and everybody swam naked. His folks are gone again, so it'll be pretty wild. Sure wish you could come. Bobby has great parties. A lot of kids from the club gonna be there. Gee, Lester, I'd like to go. I'll have a big problem with Duane, though. Well, don't go off without me. Maybe I can. Hi, Duane. What did Lester want? Oh, Lester. He's such a bore. - Hey, Abilene. - What do you say, buddy? Hey there. Merry Christmas. This is Jackie Lee French. This is Lois Farrow, my boss's wife. What do you mean, kissing her like that? - I ought to slap your face. - Well, why don't you just kiss my ass? I never come to referee no fight. Well, good then. Come dance with me. Get yourself a drink, honey. I'll be back. Hi, Ruth. Wait for me outside. - A thousand barrels of oil a day. It's too hot in here. Let's go outside. I don't want drunks tromping on my feet. I have something for you anyway. - Hey, Sonny. - Hey. Hi. Hi, Sonny. Hi, Dad. How you doing? Okay. That's good. See you. Sure. You mean my Christmas present. I haven't had time to get you anything yet. I had no time to shop. Hope you like it. I saved for six months. Oh, it's just beautiful. It's just what I've been wanting. You're so sweet, spending all that money on me. You're so sexy, Duane. I wish I didn't have to leave you tonight. Well, you don't. I do too. I could just kill my mother. She made me promise to go to a swim party in Wichita with Lester Marlow. - His folks are rich. Don't be mad. - I ain't mad, but goddamn it! It's all Lester's fault. He keeps asking Mama. - I want to stay with the man I love. - Goddamn... No, Duane! I gotta go. I gotta go. Why you asking my girl out? - Turn me loose! - When you're ready to fight. Let's have it out! Here, knock off that shit, boys. This is the Christmas season. Run along, Wichita. I can't stand here all night protecting your shoeshine. I don't know what to do about him. He's so crazy about me. Nothing against Duane, but that's a roughneck for you. They aren't sophisticated about these things. Well, merry Christmas. Come in and let's have some punch, boys. Hi, Sonny. Oh, hi. Want to help me? Okay. You're not dancing. Don't you have a girlfriend? I did. We broke up a couple of months ago. Oh? Why? Mind my asking? I was going with Charlene Duggs. She thought I got fresh with her. I never did, really. We broke up because we didn't like each other much to begin with. I hope you're not sad about it. I don't think Charlene's near nice enough for you. I didn't see you dancing. No, I don't dance much. Will you drive me to the clinic again next week? Oh, you bet. We better not dawdle here. Bobby. Hey, look! New victims! Hi, Jacy. Glad you made it. We're dressed informally, as you can see. You know Annie-Annie. You want to join the club? Sure. You gotta get undressed out there on the diving board. So everybody gets to watch. - We all did the first time. - That's the rule. Yeah, I did it last Easter. Okay? Okay. Everybody out for the strip show! Look out. Don't pay attention to Sandy. He's my brother. If he gooses you, I'll make him go to bed. Goodness. I hope I don't fall off this thing. Sandy can fish you out if you do. Duane, been looking for you. Where's Jacy? Don't remind him. We just got him quiet. Want a drink? - Where'd you get it? - In a guy's car. - He weren't looking. - Let's do something. Why don't we hunt up some pussy? You wouldn't know what to do with it if we found some. What happened? Lester took his girl to a swimming party. Let's all go out and get a fuck. I know where's a heifer. It belongs to my Uncle Hank. Why the hell not? - A heifer beats nothing. - Pussy's pussy. I don't want no heifer. - We ought to buy Billy a piece of ass. - We oughtn't let him die a virgin. Mama says idiot kids don't live long. He ain't no idiot. He just don't talk. Bet he's still a virgin. Hey, we ought to fix him up with Jimmie Sue. - It'd make no difference to Billy. - We shouldn't try anything like that. Why not? It wouldn't cost us more than $1.50. If that's all, we should get her ourselves. Shit! A heifer's better than Jimmie Sue. Get the stupid thing in here. I ain't got all night. Come on, let's get those pants off, boys. - You won't be a virgin much longer. - We're gonna get you laid. Grab on now. Come on, do your job. Get her, Billy-boy! This is the dumbest thing! He don't even know what to do! It worked for me. Put it to her, boy! - Get her, Billy. - Come on, screw it to her, boy. Stop that yelling out there. It ain't even in! Goddamn... Goddamn, you stupid little thing! Couldn't even wait. Look at this mess! You okay, Billy? You all right? Well, now I know. Idiots as bad as Mexicans. Don't bother me no more for that crazy thing. Wouldn't mess with him again for less than three and a half. Which one of you bloodied his nose? I told you not to fight with Billy. He don't understand about fighting. What happened? - It weren't none of us, Sam. - No, it was Jimmie Sue. Jimmie Sue? How'd he get messed up with her? We bought him a piece of ass. Thought he was tired of being a virgin. She got mad about something and bloodied his nose. You boys get on out of here. I don't want to have no more to do with you. Scaring a poor, unfortunate creature like Billy... ...just so you could have a few laughs. I've been around that trashy behaviour all my life. I'm getting tired of putting up with it. You can stay out of this pool hall, my caf... ...and my picture show too. I don't want no more of your business. We didn't mean for anything bad to happen, Sam. We... You didn't even have the decency to wash his face. We're his best customers. He can't run us off. Can he? Lucky I fell asleep. I'd hate not being able to shoot no pool. You sure he won't come? You know he won't. He's starting basketball practice. It's all right. I'm sorry I cried. Just scared, I guess. He ain't gonna come. They're probably running plays right now. No, not scared of that. Scared I could never do this, I guess. Can't seem to do anything without crying about it. How could you like me? I like you. I'm glad. Come on in. I ain't gonna throw bottles at you. What've you been doing? You lost weight. Ain't had any of your cheeseburgers in weeks. Come on. I'll fix you one. Even though that wasn't a nice thing y'all done to Billy. You can't blame Sam. - Was that your idea? - No. - Duane's? - Huh? He was there, wasn't he? He didn't have the decency to own up to it. Don't worry, I won't tell on him. I should, though. Sure smells good. One thing I know for sure. You can't sneeze here without somebody offering a handkerchief. - What you mean? - Nothing. It's an awful small town for any kind of carrying on. Don't forget to put onions on. And some people got a lot of guns. All right, you don't need my advice anyway. Why don't you go play a record? These'll be done in a minute. Just come in to say hello to Genevieve. Sonny. Food's getting cold. What you grinning about? Chicken-fry me a steak. Try to use meat this time. I heard about the ball game last night. 121 to 14. Must be pretty near a record. Sam. I'm sorry. I reckon y'all need glasses. Now, hold still. Want some more cookies? - More milk? - I'm full. How come you've stayed with the coach? You don't like him much. I wasn't brought up to leave a husband. I guess that's why. Maybe I was just scared to. I never noticed how ugly this room is. What's your favourite colour? I don't know. Blue. - Maybe I'll repaper it. - Why'd you marry him? I don't know. My mother didn't like him. Maybe that was it. Well, I was 20 years old. I thought hairy-chested football coaches were about it. I'm gonna buy us a new quilt. A blue one. What you think he'd do if he found us? Shoot us, probably. He's always glad to have an excuse to use his deer rifle. I thought you boys wanted to fish. Keep an eye on them corks, Billy. I don't think there's anything here except turtles. That's what I like about it, tell you the truth. - Want to try one? - Sure. I never liked to clean fish or eat them either. You spend half your time picking out bone. I just come out here to get a little scenery. Too pretty a day to spend in town. You wouldn't believe how this country's changed. First time I seen it, there wasn't a mesquite tree on it. Or a prickly pear neither. I used to own this land, you know. First time I watered a horse at this tank... ...was more than 40 years ago. I reckon the reason I drag you out here is... ...l'm as sentimental as the next fellow when it comes to old times. Old times. I brought a young lady swimming out here once... ...more than 20 years ago. It was after my wife had lost her mind. And my boys was dead. Me and this young lady was pretty wild, I guess. In pretty deep. We used to come here on horseback and swim without no bathing suits. One day she wanted to swim the horses across this tank. Kind of a crazy thing to do, but we done it anyway. She bet me a silver dollar she could beat me across. She did. This old horse I was riding didn't want to take the water. But she was always looking for something to do like that. Something wild. I bet she's still got that silver dollar. Whatever happened to her? She growed up. She was just a girl then, really. Let me help you with that. Why didn't you ever marry her after your wife died? She was already married. Her and her husband was young and miserable with one another... ...like so many young married folks are. I thought they'd change with some age... ...but it didn't turn out that way. - Is being married always so miserable? - Not really. About 80 percent of the time, I guess. We ought to go to a real fishing tank next year. It don't do to think about things like that too much. If she was here, I'd probably be just as crazy now... ...as I was then in about five minutes. Ain't that ridiculous? No, it ain't really. Being crazy about a woman like her is always the right thing to do. Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous. Getting old. I'm glad I wasn't on fire. I'd have burned to death before you got one button undone. I'm going to get a drink of water. I wondered where you went. Annie-Annie asleep? Yeah. Nice. You a virgin? Guess I am. Too bad. - I don't want to be, though. - I don't blame you. Come see me when you're not. Why don't we just go someplace? I'm sick and tired of this town. - You're my only friend. - Go and stay gone? Except Jacy. No, I don't know. Hey, we go to Mexico. Be back sometime Monday. - Would the pickup make it? - Yeah. How much money you got? Thirty bucks, about. Well, I got 40. We can make it on that. Come on! You guys want... - Where you going? - Mexico. Where? Better come with us, Sam. We're headed for the valley. - Where did you say? - Mexico. - It's about the wildest. - All the way down. You going all the way to Mexico tonight in this old heap of junk? My God! Reckon the town will get along without us till Monday? I reckon. If I was young enough, I'd go with you. - Need any money? - No, we got plenty. Well, you'd better take some for some insurance. Take money below that border, it sort of melts sometimes. Thanks, Sam. Try not to drink too much of that buggy water. We'll just drink beer and tequila. You catch the clap, you'll wish you hadn't drunk nothing. Oh, well. We'll see you. - Thank you. - So long. Hey, wake up! We're back. My stomach don't feel so good. Got any more Tums? You ate them all before we got to San Antonio. Genevieve will have something. My stomach don't feel so good. Closed. Closed? I ain't never seen her closed before. No, not even for Christmas. Maybe Sam will have something. I'm sick. Well, it ain't that early. Must be some kind of holiday. Sam don't close on holidays. Maybe he had to go someplace. Let's go ask Andy. - Somebody will steal the town. - Where is everybody? - Asleep. Everybody that's got sense. - Why'd Sam close the caf? Oh, yeah. Y'all been gone, ain't you? Gone to Mexico. - You don't know about it. - What? Sam died yesterday morning. Died? Yep. Quite a blow. Keeled over one of the snooker tables, had a stroke. Sam the Lion? Yep. Sam's dead. He was quite a fellow. He had his own way of doing things, that's for sure. They found his will. Craziest thing you ever heard. He left you the pool hall, Sonny. What do you think about that? He left Genevieve the caf. That's the only thing he done that made any sense. Left the picture show to old Miss Mosey. Hell, she's too far gone to even run a popcorn machine. And the craziest thing of all... ...he left $1000 to Joe Bob Blanton, the preacher's boy. Beats all I ever heard of. He could just as easily left that to me. I deserve it at least as much as that ignorant little bastard. Anyhow, it's done. They're burying him tomorrow. Come in. - I love you. - I love you too. Oh, Duane, hurry. What's wrong, honey? I don't know. That tickles. I can't stand to be tickled. What's the matter? Aren't you gonna do it? I don't know what's wrong. How could anything be wrong? Just go on and do it. What's the matter with you? I don't know, something's happened. Get off a minute! You might fall and mash me. I don't know what happened. It was Mexico. No telling what you got down there. I hate you! I don't know why I dated you. I don't know what happened. Put your clothes on. You think I want to look at you naked? I knew you couldn't do it. I'll always be a virgin! What do we say? The whole class knows. I want to cry. You're the meanest boy ever. My mother was dead-right about you. I don't know what happened. Don't go out there! We haven't had time to do it. I don't want anyone to know. You better not tell. You just pretend it was wonderful! I'm sorry, I don't know what happened. If you say that again, I'll bite you! Tell us about it. What was it like? I just can't describe it. I just can't describe it in words. I can do it now. I know I can. Quit prissing! I don't think you did it right anyway. Come on. It's your graduation present. Hope you like it. I never seen one as nice. - Hello? - Jacy? What's on your feeble mind? Same as been. I want a date. Why don't you just go back to Mexico? I guess girls are easier to please there. Just go with me one more time. You can at least see me. Pester someone else. I got a new boyfriend. - I can't be talking to you. - Who? Bobby Sheen, of course. - You crazy? - I certainly am not. I guess I wanted to go with him all along and never realized it. Maybe we'll see you in Wichita sometime. Goddamn it! Goddamn it to hell! I hate to see you go. I don't got a goddamn thing to stay for. Roughnecks say you can get a job in Odessa anytime. Come on back if you don't. You hear they busted up, let me know. Why don't we watch the movie? Hi, I didn't hear you. Gene home? No, he and Mama went to the club. What are you doing home on a Saturday night? Bobby Sheen ran off and got married. Annie-Annie Martin. Want me to turn the TV off? No, I'm gonna go play pool. Tell your dad the well came in okay. I wish I could go to the pool hall. I've always wanted to. It's terrible, the things girls aren't allowed to do. Well, hell, come on. I'll show you the pool hall. Aren't people there? If there are, they'll be in back asleep now. Won't bother us. I got my own key. Okay, I will then. Goodness, it sure is dark in here. What a night. I never thought something like this would happen. How about hopping out? He's just awful! Why do you fool with him? - Daddy's nicer than him, isn't he? - He sure is. Your daddy's a very nice man. I ought to give Abilene hell instead of him. Bobby was the last one. I'm just gonna be an old maid. That's just the way it goes. You win a few, you lose a few. What do you do? Nothing's ever the way it's supposed to be. You're right. Come on. I want to tell you something. What I've done hasn't worked out well. I think maybe we better think of something else for you. I guess Ruth Popper's got about as good a setup as anyone. Why, sure. Sonny's reasonably good-looking and he's young. Don't you know? It's been going on about six months. - I thought you kids knew everything. - That's silly! She's 40 years old. So am I, honey. It's kind of an itchy age. Want an orange? I don't believe it. Sonny's always wanted to go with me. Pretty easy shot, sheriff. Sheriff, we got trouble. Goddamn you, Monroe! You made me scratch. Sorry, sheriff, but Johnny Clarg's little girl's been kidnapped. The preacher's boy put her in his car two hours ago. What the hell? Maybe Joe Bob just give her a ride home. Be doing her a favour in this hot weather. Who'd want to kidnap Molly Clarg? I just know she's not home. They was seen headed toward Olney. Mrs. Clarg's afraid that Joe Bob might be... Gonna molest her or something. You and these boys come with us. If that's the way it is, no telling what we'll find. Molly! Get him! Ain't you going to? Here's my little girl. He's the one that done it. Why don't you get him? If my husband was here, he'd kill him dead. What'd you do to that child? We know you done something. Come on. Filthy! Here now, grab her. None of this goddamn frenzy. It's the Lord's justice, son. You'll suffer with the murderer and the thief. Sonny, drive that Plymouth to town. We gotta get this man to jail. - Doctor said he did nothing. - Never had the guts. - Preacher's boy. - Sheriff figured he done something. Isn't it terrible, Sonny? Did you see anything? Nothing to see except Mrs. Clarg. If she had a gun, she might've killed us all. Joe Bob didn't do nothing. He must've done something. It scares me to death. You never can tell when something terrible is gonna happen. It's okay. They got him now. I called you before. You did? I felt lonesome. Thought you might want to drive around. Well, I'm supposed to be someplace. I'm still a little scared. Please take me riding. Where will we drive? Ever hear from Duane? Got a postcard. I really feel sad about that. He makes 320 a month. Said he bought a car. I'll always be a little in love with Duane. We had too much against us. It wasn't easy being the one to break up. - Sonny? - What? Not here. I'm too old for screwing in cars. I don't like to hurry. Why don't we go to Wichita and get a motel room? I'm afraid to. My folks are watching me. They know I don't want to go to college. They might think we'll run off and get married. We'll do it when it's safe. We got all summer. - Hey, Duane. - Hey, buddy! You turned roughneck. Had to so I could keep the pool hall open. - When did you get in? - About 2:00. I thought I'd surprise you. Is this yours? How about that? 38,000 miles and she runs like new. - Do you want a beer? - Not me. That's all I eat for breakfast anymore. Hey, sure is a nice car. I like to drive it so much, I thought I'd drop home for the weekend. You can't take too good care of a car like this. I wash her every week. It looks great. Hear about Joe Bob? I always knew he was crazy. He didn't do nothing, except get her to take her underpants off. He's out of jail now. You still screwing that old lady? No. Yeah. I've been kind of busy. I seen old Leroy last week. He thought you and Jacy been going together. Yeah, we have, a little. She's been bored, so sometimes we go eat Mexican food. I hear that ain't all you been eating. Whoever told you that don't know what he's talking about. I been going with her. Why not? I never said I blamed you for it. I don't much. I never thought you'd do that. We was friends. We are. What you so mad for? I never done nothing to you. - Screwing my girl ain't nothing? - I ain't. - Hell, you ain't! - Well, I ain't. - She's not your girl. - She is! - You don't live here no more. - That makes no difference! I'm getting her back. She'll marry me someday. - She won't. - We're meant to get married. She's off to college soon. I doubt I'll get to go with her myself, once she gets off. I didn't think it could hurt to go with her this summer. - She'll never marry you. - Don't tell me she won't! She'd never let you screw her. I was just seeing how honest you was. Jacy'd never let you. You ain't that good a cocksman. You never even screwed Charlene all that time. Course I didn't! You know why? Because you had the pickup all the time Saturday night. I didn't have time to screw her. I could've done it in five minutes without a pickup. She only went with you because you was in the backfield... ...and I was in the line. - What are you saying? We was in love. You was. She likes me as much as she ever liked you. - That's a lie. - I'll stay with her all night too. - She promised. - You won't. Why shouldn't I? She told me you couldn't do it that time in Wichita Falls. What happened? This is your Turntable Matinee on KTRN... Now here's Hank Williams. There's a lady in the waiting room. She sent you this. Could you tell her I'm asleep? Please? All right. That too cold? No, it's great. Say, I hear Duane joined the Army. Good place for him too. He didn't mean to hit me with the bottle. That boy's always had meanness in him. Jacy's the kind of girl that brings out the meanness in a man. She's just like her grandmother. I hadn't ought to talk about them. We was all good friends once. Dan roughnecked with Gene Farrow. He and Lois used to live in this one-room place... ...over the newspaper office. Lois couldn't afford a flour sack, much less a mink. I've always had a soft spot for her, though. I wondered a lot of times what would've happened... ...if my Dan had made the strikes that Gene made. They offered that rig to him first. Dan Morgan never took a chance in his life. Do you wish y'all had made it? Sure, I wish we'd made it. I guess the Army won't take me now I just got one good eye. You want to go to Korea and get killed? You ain't got your senses back yet, what few you ever had. The caf won't run itself. You rest up now. Here's for the cheeseburger. I'll bring your change when I bring your supper. Come on in. I was so worried. I had to see you. I've been missing you. And I'm a lot better than I was. Here, sit down. You can't believe how famous we are. We're all anyone talks about. - Yeah, I guess so. - I want us to get married. - What? - I really do. - Get married? - Just as soon as you want to. - Don't you want to? - Oh, yeah. The town will be knocked for a loop. They'll never forget it. Ain't you going to college? I don't care about that. I love you. That's more important. You were so dear to fight for me. My folks won't like it but we'll run off. - They'll kill us. - No, they won't. - They'll kill me. - They'll get over it. You work for Daddy now anyway. Pretty soon, they'll love you just as much as I do. Can we? Sure, I just hope I can see to drive. Don't you worry. I can drive. Don't do that, Sonny. Why not? We're man and wife. We can do anything. Not while I'm driving. I might have a wreck. Wouldn't it be awful if Mama and Daddy got the police after us? - They don't even know where we are. - I had to leave them a note. - So they wouldn't worry. - You shouldn't have done that. I figured they'd have to know sometime. Well, what could they get us for? We got a right to get married. Ain't we? I guess so. I wish you didn't have that stupid eye patch. It's really creepy. I can take it off pretty soon. About two hours will be Lake Texoma. Have a room to ourself. My goodness. You're sitting so close, I can barely drive. Oh, goodness. Howdy. - What part of Texas y'all from? - Anarene. Newlyweds, ain't you? Y'all better follow me in. Somebody's looking for you. We got a right to get married. How can you arrest us? I ain't arresting you. I just want you to come with me. - I don't know what your rights are. - I guess we better follow him. I'll just be heartbroken if my folks have done this. You think I worked hard so Jacy'd end up in a pool hall? - We was gonna get an apartment. - I'll bet! Where are your car keys, hon? It's a hell of a note! - Shut up and take her home. - You bet I will! You take her car. As far as I'm concerned, he can walk! Not much of a wedding night, huh? Not much of one. Here. Have a little drink of bourbon. It'll pick you up. Take all of it. I'm gonna drive. You won't believe this... ...but you're lucky we got you clear of her quick as we did. You'd have been better off staying with Ruth Popper. Does everybody know about that? Of course. Sounded like a good deal to me, kiddo. Shouldn't let Jacy turn your head. Well, she's prettier. I guess I shouldn't have, though. I guess I treated her terrible. Guess you did. Sure weren't out of Texas very long. Oklahoma's not much of an improvement. It's not the same now. Nothing's really been right since Sam the Lion died. No, it hasn't. Oh, God. I get sad if I think of Sam for long. Did you know he had beautiful hands? I guess you liked him, didn't you? I guess everybody did. Well, I'll tell you, it was different with me. I loved him. He loved me too. Are you the one he used to take swimming out at the tank? He told you about that, huh? Yeah, I was the one. I guess if it wasn't for Sam... ...l'd just about have missed it. Whatever it is. I'd have been one of them amity types that thinks... ...that playing bridge is the best thing that life has to offer. Old Sam the Lion. Nobody knows where he got that name. I gave it to him. One night... ...it just came to me. He was so pleased. I was 22 years old then. Can you imagine? It's terrible... ...to only meet one man in life who knows what you're worth. Just terrible. I've looked too. You wouldn't believe how I've looked. Well, now I know. That's why Sam liked you. Loved me. Loved you, I mean. Do you? I can kind of see what he saw in you too. Nope. I'll just go on home. Go on. Get out. Think I could learn to drink? You might. Better keep on practising. That Logan boy's a quarterback, ain't he? Boy, we've finally got us a team! Didn't back in your day, did they? No, we wasn't much good. You just never learned the fundamentals. You know, blocking and tackling. Not like this team. - When was it you graduated? - Last year. You don't mean it. Seems longer than that since you and Duane played ball. I seen Duane a while ago. He's home on leave, wearing his uniform. I ain't seen him yet. - How are you, Chester? - Fine, coach. See if we can't stretch that goddamn thing a little. You know a man never ought to cheat, unless it's for a good cause. He's a good old boy, ain't he? Hi, Mrs. Jackson. Duane here? That's his car out there, ain't it? He's here if he ain't walked off. Hi, how you been? Pretty good. I been thinking all week that I'd run into you. I heard you was going to Korea. Thought I'd get over and see you before you got off. Glad you did. I'm taking the bus in the morning. Want to go to the picture show? Miss Mosey has to close it. - Tonight's the last night. - Yeah, might as well go. Hate to miss the last night. Take the Mercury. Be my last chance to drive it for a while. - Ready, Matthew? - All ready. Take them to Missouri, Matt. That was a good movie. Seen it here before once. Let's run over to Wichita and drink some beer. Okay. I got lots of time till morning. Sure. - So long. - Sorry you're closing the show. Nobody wants to come to shows no more. Kid baseball in the summer, television all the time. Sam had lived, I believe we could've kept it going. But I just didn't have the know-how. Won't be much to do in town with the picture show closed. Well, so long. Duane. You watch out now, overseas. Sure weren't no women around. I guess the next piece of ass I get will be yellow. I wish I was going with you. Take care of the car for me. Your ma don't need it? I wouldn't want her driving it, the way she drives. You might help her take the groceries home sometimes. You ever... You ever hear from Jacy? No, not a thing. She don't get home much. Ain't been back to town since August. I guess she always stays in Dallas. Yeah, probably does. I guess there's lots to do there. I ain't over her yet, you know. No, I ain't over her yet. It's the damnedest thing. That's the only reason you and I got into it that time, you know. Reckon she likes Dallas? Hard to say. Maybe she does. Reckon you and her would've got it straighted out if I hadn't butted in? No, they'd have annulled me too, even if we had. Y'all never even got into the motel? Better get on before we both freeze. Here are the keys. - So long, buddy. - So long, Duane. Be careful. I'll take care of your car. See you in a year or two if I don't get shot. The trucker didn't have a chance. I could see it wasn't his fault. The sand was blowing. I never noticed him. Figured nobody'd be in the street. What was he doing out there anyway? He weren't doing nothing. He's just simple-minded. - Never had sense. - Wasn't your fault. Hell, no. I can see that. He was just a dumb old kid. Didn't know enough to keep his ass out of the cold. Let's eat. Ain't had breakfast. I'd like to know what he was doing with that broom. He was sweeping, you sons of bitches! He was sweeping! Y'all got some crazy kids in this town. Could I have a cup of coffee with you? I guess. I'm sorry. I'm still in my bathrobe. What am I doing apologising to you? Why am I always apologising to you, you little bastard?! Three months I've apologised to you without you even here! I haven't done anything wrong. Why can't I quit apologising?! You ought to be sorry! I wouldn't be in my bathrobe if not for you. I'd have my clothes on. You're the one made me quit caring if I got dressed or not! Just because your friend got killed... ...you want me to forget what you did and make it all right? I'm not sorry for you. You'd have left Billy, just like you left me. I bet you left him plenty of nights... ...whenever Jacy whistled. I wouldn't treat a dog that way. You thought I was so old and ugly you didn't owe me any explanation. You didn't need to be careful. There was nothing I could do, so why be careful? You didn't love me. Look at me. Can't you even look at me? See? Shouldn't have come here. I'm around that corner now. You've ruined it. It's lost completely. Just your needing me won't make it come back. Never you mind, honey. Never you mind. Subtitles by SDI Media Group, Flight 4 from New York now boarding at Gate 7. Flight 741 from Holland now arriving at Gate 8. Taxi. Follow that cab! Howard, Howard Bannister! Howard, when I ask you to wait for me somewhere... ...I expect you to stay there until I come back. Yes, Eunice. It is difficult enough for me to see to all these arrangements myself. - Yes, Eunice. - It is exactly 6:15. If we reach the hotel in half an hour... ...we'll have enough time to dress for the banquet. - Put these things in a taxi. - Yes, Eunice. It's a beautiful city, isn't it, Howard? I'd like to come here on our honeymoon. Did you hear me, Howard? I said I'd like to come here on our honeymoon. What? I thought you wanted to go to San Francisco on your honeymoon. - This is San Francisco, Howard. - Of course it is. Howard! Hey, what're you trying to do, get yourself killed? - You all right back there? - I hope nothing's broken. - It's just a bump. - No. Don't overdramatize. I mean my igneous rocks. I hope they're not damaged. I know how you feel, mister. I hate it when my igneous rocks are even touched. Miss, may I help you? I was wondering if my friends are here. They're visiting from the New Hebrides and I believe they're in Room 1717. - I'm sorry, but that room is vacant. - I don't understand. They told me they would be in Room 1717 at the Hotel Crystal. This is the Bristol, madam, not the Crystal. Then one of us must be in the wrong hotel. Mrs. Van Hoskins. It's so nice to have you back with us. - Thank you, Hans. - Fritz. What happened to Hans? There is no Hans, Mrs. Van Hoskins, there is only me, Fritz. What a shame. Boy! Franz, I'm going to take this with me. There are some things I need tonight. Tomorrow, I want you to put it the hotel safe for me. It will be done, madam. Room service, please. Hi, room service, this is Room 1717. I would like a double thick roast beef sandwich, medium rare... ...on rye bread, mustard on the top, mayonnaise on the bottom... ...and a coffee, hot fudge sundae with a large bottle of diet anything. You got that? Yeah. Room 1717. And, room service, would you... ...put it outside the door. Don't bring it in or knock... ...'cause I'm just putting my baby to sleep. Right. Thank you. I am Miss Eunice Burns, and this is my fianc, Dr. Howard Bannister. We are here for the Congress of American Musicologists' Convention. Go to the drugstore and get some aspirin. I want you to be in shape for this evening. Don't touch that! These are my pre-Paleozoic Tambulu rocks. - Don't touch those rocks. - I'll take care of those. Howard, you go to the drugstore and be back in my room in five minutes. - Right. Eunice? - Yes? - Why am I going to the drugstore? - Aspirin. Get it with buffering added. It's better for the stomach. - Right. - Front. - Flat. - Sir? Your bell is flat. It's half a tone off. - What's up, doc? - I beg your pardon? - We've gotta stop meeting like this. - You're making a mistake. I came in here for something for a headache. You'll need an awfully big glass of water to get that down. What? No, you see, I'm a musicologist. I was just testing this specimen for inherent tonal quality. I have this theory about early man's musical relationship... ...to igneous rock formations. But I guess you're not really interested in igneous rock formations. Not as much as I am in the metamorphic or sedimentary rock categories. I mean I can take your igneous rocks or leave them. I relate primarily to micas, quartz, feldspar. Keep your pyroxenes, magnetites and coarse-grained plutonics... ...as far as I'm concerned. - I forgot why I came in here. - Headache. Yes, thank you. And goodbye. - Was it something I said? - I beg your pardon? What do you think I am, a piece of fruit... ...to squeeze the juice out of and toss? - You're making a mistake. - That's all I am to you. A clerical error. Erase me, forget you even know my name. - I don't know your name. - Judy Maxwell. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Could you let go of my hand? - I don't think so. Look what happened. Oh, dear! Please don't help me. I am perfectly able to do this myself. Be more careful. Did you know that 3 percent of all fatal accidents happen in drugstores? What's going on back there? Nothing, we're just looking for a little aspirin. - Let me help you. - Don't help me! Just go away. Okay. - My husband'll pay for this. - What's he doing on the floor? He suffers from a nervous condition. He falls down a lot. - I don't want people falling down in here. - Well, we're on our honeymoon. - Is this the kind with buffering? - That's right. How much do I owe you? - I beg your pardon? How much is it without buffering? Look, mister, the aspirin is $0.84. This is $67.45. - What's that? - A radio. - I don't want a radio. - What about your wife? - I don't want a wife. I haven't got a wife. - Quit kidding. He's always kidding around. I don't know who you are. I don't know who she is. Come on, Steve, buy her the radio, it's on sale. You call this a honeymoon? What about the aspirin? Hey, Steve! Steve, wait! Wait up, Steve. Am I sorry. I am... I'm terribly sorry. Let me sew it up for you. We'll go someplace quiet. We'll get needle and thread in the drugstore. I don't want to go into the drugstore. I don't like it. Don't be angry. Listen, Steve. My name is not Steve. It is Howard Bannister... ...and now that I've told you I wish you'd forget you've heard it. - I like Steve better. - You've mistaken me for someone else. Now go away and leave me alone. - Why did you follow me into the drugstore? - I didn't, I had headache. - Still have it? - No. - Howard. - See? - Howard. I said five minutes. - I'm sorry, Eunice. That's a person named Eunice? - Where've you been? - I had a problem in the drugstore. - You didn't say you're married. - We're not. - Congratulations. - But we will be soon. Condolences. - Who is this person? - I have no idea. - She was behind a rock in the drugstore. - Tell her about us. - Why is she calling you that name? - Don't pay any attention to her. - Look, Miss Maxwell... - You know her name. I swear this is a bizarre joke. It's easy for you, everywhere you go, another heart broken. Women. You call it joking, Eunice and I, we call it lust. - Don't you know the meaning of propriety? - Propriety? Noun. Conformity to established standards of behavior or manners... ...suitability, rightness, or justness. See ""etiquette."" - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - We don't want to wake up the little one. - We sure don't. I was... ...just... ...Iooking for my key. - Oh, yes. - Can't seem to find it anywhere. - Maybe the door is open. No, I'm sure I locked it. Good night. - Don't forget your dinner. - Yeah, right, I'll get it later. Thanks. - Eunice. Eunice. - Who's there? It's me, Howard Bannister, your fianc. - You look very nice, Howard. - Thank you, Eunice, you look very nice, too. I haven't gotten dressed yet, Howard. Come in, I'll do your tie. - What tie is that, Eunice? - Your tie. The tie in your hand. Yes, of course. My dinner's here. I don't know who he is, but I hate him. Howard, you must have said something to encourage that girl. What do you mean, Eunice? Now, Howard, you know what I'm talking about. - After all, you are a man. - That's true. - She is a woman. - That's true, too. - In the same way that I am a woman. - I don't think of you as a woman, Eunice. I think of you as... ...as Eunice. - But I am a woman, Howard. - I know that. Eunice, I know I don't seem to be a very romantic person. I'm not looking for romance, Howard. I'm looking for something more important than that. Something stronger. As the years go by, romance fades and something else takes its place. - Do you know what? - Senility. - Trust. - That's what I meant. I think we'd better talk about this at some other time. Now, Howard, I want you to make a good impression on Mr. Larrabee. Tell me exactly what you're going to say to him. What? I'll probably say something like, ""Hello there, Mr. Larrabee, I'm Howard."" - You're not. - I'm not Howard. You are not going to say, ""Hi, my name's Howard."" - Anyone can say that, anyone. - Anyone named Howard. You'll to walk straight up to him... ...and take his hand in a firm masculine handshake and say: ""Mr. Larrabee, I'm Dr. Howard Bannister. ""It is a privilege to meet you, sir."" - Think you can do that? - Yes, I think I can. - Well, do your best. Be dignified. - I'll be dignified. - Be solemn, but not stuffy. - I'll be solemn. - Act friendly, but impersonal. - I'll act friendly. - Pull the door open. - I'll pull the door open. - Well, goodbye, Eunice. - Now, don't be nervous, Howard. Just remember, everything depends on this. Now, let's see. Mr. Larrabee, it's an honor to... No, that's not it. What is it? It's a... - It's a privilege to meet you, sir. - Likewise. Mr. Larrabee, it's a privilege to meet you. I'm Dr. Howard Bannister. And I'm your head waiter, Rudy. Can I show you to your table, sir? No, thank you, I think I'll just mingle for a while. - Here you are, sir. - Thank you, I don't drink. - You're upside down, sir. - I'm upside down. Hello? Give me the chief. He is? Tell him... ...I got the documents. - I'm Hugh Simon. - How do you do? - You're upside down. - I know. And, I suppose, you have not read my series of articles... ...on the Versuch einer Anweisung in the Music Monthly. I haven't, I'm sorry. Foolish of you. You must realize that it was that series of articles... ...that helped me to become one of the two finalists... ...in contention for the Larrabee Grant. Amazingly, you are the other one. I can't imagine that the Larrabee Foundation... ...will throw good money away on a study of prehistoric rock dumpings. I think you're oversimplifying my thesis... Oversimplifying? You accuse me of oversimplifying? I never oversimplify. There's an old Croatian saying, Bollixter, which goes... - Bannister. - Well, whatever it is. Our host! Mr. Larrabee? Mr. Larrabee... I'm Hugh Simon, Mr. Larrabee, I would like to say, I love your hair. - Thank you. - On behalf of myself... ...and my colleagues at the conservatory... Yes, indeed. And I believe that this must be Mr... - It's a privilege... - Although, I want you to know... ...that I personally have only contempt for monetary gain. The $20,000 will allow us, me, that is... ...to complete a great body of work, which will most certainly reflect... ...une gloire norme on the Larrabee Foundation. Very well put. Nothing like it. Nothing like a little gloire norme or otherwise... ...but I must point out you're only one of the finalists. - lf I'm not mistaken, this must be... - Mr. Larrabee. - Believe me, I understand it if... - Very understanding of you, Simon. And, now, if you don't mind... - I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry. - It's all right, it's all right. - Dr. Bannister. - Mr. Privilege, it's a... No, that's not it. Anyway, it's nice to see you, sir. - Thank you, I don't drink. - Neither do I. You don't. Shall we sit down, gentlemen? I believe... After you, sir. ...we're all sharing the same table. Mr. Larrabee. Good evening, Prof. Hosquith, this is Howard Bannister. You're Bannister. - How do you do? - Thank you. Your fiance was telling us about your most incredible adventure in the sky. What's this, what incredible adventure did you have? What adventure did I have? What adventure did I have? You mustn't be modest about a simply incredible thing like that. You'll have to tell us all about it, Bannister. Come along to the table, now. Good show, Bannister, good show. - And this must be Miss Burns. - How do you do? - You! - Eunice, Howard, Eunice. We've almost got that stammer cured. Sit down, dear. - How? How? - Howard. Howard. He still gets stuck on names. It's probably the excitement... ...of meeting you for the first time. I must say I can feel it myself. - Can you? - Can I? My heart is going a mile a minute. Why, you can just feel it pounding. Can't you feel it? Yes, I think I can. Yes, it's absolutely... It's certainly in there pounding. It's amazing, you should feel it, gentlemen. Sit down, gentlemen. - Can I sit next to you? - I wouldn't have it another way. Why don't you sit on my right, Bannister? If you could move, Mr. Simon. - But, sir, this is not... - I know, Bannister. This isn't the seating plan according to the place cards... ...but we can break a few of the minor social customs. Sir, I must point out... I must point out that ""foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."" - Emerson! - I beg your pardon, my dear? Ralph Waldo Emerson, born 1803, died 1882. - You like Emerson? - I adore him! I adore anyone who adores him. I adore anyone who adores anyone who adores Emerson. Your turn. She's a delight, Bannister. You're a lucky dog. - But this isn't... - Admit it. - Admit you're a lucky dog. - I'm a lucky dog. But... - Miss Burns, may I call you Eunice? - No! How's that? Howard means that back where we come from... ...everyone calls me Burnsy. - Burnsy? I like that. Burnsy. Help! I presume you are familiar with your fianc's studies, Miss Burns? You presume correctly, Mr. Simon. - You have read his thesis? - Read it! I typed it for him myself. This is not Eunice Burns. Then you must share his inordinate interest in rocks. Passionately. You might say a rock brought us together. You're not Eunice. You will expect me to accept a notion that Neanderthal man found... ...a method of making music out of minerals? I believe I can prove that actual melodies, crude, of course... ...but melodies, based on the diatonic scale similar to the Norse Ventengum chants... I love those Ventengums. ...really existed as far back as 7 million B.C. - You can prove this? - Given the time, and the money, of course. - But really, music from rocks? - It so happens, Mr. Simon... ...that Howard had discussions with Leonard Bernstein... ...about the possibility of conducting an avalanche in E flat. - That's ridiculous. - Where's your sense of humor, Simon? She's a gem, Bannister. - She's unbelievable. - Yes, she is. What do you mean you can't find me? I'm right here. I'm sorry, I have no badge in that name. Will you look again, please? It's Burns, Eunice Burns. I got the jewels. Get out of there, but don't let anyone see you. Roger. Fritz. As you undoubtedly realize, Mr. Larrabee... ...I spent almost six years on this study. - You've got to get out. - And miss all the good stuff that's coming? - She'll be here any minute. - That's the good stuff that's coming. ...in terms of Swiss composers. - Swiss composers, Mr. Simon? - That's right, Miss Burns. I don't imagine that it is a field that the musical archeologists... ...would find particularly rewarding, but it is a rich field... ...in which my groundbreaking scholarship has cultivated a rich harvest. Must've taken a lot of fertilizer. We would like to hear the story that Miss Burns was telling about. - Burnsy. - That Burnsy was telling about... - He calls her Burnsy. - What was it, Bannister? Some incredible adventure your had on your flight here? Yes. No! My Howard is too modest to tell you that story himself. It all began shortly after we passed the point of no return. I think we just passed it. When the amplifiers and directional gyro failed... ...and the flex valve refused to disconnect... ...one of the pilots fainted from fear and went into this power dive. Howard took his igneous rocks into the cockpit, selected two of them... ...with a particularly high magnetic content... ...and set up an electrically-induced field pattern on the... I'm having a nightmare. - What's the problem? - This lady claims to be a Eunice Burns. I am not a Eunice Burns, I am the Eunice Burns. I don't have a badge for a Eunice Burns. Of course not. Miss Burns is wearing her badge. - She's already inside. - That is impossible. - Perhaps you're at the wrong convention. - This is outrageous. And just possibly saving 112 passengers... ...from a tragic, fiery death. Absolutely incredible. I find that story intensely moving. I find that story as difficult to swallow as I do this potage au gele. How would you like to swallow one sandwich de knuckles? - I've got to talk to you privately. - Meet me under the table. - What? - My goodness, there goes my napkin. So far, so good? - Don't you understand anything? - Like what? - Like Eunice. - I don't understand Eunice. - She'll be here soon. - Stop repeating yourself. I'm not repeating myself, I'm not repeating myself. Oh, God, I'm repeating myself. - Steve, you don't want to marry her. - I'm Howard! - Neither of you wants to marry Eunice. - Why is that? You don't want to marry one who'll be wrinkled and flabby. - Everybody gets wrinkled and flabby. - By next week? Hey, what's going on down here? You two can't keep away from each other? We're just talking. Are you all right, Mr. Larrabee? Can I help? No, I'm fine, we were just chatting. - What's going on? - Anything wrong? No. Testing a theory Howard has about vocal reverberation under spinal pressure. What? Vocal reverberation under spinal pressure? - You know V.R.U.S.P.? - Yes. I think I read a monograph on that. Charles, what kind of wine are you serving at Table 1? I'm telling you, Bannister, this girl of yours is fun. F-U-N, and if you win that grant, well, you can consider it her victory... ...as well as your own, do you follow me? - I... I certainly do. Howard! Howard Bannister! Howard, tell them who I am. They're trying to... They're trying to keep me out! Who is that dangerously unbalanced woman? Howard, tell them who I am. Tell them who I am! I insist you tell them who I am right this minute! I never saw her before in my life. Wait! Look, here she comes now. Did you get the jewels out of the hotel? No, I put it in 1714. I didn't have time... What kind of a house detective are you? Can't you commit a burglary? - I'm ashamed. - Never mind. I'll return the case to her room while you detain her. - How do I do that? - Use your charm. Charm. Use your charm. - What do you want? - Madam, it is I, Fritz. I suppose you've come to apologize for the unbelievable criminal injustices... ...which have been visited upon me here. The fact is that one of our guests has lost something. I fail to see how it could be in here unless it crawled in under its own power. Exactly, Miss Burns. What are you trying to say? It's very embarrassing, but one of our regular guests... ...a wealthy eccentric, has lost his pet snake. No! Yes, here. Calm yourself. May I suggest that you shut yourself in the bathroom for a few moments... ...while I search your room. - What if it's in there? It won't be in there. Snakes, as you know, live in mortal fear of tile. Oh, yes. And thank you. It's all right, Miss Burns, you can come out now. What more can they do to me? - What's the matter, Steve? - My name is not Steve... ...and the matter is, how am I going to explain all this to Eunice? - That is the easiest thing. - Easiest thing. First you go right down to her room. You knock on the door. Okay. She answers the door. She will have been crying... ...so her eyes will be all puffy and bloodshot, you know... ...and her nose is all red and running. But, you overlook that. You put your hand on her shoulder... ...you stare purposefully into those red-rimmed, swollen eyes... ...and you say: ""Eunice, there's been a terrible misunderstanding. ""I behaved like, a cad, a bounder. But now I see everything clearly. ""And I have decided that Judy and I are going to put you into a home."" That is not amusing. Steve, what are you so upset about? Tonight was fantastic! - We've got that Larrabee grant sewn up. - We? You have to admit I helped, he calls me Burnsy. That's not the point, you are not Burnsy. Burnsy is Burnsy, I mean Eunice is Burnsy, I mean she isn't Burnsy. Nobody is Burnsy. - So what is the point? - The point is... Oh, God, I've forgotten the point. The point is, you think when Mr. Larrabee finds out I'm not Eunice... ...he'll think you tried to trick him... ...and it's bye-bye $20,000. - Right! That's the point! That money would enable me to establish certain proof for theories of mine. Certain theories that... Must you stand quite so close? I'm very nearsighted. - Where was I? - Certain theories. Right. That money would enable me to travel to southern France... ...to examine evidence of prehistoric art forms 100,000 years old. - Aurignacian or Upper Perigordian? - Both, if I'm given... - Where do you come up with those names? - Just a wild guess. I want you to go away now. Steve, I'm sorry, I only wanted to help. I know you don't mean any harm, you're just... - You're just different. - Thank you. I know I'm different, but from now on... ...I'm gonna try to be the same. Same as what? Same as people who aren't different. - Good, thank you, and goodbye. - Come on, give me a chance. When you get to know me better you'll like me. I won't like you. Goodbye. Let's not say goodbye, let's just say au revoir. No, let's say goodbye. Enter Mrs. Van Hoskins' room through the adjoining room... ...take the jewel case and go to the basement. - What if she wakes up and sees me? - You'll tell her you are smitten with her. That you had followed her all night, and you will make passionate love to her. Couldn't I just kill her? That's crazy. - Hello, out there. - Hello. - No, it must be brain damage. - What? I believe you dropped something. - What do you think you're doing? - I think I'm taking a bath. If you're not out of here in two minutes, I'm calling the police. Who'll they arrest... ...the girl in the tub or the guy with his pants down? I am not joking now, I do not like to act rashly... ...but you are the last straw that breaks my camel's back. You are the plague. You bring havoc and chaos to everyone, but why to me? Why me? Because you look cute in your pajamas, Steve. Get out! - Right now? - Yes! No, wait a minute! Are you all right? - I think I've broken several major bones. - Let me see. - Don't help me! - Tell me where it hurts. The ilium? The sacrum? I hope it's not your coccyx. I can't breathe. Is it possible to break a lung? I think your necktie's too tight. - There. See? Now the phone is ringing. - I'll get it. I can do it. Hello? Yes. Eunice who? Oh, Eunice! Howard, what's going on in there? Nothing much, I fell down. Are you hurt? I'm feeling much better. Thanks for calling. - Howard! - Yes, Eunice? - I'm coming in there. - I wish you wouldn't do that. I want to see if you're all right. I am still very angry with you, but I am concerned. - Do you hear me? - Yes. I think I'll get dressed. Who was that? Who was what? I heard a voice say something... ...about getting dressed. It's the television set, Eunice. There's a war movie on. They're getting dressed for the big battle. It was a woman's voice. They're lady soldiers. It's called The Fighting WACs. Do you have a bathrobe I could put on? I'm coming in! Well, that's it. - Only one thing left to do. - What's that, what? Eunice is coming, you're here, like that. And I'm going to jump. - Steve. - Goodbye. - Steve, wait! - I don't believe it. You did it again. - Excuse me. Are you with the hotel? - Why? I would like the key to 1716, my fianc's in there... ...and I believe he's hurt himself. Sorry, lady, I'm looking for something in 1717. Well, ordinarily I wouldn't even ask for it... ...but I think it's... I got my orders from the desk clerk downstairs. I gotta go to 1717, so please, don't bother me now. Howard. Open this door, Howard. Howard, I know you're in there. Do you hear me? Howard, open this door immediately! Howard! - What's wrong with the closet? - She'll look in there. What kind of a person is she? Howard Bannister, I am talking to you. I know you're in there. I can't. I'm terrified of heights, I'm acrophobic. - There's a ledge. - I'm ledge-a-phobic. - Until I can get rid of her. - I can't! Howard, do you hear me? - She has a violent temper. - I can't! Howard! - She studies karate. - Maybe I can. Howard. I am going to count to five. Don't count, Eunice. I hate it when you count. One. Two. Three. Four. Five! Hello, Eunice, come on in. Howard, if you have betrayed my trust in you... What's that? That's a bath. I was going to take a bath. Since when have you taken bubble baths? It came out of the faucet that way, Eunice. - Why are your rocks in the bathroom? - I don't know, I wish I did, but I don't. - What are you looking for, dear? - Howard, you are not being open with me. I am being open with you, Eunice, I'm always open. It's open. Good evening. Where do you want it, ma'am? Where do I want what? - Roast beef on rye. Mustard on top... - I don't want food! Room 1716, right? Well, I'll just set it up over here. - What's that? - What's what? - I hear knocking. - It's your nerves. - Why are you fiddling with the window? - Too much fresh air, dear, very harmful. Howard, will you turn off that... ...television? Howard, if you don't turn that set off I am going to scream! You are screaming, Eunice. Hey, have a heart, we're trying to get some sleep down here. Eunice. - Pull the plug out. - It's cable. Pull the cable out. Hey, come on. I'm gonna call the police. Down there. Take the hose down the hallway. Down here. ...the fire department go to 1716. Miss Burns, what are you doing in Mr. Bannister's room? Don't you know the meaning propriety? Hello? Come in, it's broken. I mean, it's open. Good morning. No, I don't think so. I'm Mr. Kaltenborn, the manager of what's left of the hotel. I'm awfully sorry about this mess. Usually this doesn't happen. Mr. Bannister, I have a message for you from the staff of the hotel. - What is it? - Goodbye. That's the entire message? - We'd appreciate it if you'd check out. - When? - Yesterday. - That soon? I don't suppose you have another room you could let me use just for... No. Oh, well. These are my igneous Tambulu rocks. Yes, of course they are. Where were you thinking of going now? My fiance, Miss Sleep, is still burning and... ...Miss Burns is still sleeping. I thought maybe I would just sit in the lobby and wait. I'm awfully sorry about the room. That's all right, we have lots of others. That's a nice view. I must be crazy. I must be crazy. I'm looking at the view. Eunice is going home. ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, he walks into mine."" ""Play it, Sam."" I don't... C minor 7th. That's very good. Yeah. What's wrong? The future. What's the matter with it? Judging from the recent past... Edmund Burke said, ""You can never plan the future by the past."" I beg your pardon? You're wondering what a girl like me is doing quoting Edmund Burke? I was a political science major. Did you learn about rocks there? - You have a case like mine. - Yes. - No? - No. Advanced geology, Wellesley. - What about the music? - Bennington, musical appreciation. Comp lit, Northwestern University. Archaeology, Tuskegee Institute. General semantics, University of Chicago. Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M. Say when. - Trying to become? - A graduate. - Why is that important? - It was to my father. He was upset when I was asked to leave college. ""Asked"" to leave? - Bounced. You want to know why? - No. He sent me someplace else after that, but it didn't work out. None of them did. Some of it was very nice, I read a lot of good books. I went to a lot of movies, but something always seemed to go wrong. - I can believe that. - This last time was not my fault! What happened? Nothing really. It was just a little classroom. It sort of burned down. - Burned down? - Blew up, actually. - Political activism? - Chemistry major. - Now I'm really scared to go home. - So am I. How do you mean? Eunice and I came from Iowa. The conservatory got together this fund... ...so that I could come here and win this grant. - I forgot to give you this letter! - What letter? It was under your door when I came to your room. - Did you open this? - How else could I have read it? - The grant! Mr. Larrabee! - Yes! - Yes, I saw. - Oh, boy, the $20,000! I know. - I've got to tell Eunice. - Of course you do. After all, she is... - She is my fiance. - Of course she is. She deserves to be the first. Or, at least, the second. Yeah. Where was I? Eunice? Who is Eunice? Eunice? Eunice? Eunice, open the door, I have some wonderful news. I do not want your apologies, Howard. I think it is too late for that. All right, Eunice, no apologies. Have you no heart? I'd think after what you have done to me you'd come crawling for forgiveness. Eunice, please let me read you this letter. ""Dear Howard,"" do you hear that? ""Howard."" That is your name. ""The committee agreed that barring unforeseen circumstances... ""...you'll be the next recipient of the Larrabee Grant. ""Please join me for a luncheon at my house, around noon... ""...and bring your charming fiance. Sincerely, Frederick."" Look, Eunice, ""Frederick."" How he could refer to me as your... ...""charming fiance"" when he's never met me? We can straighten all that out. All right, Howard. It will take me some time to get dressed. You go without me, and I'll follow as soon as possible. - The address, please? - 888 Russian Hill. And Eunice... 888 Russian Hill. Take it to 459 Dirello Street. Deliver it to the boys on the second floor. 459 Dirello Street. It's settled, Eunice will meet us there. I really think it's going to work. - What could go wrong? - Please, don't you say that. Tell Mr. Larrabee that Eunice is really Eunice... ...and the Eunice he thinks is Eunice isn't Eunice. - What will you say? - About what? - Yourself. - I'll say I'm a girl you picked up. - No. You don't say anything. - Right, I just sit there and nod. Yes. Then this whole terrible episode will be over. What about us? We'll say goodbye. It's that simple. I think. Okay. You go get a taxi, I'll be out in a minute. Miss Eunice Burns, please. Yes? Miss Burns, this is Sylvia, Mr. Larrabee's personal secretary. There's been a mix-up in the invitation. The luncheon has been switched from Mr. Larrabee's home... ...to one of the Larrabee offices. Mr. Bannister has already gone... I caught Mr. Bannister on his way out and told him. - The address is, do you have a pencil? - Yes. - 459 Dirello Street. - Dirello? Second floor. - Thank you, Miss... - Louise. I thought you said, ""Sylvia."" Yes, Sylvia-Louise, you know with a hyphen? Excuse me. Robbed! All of my jewels! Help! All of my jewels. Thieves! Robbers! Are you sure this is the right address? 459 Dirello Street, lady. You don't want me to wait, do you? Yes, I do. I didn't think so. Hello? Hello? Hello? This can't be the Larrabee... Those are Howard's. What on earth are you doing with Howard Bannister's rocks? Thank you very much. There they are, our two stars. Congratulations, Howard. - Thank you, Mr. Larrabee. - Frederick. I have something very important to tell you. Come with me and meet my friends. May I take that, sir? No, thank you, I'll hold on to it. I see you're all dressed up for a celebration. - What happened, Bollister? - Bannister. All of your other clothes burn up? - You remember our Mr. Simon. - Miss Burns, isn't it? - No, it's Burnsy. - Of course. Ladies and gentlemen, and Mr. Larrabee. Frederick! Mr. Frederick. What I want to say... What Howard's trying to says is how much he appreciates your hospitality. We'll both think of you when we're back in Iowa. What compelling sentiments. Did anyone ever tell you that you were very sexy? Well, actually, no. They never will. I have a little announcement to make that may be of some interest. My natural curiosity was aroused, and so I did a little research... ...on Mr. Bannister and Miss Burns and I think... I think it can wait until Howard has given us a little recital... ...on those famous rocks of his. How about it, Howard? All right. For those of you unfamiliar with Dr. Bannister's theory... ...of percussional and prehistoric and rhythmical communications... ...let me try to point out... What's the matter? - Is something the matter? - Wrong case! Identical traveling cases. Sweet, isn't it? Excuse me, Mr. Larrabee, I wanted to ask you something. What were you saying about... I think a slight mistake has been made. A slight mistake, Mesdames and Messieurs... ...is in the so-called identity of these alleged colleagues. I don't know who he is, but she is definitely not herself. What are you babbling about, Simon? Nobody move! Get over there. I want that case. Which one? - What? - Which one? Either one! Just slide it over here. Don't move! Get away from that case. This is inexcusable. You can't come in here uninvited. Stand back, all of you. All I want is that one, or that one, or maybe that one. Throw that up here. Howard! They've got your rocks! - Don't nobody do nothing! - This is unheard of. Throw down the case and the gun. Don't shoot me, I'm part Italian. Button it! Don't kick those rocks, you Philistine! Shut up! Don't you dare strike that brave, unbalanced woman! Mister! Grab his legs! Give me that. - Having fun? - I can't find my rocks! - Grab the cases. - Which ones? All of them! Don't! How many cases are there? - I believe there're four of them. - I've got three. Wait a minute. Stick them in here. - How are your legs? - My legs? Never mind, push! Hey! Come on. - What? - Get on! Come on, Steve, you can do it! My name is Howard. We are going to lose them if you don't hurry. Follow that cab, I'm with the government! All right. Here they come. Hang on! Come on, Harry, keep going. You're in my way, I can't see! No! - What is it? - Don't ask. - Put on the brakes. - I am! No! - Where are we? I can't see. - There's not much to see... ...we're inside a Chinese dragon. Let's go. - Wait, I know where the alley comes out. - All right, let's go. I've got an idea. Follow me. - What's the idea? - Stick with me. No! Thank you very much. - This is a terrible thing we're doing. - It's fantastic, you'll love it. I'm sorry, we'll be right back. What are you doing? This is a one-way street! We're only going one way! - Look out! - I am looking out. Oh, no! - What are you doing? - Driving! - I know that! - It's my first time. It's a cinch. - What does this thing do over here? - Let me do it, for Pete's sake! Look out for that thing! Will you turn off those things? How? That's the radio! How are we doing? Here they come! Turn here! Okay. I'm turning! - Look at that! Go there! - What? No! Yes! Duck! Now what? - Back up. - I knew you'd say that. Where are they? - Mr. Larrabee, will you help me? - Frederick! - Frederick, will you help me? - Yes, I will. Who are you? I am Eunice Burns. Who cares who she is, we're going to be killed! We'll all be killed! I think we lost them. Would you turn the radio off, please? Sure. - I better turn down there to be sure. - Okay. Sorry! They're gaining on us. There's a good road right down there. Okay. I can't see where we're going! Let me clean your glasses. Now I really can't see! Judy, I can't see. Oh, God, I can see. They're headed for the ferry! - Follow them! - Okay! - We can make it! - No. We can make it! I don't think we can make it. Where are they going? Help! No, I mean, I'll help you. Look at them. A foul and depraved-Iooking lot, Bailiff. Those are just the spectators, Your Honor. Of course... Get on with it. All stand! Hear ye, all those present. Let it be known court... ...is now in session as of this day, the 30th of July, 1972. His Honor Marvin B. Maxwell presiding. Sit down. I don't want any noise tonight. I don't want any disturbances or demonstrations of any kind. I want peace and calm and order. If there is any nonsense, of any sort... ...I will be merciless. Merciless! Is that clearly understood? Do you think they understood that, Bailiff? Yes, sir, I'm sure they did. Let's get tonight's horror show on the road. Is Your Honor feeling all right? No, My Honor is not feeling all right. My head is pounding, my metabolism has practically ceased to function... ...and my nerves are shot. That's too bad, sir. Do you have any idea what it's like to sit here night after night... ...and watch this endless parade of human debris floating by? Yes, sir, of course I have. No, you don't. You don't have to make up your mind... ...whether to put them away in some ghastly hellhole. Or turn them all loose to commit some other hideous offense. I'd like to send every one of them to an island somewhere... ...wrapped in heavy chains. Do you know why I don't, Bailiff? Why, Judge? Compassion. I just have too much compassion. And that's why I'm a wreck. You see this yellow pill? Yes, sir. You know what it's for? What, Judge? To remind me to take this blue pill. What's the blue one for, Judge? I don't know. They're afraid to tell me. Your Honor, I think it'll be pretty quiet tonight. It was deliberate. You have no right pushing! Silence! Silence, silence, silence! Shut it! Everyone. If there are any further outbursts of this nature, I'll give somebody orders... ...to shoot to kill. You've made me smash my Life Savers. Now we're going to get this story calmly and clearly. First of all... ...just what the devil are these? - My rocks. - My jewelry. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Whom do these cases belong to? The government! I want my bike back. I'll give your bike back. I'll give you a broken back if you don't be quiet. Officer. What are these people being charged with? That's kind's hard to say, Judge. Give it a shot. Well, sir, we picked some of them out of San Francisco Bay. Entering the country illegally? No, sir, they drove in. - Into the country? - Into the bay. That's better. Unauthorized use of public waters. Mostly in stolen cars. That's grand larceny. Then, there was a shooting. That's assault with a deadly weapon. They broke into my home. That's breaking and entering. And they brought her with them, forcibly. That's kidnapping. They tried to molest me. That's unbelievable. Your Honor, I can clear all this up in 10 seconds. - You do, and you'll get a prize. - May I approach the bench? Yes. Watch him like a hawk. As you can see, I represent our government. God bless it! Shut up! Go on. Your Honor, I have been following this person's movements... ...for quite some time and I can prove... ...that he is in unauthorized possession of secret government... ...underwear. Underwear? - Get the court psychiatrist. - Watch out, those might be my rocks. - Tell him to bring straight jackets. - We have a right to know! In assorted sizes. - Order in the court! - Order in the court! - Everyone be quiet! - Everyone be quiet! - Silence! - Silence! - You, too. - Me, too. Now, this is a court of law... ...my court of law! It may not look like much to you, but it's all I've got! Ordinarily I would threaten you with contempt. But in this case, and I think the Supreme Court will back me up... ...I am seriously considering setting up a torture chamber! I want this whole ridiculous story... ...told by one person. Does anybody here think they can handle it? All right. And while he's telling it... ...the rest of you keep whips... ...red-hot irons in the back of your minds. Sir, my name is Howard Bannister and I'm from Ames, Iowa. No excuse. No, sir, it all started when I bumped my head in the taxi... ...on the way in from the airport. Are you pleading insanity or amnesia? Neither. I went to the drugstore to get something for a headache... ...the druggist tried to charge me for a radio. She said her husband would pay for it. But I didn't, of course. Of course. She ripped my jacket and when Eunice came along... - Who's Eunice? - Eunice is my fiance. You have a wife and a fiance? No, sir. But, she kept calling me ""Steve."" Your own fiance calls you Steve? No, sir, my wife. Or rather the one who isn't my wife. What does the one who isn't your fiance call you? Howard? No, sir, the one who isn't my fiance doesn't call me Howard. The one who isn't my wife doesn't call me Howard. The one who isn't my fiance also isn't my wife. The other one who isn't my wife, who is my fiance... ...she doesn't call me Steve. She calls me Howard. Do you see? Let's just skip over this part, and move on. That night at the banquet she was there again. Who was there, your wife or your fiance? Neither. There's a third? No, sir, the one who isn't either. Everyone was calling her ""Burnsy."" - Why? - That's short for Burns, Eunice's last name. Eunice was there. No, sir, Burnsy was there, or rather, the one who isn't Burnsy. I think I want to skip over this part, too. That night, I went back to my room and she was in the bath. Who was there? No, don't tell me, just go on. When Eunice walked in and the drapes caught fire. Everything burned. They asked me to leave. I really don't blame them. Good boy. - Is there more? - Sure. - There's more. - Well, the next day, today... ...Mr. Larrabee asked me to his house with my rocks and to bring Eunice. Or rather, Burnsy, the one he thinks is Eunice. - Is that clear? - No, but it's consistent. - Shall I go back over it? - No, please, I beg you, don't. Just go on. It gets kind of complicated now. First, there was this trouble between me and Hugh. - You and me? - No, not you, Hugh. I am Hugh. - You are me? - No, I am Hugh. Stop saying that. Make him stop saying that. - Don't touch me, I'm a doctor. - Of what? - Music. - Can you fix a hi-fi? - No, sir. - Then shut up! He came in and tried to get my case, and then he came in and tried to get his... ...then they came in and tried to get all the cases... ...then shooting started. They forced me to come. I was out in the car the whole time! You little fink! Silence. Silence! Order! Now this is my last warning! I intend to get to the bottom of this web of deceit and confusion... ...if it takes me the rest of my life! Which may end at any minute. Now, you. You in the blanket. You seem to have caused all this. Exactly what have you got to say for yourself? - Judy! - Hello, Daddy. Got your rocks back? Got your things back. - Going somewhere? - Back to school. - Another one. - Sure. According to the 1970 enrollment studies... ...there are one 1,145 institutions of higher education. I've got quite a few to go. Look at that! Could you give me information about flights to Rio de Janeiro? It wasn't all so bad, was it? Of course, it was terrible, that they took the grant away from you. They had to do that, the Larrabee Foundation isn't used... ...to having to bail its founder out of jail. There are a lot of other grants. - I was reading... - I wish you wouldn't tell me about it. You see, you have this way of making everything sound reasonable... ...and then rooms begin to burn, people start to chase people... Look at that! - I guess I owe you $20,000. - Don't be silly. If I paid you off at $10 a week, we'd be even... ...in 38 years and 5 and a half months. - You did that fast. - New math, Mount Holyoke. - Miss Maxwell. - Hello, young man. - Mrs. Van Hoskins. Miss Maxwell, as you may know, there was a $20,000 reward... ...for the return of my jewels. I paid for the damage done to your room, that was $2,800. And then that little car you were in, that was $2,400. Of course, the two other cars, let me see... ...there was $3,400 for the taxi... I guess I'd better have my little list. Yes, of course. $2,600 for the other. Now the pane of glass you broke was $1,600. Damages to a costume store, a restaurant, a delivery cart... ...and, goodness me, a Chinese dragon. One canopy, $2,300 and $1,000 in court costs... ...making a grand total of... Leaving $50 to be split between you two... ...and the cab driver and that dear little old man... ...and, of course, the gentlemen from the government. And there you are, my dear. And God bless you. Michael. That leaves only 38 years, 5 months and 1 week to go. See, sometimes it's kind of fun. - I know, but... - Don't tell me, you need peace and quiet. That's right. - You'll miss me. - I know that, too. Well. Well. - Howard, Howard Bannister! - We have come to see Mr. Simon off. - What are you doing here, Eunice? - No hard feelings, Bannister? - C'est la vie. - C'est la guerre. C'est la dreck. I will be catching my plane now, so it will be arrivederci to all. - Don't forget this, Simon. - What? The check. Would you care to have just a look at it, Bannister? - That's very nice. - You deserved it, Howard, you really did. I suppose there are some who think there's some merit... ...in the study of prehistoric mineral tampings... ...but I think the Hugh Simon theory of Swiss scale patterns... ...will stand the test of time. - What is that theory, Mr. Simon? - I doubt you're qualified to understand. - Try me. The Simon theory advances the notion that 16th-17th century Swiss composers... Yes? Developed a uni-tonic scale pattern... ...based upon the uniform intervals utilized in the mountaineer yodel. - You developed this theory? - I invented it. That should come as some shock to Professor Findelmeyer. - What are you talking about? - The Findelmeyer Proposition. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Sure you do! That has never been translated. Just once! 1925, Harvard Press Musicological Review. - It's probably out of print... - Of course! Professor Hydrich Findelmeyer, the University of Zurich, 1911. The controversial Findelmeyer Proposition. No wonder it sounded so familiar. - I'm sorry, Simon. - This is unspeakable! Simon, you're a plagiarist. What's worse, you're a bad loser. I don't like you and I want you to go away! The Foundation will make out a new check... ...and send it on to you at the conservatory. - Thank you, Mr. Larrabee. - Frederick. Howard, I've asked Eunice to stay on with me for a few days. In separate quarters, of course. Of course. We've shared a great deal in the past day or so, and I think perhaps... You know what I mean. Goodbye, Howard. You'd better hurry or you'll miss your plane. Come, Frederick, now it is 12:05 and the lecture starts promptly at 1:00. Well, Judy, I guess... Judy? Judy. United Airlines Flight 634, boarding through Gate 62. What? No, I'm a transfer student. No, not the University, the Conservatory of Music. It's in Ames. You never heard of it? It's a small conservatory, but people love it. There's a professor there whom I hope to study with... ...a brilliant man, Dr. Howard Bannister. No, Bannister as in ""sliding down the."" You have heard of him? Yeah, that's right, the nut with the rocks. What's up, doc? Did you happen to know that I love you? - Yeah. - You did? Do? Listen, kiddo, you can't fight a tidal wave! About those things I said, I mean, the way I acted back there... ...I'm sorry. Let me tell you something. ""Love means never having to say you're sorry."" That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. ""We really mean it ""What's up ""Doc?"" That's all, folks. English, A fiddler on the roof. Sounds crazy, no? But here, in our little village of Anatevka, you might say every one of us is a fiddler on the roof. Trying to scratch out a pleasant, simple tune without breaking his neck. It isn't easy. You may ask why do we stay up there if it's so dangerous? Well, we stay because Anatevka is our home. And how do we keep our balance? That I can tell you in one word: Tradition. ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition! ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition! ~ Because of our traditions, we've kept our balance for many, many years. Here in Anatevka, we have traditions for everything. How to sleep. How to eat. How to work. How to wear clothes. For instance, we always keep our heads covered, and always wear a little prayer shawl. This shows our constant devotion to God. You may ask, how did this tradition get started? I'll tell you. I don't know. But it's a tradition. And because of our traditions, every one of us knows who he is and what God expects him to do. ~ Who, day and night, must scramble for a living ~ ~ Feed a wife and children, say his daily prayers ~ ~ And who has the right as master of the house ~ ~ To have the final word at home ~ ~ The papa ~ ~ The papa ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ The papa ~ ~ The papa ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Who must know the way to make a proper home ~ ~ A quiet home, a kosher home ~ ~ Who must raise a family and run the home ~ ~ So Papa's free to read the Holy Book ~ ~ The mama ~ ~ The mama ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ The mama ~ ~ The mama ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ At three I started Hebrew school ~ ~ At ten I learned a trade ~ ~ I hear they picked a bride for me ~ ~ I hope she's pretty ~ ~ And who does Mama teach to mend and tend and fix ~ ~ Preparing her to marry whoever Papa picks ~ ~ The daughters ~ ~ The daughters ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ The papas Mamas ~ ~ Sons The daughters ~ ~ Tradition ~ And in the circle of our little village, we've always had our special types. For instance, Yente, the matchmaker. Reb Nachum, the beggar. And, most important of all, our beloved rabbi. Rabbi, may I ask you a question? Certainly, Leibesh. Is there a proper blessing for the Tzar? A blessing for the Tzar? Of course. May God bless and keep the Tzar... far away from us. ~ Dai dai dai dai ~ ~ Dai dai dai dai ~ ~ Dai dai dai dai Dai dai dai dai dai ~ ~ Dai dai dai dai ~ ~ Dai dai dai dai ~ ~ Dai dai dai dai Dai dai dai dai dai ~ Then there are the others in our village. They make a much bigger circle. We don't bother them and, so far, they don't bother us. And among ourselves, we always get along perfectly well. Of course, there was the time when he sold him a horse and told him it was only six years old when it was really twelve. But now it's all over. And we all live in simple peace and harmony. - It was really twelve years old. - It was six. Tevye knows it was twelve. Twelve. It was twelve. ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition! ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition! ~ ~ Dai dai dai dai dai ~ ~ Dai dai dai dai ~ Traditions, traditions. Without our traditions, our lives would be as shaky as... as... As a fiddler on the roof. Mama, Yente the matchmaker is coming. Maybe she's finally found a good match for you, Tzeitel. From your mouth to God's ears. Why is she here now? It's almost Sabbath. Out, all of you. I want to talk to Yente alone. But, Mama, the men she finds... The last one was so old. And he was bald. He had no hair. A poor girl without a dowry can't be so particular. You want hair, marry a monkey. Even a poor girl has to look at her husband sometimes. A husband is not to look at, a husband is to get. - I'm not yet 20 years old. I don't think... - Sha! Do you have to boast about your age? You wanna tempt the evil eye? Da, da, da. Out, all of you. There's work to be done before the Sabbath. Golde. Golde. I have such news for you. And not every-day-in-the-week news. Once-in-a-lifetime news. Such diamonds, such jewels. I'll find a husband for every one of them. But you shouldn't be so picky. Right? Of course, right. After all, even the worst husband is better than no husband. God forbid! Who should know better than me? Ever since my husband died, I've been a poor widow. All alone, no one to talk to, nothing to say to anyone. All I do at night is think of him. And even thinking of him gives me no pleasure. - Is Tzeitel in the house? - Why don't you go and find out? Thank you, Bielke. He never raised his voice. Good afternoon. Is Tzeitel in the house? She's busy. Come back later. There's something I'd like to tell her. - Later. - Later? Hm. What does that poor skinny tailor want with Tzeitel? They've been friends since they were babies. They play... - They play? What do they play? - I don't know. They're children. From such children come other children. Motel is nothing. Yente, you said you had news for me. Ah, children, children... They are your blessing in your old age. But my Aaron, may he rest in peace, couldn't give me children. To tell you the truth, he hardly tried. But what's the use complaining? Other women enjoy complaining. Not Yente. Not every woman in the world is a Yente. Well, I have to go home now to prepare my poor Sabbath meal. So, goodbye, Golde. And it was a pleasure talking our hearts out to each other. You said you had news for me. I'm losing my head. Some day it will fall off altogether. And a horse will kick it in the mud and ""Goodbye, Yente"". Of course, the news. It's about Lazar Wolf, the butcher. A good man. A fine man. And I don't have to tell you he's well off, no? But he's lonely, the poor man. He's been a widower all these years. You understand? Of course you do. To make it short, out of the whole town he's cast his eye on Tzeitel. - My Tzeitel? - No, the Tzar's Tzeitel. Of course your Tzeitel. Such a match for my Tzeitel. But Tevye wants a learned man. He doesn't like Lazar. Lazar won't marry him. He wants the daughter, not the father. Listen to me, Golde. You send Tevye to him. Don't tell him what it's about. Let Lazar discuss it himself. He'll win him over, he's a good man and a wealthy man. You'll let me know how it went. And you don't have to thank me, Golde, because, aside from my fee, which Lazar will pay anyway, it gives me satisfaction to make people happy. True? Of course, true. So, goodbye, Golde, and you're welcome. Goodbye, Yente. Come, children. Get changed for the Sabbath. Hurry with your work. I wonder if Yente found a husband for you. I'm not anxious for her to find me one. - Unless it's Motel, the tailor. - I didn't ask you. Tzeitel, they have to make a match for you before they can make one for me. - Then after her, one for me. - So if Yente... Yente, Yente, Yente! Somebody has to arrange the matches. - She may bring someone wonderful. - Interesting. - And well off. - And important. ~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match ~ ~ Find me a find, catch me a catch ~ ~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, look through your book ~ ~ And make me a perfect match ~ ~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, I'll bring the veil ~ ~ You bring the groom, slender and pale ~ ~ Bring me a ring for I'm longing to be the envy of all I see ~ ~ For Papa, make him a scholar ~ ~ For Mama, make him rich as a king ~ ~ For me, well, I wouldn't holler if he were as handsome as anything ~ ~ Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match ~ ~ Find me a find, catch me a catch ~ ~ Night after night in the dark I'm alone ~ ~ So find me a match of my own ~ Since when are you interested in a match, Chava?

Did you have to make him lame just before the Sabbath? That wasn't nice. It's enough you pick on me. Bless me with five daughters, a life of poverty, that's all right. But what have you got against my horse? Really, sometimes I think, when things are too quiet up there, you say to yourself, ""Let's see. What kind of mischief can I play on my friend, Tevye?"" Uh-huh. So you're finally here, my breadwinner. I'll talk to you later. - Why are you late today? - His foot went lame. Hurry up. The sun won't wait. I have something important to say to you. I still have deliveries. - You'll be late for the Sabbath. - I won't be late. - You'll be late. - I won't be late. I won't be late. - If you ever stop talking, I won't be late. - You can die from such a man. As the Good Book says ""Heal us, O Lord, and we shall be healed."" In other words, send us the cure. We've got the sickness already. Well, I'm not really complaining. After all, with your help... I'm starving to death. Oh, dear Lord. You made many, many poor people. I realise, of course, it's no shame to be poor. But it's no great honour either.

Will you stop braying like mules? Let the man talk. Talk, Avram. My paper came to the post office today, like it does every week. Usually on a Thursday, but sometimes... Avram, that's not talking. That's babbling. The news, what does it say? Quiet! Talk, Avram. I was reading my paper. Nothing important, a story about the crops in the Ukraine, and this and that. Avram, talk. And then I saw this. All right. We all see it. What does it say? ""In a village called Rajanka, all the Jews were evicted, forced to leave their homes."" For what reason? It doesn't say. Maybe the Tzar wanted their land. Maybe a plague. - May he have his own personal plague. Amen! Why don't you ever bring us some good news? It's not my fault. I only read it. ""An edict from the authorities."" May the authorities grow like onions, with their heads in the ground. Amen! What good will your cursing do? You stand around, you curse and you chatter, and you don't do anything. - You'll all chatter your way into the grave. - Excuse me. - You're not from this village. - No. - Where are you from? - Kiev. I was a student in the university. Tell me, is that the place where you learned how not to respect your elders? That is where I learned there is more to life than talk. You should know what's going on in the outside world. Why break my head about the outside world? Let the outside world break its own head. Well put. He is right. As the Good Book says, ""If you spit in the air, it lands in your face."" Nonsense. You can't close your eyes to what's happening in the world. - He is right. - He's right and he's right? They can't both be right. You are also right. He's too young to wipe his own nose. Good Sabbath, Tevye. - Here. Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath, Tevye. - Tevye, Tevye? - I'm sorry. I apologise. Good Sabbath. - Tevye, the rabbi's order. - Of course. So you're from Kiev, Reb? - Perchik. - Perchik. So you're a newcomer here, huh? As Abraham said, ""I'm a stranger in a strange land."" Moses said that. Forgive me. As King David said, ""I'm slow of speech and slow of tongue."" That was also Moses. For a man with a slow tongue, he talked a lot. Here, Reb Perchik. Have a piece. I have no money, and I'm not a beggar. Take it. It's a blessing for me to give. Very well. For your sake. Thank you. It's no crime to be poor. It is the rich who are the criminals. Some day, their wealth will be ours. That would be nice. If they would agree, I would agree. And who will make this miracle to come to pass? Ordinary people. - Like you? - Like me. Until your golden day comes, Reb Perchik, how will you live? By giving lessons to children. Do you have children? I have five daughters. Five? Daughters. Girls should learn, too. Girls are people. - A radical. - Go away. I'd be willing to teach them, open their minds to great thoughts. I'd like them to know the Good Book. The Bible has many lessons for our times. Perchik, I'm a very poor man. But, food for lessons, huh? Good. Stay with us for the Sabbath. Of course, we don't eat like kings, but we don't starve either. As the Good Book says, ""When a poor man eats a chicken, one of them is sick."" - Where does the Book say that? - All right, all right. It doesn't exactly say that, but some place, it mentions a chicken. - Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath, children. Children, this is Perchik. - Perchik, this is my eldest daughter. - Good Sabbath. - You have a pleasant daughter. - I have five pleasant daughters. This is mine. And this is mine. And this is mine. And this is mine. And this is mine. And... Well, this is not mine. Perchik, this is Motel Kamzoil. So, you did us a favour and came home. This is also mine. Golde, this is Perchik from Kiev. He's staying the Sabbath with us. He's a teacher. Would you like lessons from him? - Yes, Papa. - I'm a very good teacher. I heard that the rabbi who must praise himself has a congregation of one. Your daughter has a quick and witty tongue. The wit she gets from me. - As the Good Book says... - The Good Book can wait. Get washed. - The tongue she gets from her mother. - Motel, you're also eating with us? Of course. Another blessing. Tzeitel, get the small table. Chava, the chairs from outside. Children, finish dressing. You can wash at the well. Hurry, it's almost the Sabbath. Tevye. Tevye, I've something to say to you. Why should today be different? I have something to tell you. - I have something to tell you. - Yente was here. I saw her. If they agree on a match, it will be too late for us. But I have found someone who will sell me his used sewing machine. In a few weeks, I'll be able to buy it. - Then your father... - It might be too late. - Lazar Wolf wants to see you. - The butcher? What about? I don't know. Only he says it's important. What can be important? I have nothing for him to slaughter. After the Sabbath, talk with him. About what? If he's thinking about buying my new milk cow, he can forget it. - Tevye, I want you to talk. - Shh. Tevye. Tevye, I want you to talk to... What else can I do? You could ask my father for my hand tonight. Now. Why should he consider me now? I'm only a poor tailor. And I'm only the daughter of a poor milkman. - Just talk to him. - If your father says no, that's it. - He'll yell at me. - Motel... - I'm just a poor tailor. - Motel! Even a poor tailor is entitled to some happiness. That's true. - Amen. - Amen. A man sends you an important a message, at least you can talk to him. All right, after the Sabbath I'll talk to him. All right, I'll talk to him. It's getting late. - Where is everybody? - I don't know, Papa. Children, come down. We are lighting the candles. - Reb Tevye... - Not now, Motel. Hurry up, children. - Reb Tevye. - Not now. Golde, the sun is almost down. - Reb Tevye... - What is it? - Reb Tevye... - Yes? - Reb Tevye... - Yes? Yes? Yes? Well, Motel, what is it? Good Sabbath, Reb Tevye. Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath. Hurry up. Hurry, children, hurry.

How goes it with you, Reb Tevye? - How should it go? - You're right. - And you? - The same. I'm sorry to hear that. Uh... Uh... How is your brother-in-law in America? - He's doing very well. - He wrote you? - Not lately. - How do you know? If he was doing badly, he would write. Ah, ah, ah, ah. - Lechaim. - Lechaim. - Tevye. - Yeah? I suppose you know why I wanted to see you. Yes, I do, but... There is no use talking about it. Tevye, I understand how you feel, but after all you have a few more without her. I see. Today you want one. Tomorrow you may want two. Two? What would I do with two? The same as you do with one. Tevye. This is very important to me. Why is it so important to you? Frankly, because... I'm lonely. Lonely? Reb Lazar, what are you talking about? How can a little cow keep you company? Little cow? - Is that what you call her? - But that's what she is. - What are you talking about? - Don't you know? Of course, I know. We are talking about the milk cow you want to buy from me. A milk cow. A milk cow so I won't be lonely? I'm talking about... your daughter Tzeitel. My daughter Tzeitel? Of course, your daughter Tzeitel. I see her every Thursday in my butcher's shop. And she's made a very good impression on me. A very good impression. Reb Tevye, I like her. Why don't we just shake hands and call it a match, huh? And... I will be good to her. Tevye. I... I like her. Well? What do you think? - What do I think? - Huh? I never really liked him. Why should I? You can have a fine conversation with him if you talk about kidneys and livers. On the other hand, not everyone has to be a scholar. And with a butcher, my daughter will surely never know hunger. Maybe I misjudged him. He's a good man. He likes her. And he'll try to make her happy. What do I think? It's a match. - You agree? - I agree. Tevye, you've made me a happy man. - Let's drink on it. - Why not? - To you. - No, my friend. To you. - To the both of us. - To our agreement. To our prosperity. To our good health and happiness. And most important of all...

Tevye, after the marriage, - we will be related. - Yeah? You will be my papa. Your papa. Lazar Wolf, I always wanted a son. But I wanted one a little younger than myself. Good night. I hear that congratulations are in order, Tevye. Thank you, Your Honour. Thank you. Tevye. Tevye. Yes, Your Honour? I have some news I think I should tell you as a friend. Yes, Your Honour? I'm giving you this news because I like you. You're an honest, decent person, even though you are a Jew. Thank you, Your Honour. How often does a man get a compliment like that? And the news? Sometime soon this district is to have a little unofficial demonstration. What? A pogrom here? No, just a little unofficial demonstration. Little? How little? Just some mischief. So, if an inspector comes through, he can see we did our duty. I don't know why there has to be this trouble between people. But I thought I should tell you. Thank you, Your Honour. You are a good man. If I may say so... It's too bad you're not a Jew. That's what I like about you. You're always joking. Congratulations again for your daughter. Thank you, Your Honour. Oh, about the other matter. It won't be too bad. I wouldn't worry. Of course not. Dear God, did you have to send me news like that today of all days? I know we are the chosen people. But once in a while, can't you choose someone else? Anyway, thank you for sending a husband for my Tzeitel. Lechaim. Now, after Jacob had worked for Laban for seven years, do you know what happened? Laban fooled him and gave him his ugly daughter Leah. So to marry Rachel, Jacob was forced to work another seven years. So, you see, the Bible clearly teaches us you can never trust an employer. And that is what the Bible teaches us? That is the lesson of the story of Jacob if you interpret it correctly. - Is your papa up yet? - No, Mama. Enough lessons. Back to the house. There's work to be done. Go on, children. Another story tomorrow. That was a very interesting lesson, Perchik. - Do you think so? - Mmm. Although I don't know if the rabbi would agree with your interpretation. Neither, I suppose, would the rabbi's son. My little sisters talk too much. And what do you know about him, except that he is the rabbi's son? At least I know he has no strange ideas about turning the world upside down. Good day, Perchik. You have wit, even some intelligence. Perhaps, but what good is your brain? Without curiosity, it is a rusty tool. Good day, Hodel. We have an old custom here. A boy talks respectfully to a girl. But that is too traditional for an advanced thinker like you. Our traditions. Nothing must change. Everything is perfect as it is. - We like our ways. - Our ways are changing all over but here. In the city boys and girls are affectionate without the permission of a matchmaker. They hold hands together. They even dance together. New dances like this. I learned it in Kiev. - Do you like it? - It's very nice. There. We've just changed an old custom. Yes. I mean, thank you. I mean, good day. Go away. Oh! So, my prince is finally out of bed. Open your eyes. The day's half gone. Well? Well, what happened last night, besides you drinking like a peasant? Did you see Lazar Wolf? Well? Well? What did he say? What did you say? - Where's Tzeitel? - She's in the barn. Do you have news for me? Did you talk with Lazar Wolf? - What happened? - Patience, woman, patience. As the Good Book says, ""Good news will stay, and bad news will refuse to leave."" - And another saying goes... - You can die from such a man. Did you see Lazar? How was it? Are you still drunk or what? Ah, here she is. Tzeitel, my lamb. Come here. You are to be congratulated. - You are going to be married. Married! What do you mean, Papa? Lazar Wolf has asked for your hand. - I knew it. - The butcher? Dear God, I thank thee. Why do you have to? - What do you have to say, Tzeitel? - What can she say? - Let her say one word. - My first-born a bride. May you grow old with him in fortune and honour. Not like Fruma Sarah, his first wife. She was a bitter woman, may she rest in peace. Not like my Tzeitel. And now I must thank Yente. My Tzeitel a bride. A bride! I thank thee. I thank thee. Oh, a bride! Well, Chava? Mazel tov, Tzeitel. ""Mazel tov, Tzeitel."" What kind of a mazel tov is that? And you, Reb Perchik, aren't you going to congratulate her? Congratulations, Tzeitel, for getting a rich man. Ah. Again with the rich. What's wrong with being rich? It's no reason to marry. Money's the world's curse. May the Lord smite me with it. And may I never recover. World's curse. My Tzeitel knows I mean only her welfare. Am I right, Tzeitel? - Yes, Papa. - There, you see? I see. I see very well. Well, my child? Why are you so silent? Aren't you happy with this blessing, huh? Papa... Papa... What is it? Tell me. Papa, I don't want to marry him. I can't marry him. I can't. What do you mean, you can't? If I say you will, you will. If it's a matter of money, I'll do anything. I'll hire myself out as a servant... But we made an agreement. And with us, an agreement is an agreement. Is that more important than I am, Papa? Papa, don't force me, please! I'll be unhappy all my days. - I don't want to marry him. - All right. All right. I won't force you. Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you. ""Thank you, Papa."" It seems it was not ordained that you should have all the comforts of life. - Reb Tevye, may I speak to you? - Later, Motel. - But I would like to speak to you. - Not now. I have problems. That's what I want to speak to you about. I think I can help. Like a bandage can help a corpse. Goodbye, Motel. At least listen to him, Papa. All right, you have a tongue. Talk. I hear you are arranging a match for Tzeitel. Ah, he also has ears. Well... - I have a match for Tzeitel. - What kind of a match? A perfect fit. Like a glove. This match was made exactly to measure. Perfect fit? Made to measure? Stop talking like a tailor and tell me, who is it? - Please don't shout at me. - All right. All right, I won't shout. Who is it? Who is it? - Who is it? - Who is it? Who is it?! It's me. Myself. It's him. Himself. Either you're out of your mind or you're crazy. He must be crazy. Arranging a match for yourself? What are you? Everything? Bridegroom, matchmaker, and guests rolled into one? I suppose you'll perform the ceremony, too? Please don't shout at me. As for being my matchmaker, I know it's unusual. Unusual? It's crazy. Times are changing. Over a year ago, Tzeitel and I gave each other our pledge that we would marry. You gave each other a pledge? Yes, Papa. We gave each other our pledge. They gave each other a pledge? Unheard of. Absurd. ~ You gave each other a pledge - unthinkable ~ ~ Where do you think you are, in Moscow, in Paris? ~ ~ Where do they think they are, America? ~ ~ What do you think you're doing, you're a stitcher, you're nothing ~ ~ Who do you think you are, King Solomon? ~ ~ This isn't the way it's done, not here, not now ~ ~ Some things I will not, I cannot allow ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Marriages must be arranged by the papa ~ ~ This should never be changed ~ ~ One little time, you pull out a prop and where does it stop? Where does it stop? ~ Where does it stop? Do I still have something to say about my daughter? Doesn't anyone have to ask a father any more? I've wanted to ask you for a while, but first I wanted to get my own sewing machine. Stop talking nonsense. You are just a poor tailor. That's true, but even a poor tailor is entitled to some happiness. I promise you, Reb Tevye, your daughter will not starve. Ah. He's beginning to talk like a man. On the other hand, what kind of a match would that be with a poor tailor? On the other hand, he is an honest, hard worker. But on the other hand, he has absolutely nothing. On the other hand, things could never get worse for him, only better. They gave each other a pledge. Unheard of. Absurd. ~ They gave each other a pledge - unthinkable ~ ~ But look at my daughter's face, she loves him, she wants him ~ ~ And look at my daughter's eyes ~ ~ So hopeful ~ Tradition! Well, children... When shall we make the wedding? Thank you, Papa. Reb Tevye, you won't be sorry. You won't be sorry. I won't be sorry? I'm sorry already. Thank you, Papa. - Thank you, Papa. - All right, all right. Papa. They gave each other a pledge. Golde. What shall I tell Golde? - Motel, you were wonderful. - It was a miracle. ~ Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles ~ ~ God took a Daniel once again ~ ~ Stood by his side and miracle of miracles ~ ~ Walked him through the lion's den ~ ~ Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles ~ ~ I was afraid that God would frown ~ ~ But like he did so long ago in Jericho, God just made a wall fall down ~ ~ When Moses softened Pharaoh's heart, that was a miracle ~ ~ When God made the waters of the Red Sea part, that was a miracle, too ~ ~ But of all God's miracles large and small, the most miraculous one of all ~ ~ Is that out of a worthless lump of clay God has made a man today ~ ~ Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles ~ ~ God took a tailor by the hand ~ ~ Turned him around and miracle of miracles ~ ~ Led him to the Promised Land ~ ~ When David slew Goliath, yes, that was a miracle ~ ~ When God gave us manna in the wilderness, that was a miracle, too ~ ~ But of all God's miracles large and small, the most miraculous one of all ~ ~ Is the one I thought could never be ~ ~ God has given you to me ~ - Good day. - Hello, Sarah. Mazel tov, Chava. Soon it will be you. - I hope so. - Give my best wishes to Tzeitel. - Mazel tov! Mazel tov! - Goodbye. - Mazel tov, Chava. - Mazel tov, Chava. Don't run away... No, don't. Please, I just want... to get by. All right, stop it. - What's wrong with you, Fyedka? - Stop it. - We're just having a little fun, Fyedka. - Goodbye, Sasha. I said goodbye. I'm sorry about that. They mean no harm. Don't they? Is there something you want? Yes, I'd like to talk to you. I'd rather not. I've often noticed you at the bookseller's. Not many girls in this village like to read. Would you like to borrow this book? It's very good. No. - Thank you. - Why? Because I'm not Jewish? Do you feel about me the way they feel about you? I didn't think you would. And what do you know about me, eh? Let me tell you about myself. I'm a pleasant fellow. Charming, honest, ambitious, quite bright, and very modest. Go ahead. Take the book. And after you return it, I'll ask you how you like it. And we can talk about it for a while. Then we can talk about life. How we feel about things. Here. Thank you. - Good day, Chava. - Good day. Fyedka. Fyedka. - Help! Help! - Tell me, what's the matter with you? Wake up. What is the matter with you? Wake up! - Where is she? - Who? - What are you talking about? - Fruma Sarah. Lazar Wolfs first wife was standing here a minute ago. What are you talking about? Fruma Sarah has been dead for years. Sha! You must have been dreaming. Sha. Sha. Now, tell me what you dreamt and I'll tell you what it meant. Ooh, it was terrible. - Tell me. - All right. Only don't be frightened! In the beginning, I dreamt that... we were having a celebration of some kind. Everybody we knew, all of our beloved departed were there. All of them. Even your Great Uncle Mordechai was there. And your cousin Rachel was there. And in the middle of the dream, in walks your grandmother Tzeitel, may she rest in peace. Grandmother Tzeitel? How did she look? For a woman who is dead 30 years, she looked very good. Naturally, I went up to greet her. ~ A blessing on your head Mazel tov, mazel tov ~ ~ To see a daughter wed Mazel tov, mazel tov ~ ~ And such a son-in-law like no one ever saw ~ ~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~ Motel? ~ A worthy boy is he Mazel tov, mazel tov ~ ~ Of pious family Mazel tov, mazel tov ~ ~ They named him after my dear Uncle Mordechai ~ ~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~ Tailor? - She heard wrong.

Here's my wedding present if she marries Lazar Wolf! Evil spirit, away. Such an evil spirit. May it sink back into the earth. Such a dark and horrible dream. And to think it was brought on because you went to see that butcher. Tevye... If my grandmother Tzeitel, may she rest in peace, took the trouble to come from the other world to tell us about the tailor, all I can say is that it's for the best and couldn't possibly be any better. - But, Golde... - Amen. Amen. Cu-cu-cooo! Do you like these troublemakers? These Christ-killers? Of course not. I just meant that things have been peaceful here. I have other villages to visit. If you don't want to follow orders, we shall get someone else who will. Oh, no, no, no, no, sir. I'll take care of it. Of course. Quiet down. Quiet down.

Friends, we are gathered here to share in the joys of the newlyweds, Motel and Tzeitel. May they live together to a ripe old age. - Amen. Amen. - And now I want to say... - Ni, ni, ni, ni, ni... Reb Nachum... Please not here. I'd like to announce the bride's parents are giving the newlyweds the following: A new feather bed, two pillows. Goose pillows. A Sabbath tablecloth. And a pair of candlesticks. Quiet! Now, we are just here on earth for a short visit. Even the great and wealthy must die. In fact, if the rich could hire others to die for them, we, the poor, would all make a nice living. Well put. Well put. Lazar Wolf, talking about the rich, there sits our good friend Lazar Wolf. Lazar has everything in the world, except a bride. But Lazar has no ill feelings. In fact, he told me he has a gift for the newlyweds that he wants to announce. Come on. Come on! Just like he said, I have no ill feelings. What's done is done. I am giving the newlyweds five chickens. One for each of the first five Sabbaths of their wedded life. Reb Lazar Wolf, you are a decent man. On behalf of my daughter and her new husband, I accept your gift. There is a famous saying... Reb Tevye, I'm not marrying your daughter. I don't have to listen to your sayings. If you would only listen... Why should I listen to you? A man who breaks an agreement. - I have a right to talk. - What right? It's not your wedding. - It should have been. - It's not, thank goodness. Sit down. He shamed me in front of the whole village. Sha! Rabbi, say something. I say... I say, let's sit down. Yes, yes. We all heard the words of the rabbi. Let's sit down. Now I'm going to sing a little song. ~ Dai-dai dai deedle deedle dai-dai ~ I don't want your apple. Leave me alone. You can keep your diseased chickens. You leave my chickens out of this. - We made a bargain. - The terms weren't settled. - We drank on it. - Terms weren't settled. You just sit down, all right? Once a butcher, always a butcher. - Once a liar, always a liar. - Sit down, all right? Those happen to be my chickens... - I had a sign. - Quiet, I'm singing. Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! What's all the screaming about? They drank on it. An agreement. A sign. It's all nonsense. Tzeitel wanted to marry Motel and not Lazar. A young girl decides for herself? Why not? They love each other. - Love? - He's a radical. Musicians, play. It's a dance. Everybody, dance. - It's a wedding. Some wedding - What is he doing? - Perchik! Who will dance with me? - That's a sin. - It's no sin to dance. - With a girl? - Yes! That's what comes from taking a wild man into your house. He's not a wild man. His ideas are a bit different, but... Perchik, come here. - It's a sin. - It's no sin! Ask the rabbi. Go on, ask him. Well, Rabbi? Dancing? Well, it's not exactly forbidden. There you see. It's not forbidden. And it's no sin. Now... Who will dance with me? - Hodel! - It's only a dance, Mama. Play. - She's dancing with a man. - I can see that she's dancing with a man. - And I'm going to dance with my wife! - Tevye! - Mama, no. - Golde. Golde! Golde! - No, I will not. - Tzeitel! Motel! You see that? You are responsible for that. - And I can't stand it. - I tried my best. Everybody dance. Come on. Dance, Rabbi, dance! Hey! Go on! Perchik! Perchik! All right! Enough! I said, enough! Come! Orders are orders. You understand? Well... Why are you all standing around? Clean up. Clean up! ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition! ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ Tradition! ~ Troubles, troubles. That's all you hear from me, right? But who else can we simple people take our troubles to? You know, sometimes I wonder, who do you take your troubles to? Ah, go away. Anyway, Motel and Tzeitel have been married for some time now. They work very hard. And they're as poor as squirrels in winter. But they're so happy, they don't know how miserable they are. Motel keeps talking about a sewing machine. I know. You are very busy now. Wars, revolutions, floods, plagues. All those little things that bring people back to you. But couldn't you take a second and get him his sewing machine? Yeah, and while you are in the neighbourhood... As you can see, my horse's leg... Am I bothering you too much? I'm sorry. As the Good Book says... Why should I tell you what the Good Book says?! So you must go away? Yes. So soon? Yes. Tomorrow morning. Alone? No, with a few friends. And we will be joining others. - Where? - In the city, Kiev. Hodel, there are some things I cannot tell even you. I see. - Please don't be upset. - If you must leave, you must. - I do have to. - So you told me. Great changes are about to take place. Tremendous changes. But they can't happen by themselves. - So you feel that you, personally, must... - Not only me. Many people. Jews, Gentiles, many people hate what's going on. Don't you understand? I understand, of course. You want to leave. Then, goodbye. Hodel, listen to me. I have work to do. The greatest work a man can do. Don't you understand? Yes, Perchik. Hodel... Hodel! Hodel, wait. Hodel, there's a certain question I wish to discuss with you. - Yes? - It's a political question. - What is it? - The question of... marriage. Is this a political question? Well, yes. Everything's political. The relationship between a man and a woman has a socioeconomic base. Marriage must be founded on mutual beliefs. A common attitude and philosophy towards society... And affection? Yes, of course. That is also necessary. Such a relationship can have positive social values. When two people face the world with unity and solidarity... - And affection? - Yes, that is an important element. At any rate, I... I personally am in favour of such a socioeconomic relationship. I think... you are asking me to marry you. Well, in a theoretical sense, yes, I am. I was hoping you were. I am very happy, Hodel. I'm very, very happy. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Reb Tevye. - I have some bad news. - What? - I must leave here. - When? - Tomorrow morning. - I'm sorry to hear that, Perchik. - We'll all miss you. - But I also have some good news. - Good. - You can congratulate me. - Congratulations. What for? - We are engaged. - Engaged? - Yes, Papa, we're engaged. Oh, no, you're not. I know you like him and he likes you. But you're going away and you're staying here. So have a nice trip, and I hope you'll be very happy and my answer is no. - Papa, you don't understand. - I understand. I gave my permission to Motel and Tzeitel, so you feel you also have a right. I'm sorry, Perchik, I like you. But you're going away, so go in good health, and my answer is still no. - You don't understand, Papa. - And you are not listening. I said no. Reb Tevye, we are not asking for your permission. Only for your blessing. We are going to get married. You are not asking for my permission? But we would like your blessing, Papa. I can't believe my own ears. My blessing? For what? ~ For going over my head - impossible ~ ~ At least with Tzeitel and Motel they asked me, they begged me ~ ~ But now, if I like or not, you'll marry him ~ ~ What do you want from me - go on, be wed ~ ~ And tear out my beard and uncover my head ~ ~ Tradition ~ ~ They're not even asking permission from the papa ~ ~ What's happening to the tradition? ~ ~ One little time, I pulled out a thread and where has it led? Where has it led? ~ Where has it led? To this. A man tells me he's getting married. He doesn't ask me, he tells me. But first, he abandons you. He's not abandoning me, Papa. As soon as I can, I will send for her and marry her. I love her. He loves her. Love. It's a new style. On the other hand, our old ways were once new, weren't they? On the other hand, they decided without parents, without the matchmaker. On the other hand, did Adam and Eve have a matchmaker? Oh, yes, they did. And it seems these two have the same matchmaker. They're going over my head. Unheard of. Absurd. ~ For this, they want to be blessed - unthinkable ~ I'll lock her up in her room. I couldn't. I should. ~ But look at my daughter's eyes ~ ~ She loves him ~ Tradition! Well, children, I've decided to give you my blessing and my permission. Oh, thank you, Papa. What else could I do? Thank you, Papa. ""Thank you, Papa""? What am I going to tell your mother? Another dream? Perhaps if you tell her I am going to visit a rich uncle. Perchik, please. I can handle my own wife. Golde! Golde! - Gol... - Hm? - Hello, Golde. - Have some soup. Golde... I have something very important to tell you. Have the soup. It's warm. Golde. I've just met Perchik and Hodel. - Well? - Well... Well, uh... Well, they seem to be very fond of each other. So? What do you mean? So... So, I've decided to give them my permission to become engaged. - I'll eat later. - What? Just like that, without even asking me? Who asks you? - I am the father. - Who is he? A pauper. He has nothing, absolutely nothing. I wouldn't say that. I hear he has a rich uncle. A rich uncle. Golde... Golde, he's a good man. I like him. He's a little crazy, but I like him. And what's more important, Hodel likes him. Hodel loves him. So what can we do? It's a new world, Golde. A new world. Love. Golde, do you love me? - Do I what? - Shh. ~ Do you love me? ~ ~ Do I love you? ~ Well? ~ With our daughters getting married and this trouble in the town ~ ~ You're upset, you're worn out, go inside, go lie down ~ - Maybe it's indigestion. - No, Golde, I'm asking you a question. ~ Do you love me? ~ - You're a fool. - I know. ~ But do you love me? ~ ~ Do I love you? Well? ~ ~ For 25 years, I've washed your clothes ~ ~ Cooked your meals, cleaned your house ~ ~ Given you children, milked your cow ~ ~ After 25 years, why talk about love right now? ~ Golde. ~ The first time I met you was on our wedding day ~ ~ I was scared I was shy ~ ~ I was nervous So was I ~ ~ But my father and my mother said we'd learn to love each other ~ ~ And now I'm asking, Golde ~ ~ Do you love me? ~ - I'm your wife. - I know. ~ But do you love me? ~ ~ Do I love him? ~ Well? ~ For 25 years, I've lived with him ~ ~ Fought with him, starved with him ~ ~ 25 years, my bed is his ~ Shh! ~ If that's not love, what is? ~ ~ Then you love me? ~ I suppose I do. ~ And I suppose I love you, too ~ ~ It doesn't change a thing ~ ~ But even so ~ ~ After 25 years ~ ~ It's nice to know ~ Halt! There is no authority above the will of the people. And we are the people. We are Russia! The time has come, and the time is now. We stand here before you. Not one, but many. Many like you. Students, workers striving for a better life. And I urge you, fellow workers, to band together with us. Join our movement, in the factories. In the schools. In the army. The winds of freedom are beginning to blow all over Russia. Halt! Wait! Wait! Stand! Good day to you, Esther. Just a minute. Tzeitel. Tzeitel. - Good day, Yente. - Tzeitel. I happened to stop in the post office today, to say hello, see what's what. It doesn't cost anything to be friendly. So few people are like that. - Ni, ni. - People. I tell you, if God lived on earth, people would break his windows. - So you went to the post office. - Yes, and the postman told me there was a letter for your sister Hodel. - Thanks, I'll go get it. - I got it. It's from her intended - Perchik. Hodel will be so happy. She's been waiting to hear from him... - But it's open. - So it happened to be open. You don't have to wait for the train, Papa. You'll be late for customers. It's all right. They'll just have to wait for a while. Is he in bad trouble, that hero of yours? Arrested? - Convicted? - Yes. But he did nothing wrong. He cares nothing for himself. Everything he does is for other people. Yes, but if he did nothing wrong, he wouldn't be in trouble. Papa, how can you say that? What wrongs did Joseph do, and Abraham, and Moses? And they had troubles. Yes, but... Why won't you tell me where he is now, this Joseph of yours? It is far, Papa. Terribly far. He is in a settlement in Siberia. Siberia? And he asks you to leave your father and mother and join him in that frozen wasteland and marry him there? No, Papa. He did not ask me to go. I want to go. I don't want him to be alone. I want to help him in his work. - Hodel. - Papa. ~ How can I hope to make you understand? ~ ~ Why I do what I do ~ ~ Why I must travel to a distant land ~ ~ Far from the home I love ~ ~ Once I was happily content to be ~ ~ As I was, where I was ~ ~ Close to the people who are close to me ~ ~ Here in the home I love ~ ~ Who could see that a man would come ~ ~ Who would change the shape of my dreams? ~ ~ Helpless now I stand with him ~ ~ Watching older dreams grow dim ~ ~ Oh, what a melancholy choice this is ~ ~ Wanting home, wanting him ~ ~ Closing my heart to every hope but his ~ ~ Leaving the home I love ~ ~ There where my heart has settled long ago ~ ~ I must go ~ ~ I must go ~ ~ Who could imagine I'd be wandering so ~ ~ Far from the home I love ~ ~ Yet there with my love ~ ~ I'm home ~ And who, my child, will there be to perform a marriage in the wilderness? Papa, I promise you, we will be married under a canopy. Yes. Yes. No doubt a rabbi or two were also arrested. Papa! God alone knows when we shall see each other again. Then we will leave it in his hands. Take care of her. See that she dresses warm. Even though she only burned his cooking, he is permitted to divorce her. Just for supper? I'm sorry, Rabbi. Yes, of course. What news of the outside world? - Terrible, Rabbi. - Then don't tell me. If I want bad news, I'll read about Noah and the flood. Tell me, Avram, surely somewhere there are good things happening? Can't you buy a paper that prints those things? It's not my fault, Rabbi. I only read it. Rabbi, did you hear the news? - More bad news? - No, good news. At Motel's and Tzeitel's, a new arrival. A new arrival at Motel and Tzeitel's! We just heard the good news. Mazel tov. Thank you very much. It's a nice thing. Very nice. - What is it? - It's a sewing machine. You can work twice as fast. - You got it. - I got it. - It's beautiful. - I know. - Have you tried it yet? - Look. - Beautiful. - I know. And in less than a minute. See how close and even the stitches are. - It's beautiful. - I know. From now on, my clothes will be perfect. Made by machine. No more handmade clothes. - Look, Mama. Look. - Oh. It's wonderful. Mazel tov, Motel. - The rabbi. The rabbi. - Shh. Shh. Rabbi, is there a blessing for a sewing machine? There is a blessing for everything. That's your new arrival? What is it, a boy or a girl? Well put. Well put. Yankela. Yankela. Why isn't he asleep? But he's wonderful. He never cries or anything... Sha! Do you want to invite bad luck? Aaah! Well... Well, Motel. I never thought you'd amount to anything. But look at you. A baby and a sewing machine. You're a person. - Look, I'll show you how it works. Go, children. First, you put the cloth in like this. It's an amazing thing. You work it with your foot and your hand. Your father is coming. Chava, let me tell him about us. That would be the worst thing. - But let me try. - No. I'll talk to him, I promise. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. It's a cold day, isn't it? Mm. Well, uh... Good day, sir. - Good day, Chava. - Good day. What were you and he talking about? Nothing. We were just talking. Good. Papa. Fyedka and I, we've known each other for a long time now, and... Chaveleh, I would be much happier if you would remain friends from a distance. You must not forget who you are and who that man is. - He has a name, Papa. - Of course. All creatures on earth have a name. Fyedka is not a creature. Fyedka is a man. Who says he isn't? It's just that he's a different kind of man. As the Good Book says, ""Each shall seek his own kind."" In other words, a bird may love a fish, but where would they build a home together? - The world is changing. - No, Chaveleh. No. Some things do not change for us. Some things will never change. We don't feel that way. We? Fyedka and I. We want to be married. What? Are you out of your mind? What? Don't you understand what that means, marrying outside of the faith? - But, Papa. - No! I said no! Never talk about it again. Never mention his name again. Never see him again. Never. Do you understand me? Yes, Papa. I understand you. You're finally here. It's late for supper. - I want to see Motel's new machine. - You'll see it another time. Quiet, woman, because when I get angry, even flies don't dare to fly! I'm very frightened of you. After we finish supper, I'll faint. Golde, I am the man in the house. I am the head of the family. And I want to see Motel's new machine now! Now let's go home. What are you doing here? What do you want? May I see His Honour, the priest? - The Reverend Father? - Yes. Why do you want to see him? It's a family matter. A personal matter. - My daughter. - Yes? What about your daughter? Please, if I could speak with the p... If I could speak with the Reverend Father. Please? Wait here. Tevye! Tevye! What is it? It's Chava. She left home this morning with Fyedka. - What? - I looked everywhere for her. I even went to the priest. He told me they were married. Married? Yes. Well... Go home, Golde. We have other children at home. You have work to do, I have work to do. - Go home. - But Chaveleh... Chava is dead to us. We'll forget her. Go home. Go home, Golde. Oh... ~ Little bird, little Chaveleh ~ ~ I don't understand what's happening today ~ ~ Everything is all a blur ~ ~ All I can see is a happy child ~ ~ The sweet little bird you were, Chaveleh ~ ~ Chaveleh ~ ~ Little bird, little Chaveleh ~ ~ You were always such a pretty little thing ~ ~ Everybody's favourite child ~ ~ Gentle and kind and affectionate ~ ~ What a sweet little bird you were, Chaveleh ~ ~ Chaveleh ~ Papa. Papa! Papa, I've been looking everywhere for you. Papa, stop! At least listen to me. Papa... I beg you to accept us. Accept them? How can I accept them? Can I deny everything I believe in? On the other hand, can I deny my own daughter? On the other hand, how can I turn my back on my faith, my people? If I try and bend that far, I'll break. On the other hand... No, there is no other hand. - No, Chava! No! - But, Papa! - No! No! - Papa! Papa! Golde, here they are. The boys I told you about. Wonderful boys from good families. Each of them a prize, a jewel. You couldn't do better for your girls. I don't know, Yente. My girls are still so young. So what do they look like, grandfathers? True, the marriage can wait, but meanwhile, their future will be all signed and sealed. Which one for which one? What's the difference? Take your pick. They're both wonderful boys. Yankel, the fat one, is apprenticed to a carpenter. - I am Yankel. - Did I ask you? Yankel, the skinny one, is... - Mama, is Reb Tevye in the house? - He's in the barn. Is there trouble? Stay inside, children. What's the matter? Tevye, have you seen the constable lately? - No. Why? - There are some rumours in town. We thought, since you knew him so well, maybe he told you what is true and what is not. Rumours? What rumours? Quiet! Talk, Avram. Someone from Zolodin told me an edict issued in St Petersburg... Welcome, Your Honour. What's the good news in the world? I see that you have company. They are my friends. It's just as well. What I have to say is for their ears also. How much time do you need to sell your house and household goods? Why should I sell my house? Is it in anybody's way? I came to tell you you have to leave Anatevka. How did I come to deserve such an honour? Not just you, of course, but all of you. At first, I thought you might be spared because of your daughter's marriage. My daughter is dead. I understand. At any rate, it affects all of you. You have to leave. But this corner of the world has always been our home. - Why should we leave? - I don't know why. There's trouble in the world. Troublemakers. - Like us? - You aren't the only ones. Your people must leave all the villages - Zolodin, Rabalevka. The entire district must be emptied. I have an order here! It says that you must sell your homes and be out of here in three days. And you? You, who have known us all your life, you'd carry out this order? I've nothing to do with it. Don't you understand? I wish you wouldn't say me. - I understand. - Suppose we refuse to go? - You will be forced out. - We will defend ourselves. - We'll stay in our homes. - We will keep our land and fight. Against our militia, our army? I wouldn't advise that. I have some advice for you. Get off my land. This is still my home, my land. Get off my land. You have three days. After a lifetime, a piece of paper, and get thee out. We should unite with the people of Zolodin. - Maybe they have a plan. - We should defend ourselves. - An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. - Very good That way the whole world will be blind and toothless. Rabbi, we've been waiting for the Messiah all our lives. Wouldn't this be a good time for him to come? We'll have to wait for him someplace else. Meanwhile, let's start packing. Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly been the Garden of Eden. That's true. After all, what have we got here? ~ A little bit of this, a little bit of that ~ ~ A pot A pan ~ ~ A broom A hat ~ ~ Someone should have set a match to this place years ago ~ ~ A bench A tree ~ ~ What's a house? Or a stove? ~ People who pass through Anatevka don't even know they've been here. ~ A stick of wood A piece of cloth ~ ~ What do we leave? ~ ~ Nothing much ~ ~ Only Anatevka ~ ~ Anatevka ~ ~ Anatevka ~ ~ Underfed, overworked Anatevka ~ ~ Where else would Sabbath be so sweet? ~ ~ Anatevka ~ ~ Anatevka ~ ~ Intimate, obstinate Anatevka ~ ~ Where I know everyone I meet ~ ~ Soon I'll be a stranger in a strange new place ~ ~ Searching for an old familiar face ~ ~ From Anatevka ~ ~ I belong to Anatevka ~ ~ Tumbledown, workaday Anatevka ~ ~ Dear little village ~ ~ Little town of mine ~ It's just a place. Our forefathers have been forced out of many, many places at a moment's notice. Maybe that's why we always wear our hats. Golde! Golde, darling. I had to see you before I left because I have such news for you. Remember, yesterday I didn't know where to go, what to do with these old bones. Now I know. You want to hear? I'll tell you. All my life, I've dreamed of going to one place. Guess where? Nah, you'll never guess. Every year at Passover, what do we say? Next year in Jerusalem. Next year in the Holy Land. - You're going to the Holy Land? - You guessed. Goodbye, Yente. Be well and go in peace. And so, goodbye, Golde. Sometime, maybe we'll meet on a happier occasion. Meanwhile, we suffer. Oh, we suffer. We suffer in silence, right? Of course, right. Where are you going? You don't know where you're going? - Come, Golde, we have to leave. - Leave. It sounds so easy. Golde, we'll all be together soon. Motel, Tzeitel and the baby, they'll come too, you'll see. This Motel is a person. And Hodel and Perchik? When will we ever see them again? Do they come visiting us from Siberia every Sabbath? You know what she writes. He sits in prison, she works. But soon he'll be set free and together they'll turn the world upside down. She couldn't be happier, and the other children will be with us. Not all. All. Come, Golde. I have to clean up, sweep the floor. - Sweep the floor? - I don't want to leave a dirty house. Tevye. Tevye, I am on my way. Where are you going? Chicago, in America. Chicago, America? We are going to New York, America. We'll be neighbours. My wife, Fruma Sarah, has a brother there. - That's nice. - I hate him! But a relative is a relative. - Goodbye, Tevye. - Goodbye, Lazar Wolf. Well, my old friends, it's time to say goodbye. The farmer Bushenko will be coming for you later. He's not a bad sort. If you are good to him, he'll be good to you. Take care of your leg, huh? Thanks for everything. Chava! - Papa will see you. - I want him to. I want to say goodbye to him. - He won't listen to you. - But at least he will hear. Maybe it would be better if I told Mama. Chaveleh! Papa. Papa. We came to say goodbye. We are also leaving this place. We are going to Cracow. We cannot stay among people who can do such things to others. We wanted you to know that. Some are driven away by edicts, others by silence. Goodbye, Papa. Mama. Come, Chava. Goodbye, Chava... Fyedka. And God be with you. - And God be with you. - We will write to you in America. We will be staying with Uncle Avram! Yes, Mama. ""We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?"" ""We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?"" The whole world has to know our business. Stop yelling and finish packing. We have a long way to go. Golde, I don't need your advice. Tzeitel, don't forget the baby. Goodbye, Papa. Work hard, Motel, and come to us soon. I will, Papa. I'll work hard. All right, children. Let's go. Visiontext Subtitles: Natasha Cohn, Where is he? I shan't ask you politely next time. Where is Blofeld? Cai... Cai... Cairo! Cards. Hit me. One chance. Where can I find him? Marie... Ask Marie. Who are you? My name is Bond. James Bond. Is there something I can do for you? Yes, as a matter of fact, there is. There is something I'd like you to get off your chest. Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld? Speak up, darling. I can't hear you. We now come to phase four: The nose. In my opinion, the most difficult part of a plastic transformation. I want the operation done tonight. - But, seor... - There's no time left. But, Seor Blofeld, this is a most delicate procedure. Tonight! Keep the temperature at precisely 80 degrees. Making mud pies, 007? He would have been me in a matter of days if you'd given the poor fellow a chance. Such a pity. I was dying to see how the operation turned out. Get his gun. Hold it! Get your hands up. Kill him! Welcome to hell, Blofeld. Star of South Africa. 83.5 carats rough. 47.5 carats cut. The Akbar Shah. 116 carats rough. Are you paying attention, 007? The Akbar Shah, 116 carats rough. But surely, sir, there's no need to bring in our section on a relatively simple smuggling matter. Sir Donald has convinced the PM otherwise. May I remind you, 007, that Blofeld's dead. Finished! The least we can expect from you now is a little plain, solid work. Good morning, gentlemen. - Sir Donald will see you now. - Thank you. Good morning, Sir Donald. - This is Commander Bond. - How do you do? Please sit down. - Sherry? - Not for me, thanks. Doctor's orders. - Commander Bond? - Yes, thank you. You've been on holiday, I understand. Relaxing, I hope. Hardly relaxing but... most satisfying. Cheers. Pity about your liver, sir. It's an unusually fine Solera. - '51, I believe. - There is no year for sherry, 007. I was referring to the original vintage on which the sherry is based, sir. Unmistakable. Precisely. Tell me, Commander. How far does your expertise extend into the field of diamonds? Hardest substance found in nature. They cut glass. Suggest marriage. They've replaced a dog as a girl's best friend. That's about it. Refreshing to hear there's one subject you're not an expert on. Perhaps I'd better give you a brief background into our problem. Eighty per cent of the world's diamonds come from mines in South Africa. Most are dug out of shafts of diamond-bearing clay at depths of up to 3,000 feet. The whole process, from start to finish, is subject to an airtight security system. It's an essential precaution, though the industry prides itself on the loyalty and devotion of its workers. Naturally the security measures tend to ensure that loyalty, as do the extensive amenities and social services we provide. There's a permanent staff of doctors, nurses, even dentists. The whole process, from start to finish, is subject to an airtight security system. It's a necessary precaution, though the industry prides itself on the loyalty and devotion of its workers. Next! The scorpion. Mother nature's finest killer, Mr. Wint. One is never too old to learn from a master, Mr. Kidd. Dr. Tynan? Good evening. Who are you? And where is Joe? Joe couldn't make it tonight. I'm Mr. Wint. This is Mr. Kidd. I see. What's the matter with him? It's my wisdom teeth. I haven't had 'em out yet. Would you mind having a look, Doctor? Of course. I'm not going to hurt you. Just open. No, no. Open wide. Curious how everyone who touches those diamonds seems to... die. - Stop right there! Who are you? - Dr. Tynan sent us. - Why didn't he come himself? - He was taken sick. Bitten by the bug. He sent this for you. If God had wanted man to fly... He would have given him wings, Mr. Kidd. No security system is perfect. We've always accepted a percentage of smuggling. But over the past two years, despite all our precautions, it's gone up alarmingly. And none of the stones have reached the market. Sir Donald thinks someone's stockpiling. Our concern is that someone might dump them on the market to depress prices or... Make you agree to perpetual blackmail. Exactly. What we need to know is who the stockpilers are. The letter U is for umbrella. We take it lest it rain. We hope we shan't want it till we're home again. Two men to see you, missy. Gentlemen, Joshua. I shan't be long, children. Joshua is going to read you a story. How nice to see you again! - Where to this time? - Amsterdam. Amsterdam! Oh, how lovely! I shall have to bring back some pictures of the canals for the children. Ask, and ye shall receive, Mrs. Whistler. Thus endeth the lesson for today, gentlemen. Several recent murders in South Africa have complicated matters. If they shut down operations before we discover them... It would be catastrophic for us and for the government. - I've always fancied a trip to South Africa. - You're going to Holland. For some time we've had our eyes on a smuggler - Peter Franks. He's due to leave for Amsterdam. Do we know who his contacts are? We do function in your absence, Commander. Passport, sir? Mr. Franks. There's a message for you at Passport Control. That door over there. You can park outside. Thank you. Mr. Franks... Your passport is quite in order. Anyone seeing you in that outfit, Moneypenny, would certainly be discouraged from leaving the country. What can I bring you back from Holland? A diamond? In a ring? Would you settle for a tulip? Yes. Ahead is one of the oldest bridges in Amsterdam. The Skinny Bridge. It was built over 300 years ago by two sisters who wanted to visit each other every day. Unfortunately they ran out of money. So that is why it is called the Skinny Bridge. On your right, those beautiful old houses can be seen in the paintings of our famous painter, Rembrandt. And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will look to your left as we go down the Amstel, you can see... Mrs. Whistler did want some pictures of the canals for the children. How kind of you, Mr. Kidd. The children will be so thrilled. Yes? Franks. Peter Franks. Come up. Third floor. Make yourself at home! I'll be out in a minute! Help yourself to a drink! Is Mr. Case not at home? There is no Mr. Case. The T is for Tiffany. Tiffany Case? Definitely distinctive. I was born there, on the first floor, while my mother was looking for a wedding ring. I'm glad for your sake it wasn't Van Cleef and Arpels. Weren't you a blonde when I came in? Could be. I tend to notice little things like that. Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette. And which do you prefer? Providing the collars and cuffs match... We'll talk about that later. Let me have your glass. I'll get you some ice. That's quite a nice little nothing you're almost wearing. I approve. I don't dress for the hired help. Let's see your passport, Franks. Occupation: Transport consultant? That's a little cute, isn't it? - I'll finish dressing. - Please don't. Not on my account. I don't care much for redheads. Terrible tempers. But somehow it seems to suit you. It's my own. But it is in need of some soft lighting. - I know a little restaurant... - I never mix business with pleasure. - Neither do I. - Good! Then save the cute remarks until after you get the diamonds into Los Angeles. - Where are they now? - That's not your problem. Your problem is getting them in. - How much is there? - 50,000 carats. At 142 carats an ounce, that's an awful lot of ice. That won't be easy. That's why you're being paid 50 grand. What did you think it was going to be? A pair of earrings? And, Franks, for God's sakes, come up with something original. I've got to hand it to you, Q. Quite ingenious. An obvious little notion. Thought it might come in handy. M's been trying to get in touch with you. That Peter Franks fellow's escaped. Killed one of the guards on the way up to London. Hello? Hello! Are you there? - Yes? - Peter Franks. Third floor. - Guten Abend. - Good evening. Bitte. - You are English? - Yes, I'm English. I speak English. - Who is... your floor? - Three, please. Is he dead? I sincerely hope so. - Who is he? - No idea. This chap's been following me all day today. My God! You've just killed James Bond! Is that who it was? It just proves no one's indestructible. You don't kill James Bond and wait around for the cops to arrive! We've got to get those diamonds out of here fast! Where are they? A little old lady dropped them by yesterday morning. Priceless. I think we ought to let Mr. Bond carry the load from here on out. It's funny. All the things one wanted to say to one's brother... when it's all too late. Let me assure you of our deepest condolences. Would you please board the aircraft? - We were inseparable, you know. - Please, Mr. Franks. Lufthansa announce the departure of flight LH450 to Los Angeles. Please fasten your seat belts, and no smoking until airborne. Thank you. They're both aboard. I must say, Miss Case seems quite attractive. For a lady. Lufthansa announce the arrival of flight LH450 from Amsterdam... - Mr. Franks? - Yes. Follow me to Customs, please. Peter Franks, Jerry. Get some lunch, Jerry. I'll take over. Death certificate, please, Mr. Franks. Well, well, well! Felix Leiter, you old fraud. On behalf of the CIA, welcome to America. Someone sent their brain trust down to meet you. I give up. I know the diamonds are in the body, but where? Alimentary, Dr. Leiter. So long, James. Keep in touch. The rest of your luggage has been cleared, Mr. Franks. OK, fellas! You wanna sit in the front, Mr. Franks? It's a lot smoother ride in the front, Mr. Franks. Yes, I believe I'll sit in front. The stiff - deceased back there. Your brother, Mr. Franks? Yes, it was. I got a brudder. Small world. Mr. Franks, I'm Morton Slumber. Please accept my heartfelt condolences at this most difficult hour. He is heading for a better world, Mr. Slumber. There is some consolation in that. Now then, if we're ready to begin the final journey... May his soul rest in peace. Oh, yes. Amen. If you'd come into my comfortable office, we will bring you the urn. I'm so happy you chose our half-couch, hinged-panel, slumber-on casket. I'm sure your brother would have appreciated it. I'm sure he did. Please, be seated. Ashes to ashes... - Dust to dust. - Exactly. At a moment like this, I'm sure you'd rather be left alone, for reflection. Most thoughtful. We've selected a private niche for your brother in our Garden of Remembrance. The one with the restful chartreuse curtains and Angel's Breath gold trim. I hope you'll find everything in order. The arrangements have been impeccable so far. Very... moving. Heart-warming, Mr. Wint. A glowing tribute, Mr. Kidd. You dirty, double-crossin' limey fink! Those goddamn diamonds are phonies! No, don't tell me. You're St. Peter? Paste! Glass! Where's the real stuff, Franks? Where's the real money? You wouldn't burn 50,000 real dollars, would you? One last break. Where are the real diamonds? You get me the real money and I'll bring you the real diamonds. Where do you think you're goin'? I hear that the Hotel Tropicana is quite comfortable. My condolences, gentlemen. Hello, Felix. Very comfortable. But there's one problem. I want the real merchandise - rather quickly. Q has just arrived with it. We'll be up with them in the morning. So I'd sit tight if I were you. There's no sense in looking for trouble. Just enjoy yourself, James. I'm sure you know how. Quite. I'll probably take in a show. How do you like me so far? People say I have the body of Rock Hudson. If he ever finds out what I'm doin' to it, he'll be madder than hell. I call these girls my Acorns. Actually, they're a gift from Willard Whyte, who is upstairs right now playing Monopoly with real buildings. Tryin' to find Willard Whyte is like tryin' to find a virgin in a maternity ward. On behalf of the Whyte House, I wanna let you folks know you've been a lousy audience. So get lost. See ya later. Shady Tree! - Shady, we just adored your act! - What taste, style! And we have a few suggestions. Critics and material I don't need! I haven't changed my act in 40 years. Hold it! Don't go in there. We didn't get the real diamonds, so we need Tree - alive. That's most annoying. - Get down there! - Crap. Boxcar, the loser. That's it, pussycat. I shot the whole wad. What do you say? Back to my place? You're a nice person, Maxie. Really, you are. Why don't you go and take a nap? And I'll see you next year. May I have $5,000? No, make it $10,000. $2,000 limit. Is there some problem? Mr. Saxby. Gentleman wants $10,000 credit with a $2,000 limit. My name is Franks. Peter Franks. Mr. Franks' credit's good. - Good luck to you, Mr. Franks. - Thank you. I'll have two stacks now. Give the gentleman 4,000. Thank you. Hi! I'm Plenty. - But of course you are. - Plenty O'Toole. Named after your father, perhaps? Would you like some help? On the craps, I mean. That's very kind of you. Coming out. Coming out. Next shooter is a lady. Ladies are lucky. For the lady. Nine. Mark nine. Seven, loser. The lucky lady craps out. New shooter. Your shot, Mr. F. - Willard Whyte speakin'. - Tree is dead. Turn on number two. It's Peter Franks. Hard ten. Ten's the number. I'll take the full odds on the ten. 200 on the hard way. The limit on all the numbers, 250 on the eleven. Thank you very much. Say! You've played this game before! Just once. - Now what do we do? - Don't bother me with details, Bert! Just get me the diamonds! You handle those cubes like a monkey handles coconuts. Thank you, gentlemen, for such a sterling service. That's 50,000 dollars! Minus $5,000 for you... leaves me $45,000, and thank you very much. It was nothing, really! You know something, Peter Franks? You're a terrific guy! A little weird, but a terrific guy! Why don't we go someplace and have a drink? A drink? If you'd like to come in, Plenty. How pretty! What a super place you have! Just give me one second, lover. Good evening. I'm afraid you've caught me with more than my hands up. What the hell is this?! A perverts' convention or something?! You can't do this to me! Stop that! I've got friends in this town! Exceptionally fine shot. I didn't know there was a pool down there. Let's get down to business. I presume you've come for the real... The real diamonds. Good evening, Miss Case. Sorry about your fulsome friend. I'll bet you really missed something. The evening may not be a total loss after all. Why don't we talk a bit first? First? What would you like to talk about? You pick a subject. - Diamonds? - Good boy! And you want to know where they are, and whether I'm working alone or not. So far, so good. Keep going. And if not, then with whom. So you can inform your superiors and... acquire the diamonds. Peter! I'm very impressed. There's a lot more to you than I had expected. Presumably I'm the condemned man, and obviously you're the hearty breakfast. Right? You're not going to tell me where the diamonds are, are you? What diamonds? Sooner or later you'll have to talk. They'll make you. At the very least, you'll never get out of town alive. I can solve that little problem. It's lucky for me that I ran into you. Fifty-fifty split. You get the diamonds, I get us out. Us? I can't very well help you and then stick around. We could be on a plane and out of the country by tomorrow night. Rio... Hong Kong... I know a good tailor in Hong Kong. Hong Kong. All right. I'll get the diamonds, you get the plane tickets. No. The airport's too obvious. A rented car should do us fine for openers. That's good thinking. And since you're the one being watched, I'll get the diamonds, you get the car. That's very good thinking. Oh, Peter! I have a feeling this is the beginning of a wonderful relationship. Darling... Where do I pick up the diamonds? When was the last time you visited a circus? Circus Circus proudly presents the Flying Palacios! - She's in the building. - Right. Stand by. James, next time, pick a contact point when you're standing up. - Felix, if she gives your men the slip... - Relax. I have 30 agents down there. A mouse with sneakers on couldn't get through. Give Maxwell his cue. This is Quarterback. Operation Passover, commence. Quarterback to Tight End. Operation Passover, commence. Roger. She's on her way. So far, so good. - Good luck, Felix. I'll see you later. - Where are you going? The car rental agency. Our little rendezvous? You don't actually think she'll show up? That's a thousand-to-one shot. No, more like even money. Her devotion to larceny versus my... incomparable charm. All right, kiddies! Ready? Aim! Fire! What did I tell you? Didn't I promise you a winner every time? There you are, young man. Boys and girls, here we go again. All you have to do is just take your gun... Here we have a little lady, here we have a little man, and here we have a big lady. You're a little out of your league, aren't ya, sister? Point the gun. You know what to do. All ready? Get set. Now hold it till I say go. Go! Come on! That's it! Everybody point right at the clown. A winner every time! There we are! All right! That's the way to do it! Look at that! And we have another winner! Annie Oakley on the end! Here we are. What an eye! What an eye! Wait a second! I saw the whole thing! The machine's fixed! Who's she - your mother? Blow up your pants! One win! She only had one win! You're supposed to have 24 to win that dog! Will you give it a rest, kid? All right, boys and girls! Here we go! Here for the first time, see Zambora, strangest girl ever born to live. She was captured near Nairobi, south Africa, and is believed to be part of a cruel, inhuman experiment. This beautiful girl will be locked into a steel cage, will change very slowly into a ferocious 450-pound gorilla. Please be very still, ladies and gentlemen. We must have absolute silence so we wouldn't disturb Zambora from her transcendental state. We must warn you that in every scientific experiment there's always a danger. So keep in mind those curtains is an exit. God forbid something should go wrong over here, get outta here! Now we start the transformation. Very dangerous. Very quiet, please. Wake, my beauty, wake! Hey, lady, not through there. The other way. Come on! - No show? - Felix, don't tell me you lost her? We lost her. Nice place you have here. Take something off. Enjoy the sun. You've got a lot of guts showing up here! Letting me freeze my behind off at a blackjack table for two hours waiting for some nonexistent diamonds! And what the hell is my black wig doing in the pool?! - She's... - Dead. Supposed to be you. The next link in the pipeline. What are you talking about? Poor Plenty must have stumbled in here looking for you. I don't believe you. A dentist is dead in South Africa. That little old lady in Amsterdam. Shady got his last night. They've missed me once. And you're next. - Now, who's your connection? - You sound like a cop... - Who's your connection? - All I know is voices on a phone. They got me this place and told me to wait for further instructions. You'd find it difficult to hear under water. - Now, where's the stuff? - Who are you? You're not a cop and you're not Peter Franks. You're not the type to turn the other cheek. Where is it? Eastern Airlines announce the arrival of flight 112 from Los Angeles, gate 7. Thank you. Fill it up, please. It's Bert Saxby. Willard Whyte's right-hand man. Do you see the top? The penthouse? They say Willard Whyte hasn't set foot out of there in three years. And no one has seen him - no one. - How much is that? - Did you pay for this? Cut him off. Hey, Curly! What about my stamps? Where are you going? Are you mad? Let me by! Stamps? You ain't got no gas yet! - OK, so shove a coupla gallons in! - Well, back it up. Keep leaning on that tooter, Charlie, and you'll get a shot in the mouth! Come on, lady, move it! OK, lady, you win, you win. - Will someone move that car?! - Do what he says! Hey! I wanted high-test! Forget it, Curly! You had your chance and you blew it! OK, Professor. - Hello. - Hi. - I haven't seen you here before. - I'm Klaus Hergersheimer. - New here? - I've been here three years. G Section. How are things in G Section? Still the same old grind. You know. Checking radiation shields for replacement. By the way, where's yours? I've been waiting a couple of days for you guys to deliver them. Gee, I'm sorry. You should have given us a phone call. Look, I've got one here. Lucky for you, I carry spares. You keep that on. You can't be too careful about radiation. Absolutely. I feel much safer with this on. See you around. Who are you? What do you want? Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section. Just... checking on radiation shields. Now let me see. You are...? Professor Dr. Metz. Our shields are fine! Now get out! I'm sorry. It won't take a moment but I must verify. Metz. How do you spell it? M- E... Will you please leave, you irritating man? Doctor, there's no reason to run down the little people. G Section may not be as important to the operation as you are, but we do have our orders. Dr. Metz... Willard Whyte for you. Right. Out, out. Hello, WW. Yes, it's finally here. Quite enough for completion. We'll be through shortly. No. No problems at all. Right. - Now will you get out of here?! - Certainly, Doctor. I've seen everything I need to see. Thank you very much. Hi. Sorry to bother you. I'm Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section. Checking radiation shields? There he is! Behind the rock! Come on! What is this? Amateur night? Stop him, Harry! Get him off that machine. That isn't a toy. Get out of that moon buggy! It's gone berserk! Hey, what do you think you're doin'?! That way! - What happened? The diamonds... - Get in the car! If you see a mad professor in a minibus, just smile! Fred, get the sheriff's office. Drop me off at the next corner. This is getting out of hand. When you start stealing moon machines from Willard Whyte, goodbye and good luck! Just relax. I have a friend named Felix who can fix anything. Is he married? There goes that son-of-a-bitchin' saboteur! Relax! You've got a friend named Felix who can fix anything. Unfortunately, so can Willard Whyte. Why, you dirty... Come in, Larry. Larry? Larry? Did you get him, Larry? I think Larry got him. - Sheriff... - Attaboy, Larry. Come in. Larry? Sheriff... I got you now. Lean over. Darling... Why are we suddenly staying in the bridal suite of the Whyte House? In order to form a more perfect union, sweetheart. James... May I finally call you James? What's going to happen to me? You did talk to your friend Felix about me? What did he say? Something about 20 years to life. Nothing important. - 20 years to life?! - Relax, darling. I'm on top of the situation. Mr. and Mrs. Jones? Yes, that's the name on the register, Mr. Leiter. - What's the score with WW? - Washington says no go. - We sit still for now. - Sit still? And Miss Tiffany Case ""Jones"" has a lifetime reservation at another hotel. The kind the government... runs. I'm cooperating, Mr. Leiter. Really I am. I can vouch for that. Felix, this is not the real White House, and he's not the president. - Why don't we go and see him? - The president I can get you in to see. But until Washington believes Whyte's a thief, that's the way it is. In the meantime, I'm sure you and ""Mrs. Jones"" can find some way to amuse yourselves. And just to make sure you're not disturbed, I have a man upstairs. And Hamilton... is right out here. So long, James. - Well, that's a switch! - What's that? The wolf being guarded by the three little pigs. I won't be long, darling. Where are you going? I'm just popping upstairs for a moment. - Sixteenth floor? - No, lady. Starlight Lounge only. OK, folks. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go. Starlight Lounge to the left. Express to street level only, folks. OK. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go. Howdy, son. We've been expectin' you. You got any personal business to take care of in there, you go right ahead. First, I suspect you're wearin' a hog leg. Would you mind standin' up and takin' it off? Isn't that nice? You are a pleasant fella. Why don't you just come on in, son? Relax. Make yourself comfortable. That's good. Right on over there. Good evening, Mr. Bond. Blofeld. Good evening, 007. Double jeopardy, Mr. Bond. You killed my only other double, I'm afraid. After his death, volunteers were - understandably - rather scarce. Such a pity. All that time and expense simply to provide you with one mock-heroic moment. Willard Whyte speakin'. Yes, Governor. I got your message. No, I'm afraid a personal appearance is quite out of the question. I'll send a deposition to the committee. Thank you, Governor. Well, that's a neat trick. A voice box, Mr. Bond. Science was never my strong suit, but the principle is easy enough. Someone's voice patterns and resonance stored in a small oral-signature tape. And a miniature, transistorized version is installed in his neck. Or is it his neck? I never can remember. Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike. My congratulations to you both. Nice little company. Explosives, oil, electronics, houses, aviation. I've done rather well with it, too. Tried to cut some of the fat off, but Mr. Whyte's a splendid administrator. Damn thing runs itself. I suppose you killed him. Nothing so melodramatic. I'm simply holding him in cold storage, so to speak. An insurance policy against any outside interference with my plans. The ideal kidnap victim. No one's seen the man for five years. Who'd miss someone who's already missing? How clever you are, Mr. Bond. Nice to see you haven't lost that fine mental edge, 007. Please don't get any foolish notions. That missile is not a practical weapon. Well, it's hardly worth the effort. After all, I wouldn't know which one of you to kill. We appreciate your predicament, Mr. Bond. We deeply sympathize. Right idea, Mr. Bond. But wrong pussy. I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr. Bond. However potentially painful they may be. But I'm afraid this one has come to an end. What do you intend to do with those diamonds? An excellent question. And one which will be hanging on the lips of the world quite soon. If I were to break the news to anyone, it would be to you first. You know that. But it's late, I'm tired, and there's so much left to do. Good night, Mr. Bond. Well, go on, go on. It's merely a lift. Or perhaps I should say ""elevator"". In any event, I'm sure you'll find it much more convenient than mountaineering about outside the Whyte House. You press L, Mr. Bond. The word ""lobby"" begins with L. If at first you don't succeed, Mr. Kidd... Try, try again, Mr. Wint. One of us smells like a tart's handkerchief. I'm afraid it's me. Sorry about that, old boy. I don't mind the cockamamie machine breaking down twice a day. But why the hell does it always have to be 500 yards away from the nearest hatch? All right, Charlie. It's your turn to play hunchback. Thank you very much. I was just out walking my rat and I seem to have lost my way. Willard Whyte speakin'. This is Bert. We got a problem. What's wrong with your voice? Got a cold? Never mind about that. I just saw James Bond in the casino. - That's impossible. - Come and see for yourself. Hey, listen. If he's half the genius they say he is, we're in for real trouble. - Calm down, Bert. - It's a cinch he's not working alone. This place must be crawling with agents by now. - I think we should move Willard Whyte. - Nonsense. Mr. Whyte is perfectly safe at his own summerhouse. It's on the ridge, about ten miles out of town. I'm a little surprised, Bert. It's not like you to panic. I just don't enjoy messing around with a guy as tough as James Bond. Never mind James Bond. You get down to that house. I'm afraid Mr. Whyte has suddenly outgrown his usefulness. - Do it cleanly, Bert. - Don't worry. Just leave everything to me. That ridiculous contraption actually seems to work, Q. You've surpassed yourself this time. Not a bit of it. Made one of these for the kids last Christmas. Maxwell, James and I will head for the house. Get set to hit the penthouse as soon as we find Whyte. Let me speak to Metz. There's been a change. Push all plans forward by 24 hours. I'm joining you immediately. Give me five minutes to get up there and five minutes to find Whyte. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Ask me again in ten minutes' time. Tell Maxwell to stand by to hit the penthouse. Well, hi there! I'm Bambi. Good morning... Bambi. And I'm Thumper. Is there something we can do for you? I can think of several things offhand but at the moment I'm looking for Willard Whyte. Oh, Willie. Why, he's right out there. And that's all there is to it? Not quite. First... we're gonna have a ball. All yours, Bambi! You're on again, Bambi! Thumper... Hello, Felix. Willard Whyte is about to be executed, and guess who's giving breaststroke lessons. - Where the hell is Whyte? - I haven't found out yet. Still haven't found out. Right! FBI? - CIA? - No. British Intelligence, Mr. Whyte. James Bond. I see you've met my friends, Bambi and Thumper. Yes, we did have a bit of a chat. What the hell's happened to me and what can I do about it? Let's get out of here first and I'll explain it to you en route. Tell Maxwell to hit the penthouse... Saxby. - Bert Saxby?! - Yeah. Tell him he's fired. Hi there, Mr. Q. Are you having any luck? I'm being somewhat successful, thank you. Listen, Mr. Q. I... I was wondering. Have you heard any talk about me from Felix or James? No, I'm afraid not. I guess I'm working for the good guys now, but I'm two steps away from the slammer if they want me there. I thought... you might be able to put in a good word. That's unbelievable! An electromagnetic RPM controller. Been aching to give it a try. You see, pressure on the case when the desired symbols appear causes the rotation of the cylinders to stutter at the precise moment needed to... Cab, lady? Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Case. I'd so dreaded the prospect of making this tedious journey alone. This way, Mr. Whyte. It was right here. About six feet high, with a solar panel. - It had these aerofoils that seemed to... - Draw it for me. Was Dr. Metz on your payroll, Mr. Whyte? No. But I heard of him. Everybody in our business has. The world's leading expert on laser refraction. A committed idealist to peace. And how in the hell Blofeld got his hooks in him, I will never know! How did he get security clearance to work here in the first place? From you, sir. I talked to you personally about it. I even recognized your voice just now. I'm sure I must've told you not to keep the usual duplicate microfilm records of the project. Exactly, sir. Tom, what did I tell you to do with this? Send it to Vandenberg, sir. Well, get 'em on the phone - now! Yeah? You won't believe this. - Willard Whyte for you! - Wow. - This is a real honor, sir. - Shove your honor! - Where's that satellite I sent down there? - Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir. Perfect trajectory. All systems go. We expect to enter orbit right on the nose. - Wait. Something's happened. - Just a moment. The scanners have gone crazy. - Premature first-stage separation! - It doesn't make sense! Stand by to abort! We can't control it, sir. Abort it! It's negative. We can't. Something's taken over the guidance system! It's as if it had a will of its own. And there's not a damn thing we can do about it. We're working on it. I'll call you back, Mr. Whyte. Whatever it is, your friend Blofeld's controllin' it now. A vast supply of diamonds manipulated by an expert in light refraction. The first laser beam was generated through a diamond. And if old Metz deserves his reputation, the power of that thing could be incredible. And Blofeld's got it. - Where is it now? - Approaching North Dakota. Alert Strategic Air Command. Gimme an open line to SAC. Attention all personnel. Attention all personnel. We have a red alert. Stand by for emergency procedure. Willard Whyte. Yes, General. One of our missiles just ""accidentally"" blew up in North Dakota. Whatever's happenin', Mr. Bond, has started. - Is this your herd? - Mr. Whyte, phone call from Washington. - Urgent. - I'll catch it in the john. - What about Blofeld? - Not a trace. We found a tunnel. We'll check it out. - Where's Tiffany? - Do you mind if we find Blofeld first? Come on! Let's hit that tunnel! Washington just got word from your friend with the cat. Would you believe that this whole damn country is bein' held for ransom and we've got till noon tomorrow to pay up? So that's it. Well, I'm sure you won't be alone. An international auction, with nuclear supremacy goin' to the highest bidder. Tell me, what does he need to control that satellite? A simple set of tapes fed into a computer bank. All he really needs is a building. And these tapes? Large or small? Conceivably any size. From six inches to a cassette. Assuming he's still using your empire as a cover, Blofeld could be anywhere on this map. From Alaska to Florida. From Maine to Oregon. From Texas to... Baja California. Baja?! I haven't got anything in Baja! There is still no official explanation of the apparent nuclear accidents in North Dakota and Russia. Presidential news secretary John Fenner refused comment on a report that an emergency meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in session. It is believed the United States and the Soviet Union have assured each other that no offensive action has been taken by either nation. Reports of another nuclear accident in Red China are as yet unconfirmed. Two more submarines have taken up position not ten miles away. Are those military aircraft going to stand off forever? What if they won't accept our ultimatum? What if they attack? Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical show of force was only to be expected. The Great Powers flexing their military muscles like so many impotent beach boys. I deeply regret my threat to destroy a major city unless they give in, but the nuclear powers, like all bullies, can only be intimidated by force. - But how can you... - They still have an hour left to reply. One hour for both of us to achieve our common dream: Total disarmament and peace for the world. - Sir, there's a single plane approaching. - Range? Two miles, and closing. Stage One alert, please. Command Center. All crew to Stage One. Up the top! Second platform! There he is! - Aim! - Hold your fire! All recovery crew personnel, proceed to docking level and stand by. Good morning, gentlemen! The Acme Pollution Inspection. We're cleaning up the world. We thought this was a suitable starting point. How disappointing! I expected one head of state, at the very least. Surely you haven't come to negotiate, Mr. Bond? Your pitiful little island hasn't even been threatened. Search him from his toenails to the last follicle on his head. Then bring him to me. I do so hate martial music. As usual, Mr. Bond, you were absolutely right. You guessed correctly that that box contained the satellite control tape and you came aboard presumably hoping to substitute this for the real thing. So sorry to have ruined the line of your suit for nothing. Talking about lines, which one did you use on Miss Case? She has taken a reasonable attitude. Like any sensible animal, she's only threatening when threatened. Well, it appears that you're holding all the aces. - Right down to the dragon lady here. - Jealousy? From you, Mr. Bond? I'm flattered. As La Rochefoucauld observed: ""Humility is the worst form of conceit."" I do hold the winning hand. Why don't you let me take you on a little tour of our facilities? Your chance to see the real tape once again. Can I tag along, Ernst? I'd put something on over that bikini first, my dear. I've come too far to have the aim of my crew affected by the sight of a pretty body. No word yet from anyone! Only 12 minutes left. I suppose a little gentle prodding is called for. As you see, Mr. Bond, the satellite is at present over Kansas. If we destroy Kansas, the world may not hear about it for years. Perhaps New York. All that smut and traffic. It would give them a chance for a fresh start. Washington, DC. Perfect. Since we have not heard from them, they will hear from us. - See to it, Metz. - Washington. Right. And this, presumably, is the control bank with the coded tape. Right again, Mr. Bond. All satellites are controlled by a coded tape. The trick is, of course, to have the code. Obviously. It all seems so perfectly simple. I suppose one just presses that and out it pops. Put it back, Mr. Bond. Immediately. Hi, Ernst. Is Superman giving you any trouble? Put it back... very carefully. You've suddenly become tiresome, Mr. Bond. Target fixed! Commence countdown! Ten minutes and counting! Take him away and throw him in the brig. And search him again, just to make sure. Bitch! Come on! Your problems are all behind you now. Stop him! Nine minutes and counting. I did it. I switched the tape in the machine. You stupid twit. You put the real one back in. Come on, let's go! A weather balloon! - What do you think, Mr. Leiter? - That must be the signal. There isn't a low-pressure area within 200 miles of here. Let's go! This is Charlie One to Squadron. Charlie One to Squadron. Ready all guns and proceed to target. I repeat: Proceed to target. Roger, Charlie One. Out. Come on, Bond. Get the hell off that rig. Eight minutes and counting. Unidentified aircraft approaching rapidly. Range... five miles. But I... I don't understand! - You said they wouldn't attack! - The balloon was a signal. The stupid fools must think Mr. Bond has accomplished his mission. - Activate defenses! - Activate defenses. Seven minutes and counting. This is Charlie One. Commence attack! Commence attack! Six minutes and counting. Get them on the radio, Blofeld! - Tell them we give up! - Give up? I've waited too long for this moment. They'll pay dearly for making a fool out of me. I see it all now. You don't give a damn about peace! - All you care about... - Shut up, Metz. Tiffany, my dear. We're showing a bit more cheek than usual, aren't we? Take her below and lock her up with Mr. Bond. What a pity. Such nice cheeks, too. If only they were brains. Destroy this, Metz. Five minutes and counting. Four minutes and counting. Tell them we surrender! This is utter madness! One more word, Metz, and I'll have you shot! Get back to your post! Prepare my bathosub immediately. Three minutes and counting. All systems interlock. Bathosub to crane. Commence lift. Two minutes and counting. Power and breathing systems on. Release catch is open. Lower away. Bathosub to crane! Lower away! Wake up, man! Lower away! You stupid idiot! You could've killed me! Disengage! Disengage! Disengage! Lower! Not up! One minute and counting. Blofeld to Command Center! Come in! Blofeld to Command Center! Come in! Damn you! Command Center, come in! 40 seconds and counting. Get the gun. - Here! - Shoot 'em! Jump! Ten... nine... So long, James! I'll wire M you're on your way home! Don't tell him which direction we've taken! If you're havin' a good time, let the captain know and I'll have him steam around in circles! James, there's something very important I've been meaning to ask you about us. I know in a relationship like ours, the girl's not supposed to be the one to ask. But I can't help it. And please think before answering. That I promise. James... There must be some mistake. I didn't order anything. No mistake, sir. On the specific instructions and with the compliments of Mr. Willard Whyte. Oysters Andaluz. Shashlik. Tidbits. Prime rib en jus. Salade Utopia. And for dessert, the pice de rsistance... la bombe surprise. That looks fantastic! What's in it? But then there would be no surprise, would there, madame? - If madam would care to be seated. - Thank you. This will just take a moment, and then we will leave you in peace. Wine, sir? Mouton Rothschild '55. - May we begin? - Please do. A happy selection, if I may say. I'll be the judge of that. That's rather potent. Not the cork - your aftershave. Strong enough to bury anything. But the wine is quite excellent. Although, for such a grand meal, I had rather expected a claret. Of course. Unfortunately, our cellar is rather poorly stocked with clarets. Mouton Rothschild is a claret. And I've smelt that aftershave before. And both times I've smelt a rat. He certainly left with his tails between his legs. Oh, James! Oh, yes. What were you about to ask me? James... How the hell do we get those diamonds down again?, Good luck, Sonny! Good job, Hooper! Okay, now, look alive. Here comes the director. Did you have a good lunch? - You all set? - Ready. Six-three, Louis. Okay, Hooper, stand by now. We're about set. - Roll the cameras. - Rolling, Jack. Scene two, take one, B camera. Marker. - We're ready to make the shot, Roger. - Action. Action. Come on, Hooper. Cut! Did you get it? - Good. - Print it. Let's get ready for the next setup. Get the first team in there. Get me down, Joe. Don't move, Hooper! Don't move! - Need a picture, Jack? Booga-booga-booga! - Hold still, Hooper. - You all right? Huh? - Oh. Terrific. - I'm serious, now. You all right? - I invented that stunt. There ain't nobody in the world that does it better. - And you say that in all humility? - I give great humble. - It's okay. Not a scratch. - You sure? - I'm not talking about your ass. - Okay, let's have the first team! - What would you give for a little of that? - Two nipples for a dime. - Sonny, that was terrific. - No, that's terrific. - Teach me to do that gag sometime. - Ha, ha. He wants to learn how to do that. What, are you crazy? I want to ride under trucks. - Come on, teach me some gags. - Oh, for chrissake. - West, can I have you in position over here? - Right away, Tony. I'll make a deal with you. I won't do any acting... - ...you don't do any stunts, okay? - Adam, please? - Okay. - Okay. - Mr. West! Please! - Coming, little lady. Hooper. - Hooper, you can wrap for the day. - How was the stunt? Okay? - Yes. - That good, huh? - Yeah. - Would you go so far as to say perfect? Well, that's what he's supposed to be, isn't he? Ha-ha-ha. Tony! I hate it when directors slobber all over me. When your last picture made over $100 million, you don't have to slobber over anybody. - You got any Percs? - Yeah, here. If you're hurting that bad, want me to go get the kit? - No, I'll just chomp on a couple of these. - What is it this time? It's my frigging back. - Are you all right, Sonny? - Never felt better and had less. - Listen, you can be replaced. - Ha, ha. - The bike gag was terrific. - Would've killed your ordinary man. - Mm. Cully, you taking care of my boy? - Well, I'm trying to, Mr. Berns. Well, make sure you don't give him any more of those goddamn pills. By the way, Sonny, there's a new kid in town. Everyone says he's a young Sonny Hooper. - Would you like to check him out? - I'm full up. - You're the boss. See you later. - Thanks. - Now, take care. - See you, Max. Why is it every time I come to town... some young boy... has gotta try and make a name for himself? - Do Gregory Peck for the doctor. - I don't want to see him. - Gotta go to get some x-rays. - I've seen my x-rays. - They look like a map of L.A. - Maybe you've built another off-ramp. Wait a minute. The Percodan is starting to work. I feel the pain is vanishing. By God, I think she can dance. I think she can turn. I think she can whirl. Whoo! Ooh! Jesus! How about a date? Ha, ha. Dancer! She'll be here in a minute, Dancer. - Perfect companion. - Me or Dancer? I wouldn't kick either one of you out of the hay. Hey, you never feed me a can of beer like that. - You don't shake it up and down like that. - Oh, that's very true. - How'd it go today? Okay? No problems? - Okay. No. You fill all those little minds at school with knowledge? - I did my very best. - Ah. - Cully called. How's your back? - Oh, yeah? He's got a big mouth. Oh, come on, how's your back? A lot better than his butt's gonna be after I kick it. What the hell's the matter with Cully, calling you up all the time? - Sonny. Your eyes are dilated. - What? - Oh, don't start. - How many pain pills did you take? I had two, for crying out loud. I don't take dope. I don't take cocaine. I don't smoke pot. I take pain pills. I got pain, for chrissake. Look at my socks. What are they doing...? - Those are your socks. - I know they are. Why are they on the phone? My pants are on the chandelier. - You threw them there last week. - I was in a horny mood. It's all over the place. It's like a beer-can collection. - It's not a big deal. You don't work that hard. - I thought of putting it away. Well, why don't you put it away? Why don't you take the stuff, put it in...? Sit down, will you? Now, do you want to hear my thinking on this? If I just let things pile up long enough, we won't be able to find each other. And if you can't find me, you can't have me. - That makes sense. Ha, ha. - Yes. Sonny... I'm not asking for miracles. If you could just get the beer cans, say, 25 feet from... Ten feet from the trash can. Ten feet. It's close enough. I'm yours. - Is your back okay, really? - It's fine. - Did you want to walk on it? - No, I want you to crawl under it. All right, we're ready down here. Could we clear the area, please? - Don't stand in front of the cameras. - You're a brave doggy. - Right here? - Put your hand right through there. - You guys ready on the roof? - Working on it. - It's tied off? Okay. - Tied off. - I love danger. - Okay, we're ready down here. Okay, don't look down now. - Roll the cameras! - Five, six on all cameras. - A camera mark. - B camera mark. Okay. Action! Cut, cut! Sensational, Adam! Rest for a minute. - Good job there, Adam. - Was I all right? Help Mr. West down the steps. All right, now, let's get set up for this stunt. Let's move it. Move it! - Good morning. - Hey, Sonny, how are you? - Morning, dwarf. - Clever. You ready? - Where's ""Mr. Movie""? Oh, good morning. - Right here. Good morning. Now, as I was telling you the other day, Hooper... in this scene you'll be escaping across the roof with the dog. The dog? Why do I have a dog? Just do the stunts like I tell you. Let me worry about the creativity, okay? Now, about halfway through, the sling will break... and down you will come, dog and all. And I'll pick up Adam falling off the awning. It's simple. If it's so simple, why don't we have the actor do it? - I'd like that in one take, Hooper. - I hope so. - Okay, people, let's go. - Just a minute. Sonny, do you remember me? - Bidwell from the Humane Society. - Oh, hi. - No dog is gonna fall from that. - No, sir. We have a dummy dog. The sequence is King riding with Sonny here, and then we cut... and substitute the dummy dog for the actual fall. I don't know. I don't like the whole setup. I don't like it either. I'm the one that's got to do the falling. But you made that decision for yourself. - The poor dog can't make that decision. - Don't worry, sir. The company is very eager to comply with all Humane Society regulations. - So we really must be going now. - Good to see you again, George. As you can see, the dummy dog wouldn't fool anybody. - It wouldn't fool me. - The realie will take the fall with you. - Oh, for chrissake. - There's my man. - Make me look great, Sonny. - I'll make you look great, Adam. You can't use a real dog, Tony, for chrissake. He can't hit an airbag. Maybe you can teach him on the way down. - Do me a favor, will you? - Yeah, what is it? - Bring me a stepladder about this high. - Yeah, what for? I want you to climb up on it and kiss my ass. See you later, Toulouse! All right, people, when Mr. Wonderful gets on his perch... let's all be ready. Okay, people, we're ready. Clear it fast. Get ready on the roof. - Good man. - How are you guys today? - Morning. - How you doing? It's all yours. - Okay, all set there, Sonny? - Hooper! People are growing old down here. One second. You're waiting on me, you're backing up! Give me the pooch. - Okay. Got it? - Nice doggy. Time for a little ride. Roll the cameras. - Mark central camera. - Make it good, Hooper. Cut! Print it. New setup over here. I'll make you an official stunt dog. Cully, get this dog a belt buckle. - Nice going, Sonny. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. Yeah. - Really? I'm fine. - You hit like a sack. Are you okay? - I suppose you thought that was cute. What happened to the cut? The dummy dog? What the hell are you getting on his case for? He risked his life for that dog. Use the realie. More realistic. Do it in one take. Impress the director. Tony said that's what you were gonna do and you did it. Well, we're gonna be pressing formal charges against you, Sonny. You... That little runt. That's one I owe him. You got your kit? It's in the trailer. - Well, let's go to the trailer. - I knew it. Do you know what I'd do if I met the man that invented Xylocaine? What? I would kiss his ass right on Hollywood and Vine. Ha, ha. I knew you were hurt the minute you hit that bag. - But you had to protect the dog. - I love dogs. - Let's go to the doctor's. - I hate doctors. You ain't scared of nothing. - Why are you scared of doctors? - Scared of dentists too. I'll tell you what you're scared of. - You're scared of what he's gonna tell you. - Oh, balls. Balls! Balls! You're gonna have to see him eventually. I'll buy the drink I was gonna buy you last night... if you'll just do me your Jimmy Stewart imitation. Just a little Jimmy Stewart for me. That's... That's a good deal. I'll do Jimmy Stewart, and you do Roy Rogers' sidekick. - Roy's sidekick. - Yeah. Roy is a good old boy, but he... He had Trigger stuffed, you know? So when you die, I'm gonna have you stuffed. You wouldn't. I'm gonna stuff everything but your old wing-dinger. - That's the part that needs stuffing. - You ought to stuff that every night. I'll leave that up to you. I'm a little too old for it. - Well, I ain't gonna hold it. - No. Hell, no. Banker's hours, eh, Sonny? - Sonny, it's early for the Palomino, isn't it? - Not for me, old cock. - I'll tell you what, that job was perfect. - Good shot, good shot. - Hello, Jimbo. - How you doing, Sonny? What you doing out here with my lady when I'm not around? That's dangerous. - Not as dangerous as doing stunts. - Yes, it is. What can I do for you, pard? I just wanted to make sure you're doing that charity stunt show. Oh, I'd love to, but I'm going on a motocross. It's for the benefit of the Boys' Home. That's real touching, but I'm gonna get on my bike and go across the desert. I've got somebody who'd really like to meet you. Idolizes you. - Knows everything you've ever done. - Who's that? One of the boys from the home. I'll just get him. - Why didn't he bring violins? - Honey, it's a boy from the Boys' Home. They need someone to pattern their lives after, you know? - Yeah, what a cheap shot. - Pete, meet Sonny. - Hi, Pete. - Sonny, how you doing? Real good. How you doing? - Fine. Guess what. - What? - I can do a stunt. - You can do a stunt? - Yeah. - Let me see it. - Okay, get on there. Shoot him. - Move it. - Do what? - Shoot him. - Move it. - Bang. That's terrific, but I'm going on the motocross Saturday. Well, I guess I'll just have to give your gags to that hot new kid with Stunts Unlimited. - Oh, yeah? How old are you, kid? - I'm still dead. Oh. Right, yeah. Well, you don't have to be dead anymore. How old are you? - I'm 18. - Eight. - Yeah. - Okay, I'll be there Saturday. - Great! - Ha, ha. Give me five! - See you Saturday. - Thanks, Sonny. You're all heart. Yeah. Sonny. What a wonderful gesture. - Ah, I'm a wonderful person. - Aw. Welcome to the 5th Annual Stuntmen's Benefit Show... and up the street to your left, here they come! Giddyap! And pay attention to the stagecoach driver, Billy Burton... the best muleskinner in Hollywood. I see you liked it. Hey, lady. - Oh. Hello, Dad. - Where'd you get all them house apes? Kids. Where are my kids here? This is my father. Hi. Sonny coming with Dancer? Yeah. You know why he's here, don't you? Have you seen that new kid work? Now that son of a bitch knows how I felt when he came... - Dad! The language. - What? Oh. Shit. Sorry. Damn. Ignore him. He's a degenerate. Now, how about a big round of applause for these two young ladies? That's all the pay they're gonna get. Look out, it's Black Bart, the meanest hombre west of the Pecos. What we need now is a hero who can stop him. - Yee! - And here he is, just in time! That man is one of the true legends of the stunt world, Mr. Jocko Doyle! Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest stuntman alive: Sonny Hooper and his famous horse, Dancer! They've never let us down. They've performed in every benefit we've ever had. Whose damn truck is that parked right in the middle of everything? That belongs to the kid. Well, where is this hot kid I've been hearing so much about? We better back up a little bit, or he's gonna drop right on us. Oh, shit. Hey, not too shabby. The chariot race is coming up, kid. Go put your Fruit of the Looms on. I'm on my way. The chariot race is next. This ought to be a wreck. - Who's racing against the kid? - Hammerhead. Hammerhead? - How are you, Sonny? - Hi, Hammerhead. What's the matter? What...? What are you looking at? You've got a nice tush... but shouldn't you have something on underneath this thing? - Like what? - Like shorts. This is all they gave me. And besides, I don't ever wear shorts. What if you have a wreck? What if you turn over and it falls out? It ain't gonna fall out. Yeah, but what if it does? What if it falls out? All the stunt guys are gonna be embarrassed. I'll tell you what, you can go to my trailer, get a pair of my shorts. You can put them on. I'll watch the team for you while you're gone. Hey, thanks, Sonny. When I get done with the shorts, I'll have them washed. Get ready for the chariot race, kids. Everybody will have to pick your own hero. Hey, nice fall you did back there. I'll be. Sonny Hooper. - I've waited a year and a half to meet you. - Oh, yeah? - What happened to Hammerhead? - Oh, he was feeling poorly. Bad for him, good for me. - How's that? - I get to perform with Sonny Hooper. Oh, hell, that ain't no big deal... Hyah! Hyah! Come on, baby! Come on! Move it! Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute, Jimbo. Caca, Dancer. Caca, caca, caca. - Beautiful, wasn't it? Round and firm... - Hey, let's go to the Palomino Club. Had a yellow streak running through them. - Pretty good trick, Sonny. - Kid, you know how to make an entrance. - I'm Jocko Doyle. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Doyle. I've studied just about everything you've ever done. Well, that's back in the caveman days. - You looked good today. Didn't he look good? - Yeah, he looked good. - Want to go to the Palomino Club? - How far did you fall? - It was about 125 feet. - What's the furthest I've ever fallen? - Oh, maybe 150 feet. - No, I think it was about 85 feet. Wasn't it more like 75 in Bullet? Looks like he studied you too. We'd better go to the Palomino Club. Go ahead, Jimbo! I'm really dry! Hey, it's lonely! - We're coming over! - Come on with that cerveza! Goddamn! That son of a bitch didn't even say thank you! Where is that beer? Hey. Sonny! - Anybody in there need a beer? - Jocko needs a beer. - My arms aren't long enough! - That's no problem. Wait here. Pretty fancy! Let me see your license, please. - Shall I wait, officer? - Yeah. No. Do whatever you want! Hey! What do you think you're doing? - We're just going backwards. - Pull that thing over! - Do what? - Right over there by the curb. Okay. I don't believe I was going over 55. You were going 55 backwards. - Well, that's not against the law, is it? - Unsafe backing. - Silly law. - It's still the law. - Sign here, please. - All right. - Here's your license. - Thank you. - Here's your ticket. - See you around. Have a good trip! - Happy landings! - Have a nice day, officer! Oh, would you move on over, Mama? Come on and make some room for me Jump in the back of my old Pontiac And I'll drive you to Tennessee I'll push the pedal down to the floor Turn the radio up all the way Keep this car in overdrive And we'll let that rock 'n' roll play Go Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate it. Thank you. We'll be right back. Stick around, get drunk and be somebody. Thank you. It's called 75 in a second. And he says, ""Where's that damn dog now?"" He's right alongside. He's: He said, ""Well, shit, I'll just jam it."" And he just floors it! Will you shut up? I'm trying to tell... - That table sure is loud over there. - Making a lot of noise. Old Blue's right alongside. And this goddamn truck comes across. I got 50 cents in the jukebox. I can't hear it. Let's go get our money's worth. The old man says, ""Well, that's his asshole. See, he ain't used to them quick stunts."" Say, Granddad. Hey, Granddad, I got 50 cents in that jukebox, and all I can hear is your mouth flapping. What'd you say, son? I'm a mite deaf. I said, I got 50 cents in that jukebox... and all I can hear is your mouth flapping. Did you hear that? - Now, we figure you owe us 50 cents. - You guys from out of town? - Uh-huh. Houston. - Oh, yeah? What are you doing here? - A convention. - Convention? What kind of convention? Convention of assholes? - Ha-ha-ha. Thank you. - A SWAT convention. Oh. A SWAT convention. A SWAT team? They gonna swat flies? Ha-ha-ha. You know how to save a policeman from drowning? - No. - Good! What about my 50 cents? - Stanley! - Yeah. - Can I borrow your hard hat? - Sure. I'll get you your 50 cents. Excuse me. Looks like a job for the Golden Helmet. Well, if you wanted to make somebody look like an asshole, boy, you sure did. That was you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Six against 12. Seven. Seven against 12. Well... looks like it's a little uneven. You guys will have to go back to Houston and get some more guys. We may be in trouble. We are definitely in trouble. Holy shit! A fight! What's that? Wait, wait, wait. Give me a hand, will you? Cute. Really cute. Oh, how rude! - Thank you. - You're welcome. Look out now! Oh! We're getting a little old for this shit, ain't we? That's right. Let's go get some sexy... Ooh! Listen, fudge nuts, you ain't ever gonna learn, are you, dummy? Willard! Jeffrey! Get this son of a bitch! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Super Hooper! Oh, well. Another night, no profits. Huell! Get out there and stop that. - Yes, ma'am. You bet. - Get them, Huell! Bouncers! Throw them out. God dang! Isn't that fun? Ha-ha-ha. Whoo! - Let's go back in! - Are you crazy? - Let's just talk about it a minute. - Oh, what are you talking about? You were really graceful in there tonight, kid. Where'd you learn to fight like that? - Ha-ha-ha. - I was on the Olympic boxing team. I'll show you how to throw a man out of here! I've been getting thrown out of here since... Aah! ...before you were goddamn born! All right, all right. These fights ain't worth a shit anymore. Kid, what's your name? Delmore Shidski. - What's that last name again? - Shidski. - How do you spell that? - Are you kidding me? - Huh? S-H-I-D... - S-K-I. Well, we'll just call him Ski. Hey, the night's too quiet and it's too young to quit! It is too damn mean in there. Let's go someplace else. Let's go get some loving. - Thanks a lot, Tim. All right. - Catch you next time. Shit. That wasn't any kind of fight. Let's go on up to the ranch and show them your stunt reels. Hey, pretty! - Yeah. Would you like to see it? - Yeah, I would. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! It's 1:30 in the morning! You whip up some eggs for the guys and we'll have a little party. We'll just drink. What the hell. We're gonna have a party at my house. It always leaves them speechless. - That was great, Sonny. - Thank you. Looks like you've done every gag there ever was. Well... - me and Jocko... - Yeah! Believe I will. Me and Jocko, we... We never turned down a stunt. No. Never turned down a gag. I had it in my will once... - ...I thought I was gonna, uh... - Die. I'd have something to leave, and I put it in the will. I said... I wanted it on the cement, on the thing... - Tombstone. - Tombstone! ""Jocko Doyle never turned down a gag."" See? - Perfect. - That was... Been a hell of an idea. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Once I turned down... What I did turn down was everything else... but then, shit, gotta keep the good times rolling. Is that why you did it all? Because of the good times? Well, you don't wanna knock good times, kid. I mean... I get so damn old, I'm just... sitting in my rocking chair on a porch, I wanna have same nice memories. What the hell else is there? I don't know, just, uh... Maybe prove certain things can be done or that... a man can do just about anything he puts his mind to. That is too deep for me. Sun! The sun's come up! It's daylight! - Hey. - Mm. You ought to drink more. Nothing hurts when you're numb. - Where's the kid? - He's standing in there... staring avariciously into your trophy case... little trickles of slobber running down here. It's so goddamn funny. You weren't a hell of a lot different a few years ago. - Twenty years ago. - Twenty years ago. Your little eyes were spinning around, beady... looking for fame and fortune. - Shit. - Ha-ha-ha. And I know damn well too. I was sitting there making $20,000 a year... as the top dog around this place. Every time I look over my shoulder, there you are jumping up and down... figuring out some way you can top whatever gag I did. - Well? - Well? Well, you gonna marry my daughter? Oh. Goddamn, Jocko. I was married once. You know that. It was a disaster. I... I felt like a failure, you know? I'm scared to death of marriage. Besides that, nobody's getting married today anyway. - Who ain't getting married? - Nobody's getting married! Name me somebody that ain't getting married. Name me two people. Everybody's... People getting... Faggots are getting married, for chrissake. What the hell do you mean, nobody's getting married? Eh. I love her, Jocko... but I gotta do things in my own time. - You're a horny son of a bitch. - I gotta do things my own way. Yeah, well, that's what I done, see? In my time, my way. I wasn't even home when she was born. Listen, you. Didn't you ever want that? Haven't you ever been with Gwen when you wanted to have a baby? Huh? Did you ever have that feeling? All the time, Jocko. All the time. Listen, Roger, we gotta have a talk. The studio's bugging me about the budget. Later, Max. I've got to get this first shot. Tony, let's set up this first one, okay? Listen, Roger. Medic! Oh. Thank you, my love. Ah! Thank you. - Good morning, Mr. Berns. - Hi, Max. - Why, that punk. Who? Roger. - Who? If his last picture hadn't grossed $100 million, I'd kick his ass. Do it! We've been waiting for months for you to kick his ass. You guys look like garbage. You should see through my eyes. It's Metrocolor. I've just got a little headache. You think we're bad, you should see...! Don't yell in my ear. Jesus Christ! What the hell is that? Look what's coming. Stop that thing! Shoot it! Kill it! - Want some breakfast? - Oh! God. Get that circumcised, will you? - What are you doing here? What? - Reporting for work. - Reporting for work. - To work? Yeah. You told me last night to come to work. - Did I do that? - I don't remember that. - Oh. - You were pretty bombed. Want me to leave? No. No, I don't want you to leave. We'll find you some work. All right, everybody's ready now. - Roll the cameras. - Cameras ready. - Marking able. - And maker. All right, background! Action! Cut it! Cut it! Okay? Didn't do a thing for me, Hooper. Missed by a mile. Boring, boring, boring. I'm not a mind reader, Roger. If you tell me what you want, I'll do it. Look, you're the stunt gaffer, so gaff. I've got an idea. Would take some time, though. - Who are you? - He's a new man. Ski. He's a good man. Anything will be better than that, so let's try one. Thanks to the kid here, the Polack, we have to sit around waiting for night to shoot. Gives me time to get over my hangover. Guys, it's Roger's birthday. Oh. I thought maybe we could all think of something to give him? How about VD? Oh, I got an idea. I know something perfect for him. Everybody cough up a little money. Happy birthday, Roger Watch your feet, guys. Well, what more can I say? I'm very, very touched, and thank you. This fire scene is very dangerous. We want everybody on their toes. We don't want anybody hurt. Okay, action! - Remember, that's gasoline in there, Sonny. - Right. - Be careful. - Bless your cock. Hello, gorgeous. - Sonny, will you get me out of here? - You bet your sweet bippy. - Sonny, will you get serious! - No time for that. Are they okay? I can't see through the flame. Cut it! Cut it! Are you guys waiting for an invitation to put that fire out? L.A.'s got enough smog. Oh. You know, Sonny, I love stuntmen. Let's get that fire out. I want everybody to stay back here. - Don't get near those flames. - Tony. Get Hooper over here for me, will you? Uh, Hooper, that bit at the complex tomorrow... - ...who's set for it? - Bobby Bass. Hmm. Would you mind if Ski did it instead? Yes, I would mind, Roger. Uh... I'm the stunt coordinator on this picture... and I say who does and who doesn't do the stunts. And I'd like Bobby Bass. Hmm. Well, I don't want to infringe on your authority... but I really would like Ski to do that gag, okay? Six-three, Louis. Okay, everybody, we're ready to make one. Roll the cameras! Speed! A camera. Baker! Action! Cut it! Bring the stuntman out here, please. Great, Kent! Go downstairs, relax. Wonderful. Hey, good luck, Ski. All right, you gotta make him look good. Okay? All the preparation you need. - We'll go down and set up the cameras. - You got it. All right, people, we're in the wrong place. Now move it all downstairs. Let's go! Let's move it! You ready, Ski? He'll be ready in a second. Tony, he's ready! - Roll the cameras! - Speed! B camera marker. Come on, good buddy. Not too shabby. No, that's pretty good. We could've done that when we were his age... except they didn't have buildings that tall. Cut it! Cut it! You have to admit he's pretty damn good. - Yeah, I have to admit it. - Pretty damn young too. Yeah, I hate him. I just hate him. - Handsome little shit. - Ugh. Well? I thought it was a little slow. If you don't mind, uh, I'd like to have another one. Okay? Are you kidding me? Yeah, I'm kidding. Come around tomorrow. I'll show you how an old man does it. - Here you go, Sonny. - Thanks, Don. We're all ready, Hooper. A little air in the air bag would help, numb-nuts. Get that filled up! Sonny! - Are you crazy? Huh? - What? - I just talked to that helicopter pilot. - So? Well, how high are you gonna drop? - What's the world record? - Two twenty-three. I'll go 224. Roll the cameras! Action! Pull me in, Jeffrey! Pull me in! Whoa. I hope nothing happens to this dinner jacket. Man, I want to keep this. - Whoo! You look like a head waiter. - I am. Geronimo! You've got another world record for your books, buddy. How about a can of Coors? Huh? Sonny, you can jump on my mattress any time. - Fantastic. - You're great, Sonny. - Terrific, Sonny. - Hooper, it was nice. - You're through for the day. - I'm proud of you. I bet that air bag didn't look that... Without causing any commotion, I want to go see the doctor. About the same thing. Another tropism. We've got a coronal-facing here and another sagittal-facing here... two areas of instability... within the space of around two or three lumbar vertebrae. Now, if we go over here, as you can see, this is the articulating facet. This is a coronal-facing here, and this is a sagittal-facing over here. This gives a very unstable low-back condition. How's my cockus erectus? - If you'll hold on to it for a minute, I'll finish. - Fine. All of these conditions make it look like you're having a preosteoporotic condition. Frankly, Sonny, it doesn't look too promising. Hell, I thought I had a problem till you explained it. Now I'm not worried anymore. Christ, I was really proud of that operation. The average person, it would have lasted them for a lifetime. - Hmm. - But not with you. Why do you keep on screwing up all my good work? Ha, ha. You should be paying me. Half of what you know you learned from wiring me together. What have you got, a death wish? Look who's talking. These things are nails in your coffin. - Jesus. - I'm cutting way down. Ha-ha-ha. I hope so. - Look, Sonny, I'm serious. - Good. You can't keep bashing your backbone... and expect to go walking around like a normal person. Listen, I can handle it. I'm a tough guy. You know what I mean? Give it to me, sweetheart. Don't pull any punches. The kid can take it. The kid could take it. Only you're not a kid any longer. - Look, heh, I'm gonna level with you. - Hmm? - One good impact here... - Ow. ...you understand? You're gonna be paralyzed. From the neck down, nothing moves. - Nothing? - Heh. Yeah, even your ding-dong. - My ding-dong. - Heh. Look, Sonny, I'm not saying it'll happen, but you could die. Well, if my ding-dong ain't gonna work, I don't wanna live. All right. But the odds are against you. If you were a horse, I'd shoot you. I bet a big five. - ""El foldo."" - El foldo. Star, el foldo. El foldo. I'll see it. And here come the biggies. Screw the biggies. Wait a minute. You can't use that thing. What is that? - It's my pocket computer. - You can't use a computer. You can't use that. Show me where it says I can't, and I'll put it up. All right. I'll see your five and I'll raise you five. Uh, I'll just use my manually operated poker sense... against your mechanical wizardry. And I'll bump you a quarter. - High roller, huh? - Mm-hm. Look at that, gang. Who is that guy? - That's the writer. Heh. - Well, he looks a little miffed. - You think Roger didn't like his script? - I think so. Ha-ha-ha. - What do you got? - Pair of fours. - Pair of sevens. - Ha-ha-ha. Sevens. Three aces. Ha-ha-ha. - It was a calculated risk. - So was the Edsel. Ha-ha-ha. - Like to sit in for a hand, Mr. Berns? - Thanks, Cully, but I'm not in the mood. - Well, you characters, you did it this time. - How's that? Roger. You got him so excited he's rewriting the script... putting a whole bunch of new gags in for you. What, he want us to blow up L.A.? No joke. The writer was a little upset, as you may have noticed. Yeah, we noticed. And the studio is backing him all the way. They say it's his ball game. So tomorrow morning at 8:00, on Stage 6... he's having a meeting with you fellas, and he's gonna show you a new ending. The biggest earthquake ever. You guys are trying to drive to safety. The first thing we'll do is collapse this building into a giant crevice. Giant crevice. You're driving through explosions, bodies flying everywhere, fire... You're just about to reach safety when bam! We blow the bridge. And you fellas will have to rappel down into the gorge... There'll be a lot of fire and smoke and explosions. ...up the other side to safety. - All in one shot? - All in one shot. Flames, explosions, death. Everything. And you guys leaping out of it to triumph. Isn't it a great idea? It's a great idea, Roger. I can't imagine anything better. Why not jump a car over the gorge? Aw, Ski, will you knock it off with the jokes? No, no, no. What do you mean, Ski? Well, you'd have the biggest, best car stunt ever done. What kind of car could leap a gorge that wide? - A rocket car could make it. - Well, I don't like it. What if you don't make it? - Cliff? - They could make it, couldn't they? Sure, they could make it! Cliff... what's the longest jump a rocket car's ever made? Buddy Joe took one 187 feet once. - How far is this? - Three hundred and twenty-five feet. Could you beef up the suspension? Build a cage strong enough to protect Ski and I when we landed on the other side? I could build a car like that, but I can't tell how it would land. - That's 325 feet, Sonny. - I know how far it is, Cliff. - Hell. It'd be a new world record. - Wouldn't do my reputation any harm. Sonny, think of the risk. Forget about the risk, Max. Just bring your checkbook. - Hooper? - Huh? What's your fee for a gag like that? A hundred thousand dollars. Fifty thousand dollars for Ski... $50,000 for me. It's the world's biggest stunt. It ought to have the world's biggest paycheck. Look, will you boys wait over there for a minute? I want to discuss this with Roger. Of course, of course. You can do it, Cliff. Build a strong enough cage so when we land on the other side... Roger... you know how much over the budget we are. I want it, Max. It's right, and I want it. It's a stunt that's never been done. And what if they don't make it, Roger? - Are you gonna be responsible for it? - I don't care. I want it. It's the ending I want. It's the statement I want to make. Cut something else if you have to. I want that stunt. All right, Roger. I'll talk to Sonny, see if I can't get his price down. No offense, Max, but I don't think you could. Hooper knows you too well. Tony will get him down. Won't you, Tony? It'll be a pleasure. I drove this sucker the other day and it hauls ass. What'd you do to it? I put a 428 police interceptor in it. Balanced and blueprinted. - It's plenty hot. - If it's that hot, I could use it Friday night. - Listen up, listen up. Lead heads! - What? - Any of you guys seen Hooper? - Down here, short legs. - Hooper. - Yeah? - Can I talk to you for a second? - Step in my office. Look, that gag you guys came up with this morning... 100,000 is way out of line. Mm-hm. Well, that's my price. It's not negotiable. Heh. Everything is negotiable, Hooper. I know you're making big noises just to jack up your fee, but here it is. Twenty grand for the jump. Because when you get right down to it, that's all this is: just another car jump. Really? Better fasten your seat belt. What the hell are you doing? I'm just thinking over your offer. I think better when I'm driving. Hooper, don't get excited. Maybe we can compromise. I never compromise. Life is too short. So are you. - Maybe we got off on the wrong foot, Hooper. - I don't think so. - Oh, Jesus! - It's just another car jump. - Did you enjoy that? - No. No. - Hey, Sonny! - Hi, Jane! You'll work with anybody! Ah, I love Westerns. Whoo! Look out! Here comes the wild man! - Price is 100 grand. - A hundred grand will be just fine. - You okay, Hoop? - Oh, yeah. Just couldn't be better. Tony might get a little sick in a second. He had a stroke. A stroke? Yeah. He says he fell down in the shower and broke his knee. The dumb jerk. Even when they tell him it's a stroke, he won't accept it. Come on. How is he now? I don't know. They shot him full of Demerol. Stupid old bastard. He's so damn stubborn. - Jocko? - Jesus Christ. Hey. - Ain't this a bitch? - Mm. What happened? Well... 35 years of falling off horses and airplanes and every goddamn thing else... I gotta go and do a brodie in my own toilet. You're gonna be all right, Jocko. You know what a priest told me one time? No, what? This priest says to me, ""Son, your body is a temple."" Heh. Hell of a goddamn way to treat a temple, ain't it? Horses stepping all over it... stagecoaches dragging it all through rocks and cactus and all kinds of shit... Then I spend the rest of my time... laying around waiting for something to heal. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? - Yeah. - Well... what for? Can you tell me what for? - Well, I think, Jock... - I don't want to hear all that now, Sonny. Goddamn, you're a talkative son of a bitch. Temple's all busted to shit, and all you can do is keep on talking. Did the doctor say anything to you? Yeah. They said they don't know if he'll be able to walk again. Well, I'll tell you something, Gwenny. I'm quitting after this picture. I'm not doing any more stunts. I'm going to hang it up. I love you. I'm gonna make so much money on this job anyway, I can... pay off the ranch. Stock it. We'll be in high cotton. Heh. I love you. What'd you say? I said, I love you. I love you too. Oh. Oh. You better save some tequila for breakfast. Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. Heh. Come on in. Where in the hell have you been? I've been waiting. - We were at the hospital, Cully. - Oh? - Dad had a stroke. - A stroke? Really? - Is he all right? - He's gonna be all right. Oh, I'm sorry, Gwen. - God, Cully, you look perfectly awful. - Oh, I am. I am. - I'll get you some supper. - No, wait, wait, wait. Nothing to eat. I got fired, heh, so I came by to say goodbye. - Fired? What are you talking about? - Well, see, they were over budget... and they wanted to get rid of some of the deadwood. - My Wood's dead. Heh. - Who fired you? Max? I don't really know. But I got the word from that little popcorn fart, Tony. - Oh, no, no. - Shut up. Nobody can hire and fire anybody on this... What are you doing? Come on. I told them if they fired you, they'd have to fire me. - Did you tell them that? I appreciate that. - Yes, I told them that. You little rascal. That's why I love you. We do things for each other. - I'm gonna do something for you now. - Do something for me. Good advice. Get off the damn picture before you get hurt. Cully, he told me this is his last picture. After this, no more. Oh, sure, if there's anything left of him after this picture. - Cully. - What does that mean? - Oh. You didn't tell her? - No, I didn't. He didn't tell you? Naughty, naughty. He didn't tell you about the big bad rocket-car stunt? - Will you stop it? - No. What stunt? Oh. Well, I'm gonna let him fill in the details. Mind your own business. Just drink your tequila. I do want to tell you one thing while I'm still drunk on your tequila. - Shit. Oh, shit. - I went to see his doctor. I went to see his doctor, asked him what's going to happen to him... when he lands that rocket car over there across the gorge... - ...how hard it's gonna hit. - Sonny, what is he talking about? He's talking about $50,000 over and above what I'll make on this picture. Besides, I can't let that kid do the stunt alone. The kid? What...? What is this? You've got Ski in this crazy thing now? No, Gwenny, it's the other way around. The kid's got him. - Will you butt out? - I told you that kid was gonna get you killed. Sonny, you told me you were quitting after this picture... so you could trade it off against doing this stunt. True? You're crazy, you know that? I'll tell you one thing. You're crazy. - I don't want to hear your... - No! - Dumb jackass! - Shut your drunken mouth! - Listen, don't mess up my wardrobe. - Hey! Sonny! Oh. Hundred and seventy-two motion-picture fights. That's the first time he ever hit me. That son of a bitch can hit. Heh. - Cully, I'm so sorry. - Oh, he didn't mean it. If he had meant it, he'd have hit a lot harder. He's hurting, Gwenny. He's got a lot of things on his mind. Oh, Cully. - Sonny. - Mm? Sonny, will you go home now? Why? Please? Sonny. I'm sorry. Heh, heh. Sonny, what are you trying to prove? Let me ask you something, Debbie. This is a big town, isn't it? - I mean, Los Angeles is a big town. - Yeah. Well, why the hell does this bar close before the bars in Tulsa? Can you answer me that? I don't know, Sonny. Hey, let's go somewhere and have some breakfast. You want to? I can't do that. Let's go somewhere and have some lunch. I can't do that either. Well, let's go somewhere and jump each other's bones. - That is tempting, Sonny. Yeah. - Is it? - But you know why I can't do it? - Why? Because my husband is so jealous and so near. And so big. Sonny... - Hey. - Huh? When you get so drunk you make a pass at Debbie in my presence... - ...it's time for me to call you a cab. - Yeah. You don't call me a cab. I am a cab. You don't need to call me a cab. I'm perfectly able to take a walk or ride... or fly or whatever. Anything you want me to do, I can do. - I'm perfectly coordinated. - Sonny. So bye-bye and so long. You said you could do it. I rewrote the script because you said you could do it. We rearranged the shooting schedule. We spent a damn fortune preparing for that stunt... because you said you could do it. - I was wrong, Roger. I'm sorry. - You were wrong. He was wrong, Max. He's sorry. He blows the whole goddamn movie and he says, ""Gee, I was wrong. Sorry."" Okay, okay. New business. - Ski does it with someone else, that's all. - Why don't you forget it, Roger? I never liked the damn gag anyhow. - Who else can do the stunt? - Buddy Joe can do it. - He's not available. - Who else? Nobody. - What do you mean, nobody? - I mean nobody. It's a very complicated stunt. There's maybe three guys that can do it, and we're not available. Ski will do it solo with a dummy, then. Goddamn, Roger. If you knew what the hell you were talking about... you'd realize it takes two guys to do the stunt. One guy to drive, one guy to read the instruments. And I'm telling you that Ski isn't qualified. Max, does this man still have a job on this picture? Sonny works here as long as I say so. Or as long as Sonny wants to. Thank you, Max. Now, if Sonny says Ski can't do it, I believe him. It's only a damn movie anyhow, for God's sake. Only a movie? I want you to call the studio brass. I want you to tell them and their stockholders, distributors... and the bank that it's only a movie. Will you do that, Max? I want you to tell them, ""Forget about all your money. It's only a movie."" I'll tell them that no damn movie is worth a man's life! And I'll tell them unless I can shoot this picture the way I want to... and that means this stunt, then I take a walk. And we'll see who walks, Mr. Berns, you or I. I'm sorry, Max. Ah, what the hell, Sonny. What the hell. You know the old saying: You'll never work in this town again. Unless they need you. - Here you go, Cully. - Thanks. A Coke? - If you're still mad, I can just leave... - Shut up and sit down. Kind of early in the day for that hard stuff, isn't it? I'm working out my left arm this morning. I'll get around to my right arm this afternoon. You heard what's happening, haven't you? I'll tell you what's happening. That new kid, Ski? Well, they've got him gaffing the show. You know what else? I'll tell you what else. They canceled that car stunt. At least temporarily. You were absolutely right, it's a two-man stunt. Ain't nobody crazy enough to ride with that kid, with a rocket strapped to his butt. And you can bet your ass, your cowboy hat and your house cat... they're gonna be coming after you to get you to do the stunt. You gonna do the stunt? You know what, Cully? There's a whole new breed of stuntman coming along. They're younger and... stronger... tougher than us. They don't take pills, they don't drink... they don't... They don't take shots. They use little pocket calculators. If we don't watch out, they're gonna blow us right out of the tub. You didn't answer my question. Are you gonna do the stunt? Boy, I never realized there were so many gags at the end of the picture. So involved. Fire gags, the whole town being blown up, 50 stuntmen doing falls. All right, Max. What's the real reason you came out here? To ask me to come back and gaff the show? No, it's the rocket-car gag, Sonny. - The rocket car? - It's a two-man job, just like you always said. Nobody in town will touch it. - Roger's worried that Ski will get hurt. - That's a lot of bullshit. Roger's worried about getting his shot. Roger's worried about finishing his picture. So he talked you into coming out here to ask me to come back and do the gag. You tell Roger to go sit on a short stick. - If you won't do it for Roger... - I'll do it for you? - I'd appreciate it. - You'd appreciate it? What happened to you, Max? You used to be tough. Nobody could tell you how to make a picture. And nobody got hurt on your pictures. If I don't deliver this picture... I'll be the producer who blew the biggest and hottest project in town. All washed up. Finished. I'm too old to go back to selling door-to-door. Okay, Max. You got me. You gonna do it? Yeah. I'm gonna do it. I won't be here when you get back. - Hey, Sonny! How you doing, my man? - Jeffrey. - Gary. - How's it hanging, Sonny? - Hi, Sonny. Max said you were coming in. - Danny. Nice to see you back. What do you think of my baby? It's big. Looks like one of King Kong's suppositories. - How you doing, Ski? - Fine, Sonny. How about you? Good. Let me tell you guys how this thing works. Now, Sonny, your job is to dial up the pressure. You'll need 1500 pounds, and that leaves Ski free to drive. When the pressure's right, hit the switch, and you are gone. - How's it handle? - Haven't driven it yet. - Let's try it out. - I heard that. How's it feel? Pulls a little to the left. Anything else? That cigarette lighter don't work. You just better hope that that cigarette lighter works. We'll be following the explosive truck. The driver will jump out, and it'll blow. Supposed to collapse the bridge from the super structure to the other bank. You figure out on that pocket calculator how many G's we're pulling when we land? Eight to 10 if we land on our wheels. We gotta make sure we hit the ramp just right... otherwise it'd veer off one way or the other... or could just go head first into that bank. - If that happens, there's just one thing to do. - What's that? Put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye. It's a piece of cake. I'll buy you a drink. You don't drink, do you? I'm willing to start. Damn good time to do it. You know... all this hanging around with you, I think you're starting to rub off on me. - How's that? - Well, a couple ways. Excuse me. My first marriage, you know, is more than likely in the shitter. Oh, yeah. And I'm learning to drink and liking it. Yeah, well... my present relationship is not good. Actually, it's in the shitter too. Well, what the hell is it about stuntmen... and their wives and relationships? I don't know. It's a little like drinking and driving. Eventually there's gonna be a hell of a wreck. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Oh, hey. - Is this your car? - Yeah. - Looks pretty fast. - Looks ain't deceiving. From the looks of them beer cans, I'd say you two guys were a little drunk. Like I said, looks ain't deceiving, you old fart. Better let me handle this. I hope you guys ain't planning on doing any more driving. We're not gonna do any more driving. I just called my mother. And she's gonna come out here and pick us up and take us home. I'm gonna leave the car here and go home with her. - Your mother? - Yeah. I hope you're right. Old fart. So the queen says to the photographer: ""I got a brother-in-law that's a photographer."" The photographer says, ""So? I've got a brother-in-law that's a queen."" Oh. Look what we got here. Howdy, old fart. Afternoon, officer. Nice day, isn't it? Pull up, right over there! - What's that? - I said, pull over up front! - Pull over up front, that's what I said! - Gotcha. Shall we? Say goodbye to the nice officer. Bye-bye, nice officer. Great God almighty! Headquarters! Never mind. All right, Tony, I'm coming down. Get Hooper and Ski ready, will you? All right, move it out of here. The helicopter's coming down. Tony, do I have to do everything myself? Get those people out of here. Hooper! Ski! Get over here. Roger wants you. Let's go, let's go! Over here! We'll be putting away this thing here. We're gonna blow all this up. As you remember, it's a giant earthquake, you know, with fires, explosions... buildings falling everywhere, chaos, terror... and you'll be driving through it. It has a nice grayness, like La Strada. All right, I'll be in the chopper for all of this. And we start back there at the administration building. When the earthquake hits, we collapse the building. That's a great idea, Roger. That's gonna look terrific on film. Now, this gas station is where... you'll force one of those cars chasing you to hit those pumps... and that'll set off our main tank. Sensational idea, Roger. It's the only way it can be filmed. Actually, you're quite wrong, Tony. There are several ways of doing it, but this is undoubtedly the best. All right, Sonny, I'm depending on you. I want some good stunts, some cars skidding, other cars crashing into each other... but these smokestacks are important. When they fall, they demolish everything. They've got to just miss your car. That is crucial... because we can't put those stacks back together again. That's right, Roger. Here's where you find the explosives truck that blows the bridge... and of course, your car will have to jump the river. We'll go over here where we can get a good view of the jump. - It's good to see you. - You've come for the jump, right? - Yeah. - It's gonna be neat. Later. Hey, Gwen. Gwen. Do you want to see him? No. Afterward. Roger wants to talk to you guys. Yeah, Roger? All right, Ski, Sonny, this is Roger. You boys ready? - We were born ready. - Wonderful. Let's try one, shall we? One's all you get, hoss. - Good luck, guys. - Hold this while we're gone, will you? Remember, people, no one ever won an Oscar for second best. So get ready. - All right, this is it. Roll the cameras. - Speed. - Rolling cameras one through five. - Six through nine. - Eleven and 12. - Action! Go, go, go! We're up to pressure, 1500 pounds. Goddamn. Cliff was working overtime. We're losing... We're losing some pressure. - Well, stick the thing up to full power! - I already did that! It's down, 1400 pounds. - It just ain't enough. - It better be. Good, boy. You're doing great. Woo-hoo! Holy shit. Your speed is right on. - I love it! I love it! Ha-ha-ha! - Whoo! We're down to 1100 pounds pressure. - We're in trouble now. - Goddamn it, Sonny. One more curve and they're gonna blow that bridge all to shit! Get on it, son! Put the pedal to the metal! Get onto that explosives truck's ass! What the hell's the matter? - Haven't got enough pressure. - Screw the pressure! What is happening? What the hell is going on down there? Keep rolling, goddamn it! My life's worth more than a piece of film. I'll tell you exactly what your life is worth. Your life is worth $50,000. The price you put on it when you got behind this wheel. Sonny, Ski, if you do not try to make this jump... you'll never work in this town again. Is that...? - We're going, huh? - We're going, yeah, we're going. Heh. You're crazy. - I'm gonna hit it. - Whoo! Whoo! I just don't believe it. Cut, cut, cut! And print, goddamn it! Get me down. - Get that door open! - And get that crowbar over here! - Let me get in there. - Can't get it open. Get away. Sonny, are you all right? Sonny, are you all right? Sonny! Jesus, Sonny! - Yes, I know, I know, I know. - He made it across! Sonny. Sonny. Hey, hey, hey! That was a hell of a jump! Make room for Jocko. - I'd like to take another look at that spot. - Yeah, from this side. You're just the greatest. I love you both. - Gwen. Gwen, that was his best stunt ever. - It was his last, Max. - Zoom! - Wild stunt. Max, Max, we did it. We just filmed the most extraordinary stunt of all time, and we got it. - Tony? - Yeah, Max? You're fired. Right, Mr. Berns. Spectacular. Wonderful. I knew you could do it. I never saw anything like it. It was wonderful. What can I say? It was wonderful. Hooper, can I speak to you for a sec? Look, I know we didn't get along on this picture. I also know you think I'm a tyrannical egomaniac. Well, maybe it's true... but films are tiny pieces of time... and we captured it. I only do it for one reason. To make the best movie I can... because I'm a pro just like you. I'm also big enough to apologize... and I know you're big enough to accept. Well, Roger... as usual... you're wrong., Here's our stop, come on. This time next week... California! You excited? Me, too. I can't wait. Were you ever there? Once, for six weeks, touring with some musical. In the middle of December we went swimming. - Which musical? - What's the difference? I'm tryin' to tell you how beautiful it's gonna be. We're gonna look for a little house way up in the hills. Near the movie studios? Yes, your window will face Warner Bros. You can watch them blow up the world from your bed. All right? Oh, God. Can you imagine your very own orange tree? And lemons! I think the musical was Fiddler on the Rool. I stayed with Grandma. I was 4. You were never 4. You were born 26! Do you think I'll be in the same grade? Of course you will! Everything's the same out there, only it's three hours earlier. You'll graduate younger. A girl from California's in our class. She went to school with Helen Reddy's daughter. What about you? After this picture they'll be saying: ""There goes Tony DeForrest's little girl."" Yeah, but he's not a star, he's just an actor. Stars have to be actors first. - And he's not really my father! - You're such a stickler for details! Can I show Tony all my things first? Later. You have homework to do. We're moving in four days. Do I have to do homework? Suppose between now and Friday they teach brain surgery? I wouldn't want you to miss it. We had it last week in science. - Are you serious? - Dumb! You know you're dumb! I thought maybe in frog dissection. What do I know? Can I just show him my new sweater and jeans? All right! But wash your face and brush your hair. And no makeup! Tony? Sweetheart? You in the bathroom? We cleaned out Alexander's! We bought everything on sale... ...so you'd better like it 'cause we can't exchange it. I bought you a present. Babe? Come out and see! Babe? Oh, my God! What happened? He's gone! He left without us! For California? For Italy. - Can I read it? - Yeah. ""Dear Paula, this isn't an easy letter to write."" Doesn't start off too good, does it? ""Where in the hell do I begin? ""You know, you and the kid mean a lot to me."" The kid? ""I turned down the job in L.A. It was just a lousy TV picture anyway. ""On Monday, Stan Fields called. ""I got the Bertolu..."" Bertolucci. ""Bertolucci picture."" - Who's Bartolucci? - An Italian director. What'd he direct? What are you asking questions like that now for? ""It's six months shooting in Spain and Italy. ""It's a hell of a part, and I want it. I broke my ass..."" - Give me that! - ""Ass!"" I've heard the word before. ""I broke my ass for 12 years and things are finally beginning to break for me. ""I told you when you first moved in here that it was never going to be permanent. ""I'm not even divorced from Patti yet."" Who's Patti? - I told you about her. - No, you didn't. I thought you would be upset if you knew you were living with a married man. I wasn't living with him, you were. I was in the next room. They were practically divorced. ""I left early today because I didn't think a goodbye scene would do us any good."" This is one of the worst letters I've ever read in my whole life. Isn't it terrible? ""I wish I had something to leave you and the kid."" He didn't leave us anything? ""I had to sell my watch and camera to pay off the loan sharks."" He owed money to sharks? I'll explain it some other time. ""But I know you'll be all right. You can always go back to dancing."" Dancing? I'm 33. I can hardly walk anymore. ""You deserve more than I can give. ""I wish the both of us all the luck in the world. - ""Love to the kid."" - Don't read anymore. There's just one more word: ""Tony."" Throw it away! Does this mean we're not going to California? Yes. That means I have to do my homework, right? I see you, Paula. You can't hide from me! Down, up and over. Once again! What have you done to your body? It died! Have a little respect. Once again. Come on, Paula, push. Paula? Donna. Donna Douglas. I was the swing girl when you were in Company. Oh, yes! Hello, Donna. Tough getting back into shape? It's been two years. It's amazing how flabby you get when you're happy. Hi, Mrs. Crosby. You leavin' tonight or in the mornin'? I'm sorry, what was that? Just checkin' on what time you'll be vacatin'. We're not going to California. I forgot to tell you. I'm not the only one you forgot to tell! That apartment's been sublet. Wait a minute! What? What are you talking about? We're paid up through June. We have three more months. You can't sublet that apartment! I'm not! Your young man did, honey. He sublet our apartment? He notified me last night. It's his name on the lease. He can do what he wants. Make sure you leave it like you found it. I'm not leaving it! I cleaned it and painted it and decorated it! It's mine! I don't care what he's done! I'm not getting out! Do you understand? That's none of my business, honey! You can take that up with the sublettee. I just don't want no trouble in my building. That bastard! That no good bastard! Who's that? I don't know. Maybe it's Tony! Maybe he changed his mind and came back. You're so young. Stay there. Who is it? Elliot Garfield. Who? Elliot Garfield, from Chicago! Is Tony in? There's nobody by that name here. Wait a second. 3A, this is the right apartment. I was here once about two years ago. I don't care what apartment you've got, there's no whatever-his-name-is here. Could you open the door for a second? Not at 12:05. You got a latch, you can keep it on. I just want to talk to you for one second. Make it fast. My husband's sleeping. I think there's been a mistake. I sublet this apartment from a friend of mine, Tony DeForrest. - He lives here. - That'll be news to my husband, Charlie. I have a receipt here in my pocket for three months rent. I was supposed to arrive tomorrow, but I came a day early... ...because I'm starting work in the morning and I figured I could spend the night here. You look confused. Can I talk to your husband? He'll be at the 37th Precinct at 9:00 in the morning. Charlie D'Agostino, Homicide. Good night. Who was it? Never mind. Didn't sound like a ""never mind"" to me. Tony rented the apartment to someone, but I'm not giving it up. It's ours. Go to sleep. He rented the apartment. You mean we have to leave? Over my dead body. What if they force us? Let 'em try. Go to sleep. He rented the apartment. What a shitheel! - Hello? - Hello. Is Tony there, please? Who's calling? You know who's calling. I was just there. I recognize your voice, Mrs. D'Agostino! Mrs. Who? D'Agostino! How come your telephone answers to Tony DeForrest's number? And how come the key he sent me Air Mail special delivery opens your door? You want to answer those questions? - No. Why don't you answer? - I will. I think the answer is something fishy's going on up there! I'm wet as a herring, Mrs. Whatever-your-name-is... ...and I don't have a place to sleep tonight. And I don't want to blow my last few bucks on a hotel! According to my non-waterproof watch... ...it's at least 12:20 and technically that apartment belongs to me. Do I come up there now and we discuss this amicably... ...or do I storm the place in the morning? I've got a gun! I'll use it if I have to! Change? You got change for $1? Goddamn it! I got a pregnant wife in the lobby. I just want change... We're in trouble, right? We're not in trouble. We have our rights. Possession is nine-tenths of the law. What's the other tenth? Shut up. - Is that the last tenth? - Go to bed. I will handle this. Hello? I called the 37th Precinct. There's no Charles D'Agostino in Homicide. Then I called Rita Scott, an actress friend... ...who was in The Merchant of Venice with Tony DeForrest. Rita told me about a girl Tony's living with, Paula McFadden... ...a former dancer and her 10-year-old daughter. She also told me that the apartment is leased in the name of Tony DeForrest. She knows this for a fact because she lived with him, prior to Paula and Lucy. Now, can we continue this conversation in a drier room, Miss McFadden? Take your problems up with the Housing Authority! Don't hang up! Please? I don't have any more change. I'm soaked to the bone, and I have a very low threshold for disease. Look, I don't know what Tony told you, but... ...he's got my money, and I got a lease, and you got the apartment. Now one of us got screwed! Let me rephrase that. We have to talk this out, and I am in no condition... ...financial or health-wise, to look for a hotel in the pouring rain. If there's any such thing as the 78th St. Flu, I think I've got it. Why not take a shot in a convenient place? Five minutes... ...that's all I'm asking! What is it? In about 30 seconds we're gonna get cut off. My number's 873-5261. It's a flooded booth on Amsterdam Avenue. If you have any compassion in your heart whatsoever... I'm tryin', Operator! Any compassion in your heart, you'll call me back. 873-5261. That number again is 873-52... Oh, shit! Hello, thank you! Five minutes! Leave your bags. This isn't a permanent conversation. - I'm dripping on your rug. - It's been done before. I'm sorry, I didn't know there were going to be any complications. There's a lot of that going around. I don't blame you for being hostile. I get the picture. Tony rented me the apartment and split with the money. Then you and your daughter got dumped on. That is your version. My version is that Tony and I amicably end our relationship. We agreed I'd keep the apartment and you and your $600 got dumped on. - Get the picture? - Very sharp. That's very sharp! You're a sharp New York girl, right? No, a dull Cincinnati kid. But you get dumped on enough, you start to develop an edge. So what's the deal? I got a lease in my pocket. You gonna honor it or what? I got a daughter in my bed. That tops the lease in your pocket. I don't want to get legal. Legal happens to be on my side. I happen to have a lawyer acquaintance downtown. Now all I gotta do is call this lawyer acquaintance of mine... What? An actor. Another goddamn actor! ""I happen to have a lawyer acquaintance."" Right out of Streetcar Named Desire. - Stanley Kowalski in summer stock, right? - Wrong! Chicago in the dead of winter. Three and a half months at the Drury Lane Theater. Ask an actor a question, you get his credits. Reviews? ""Garfield brings to Kowalski dimensions even Brando hadn't investigated!"" Terrific! You write beautifully! Aren't you a little short to play Stanley? Nobody noticed. I stood on a table. Are you a critic? No, I love actors, as long as they stay up on the stage where they belong. You put them down in real life and the whole world gets screwed up. Well, I have had enough! I am not getting kicked out of the same lousy apartment twice. You want your money back, go to Naples. You want this apartment, buy me two tickets to California. I'll give you two minutes to think it over before I yell rape. You are really somethin', you know that? I'm surprised Tony didn't take a job in the Philippines. I hope you're thinking, 'cause I'm counting. Will you wait a second? Just hold it! Can we make a deal? - What kind of a deal? - I don't know, I just got here. - Can I have a cup of coffee? - No! Don't be bashful, just say what's on your mind! All right, here is the situation... I know the situation! Let me say it out loud. I don't believe this myself! Number one, I have a job off-Broadway but no place to sleep tonight. Number two, you don't have any money, but you've got my apartment. And you have a daughter to think about. I am thinking of her right now! Do me the courtesy of hearing me out! Please! You are not the only one who can scream ""rape,"" you know. We are both in a bind, the two of us. I think the only practical solution is that we share the apartment. I accept. What? I accept. I may be stubborn but I'm not stupid. Mean it? I have a daughter who goes to school and I have to start looking for a job. You have a key! I'd have to stand guard all day long to keep you out. I accept. You win. Get your bags. You get the small bedroom. What the hell am I getting myself into? I'm in the wrong room. Hi, I'm Elliot. Hello. - You must be Lucy. - That's right. Elliot Garfield. I'm moving into the other room. I'm a friend of Tony's. You know, Tony DeForrest. That's nice. - I'm an actor, too. - Yeah? Well, your mother knows. I see. - Guess I'll be seein' you around. - I guess so. Good night. Jesus. Just met Lucy. - What did you tell her? - I was moving into the other room. - She seemed to take it in stride. - You grow up fast in this apartment. The john is right over there. I'll get the rest of her things out in the morning. Would you stop grinding your teeth for two seconds? The noise is driving me crazy. A dripping stranger from Chicago, with a wet beard and dirty shoes... ...moves into my daughter's room and you expect smiles? You're dynamite. I love listening to you. I hate living with you, but your conversation is first-class. This is your room. I do not clean or make beds. You may use the kitchen or the bathroom when I am not in it... ...and wash it up when you are through! You pay for your own food, laundry, linens and phone bills. I would appreciate some quiet between 6:00 and 9:00... ...as that is when Lucy does her homework. I don't care what you drink or smoke... ...as long as it is not grass in front of my 10-year-old daughter. - Do we have everything straight? - No! - No? - I'm not crazy about the arrangements. - You're not? - Definitely not! I'm paying the rent. I'll make the rules. I like to take showers every morning and I don't like panties drying on the rod! I like to cook, so I'll use the kitchen whenever I damn well please. I'm very particular about my condiments, so keep your salt and pepper to yourself! I play the guitar in the middle of the night when I can't sleep. I meditate every morning with chanting and burning incense... ...so if you must walk around I'd appreciate tiptoeing. Also, I sleep in the nude, a-buff-o... ...winter and summer, rain or snow, with the windows open. Because I may have to go to the potty or the fridge in the middle of the night... ...and because I don't want to put on jammies, which I don't own anyway... ...unless you want a thrill, or your girl an advanced education... ...l'd keep my door closed. Them's my rules and regulations. How does that grab you? - If I say no? - I got a lawyer acquaintance downtown! - I accept! - We're movin' along. I don't like it and I don't think I like you! - 'Cause I'm an actor? - Coupled with your personality. That's probably why we were thrown together. One of God's little jests! Now if you'll move your shapely little fanny out of my room... ...l'll unpack and dry my beard. - You forgot to say good night. - I was working on goodbye. Unbelievable! How long is he gonna stay? As long as he lets us. - Go to the bathroom. - I don't have to go now. Then save it till morning. It's not safe out there. Good night. No kiss? I'm angry. I don't want to lose it! Christ! Listen to that. Did that guitar wake you? No, you did. Sorry. Is he gonna play that thing all night? - Put a pillow over your ear. - I'll smother. It's better than that guitar. Who is it? - Very funny. May I come in? - Door's open. - Are you decent? - I am decent. Do you realize it is 3:00 in the morning and my daughter... Jesus Christ, you're naked! I thought you said you were decent. I am decent! I also happen to be naked. Mr. Garfield, I have a growing daughter inside... ...who won't grow on two hours of sleep a night. Do you have to play that thing at this hour? I told you it helps me fall asleep. - Have you ever tried pills? - I don't know how to play ""pills."" It's not hard! You pop them in your mouth and swallow. I am a person of health. I do not put unnatural things in my body. Music is one of nature's sedatives. If you'll listen instead of fighting it, we'd all be asleep in five minutes. However, if you insist, take two sleeping pills... ...and stick one in each ear. He won't stop! I have a lawyer acquaintance, too, I can get. Just take deep breaths, count to 100. I'm sorry, baby. I'm really sorry I got you in the middle of all this mess. What's that? Sounds like God. Boy, does God get up early! I smell strawberries burning. That is incense. What's incense? It is what I am feeling right now. You know it's 5:55... ...in the morning? Isn't there a church where you could do that? You finished? Is that the last chorus? I am in a blissful state, so don't bug me. Is this going to be a regular routine? Guitars at night, humming in the morning? I've been in musicals that didn't have that much music. This morning I start rehearsals for my first New York play. Probably the most important day of my life. Am I nervous? No, I'm not nervous. Because I have meditated, I am relaxed... ...I am calm... ...I am confident. You, on the other hand, have not meditated. Therefore, you are a pain in the ass. Today happens to be a very important day for me, too. I am auditioning for a new musical this morning. I slept 17 minutes last night, thanks to you... ...and with the bags I have under my eyes, unless it is about little old ladies... ...I don't have a chance in hell. Are you listening to me? What is that slop you are putting in my dishes? Granola, wheat germ, soya, lecithin, natural honey. My body is a temple, and I am worshipping it. It's what gives me my energy, my vitality, and my natural disposition. I'm 63 years old, and look at me. Can I fix you a bowl? This isn't going to work. I really don't know you well enough to truly dislike you... ...but you are just too weird to live with. Why don't you try to find another place... ...and I'll pay you the $600 as soon as I get a job? You're forgetting that this is my apartment. You're living here on an Elliot Garfield grant. You ought to try this. It's got whole bran in it. My feeling is your whole problem stems from irregularity. Okay, let's take it from the top. Up the tempo, performance level, please. Paula? Oh, my God. You scared me! I thought it was my turn. Thank you. The boy in the gray slacks, the girl in the green socks... ...and the girl in the red scarf, please. Fred, Valarie and Darina, please wait. The rest of you, thank you very much. - How you feel? - So old. I saw a girl before who goes to Lucy's school. Paul Keiser, Don Wallace, Cynthia Robbins... ...Carla Williams, Susan Weinstein, Donna Douglas... ...and Paula McFadden, onstage, please! - Think positive! - Mention it to my legs. Two rows, please, the girls in the front. Paula, is that you? - Yes. - Ronnie Burns. Ronnie! Hello! I thought you gave all of this up. I did. I just picked the wrong one to give it up for. You been keepin' in shape? Yes, terrific. - You want to show me? - Not unless I can take a written test. Okay, Eddie. Just a few basic, impossible steps, kids, so pay attention. I'll give you the counts first. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, touch, drag. From the top. Up to tempo, performance level, please! Just a minute, please. Robert DeLurie and Cynthia Robbins, please wait. The rest of you, thank you very much for coming in. A little rusty, Paula, but not bad. My problem is I need 'em very young. Young? Okay I'll work on it. The next group, onstage please! Now, what about Richard? The question is... ...and this may seem perfunctory, was Richard actually deformed? Historically, we know he was born with severe curvature of the spine... ...thus giving the impression that he was hunchbacked. There was some paralysis of the left hand and right foot... ...Olivier chose to play the right hand and left foot, God knows why... ...as well as nerve damage to the right cheek and eyelids. The man was your basic gimp! Let's face it. All of which brings us, bless the wise and rich Mrs. Estelle Morganweiss... ...to this production. Is that the way we want to play Richard? If you do, then this director would just as soon... ...do a six-week stint on the Sonny and Cher Show. Richard III was a flaming homosexual. So was Shakespeare, for that matter... ...but the angry mob at the Globe Theatre wasn't going to pay two shillings... ...to see a bunch of pansies jumping about on the stage. It was society that crippled Richard, not childbirth. Read your text. He sent those two little boys up to the tower... ...and nobody ever saw them again. We know why, don't we? What I want to do here is to strip Richard bare, metaphorically. Let's get rid of the hump. Let's get rid of the twisted extremities and show him the way he would be today. The Queen who wanted to be King! - Yes? - Question. Are you serious? What's the objection, Elliot? Number one, I have to play it. Number two, I like the hump and the clubfoot. Number three, I've been workin' on the part for months. I respect that. That's why we're here, isn't it? To exchange ideas. Tell me, how do you see Richard? Mr. Macho? Is that it? I don't think the guy is a linebacker for the Chicago Bears... ...but let's not throw away one of his prime motivations. What's that? He wants to hump Lady Anne! Yes, I've heard that before. I don't want to pressure you. Let's just try it my way. Let's read through the first act. Please, trust me. Act 1. - Scene 1. - Excuse me! Just how far off the diving board do you want me to jump? Don't give me Bette Midler but let's not be afraid to be bold. - Bold? - Bold. ""Act 1, Scene 1. ""Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester."" ""Now is the winter of our discontent Made..."" Sorry. Excuse me. One second. ""Now is the winter... ""Now is the winter of our discontent..."" May I have a five-minute break, please? Five minutes! Five-minute break, everybody! Thirty-nine. Oh, my God. Forty. That's all? I can't do anymore. 60! You said 60! No, the muscles are gone! I can't dance! It was a dumb idea. I am going to put you up for adoption. Get your old mother a Coke. Fattening. Get me the Coke. Mother doesn't want to beat the crap out of you. No willpower! I've died. I've truly died. Enter, sweet Anne. - You live alone? - Yeah! Fortunately, the other people who live here also live alone. Let me take your coat. Thanks. Hey, Lucy, this is Rhonda. Rhonda, Lucy. Lucy, Rhonda. - Hello. - Hi. What are you doin'? Sitting on my mother. Sounds like fun. You want to keep it down? Rhonda and I will be workin' in my bedroom. See you later. - Good night. - Good night. I'll bet. I heard voices. Was that him? He took two apples. - Did you write it down? - I didn't have a pencil. I told you, write everything down. If he takes a glass of water, write it down. We're not running a hotel. Why don't you like him? Who invited him? That's why I don't like him. If he were a lawyer or a doctor instead of an actor, would you like him? I wouldn't like him if I liked him. He grates on me. I think he's kind of cute. He reminds me of a dog that nobody wants. You are never to think he's cute, never. Why'd he want two apples? One for him, one for her. What her? He's got a girl in there. In my house! A girl in the bedroom? Why didn't you say something? I'm sorry. You want me to write girls down, too? - You knocked? - Can I talk to you in private? It's a bad time. How about at breakfast? Is that a girl in there? I certainly hope so. Not in my house. I won't put up with this sort of thing. What sort of thing? You have a girl in your room and I don't object. This is Paula McFadden. Mac lives just down the bedroom apiece. Mac, this is Rhonda Fontana, a gifted and rising young actress. Don't rise. - Hi. - Hello. Can we talk? This is serious. Take a break! - Out! - Out? Her, out! They have motels for that sort of activity. I have an impressionable 10-year-old daughter... ...and this isn't one of the impressions I want her picking up. Now you get that ""rising young actress"" the hell out of there! Out of where? Out of my rented apartment you're staying in... ...out of the goodness of my heart? I will bring home anyone or anything I choose... ...including a one-eyed Episcopalian kangaroo... ...if that happens to be my kinky inclination. As for what's going on, we're rehearsing Act 1, Scene 4 of Richard III. I have a cretin from Mars directing the play and I need all the help I can get. However, if I choose to attempt to have carnal knowledge of that gorgeous bod... ...that'll be her option, my problem, and none of your business. What do you think was Lucy's impression of what was going on... ...in Momma's bedroom with Tony ""love 'em and leave 'em"" DeForrest? Why don't you turn off some of the lights? We're runnin' up a heck of a bill. You okay? I'm fine. Let's go to sleep. Are you upset because they're messing around in there? They are not messing around. They are doing Act 1, Scene 4 from Richard III. Did it ever bother you about Tony and me? I mean, not being married and living together? No. I wanted to get married. He couldn't get a divorce. That's okay. I just wanted to know how you felt. Socks in the hamper, please. Is that song from Richard III? Let's brush our teeth. Oh, God, please let me be hit by... ...a rich man in a Rolls-Royce. I think I can swing that. Thank you. No, I mean it. It's funny you should say that. What did I say? There's an outside chance that I can get us both a job... ...at the Auto Show at the coliseum. It's only two weeks but the money's not bad. Any money's not bad. What do we have to do? Just look pretty, point to the cars and say, ""terrific."" I can do that. I can point and say, ""terrific."" This friend's going to let me know this weekend. Just keep it a little quiet. What a nice person you are. You didn't have to tell me. I feel kind of related. I lived with Bobby all last year. Bobby who? Bobby Kulick, your ex-husband! Oh, Bobby. The marriage slipped my mind. ""...as you are weary of the weight, ""Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse. ""Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down. ""What black magician conjures up this fiend, ""To stop devoted charitable deeds? ""My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass. ""Unmanner'd dog! Stand thou, when I command: ""Advance thy halberd higher than my breast, ""Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot..."" My careereth is over. I am making a horseth asseth of myselfeth! - What? - Mark, I'm begging you! You want this kind of performance, let me play Lady Anne. All right, let's take five, everyone! Five minutes. You're unhappy, Elliot? Unhappy? No. I am freaking petrified. The critics are going to crucify me, Mark... ...and gay liberation's gonna hang me from Shakespeare's statue by my genitalia! You gotta help me, Mark! - What do you want, Elliot? - I want my hump back! I want my clubfoot! I want a little paralysis in my right hand. I don't mean a lot, just a little. Two stiff fingers, a little motivation. I see. You want to play it safe. You want to give us your standard, conventional Richard. I can't argue with that. They've been doing it that way for 400 years. What do I know? I'm lucky to get the part! I know that. I come from Chicago! We do things a little differently there. We do the play as written. That doesn't go over in New York. Terrific. I respect you, Mark. I do. You've done off-Broadway, I haven't. I'm not a quitter. You want me to do Richard III like Tatum O'Neal, I'll do it. Just don't let me look foolish out there. You feel foolish? I feel like an asshole! I passed foolish on Tuesday. - We have to trust each other, Elliot. - I do. - I was never going to let you do it like that. - Thank God! But do you see where I'm heading? I'm trying, Mark. Richard was gay, there's no doubt about it. Let's use that as subtext. We'll keep it, but now we can put back the hump and the clubfoot. - And the twisted fingers? - If you like. I love 'em. I'm crazy about 'em! Then use them, baby, and you'll see what I'm after. Just try it my way. I will never let you go wrong. Haven't we met in our apartment? Please. I enjoy shopping. Don't ruin this for me, too. Relax. We don't have to fight until we get home. - We need soap, darling. - Not in my bathroom, you don't. This is silly. If you get what you need and I get what I need... ...we'll blow a lot of bread gettin' the same things, including bread. Why don't we have one shopping list and split the bill? On what items? Food! Bathroom and kitchen cleansers, everything... ...except male and female doodads. In that area, you go your way and I go my way. We split everything? Everything. I'll pay my full one-third share. - One third? - I'm not the one with the daughter. Didn't Lady Anne wash her hands the other night? Quick. I like a quick girl. Okay, right down the middle. Okay. Hold it! I'll take care of that. Good idea, sharing expenses. By the way, I need shoes next week. A little Chianti? Can't have Spaghetti Marinara without a little vino. - You can on my budget. - I'll blow for the booze. Short of stature but not tight of pocket. I'll be right out. A bottle of your finest cheap Chianti, please. I have a nice California red for $1.80. - Right. Nothing from Kansas? No, seriously, this is a nice red. - This goes with spaghetti? - Perfect with spaghetti. Thank you. It's under $2.00, right? Yeah, $1.80 is pretty much under $2.00, as far as I know. - All right, thank you. - Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Take care. What the... They took my bag! They took my bag! What? Who? In the car. They grabbed my bag. Jumped out and grabbed it! - It had everything in it! - Those dirty bastards! Aren't you gonna go after them? After a speeding car? Thanks a lot! But they could be armed! Do you want me to fight with a can of tomato paste? Just leave me alone! I think you ought to call the police and report it. I could call 'em for you. I wish you were that helpful while I was being robbed! What do you want from me anyway? I'm not a German Shepherd. Oh, my God, it's them! - Who? - The ones who took my bag! Stop! Where are you going? What is this, Police Woman? Get out of the way! I'm gonna get a bullet between my goddamn eyes! Somebody, stop those men! Wait! Give me the bag! I'm not afraid of you guys! Get out of the car! I was just askin'. Relax! Just a simple question... Thank you very much. I had all my money in there. Everything. My last dollar in the world. You and your goddamn Chianti. What does Chianti have to do with it? Why can't you at least thank me for risking my life for you? Did you get me my bag back? No. So why should I thank you? Why do I have such lousy luck every time an actor comes into my life? I hate all of you. Get away from me! Just get away. I really don't think they robbed you 'cause I'm an actor. After I graduated from Northwestern, my first summer job was in Lake Michigan. I did ten plays in ten weeks. I really worked like a dog. I had hepatitis and mumps and never knew it. I thought I was just getting yellow and fat. Which plays? First play was Inherit the Wind. I played the reporter. Gene Kelly did in the movie. Right. Very good. He did a very nice job, too. He didn't dig as deeply as I did. Next I did Cyrano de Bergerac. Jos Ferrer. I saw it last week on Channel 9. I used half the nose, got twice the laughs. It's style that counts, darling, it is not makeup. You don't think much of yourself, do you? Pound for pound, I got the biggest ego this side of St. Louis. You gotta see the face to appreciate the work. What else? I taught drama for a semester at Duluth Junior College. - You taught drama? Far out! - Very far out. It's up near Canada. You want some more wine? - Niente on the Chianti. - That's good. You're terrific with words. - You always pick the right ones. - Words are the canvas of an actor. His lips are his brushes, and his tongue, the colors of the spectrum. And when he speaks, he paints portraits. - He's very classy! - The kid's got a good eye. Not like Tony. He wasn't a classy actor. He was just, you know... sexy! You don't think I'm sexy? Are you kidding? What do you know? You're 10 years old. In three years, I'll drive you out of your bird! - It's after 9:00, do your homework. - Five more minutes! Talk more. We never had a good talkin' like this at dinner. Then I played Midsummer Night's Dream on public television in Chicago. I played the part Mickey Rooney did in the movie. - Puck! - Right! A lady producer from New York called me... ...and asked me to come to New York and play Richard III off-Broadway. And not off-Broadway, it's off off off-Broadway. Are we invited to the opening? Do you really want to come? The two of you. It's Tuesday night. Tuesday's a school night. We went to Tony's opening on a school night. I said ""no."" Shit! Shoot! I'm sorry. I think I'm in trouble. Good night. Would you be interested in my bedroom? Talkin' to me? You can have the big bedroom for an extra $50 a month. Payable in cash right now. We'll move into yours in the morning. You mean a rent increase for getting what I should have gotten in the first place? No, thank you. Would you be interested in lending me $50? I'll either pay you 7.5 percent interest or do your laundry. Take your pick. They really cleaned you out? Everyone from here to Italy. I have $28 in change. I'll split it with you. And starting opening night I get $240 a week, so I'll make a deal. I'll pay all the living expenses until you get yourself a job... ...and I'll even do my own laundry. I see. And what do you get? All you gotta do is be nice to me. You go to hell! Will you listen very carefully to me? This may be the last time I talk to you. Not everyone is after your magnificent body. In the first place, it's not so magnificent. It's fair, but it ain't keepin' me up nights. I don't even think you're very pretty. Maybe if you smiled... ...but don't go against your religion! And you aren't the only person in this city to get dumped on! I myself am a recent dumpee! I am a dedicated actor, Paula. I am dedicated to my art and my craft. I value what I do. Because of a mentally arthritic director, I'm about to play... ...the second greatest role in the history of the English-speaking theatre... ...like a double order of fresh California fruit salad! When I say ""nice,"" I mean nice! You know, decent and fair. I deserve it, 'cause I'm a nice, decent and fair person. I don't want to jump on your bones! I don't even want to see you in the morning. I'll tell you what I do like about you. Lucy! Lucy's your best part! Lucy is worth puttin' up with you for. So, here is $14 for the care and feeding of that terrific kid. You get zip-a-dee-do-dah! You want any money, borrow it from your 10-year-old daughter! I'm now going inside my room to meditate away my hostility towards you. Personally, I don't think it can be done! ""And still, as you are weary of the weight, ""Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse. ""Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down. ""What black magician conjures up this fiend, ""To stop devoted charitable deeds? ""My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass. ""Unmanner'd dog! Stand thou when I command: ""Advance the halberd higher than my breast..."" Good! Good! ""I would they were, that I might die at once; ""For now they kill me with a living death. ""Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn the salt tears, ""Shames their aspect with store of childish drops: ""These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear, ""No, when my father York and Edward wept... ""To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made..."" What is it? - Am I disturbing you? - Yes! - I'm sorry. - Then don't disturb me! - You don't have to snap at me. - I wasn't snapping! I was sarcastic! Snapping is, ""Bug off, I'm busy!"" Get the difference? - What's wrong? - What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. What makes you think something's wrong? You open Richard III in front of New York critics, with a chartreuse hump. You play Richard with a crippled, paralytic hand and pink polish on your nails! I'm trying to figure out how to save my goddamn career, that's what's wrong! What do you want? No, don't tell me. I know. I dipped into your peanut butter, right? How much do I owe you for a finger-full of chunky Skippy spread? I just came back to pay you your $14. I got a job. And also to ask you if you happen to have some bicarbonate. Lucy's sick. What's wrong? She had two double-chocolate sundaes for dinner. It's my fault, I ordered them. You're incredible! I'm surprised they don't sell insurance policies to children! - Is that bicarbonate? - Don't start with me! How's it feelin', Luc? - Did you see The Exorcist? - Yeah. Then you'd better get out of the room. You're going to be okay. Turn over on your back. Relax. Come on, don't you trust me? I trusted my mother today and look how I feel. I want you to take slow, deep breaths. Go on. Now. That's it. Watch. You think you can do this? I might be able to manage it. Eyes closed, Luc. Keep breathing deeply. Deep breath. That's it. How's the play going? One sick person at a time. Close your eyes. - Feeling any better? - A little. Isn't this more soothing than medicine? It tastes better, too. Can we go to the opening? You still owe me a present. Today was the pits. Sure. Anything you say. Terrific. Now you have to get me a dress. Thank you. I'm really sorry about yesterday. It was very generous of you. I'm not used to the kindness of strangers. I know, don't say it. Blanche DuBois in Streetcar. Sometimes I feel just like her. You start to trust a man and they take you away at the end of the movie. Anyway... I'm sorry for... Well, I'm just sorry. If you're listening, this is my attempt at being nice, decent and fair. How am I doing? Mr. Garfield? Wake up. You can't sleep with my daughter. Upstairs to the right. Thank you. I hope this will be funny. Is it a musical comedy? - It's Shakespeare. - Boring! Look at the stubs and find our seats. Over here. Wait. It's so exciting! Wait until you see it. It is so contemporary and thrilling. ""Now is the winter of our discontent ""Made glorious summer by this sun of York; ""And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house ""In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. ""Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; ""Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; ""Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,"" Sounds like that guy in the beauty parlor. ""Be patient, they are friends... ""...Ratcliff... ""...and Lovel. ""Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, ""The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings. ""I took him for the plainest harmless creature ""That ever breathed upon this earth a Christian; ""Made him my book...

My kingdom for a horse! ""Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse. ""Slave!"" Bravo! But did you really love it? I mean, really, really love it? It was very interesting. Oh, God! Everybody, she loved it! My mother loved it! Right through all those people. Thank you. Thank you. We're all so excited. I have a feeling he'd rather be alone, Luc. He'll know we thought it was lousy if we don't say hello. All right, but try and be tactful. What's tactful? Lie! Hello! Mr. Garfield? It's Lucy and me! We just came back to tell you how much we enjoyed it. I had the best time. At first I thought it would be boring, but then it picked up near the end. Okay, Luc. We won't keep you. We just wanted to thank you for the tickets and a lovely evening. People were talking about you on the way out. They wanted to remember your name so they'd never forget it. Good night. I thought you were wonderful. Peter? You won't believe it. I think I've got it sold. Are you okay? God, are you all right? Thou hast broken thy vase. Thou owest thee... ...$12.98, plus taxes. Are you okay? Not according to the Times! Have you read the Times? Can I get you a cup of coffee? What are you doing? The Times said: ""Elliot Garfield researched Richard III... ""...and discovered him to be England's first... ""...badly-dressed interior decorator."" Tasty writing! I never listen to critics. Thank God. Do you want to go on for me tomorrow night? Daily News said... Here, read it. ""It never occurred to us that William Shakespeare wrote... ""...The Wizard of Oz. ""However, Elliot Garfield... ""...made a splendid Wicked Witch of the North."" - Tacky! - Oh, God. Tacky! If you're gonna kill me... - ...kill me with panache. - I am really sorry. What the hell! It's only a... It's only a little New York debut, you know? Ames, Iowa is where it really counts. You don't make it in Ames, then you got career trouble. Oh, my God! Channel 5 was honest. Direct and honest. ""Richard III stunk! ""Elliot Garfield was the stinky..."" Am I in bed? 'Cause if I'm in bed... ...the springs are shot. I thought you didn't put unhealthy things into your body. I don't. I was putting them into Richard's, trying to kill the son of a bitch! Please, you've got to go to bed. This furniture isn't mine. Do you think I'm defeated? Do you think I'm discouraged? Do you think I'm upset over 14 unimportant, negative reviews? You bet your ass I am, baby! Sorry. This apartment is rated P.G. I keep forgetting. You were wonderful tonight. Really. I was an Elizabethan fruit fly. I was the Betty Boop of Stratford-on-Avon. I was putrid! Capital ""P"", capital ""U"", capital ""Trid!"" I thought it was an interesting interpretation. Bullshit! You didn't see their faces. When I walked out onstage... ...210 people looking like they just got a shot of Novocaine. Tell me the truth. I want the truth, say it! Say it, or I'll smash this priceless $9.00 lamp all to pieces! Was I putrid or was I not? Say it! Yes, you were putrid! You don't have to be so blunt about it. I'm sorry. Give that to me. Thank you. Though I had some good moments now and then. Like walking on and walking off. The rest was cacca! Are you sure I can't get you anything? - Some of your health vitamins? - No, don't walk out on me, please! Once a night is enough. I'm here. I'm listening. I can play that part, you know. I can play the hump off that guy. I was better on the bus coming from Chicago... ...than I was on that stage tonight. ""Now is the winter of our discontent ""Made glorious summer by this sun of York; ""And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house ""In the deep bosom of the ocean buried"" Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera... That is good. It's wonderful. Honestly. Thank you. You're welcome. You're really not such a bad person after all. Thank you. But that ""putrid"" remark really hurt. That really got to me. I know. I don't know what came over me. You try and get some sleep now, okay? Don't tell Lucy about the Times. I won't. Or the News. Or Channel 5. Or Channel 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11. I won't. - Try to get some sleep. - Good night. Good night. No autographs, please. ""Now is the winter of our discontent ""Made glorious summer by this sun of York;"" ""One must always respect brave and courageous attempts... ""...to explore Shakespeare through new and daring concepts... ""...and even, if you will, irreverence..."" What's ""irreverence""? You'll find out. ""But Garfield and Bodine's Richard III gives us less than... ""...a summer stock Charley's Aunt, without the good-natured and inoffensive humor."" They didn't like it? The man has two months to live. He's a cynic. Which one of you Scotch-taped my tongue to the roof of my mouth? Would you like some coffee? Not unless it has some bicarbonate. Congratulations! For what? I didn't know what else to say. Why do you let your child read pornography? You want some puffed rice or Cocoa Puffs? Starve a cold, feed a failure, eh? Hello. Yes, just a minute. It's for you. I get the cover of Newsweek? Hello. Hi, Harv. Yeah, I read 'em. I understand. All right, I'll see you later. There you go. The minute you think your world's collapsing, something wonderful happens! What? They closed the show! I don't have to do it anymore. - The American theater is saved. - I'm sorry. It's all for the best. Now I'm free to take that other job. - What other job? - I'm looking. C'mon, Luc, we're late. Get your jacket. Listen, did you know that Spencer Tracy got terrible reviews... ...the first time he was on Broadway? No, he didn't. I thought he did. You know your daughter has a crush on me? I've noticed. How do you feel about that, Mom? Not to take away from your personal charm... ...she had one on Tony, too. They're fickle at 10. And at 6 she had one on her father. Come on. Wait for me downstairs. Why? Because I'm the mother, that's why. What are your plans? You mean my immediate plans? Well, after breakfast I was contemplating an aborted suicide attempt... ...and then think about welfare. You're not going back to Chicago? Chicago? No. Siberia, possibly. - Your room is paid for. It belongs to you. - Thank you. If I decide to leave, I'll give you an address. You can ship it to me. If you stay, I could use some help with Lucy. I won't be back in time to make her dinner. - What I'm saying is... - I accept. Good! She has dinner at 6:00. There are pork chops in the freezer. Have a nice day. Cute. Definitely cute. My name is Donna Douglas. Welcome to the International Auto Show... ...and to the Subaru display. How many of you have wondered how the U.S. Ski team... ...those champs of the downhill, get to the top of those steep hills? The Subaru engine gives you 39 miles per gallon in highway driving... ...and 29 miles per gallon in city driving, extraordinary performance. The SEEC-T is a lean-burn approach to combustion engines... ...and a spectacular design then eliminates the need for power and fuel... Mommy! ...eliminates the need for power and fuel-robbing things. The Subaru gives great performance plus better mileage... ...with less emission from your... She's up. The front window is clearly visible and was designed for maximum visibility... ...whether one is looking to the right or to the left, or straight ahead. I'm beginning to think my Richard wasn't that bad. - That woman! - She must be confused! The rear window is also designed for maximum visibility... ...if one is looking out the back. - Gee, that's a problem. - I'm going to go tell her! The tires are optional and attractive... ...and Consumer's Guide says that the Subaru is a remarkable economy car. Thank you very much. And now I'd like to introduce you to the rest of the Subaru line... Time out, one minute. Un momento. Thanks. I could've gotten fired except they don't know the English word for it. Why are you here? You came to see me act, I thought I'd come see you act. I thought you were good. One constructive comment. Study! Learn your lines. Next year you'll be ready for bigger parts, like trucks and tanks. - Did you have your dinner? - No. No? But it must be after 7:00! What am I paying you for? Paying me? One petrified piece of pork chop and an aging piece of brown celery... ...doesn't constitute payment. Come here. I came to give you the kid. I'm workin' tonight. - He got a job! - Didn't I say that? - Acting? - No, I didn't say that. In the entertainment field. I'll be back 2:00 a.m. Don't wait up! You really look terrific. You're so cute! I never knew you had a figure. The man definitely wears me out! He wears me out, too. Excuse me, gentlemen. That girl impressed me very much with your car. I'm in the taxi business and I'm in the market for an entire fleet. If you think you can handle it, I'd like to come back and discuss details. Hang on to that girl. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Erotic acts! Exotic acts! See sexy, erotic, beautiful girls! Sexy girls! - What kind of show they got? - Very dirty! Filthy show! Next one in ten minutes. - What do they do? - I don't know! It's too dirty for the help. Hey, get out of there! Come on! You want to go inside? Come inside, quick! - What is it? - There's a drunk onstage! Throw that creep out of here! I'm the doorman. When he comes down, I'll open the door. You want to get paid, or not? Which one of you people is causing all the trouble here? You need any help, big fella? Get him out of here! Sit down so we can all enjoy the show. All I want is a kiss. Just one little kiss. I don't even know you and I don't kiss on the first date. They liked us! Get a seat! They liked us! Get rid of that bum! Come here, you little twerp. I'm gonna bust your stupid face! They don't want to see that! You don't want to see the little twerp get his face... Tough crowd. Let's talk this over, okay? We'll talk it over. My name's Tony. What's your name? - Earl. - Earl what? Earl this. It's my first standing ovation. You know what Cynthia Fine said? Who is Cynthia Fine? The girl in my class with the braces and the big chest. Elliot picked me up from school today and Cynthia says he's got charisma. I looked it up and he does. All right, cut it out. Cut what out? Stop trying to make something between us. Me? Cynthia Fine says... Cynthia Fine, my behind! Stop pushing me. Who's pushing? You are. Your fingerprints are all over my back. He's okay, all right? Once in a while he even acts like a regular human being... ...but stop pushing me because that man is not my type. - I heard that. What did you say? - If you heard it, why are you asking? What did you say? I said your type never hangs around long enough to stay your type. That is a rotten thing to say. I know. I just felt like saying it. Sometimes I can be so goddamn furious with you... That was a stinky thing to do! What happened to your eye? I used it to stop a fist from going through my face. Oh, my God. What kind of meat is this? Veal parmesan. It's better than potato salad. - Let me put some ice on it. - I'm out of work again. You two have nothing to worry about anymore. I've decided that you can stay as long as you like. It's my only hope for survival. - Something is bound to turn up. - You think so? Cynthia Fine thinks you've got charisma. ""Charis"" yourself to bed young lady. Put that on your eye. What do you think I've got? Do I ""charis"" you at all? I'm not talking about talent-wise, you dig? Talent-wise, I'm very secure. Just appeal-wise, I'm a little shaky. Come on, you can tell me. I can take it. Am I as adorable as I think I am? You are outrageous! I cannot keep up with your energy. They must pick you up on CB radios in Alaska. You get the feeling something is starting between us? I graduated from high school 16 years ago... ...and that was the last time I heard that line. Out of my way, please. I have to sell my little Japanese cars in the morning. That's why you got the Kabuki makeup on? And you let me stand there. Give me a towel. Don't you ever do that again. Your lips may say no-no, but your eyes say yes-yes. Don't get cute with me! You know your goddamn nose drives me crazy? - What's wrong with my nose? - It's pug. Very pug. It shoots down straight, but then it turns pug at the last second. Don't. - We have a hot infatuation here. - I have no time for romance. I have a daughter to save from rickets. You drove me crazy the first time I saw you through the crack in that door. I said to myself, ""This is the best half a face I ever laid eyes on."" Don't make me laugh. I am not on your side. The smell of your hair drives me nuts, I'm telling you! I could be sleeping, you walk by my door... ...my nostrils wake me up and say, ""Who's that comin' down the street?"" You're embarrassing me. I'm 33. I'm not supposed to get embarrassed anymore. If you were a Broadway musical, people would be humming your face. Please, don't do this. Don't make me feel happy. I hate that ""Goddamn, it's wonderful to be alive"" feeling. Do not come into my life. I just got through putting up fences. Can I walk you to your door? It's a rough neighborhood. Yes, call me Elliot. I've already bitten your neck. Elliot! I am praying to God this is gone in the morning! The hell you are! Meet me in the kitchen tomorrow night. Dress casual. - Where are you running? - I want to see Lucy before she goes to bed. Wait, I have a message for you. The Maserati people are throwing a small party upstairs at 21... ...and that guy, Giorgio, you know the one that smells better than us? He specifically asked for you. ""The girl with the laughing teeth."" I can't. I've got to go home. I don't understand! That guy is gorgeous! He told me to tell you that. If it was any other time... Elliot? Are you up here? Say something. I don't like this. I said it was formal, kid! Party's got to be over by 9:00 a.m. Otherwise, it's another $5 for the suit. Don't panic! Even Ginger was nervous the first time she danced with me. ""How about you? ""I like a Gershwin tune ""How about you? ""I like the fireplace when the lights are low ""I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips ""How about you?"" What are you crying about? So kill me... ...l'm a sucker for romance. Elliot Garfield is a many-faceted individual. I got a job. A real acting job. You did? Where? The Inventory. It's an improvisational group on Charles St. They saw Richard III. They said if I could do that, I could do anything! - Don't let it rain. - Don't worry about it. The suit's too big for me anyway. I auditioned for them today. It's improvisation, you understand. Now, very difficult... ...but I auditioned with this very talented girl, Linda... Is she pretty? No, very unpretty. Very ugly. Unpug-nosed. I played Abraham Lincoln. Mary Todd Lincoln's out of town. General Grant takes me to a cathouse. We're all tryin' to act very dignified... Don't stop, I never danced in the rain! The hell with dancing, my pizza's getting drenched! Wait. I got it. I'll get it. What happened after you found out about this other girl and Tony? - Bobby. Tony comes after Bobby. - Sorry. It happens all the time on the road. He's gone for six months with the play, he gets lonely. The only time you have a good marriage is when your husband is in a flop. He's broke, but he's home. How'd you meet Tony? I'm ashamed to tell you. Why? I saw him in The Iceman Cometh at Circle in the Square. He wasn't very good, but he was gorgeous. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. Don't ask. I waited until he came out of the stage door... ...and I introduced myself, like a regular groupie. A week later I moved in with him. I used to do things like that. Why? When you dance in the chorus of a musical... ...the boys' voices are usually higher than the girls. After ten years of that, you get very hung up on macho men. Thank God I am over that period. I think I'll let that remark pass. Are we gonna sleep with each other tonight? Of all the ""right up front"" girls I know, you are the ""right up frontest."" How do you feel about it? Nervous. A pushover, but nervous. Good morning, everybody. No applause, please. What's new this morning? Nothing's new this morning. Did you hear this kid Lindbergh is gonna try to fly the Atlantic? Who do you think'll play it in the movie? She didn't sleep too well last night. I guess no one did. See you tonight. We've been found out, have we? I thought the kid was rootin' for us. Don't call her ""kid."" She doesn't like to be called ""kid."" Sorry. In Chicago it's an expression of endearment... ...like ""Hiya, kid."" ""How ya doin', kid?"" ""What's wrong, kid?"" Nothing. Really? Glad to hear it. Any buttered toast? She's scared, that's all. Lucy? She's afraid what happened before will happen again. What is it with you two, are you partners? I thought it was just you and me last night. What happens in my life affects hers. And I'm scared too. Would you be terribly hurt if we just forgot all about last night? It's a little late. I've already made an entry in my diary. Look at me. I am standing here with sweaty palms and I have my hands in cold water. I don't know what you're thinking this morning. Instead of asking so goddamn many questions... ...you could at least say to me, ""Last night was wonderful."" Last night was wonderful. Oh, my God. I must be crazy. I keep doing the same damn thing to myself, over and over again. When am I ever going to learn? I am not up to falling in love again. It is too much work. I think we would all be a whole lot better off... ...if you just packed up your things and left. Nothing personal. I think I have a clue now as to why all those other guys left! Crackers! Animal crackers, lady! You got a severe case of emotional retardation! I'm not leaving, Paula! I'm escaping! I will personally forward your mail! Keep it! I'm not giving you a forwarding address! Lot of weirdos in this neighborhood. But just in passing, I'd just like to say that last night was terrific, okay? It was the Super Bowl of romance. I give it a fat nine on a scale of ten. You lose one point for burping your wine, but all in all it was a respectable score. Don't you get glib about last night! It was very important to me! You want to lower your neurosis for a minute, I'm not done. - You want to know what your problem is? - What? You love to love somebody... ...but the minute that they take the initiative, like I did last night... ...that scares the pants off of you! Nothing off-color intended. You didn't wait at any stage door for me. I approached first. I touched first. And you can't handle that, can you? He is laughable. And silly! You are the silliest man I ever met. And you know that I'm right! If you don't let go of me, I'll punch your other eye out! Paula, you know yourself too well to ignore what I'm saying. That is exactly why I am trying to ignore it. You know what we got here? Taming of the Shrew is what we got here. Despite the fact, Kate, you're one large pain in the arse... ...last night was the best thing I ever had, girl-wise. If you weren't behaving like such a horse's rectum... ...we could've been touching and fondling all day... ...until about 5:00 when I got to go to rehearsal! Personally, madam, I think you blew it. Lady Anne! The Black Prince is dead! England is yours! You don't want England? Would you take Spain? Spain I can get you cheap. What are you doing in that thing? Come on, get in quick. The horse has got a meter on him. Where to? ""We're going home, to Tara!"" Get in! Cynthia Fine, right? I think you got charisma too. Lucy! Did you tell him? I never said that! I'm gonna get you, Lucy, you big fink! You want to go to my opening tonight? I owe you a good time after the last one. I have homework. Why are you sore? Me and your mom? It's none of my business. Since you and I are exchanging rooms tonight, I think it is. I'm a little old-fashioned. I want your approval. Me? I'm only 10 years old. I'm not allowed to vote yet. I like your style, kid. I'm sorry. I hear you don't like to be called ""kid."" I'm a kid, it fits. Do you like me? You're wasting money. I'm not enjoying this ride. Answer my question. Do you like me? Ask Cynthia Fine. She's crazy about you. I'm gonna keep asking you until you answer me. - Do you like me? - Can I get out? I'm getting nauseous. Answer my question, goddamn it. Yes or no? It makes no difference to me either way. I'm movin' in with your old lady. I just want to hear it from your own lips. - Now, yes or no? - No! Yes. - Was that a yes? - Yes. - A really, really, really lot? - Yes, all right? And as much as you like me, it's not.001... ...as much as I'm crazy about you. I swear to God, Lucy. You can cry all over yourself, I'm gonna tell it to you anyway. I am certifiably nuts about you and your ditzy mom! - So blow that into your handkerchief. - I don't have one. So cry on the horsey! You know what I want more than anything else in the whole world? My very own living room set. You know, it's a nice feeling to hear real people applauding. I took the names and addresses of everyone in the audience. I think we should have them over for dinner real soon. We definitely have to repaint the bedroom, don't you think? What? I'm redecorating. What color should we paint the bedroom? Successful. That's good. Something is wrong. It didn't come out right. What's wrong with it? In the first place, it's not on Park Avenue. How many more weeks do you have to play before I could get an armchair? If you'll take one without arms, about a year. Momma Bear has done the cave real nice. Where are you going? I'm crazy about you. I'm very fond of you myself. You have some very nice qualities. Leave Tuesday morning open. Why, what's Tuesday? How do blood tests strike you? - It was a great audience! - Four-star show! I want to take the show home and bottle it! I want to go home and sleep till Wednesday! - There is no air in here. - I can't do anything about it. Give the actors some air! We are human beings, not cattle! Let's hear it for the actors! Hello? Who is that? Hello. Oliver Frey. Oliver Frey, the director? I believe so. It's nice to meet you. Oliver Frey, what do you know? Would you like to come in? Pleased to meet you. - It's very nice to... - We won't keep you. There was just one question I wanted to ask. Would you be interested in a movie? You mean making one? We could go to one, but I think working is much more fun. With you? Yes, I'm interested. I am too. Are you kidding? Certainly, sure. What are you doing out here? You didn't lock yourself out again, did you? Lucy, what is it? At least we didn't get a letter this time. Sending that stuff out to the laundry, I hope. I got a picture, Paula! - What? - I got a picture, I got a movie. Shit. Terrific picture. Oliver Frey is directing. I've got to be on location in Seattle tomorrow morning. Seattle, Washington. I know where it is. Far away. Who cares? I'm not walkin'. They left a first-class air ticket at the airport for me. Four weeks' work, $2,000 a week. It's freaking Oliver Frey! I forgot to ask what the part was. That's wonderful. I'm not making any comparisons... ...but whoever heard of Al Pacino before The Godfather? I couldn't be happier for you. Jesus, I am so scared. I spend 20 years building up my ego and when I really need it... ...it locks itself in the john. It'll come back to you, trust me. What's wrong? Come on, it's only four weeks. That's one week less than five. I know. You don't know. You think you're going to get dumped on again, don't you? If you say you'll be back, why not believe you? If I were you and I saw an actor packing, I wouldn't believe him either. You need any help? I see you took everything. They said it was going to be really freezing up there... ...take all my warm clothing. You know that I would take you if I could. But it's rough country up there. It's up in the mountains. There are wolves. I don't mean in the movie either. I mean real, hungry wolves. I always got along fine with wolves. Honey, I thought you'd be excited. Jumpin' up and down. It's what I've worked for my whole life. Isn't that what a mature relationship is about? I root for you, you root for me. It's my third time up as cheerleader! Okay, I get the point. Forget it, I'm not going! It's not worth it! Not if it means I got to put you through four weeks of hell... ...wondering whether I'm coming back. Forget it! I won't go! It's just a job, right? Hell with it! If I got this job I can get another job. I'm lettin' it go! Okay? The hell I'm not gonna go! That's crazy! That's a dumb, stupid thing to do because you don't trust me. You have to trust me. Do you trust me? I'll plan my days around it. Goddamn them to hell! I hate those guys that walked out of here. I hate them. I'm the only one that's comin' back and I'm gettin' all the blame. No, you go, Elliot. I want you to go. If you come back, fine. I'll be here putting up my wallpaper. And if not, that's okay, too. I'll miss you... ...but I'll survive. 'Cause I've grown up these last couple of months. Look at me. I'm all grown up. It was better than spending a summer at camp. I never felt better or stronger in my life. Someone is walking out that door and I'm not crumbling into a million pieces. Jesus, it really does feel good. Goodbye, Elliot. You make a nice movie. Have a wonderful career. If you're ever up for an Academy Award... ...I promise you I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. What is it about you that makes a man with 147 I.Q., feel like a dribbling idiot? I don't know, but whatever it is, I thank God for it. You're welcome, God. Interesting lesson I'm learning. Really interesting. It could be that falling in love and becoming successful... ...is probably the worst thing that could ever happen to a guy. If my plane crashes in the storm, I'm coming back here, Paula. I mean it! I'll be dragging chains around this apartment when you're 90 years old. So long, kid. I'll see you, kid. I can't sleep. Give it five minutes, you just got into bed. I can predict the future. How about predicting mine? I can hear the phone ringing in your life. Hello? Get dressed. What? Get dressed, you're coming with me. What? Where are you? On the corner, in my old leaky phone booth. The plane had engine trouble. We're delayed two hours. I cashed in first-class for two economys. - What do I do about Lucy? - Don't worry about Lucy. Call Donna. She can stay with her until we get back. Come on, Paula, the cab is ticking away your new bedroom set. I thought I couldn't come with you. I'll tell them you're my analyst. Actors are known to be very high strung. And you really want me to come? You sure love a love scene, don't you? Yeah, I want you to come. Then it's okay, I don't have to. Just as long as you asked. Paula, don't play games with me. My socks are underwater. No, you have enough work to do without worrying about me... ...and besides, I have a lot of work to do. I am going to be spending your money on our apartment. And I am nuts about you! I hope I'm callin' the right number. Will you do me a favor? Anything, my angel. Will you have my guitar re-strung? - He left his guitar! - He is coming back! I never doubted it for a minute. Wait. Oh, my God. Wait! I have it, sweetheart! Have a safe trip. I love you! Never mind that. You're rusting my guitar!, Captain Walker didn't come home. His unborn child will never know him We believe him missing with a number of men, Don't expect to see him again It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy A son! A son! A son! Hear the joyful celebrations in the street! It's a boy born on this first day of peace! We've won! A son! We've won! I'm your friendly green coat, And I welcome you to Bernie's Holiday Camp! G'day, and you'll be happy, And it's Bernie you will thank. You must be little Tommy. Well, call me Uncle Frank. Welcome you too, Mrs. Walker, Here you'll always find a helping hand! The camp with the extras If you come to Bernie's, You might think you're in Heaven! Here we have the winner, folks! Have you ever seen a lovelier pair? What a shapely ankle! What a perfect shin! If you could feel this silken thigh, You'd know who has to win! If you could feel this silken thigh, You'd know. You don't know how much I've missed To feel a man again, To dance, to kiss. Your eyes reveal: You're lonely. This evening must pass slowly. Until we're one, my heart won't rest. Will Tommy share our happiness? I'll be more than an uncle; I'll be just like a Dad! I will be a green coat too, And when I'm big, I'll own a Holiday Camp! A camp with a difference, Always be good weather. When you come to Tommy's, The holiday's forever! I'm glad you like your Uncle Frank. He'll surely love you too, just like a Dad He's very nice, I think. Did he fight in the War? Gotta feeling '51 is gonna be a good year, Especially if you and me see it out together. So you think that '51 is gonna be a good year. We'll marry now and see it out together. I have no reason to be over-optimistic, But somehow when you smile I can brave bad weather. What about the boy? What about the boy? What about the boy, he saw it all! You didn't hear it, you didn't see it! You won't say nothin' to no one, Ever in your life. You never heard it. How absurd it all seems, without any proof You didn't hear it, you didn't see it! You won't say nothin' to no one, Ever in your life. You never heard it. How absurd it all seems, without any proof! You won't say nothin' to no one, Never tell a soul what you know is the truth! Now he is deaf. Now he is dumb Now he is blind. The guilty are safe, But always accused by his empty eyes. Nothing to say, Nothing to hear, And nothing to see Each sensation makes a note in his symphony. Sickness will surely take the mind Where minds can't usually go Come on the amazing journey, And learn all you should know. A vague haze of delirium creeps up on him. Soaring and flying images spin. He is your leader, he is your guide. On the amazing journey, Sickness will surely take the mind Where minds can't usually go. Come on the amazing journey, And learn all you should know His eyes are the eyes that transmit all he knows, The truth burns so bright it can melt winter snows. A towering shadow, so black and so high,. A white sun burning the earth and the sky. Did you ever see the faces Of the children, they get so excited Waking up on Christmas morning Hours before the winter sun's ignited They believe in dreams and all they mean, Including Heaven's generosity. Peeping 'round the door to see what Parcels are for free in curiosity. He doesn't know who Jesus was, Or what praying is. How can he be saved From the eternal grave? Tommy, can you hear me? Tommy, can you hear me? See me, feel me, touch me, heal me. Surrounded by his friends, He sits so silently and Unaware of anything. Playing poxy pinball, picks his nose He smiles, he cries, He pokes his tongue at everything I believe in love, But how can men who've never seen light Be enlightened? Only if he's cured Will his spirit's future level Ever heighten. And Tommy doesn't know what day it is. He doesn't know who Jesus was, Or what praying is. How can he be saved From the eternal grave? You talk about your woman, I wish you could see mine. Everytime she starts to lovin', She brings eyesight to the blind. You know, her daddy gave her magic. I can tell by the way she walks. Everytime she starts to shake, The dumb begin to talk, She's got the power to heal you, Never fear. Just one word from her lips, And the deaf can hear. If your child ain't all he should be now, This girl will put him right. I'll show him what he could be now, Just give me one night! I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen, Pay me before I start. I'm the Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed To mend his aching heart. Give us a room, close the door. Leave us for a while. Your boy won't be a boy no more; Young, but not a child! 'Cause I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen, Pay me before I start. The Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed To tear your soul apart. Gather your wits and hold on fast, Your mind must learn to roam. Just as the Gypsy Queen must do, You're gonna hit the road! My work is done, now look at him. He's never been more alive. His head it shakes, his fingers clutch. Watch his body writhe!

All alone, cousin. Let's think of a game to play Now the grownups have all gone away You won't be much fun, Being blind, deaf and dumb, But I've no one to play with today. Do you know how to play Hide and Seek? To find me, it would take you a week! You won't go anywhere. There's a lot I can do to a freak! How would you feel if I turned on the bath, Ducked your head under and started to laugh? Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm Will change your expression to one of alarm. I'm the school bully, The classroom cheat, The nastiest play-friend You ever could meet. I'll put glass in your dinner, and spikes in your seat. I'll drag you around By a lock of your hair, And give you a push At the top of the stair! What would you do if I Shut you outside To stand in the rain and Catch cold, so you'd die? I'm the school bully, The classroom cheat, The nastiest play-friend You ever could meet. I'll stick pins in your fingers, And tread on your feet. We're on our own, cousin. All alone, cousin. We've thought of some nice games to play While the grownups has all gone away. You weren't too much fun, 'Cause you're blind, deaf and dumb, But I'd no one to play with today. Do you think it's alright To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie? Do you think it's alright? He's had a few too many tonight Yes, I think it's alright, Yes, I think it's alright. I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie; I'm glad you won't see or hear me, As I fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about. Your mother left me here to mind you, And I'm doing exactly what I bleedin' well want to, Down with your bedclothes, Up with your nightshirt. Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about. You won't ""shite"" As I fiddle ""abite. "" Do you think it's alright Leaving Tommy by the mirror? You would think he had sight, Been staring half the night.

From SoHo down to Brighton, I must have played them all. But I ain't seen nothin' like him In any amusement hall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid Sure plays a mean pinball. He stands like a statue, Becomes part of the machine. Feelin' all the bumpers, Always playin' clean. He plays by intuition. The digit counters fall. That deaf, dumb and blind kid Sure plays a mean pinball. He's a pinball wizard, There has to be a twist. A pinball wizard, Got such a supple wrist! How do you think he does it? I don't know! What makes him so good? Well, he ain't got no distractions, Can't hear no buzzers and bells. Don't see lights a-flashing, He plays by sense of smell.

Birds and flowers and peacock's wings, Sequined gowns and birds that sing! Private planes and fishing lanes. Bigger crowds and bigger, bigger, bigger takes. But what's it all worth? What's it all worth when my son is blind? He can't hear the music nor enjoy what I'm buying. His life is worthless, affecting mine. I'd pay any price to drive his plight from my mind! There's a man I've found Could bring us all joy! There's a doctor I've found can cure the boy! A doctor I've found can cure the boy! There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow, He lives in this town, let's see him tomorrow, He seems to be completely unreceptive. The tests I gave him showed no sense at all. His eyes react to light; the dials detect it. He hears but cannot answer to your call. There is no chance, no untried operation. All hope lies with him and none with me. Imagine though the shock from isolation, When he suddenly can hear and speak and see. His eyes can see, His ears can hear, his lips speak. All the time the needles flick and rock. No machine can give the kind of stimulation, Needed to remove his inner block. I often wonder what it is he's feeling. Has he ever heard a word I've said? Look at him, now in the mirror dreaming. What is happening in his head? What is happening in his head? Oooooh, I wish I knew, I wish I knew. Tommy, can you see me? Can I help to cheer you? Tommy, can you hear me? Can you feel me near you? Oooh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. You don't answer my call With even a nod or a twitch But you gaze at your own reflection! You don't seem to see me But I think you can see yourself.

Tommy, can you hear me? Mother, Father. Touch me, feel me. Who am I, where did I come from? Have you known me, have you seen me? You're a hero! You are famous! You're a champion of the young!

He went on cleaning his black Rolls Royce And she ran inside weeping. She got to her room and tears splashed the picture Of the new Messiah. She picked up a book of her father's life And threw it on the fire! She knew from the start Deep down in her heart That she and Tommy were worlds apart, But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part... Is to be what you'll be. "" The theme of the sermon was come unto me, Love will find a way, So Sally decided to ignore her dad, And sneak out anyway! She spent all afternoon getting ready, Decided she'd try to touch him, Maybe he'd see that she was free And talk to her this Sunday. She knew from the start Deep down in her heart That she and Tommy were worlds apart, But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part... Is to be what you'll be. "" She arrived at six and the place was swinging To gospel music by nine. Group after group appeared on the stage And Sally just sat there crying. She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture Right in the very front row And then one of the people came on stage And shouted, ""Here we go!"" The crowd went crazy as Tommy hit the stage! Little Sally got lost as the police bossed The crowd back in a rage! Your happy welcome is like a favor I must now return. The darkness of my childhood past And flames of blood now burn. The pinball game I play so well Reflects a way of life. This meeting is just another game; Let's play to win, tonight! She knew from the start Deep down in her heart That she and Tommy were worlds apart But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part... Is to be what you'll be. "" Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down, Mingling with her tears. Try to walk the path I walked, Never mind the pain and fear. Each one of you has freedom In your heart without my grace. Let me see you raise your hands See joy upon your face! The crowd went crazy As Tommy left the stage! Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch And a gash across her face, her pretty face! Ooooh. Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said, ""Don't say I didn't warn yer. "" Sally got married to a rock musician She met in California. Tommy always talks about the day The disciples all went wild! Sally still carries a scar on her cheek To remind her of his smile. While Tommy flies, the world is turning.

To start the day off nice and fine, here's a new old favourite of mine. # I solve my problems and I see the light # We got a lovin' thing # We got to feed it right # There ain't no danger we can go too far # We start believin' now # That we can be who we are # Grease is the word # They think our love is just a growin' pain # Why don't they understand? # It's just a cryin' shame # Their lips are lying, only real is real # We stop the fight right now # We got to be what we feel # Grease is the word # Is the word, is the word that you've heard # It's got groove, it's got meaning # Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion # Grease is the way we are feelin' # We take the pressure and we throw away # Conventionality # Belongs to yesterday # There is a chance that we can make it so far # We start believin' now # That we can be who we are # Grease is the word # Is the word, is the word that you've heard # It's got groove, it's got meaning # Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion # Now grease is the way we are feelin' # This is a life of illusion # Wrapped up in troubles # Laced in confusion # What are we doing here? # We take the pressure and we throw away # Conventionality # Belongs to yesterday # There is a chance that we can make it so far # We start believin' now # That we can be who we are # Grease is the word # Is the word, is the word that you've heard # It's got groove, it's got meaning # Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion # Grease is the way we are feelin' # Grease is the word, is the word that you've heard # It's got groove, it's got meaning # Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion # Grease is the way we are feelin' # Grease is the word, is the word, is the word - You don't eat this, you bury it. - That's a home-made lunch. Your old lady drag her carcass out of bed for you? - She does it first day of school. - Big deal. - Kenickie. Over here. - Where you at? We're right here. - Where were you all summer? - Are you my mother? - Just askin'. - Working. More than you can say. - Working? - Yes, lugging boxes at Bargain City. - Nice job. - Eat me. I'm saving up to get me some wheels. - Wanna hear what I did? - No. Hey, there's Danny. Danny! Danny! You seen any new broads there? Nah, same old chicks, everybody's made them. So what'd you do all summer? I was hanging around at the beach. You know. It's tough with all those chicks hanging around you. The only thing that hangs around you are the flies. How was the action at the beach, man? Whew. It was flipping. Yeah? Crazy? I did meet this one chick. She was sorta cool. You mean she puts out? Come on, Sonny, is that all you think about? - Freakin' A. - (bell) Hey, guys, wait up. - Do I look OK, Frenchy? - Sure, you look good. - I'm really nervous. - You look terrific. - So, this is Rydell? - Yep. You'll love it. I loved the last school I was at. I wish I was there right now. Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak. Why? You got psoriasis? Well, here we are again. - But this time we're seniors. - We're gonna rule the school. Jan, that is so adolescent. - We are adolescent. - We don't have to flaunt it. OK, girls. Let's go get 'em. Blanche, do you have the new schedules? Yes, Miss McGee, I just had my hands on them. Oh, good, they'll be nice and smudged. Here we are. If it had been a snake, it would've bitten me. These are the schedules we couldn't find last semester. Next year, you might find this semester's. - I've got Kenickie again. - He's been here longer than I have. First day of school and already my castor oil is missing. How many days till Christmas vacation? - And counting. - Can I help you? - Yes, it's my first day. - I'm not sure where I should be. - Welcome to Rydell. You'll have to fill out these forms, but... Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back. - Do you have a pencil, please? - Yes, dear. There you are. Jeez. Every teacher I got this year has flunked me at least once. You'll spend your time in McGee's office. - She'll wish she'd never seen me. - Yeah? And what are you gonna do? I just ain't gonna take her crap. I don't take no crap from nobody. - Sonny? - Oh, hello, ma'am. - Shouldn't you be in home room? - I was going for a walk. - You were dawdling. - Yes, ma'am. That is no way to start a new semester, Mr LaTierri. Perhaps a session of banging erasers after school would put you on track. Yes, ma'am. - Do you plan to stand there all day? - No, ma'am. I mean, yes. - Well, which is it? - No, ma'am. - Good. Then move. - Yes, ma'am. I'm glad you didn't take any of her crap, Sonny. You would have told her off, huh? Mr LaTierri. Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am... Hey, Eugene. How you doin'? - Shake, buddy. - (buzzing) What's wrong? You're wearing glasses. - I got an astigmatism. - Too bad. (students) # As I go travelling down life's highway # Whatever course my fortunes may foretell... Good morning, boys and girls. Welcome to what we're sure will be our greatest year at Rydell. Saturday night will be our first pep rally and bonfire. I want to see all of you students out there, with plenty of support for Coach Calhoun and the Rydell Rangers. If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter. And now for the really good news. One of the most exciting things to ever happen at Rydell High. National Bandstand television show has selected Rydell as a representative American high school and will do a live broadcast from our very own gym. It is our chance to show the entire nation what fine, bright, clean-cut, wholesome students we have here at Rydell. # Ba, ba, bamba # Ba, ba, bamba # La, la, la, la, la bamba Did you guys get a look at Zuko this mornin'? Lookin' pretty good this year, huh, Rizz? - That's ancient history. - History sometimes repeats itself. - Hey, you guys. - Hi, Frenchy. Go sit down. This here is Sandy Olsen. And that's Jan and Marty, and this is Rizzo. She just moved here from Sydney, Australia. - How are things down under? - Oh, fine, thanks. Marty, are those new glasses? Yeah, just for school. Do they make me look smarter? Nah, you can still see your face. - How d'you like school, Sandy? - It's different. - Hi, kids. - (all groan) Patty Simcox, the bad seed of Rydell. Hi. - I love the first day of school. - The biggest thrill of my life. - You won't guess what's happened. - Probably not. The nominees for Student Council are out. - Guess who's up for Vice President? - Who? Me. Isn't that the most? - To say the least. - The very least. I hope I don't make a poor showing. We wish you the best of luck, don't we, girls? I've got my fingers crossed. Oh, you must think I'm a clod for not introducing myself. Hi, I'm Patty Simcox. Welcome to Rydell. (squeals) Will you be at cheerleader tryouts? We'll be lifelong friends. You guys, how do you like Sandy? Do you think we can let her in the Pink Ladies? - She looks too pure to be pink. - Ohh, double do-do! What's up, doc? One of my diamonds just fell in the macaroni. Kenickie, want a piece of salami? Are you kidding? If I eat that, I'll smell like you. What a stink! Hey, guys, look. Ladies and gentlemen, dingleberries on parade. Look! You really put your foot into it this time. Try hopscotch, you hot dog. What a gavone! Gumdrops, man. Any of you guys see that new chick in registration? Sure beats the foam domes round here. Jugs bigger than Annette's? Nobody's jugs are bigger than Annette's. Hey, guys. Hey! Hi, girls. You're a sick man, Putz. Hey, I wanna hear about what Danny did at the beach. - It was nothing. - Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right? - You got in her drawers, right? - Come on, tell us. What did you do this summer? I spent most of it at the beach. I met a boy there. You hauled your cookies to the beach for a guy? - He was sorta special. - There ain't no such thing. It was really romantic. Everything about it. You don't want to hear the horny details. Alright, I'll tell you. # Summer lovin', had me a blast # Summer lovin', happened so fast # I met a girl, crazy for me # Met a boy, cute as can be # Summer days, drifting away # To uh, oh, those summer nights # Wella, wella, wella, huh # Tell me more, tell me more Did you get very far? - # Tell me more, tell me more - # Like does he have a car? - # Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh - # Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do # She swam by me, she got a cramp # He ran by me, got my suit damp # I saved her life, she nearly drowned # He showed off, splashing around # Summer sun, something's begun # But uh, oh, those summer nights # Wella, wella, wella, huh - # Tell me more, tell me more - # Was it love at first sight? - # Tell me more, tell me more - # Did she put up a fight? # Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh # Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum # Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh # Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum # Took her bowling in the arcade # We went strolling, drank lemonade # We made out, under the dock # We stayed out till ten o'clock # Summer fling, don't mean a thing # But uh, oh, those summer nights - # Tell me more, tell me more - # But you don't gotta brag # Tell me more, tell me more # Cos he sounds like a drag # Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop # Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop Shuda-bop-bop, yeah! # He got friendly, holding my hand # She got friendly, down in sand # He was sweet, just turned 1 8 # Well, she was good, you know what I mean # Summer heat, boy and girl meet # But uh, oh, those summer nights # Whoa, whoa, whoa - # Tell me more, tell me more - # How much dough did he spend? - # Tell me more, tell me more - # Could she get me a friend? # It turned colder, that's where it ends # So I told her we'd still be friends # Then we made our true love vow # Wonder what she's doing now # Summer dreams # Ripped at the seams # But # Oh # Those summer # Nights # Tell me more, tell me more He sounds real nice. True love and he didn't lay a hand on you? Sounds like a creep. He wasn't. He was a gentleman. What was his name? Danny. Danny Zuko. Well, I think he sounds peachy keen. Maybe, if you believe in miracles, Prince Charming will show up again someday. Somewhere unexpected. See you later. Come on, girls. - Do you really think so, Frenchy? - Sure. Erm, ... Sandy, I think we oughta get to class. (all) Do the splits, give a yell Show a little spirit for old Rydell Way to go, red and white Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight! And now... Quiet, please. Quiet, everyone. Now, boys and girls, the man of the hour. The coach we're all depending on to pull Rydell out of a seven-season slump, our very own Coach Calhoun. - Who's the best? - (all) Rydell! Give 'em hell, Rydell! I just wanna tell you students that we have a banner year coming up. Because my boys are primed, really primed, because I primed 'em. Not only primed, they're honed. Honed to a sharp razor-edge. We're not just going out there to win. We're going out there for glory. And when we get out there, we're gonna yank 'em and tear 'em and rip 'em. We'll take 'em and roll 'em around and rip 'em up to pieces! Then we're gonna slaughter 'em. And after the slaughter is over, we're gonna come back here and ring that victory bell. Like we always wanted to. Watch this. Nyik-nyak, nyik-nyak Brrr, nyik-nyak Do a split, give a yell Shake a tit for old Rydell! Guys. Be cool, huh? Hey, watch out, pinhead! Well, what do you think? What a hunk of junk. Wait till I give it a paint job, soup up the engine. She'll run like a champ. I'm racing her at Thunder Road. - Thunder Road? - Yeah. Wanna make something of it? I wanna see you make something of this heap. You're cruisin' for a bruisin'. What are Scorpions doing here? It ain't their turf. - Think they wanna rumble? - If they do, we'll be ready. Alright, gang. Let's go get 'em! - Hey, chicken. - Whoo-hoo! What you doing? - Thanks, Frenchy. - That's alright. - You were great out there. - I messed up, I was so nervous. - Your split was divoon. - Hi, Sandy. - Hi, Rizz. Hi, girls. - We got a surprise for you. - What is it? - You'll see. Right, Rizz? Let me comb your hair down. Where are we going? Want a little lipstick? If you fix up this car, it could be make-out city. A chick is gonna have to put out before she even gets in. You'd better believe it. Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you. Oh, yeah? Yeah. - Sandy! - Danny? What are you doing here? I thought you were back in Australia. We had a change of plan. I can't... That's cool, baby. You know how it is. Rockin' and rollin' and whatnot. - Danny? - That's my name, don't wear it out. - What's the matter with you? - What's the matter with me? What's the matter with you? What happened to the Danny Zuko I met at the beach? Well, I do not know. Maybe there's two of us, right? Why don't you take out a missing-persons ad or... ...try the Yellow Pages? I don't know. You're a fake and a phoney. I wish I'd never laid eyes on you. (all) Ooohhh... I wonder if she carries silver bullets! So she laid her eyes on you, huh, Zuko? I bet that's not all she's laid on him. - Hey, Zuke! I got a car, remember? - Come on, Danny. - Who's got beer money? - I swiped my brother's ID. He was so nice to me this summer. Listen, Sandy, men are rats. Listen to me. They're fleas on rats. Worse than that, they're amoebas on fleas on rats. I mean, they're too low for even the dogs to bite. The only man a girl can depend on is her daddy. You know what you need? A night out with the girls. We're having a sleep-over at my house tonight. Wanna come? Good. You'll love it. Come on. Hey, look at Jan. # Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a Get the new Ipana # With the brand-new flavour It's dandy for your teeth # Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a, New Ipana toothpaste # Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a Knocks out decay germs fast # Fast, fast, you sure are right Turn it off. - Hand me a ciggie butt. - Yeah, me, too. - Want one, Sandy? - I don't smoke. - You don't? - Go ahead, try it. It won't kill ya. Oh, I forgot to say, you shouldn't inhale unless you're used to it. Sandy, let me teach you how to French inhale. It's really cool. God. That is the ugliest-Iooking thing I ever saw. The guys really go for it. It's how I got my nickname. Sure it is. OK, how about a little Sneaky Pete to get the party goin'? Italian Swiss Colony? Wow, it's imported. I brought Twinkies. Anybody want one? Twinkies and wine? That's real class, Jan. It says right here it is a dessert wine. Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine. - Oh, that's OK. - I bet you never had a drink before. I had champagne at my cousin's wedding once. Ring-a-ding-ding! What's wrong? We don't got cooties. Hey, Sandy. Would you like me to pierce your ears for ya? - (jeering) - Shut up! Isn't it awfully dangerous? I know what I'm doing. I'm going to be a beautician. - What's the matter? You afraid? - No, I'm not. - Here, Frenchy, use my virgin pin. - It's good for somethin'. - It's not a good idea. - It's OK. My father won't like it. (screams) Sandy, let's go into the bathroom. My mother'll kill me if I get blood on the carpet. - It only bleeds for a second. - I don't feel very well. Don't worry. If she screws up, she can fix your hair so your ears don't show. Sandy, Sandy, beauty is pain. Could you get some ice to numb her ears? Let the cold water run and stick her ear under the faucet. Personally, I'm getting rather chilly. - Hey, what's that? - From Bobby in Korea. - Are you going with a Korean? - Dummy, he's a marine. A marine? Whooo! Wanna see a picture? God. You're turning into a one-woman USO. Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick. I just did one ear. She saw the blood and... bleurgh! You won't get your hands on my ears. Yeah? You'll be sorry. I have been accepted to La Cafury Beauty School. You're dropping out of Rydell? I don't see it as dropping out. I see it as a very strategic career move. - Why's it torn in half? - His old girlfriend was in it. Er, ... Sandy, here's your toothbrush. Thanks, Frenchy. I'm sorry to be so much trouble. It's OK. Miss Goody Two-Shoes makes me wanna barf. # Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee # Lousy with virginity # Won't go to bed Till I'm legally wed # I can't, I'm Sandra Dee Watch it. # Hey, I'm Doris Day # I was not brought up that way # Won't come across Even Rock Hudson lost # His heart to Doris Day - # I don't drink - No! - # Or swear - Oh! - # I don't rat my hair - Yeurgh! # I get ill from one cigarette # Keep your filthy paws Off my silky drawers # Would you pull that crap with Annette? # As for you, Troy Donahue # I know what you wanna do # You've got your crust I'm no object of lust # I'm just plain Sandra Dee # Elvis!

Have one of mine. - There's so many of them. - I know. - How do you keep up with them? - I'm a terrific pen pal. Hopelessly devoted to every one. What are you doing? OK. What do you think this is? A gangbang? - You wish. - (all laugh) Hit the pavement. You gotta be kidding. - I said now. - Alright. Remember us in your will. When a guy picks a chick over his buddies, something's wrong. Come on, guys, let's go for a slice of pizza. Can I have some of that? Sure. - Thanks. - Wait. # Guess mine is not the first heart broken # My eyes are not the first to cry # I'm not the first to know # There's just no getting over you # You know, I'm just a fool who's willing # To sit around and wait for you # But, baby, can't you see? # There's nothing else for me to do # I'm hopelessly devoted to you # But now there's nowhere to hide # Since you pushed my love aside # I'm out of my head # Hopelessly devoted to you # Hopelessly devoted to you # Hopelessly devoted to you # My head is saying # Fool, forget him # My heart is saying # Don't let go # Hold on to the end # And that's what I intend to do # I'm hopelessly devoted to you # But now there's nowhere to hide # Since you pushed my love aside # I'm out of my head # Hopelessly devoted to you # Hopelessly devoted to you # Hopelessly devoted to you (radio) Is acne ruining your life?

The whole place is a no-parking zone, crater-face. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! You're gonna pay for that. I'll give you 75 cents for the whole car, including your chick. We just have to bang out the dent. The problem's not in the dent, it's this rubber-band engine. - The problem's your mouth. - Where you gonna get a carburettor? - Ever heard of borrowing? - Kenickie, you got any Scotch tape? Hey, big stuff. What do you drive, huh? - I drive. - Yeah? How about you? - Who, me? - Yeah. What about Doody? - Well, I... - That's what I thought. C'mon, guys.

Hey, guys. - Kenickie, Zuko. - How's it hangin'? OK, the meeting is in session. Know what I heard? Last year the fuzz had Thunder Road staked out. - Everyone got hauled to the clink. - No one'll catch Greased Lightning. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Somebody snaking you, Danny? - Bite the weenie, Rizz. With relish. - I don't know about these chicks. - They're only good for one thing. What do you do with 'em the other 23 hours 45 minutes a day? Does it only take 1 5 minutes? Want some new music? - Yeah. - I'll need some money. Thanks. I'll be right back. Hi, Danny! - I can't talk. - What are you doing later? - I can't talk, alright? - Call me. - Hi, Sandy. - Oh, hi. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. That's good. Sandy, I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time. - What about? - About the night at the bonfire. The way I acted, that was terrible. It wasn't me, you gotta know that. It was me, of course, but it wasn't me. You see, Sandy, I got this image, right? And... That's why I'm so glad that Tom's such a simple person. Simple's right. Too bad his brains are in his biceps. Jealous, are you? Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy, don't make me laugh. What have you ever done? Come on! I can run circles around those jerks. I'll believe that when I see it. Let's start with the first rule. Cut it down to two packs a day. There. What sort of athletics are you interested in? You like the rings? Yeah, I installed a set just a couple of weeks ago. The first thing we have to do is you have to change. That's why I'm here, to change. - No, I mean your clothes. - Oh. Alright. Let's knock it off. Fellas, I wanna introduce a new man. Danny. Let's give him a tryout. - Better watch it. - Come on. A little fire, here we go. You have to dribble. - Here you go, Coach. - Thanks, son. Dribble the ball, put it in the basket. - Think you can do that? - Can I do that! - OK. - Danny, over here. Danny! Let's go. That's it. Go, go, go. Get him, Danny. - (whistle) - What'd I do? - Is he kidding? - Boy, oh, boy. I want you to meet your wrestling partner. Danny, Andy. Are you crazy? Come on, come on. Let's start. Get in first position. Danny, you get down. OK, Andy, get down. Ready? Hold it, hold it. Danny, you gotta try. Come on. Alright, Andy, let's change positions. You get down. Come on. Alright. Ready? - Give? - Yeah, give. Good. He's a hitter. You'll like baseball. It's not that much of a contact sport. Get in there and let's see what you can do. Throw the ball. Let's play. Let's pitch this guy out. - He can't hit. - This boy can't even bat. - Strike. - I told you. He doesn't even swing. What kind of ball player are you? Put it in here. Strike. Come on. A little fire in there. Let's see you hit it. Foul ball. - Easy, easy. - Now! Come on. Put the bat down. Put the bat down. There's a lot of other sports that don't have any contact. - Yeah, like what? - Like track. - What do you mean, running? - Just like running? I mean something that needs endurance. Something that needs stamina. Like, long-distance running. Cross-country running. - That could be cool. - Good. Danny. Danny, are you alright? Danny, talk to me. The least you can do is talk to me after the way you treated me. The way I... ? Sandy, I told you I was sorry. Got you talking. - You sure you're OK? - Yes, I'm fine. - So, still dating that jockstrap? - Well... - Is he taking you to the dance? - Well, that all depends. - On what? - On you. - On me? - Yeah. He can stag it. Come on. - Sandy, let's go someplace else. - Why? We can't be alone here, that's why. Danny. OK. You nearly pulled my arm out. I didn't want to miss this table. It's the best one. - What are you doing? - I just want privacy. - What'll it be, kids? - Cherry soda, please. - Danny? - I'm not very hungry. Give me a double polar burger with everything and a soda with ice cream. Sounds good. I'll have the same. The same? You can eat a lot. - You're funny. - No, you are. - How ya doing, Zuke? Nice! - Hiya, Rizzo. How are you? Peachy keen, jelly bean. You got any quarters? We could split an Eskimo Pie. - My Dutch treat days are over. - You plan on staying home a lot. Greetings, pals and gals. Anybody got 23 cents? Wanna chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight? I don't know where my money goes. A dime here, 1 5 cents there. In a couple of months Frenchy can take us all out. A working girl with income. Y'know, they don't pay that much to start with. It's more than we make. Ante up, I don't get my allowance till Friday. - You get an allowance? - When I'm a good boy. Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight with four spoons. - And an Eskimo Pie with a knife. - Hi, gang. Here you are. Grab it and growl. I got so many hickeys I look like a leper. Cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie is like a Hallmark card. You care enough to send the very best. - You pig. - I love it when you talk dirty. My parents want to invite you to tea on Sunday. Will you come? - I don't like tea. - You don't have to drink tea. Well, I don't like parents. - Want some? - Erm, uh-uh. You sure are a cheap date. - I didn't mean it like that. - I understand. - I always found you understanding. - I am. I also think there's more to you than just fat. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Got a date for the dance-off? - No. - Wanna go? - Yeah. I'll be a senior forever if I don't study for that algebra test. You're in luck. You got an armed escort home. It's not the arms I'm worried about, Sonny. It's the hands. She loves me. - You coming, French? - I don't think so. - I think I'll hang out a bit longer. - Alright. I have been dieting all day long. My mom's apple pie's better than this. - Do you want a piece? - Yeah, sure. - Putzie. - Yeah? 1 5 minutes! I'm worried about this dance-off. Do they dance differently to back home? Don't worry. Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop. Let's get out of here, Sandy. See you later. - Bye, Frenchy. - See ya, Sandy. Great. I'm stuck with the check. Give me money. OK, what's with you tonight? You got the personality of a wet mop. - Don't start with me. - Fine. How about I finish with ya? Finish this! To you from me, Pinky Lee. Sorry, French. (distant) Hey, Rizzo. I want to talk to you! No use crying over spilt milk shake. Oh, I'll be OK. You know it's near closing time? Do you mind if I stay a bit longer? No, suit yourself. - Wow. - What? I hate to tell you, but your hair looks like an Easter egg. Oh, yeah. Well, I had a little trouble in tinting class. In fact, I had a little trouble in all my classes. Beauty school sure wasn't what I thought it'd be. Nothing ever is. Vi? Erm, ... I dropped out. What do you think of waitressing? You're too young to know. Maybe I could be a telephone operator. No, I don't think I'd like to wear those little things over my ears. God, if only I could have a guardian angel to tell me what to do. Like Debbie Reynolds had in Tammy. What do you think? If you find him, give him my phone number. # Your story's sad to tell # A teenage ne'er-do-well # Most mixed-up non-delinquent on the block # Your future's so unclear now # What's left of your career now? # Can't even get a trade-in on your smock # Beauty school dropout # No graduation day for you # Beauty school dropout # Missed your midterms and flunked shampoo # Well, at least you could have taken time # To wash and clean your clothes up # After spending all that dough # To have the doctor fix your nose up # Baby, get movin' # Why keep your feeble hopes alive? - # What are you provin'? - # What are you provin'? # You've got the dream but not the drive # If you go for your diploma # You could join a steno-pool # Turn in your teasing-comb # And go back to high school # Beauty school dropout # Hangin' around the corner store # Beauty school dropout # It's about time you knew the score # Well, they couldn't teach you anything # You think you're such a looker # But no customer would go to you # Unless she was a hooker - # Baby, don't sweat it - # Don't sweat it # You're not cut out to hold a job - # Better forget it - # Forget it # Who wants their hair done by a slob? # Now your bangs are curled, your lashes twirled # But still the world is cruel # Wipe off that angel face # And go back to high school # Baby, don't blow it # Don't put my good advice to shame # Baby, you know it # Even Dear Abby would say the same # Now, I've called the shot, get off the pot # I've really got to fly # Gotta be going to that malt shop # In the sky # Beauty school dropout # Go back to high school # Beauty school dropout # Go back to high school # Beauty school dropout # Go back to high school - Lower your head, Kenickie. - What are you doing? - Give him a break. - Oh, I will!

I seen better heads on a mug of beer. - Grow up. He's the living end. - Yeah, if you like older guys. Danny, this is so exciting. You gotta make friends with the cameraman. - You know him? - His name's Ted. Doody, how do I look? Like a beautiful blonde pineapple. You're late, fellas. Where you been? - The gym never looked so good. - You bring the provisions? Alright, kids. I want a big circle. Come on, boys and girls, we are going on the air very shortly. But first, some warm-up numbers with Johnny Casino and the Gamblers. # Oh, baby, rock'n'roll is here to stay, it will never die # It was meant to be that way, though I don't know why # I don't care what people say Rock'n'roll is here to stay # We don't care what people say Rock'n'roll is here to stay # Everybody rock, everybody rock # Everybody rock, everybody rock # Come on # Everybody rock # If you don't like rock'n'roll, think what you'd be missin' # If you like to bop and stroll, come on down and listen # Let's all start to have a ball # Everybody rock'n'roll - What are their names? - Fred and Ginger. Fred and Ginger. - I hope I don't get camera fright. - Don't worry, we'll be cool. - Yeah? - Don't worry? Good. Come on, let's go. # What's that playing on the radio? # Why do I start swaying to and fro? # I have never heard that song before # But if I don't hear it any more... Why not let me lead for a change? I can't help it. I'm used to leadin'. OK. Doody, can't you turn me around or something? Don't talk, Frenchy. I'm trying to count. # A melody # That's never the same # A melody that's calling your name... Have you thought of singing professionally? # (off key) Come back to me-e-e - # Please... - Hey, Zuko! Zuke! I want you to meet Cha Cha di Gregorio. - How you doing, baby? - Fine. Who is she? They call me Cha Cha, cos I'm the best dancer at St Bernadette's. With the worst reputation. Let's go, Sandy. - Who's that girl? - Just a girl I know, that's all. Hi. I'm Vince Fontaine. Do your folks know I come into your room every night? Over KZAZ, that is. I'm judging the dance contest. I don't think I'm entered. A knockout like you? What's your name? - Marty. - Marty what? Maraschino. You know, like in cherry. - What are you doing? - Washing my hands. # You don't remember me # But I remember you # It was not so long ago # You broke my heart in two # Tears on my pillow # Pain in my heart # Caused by you, you, you, you, you... How do you know her? Erm, she's an old friend of the family, that's all. # Love is not a toy # When you find the one you love... - Aren't you glad to be back? - Oh, yeah. Besides, blondes do have more fun. # If we could start anew # I wouldn't hesitate... When I hear music, I can't make my feet behave. - Thinks she's Tinker Bell. - Hush, Sonny. # Pain in my heart # Caused by you # You-ou-ou-ou Sshh. The Rydell fight song! When you are finished... You will be happy to know that I am not judging the dance contest. I think we all owe a round of applause to Patty Simcox and Eugene Felznik and committee for their beautiful decorations. Let's hear it for the toilet paper. In a few moments, the entire nation will be watching Rydell High, God help us, and I want you all to be on your best behaviour. No heinie-biting. And now, here he is, the Prince of the Platters, Mr Vince Fontaine. Mr Vince Fontaine? Hey, it's great being here at Rydell High. What's your name, sweetheart? And now, for the rules. Game rule one. All couples must be boy-girl. Too bad, Eugene. Alright, alright. Come on. Game rule two. During the dance contest, if you're tapped on the shoulder, leave the floor, or else. I mean it. And rule three, anyone doing tasteless or vulgar movements will be disqualified. That leaves us out. Keep it clean, please. Keep it clean. 20 seconds. Thank you, fans and friends. Now a few words to the wise. You are my best pals. To look your best for the contest, just have a ball, that's all. Forget the camera, keep on the beat, give the folks at home a treat. Keep dancin', that's showbiz. If I tap you, step aside. Let the others ride. Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. On the air. Welcome to National Bandstand, live from Rydell High School. This is what you're waiting for, the dance-off. Away we go with Johnny Casino and the Gamblers. # You ain't nothin' but a hound dog # Cryin' all the time # You ain't nothin' but a hound dog # Cryin' all the time # You ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine Look. There's the camera! That's Putzie and Jan. # Said you was high class, that was just a lie # Call yourself high class, that was just a lie # Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit...

Some guy and gal will get some fantabulous prizes. Don't feel bad if I tap you out. It don't matter if you win or lose, it's what you do with your dancin' shoes. Does everybody here know Marty? OK, cats, throw your mittens round your kittens. Away we go! That wasn't supposed to happen! Let's go, let's hand-jive! # Before I was born late one night # My papa said everything's alright # The doctor made my ma lay down... Guy with the girl in red, throw 'em out. # Cos the bebop stork was about to arrive # Mama gave birth to the hand-jive # I could barely walk when I milked a cow # When I was three I pushed a plough # While choppin' wood I'd move my legs # And I started dancin' while I gathered eggs # Townsfolk clapped, I was only five # I'd outdance 'em all, I was born to hand-jive Yes, split 'em, buddy. Go, go, go, go. Shake it. Shake it. Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy. Attagirl! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody! # Born to hand-jive, baby # Born to hand-jive, baby Here we go. Hey, break it up! What is that?

Higher and higher! # Now can you hand-jive, baby? # Oh, can you hand-jive, baby? # Oh, yeah # Born to hand-jive, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Here they are, the new champs. Come on up here. - Can I have your names, please? - Cha Cha di Gregorio and Danny Zuko. - We'll do it now. - Where's Marty? - Don't worry, she's in good hands. - Whose? Now let's see our champs in a spotlight dance. - # Blue moon - # Blue, blue, blue, blue moon # You saw me standing alone # Without a dream in my heart # Without a love of my own... Ready? One, one, two, three, go. # Blue moon... Who's that on the right? We have pictures of you so-called mooners. Just because it's not your faces doesn't mean we can't identify you. At this very moment, those pictures are on the way to Washington, where the FBI has experts in this type of identification. If you turn yourselves in now, you may escape a federal charge. C'mon, Doody. Watch your hands. Move it out. I feel like a meatball in here. Let's go find the chicks. Marty. Marty. Hold my money. Don't let me go near the refreshment stand. - I'm not hungry. - Hey. What's happening? There's nobody here. Come on, Sandy. I told you on the phone I was sorry. - I know you did. - You believe me, don't you? Yes, but I still think you and Cha Cha went together. We did not go together. We just went together. - It's the same thing. - No. No. - (screams) - Ohh! Sandy, I'm sorry. Sandy... Would you wear my ring? Danny. I don't know what to say. - Say, yes. - Yes. Danny, this means so much to me. Cos I know now that you respect me. Hey, Rizz? Watch it. - What's with you tonight? - I feel like a defective typewriter. - I skipped a period. - You think you're PG? I don't know. Big deal. - Was it Kenickie? - Nah, you don't know the guy. Rizz, look, it's OK. I caught Vince Fontaine putting aspirin in my Coke at the dance. Hey. - Marty, you won't tell no one? - Sure, I'll take it to the grave. Coming through, coming through. Come on, lady with a baby. Hey, Marty, what's up? Rizzo's pregnant. Rizzo's got a bun in the oven. Rizzo's knocked up. Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up. You do? Boy, good news really travels fast. Why didn't ya tell me about it? What's it to ya? - I might be able to do something. - You did enough. I don't run away from my mistakes. Don't worry about it, Kenickie. It was somebody else's mistake. Thanks a lot, kid. Any time. - (sneezes) - Are you getting a cold? No. It's probably a little drive-in dust, that's all. - Danny! - Sandy! Oh, Sandy... Danny, what are you doing? Don't worry, nobody's watchin'. - Get off me. - Sandy, what's the matter with you? I thought I meant something to you. Think I'm gonna stay with you in this sin-wagon? Take this piece of tin! Sandy, you can't walk out of a drive-in! # Stranded at the drive-in # Branded a fool # What will they say # Monday at school? # Sandy # Can't you see # I'm in misery? # We made a start # Now we're apart # There's nothing left for me # Love has flown # All alone # I sit and wonder why-aye-aye # Why you left me # Oh, Sandy # Oh, Sandy # Maybe # Someday # When high school is done # Somehow, some way # Our two worlds will be one # In heaven # Forever # And ever we will be # Please, say you'll stay # Oh, Sandy Sandy, my darling, you hurt me real bad. You know it's true. But, baby, you gotta believe me when I say... ...I'm helpless without you. # Love has flown # All alone # I sit, I wonder why-aye-aye # Why you left me # Oh, Sandy # Sandy # Sandy # Why-aye-aye-aye? Oh, Sandy! Head it out. Come on, guys. Well, the crate shaped up. - It's as hot as the parts on it. - We didn't steal all of it. - Some of it was donated. - Just wait till Thunder Road. Right. You could still change your mind. - The flag is in three hours. - And Greased Lightning strikes. - You coming? - My boys won't let me down, and I won't let them down. I wanna talk to you. Those guys at Thunder Road don't fool around, you know. You want me to punk out? No, I'm not saying punking out, I'm just... You know what I mean. Hey, Danny, erm... We been friends a long time, right? Yeah. You remember the drive-in the other night? The movie with the duel, the guy's best friend went with him as his lieutenant, his second? Yeah. So? Well, I thought that... you could maybe be my second at Thunder Road. What, you want me to drive with you or what? Listen, I'll pick you up at three, alright? Open up the door. What are you sitting around for? Take the can off the front of the car, you putz. Hello, Rizz. Are you going to Thunder Road? Not a chance. I have to go. I have to talk to Danny. Without wheels and a motor, he won't know you're alive. We haven't been friends, but if there's anything I can do... I can take care of myself. And anybody else who comes along. You think I don't know what people are saying about me? Hey. Thanks. That's the one I was telling you about. # There are worse things I could do # Than go with a boy or two # Even though the neighbourhood # Thinks I'm trashy and no good # I suppose it could be true # But there are worse things I could do # I could flirt with all the guys # Smile at them and bat my eyes # Press against them when we dance # Make them think they stand a chance # Then refuse to see it through # That's a thing I'd never do # I could stay home every night # Wait around for Mr Right # Take cold showers every day # And throw my life away # On a dream that won't come true # I could hurt someone like me # Out of spite or jealousy # I don't steal and I don't lie # But I can feel and I can cry # A fact I'll bet you never knew # But to cry in front of you # That's the worst thing # I could do - You guys think you got a winner? - That's right. Takes more than a coat of paint on Thunder Road. - Oh, yeah? - Not thinking of changing your mind? - No way. - Good. Cos we're racing for pinks. Pinks? Pinks, punk. Pink slips. Ownership papers. Stop. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Hey, get the dude, man. - What did she give him? - A lock of hair. From her chest. Poor Kenickie. See a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck. Gimme that. If it were in any better condition, it would fly. - She's gonna. - I brought you this for good luck. Gee, thanks. - I'm sorry. - I'll get it. You putz! Put this under his head. - Zuko, he's out cold. - What are we gonna do? Kenickie. Talk to me, buddy. You OK? Yeah. I'm OK. I'm fine. (groans) - You can't drive. - No, really, I'm alright. I'm just seeing two of you, man. - Hey, you want me to drive for you? - Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Help him up. Marty, give me a hand. Hey. The rules are, there ain't no rules. To the second bridge and back. First one back wins. Haul ass, kid. You ain't gonna see me for dust, Zuko. Come on, baby. # For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow # For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny # Look at me # There has to be # Something more # Than what they see # Wholesome and pure # Oh, so scared and unsure # A poor man's Sandra Dee Danny won. - Isn't that great? - Yeah. What's the matter? Aren't you happy? Not really. But I think I know a way I could be. Could you help me? - Of course. - Can I come to your place? Sure. Come on. # Sandy, you must start anew # Don't you know what you must do? # Hold your head high - # Take a deep breath and sigh... - Come on, Sandy. # Goodbye # To Sandra Dee Attention, seniors. Before the merriment of commencement commences, I hope your years with us here at Rydell High have prepared you for the challenges you face. Who knows, among you, there may be a future Eleanor Roosevelt, or a Rosemary Clooney. And among you young men, there may be a Joe DiMaggio, a President Eisenhower or even a Vice President Nixon. But always you will have the glorious memories of Rydell High. Rydell forever. Bon voyage. Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering. - How many? - One. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. How did I flunk phys ed? Did I take phys ed? Step right up here! It's for a wonderful cause. The Teachers' Retirement Fund. Give 'em a pie in the puss. Coach, how could you flunk the T-Birds? Don't worry. You'll get diplomas. Just come back to summer school. - Summer school? - Look out! If you'd come to class, you wouldn't have missed me. Wise guy, huh? Take that, Coach! Why, you couldn't pitch one inning. - What's your name? I want you. - Eugene. - You're a great pitcher. - Thank you. Rizzo! Rizzo! Get off of that. You got a condition. Forget it. It was a false alarm. I'm not pregnant. Whoo-hooo! I'Il, erm, make an honest woman of you. Listen, fella, if this is a line, I ain't biting. That's a bona fide offer. Well, it ain't moonlight and roses, but... - Hey, there's Zuko. - You gotta be kidding, man! - What is this? Halloween? - Where did you swipe the sweater? While you tools were out stealing hubcaps, I lettered in track. I can't believe it. Danny Zuko turned jock? - That's right, I did. - What you doing? Deserting us? You guys can't follow a leader all your lives. Come on, you know you mean a lot to me, but Sandy does, too. I'm gonna do anything I can to get her. Sandy?

Apollo is going left. He's going for another left. Another left. Now he's gone for the left. Down on one knee. Lou Filippo in there wiping off the glove. A hard left and a right combination. What is keeping him up, Bill? I don't know. He can't even get his gloves up to protect himself. Down! Down! Stay down! Apollo dancing around with his arms in the air. Five, six, seven, eight, nine... Come on! Apollo can't believe it. The champion got a left to the ribs, his right ribs. You okay, champ? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. Your rib's broken. He broke my ribs! I can't see nothing. Gotta open my eye. Cut me, Mick. I don't want to do it! Go on, cut me. Cut me. Okay. Try and cut it. You're bleeding inside, champ. I'm gonna stop the fight. Hey, you ain't stopping nothing, man. You ain't stopping nothing. You stop this fight, I'll kill you! All right. I won't stop it. I'm going! You want to go... Last round! You gotta give it your all! Get it off! You gotta get him down in the body. There's the bell for the 15th and final round. You better start fighting. You been doing nothing. You been doing nothing. They look like they've been in a war, these two. Come on over here. Apollo, the champion, really tagged him. And Apollo clearly protecting his right side, his ribs. Oh, look at that! Body punches! Hard left and right. Oh, look at the blood coming out of his mouth. He's spitting up blood now. He takes one to the head. A tremendous right hand from Rocky. Go for it. Go for it, Rock! Listen to this crowd! Left to the ribs. Another to the ribs. That left hand again. A right to the chin! He's got him up against the ropes! Apollo, the champion... Ain't gonna be no rematch. Ain't gonna be no rematch. Don't want one. There's chaos. Rocky, you went the distance. You went the 15 rounds. How do you feel? All right. All right. What were you thinking about when that buzzer sounded off? Adrian! What did you think about in the 15th round when you were coming out? Adrian! Rocky. Rocky. Rocky! Rocky! We have had the privilege of witnessing the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring. Adrian! Rocky! Ladies and gentlemen... Rocky! ...we have a split decision. Adrian! Eight for Apollo Creed! Rocky! Those fans out there deserve a rematch. Ain't gonna be no rematch. Come on! I had enough things in my face today! Adrian! Rocko! That's my friend. Rocko! You're breaking my jacket. Paulie! Adrian! Rocky! Adrian! Rocky! Hey, where's your hat? I love you! I love you. I love you! I love you! I love you. Hey, Rock! Hey, Rocky! Rocky Balboa! Get them out of here! Let him breathe, will you? Give him air! Sit down, Rocky. Sit down. Rocky, do you think you had it won? I don't know. I... How about a statement, Rocky? I don't know. I'm at a loss for words. Get back there! Rocky, do you think you had it won? I don't know. Rocky, stay! Where's the doctor? How's my nose look? As bad as Mickey's? It ain't that horrible. Now give him a break. Just one more. Get out of there. Rocky, is that the worst beating you ever took? You! No, you're gonna get worse if you don't get out of here. Rocky, what did you think going into the last round? I don't know. That I should have stayed in school or something. Rocky, do you think you have brain damage? I don't see any. Where is he? Where is he? Apollo, how about a statement? Get away from me! How about a statement, Apollo? Hey, Stallion! Stallion! You got a dull skull, Stallion. You're lucky, so lucky. What you did was a miracle. You're the luckiest man on the face of the Earth. I want you to know that, Stallion. Do I look lucky? Look, nobody goes the distance with me. Get up out of that chair, chump, and let's finish this fight right now. Apollo, don't, please. Sit down. Is he serious? Were you going down? Did the bell save you, Apollo? Bell nothing, man. I can beat that chump. I'll fight him any place, any time. Does that mean there'll be a rematch? I said any place, any time, man. Can you hear? Hey, yo, Apollo, you said there weren't gonna be no rematch. Look, chump, any place, any time. Rocky, a rematch could be worth millions. Well, I'm officially retired now. Don't you run out on me now. Don't you run out on me, Stallion. I gave you a shot the first time. Now I'm ready to give you a second shot. He sure has a lot of energy. You know, you got nothing to prove. I don't care what the hell them judges said. This is the man that won the fight! I'm gonna show you how lucky you are! You're gonna fight me again, chump! Come back here! Don't run out on me! Come back here, Rock! Yo, Adrian? Yes. You'd better go home 'cause I'm gonna be busy healing here for a while, you know. I want to be here. No, maybe you better go home with Paulie and get some sleep... Wait a minute. Get some sleep, you know. I love you. I love you. I love you. See you. See you later. See you, Mick. Can you fix my nose? I'm a little depressed about my nose. We'll fix that all right. It's the eye that concerns me. The eye's great. I ain't never really felt this good. You guys should've seen us tonight. We did good. I almost won, you know... You should've seen it. You had him in the 10th, and in the 15th he was gone. You think so? Trust me. I was there. How's your face, Rock? I don't know. How's it look? I wouldn't want it. Rocky, I got a little favor I'd like to ask of you. You know, your friend Gazzo, he admires you a lot. Tell him to give me your old job with him. You mean collecting? Yeah, I'm good with numbers. Yeah. Okay. As soon as I get finished, you know, healing here, I'll tell him to give you my old job, okay? I'd appreciate that. What are you doing here? Visiting hours are over. I have to ask you to leave. Now. Okay. See you later, Paulie. Okay. Everybody's proud of you, Rock. Yeah? Yeah. Now. I feel good tonight. Yeah, you look good. Let's go. How are we feeling tonight? Oh, very handsome. That tastes good. My kid would die for your autograph. Sure. Would you sign it, please, ""To my good friend, Charlie Flynn."" My hands are so sore. It's okay. It's my first autograph. Thank you. You're welcome. ""To my good friend, Charlie Flynn,"" who I don't even know. Yo, Apollo? Who is it? It's just me, Rocky. Listen. Could you answer me one question? Yeah, sure. Did you give me your best? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. This coming year, you know, Rocky. How you feeling? You all right? Yeah, I feel great being outside. This coming year, you're gonna make $300,000 with us. Yeah? This fiscal year. Hey, Rock! Hey, how you doing, Pete? Hey, could you sign my head? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Hope it don't go to your brain.

Here, sign, Rocky. It's a standard deal. Wait. I want to talk to you a little bit about this here. It's a standard deal... Just for talking about shaving stuff? That's all you do. Sledgehammers, whatever. Batteries... We've got all kinds, of course, all kinds of commercials, so it could be anything. Like balls and baseballs? Yeah, you're gonna make $300,000. You gotta strike now while the iron's hot, you know. Yeah. 20 minutes, it's all over. Yeah, people kind of forget, you know. The time is now, if you want to make a dollar. Right now. Here. Sign it here. It takes you two seconds to sign. It's a standard deal. Okay, I tell you what, I'll sign it, but I gotta go somewhere now. Where you going? What could be more important than this? I just gotta do some things, but I'll be back. I'll talk to you. Give me a call, then. Where will we call you? I'll give you a call. I call you. You got a number? I'll just call you. I'll go, ""Hey! Yo!"" I'll call you. Okay. All right, you call. Here. The guy's got brain damage. You know, it's great being out of the hospital and not having to take all those pills and everything. And my legs were getting so sore and all that, you know, just laying there. I was kind of shrinking and all that. It's great to be outside, you know? What are we doing here at the zoo? Well, you know, I kind of like the zoo a lot, you know. It's a special place, especially when it snows, you know, it kind of smells clean and everything like that, you know. Don't you like the zoo? Huh? I like the zoo. Yeah, me, too. You know, I was wondering, like, what do you think you're doing for, like, the next 40 or 50 years? What do you mean? I was wondering if you wouldn't mind marrying me very much. What'd you say? If you wouldn't mind marrying me too much. Yes. I'd like to marry you. Yeah? Yes. Yeah? Yes. I'll be a good guy, I promise. I ain't gonna do nothing wrong. I ain't gonna leave no hair in the sink or nothing like that, you know. Things are gonna be great, you know that? Hey! Hey, we're getting married, you know. You want to come? If you can get out for the weekend, I'll send you an invitation, Mr. Tiger! That's fantastic, ain't it? Yeah, absolutely. Yes. I do. Thanks. You may kiss the bride now.

Excuse me, can I borrow the bridegroom for one minute? You look beautiful, Adrian. Yeah, she really turned out pretty. Now, listen, how much money you make from your last fight? I mean, how much money did you clear? About 37 grand. I know, taxes kill you. Hey, what do you wanna do with your money now? You want to put them on the street? Hey, Tony, I just got married in here. I know, and I'm happy for you. How's about investing in condominiums? It's safe. Condominiums? Yeah, condominiums. I never use them. Hey, yo! What are youse doing? Hey, Rock! What's happening, man?

Are you getting tired? No, this is great for the arms. I think it is. I can't believe we're married. Oh, we are. I got proof in my pocket. Everything happened so fast. Yeah. But I knew what was gonna happen from the start. What did you know? Well... The first time I see you, I says to myself, I says, even though this girl is suffering from the disease of being shy, underneath them sweaters and hat and... What did you have on? About 20 sweaters, was it? No, three. Yeah, Three Sweaters is the best girl in Philly, you know. Oh. Oh, yeah! I said that. I said that. Oh, yeah. Really? All right, here we are, safe and sound.

I love you, too. Hey, yo! It's a nice car, Rock. It's a great car. Well, here's the papers, Rock. Thanks a lot. Yeah. Congratulations. Lots of luck. Thanks a lot. Same to you. Same to you. Isn't that nice? We really don't need a car. Oh, come on, Adrian. You know, I'm gonna be doing commercials now. I can afford this, you know. No problem. Well, do you know how to drive? Do I know how to drive? Do you know how to drive? I'm one of the greats. Are you kidding? Come on. I'll drive you. Let me put you inside the car. This'll just be like Cinderella and the pumpkin, you know. Do you know how to drive? Do I know how to drive? I drive airplanes and bulldozers. I'd drive you crazy if you'd give me a chance, you know what I mean? Yo, Adrian! Look at this here. Tell me that wouldn't look great on you, huh? This coat here? Huh? What about that one? This coat's okay. Isn't that great? Look at this black thing here with the tiger on the back. You like animals? I love animals. Black. I like black. Black's kind of my favorite color. You want to buy them? I say we get them before someone else buys them. What do you say? Come on, Adrian. I think that would be perfect for her. Yeah, I think that's perfect, too. Don't you think this is kind of expensive, you know? Well, hey, do you like having a good time, huh? Yes. Then you need a good watch. I'll tell you what. I want to get one for Paulie, too, okay? We'll take these. What about one for yourself? One for me? One for you. I can't tell time very good, but, all right, I'll take one, too. Very good.

Hey, Gloria, you got something a little smaller? Yeah. Look at that. Oh, yeah. Look at that. You see? Now that's what I call class, huh? Real sharp. Yeah. You okay, Butkus? Nice house. I'd say that's a nice house in general, wouldn't you? Look at these bricks, Adrian. My husband's an expert on bricks. Are these new bricks? Yeah, this is a very solid neighborhood. Yeah? You're gonna like this very much. I like these bricks. There're very nicely done here. Look very solid. Nice. Nice mailbox. I like this mailbox. You know, these numbers almost add up to nine. I like that. That's a good omen. Oh, wow. Nice house. Really... Hey, Adrian. Baby, that's a great spot for the bag, you know. I could teach you how to work that bag someday, you know. Does it have copper plumbing? Upstairs and down. Yeah? This whole house is supported with steel. The whole thing. Yeah. All these floors are solid oak. Solid. Mrs. Balboa, can I show you the kitchen? I think you're gonna really like it. Solid. That's good to know. Hey, Adrian, that's a great spot for a radio. Right over there, you know? Look at these steps. Nice steps. Hey, nice kitchen. Nice. Nice kitchen, yes. Yeah. What are taxes every year? Hey, Adrian, I like it. I know a pretty good deal when I see one, too. Excuse me. I want to talk to my husband for one second. Can I talk to you? Can I talk to you? Sure, I'm available. I got no appointments. Rocky, you are making this man's job, you know, very easy. Now, the bank said it would give us a $16,000 first mortgage at 9.5%. Well, hey, that don't matter. I say we get the house now. Yeah, but we didn't even go upstairs. That don't matter. That's just details. I'm sure it's nice. Details, huh? Are you sure? Absolutely. Okay? All right, we'll take the house. And it better not leak, or else. You know, I just wanted to tell you something. Excuse me. Could you stand over there? I gotta talk secretly with my wife. Okay? Sure, sure. I understand. Yeah. You know, I kind of feel stupid, talking like this with the lights on and everything, but, you know, the house here and the solid oak floors, and all that stuff, and the plumbing, wouldn't be nothing without you being here, 'cause, I don't know, without you being here, I probably... I wouldn't be here either, you know. You don't have to speak. No? Okay. Let's go celebrate here. I'll beat you to the pool! Hey, you guys. Slow down. Mary Anne. Mary Anne, listen to this. ""You didn't beat nobody, and anybody who knows boxing knows the fight was fixed."" This one came from London. ""You call yourself the champ. You're a fake. ""The fight was a fake. Go kill yourself."" Wouldn't you rather play with the children than read hate mail? ""How much did you get to carry that bum for 15 rounds? ""You're a disgrace to your people."" Why can't you ignore it? Are you serious? Come on, let me get you in focus there. All right, I'm ready. Are you blind, Rock? What are you getting wise with me? Come on! Throw the ball, Swifty. Let me see your best here. I'm waiting for you. I'm waiting for you. You can't even play stickball! Hey, come on. I'm ready now. I'm just warming up. Are you ready for this? You better keep your mouth closed. It's coming in that direction. What a shot! Now I know the day weren't no waste. Come on, Swifty. Yeah? Yes. Yo, Adrian! You did it! Oh, yeah! I knew you had it in you. You woke up this morning, you had a smile on your face. I said, ""Something special's gonna happen today."" I wasn't sure what, but I knew it was gonna be different. You know, I was thinking, if this kid has your good looks, you know, and your good brains and my good left hook, he's really gonna be something. Oh, no, what if it's a girl? What if it's a girl? Oh, I didn't think about that. Well, she'll be everything I'm not. She won't have to be shy. We could give her singing and dancing lessons. Yeah. Yeah. How about a new dress every day? Would you like that? Have to hire a bodyguard when she starts going to school to keep all the boys away. You know how them little boys can be. Real pests in general, can't they? And if it's a boy, I'd like him to be just like the father. Don't you think one dumbbell in the family's enough? I'll tell you one thing, this kid ain't gonna get no tattoos. He ain't gonna be hanging around no corners, ain't gonna dress like no wiseguy like me. I'll tell you that. He's gonna be a good somebody like you. Like you. No, no, no. Like you. Like you. No, no. Like you. Like you. Yo, Adrian. We did it. Didn't we? How you feel, Rocky? Pretty good. Yeah? Listen, the reason we didn't call you a couple of months ago was we wanted to wait till the swelling went down. I see. But you look terrific now. Yeah? We're gonna make a buck together. Don't worry about it. Yeah. That's good. As a matter of fact, I got a deal today from Smart Deal Toy Company. Did you ever hear of them? No. Maybe Mrs. Rocky did. Did you ever hear of a Smart Deal Toy? No. No? Big. They're number one. And they want to make a Rocky doll. You understand? You can kick it. You can beat it. For kids. You can kick it. You can beat it. It does everything. Pretty smart, yeah. That's right. Takes a terrific beating. I think it's a great idea. We're gonna make a lot of money with it. Okay? Is he ready there? How do I look? The best. Fabulous. Adrian, how do I look? Different. Sensational. Come on, let's get it on. Okay. He's gonna be great. Don't be nervous. Yeah. How do I look? I look stupid, don't I? Yes. You got any deodorant? No. Excuse me. All right, we're ready. Let's go, Arthur. In the cage, Rock. Just the way we rehearsed. Everyone get ready for picture now. Come on, Rock. We're running late. Girls, come on. Look alive, dear. Girls... Yeah. A little higher. Show the product. Get ready here. That's it. Magic time! Look alive! Quiet on the set. Roll, please. Speed. Beast aftershave, take one. Action! Go now? Action. ""In the morning, I splash it on and it makes me smeel mainly."" ""Smeel mainly""? Cut! Isn't that ""smell manly""? Can you read that, Rock? Yeah. Well, let's go again. Well, excuse me. I know I said it wrong, but it really don't smell manly. I mean, do you think this stuff smells like a man? I'd say absolutely no. Are you finished? I'm sorry. Okay. Rolling again. Speed. Nice and quiet. Beast aftershave, take two. Action! ""In the morning, I splash it on and it surrounds my face with class."" Cut! Action! ""And Beast aftershave will turn the women into beasts."" Cut! Action! ""If you want to be the king of the beasts and smell like a jungle rat..."" Cat. Rat, cat. They look a little alike. Action! ""In the afternoon, when I put it on to go out with the guys, ""and have a rendezvouze..."" Cut! Cut! We're cutting this set. We're going to the alternate set. I can get it, you know... I'm sure you can. Will you get out of the cage? The word ""rendezvous."" Yes. Rendezvous over to the other set, Rock, if you don't mind. Sure. We've only wasted four hours. Arthur, Arthur, let's reorganize here. We're going to the alternate set. You know, it sounded great inside before it come out like that. Get the damn club away from him and get the girls into their other outfits. Where is the wardrobe people? Where are the prop people? All right, wet him down. Arthur, step out, please. Speed. Beast aftershave, ""The Contender."" Take seven. Try to get it right. Action! Hi. My name is Rocky Balboa, the Italian Stallion. They say I'm the American dream, but not 'cause... Can I do it over again? Christ! Cut. No, just keep it rolling. Keep it rolling. Just read it off the dummy cards. Dummy cards? Please! Go on. Wait a minute. I'd like to explain something. You know, I ain't punchy. I got what you call, like, I don't know, a relaxed brain, but I ain't punchy, you know. It's just the way I talk here. What's the difference? Can you just do it the way it's written? That ain't right. This whole thing here ain't right, you know. What isn't right? Well, you're a rude guy. I'm trying very hard and you're being rude. That's bad manners, ain't it, Adrian? Yes. I'll tell you, I gotta be almost punchy to be doing this in front of my wife. You want to quit? Then quit! Leave! Get out of here! I didn't want you for this setup in the first place. You have wasted, wasted our time, sir. This is a complete bust, the whole afternoon. Leonard. Leonard, where are you going? I want you to take him with you, Leonard. Take this man with you. He is not a professional. I only work with professionals. You cost us thousands of dollars because you can't read. ""'It's no time to cuss me,' snarled the robber. ""'By God, fellows, grab your rifles and take color... Cover.""' How does that sound? It's good. Yeah? You know, being a good reader's gonna help me get a good office job, you know? Want to hear some more? I can't wait. Okay. ""'There ain't no cover, Smokey,' said Brad Lincoln. ""'We better head for the canyon.""' You read nice. Thank you. You lie nice. Thank you. And how far did you go in high school, Mr. Balboa? Ninth. And one last question. Do you have a criminal record? Nothing worth bragging about. Would you be interested in some sort of manual labor? Well, I got nothing against honest manual labor. It's just that I'd like to see if I could make a living sitting down, like you're doing over there. Can I be honest? No one's going to offer you an office job. There's too much competition. Why don't you fight? I've read somewhere you're a very good fighter. Yeah? Well... Was you ever punched in the face 500 times a night, you know? Stings after a while, you know. Thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it. Mr. Balboa? Yeah. I'm very sorry. We have nothing. Are you sure? Next. Hey, look, pal, you gotta be realistic. You got no high school diploma, no qualifications. Wouldn't you be more content with a good-paying menial labor job? Thanks. The way I see it is, I can get another job if I want to, you know? But do I want to? Do I want to be doing something I ain't gonna be happy doing? Plus, you know, we need the money now, Butkus. Dogs don't want to hear my problems. Come on. Yeah. I wish I was a canine sometimes. Give me a kiss. The only job I got is lugging beef. You got nothing better for Rocky than hauling beef? Hey, that's all I got, and we're cutting back, too. So, Rocky, if you want to work, it'd be from week to week, okay? Well, that's okay with me, but when can I start? Well, how about tomorrow? Well, how about today? Okay. We got a load coming in. Great. Hey, Paulie, you look kind of skinny there, huh. Yeah, he's losing weight, ain't he? Don't bother to thank me. Hey, thanks a lot, Paulie, and you don't have to thank me for the watch, either. Quitting time! Hey, there's the best-looking thing I seen all day. You look tired. No, no. My face is tired. I feel okay. You want to take a hot bath? No, come on. I feel dynamic. Honest. Hey, listen. Tomorrow... I was thinking at work, maybe after work I'll take you out. You want to do something nice, huh? You want to do that? I'd like to do that. How's your stomach? All right. You all right? You look great. Do you know that? Hey, Rock, they just like old friends. Old friends never tasted this good. I heard that. Yo! Yo, Rock! You wanted me, Frank? I gotta let you go. How come? I'm working hard. I'm doing good. Yeah, real good, but we gotta cut back on manpower and you ain't got enough time in, you know? Seniority. How about if I take a cut in pay, all right? Can't do it. Union rules. Union rules. Can I finish out the day? Sure. Hey, Rocky, I'm sorry. Yeah, me, too. You got more stories than a book, you know that? There's my brother-in-law, Rocky. Give me the five. My brother-in-law come to visit me. How you doing? How's everything been? How's business? Okay? Yeah. Looking over your old stomping ground? Yeah. Listen, Paulie, you want to buy this car, you know. I thought you liked it. It's okay, but I don't need it no more. You know, I have a hard time making these right turns with my bad eye. Keep hitting trash cans and things like that. You got problems at home? You need bread? No, no, everything's okay. You know, this car would look great wrapped around you, you know. Wouldn't it? Look, you need a hand-out, I'll give you a hand-out. No, I don't need no hand-out, Paulie. Look, you want to buy the car? Sure. Why don't you be smart and fight again? That's okay. I don't need to fight no more. Listen, you want to buy the car? You want to pick up the payments and all of that? Is my sister giving you a hard time? You know, if she is, you break her teeth. I appreciate the advice, Paulie, but I kind of like her teeth, you know, where they are. Okay? Here you go. You bought yourself a car. Good car, you know. Gotta buckle up for safety and all that. Where you going? You need a lift? Nah. See you around. Hey, say hi to my sister for me! Hey, listen, if you two need the car, just ask! When did you get home? I thought you were at work. No, I ain't at work no more. I got... I got canned today. What happened? I don't know. I was... You know, it's nobody's fault. They were just cutting back, you know. It was economics. What are you gonna do? I don't know. I was thinking about fighting. What about your eye, you know? The doctor said you shouldn't fight anymore. No, no. He recommended I don't fight, and I recommend that I do. You'll go blind. Nobody's going blind. Honest, I see great, you know. I see like a beagle or something like that. You could be whatever you want to be. You don't have to fight anymore. You know, I am a fighter, not too good, but that's what I do. Oh, Rocky, you gave me your word you wouldn't fight anymore. I mean, if we need money, I could get a job. You don't have to do that. Oh, sure. I can get my job back, you know, part-time, at the pet shop. But I'm the one who's supposed to support. It's just for a little while. Listen, what if you catch some pet shop disease or something? There are no pet shop diseases, Rocky. I mean, really, I want to work. Do you really want to do it? Yeah. We need the money. It'll come in handy. Well, maybe you're right, you know. You know what's best, you know. Could you start dinner? I'm starting to get a little hungry. I just want to finish my workout here, okay? Sure. Jesus. Who the hell is that? Avon lady. Is that Rocky? Hey! I don't remember giving you no key. Come on up here. Well, the prodigal son returns! You don't look so bad, do you, kid? What's that, an outer space monster you brought? No, that's Butkus, my large dog. What's that in your ear there? Oh, this? I hear stupid things better. Well, now, did you come here to show me that dog? No. Mick, can I have my locker back? Yeah. What's on your mind? Fighting. Fighting? What? You want to go blind? Nobody's going blind. You heard what I said? Yeah, and the eye's great. No problem. Now, listen, every pug thinks he has one good one left. Now forget it, 'cause your fighting career is over, kid. Is that right? Yeah, I think that's right. You know, I spend my whole life getting a career. I get one, and you tell me it's over. What's the matter here? You shook the hell out of the champion of the whole wide world. You be happy with that. Well, maybe we can do better this time. Or worse. What about that? Hey, yo, Mick. I done you a favor last time, you know. Can you do me one this time? I don't know. You don't understand me. Now, look, I want to show you something now. Test you. Now, look, you look right there at the end of my nose, will you? Okay. I want to test you. Look at your nose. You look at my nose now. When I bring my finger in, you tell me when you see it, will you? Okay. There's the little thing. I see it. That's good. I told you. It's okay. Now, wait. Now we'll try the other lamp. Now, look here, will you? Now, tell me. I see it. No, you see nothing. Creed would have caved in the whole side of your face. Now, forget it, kid. You got the heart, but you ain't got the tools no more. Now, forget it! Is that right? That is right. Yeah? Well, maybe it's you who ain't got it no more, you know that? Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Now, look, you didn't even see that coming, did you? No. Well, that was from a broken-down pug like me. What do you think the champ would do to you? I don't know. Hurt me bad. No. He'd hurt you permanent. Permanent. You know, Mick, if... If I can't fight no more, maybe I can help out around here, you know. Here? Well, sure, but... You know, you're like royalty here, kid. You want those guys to see you carrying towels and buckets around? Where's your dignity? I don't know how to say this. I just... I gotta be around it. All right, kid. Will you come back tomorrow? Thanks a lot, Mick. Look, I don't know about anybody else, but as long as I'm gonna be promoting this fight myself, I want a lot more pressure put on for a rematch. Hey, we can get the same money for the two top contenders. Why go after Balboa? Why? Because there's still a lot of people out there that think he won. There's a lot of people out there accusing me of having the fight fixed, accusing me of being a fake, and insulting my kids at school. That's why. You want to hear the truth? Yeah, I want to hear the truth. The truth is that last time he was damn lucky. Now he's all finished. I mean, he's been hanging around doing nothing for six months. And any trainer worth anything wouldn't have nothing to do with him. Now, I say, let's go after some new meat. Forget this bum. Do you think I beat him the last time? Do you? You got the decision. Man, I won, but I didn't beat him! What are you afraid of, Tony? Honest? Yeah, honest. He's all wrong for us, baby. I saw you beat that man like I never saw no man get beat before, and the man kept coming after you. Now, we don't need that kind of man in our life. I know what you're feeling. Let it go. Let it go. You're the champ. Thank you. Look, you're in charge of my public relations, right? I want a whole new campaign started. I want something done publicly to bring this man out. I want something done to jar this man's pride. I want something done to get the people around him talking. All right? You realize if we use this humiliation tactic, you're setting yourself up as the bad guy. Look, man, whatever gets him in the ring. What's happening? Hey. What? Where's your heart? What are you talking about? You heard me. Well, what's this? It's kind of funny, don't you think? Hey, hey, Chico, listen. Hey, hey, listen. What's with the grin? How'd you get so happy with yourself? Let me tell you something. Snarl more, you see. Now, a good snarl can give you what the Bible calls a psychological edge, because you snarl on your punches. Wait a minute. Hey, Rock! Rock, come here a minute. Show this Latin lamebrain how to snarl and punch. Show him that. That's it, you see. That's ugly! That's a snarl. Hey, John, will you empty them buckets? They're flowing over. Will you do that? Hey, Johnny, I'll do it. No, let him do it. I got it, Rock. Come on, I don't mind. Hey, Rock... Hey, wait a minute. Now you can take it. Whoops. Hey! Can't you think of anything tougher to say than, ""Whoops""? Come on, hit that right. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yo, Rock. Yo, Tony. How you doing? How am I doing? No, how are you doing? Look, I heard you was working in this dump. Now what are you doing, huh? Give it to me straight, brother. Oh, you know, I'm sweeping up, making a few bucks here and there. You ain't no janitor, Rock. You don't need a job like this. Besides, you're Italian. Now you come back and work for me, Rock. Yeah, well, what would I be doing? You mean, like, you know, like collecting or something? Well, what else? Look, you come back. You work on the docks, get some fresh air. It stinks in here. Yo, Tony, I appreciate the offer, but... I can't do that stuff no more. It's healthy, huh? Now, look, I gotta go. Take it easy, huh, champ? Yeah. See you around. Remember that guy, Rock? Yo! How's everybody in the clubhouse tonight? Oh, fine. How'd your day go? A million laughs. You know, it was great. You need some help with that? Yes. Yes. Okay. Hey, you know, Adrian, I was thinking maybe you ought to stay home and rest your stomach, you know. Come on, Rock, it's just part-time. We need the money. Yeah, well, maybe you're right. There we go. That ain't my brand. I like oatmeal. Hey, listen, why don't we forget all this work? Listen, you want to come home with me now, and maybe I'll tell you a few jokes on the way home, and maybe you'll laugh, you know? We need a few laughs in our life. What do you think? Maybe? Yes. Maybe? Maybe. Maybe? Okay. Let's get out of here, okay? Okay. Here we go. Hey, listen, Adrian. Yeah. Listen to this one. Why do cows wear bells? Why? 'Cause their horns don't work. Is that killing you? No? Oh, God! They really used to like it in third grade. I used to break everybody up with that one. Yo! You really sweep good, man! Is he talking to you? Nah, he probably has me mixed up with somebody else. Come on. Italian chicken. Boy, you guys got the easy life. Hey, how you guys doing? Did anybody move today, you know, huh? How's life in the bowl? You gotta exercise once in a while. Would you like a little snacklet or something? Here you go. Come on, Cuff. Hey, Link, what, you drowning down there? Hey, want to hear some TV? Want to hear some TV? The Los Angeles Rams. The Rams defeated the Buccaneers in overtime, 13 to 10, on Frank Corell's 45-yard field goal. Hey, Butkus. Come here, Butkus. Come here, boy. What did you do today, huh? Did you bark at anybody today? Yo, Adrian! Sometimes I look at Butkus and I don't think he's a normal canine. Well, what do you think he is? I don't know. He just don't look like a regular dog to me sometimes, you know, when I look inside there. Earlier today I was down at Apollo Creed's palatial gym, and, as usual, the world champion was not at a loss for words about Rocky Balboa. Look, I know a lot of people out there want to see me in a rematch with a timid fellow who calls himself the Italian Stallion. But this man does not have the honor to meet me in the ring. Or is it Scallion? Now, listen, in fairness, Apollo... What's his name? What is your name? ...Rocky Balboa did officially retire. Yeah. The bum's hiding. The bum's running. He doesn't want to face me. He's scared. You know it and I know it. Apollo, I think there's more here than meets the eye. You've been under close scrutiny ever since that split-decision victory. A lot of reporters, Apollo, including me, thought it was an even draw. That's your opinion and you're entitled to it. But now I'm ready to have a rematch, to prove that this lucky club fighter, and that's what he was, lucky, does not have the skill to last five minutes in the ring with a superior athlete like me. The man's running, the man's hiding. The man doesn't want to face me. So I say to you, Rocky Balboa, or whatever your name is, that I want the American people to know, I want the whole world to know, that I'm ready, willing, and able to meet you anywhere. Any place, any time, I will meet and defeat this so-called fighter, who calls himself the Italian Stallion, if the man only has the guts to give me a call. And you can call me collect. Call me, Balboa! This would be a legitimate rematch, the boxer against the puncher, and I think everyone wants to see them back in the ring together. But there's only one problem, where is Rocky Balboa? Ugly bum! You know, I was thinking that I ain't supposed to do no commercials and I ain't supposed to work in no meat house. I'm supposed to be a fighter. But you gave that up. Yeah. I think I'm becoming a nobody again, too. In whose eyes? Not mine. In mine. In here. We'll get by. That's just it. I don't want you to get by the hard way, you know? I want you to have good things. I want the kid to have good things. We'll have them. I just think we need them now, don't you? Rocky, please... You don't have to prove anything. Adrian, it's all I know. I don't want you to do it. It's all I know. Adrian? You know, I never asked you to stop being a woman, you know? Please, I'm asking you, please, don't ask me to stop being a man. Please. I think we ought to knock his block off. Absolutely. Rocky. I'm sorry. Well... Let's do it. Apollo! Has a site been chosen for the rematch? This fight will be held in the Philadelphia Spectrum, 'cause I want this man's hometown to see this. I want all of Philadelphia, I want all of America, I want the whole world to see me destroy this man after two short rounds. Because after this fight, he's gonna have to donate what's gonna be left of his body to science. But there won't be much. That I can guarantee you. Rocky, what do you think about the fight taking place in the Spectrum? Well, I'm very happy about that. Why? Well, it's only about 10 minutes from my house, the Spectrum. Apollo, a lot of people say that you lost the first fight, a victim of the southpaw jinx. Did fighting a left-hander throw you off? Southpaw jinx nothing! Last time, I took the fight too lightly, and this man was just plain lucky. But this time... This time you all will see the real Apollo Creed. The world is gonna see the real Apollo Creed. Lightning fast and hard to catch. No playing, no jiving, just business. All right. Looks like he's got a good chance. Rocky, do you think you have a chance this time against Apollo? I don't know. He looks pretty mad. Me and Mick, we're gonna try our best. His lungs he's gonna punch out. Now, who's that? Al Capone? I wouldn't sweat you. Look here, look here, a lot of people may not like me, and that's okay. But come November, Apollo Creed will provide the ultimate gala spectacle, on Thanksgiving, in front of this man's home crowd. I'm gonna drop him like a bad habit. Rocky, your pay for the fight is very substantial. What are you gonna do with the money? Well, the first thing I gotta do is I gotta pay the rent, you know. And then, well, I made this list on the way over. I was just thinking of things to do. I'd like to get a couple of hats, and a motorcycle, and a couple of quarts of perfume for Adrian. She likes to smell good. And some Muppet toys. You know, Ernie and Big Bird and that frog. What's his name? Kermit or something? I don't know. And I thought maybe a statue for the church, and I think a snow cone machine for you, Paulie. You like snow cones, don't you? Yeah. Rocky, got anything derogatory to say about the champ? ""Derogatory""? Yeah. He's great. How about some clowning shots, Apollo? Yeah. Does this look like a circus to you, man? Come November, you're mine. He's very upset. Well... See how smooth he moves there? See how he pumps that jab into your eye? Yeah. You got guts to go back in the ring with him, kid. Thanks a lot, Mick. Your style's too easy to figure out. I mean, left-handed fighters they're the worst, you know. They lead with their face mostly. Trying to throw that big left. Right's no damn good. They ought to outlaw southpaws. Yeah, why didn't you tell me this before? I didn't want to hurt your feelings. Now, look. To pull this miracle off, you gotta change everything. You gotta learn to be a right-handed fighter. Now, this will confuse Apollo, and it'll protect that bad eye. I can't learn how to fight right-handed no more. What's ""can't""? There ain't no ""can'ts""! There's no ""can'ts."" Now, he will beat you uglier than you are now. Now, listen, you start fighting right-handed, and then you change suddenly, and that'll make history, but first you gotta get speed. Demon speed. Speed's what we need. We need greasy, fast speed! Now, I'll show you a trick how to get some speed in them legs. Do you have to wear that stinking sweatshirt? Well, it brings me luck, you know. You know what it brings? It brings flies. Now, listen, I want you to try... Listen to me. I want you to try to chase this little chicken. Well, what do I gotta chase a chicken for? It's embarrassing, you know. First, because I said so. And second, because chicken-chasing is how we always used to train in the old days. Yeah. You catch this thing, you can catch greased lightning. Ready? Yeah, well, I'd rather eat it than chase it. It ain't very mature. Well, if you say so. Well, neither are you very mature! Now, listen, get this thing. I'm a fighter. I ain't a farmer. Come on at it! Go on and get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Come on! What's the matter with you? Get him! Pick him up! Pick him up! Pull him round! What's the matter? You're so fast. Are you standing still or something? Speed! Speed! Can't you catch a little chicken? Come on! Move your tail! Move your tail! You look like a girl out there. What's the matter with you? I feel like a Kentucky fried idiot. Wake up, will you? Would you wake up? Come on. Come on. Give it. Give it. Yo, Rock. What's the matter with my sister? Well, boy, I wish you'd go talk to her. You know, Adrian don't like this none. She's started crying and everything. She don't like me fighting. What's with this domestic stuff? Tend to the business, will you? Jab that till it hurts! Five hundred times without stopping. Do you hear me? 500 times. Hey, Mick, I want to use my other arm. If you do, I'm gonna chop it off. Is that clear? I'll figure something. Yeah, I wish you would, Paulie. I appreciate it, you know. I'm sorry. Are you finished? Yeah. Can we go to work? That would be nice. Now, hit that bag. Hit it. Jab it till it hurts. Go ahead. Three, four... Yeah, I want 500 high ones. Go! Where was I? Seven or eight? One, two. One, two. One, two. Come on. Turn it over. Come on. Snap it. Come on. Come on. Dig! Dig! Dig! All right, pick it up. Come on. Pick them up. Pick them up. Faster! Faster! Faster! Come on! Faster! Time! Time! Get up! Get me another one, all right? Come on. You gotta ease up on these sparring partners. You just get me another, man. Time! What's the matter? That bag too fast for you? You're gonna pound that sass right out of him. Last time we should have won, but this time you're gonna be scary, kid. You're gonna be a greasy, fast, Italian monster! You're gonna eat lightning! You're gonna crap thunder! We'll have to put you in a cage, kid. Let's take a break, Mick, all right? Break? What break? Where are you going? We're not finished. Hey, I said where the hell you going? I'm talking to myself. Speed! Speed! Catch that punk! Speed, damn it, speed! Can't you catch that little squirt? Can't you? Get off your rear! Get the lead out! Move. Move! Fast! You look dead out there. If you can catch that little speedball, you're gonna catch Creed easy. Come on! Move! Move! All right. Time! Hey, dead ass. Get over here. Hey, you sick, kid? Kid, what's the matter with you? Nothing. Let me tell you something, kid. Now, for a 45-minute fight, you gotta train hard for 45,000 minutes. Forty-five thousand. That's 10 weeks. That's 10 hours a day. You listening? And you ain't even trained one. I don't know what the hell you're waiting for. What are you waiting for? I don't know. Suit yourself. Yo, Rocky. Hey, yo, Paulie. How you doing? I'm worried about you. I've been watching. What? Your head ain't screwed on right. Nah, come on. I'm doing okay. You know, I've been thinking. You know, would you like to work my corner? Want to get involved in this fight, you know? Get involved in what? Watching you get murdered? Oh, come on. I'm doing okay. Come on. My sister got you so guilty, you're running all over the place. She'll be all right. It ain't all right. Hey, Paulie, it's okay, all right? It's not okay. Just leave Adrian alone, all right? Hey, kid, carry this, will you? Because I liked you better when you was carrying spit. What's that supposed to mean? It means that you're training like a ninth-rate pug who ought to be pumping gas in Jersey someplace. Yeah? Yeah, that's what it means. I think I'm gonna go take a shower, Mick. That's a good idea. Soak your head someplace. Soak it good. Yo, Adrian! Where are you? Paulie. Yeah, Paulie. What the hell you doing? What do you mean? What the hell you doing? About what? About messing up that guy over there. Don't start with me, Paulie. I'm just trying to keep him safe. Yeah, what? Feeding these goddamn squirrels? Did I teach you how to do that? Ditching the guy when he needs your help? I can't believe my ears. You didn't teach me anything, Paulie. You didn't teach me anything, and I never hurt Rocky. You're messing up his brain real bad. You know that? That's not what I'm doing. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, don't tell me! He's gonna get hurt because of you! It's not true. Don't say that! I'm saying it. Come across and tell him it's all right. It's not all right, Paulie. If he goes blind, you walk away. I can't. I love him. You don't! What are you doing? What are you doing? What's wrong? Adrian, what's the matter? Come on. Where are your guts? What's your problem, Mick? My problem? Yeah. You got the problem, kid. You got a ticker problem. What's the matter? You got nothing left inside? 'Cause you're training like a damn bum, you know that? Bum? A bum. Maybe you're right. Maybe I ain't got it no more. All right. Then don't you waste my time no more. You hear that? Go away! Go back to the docks where you belong. You go back to being a two-bit nothing! But don't you ever come back here again, because I'm too old to waste my time trying to train a no-good loser like you, you bum! Hey, Rock, they want you across the street. What's the matter? Your wife's sick. Mr. Balboa? I'm Dr. Cooper. The baby is fine, even though it's a month premature. What is it? It's a boy. Holy smoke. I didn't know she could do it. Yeah, well, how is Adrian? Where is Adrian? She's had complications. Like what? Your wife was hemorrhaging when she was brought in. The premature delivery was most likely caused by straining or overwork, and the sudden loss of blood has caused her to slip into a coma. Adrian, it's me. They said outside you're very sick, but I... I don't want to believe that. Maybe you're just tired, you know. Don't worry about nothing. You just sleep as long as you want, okay? And I'm gonna be here when you wake up. Rocky, come on. You're not doing any good here. No, I can't... Let's go see the kid. Adrian would want it. No. We gotta see him together. It's okay. We gotta see him together. Mr. Balboa, visiting hours are over. Can't I stay? I'll be quiet. I'm sorry. Hospital rules. I can't do any more of this watching stuff. Do you have a chapel? Yes, we do. Good night. Rock, it's 3:00 in the morning. You know that I went up to your house. They told me you was here. It's 3:00 a.m., kid. That Adrian, she's a good girl. Me, you know, I'm sorry for both of you. Well, ain't nothing I can do, is there? Except... I'd like to tell you something once, and then I ain't gonna say it again. Well, Rocky, you got another shot. It's a second shot at the... I don't know, the biggest title in the world. And you're gonna be swapping punches with the most dangerous fighter in the world. And just in case, you know, your brain ain't working so good, all this happens pretty soon. And you ain't ready. You're nowhere near in shape. So, I say, you know, for God's sake, why don't you stand up and fight this guy hard, like you done before? That was beautiful! But don't lay down in front of him like this! Like a... I don't know, like some kind of mongrel or something. 'Cause he's gonna kick your face in pieces. You know that? That's right. This guy just don't want to win, you know. He wants to bury you. He wants to humiliate you. He wants to prove to the whole world that it was nothing but some kind of a freak the first time out. He said you're a one-time lucky bum. Well, now, I don't... I don't want to get mad in a biblical place like this, but I think you're a hell of a lot more than that, kid. A hell of a lot. But, now, wait a minute. If you want to blow it... If you want to blow this thing, damn it, I'm gonna blow it with you. Do you want to stay here? I'll stay with you. I'll stay with you. Yeah. I'll stay and pray. What have I got to lose? It's gonna be okay. ""There ain't no other trail to the ranch, or no shorter one. ""'Oh, yes, there is,' said Marvel. ""'When I was a kid, I helped my old man ""'trail some cattle up from the border.""' Can you hear me, Adrian? Keep listening. Keep listening. ""After breakfast, Bruce watched the party get away on the chase. ""He saw Cora and Kay and Bud ""start up the valley 15 minutes ahead of the others. ""At the last minute, the girl..."" ""Replied Olga, 'Buck Mason? Who is he?' ""White pointed towards Marvel, who was leading the horses to the corral."" Well, I just wrote this thing for you, Adrian. I don't know. Maybe you'll like it. I'll just read it to you, 'cause... ""Remember when we was on ice skates, ""and I thought you were supposed to be great, ""but I kept giving you lip and you kept trying to slip, ""so I could catch you? ""That was our first date. And after that every day was great. ""So now I want you to know that wherever you go, ""Atlantic City or in the snow, don't worry about a thing. ""'Cause as long as I got this ring, I'll always be there to catch you."" I knew you'd come back. Thank you, God. Anybody want a refill? Adrian, it costs six bucks a bottle. I don't need that. I ain't drinking now. So, you haven't seen the baby? No, come on. I was waiting to... I've seen him. ...see him together. Hey, the kid's a winner. He's got forearms like him, Mickey. Here he is now. Look. Oh, no. There's your mommy. Oh, baby! Is that it? I can't believe it. He's ours? Yeah. He's really ours? Thank you. Come on. You done all the work. Adrian, I can't believe you done this. Believe me, we did. Oh, no. He ain't got a name. What do you want to call him? Paulie's a great name. Yeah, Paulie's a pretty good name. What about after the father? Rocky, Jr? Come on. You really want to do that? Yes. Adrian, he's the best I ever seen. You really done good. You look so tired. Why don't you go get some sleep? Oh, no, no. I feel great. I feel great. Listen, I been thinking. If you don't want me mixing with Creed no more, we'll make out some other kind of way, you know. There's one thing I want you to do for me. What? Come here. What? Win. Win. What are we waiting for? Take us! Faster! Faster! Keep moving! Keep moving! Faster. Pick them up! Pick them up! That's it. That's it. Yeah. Speed! Speed! Come on! Come on! Don't be a slouch. Fifty-eight, 59... One more! Come on, man! Push. Push. Forty-four, 45, 46. Yeah! Forty-seven, Again! Again! Now get that out of here! Come on! Push! Don't give up! Get that olive oil out of you! Push! Twenty-seven, 28... Forty-one, 42, 43... Forty-six, 47... Push! Push! Again! Left! Right! Yeah! Yeah! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Good night. Hey, Rocky! Hey, Rocky! Rocky, you gotta put him down this time! Come on, come on! I'm up! Rocky! Rocky! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Bill Baldwin speaking to you from the magnificent Spectrum here in Philadelphia, the site of Superfight II, with Rocky Balboa, the challenger, and of course Apollo Creed, the world champion. My sidekick and partner again tonight, Stu Nahan. Thank you, Bill, and for those of you who are watching tonight's telecast, we think you're gonna see a real great battle in every sense of the word. Don't worry about nothing. It's okay. I gotta go. Adrian, I wish the doctor would let you go to this fight. Me, too. You're the man. You're number one. The champ. The best of all time. The girls love you. Men, old people love you. Young people love you. You're the best. You're the man. And he's yours. He's yours. He's yours. This bum shouldn't even be in the same ring with you. I want you to show him who you are tonight. Show him who you are tonight. Stick him. Go, Rocky, go! Now, listen, Paulie, you're gonna help out with the baby tonight, right? I'll take care of everything. Okay, you just take care of everything now because you're in charge. I'll take care of the dumb house. You're gonna be late for your own fight. Everything's gonna be fine. Well, maybe I'd better go fight now. I love you. I love you, too. Punch his lungs out. Adrian, I wish you could go. The doctor said no. I got the doctor's instructions. Take care. Good luck. The champion has let it be known to the press and radio that he is in the best shape of his illustrious career. And Rocky Balboa, I know, is a 5-to-1 underdog. I know he's still a street brawler from Philadelphia. But can he repeat that incredible performance of 10 months ago? And, you know, he took a real beating at the hands of the champion. Carmine! Hey, yo, Father Carmine! Father Carmine! Hey, Father Carmine, are you home? Father Carmine! Hey, yo, Father Carmine! It's me, Rocky Balboa. Rocky? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm going to the fight right now, but I was wondering if you could do me a small favor, you know. Well, it's about the fight, you know? Now I got the family and the baby and all that stuff. And I was wondering, you know, if you could throw down a blessing, so that if I get beat up tonight, you know, it won't be too bad, you know? Could you do something like that? Thanks a lot, Father. Listen, I appreciate it. I gotta go. I'm so late. I'll see you in church, I hope. Take care. Hey, Rock. Good luck, son. Yo, Mick! Run, or I'll break your head! Where you been? You lost your brain or something? We got a fight, remember that? I'm sorry. I'm here. Get dressed, will you? There's a million people... Stu, there are many rumors circulating about this fight. Well, the most obvious being a definite desire for Apollo to draw first blood, to end it quickly. This would prove his claim that the last fight was a fluke. Come on, lightning hands! Hurricane! Hurricane! Get him. Get him. I'm gonna get him. Gonna get him. Gonna get him. He's ours! He's ours! Gonna get him. He's ours! He's ours! It's time, kid. Okay, let's do it. All right, I'm ready. You know, I think I'm starting to get a headache here. No, you are in perfect working condition. You are perfect. Yeah, you look good, too. Yeah, thanks. And you look perfect. Perfect. Hey, Mick. Hey, Mick. Yeah. Yeah. In case I don't get a chance, I just want to say I'm gonna be trying hard for you today, okay? Thank you. Ain't this robe nice? It's better than last year, that's for sure. Remember that baggy one last year? This is gorgeous. It's perfect. Yeah, it's real cute. I like it. Yeah. Okay. Yes, Rocky Balboa heading toward the ring now. Yes, sir. Rocky Balboa, known to millions as the Italian Stallion, making his way to the ring. Why this fighter of limited ability has gained such popularity is such a mystery. Rocky Balboa, and the folks here at the Spectrum are beginning to chant his name. He has an awful lot of backers here. Balboa is wearing a black and gold robe. He wore a red one the last time from that meat-packing plant. Some said that was from the high school that he never graduated from. 31 years of age. There he is over shaking hands with the referee, Lou Filippo. And we're waiting now for the champion to come into the ring. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! This area is certainly packed with Rocky's people. I've never seen so many Italians in one place in my life! Hey, hey. You said that. I didn't say that. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! These people are for you, Rock! I appreciate it. Are you ready in here? I think so. Yeah, well, tonight's our night, kid. By the sound of the crowd, the champion is just now coming into the Spectrum. And the champion, Apollo Creed. And he looks a little more determined this time than he did the last time. It's Apollo. Who'd you expect? I was hoping he wouldn't show. The champ of all time! Now the champion is climbing into the ring. Very determined-looking. Very serious right now. Rocky doesn't look as confident as he might. Apollo Creed, the master of disaster, the best of all time! You're going down, man. You're going down. Don't let it bother you, kid. Would it bother you? Yeah. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Philadelphia Spectrum! This is your main event of the evening, 15 rounds for the heavyweight championship of the world! In the black corner, the challenger, weighing 202 pounds, from the great fighting city of Philadelphia, the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa! And in the red corner, weighing 220 pounds, a champion who needs no introduction anywhere in the civilized world, the true master of disaster, the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, the one, the only, Apollo Creed! Referee Lou Filippo will give the instructions. Okay, boys, I'm gonna give you the instructions now, and I expect you to follow them. Watch your low punches and watch your kidney punches. Watch your rabbit punches. In case of a knockdown, you go to the corner I tell you to and stay there until I tell you to come out, understand? Okay, boys. Let's have a good fight. You're going down. You can do it, Rocky! Good luck to you. He's still upset. Who cares? Now, listen, protect that eye. And no matter what happens, don't go back to fighting southpaw till I tell you. Now, you get him. Okay. Good luck. Now he's gonna try to kill you quick. If you get through this first round, then he's ours. Okay. Show him who you are. As Rocky Balboa prays in his corner, the champion dancing over in his corner, we're just seconds away from the fight of the century, Superfight II. And there's the bell. And the champion comes over in a hurry now, and throws a couple of rights and lefts out there. He starts to take command early here. And now, he kind of moves his feet along the side of the ring now. Rocky's holding that right hand. He's fighting right-handed! I don't believe it. The southpaw from Philly is fighting right-handed! Rocky! Rocky! Break that damn jab! Protect that eye! Is that all you got? Is that all you got? Break it up there. You ain't got nothing. Break it up. You ready to lay down? A good right hand followed by another right and another right thrown by the champion. Three good right hands bang at Balboa. They're in the corner, and there's left to right. Here comes Balboa coming back at him. A left and a right to the head, and now back off of the ropes. Balboa appears to be getting hit often, but he seems to be in pretty good condition. A hard right hand thrown by the champion. Another right. Balboa is in trouble now. He's in trouble. Taking rights and lefts as the champion begins to open up. It was a tremendous right hand. Balboa is down! Down goes Balboa! Get back. We see Apollo hit that bad left eye, remember, from the first fight. That's the eye that was cut the last time. Balboa getting up rather unsteadily. Go get him! Go after him, kid! Go after him! Yeah. And the champion starts to move in again. Going right, left. He's taking those punches pretty well. And now Balboa just comes right back! Tossed the ref right into the ring post. Coming out now, he wants at him. Balboa's tagged. Left, left, and right combinations by the champion. Another left. He's leaning back, but there's the bell! There's the end of the round. There's a lot of bad blood between these two. Good round. Good round. I can't believe it. What? He broke my nose again. Balboa has gotta be in great shape to withstand that butchery. Man, I'll tell you, that's just what it is. It's plain old butchery. Did the switching bother you? Nothing bothered me. All right, but then you should have had him. You can't be hurt. You follow? You can't be hurt, 'cause you are too tough. Now don't let up on this man. This man is dangerous. This man is dangerous? I'm dangerous. The man is dangerous. That guy is great. No. Listen, he's only a man. You can beat him because you're a tank. You're a greasy, fast, 200-pound Italian tank. Go through him! Run over him! I'm a tank. I'm gonna get him. This is it, man! The best of all time! Here we go. Round two. Round two. The champion comes back out. He's leaning across again. Starting with a left and a left and a left. Left to the chin, left to the head. Left to the chin, left to the head. Coming around now. Just holding that right hand. He's got it cocked. He's just waiting for that precise moment that he wants to... There it is! He unloaded that, but here comes Balboa! You can't hurt me. He can't hurt me! No way! Break it up. Break it up. Break it up. Break clean. Come on, come on. You're too slow! Man, you're too slow! Get your cameras ready. Watch this now. Watch this. He's going down. Here it comes! Down he goes! Rocky! Get up, Rock! Get up! Balboa for the second time is down, struggling to get up. Don't get up. Just stay down there. Just stay down there, chump! I told you! Beautiful! Six, seven, eight... Protect that eye, kid! Get at it! The body, the body, the body! You're a tank, kid! Let's go, Rock. Yeah. I told you! I told you! And here comes the champion... One, two, now. One, two. Here it is. A left and a right and he's got him back in the corner! Balboa's back in the corner! But here comes Balboa again! Where does he get that stamina? He's got the champion trapped in the corner. And he's breaking left and right, left... Rocky! Rocky! Keep it up! Keep it up! I'm standing here. A great second round. And they're taunting each other. The bell, the round is over, but they're taunting each other. Everybody in the audience better get ready for World War III. I ain't going down no more. Attaboy! Go get him! Come on, kid! Come on, break it up! And the champion again with a combination of lefts and rights to the head. That was another round for Creed. Creed keeps piling up the points, but... Get him, Rock. Hit him! Just hit him! Another round for Apollo Creed. Here comes Balboa again into the corner. Lefts and rights to the midsection, and those hurt. Pound the body! He's won another round. He now begins to taunt Balboa again. Come on! I'm gonna give that round to Balboa. You wonder what's on Apollo Creed's mind right now. He's lost his first round. Go for it, Rock! Balboa is on his way. Hands up! Hands up! Now, just stick and move! This man is breaking you up inside! Now, stick and move! Keep your hands up! Lightning! Thunder! Hit him back! I thought he took a beating 10 months ago, Stu, but tonight it's twice as bad! Another round for the champion, Apollo Creed. The left eye is closed. Now bust him, understand? Keep working on him. Stay away from him. Don't let him breathe! Get him! Balboa's taking another beating in the corner. Another round for the champion. Now come on! You got him beat on points. You understand? Now, stick and move! Don't go for the knockout! He's gonna fall. He's gonna fall. Don't go for the knockout, you understand! Now he's breaking you up inside! How's that eye now? It works. You can't do much more with that, can you? I know what I'm doing. Hey, Rock. You get in trouble one more time, I'm gonna... Please don't stop nothing! Now, listen, let me stop it. Listen, you're getting killed out there, kid! It's my life. Apollo well ahead. All he has to do is stay away and he retains the title. Just stick and move. It ain't gonna be like last time. It ain't gonna be like last time. Now you got three minutes. Switch now to southpaw anyway, will you? No tricks. I ain't switching. Yeah, but you're fading out. I don't need no tricks. All right, all right. I ain't switching. You gotta plan. You gotta switch, kid. He's ready. Believe me. Apollo, don't go for the knockout. You got him burned! They come to the center of the ring for the start of the 15th and final round. You're going down. No. No way. Here we go. Let's see what Creed does here now. Creed has started to move in on Balboa. He's going for the knockout. The champion comes out jabbing with that left hand. He's taking that left hand out. The champion is beating Balboa... Now! Now! Balboa just nearly floored the champ! A leaping hook caught the exhausted champ off guard! Creed doesn't know where he is! It's blind instinct! Balboa is staggering from exhaustion. Balboa throws a right to the head of the champion. Another right, and a left to the head. He's got him into the corner. Stay away from him! He's got this thing won if he stays away, but now it is Creed coming back. Creed with a left hand. Go for it! What's keeping these two guys up? A tremendous boxing moment. Now! Here comes Balboa, but the champion's back with another left. Get away from him! A right hand! A right hand! It's Creed! Now it's Balboa! Now it's Creed! Now a tremendous left by... They're standing dead in the center of the ring, toe to toe. I don't know why the champion is fighting Balboa's fight. Go, Rocky! Go for it! A tremendous left to the head. A left. A left. One! Two! Creed will retain the title! If neither gets up, it's a draw, and Creed will win the title automatically! Four! Get up, man! Get on your feet! Five! Balboa reaches for another! Get up, Rock! Get up! Six! He's trying and trying to beat the count! Now the champ is trying to get up! Seven! Get up, Rocky! Eight! Get up! Nine! The champ is trying... And he's down! Ten! Out! He made it! Rocky Balboa has shocked the world! He is the new heavyweight champion of the world! Ladies and gentlemen, in a stunning upset, scoring a win by knockout, the new heavyweight champion of the world... Yo, Creed. Rocky Balboa! Good luck. Excuse me. Excuse me. I can't believe this has happened. I can't... And I just want to say thanks to Apollo, for fighting me, Apollo. I want to thank Mickey for training me. We love you, Rock! Yeah, and I love youse, too. Most of all I want to thank God. Except for my kid being born, this is the greatest night in the history of my life. I just want to say one thing to my wife who's home. Yo, Adrian! I did it! I love you. I love you. Rocky! Rocky!,         The food is terrible. Worst shit I've ever seen, man.  What you say? You got any biscuits over there?  I keep seeing corn bread. - I am cold. - Still with us, Brett? - Right. - Oh, I feel dead. Anybody ever tell you you look dead, man?   Oh, yeah, right. Now, I just forgot something, man. Before we dock, I think we oughta discuss the bonus situation. Right. Brett and I, we think we oughta- - We deserve full shares, right, baby? - You see, Mr. Parker and I... feel that the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level. Well, you'll get what you're contracted for like everybody else. Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.  Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you. Huh? Yeah, I saw it. Yellow light's for my eyes only. Okay, get dressed, huh? Parker, come on. Can I finish my coffee? Thank you. It's the only thing good on this ship.       Morning, Mother.   - Right. - Okay. Plug us in. Thank you. - Where's Earth? - You should know. It's not our system. Scan.  I can't believe this. Contact Traffic Control.  This is commercial towing vehicle Nostromo out of the Solomons. Registration number: 1-8-0-niner-2-4-6-0-niner. Calling Antarctica Traffic Control. Can you read me? Over. Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo out of the Solomons, registration number- Nothing.  Keep trying. Calling Antarctica Traffic Control. Do you read me, Antarctica? Over. I found it. Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't reached the outer rim yet. That's hard to believe.  What the hell are we doing out here? I don't know. What the hell are you talking about? - That's not our system. - I know that.   Do you ever notice how they never come down here? I mean, this is where the work is, right? Well, it's the same damn reason we get a half share to their one. Our time is their time. That's the way they see it. No, but- Listen, man. Same old shit, man. I think I know why they don't come down here. It's because of you. You don't have no personality. Wonder what they want now. What's going on down here? Um, you happen to be in my seat. Can I have it? Yes, of course. Thank you. I'm sorry.   What's happenin' now, baby? Well, some of you may have figured out we're not home yet. - We're only halfway there. - What? Mother's interrupted the course of our journey. Why? Yeah. She's programmed to do that should certain conditions arise. They have.  Like what? It seems she has... intercepted a transmission of unknown origin. She got us up to check it out. A transmission? Out here? Yeah. What kind of a transmission? Acoustical beacon. It repeats at intervals of 12 seconds. S.O.S.? I don't know. Human? Unknown.  Well, so what?  We are obligated under section eight- I hate to bring this up, but, uh, this is a commercial ship, not a rescue ship. Right. And it's not in my contract to do this kind of duty. And what about the money? If you wanna give me some money, I'll be happy to oblige. The man's right. Let's go over the bonus situation. - I'm sorry. Can I say something? - Let's talk about the bonus more. There is a clause in the contract which specifically states... any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin... must be investigated. I don't wanna hear it. We don't know if it's intelligent. I wanna go home and party. Parker, will you just listen to the man? On penalty of total forfeiture of shares. No money. You got that? -  Well, yeah. - All right, we're going in. Yeah. We're goin' in, aren't we?  Can we all hear that, Lambert?     Good God. Doesn't sound like any radio signal I've heard. Maybe it's a voice. Well, we'll soon know. Can you hone in on that? What was the, uh, position?    All right. It found the quadrant. Ascension: six minutes, 20 seconds. Declination: 39 degrees, two seconds. Okay. Put that on the screen for me.  All right. Well, that's it. It's a planetoid. 1200 kilometers. It's tiny. Any rotation?   About two hours. What about gravity? Point eight-six. You can walk on it.  Approaching orbital apogee. Mark 12, 11- Equatorial orbit nailed.  Nine, eight seconds on descent.  Grids energized. Fields focused. Five. Four-  - D.O.R.'s on line. - How's the status on the lifters? Give me an A.C. pressure reading. Forty-eight seconds and counting.  SR-1stable. Prepare to disengage from platform.  Mark, 20 seconds. Eighteen, 17- Twelve, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, lock. Disengage.  Umbilicus clear. Money's safe. Let's take her down.  Nine, eight, seven-  Roll 92 degrees port yaw.  Prime to port.  Prime ventral. Prime dorsal.  Down a degree.  39,000 meters.   Turbulence.  Locked and floating. You can drop us anytime now. We'll catch you. Inertial damping's going off. Hold on, people. There's gonna be a little bump.  What the hell was that? Pressure drop in intake three. Must've lost a shield. Let's go with it.   Dropping off now. Still dropping. Here we are. We've got it. Take her down. Navigation lights on.  We've got 5-3 still out. No problem. Just down 11%. Grid status okay.  Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Kill drive engines.  What the hell happened?  Somebody give me a straight answer! - Is the hull breached? - I don't see anything. We've still got pressure. - Hit the screen. - Right.   Secondary load sharing unit... is out. Three to four cells are gone. Is that it? No, hold on. We can't fix it out here anyway, and we need to reroute... a couple of these ducts, wouldn't you say, Brett? Dry dock time. Dry dock. Tell her we need to dry-dock. Look, we couldn't fix it out here anyway. We gotta reroute all these ducts, and in order to do that we've got to dry-dock.  What else?  Some fragments kicked up, and we've got to clean it all out and repressurize it.  How long before we're functional? Look, what is- What- It's 17 hours, tell her. At least 25 hours. Yeah.  Get started on the floor panel. I'll be right down. What the hell's she comin' down here for? She better stay the fuck out of my way, I'll tell you that. I'd like to see what she's gonna do when she gets here.  Any response yet?  No. Absolutely nothing. Except the same transmission every 12 seconds. All the other channels are dead.  Kick on the floods. We can't go anywhere in this. Mmm. Well, Mother says the sun's coming up in 20 minutes. How far are we from the source of transmission? Uh, northeast. Just under 2,000 meters. Walking distance?  Well- Can you give me an atmospheric? Yes.  Oh. It's almost primordial. There's inert nitrogen, high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals, methane. I'm working on the trace elements. Anything else? Yes. It's... rock, lava base, and deep cold. Well below the line. Mm-hmm.  I'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out.  Yeah, that figures. You too, Lambert. Swell.  Better break out the weapons.   I can't see a goddamn thing.  Ash, are you receiving?    Good contact on my board.  Clear and free. Keep the line open. Let's go. Hey, Ripley. Hey, Ripley, I wanna ask you a question. If they find what they're lookin' for out there, does that mean we get full shares? Don't worry, Parker. You'll get whatever's coming to you. Look, I'm not gonna do any more work... till we get this straightened out. Brett, you're guaranteed by law to get a share.  What? - Why don't you just fuck off. - What?  What'd you say, Rip? If you have any trouble, I'll be on the bridge.  Hey, Ripley, come back here!  Son of a bitch. What's the matter?  Can't see a goddamn thing.  Quit griping. I like griping.  Come on. Knock it off.   Ash, can you see this? Yes, I can. I've never seen anything like it.  Very bizarre.  You said it.  All right. Moving on to second... position.  What is it? Let's get out of here.  We've got this far. We must go on. We have to go on. Will you say that again? Shit.  Ash, as you can see, it's kind of hard to describe. I'm going back to the console.   Seems to be solid. To walk- You can on it.   Dallas?  Come on down here. Something different down here. I don't know what it is, but- See if we can get up that wall. If we can get up that wall, we can find out. Amazing.  Alien life-form. Looks like it's been dead a long time. Fossilized. Looks like it's grown out of the chair. Bones are bent outward, like he exploded from inside.  Wonder what happened to the rest of the crew. Let's get the hell out of here. Hey, Dallas, Lambert, come on over here. Come on. What do you got? See what you make of this.  Ash. That transmission- Mother's deciphered part of it. It doesn't look like an S.O.S. What is it, then? Well, I- It looks like a warning. I'm gonna go out after them. What's the point? I mean, by the time it takes to get there, you'll- they'll know if it's a warning or not, yes?    You okay down there? Can you see anything? Uh... a cave. A ca- A cave of some sort. But l- Well, I don't know, but it's like the goddamn tropics in here. What the hell is this? The cave is completely enclosed, and it's full of... leathery objects, like eggs or something.  There's a layer of mist...  just covering the eggs that reacts when broken.  Kane? You all right? I'm okay. All right. I'm okay. I just slipped. Appears to be completely sealed.  Wait a minute. There's movement. It seems to have life. Organic life.     You there, Ripley? I'm right here.  Okay, Ripley, I'm at the inner lock hatch now. Right. Ripley. We're clean. Let us in. Right here. - What happened to Kane? - Something has attached itself to him. - We have to get him to the infirmary right away. - What kind of thing? I need a clear definition. An organism. Open the hatch. Wait a minute. If we let it in, the ship could be infected. You know the quarantine procedure- 24 hours for decontamination. He could die in 24 hours. Open the hatch. Listen to me. If we break quarantine, we could all die. Look, would you open the goddamn hatch? We have to get him inside. No. I can't do that. And if you were in my position, you'd do the same. Ripley, this is an order. Open that hatch right now. Do you hear me? Yes. Ripley, this is an order! Do you hear me? Yes, I read you. The answer is negative. Inner hatch opened.  My God. What the hell is that? Jesus Christ. What is that, man? Hey, how the hell is he breathing? Is he still alive or what? Why don't you guys freeze him? How come they don't freeze him? What's going on in there? What the fuck is going on? You bitch! Jesus Christ! Hey! Hey! You would've left us out there. Break it up.  Ripley, when I give an order, I expect to be obeyed. Even if it's against the law? You're goddamn right! Maybe she has a point. Who the hell knows what that thing is. How are we gonna get that off him? How are we gonna get it off? I'm gonna get some instruments. My God. Right. I'll make an incision here. Try and remove one of the digitals from- You're gonna do what? Finger. I'm gonna try and get his finger off. Just a minute.  No, that's not- It's tearing his scalp. I know! It's not coming off without tearing his face off with it. We'll have to take a look at him inside. Right. How come they don't freeze him?  How come you guys don't freeze him? All right, you can take your mask off. - What's it got down his throat? - I would suggest it's feeding him oxygen. Paralyzes him, puts him in a coma, then keeps him alive. Now what the hell is that? We gotta get it off of him. Just a minute. Just a minute. I mean, let's not be too hasty. We don't know anything about... it. Now, we're assuming it's feeding him oxygen. If we remove it, it could kill him. I'm willing to take that chance. Let's cut it off him now. You'll take responsibility? Yes, I'll take responsibility. Get him out of there.  Where do you wanna do this? We'll make an incision just below the knuckle there. Right here. Stand by.   Good God!  That crap's gonna eat through the hull. That thing's gonna eat through the goddamn hull. Come on! What's going on? This way. Next deck. -  -  There it is. Don't get under it! Don't get under it. Looks like it's stopping. Take a look at this, man. Yeah. Brett, give me- What do you got, a pen there? Give it to me, quick. Come on! Come on!  Don't get any on your arm. It stopped. Don't see anything like that except, uh, molecular acid. It must be using it for blood. It's got a wonderful defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it. What about Kane? - Here's your pen back. -  What do we do now? Leave Kane to Ash. You get back to work. Well, what-  Okay. Try it.  Damn it. I thought sure that was it. Try it again.  I feel like I've been in this place a month. We shouldn't have landed in this place in the first place. Shouldn't have landed on this damn ball, I know that. Well, the sooner we patch this thing up and get out of here, the sooner we can go home. This place gives me the creeps.  That's amazing. What is it? Ah, yes, it is. Um- I don't know yet.  Did you want something? Yes. I, uh- I'd like to have a little talk. How's, uh- How's Kane? He's holding. No changes. And, uh, our guest? Well- Hmm? Well, as I said, I'm still... collating, actually, but, uh, I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides. He has a funny habit of shedding his cells... and replacing them with... polarized silicon, which gives him a prolonged resistance... to adverse environmental conditions. Is that enough for you? That's plenty. What does it mean? Please don't do that. Thank you. I'm sorry. Well, it's an interesting combination of elements, making him a tough little son of a bitch. And you let him in. I was obeying a direct order, remember? Ash, when Dallas and Kane are off the ship, I'm senior officer. Oh, yes. I forgot. You also forgot the science division's basic quarantine law. No, that I didn't forget. Oh, I see. You just broke it. Huh? Look, what would you have done with Kane? Hmm? You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here. Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine, you risk everybody's life. Maybe I should've left him outside. Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us, but it was a risk I was willing to take. That's a pretty big risk... for a science officer. It's, uh, not exactly out of the manual, is it? I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you, you know. You do your job... and let me do mine, yes?     Where's Dallas?  In the shuttle.     Dallas.  I think you should have a look at Kane. Why? Something's happened. Serious? lnteresting.    Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.  Where is it?  Well, I don't know. I mean, we ought to try and find it.  Yeah, let's check it.  Dallas, please be careful.   Sorry. No, not in the corner. Psst. Have one of these. Just in case. Kane? Dallas?  You okay? I didn't see it. Was it in the overhead? What? It was up there somewhere. My God.  Cover up the damn thing!  Wait. That's alive! That's a reflex action. Well, we've gotta have a look at this. Excuse me.  Seems dead enough.  Well, good. Let's get rid of it. Ripley, for God's sake, this is the first time that we've encountered a species like this. It has to go back. All sorts of tests have to be made. Ash, are you kidding? This thing bled acid. Who knows what it's gonna do when it's dead. Think it's safe to assume it isn't a zombie. Dallas, it has to go back. Well, I'd soon... as not burn it at the stake, but you're the science officer. It's your decision, Ash. Dallas. How come I've got to change my mind? The decision's been made. I'm not trying to change your mind, Dallas. I just want you to listen- Will you listen to-  Just tell me how you can leave that kind of decision to him. Look, I just run the ship. Anything that has to do with the science division, Ash has the final word. -How does that happen? -It happens, my dear, because that's what the company wants to happen. Since when is that standard procedure? Standard procedure is to do what the hell they tell you to do. What's happening with the repairs? How's it going? They're pretty much finished now. Why the hell didn't you tell me so? - Because there's still some things left to do. - Like what? Well, we're blind on ""B"" and ""C"" decks. The reserve power system's blown- That's a bunch of horseshit. We can take off without that. Yeah, we can. You think that's a good idea? Look, I just wanna get the hell out of here, all right?  Dust in the intakes again. Number two's overheating. Spit on it for two minutes, would you, for Christ's sake?  We're hot. We're getting hotter. Engine room, red clip status? One kilometer on ascension.  Engage artificial gravity. Engaged. I'm altering the vector now.  Inhibit C.N.G. control. Struts retract.  Struts retracted.  Max stress to fifth overload.  Ease it back.  She's great. Beautiful. Walk in the park. When we fix something, we stay fixed. Don't we, Brett baby?  Right.  What I think we should do is just freeze him. If he's got a disease, why don't we stop it where it is? - He can always get to a doctor when we get back home. - Right. Whenever he says anything, you say ""right,"" Brett. You know that? Right.  Parker, what do you think? Your staffjust follows you around, says ""right."" - Just like a regular parrot. - Yeah. Shape up. - What are you, some kind of parrot? - Right. Come on. Knock it off! Kane's gonna have to go into quarantine. That's it. Yes, and so will we. Well, how about a little something to lower your spirits? Thrill me, will you, please? Well, according to my calculations, based on time spent getting to and from the planet- Just give me the short version. How far to Earth? Ten months. Oh, God. Great.  Yes.  Dallas, I think you should come and see Kane. Has his condition changed? It's simpler if you'd just come and see him.  We're on our way. Right.   How are you doing?  Thank you. How you doin'? Um, terrific. Next silly question.  Oh, thank you. Do you remember anything about the planet? What's the last thing you do remember? Huh?  I remember some... horrible dream about... smothering. And- And- Anyway, where are we? Right here. We're on our way home. Back to the old freezerinos. Could I have something to eat before we go back? I-I need something myself. Yeah, right. One more meal before bedtime. I'm buyin'. Hey, that's a break. Bedtime.   The first thing that I'm gonna do when I get back... is to get some decent food. I can dig it, man. Let me tell you, I've eaten worse food than this, but then I've tasted better, you know what I'm sayin'? The other one over there. Well, you pound down the stuff like there's no tomorrow. I'd rather be eatin' something else, but, uh, right now I'm thinkin' food.  Well, you should know. You know what it's made of. No, man, I don't wanna talk about what it's made of. I'm eatin' this just to-  What's the matter? The food ain't that bad, baby. What's wrong, Kane?  Are you choking? What's wrong?  What? What? - This is serious. - Kane, what's the matter?  It's okay! Hold him down! Hold him-  Get the spoon in!  Damn it! Get it into his mouth! I'm trying!    -  -   Oh, my God! Oh, God! No! Don't touch it! Don't touch it!   Dallas? Dallas? Yeah. Anything? No. You? Nothing. You see anything? No.   Inner hatch sealed. Anybody wanna say anything? This is just an ordinary prod, like a cattle prod. It's got a portable battery. It's insulated all the way here, all the way up to here. Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it. It shouldn't damage the little bastard, unless its skin's thinner than ours. But it will give him a little incentive. Now we just have to find it. I've taken care of that. I've designed this tracking device. You just set it to search for a moving object, like so. Hasn't got much of a range, but when you get within a certain distance, it'll start to give off a signal. What's it key on? Micro changes in air density. Give me a demo.  See? Again. Got ya. Two teams. Ash, Lambert and l. Ripley, you take Parker and Brett. Now, anyone see this thing, you catch it in the net... that Parker's holding on his lap. Parker, I don't want any heroics out of you, all right? Catch it, put it in the air lock, get rid of it. Now, channels are open on all decks. I want you to communicate, keep in touch at all times, all right? Let's go. I thought you fixed 12 module.  We did. I don't understand it.  The circuits must have burned out. What do we got here? Damn it! Hold your light over here, would you? Yeah, that's it. I don't know if this is gonna work. If I could just put this- put this in there. Right. Oh, damn it. Check the insulation. Oh, shit!  Steady. According to this, it's within five meters.   Micro changes in air density, my ass.  It's within five meters.  Be careful.   Christ.  Don't do that. Don't creep up on me with that thing.  You guys, stick together.  Don't fail me now.  What? What is it? Parker, Brett, it's in this locker! Where?  Here, take this. Get over there and get the net. Get it? I got it. I got it. I got it. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right, Parker. When I say. All right. Now. Easy.  -  - Wait! Don't let him go! What the hell are you doing, man? It's the cat.  Hey, look, now. We had to bag it, man. Now we might pick it up on the tracker again. I'll- I'll- I'll- Go and get it, man. All right. You get him. We'll go on.   Here, kitty! Here, kitty, kitty! Enough of that kitty crap. Jones. Jonesy? Here, Jonesy.   Jonesy? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.  Here, Jonesy. Jonesy?  Here, kitty, kitty.     Kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, Jonesy. Jonesy. Kitty, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Jonesy? Hey. Hey. Come on, Jonesy. Come on, baby. That's a kitty. That's a kitty. Come on, baby. - That's a kitty. -  Hey, hey. I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.   Brett!  Brett! Brett! Whatever it was, it was- it was big and- You're sure it took him into the air shaft? Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts. No question, it's- it's using the air ducts to move around. Could he want Brett alive? What? Could Brett be alive? No. I mean, I don't think so. Well, this air shaft may work to our advantage. Here it leads up to and comes out in the main air lock. All right. There's only one big opening along the way. We can cover that up, and then we... drive it into the air lock and zap it into outer space. This son of a bitch is huge! - I mean, it's like a man. It's big! - Kane's son. Come on, Ash. Science department should be able to help us. What can we do to drive it? Yes, well, it's adapted remarkably well to our atmosphere, considering its nutritional requirements. - The only thing we don't know about is temperature. - Okay. What about temperature? - What happens if we change it? - Let's try it. I mean, most animals retreat from fire. Yes? Fire, yeah. Parker, can you rig... three or four incinerator units? Give me about 20 minutes. I'll do it. - Who gets to go into the vent? - I do. No. You and Ash... take the main air lock. Parker, Lambert, you cover up that maintenance opening, please.  Right.  -  I'm at the first junction. - Dallas, I'm right here. - Parker? - Yeah? - Lambert? We're in position. I'm just trying to get a reading here. - The air lock is open. - Okay, Ripley. Ready. All right. I've got a reading on you now.  Uh, open the hatch to the third junction.    Okay, I'm through. Ripley? Yes. Close all the hatches behind me. I'm moving on.  Dallas, hold it a minute. I think I got it. Yes, I've got it.  Where?  It's somewhere around the third junction. Okay, moving on. It is right around there. Now, Dallas, you're gonna have to be careful. All right. I've reached... the third junction, and I'm going down.   The hell's the matter with that box? Dallas, you're gonna have to hold your position for a minute. I- I've lost the signal. What? You sure? Look around. Are you sure it's not there? It's got to be around there somewhere.  Checked it out, Lambert. You may be getting interserence.  Dallas, are you sure there's no sign of it? I mean, it is there. It's gotta be around there. - Dallas? - God, what is happening? All right. Uh, am I- am I clear, Lambert? I want to get the hell out of here.   Oh, God. It's moving right towards you. Um- Move! Get out of there! Behind you! Move! Dallas! Move, Dallas! Move, Dallas! Get out!  Move! The other way!   Dallas? Oh, no. Take it easy.  Dallas? We found this laying there. No blood. No Dallas. Nothing. How come I don't hear nobody saying nothing? I'm thinking. Unless somebody has got a better idea, we'll proceed with Dallas's plan. What? And end up like the others? Ohh. No, you're out of your mind. - Got a better idea? - Yes. I say that we abandon this ship. We get the shuttle and just get the hell out of here. We take our chances and just hope that... somebody picks us up. Lambert. The shuttle won't take four. Then why don't we draw straws and- I'm not drawin' any straws. I'm for killing that goddamn thing right now.  Okay. Well, let's talk about killing it.  We know it's using the air shafts- Will you listen to me, Parker? Shut up! Let's hear it. Let's hear it. It's using the air shafts. We don't know that. That's the only way. We'll move in pairs. We'll go step by step... and cut off every bulkhead and every vent... until we have it cornered, and then we'll blow it the fuck out into space. Is that acceptable to you? If it means killing it, it's acceptable to me. Obviously it means killing it. But we have to stick together. How are our weapons? The weapons are fine. This one needs refueling. Will you get it, please? Ash, go with him. No, no. I can manage, Ash. Don't follow me. Ash? Any suggestions from you or Mother? No, we're still collating.  You're what? You're still collating? I find that hard to believe. What would you like me to do? Just what you've been doing, Ash. Nothing. I've got access to Mother now, and I'll get my own answers, thank you. All right.    There is an explanation for this, you know. Is there really? I don't wanna hear your goddamn explanation!  I want- I want-  I want- I w- Parker. Lambert? Ash, open the door. Ash- Will you open the door? Let me by, Ash.    Yaah!   The hell are you doing?  Aah! Get her up. Get her up. Get her up. Get her up. Get her up. Get her up.  Android! He's an android!  Jesus!  It's a robot. Ash is a goddamn robot! God!  Oh! Get off me- Oh! Holy shit! Help! Help me get this fucking thing off!  Aah! God! Jesus! Oh, God! Oh, God!  How come the company sent us a goddamn robot?  All I can think of is they must've wanted the alien for their weapons division. He's been protecting it right along. Parker, will you plug it in?  I don't know why- Because he may know how to kill it.  Ash, can you hear me? Ash?  Yes, I can hear you. - What was your special order? - You read it. I thought it was clear. - What was it? - Bring back life-form. Priority one. All other priorities rescinded. The damn company! What about our lives, you son of a bitch? I repeat: All other priorities are rescinded.  How do we kill it, Ash? There's got to be a way of killing it. How- How do we do it? You can't. -That's bullshit! -You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? A persect organism. Its structural persection is matched only by its hostility. You admire it. I admire its purity. A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.  Look, I- I've heard enough of this, and I'm asking you to pull the plug.  Last word. What? I can't lie to you about your chances, but... you have my sympathies. We're gonna blow up the ship. We'll take our chances in the shuttle. Blow up the ship. Good. Come on. When we throw the switches, how long before the ship blows? Ten minutes. No bullshit. If we ain't outta here in ten minutes, we won't need no rocket to fly through space. We're gonna need coolant for the air support system. You two go down, get all the coolant you can carry. I'll get the shuttle ready. I'll give you about- about seven minutes. Come back up here. I'll shut the switches off, and we'll blow this fucker off into space. Okay. All right. Come on. Ready? Take care of yourself. Seven minutes.   Take it easy.  Jones.  Jones? Okay, check the bottles. Jones? How you doin'? Fine. Kitty.   Okay. Go ahead. Jones? Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here, Jones. Come here. Jones? Come here, boy. Come here. Nice kitty. Jones?  Jones? Come here. Come here, sweetheart. Jones. Jones? Jones? Jones? -  -  Jones! Goddamn it! Now I got you. Here, sweetie. Nice kitty. -  - Oh, my God.  Get out of the way.  I can't get out of the way! Get out of the way, Lambert! It's gonna kill us! I can't! Lambert, for Christ's sake, get out of the way! Parker? Lambert- Get out of the way, Lambert! Parker? Lambert? Lambert? Parker?  Get outta the room!    Oh, God!    Parker?      Danger. The emergency destruct system...  is now activated. The ship will detonate in T-minus... ten minutes. The option to override automatic detonation... expires in T-minus five minutes.   The option to override automatic detonation... expires in T-minus-   Oh- Dallas.  Brett.  Oh.  Kill me.  Kill me!       The option to override automatic detonation... expires in T-minus... three minutes.  The option to override... automatic detonation expires... in T-minus one minute.  Twenty-nine, 28, 27, 21, 20 seconds. Nineteen, 18, 12, 11, 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven,  six, five, four, Come on! three, two, one. The option to override detonation procedure... has now expired. Mother? I've turned the cooling unit back on. Mother!  The ship will automatically destruct... in T-minus five minutes. You bitch!  You bitch! Goddamn it! Jonesy.  You now have one minute to abandon ship. The ship will automatically destruct... in T-minus one minute. T-minus 30 seconds. Twenty-nine, 28,  20 seconds. Nineteen, 18, 12, 11, 10 seconds.  Nine, eight, seven, six, five, - four, three, two, one. -  I got you, you son of a bitch.  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's all right. Shh, shh, shh.  Shh, shh, shh. It's all right.  All right. It's nice to see you too. Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay.    Come on. Come on.  You are   My lucky star   You... are my   Lucky star   You  Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky. Okay.  Well, come on.  You are   My lucky star   You  -  -  You are my lucky star   You are my lucky star   You are my lucky    Oh, my God.  My- My lucky-   You... are my    You are my    Lucky      Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo. Third officer reporting. The other members of the crew- Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash and Captain Dallas- are dead. Cargo and ship destroyed. I should reach the frontier in about six weeks. With a little luck, the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off. Come on, cat. English - US - PSDH, Tactical! Visual! Prepare torpedos! Attention! Fire! Evade This is com station Epsilon 9 calling USS Columbia. Come in, Columbia. Respond, please. This is Scout Columbia, Epsilon 9. Could you boost your transmission? This is Epsilon 9, Columbia. Am boosting output. How read you this? Fine, fine. Thank you, Epsilon 9. Receiving your transmission. Scout Columbia, NCC-621... to rendezvous with Scout Revere, NCC-595... on stardate 7411.4. Further orders will be relayed at that time. Signed Commodore Prober to Starfleet. - End of transmission. - Received. Thank you. Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L-1 4. That's within Klingon boundaries. Who are they fighting? Unknown, Sir. I have an exterior visual. Attention! Fire! We've plotted a course on that cloud, Commander. It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us. Heading? Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth. Commander Sonak. You received your appointment as Enterprise science officer? Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you. Then why aren't you aboard? Captain Decker requested I complete final science briefing here before... - Here? - we leave on our mission. At Starfleet? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock. Which will require 20 more hours at minimum... Twelve. I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura... which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour. Report to you, Sir? It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting. Report to me in one hour. - Admiral! - Mr. Scott. Those departure orders... 12 hours. Starfleet cannot be serious. Why aren't the Enterprise transporters operating, Mr. Scott? A wee problem, Sir. Just temporary. Admiral, we have just finished 18 months... redesigning and refitting the Enterprise. How in hell do they expect me to have her ready in 12 hours? Take me over, please. She needs more work, Sir. A shakedown! Mr. Scott, an alien object of unbelievable destructive power... is less than three days away from this planet. The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise. Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours. The crew haven't had near enough transition time... with all the new equipment. And the engines... They're not even tested at warp power. And an untried Captain. Two-and-a-half years as chief of Starfleet Operations... may have made me a little stale, but I... wouldn't exactly consider myself untried. - They gave her back to me, Scotty. - Gave her back, Sir? I doubt it was that easy with Nogura. You're right. Well, any man who could manage such a feat... I would not dare disappoint. She'll launch on time, Sir, and she'll be ready. - Thank you, Mr. Scott. - Aye, Sir. Cargo bay to launch crew. A travel pod is now available at dock 6. - Permission to come aboard, Sir. - Granted, Sir. Welcome aboard, Admiral. Commander Scott, you're needed in Engineering immediately. Sir, you'll excuse me. Flight deck, prepare for an incoming shuttlecraft. If you'll follow me, I'll show you... I think I can find my way, Ensign. Aye, Sir. Bridge. What's the problem? I thought you people had that circuit patched in an hour ago. We did. We had to disconnect it. All right. Take out... It's going to take us longer that way. We're trying to save time. I'm still waiting for a check on the line. What's holding it up? As soon as somebody can get to it. What's the next program? I'll get somebody down there as soon as I can, Cleary. My people are all tied up now. Captain! Starfleet just signaled your transfer of command orders. - Captain. - I appreciate the welcome. I wish the circumstances were less critical. Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder. Keep a channel open to them. Aye, Sir. - Where's Captain Decker? - He's in Engineering, Sir. He... He doesn't know. - Mr. Chekov. - Aye, Sir. Assemble the crew on the recreation deck at 0400 hours. I want to show them what we're facing. Check Cleary on number six. - Need your cooler status. - Stand by. Space matrix restoration coils. Dilithium crystals. I knew it. The transporter sensor was not activated. Air equalization. Automatic off. Faulty module. Cleary, put a new backup sensor into the unit. Aye, Sir. Admiral Kirk! Well, we're getting a top brass send-off. Don't worry, she'll launch on schedule... if we have to tow her out with our bare hands, right, Scotty? Aye. That we will, Sir. - Let's talk. - Sure. Let me know when that backup's ready. All due respect, I hope this isn't some kind of Starfleet pep talk. - I'm really too busy. - I'm taking over the center seat. You're what? I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise. You'll stay on as executive officer. Temporary grade reduction to Commander. You personally are assuming command? Yeah. - May I ask why? - My experience. Five years out there dealing with unknowns like this. My familiarity with the Enterprise and its crew. Admiral, this is an almost totally new Enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do. That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will. No, Admiral, I don't think you're sorry. Not one damn bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were and how much you hoped... you'd find a way to get a starship command again. Well, Sir, it looks like you found a way. Report to the bridge, Commander, immediately. Aye, Sir. Transporter room! Come in! Urgent! Redline on the transporter, Mr. Scott! Transporter, do not engage! -It's too late. They're beaming now. - Do not... Do you read me, Starfleet? Override it! Pull them back! Unable to retrieve their pattern, Enterprise. Give it to me. Starfleet, boost your matter gain. We need more signal. More signal! - We're losing their pattern! - Oh, no, they're forming. Oh my God. Starfleet, do you have them? Enterprise, what we got back didn 't live long, fortunately. Starfleet, Kirk. Please express my condolences to their families. Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan embassy. There was nothing you could have done, Rand. It wasn't your fault. Yeoman, turboshaft 8? Back that way, Sir. We have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible. None available, Captain. In fact, there's no one who's fully rated on this design. You are, Mr. Decker. I'm afraid you're going to have to double as science officer. That's all we know about it... except that it is now 53.4 hours away from Earth. Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way. Our orders are to intercept... investigate and take whatever action is necessary... and possible. Bridge to Captain. Priority signal from Epsilon 9. - Put it on viewer. - On viewer, Sir. Enterprise, the cloud is definitely a power field of some kind. Measures... My God... over eight two AU's in diameter. Must be something incredible inside there generating it. We're transmitting lingua code friendship messages... on all frequencies. No response. have a null reading at the center of the cloud. Definitely something inside there, but scans are being reflected back. - Some kind of power surge. - Receiving an odd pattern now. Enterprise, they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act. They seem to be reactingto our scans, Sir. Deflectors, emergency full! - We are under attack. - External view. Viewer off. Viewer off. Prelaunch countdown will commence in 40 minutes. Transporter system fully repaired and functioning normally, Sir. Dock signals clear, Captain. Reply we are holding position, awaiting final crew replacements. Aye, Sir. Transporter personnel reports... the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia... She's already aboard and en route to the bridge, Sir. She's Deltan, Captain. Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, Sir. Welcome aboard, Lieutenant. - Hello, Ilia. - Decker. I was stationed on the lieutenant's home planet some years ago. Commander Decker? Yes, our exec and science officer. Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me. And in you, too, Lieutenant. My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain. - May I assume my duties? - By all means. Starfleet reports our last six crew members are ready to beam up... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter. Oh? I'll see to it that he beams up. Transporter room. Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet... Just a moment, Captain, Sir. I'll explain what happened. Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little-known... seldom-used reserve activation clause. In simpler language, Captain, they drafted me! They didn't. This was your idea. This was your idea, wasn't it? Bones, there's a thing out there. Why is any object we don't understand always called a thing? Headed this way. I need you. Damn it, Bones, I need you. Badly! Permission to come aboard. Permission granted, Sir. Well, Jim, I hear Chapel's an MD now. Well, I'm going to need a top nurse... not a doctor who will argue every little diagnosis with me. And they probably redesigned the whole sick bay too! I know engineers. They love to change things. Dock control reports ready, Sir. - Helm ready, Sir. - Orbital departure on plot, Sir. Yard command signaling clear, Sir. - Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu. - Maneuvering thrusters, Sir. Hold station. Thrusters at station-keeping, Sir. Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu. Take us out. Intermix set, Bridge. Impulse power at your discretion. Impulse power, Mr. Sulu. Ahead warp .5. Departure angle on viewer. Departure angle. - Viewer ahead. - Viewer ahead. Captain 's Log.: Stardate 7412.6... 1.8 hours from launch. In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time... we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system. Captain, assuming we have full warp capability... accelerating to warp 7 on leaving the solar system... will bring us to IP with the intruder in 20.1 hours. Science Officer competition. Confirm, Sir Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval? They do not. It's like working in a damn computer center. - Programming ready? - Set for standard warp entry. But I still recommend further simulation study. Mr. Decker, every minute brings that object closer to Earth. Engineering, stand by for warp drive. Captain, we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors. Engineer, we need warp speed now! Jim, you're pushing. Your people know their jobs. That's it, Sir. I can't do any better. Aye, lad. It's borderline on the simulator. I cannot guarantee she'll hold up. Warp drive, Mr. Scott. - Ahead warp 1 , Mr. Sulu. - Accelerating to warp 1, Sir. Warp .7, .8. Warp 1 , Sir. Mr. Decker... Wormhole. Get us back on impulse power. Full reverse. Negative helm control, Captain. Going reverse on impulse power. Subspace frequencies jammed, Sir! Wormhole effect! Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22.5 seconds... before forward velocity slows to sublight speed. Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us. - Directly ahead. - Force fields up full. Put object on viewer. - Go manual override on helm. - No manual response, Sir. Navigational deflectors coming up, Sir. Wormhole distortion has overloaded the main power systems. Navigational deflectors inoperative, Captain. Directional control also inoperative. Time to impact? Twenty seconds. Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers. No! Belay that phaser order! Arm photon torpedoes! Photon torpedoes... armed! Object is an asteroid. Reading mass .7. Targeting... asteroid! Impact in ten seconds. Impact in eight seconds. - Fire torpedoes! - Six! Torpedoes away! Five! Helm control restored, Sir. - Position report, Navigator. - Computing new intersection course. Communications are normal, Sir. Negative damage reported, Captain. No casualties reported, Doctor. Wrong, Mr. Chekov.There are casualties. My wits, as in ""frightened out of,"" Captain, Sir. We were at warp .8. Engineer, report your status there. In just a second, Exec. We're picking up the pieces down here. Mr. Scott, we need warp drive as soon as possible. The engine imbalance created the wormhole in the first place. It'll happen again if we don't correct it. That object is less than two days away from Earth. We need to intercept while it still is out there. Lay in a heading to conform with our initial IP with the intruder. Mr. Sulu, you have the com. Mr. Decker. -I'd like to see you in my quarters. -Mind if I tag along, Captain? Level 5. All right, explanation. Why was my phaser order countermanded? The Enterprise redesign increases phaser power... by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into antimatter imbalance... the phasers were automatically cut off. Then you acted properly, of course. Thank you, Sir. I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. - You saved the ship. - I'm aware of that, Sir. Stop competing with me, Decker. - Permission to speak freely, Sir? - Granted. Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two-and-a-half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's redesign... in my opinion, Sir, seriously jeopardizes this mission. I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties? Yes, Sir, I'll do that. Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, Commander. - Yes, Doctor? - Aye, Sir. He may be right, Jim. - Was it difficult? - No more than I expected. About as difficult as seeing you again. - I'm sorry. - That you left Delta IV? Or that you didn't even say good-bye? If I had seen you again... would you have been able to say it? No. Make your point, Doctor. The point, Captain, is that it's you who is competing. You rammed getting this command down Starfleet's throat. You've used this emergency to get the Enterprise back. And I intend to keep her, is that what you're saying? Yes. It's an obsession. An obsession that can blind you... to far more immediate and critical responsibilities. Your reaction to Decker is an example, Jim. - Bridge to Captain. - Viewer on. Signal from a Federation registered long-range shuttle, Sir. She wishes to come alongside and lock on. For what purpose? My security scan shows it has a grade-one priority, Captain. Non belligerency confirmed. I suspect it is a courier of some kind. Very well, Mr. Chekov. See to it. Viewer off. Your opinion has been noted. Anything further? That depends on you. Security scan.: one boarder. Identity: Starfleet, inactive. - Permission to come aboard, Sir. - Granted, Sir. Gran... ted. Why... Why, it's Mister... Spock! Spock. Commander, if I may? If... Oh. I've been monitoring your communications with Starfleet. I'm aware of your engine design difficulties. I offer my services as science officer... with all due respect, Commander. - If our exec has no objections. - Of course not. I'm well aware of Mr. Spock's qualifications. Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated. List him as science officer. Both effective immediately. Mr. Spock. Well, so help me, I'm actually pleased to see you. It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock. Captain, with your permission... I will now discuss these fuel equations with the engineer. Mr. Spock. Welcome aboard. Captain 's Log.: Stardate 7413.4. Thanks to Mr. Spock's timely arrival and assistance... we have the engines rebalanced into full warp capacity. Repair time.: less than three hours. Which means we will now be able to intercept intruder... while still more than a day from Earth. Warp .8. Warp 2, Sir. Warp 3. Warp 4. Warp 5. Warp 6. Warp 7. Science Officer Spock, reporting as ordered, Captain. Please, sit down. Spock, you haven't changed a bit. You're just as warm and sociable as ever. Nor have you, Doctor... as your continued predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates. Gentlemen. At last report, you were on Vulcan... apparently to stay. Yes, you were undergoing the ''Kolanear'' discipline. Sit down. If you are referring to the Kolinahr, Doctor, you are correct. Well, however it's pronounced, Mr. Spock, it's the Vulcan ritual... that's supposed to purge all remaining emotions. The Kolinahr is also a discipline you broke to join us. Will you, please, sit down? On Vulcan I began sensing a consciousness... from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered. Thought patterns of exactingly perfect order. I believe they emanate from the intruder. I believe it may hold my answers. Isn't it lucky for you that we just happened to be heading your way? Bones! We need him. I need him. Then my presence is to our mutual advantage. Any thought patterns you might sense... whether they appear to affect you personally or not... I expect immediately reported. Of course, Captain. - Is there anything else? - No. Jim? If this super intelligence... is as important to him as he says it is, how do we know... That he wouldn't put his own interests ahead of the ship's? I could never believe that. Bridge to Officers' Lounge. Captain Kirk. Revised estimate on cloud visual contact.:3.7minutes. Standard light, Engineer. - Full mag on viewer. - Full mag, Sir. Lingua code? Continuing friendship messages on all frequencies, Sir. All decks and divisions confirmed. Status red. Captain, we are being scanned. Do not return scan, Mr. Spock. It could be misinterpreted as hostility. Intruder scans emanating from the exact center of the cloud. Energy of a type... never before encountered. There's no response to friendship messages, Sir. - Shall I go to battle stations? - Negative. We'll take no provocative action. Recommend defensive posture, Captain. Screens and shields. No, Mr. Decker, that could also be misinterpreted as hostile. Cloud composition, Mr. Spock? - Twelfth-power energy field. - Twelfth-power? We've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every precaution? - Mr. Decker... - Captain. I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud. Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack. If that order isn't clear enough... Captain, as your exec it's my duty... to point out alternatives. Yes, it is. I stand corrected. Five minutes to cloud boundary. Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path to the cloud center. Bring us parallel to whatever we find in there. Mr. Sulu, tactical plot on viewer. Tactical on viewer, Sir. That measures 12th-power energy? Thousands of starships couldn't generate that much... Mr. Spock? Spock, tell me. I sense... puzzlement. We have been contacted. Why have we not replied? Contacted? How? Force fields up full. Deflectors, now. Force fields and deflectors up full, Captain. Analysis, Mr. Spock. Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy, Captain. Exact composition unknown. Guidance system unknown. All decks, brace for impact. Engineering, status report. Systems overloading, Captain. Medic. Medics are coming. Engineering to Bridge. Cannot hold full power on force fields. Deflector power is down 70 percent. Divert auxiliary power to deflectors. Captain. The intruder has been attempting to communicate. I am now programming our computer... to transmit lingua code at their frequency and rate of speed. Commander. Spock! Here it comes. Engineering, what's happening to our force field? Our shields cannot handle another attack. Mr. Spock. Impact in 20 seconds Spock. Fifteen seconds. Spock, transmit now. Ten seconds. Transmitting. It would seem our friendship messages... have been received and understood, Mr. Spock. I would say that was a logical assumption, Captain. Mr. Sulu, hold present position. Holding present position, Sir. Tactical plot on viewer. Course projection on tactical, Sir. Opinion, Mr. Spock. Recommend we proceed, Captain. - Mr. Decker? - I advise caution, Captain. We can't withstand another attack. That thing is 20 hours away from Earth. - We know nothing about it as yet. - Precisely the point, Captain. We don't know what it'll do. Moving into that cloud at this time... is an unwarranted gamble. How do you define ''unwarranted''? You asked my opinion, Sir. Viewer. Standard ahead. Navigator, maintain course. Helmsman... steady as she goes. No vessel could generate a power field of this magnitude. Spock. Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable. Transmit image of alien to Starfleet. Advise we are attempting further communication. Unable to make contact with Starfleet, Captain. Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back. We are closing on it rapidly, Captain. Reduce magnification factor four, Mr. Sulu. We are already two settings below that, Sir. Mr. Sulu... bring us into a parallel course... over the alien... at 500 meters. Five hundred meters? Then take us out to 100 kilometers distance... adjusting parallel course. Aye, Sir. Viewer astern. Reverse angle on the view, Captain. Five hundred meters. Viewer ahead, Sir. Hold relative position here. Mr. Spock! Can that be one of their crew? A probe from their vessel, Captain. Plasma-energy combination. Don't interfere with it. Absolutely, I will not interfere. No one interfere. It doesn't seem interested in us. Only the ship. Computer off. It's taking control of the computer. It's running our records... Earth defenses, Starfleet strength. Ilia! Ilia! This is how I define ''unwarranted.'' Activate auxiliary computer circuits through manual shutoff. Captain, we've been seized by a tractor beam. Get someone up here to take the navigator's station. - Engineering. - Chief DiFalco, to the bridge. - Emergency power. - Going to full emergency. But, Captain, if we don't break free in 15 seconds, she'll burn up. We cannot break free, Captain. We have only a fraction of the power necessary. Engineering, belay that order. Disengage all main drive systems. Chief DiFalco, take over Lieutenant Ilia's station. DiFalco, disengage engine navigation relays now. Aye, Sir. Force field circuits E-10 through 14... show ready for reactivation. Confirm, please. Scotty, drive systems should be free now. Commander? Ready to launch remote communications drone... with complete ship's records... including our present situation, Sir. Delay launching as long as possible. Our drone can't escape as long as we're held in their tractor. Aye. Captain, a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam... might weaken it just enough for us to break free. Break free to where, Commander? Any show of resistance would be futile, Captain. We don't know that, Mr. Spock. Why are you opposed to trying? Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us. They could have done that outside. They still can. Curiosity, Mr. Decker. Insatiable curiosity. Captain, photic sonar readings indicate the aperture is closing. We're trapped, Sir. Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain. Tractor beam has released us, Captain. Confirmed. Vessel is floating free. No forward momentum. Viewer ahead. Viewer ahead, Sir. Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu. Ahead one third. Thrusters ahead one third. Let's take a look. Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock. They can't expect us not to look them over now. Now that we're looking down their throat. Right, now that we've got them just where they want us. It's closing up. Hold position. Captain. All our scans are being reflected back. Sensors are useless. Damn. What do you make of all this? I believe the closed orifice leads to another chamber... undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. I suspect it may be necess... Intruder alert! Deck 5. Officer's quarters. Have Security meet me at deck 5, main elevator. Spock. Mr. Decker, you have the com. Hold positions. You are the Kirk unit. You will assist me. I have been programmed by V'Ger... to observe and record... normal functions of the carbon-based units... infesting USS Enterprise. -Jim, what's going on? - Tricorder. Who is... V'Ger? V'Ger is that which programmed me. Is V'Ger the name of the Captain of the alien vessel? Jim. This is a mechanism. A probe, Captain. No doubt a sensor-transceiver combination... recording everything we say and do. Where is Lieutenant Ilia? That unit no longer functions. I've been given its form... to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units... infesting Enterprise. Carbon-based units? Humans, Ensign Perez. Us. Why does V'Ger travel... to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead? To find the creator. Find the creator? Whose... What does V'Ger want with the creator? To join with him. To join with the creator? How? V'Ger and the creator will become one. And who is the creator? The creator is that which created V'Ger. Who is V'Ger? V'Ger is that which seeks the creator. I'm ready to commence my observations. Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe... might provide some insight into those who manufactured it... and how to deal with them. Fine. Let's get her to sick bay. I'm programmed to observe and record... only the normal functioning of the carbon-based units. The, uh... examination is a normal function. You may proceed. Micro-miniature hydraulics... sensors... and molecule-sized multiprocessor chips. And take a look at this. An osmotic micropump, right here. Even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated. Every exocrine system is the same, too... even eye moisture. Decker. Fascinating. Not ''Decker unit.'' Gentlemen. Will. - What happened to her? - Captain. This probe may be our key to the aliens. - Probe? Ilia? - Exactly. It is a programmed mechanism, Commander. Its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail. Suppose that, beneath its programming... the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision. - They had a pattern to follow. - Indeed. They may have followed it too precisely. Ilia's memory... her feelings of loyalty, obedience, friendship... might all be there. You did have a relationship with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander. That probe, in another form, is what killed Ilia. Commander... Will, we're locked in an alien vessel... six hours from Earth's orbit. Our only contact with our captor is that probe. If we can control it, persuade it, use it... I have recorded enough here. You will now assist me further. The, uh... Decker unit can assist you with much greater efficiency. Carry on with your assignment, Mr. Decker. Aye, Sir. I am concerned with that being our only source of information, Captain. Captain's Log: Stardate 7414.1. Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth. No significant progress thus far... reviving Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe. This remains our only means of contact with our captor. All those vessels were called Enterprise. The carbon units use this area for recreation. This is one of the games. What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy? The words ''recreation''... and ''enjoy''... have no meaning to my programming. Ilia enjoyed this game. She nearly always won. Good. He's using audiovisual association. This device serves no purpose. Why does Enterprise require the presence of carbon units? Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units. More data concerning this functioning is necessary... before carbon units can be patterned... for data storage. What does that mean? When my examination is complete... all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns. Within you... are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit. If I can help you to revive those patterns... you could understand our functions better. That is logical. You may proceed. I remember Lieutenant Ilia once mentioning she wore that. On Delta. Remember? Ilia. Dr. Chapel. Will? Ilia. Commander. Commander. This is a mechanism. Ilia... help us make direct contact with V'Ger. I cannot. This creator V'Ger is looking for... what is it? V'Ger does not know. Computer, commence recording. Captain Kirk, these messages will detail my attempt... to contact the aliens. I intend to calculate thruster ignition and acceleration rate... to coincide with the opening of the V'Ger orifice. This should facilitate a better view... of the interior of the alien spacecraft. Captain, Starfleet signals are growing in strength, Sir. They still have the intruder on their monitors. - It's decelerating. - Confirmed, Sir. Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into Earth orbit. Sir, air lock 4 has been opened. A thruster suit is reported missing. A thruster suit? That's Spock. Damn him. Bring him back here. No, wait. - Get a fix on his position. - Aye, Sir. I have successfully penetrated... the next chamber of the alien's interior... and I'm witnessing some sort of dimensional image... which I believe to be a representation... of V'Ger's home planet. I'm passing through a connecting tunnel. Apparently, a kind of plasma-energy conduit. Possibly a field coil for a gigantic imaging system. Curious. I'm seeing images of planets, moons, stars... whole galaxies all stored here, recorded. It could be a representation of V'Ger's entire journey. But who or what... are we dealing with? The Epsilon 9 station, stored here with every detail. Captain, I am now quite convinced... that all of this is V'Ger... that we are inside a living machine. Ilia. The sensor... must contain some special meaning. I must try to mind-meld with it. Spock. Spock! Spock. Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection. Indications of some neurological trauma. The power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering. Spock. Jim. I should have known. Were you right... about V'Ger? A life-form of its own. A conscious, living entity. A living machine? It considers the Enterprise a living machine. That's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity. I saw V'Ger's planet. A planet populated by living machines. Unbelievable technology. V'Ger has knowledge that spans this universe. And yet... with all its pure logic... V'Ger is barren... cold. No mystery. No beauty. Should have known. Known? Known what? Spock. What should you have known? What should you have known? Jim... this... simple feeling... is beyond V'Ger's comprehension. No meaning, no hope. Jim... no answers. It's asking questions. ''Is this... all that I am? Is there nothing more?'' Bridge to Captain. Kirk here. A faint signal from Starfleet, Sir. Intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors... for the past 27 minutes. Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches. Starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to sub-warp speed. We are three minutes from Earth orbit. I'll be right there. I need Spock on the bridge. Dalaphaline, five cc's. A machine planet... sending a machine to Earth.. looking for its creator. It's absolutely incredible. Mr. Chekov. Commander Decker present location. They are in the engineering, Sir. Captain, Starfleet is sending this tactical on V'Ger's position. V'Ger is transmitting... a signal. Jim. From V'Ger. V'Ger signals the creator. Spock? A simple binary code... transmitted by carrier wave signal. Radio. Radio? Jim. V'Ger expects an answer. An answer? I don't know the question. The creator has not responded. All planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative. Sir, Starfleet computes the devices are proceeding... toward equidistant positions orbiting the planet. They're the same things that hit us. They are hundreds of times more powerful, Captain. From those positions... they could devastate the entire surface of the planet. Why? The creator has not answered. The carbon unit infestation is to be removed from the creator's planet. Why? You infest Enterprise. You interfere with the creator in the same manner. V'Ger V'Ger Captain. V'Ger is a child. I suggest you treat it as such. - A child? - Yes, Captain. A child... evolving, learning, searching... instinctively needing. - Needing what? - Spock. This child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth. Now, what do you suggest we do? Spank it? It knows only that it needs, Commander. But, like so many of us... it does not know what. The carbon units know why the creator has not responded. Disclose the information. Not until V'Ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet. Captain. I'm losing Starfleet. Interference from V'Ger. Kirk unit, disclose the information. Why has the creator not responded? No. Secure all stations. Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge, Captain? - That was the order, Mr. Sulu. - Clear the bridge  - Aye, Sir. Your child is having a tantrum, Mr. Spock. V'Ger requires the information. Bridge, secure all stations. Move out. Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this? All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain. If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise... the information that V'Ger requires will also be destroyed. It is illogical to withhold required information. Kirk unit! Kirk unit. Why do you not disclose information? Because V'Ger's going to destroy all carbon units on the third planet. They have repressed the creator. The information will not be disclosed. V'Ger needs the information. Then V'Ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices. V'Ger will comply... if the carbon units will disclose the information. It learns fast, doesn't it? Captain, the vessel... V'Ger... obviously operates from a central brain complex. The orbiting devices would be controlled from that point, then. Precisely. The carbon unit's information cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe... but only to V'Ger directly. Forward motion, Captain. Tractor beam. Captain, what's the next move? The question is, Mr. Decker... is there a next move? Resume duty stations. All personnel, resume stations. Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff has been called. I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain. Mr. Chekov, when do those devices reach final position? Twenty-seven minutes. Mark. Captain, I believe that is our destination. Forward motion slowing, Captain. I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise. Forward motion stopped, Captain. V'Ger. Sir, I've located the source of V'Ger's radio signal. It's directly ahead. That transmitter is a vital link between V'Ger and its creator. The carbon units will now provide V'Ger... with the required information. Mr. Spock. Bones. Mr. Decker, I will contact you every five minutes. Captain. I'd like to go along. Mr. Sulu, you have the com. V'Ger. ''V... G-E-R.'' V'Ger. ''V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.'' Voyager. Voyager 6. NASA. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Jim... this was launched more than 300 years ago. Voyager series. Designed to collect data... and transmit it back to Earth. Captain... Voyager 6 disappeared into what they used to call a black hole. It must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy... and fell into the machine planet's gravitational field. The machine inhabitants found it to be one of their own kind... primitive, yet kindred. They discovered its simple 20th-century programming... collect all data possible. Learn all that is learnable. Return that information to its creator. Precisely, Mr. Decker. The machines interpreted it literally. They built this entire vessel... so that Voyager could actually fulfill its programming. And on its journey back... it amassed so much knowledge... it achieved consciousness itself. It became a living thing. Kirk unit. V'Ger awaits the information. Enterprise... order up the ship's computer library records... on the late 20th-century NASA probe Voyager 6. Specifically, we want the old NASA code signal... that instructs the probe to transmit its data. - And fast, Uhura, fast. -Aye, Sir. That's what it's been signaling... its readiness to transmit its information. And there's no one on Earth... who could recognize the old signal and send a response. The creator does not answer. V'Ger. V'Ger. V'Ger! We are the creator. That is not logical. Carbon units are not true life-forms. We will prove it. We will make it possible for you to complete your programming. Only the creator could accomplish that. Enterprise? We have just received the response code, Captain. Set the Enterprise transmitter on appropriate frequency... and transmit the code now. Transmitting. and the final sequence. That should trigger Voyager's transmitter. Voyager is not transmitting its data, Captain. The creator must join with V'Ger. Uhura, repeat the final sequence. The creator must join with V'Ger. Voyager is not transmitting, Captain... because it did not receive the final sequence. Jim, we're down to ten minutes. Enterprise, stand by. - The antenna leads are melted away. - Yes, Captain, just now. By V'Ger itself. - Why? - To prevent reception. Of course. To bring the creator here. To finish transmitting the code in person. To touch the creator. Capture God? V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell of a disappointment. Perhaps not, Doctor. Captain. V'Ger must evolve. Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe. It must evolve. What it requires of its god, Doctor, is the answer to its question... Is there nothing more? What more is there than the universe, Spock? Other dimensions. Higher levels of being. The existence of which cannot be proven logically. Therefore, V'Ger is incapable of believing in them. What V'Ger needs in order to evolve... is a human quality... our capacity to leap beyond logic. Joining with its creator might accomplish that. You mean this machine wants to physically join with a human? Is that possible? Let's find out. Decker. I'm gonna key the final sequence through the ground test computer. You don't know what that'll do to you! Yes, I do, Doctor. Decker, don't. Jim, I want this. As much as you wanted the Enterprise, I want this. Captain. Spock, did we just see the beginning of a new life-form? Yes, Captain. We witnessed a birth. Possibly a next step in our evolution. I wonder. Well, it's been a long time since I delivered a baby. I hope we got this one off to a good start. I hope so too. I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose... out of our own human weaknesses... and the drive that compels us to overcome them. And a lot of foolish human emotions. Right, Mr. Spock? Quite true, Doctor. Unfortunately, it will have to deal with them as well. Interrogative from Starfleet. They're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status. Report two casualties. Lieutenant Ilia. Captain Decker. - Aye, Sir. - Correction. They're not casualties. They... List them as missing. Vessel status: fully operational. Aye, Sir. Mr. Scott, shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown? I would say it's time for that, Sir, aye. We can have you back on Vulcan in four days, Mr. Spock. Unnecessary, Mr. Scott. My task on Vulcan is completed. Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1 . - Warp 1 , Sir. - Heading, Sir? Out there. That away., Merry Christmas! - What's your name, little boy? - Eric. What do you want for Christmas, Eric? Hm? A Johnny Lightning 500. - You been good, little boy? - Yeah. Good. You like Santa Claus? Huh? Now, you like Santa Claus, right? Let's sing a little song. ""Jingle Bells."" Get up. Get up! And hold 'em up. - Hold it! - Freeze! Jimmy, watch it. He's got a knife. - Hold it, you son of a bitch! - No, no! That's enough. Don't kill him. That's enough! - Get up! - Come on, give me a break! - I ain't done nothin', man. - Break, your ass. - Come on. - Get up! Will you stop it? Stop it! - Jimmy. - Let me bust him. I wanna bust him. - I wanna bust him. - Let me talk to him. Let me talk to him! - You got a friend here. You got a friend. - You gonna tell us who your man is? When's the last time you picked your feet? Who's your connection, Willie? - Answer him! - No, no, man! Is it Joe the barber? That's who it is, isn't it? Don't give us any shit. What's Joe's last name? - I don't know, man! - Give him a chance. Just give him a chance. All I know is he lives on 125th Street, man. Above the barber shop. What side of the street does he live on? North or south? - I don't know what you're talking about. - What side of the street does he live on? - When's the last time you picked your feet? - What's he talkin' about? I got a man in Poughkeepsie wants to talk to you. You ever been in Poughkeepsie? - Hey, man, give me a break. - Come on, say it. Let me hear you say it. Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie? You've been to Poughkeepsie? I wanna hear it! - Yes, I've been to Poughkeepsie. - You sat on the edge of the bed. You took off your shoes and picked your feet, didn't you? - Now say it! - Yes. All right. You put a shiv in my partner. You know what that means, goddamnit? All winter I gotta listen to him gripe about his bowling scores. I'm gonna bust your ass for those three bags, then I'm gonna nail you for picking your feet. {y:i}Merci. {y:i}Bonjour. {y:i}C'est merveilleux, chri. {y:i}Tu me gtes. Je t'aime. {y:i}C'est pour toi, chri. {y:i}Merci, chrie. Need a little help there? - You dumb guinea. - How the hell did I know he had a knife? - Never trust a nigger. - He could've been white. - Never trust anyone. Goin' sick? - No. - Are you goin' sick? - No! - What d'you say we go to Chez for a drink? - Jimmy, I'm beat. I'm gonna go home. All right, all right. One drink. - Drink this. - Whip it out. I make at least two junk connections at that far table over in the corner. The guy in the striped shirt and tie combo, I know him too. I thought we came here to buy me a drink. Who is that clown? It's a policy guy from Queens. - Dig the creep that's comin' to the table now. - It's Jewish Lucky. He don't look the same without numbers across his chest. That table is definitely wrong. More! More! What about the last of the big-time spenders? Do you make him? No. You? He's spreadin' it around like the Russians are in Jersey. Oh, yes. What do you say we stick around and give him a tail? Come on. Just for fun. Give who a tail? The greaser with the blonde. What for? You wanna play hide the salami with his old lady? Yeah. Miss, can I ask you about those boots? They're... Monica. - Who in the hell's that? - Who keeps score? - Kissy devil, isn't he? Look at him. - Well, they're all cousins. You know that. Yeah, say good-bye. Come on. What's he got now? - Hudson Terraplane, that's what he got. - No, no. - Easy. - OK. Go to work. Cloudy, I'll lay odds he takes us to dago town. We'll take him, Popeye. He's nothin'. Seven o'clock in the morning. I don't believe it. Relax. You're havin' fun, ain't you? If that's not a drop, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's. Make it Alexander's. I like the toy department. He's comin' back. Pass him. Make a left. Alain. {y:i}Our friend's name is Boca. {y:i}Salvatore Boca. B-O-C-A. {y:i}They call him Sal. He's a sweetheart. {y:i}He was picked up on suspicion {y:i}of armed robbery. Now get this. {y:i}Three years ago he tries to hold up Tiffany's {y:i}on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight. {y:i}He could've got two and a half to five, {y:i}but Tiffany's wouldn't prosecute. {y:i}Also, downtown they're pretty sure he pulled {y:i}off a contract on a guy named DeMarco. - ""How about his old lady?"" - ""Her name's Angie. She's a fast filly."" {y:i}She drew a suspended {y:i}for shoplifting a year ago. {y:i}She's only a kid. {y:i}19, according to the marriage license. {y:i}19 goin' on 50. - ""What else?"" - ""He's had the store a year and a half."" {y:i}Takes in a fast seven grand a year. {y:i}So what's he doin' with two cars {y:i}and a tab at the Chez? {y:i}The LTD's in his wife's name. {y:i}The Comet belongs to his brother Lou. {y:i}He's a trainee at the garbageman's {y:i}school on Ward's Island. ""He did time a couple of years ago"" - {y:i}assault and robbery. Black Cadillac. New Jersey plates. RWN-264. I know that one cat. We saw him outside the Pike Slip Inn the other day. I want a blouse like that for my girlfriend, but you could model it. Better not let my husband hear that. I don't care if he hears it. Will you do it for me? OK. How much are you gonna pay? - $50 an hour. - 50 an hour?! - I'll do it. $200. - No, can't afford it. I'll call you later. Bye-bye. Hey, it's 1:30. I didn't expect you till two. - You work around here? - Across the street. {y:i}That's the third time {y:i}he's come here this week. - ""You got anything on this building?"" - ""Clean. I checked the tenant list."" {y:i}Remember Don Ameche, the actor? {y:i}He lives here. {y:i}Oh, yeah, and somebody else. - ""Does the name Joel Weinstock ring a bell?"" - ""You're kidding."" {y:i}No, sir. He lives right here. {y:i}He was the bank on the shipment {y:i}out of Mexico three years ago. {y:i}Yeah, so I hear. He's goin' to Ward's Island. We'll be spotted. Why's he doin' that? Maybe he's gonna go down and see his brother. Well, maybe it's another drop. Well, he gets a free ride. All right, Popeye's here! Get your hands on your heads, get off the bar and get on the wall! Come on, move, move! Come on, move out! Face the wall. Turn around there. Move! - Hands outta your pockets. - Turn around. Turn around. Get on the wall. Hey, did you drop that? Pick it up. - Pick it up! Come on, move! - What are you lookin' at? All right, bring it here. Get your hands outta your pockets. - What's my name? - Doyle. - What? - Mr Doyle. Come here. D'you pick your feet? Do you...? Get over there. Get your hands on your head. - Hold 'em up. - We told you people we were comin' back. We're gonna keep comin' back until you clean this bar up. Keep your eye on your neighbor. If he drops somethin', it belongs to you. What is this, a fuckin' hospital here? Huh? Turn around there, fella. What have we got here? This belong to you? Huh? Stand up there, noddy. Get your hands on your fuckin' head. - You wanna take a ride there, fat man? - Oh, bullshit. Pay attention. We're gonna ask questions later. Turn around. All right, shut up there. Shut up! Anybody want a milkshake? All right, come over here. You and you. Hey, whiskers! Come over here. Move ass when I call you! You! Come on, you, baldie. Come on, move. All right, put it on the bar. - Get it on the bar! - Get the hell in there. - Put your hands on your head. - All of it. Smart ass, you dropped somethin'. Pick it up. You want that hand broken? Get it up there. What else you got here, huh? Turn around. You're under arrest. That goes for you too. Get in that phone booth. Move! Get in there. Face the wall, put your hands against the wall and lock yourself in. Hey, you! Haircut! Where are you going? - You talkin' to me, baby? - Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! Come here! - What's happening? - Where you been? - In there. - Can you stand a toss? - Sure, I'm clean. - You use shit? No, man. Who are you, Dick Tracy or somebody? I said I was clean. - I'm not gonna get stuck, am I? - I'm clean! - If I do, you know what happens. - Yeah. I said I'm clean. Get off! I'll break your motherfuckin' ass! Give me a nickel. Give me a nickel. Come on! I told you I'm clean. What the fuck you wanna come down on me like that for? This is goddamn full of shit. - How's everything? - Everything's everything, baby. There's nothin' out there. It's all milk. - There ain't nothin' around. Nobody's holdin'. - I got a name for you. Sal Boca. Brooklyn. - Boca? - Yeah. B-O-C-A. - Never heard of him. - What about his wife Angie? Doesn't register. There's been some talk, though. - About what? - A shipment. Comin' in this week, the week after. Everybody's gonna get well. - Well, who's bringin' it? - Who knows? - Where do you want it? - Huh? - Where do you want it? - Oh, shit. This side. Beat it! I'm gonna check on this address. If they don't know you, it's your ass. - I thought I told you to stand there! - Get that hair down before Saturday. We're goin' now. Good-bye! Move ass. Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour. Great, but you belong in Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood. Why don't you detach us? Give us a shot, at least till we find out if there's anything here. Everybody wants Weinstock. Maybe here's the lead we're looking for. We deserve this. You couldn't burn a three-time loser with this garbage. The man has done absolutely nothin'. You'll wind up in an entrapment rap. Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs. You put this hustler together with Weinstock and maybe we got a big score. Big score, my ass! At best he's sellin' nickel-and-dime bags. I wouldn't be infringin' on your coffee break if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer. Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle, or have you forgotten about that already? Jesus Christ, Jimmy, what's happened to you guys? Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in arrests. What was it, over 100 again last year? Terrific. But who? What did you bring in? A high-school kid in short pants that had a twitch? You grab a bellhop because he's got three joints in his sock? Walter, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right? It's like a desert full ofjunkies waiting to get well. Goddamnit, this could be it. This little candy-store guy, he's put on a big show in a club with no narcotics connections. They were all over him. And after working a day and night, we tail him to Brooklyn. And we sat on him for practically a week, and who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock. Now you gotta let us have it. Do you believe all this crap? I go with my partner. - What'll it take? - A wire. No, two wires. One on the store, one on the house. You know I have to get a court order for a wire tap, don't you? - But you'll try. - We know you can do it, Walt. Popeye, you still picking your feet in Poughkeepsie? {y:i}J'entends parler de a. {y:i}Je n'arrive pas  y croire. {y:i}Alors je vais un peu parler pour moi. {y:i}J'ai tendance  penser {y:i} mes propres problmes, enfin... Monsieur Devereaux, is this your first trip to New York? - Yes, it's my first. - Why did you choose to come by ship? The next several weeks will be very difficult for me, and the ocean is the only place where the telephone isn't ringing all the time. Do you agree with the recent survey finding that showed that Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in the world? {y:i}Tout  fait, oui. Here's the warrants and the court order for the wire tap. Judge gave you 60 days. Mulderig and Klein'll sit in for the feds. They'll make all the buys. Make sure you keep 'em informed of everything that goes down. You know Doyle there, don't you? Yeah, I know Popeye. His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop. If this is the way you're comin' in on this, why not stay home and save us a lot of grief? - Because that's my opinion. - Shove it up your ass. Whatever. Bill, do me a favor, give them a chance. He came in with a little basic information. You worked with him, had some trouble, but don't get off on the wrong foot. - You have any problems, come to me. - Simonson, just keep off my back. Just try and cool it with him. If you have any problems, come to me. I'll handle him. - I'll be happy to work with him. - He's a good cop. - He's got good hunches once in a while. - Fine. Just keep him off my back. {y:i}Florida's Mackel Brothers {y:i}invite you to join the great escape. {y:i}You can say good-bye to air pollution, {y:i}commuting, high prices, rising taxes {y:i}and cold, depressing winters. {y:i}Mackel Brothers will show you the way {y:i}to Florida and fresh, clean air. {y:i}Warm and sunny year-round weather {y:i}in a home that you'll be proud to own. {y:i}Call Mackel Brothers right now...

She locked me up with my own cuffs. - Where's the keys? - Over there. Hi there. Anybody hurt in this wreck? I thought I told you to get plastic folders for this stuff. Your scrapbook is like you. - A mess. - Give me my pants, will you? Come on. - Did you get the warrants? - Yeah. I also got two feds. Mulderig and Klein. What do we need those pricks for? Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys, and they can get all they want from Uncle Sap. Hello. These yours, darling? 30 over here for this gentleman. Can I get 35? - 35 here. - 35 over here. Can I get 38? - Yeah, right here. - 38 over here. How about 40? - 40 over here. I got 40. Can I get 41? 41? 40 once, 40 twice. Sold to the gentleman for $40.

""Don't forget""- ""anchovies."" - ""Salvatore?"" - ""Yes. Yeah, yeah. Hello."" - Who is it? - ""Yeah, this is Sal. How are you?"" - Sounds like a foreigner. - ""You meet me Wednesday at the hotel, OK?"" - Sounds French. - ""Will I expect you?"" - ""Yeah. What time?"" - ""12 o'clock. Yes?"" {y:i}Yeah. Yes. Strictly small potatoes. You sure can pick 'em, Doyle. Still wearing your gun on your ankle? Someone told me the reason why you do that is when you meet a chick and you rub up against her, she can't tell you're a cop. I said it's bullshit. It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick or somethin'. Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh? He's gettin' too far ahead. You're gonna lose him. For Christ's sake, move the car! What the hell is goin' on here? Klein, this is Cloudy. Do you read me? Come in, for Christ's sakes! {y:i}This is Cloudy. Do you read me? {y:i}Listen, we lost him on the bridge. Right. I got him. He's headin' north on East River Drive. Excuse me. You take Sal. I'll take the beard. There goes Sal. - You want the red or the white? - Pour it in your ear. - Yes, sir? - Yeah, guy just walked in, what's his name? I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog. He made me, too. He lives on four, he went up to six. He's cute, real cute. The other guy's a Frog. He checked into the Edison. Had a hooker sent up. You should have collared him right there. - Who's on him? - Klein. - How about Sal? - We put him to bed for the night. Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit. Come on. Look, my partner and I made this case, you know, originally. - We don't want any feds screwing it up. - Case? So far you haven't shown me a thing. You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right into next week. - Knock it off. - Don't tell me to knock it off. Cut it out, will ya, for Christ's sakes! There's nothin' goin' down. Get some sleep. Blastoff. 180. 200. Good Housekeeping seal of approval. 210. US government certified. 220. Lunar trajectory. Junk-of-the-month club. Sirloin steak. 230. Grade-A poison. Absolute dynamite. 89 per cent pure junk. Best I've ever seen. If the rest is like this, you'll be dealin' on this load for two years. - It's worth the half million? - How many kilos? - 60 kilos... Eight big ones a kilo, right? This stuff'll take a seven-to-one hit on the street. By the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be 32 million. Thank you, Howard. Take what's left there with you and good night. Uh-uh. Not that one. The little one. - I guess we got a deal, huh? - What we got here, Sal, is a test. A deal for half a million dollars? Maybe. Maybe? Come on, the guy's in a hurry. He wants the bread. He wants to go back to France. This guy's not gonna play games. Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats I ever come across. What am I, a schmuck? What's the hurry? He could see a couple of shows, visit the top of the Empire State Building. Don't jerk me, Weinstock. I spent a lot of time settin' this one up. So what do you want, a badge? This is your first major-league game, Sal. One thing I learned: Move calmly, move cautiously, you'll never be sorry. Look, I've been damn careful up to now. This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawlin' all over you like fleas. - He'll take the deal somewhere else. - Let him take it and find out how easy it is to put together a half a million in cash. There's no hurry to do this kind of business. The stuff is here! We can make the switch in an hour! Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll split if we don't move. This guy's got 'em like that. He's everything they say he is. What about you, Sal? Are you everything they say you are? That son of a bitch. Thank you. - Hello? - This is Doyle. I'm sittin' on Frog One. Yeah, I know that. We got the Westbury covered like a tent. The Westbury, my ass! I got him on the shuttle at Grand Central. Now what the hell's goin' on up there? I make him comin' out of the hotel. He was free as a bird. What the hell are you talkin' about? Yeah, well, uh... Listen, I don't care how many bartenders you got that are sick. No, I'm not workin' that joint. That's right. Same to ya, buddy. Can I get a grape drink? {y:i}Watch the closing doors. Son of a bitch! Hi. Can I have a round-trip ticket to Washington? - Cash or charge? - Cash. Cash is $54. Please print your name on both tickets before you board the plane. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Have a nice flight. - Yes, sir? - Round trip to Washington. - So? - So everything's goin' great. Terrific. Beautiful. I'll need a few more days, though. The boys think we oughta cool it for a while, just to make sure there's no heat. You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington? I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a policeman. Look, I'm levelin' with you. I need a little more time. My people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch, that's all. It has to be by the end of this week. Look, Charnier, you gotta be reasonable. It's your problem. Well, it's your problem, too. So nice to have seen you again. We found a set of works on the kid driving the sports car. - His girlfriend's in the back. She's dead. - Give the car a toss. - I say we keep sittin' on Boca. - Jimmy, give it up. It's all over with. If there was a deal, it's gone down by now. We blew our warrants and we blew our cover. Listen, I know the deal hasn't gone down. I know it. I can feel it. I'm dead certain. Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop. Break it up! Will you two break it up? Stop it! Hold on to yourself. What's the matter with you? Jimmy, you wasted two months on this. No collars are comin' in while you're runnin' around town jerkin' off! Now go back to work! You're off special assignment! Get down! Get out! Get outta the area! Leave her alone! Stay away! Leave her alone. There's a sniper up there! Stop that man! He's wanted by the police! - What's the next stop into the city? - 25th Avenue. Hold it! Hold it! Police emergency. I need your car. When am I gonna get it back? For Christ's sake! Hold it! Stop! Halt! - Don't stop. - But... - Don't stop or I'll kill you. - I gotta stop in the next station. Touch the brakes and I'll blow you in half. - What's goin' on? - I don't know. Sit down, buddy. Relax. Coke! Coke, you all right? Hey, Coke, you all right? Don't answer. Hey, Coke, you all right? - Get back. - Relax. Keep going. You're not gonna get away with this. Put the gun down. Get back! - Come on, now. - I said get back! Stop! Hold it! Let's get outta here! Come on, come on. Shake your ass. Can't seem to find the damn ticket. - Where's the guy? - He's gettin' my car. He's in the back. Thank you. - Can I help you, sir? - Yeah. - You got your ticket? - I must have dropped mine. What kinda ticket did you have? He's in the brown Lincoln. Foreign plates. He's walking towards Front Street. {y:i}Got him. Angie's parked over here in the LTD. {y:i}Cute. You stay with her. {y:i}We're gonna sit on the Lincoln. The car's dirty, Cloudy. We're gonna sit here all night if we have to. What time is it? Ten after four. - Huh? - Ten after four. That's the third time those guys have been around. All right, let's hit 'em. Hit 'em! Freeze! Nobody move! Put your hands in the air! Stay right there. If you move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off. - What the hell's that? - What are you doin'? Turn around. Who's the boss here? Who's runnin' this outfit? You are? What are you doin' here? - Just runnin' around. - Who sent you down here? Don't talk back. - What are you doin' here? - We saw the car. We was breaking down the tires. That's all it was. Lock 'em up. Come on, come on! Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves! - Nothin' there except a New York City map. - Are you bullshittin' me? That car's dirty. Take it in and tear it apart. Tear it out. Nothin' here, Jimmy. This is all solid. There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory. That thing is clean. I don't buy that, Irv. The stuff is in that car. Well, you find it. I can't. {y:i}Enfin on ne va pas passer la journe ici. {y:i}a fait deux heures qu'on est l. {y:i}Soyez patient. Look, the car was lost sometime last night. First they send us to Pier One, then here. Then what? Why did you park the car down by the waterfront? You're staying in midtown Manhattan and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge? Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television. He probably left the car to look at something. We were told by the police commissioner that the car was brought to this garage. - I demand its immediate return. - You have to be patient. We get four or five hundred cars here a day. Monsieur Devereaux is an important guest of this country. He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government. Here are his credentials from the French consulate. Unless you wish to see this in his film, I suggest you locate the car immediately. You're in a no-smoking area, sir. Would you please extinguish your cigarettes? What was the weight of the car when you got it, Irv? 4795 pounds. You sure? That's what it was. 4795 pounds when it came into the shop. Owner's manual says 4675. That's 120 pounds overweight. And when it was booked into Marseilles it was 4795. That's still 120 pounds overweight. Jimmy's gotta be right. Listen, I ripped everything outta there except the rocker panels. Come on, Irv. What the hell is that? Shit. Son of a bitch. All right. I got it for you, Randy. It just came in from downtown. - Who's Devereaux? - I am Mr Devereaux. Why? I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot of cars here and it's hard to keep track... - You mean the car is here now? - Oh, yeah. It's right outside. They stole it right off the street from you, huh? Goddamn. You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know. I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it. Yeah, well, that's New York. Is this your first trip over here? Yes. Where's my car, please? It's right over here. You're lucky this time. It's in perfect shape. Not a scratch. You must lead a charming life. Henri. {y:i}Je vous attendais. Let's go! I wouldn't be surprised if I'd been followed. - Listen, I'll see you at Pop's tonight. - OK, babe. Take care. They got the bridge blocked off! This is the police. You're surrounded. Come out with your hands up! This is the police. You're surrounded. Give 'em the gas! Hold your fire! Stop! They're comin' out! Hold your fire! Popeye. It's me, it's me. Frog One is in that room. Drop it! Mulderig. You shot Mulderig. The son of a bitch is here. I saw him. I'm gonna get him. Visiontext Subtitles: Sally Lewis US ENGLISH, ...was so ably pointed out by the Secretary-General in his opening remarks. But, and I must emphasize this point, no formula can or will ever cover each case. For instance... ...when three or more applicants have been recognized, which is in direct contradiction to... Whose funeral is it? Yours. When you were young And your heart was an open book You used to say live and let live You know you did, you know you did You know you did But if this ever-changing world in which we live in Makes you give in and cry Say live and let die Live and let die What does it matter to ya? When you got a job to do, you got to do it well You got to give the other fellow hell You used to say live and let live You know you did, you know you did You know you did But if this ever-changing world in which we live in Makes you give in and cry Say live and let die Live and let die One more time again? Not married by any chance, are you? Good morning, 007. Good morning. - Insomnia, sir? - Instructions. You haven't much time. I'll explain as you pack. Pack, sir? Three of our agents have been killed during the last 24 hours. Dawes in New York. Hamilton in New Orleans. - And Baines in the Caribbean. - Baines, I rather liked Baines. We shared the same bootmaker. Coffee, sir? I take it these killings are connected. That's precisely what you're going to find out. Baines was working on a small island in the Caribbean called San Monique. Dawes was in New York keeping an eye on its prime minister, one Dr. Kananga. Hamilton was on loan to the Americans in New Orleans. Is that all it does? By the way, congratulations seem to be in order. The Italians were most impressed by the way you handled the Rome affair. Thank you, sir. Sugar? Thanks. Well, the authorities were more than helpful. There's one small complaint. They seem to be missing one of their agents, a Miss Caruso. You wouldn't happen to know where she is? Miss Moneypenny. Morning, Moneypenny. - Good morning, sir. - Certainly the hour that's indecent. Really? I've got your ticket to New York. Q has repaired your wristwatch. And some background material on San Monique. Thank you, Moneypenny. I'm sure the overburdened British taxpayer will be fascinated to know how the Special Ordnance Section disburses its funds. In future, Commander, allow me to suggest a perfectly adequate watchmaker, just down the street. Good God. You see, by pulling out this button, sir, it turns the watch into a hyper-intensified magnetic field. Powerful enough to even deflect the path of a bullet at long range, or so Q claims. I feel very tempted to test that theory right now. If you don't mind, Commander, my spoon. Oh, sorry, sir. Thank you. Dr. Kananga is, at present, in New York. The CIA have been informed, and they're helping out with the surveillance. Your flight arrives at 11:30 a. m. Now, where did I leave my coat? Oh, allow me. Thank you. Come along, Miss Moneypenny. - Morning, Bond. - Sir. Miss Moneypenny, thank you. Goodbye, James. Or should I say ciao, bello. Such a delicate touch. Sheer magnetism, darling. A man comes. He travels quickly. He has purpose. He comes over water. He travels with others. He will oppose. He brings violence and destruction. Hello. Mr. Leiter for you, sir. Thank you. Hello, Felix. How are you? Traffic permitting, I should be with you in about half an hour. Then you can buy me the best lunch in New York. Fine, James. Your friend Kananga has just left the UN. He's probably headed back to his embassy. No, no, don't worry. I've got the place eyeballed, wired for sound, the works. Right. I'll see you in about a half hour. Easy, Charlie. Let's get there in one piece. Charlie? Right. Stand by. Here comes Kananga's limousine. Out he gets with the usual goon squad and the girl. Time, 11:46. What is that? Hello, Felix? You know how I hate to trouble you, but I've run into a little bother. You what? Get me a make on a white pimpmobile. 347 Nelson-David-George. It would seem, Dr. Kananga, that the conference has not lived up to your prior expectations. Well, we can only hope that this is a temporary setback. However, I do have some observations to make. Take a letter, please. To Secretary-General, Pan Island Unity Conference. Sir. I wish to point out that... ...too many of our island neighbors have once again let themselves be bullied by United States industry. The story is an old one, the record a clear one. Since my historic statement of principles was delivered and acted upon some six months ago, our economic outlook has improved dramatically. By exercising our policy of friendship to all with favoritism towards none, new respect for the entire area has been engendered. And even though some of my most important... James, that car is registered to a shop at 33, East 65th Street. That's only a block away from here. Right. Take your time, buddy. Kananga's knitting a flag in there. It might be the easiest thing to do. Something in heads? Just browsing. Thank you. Do you think you could gift-wrap it for me, please? Lengthwise, if you don't mind. Thank you. ...remains my first concern. Thus, San Monique's future obligations vis--vis her island neighbors would seem clear. Those who fawn and crawl in the face of intimidation must perforce to look up to those who stand proudly wrapped in a justifiable self-confidence. The time has come, painful as it may be, to gaze out among our sister nations in the area and see if any stands tall... He's tailing. I got him in my sights. - Hey, you know where you going, man? - Uptown, I believe. Uptown? You headed into Harlem, man. Well, you just keep on the tail of that jukebox and there's an extra 20 in it for you. Hey, man, for 20 bucks I'll take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout. 125th, you got a honky on your tail. He's heading east. Can't miss him. It's like following a cue ball. That's the car. They must have gone inside. Pull up where you can. Sure hope you make friends easy. Right on, brother. He's heading on in. Good afternoon. Bourbon and water, please. First booth will do. - Tell him neat, would you? - Huh? - No ice. - That's extra, man. I'd like something on the side as well, information. Three men and a girl came in. Relax, baby. Mr. Big's gonna take care of you in a minute. Black queen on the red king, Miss... - Solitaire. - My name's Bond. James Bond. I know who you are, what you are and why you've come. You have made a mistake. You will not succeed. Rather a sweeping statement, considering we've never met. The cards have followed you for me. Now, you get ripped off in Detroit, baby, you yell out to me, you hear? Is he armed? You can't be too careful in New York City these days. Funny how the least little thing amuses him. Oh, fascinating. Well, that's you, quite obviously. An amazing resemblance. Tell me, am I in there as well? Pick a card. Turn it over. You have found yourself. I'm telling you, you all go out there to LA and clean it up, or I'm coming out there and clean you up, and I mean that! Is this the stupid mother that tailed you uptown? There seems to be some mistake. My name is... Names is for tombstones, baby. You all take this honky out and waste him, now. - ""Waste him""? Is that a good thing? - The reading is over. Nothing about my future? Us? Now, promise you'll stay right there. I shan't be long. Thank you. Keep your hands up, honky. What does he think this is? I'll blow his frigging head off, man. Drop it! Now. ""Harold Strutter, CIA."" Where were you when I didn't need you? Kind of obvious you weren't coming out front, not even with that clever disguise you're wearing. Whiteface in Harlem. Good thinking, Bond. Let's get out of here. I'm surprised they didn't spot you, too. There's a most remarkable girl back there with a deck of cards. I saw those cards on the way up. Spades, James, every one. You were nailed the minute you left 74th. There's only supposed to be one man who can pull together that much black muscle in this town. Calls himself Mr. Big. You name the business, they say he has a black concession. What would a foreign prime minister like Kananga want with an American gangster? The question is, what would Mr. Big want with a two-bit island diplomat? Mr. Big? Where the hell does he fit into this mess? A genuine Felix lighter. Illuminating. Now, listen, James, we just found out that Kananga's got a private plane and he's leaving for San Monique within the hour. Then get me on the next available flight, will you, Felix? I already did. I just knew you wouldn't pass up a chance to get away from where the real action is. The legendary Baron Samedi, folks. That's Saturday, for those of you who speak French. Voodoo god of cemeteries and chief of the legion of the dead. The man who cannot die. But for our purposes, just a performer in a little musical extravaganza we've cooked up for you wonderful people. Good evening. The name is Bond. You have a reservation for me. Yes, Mr. Bond, of course. Mrs. Bond has been expecting you. - Mrs. Bond? - She arrived earlier this afternoon, sir. Said she preferred something a little more private. Bungalow 12. An incurable romantic, Mrs. Bond. Room service, please. Room service? This is Mr. Bond, bungalow 12. I'd like a bottle of Bollinger, please. Slightly chilled. Two glasses. Thank you. Anybody home? Your champagne, sir. - What was that? - Your champagne. Put it on the table. Thanks. - Shall I open it? - What? Shall I open it? No. I can manage. Thank you. - There you are. - Thank you. Mrs. Bond, I presume? I'm Rosie Carver. I guess I have a little explaining to do. Yes. Either you or dear Uncle Felix. Custom. 38 Smith & Wesson. Corrugated 3-inch stock. No serial number. Standard CIA issue. Question is, why point it at me? The man who delivered your champagne is not a hotel waiter. I was just trying to be careful. As for Felix Leiter, you're right. I've worked for CIA down here for some time now, and he cabled me you were coming and asked if I wouldn't help out, if I could. Perhaps you'd better start by getting your head together. - There's a mirror in the bathroom. - Yes. You're only my second mission, you know. My first was Baines, the agent who was killed. It's a relief to know I'm next in line for the same kind of aid. There's a... - There's a... - A snake. I forgot. I should've told you. You should never go in there without a mongoose. I should have never gotten into any of this. I'm going to be completely useless to you. I'm sure we'll be able to lick you into shape. It's getting late, Mrs. Bond. Tomorrow is going to be a very busy day for us. You see, Kananga is protecting something down here, something which Baines obviously discovered. You're going to show me the spot where Baines' body was found. That, I'm afraid, only leaves us tonight to, well, catch up on old times. Felix told me there'd be moments like this. What did good old Felix suggest? If all else failed, cyanide pills. I settled for two bedrooms. Good night, Mr. Bond. Mrs. Bond. Why, it's just a hat, darling, belonging to a small-headed man of limited means who lost a fight with a chicken. It's a warning. Get it out of here! Please. Please don't leave me alone tonight. James, please promise me. All right, darling, if you insist. I promise. I thank you. Rosie! Breakfast's up! - Rosie, are you ready yet? - What? I have to see about organizing a car. I'll see you in the lobby. Over here, sir. Over here. Guaranteed big fish. - Catch big fish, sir. Hey, baby. Over here. Bring your man over here. Just $20. Half a day. You got warm lady. We got cold beer over here, man. You wanna catch a big fish, sir? It's only 2 pounds over here. Good morning. Come on, Rosie. This one seems eager enough. Excuse me. Where can I change? Me. Clothes off. Where? Stop right there. Turn around slowly. Keep your hands up! As I was saying, Quarrel, a lousy agent. But the compensations speak for themselves. Rosie Carver, meet the man who shares my hairbrush, Quarrel Junior. I'm really sorry. I could've shot you. You might have even killed me if you'd taken off the safety catch. Never mind, darling. You just let us know when we get to the spot where Baines was killed. It's up in the hills just after we clear the next cove. Hey, Quarrel, who the hell lives up there? That's the house of the Kananga woman. She's supposed to have the power of the obeah. No one on the island dare go up there except him. He comes again. There will be violence. He approaches even now. By land or water? Water. He has arrived. Good. Rosie's been more efficient than I anticipated. I know a place where we can rustle up a car. Beautiful, brave and now resourceful. Rosie, you seem to be staging a remarkable comeback. Tell me about the future. Is it death? I said, is it death? It is death. They're coming. Rosie knows what to do. Now, I want no bodies this time, no trace. It's down there. But I thought you said Baines was killed up in the hills, darling. Up in the hills down there. Why don't we have a bite of lunch and discuss it? There's an excellent patty in the hamper. I'm in no hurry. Are you? No. James, you don't know what finding you has meant to me. Oh, I can imagine. And you've no idea what finding this has meant to me. You do know what the Queen of Cups means in an upside-down position? A deceitful, perverse woman, a liar, a cheat. And I'd like some answers now. Please. You don't understand, see. They'll kill me if I do. And I'll kill you if you don't. But you couldn't. You wouldn't. Not after what we've just done. I certainly wouldn't have killed you before. It used to be a convincing act, Rosie. It's wearing a little thin now. It's not an act. It's... Make your choice. Rosie. You will explain what went wrong. I see the intervention of a woman. The girl was about to confess. We had to kill her. The trap was set. Tee Hee was waiting. And you saw death. It must have been the girl's death. If you do not ask specific questions I cannot be responsible for your misinterpretation of the answers. These growing signs of impertinence begin to disturb me, Solitaire. Even as they did with your mother before you. She had the power and lost it, became useless to me. You will not make the same mistake. Solitaire. Where is Bond now? I cannot see when you are this way with me. Things become unclear. Let us hope these momentary lapses do not become a habit. Your power exists to serve me, and it is mine to control. If and when the time comes I decide you are to lose it, I myself will take it away. Solitaire, go to sleep. You have made me angry with you, and I have no wish to be. Tee Hee. Put down those cards. It is a blasphemy. They tell nothing to those who cannot see. But they do. That's a bit of luck. Good luck for both of us. The cards say we will be lovers. You're mistaken. It's impossible, forbidden for me. Now you must go. But you do believe, I mean really believe, in the cards. They have never lied to me. Then they won't now. Pick one. You knew the answer before it was given. Strangely enough, somehow so did I. So it's finally happened. Just as it did to my mother and her mother before her. Well, of course it did. Well, you're visual proof of that, aren't you? Come on. Cheer up, darling. Has to be a first time for everyone. Now, tell me, where's Kananga? I cannot see. - Oh, yes, the cards. I'll get them. - No. There's no need to be frightened. You'll soon be rid of him, I promise. I promise. I just need a little bit of information, that's all. The power, I've lost it. The high priestess is wife to the prince, no longer of this world. The spiritual bridge to the secret church. It's my fate. By compelling me to earthly love, the cards themselves have taken away my powers. Darling, I have a small confession to make. Now, try not to be too upset. The deck was slightly stacked in my favor. It makes no difference. The physical violation cannot be undone. When he finds out I've lost my power, he'll kill me. Now, come on. He'll have to find you first. Lovers' lesson number one, we have no secrets. For example, I have a boat waiting. You can be on it. All I have to know before we leave is what goes on back there in Voodooland. Darling, three men and a girl have been killed in the last four days, not counting the number of times they've tried to stop me from discovering whatever Kananga's protecting. Now, do you want to be on that boat or not? I simply read the cards for him. I've never been there, and he's never taken me there. I've never dared to go, but I've looked in the cards. I've seen great riches there. They'll kill you. Us, darling. They will kill us. Lovers' lesson number two, togetherness till death do us part, or thereabouts. Is there time before we leave for lesson number three? Absolutely. There's no sense in going off half-cocked. - This way. - How can you be so sure? Well, these scarecrows are to scare people away. You're not scared, are you? Lesson number four, follow the scarecrows. - Good morning, boss. - Good morning. It's sure gonna be a beautiful day. Yes, sir, a beautiful day. They're heading for the hill. They're here. If he finds it, kill him. Quick! We've lost him. He has the girl. They're somewhere under the nets. At any cost, any. Bond must die. Unit two-five, we have picked them up. Base to two-five. Arrest Bond. But, I repeat, the girl is not to be touched. Message received and understood. Over and out. Base to all units. I repeat, the girl is not to be touched. Sweet mother of pearl. All change. End of the line. Get down below quickly. Here. I'll do that. You get us started. It appears a bust. James. He'll be looking for me now. I know he'll never stop. Come on, darling. It's all over. Voodooland was just poppy fields. A simple matter of heroin smuggling. I'll have a word or two with a man named Felix and turn the entire case over to him. And you and I will be off. By the way, where would you like to go? Anywhere where we can find one of these. How quickly can we make it to New Orleans? Santa Mina, four hours away. You can catch a flight and be there in the morning. Then get in touch with Felix on the scrambler. Tell him to meet me there tomorrow. Royal Orleans Hotel. Tampa is closer. Hamilton was killed in New Orleans, so there has to be a connection. And this is a valuable piece of merchandise we are carrying, which with any luck, they'll want back. Royal Orleans Hotel, please. Are you sure this is the way to New Orleans? I don't know, but it sure beats the hell out of Harlem, don't it? Well, hello, Jim. What's happening, baby? Just ease back now, Jim. Relax. Mr. Big wants to see you. You made a mistake back on that island, Bond. You took something that didn't belong to you, and you took it from a friend of Mr. Big's. That type of mistake is tough to bounce back from. - But I've only just arrived. - Today is your lucky day, Jim. You're going skydiving. There's a hell of a view of the lake from 10,000 feet. My only regret is I won't be there to see it. - Good morning. You're... - Mrs. Bell. You're not my instructor. - Where's Mr. Bleeker? - Indisposed. I'll be giving the lesson. Come on, come on! What's on for today? Well, let's just wing it, shall we, Mrs. Bell? You're over-revving. Leroy, slow down! For Pete's sake, slow down! Do what the man say! I can't find the brake! Close those doors! Holy shit. Look out! Look out! Okay, Don. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Right. Talk to you later. I gotta go and give a lesson. Same time tomorrow, Mrs. Bell? Yes, Mr. Bleeker. Yes, sir. Well, I know you just can't glue the wings back on. Now, Mr. Bleeker, I'm sure there's no reason for name-calling. No, that's fine. - You can fit the rest this afternoon. - Right, sir. Don't forget the double vents. I appreciate she may be one of your best pupils, yes. That'll do nicely. That's a little frantic. I'll keep the other three. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Bleeker, any suggestion of that kind should be forwarded in writing to Washington. - How is Mrs. Bell? - Intensive care. But she'll pull through. Yes, sir. Oh, no, sir, no one's questioning your patriotism. I'm sure you're a veteran, sir. Felix, you might find out if there's a Fillet of Soul restaurant in town. James, we're way ahead of you. It's on Docker Street. Strutter's watching it now. Hell of a send-off. This way. - Where's Strutter? - He's gotta be inside somewhere. Two, gentlemen? I got a nice booth over here just against the wall. Do you think you could find something a little closer to the stage? - What's wrong with a booth? - I once had a nasty turn in a booth. - Bourbon. No ice, please. - Two Sazeracs. Where's your sense of adventure, James? This is New Orleans. Relax. When you were young And your heart was an open book You used to say live and let live - One of you guys called Felix Leiter? - Yeah. Right here. Telephone call for you. Guy called Strutter. Thanks. For a minute there, I thought Harry was laying down on the job. Say live and let die What does it matter to ya? When you got a job to do, you got to do it well You got to give the other fellow hell What happened to my... - What happened to my friend? - What happened to your friend? Listen... Thanks for dropping in, baby. Yeah, you one tough pig to nail down. You've been picking at me like some kind of maggot. First, you go up to Harlem and kill one of the brothers. That disturbed me. Well, then you go and steal this valuable young lady from my good friend, Dr. Kananga. Now, old Kananga, he believes in all that card crap. I mean, he's mad. Well, possession being nine points of the law, I would say Kananga is your problem now. Thank you. In fact, if I were you, I'd watch my step from now on. Yeah, well, you just let me handle our business with the man. I've got my own plans for you, baby. But first, there's one little question that he wants answers for. In that case, you'd better ship me back to the island and let him ask in person. I'm not in the habit of giving answers to lackeys. You damn lucky you got a ear left to hear the question with. Which is, did you mess with that? That's between Solitaire and myself and Kananga. I'll tell him when I see him. You ain't gonna see the sunlight unless you answer me! I had no idea you were so frightened of him. - Did you touch her? - When I see Kananga. Right. Quite revealing. Kananga, poppy grower in thousands of acres of well-camouflaged fields protected by the voodoo threat of Baron Samedi. And as Mr. Big, distributor and wholesaler through a chain of Fillet of Soul restaurants. Wholesale? Sell heroin for money? My apologies. I'm sure you simply give it away. Excellent, Mr. Bond. That's precisely what I intend to do. Two tons of it to be exact. When entering into a fiercely competitive field, one finds it advisable to give away free samples. Man or woman, black or white. I don't discriminate. Two tons of heroin with a street value well over a billion dollars, nationally distributed free? That should make a certain group of families rather angry, wouldn't you say? Angry? Why, my dear Mr. Bond, it'll positively drive them out of their minds and, subsequently, out of the business. Quite ingenious. A sort of junkie's welfare system. Well, merely until the number of addicts in the country has doubled, shall we say. Then I will begin to market that acreage that you blundered into the other day. That heroin will be very expensive indeed, leaving myself and the phone company the only two going monopolies in this nation for years to come. And here I thought it was Solitaire did the fortunetelling. Let's hope for both of your sakes she still can. The question still stands, Mr. Bond, asked by the gentleman concerned. Did you touch her? Why, it's not the sort of question a gentleman answers. Well, having set the example, I don't expect Miss Solitaire to be any less the lady. By the way, that's a particularly handsome watch you're wearing, Mr. Bond. - May I see it, please? - You'll forgive me if I don't get up. Butterhook. Tee Hee, on the first wrong answer from Miss Solitaire, you will snip the little finger of Mr. Bond's right hand. Starting with the second wrong answer, you'll proceed to the more vital areas. Solitaire, my dear, I want you to listen to me very carefully. On the back of Mr. Bond's watch, the registration number Do I speak the truth? You speak the truth. Well. If nothing else, at least I have laid your fears to rest. My compliments on a splendid operation. There is one thing, however, the... Whisper, take him to the farm. When do we start back? Soon, Solitaire, soon. Solitaire, why? I treated you well. You lacked for nothing. - I don't understand what you... - Mr. Bond's watch, my dear. I gave you every break possible. You had a 50-50 chance. You weren't even close. I had no choice. Please believe me. The cards. When the time came, I myself would have given you love. You knew that. You knew that! There's only one proper way to deal with this. And one proper time. The tonnage order is nearly complete. We move it out tonight. And I mean tonight. Mr. Bond. How much do you know about crocodiles, Bond? Oh, I've always tried to keep them at arm's length, myself. Cute little nippers, ain't they? I don't suppose those potential overnight bags are orphans? Oh, no. We have some moms and dads, as well. In fact, quite a few thousand. This is the part I like best, feeding time. I suspect the highlight of the tour. Some of these babies live to be 200 years old. Look over there. That's an alligator. You can always tell by its round nose. There's old Albert. He's a croc. Got over-careless with him sometime back and he took my whole arm off. - Well done, Albert. - They'll eat anything, even each other. Then again, sometime they can go a whole year without eating. Oh, I was rather counting on that. There are two ways to disable a crocodile, you know. I don't suppose you care to share that information with me? One way is to take a pencil and jam it in the depression hole behind his eyes. And the other? Oh, the other is twice as simple. You just put your hand in his mouth and pull his teeth out. It's on fire! Adam, get him! Adam, get the car! Cut him off! Hector, move, damn it! Bond ripped off one of our boats! He's headed for the Irish Bayou. The man that gets him stays alive. Now, move, you mother... Toby! Toby, I got me a regular Ben-Hur down here doing 95 minimum. - Need any help, J.W.? - Hell, no! You got a set of wheels that just won't quit, boy. If they're yours, that is. You spin around, boy. Ten fingers on the fender. Legs apart. I'm sure this ain't exactly your debut with this sort of thing. You picked the wrong parish to haul ass through, boy. Nobody cuts and runs on Sheriff J.W. Pepper. And it's him speaking, by the by. What the... J.W., soon as you nail that offending vehicle, Miss Pearson just called. Seems her dog's foaming all at the mouth. She's got him locked up in her shed, wondering if you'd like to come over and shoot it for her. You tell Miss Pearson take a flying... That look like a boat stuck in the sheriff's car there, Eddie? Boy, where you been all your life? That there's one of them new car-boats. By the powers invested in me by this parish I hereby do commandeer this vehicle and all those persons within. And that means you, smartass. Unit 23 in position. Ten-four, 23. Come in, 28. Hey, J.W., seems like Deke Rogers done got his boat stole off the river. But picked up a new one in his swimming pool. Sheriff, you want to get your boys off our frequency? Give me that! Now you listen to me, trooper boy! We got a swamp full of black Russians driving boats to beat the dam down here! Relax, Sheriff. We've got a roadblock waiting for them at Miller's Bridge. Unit 26 at Miller's Bridge. We're just about all set here. Make that secure there, you hear? Okay, fellas, here they come. All right, out of my way! I'm in charge here! You two boys, come on! I don't want excuses, trooper. I want those two men and their boats - apprehended immediately, did you hear? - Yes, sir, Captain. I understand. But I don't know right off where we're going to find a boat fast enough to catch them. I got it. You call my brother-in-law Billy Bob. He got the fastest boat on the whole damn river. Billy Bob will sure enough fix their ass, huh? Yeah, call Billy Bob. Now, there's two boats, Billy Bob, and they're moving like buttered pigs. Now, I promised these boys here you would get them. - Don't let me down, hear? - Cool down, J.W. I'm on my way. - You want something, boy? - Yes, I'd like to borrow this boat, if I may. Everybody on the river would like to borrow this boat. Billy Bob, we got them spotted. They're headed for Haley's Landing. That's my brother-in-law! That's Billy Bob! He'll get them. Billy Bob'll get them. Hot damn! If one side of the Pepper family don't get them, the other side will. Let's go! If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak, or else hereafter... Headquarters to all units, suspects seen proceeding down via Liberty towards Highway 11. Proceed with caution. Would you get that chicken coop off the road? Did you ever think of getting a driver's license, boy? Are you sure that was your brother-in-law, Sheriff? - Hello, Felix. What are you doing here? - We'll get to that later. Kananga's in town. He's got your girl with him. They just took off. There's the son of a bitch! I got him! What are you? Some kind of doomsday machine, boy? Well, we got a cage strong enough to hold an animal like you here. Captain, would you enlighten the sheriff please? Yes, sir. J.W., let me have a word with you. J.W., now, this fella's from London, England. He's an Englishman working in cooperation with our boys, a sort of secret agent. Secret agent? On whose side? We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago. We came up with nothing but these. Kananga's clear. You should have seen the size of the guy who got on the boat with him. Nine feet tall, I swear. Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in one hand and Solitaire in the other. The incendiary bombs are set for midnight. Now, that gives you exactly 30 minutes. Watch out for sharks on the way back. - I'll see you for breakfast, Felix. - Good hunting. You're going to need these and the shark gun on the way back. - Seems like the party's started. - My regards to Baron Samedi, man, right between the eyes. Trouble! Ah, Mr. Bond, there you are! And Miss Solitaire, as well. Hardly unexpected, but most welcome. Whisper! Two more glasses for our guests! - What shall we drink to, Mr. Bond? - Well, how about an earthquake? Welcome home! - Where's our boy? - He'll be along anytime now. I checked behind a rock, and his wet suit is gone. Keep the change. It's unfortunate that your wet suit was discovered only minutes before the field was destroyed. - Don't tell me you're not insured. - No. The poppy's a very sturdy flower. You have been a relatively minor nuisance, in fact. But this gun... I find it particularly fascinating. What is it? A shark gun, naturally, with compressed gas pellets. Ingenious! Don't pull the pin out. The air in here is foul enough already. Somehow I never thought of you as a poor loser. I was hoping you would join me to a drink to the future. Oh, Miss Solitaire used to know all about the future. She was especially good at predicting death. An underground monorail. Connected to the last refuge of a scoundrel, no doubt. The heroin leaves here, I take it, carried somewhere by that winch. Correct again, Mr. Bond. What a quick study you are. Let me show you exactly how it works. - Where in hell can the man be? - Relax. He must have got tied up somewhere. These cans hold 25 pounds each. There are 20 cans to a shipment, packed in watertight... Metal containers. It's your show, Kananga, but I'm sure there must be a simpler way of drowning someone. Drown, Mr. Bond? I doubt you'll get the chance to drown. Perhaps we could try something in an even simpler vein. On the contrary, Mr. Bond. I think you'll find those wounds quite fatal. Whisper. The gate. Oh, slowly, Whisper! Slowly, slowly. Let our diners assemble. Look out! Where's Kananga? Well, he always did have an inflated opinion of himself. Oh, James, how do we get out of here? We take the train, of course. Well, thanks for everything, Felix. I'll see you tomorrow night at the 21 Club, and don't be late. I still don't see why you want to travel this way. I mean, what the hell can the two of you do on the train for 16 hours? Say goodbye to Felix, darling. Now, the first thing to learn in playing gin rummy is to never take a card from the exposed pile, unless you really need it. Gin. James, what are you doing? Just testing an old adage. Unlucky at cards... - Do hurry up, James. - Won't be a moment, darling. Lock the door as well on your way up, would you, James? After all, we wouldn't want anyone to just walk in on us, would we? The first time in my life, I feel like a complete woman. The slightest touch of your hand, I was always so afraid that a part of me would stay with the past. But now I know there's no chance of that any longer. Just to be able to reach out and touch you. Mr. Bond, it's good to see you again. Well, that wasn't very funny. Now what are you doing? Just being disarming, darling. When you were young And your heart was an open book You used to say live and let live You know you did, you know you did You know you did But if this ever-changing world in which we live in Makes you give in and cry Say live and let die Live and let die, What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who died? That she was beautiful and brilliant? That she loved Mozart and Bach? The Beatles? And me? - Do you have this book? - You have your own library. - Answer my question. - Answer mine first. We're allowed to use the Radcliffe library. I'm not talking legality, I'm talking ethics. Harvard's got five million books, Radcliffe a few thousand. I only want one. I've got an hour exam tomorrow, damn it! Please watch your profanity, preppy. Why do you think I went to prep school? - You look stupid and rich. - Actually, I'm smart and poor. No, I'm smart and poor. - Why are you so smart? - I won't have coffee with you. - I wouldn't ask you. - That's what makes you stupid. Comp. Lit. 105. Not bad. Music 150. Not bad. Music 201, that's a graduate course. - Renaissance polyphony. - What's polyphony? Nothing sexual, preppy. I told you, my name is Oliver. - First or last? - First. - Oliver what? - Barrett. - Barrett like the poet? - Yeah, no relation. - Barrett like the hall? - Yes. I'm having coffee with a Harvard building. I'm not Barrett Hall. My great grandfather just gave it to Harvard. So his not-so-great grandson could get in? If you think I'm a loser, why did you bulldoze me into buying you coffee? I like your body. - I major in Social Studies. - It doesn't show. - It's an honours programme. - I know you've got a few brains. - Really? - You're hung up on me, aren't you? - Jenny? - Yeah? Listen, you Radcliffe bitch. There's a hockey game on Friday. - So? - I want you to come. Why would I go to a lousy hockey game? - Because I'm playing. - For which side? Two minutes for number seven. Holding. Penalty. Barrett, Harvard. Two minutes. Holding. Why are you here when your friends are playing? I'm in the penalty box. - What did you do? - I tried too hard. - Is that a big disgrace? - I'm trying to concentrate. - On what? - On how I'll total that bastard. Come on, Harvard, let's go! Are you a dirty player? Would you ever total me? - I will right now if you don't shut up. - I'm leaving. Goodbye. Barrett back in the game. Harvard have full strength. And a goal. Ackerman. Assist, Barrett. - Now I've seen a hockey game. - What did you like best? - When you were on your ass. - Thanks for coming. I didn't say you could kiss me. - I was carried away. - I wasn't. I may not call you for a few months, or I might call you when I get back to my room. - Bastard. - You can dish it out, but not take it. - Hello, animals. - Hey, Ollie. - What did you get? - An assist. - Off Cavilleri? - None of your business. - I'm your roommate! - Has Barrett got a new goodie? Jenny Cavilleri. It's a music type from Rhode Island. - I know her. Real tight-ass. - Plays piano for the Bach Society. - What does she play with Barrett? - Probably hard to get. Simpson. Up yours. That proves it. Hello, Jen? What would you say if I told you... I think I'm in love with you? Never say ""love"" if you don't mean it. You're a known quantity. Meaning? You're known for quantity. At Radcliffe, every hall is Barrett Hall. - You've been checking up on me. - I won't dine outdoors with anybody. - Am I just anybody? - What do you think, preppy? You'll have to fend for yourself this weekend. I'll be mixing it up with Francis LaPierre. - Very funny. - Are you jealous? He's the captain of the Cornell hockey team. You've been reading the sports page. I wouldn't mind watching you play against Cornell. No. I'll be involved. Oh, yeah. The All-Ivy title. - More than the All-Ivy title? - A lot more. Cornell goal. Score tied, 3-3. Come on, man! Quit! I'll kick your ass back to Montreal! Get up! You're out of the game, Barrett. Come on! - Je vais te casser la gueule! - I'll break yours before mine! Come on, Barrett, get off the ice! You Montreal faggots! What?! Francis LaPierre started the fight! - Get in! - Come on! Five minutes for number seven. Fight. Penalty. Barrett, Harvard. Five minutes for fighting. You probably want a steak, son. No, thanks. The doctor took care of it. I meant for your stomach, Oliver. - I'm supposed to eat with the team. - Oh, that's fine. - Does your face hurt? - No, sir. - Jack Wells should take a look at it. - That's not necessary. - Jack's a specialist. - It's nothing special. - My car's there. Can I give you a lift? - I'll walk you to your car. Have you heard from the Law School? I haven't exactly decided on the Law School. I was merely asking if the Law School had decided on you. - No. - There really isn't any doubt. - About what? - The school needs good men like you. - They haven't got a hockey team. - You have other qualities, Oliver. I'm sorry you had to see Harvard lose. I came to see you play. The Dean of the school is an old classmate... That's very nice, sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. - Give my best to Mother. - Yes, I will. Briggs Hall. Sandy Davidson. Jennifer Cavilleri. You have a call. She's in the downstairs phone booth. - Where is that? - Around the corner. Would you please... For God's sake, Phil! Yes. Yeah, yeah, for the million-and-oneth time, yeah! Absolutely! Oh, I love you, too, Phil. Yeah, I love you, too. Goodbye. - What happened? You look terrible. - I'm injured. Did you make the other guy look worse? I always make the other guy look worse. - Jenny? - Yeah? - Who's Phil? - My father. You call your father Phil? - It's his name, what do you call yours? - Son-of-a-bitch. - To his face? - I never see his face. - Why? Does he wear a mask? - In a way. He must be proud. You're a Harvard jock. - So was he. - Bigger than All-Ivy? He rowed single sculls in the 1928 Olympics. - Did he win? - No. - Then why is he a son-of-a-bitch? - He leans on me. - He makes me do the right things. - So? I don't like to have to put out X amount of achievement every term. You hate making the Dean's list and being All-Ivy! He expects no less, and when I come through, he is so indifferent. - Ridiculous! - And what did he say after the game? He went all that way to watch you play? After I was nearly massacred by the wild Canadian hordes, do you know what he said to his son? - Whores in Ithaca? - ""I know the Dean of the Law School."" What did you expect him to say? ""How is your sex life?"" - Whose side are you on? - I didn't know it was a war. - You don't understand. - More than you wish I did. Did the son-of-a-bitch at least get lousy grades? - He was a Rhodes scholar. - There's a problem of overachievement. - Forget about it. There's no problem. - Right. Do I call my father on the phone? Do I say, ""I love you, Phil?"" - No. - There you are. And do you know why? Because his name is Oliver. The great Barrett Hall. Don't you salute when you pass it? - It's ugly. I've never been inside. - That's a mature attitude. It's not easy living with history. - How many have to cope with that? - I could name two. Thanks. Must you play music while we study? I'm studying the music. It's called ""Analysis of Form"". Yeah... You'll flunk if you just stare at me. - I'm not. I'm studying. - Bullshit. You're looking at my legs. - You're not that great looking. - I can't help if you think so. - Let's change the subject. - I wasn't aware there was one. You think that I wanted to make love to you. - But I'm not interested. - Then we've got one thing in common. I'm tired of playing your game. You are a supreme Radcliffe smart-ass. The best. You put down anything in pants. But verbal volleyball is not my idea of a relationship. If that's what you think it's all about, go back to your music waltz. I think you're scared. You put up a wall to keep from getting hurt, but it also keeps you from getting touched. It's a risk, isn't it, Jenny? At least I had the guts to admit what I felt. Some day you'll have to come up with the courage to admit that you care. I care. - Would your priest like this? - I don't have one. - Aren't you a good Catholic girl? - Well, I'm a girl... ...and I'm good, right? So that's two out of three. - Why do you wear it? - It was my mother's. Why did you leave the Church? I don't know. I never really joined. I never thought there was another world better than this one. What could be better than Mozart? Or Bach? Or you? Jenny? I'm up there with Bach and Mozart? And The Beatles. - Let me sack in your couch. - How come? - Barrett. - Who's the guest of honour? - Cavilleri. - Again? Still? Barrett's slipping. It's amazing. I'm really studying. - I'm studying. - Sorry. Oliver? I love you. You were great. - You know nothing about music. - I know enough. Wise up, would you please, Barrett? I wasn't great or All-Ivy, just OK. OK? OK. - I mean you should keep at it. - Who said I won't? I'm going to study with Nadia Boulanger. Who? Next year. I have a scholarship in Paris. Paris? Yeah, I've never been to Europe. I can hardly wait. - How long have you known? - It's inevitable. What is? That we'll separate. You'll go to Law School. - What are you talking about? - You're a millionaire, I'm a social zero. What do you mean? We're together, we're happy. Harvard is like a bag full of toys, but when the holiday is over, you have to go back where you belong. - Back to bake cookies? - Pastries. Don't make fun of my father. Then don't leave me, Jenny! Please. What about my scholarship and Paris, which I've never seen? - What about our marriage? - Who said anything about marriage? I'm saying it, now. You want to marry me? Yeah. Why? Because. That's a good reason. - You're driving like a maniac. - Everybody does in Boston. You'll kill us before your parents can murder us. - My parents will love you. - Even the son-of-a-bitch? Of course. Where is the old Radcliffe confidence? - Back at Radcliffe. - It's going to be OK, Jenny. - What did you say on the phone? - Just that I'd drop by. - Very casual, huh? - Yeah, right. How often do you visit during a term? - Never. - Oh, that's casual... Holy shit! Stop, Oliver. No kidding, stop the car. I didn't think it would be like this. - Like what? - I mean, like this rich. - This is too much for me. - Don't worry. It'll be a breeze. Yeah, but why do I wish my name were Abigail Adams or Wendy Wasp? Don't be scared. - Aren't you? - No. - So far, so good. - That's not saying much. - Your hand is cold. - So is yours. - Let's get away from here. - Master Oliver! Hello! Hello, Florence. This is Jenny. ""Master""? I always knew you had slaves. Let me take your wrap. Your parents are in the drawing room. Thank you, Florence. Half the buildings of Harvard are hanging there. Oh, it's nothing. You're related to the Sewall Boat House? Yes, I come from a long line of wood and stone. Hello there. - I'd like you to meet Jennifer Calaveri. - Cavilleri. - As in ""Cavalleria Rusticana""? - Right. No relation. - Hello, Mum. - Hello, darling. Nice to meet you. How are you, son? Fine, sir, fine. Please sit down and make yourself at home. We'll have to go soon. Why are you so uncomfortable with your parents? - Why did you want to leave at once? - I didn't like how they treated you. ""What is it your parents are in?"" - What is it your people are in? - My father bakes cookies. - What's the name of the firm? - Phil's Bake Shop. - Of Cranston, Rhode Island. - How interesting... - So your people are from Cranston? - Mostly. My mother is from Fall River. - The Barretts have mills in Fall River. - Where they exploited the poor. In the 19th century. When you inherit, you can give all our money back. That's what the philosopher Saint-Simon advocated. In the 18th century. - It's late. - Aren't you staying for dinner? - Yes. - No. I have to get back. You're staying for dinner and that's an order. Everything is an order, a directive, a command. Where is your sense of humour? In school, he used to send me memos. Memos! Don't you find that odd? I find it rather cute. Have you heard from Law School? - Not yet. - He'll get in. Who's better than Oliver? I agree. He'll graduate with honours. He's always done well in school. At Exeter, he was... It doesn't mean a thing. I'm just one of many trying to get in. - I could give Price Zimmermann a ring. - No! I mean, please don't, sir. Just to find out if he knows. I want to get my letter with everyone else. Please. - He was only trying to be helpful. - I don't need that kind of help. - OK. - No, it's not OK. He's not going to be satisfied until he cuts them off. What you wouldn't like to be cut off. Oh... Well, we've got to take care of those. - Take care. - Get there a minute later, but get there. - You really like to bug your father. - The feeling is mutual. You wouldn't stop at anything to get to him. It's impossible to get to Oliver Barrett III. Unless maybe if you marry Jennifer Cavilleri? - Is that what you think? - Yes, it's part of it. You don't believe I love you? Yes, but you also love my negative social status. No. I can't pass judgement. I just think so. I love not only you, but also your name and your numeral. After all, it's part of what you are. - Oh, how can you do it? - What? How can you see me and still love me? That's what it's about, preppy. - How are you, son? - I'm OK, sir. Did you hear from Law School? - Yes. I called you, remember? - Yes. Congratulations. - You'll be on the Supreme Court. - I may just chase ambulances. Fine. How's Raymond? He's fine. Got into OCS. Army? That's good. That's bad. You haven't mentioned Jennifer. What is there to say? You're presenting us with a fait accompli. - But what did you think? - She's absolutely charming. With her background, to get to Radcliffe is... - Get to the point! - It doesn't concern her, but you. Your rebellion. And you are rebelling. I fail... I fail to see how marrying a brilliant Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion. She's not some crazy hippie. She's not many things. What irks you most, that she's Catholic or poor? - What attracts you most? - I'm leaving. Don't go off half-cocked. I would only ask that you wait a bit. Define ""bit"". Finish Law School. If it's real, it'll stand the test of time. It is real, but why should I put it through a test? - I'm asking you. - You're commanding me! If you marry her now, I'll not give you the time of day. Father, you don't know the time of day! We're looking forward to having you with us. Me too, Dean Thompson. - Something has come up. - A change of heart? No, I'm still set on Law School, but... I'm going to need a scholarship. - Really? - That's why I'm here. That's rather curious, considering your background. - I'm not his son anymore. - I beg your pardon? We have had a misunderstanding. It's a parting of the ways. - This is very unfortunate, Mr Barrett. - I'm not exactly jumping for joy. We have many entering students in far worse straits than you. What's worse than destitution? I'm getting married next month. We'll work all summer, and then Jenny will teach in a private school. That's a living, but not tuition. Your tuition is pretty steep. Yes. I need a scholarship. I have already been accepted. - I don't have any money. - You have a millionaire father. Had. Why should I be penalised just because I was related to a rich man? Mr Barrett, I don't think that this office should enter into a family quarrel. - A rather distressing one, at that. - I see. Thank you. Perhaps at mid-year's. Thank you. You've been very generous with your time. - We just passed my junior high school. - I can't believe he liked my poverty. He did! Now you've got something in common. God, when I first told him Oliver Barrett... - Yeah? - He couldn't believe it. He reminded me of the Eleventh Commandment. - Eleventh? - ""Do not bullshit thy father."" Any other commandments I should know? Yeah. ""Stay loose."" - So is he for it? Does he approve? - What do you think? - I won't allow it, do you get me? - You're tilting at windmills, Phil. Stop calling his father a windmill. He's a distinguished citizen... - Mr Cavilleri... - Phil. - I'll call his goddamn father. - It won't do any good, goddammit! - Don't use profanity in this house. - You do. - What will he think? - That you've gone mad. Because I won't allow a parent to reject a child? - Mr Cavilleri... - Phil. Phil, sir... I reject him, too! Don't talk like that. A father's love is something to cherish and respect. - It's a rare thing. - Especially in my family. - Let's get him on the phone. - We have this cold line. He'll thaw and melt. Believe me, when it's time to go to church... Let's get him on the phone. - Please, Phil. - What? About the church bit... Well, we're kind of negative on it. I didn't necessarily mean the Catholic Church. You know that Jennifer is Catholic? She may have told you that. And her sainted mother always dreamed of the whole mass rigmarole, but you're... But God would bless this union in any church. - Phil? - Yeah? - About the God bit. - Yeah? - We're sort of negative about that, too. - About God? - About anybody's God? - Neither of us believe. And we won't be hypocrites. If that's what you wish. Just tell me who performs the wedding. We do. You mean to do it yourself? That's... wonderful. I mean, that's just... wonderful. Do it yourself, huh? I think that's just wonderful. But, tell me, is it? What's the word? - You mean ""legal""? - Is it? Yes. One of the college chaplains just sort of... He presides over it, and the couple address each other. You mean the bride speaks, too? - It's a new world, Philip. - Oh, yeah. It's new, all right. Ready? - Amen. - They haven't started, yet. How will I know? I've never been to a do-it-yourself. Listen to the words they have chosen to read on this occasion. Amen. The priest said ""sacred"". - He's not a priest. - He is to me. ""When our two souls stand up erect and strong ""Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher ""Until the lengthening wings break into fire at either curved point, ""What bitter wrong can the earth do to us ""That we should not long be here contented? ""Think! In mounting higher, the angels would press on us ""And aspire to drop some golden orb of perfect song ""Into our deep, dear silence ""Let us stay rather on earth, Beloved, ""Where the unfit contrarious moods of men recoil away ""And isolate pure spirits ""And permit a place to stand and love in for a day ""With darkness and the death-hour rounding it."" ""I give you my hand! ""I give you my love more precious than money ""I give you myself before preaching or law ""Will you give me yourself? Will you come travel with me? ""Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?"" I, Oliver Barrett, take you, Jennifer Cavilleri, to be my wedded wife from this day forward... ...to love and to cherish till death do us part. I, Jennifer Cavilleri, take you, Oliver Barrett, as my wedded husband from this day forward, to love and to cherish till death do us part. By the authority vested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I pronounce you man and wife. Now I'm being kept. - You won't like it. - I already do. The school only pays me 3,000 a year. - Why? - Because my name is Mrs Barrett. - Couldn't you be Miss Cavilleri? - Then I'd be the Queen of Paris. It's a bargain. Four rooms for 82.50 a month is impossible this side of Mongolia. But this is the Mongolian section of Cambridge. Gee... I have to admit that it's even worse than I expected. - Yeah, but it's home. - Yeah. - Well? - Well what? - Carry me over the threshold. - Do you believe that nonsense? - Carry me and I'll tell you. - We're at the top floor! OK, I'll be a young and beautiful divorcee. Hey, what is this, Barrett? I'll tell you after we cross the threshold. - This is not a threshold. - Our name is there. It's not an official threshold. Upstairs, you preppy! - Why are you so heavy? - I might be pregnant. - Are you? - Scared you, didn't I? - No, I... - Don't bullshit me. For a second I clutched. Is this the official threshold? - What do think? - If you don't say yes... Yes! - Where's Barrett? - Where are the kids? Asleep, thank God. It's siesta time. I've got 45 minutes. That's more than they give me. Damn it! - What's wrong with this engine? - You're a Harvard Magna. - Not in mechanics. - Welcome to the world, preppy. - Listen, Cavilleri... - The name's Barrett, Barrett. Sometimes you are really a bitch. - How are they treating you? - Fine, except for one brat. He'll be breaking and entering before 10. - What now? - He tried to pinch me. - I don't blame him. - Next time, I'll wallop him. Not until you get his parents' tip. Damn it! - Let's get out of here. - Don't touch me. - What a thing to say to your husband! - Wash. You can touch me afterwards. I had another salary hassle today with Miss Anne Miller Whitman. - I hope you laid it on thick this time. - I told her I was proud to work for them. I said, ""Even Barretts have to pay their rent."" - To which she retorted... - ""Ho, ho, ho!"" - Define ""Ho, ho, ho"". - 3,500 for the year. Ridiculous! Would you like to support me while I take courses to teach in public school? - Would you please say something? - Ho, ho, ho. - I thought you'd call after the meeting. - I wanted you to study. - Have you eaten? - I waited for you. - You're a growing boy. - Not anymore. Yes, in the mind. Did you check the mail? Just one second. This is a crucial precedent. - Did you check the mail? - No. Anything vital? - We are cordially invited... ...to pay the light bill. To a dinner. Your father's 60th birthday. - Did you hear me? - Yes. RSVP. - You even have to ask? - It's about time. - For what? - You know. Does he have to crawl here? He's reaching out. My mother addressed it. Think. 60 years old. Maybe he won't be around for a reconciliation. There won't be one. - Oliver V will bug you... - He won't be called that! He can be called Bozo. He'll still resent you for being a Harvard jock! - You'll be on the Supreme Court... - He won't resent me! - Why not? - Because I... Your father loves you like you'll love Bozo, but you Barretts are so proud that you'll always think you hate each other. If it weren't for you? The case is closed! - There's still the RSVP. - I think you can handle it. I have never deliberately hurt anyone, and I don't think I could. Jennifer! Just answer no. - OK. What's the number? - Can't you write a note? I'll lose my nerve. What's the number? 338-3434, and dial 1 first. Good evening, this is Jennifer Barrett. Mr Barrett! Good evening, sir. Fine, thank you. Yes, we did. That's why I'm calling. I'm terribly sorry, I mean we're terribly sorry, but... no, we can't. I'm sorry. Oliver, please talk to him. Just say hello. - I will never talk to him. - Can't you do it for me? I've never asked you to do anything in my whole life. Just for me. No. You're a heartless bastard. Mr Barrett? Oliver would like you to know that in his own special way, he loves you very much. Get the hell out of my life! I forgot my key. Jenny, I'm sorry. Don't. Love means never having to say you're sorry. Concentrate on blending and stop showing off your voice. But I wasn't! - No bullshit. You were showing off. - Sorry, Jenny. One last time and this time I want crisp diction. Wow! That was really incredibly, absolutely... ...not bad. - Tomorrow at 8.30, OK? - OK. Bye, Jenny. Well, Barrett, what brings you to church? The saloons closed early. Did you get us a tree? Don't worry about it. We'll get one on the way home. What are you doing New Year's Eve? Sleeping. I thought you'd want to spend it with me. What are you doing? Sleeping. Some day, we'll look back on these days... The sooner, the better. Go! Jennifer, come here! Jennifer, come here! What? Come on! Start it over again. - What is it? - I have something important to tell you. - Couldn't you tell me over there? - No, I want to be alone with you. Fantastic news. Here, read. Harvard Law School? You got kicked out. Read it, will you? It's great news. - You were first in the class? - Not quite. Third. - Only third, huh? - That means I make the Law Review. Say something, please. Not until I've met numbers one and two. And the William DeJersey Memorial Award for the finest senior essay to... ...Oliver Barrett Iv. - On your feet. - How much? 500 big ones! Holy shit! - Get up! Come on! - Quiet! The Jennifer Barrett Maternity Award! - It was a good apartment for 80 bucks. - Now our garage will cost that. - Why have a car in New York? - House calls, Jenny. Lawyers for Jonas and Marsh don't make house calls. - Yes, to Mr Jonas and Mr Marsh. - You can walk there. - Rich people ride. - Nouveau riche people. That's us. You won't laugh? I'm actually getting to like the name Bozo. - For what? - Our kid. Our huge and bruising All-Ivy tackle. - Bozo Barrett? - It's the name of a Harvard superjock. You would actually call our offspring Bozo? Only if it's a boy. - We have crossed the poverty line. - Not quite. - What? - Not until I'm carried over the threshold. - We've done that! - Now you're a lawyer. It'll be legal. - It's on the tenth floor! - Carry me in the elevator. Thank God for that. - Can I help? - Barrett. 10-H. The bags are in the car. - Is the lady all right? - I will be when I'm over the threshold. - Newly-weds, huh? - Eternally. Move your ass, preppy. You've got it made, you bastard. Made in the shade. - Snug as a bug in a rug. - Cut the crap and play. Working for Jonas and Marsh, pulling in the coin... - Play, damn it! - I can't help it. Married to ""Foul Mouth Angelface"". Pay attention. - Why should you have all the luck? - It was a long drag. This is the first week that Jenny hasn't had to work. - What is she going to do? - I want her to study, she wants a baby. - So? - So we're making babies. - Do you need any help, old buddy? - I'll call you if I need you. - Whose fault is it? - I wouldn't use the word ""fault"". OK, we'll put it your way. Two 24-year-olds can't make a baby. One must be malfunctioning. Who? Jenny. All right, then we'll adopt kids. The problem is more serious. Jenny is very sick. Define ""very sick"". She's dying. That's impossible. I'm sorry to have to tell you this. That's impossible. It's a mistake, it has to be. We repeated her blood test three times. The diagnosis is correct. She'll have to be told soon. We can withhold treatment for a little while, but not for long. We'll have to begin therapy sometime during the next few weeks. She's only 24. - Will it be painful? - Hopefully not. You'll want to talk to a haematologist. I can refer you to Dr Addison. Yeah. What do I do? What can I do for Jenny? Act as normal as possible, for as long as possible. That's really the best thing. Normal. OK, I'll be as normal as hell. Jen? Jenny, I'm home. - I need a lawyer. - I'm a lawyer. I need you. - I need you, too. - Why? I'm not a lawyer. No, but you're a nut, and I happen to need a nut. - You look lovely, Jenny. - Bullshit. - OK, you look terrible. - No, I never look terrible. - I look OK for Thursday evening, OK? - There's no poetry in ""OK"". Screw poetry. Just tell me what you see. - I see you. - That's poetry. Did Dr Shapeley tell you that we both checked out? Yeah. So we just have to keep trying, right? - Yeah, let's try now. - At this very minute? Even sooner. Jenny? Get out there and support me in the manner to which I'll be accustomed. Get up. - Are you meeting Stratton today? - Who? Ray Stratton, your best friend. Your roommate before me. - We're supposed to play, but I'll cancel. - The hell you will! - Why not? - I don't want a flabby husband. - All right, but I'll take you out to dinner. - Why? Can't I take my wife to dinner if I want to? - OK, Barrett, what's her name? - What? If you take your wife out in the middle of the week, you're screwing somebody. - What's the matter? - Off day. You've had an off day for two weeks now. Jonas wants me to go to Chicago on a big case. That newscaster that got beat up by the cops. Fantastic. You on the other side of a punch-out rap. - I turned him down. - Why? I couldn't see living in some hotel. Boy, you're really married! Your time will come. Mrs Barrett! I'm in the kitchen where I belong. Come here. - Guess what. - You got fired. - I got fired up. Guess where to. - Reno, Nevada. Paris, France. We'll be there Christmas Day. No, that's not the way we'll do it. - Do what? - I don't want Paris, I don't need Paris. - I just want you. - That you got, baby. And I want time, which you can't give me. You saw Dr Shapeley? And his buddy, too. He's a very nice guy. - Good. Who? - Dr Addison. He's a Yalie, college and med school. But I said you wouldn't mind. Not if he's nice. He didn't bullshit me, and that's what I wanted. - OK, then for the Yalie doctor. - OK. I'm counting on you to be strong, you goddamn hockey jock. I will, baby. I will. It will be hardest for Phil. You, after all, are going to be the merry widower. - I won't be merry. - Yes, you will. I want you to be merry. You'll be merry, OK? OK. OK. - Enough? - No. I love watching you. - The old hockey fake-out. - That's you, the old hockey fake-out. - Can we get hot chocolate? - Sure, I'll even pay. - Very gracious of you. - I liked it best when I supported you. You always supported me. After all, what's money? I don't know. - Could we afford a taxi? - Sure. Where do you want to go? The hospital. She's getting white cells and platelets, which she needs most. - She doesn't want antimetabolites. - What's that? A treatment that slows cell destruction. But there are unpleasant side effects. Jenny's the boss. Whatever she wants. Do everything you can to make sure it doesn't hurt. - We will. - I don't care what it costs. - It could take months. - Screw the cost. There's no way of knowing how long she'll linger. I want her to have the very best. I'm wealthy. I'm rich. Really, I'm like a millionaire. - How have you been? - Fine, sir. - And how is Jennifer? - She's fine, sir. I need to borrow 5,000 dollars for a very good reason. Well? - Sir? - May I know the reason? I can't tell you. Just lend me the money, please. - Don't they pay you at the firm? - Yes, sir. - And doesn't she teach... - Don't call her ""she"". - Doesn't Jennifer... - Leave her out of it. Just write out a cheque. It's a very important personal matter. You got some girl in trouble? Yeah, that's it. Please lend me the money. Thank you, Father. How is she? She wants the troops home for Christmas. - Always running the show. - She may succeed. - That fast? - Yes. Hello, baby. Phil. How is it going, Mrs B? It's going, preppy. The troops will be home for Christmas. - That's a little trite. - It's the goddamn truth. Watch your language. There's a grown-up present. I hope so. Phil made a few promises. Don't worry, Jenny. Maybe I ought to let you guys... I'll be nearby. It doesn't hurt, Ollie. It's like falling off a cliff in slow motion. Only after a while you wish you'd hit the ground already, you know? Yeah. Bullshit. You've never fallen off a cliff. Yes, I did. When I met you. Yeah. ""What a falling off was there."" - Who said that? - I don't know. Shakespeare? Yeah, but who? I mean, what play? I went to Radcliffe, I'm supposed to remember those things. I once knew all the Mozart Koechel listings. - Big deal. - You bet it was. What number is the A Major Concerto? - I don't know. I'll look it up. - But I used to know all those things. - Do you want to talk music? - What do you want to talk? Funerals? No, I don't. Ollie? I told Phil you could have a Catholic service and you'd say OK. OK? It'll really help him a lot, you know? OK. Now you've got to stop being sick. Me? That guilty look on your face, it's sick. Stop blaming yourself, you stupid preppy. It's nobody's fault. It's not your fault. That's the only thing I'll ask you. Otherwise, you'll be OK. Screw Paris! What? Screw Paris and music and everything you thought you stole from me. I don't care, don't you believe that? Then get the hell out of here! I don't want you at my deathbed! I believe you. I really do. That's better. Would you please do something for me? Would you please hold me? I mean really hold me. Next to me. Philip? I wish... I wish I hadn't promised Jenny... I wish I hadn't promised Jenny to be strong for you. Oliver. Why didn't you tell me? I made some calls, and when I found out I jumped in the car. Oliver, I want to help. Jenny's dead. - I'm sorry. - Love... Love means never having to say you're sorry. Subtitles: Elizabeth Paul, Come on, come on. - Where have you been? - Delayed. That I figured. This is a big deal for me. Hendricks had the keys to the Jeep. I couldn't find the spares. Listen, act as if you've been here the whole time. - How? - Look bored. Thank you Amity High School Band for that eloquent selection. We're happy, once again... Mama, Michael won't talk to me. - What are you doing here? - Mrs Silvera couldn't come. And now this year's Miss Amity, Tina Wilcox, will cut the ribbon, officially opening this luxurious new hotel. This money tree is donated by Len Peterson, the builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, as a gesture of goodwill. Let's hear it for Len. Thanks, Len. $1,500 as a special gift to the Amity Scholarship Fund. Go ahead, Tina, cut it. Atta girl. And now the Amity High School Band once again. Refreshments on the patio, everyone. Oh, boy. Let's go. Brody, how are you? Hello, Martin. - I think it went well. - Hell of a speech, Larry. Right on the money. Thank you. Have you met my son Larry? - No. - Larry Jr. Larry, over here. Here we go. Say hello to Len. - How you doing? - Hi, Larry. - Nice-looking boy. - Thank you. Ellen, make sure that the bar is open and everyone's taken care of. Sure. Yes, sir, a fantastic lady. - Don't know what I'd do without her. - Really? Neither do I. - How old is your cousin? - 17. She's a senior. I'm not crazy about blind dates. They're OK if they got little white canes and tin cups. - That's awful! - Ah, what the hell? - Did your mom put all this together? - Yeah, it's her job. - Did she make the punch? - No. Good, it's terrible. - Get your dance? - Nope. - Me neither. - Who you gonna ask next? Tina Wilcox. Ed's girlfriend. You're crazy. It doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes beautiful girls are the loneliest. That's a crock of shit. I know. Was it the fourth or fifth night at the Jersey shore? The fourth! - I thought you wouldn't respect me. - I did! I did! Why don't we get out of here? What? To fool around? - Why not? - You're on. This pipe has more barnacles than you do. What are you doing? I told you! Brush it off to your left! Your other left. I thought you were off duty. Good morning! Till noon - I'm on my own time. - Hey, Chief! - Yeah? We got a gold plater in the main channel, a big cruiser. - Whereabouts? - Off the point. No running lights, just the diver's flag. - Want me to run out there? - Would you? I can't run this thing! - Happy to do it. - I'll see you back at the office. Take the old man of the sea. Cast off the bowline, and then the stern line, and then cast off the spring line. Let's go! We'll only be here for a few minutes. - Can't I come with you? - No. - He can come with me. - No. - No? - No. Off the boat. He can help me, at least. Boo! Big brothers! Hey, Sean, ever been an anchor before? - Mike, hi. - You going out now? - No. - Good, you can meet my cousin. Don't worry, I'll meet her. OK, Tom, see you later. Same time Thursday. Andy, over here. See you guys later. - What's the problem? - What isn't?! Brooke! Brooke! Jackie, hi. Quick, quick, who's that? - I'm in love! - The cousin, I hope. Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky... Did you see the way she looked at you? - She wants you. - She wasn't looking at me. What? She was staring at you and drooling. No, I'm thin, I wear glasses, I live in Amity Island year-round. I'm not good enough for her. You're right, she probably wasn't looking at you. Larry, look. Larry, look! - What? - Look at her. Good to see you! - Well? - She's got tits like a sparrow. Do you have to talk like that? What are you, my mother? Undo the jib. - We're going sailing. - Sailing? He's cute. Hey, look, I'm walking! Mike, over here. Douglas! I can't watch the news, a ball game, can't even watch a movie. All I hear is that kid and his radio going ""breaker, breaker"". I'll try but it's under federal jurisdiction. Call the FBl. One at a time. You two talk to Polly, you come with me. - What's this about Grace Kinny? - Her bedroom window faces my son's. She's teasing him, dancing around in a towel. Dancing? Hendricks, good. Right this way. Excuse us. Come in here and check out this 908. What the hell's a 908? I never heard of a 908. 908 means get me out of there. - What's that? - Diver's camera from the cruiser. Oh, the abandoned cruiser! Rich guys from Newport, Rhode Island. If I had a $100,000 boat, I wouldn't abandon it. If you had one, there'd be an investigation. - Very funny. - It's driving my boy to distraction! - Dancing! Check out this dance. - Dance? - Can I go back up? - Take it back up. Now, back up, Mike! Mike, it's twisted. Pull it up, Mike. - Underneath you, Mike. - Drop it down now. You OK? You OK? Pull down, Mike. 'The weather continues to be warm and clear. 'Back to the 24-hour music from Plymouth, the rock of New England. ' Wait, take a break for a minute, OK? Tina... where are you going? Hey! Eddie, come on, let's go skiing. - What? - We can use my uncle's boat. We'll do it next week, OK? With you everything is next week. Terry? Terry? Terry? No! Wow! God! I can't find anyone. They must have gone to the bottom and drifted. Witnesses say there was one person in the boat and one water-skiing. 'I told you, there's nothing here. ' I want you to try dragging. For how long? The current's moving everything and it'll be dark soon. I don't care, I want you to stay on it as long as it takes. We heard a noise like a boom. Then there was this cloud of smoke. The explosion. One minute they were having a wonderful time, the next... You've no idea what could have caused it? I don't know what could have done that. - Were they off-islanders? - I don't know. Can we go now? Chief? Chief Brody, can we go, please? Yes, thank you, Tina. We've been over this a dozen times. I know, I know. - How much longer? - Until we find something. I'm cold, bored. YOU'RE bored. Holy shit! George! Jesus, this is heavy! Aw, shit. Drop it. - What is it? - Drop it. It's a power line. - Terrific - Let me untangle it. We don't want a power blackout. Let's go before we do find something. That's your third smoke already. - With coffee. - Try a donut. - I want Froot Loops. - Eat Cheerios. You eat Cheerios, I want Froot Loops. You eat Cheerios. What are you guys up to today? - I'm going sailing. - Again? - What else is there to do? - What about that job? Do I have to? He doesn't have to. It is his vacation. Where did I leave my date book? Good morning. Everybody's up early today. Something going on? Lots. This kid is 17. We've talked about him getting a job before. You're right. I wish you could spend some time with him. How can I? I've got a boat accident. I've only got three cops and a deputy in love with the police launch. And here's another one. Everybody's a boat freak? It's an island. - I'm going. - Hold it. Wait a minute. Don't go out too far if it's rough. We've had a lot of trouble. - OK. See you later. - Be careful. I'll be careful. - Tina, come back here. - Nope! - Give me my hat. - No! Come on, Tina! Come back here. I wonder why they decided to move. - Too hot in the lighthouse? - Too hot for those two?! Yuck. I called you as soon as I heard. I hear the bites are really big. - After we've looked, we'll talk. - OK. Here it is. Could you move back, please? Move back. Please just move back. Thanks. Jesus. What do you think? First things first. Tip of the snout, please. - OK. Seven and a half meters. - Seven and a half meters? Correct. - Check the bite radius. - The what? - The shape of the mouth. - Whale's mouth? - Shark's mouth. - What shark? The shark that did this. We don't know that, do we? - That's what we're here to find out. - And we will. I can't hear you if you whisper. 111 centimetres. I've had some experience with sharks. Oh, have you? Yeah. And I think a great white might have done this. - Carcharodon carcharias? - Right. What makes you think there might be one in these waters? It's obvious a big fish took a bite out of this big fish. This is a mammal, not a fish. Don't quibble! Is it a shark bite or isn't it? Possibly. But this is a killer whale. It would have to be a shark of considerable size. We know sharks are attracted by blood and thrashing about. And sound. Sound? Sound, like sonar or radar. They hone in on unusual, irregular sounds. Any rhythmic, low-frequency vibration. So there could be one around? Not necessarily. These wounds could have been inflicted out to sea. None were immediately fatal. The currents could have carried it in. - We got a hell of a tide. - Just take care of the crowd! Dad? Mr Hendricks, take this down, please. - No more sailing today, OK? - We came out in my boat. - Andy'll take it back. - I got a date. - She'll understand. - She won't. Mike, give me a break, will you? It's either a great white or another killer whale. I'd like to know which. It's impossible to tell with that body. The animal's been ashore for 12 hours and drifting for a day at least. Every nibbler in the sea's taken a bite. I know dolphins communicate. I mean, they send signals. If a shark was destroyed, could another shark come and... Sharks don't take things personally, Mr Brody. - Dad, can I... - No. Don't worry, I'll take it back and tie it up at the docks. - Bye, Mike. - I'm sorry. Bye. - I'll see you tomorrow. - I appreciate it. Thanks. Larry. Larry, wait a minute. I'm showing summer rentals, I think we have a good season going for us. Swell. But I have to talk to you alone. We're alone. We may have another shark problem. - Are you serious? - You bet I'm serious. I've got a half-eaten whale on the beach, got two persons missing. The whale's got a bite out of it this big. No one has seen a shark. Be realistic. The selectmen should know about it. It's just a feeling, but... Larry, I not only have this attack but I've got... - I've got two water-skiers... - A tragedy, but a boating accident. No fin, no sharks. A boating accident. - They're both still missing. - We have a lot of deaths that never turn up. Are they all shark victims? Maybe they are. - Bullshit. - Bullshit? Is it bullshit I got a whale with a bite in it this big? What am I? An ass? When you called me, I called Elkins and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything. So we're not going to do anything? Martin, don't press it this time. Well, I've got to get back to work. OK, Larry, but you just remember this conversation. You just remember it! Chief? Yeah. Chief? Hi. Missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you'd be here. Yeah. Christ, what a mess. You didn't miss much. Positive ID? We're pretty sure it was the woman aboard the boat. Yeah? Thank you, operator. Just keep trying. - Anything new on those two divers? - Nothing. - We should keep sightseers... - Did you look at that stuff? - No. - How about that camera? - Might be something in it. - Yeah, right. - Take it to get developed. - First thing in the morning. - Why not now? - It's too late. Christ, I'm late for dinner. I'm expecting a long distance call. Send it to the house. OK, Chief. Yes, I can hear you. Yes, I'll give him the message. Thank you. That for me? - Hi, Dad. - Hi, gang. Well, sort of. Matt Hooper. He's on a vessel in the Antarctic and won't be in radio range till spring. Yeah. I gave him a call. Martin? Martin? Yeah? You're a mess. Where were you? Over at Santos', I dragged a body out of the ocean today. Have you any idea what happened? No, we don't know. Santos thinks it might be a victim from the boat accident. Do you wanna talk about it? Just routine. OK. Hey, Mike, come here a minute. What is it? - Something for you to do tomorrow. - I kinda had plans. Sailing? Forget it. You're grounded. Beach, that's it. - Come on, Dad. - I talked to John. He's got a job till you go back to school. That's all summer. He wanted a job, now he's got one. And I want that boat out the water. - Dad, can I...? - Tomorrow night. And I mean it. Now... Everybody here? - Just about. - OK, terrific. Folks, this is the town beach. The development, naturally, has its own private access, but I wanted you to see the concession area. Take a look at the sand. It's like sugar. It's beautiful. In the summertime, at sunset, the whole beach looks incredible. It can be absolutely breathtaking. You'll find this little bandstand interesting. We take pride in this... Hello. Selling more of the good life? - Yeah. Piece of this, piece of that. - Your husband's here. - What's he doing? - His job. - Dad got you working, huh? - Yeah. - I'm helping. - Good. Do you happen to know where your dad is? He's up there. For Christ's sake. If you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody will be happy to answer them. - Can I speak to you? - Excuse me a moment. Larry, we've got some live ones. Brody's riding his tower. Oh, shit. You got it, sweetheart. Come on! - This fast enough for you? - No, faster. - Faster? - Faster! Hey, look! There's my dad. Wave to my son. Good. How do we get him down from there? Well, maybe nobody noticed. Let's get them back in the van, huh? Yeah, come on. What's that man doing way up there? What man? Oh, he's watching. You know, a lookout. For what? It's a shark tower. I saw one in Florida. He's looking for sharks. Excuse me, dear, it's an observation platform. That's our chief of police. He's just checking it. Normally, it's used for... birdwatching, weather... measurements and nature observation, that sort of thing. Excuse me. Ellen, we're running a little late. Ellen? If we all get on the bus, we could show you the country club... Out of the water! Out of the water, now! Everybody out! Get out! Get out of there! Get out! What the hell is that idiot doing? Everybody out! Get out of there! Get out! Everyone out! Out of the water! Get out of there! Get out! Get out! Get out! It's just bluefish! Bluefish! Chief, it's a school of bluefish! It's just bluefish. - Martin? - Ellen, it's all right. Let's not make it worse, come on. OK, it's all over. Let's get back to the club. It's OK. It's just... It's a false alarm. It's all right, go back. My God. Come on, let's go. It's all over. Polly, no calls now, huh? Fogarty? OK, put him on. Yeah, Phil? What pictures? You're kidding! I'll be right over. Yeah... it's the Orca. Good lens, too. Fast. 1-4, I think. - Notice the fusion... - What else have you got? Over here. I exposed some more this morning, I haven't developed 'em yet. That's it. That's the one. Speak of the devil. Martin, this is an official meeting. Good, I'm glad you're all here. Look at this. Fogarty just developed it. It's from the missing divers' camera. Seaweed? I don't know. What is it? It's underwater. That's why it's so dark. There's nothing I can see. What are you talking about? Look at this. That's a shark. Look at the outline, the mouth, the eyes. Is that what it is? Sorry, I just don't see it. Neither do I. Martin, it could be anything. Are you telling me I don't know what a shark looks like? This is nothing. Something in the lens. - Lens my ass. - Damn right it's your ass. Be reasonable. Reasonable! With him? Goddamn it, will you just listen to him? Be reasonable?! Look, Brody, you started a panic on that beach. You shot up the place. God knows who you injured. What if somebody sues us? Did you think about that? It could ruin us. Don't worry about being sued. If this is what I think it is, there won't be anybody here. - Now, let's not... - Let's not what, Larry? Larry, let's forget it. He won't listen. - It's obvious he's made up his mind. - You bet I have. I'm telling you and everybody here, that's a shark. And I know because I've seen one up close. And you better do something because I won't go through that hell again. Martin, could you wait here for a minute? For what? Please, just have a seat, while we look at the picture and make up our own minds. All right. I'll have a seat. For what it's worth. Thank you. Gentlemen, please. Yeah! Hey, Mike. I saw your dad over at Town Hall. I know. Did he really freak out on the town beach? I don't know. Don't worry about them. It's all bullshit. Hey, you know this is the only place where the garbage man delivers? Ha ha ha - Anyone wanna go to the lighthouse? - Now? Tomorrow. Maybe spend the day. My dad left some cases of beer in the garage. - Is it still there? - It's kinda vacationing on my boat! Mike, are you going to go? - Yeah, why not? - You might be painting toilets! Very funny - Are we going to have a picnic? - Yeah, you bring the food. - Mike? - Hi. I'd like to go to the lighthouse with you. I'm not sure I can go. I'm grounded. Dad won't let me use my boat. Do you always do what your parents tell you to? - No. - Good. I'll be at the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody. I don't know what I'd do. Hey! What is this? A wake for a funeral? - You surprised us. - I came as soon as I heard. They only fired me, they didn't bury me. - Hello, baby, I'm home. - I know. I know you know. Listen, I've got something for you. This will look better on you than me because you're a snappier dresser. Oh, hey! You're drinking the good stuff. How about a toast? A toast to the new chief. Come on, the chief's going to need all the luck he can get. No? OK, we'll do it together. A toast to the new chief. Hail to the chief. Come on, drink! This is a milestone in your career. - Ease up, Martin. - Look, Chief, not only don't I want your job, but I came to tell you I think you're the greatest. - And I... - Oh, Jeff, it's OK. Come on. It's not your fault, I know that. Well, I got to go anyway. Thanks for coming by, Jeff. - You've been a big help. - Thank you. - Good night, Jeff. - Good night. Poor Hendricks. They'll fire his ass, too. You'll see. I showed them a picture of that shark. They didn't see it. They see only what they want to see. But it's out there, all right. - It's a big mother, too. - Is that why they fired you? It wasn't just that. What was it? The beach? I saw what happened. Oh, I blew it. I blew it. I shot off my mouth. I shot off my gun. Four years down the drain. Shot to hell. What a dummy. What else? What else? I've never been fired before. You know that? I mean, once when I was 17, when I was a kid, yeah. But... never from a real job. Nobody ever told me I couldn't hack it. They're not saying that. Yes, they are. They are. Maybe they're right. I'm tired. Tired. I'm too damn tired. Too damn drunk. That's what you are, too damn drunk. - Are you going out? - Yeah. Going sailing? - Maybe. - Take me. No! - I wanna go with you. - Shh! Quiet! Michael. All right. Come on. But be quiet! Hello, Denise, love of my life. If you're grounded, what are we doing? Practice? Yeah, practice. Why are we here and not the beach? We can fool around, pick up some girls. If you're gonna get in the way, go home. I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way? You're always in the way. Is he causing trouble? Put me down! - You can go out in my boat. - Yeah! You want him? You can have him. I think you just made somebody very happy. - Hi guys. - Hi. - Mike, you going out? - I thought you were grounded. - I can go out if I want to. - He can. Is there enough room for all of us on the boat? - I don't know, we're... - There's plenty of room. I guess so. Brooke? I've got room. Great! - You'll go with me? - Sure. Thanks guys, but I'm going with Timmy. Come on. Fantastic! - It's a big mistake. - Don't worry. Come on, you guys, I'm ready. You said she was coming with us. Well, obviously, she's not. - You wanna talk about it? - You wanna swim home? - Hey, Tom! - Nicholas! You should be in class. I've got company! - I'm going for lobster. - Great! Bring me one! - I want mine with butter. - Got that, Tom? So long, turkeys. Sparky will take you down today. If you're ready, let's buddy-up and drop. Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us in. Let's get him in and keep him warm. Put him in the forward cabin. He'll be OK. Things'll be OK. Let's go. Thank you. So? So, I'll go down to the office, clean out the desk, turn in the truck, and maybe get shitfaced and rap your boss in the mouth. I better give notice. Take it easy. We may need the income. Mike's gone. He's making out early these days, must be a morning man. Like his father. Good morning. Anything special today? No. Sean's out somewhere. Let him have whatever he wants. - Just keep him away from the candy. - OK. - Do I still get my ride? - Mmm. Call your brother, the plumber, that sink upstairs is screwed up. Frankie? He's my cousin. Ask if he can use an apprentice. Have a nice day. Do you want to just leave her pointing up? I'm on it. There we go. Yeah, this is fine. What about sailing? What about it? Don't you worry. We're gonna make it. We'll make it to Budapest if you're not careful! Hey, what about the others? What about them? They'll be there when we get there. They'll have their bonfire, clams, liquor... Yeah? What are we gonna do in the meantime? Well, in the meantime, we'll have to think of something. Wait a minute. What? Get out the blanket. I got black marks all over my butt and mom's getting uptight about it. OK. Out with the blanket. You really need a blanket? I don't need one! Well... here's your blanket. Eddie! Help! Eddie! - Tina! - Help me! Tina! Oh... Jesus. Eddie, swim! Swim fast, it's a shark, Eddie. Swim! Oh, God. Eddie, swim! Swim faster! Hurry! Come on! Swim! Hurry, Eddie. It's a shark! Eddie, hurry! Faster! Come on. Swim! Hurry! Hurry, Eddie. Eddie! Tina... Oh, Mama... Please make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away. Honey, it's not your job any more. I just wanna look. Come on, get out of there! Come on. - What happened to him? - Embolism. Air bubbles in the blood. He came up too fast, Chief. Something must have scared him. He just panicked. Don't worry, we're taking good care of him. How did this happen? Bite reflex, like a spasm. It happened after the kids went out. What kids? Junior Vaughan, Brookie Peters, Jackie, Mike... Our Mike? They're headed for the lighthouse. Hey! Look, Chief, you're not chief now. I can't let you take her out. Mrs Brody, look, you can't go. Neither one of you can go. - Get that line. - Mike is out there. But I signed for the boat. Mrs Brody, please. Shit! Chief, go on up to the bow, you're doing that wrong. Go ahead, untie the bowline. They can't fire both of us, right? Somebody's got to be in charge. All right, which direction do you wanna go? You said something about a lighthouse. All right. Amity Launch to Harbour Patrol. 'This is Harbour Patrol. ' Listen, do you think you can raise me a chopper? 'Is that you Brody? Not right away. 'It's out checking a buoy. ' Get it out to the lighthouse. There's some kids sailing out there. I want them back in port. 'Affirmative. Turn the kids back to port. 'I heard you. Patrol out. ' Brody out. Hurry up, suckers, you're dragging! Hey, let's go past the lighthouse. I know a better spot. Come about. You got it! I got it, Chief. It's all right. Come on. It's OK. It's all right. No. No. Ellen. No, no. Tina, Tina... Tina, it's OK. - It's still there. - What is? What's still there? Sh-sh-sh-sh... Shark! It's still there. That boat will take you in. Where the hell are they? Ten degrees off your starboard. Take a heading... Not that shit! Point! There. All right, I got it. Mr Christian! Mr Christian! Pump up this boat! And shave off that dreadful moustache. England expects every man to do his duty. Fire when ready! Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead! This will be our finest hour. Oh, shit. Hey, Bligh, someone pop your balloon? No problem, no problem. Balance the boat! Watch out! Do something! Timmy! Brooke! Hey! Look out. Where is it? - Get me out of here! - I'll get you out. Larry! Larry! Turn! Turn! It's OK. - Hurry up! - Mike's out there. Out of the water. Somebody look out for Mike! Hang on to something! Mike, get out of there! Hold on! Oh, my God. Mike! Brody! That's it. - Get his arm. - Come on. Pull his jacket! Get him clear, it's coming up. Come on! Come on! Shit! He's bleeding pretty bad. We got to get Mike to a doctor. Can you sail? Yeah. We'll take him in. OK. Get some help here fast. Let's go. Let's wrap this mess up. Throw this to Brooke. Brooke, get this and throw it to Mark. Here, take it. Tie a bowline around your mast. Easy. Come on, pull. I don't know if it'll hold. All right. Someone put a fender up. We could use another hand on this. Take it easy. Just pull. Tie it off. All right. Amity Launch to Air Patrol One. Amity Launch to Air Patrol One. Do you read me? 'This is Air Patrol. That you, Brody?' Yeah. Do you have a fix on those kids? 'Negative. I'm still down. ' Get the hell up because I'm out here alone. 'Brody, I got to switch frequencies. 'Call my boss. I'll meet you by Francis Shoal. Out. ' Francis Shoal? Where the hell is Francis Shoal? Shit. I'm all alone out here. Anyone want to play charades? No. All we have to do is land at Cable Junction and wait. How will we do that on this garbage? What's after Cable Junction? The Atlantic. Then Ireland. God, I'm hungry. Air Patrol to Base. I have a positive location on that sailing party. Disabled and adrift, about three quarters of a mile west of Cable Junction, wind and tide carrying them due east. Is everyone OK? Is anybody hurt? No! I'll tow you to Cable Junction, then call the Coast Guard. Throw me a line. Take it easy. Here we go. - Oh, what a day - Here you go! OK. - Now, hold on to something. - OK. - Hurry up! - Better hang on. Sean. - Sean! - Sean! Sean! Sean! Get him in the boat. - Sean! - Come on! Get aboard. - Hurry! - Come on. Come on. I can't get up. No! No! Take her to the hospital and meet me at the office. Try to understand my position... Tina will be all right. Are you OK? Ellen, I'm sorry. Believe me, I'm sorry. I was only thinking of... I don't give a damn what you think. A boy is dead and my son and husband are still out there. Amity Launch to Harbour Patrol. Amity Launch to Harbour... Damn it! Sean, catch the rope! - Come on, the rope! - Sean! Sean, catch the rope! Sean, the rope! - Come on, Sean! - Come on, Sean! Come on! Sean! Sean, catch the rope! The rope, Sean! Come on, Sean! Come on! You've gotta help or it won't work. Will you stop? Come on, Sean, wake up! Pick it up! Sean! Sean, goddamn it. Sean, listen to me or I'll break your ass! OK, come on. OK, Sean, now listen. We'll throw you this rope and you better catch it. Sean, you ready? Here it comes, kid. Get it, Sean. Sean, get it. Come on, get it. Good. Now tie it around the centreboard. Tie it tight. You ready? Hang on. Hold on. Hang on, OK? Here we go. Hold on tight. OK, kid. Take it easy. Come on. OK. - Get him out! - Come on. Oh, God. Are you OK, kid? I thought we lost you. Cable Junction's ahead. - Can we make it? - I don't know. - Hey, I was just asking! - I know. How's she doing? Just got to keep her warm. Somebody help me and we could steer this. What are you playing with a tube for? - If everyone... - Shut up! I'm sorry but I can't stop thinking about this! Well, you better try! Oh, God, please help. Jesus... Holy Mary, Mother of Christ, please help us. Please help us. We're begging. Please save us. Oh, thank Christ. Here, take that back to the cleat. - What happened? - I'm OK. - Sure? - A shark hit us. Sean's out there. - What? - He wanted to come. Where are they? They're in the current heading for Cable Junction. All right, get to the lighthouse and stay there, OK? - Stay there. - I'm sorry, Dad. Forget it. Just get to the lighthouse. - We're almost there. - It's not gonna work. Come on, more to port. Keep it going. We'll make it. More to port, goddamn it! All the way over. Larry, are we going to make it to the island? We're steering for it, kid. But the wind drift is lateral. What does that mean? It means that we're going sideways. We're going that way. - We were heading right for it. - Not now. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Wait! Stop paddling. - What about the island? - The shark! - What's happening? - I think we're stuck. It's just the bottom. - It's that thing. - It's just the bottom. No, it's not the bottom. It's that thing! It's gonna kill us! Jackie, shut up! - No! It's going to kill us! - Shut up! Shut up! Leave her alone! Then you take care of her. - She's hysterical, beating... - Sit down. Be quiet! Shut up! Listen! - She shouldn't freak out. - Listen! You hear it? Over there! It's coming towards us. It's Dad! Dad! Dad! Oh, cool. Cool, come on... Pull yourselves over and we'll get out of here. We can't. We're stuck on the bottom here. I'll get you closer. We'll come aboard. - Pull us alongside. - Please hurry! All right, hold it steady. Oh, sh...! Wait! Dad! I'm all right. Hold on. All right, take this and I'll get you over. - All right, tie it on. - OK. All right, pull these hooks over with the rope. Secure them to the raft then I'll pull you back with the winch, OK? OK. All right, pull it over. It's stuck. Wait a minute, I'll put... I'll put it in reverse. Lucy! Lucy, look out! Oh, my God! No! No! Lucy! No! Oh, my God! No! Dad! Hold on! Dad! Get away! No! Get away! No! Sean! - Where'd he go? - Where is he? - There he is! - Over there. What the hell are you doing? Get out of there! He's heading right for you! All right, you big bastard, come on. I got something for you now. That's it! That a boy! Come on! Right over here! Dad! That's it. Come on. No! Get out of the way! Don't do it! Get away! Get away! Dad! Watch out! Come on! Look out! Open wide! Open wide, say ""ah""! He did it. He got it! He did it! He did it! He did it! Did he get it? It's dead? It's dead! Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you... - And you... - They made me go with them. Sure they did!, Are we the first? Are we the first to arrive here? Is the interpreter with you? I'm not a professional interpreter. My occupation is cartography. I'm a mapmaker. Can you translate French into English and English into French? Yes, I explained to the team leader in Villa Hermosa. I'm just a little taken by surprise. They're all there! All of them! Check for landing marks! Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers off the engine blocks! M-447148! W-445529! Number 445529, check! Approximately 46 gallons in the right tank! 447149, check! Tell me something. What's happening here? - It's flight number 19! - 19 what? It's that training mission from the naval air station at Fort Lauderdale. They were doing target runs on an old hulk. Who flies crates like these anymore? No one! These planes were reported missing in 1945. But it looks brand-new! Where's the pilot? I don't understand! Where's the crew? Hey! How the hell did it get here?! He says this guy's local. He was here last night. He saw it happen. Sunburn? He says the sun came out last night. He says it sang to him. Harry, keep an eye on that point-out. He's on 122.5. I'll be right back. Indianapolis Center, you have any traffic for Air East 31? Air East 31, negative. The only traffic I have is a TWA L-1011 in your 6 o'clock position... ...range 15 miles... ...and an Allegheny DC-9 in your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles. Stand by. I'll take a look at broadband, over. Air East 31 has traffic 2 o'clock, slightly above and descending. Air East 31, roger. I have a primary target about that position now. I have no known traffic. Stand by, I'll check low, over. Check and see if they know who it is. Center, Air East 31. The traffic's not lower than us. He's 1 o'clock now, still above me and descending. Air East 31, can you say aircraft type? Negative, Center, no distinct outline. To tell you the truth, the target is rather brilliant. It has the brightest anti-collision lights I think I've ever seen. Alternating white to red. The colours are striking. Center, this is TWA 517. Traffic now looks lik e extra-bright landing lights. I thought Air East had his landing lights on. It could be a satellite. I have a primary target now in your 10 o'clock position... ...five miles, over. - Never seen anything like that. - Affirmative, 31. The traffic is proceeding northeast. No altitude readout. Roger, Center. It doesn't appear he'll be a problem. He's going to descend about 1500 feet below me. Wait a second! Stand by one. Okay, Center, Air East 31. The traffic has turned. He's heading for my windshield. We're turning immediately. Air East 31, descend and maintain flight level 310. Break Allegheny, turn right 30 degrees. Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing and see what they're testing up there. Do you have test operations in restricted area 2508? Air East 31, roger. The traffic is luminous and exhibiting non-ballistic motion. Roger. Continue descent at your discretion. Okay, Center. Descent at pilot's discretion is approved. The traffic is approaching head-on, ultra-bright and really moving. And right by us! Right now! Now, that was really close. Air East 31 is out of 340... Ask if they want to report officially. TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO? Over. TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO? Over. Negative. We don't want to report. Air East 31, do you wish to report a UFO? Over. Negative. We don't want to report one either. Air East 31, do you wish to file a report of any kind? Over. I wouldn't know what kind of report to file, Center. Air East 31, me neither. I'll try to track traffic to destination, over. - What are you doing? - I'm just... What? Barry? Honey? Honey? Barry! Barry. Barry! Dad, do my problems for me. I don't have to do your problems for you. You do your problems for you. That's why I graduated, so I don't have to do problems. I don't understand these fractions. All right. What's one-third of 60? That's a fraction. I don't understand them. All right, look. Let's say... ...that this boxcar is 60 feet long. And one-third is across this switch here. All right? Okay? And now another train is coming. How far do you have to move this boxcar off the track... ...so that the other train doesn't smash it? Quickly, Brad, there are thousands of lives at stake. Brad, any answer. Remember last weekend... ...you promised everybody a movie this weekend? Honey? - And you also promised Goofy Golf. - Oh, yeah. Roy, what is all this stuff on my table? I thought I told you this was for my stuff. I mean, you can have that table. I don't want this on my table. This can cause tetanus! - What is this?! - You know what's playing? Pinocchio! The kids have never seen Pinocchio. You guys have never seen it. You'll love it. I don't believe this. Who wants to go see some dumb cartoon rated G for kids? - How old are you? - Eight. - You wanna be 9? - Yeah. Then you're gonna see Pinocchio tomorrow night. That's a wonderful way to win over your children. I'm not serious. I'm just saying that I grew up with Pinocchio. And if kids are still kids, they're gonna eat it up. Okay. Okay, I'm wrong. I'm Wrong Roy, all right? Toby! You are close to death! Come out here! Okay, now, I'll give you your choice. I'm not gonna be biased in any way. You can either play Goofy Golf, which means a lot of waiting and pushing... ...or you can see Pinocchio... ...which is a lot of furry animals and magic and a wonderful time. Okay? - Now, let's vote. - Golf! All right, everybody to bed! No way! Dad said we could finish watching The Ten Commandments! Roy, that movie is four hours long. I told them they'd watch only five commandments. - Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl. - Hi, Earl. We got a big problem. I need your old man in the field. Roy can't drive at night without me. We're experiencing an overall outage. Wait, wait, wait, I can't... Hey, honey. Jiminy Cricket! It's Earl on the phone. Just a second. - Hello. - Neary. Get into your truck and report to line N in Tolono. We're losing power across the grid. Has the outage hit you yet? Neary? Neary? Neary? Hey! Lights! Barry! Barry! Help! I'm lost. You're gonna cough up a little Tolono, right? Cough up a Tolono or an interstate, a Highway 90. A little familiar landmark of some sort. - Cornbread Road, south of 20. - Cornbread? Power must have been restored. Couple hundred neighbours think it's Saturday night. Dispatch, this is 411. Do you want me to disregard that Tolono call? You're in the middle of the road, jackass! Can you tell me where Cornbread is? Turkey! A-34... A-34... F-27. M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-12. Okay. Ten-47. All right. Stoppage in the single circuits will lead you right to nowhere. M-Mary-10. Unit 211, 10-30, five, sev... Oh, shit. Unit 211, I'm back up on the street. What do you guys got out there? I don't believe this! My God! It's bigger than a house! This thing is lik e a barn. This is absolutely crazy. What is your location? Just off the Telemark Expressway and east toward Harper Valley. Barry. No! Watch out! Oh, my God! Lady! Lady! Are you okay? I'm sorry. I didn't see him. He was in the middle of the road. - Hello? - Oh, my God. - Hello! Here! - What's the matter with you? Barry, come back here! Come on, now. Ice cream! This is nuts. No. Wait a minute! What are you guys doing? Hey! That's Ohio! That's a quarter! Jesus, look at those suckers. They're glued to the road! Honey, wake up! Ronnie, wake up! You're not gonna believe what I saw! Don't! Not now. No, listen! I never would have believed it! There was this... In the cab there was this whole... It went... It was... There was a red whoosh that... Roy. Ike called you. And McGovern. They want you to call. They couldn't reach you. I turned the radio off. Don't do that. The phone rang off the hook. It woke Sylvia up two times already. You'd better call them. You know those pictures in National Geographic, the aurora borealis? This is better than that. This is really... Come on! Come on, Ronnie, get up. Come on. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I don't know. - Get up! I'm not kidding. - Is it an accident? It's not an accident. You wanted to get out of the house, right? Not at 4:00 in the morning. Ronnie, I need you to see something with me. It's really important. Okay. All right. What about the kids? What? Oh, the kids! I'll get the kids. Sylvia, we're going on an adventure. Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up. It's better than Goofy Golf! I'm going as fast as I can! Come on. All right, all right. Oh, hi, Mrs. Harris. Roy, there's Mrs. Harris. There better be a good reason for this because it doesn't make any sense. All right, Roy, I really think you've proved your point. Roy. Roy. Roy, you're sunburned. Look at you. Honey, what is that? Roy, what did it look like? It was like an ice-cream cone. What flavour? Orange. It was orange. It wasn't like an ice-cream cone. It was more like a shell. You know, like this: Like a taco? Was it like one of those Sara Lee moon-shaped cookies? Those crescent cookies? Don't you think I'm taking this really well? I remember coming to places like this just to look at each other. Snuggle. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. It's the Cotopaxi. - Why is it here? - Beats the shit out of me. Is this the bathroom? Hey, this is not your toy to play with every time I turn around. He looks like a 50l50 Bar. All right, out of this house. All of you. Out of my house. I'm sorry, but you're not to play with this! Get out while I clean up your mess! Thank you very much. Roy, I found this overnight-tanning stuff. I want you to spray it on half your face, so it's all one colour. It makes my face look yellow. What does this remind you of? Then we'll tell everybody you fell asleep... ...under the sun lamp on your right side. What for? - Dad, can I ask you a question? - What? Are they for real? That's what for. No, they are not for real. Go outside and have a hot dog, okay? Ronnie, don't tell him that. Roy, look, don't talk about this until you know what you're talking about. If I can't talk about it, how will I know what's going on? - What? - Mom, I believe in them. - I believe in them too. - Oh, no, you don't. Dad says we do. No, he does not. - Do you, Roy? - Ronnie. All I wanna do is know what's going on. Nothing's going on! It's just one of those things. Which things? Which things? - I don't wanna hear about this. - This is very important! I won't let it lay here. I'm gonna call somebody! I'm not listening. I'm not listening. I saw something last night that I can't explain. I saw something last night I can't explain. I'm going out there again tonight. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. No, you're not. Do they live on the moon? They got bases there so at night they can come through your window. This isn't a moonburn, goddamn it! - You came through my window. - You hurt me! - You took all my covers. - Roy's not like that. He loves his work. Don't say that! What did he do? He was with us all night! I won't have to go tonight. He is not like that at all! Stop yelling at me! Can't you tell him about this? Hello? I can't believe it. Roy... ...you got fired. They didn't even wanna talk to you. Where were the sounds coming from? Where did these sounds come from? Tell us, please. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I beg your pardon, but my English is not good too. I want to share with you now... ...the breakthrough that happened in India. We think it means something. We think it is important. To help you learn, I am using the hand sign created by Zoltn Kodly. Kodly developed these signs to teach music to deaf children. Hello? Hi. Hi, how are you? You came here too? Yes. Jillian Guiler. Roy Neary. Sorry about what happened. - Good night! - What? Look at you. You got the same burn. Yeah, but it's better on you. You got it all over at least. I gotta tan the other side tonight. How's the kid? I'm really sorry. I'll be right back. Raise your head a bit and give me a smile. Come on. He's a little young for a record, don't you think? Weird. I know this sounds crazy, but ever since yesterday on the road... ...l've been seeing this shape. In shaving cream and pillows... Damn it, I know this! I know what this is. This means something. This is important. - Here they come! - Get the camera! - Out of the northwest! - Jimmy, come here. It's like Halloween for grownups. Trick or treat. Wait a minute! Here are the patterns. - We received two 15-minute broadcasts. - Non-random signals? 104 rapid pulses. After a five-second interval, 40 pulses. Another five-second break, and 30 pulses. Silence, then a new set of numbers. 40, break five. 36, break five. Ten. - 104 rapid pulses. - Lord! Wait 60 seconds and the whole doggone thing repeats. - Where are the signals from? - The neighbourhood. Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds. Well within the plane of the ecliptic. Are these non-random signals here, 40, 36, 10, in response to that? No. They should be. We've sent this combination out for weeks. But all we're getting back are numbers. This could mean the India sounds reached a dead end. They don't mean a thing. There's so much we don't know. How about where the signals originate? Excuse me. What letter is 104? Excuse me. Before I got paid to speak French... ...I used to read maps. This first number is a longitude. I've got two sets of three numbers. Degrees, minutes and seconds. The first number has three digits, and the last two are below 60. It's not in the right ascension and declination on the sky. These have to be Earth coordinates. There's a globe in the office. This is what we need. Maybe there's a release pin underneath here. That's a $2500 globe! What are you doing? - It's heavy, watch your feet. - Let me hit the mother. All right, everybody, quiet down! Hold it down! Quiet! That's not right. The antenna. How dumb! - Which way's it pointing? - Northeast. That's Wyoming. We'll need a geodetic survey map of Wyoming. I want it to the square yard. The Army has a geodetic survey map of Wyoming. We not only need... Toys! Toys! Oh, my God! You can come and play now. You can come and play now. Come in through the door. One, two, three... Oh, honey. Mom, look! The sun's here! Oh, honey. Oh, my God! Go away! Clean everything up! - Mom, let me listen! - Wait a minute! Wait. - Mom, look! - Oh, my God. Come in through the door. Barry! Barry! Jillian. Jillian. May we have a statement? The report you gave to the police was spectacular. We need it for the 6:00 news. They got him. What? Is it true you're leaving to look for your son? - Has there been a ransom note? - Where will you start looking? His name is Barry. Where is your husband now, Mrs. Guiler? Are you involved in any kind of parapsychologies? Turn around, please. Turn around! You gave the police a report. Would you mind repeating it? Folks, you can go in now. Room 3655. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a flying saucer. That's the one I saw! I swear that's the same one! It's the one I saw! It's made of pewter, made in Japan... ...and thrown across the lawn by one of my children. I wanted to point out that we're not all ""polished brass"" about this. And also point out that last year... ...Americans shot more than seven billion photographs... ...at a record of $6.6 billion for film equipment and processing. Now, with all those shutters clicking... ...where is the indisputable photographic evidence? I've been in the news business for a long time. We never took a picture of a plane crash as it happened... ...or an automobile accident and get it on the 6:00 news. There are lots of ideas that would be fun to believe in. Mental telepathy... ...time travel... ...immortality... ...even Santa Claus. I know it's no fun to go home and say, ""Guess what happened today? I was in the shopping centre, and there was this bright light... ...and I rushed outside... ...and it was an aeroplane."" Excuse me, sir. I didn't want to see this. I sure wish I had. For 15 years I've been looking... ...for these damn silly lights in the night sky. I've never found any. I'd like to, because I believe in life elsewhere. Why don't you admit... ...that the Air Force is conducting tests in the Foothills area? It would be easy to say yes to that. But I'm not going to mislead you. This is not the case. I don't know what you saw. You can't fool us by agreeing with us. No, come on! I saw Bigfoot once. 1951. Back in Sequoia National Park. Had a foot on her, 37 inches. Heel to toe. Made a sound I would not want to hear twice in my life. I believe I've encountered that gentleman myself. I was sitting on the porch, looking through the screen. I seen this big white dot in the sky. It turned red and blue and green. UFOs do not represent a direct physical threat to national security. We do not support them, and we encourage you not to. Let's get in touch with the forest service... ...or we'll end up in a wilderness area with vehicular traffic. And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff for those folks in Wyoming. If this mission fully develops... ...I get white knuckles thinking about what might be ahead for those folks. Your flight will be at 2000 hours. We have a limo that'll take you to the heliport now. And transportation will be provided on the other end. - I like the flash-flood idea. - Where do you get the water? We've had about two inches of rain... We'll tell them one of the reservoirs is gonna burst. Besides, there's not enough water in those reservoirs! Wait! Contaminated water affects people, crops, animals. Disease. - Yeah, epidemic. - What kind of disease? A plague epidemic. Nobody will believe a plague. - Anthrax. - Ranching country. There are a lot of sheep in the hills. Good, I like that. - It'll create a panic. - But it may not evacuate everybody. There's always some joker who thinks he's immune. I need something so scary it'll clear 300 square miles... ...of every living Christian soul. Help yourself. I hate these potatoes. There's a dead fly in my potatoes. It's okay. Well, I guess you've noticed... ...something is a little strange with Dad. It's okay, though. I'm still Dad. I can't describe it, what I'm feeling... ...and what I'm thinking. This means something. This is important. That's not right. It's not right. That's not right. What is it? What is it?! It's not fair. Tell me. Roy? Roy. Open the door, please. Please. Roy. Roy! Open this door! Open this door! All right. I don't think I know what's happening to me. Look, Roy. What it is, is family therapy. I mean, we all go. We all talk. No one is singled out. Maybe it's not your fault anyway. - It's waterproof. It still works. - Roy! Promise me you'll go! You crybaby! You crybaby! - You crybaby! - Get out of here! Get out! Come on, you guys. Come on. You crybaby! - Be quiet! - Stop it! I don't understand it! - Neither do I. - Get out! Go to your room and close the door. - Ronnie? - Yes. I'm really scared. I want you to help me. All this bullshit! It's turning this house upside down! - Ronnie, just... - I just hate you! That's why! - No! - Ronnie. Ronnie. Hold me. Put your arms around me. It'll really help me. It'll really help me. Listen! Listen! Don't you see what's happening? None of our friends call us anymore! You're out of work! You don't care! You're wrecking us! You're ruining us! - Ronnie, just hold on. - No! No! - Hold on. - No! Ronnie. Ronnie? Ronnie, open the door now. Come on. Well, what do you know? It's disintegrated. Happy birthday, you thing from another world, you. Thank you! Well, I guess he's had enough. Are you going to yell at me? Ronnie? Everything's fine. All this stuff is coming down. It's all gonna be like it was. That's the last straw! Now I use my secret weapon! Roy? Roy, I'm sorry about last night. Roy! Roy, what are you doing? Jesus! The plants are fine there! Can you hear me? Wait! Wait! What are you doing? You're gonna love it! - What do you mean? - You'll really love this. Roy, what are you doing? Oh, Roy! My God! Come on, men! Dad, after this, can we throw dirt in my window? Stop it. Stop. Stop it. Honey! If I don't do this, that's when I'm gonna need a doctor. What are you doing? - I got it. - What are you doing? I figured it out, that's all. Will you just listen? You ever look at something crazy, and then see it another way and it's not? No, I haven't. Come on, Ronnie. Just listen. - I don't know what you're doing. - Close your eyes. Close your eyes and hold your breath, everything will be really pretty. You're scaring us now. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. I feel really good. Everything's gonna be all right. I haven't felt this good in years. Everything's gonna be okay. I can feel it. - Now what else? What else? - Like this? Like this? Right. Like this? Chicken wire. Whatever you're doing, it's against the law! He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris. I'll pay you for this. Take it. Take it. I'm perfectly fine. Let go of this fence. Come with me. Do you want me to hit you? Let go of that fence! Toby! Listen to me. Listen to me. Come on, right now. We're going. - I want to stay here! - Let go of the fence! Come on. Stay! Stay! - Where we going? - Where we going? - Where are we going? - Get in the car. - Where are we going? - Quietly, quickly, get in. Get in there, Toby. Quickly. - Dad needs some more help! - Lock the doors! Dad needs some more help! Quiet! Just lock the doors. Roll up those windows. Dad needs some more help! Honey, where you going? - What? - Where are you going? Taking the kids to my sister's. That's crazy. You're not even dressed. What? You said what? Ronnie, wait! Ronnie, hold it. Would you hold it one minute? Morning. What is wrong with me today? Who is it, please? It's the mailman. There's a package for Julie Anderson. You can just leave it at the door! I can't do that. I'm supposed to C. O.D. Lik e that. And besides... ...you and I have to have a little talk... ...about Kim. Lik e sands through the hourglass... ...so are the Days of Our Lives. Good evening. At the top of the news tonight, a rail disaster. At Devil's Tower, Wyoming... ...a trainload of dangerous chemical gas went off the rails... ...and forced the widest area evacuation... ...in the history of these controversial Army rail shipments. Whenever you want me to. Tomorrow is fine. I can do other things. I'm trying to be. Yes, I am. The Army and National Guard are supervising the evacuation. I am an adult, okay? Even though there's no such thing. It was a joke! - The danger will be over within 72 hours. Ronnie, anything you want. Anything you want, I'll do. For how long? All of you? No. Ronnie, I wanna talk about this in person. This is not... We can't talk about this on the telephone. Ronnie! Don't hang up! Just don't... - meat should remain unaffected. This means order your steak well-done. Devil's Tower, Wyoming was the first national monument... ...erected in this country by Theodore Roosevelt in 1915. Thousands of civilian refugees are fleeing the area... ...spurred by rumours that the overturned tank er cars... ...at Walkashi Needles Junction were filled to capacity with nerve gas. In a few minutes, we're going to be... - boasts 400, 000 vacationers. Fortunately, during this mishap there have been no fatalities. - Evacuate this area, which soon... ...will become the ""hot zone,"" depending on the prevailing winds. This is as close to the disaster as we've been allowed to get. - Due to a strong prevailing north-south wind. Army engineers and the Wyoming National Guard... ...are making every effort to contain the leaking toxins... ...and evacuate an area of almost 200 square miles. Everyone is being warned: Stay out of the area. Everyone, please, stay out of the area. - And thousands of others are homeless. U.S. Army Materiel Command has issued these new area restrictions: All roadways north of Crowheart on Interstate 25. Shit. All roads leading into the Grand Tetons west of Meteste. All multilane undivided full-traffic interchange... ...railroad, local and historic stage roads south of Cody. Why aren't there fat lines instead of these thin ones? Yo! - Holy mother of... - You're going the wrong way! Yo! Turn back around. Back this way. What's the matter with you? Yes, sir. Sorry, officer. It's just a rental, officer. Just a rental. My fault! My fault! Starting with the letter ""F,"" as in ""Frank""... ...to the letter ""J"" as in ""Jack""... ...please find your way to the loading platform for immediate boarding. You'll be real disappointed and sorry... ...if you don't have an early-warning system, such as a bird, a gas mask. Why, even my dog has a gas mask. And any of you folks are worth more than a dog. Roy? Roy! Roy! Roy? Roy? Roy! Roy. Roy! I don't care where you go, just get behind the barricade! There's no way out! What are we doing? Only way to get back is cross-country. We'll break through the fence. - Let's go. - All right, hold on. Hold on. The police dragged the river for him. I told them he wasn't in the river. He wasn't. Then they went around to every house within five miles... ...looking inside back-yard refrigerators. They asked if I'd seen any strangers in the neighbourhood. I don't believe it's real. I don't believe it's real. It's real. Let's get down there. Get some gas and get down in there. What are those? Look, I guarantee you. This whole thing is a put-on. What do you want? Get your hands off! - How are you feeling? - I feel fine! According to my birds, the only bad air is from you guys farting around! - Move them out! - What's happening? - What? Where are we going? - Go to the van. Where are you taking her? Hold it! Why can't we go together? Watch your step. Roy. We have very little time, Mr. Neary. This is Mr. Lacombe. - Hello. - We need answers from you... ...that are honest, direct and to the point. Where is Jillian? Do you realise the danger you and your friend have risked? In coming here, you've exposed yourself to toxic gas. Well, I'm alive. We're talking. This is true, Mr. Neary. But if the wind blew from the south instead of the north... ...this conversation would not be taking place. There's nothing wrong with the air. What makes you say that? I just know. There's nothing wrong with it. Go outside and make me a liar. I wanna talk to the man in charge. Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority. He isn't even an American. Mr. Neary, are you an artist or a painter? No. Have you been hearing a persistent ringing in your ears? Almost an agreeable ringing? No. Having headaches, migraines? Yeah. An irritation in your eyes and your sinuses? Yeah. Do you have hives? Do you have allergies? And burning on your face and on your body? - Yes. Who are you people? - Look at this. I got one like it in my living room. Who are you people? Monsieur Neary, please, one more question. Have you recently had a close encounter? A close encounter with something very unusual? Who are you people? - These people strangers to you? - Yeah. Except for her. And the two of you felt compelled to be here? Yeah, you might say that. - But what did you expect to find? - An answer. That's not crazy, is it? Hold it, hold it, hold it. Is that it? Is that all you're gonna ask me? Well, I got a couple of thousand goddamn questions. I wanna speak to someone in charge. I wanna lodge a complaint. You have no right to make people crazy. You think I investigate every Walter Cronkite story there is? If this is just nerve gas, how come I know everything in such detail? I've never been here before. How come I know so much? What the hell is going on around here?! Who the hell are you people?! Is that it?! Answer me! I didn't come this far to get taken on any bus ride home! Five minutes. Five! We're gonna hold for a couple of minutes. You brought 12 people to the decontamination camp... ...instead of the evacuation centre where they belong. Why? - Because this means something. - This means something. These people have come from all over their country... ...to a place they've been told will endanger their lives. Why? Because somebody could be trying to subvert this whole operation... ...by sending in fanatics, cultists and Christ knows what all. Yes. Thank you very much. This is a small group of people... ...who have shared a vision in common. Look. It's still a mystery to me why they are here. Even they do not know why. Jillian! - Jillian. - Don't! You'll be poisoned! Listen, there's nothing wrong with the air around here. The Army's getting us out because they don't want any witnesses. If the Army doesn't want us here, it's none of our business. We wanted to see the mountain. It was a coincidence when I painted it. You can take it off! The air here is better than in Los Angeles. Listen. How many of you people are for getting out of here? I don't know what's happening either. I must find out what's going on. For every one of these anxious, anguished people who've come here... ...there must be hundreds more touched by the vision who never made it here. Simply because they never watch the television. Or perhaps they watched it, but never made the psychic connection. It's a coincidence. It's not scientific. Listen to me, Major Walsh... ...it is an event sociological. Hey! Wait a minute! - My name's Neary! - Larry Butler! - How are you? - Okay! You? - Fine, fine! - That's good! Everybody keep their masks on until you're out of here and out of danger. Listen, we wanna get out of here! What's the matter with you? - Major Walsh, Major Walsh. - Yes, sir. I'll have the rest of them off the mountain in one hour. Major, I want you to use infrared... ...and get me a photo analysis of the northern face. Yes, sir, it's already been ordered. Major Walsh, listen. I don't lik e to do this. We're in enough trouble with these cattlemen. If you can't get these folks out of the area by 2000 hours... ...start dusting with EZ-4. What's EZ-4? It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we used with the livestock. Comes out of Riot Control. They'll sleep for six hours and wake up with a headache, that's all. We didn't choose this place. We didn't choose these people! They were invited! They belong here more than we. I shouldn't have given up jogging. See that notch in the mountain? We'll make it in no time. Here come three more. The authority in this park... ...has been superseded by the United States government. There's a ravine leading straight up. - It's an easier climb. - It's no good. When you get to the top, it's a 300-foot drop down. Get down! What do you think is down on the other side? There's a box canyon on the other side with ravines and trails... ...if you take this incline to the right. I never imagined that. I only painted one side. - There was no canyon in my doodles. - Next time, sculpt. You give us a lot of credit. That's an hour's climb. Come on, let's go. The authority in this park... ...has been superseded by the United States government. You are entering a military reservation... ...and subject to military law. Call the bastard. Bahama, this is Pyramid. Over. Go ahead. Nothing to report at midstation. Up ahead there's thousands of places to hide. We'll need three times the men to cover this in one hour. Get everybody off the northern face, call the dark side of the moon... ...and tell them we're gonna dust. Get down! You are entering a military reservation... ...and subject to military law. Larry! Larry, come on! Larry! Don't let them see you! Get down! They're just crop-dusting. Los Angeles! - Larry? - Don't stop! Don't look back! Come on, come on! Roy! Hurry! We're only 10 feet from the top. Just a few more feet! We can slide down the other side! Come on, hurry. I'll come down. Don't come down. Come on, come on. Come on! - Don't worry. We'll make it. - Roy. Come on. Come on. Move it. Move your ass! Come on. Roy, come on. Come on. Please, come on. Hurry! Hold it! Jump! Jump! - Do you see that? - Oh, yes. Good. Is it on? Check the speak er system here. I want this up all the way.

Bye!, Attention please, TWA flight 820 from Hong Kong has arrived 30 minutes early. Passengers will exit from Gate 3. Mam. May I help you? Eggs. Tang Lung? Miss Chen Ching Hua? Yes. You weren't waiting at the gate. The plane arrived early. I was hungry, so I went and grabbed a bite. How is my uncle in Hong Kong? He's a bit unwell, so I came instead. He wrote me about you but didn't go into details. How can you help me? Please don't stand on ceremony I'll personally help you. Personally help me? Do you understand my problem? That you must tell me later. But first, can you tell me where the toilet is? Precious horse (BMW)? Wild horse (Mustang)? A flying horse? Dad died recently, and left me this restaurant. Uncle Wang and the others have helped out a lot. Business wasn't bad in the beginning. Then a huge syndicate stepped in. They're interested in our land and wanted me to sell the restaurant. There's no sale without mutual agreement. If you refuse, what can they do? In theory, you're right but they won't listen to reason. They'll do anything for my land. They hired some young thugs to watch the place day and night. If a customer comes in they simply drive him away. What am I to do? Why not report it to the police? They disappear when the police come. We can't ask for round-the-clock protection. Business has gone down badly and I still have to pay my workers. How can I go on meeting the expenses? The thugs have become worse lately demanding an immediate answer. So I wrote to my uncle for help. I thought he'd send a lawyer, but... I told you not to worry. I am here to help. Don't worry, Miss Chen. It's nothing. I can take care of them. Look up there! That's their headquarters. Make yourself at home. I rent this place. It's more convenient. All the men live at the restaurant. There's always a spare room for my sick workers. You can stay there for the time being. You're my uncle's friend, so please feel at home. Let me know if you need anything. May I use your toilet? It's over there. Chinese New Year is coming up, do they celebrate it in Rome? I haven't been back to HK in 12 years, it certainly will take some getting used to. How's the restaurant business? I live on a farm in the New Territories. I practise martial arts every day. Restaurants haven't changed much. Take a seat. Here's the key. Our telephone numbers are on it. The restaurant is nearby. If you lose your way, show that card and any taxi driver will bring you back. Taxi? It's too expensive here. Do they have public light buses? Do you need some money? No, I brought some with me. Better put it in a bank, it's safer that way. No, it's safer and easier to carry it. I won't argue. How much did you bring? Not much. Really, not much. Still, I say it's safer in the bank. Come! Miss Chen! How are you? How are you? This is Mr. Tang He wants to deposit some money. My friend. How much money do you have, let's see it! This way. How much you want to change into our currency? How much local money will you change? 20 will do. Lately the exchange rate has been bad. That was the bank manager, not a pickpocket. You must be more polite. Not everyone you meet is a villain. Besides, I know that bank manager. Foreigners are warm and polite. When people smile, smile back, that's politeness. When someone puts an arm on your shoulder, it's a sign of friendship You should react the same way. Remember that well! Have a seat please! Make yourself at home! Ah Lung, you must be Ah Lung! Welcome to Rome. I'm Quen, from Miss Chen's restaurant. Quen! Miss Chen has returned to the restaurant. She asked me to take you there. By the way, where were you just now? Let's go! Ah Lung is back. Ah Lung, this is Uncle Wang. Uncle Wang. Have a seat! Quen, prepare some tea. Ok... It must have been a long and tedious flight. How do you like it here so far? I'm certainly not used to things yet. Doesn't matter, you will, as time goes on. It's been a long time since I was back home. How are things in HK? HK? I seldom went to town when I was in the New Territories. Have some tea. Come, have some tea. Thank you! Why are there no customers? With those thugs around, who'd dare come here? Ah Lung, there are more workers training out back. Let's go meet them. Ok... There's no business so they spend their time exercising. Come on! Before Mr. Chen passed away, they learned karate to handle the villains. Why didn't you take it up? I'm not interested in foreign martial arts. It doesn't matter what style if you can use your body well even in the midst of violent movement, to honestly express oneself. I prefer Chinese boxing. Do you know Chinese boxing? Yes! Really? Let's take a breather. Come here. This is Tang Lung. Introduce yourselves. My name is Tony! Jimmy! Thomas! Robert! I've no English name. Call me Ah Chuan. Ah Chuan. He looks like a typical Chinese boxer. Have you learned any boxing? Ah Lung came from HK to help us. He's an expert Chinese boxer. I'm just a novice. Chinese boxing? I understand it's like dancing. But it sadly lacks power? You lack power when you haven't mastered the fundamentals Right. How then do you develop power? By putting the hip into it. Right. Will you demonstrate how to put the hip into it? I'm afraid I'll hurt someone. What are you afraid of? They're wearing protective padding. They won't get hurt. We've guests coming. Change and get to work. Hurry! Come on, let's go. Change and get cracking! Quen, where's the toilet? Over there. It's labelled in English. Thank you! Out, get the hell out of here, now! Come on! Get out! Why? That's why! What's your decision? Uncle Wang. Yes. Come quick, they're here again! Stop it! All right! If you don't answer by tonight, don't blame us for getting rough. Please help us out, put in a good word for us. Give us a few more days to think it over. You've been delaying a long time. Are you or are you not selling? Hey, don't you hit anyone. Don't fight please! We'll only wreck our own things. Remember, by tonight you'd better have an answer for us Let's go! Sorry! Watch where you're going next time. You don't even know a word of English. Why did my Uncle send you here? They're young and headstrong, Don't blame them, everything will be all right. Lucky they weren't armed today. In broad daylight? They wouldn't dare use a gun in public. If Uncle Wang hadn't stopped them... I'd have used karate on them! You can talk! What good is your karate? It's still better than Chinese boxing People shove you out of the way and you even apologised! Sit down, sit down, please! May I help you? Can you help me? Sure! I'd like some Chinese spareribs. Chinese spareribs? Do you need me to tell you what Chinese spareribs are? Well let me show you! What are you doing? You know what we are doing, don't they, fellas? You all should have left this restaurant! Get Uncle Wang out here to help. Stay calm. Don't wreck our place. It's no use. Do you want to step outside! Sure! Good! Go... Ah Lung, you...? Let's go! Jimmy... Jimmy... Chinese boxing? Damn! They think this is Chinese boxing If I knew Chinese boxing I'd give them a good taste of it! I'll go! Tell him this is Chinese boxing Hey! Chinese boxer! The Dragon Set Movement No. Four ""Little Dragon Seeking Its Path"" ""Big Dragon whipping its tail"" Ah Lung, bravo! Magnificent! Excellent! Don't be overjoyed. There'll be more trouble after this. With Ah Lung's skill those men will think twice now. You don't understand. It's hard to beat local hoodlums. This is their territory. We must be careful. Let's be more patient. More patience! Man, our Dragon is here! You'd be wise to heed my advice. Is that so? Calm down, everyone. Ah Lung, it's late, you must be tired. Let's turn in. Want some supper? No, I must get up early for training. I hear it's easy to buy a gun here? Yes, any local citizen can get a licence. What are you doing? Making darts. Darts? What's the matter? Want to eat? You can if you're as good as Ah Lung. Better go practise your karate! Is it for brother Lung? Why didn't you say so? Brother Lung! Good morning, Brother Lung! I made this especially for you. Eat it while it's hot. You're terrific. Who was your teacher in HK? Look at this! Little Dragon seeking its path ""Big Dragon whipping its tail"" With that, all the enemies are down! You said Chinese boxing lacks power. I was only kidding. Ah Lung, you were too fast yesterday. We couldn't see clearly Will you show us again? Please show us. Go on then! Everyone says you're fast and powerful. I didn't see it last night. You said one must use the hip. How about a demonstration? Be quiet and let's watch, okay? So shut up! Step back! Are you all right? Everything all right? Fantastic! Ah Lung, will you be my teacher? You said physical training is useless. So why are you doing it now? I never liked karate. That's Chinese boxing, you dig? We'll give up karate. Let's learn from Ah Lung. Right! Customers! Come quick! Change, on the double! Ah Lung, no, Master, Master I have to go take care the customer. We'll talk later. Is there anything for me to do? Watch out for those villains. My boss wants to see you! What was that? He wants us to see his boss. Shut up! Now move! See you tomorrow. All of you are good for nothing! You! Didn't you have a gun? What I like, I get and I want the restaurant. Yes boss! Yes boss! Yes boss! Yes boss! You've wasted enough time! But, I... I always do my best. Then why did you fail? They're getting help from a man called Tang Lung. A man? Only one man? But this man knows Chinese kung fu. Kung fu? Good morning. Sit down. Eat. You won't often find this in Rome, how does it taste? It's not as good as in HK. I cooked it, it's all right. And you? Want some more? I'll take you around Rome later. Wait! Go on! Move, move, come on! Where's the man from HK? Tell him to come out. Where is he? Talk! I don't know. You'd better talk! All right. He'll be back soon. Where is he now? These are famous relics of the past. Over there... what is it? Our slum is full of these wrecks. Please. A king built these gardens for his queen. It took a lot of time and money. They must have been really in love. Are you married? How do you like the palace? Such a big place is a waste. In HK I would build a skyscraper and collect rent. I'd better return to the restaurant. Close the door. You better cool it, baby. Bring him down! Chinese kung fu? The boss means well. He appreciates talent and he knows you're strong. Oh, what rippling muscle! We don't want to harm you. Here's a ticket back to HK. Better to stay out of trouble. All right! Take him away but be careful with the gun in public. Yes boss! Come on, let's go! Go to see if anybody around? Put your hands down! Put your hands down! Listen, listen! Boss, that bastard got away! Go! Get him, but no gun! Get him! Let's get him! Get him! Miss Chen, quit while you're ahead. You'd better say yes. We're offering you a good deal. Hello! Tell him. We don't want any more trouble, or else I will retaliate. He told us not to come and cause any more trouble. Move them out. Hurry up and pick up everybody. Hold it, that's a customer. Welcome! Serve our guest properly. See? I told you to be patient. You should bear the responsibility for this. What should we do now? We'll fight to the end. This is no joke. I know, but... I know how you feel but we must think of Tang Lung. They'll do what they say. You mean... Keep him under cover for awhile. Tomorrow is Chinese New Year's If there's trouble... I don't know if he'll agree? I know he's stubborn You must persuade him. Without him, we'll be forced to sell the restaurant. We'll have to see. We may have to cooperate. But we mustn't sell the place. Let me decide. All right. Better go and talk to Lung. Is your restaurant open tomorrow? Good, we'll go to the countryside and practise. Remind Quen to bring the protective padding. Firecrackers? It's banned in HK. There must be Chinese living nearby. You must leave Rome for awhile. Leave Rome? We don't want you to go, especially me, but you must. Do you understand me? I don't understand. Ah Lung, why won't you... Are you afraid of fire crackers? I'll take you to the airport. Why? Those men want you... My duty is to help you. I know, but you must leave They intend to kill you Kill me? Who? Time's up. Let's go! It's too noisy. I'll close the window. Stay here, don't move about. Miss Chen! Hello! May I help you? Three... five... Hello, what was that Sir, can you please repeat that? Hello... hello... hello... Don't waste time. Here's the agreement of sale. Sign it! No! Why be so stubborn? The boss has been nice to you. If this knife crosses your face, you'll look ugly. So don't make our boss mad. I won't sign! It's for your own good. We'll get the restaurant sooner or later anyway. Tang Lung will soon be here. Tang Lung? You think he will come? He's reporting to our Lord in Heaven! Be careful. The mastermind is over there. You're crazy! Let me tell you. He doesn't understand Chinese. Let's go. I've thought of a great way to handle that Tang Lung. Do unto other's as you would have them do unto you! Well, among my friends there is one Japanese martial artist and one European martial artist They are both strong but the problem is they are from different schools. I'm afraid they might not cooperate with each other. Money will buy cooperation. If money is not a problem. Then I suggest we call America for Colt. Is this Colt good? Is Colt good? He is America's best! You better pray that you don't fail this time! He will beat Tang Lung. I'll bet my life on it. Operator! I'd like to call America. Yes, A-me-ri-ca! Happy New Year! Thank you, Uncle Wang... I didn't expect traditional lucky money abroad. Uncle Wang gives us lucky money yearly. This is my best New Year ever. First, we successfully defended our restaurant, and second, we have Ah Lung with us, who's also our teacher. Third, we finally beat the hoodlums. Let's enjoy the new year and skip the violence. Here comes Ching Hua. Happy New Year! Come, this is for you. Thank you, Uncle Wang Ah Lung, a cable for you. It's from my Uncle. He wants you to go somewhere to help someone. Don't be like that. I'll be back. I won't leave until the whole thing is settled. Happy New Year! Beautiful decorations indeed. What a warm gathering. What do you want? I came to bring greetings. It was our fault. I must apologize. We must all be friends. Our boss would like to see Mr. Tang. Would he do us the honor? Wonderful. Business will be good this year. Tell your boss we'll be there. Fine. Empress Restaurant tomorrow morning, bye. Just a minute please! Please, please! We are friends. Tang Lung is our enemy. Please wait for our boss to come back to decide. Which one of you will take care of that Chinaman? Stop! Sensei! Bob's my student. He will personally take care of Tang Lung. Yes, boss! Who can do karate better than the Japanese? Wait! Now that we have decided. Is everything arranged? Yes, boss! I'll meet them at the restaurant early tomorrow morning. You're here. Sit down. Sorry our boss couldn't make it. Why isn't he here? Something urgent came up. I'll have my car drive you over. What? We're to go to him? Never mind. Take us there! Right! I like straight-talkers. Let's go! Where is he? He's gone. Forget it. He won't get away. It's a trick. Be careful everyone! Leave it to me, Teacher! The three of us can handle him. I'll go first. You? Tang Lung? Tang Lung. Are you Tang Lung? Leave it, he's already surrendered. Ah Lung, we're lucky this time not to have fallen into their trap. Tang Lung, come if you dare! Ah Lung, don't let him get away. Tony and Jimmy can take the Japanese. Tony, are you all right? I'm hurting all over. Uncle Wang, why... Don't blame me, if you must, blame it on Ah Lung Yes, Ah Lung got you into this mess He should not have get in my way. You... what do you mean? What do I mean? Working men have no future. I have worked hard for half my life but own nothing. My wife and children are waiting in HK If the restaurant cooperates, they'll pay me a big reward. Then I can return to HK, and enjoy luxury. I've slogged away overseas I'd like to enjoy an easy life. Tang Lung, you've got guts. The man you just saw will kill you. Lung, you're at the end of your road. You're at Death's door. Ho! Wang, we've failed. Hold it! We've been tricked Tony and Jimmy... look! Don't get emotional, please! Listen to me, Mr. Tang. Now that it's over. I must go. I'll see you off. No, Chuan has a car waiting. Take good care. In this world of guns and knives, he's gonna need luck wherever he goes!, Huh? I am not a bum. I'm a jerk. I once had wealth, power, and the love of a beautiful woman. Now, I only have two things. My friends and, uh, my thermos. Huh? My story? Okay. It was never easy for me. I was born a poor black child. I remember the days sittin' on the porch with my family singin' and dancin' down in Mississippi.   Whoa Lordie Pick a bale a day   Boy, I hope everybody's good and hungry. I know I am. And I'm ready for that. Here's corn bread and collard greens. And I cooked up those hog maws you like. Mother, dear, ain't we forgetting somethin'? No, I'm not. Today is Navin's birthday.

St. Louis. How far are you goin'? To the end of this fence. Okay.  I'm Navin Johnson. What's your name, sir? Here we are. Okay. Thanks for the company. I hope I can repay you someday.    Well, what is it, boy? Are you lost?  Do you want to play? Is it trouble?  Trouble? Is it an accident? A drownin'? A fire? Fire.  Gosh, we've got to warn everybody. I've heard about dogs like you.

This will be fine. Right here.  Thank you. Where you goin'? To the bathroom. You gotta have a key. Can I get one? My key is for customers who buy gas. Oh! I'm buying gas. I don't see no car. I... I just need enough for my lighter. Oh, look at this. And my wife wanted me to stay home today. Look what I would have missed. A complete fill-up for a whole lighter, huh? It's on that wall. Thank you.  And don't walk away with it. I won't.  Hey, pop-top. Hey, silverbird, I'm talkin' to you. Huh? Listen, you wanna be president of the Texaco Oil? Sure. Then clean up the sink in there. Then I'll be president of Texaco Oil? Whatever happened to workin' your way up? He starts workin' for me 10 minutes and already he wants to be president. Get to work in there. But, sir, I don't work here. Not even for $1. 10 an hour? ""Dear Folks, I got this great job in a gas station. ""I don't wanna say how much I'm getting, but let's just say it's a lot."" ""I'm enclosing $2."" That's a good boy. ""It's a lot of fun working and Mr. Hartounian is really nice. He's teaching me how to be impatient."" Navin! ""Well, I gotta go now. What do you think I do, write letters all day?"" You actually sleep here? Yes, is that okay? Come with me. I got a beautiful little place for you to stay. Put the light on. You're gonna like it here. Like it? I love it! This is fabulous! I mean, you got the toilet here. This must be the kitchen. No. You know, what I could do is take this wall and just turn it this way so I've got a much larger living space, plus it'll create a flow into the main living area. It'll be incredible. No, no, I'll just elevate this about 6 inches. Create the illusion of two rooms and yet still have that flow. Then I can take bookshelves and put them here. No, I'll put the books right over here. That way I can be relaxed over here. The customers come in and use the urinal. Navin. I won't disturb them, they won't disturb me. Take it easy, it's not here. It's in here. Oh! I couldn't afford this, anyway. Well, this is it. It's perfect. I won't have to change this at all. Take a look. No kitchen, no windows, no chairs, no tables. It's a masterpiece of understatement. I'll put a bed down here, get a bigger bulb. I'll bring some sheets from the house. You'll be set for life. Gosh! How much is this gonna cost me? Nothin'. When you're rich and famous, you'll send me a postcard. A postcard, huh? Okay. It's a deal. It's a deal. What are those? Step outside for a second, darlin'. Navin, this is my wife, Lenore. Lenore, this is Navin. Pleased to meet you. Navin, do you know why a woman of such pulchritude is married to a man like me? 'Cause I make a very comfortable living. And this is the first time I'm leaving you alone on a Sunday. If anything should happen to this station, this woman would leave me like a... In other words, there would be no more, uh... Do you know what I'm talkin' about? Yes, sir. No more... So remember, guard this station with your life. Because my sex life is in your hands.     I can fix those shocks. No, no, we just want some gas, muchacho. Okay, but it's Sunday. We got to have a credit card.  Then all the cash is locked up? Oh, no, not locked up. We got a lot of cash. It's just that the banks are closed, and I'm not allowed to have cash coming in or going out 'cause I'm here alone for the first time. I don't want anything to happen. And you know, you flash this kind of wad in front of some people, they'll kill you for it. So we got to have a credit card. Hey, Trin, have you got a credit card in there? Huh? Credit card. Hola.  Oh, no thanks, I don't smoke. What kind of cigarette is that? A joint. Joint? They don't make 'em very good. Master Charge do? Yeah, that's fine. We take Master Charge. You want a fill-up, uh, Mrs. Nussbaum? Oh, I'm Mr. Nussbaum. Yeah, that-that's his wife's card. His wife's card, huh? Yeah, I'll vouch for him. Okay, as long as we've got a voucher.   Stolen?   I got it. Just send a police car over. Mrs. Nussbaum's credit card. I got the guys who stole it.  Hold on, they're calling me. I'll be right back.   Yes? Yeah. Throw a couple of tires in the trunk. Put it on the card. Radials. Okay. Make them whitewalls. Yes, sir, Mr. Nussbaum. I'm back. Only, it's worst than I thought. They're not only sticking us for gas, but they're grabbing tires and everything. They're really socking it to us. Yeah, it's Hartounian's Gas Station at the corner. Hang on a second. I don't want to get them suspicious. Don't worry, I can keep them here. I saw this trick in a movie.  Got your tires. Yeah, yeah, good.    Anything else? Yeah. We'll take that money you got in your pocket. Oh, sure. I'll just put it on the card. Hey, guess what? You are our eighth customer today. You won a free oven mitt. Hah! I'll go get it for you.  Yeah, I'm back. Uh-huh.  Yeah, they're gonna be here for a while. Don't worry. I rigged it. You guys wanna stick around for an oven mitt? Nah!   Hang on just a second.  Um, they might not be here exactly, uh, when you get back but, uh, it's a... It's a blue Chevy two-door, and it'll be going south on Hertodo Street. No, I can't make out the license number but, uh, it'll be pulling a small church. So, any blue Chevy pulling a small church, I figure that-that'd be the one. Yeah. Uh-huh. Believe me, I'm not mad at you. What's the matter with you? What did I lose? A couple of tires? Look at the bright side, we also lost a church. Gee, Mr. Hartounian.  Gee, Mr. Hartounian!  Oh, my God! Thank you. The new phone book's here! The new phone book's here! Boy, I wish I could get that excited about nothin'. Nothing? Are you kidding? Page 73. ""Johnson, Navin R."" I'm somebody now! Millions of people look at this book every day. This is the kind of spontaneous publicity your name in print, that makes people... I'm in print. Things are going to start happening to me now. Johnson, Navin R. Sounds like a typical bastard. Die, Navin R. Johnson! Bastard. Random son of a bitch. Typical run-of-the-mill bastard. Fill her up? Fill her up, son, and a little bit extra. Stan Fox, buying gas. Navin R. Johnson selling it, sir. Got you, you average, typical, blocking-of-the-view of a goddamn average victim bastard. Check your oil? Check away, Navin R. Johnson. Oil rag at the ready, sir. Let's check the oil together. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Son-of-a-blocking bastard. Looks good to me, sir, but I'd like your opinion. Damn these glasses. It looks good to me, too. Hurry up, son, time's a-wastin'. I'm going to the john. Don't forget to check those tires. Damn these glasses, son. Yes, sir, I damn thee. Damn.  Damn these glasses! Sir. I can fix those glasses. You can? Well, here, fix those suckers. Shit! Sir? Guess what? I fixed them. I was back there thinking, ""What causes glasses to slip on and off?"" And it's because when you take them on and off, you're always putting pressure on the frames like this. It causes 'em to spread. So I put a little handle right here in the center, and it puts the pressure on the bridge where it belongs, just like the tie rods on a '72 Buick. Plus, I put a little nose break on them here to prevent slippage. Try it. Use the handle. Well, I'll be... It works. You know, I make a pretty good living selling shit like this. I'll tell you what, if I can develop this gizmo, I'll split it with you 50/50. Okay, how much do I owe you for the gas? I got a trunk load of shit to sell. Here's $30. Keep the change. Wow! Thanks. Dead center! Say your prayers, half-breed!  Hey, Harry. Look at this. What's the matter with these cans? Die, Milk Face!  These cans are defective. They're springing leaks. Come over here and look at this. Listen, you better run for cover or you're gonna spring a leak. Uh? We don't have defective cans. We have a defective person out there.  He hates these cans. Stay away from the cans! Die, gas pumper. I got to get away from those cans.  There's cans in there, too.  More cans. Die, you bastard.  He doesn't want to put holes in the cans. He wants to put holes in you. What?  Milk face bastard! Oh, my God. I'm endangering your life. Cover me. You're covered. Suck my toes! You stay here. I'll distract him.  Shithead! Come on! Come on, boy. Good boy. ""Carnival personnel only."" Damn. Shithead, come on! You're not carnival personnel! Come on, boy, come on. Hey, he ain't no carnival personnel.  Okay, you move it out.  So, Mom, when I told Mr. Hartounian I'd come back, he said ""Don't be a putz. See the world. Me, you've seen already."" I took his advice and got a job with SJM Fiesta Shows as a weight guesser. Frosty, my boss, told me there's a big future in weight guessing. Enclosed is $4.75 for my loving family. P.S. Is Grandma still fartin'? For $1, I'll guess your weight, your height, or your sex. The most exciting thing on the midway. Imagine the thrill of getting your weight guessed by a professional. You can blow up your cheeks, you can stick out your chest, but you're not going to fool the guesser. How about you, sir? Step right up. Honey, let's see how good this guy is. Now, what do I win? Uh, anything in this general area, right in here. Anything below the stereo, and on this side of the bicentennial glasses. Anything between the ashtrays and the thimble. Anything in these three inches. Right in here, in this area, that includes the Chiclets but not the erasers. No, sir. Come on, honey. He thought he had himself a rube. Frosty, I am just no good at this. Oh, come on, Navin, you're doing fine. No, I've already given away eight pencils, two hula dolls, and an ashtray, and I've only taken in $15. Navin, you have taken in $15 and given away 50 cents' worth of crap. Which gives us a net profit of $14.50. Ah! It's a profit deal.  That takes the pressure off. Get your weight guessed right here. Only $1. Actual live weight guessing. Take a chance and win some crap. Step right up. Ladies and gentlemen, I draw your attention now to the left side of our midway, presenting the amazing Patty Bernstein doing her special ride through the Flaming Wall of Death.    Wanna guess my weight, greenie? I saw you last night. You were great. Yeah, right. Turn around. What? Turn around. Go like this. You're okay. Give me a bite of that corn dog. What about germs? Put a rubber on it. Get on. Don't you wear him out. He's got to work tonight. What a great place.  You know, you can tell so much about a person from the way they live. Just looking around here, I can tell you're a genuinely dirty person. What do I do with this? Oh, you keep it there.  Where's your garbage? Do you know what I'd like to do? What? Guess your weight. Hey, that would be interesting for me. No one has tried to guess my weight. You see, I guess their weights. It'd be sort... Put your arms up. This will give me a whole different perspective on this. Hey, you're really trying to be accurate. Is it getting hot in here?  Wait a minute! What's happening to my special purpose? What's your ""special purpose""? Well, when I was a kid, my mom told me that was my special purpose and someday I'd find out what that special purpose was. Today's the day!   Hey, this is like a... a ride.  ""My Dear Family, guess what? ""Today I found out what my special purpose is for. ""Gosh, what a great time I had. ""I wish the whole family could have been here with me. ""Maybe some other time ""as I intend to do this a lot ""every chance I get. ""I think next week I'll be able to send more money ""as I may have extra work. ""My friend Patty promised me a blowjob. Your lovin' son, Navin."" And he's got the kisses here. That Patty must be a sweet girl. God bless her.   Do you ever think we'll get to know each other well enough to kiss? We don't have to. You're my man. It's like we're married. Look at my ass. Gosh! You have my last name tattooed right there under the ""J's."" First I get my name in the phone book, and now I'm on your ass. You know, I'll bet more people see that than the phone book.   End of the line. This is Engineer Fred. Come back and visit me again. Billy. Billy. Woo-woo! Have you seen a 5-year-old boy, blond hair, and he's wearing a T-shirt that says ""Bullshit"" on it? No. There was just one kid earlier, had a T-shirt that said ""Life sucks"" on it. We got off the roundup and he said he wanted to go on the trains. Well, I don't think... There he is. Billy! Hey, come back here! Billy, come on off that train! Pull that lever! Pull the lever! Here, hold that. And these. Billy! And take my keys. And hold my wallet. Okay. Don't touch the Johnson bar. You'll explode the fuel casing. And if the Wilson-Smith indicator gets above 160, just turn that little... Billy, I can't take you anywhere anymore! There's a little screwdriver there. Just put it in, turn it one-quarter. We're going into the tunnel. Don't stand up because the clearance is only four foot... Oh, no! I'm okay. I was protected by the bill of my Engineer Fred cap.  Thanks for pulling my cap down. Oh, Billy. Billy, you scared me half to death. Thank you so much. It would have been so embarrassing to go home without Billy. Oh, here's your gloves and your oil can and your wallet. Oh, and this fell out.  Those guys. Listen, what you did just now was very brave. Is there some way I could repay you? Repay me? I could never accept anything from you for saving your child. Oh, he's not my child. I'm just babysitting for a friend. Oh! Would it be too much if I asked for a kiss? No. He's a real little dickens. Thank you. Oh, Miss? I was... I was just standing here right now and I was wondering if you weren't doing anything tomorrow that maybe you might wanna go out or... What?  I thought maybe you might wanna go out with me. Are you trying to ask me for a date? Well... Once for no, twice for yes. Okay. Um, you're so cute. How about 3:30 tomorrow at the roundup? Okay. Do you have any boyfriends? Not really. Are they crazy? If I was a fella, I'd be around all the time. Well, see if you can work it out. We have a date tomorrow. What's your name? Marie. What's yours? I'll tell you tomorrow. It'll give us something interesting to talk about. Hi. What's up, hubby? I got these for you. Thanks. Navin, you know the other day when I showed you the tattoo? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I forgot to tell you somethin'. Oh, really? What? This. And that's what's gonna happen to you if I ever catch you looking at another broad. I'm glad you told me. And remember, I did this without anger. And I stayed away from your crotch. Bye, sweetie. Hi. What happened? Oh, it was unbelievable. These guys jumped me. Tried to get these flowers. I got 'em for you. It's kind of a traditional date deal. Yeah, I've heard of that. What were they? Uh, couple of dozen roses. Look like daisy stems. What? That guy gypped me. He put... put daisy stems on my roses.  Hey, look, these hoodlums are dangerous. I think we ought to get out of here before she sees us. She? What? You said ""she."" No. No. I always call a gang ""she."" It's like when you call a boat ""she,"" or... or a hurricane ""she."" Or a girl? A girl. You can call a girl ""she."" That's just one of the many things you can call ""she.""  Why are you smiling? You're the first person I've ever had in my place. Do you live here? Oh, it's nice. So, did you decorate it? I got all this stuff from the old Cup O' Pizza place before they tore it down. That was really good pizza. Oh, this is the best pizza in a cup ever. This guy's unbelievable. He ran the old Cup O' Pizza guy out of business. Really? People come from all over to get this. Uh-huh.  You know, you have beautiful skin. May I? Yes. So smooth and flexible. I take after my mother's side of the family. It's amazing the way it just snaps back like that. Amazing. Are you a model? No. I'm a cosmetologist. Really? A cosmetologist? That's unbelievable. That's impressive. It must be tough to handle the weightlessness. Can I ask you a personal question? What is it? Now be totally honest. You do have a boyfriend, don't you? Kind of. I know this is our first date but do you think the next time you make love to your boyfriend, you could think of me? Well, I haven't made love to him yet. That's too bad. Do you think it's possible that some day you could make love with me and think of him? Who knows? Maybe you and he can make love and you could think of me. I'd just be happy to be in there somewhere. Do you have a girlfriend? Does it matter? Well, I'd like to think you were available. Oh, I'm available. Did you forget about my ass? No! No, I've been thinking about it. She tattooed my name on her ass. Not just my name, a lot of names. And funny sayings, too. She's got one up there that says, ""Slippery when wet."" How do you know that? What is she? Some great piece of ass? She's no great piece of ass. I mean, uh... Hey, wait... wait a minute. Wait a minute. We're all adults here. Let's reason this out. Now Marie is the type of person that if you gotta... If this gash doesn't get her buns out of here, I am gonna drive this bike up her butt! While Patty tends to be more direct. As for you, farm boy,  We're married! And as for you, kewpie doll... You protected me! You must really like me. I know, I know, you belong To somebody new But tonight You belong to me Although, although we're apart You're a part of my heart And tonight You belong to me Way down By the stream How sweet It will seem Once more, just to dream In the moonlight My Honey, I know, I know With the dawn That you Will be gone But tonight You belong to me Just to little old me  You know, while you were playing that just now,  I had the craziest fantasy that I could rise up. Float right down the end of this cornet. Right through here. Through these valves, right along this tube, come right up against your lips, and give you a kiss. Why didn't you? I didn't want to get spit on me.   Was it good for you, too? I really do want to kiss you. But I'm afraid. I would've kept my tongue in. No, I mean, I'm afraid if I kiss you, I'll fall in love with you. You will? And I don't want to. You don't? My mother sacrificed everything to send me through cosmetology school. She did? She has this dream for me to be something. She does? To marry someone with power, money, vision. Someone with a special purpose. I've got one! I've got a special purpose! You do?  Yes, it's fantastic! It's great! It's unbelievable! And I was afraid to tell you about it! Your mother's gonna love me! Marie, are you awake? Good. You look so beautiful and peaceful, you almost look dead. And I'm glad because there's something I wanna say that's always been very difficult for me to say. I slit the sheet, the sheet I slit, and on the slitted sheet I sit. I've never been relaxed enough around anyone to be able to say that. You give me confidence in myself. I know we've only known each other for four weeks and three days, but to me it seems like nine weeks and five days. The first day seemed like a week. And the second day seemed like five days. And the third day seemed like a week again. And the fourth day seemed like eight days. But the fifth day, you went to see your mother. And that seemed just like a day. But then you came back and later on the sixth day, in the evening, when we saw each other, that started seeming like two days. So in the evening, it seemed like two days spilling over into the next day. And that started seeming like four days. So at the end of the sixth day, on into the seventh day, it seemed like a total of five days. And the sixth day seemed like a week and a half. I have it written down but I can... I can show it to you tomorrow if you wanna see it. Anyway, I've decided that tomorrow, when the time is right, I'm gonna ask you to marry me. If that's okay with you. Just don't say anything. You've made me very happy. Oh, I'll see you again Whenever spring breaks through again Honey, sing! Time may lie heavy between But what has been Is past forgetting This sweet memory Across the years, will come  To me Though my world May go awry In my heart Will ever lie Just the echo of a sigh Goodbye Honey, who's the happiest guy in the world? You are. That's right. And who's the happiest gal?  That's right. Honey, guess what? I wrote a song for you this morning. Oh, I'm picking out a thermos for you Not an ordinary thermos for you But the extra-best thermos you can buy With vinyl and stripes and a cup built right in I'm picking out a thermos for you And maybe a barometer, too And what else can I buy so on me you'll rely A rear-end thermometer, too Honey? There's a question I've been wanting to pop, but I've been afraid you'd say no. But this seems like the right time and place. So here goes. Honey, will you marry me?  Yahoo! Come on, let's seal it with a kiss! Get in the tub with me! Not you, Shithead! Where's Marie?  What letter? ""Dear Navin.""  ...to tell... ...to be...  Marie! Marie!  Shithead, come here. Good idea. Marie! Marie, why did you leave me? I couldn't read the letter. It was too blurry. Marie! Marie!  Here, boy. Marie! Marie! Where are you, Marie? Marie! Marie! This is not gonna be easy, Shithead. We've been together a long time. But I gotta head down that road. And there'll be times out there when there won't be enough food for two. And I won't be able to... Hey, wait a minute! I-I'm not done yet! Come back. I'm not finished. I have some more to tell you. You'll find a family who can give you a real home, with loving kids and a warm fireplace. I never liked you, anyway. Now get out of here! Okay! Okay! You win. You can go with me. So, Mom, with my faithful dog leading the way, I'm out to win the hand of Marie. You'd love her, Ma. She looks just like you. Except she's white and blond. So, to win her back, I vowed to make something of myself. I settled in Los Angeles and took the money I saved and rented my first apartment. ""I haven't heard from Marie.  ""Things couldn't be worse. I can only send you 49 cents this week..."" Oh, bless his heart. That's a good boy. ""...as I've lost all my jobs. ""I've been eating well, though. ""The hospital gives out free meals of orange juice and cookies. ""And all I have to do is give them a pint of blood. I ate there all week. Three times a day."" A pint of blood? ""I decided to quit ""when I cut myself shaving and nothing came out but air. ""I have to go now as someone is staring at me through binoculars. Your loving son, Navin."" It's him. Him? What's him doing here? Shithead! Shithead! Attack! Attack! Attack!  Not me! Get off, Shithead!  You son of a bitch.   You're gonna have to sign for this. I have to sign before you shoot me? I'm not gonna shoot you. Why not? That was the old me. I was a little mixed-up at that time. Had a bad marriage and I just gave up smoking. I'm okay now. I'm a private detective. So long. Thank you. ""Dear Mr. Johnson. ""Please call on me in Suite ""2655 at the Century Plaza Tower ""in Los Angeles. ""I have something of great importance to impart to you."" Navin! Remember me? No, but don't feel bad. Fox. Stan Fox! Remember the gas station? Boy, you are one hard guy to find! You don't remember me. The glasses handle! Look! Oh, yeah. My glasses handle. Use the Opti-Grab. Opti-Grab? Yeah, we call it Opti-Grab. Opti-Grab. ""Opti,"" from the eye and ""Grab,"" from where you grab it. Opti-Grabbing it. Navin, my boy, we're in business. Fifty-fifty. Just like we said. Right in here, I have your first check for 250 big ones. That's just the beginning. There's gonna be more. Lots more! Can I cash this? Sure. You can do whatever you like. It's your money. It's a cashier's check. Wow! I can use money. Yes, I have a cashier's check and I'd like to cash it. How much is it for? 250 big ones. 250 dollarinies. That's 250 doughnuts.  You wanna cash this? Well, I could take 50 of the doughnuts and deposit the other 200 beauties. Have a seat, Mr., uh, Johnson. I will need two pieces of identification. Ah, yes. I have my temporary driver's license. And my Astronaut Application form. I didn't pass that, though. I failed everything but the ""Date of Birth."" I didn't get the job. Everything's in order. If you'll, uh, just endorse this, right there. I need a pen. Pen. Okay. Right here. Thank you. And, uh, fill out this, uh, deposit slip right there. All right. The endorsing and filling out of the deposit slip. Two hundred and fifty... thousand... ""Dear Harry. Guess what? ""I'm rich beyond my wildest dreams. ""But I haven't forgotten our deal. ""Here's that postcard I promised you. ""I'll bet you thought you'd never get it, huh? Your friend forever, Navin."" How do you like that? He promised me a postcard and he sent me a postcard. The kid has integrity. Shithead, come on.  Yello. Yes. Who? Mrs. Kimball? You're Marie's mom! Read about me in the paper? I've been trying to contact her. I don't know where she is. I'd give anything to find out. That sounds a little high. How about $75? Okay. Okay. What is it? The May Company in Los Angeles. Shithead! I know where she is! I know where she is! Doesn't that feel good? Mmm-hmm. There. Now, we are complete. Putting on Mask-O Derm just took a few short minutes and when we peel it off, he will look 20 years younger. Allevei. Yes, exactly. Now we'll let this dry. In the meantime, we can go pick out an eye shadow and lip tint for him. Now everyone just follow me this way because this is a very interesting line. I think you'll enjoy this. With your husband's coloring, a deep tone would bring out his lips. And this Nature Beige will feature his eyes just wonderfully. Let's try everything. What? Ah! Let's go unmask Irving. Everyone, back this way. We are now going to peel off our Mask-O Derm. Irving's skin will be tighter, firmer, and he'll look like a different man. You'll be amazed. Get ready, Irving.  Jeez! This shit really worked. Navin. Oh, my sweetheart.  What are you doing to my husband, you Miss Blondie? Irving! Irving, are you crazy? ""Dear Mom. ""The big news is, Marie and I were married. ""We couldn't wait. ""Luckily, we found someone at the Hollywood View Apartments, ""who could marry us immediately. ""He was a certified priest.  ""We were both glad we had a religious wedding. ""Money hasn't changed our lives that much. ""Our one little extravagance is a live-in butler and housekeeper."" Another check!  Just as I thought. Look at that. Nearly $750,000. Sir, it would seem with this kind of income, you could buy a larger house with proper servants' quarters. ""Mom, remember my dream of owning ""a big house on a hill? ""How I used to wish for a living room ""with a plaster lion in it from Mexico? ""And how I always wanted a large 24-seat dining table? ""In a dining room with original oil paintings ""by Michelangelo and Rembrandt? ""And remember how I always wanted a rotating bed ""with pink chiffon and zebra stripes? ""And remember how I used to chitchat with Dad ""about always wanting a bathtub shaped like a clam? ""And an office with orange and white stripes? ""And remember how much I wanted ""an all-red billiard room with a giant stuffed camel? ""And how I wanted a disco room with my own disco dancers? ""And a party room with fancy friends? ""And remember how much I wanted ""a big back yard with Grecian statues ""S-shaped hedges and three swimming pools? ""Well, I got that, too. ""Marie and I are getting along swell. ""But I've got a lot to learn about handling my money and banks. ""You have to be careful. ""Poor Hobart. ""His dear wife Hester took some money ""out of her savings account and had to pay a substantial penalty ""for early withdrawal. Enclosed is this week's check. Love, Navin."" Sorry about your wife, Hobart. Federal regulations, sir. Oh, dear me. Your wife has given you another gold chain. I'd nearly forgotten.  I suppose, I'm still not quite over Hester's death. Well, these things take time. Yes. So I'm told. Oh, here's your drink, sir. Like the one you saw in the magazine. You got the bamboo umbrella and everything. See that? Be somebody. Very good, sir. Very good. Oh, uh, there are some charity people here to see you, sir. No! Send them away! There's a lot of people more deserving than me. Ah, but these people want you to give. Oh. Okay. My name is Father Carlos Las Vegas De Cordoba. Father, you seem like a religious man. How can I help you? By giving me three minutes of your time so that you can see some film of a great ugliness that is spreading in my country. Oh, God. I'll bet it's disgusting. Hobart? Yes, sir? Are you over your grief enough yet to dim the lights?  Of course, sir. Well, one can't mourn forever. You will not believe what you are about to see. That human beings could have sunk so low that they can take pleasure to do this to another of God's creatures. I hope you have a strong stomach, senor. Roll the ugliness.    Good Lord. I've heard about this cat juggling.  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Good. Father, could there be a God that would let this happen? How much do you want? If your initial investment is $500,000, and your apartments are up in March, you should have ""X"" amount of dollars rolling in by the end of this year. Ah! ""X"" amount. That's very good, isn't it? Not only that, you can depreciate the entire building for the full amount. Depreciate? Very good. Hmm. I like that. We found a way to get around this Fair Housing crap. Ah! Good. Getting around the crap. That's good. By keeping the rents high, we're going to appeal to a select class of people. Select class. Very, very good. We'll keep the eggplants out. Ah, good. We don't want any vegetables. No, no. The jungle bunnies. Of course. They'll eat the vegetables. Boss? Can I... can I talk to him? We're gonna keep out the niggers. The what? The niggers. We'll keep 'em out. Yeah. Sir, you are talking to a nigger!      Don't be so hard on yourself. How could you know that was Iron Balls McGinty? Your escargots. Salad.  Would monsieur care for another bottle of the Chateau Latour? Ah, yes, but no more 1966. Let's splurge. Bring us some fresh wine. The freshest you've got. This year's. No more of this old stuff. Oui, monsieur. He doesn't realize he's dealing with sophisticated people here. Marie, now just stay calm. Stay calm. Just don't look down. Don't look down! Look up! Just keep your eyes up and keep them that way, okay? Waiter! There are snails on her plate.  Now get them out of here before she sees them. Look away! Just look away! And keep your eyes that way! You'd think at a fancy restaurant like this, at these prices, you would be able to keep the snails off the food! There're so many snails in there, you can't even see the food! Now take them away and bring me those melted cheese sandwich appetizers you talked me out of! Oui, monsieur. Do you believe this? First, they didn't have the bamboo umbrellas for the wine and now snails on the food. Two boobs! That's what he takes us for!  Hi, honey. Hi, doll face. Everything okay? Remember how you told me to take unnecessary lessons? Well, I just took a lesson. And a very good student, too. Adios, senora. Adios. You took bullfighting? No. Knife-throwing. Knife-throwing is great! I can almost do it. Well, let me see your stuff. Okay. This is very good for a beginner. This is exciting. I love this! Come on. Turn sideways. Okay. And put a balloon in your mouth. Do you have a balloon? Uh, no. Oh, wait. Yes. Okay. Is it in your mouth? Uh-huh! Throw 'em good and hard so they'll stick. Okay. One, two, three! Four, five, six! Oh! I missed. Honey, you did good. I can't do anything right. Honey, you worry too much. Come on. Let's flop this over and look at it another way. Why, do you realize in the past two short months, we have acquired the sophistication it takes some people a lifetime to acquire? Come on! Let's toast!   Everybody, Navin's on TV. Marie, it's Navin! Oh, honey, here's that interview you did on TV. Shut off the music! Shut it off! Shut off the music! Everyone, we're going to watch Navin on the TV. Now, sit down. Just sit on the floor. Sit around. American Time Newsmagazine, turns its probing eye on Navin Johnson, inventor of the Opti-Grab. That little glasses handle that sold 10 million units in a few short months. Mr. Johnson, you've become a millionaire overnight. Who are you? Who is Navin Johnson? Navin is a complex personality, as are most of the small breed of modern-day Renaissance millionaires. We had planned to show you the entire Johnson interview. However, when we returned to our studio, our news department informed us of a sensational development in the Johnson story. It seems that an irate group of citizens led by the celebrity Mr. Carl Reiner, has filed a class-action suit against Mr. Johnson and his Opti-Grab. Here's what Mr. Reiner had to say at a press conference. When Opti-Grab came out, I thought it was the greatest thing ever. And I bought a pair. And this is the result.  This little handle is like a magnet. Your eyes are constantly drawn to it and you end up cockeyed. Now, as a director, I am constantly using my eyes. And this Opti-Grab device has caused irreparable harm to my career. Let me show you a clip from my latest film, where my faulty depth perception kept me from yelling ""cut"" at the proper time. Cut! If I had yelled ""cut"" on time, those actors would be alive today. That's why I'm spearheading the $10-million class-action suit against Mr. Johnson and his irresponsible selling of a product, he didn't even test on prisoners. Thank you. The party's over. Nouveau riche. You know what I mean? What is this? Hey, wait a second. Where are you going? This guy's something else. I'm gonna get in touch with that Reiner guy. I got some... I got some change upstairs. We'll get some, uh, potato chips and there's some beer up there. We'll make it a less formal thing.  Let's find another party. Honey! Why the gloom? It's not the end of the rainbow. I'm Navin Johnson, inventor! This is no big deal. It's a parking ticket to me. Only instead of $5, it's $10,000,000. I don't care about losing all the money. It's losing all the stuff. We're not gonna lose the stuff.  This is America! We're gonna receive a fair trial from an impartial jury.  Your Honor, we, the jury, find for the plaintiff.  I award, to Mr. Reiner and the other nine million nine hundred and 87 thousand six hundred and 52 plaintiffs, the full amount of the suit. Court is adjourned!  Navin. Honey, can't you see I'm drinking? Pay to the order of Mrs. Wilbur Stark Pay to the order of Iron Balls McGinty Why are you crying? And why are you wearing that old dress? Because I just heard a song on the radio that reminded me of the way we were. What was it? The Way We Were.  Look at us. We've hit bottom. No! Maybe you've hit bottom, but I haven't hit bottom yet! I've got a ways to go! And I'm gonna bounce back! And when I do, I'm gonna buy you a diamond so big it's gonna make you puke. I don't wanna puke! I don't want wealth! I just want you like you used to be. What happened to that man? Me? What happened to the girl I believed in? The girl I fell in love with. The girl that believed in me. There's plenty of places I can go, where people believe in me. Well, go! The sooner you're out of my life, the sooner I can go back to being the girl in this little flowered dress that you sang the thermos song to. Well, I'm gonna go, then! And I don't need any of this! I don't need this stuff! And I don't need you! I don't need anything! Except this. This ashtray. The only thing I need is this! I don't need this or this. Just this ashtray! And this paddle game. The ashtray and the paddle game. And that's all I need! And this remote control. The ashtray, the paddle game, and the remote control. And that's all I need! And these matches. The ashtray and these matches and the remote control and the paddle ball. This lamp. The ashtray, this paddle game and the remote control, and the lamp. And that's all I need.  And that's all I need, too. I don't need one other thing! Not one... I need this. The paddle game and the chair, and the remote control and the matches, for sure! Wh-what are you looking at? What do you think I am? Some kind of a jerk or something?  And this. That's all I need. The ashtray, the remote control and this paddle game, and this magazine and the chair.  And I don't need one other thing. Except my dog.  I don't need my dog. So, that's it. It's an old story. One you've probably heard before.  But I never thought it would happen to me.   Hey! Any of you bums ever heard of Navin R. Johnson? I've heard of him. Born in Mississippi? Uh-huh! Inventor of the Opti-Grab? I was just telling these guys. Son! Daddy! Navin. Mom! My baby! Navin. Elvira! I knew we'd find you. Taj! Don't kiss me.  I called them the night you left. How did you find me? I don't know. This is the first place we looked. We're takin' you home and you're gonna live with us. Turns out, Dad's a financial genius. All I did was take the money you sent home and embarked on a periodic investment, in a no-load mutual fund. He leveraged his ass deep into soy beans and cocoa futures. Right on! I picked out this thermos for you. I'd kiss you, but I'm so dirty. Dirt doesn't bother me. But the smell does. Oh, Navin.  Son, you'd better get in the back with the dog until we can get you hosed down.  I love you, Navin. I love you, too. Somebody open a window! Open all the windows. I was so glad to be going home. I remembered the days when I sang and danced with my family on the porch of the old house. But things change, and with all the additions to the family, we had to tear down the old house, even though we loved it. But we built us a bigger one.

Why are you so anxious about this? Because they're building a dam across the Cahulawasse River. They're gonna flood a whole valley, Bobby. They're drowning the river, man. - We're talkin' to you. - All right. Just about the last wild, untamed, unpolluted, unfucked-up river in the South. - Don't you understand? - We understand. There ain't gonna be no more river. Just gonna be a big, dead lake. It's a very clean way to make electric power. Those lakes provide many people with recreation. My father-in-law has a houseboat on Lake Bowie. You push a little more power into Atlanta... ... a little more air conditioners for your smug little suburb... ... and you know what's gonna happen? They're gonna rape this whole landscape. They're gonna rape it. - That's an extreme point of view, Lewis. - It is. Extremist. We're gonna leave Friday from Atlanta. I'm gonna have you back in your little suburban house... ... in time to see the football game on Sunday afternoon. I know you'll be back in time to see the pompom girls at halftime. I know that's all you care about. Lewis, I wanna thank you. Is there any hillbillies up here? Yeah, there's some people up there that ain't never seen a town before. No bigger than Aintry, anyway. Them, those woods, are real deep. The river's inaccessible, except at a couple of points. How we gonna get there, Lewis? I'm gonna take you there. What the hell do you know about canoein'? I know enough about canoein' to handle the both of you. I don't know what that means, but I'll go along with you. This is the last chance we got to see this river. Just wait until you feel that white water under you. - Ain't that right? - I don't know if I'm ready. If we are lost, I don't wanna hear about it. I've never been lost in my life. I'll have you in the water in another hour. Christ, Drew! Drew, look at the junk. Look here. I think this is where everything finishes up. We just may be at the end of the line. Hey, not so loud, Bobby. Let's not upset these people. People? What people? This area may be evacuated already. That's my '51 Dodge. No, that's my car. That's my car. All my youth and passion... ...spent in that back seat. It's all gone you see. All gone. Rust and dust. Lewis... ...we got a live one here. - Howdy. - Howdy. Let me ask you something. Are you from the power company? Power company? What power company? About the dam. No, no, no. Look, come here a minute. See that car there? We want somebody to drive 'em down to Aintry for us. Hell, you're crazy. No shit. Fill that one up with gas, okay? Say, mister... I love the way you wear that hat. You don't know nothin'. Lewis, just ask him about his hat. I don't think you understood me. I wanna get some drivers... ...to drive this car... ...and that car down to Aintry. You understand? You might get the Griner brothers. - Who? - The Griner brothers. Where do they live? They live back over that way. Right. Talk about genetic deficiencies. Isn't that pitiful? Who's pickin' the banjo here? Come on, I'm with you. I'm lost. I could play all day with that guy. I believe you could, too. I believe you could. - That's good. - That's very good, sir. Goddamn, you play a mean banjo. Hey, you wanna play another one? Give him a couple of bucks. Can that Chubby boy handle himself? Who? Bobby? He's rather well thought of in his field, Lewis. Insurance? I've never been insured in my life. I don't believe in insurance. There's no risk. I have some. Over here. Shit! God almighty! Anything we can do for you? No. It ain't as bad as I thought. Your name Griner? What do you wanna know for? Can you and your brother drive two cars down to Aintry for us? Drive 'em down there for what? Me and my buddy, we're gonna take a canoe trip down the Cahulawasse. We'd like to have them cars in Aintry when we get there. Be there by Sunday noon. Canoe trip? That's right, a canoe trip. What the hell you wanna go fuck around in that river for? Because it's there. It's there all right. You get in there and can't get out, you gonna wish it wasn't. Listen, Lewis, let's go back to town and... ...play golf. I'll give you $30 to take those cars down to Aintry. I'd take $50. $50, my ass. Lewis, don't play games with these people. What'd you say? I said, ""$50, my ass."" Lewis! I'll do it for $40. You good for $10? Sure. You got it. Brando! - Lewis, you guys all right? - All set. Brando, come on out! - We heard all this... - I said it's all set, Drew. This river cruise gonna happen or not? Just get in your car, huh? Lewis, for God's sake! You think we should let 'em show us to the river? If I thought that, I would have let them go first, Ed. We know about where it is. Here we go. Well, we fucked up. You better let them show us. You're missin' the whole point, Ed. Where are you goin', city boy? We'll find it. It's only the biggest fuckin' river in the state. We'll find it. Lewis, you son of a bitch, why do we have to go so damn fast? You're gonna like it. When you see the river, you're gonna like it. Jesus Christ! - Lewis. - Are you all right? Lewis, you are gonna kill us both, you son of a bitch... ...before we ever see any water. Slow it down, Lewis, come on. Come on, don't fool around. Listen, Ed. Listen. Hear it? Sometimes you have to lose yourself before you can find anything. Any snakes around here? This is the one. There she is. Looks good. A couple of more months and she'll all be gone. Even up as far as here? From Aintry on up. One big, dead lake. Over here! Couldn't we have found a harder place to get in? - This is steep here, now. - All right. - Watch yourself. - I'm watchin'. You're losin' glass on your bow. It's freezin'! Hell, it'll hold. What the hell are we gonna do... ...if we come off this river and our cars aren't there? They'll be there. They're rough-lookin' boys, them hillbillies. You judge people by the way they look. You can trust 'em. I'm goin' with you, Ed, and not with Mr. Lewis Medlock. I saw how he drives these country roads... ...he don't know nothin' about. I guess you're gonna be with me, Chubby. Get them supplies up there. It's cold! Put this on. Looks like my mama's corset or something. Here you go. Thank you. - Okay, let's go. - I'm comin'. Can't go in the water without your paddle, boy. I coulda went up the river without my oar. Shit! If we hit any strong water... ...instead of bare-assin' through it... - I'm ready. - Come on. - I'm comin' on. I got myself a plump partner here. We can save ourselves considerable hardship... ...if we just back water, talk it out before we make our move. You got that, boy? All right, put on your life jacket. Which way are we goin'? I think downstream would be a good idea, don't you? All right. You and Bobby see some rocks, you yell out now, right? Lewis, is this the way you get your rocks off? - Let's go. - Let's go. - Keep your eyes open, Drew. - I'll race you. Keep your eyes open, Robert. That a boy, that a boy. Every move you make, call it out. I'm behind you. Right. Here we go. See how fast we can shoot this bush. What is this? Is this some fast water we're comin' up to? All right, Drew, just get in behind Lewis there. Look at this! - Let's pick up some speed. - All right. Let's go. Just a little, there you have it. To the left. Hey, now, that didn't hurt too bad, did it? I'm with you, Ed. Now you got it, boy. Very good. Look, Ed. Well, for the Lord's sake, will you look at that? What do we do now? This is gonna be fun! Just follow us! Hey, what happens if we flip this thing over? Now that you brought that up, hang on to your paddle. And if you hit any rocks, don't hit 'em with your head. Watch Lewis. Maybe we can learn something. Back water now. Oh, yeah. Go right. Go right, go right. Go right, go right. - Look up ahead where you're goin'! - All right, I'm lookin'. Don't quit, don't quit. Come on, paddle, paddle. Okay! We did it! Are you gonna call them out now? - Right, go right. - Go right. All right, now left. Left, to your left. All right. - Keep it straight. - Watch that tree. - Left. - Watch your head. We ain't gonna make it! Turn it! Hey, this doesn't seem right. Just a little unorthodox. Go left, Chubby. Come on. Straighten it out. All right, I got it straight. Oh, my God! - Yes, thank you, Lord. - Turn it around. Hold it up there. Slow it down. All right, go. Go! Good, push straight ahead. Hell, here's a big one! We're gonna make it. Keep it straight. I'm with you, Ed! All right. You're doin' all right, now. Keep her headed right. Go, go, go... There's a rock! On the right, watch it now. - Okay, now. - I got it. All right now, Chubby, don't fall apart. What the hell I tell you? He's something else, ain't he? - Hold on. - I'll tell you, Lewis... ...that's the best, the second best sensation I ever felt. You did good, Chubby, you did good. Damn, I thought we'd bought the farm there for a while. You know that one place there... You know what I was just thinking? The first explorers saw this country... ...saw it just like us. In a canoe. I can imagine how they felt. Yeah, we beat it, didn't we? Didn't we beat that? You don't beat it. You don't beat this river. Machines are gonna fail. And the system's gonna fail. Then... And then what? Then survival. Who has the ability to survive. That's the game: Survive. And you can't wait for it to happen, can you? You can't wait for it. Well, the system's done all right by me. Oh, yeah. You got a nice job. Got a nice house... ...nice wife... ...nice kid. You make that sound... ...rather shitty, Lewis. Why do you go on these trips with me, Ed? I like my life, Lewis. Yeah, but why do you go on these trips with me? You know, sometimes I wonder about that. Here's to you, Lewis. Hot damn, he got one! Terrific, Lewis. I hate him. I'm glad we came here. Lewis? Lewis does not drink. It's true, Lewis, what you said. There's somethin' in the woods and the water that we have lost in the city. We didn't lose it, just sold it. Well, I'll say one thing for the system. System did produce the air mattress. Or, as it's better known among we camping types, the instant broad. And if you fellas will excuse me, I'm gonna go be mean to my air mattress. I do baptize thee now, in the name of modern technology. How sweet, yeah. Lewis? Does he think he is Tarzan, or what? He knows the woods, though. He really does. Not really. He learned 'em, he doesn't feel 'em. That's his problem. He wants to be one with nature and he can't hack it. This is a hell of a time to be tellin' us that. Jesus! Lewis, you scared the shit out of me! Oh, who was it, Lewis? I don't know. I thought I heard something. Something or someone? I don't know. Good night, Lewis. Good night, Drew. I'm goin' to sleep. Night has fallen. And there's nothin' we can do about it. I had my first wet dream in a sleepin' bag. How was it? Great. There's no repeatin' it. Never mind. No matter what disaster may occur in other parts of the world... ...or what petty little problems... ...arise in Atlanta... ...no one can find us up here. Good night, Lewis. Goddamn it! Hey, Bobby, look what came out of the forest. Get a shot, Ed? Hell, sometimes a man can... ...hunt for three years... ...never get a shot. Isn't that right, Lewis? - Right. I don't understand how anyone could shoot an animal. Some people never can, Drew. I've known tournament archers, damn good shots. Never out of the five ring. Draw down on a live animal and they get buck fever. What the hell's that? Loss of control, psychological. Who gives a shit? You take that Chubby boy with you today, okay? Hope we can get off this river today. Don't get too far ahead, now. No, we'll be takin' it slow. Easy, easy, my man. I got eaten alive last night. My bites have got bites. I'm a salesman, Ed. Good morning. I'm not mad at you, Ed. Just do me a favor, don't holler at me. I'm not used to bein' hollered at. Damn friend of yours screamed at me all day long yesterday. Paddle, you son of a bitch. Look! What in the hell are Lewis and Drew doin' up there anyway? Probably they're doin' the same thing we are. Bobby? How goes it? What the hell you think you're doing? Headin' downriver. Little canoe trip. Headin' for Aintry. Aintry? Sure, this river only runs one way, Captain. Haven't you heard? You ain't never gonna get down to Aintry. Why not? 'Cause. This river don't go to Aintry. You done taken the wrong turn. See, this here river don't go nowhere near Aintry. Where does it go then? Boy, you are lost. Well, hell, I guess this river comes out somewhere, don't it? That's where we're going, somewhere. Look, we don't want any trouble here. If you gentlemen have a still near here, that's fine with us. Why sure. We'd never tell anybody where it is. You know something? You're right, we're lost. - We don't know where in the hell we are. - A still? Right, yeah, you're makin' whiskey up here. We'll buy some. We could use it. Do you know what you're talkin' about? We don't know what you're talking about. You said something about makin' whiskey. Ain't that what you said? We don't know what you're doing, and we don't care. That's none of our business. That's right, none of your goddamn business. We've got quite a long journey ahead of us, gentlemen... Hold it. You ain't going no damn where! This is ridiculous. Excuse me. Hold it, or I'll blow your guts out all over these woods. Wait, we can talk this thing over. What is it you require of us? Well, we require that you get your goddamn ass up in them woods. - All right, now, look. - Right now! You get up there now. Okay, all right. - Get up there. - All right. Faster, boy. - Move your ass. - Easy with the weapon! You shut up. - Come on. - Okay. - Back here. - What's the trouble? - You're in trouble. - Just don't argue with 'em, Ed. - See that saplin' over yonder? - You heard him. Back up against this. Is this a matter of money? If we want money, we'll take it. - Back up against the tree. - I'm pretty far back against it now. Now, stay just there. Now, be real still. If he tries that again, shoot that one there. I'll blow his damned balls off. You ain't a big boy. Be still now. Now let's you just drop them pants. Drop? Just take 'em right off! I mean, what's this all about? Don't say anything, just do it. Just drop 'em, boy! You ever had your balls cut off, you fuckin' ape? Lord. Look there, that's sharp. I bet it'd shave a hair. Why don't you try it and see? Lord. Deliver us from all... Pull off that little bitty shirt there, too. Is he bleeding? He bled. Them panties, take 'em off. Get up, boy! Come on, get on up there. No, no, no. Oh, no. Don't. - Don't. - Hey, boy. - You look just like a hog. - No, don't. Just like a hog. Come here, piggy, piggy, piggy. Come on, piggy. Come on, piggy. Come on, piggy, give me a ride. - Get up and give me a ride. - All right. - Get up and give me a ride. - All right. - Get up! Get up there! - All right. Oh, no, no. Looks like we got us a sow here instead of a boar. Don't! Don't! What's the matter, boy? I bet you squeal. I bet you can squeal like a pig. Let's squeal. Squeal now. Squeal. Squeal. Squeal louder. Louder. Louder. Louder. Louder! Louder! Get down now, boy! There, get them britches down. That's that. You can do better than that, boy. Come on, squeal. Squeal! What's you wanna do with him? He got a real pretty mouth, ain't he? That's the truth. You're gonna do some prayin' for me, boy. And you better pray good. Here, hold that on him. You better run, you son of a bitch! Can't we do anything for him? No. It's a center shot. I thought they'd surely kill us. They would have. They would have for sure. What we gonna do with him? There's not but one thing to do: Take the body down to Aintry. Turn it over to the highway patrol. Tell 'em what happened. Tell 'em what, exactly? Just what happened. This is justifiable homicide if anything is. They were sexually assaulting two members of our party at gunpoint. Like you said, there was nothin' else we could do. Is he alive? Not now. Well, let's get our heads together. Come on, let's not do anything foolish. Anybody know anything about the law? I was on jury duty once. It wasn't a murder trial. Murder trial? I don't know the technical word for it, Drew, but I know this: You take this man and turn him over to the sheriff, there'll be a trial all right. Trial by jury. So what? We killed a man, Drew. Shot him in the back. A mountain man. Cracker. Gives us somethin' to consider. All right, consider it. We're listening. Shit, all these people are related. I'll be damned if I'll come back and stand trial... ...with this man's aunt and uncle... ...maybe his mama and his daddy sittin' in the jury box. What do you think, Bobby? How about you, Ed? I don't know. I really don't know. Now you listen, Lewis. I don't know what you got in mind... ...but if you conceal this body, you'll be charged with murder. That much law I do know. This ain't one of your fuckin' games! You killed somebody! There he is! I see him, Drew. That's right, I killed somebody. But you're wrong if you don't see this as a game. Now you listen, Ed! Damn it, we can get out of this thing! Without any questions asked! We get connected up with that body and the law... ...this thing's gonna be hangin' over us the rest of our lives. We gotta get rid of that guy. Just how are you gonna do that, Lewis? Where? Anywhere. Everywhere. Nowhere. How do you know that other guy hasn't already gone for the police? What in the hell is he gonna tell 'em, Drew? What he did to Bobby? Why couldn't he go get some other mountain men? Now why isn't he gonna do that? You look around you, Lewis! He could be out there anywhere, watchin' us right now. We ain't gonna be so goddamned hard to follow, draggin' a corpse. You let me worry about that, Drew. You let me take care of that. You know what's gonna be here? Right here. A lake. As far as you can see. Hundreds of feet deep. Hundreds of feet deep. Did you ever look over a lake... ...and think about somethin' buried underneath it? Buried underneath it! Man, that's about as buried as you can get! Well, I am telling you, Lewis, I don't want any part of it. Well, you are part of it! It is a matter of the law! The law? The law? What law? Where's the law, Drew? You believe in democracy, don't you? Yes, I do. Well, then, we'll take a vote. I'll stand by it. So will you. What do you say, Bobby? Let's bury him. I don't want this gettin' around. Okay? Okay? It's up to you, Ed. It's all up to you, Ed. Now just think what you're doin', Ed. For God's sake. You got a wife. You got a child. You're not involved in this. Think about your family, Ed. This may be the most important decision of your whole life, Ed. Yes! There's no way we can change this. There's no way we can change what happened to Bobby. We gotta do the right thing. We must live with it for the rest of our lives. Right! I'm with Lewis. All right, let's get on with it, then. Lewis. Let's go. What's the plan, Lewis? Plan? We just paddle on down to Aintry, get the cars and go home. Put your jacket on, Drew. Drew! Put your life jacket on! Drew, paddle! Drew! Drew? Drew, what's the matter? Lewis, somethin's wrong. To the side. Something's wrong! No! Go on! What is it? Don't stop, Ed! - I'm gonna pull in. - Go! Go! What happened? Look out! Where's Drew? My leg's broke. Where's Drew? I'm takin' roll call! Drew was shot! Somethin' happened to him. What? Drew was shot. Shot? Here, here. Hold him here. - I got him. - Hold on! Drew was shot! Bobby, Drew was shot! He was shot, Bobby! Drew was shot! Here's his jacket! He wasn't wearin' it! Maybe Lewis is right! Of course, he's right. Of course! You mean that other guy shot him? Did he? Did you see him? Drew was shot. Lewis says that other guy... ...that toothless bastard, shot him! He's right up there! He's gonna try and kill us, too! If he killed Drew... ...he's gonna have to kill us! Lewis, I'll tell you what. We'll wait until dark, and we'll put you in the bottom of the canoe... ...and we'll sneak out of here. - Okay, Ed? - Bobby, look at those rapids down there! - Look at those rapids! - Christ! We can't move out of here in the dark. We're not gonna move you, Lewis. Lewis, we're trapped in this gorge. What're we gonna do, Lewis? You're the guy with the answers. What the hell do we do now? Now you get to play the game. You're ruined! Lewis, you're ruined! Listen. He's hurt bad, isn't he? What're we gonna do? The guy must know exactly where we are. Well, if he knows where we are... ...then we sure as hell know where he's gonna be. Right up there. Christ! What a view! Goddamn it! You'll never get out of this gorge alive! Goddamn it! Pull yourself together. Release. I don't believe it! You did it, Ed. You killed him! Good. Lewis had a bad night. More than once I thought he'd die. You did it, Ed. Good. You sure it's him? That's the guy with the gun, huh? I think so. He wasn't just some guy... ...up there huntin' or something? - You tell me! Was he shot? What about here? What about right there? Could have been a rock. What are you gonna do with Drew? If a bullet made this, there are people who can tell. Oh, God! There's no end to it. I didn't really know him. Drew was... ...a good husband... ...to his wife Linda. You're a wonderful father to your boys, Drew... ...Jimmy and Billy Ray. And if... ...we come through this, I promise... ...to do all I can for 'em. He was the best of us. Amen. Christ! Look at that! God help us. We made it. We made it, Ed. We made it. - We're back, Ed! - Yeah. - We gotta get Lewis to a doctor. - Right, Ed. Gotta get Lewis to a doctor. We're back! We made it! Everything happened... Listen, everything happened right here. Everything happened right here. Lewis broke his leg in those rapids there. - And Drew drowned here. In this place. - No, no, Ed. - No, nothin' happened here. - Bobby, listen to me! We got to stop them from lookin' upriver. It's important that we get together on this thing. You understand? I understand, Eddie, I understand. That's right, Lewis. That's our story. Lewis, we're back. - It's all right. - Get Lewis to a doctor. All right, Ed. All right. We'll find a place to put it. We're not out of this yet! They brought the cars. You come for the cars, sir? Yes. Do you have a phone? Phone? Telephone? Yes, sir. You're gonna be all right. What in the world happened to you guys? Drew Ballinger. Did you look for him? A long time. Could you show us where it happened? How'd you manage to shoot yourself with your own arrow? Didn't think it could be done. This is nice. What's that? Chromium, paper tissues... ...hot water... That's nice. You fallin' asleep? Don't forget to phone your wife. Let her know how you are. Yes, I will, thank you. Hello. Come on in. We saved you a seat. Do you feel like eating something? Please. Some corn? Would you like some peas? This corn is special, isn't it? I love good corn. We need that cucumber I got out of the garden last night. You know how long it was? - Tell me. - Twelve-and-a-half inches long. Then I measured it around, and it's ten-and-a-half around. That's the darndest lookin' cucumber you'll ever see. I tell you, I'll send it over and let you see it, if you doubt it. I think you're crazy sometimes. We can show you the place. Now I know where you told me it was. We just wanna cooperate. You recognize that piece of canoe? Now, we lost one. That could be it. But you ain't sure? Yeah, I think so, but it's kind of confusing. I'd think you'd recognize your own canoe. I'd appreciate it if you'd show me that spot. Ed, we're in trouble. They don't believe us! What did you tell him, Bobby? What we agreed on. I heard you. I was in that room, Bobby. What did you tell him? They found part of the green canoe, right? Upstream, and you got scared. Didn't you, Bobby? I know you. You told him the truth, didn't you, Bobby? - You told him the truth! - I didn't do that! I told 'em... ...like we said. But I don't think they believed me. Ed, I think they found that other canoe... ...upstream, above where we told him. I never said that. Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. - I know damn well you did. I know what I said. Yeah, well, that's a goddamn lie. Sheriff, that ain't what he said this morning. You tell me how a canoe can drift upriver. Now what about this? Look, Sheriff... ...we been through quite a lot. I don't know what's wrong with your man there. Mr. Queen's got a brother-in-law... ...back up in there somewhere. He took off huntin' three days ago and... ...nobody's heard from him since. Mr. Queen thought maybe you all... ...might've happened up on him somewhere. Well, we didn't. Don't let 'em go. These boys is lying. We got nothin' to hold 'em for. We don't have a thing. Let's just wait and see what comes out of the river. That there's the town hall. Right over there's the old fire station. Played a lot of checkers over there. All this land's gonna be covered with water. Best thing that ever happened to this town. We may have to stop just a minute for the church to get out of the way. Christ. Doctor, how's our boy? We're doin' everything we can for him. But there's a chance he might lose the leg, so take it easy on him, okay? I'll talk with you later. Officer? Has he been awake yet? No, we're still waitin' for him to come around. Lewis, listen, we had to change our story. How you feeling? Never better. Did you hear me? What happened on that last set of rapids? I don't remember nothing. Nothing. - Want me to drive Drew's car back? - No. Talk to his wife? I'll do it, Bobby, thank you. You all about ready to leave? Yeah. The Griner boys brought these cars down to you from Orie, is that right? Right. You happen to see another man with 'em up there? There was someone, wasn't there? I think so, yes. Before you go, buddy, let me ask you something. How come you all ended up with four life jackets? Didn't we have an extra one? No. Drew wasn't wearin' his. Well, how come he wasn't wearin' it? I don't know. Don't ever do nothin' like this again. Don't come back up here. You don't have to worry about that, Sheriff. I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful. I hope Deputy Queen finds his brother-in-law. He'll come in drunk probably. Good-bye, Ed. 'Bye, Bobby. I don't think I'll see you for a while. Hey, Charlie. What you got there, guy? What's the matter? It's all right. It's all right. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

aw. ahem. yay! ha ha ha! you want to know something? at my age, in any other business, i'd be young. look at it this way-- soon you can get into another business and have a real life. yeah? yeah. i don't know what that means. this is the only business i know. i'm stuck. what do you mean, stuck? i've been working my whole life to get a chance to do something, and... i don't know if i'm ever going to get a chance to do it. hey. no, it's all right. i'm going to fix your neck. don't do that, joe. wait a minute. wait. oh! how's that? oh, boy. yeah, but it scares the hell out of me every time you do that. if you don't pay more attention to how your trapezius goes up into your deltoids, you're going to throw off your entire cervical and your lumbar areas. only i can fix it. you ought to start listening to me. maybe you ought to trade places. you be the trainer. i'll start on sunday. yeah...what? i'm starting against dallas? they don't want to go with jarrett. they want to go with you. happy birthday, joe.      hey, my watch stopped. look at that. it keeps flashing the same time. i'm dreaming, huh? well, i... hey... this is an airplane dream. i forget what they're supposed to mean. i think they're a good sign, aren't they? mr. pendleton. mr. pendleton, you must wait for me. i'm your escort. wait for me, please, mr. pendleton. the end of the line, mr. pendleton, please. hi. how you doing? hey, you want to hear a little music? you have to wait in line. what? this is my dream, isn't it? you mustn't get out of line. really! chamberlain, paul r. all right. i think i've brought the, uh... i've escorted the final-- asterisk this manifest as complete. hi. you cannot board before your turn. i don't need a turn. i'm not boarding. i don't think you understand. this isn't your ultimate destination. this is a way station. that will take you to your ultimate destination. i'm not going. i'm going to run around till i wake up. i'm afraid i haven't fully explained the basis on which this system is organized. this way station's rules derived from yours. they're a product of your image and the image of those who share your image. violate the rules, question the principles-- you want to see a trick? i do this once in a while to keep my abductor pollicis limber. you want to feel that? that's a perfectly solid 50-cent piece. i just throw that into that hand, you see. i say the magic words, abracadabra. and then presto, it's gone. you probably think i still have it. you're wrong, 'cause i can see it coming out of your ear. that's the only trick i know. mr. pendleton! gentlemen. gentlemen, what's the delay? sir, we've received a new arrival who refuses to board. but that's impossible. have you explained the rules to him? yes, sir. quite clearly? yes, sir. and what was his rebuttal? he took a coin out of my ear. did he? perhaps i should have a word with him. yes, sir. mr. pendleton! he's right over there, sir. mr. pendleton! yeah. hey, you can call me joe. how you doing? mr. pendleton, you know where you are, don't you? i'm in the middle of a really weird dream. you see the problem? joe, come here. look at me and listen carefully to what i'm saying. yeah? this is not a dream. yeah. life has a certain quality all its own, a certain feeling, and so do dreams. you know that this is not life, and you know now that this is not a dream. this is a place that comes after life and after dreams. i'm sure you're aware of that and that you'll take your place with the others. are you trying to tell me... i'm not supposed to be here. but you are here. well, you guys made a mistake. this is insupportable. you're talking to mr. jordan. anybody can make a mistake. mr. jordan, we're due to take off. yes, i have the situation in hand. joe, if you don't take your place, the others can't complete their journey. do you think that's fair? if this is really heaven, you're supposed to be fair. i didn't make any mistake. this is not heaven. it's a way station. there is no mistake. i want a check-out on joseph pendleton. when is he due to arrive at this way station? sir, i don't understand. a check-out? why? the likelihood of one individual being right increases in direct proportion to the intensity with which others are trying to prove him wrong. pendleton, joseph-- due to arrive march 20th of the year 2025. sir, i really can't believe it. i-- i took him out--i-- i took him out just before the accident. you did what? that car couldn't have missed him. you're supposed to wait for the outcome. but i was so sure, and it looked like it would be painful. wait. are you saying-- is this your first assignment as an escort? yes, sir. haven't you learned the rules of probability and outcome? every question of life and death remains a probability until the outcome. so he jumped the gun. put me back where you found me, and we'll forget the whole thing. this man must be put back into his body at once. yeah. thanks, mr. jordan. hey, i'll see you in about 50 years. hey, hey, max. max, i'm back. i'm back. he can't hear you, mr. pendleton. i hope they got... the best football team in america in heaven, and i hope god makes you first-string. aw... max, i'm going to get my body back. where's my body? where do they keep-- oh, dear. cremated. i see. i'm starting against dallas on sunday. joe, the body you occupied on earth has been cremated. well, uncremate me, that's all. you must be able to do something right. does ""not being a good sport"" mean anything to you? joe, we can put you into another man's body, provided his death has not yet been discovered. are you kidding? put me into another man's body? i just got my body back in shape. joe, the only way you can return to life is in the body of another man. i shall have to take charge of this case personally. incredibly graceful. he's about your age and in perfect condition. he's too short. he'd never see over the line. aah! aah! you know what kind of shape you gotta be in to get to the super bowl? yes, joe. i understand.  he's not talking english. i told you he was german. hey, you talk any english? we can't be seen or heard, joe. well, i don't want to talk german.  i got to be able to call plays in english. joe, if you could not so much lower but broaden your standards. we've seen many bodies, and the choices are becoming limited. julia, please, i beg of you. i want a drink. there's plenty-- i've got to have a drink. no, no, no. mr. farnsworth loathes cold cucumber soup. hey, this is some house. who lives here? leo farnsworth, a man of enormous power. we should make the arrangement later this afternoon. thank you, sisk. just leave the door open as you leave, sisk. thank you very much. the more servants who see us, the better. joe: this guy? are you kidding? jordan: that's not farnsworth. give me a drink. don't drink. who are they? farnsworth's wife and his confidential secretary. you hate me. don't be ridiculous. i love you. i want a drink! tony-- it would be better if you didn't drink. how long will it be before they find him? i don't know, darling. it shouldn't be long, my dearest. i'm glad we did it. we couldn't help it. julia, it would be better if you'd try not to unravel now. thank you, julia. is farnsworth dead yet? not yet. what's the matter with him? he can't keep his eyes open. he's been drugged by those two downstairs. this is a murder. you see how he's slowly sliding into the water? hey, somebody, get-- hey, hey, get a doctor. there's a guy-- hey, get a doctor. you got a guy drowning in the bathtub. you left a bare pot on the carpet. i can't hold everything at once. mrs. farnsworth would kill you if she saw that. hey, somebody! you got, uh-- give me a drink. i'd like a drink! try not to go overboard, dear. he was a lecherous, sadistic son of a bitch. everyone wanted him dead. i should be canonized! perhaps one drink. woman: where can the man be? sisk: i'm sorry, miss logan. what harm can that do him? julia: we did it, but that man deserves to be dead. tony: please. joe: they're murderers. what's going on out there? i'm sorry, sir. it's that miss logan here to see mr. farnsworth. show her in. yes, sir. oh, my god. no. it's the perfect alibi. she insists on seeing him. let's look for another body. a servant will find the body. keep sisk with you at all times to establish your whereabouts. let's get out of here. sisk: miss logan, sir. oh, miss logan. i'm tony abbott. this is the library. that's mrs. farnsworth. hello. i'm going into the living room. want to come, sisk? oh, yes. certainly, madam. i'm mr. farnsworth's personal and private executive secretary. i didn't know whether you knew that. i'm sorry he's not down yet. that's all right. i'll wait. would you take a seat? no, thank you. perhaps you'd like to tell me what it's about. mr. farnsworth has been sent hundreds of letters from a town in england called pagglesham. the people who live there-- 1,600, including my father-- are about to be forcibly evicted from their homes to make way for the proposed exo-grey refinery. not only will hundreds of families be forced to find other homes, but the few who remain will have their health endangered by the inevitable poisoning of their air and water, the documented evidence for which i have here, along with a petition signed by the 1,673 citizens of that area. this is what i'm here to see mr. farnsworth about. you're aware mr. farnsworth conducts business at his office? i've been to his office. he refused to see me. i seriously doubt he'd see you here. he'll have to, because i'm not leaving. i'm sorry? i'm not leaving. i've come 8,000 miles, mr. abbott, to do something about a terrible injustice that this man leo farnsworth has perpetrated on hundreds of innocent, defenseless people. somebody ought to help her. you can help her, joe. you can be farnsworth. if mr. farnsworth doesn't see me, i don't know what i'll do. tony: is that a threat? yes. i don't want to be farnsworth. the decision is yours. miss logan, you give me no choice. sisk! if i had to be farnsworth, could we do it temporary? yes. we could arrange that if you wish it. sisk! sisk, please tell mr. farnsworth miss logan is here and refuses to leave. yes, sir. if you really want to help her, you'd better hurry. well, it's only temporary, right? that's correct. only farnsworth can help her. once the body's discovered, it'll be too late. hey. that's me. i haven't changed. it's just me. sisk: mr. farnsworth? now what do we do? mr. farnsworth, are you there, sir? i'll never get away with this. what will we do now? are you all right? answer him. people can hear me now? of course. but he knows the other guy's voice. mr. farnsworth, is everything all right in there? answer him. ahem. um, will you take it easy? i'll be out in a minute. very good, sir. it works. of course. inwardly, you haven't changed. you're still joe pendleton. that's what you and i see. but outwardly, you're leo farnsworth, and that's what everyone else will see. miss betty logan is downstairs, sir. she insists upon seeing you. do you wish to dress, sir? oh, uh, sure, sure. very good, sir. you mean i'm going to sound like this guy, no matter what i talk like? i beg your pardon, mr. farnsworth? you see? ha ha ha ha. heh heh heh heh. well... ahh. whoa. julia, julia, julia, please, please, dear. please, dear, not now. not now. i want a sip. you're sorry you helped, aren't you? you wish he were alive. why don't you say it's not true? you didn't say it's not true. it's not true. say it again. darling, darling, it's not true. i don't hate you. i love you. there, sir. thank you. thank you. ahem. your helmet, sir. huh? your polo helmet, sir. oh, thanks. thanks. uh, do i play polo? oh, not really, sir. sir? thank you. thank you. this logan girl is a godsend. what's taking so long? pick up the fountainhead. pretend you're reading. lavinia: right. all right. corinne: you go up. all right. miss logan, sir. hi. how you doing? i'm not leaving until you've heard what i have to say. uh, oh, yeah. well, good. you've been sent hundreds of letters from a town in england called pagglesham. i know about that situation. have you read the letters? well... uh... well, no. no, you haven't. i suspected as much. that's why i've flown over here. i and the 1,673 people whom i represent and whose names are on this petition are not going to allow their futures to be determined by mindless bureaucrats at the beck and call of certain so-called industrialists for whom elderly men and women and children are just figures to be entered in your ledgers' profit and loss column. do i make myself clear? yeah, but-- there are no buts. you can have me dragged out. it would be bad publicity for exo-grey industries. why don't you just sit down? i prefer to stand. we can stand up. i've made it my business to find out about exo-grey industries. facts that would make interesting newspaper copy. ah. well... your tea, mr. farnsworth. oh, right. uh, yeah. my--my--my tea. uh... anything else, mr. farnsworth? uh, no. i think that's about it. uh, thanks a lot. thank you. uh, you want some tea? i want to know what you're going to do about pagglesham. pagglesham! pagglesham! it's what we're talking about! these people care very much that their community doesn't become destroyed in the name of free enterprise. they care because they are a community where hundreds of families have lived for generations. i know. these people are not going to allow you to intimidate and frighten them. i don't frighten anybody. aah! aah! aah! aah! aah! aah! mmmf! mmmf! oh, my god! what in god's name is that? well, that-- that was m-- uh, my-- my mrs. farnsworth.  sorry to disturb you, mr. farnsworth. mrs. farnsworth saw a mouse, but she's better now. she just saw a mouse? no. before. outside. but she relives it. i'll be in the other room if you need me, sir. excuse me. what's the matter with her? well, listen, uh... i don't know. it's really none of my business. your wife's none of your business? wait. you don't understand. i understand one thing. we will never allow you to build that refinery. all right. i'll build my refinery in some other place. very funny. if you think i'm going back to pagglesham, you're wrong. i know you're not afraid of me. you think a schoolteacher from a small town is no challenge for a world-famous industrialist. will you please listen? just be quiet a minute. just let me say one thing. what is it? sit down. why? if you'd just sit down, i think i can explain something to you that'll clear this whole thing up. i'm not really leo farnsworth. what? my name is joe. very funny, mr. farnsworth. i'm sure you enjoy playing these insulting little games. however, i happen to know about your board meeting on thursday, which may mean nothing to you, but if you think you can treat women with the same contempt your company treats the world, you've got a lot to learn about the strength and persistence of people like myself. don't think you're going to get away with this. you got till that board meeting on thursday to find me a body that can play quarterback.  darling, i'm going to let you go. i'm going to let you go now. listen. there is nothing to be frightened of. there's plenty to be worried about, but there is nothing to be frightened of. are you all right? can i trust you? yes, dearest? hmm. hmm. you locked me in a closet. only for a moment. what did you tell him? you saw a mouse. i'm not good at spur- of-the-moment alibis. he's probably got enough evidence to lock us away forever. i don't understand this. i saw him inhale the nose spray. he never really inhaled it. he overheard us somehow. maybe he's got us bugged right now. an electronics expert sweeps the place daily. he's afraid of being bugged, too. he's playing with us. he's playing a game with us, that's what it is. you locked me in a closet. why? aah! aah! hello. mr. farnsworth would like to see you now. yes, indeed. yes. would you excuse me, mrs. farnsworth? yes, of course, mr. abbott. we could take it up at the board meeting, but i'm sure it's legal. can't you do something legal and be wrong? in what sense? bad for somebody else. what are you referring to? like this refinery in pagglesham.  was that the living room? no. that was my office. my coordination is shot, huh? yes, sir. just not my day. no, sir. i wanted to discuss the haitian arrangement, the 2 1/2 million acres. what 2 1/2 million acres? the sugar deal. it's no good. the deal? no. sugar. it's bad for the body. want me to speak to the haitian ambassador? check on that pagglesham thing. see if we're hurting anybody. if we're hurting anybody? yeah. is the wicket bugged? we certainly wouldn't want to hurt anybody. that's the last thing exo-grey would ever want to do, isn't that right? yeah. we don't want to hurt anybody. thank you. ah. ""pagglesham."" he pretended not to know what a stockholder was. i can't tell whether he's toying with me or if he'd precipitate a crisis in the company. of course he's toying. think he'll forget being drugged? why would he pretend? for the same reason he pretended to inhale the nose spray--to bait us. he's waiting for us to crack. do you actually think he's playing that saxophone? there's a tape inside. that's why we hear the same song over and over. it's like those idiot costumes of his. you are dumb, aren't you? thanks. thank you. tv: their magic number is now just one, meaning a ram victory sunday or next week against the falcons or a 49er loss, and the rams clinch the nfl western division title. the way they've been playing, the team feels this is the rams' year to go to the super bowl. jarrett has completed an astounding 62% of his passes for 18 touchdowns. the defense has given up but 10 points a game, while the offense is scoring 21 points a game. the rams' record is the best... what you're saying is that, um... nobody should have that information, because if 2 big companies get together, they're worth more money, huh? yes, sir. that's why the rumor of a merger makes the price of the stock rise. if it's supposed to be a secret, how does the rumor start? well, sir, wrong as it seems, they leak it. but that's dishonest, isn't it? yes, it is. well... if i got a board meeting tomorrow, i got to do a lot of studying tonight. yes, sir. how you doing down there? oh, i'm doing fine. thank you very much. yeah? thanks. thanks a lot. say, uh, thanks for dinner. i think we should do it right away. sisk, may we have some more coffee, please?  and now for your hat, sir. do you wish the homburg or the bowler, sir, or something that makes more of a statement? whatever you say. why have i got so many of these sailor outfits? oh, sir, you have always fancied the sea. uh-huh. do i sail?  not really, sir. uh-huh. ok, ok. mr. farnsworth, i'm helen rich from the times. i've this petition from the citizens of pagglesham. do you plan to do anything about it? we're taking that under consideration. we really have to be going. mr. farnsworth, is it true that 3 newly proposed exo-grey factories will displace 11 communities? is it that many? they granted the permits to build them. i guess so, if we got 'em. how did exo-grey get those permits? beats me. i guess we bribed somebody. he's joking. really, we must be going. mr. farnsworth, what about acrilonitrile? what about what? acrilonitrile-- the toxic substance released by the plastic bottles your company markets despite the consumer protection league's lawsuit forcing you to delay distribution until the effects have been tested. i've been studying this thing. why don't you come inside and see what's going on yourselves? you can't have outsiders-- sure, we can. come on in, everybody. joe: hi. hi. how you doing, everybody? i, uh... these people are reporters from some of the newspapers. i thought it would be good if they saw how we did things. leo, this is a very dangerous precedent. we have a very full agenda today already. i don't see that we have time for a press-- couldn't an accident in your west coast nuclear plant stimulate seismic activity in the san andreas fault, which could destroy most of southern california? i think you'd have to define ""destroy."" excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. i'd like to make something perfectly clear. the exo-grey nuclear facility has a foolproof built-in safety system that guarantees no danger of any kind. that's rubbish. if there's no danger, why are we in a lawsuit? it's a protest, not a lawsuit. that's not the point. we're doing something wrong. everybody's suing us. we got a lawsuit from a refinery, a nuclear lawsuit. a guy named porpoise is suing us. uh, mr. farnsworth, that's an ecological suit brought against our canning factory for destroying porpoises. ahem. uh... for god's sake, he knows that. we can porpoises? our san diego fleet is... as everybody here knows, we can tuna. in netting the tuna, we kill a number of porpoises. since they're mammals of alleged high intelligence, there's been an outcry. yeah...well... uh... yeah. uh... yeah. i would just like to ask you a question. why is he bringing the press in here? you know leo farnsworth. maybe i don't know leo farnsworth. exactly. we have a corporate responsibility extending to thousands of shareholders of moderate means, people who are less well off than the ecological groups fighting us. if we were a football team, would you say we had a winning season so far? leo, i haven't the faintest idea what you're-- just generally. would you say we got a winning season? i would say on balance we have had an extremely good year. we've got a winning season. what do you do when you're ahead in the game? i don't know what you want. i'll tell you, you don't make mistakes. you don't gamble unnecessarily. you got to protect your lead. you don't pass from your own end zone. you make sure nobody gets hurt. you got to use these guys in the next game. we won this game. we got to stay in shape for the rest of the game. that's the responsible thing to do. it's like when everybody was supposed to stop eating grapes. i didn't 'cause i didn't know about it. a lot of guys will keep eating tuna. but i was thinking, what if we had a good-guy tuna company on the porpoise team? guys would buy that so kids wouldn't get mad at them. i don't think they're taking in account... the expense. we don't care how much it costs, just how much it makes. if it costs too much, we charge a penny more. would you pay more to save fish who thinks? and we handle all the lawsuits that way. let other teams build power plants in the wrong places. let the other quarterback throw a gurgle out so newspapers get ahold of it. let's be the team that makes the rules. let us be the team that plays fair. let's be the popular players. we'll have to forget these nuclear power plants until we know they're safe. that refinery in pagglesham, we'll have to relocate it. it'll cost us $35 million, but we're going to come out ahead. whatever that stuff is we're making, that plastic, we'll have to stop. we're not in here for just one game, are we? we're going all the way. let's get to the super bowl! when we get there, let's already have won! hi. how you doing? oh, just fine. thank you. very well. mm-hmm. i'm just... what is happening? tv: ...and give the rams home field advantage through the playoffs and the super bowl. this super bowl is set for the coliseum. if he weren't going to be dead soon, he'd need years of psychiatric help. let's do it tonight. tv: the rams will probably face dallas in the opening round of the playoffs. if they win-- mr. pendleton. hey! tv: ...championship on the 26th. am i glad to see you. line up any bodies yet? we haven't got a lot of time-- uh...the, uh... tv: ...and only 4 measly field goals. uh, hi. i--i'm just... tv: they're home against cincinnati... what's up? we have a number of interesting probabilities. i kept my word to betty logan. did you find a body in good shape? i want to see some bodies. ahem. joe: somebody with good legs, good arms. the super bowl's coming up. you must have checked a lot of bodies-- who is it? it's sisk, sir. come in, sisk. sorry to disturb you, mr. farnsworth, but miss betty logan is downstairs and asks if she might have a moment of your time. betty l-- uh... tell her i'll be right down. ah. very good, sir. do you, uh... do you wish the door closed, sir? uh... closed is fine. thank you. do the best you can do. i got to see what she wants. hi. um... mr. farnsworth, i don't know what you must think of me after my behavior at our first meeting, but i feel i must tell you what an extraordinary thing it is you did today. you don't have to say-- no, it's... because i--i-- you know what? uh... you look a little pale. you want something to eat? i'll be right back. bentley. everett. miss logan's going to have dinner with us, so put on another plate. whip up a liver and whey shake. where you going? oh, i thought... you thought i meant to go out. sisk, we're going out. come on. bentley! everett! we're going out and eat. which hat would you prefer? look, i don't want to wear a hat. i'm sick of hats. don't show me any more hats. yes, sir. no more hats. it's, uh... do you eat here often? are you--nah, look... i didn't think you'd want people to see you out with a guy like me. i see.  p.a.: pick up 24. pick up 28. i'm sorry. i just can't stop staring at you. i seem to be staring at you, too. even when i was trying to hate you, i couldn't help seeing something else, something... what? in your eyes. does that sound silly? when you see something like that, it doesn't matter what a person looks like or who they are or anything. what is it? this isn't what i thought was going to happen to me. listen, i got to talk to somebody right away. would you mind if i took you home? uh... i, uh... good night. good--good night. oh, hey, by the way, i'm getting a divorce. but you and your wife aren't even separated. oh, sure, we are. it's a big house. oh. hey! how you doing, bentley? fine, sir. mr. pendleton? oh. hi. uh... i don't want that body we've been talking about. something happened tonight. this is an outrage. we've gone to enormous difficulties to find you an athlete. i wanted it, but that was before. something happened with betty logan. i changed my mind, that's all. i'll get farnsworth's body into shape. i'll get corkle to help me... back in there, eh? oh, yes. joe: i can do it. i know more about getting into shape than anybody. so hold up on that body. hold up on the body? tell mr. jordan not to worry about it. thank him. i'm very sorry. i want to get into shape with this body. you leave me speechless. i have nothing to say to that. i can't even think how to retort to something as ridiculous as turning down a body we've gone to such extremes to find, and an athlete at that, in prime condition. i don't know what to say. what do i do with his cocoa? i don't want to disturb him, but it'll get cold. i notice there are 2 cups. sisk felt since he was pretending to talk to somebody, he might want to pretend to give him cocoa, too. hey, how you doing, everett? how you doing, bentley?  hurry up. hurry up. wait a minute. just a minute, please. all right. i'm sorry to bother you, but we don't love each other, so let's get divorced. leo, i don't know what you're talking about. come on. yes, you do. abbott, there's a trainer for the rams named max corkle. could you call and ask him to come see me? tony: yes, mr. farnsworth. thank you. good night. you idiot! you idiot! why did you answer him? i couldn't resist. his will is too strong. tv: that's our weekend forecast. now here's bryant gumbel with tonight's sports. leach and char will have to-- he's dead. it's over with. tv: ...left for philadelphia this morning, hoping to play their last road-- at last, at last. at last, my dearest. it's incredible.  yes! just a minute. yes! yes, sisk. and, uh, abbott, corkle's number is 654-1654. yes, mr. farnsworth. ok. oh, my god. right this way. mr. farnsworth is waiting for you in the ballroom. follow me, please. mr. corkle, sir. max. how you doing? fine. max... hey, lost a little weight, huh? have we met? uh, sort of. yeah. thanks, sisk. hey. max, ha! hey. i hear you got all joe pendleton's athletic equipment. yeah. how'd you know that? i'd like to buy it from you. i'd like to bring it in here. no, i'm sorry, mr. farnsworth. that's not for sale. no? what do you want it for? i'd like you to help me train. oh, train? yeah. as soon as i'm ready... i want you to get me a tryout with the rams. i don't understand. what are you trying out for? quarterback. quarterback. yeah, well, the point is, mr. farnsworth, we already got a quarterback working with the team. we got a couple of pretty good backups. you call hodges good, huh? the point is we don't need a quarterback. look, why don't you try one of the other teams? the oakland raiders are pretty close to l.a. give them a call and see what they say. i want to get in shape in time for the super bowl. what would it cost to try out? look, mr. farnsworth, no team wants a crazy trainer, and only a crazy trainer would arrange a tryout for you. you keep your money, i'll keep my job, and we'll keep this little misunderstanding to ourselves. hey, listen-- that's all right. i'll finish that up. what would you say if i told you i was a professional football player? boy, hey, these-- these are nice. max... you know how people die? yeah. why? and after they die, they go to heaven? i guess, if--if they're good. i mean, why not? you know how it works in heaven? not exactly. it's probability and outcome. probability and outcome. probability and outcome. i never knew that. let's say there's a probability that some guy's going to die. what happens is an escort from his way station gets a signal. he goes down and waits for the outcome. if the guy lives, he wasted a trip. if he dies, he picks him up and takes him back to his way station. he puts him in line for his final destination. mind if i smoke? go ahead. let's say there's a new escort. he gets a signal. he takes off and sees a guy riding a bicycle into a tunnel. the car's coming the other way. he's supposed to wait for the outcome, but he's new and figures the guy's a goner. he figures, why should i have the car hit him? why not take him out a few seconds early and take him up to his way station? listen, i, uh... need a match. that clock, that's a lighter. so the thing is, the guy he takes up to the way station isn't just some ordinary guy. he's an athlete with fantastic reflexes. he wouldn't have hit the car at all, see? how do you light this? the guy wasn't really dead. his number wasn't up for years. he would have missed the car. look at the time. is this lighter right? they're supposed to put him back in his body, but they can't 'cause he's been cremated. they have to find another body for him. now, look, mr. farnsworth, i'm just a trainer. what you need is like a really good doctor. don't you understand what i'm trying to say? sure. that's a hell of a story. max, you-- mr. jordan. i'm so glad to see you. i'm trying to get farnsworth into shape for the super bowl. i want corkle to help me. somebody with us? who are you talking to? mr. jordan. he runs the way station. you can't see him. you're still alive. you probably got a lot to talk about. i'll be on my way. wait a second, max. tell him who you are, joe. he's never going to believe me. he's the only person i know who can get me a tryout with the rams. you can make him believe you. max! i'm not farnsworth. i'm joe pendleton. farnsworth's wife and secretary murdered him. this is just a body they found for me. they drugged him, stuck him in a bathtub, then i stepped in. it's not bad material. i can get it into shape. max, please. look, i really want to get out of here. i won't tell a word to anybody. i promise. it'll be our little secret. like what you said about your sister and the coca-cola salesman? what about that scar you got on the bottom of your tongue? what did you do at your uncle's wedding? what about the first time i fixed your neck in pittsburgh?  now do you believe me, max? please say you believe me. they don't have a football team in heaven, so god couldn't make me first-string. he doesn't believe me, mr. jordan. try a little music, joe. that's a great persuader. joe, you never could play that thing. joe. you all right, max? max... you all right? sisk! everett! bentley! whip up a liver and whey shake right away! i'm gonna play quarterback in the super bowl. and nothing can change that, right, mr. jordan? if that's what you've got coming to you. he's still here? right there. max, listen to me. farnsworth isn't in bad shape. i still know the moves. just help me with the body. thanks, mr. jordan. sisk! how about that liver and whey shake? hurry up. hurry up. i need it for mr. corkle. yes, sir. right away. i want the whole staff to suit up. we're going into training. uh, listen, mr., uh...jordan, is it? huh? you still there? uh, anytime you want to chime in... why, just feel free. feel free. i'm telling you to feel free. you got to help me talk joe out of this. if i do get him a tryout, that team will put him out of commission like that. christ, i can't even snap my fingers anymore. oh, sorry. he's not there, max. don't get crazy on me. i'm counting on you.  this just isn't going to work. these are the l.a. rams we're fooling with. it--it's just-- well, all right. i'm still figuring out what i'll say. i...  you're playing football with a bunch of butlers. we're in the super bowl. this won't work. don't worry. i fixed all that. how? i bought the rams. leo farnsworth has bought this team, and he wants to play quarterback. shit! crazy son of a bitch. we won't take this bullshit, coach. wait a minute. listen, fellas. this is the way it is. he'll play quarterback in wednesday's scrimmage. at which time, he and the coach will decide whether he's qualified for the job or not. mr. farnsworth says, ""tell no one to hold back."" these were his words. ""let's play that scrimmage like the super bowl."" take him at his word. let's kill him. my team. that son of a bitch got my team. what kind of pressure did he use, milt? well, i asked for 67 million, and... he said, ""ok."" ruthless bastard. well, very, very nice. very, very, impressive. i'm tony abbott, mr. farnsworth's personal secretary. very nice. very...very nice. don't let any of mr. farnsworth's racial statements offend you, for god's sakes. nice--nice talking to you.  get rid of that ball fast, all right? good luck, mr. farnsworth. all right, don't worry about the plays. i think i got them down last night. i want to run a split right, x-go, z-curl, a y-straight. like the super bowl. break. ready? break. look at gorman and kowalsky. that's how they look when they eat. 4-3, set! hut! hut.  sorry, mr. farnsworth. nice. let's try it again, mr. farnsworth. ok, get him back in there. let's go! let's go! try it with the ball! come on, positions! playing football is so much fun. set! come on now! hut! hut! hut! hut! hut--  i'm terribly sorry, mr. farnsworth. this is really embarrassing. help him up. i guess you went offsides. come on, guys, get him, get him, get him. give me a little more room, billy. set! let's all try and stay onsides. hut!  better get a stretcher. jesus! look, harry, he's an eccentric. we've always known that about farnsworth. buying a football team for 67 million that has a book value of 19? 3 weeks ago, the stock sold at 56. this morning it opened at 14. you want a rest, mr. farnsworth? no, no, it's ok. mr. leo farnsworth intends to take the los angeles rams to the super bowl this season as their quarterback. no sign of aberration in his behavior? nothing in his personal life bothering him? i think this statement speaks for itself. all right, i'm going to save you guys some trouble. want me to quit? give me the ball once. if i don't hit evans, i'll quit. ready? break! hey, now! on 3! set! hut! beautiful! ha ha ha!  there's a potential there, huh? he's... ok, ok. take it easy, mr. farnsworth. i know. shit, man, what you doing? what's he doing? ready? break. red right, red right. watch the pass. set! 3! hut!  hut! i think we got us a rich quarterback. he's looking awful good. boy, you pulled it off. you really pulled it off. yeah? i don't know. i think i can do it. hey, mr. farnsworth, play any college ball? no. i played a little polo. look, look, look. he brought the whole goddamn team home. that's not a football team. there are older men and skinny younger men. look at the women. that's the ecology group that exo-grey is funding. he's getting ready to spring some kind of a trap. this whole thing-- the football team gag, the ecology crap, the divorce bit-- it's all part of some plot. the minute he announces our divorce, i'll be the first suspect when we kill him. darling, perhaps i'm just being silly, but i'd be much more comfortable-- have i offended you in some way? don't put your hand over my mouth again. i'm sorry, darling. you used to like it. if we don't do something, we'll lose it all. i should have my head examined for signing a prenuptial agreement. i'll wind up with my wardrobe and some allowance. you'll be fired without references. we'll still have each other. not after the last 2 murders. don't you try it. the problem is, if a neighbor's tree is in the way of the sewer... want to make a wish? yes. all right. there. go ahead. hey, very good.  hey. uh... tell me, do you think it's silly, me trying to be a football player? of course not. that's what you want. you think i can do it? i think you could do anything you wanted. anything you committed to do you could do. 'cause i'm a big wheel at exo-grey. it's 'cause you're not afraid of things. afraid of things? why would i be afraid? well, you know, most people are afraid of something, aren't they? you want to know the only thing i'm afraid of? how i'd feel if i couldn't be with you. then there's nothing to be afraid of, is there?  got to go. wait a minute. wait a minute. i'd--the-- how would you feel about marrying me? it's crazy, huh? no, it doesn't sound crazy. you know, if--if i... what is it? what is it? could you wait here? i'll be right back. what do you want? i'm sorry, mr. pendleton. i'm afraid you won't be able to use mr. farnsworth's body any longer. what are you talking about? just what i said-- your time is up. you don't fit. you said i'd get to the super bowl. you can't do it with mr. farnsworth's body. why not? it wasn't meant to be. why not? don't keep saying ""why not?"" you think i'll pay for your mistake? look, mr. pendleton-- i'm not talking to you. tell mr. jordan i'd like to talk to him. we'll settle this once and for all. get out of here. you're bad news. is something wrong? um, no, it's-- i just got to straighten something out. maybe i better walk you to the car. oh. something is wrong, isn't it? i was just thinking, betty. we got a great life ahead, you and me, and nobody's going to take that away from us. why are you looking at me like that? i'm just memorizing your face. i want to memorize everything about you. no matter what happens, i won't forget you. what's going to happen? nothing's going to happen. you'd never forget me either, would you? no. that thing you said you saw in me... it was something in my eyes. remember? if someday somebody came up to you-- maybe a football player-- and he acted like he'd seen you before, you'd notice that same thing, right? you'd give him a chance, right? he could even be a quarterback. i don't understand what you're saying. ahh, i'm just acting crazy. betty? it's all right. there's nothing to be afraid of. you must abide by what is written. why? i don't understand. there's a reason for everything. there's always a plan. how can i give up farnsworth now? i'm sorry, joe. you said we'd get to the super bowl. if it's meant to be. i'm not leaving. sorry. i'm not leaving, mr. jordan. joe, you yourself asked for a temporary arrangement. i never went back on a deal, but i'm doing it now. your destiny is not in my hands. please don't make it more difficult. i won't. i'm just not going to do it. joe, you must abide by what is written. she loves me, mr. jordan. joe, you must abide by what is written.  don't be afraid, joe. there is a plan. there's always a plan. mr. farnsworth? hello, bentley. have you seen mr. farnsworth? no, sir, i haven't. guess i'll just have to keep looking. yes, sir. joe? joe, you in here? are you in there, mr. farnsworth?  yes. yes! listen, your highness, i'm telling you what i told the mayor last week. by the end of the week, i'll crack this case. right. another arab. son of a bitch farnsworth was into everything, and now he's vanished, disappeared. this is the craziest nut i've ever had to deal with. if he was alive, he'd be here. you're asking me to believe leo farnsworth asked you to marry him? yes. he was going to get a divorce. he said he'd call me, but something happened. how do you know? because he didn't call me, and he would have kept his word. hmm. tv: with less than 24 hours before the big game, the whereabouts of leo farnsworth remains a mystery. farnsworth said his wife and tony abbott were trying to kill him, and he told me how. let me talk to abbott. i can make him crack. ok. take corkle to the farnsworth house. the game.  and if you win this one... you're going to be champions of the world. and they can take away the money and the cheers. they can... take away the good looks, but nobody will ever take that away from you. let's go. let me get this straight. you're saying you saw no specific changes in mr. farnsworth's behavior? no, sir. a bit more talkative, but other than that, normal. and that's your opinion, too, mr. sisk? yes. i did notice he seemed to take a dislike to his hats, but it was never violent. max: why don't you ask me whatever you want and-- mr. corkle, please. mr. everett. oh. uh, y-y-yes? you had cocoa with him every night. uh, yes. what did you talk about? well, he'd say something like, uh, ""this cocoa is good, isn't it?"" and i'd say, uh, ""yes, it is."" and then he'd say something like, uh, ""i wish the marshmallow would last longer."" and i'd say, uh, ""so do i."" uh... sometimes he talked about cookies. thank you, mr. everett. oh, did he ever mention disliking his hats? what difference does it make-- i'm following a line of questioning here. did he ever say anything to you about his hats? never, sir. thank you, mr. everett. what did you discuss the last time you saw him? he was considering buying haiti. yes, sir. the country? thank you, mr. abbott. nothing about hats? no. thank you, mr. abbott. mrs. farnsworth, what was your relationship with your husband? very, very close. very, very special. miss logan claims he was getting a divorce and that he asked her to marry him. i don't doubt that. my husband loved me very, very much, but he was a man. he would say or do anything to make a conquest, but, lieutenant, it never touched our marriage. that's what made it so special. they're trying to pin it on betty. miss logan, i am sorry if i've said anything that's hurt you. i don't know you well enough for you to hurt me. i hope you don't doubt my word. i don't. i'm absolutely sure that you're lying. i assume if mr. farnsworth told you anything about disliking his hats, you'd let us know. you want to know about his hats? he didn't care, but he wouldn't wear socks with a suit! every time he crossed his legs, you could see his ankles were bare! and he thought hats looked funny without socks! but he never told you he disliked them. what? his hats. what kind of questions are you asking? all right. sit down. conway, turn that thing on. let him watch the game. everything's going to be all right. krim: we're getting a clearer picture of mr. farnsworth's patterns. there's a reason for everything. there's got to be. tv: it's a demanding defense. you don't need to worry about her. tom jarrett, the rams' quarterback, back to pass. looking, scrambling. he's in trouble. and he's hit hard! down he goes! what you're telling me, mr. abbott, is that mr. farnsworth never carried any money or credit cards, right? and no identification papers, right? right, sir. yes. then what we have here... tv: the score, 24-24. overtime. the way he was hit, tom jarrett is hurt. we can see the ram players are concerned and they're calling for the stretcher. jarrett has not moved. it'll be a miracle, frankly, and i hope he's well. he really got hit. now they order jerry hodges to start warming up on the sidelines. the pittsburgh defense has been brilliant. they've stopped the rams with-- the haitian ambassador's here. oh, yes. yes, thank you, sisk. give him a coke. tell him to wait. who do you think you are? you have a nerve to call this an investigation! now! how'd you do it this time, huh? did you drug him like you did before? tv: this one has seesawed back and forth. julia: lieutenant, i will not be spoken to in this way in my house.  why did it have to be jarrett? because it's his time, joe. it's his destiny. look at the pupils! bill, bill! get that ambulance!  tv: and jarrett's coming back into the game. joe...  oh, my god! it's his jacket! tv:  so it's you, mr. abbott! i should have known i couldn't trust you. lieutenant, here's your murderer! she did it! i'll sign a confession that she did it! she's been planning it for years! corkle, where are you going? i'm going to the coliseum. i'm conducting an investigation here. i'm going to the game. take this investigation and shove it up your ass! 3-23. hut! hut! radio: it's sudden death overtime! jarrett's sending this crowd into delirium! the crowd watching jarrett. he was sacked hard. he's getting up. he's ok.  2-3...set! hut! hut! a remarkable comeback by jarrett. jarrett trying to get them into field goal position. set!   all right! we're number one! we're number one! we're number one! we're number one! we're number one! we're number one! we're number one! we're number one! we're number one! we did it! corkle: joe! hi, max. i am right. it is you, isn't it? yeah. ha ha ha ha! i knew it! i knew it! i was watching the tv, and i said, ""that's him! that's him!"" the rams are super bowl champions! here's the star, tom jarrett. he led his team to victory. how do you feel? good. i mean, can you describe your feelings? world champions! i, uh, i feel good. please, please. i have to go now, joe. it's time. i can't stay here any longer. what do you mean? how does it feel to be tom jarrett? and when i've gone, you won't remember me. you'll be thomas jarrett with no memory of joe pendleton or leo farnsworth or anything that's happened. this is your destiny, joe. you're back on your own road now. what do you mean, i won't remember? good-bye, joe. there's a lot of confusion. wait. i got to talk to you. wait. good-bye. tom, congratulations. here he is-- coach of... you ok, tom? you ok? here's lamar crawford, the man who caught one of those key passes. i'm just happy that we won. in september, i told you the beginning of this season! ha ha! hey, benny! hey, joe! uh, tom! hey, doc. did tom leave? he's putting some ice on his eye. he'll be all right. that's something about farnsworth, isn't it? poor son of a bitch. yeah, isn't it? hey. corkle. what are you doing, closing up the joint? i didn't know you played that thing. what are you talking about?

There are rats in the basement. Ow! Willard... what are you doing? I'm going to bed. It's late. Yes. I'm going to bed. Good night, mom. What were you doing down there? You, uh, said there were rats. Well, did you see them? Well... there aren't any rats. There are. All our neighbors moving away... and all these new people remodelling the houses. They're stirring up rats. Well... have you been to the basement? No. You know I can't. I know they're there. I can smell them. All my life I could smell mice. Smell... mice? And hear them. Don't you hear them down there? It's... it's just the wind. There aren't any rats. Come in here. Hmm? Come in here. I'm sorry I've been such a bad mother to you. Well, you've... you've been a... Well, you are... a wonderful mother. It's my fault your life was wasted. Willard. What an awful name... Willard. Maybe if you had a stronger name... that Frank Martin wouldn't push you around... or maybe you'd have found a girlfriend... if you had a more handsome name... Mark or Kyle or... Clark. Willard, from now on, your name's Clark. Good night, Clark. Pardon me. That you? Sorry. They told me to sit here. Willard, he wants to see you. Oh. Well, um... Ms. Leach, it seems that someone... this girl, is sitting at my desk. Maybe that's why he wants to see you. OK. Hey. Pay attention. Yeah? Who's that at your desk out there, Willard? I... I don't know her. Sit. Who did you say that was at your desk out there, Willard? I... I... I don't know her. Well, you should know, because it's your fault she's there. You've fallen at least a week behind... processing the purchase orders. You know, when that happens, Willard... everything comes to a standstill... my salespeople up on the floor... shipping, receiving, inventory. Everybody's standing around... with their thumbs up their asses... because you have allowed the purchase orders... to bottleneck at your desk. Your father built this company, Willard. Hell, your family name is still out there... on the side of the building... ""Martin Stiles Manufacturing."" Ah, hell, it just seems to me like... that alone would make you take... a little more pride in your work. Well, I... Oh, my mother is sick. I see. So, it's your mother's fault that you've fallen behind? Willard, I'm an old friend of the family. Hell, I've known your mother since before you were born. She's a fine lady, and she deserves to be kept comfortable. Your dad was like a father to me. And I promised him that I would always... Look after you and your mother... and as long as she was alive, you'd have a job right here. And in keeping with that promise... I must insist that you find... a good rest-care facility for mom. We can't afford that. But, hell, I guess you could always sell the house. Here's an idea... I'd tear it down and build apartments on it. I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll catch up. I'll stay late. Oh, yeah. You would love that, wouldn't you, Willard? Suck up on more overtime than it even costs me for a temp. You'll catch up, all right, asshole... and you'll catch up on your own damn time! There's one thing that you will never understand, Willard... business is a rat race. Promise or no promise, I will not allow myself... to be devoured by all of those other rats because of you! Clark! What is it? What is it? Shh, shh, shh. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Here we go. What was all that noise? Rats? No. A bird got stuck in the house somehow, and I let it out. It's all right now, so go back to bed. What are you doing in there? I'm going potty. You've been in there a long time. I'm not feeling well, mom. Is it loose or hard? I'm OK. I'm OK. So just... just go to bed. Let me see. I'm still your mother. Clark! Clark! You should be in bed. You're feverish. I get afraid, Clark. Your father was in that bathroom late that night. Yes, I know. I'm never going to do anything like that. What is that on your hand? It's... it's soap. It's cooking oil. Oh, Willard, you're too old for that. When will you find yourself a girl? Well, other than getting caught in the trap... you seem pretty... pretty smart. You should be called... Socrates. What do you think? Yeah? All right. Socrates. Whoa. Like it in here? Oh. Where are you going? Bye, Socrates. Say hello to your family. You're reunited with your brother and sister and mom. Look. Look, everybody. Food. Food for everybody. There you go. Very good. Bye. Socrates... I will never let anyone harm you ever. I promise. I promise. I promise. Martin, I have to cover your damn car every day. ""Cover my car. Cover my car."" Ugh! Do you like my new S-55, Willard? My new car. My new Mercedes. I saw you drooling over it. Oh. Uh, yes, Mr. Martin. It's... Do you know why I have that car? I'm driving that 350-horsepower, V-8 masterpiece... for you and your fellow employees. You see, buyers feel a sense of security... when they can see proof... that they're dealing with a successful man. So, when I whip into that parking lot behind the wheel... of my brand-new Mercedes AMG-class... they'll buy from us over the slob in the Jaguar S-type. Do you know why I can afford to plunk down 90,000 bucks... for that little edge over the competition, Willard? Because I'm a successful man! Because I have never been late for work a day in my life! Because when I come to work, I don't show up... in one of my dead father's cheap suits! Because I have never given my boss such grief. Maybe it wouldn't hurt you to find out what pleases me! Are you OK? Hi, Socrates. It's been a bad day. Tear it, Socrates. All right... you teach them. They listen to you, Socrates. Tear it. Tear it. Tear it up. Jeez. You're big. Big Ben. Do you know him, Socrates? Ben, this looks like the beginning... of a beautiful friendship. Tear it. Tear it. Tear it. OK, everybody, that was really good. Speed. Speed. Very good. Rope... up. Tear it. You go down there. Go on now. Down. Down. Tear it. In. Still. Out. One week! You've been late for so many hours... that it equals an entire week! Mr. Martin, I... I'm sorry. I want my week back. I've discussed it with counsel. I may not be able to fire you, Willard... but, by God, it is well within my rights to administer... physical disciplinary reprimand! I know that you must be tired of this excuse... but what can I do? My mother is sick. You don't give a shit about your mother! If you did, you'd show up for work on time... because now look what's happened. You're out a week's pay. Oh, you don't like that. Then quit. Act like a man for once in your life and just quit! You're a slimy, pukey piece of shit! You wouldn't make a pimple on my grandmother's tush! Willard. In. In. No! Ben, no. If you get in, nobody else will be able to fit. In. Be careful, stupid. We're not making a bed here. All available units, please respond immediately. 211 in progress... 316 Glenview Parkway. Out. Door. Tear it. Tires. Tear it. Ben, I told you to stay. You... you won't fit. What the hell is that? You left the washer in the garage... running again, didn't you? In! In! Come on. Come on. Anybody out there? Is someone out there in the garage? Oh, shit! Look at that! Somebody got in here and slashed my tires! Damn! Who's out here? Yeah, you better run! You don't mess with a man's brand-new car like that! Run, and you'll only die tired! You better run faster... because if I catch you, you are dead meat! Quiet! Go home! Do you want to see what's in the bags... you stupid little dog? The look on his face. Imagine, all four of his tires. Do you know what a set of those tires run? Insurance will cover it. But insurance won't cover how pissed off he's gonna be. Hey, what's up? Someone broke into Martin's garage last night... slashed his tires and peed on the floor! Morning, Cat. You look very nice today. Wow. Someone... someone urinated on the floor? No, no, no. You know, what happened... when Martin goes in his garage... and sees his tires, he pissed his pants... and blamed it on the guy that did it. Do you think that's funny, Fox? Ahem. Good morning, Mr. Martin. Is everything OK? No, everything is not OK. How would you like it if some maniac... invaded the privacy of your home... and scared the dog shit out of your wife... and then you had to lose an entire night's sleep... because you're dealing with the cops? Knowing that that perverted sicko has control... over you and your family's peace of mind? For Jesus and Christ, for how long? How long will it last? No, I'm not all right! This morning, I rode the subway. Well, Mr. Fox, how would you like that? No, sir, I wouldn't like that at all. I didn't think you would. Barbara, I need a foot massage. Oh, that's so good. That's so good. Foods. Foods. We, um... we're running out of room. I'm very sorry about this... but I can't... I can't feed you anymore. I can't afford it. You're going to have to find a new place to live. Go find somewhere more comfortable. I wish that they didn't have to... but all good things must come to an end. Follow Ben. He will find a new place for you. He will take care of you. Won't you, Ben? You're the leader... after Socrates. Good night, Ben. You're not going anywhere, Socrates. You'll always be with me. I hate everyone but you. Let's go to bed. Ben, I told you. You can't come upstairs. Now, it's only Socrates, not you. Oh, Socrates. Aah! Don't touch me! You're getting rid of me. Mom, I... I love you. I heard you! ""All good things must come to an end."" No, I... I love you more than anything in the world. You don't love me! You won't feed me! I hate you! You need to go to the hospital. What if mom sees you? No. Mom? Mom? Off. Off. Off. Off. Off. Off. Off. Down! Down! In the basement! Down! Down! Down! In the basement! Down! You think you're funny? You think you're smart? Socrates, he's smart. He knows that they're going to have to come... and they're going to have to take her away... and then they'll come, and they'll take me away... and then they'll come, and they'll take you away! Hi. She's my mother. I love her. And I'll miss her. I already miss her. But, Socrates... if you ever died, I... You're the only friend that I've ever had. Well... at least you're with father again. I have a friend. See? He wants to say good-bye to you. Say good-bye, Socrates. That's good. Willard. In. Willard, are you all right? Yeah. I didn't mean to upset you. You didn't have to come here. Well, we didn't hear from you... and I wanted to make sure that you were OK. Uh, and I want to let you know that... you have a friend. Willard Stiles, I am Joseph Carter. I'm an attorney with Montgomery and Glitt... the trustees of your mother's estate. I've been trying to reach you, but you don't answer the phone. May I have a moment with Willard, please? Do you mind if I check on you after work... and make sure that you're OK? Oh, I... thanks. That's OK. I'll be OK, Cat. Willard, I have some news... I don't know if you're aware of or prepared for. Your parents had been living off an account... they had originally set up for your future. It was intended to be yours upon their passing. However, your father's death left debts... that even Mr. Martin's buyout did not completely relieve. In fact, there remains pending litigation... on some unsettled debts. Well... it's... it's still my house. Your mother refinanced the house... after your father's death. - In fact, we still owe... - ""We""? It's my house. We can declare bankruptcy. We can sell the house. - It's my house! - Yes, of course. You grew up there. It's your home. - But it's the bank's house. - It's my house! There's no need for a single man... to be living in such a large house, Willard. Sell it. Why do I have to pay for what things my parents did? The money can help you start over. ""Start over""? I'm almost done! Willard, look. You have no choice... If I have no choice, why did you even come here? Why did you even bother telling me? Do you get off on telling people... that they have no control over their lives? That I have no money, no home, and it's not even my fault? Willard, this is not the time nor place. Now, you think about it. Then, please, you have to contact me. This is the only chance you have... to take control of your own life. Thank you. Socrates. Ben! Willard, it's Cathryn. Answer the door. I saw you walk in. - Oh, hi. - Hi. I'm just on my way out. I have some stuff that I have to do at the cemetery. Oh, well, this might not be the best time, Willard... but please don't take this the wrong way. You looked so lonely at your mother's service... and I remember how devastated I was... you know, when my mother died. And the only thing that helped me through... was... her mother. This is Scully. She'll make a great friend, and she'll keep you company. Oh. I don't know what to say. I... I can't accept Scully. See? She likes you. Well... Why don't you hold her? Just take her. Just hold her. Really, I can't. I'm sorry. - Just take her. - OK. Well... I'm really late, and... Do you think it's OK if I just put her inside? - Sure. She's potty-trained. - Oh, good. Good. Socrates. It's OK. It's OK. I wasn't... really trying to hurt him. I know. You're trying to keep the peace... but he has to learn... I am the boss. It's back to work, Socrates. Ben, out. OK, Ben... just because Socrates says it's OK. Here we go. Here we go. Am I reading this correctly? ""Mr. Stiles, it is our regret to inform you... ""your position has been terminated. ""Enclosed please find two weeks' severance. ""Your service is appreciated. ""Frank Martin."" He's firing you. But I thought he couldn't fire you. Willard. Hey. Hey! This whole thing is just one big misunderstanding. I'll make it up to you, though. I'm gonna take you to the Jets-Dolphins game. - How does that sound? - What? Feels like this office could use a little holiday cheer. Cathryn, go dig out the Christmas decorations. They're in the back storeroom. The key's in Willard's desk somewhere. Talk it over with Rosie and let me know. I'll be right here at the office working late tonight. Christmas bonus time, you know. Mrs. Leach, found the keys... but you can dig out your own holiday cheer... and then you can shove it up your ass with a big ho-ho-ho. - I quit. - Bye-bye. How could you? What part of ""You're fired"" don't you understand? - My father! - Is dead. Been dead. And now your mama's dead, too. He started this company! It's my family's company! No. My company. Been my company... and I don't want you around it anymore. Why in the hell are you even still here? You hate it here. I hate you being here. You're going nowhere here. Mommy and daddy are dead. Get over it and get on with your life. The terms of your purchase contract... they strictly state that you are not allowed to... Sue me. Get you a goddamn lawyer and sue me. You'll win. Go down today and hire yourself a $250-an-hour lawyer. Sue me. My $400-an-hour lawyer... will tie it up in the courts until I die. So, what? 10, 15, 20 years from now, you'll win. You know I cannot afford that! You know that! Need money? Make me an offer on the house. Don't give me that face, Willard. I buy the house, you have money. You can go buy yourself a very nice clean used car... move someplace where you'll be happy... get a job, a girlfriend. Jeez, you'll be so damn happy you won't want to sue me. All right... I'll sell you the house. But, please, please, please let me keep my job! Please! Please let me keep my job. Please. What in the hell is going on now? A rat! A rat in here! Oh! It's a rat! Oh, my God! Rat! Look out! There's a white rat... and it is the size of a dog... I mean, huge dog. Over there, behind the Christmas lights. See him? Where? I don't see any mouse. No. Up there, you idiot. Up there! I think your wild-ass imagination... is kind of getting away with you. He's up higher. There he is. No! Walt, this is Mickey. I'm coming to join you. Yeah. What's the matter, tiger? Can't take a little blood? Ha ha ha ha! Finders keepers. Nice work, Mr. Martin. Yeah, good one, sir. He expects me to clean that up? I'll do it. Thanks. What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What could I do? What can I do? What can we do? In. In. That's it. We can't fit any more. The rest of you are going to have to wait here. Ben and I will be back later. Right, Ben? Oh, Jesus. Ooh... I like that. Ooh, look at you. Oh, my God. Look at all the rats. Yes. Look at the rats. We've come to see you. We? They'll do anything I tell them. Well, then tell them to get the fuck out of my office! Sit down. Now, you listen to me, Willard. Sit down! What the hell's wrong with you? Mr. Martin, you stole this business from my father. It killed him, and it killed my mother. And now you're trying to kill me. No. That's... You never let me alone for a minute. You made a fool of me in front of everybody. And now you're trying to take my house. You made me hate myself. I thought a lot about it... hating myself. Well, right now... at this moment... I like myself. You killed Socrates! Who the hell is Socrates? He was the only friend... I ever had! What's the matter, tiger? Afraid of a little blood? Tear him up. Good-bye, Ben. Food. Food. - I think I hear footsteps. - Yeah. - Let's look around back. - OK. Willard? It's Cathryn. I've been calling you all day. Did you hear? Martin's dead. They called from the office. The details are weird. All kinds of rumors... that he was murdered or attacked by animals. I'm hungry. Could we get something to eat? Right now? Let me get my coat. Just a second. Could I use the restroom? Cathryn? In here. Sorry. I had to go so bad, and you flew off somewhere. We need to go. Shit. I must have run over something. - There he is. - You sure that's him? Yeah. Get in the car. I'll call triple-A. I've got a cell phone. Mr. Stiles, police. Open the door, please, sir. Can you please tell me what this is about? Willard! Open the door, Willard! I want to help you! Willard! Willard! Open the door, Willard! Let me in! What's going on in there? I hear him going around back. Stiles. Stiles! I'm sorry, Ben. I... I'm sorry that I left you. I got scared... and so I... I came back here. It's all over, Ben. You can live anywhere. You can go anywhere. I have nowhere. Who's he talking to? There was nothing that I could do about Socrates. But... we got him back. We got Mr. Martin back together. This guy's nuts. We should just call Bellevue. It's all over, Ben. So just... go! Go away! Whoa! It's not just Bellevue. We've got to call the health department exterminators. You see that? Oh, man. Let's go. Do you want some food? I'll give you some food, Ben. I'll give you all the food that I have... if you'll just go away. Do you want food? No. No, no, Ben. It's food. It's just food. Whatever food is in the bag is yours. Ah! That's it for you, Ben! I hate you! I loved Socrates, but I hate you! I'm not setting foot in there. There's, like, a thousand rats. Ma'am, you want to get eaten alive? Martin. If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator. Cathryn, help! Help! Cathryn! Cathryn. Ben. I thought we were friends. Food's here. Food. Look, Stiles, you've got to eat. You might be out of your mind, but your body's staying here. Eat. Come on. We got some nice chicken... some mashed potatoes... got a sourdough roll. Hey, look. We got a piece of cheese. That's what the mice eat, isn't it? OK, rat boy. Look, I'm gonna leave it here. You can do whatever you want with it. Hi. Shh. I know you're hungry, but we have to wait. Our time will come. Let's not let them know that you've come back to me. We have to sit here... and wait... wait... quietly. Quiet as a mouse., Hey there. - How was Europe? - Oh, it's still there. Except for France. She's not sore at us any more. I hoped you'd have a couple of hours. I'd like to talk about something. Honey, in a couple of hours I'll be halfway to LA. The directors can't wait for these reports. But, uh... I can do wonders in 30 minutes. Well, I can't. We'll have to wait till tonight. What flight are you on? The red-eye special. Alan, why don't you wait and fly with me? I'll have my work all finished by the time you get there. I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk now. It didn't feel to me like you were interested in talking just now. Are you back on that same old kick about us? If that's what you wanna call it. - Come on. What's all the rush? - Rush? I've been on this particular kick for six years now. Maybe I'm tired of one-night stands. Baby, I've only got half an hour. Can't we talk it out when you get to LA? Don't miss your flight, Murdock. You wouldn't wanna keep that boss of yours waiting. But... - Will you be returning? - I can't tell. My life is a surprise. - You look lovely. - Thank you. Imagine getting gussied up like this to watch a lot of Supreme Court judges chew. Miss Swanson, what is the secret of your eternal youth? I take natural food. I will not have poisoned food. It's not good for anybody. Just one more question. {Y:i}Northwest passenger Janet Satterly... - Who is she? Do you recognise her? - One of those Hollywood persons. - Oh.

Hello there, Mrs Patroni. Hi. Your seats are right over in there. Evening. - You better use code. - Neat. - Hello, Alan. - Hey, honey. {Y:i}- I'm not getting you in trouble? - I don't think so. That's what I've been trying to do for years, but you're too smart. - Alan, what is it? - I didn't like the way we said goodbye. I don't remember anybody saying goodbye. Come on, damn it, you know what I mean. Then why don't you tell me what you mean? I guess I haven't been too good at that, have I? {Y:i}- You've had your moments. - Yeah. Look, that talk you mentioned. We'll have that as soon as you get here. I promise, huh? OK. {Y:i}- Have a good flight. - Thanks. Hey, I love you. Nancy? - Hey, you don't look happy, baby. - I don't know what you mean. {Y:i}- We're seven minutes behind schedule. -  I'm aware of it. - What is the word? - The ambulance should be close. I sure hope so. I got special clearance through gate four. Keep an eye open. OK, we'll give them a hand. Won't you, Julio? Yes, sir. Hold this. I'll take care of Miss Swanson. - Good evening. Right this way, please. - Thank you. Hello. How are you? - Good evening, Miss Swanson. - You mean good morning. Right here, Miss Swanson. Yes, put it under my feet. Thank you very much. Pleasure to have you with us. If there's anything I can do, let me know. - Never mind her. Put your ticket away. - Yes, Sister. Sammy, will you sit down? Sammy. Sit down. - I'm twisted! - Sit down. You're a tiny bit nervous, aren't you? I know. I've flown thousands of miles and under very difficult circumstances. I assure you there's nothing to be worried about. Oh. May I? He's probably got something on his mind. Probably getting it off his chest right now. - Look, Sister. An ambulance. - Oh, I hope it's not serious. Clear the aisle, please. Oh, how blessed I am. Three children, seven grandchildren, and all healthy, thank God. - Put your chair in... - Julio, this is fine. Careful. It's a young girl. Let me take that, sweetheart. - Let me take your coat. - Oh, thank you. There. - You want this? - Please. Thank you so much. - Happy to have you aboard, Janice. - Thank you. Yeah, come on... Gonna be a lot of laughs, I can see that right now. - Here we go, boys. - Right around there. - Here we go. - The bar's closed till we get to cruising altitude. - Closed? - We're not at cruising altitude? No, not yet. Lookit, didn't I see you guys over in coach? Yeah. Why don't we go back there and you can fasten your seat belts? I want a dry vodka Martini on the rocks with a twist of lemon. Please, Janice, remember what the doctor said. You must lie very, very still. I know, Mother, but it's so exciting. The people are so interesting. You'll have to turn your seat forward for the take-off. Oh. Uh... thank you. - You just hold tight to that guitar. - OK. {Y:i} Columbia 409, clear for take-off. We're rolling. This is it. Count your beads, folks. - I, uh... I hear Rosie Grier does that. - Yes, he does. {Y:i} Here in Gallup and surrounding areas, {Y:i}we can expect a massive cold front moving in from the north. {Y:i}Heavy turbulence is predicted above 15,000 feet. {Y:i}Storm warnings are posted over most of northern Utah... Did you hear that, Scotty? Looks like you're stuck here. Come back to town with us and try it tomorrow. I wish I could stay. I've enjoyed being with you fellas. What's so goddamn important in Boise? If I miss that meeting, I'll lose about half next year's sales commissions. The weather's not gonna change. What are you gonna do? Well, I know I can make it to Elko for refuelling. Maybe the weather will thin out up there. OK, if you wanna break up this glamorous tro. Come on. We'll help you untie. {Y:i}...a massive cold front is moving in from the north. {Y:i}Heavy turbulence is predicted... You look a little off-colour, Scotty. You feeling all right? Oh, I'm fine. Good luck, now. Departure, Columbia 409 out of 2,000 feet for flight level 240. {Y:i} Roger, Columbia 409. Radar contact. {Y:i}Turn right to 300 degrees. Report out at 7,000. Columbia 409.

Once again skill and daring have overcome fear and anxiety. Study this chapter and don't move anything till I get back. Nancy, got a couple of aspirin? What's the matter? You got a headache? Did you ever take a tour of Washington with a ten-year-old kid who wants to see everything? Everything. You sure you don't want a drink instead? I'll give these ten minutes. - Which one takes the sugar again? - The neat one. Oh, Julio. - I'll take you into the lions' den. - Who's afraid of that? I'm Jewish. Jewish? From Ogallala? You've got to see Gloria Swanson. She looks terrific. Oh, hi, Nancy. - Bette, we've missed you. - It has been a long time, hasn't it? - Thank you. - Nobody misses me any more. Well, you're onto us, baby. - And I'm not? - You're too young to know what I mean. - I know. - Yeah, but you're a dirty old man. We need love too. - How do you put up with them? - I've been here so long, I don't hear it. No wonder you're so good at dodging passes. She won't rise above her principles. The trouble with Nancy is she's a one-man girl. Right, baby? - Right, baby. - What a waste of talent. - Hey! There's no sugar in this. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I'll just... - This is it. - Sorry. - I like my coffee sweet, Mommy. - See you later. - Mm? Huh? {Y:i}Ay, chicol Mrs Devaney? Mrs Devaney? There are two empty seats. Would you like to go there? - Oh, that would be nice. - Fine. Plug it in right here. - Down in front, sir. - Yes, I... I'll be down. - I'm, uh... I'm in this picture. - You're in this picture? It's a small part, but the producer said the next picture I'll have a bigger part. Good. - Sister Beatrice. - It's coming up now. I'm going to see if I can talk to that young girl. - Pardon me, Sister? - Yes? - Don't you like the picture? - Oh, I wasn't watching. Oh. Here it comes. The picture broke. The picture broke? The only reason I took the flight was because of the picture. It's all right. I've seen this movie. - Oh, you have? How did I come out? - Fine. - I did? - Just fine. Oh, thank you. - Is this a double? - That's a double. - Keep 'em coming, will you? - Hi. Excuse me. Could I say hello to the little girl? - Um... I'm not sure... I guess so. Go ahead. - OK. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Sister Ruth. - I'm Janice. - That's a nice guitar. - Thank you. - Do you play? - Just a little bit. What kind of music do you like? Oh, I like, uh... I like rock music and, uh... folk music. All kinds. Me too. Would you like to try? OK. - Is it all right if I sit here? - Sure. {Y:i}# Would you take better care of yourself {Y:i}# Would you be kinder to yourself {Y:i}# Would you be more forgiving of your human imperfections {Y:i}# If you realised your best friend was yourself? {Y:i}# Who is always with you everywhere? {Y:i}# Who is on your side when others are unfair? {Y:i}# And tell me, who will never let you down {Y:i}# In any situation? {Y:i}# Who will always see you get your share? {Y:i}# And that's why I am a best friend to myself {Y:i}# And I take me out whenever I feel low {Y:i}# And I make my life as happy {Y:i}# As a best friend would {Y:i}# I'm as nice to me as anyone I know {Y:i}# Mm-mm-mm, mm {Y:i}# Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm # Oh. Your... your book editor has a query. In, uh... chapter two, you tell how the studios could tell the contract stars what to do and what not to do. You had two friends who didn't cave under studio pressure. They want the names. That's easy. Carole Lombard and Grace Moore. I was a rebel too. Miss Swanson, can I get you something from the bar? No, thank you. I have my own. Tea. - Miss Griffith? - Yes. A Martini, please. I don't believe it. - Did it again. - Who's winning? You know my son, Diamond Jim. Wins at everything, just like his father. How long have you been playing that game? Ever since we took off. Better keep him away from Vegas. Hello, Mr Patroni. Hi, Mr Patroni. Hi. What the heck are you doing down here? What's wrong with your fancy office? New job doesn't keep you busy, huh? You know how it is. Just like to keep my hand in. I just got this crew broke in, so don't go screwing 'em up with your old-fashioned ways. Whoops. Oopsy. He dropped his old-fashioned wrench. Miss. - Do you need something? - I feel a little queasy. The altitude. I'll have a bourbon. With a beer chaser. Mrs Devaney, do you know what you just ordered? - They call those boiler makers. - I know. Bourbon with a beer chaser. Operator, I'd like to place a credit-card call. My number is 644011537F. Calling Mrs Scott Freeman, same number, Boise, Idaho. Area code 208. {Y:i}- Hello? -  Hello? - Where are you? - Elko. I've been having weather problems. Really, now, Scotty, don't take any chances. Don't worry. How is the weather there? The moon's out, but there are clouds around. Well, there's a squall line going through here. I'll wait it out and then come on home. Look, can't you just cancel that meeting tomorrow? No way. Those guys only come out once a year. I'll find a hole in this weather and be there soon. OK. I'll wait up. That'll be worth coming through anything for. I love you, darling. I love you. - What's wrong, Junior? - A vibration. - In number three, huh? - Yeah. When we get to Los ngeles, you're gonna see Fifi. Give me a little kiss. That's good. Now... I guess everybody had given up hope, including the doctors. Nobody expected me to live. But, then, I've never done anything I was expected to do. - Is everything OK? - Yes. Fine, thank you. I once went with a girl who was half-French and half-Chinese. I came home late, she ate my laundry. I want you to be sure and tell everyone how you irrigate those flowers. Would you pour my drink? Who do you think is gonna make it to the Super Bowl? - Well... - Greenwood probably has an inside shot. Real funny. Los ngeles Centre, Columbia 409 over Bryce Canyon at flight level 350. {Y:i} Roger, Columbia 409. Stand by for radar identification. {Y:i}- We've got to sort you out.

We apologise for the inconvenience. We'll try and make your delay as pleasant as possible. Thank you. - What do you do in Salt Lake City? - I went there once. It was closed. - Mrs Devaney? Mrs Devaney? - Yes? Salt Lake City may be very good for you. - It's dry there, you know. - Dry? Do you know that my first trip to California took five days? So if we have to spend a weekend in Salt Lake, I'm still ahead. - But we have to get to Los ngeles. - We'll make it all right. Wait till I ask Dad if this is any way to run an airline. I suppose you'll wanna see the Mormon temple. Hey, that'd be neat. You don't understand. She can't stay off that kidney machine too long. She's a very sick girl. We'll make it. I know we will. Salt Lake Centre from Columbia 409. {Y:i} Salt Lake Centre. Go ahead, Columbia 409. We're descending for a landing in your fair city. Please alert Brigham Young. {Y:i}Roger, 409. We have you in radar contact. Checklist. - Windshield heat. - A-OK. - We're safe from all kinds of birdies. - Except young flying quail. You're a disgrace to your race.

Don't your hands ever get tired? Idle hands... By the time we land, you'll probably have a rug. A rug? Salt Lake, this is 232 Zulu. What's the big delay? {Y:i}You're still number two behind a 747. - Five degrees flaps. - Five degrees. {Y:i} Ladies and gentlemen, we've started our descent into Salt Lake City. {Y:i}Please make sure your seat belts are fastened and put out your cigarettes. - What's wrong, Junior? - That damn vibration again. {Y:i}Columbia 409, the Barron is at 12,030. Sister Ruth! Urias. Urias. Julio. Joseph. - What happened? - I don't know. Bette, come here. Handle him. Carol... Oh, my God! - Nancy. - Yes. - Still flying? - Yes. Autopilot. - It's in ""on"". - Good. Altitude. Hold. Get help. Radio. I will. {Y:i} Columbia 409, this is Salt Lake Approach. Do you read me? {Y:i}Do you read me? Columbia 409. Salt Lake. Salt Lake, this is Columbia 409. {Y:i}It's...Nancy Pryor, stewardess. Something hit us. All the flight crew is... either dead or... or badly injured. There's no one left to fly the plane. {Y:i}Help usl We read you, Nancy. Stand by. Oh, my God! Help us! 409, this is Salt Lake. Stay on this frequency, Nancy. {Y:i}Are you flying level? I think so, yes. {Y:i}- Is your autopilot on? - The what? Your autopilot. Is it on? Yes. Good. Describe the damage to the aircraft. Over. There's a hole ripped through the plane on the right. Just above the copilot's seat. {Y:i}A lot of the gauges over the engineer's...panel are broken. {Y:i}The front controls seem to be all right. We have you in radar contact and you look good. We'll do all we can to help you. {Y:i}Stay on this frequency, Nancy. I'm going down to the IFR room. {Y:i} Don't panic. Stay seated, everybody, please. Remain calm. Sit down. We'll be all right. Bette... Bette. Now, I want you to get hold of yourself. We're going to have to go down there and calm everybody else. - What is gonna happen? - They're gonna land the plane. How? I don't know, but I want you to go down there and tell everyone everything is going to be all right. We have to give them something to hope for. I just got off the horn with the boss. I'll handle things here! Keep this line open. They're gonna have to make a course correction or hit the mountains. I want Al Murdock on this. Try his apartment. Listen. How much time do you estimate before a course correction is needed? Ouch. All right, hang on. Have them get Exec One ready. We'll take the Lear to Salt Lake. I understand. We're getting Al Murdock on this. He was our chief instructor pilot on 747 s for four years. I'll get back to you. - Bill. - It's ringing. Look, you're gonna have to handle the news people on this. When the story breaks, there's gonna be relatives and friends. Won't the directors want you to handle that? My wife and son are in that plane. I'm going to Salt Lake City. I'm sorry, Joe. How the hell are we gonna get that aircraft? I don't know. That plane can do almost anything. Murdock knows more about it than anybody. Where is he? - No answer. - Wait. He was going out to meet 409. - Try the VIP lounge. - Yeah. - How's it flying now? - Autopilot. - How much damage was there? - Not a great deal. There's just a big hole in it where the pilots usually sit. - Yeah? Right. - Exec One is ready when you are. - All right. - They're paging Murdock. - Tell him to get his ass to Exec One. {Y:i}Al Murdock, emergency call. Al Murdock. - Alan Murdock. - Al, it's Bill. What's up? They said it was an emergency. It is. My God. Yeah... Are you sure it's 409? Yeah, I... I understand. I'm on my way. I'm frightened. What has happened? Why won't you tell us? We'll let you know as soon as we know ourselves. There's nothing... - Miss... - What's the matter? - Where are the oxygen masks? - We're below 14,000 feet. You don't need them. Everything'll be fine. We're flying into the mountains. Everything will be just fine. Sit back and relax. We'll be OK. Can I help? Mother? Mother? It'll be OK. Darling, I'm going to see if I can help, but I want you to stay in your seat. - Do you want me to come with you? - No. Oh, and Mom? Remember the 747's the best aircraft ever made. It can almost fly by itself. Dad calls it the big pussy-cat. I remember. Nancy, this is Al, honey. We're in Exec One on the way to Salt Lake. We've cleared this frequency. Do you read me? {Y:i}Yes, I read you. Fine. Now, we don't have too much time. Sit in the pilot's seat and do exactly what I tell you. O... OK. Ready. Now, look at the instrument panel. The altimeter is marked ALT. {Y:i}- I know that. - What does it read, honey? 12,000 feet. {Y:i}All right. The airspeed indicator is to the left. I know that too. It's 192. OK, honey. Take it easy. Now I want you to find the autopilot. Look to your right. At the top of the panel, just below the windshield. {Y:i}There's a switch marked autopilot. It says command, manual and off. {Y:i}- I see it. - Don't touch it. - Is it in manual? - It's on manual. It's on. I don't hear you, honey. Nancy, press your mike button. Yes. Fine. Now, we don't have anything to worry about. We're just gonna help the autopilot make a turn. Do exactly what I tell you. {Y:i}Put your hand to the right of the console. {Y:i}- The what? - The flat panel just below the throttles. {Y:i}There's a grey knob about the size of a milk-bottle top. I see it. OK. Now slowly turn it to the right. Nothing's happening. OK, honey. Try it to the left. Slowly. It's not working. There's nothing happening. It... it's not turning the plane. Jesus, it's not working for turns. Can't you tell us what's happening? They want us to change course, just like I told you. It's a very simple thing. There is a pilot on the radio telling her what to do, telling her exactly how to do it. Pardon me. What her? The first stewardess is at the controls, but she... she is in constant touch with the tower. The stewardess is flying the plane? - Could you keep your voice down? - Sure. The stewardess is flying the plane? Thank you, but I don't drink. What difference does it make now? You're right. No difference. Alan. - I'm scared. - You're doing just fine, honey. There's a problem with the autopilot. It'll keep you straight and level but I'm gonna help you make the turns yourself. {Y:i}- I'm gonna turn the plane? - No sweat. Put both hands on the wheel. There's a button under your left thumb. Press it. What's that? {Y:i}Don't worry. That's just an alarm. Press it again. OK. All right, honey. You've got the airplane. Just hold it steady until I tell you. {Y:i}I want you to find the artificial horizon on the instrument panel. {Y:i}It's the little airplane with a horizontal line through it. Alan. I can't do this. {Y:i}Why not? You can do it, Nancy. {Y:i}Nancy, come in. God damn it, answer! OK. OK, I'm gonna try it. - You scared the hell out of me, honey. - What do you think I am? OK. What does your altimeter read, Nancy? 11,500 feet. {Y:i}That's good. All right, now, turn to the right. {Y:i}Turn the wheel to the right, slow and easy. Turning. {Y:i}Good. Read me your airspeed. It's going down. It's only, uh... 184. {Y:i}That's still all right. Just keep turning. She's climbing. Get her nose down or she'll stall. Not till she finishes the turn. {Y:i}- What's your airspeed now? - 180. It's on 180. {Y:i}All right. Now turn the wheel to the left again till it comes level. {Y:i}Now ease the wheel forward, just a little. {Y:i}Watch the little airplane in the instrument. {Y:i}Don't let it fall below the line. Wings on the horizontal line. All right. OK. Let the autopilot take it back now. Turn the switch in the top panel back to manual. {Y:i}Take your hands off the wheel. {Y:i}Is the airplane level? {Y:i}- Yes. - Good job, honey. You take a rest now. We're almost to Salt Lake. We got a big problem. Look here. There's Salt Lake City and there's 409. Look at the terrain in between. There is no way we can talk Nancy through those mountains to a safe landing. It's just too much for her. - The only way is to put a pilot into 409. - You mean a mid-air transfer? A jet helicopter can keep up. We can put a man out on a tether. - You know what it would be to do that? - There isn't any other way! I think he's right. The only question is, who? - Me. - No, Al, you're too damn big. - You gonna go shopping for somebody? - Right. I'll call Hill Air Force Base. They're the experts. You mean you're gonna try to transfer a pilot into a 747 in flight? Yes. We need your cooperation and the fastest helicopter you've got. Now, wait a minute. You intend to put one of our men on an umbilical? {Y:i}- That's it. - How's he gonna get inside? The way the stewardess described the hole in the flight deck, it's big enough. If you'll excuse me, sir, I think it's a stupid idea. That's all we've got! What have you got to help us? There's only one man who's ever done anything like this. Major John Alexander in Air Rescue. I could try to contact him. Who is your commanding officer? - Uh... Colonel Moss, sir. - Thank you. This is Exec One out. Now the question is, can we get there in time? {Y:i} Columbia 409, Salt Lake Approach. {Y:i}We need another instrument reading, Nancy. {Y:i}Come in, Columbia 409. {Y:i}Nancy, come in, please. Come in, Nancy. Salt Lake Approach, Air Force T37 Sage 14 approaching Columbia 747. The aircraft is in level flight. The flaps are about ten degrees since the collision occurred during descent. Look, Mom, there's another airplane out there. - Where? - Right out there. - Oh... my God, there is. - An air-force jet. Jesus Christ, you can't believe this. There's a big hole in the flight deck. Doesn't look like there's any other damage. All four engines seem to be running. Hard to tell instrument damage. Most of it's near the engineer's panel. Front part looks OK. He's probably checking the damage. - I'll bet he's gonna help us. - He is. Can you see the fighter now, Nancy? It should be on your right. {Y:i}- Yes, I see it. - He'll look you over and report the damage. Nancy, the executive plane is landing here now. We'll have help up to you real soon. Good. Do you really think they can do anything? They'll do everything that can be done. You betcha. My dad runs the airlines. Well, almost. What does he mean about running this airline? My husband is vice-president of operations. Some operations! Uh-oh. There's a crease on the inboard section of the starboard wing. I see some fuel coming off the trailing edge. If this had happened at 20,000 feet, forget it. Plot a rendezvous point. Have the '47 make a 180 and bring her back. - We gotta make sure she holds altitude. - Colonel Moss is on his way. - What's the fuel situation? - We have a complication. The air-force fighter says there's a fuel leak in the right wing. - Oh, damn! - That Nancy's some woman. - She'd better be. - How much can we ask of her? - There's a call for you, Mr Patroni. - Everything, I guess. Yeah. Your information is correct, but we're clearing everything out of our LA office. Our concern is for the safety of those people. Excuse me. - Who's that? - A guy named Purcell. Owns a TV station. He's sending a remote unit. What? We don't have any bodies yet. Take it easy. We'll need all the good press we can get. Let's go find that colonel and get that rendezvous course plotted. Oh. My jewel case. It's bomb-proofed. The insurance people insisted upon it. Oh... My idea of heaven is never to have to pack or unpack. Why didn't I think of that before? Here. Here. You know what? To hell with the jewellery. Let's put my book in here. Thank you. Here you are, my darlings. It's all yours. I never wanted to have the damn thing published while I was alive anyway. Colonel, will this thing work? It'll be like putting a raw egg back in its shell. Your pilot confirmed the hole looks like it's big enough. It's a hell of a risk, a long shot. How long before that helicopter gets here? About ten minutes. I gotta clear with Washington. Make it fast. Do we have any morphine in the first-aid kit? No. I'm sure we have some sedatives. No. Help. - Yes, we'll help you. - It will put you to sleep. No. Maybe... help. I understand. He wants to stay conscious in case he can help us later on. {Y:i}Salt Lake Approach. Do you read me, Nancy? This is Nancy. Go ahead. In a while we'll take you through a 180-degree turn like we did before. Captain Murdock will talk you through it. No sweat. OK? {Y:i}- I'm not looking forward to it. - Hang in there, Nancy. You'll do fine. You're doing great. {Y:i}We want you to look at the flight engineer's panel, {Y:i}in the centre, just above the deck. {Y:i}Tell us what the third fuel-used gauge reads. Over. Uh... 22,500 pounds. Why, is something wrong? {Y:i}No, we just want to keep track of the rate of fuel flow. {Y:i}- We're not running low, are we? - No chance. There's always an extra amount just in case. And the captain always adds a few thousand pounds for his wife and kids. {Y:i}Even his mother-in-law. Nancy. Come in, Nancy. Hello, this is Nancy. Can you hear me? Come in, 409. Nancy, do you read me? Flight 409 calling Salt Lake. Nancy! Come in, 409. This is Flight 409 calling Salt Lake. Come in. - Columbia 409 calling Salt Lake. - It just went out. - I'll try it. Columbia 409. Do you read, Nancy? Come in. Come in. This is Flight 409 calling Salt Lake. Come in. - Got her. - Frequency? This is Salt Lake. 409, come in. Can you read me? Yes, thank God. What happened? A piece of wreckage fell into the radio panel. {Y:i}Don't change anything. Just stand by. Standing... Standing by. Nancy? - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. - How is it down there? - It's better. The sight of another plane kind of perked everybody up. Look. - What is it? - I don't know. Looks like it's cracked. - What's the matter? - Some fluid's coming out of the wing. There's gas coming out of the wing. - I don't wanna hear that. - He doesn't wanna hear it. - What the hell is that? - That'll be Mr Purcell. TV has arrived. He knows everybody in town. He'll get clearance to come up here. Leave her alone! What are your plans? You just sit here. I'll be back in a minute, Mrs Freeman. And don't worry. - Mr Patroni? - Yeah. Glen Purcell, KSL-TV. I know how busy you must be, but we're going on a special nationwide network hook-up. Sorry, I'm busy. Sir, this happens to be a very big story. We have Mrs Freeman downstairs and I thought you... Who's Mrs Freeman? You know. The private pilot that went down. She is his wife. What the hell's she doing here? Trying to locate her husband. Have they found him yet? We don't know. The highway patrol was alerted at the time of the collision. - Why don't you go talk to them? - You haven't bothered to find out? No. We're too busy trying to save the 120 that are up there. Why don't you just let us get on with our job? I think it would be good public relations to talk with her. It was your plane that killed him. Listen, you son of a bitch. Take it easy. Joe! Take it easy, you said. Right? Al, sometimes the public's right to know gives me a huge pain in the ass. - We've got a problem, Mr Patroni. - Yeah? We may lose radio contact. We can barely read her. She's having the same trouble. - What about another frequency? - I'm afraid to let her try. We might lose what we have. We gotta get started, Joe. Now. 409. 409, this is Joe Patroni. How do you read me, Nancy? Not very well, Mr Patroni. - How about now? - I can barely read you, Mr Patroni. - Nancy, is that my husband? - Yes. Let me talk to him. Joe? Joe, this... this is Helen. Can you hear me? Yeah. You're all doing a great job, honey, uh... We're proud of you. {Y:i}We're, uh...we're doing everything that we can here and we're almost ready. We... we have faith in you. - Uh... how is the captain? - In pain. Well, he's a good man. How... How's Joe Junior? He's fine. We love you. Ladies and gentlemen, tension is thick here at Salt Lake City airport. Just arriving is the air-force helicopter. Major John Alexander will make a dramatic attempt to rescue 120 persons trapped aboard the giant jet liner without pilot and without crew. And tragedy within tragedy, one of them a young girl dying unless she's delivered to LA soon for a kidney transplant operation. Major Alexander has volunteered to make this daring attempt. He will be lowered on a line from the air-force helicopter and will crawl through the hole torn into the body of the jumbo jet liner. Here they are now. What a moment this is. All right, we're ready here, Nancy. Remember, I'll tell you everything you have to do. You can do it. I can't hear you very well. {Y:i}Take it easy, honey. {Y:i}Very slow. Are you ready? - Ready. - All right. We're gonna turn you around to a new heading. 260 degrees. We don't want you to lose altitude, so we'll do it very slow and easy. {Y:i}Now, first you have to turn off the autopilot. {Y:i}Put both hands on the wheel. {Y:i}There's a button under your left thumb. {Y:i}Press it. There, now, honey. You've got the airplane. {Y:i}Now, read me your compass heading. Compass? OK. The arrow is on the S. OK. Look at the numbers. We're gonna turn until it reads 260 degrees. {Y:i}Are you ready? {Y:i}- Ready. - Turn the wheel to the right. {Y:i}Easy, now. Not too much. {Y:i}You're doing fine, honey. Just watch the little plane on the horizon. I'm watching. Now, read me the altimeter. 8,000 feet. Eight. {Y:i}Read it again, honey. Read it as it changes. Seven-nine, seven-eight... She's gotta get that altitude back. She's only got 1,500 feet. Keep turning just the way you're doing, honey, but at the same time ease the wheel back {Y:i}till you see the little plane lift up a bit. Nancy, have you done that? Yes, I think so. What's your airspeed? 188. Do you read me? I read you fine, honey. Now, what's your heading? Your compass heading. There's a 13,000-foot mountain right in front of her. Read me that again, Nancy. {Y:i}That's 255. 255. All right. Ease the wheel to the left now, Nancy. To the left a little. {Y:i}Nice and slow, not too much. Tell me what's happening, Nancy. Press your mike button, honey. We're turning back. The little airplane is tilting to the left. I mean back. {Y:i}All right, that's fine. Now, bring it back to level. Watch the little airplane. All right, level now. What's the airspeed now? The airspeed. Read it to me. - Now the altimeter. - It's just over 10,000 feet. She's still too low. Let George take it back now, Nancy. {Y:i}Put it back on autopilot. {Y:i}You're doing just great, honey. That helicopter's ready, gentlemen. The helicopter's ready. We're taking off now. We'll be with you in a little while. She's gonna take the tops off those mountains. - It's gonna be tight. - You want to take it, Joe? - I'm going with you, Al. - I can do it. Her altitude's critical. For God's sake, watch it. We've been damn lucky so far. Let's not push it. Try not to rattle her. {Y:i}All right, now, Nancy, we're gonna watch your altitude. Drama. And all of you across the nation are seeing it as it happens. The rescue team is going to the helicopter. Gentlemen? Gentlemen, may I have a few words? How do you propose to slow the jet down? How...? Nancy. I'm scared. I am too. Nancy, look! Nancy? Are you all right? Nancy, what happened? Salt Lake, this is Columbia 409. Come in. Salt Lake, this is Columbia 409. Come in. 409, this is Salt Lake. Do you read me? Come in, 409. This is Salt Lake. Do you read? - 409, come in, please. - What's wrong? I don't hear anybody. The frequencies. Salt Lake, come in. Salt Lake, come in. Salt Lake, come in. Nancy, come in. Do you read me? Salt Lake, come in, please. We've lost her. Why don't we have that air-force jet try his frequency again? There's a chance she can hear us. I'm gonna talk her through a climb. 409, do you read? They found the small plane. It exploded on impact. The radio's dead. We're all alone now, Bette. The winch will hold your position, OK? - Got it, sir? - Got it. You'll find you can control lateral movement somewhat. Using the wind pressure against my body. You'll have to signal us for in and out movement. I must have made 20 drops in Nam, sir. But what you're gonna do scares the hell out of me. Me too. - Nancy? - Oh, my God! Bette, we're too low. What are you supposed to do? I don't know. Uh... I know they're worried about airspeed. Now, if we climb, the airspeed drops. I could stall us out. The captain. He said he could help us. Do you understand me, Captain? Thrust levers. The thrust levers. What about them? Forward... an inch. A... all right. Anything else? 190... hold. One... nine... zero... ...airspeed. I've done a few screwy things in this outfit, but this'll be a first. She'll handle a lot like that 707 tanker you're used to flying. Once you get her on the ground, you're still three storeys in the air. I'll let you know if it's true about not making a bad landing in a 747. Control reports 409's lost radio contact. - What about the altitude? - Had they made correction? Negative. - What's our ETA at rendezvous? - A few minutes. They haven't got a few minutes. - We should see her soon. - Probably be below us. Be harder to see. - Two minutes to ETA. - She's gotta be out there somewhere. There she is. She's flying it. She's flying it herself. Climb, baby. Climb. Look at the mountains. We're so close. Ready, sir? - I'll see you in Salt Lake. - Lower away. Ease him down. Just a little. Steady. - Oh, dear God, he fell! - God Almighty. - Oh, God. - Get me one of those suits. - But, sir... - Get the suit! You're not gonna do it. - Who's gonna stop me? - I am! You got anybody else up here knows how to fly that bloody plane? This is just plain suicide, sir. We can't let you wear a chute. It might pull you up into the blades. - She's falling off. - Tell the chopper. - This the tether release? - Yes, sir. She's losing altitude. Get me out of here before I change my mind. Yeah! Yeah. He made it. The pilot's on the plane. Salt Lake Approach, the pilot is now aboard Columbia 747. Flying straight and level. Your hand. I'll get you something. - Damn, that's all we need. - What is it? Number three engine's awful hot. I'll shut it down. Tell the passengers it's just a precaution. - OK. - Tell 'em, baby. Please may I have your attention? Captain Murdock is now aboard and is flying this plane. Please. He wants me to tell you that everything is under control. However, he will also have to shut down one of the engines, - which seems to be running a little roughly. - We're gonna die. But there is nothing to be alarmed about. Nothing. Where are you going, Arnie? Arnie? Come back here. Leave them alone up there. Look, uh... is everything all right? - There is a pilot on board, right? - Yes, sir, there is. I must tell him something. I saw something out the window. Please, sir, you're not allowed up there. Please, sir, don't go up there. I don't want you to go... - What's going on? - The gas is leaking out of the wing. We've got plenty of fuel in the other tanks. Go back and sit down. - What about fire? It might explode. - There's no danger. - My God! - Get him the hell out of here! Please, sir, we know about the fuel. Now, it's being handled. It's all right. We're handling it, OK? Go and sit down and relax. It's fine. I'll get you a drink. Look at this. The collision wiped out so many instruments, I can't tell what's working and what isn't. We are gonna be able to land, aren't we? You tell me. I don't know if I can get the landing gear down, and I can't tell if it's locked into position. There's nothing I can do about it. How's Stacy? - Not good. - The radio too? The radio's dead. I've tried every channel. Well, here we go. Let's see if you can land one of these things by the seat of your pants. - How long before we land? - Two minutes. Salt Lake, this is Patroni. We're on our way down. We're gonna need ambulances for the girl and the injured crew. Hit the red button. Clear the field. Go have the passengers fasten their seat belts. Tell the giris to hang on. Go do your thing, baby. - Are we OK? Have you heard anything? - Nothing. Let's get back to work. Prepare for landing. Remember the intercom systems aren't working. Honey, we'll have to stow this for landing. I'll take good care of it. Buckle yourself in. They went down, baby. Just hope they're locked. Almost home. - Are we landing? - Yes, Janice. I knew we'd be all right. - Nancy? - Yes? I love you. Over the fence. - Damn! - What's the matter? Brake pressure's dropping. I don't know if we've got enough left to stop. Jesus! This mother's got ten back-up systems too. He can't stop her! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for flying Columbia Airlines. Unfasten seat belts. Let's go. Quick. Are we here already? Are we here already? No, we've gone to Washington. - Are we here already? - What's going on? The ambulance will take you to the hospital. They're ready for the transplant. All right, get in there. No, Miss Swanson. You can't take that with you. I'll... You'll get it later. Jump! Let's go. Get out of here. I really was in that picture. Remember when the kids walked into... ran into the, uh... hamburger shop? - I was the short-order cook. - I don't remember. One of the hamburgers hit me on the head. - I've got a scar. - I believe you. That's a big pussy-cat, Dad. No, it's a tomcat. Oh, it's so beautiful. Every morning is beautiful. You're just too young to know., It's hard to remember now, but Europe was like this in 1944. The Second World War was in its fifth year... ...and still going Hitler's way. German troops controlled most of Europe. D-Day changed all that. D-Day: June 6, 1944... ...when the Allied forces, under their commander General Eisenhower... ...landed on the northern coast of France. By July they were able to begin their own offensive. By August, Paris was liberated. Everywhere the Germans retreated. But with the Allied victories came problems. Supplies still had to be driven from Normandy, over 400 miles away... ...and became dangerously short. The Allied advance began to come to a halt. Another problem facing Eisenhower was this: His two most famous generals... Patton, who was in the south... ...and Montgomery in the north... disliked each other intensely. The longstanding rivalry had never been more fierce. There simply were not enough supplies for both armies. Each wanted to be the one to defeat the Germans. Each wanted to beat the other to Berlin. In September, 1944... Montgomery devised a new and spectacular plan... ...given the code name ""Market Garden."" Eisenhower, under great pressure from his superiors... ...finally sided with Montgomery... ...and Operation Market Garden became a reality. The plan, like so many plans in so many wars before it... ...was meant to end the fighting by Christmas... ...and bring the boys back home. What is that noise? - Can I look out? - No, they might shoot us. The Germans have collapsed. Then the war is over? Soon. But what is that noise? Panic. You may begin. May I first be permitted to say, and I think I speak for all of us... ...how pleased we are, Field Marshal Von Rundstedt... ...that you have been reappointed commander of our forces in the West. Speeches are for victory celebrations. Let's get to the point. Air power? Air power, Field Marshal? Briefly, please. - Air power is minimal. - Ammunition? Also minimal. Tanks... Troops... Replacements? - Minimal. - Morale? Nonexistent. What do you think we should do? End the war, you fools. - Why in the world are you laughing? - Excuse us. We have such confidence in you. Everyone knows you have never lost a battle. I'm still young. Give me time. The first thing we must do... ...is to turn this rabble into something like an army. Anything at all on when they plan to invade Holland? They seem to have paused in Belgium. Most likely supply problems. Otherwise we can't imagine why. I think it's because we're retreating... ...faster than they can advance. How many vehicles in the past hour? Fifty-four. And for the same hour yesterday? Ninety-eight. Last week your mother and I could have captured Holland alone. Already the panic has stopped. It isn't over yet and those idiots don't realize it. - War takes time. - Listen to the expert. I was nine when they got here. Next month I'll be 14. I ought to know something. Father, the Allies will come? But when? I've just got back to England from Brussels... ...where I had a meeting this morning with Field Marshal Montgomery. There was an earlier one with General Eisenhower. They both feel, as I do... ...that when the Field Marshal's plan has succeeded... ...we should be able to end the war by Christmas... ...in less than 100 days. Actually, the plan is really very simple. We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles, and drop them behind enemy lines. It'll be the largest airborne operation ever mounted. Quite frankly, this kind of thing's never been attempted before. - Where's this all going to take place? - Holland. - And when? - I'm coming to that now. Right. The ground forces: 30 Corps, commanded by General Horrocks, 20,000 vehicles. And this, as you know, is the German front line. Now we're going to lay a carpet, as it were, of airborne troops... ...over which 30th Corps can pass. We shall seize the bridges... it's all a question of bridges... With thunderclap surprise... ...and hold them until they can be secured. Now first of all, General Maxwell Taylor... ...Eindhoven. You take and hold the bridges there with 101 st. General Gavin, with your 82nd... ...you get Nijmegen. You take and hold the bridges. And Roy, you get the prize: Arnhem. Arnhem Bridge. - And you hold it. - For how long? Monty assures me that 30 Corps... ...will do the 63 miles in two days. Sixty-three miles in two days. - They oughta be able to handle that. - Oh, I'm sorry. General Sosabowski, you go with your Polish Brigade with Roy Urquhart. I'm so sorry. Roy... ...when you've secured your bridge... ...and 30th Corps have got across it, we can turn east... ...right into the industrial heart of Germany... the Ruhr. Once we control their factories, there's not much they can do about it. And that is the plan. And we go next Sunday. Seven days? Why not? The sooner we go, the better. We've got them on the run. Is something troubling you, General Sosabowski? - I've said nothing. - Precisely. Your silences are thunderous. General Browning, I... I am a Pole... ...considered by some to be smart. If that is so... ...it makes me member of a true minority group. Minority groups are more comfortable in silence. I should have thought the opposite was true. But you do disapprove? I am thrilled that your great Field Marshal Montgomery has devised a plan. I promise you, I'll be properly ecstatic if it works. When it works. Of course. When it works. Thank you. Well, now let's get down to the details. First we shall have to have... From which direction will their attack come, and who will command? Montgomery or Patton? - Model, what do you think? - Patton. He is their best. Patton will lead the assault. I would prefer Montgomery... ...but even Eisenhower isn't that stupid. Bittrich's panzer troops need some rest... ...if they're to stop Patton. We should pull them back somewhere safe. Safe, quiet, out of the way. But where? Arnhem? Arnhem. - I'll be in touch. - That'll be fine. Why the emergency meeting? - Keeping abreast of the little changes. - How big are the little changes? I'll answer you with typical British understatement: gigantic. They can't get us all in at once. Too many men, too much equipment, not enough planes. It's going to take three days to get the men into Arnhem, Poles and the British. - How about us? - We'll be all right. Aside from the fact that we'll parachute in daylight, we have no worries. Daylight? - Has it ever been tried before? - Not in a major drop. - Think there might be a reason for that? - Let's hope not. - What do you think? - It'll be all right. It's a ""no moon"" period anyway. We have to go in daylight. Just so they get us over the target area, half a mile away. Three-quarters of a mile... I'll settle for that. I don't want to hear anything else. - Is there anything else? - Well, you're my Dutch advisor, Harry. I forgot to tell you something? Only that the Germans first tried to take Nijmegen Bridge themselves... ...back in 1940, and got slaughtered. Go back! Go back! Do as I say! But my friend lives down the road. It's my birthday and she has a present for me. Please let me through. All right. Be quick. Are you sure about the colors? I'm sure, Father. Believe me. Model? A field marshal in Arnhem? Why? The British will have an explanation. Did you pass on the message about the tanks? Of course. But Model is something more important. You're a good boy and a wonderful spy. Now go and help your mother with supper. - Sir? - Yes, Fuller? - We've got some information on tanks. - What? Dutch Underground reports from the Arnhem area. - Established their strength? - No, sir, but I've got... - Have they been identified? - Not by our intelligence, sir. So it's the same rumors as before, right? - I believe these rumors, sir. - Why? The general consensus of opinion is that our opposition... ...will consist entirely of Hitler Youth or old men on bicycles. I don't really know why, sir. Perhaps because no one in Intelligence does. I just want to be sure our airborne carpet... ...consists of live troops, not dead ones. I know everybody thinks I'm overanxious, sir... ...but I would like to order another low-level reconnaissance of the area. If that's all right with you, sir. Very well. All right, Wilson. Very well. I wouldn't be too concerned about what people think of you. You happen to be somewhat brighter than most of us. Tends to make us nervous. Naturally we'll do our utmost to meet your tactical requirements, sir. But please keep in mind... ...the one factor which is crippling all our plans. It may seem improbable to you... ...but we are desperately short of transport aircraft. I am aware of that. I was surprised that nobody mentioned it to Monty when he dreamed up this plan. I need drop zones as close as possible to the bridge. This area's no use at all. Can't have my chaps landing on chimney tops, but this looks inviting here. - What's the terrain like? - Sorry, sir. Our reports indicate that this terrain is too soft for glider landings. The nose digs in first on touchdown, the thing goes ass over tip. Total write-off. All right. - What about there? - Afraid not, sir. You see, after the drop, when we bank for our return... ...we run into a whole lot of flak... ...from this Jerry airfield up here at Deelen. Presumably you're intending to let us land somewhere? Oh, yes. Hopefully, sir. But as I was saying, we cannot afford to lose a single aircraft. That is the problem. My problem is, I don't just need drop zones. I need drop zones I can hold and defend. The rest of my division arrives with the second drop... ...and General Sosabowski's Polish Brigade with the third. I understand, sir, but we really think we've found the right place. It's large enough for your needs, it's flat and firm. - It's also easily defended. - Where the hell is it? Well, it's not actually on this photograph. It should be... Excuse me, sir... It would be about here, I think. That could be ten miles from the bridge. It's just under eight actually, sir, if you'd like to have a look at this. You see, the terrain is easy to traverse. All our information substantiates that. Yes, sir? Just making sure whose side you're on. Now, a drop zone eight miles from Arnhem Bridge... ...might be thought by some to present problems. My God, he can't mean it. I'm afraid he does. Must know what he's doing. That's more than I know. Why should he have a corner on the market? ...cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered ideal. But the gliders will be bringing in a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps... ...specially fitted with twin Vickers machine guns. The instant we land, they will race ahead to the bridge... ...and hold it... ...until the other battalions arrive on foot. And they'll be quick enough to secure both ends of Arnhem Bridge? - Most certainly. - Good. My headquarters will be in the center with 82nd. Now, just you remember that we're all totally interlocked. This is a bottom-to-top operation. 101 st pass 30 Corps on to 82nd. 82nd pass them on to British Airborne. If any one group fails, it's total failure for us all. All we need now are three days of clear skies. Thank you, gentlemen, very much. Only the weather can stop us now. Weather! Cristos!  What of the Germans? Don't you think that since we know... ...that Arnhem is so crucial to their safety, they might know that too? Now look here. The few troops in the area are... ...second class. They're not front-line caliber. Not at all. Do you understand? You ought to have more faith in Montgomery's intelligence reports. He's done pretty well for us in the last three or four years. I will tell you the extent of my faith. I'm thinking of asking for a letter from you... ...stating that I was forced to act on your orders... ...in case my men are massacred. I see. Yes, I do see. Do you wish such a letter? Of course not. In the case of massacre, what difference would it make? - You don't believe me, sir? - Clearly not. All right, boys, Naafi's up. Take your break. God Almighty! Sorry about that, sir. But what then? I just don't believe these damn radios are strong enough... ...to carry the eight miles from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge. Don't happen to have any cigarettes, do you, sir? They're perfectly okay. I've used them God knows how many times. You've already told me that God knows how many times. Well, I didn't have any problems with them in the desert. Yes, I know, but you see, Cole... ...what genuinely and truly has me more than a bit disturbed is that Holland... ...being half underwater, is soggier than most deserts you're apt to find. Tends to have a lot more trees. - Any biscuits? - Your biscuits are in your tin, sir. Shouldn't you tell the general if you're so certain about it, sir? If I were, believe me, I would. - What if they really don't work? - What difference will it make? The general will be on the bridge himself by nightfall. He won't have to make contact with the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir? Well, if anyone rocks the boat... ...it's not gonna be me. The regular projector chap's at lunch, sir. I'll have it in a moment. You're doing splendidly, Fuller. Don't worry. I don't need lunch. Damn. Nearly there, sir. It's really worth your time, sir. Believe me. There. Splendid view of the Dutch countryside. Can't see any tanks. Wait a moment, sir. It's a lot clearer in the next picture. If I can just... Now. - Next. - Yes, sir. I've had this one enlarged. I shouldn't worry about them. But, sir, you see that they are tanks. I doubt if they're fully serviceable. - Still got guns. - So have we. But, sir... ...if they weren't serviceable, why would they try to conceal them? Normal routine, Fuller. But, sir, we keep getting reports from the Dutch Underground. I've read them! And so has Field Marshal Montgomery. Now look here. There have been thousands of photographs from this sortie and from the others. - How many of them have shown tanks? - Just these, sir. And you seriously consider asking us to cancel... ...the biggest operation mounted since D-Day... ...because of three photographs? No, sir. Sixteen consecutive drops have been cancelled in the last few months... ...for one reason or another. But this time the party's on... ...and no one is going to call it off. Is that fully understood? Yes, sir. Thank you, Waddy. Thank you, gentlemen. Do sit down, gentlemen. Please sit down. Look after these. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Gentlemen, this is a story that you will tell your grandchildren... ...and mightily bored they'll be. The plan is called Operation Market Garden. Market is the airborne element, and Garden the ground forces... That's us. Now this is our position on the Belgian border here. Tomorrow, three airborne divisions will begin landing in Holland... Thirty-five thousand men taking off from 24 airfields... ...in troop-carrying planes or towed in gliders. The American 101 st here... ...around Eindhoven... ...the American 82nd here... ...south of Nijmegen... ...and our own 1 st Airborne boys and a Polish brigade... ...here at Arnhem... ...sixty-four miles... ...behind enemy lines. Now, their job is to take and hold... ...all the bridges in these three areas. Our job is to punch a hole... ...through the German front line here... ...and then drive like hell up this road... ...linking up with each airborne division on the way up. Speed is the vital factor. The plan is to reach Eindhoven in two to three hours... ...and Arnhem in two to three days. That, gentlemen, is the prize: The bridge over the Rhine... ...the last bridge between us and Germany. Kickoff will be at 1435 hours tomorrow afternoon. The Irish Guards, under the command of Colonel Vandeleur, will take the lead. - Christ, not us again. - What do you say to that, Joe? Delighted, sir. Truly delighted. I've selected you to lead us... ...not only because of your extraordinary fighting ability... ...but also because... ...in the unlikely event that the Germans ever get you... ...they'll assume from your attire that they've captured a wretched peasant... ...and immediately send you on your way. Now, maintaining the speed of our advance... ...will no doubt be tough going, as it's a single highway. But no matter what... ...we must reach those 1 st Airborne boys in 48 hours. Now, gentlemen... ...I'm not saying that this will be the easiest party... ...that we've ever attended... ...but I still wouldn't miss it for the world. I like to think of this... ...as one of those American Western films. The paratroops, lacking substantial equipment... ...always short of food... These are the besieged homesteaders. The Germans... well, naturally they're the bad guys. And 30 Corps... We, my friends, are the cavalry... ...on the way to the rescue. Do you want me to pack that as well, sir? No, thank you, Wicks. I'll carry it. You haven't forgotten my golf clubs, have you? They'll be coming later in the staff car, sir. And what about... Sorry, sir? What about my dinner jacket? Are you sure you'll be needing that, sir? Well, let's hope so. Why don't you quit that? Chock-full of vitamins. Here, Eddie. Have a little strength. Hey, where'd you put that? - Damn it, Eddie, give it back. - Right. There you are. I wish you hadn't done that. My problem is, I'm not totally crazy about the prospect of dyin'. So don't die. Drinkin' that garbage isn't gonna keep you alive. What is? - Not gettin' shot. - And what can guarantee that? Nothin', for sure. - You will. - I will what? You tell me, Eddie. You tell me I won't die. All right, you won't die. No, no. Guarantee me. I want you to guarantee me I won't die. I guarantee you. Come on. Let's get some food in you. I wasn't kidding. Hey, Eddie, were you kidding? Major Fuller. My name is Sims. Mind a bit of company? Of course not, sir. Busy times. You must be exhausted. Are you exhausted? Who isn't? We've been getting reports from a number of your friends. They're worried about you. They think perhaps you need a rest. We all need rest. Why are you saying this to me? Is it because I rocked the boat? I'm a doctor. I'm only concerned with your health. I think perhaps you ought to take a bit of sick leave. But why? I'm not ill or anything. I haven't done anything wrong. Of course not. You're just a little tired. I am tired. I think perhaps we might go. Can't it be stopped? I don't want to be left behind, please. It's out of my hands, laddie. I didn't want to miss the party. Move it, buddy. That's the way. Home, sweet home. When you think we only had seven days to get everything organized, it's quite a... Boody miracle. It took six months to set up the D-Day drop... ...and that was only half as big as this. - How do you feel? - Fine. I'll feel even better when we're in Holland. Do you remember when I was appointed to this command... ...I told you I had never jumped, but thought I ought to give it a go? - Well, you did me a big favor. - Really? What? You said, ""Roy, you're far too old for that kind of thing, and much too large."" Did I? What was the favor? Well, I didn't quite tell you everything at the time... ...but I'm prone to airsickness. Good gracious. What, every flight? Well, we'll soon find out, won't we? Go on! Get that goddamn jeep outta here! Who would true valor see Let him come hither One here will constant be Come wind Come weather There's no discouragement Soon be home, Harry. - Better than the desert, eh, sir? - What was that? Easier than walking, sir. If you say so, Hancock. Yeah, fine, sir. The artillery should be able to clear the way very well. Your initial advance. Yes, we'll move off as soon as their barrage has got going. - Yes, that's absolutely fine. - Follow behind it as close as we can. But you know... ...this isn't gonna be the pushover that everybody seems to think it is. No, I didn't think so. Morning, Alan. Your sleeping beauties know there's a war on, do they? Absolutely, sir. Is it true that the Germans have put more troops into the line ahead of us? Yes. They obviously don't intend to just let us walk in the front door. Hello, Bob! Hope that's not my funeral they're going to. And I'm still desperately worried... ...about having them throw everything up this road. But there's no alternative. Morning, Tom. So I've decided to run the road like a railway. Nobody, repeat, nobody will be allowed... ...to put any vehicle on that road without my permission. - Including me? - Good luck to you! You too! Especially you, Joe. Morning, Derek! Glad to see somebody knows where we're going. Time, Joe. That's the killer. We can't afford to drop behind schedule. So for God's sake, keep your tanks on the move. Good God Almighty. That's just the 101 st. The other two groups are on the northern route. H hour in 90 minutes. - I'd better be going, sir. - Right you are, Joe. - Any last-minute changes, Bob? - Yes, sir. If the advance runs into difficulty, we call in the Air Force with purple smoke. First class. And good luck, Joe! Thank you, sir. Think you'll be able to manage it? I've got nothing else planned for this afternoon. I told you you should have had the bloody thing out. What the hell's that? It's flak. General Bittrich! In here, Matthias. Fantastic, isn't it? Just once to have such power in my hands. Red on. Come on, move yourselves! If there's no more opposition than this on the road, we should be all right. Where the hell do you think you're going? B Company, to me! A Company, over there! Excuse the interruption, Field Marshal, but... ...British paratroopers have landed... ...three kilometers from here. Why should they do that? There is nothing important here. Me! I am important. They must all be coming just to capture me. Call my chauffeur and car. Evacuate the headquarters. And don't forget my cigars. General! - You all right? - Yeah. Okay, you guys, gather your stuff and move! - This is it, Jim. - Okay, sir. You okay? Right! Let's go! Then keep trying. There must be someone there! My apologies. I can get no sense from anybody. They say thousands of troops are dropping over Holland. - Yes, west of Arnhem. - Right on top of Field Marshal Model. I can't get through to his headquarters. A strong force has landed south of Nijmegen. Nijmegen? They're after the bridge. That doesn't matter. Perhaps they've landed in the Field Marshal's soup. Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Now listen. I'll take care of Arnhem. You get to Nijmegen as fast as you can. Take anything that'll move... ...every man that can walk, and hold the bridge. No. Field Marshal Model. Nothing must cross it. Is that clear? You must hold that bridge under any circumstances. - Understood? - Clear. Ryan and Ross, come with me. Cover the right flank. How far away is headquarters? Half a mile. Maybe more. Brigadier Lathbury's just left, sir. Johnny Frost and the 2nd Battalion are on the river road. Good. Thank you, Baker. Any news of Freddie Gough's jeep squadron? - It's unconfirmed... - It's rather bad luck, sir. Considering how few gliders we lost on the way in. It appears that a lot of the special jeeps failed to arrive... ...and those that did have been badly shot up in an ambush. So no one's going to get to Arnhem Bridge except on foot. Splendid. They must be from the lunatic asylum, located on the far side of the wood. They escaped when it was bombed this morning. Do you think they know something we don't? All guns, commence firing! Right, get moving. Get moving. Driver, advance. Start the purple! Start the purple! Take cover! - Loading! - Fire! Get the wounded down the line. Get that wreck off the road. Joe, how the hell... How the hell do they expect us to keep to schedule on a road like this? You don't know the worst. - This bit we're on now... - Yes? It's the wide part. Peter, the general's coming in. - How's it going now? - Not too well, sir. We haven't been able to make contact with General Browning... ...30 Corps or England. So no one knows we've arrived safely. Not as far as we know, sir. What about those VHF sets? Well, sir, it appears the sets have been delivered with the wrong crystals. - So they're quite useless? - Yes, sir, I'm afraid they are. Are Brigadier Lathbury and Colonel Frost aware of what happened... ...to the special jeep squadron? - Not as far as we know. At the moment we're unable to contact any of the units moving into Arnhem. Not a very satisfactory state of affairs. We can't quite understand it. It's perfectly good equipment. Then for God's sake, get it sorted out... ...before we have a bloody disaster on our hands. Sir. Hancock... ...I've got lunatics laughing at me from the woods. My original plan has been scuppered now that the jeeps haven't arrived. My communications have completely broken down. Do you really believe that any of that can be helped... ...by a cup of tea? Couldn't hurt, sir. Forgive me for returning, Field Marshal. I must press for permission... ...if it becomes necessary... ...to blow up the bridges at Arnhem and Nijmegen. That is out of the question. Never. Is that clear? We need them for our counterattack. Counterattack? With what? Paratroopers cannot fight long. They are too lightly equipped. Isolated they are lost. I have spoken to Von Rundstedt. All reinforcements come to us first. Every hour we get stronger and they grow weaker. - But if we blow the bridges... - They don't want the bridges. Do you really think if they wanted the bridges... ...they would have landed 12 kilometers away? It's ridiculous. Thank you for the tea. Our lightning-like assault on Arnhem Bridge... ...is certainly a smashing success. I've an aversion to apples. I'm so sorry. I'm sure the Germans will be thunderstruck with surprise. - Are there many of you? - Yes, there are thousands of us. - Thank you for coming. - Thank you. Look here, this isn't a victory parade. Come on, sir, enjoy the moment. I will enjoy the moment when we reach the bridge... ...and when we find the bridge intact. It will be. Things couldn't be going better. - Nothing's wrong. - I know. That's exactly what is wrong. Jesus Christ! Stay down! Shit. There's still no contact. Then keep at it. I shall be back shortly. Brigadier Lathbury can't have gone that far. All right, Brown. I'm sure we'll have them fixed by the time you get back, sir. Can you get a message down to 30th Corps on that dingus? Yes, sir. We just got word from the 82nd up ahead. They've captured the Grave Bridge completely intact. That's terrific, except 30th Corps... ...ain't about to reach the goddamn intact Grave Bridge... ...until the goddamn Son Bridge gets fixed. Tell our British cousins to hustle up some Bailey stuff. I'll meet 'em in Eindhoven when they get there. Tell those schmucks to do this right and have their Bailey stuff at the front. Got that? And be sure to say please. Joe, I make it just over six miles to Eindhoven. We won't make it tonight. It'll be dark shortly. Well, I hope to God the 101 st can hang on till tomorrow. Giles, remember what the general said: ""We're the cavalry."" It would be bad form to arrive in advance of schedule. In the nick of time would do nicely. These plans should have been left in England. They're top secret. And now we have all we need... Units, defense plans, objectives... ...and the schedule for further drops. I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge for demolition... ...if I blow it up tonight. This Operation Market Garden must fail. Why do all my generals want to destroy my bridges? Come, Ludwig. We'll have dinner. Dinner? But what about these plans? These plans? They are false. Just a trick. We were supposed to find them. White wine or red? We're still getting nothing from Colonel Frost's battalion on the river road. - Thank you, Cole. - Dog-Charlie-Fox. Over. Let's hope Johnny's meeting less resistance than we are. - We must break through to the bridge. - We're completely blocked ahead of us. There's a good deal more resistance than we've been led to expect. I must see for myself how he's doing. All right, Cole. - What is their strength? - I can't estimate yet. Some Dutch Underground people were here earlier trying to explain the situation. I'm not sure how much they know. Stretcher bearer, bring that stretcher over here to these men! - What about Brown? - They've both had it. Christ Almighty! They've gone round behind us. I think it might be safer if you spent the night with us. - I've got to get back to H.Q. - Yes, but alive, sir. If we can reach them, there are some houses in that direction. We can get ourselves organized and try and find out what's happening. Pull him out! - Right. - Sergeant Major. Come on, lads. Get a move on. - Something just occurred to me. - What's that, sir? We're wearing the wrong camouflage. It's all very well for the country, but we won't fool anyone in the towns. Come on. I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid we're going to have to occupy your house. - All right, chaps, we're in here. - The house on the other side. - Section Two, over here. - Dick. Now, take your men, occupy that house across the road. Make sure you can cover the bridge from your side. Sergeant, follow me. Hello, Dog-Charlie-Fox. Rip down those curtains, pile this furniture against the window. We've reached our objective. What is your position? Over. There's nothing. I can't contact Brigade at all, sir. Tried the other battalions? Any luck? Keep trying. - Order them out. - Please, Mother. - This is my house. - Perhaps by tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes, Mother. Shall we have a go at the far end now, sir? ""Having a go"" is hardly textbook terminology, Harry. But you'll let us try, sir? Down! Take cover! Cover fire! Quick! Smoke! Come on, lads! Come on. Keep going. Give us a hand. Fall back! Hurry. - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. We'll deal with them later... ...when it gets dark. - Made it so far, Doddsie? - Aye. Better hit that slit first time. Hey, Corp, I said you'd better hit that slit first time or... I heard you, boyo. Oh, great. After you, Corp. Come on. Let's get on with it. Now! Now we're in trouble. You bloody missed it! You knocked my arm, you clumsy bastard. Now we'll never get out of here. We've hit an ammunition dump, a bloody ammo dump. Shit! Fool's courage. She says you are much too noisy. She does realize there is something of a war going on, doesn't she? She has never liked noise. She hates it. They're coming. Excuse me. Many of them? Can't tell, sir. We can only hear them at the moment. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Fire! Command. Wait for the command. Over there with it. Look after that man. Open fire! Fire! Keep firing. Come on. Cease firing. Sorry, ma'am. Try and rustle up some more bandages, will you? Lad, you'll be all right. See you later. Get him patched up, Doc. I'm terribly sorry about all this. - Wicks. - Sir. Right, off you go. Get that bloody stretcher inside! All right. Here we go. Good morning. Mr. Cornish is straight through there. Right. Thank you. Hello, Dick. It's all right. Sit down. - You all right? - Fine. It's only a flesh wound. - How are things? - Not too bad, sir. What is bad is this. - Careful. - Sorry. We hold the north end of the bridge. The Germans hold the south. But now they probably control most of the town... ...including the church tower. What you're saying is that we're surrounded. Yes, something like that. - What else? - Sir. I was a bit surprised to find Bittrich's panzer troops here, sir. Yes, well, surely you didn't believe all that nonsense they told us. I mean, about the enemy being made up of old men, children. We'll have to risk it. It's halfway through the morning, and things aren't getting any better. - Sergeant, how is it? - Sir. We can't clear the streets. Enemy strength keeps increasing. It's impossible to get through to the bridge. Thanks, Sergeant. It's imperative I get back to H.Q. before the situation gets out of hand. If it's all right with you, Cleminson and I will come part of the way. - All right, Jimmy? - Let's move. End house, bottom window, sir. Cleminson, get over here. Hang on, Gerald. In here. Come on. Can't you move your legs? Must be the spine. Can you help us? - How? - Don't you know a doctor nearby? We can take him to the hospital. You go. He will be fine. Go, sir. You go. Go up. They're certainly at the back. What's it like at the front? We're surrounded. Yes. Quite. I was rather expecting to see you again, General Sosabowski. Do please sit down. The Polish drop has been cancelled again. I would like an explanation. Well, I expect the fog has a certain amount to do with it. I'm told there are aircraft flying 50 miles to the south. Explain to me why my men and equipment cannot be moved from here to there... ...and then fly to Arnhem. That's a very reasonable question. I don't want to bother you with a lot of meteorological mumbo jumbo... ...but the fact is, you see, whether we like it or not... ...fog... it moves. Of course it moves. Where? That's very difficult to say, General. It's very slippery stuff, fog. You think you've got it, then it reverses itself... ...and leaves you behind. Won't you please sit down? What I'm trying to say, General... ...is even if we move your troops the 50 miles... I grant you, now the sun is shining... ...the chances are that by the time we get there... ...the fog could quite easily have preceded us. - So we simply have to wait. - And do nothing. I think that puts it rather well. Hey, you! You Vandeleur? - Yeah. - I'm Bobby Stout. How do you do? Hell of a day, huh? Look at 'em... wild. Have you ever been liberated? - I got divorced twice. Does that count? - Yes, that counts. Hey, that Bailey crap. You got it amongst this stuff? When you refer to Bailey crap... ...I take it you mean that glorious precision-made British-built bridge... ...which is the envy of the civilized world. - Yeah. - The trucks are down there somewhere. But how you're going to get them through this crowd, I don't know. No problem. I got a side road pegged out that'll avoid all this. - American ingenuity. - Oh, really? Actually I was born in Yugoslavia, but what the hell. Yes. Okay, I'll take it, sir. - Where the hell have you been? - With some Dutch friends at Nijmegen. Look. This is why we can't take the bridge. The Germans have moved in S.S. panzer troops. You'd think they didn't want us to get across or something. They've sealed off the whole area. Here. You can see on this map. Every street leading to the bridge is blocked. Every house around it is occupied. The Dutch Underground people say it's just impossible to break through. They could be right. - Where's the captain? - Dead. I didn't ask you how he was. I asked you where he was. Orderly, we're all out of bandages over here. - Sir. - Not now. - I'd like you to look at my captain. - I'm sorry. Put him down. What in the name of hell do you... - You told me to put him down. - I'm in no mood for crapping around. If you don't look at him right now, he's going to die. He's dead now. It'd mean a lot to me if you'd check him out. Come on, Sergeant. For Christ's sake, get him out of here. Would you look at him, please, sir... ...right now... ...or I'll blow your fuckin' head off. Right now. I can give him a quick examination, if you like. Thank you very much, sir. Son of a bitch. Orderly! Well, I got the bullet out of his skull. - He's gonna live though, right? - He's gonna have one hell of a headache. Guess you can turn me in now, sir. That was a court-martial offense. You understand that? - Yes, sir. - Hope to hell it was worth it. Guess only time will tell on that, sir. My response is strictly limited, regardless of my personal preference. - You understand that too? - I do. Like somebody cheating in school. Once word gets out that you can behave any way you goddamn please... ...discipline's gone, forget about getting it back. So you're gonna have to be arrested, over and out. Lieutenant Rafferty. Yes, sir, Colonel. Lieutenant Rafferty, this is Sergeant... What's your name? Eddie Dohun. Sergeant Dohun pulled a gun on me and threatened to kill me... ...unless I did precisely what he ordered. - I want you to put him under arrest. - Yes, sir. I want you to keep him there for at least ten seconds. - I'm not all that sure I understand. - Count to ten, Lieutenant, fast. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Like that? Thank you, Lieutenant. This is yours, I think. It sure looks like mine. You scared the shit out of me, you stupid bastard. You did a fine job yourself, if it makes you feel any better. Goddamn right it does. - Eddie? - Sir. You wouldn't really have killed me, would you? Thank you, sir. Right! Let's haul a little ass! Go! Hold! Hold! Move it. Come on, soldier, you're not building a sand castle. Come on, boys. Use your muscle. Heave. Come on, heave! Unload quickly. - It's all right, sir. - Come on, move yourself. We haven't got all day. Come on, push! Altogether, lift! Come on, soldier, pound it. We've got a schedule to meet. Steady. Hold it. - How much longer now? - About another four hours, sir. Shit. Come on, boys. We're not doing this for fun. - Hey, soldier, get over here. - Yes, sir. - Pull on this rope. - Yes, sir. Didn't you ever build a Bailey bridge before? Neither did I. Clear the way! Clear! We haven't got all day. Roll it, fellas! Right. Come on. All aboard. Let's get moving again. - Thanks, fellas. - Be seeing you. - What's wrong, sir? - They're 36 hours behind schedule. Lieutenant. Sir. We'll be turning you over to the 82nd now. They're good soldiers, the 82nd. Just be sure you keep your hand on your wallet at all times. Yes, sir. They're here. It's 30 Corps. They're here, chaps. You're late, you lazy bastard, but we'll forgive you! That was gracious of me. Take cover! Bring up the Piat. Make sure it's within range. Come on! You'll miss him. Right, lads! Go, go! Corporal! I need a jeep. Well done, laddie. - We thought you were dead. - I can assure you it was an error. That was the bleeding general. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning, sir. Carry on, thank you. Good morning, Baker. Good morning, James. Harry. Apologies for my enforced absence. Dennis. - Sir. - Lathbury's been put out of action. I'd like you to go into town, take over the brigade. - How soon can you leave? - Right away. Pull them together and keep pushing forward to the bridge. Did the rest of the division arrive safely? Yes, but we've run into all kinds of trouble. It would seem that we've landed on top of two S.S. panzer divisions. Good God. As you can imagine, it's hard to stop tanks... ...with rifles and machine guns. - Show me. You can see what we're up against. Johnny Frost and some of his chaps have managed to get as far as the bridge. But the Germans are driving down here towards the river... ...and may even now have cut them off completely. Now the entire division is here, we should be able to break through to him. It certainly gives us more of a chance. Sosabowski's Polish brigade is due in at 12:00. If it arrives. Yesterday's airlift was three hours late due to fog in England. The gliders bringing the Poles' equipment didn't arrive at all. - Now give me the good news. - I'm afraid there isn't any, sir. As you can see, we're more or less surrounded. So far we're holding our own, but we're desperately short of food, medicine... ...and above all, ammunition. - Are we getting our daily supply drop? - Oh, yes. The Royal Air Force are flying in on schedule. The trouble is, the Germans have overrun the dropping zones. - Don't our pilots know that? - I'm afraid not, sir. In heaven's name, why? It's the radios, sir. We still haven't been able to make contact with anyone outside Arnhem. Fools! Boody fools, this way! We're over here! We're here! - This way. - Drop 'em over here. What the hell are they doing? They must be able to see us. They can see us all right, laddie... ...but they're under orders to ignore signals from the ground. For all they know, we could be Germans. They're giving it all to the bloody Germans. Charles. Poor bastard. Oh, well, maybe tomorrow. Here. He'll never make it. Those bleeding snipers will get him. Come back! Come on, Ginger mate. - He'll never lift it. - Come on, mate! Bring it back, mate. Come on. Come on! Run, laddie, run! Oh, Jesus Christ! Taxi! - Do you get all that? - She wants somebody to call her a taxi. Taxi. - Doctor. - Good evening, Kate. May I introduce Mrs. Ter Horst, Colonel Weaver. Is your husband not returned yet? He should have been here by now. He must be having difficulties coming through the German lines. Well, in that case... ...we will have to ask you for a decision. Colonel Weaver has a request to make. What we've done is we've set up... ...a defensive pocket, more or less thumb-shaped... ...with the river as the base. Mrs. Ter Horst speaks surprisingly good English, Colonel. Then you understand that we're in quite a strong position... ...for holding out until 30 Corps reaches us. But we have to make certain arrangements. The words come through. I don't know if I follow the military strategy. We have the main hospital, of course, but it is full to bursting. Perhaps you understand that we have great need... ...of additional space. Our house would seem suitable. It's just for the slightly wounded. You know, we'll patch them up, send them back... that sort of thing. I feel it will need a little more than that. We're wasting time. Come. - Doctor. - Thank you, Kate. I will see you. I will come back. You come in. Let's see. Please sit. Come take this chair. - Come over here with me, lads. - Thanks very much. Sit down. Let me help you. Oh, colonel, the major wants you upstairs, sir. Okay. Thank you. All right? Thank you. Still in one piece, Dodds? Good. All right, Potter? That's far enough! We can hear you from there. Rather an interesting development, sir. My general says there is no point in continuing this fighting. He is willing to discuss a surrender. Tell him to go to hell. We haven't the proper facilities to take you all prisoner! Sorry. What? We'd like to, but we can't accept your surrender. Was there anything else? All right. And now? Flatten Arnhem. - Any movement at Nijmegen? - None. No way of bLasting through to the bridge? I'd lose all my men for nothing. There's God knows how many out there already. You mean it's over? I didn't say that, did I? We've paid for that bridge, and we're going to collect. But to do it, I need tank support. You've got it, Jimmy. The Grenadier Guards will be happy to oblige. Is that all right, Alex? Absolutely. It's not just tanks. I need boats. If 30 Corps were American, we would have boats. Did you bring any? - Mike? - We might have a few about somewhere. - Can you get them here by tonight? - It won't be easy. We've got one road, ten-mile traffic jams on it... ...and Germans throwing shells at us. - I don't know quite what we can do... - Except try. You can do that, can't you? Thank you, gentlemen. Now, look here. About these boats... What is your opinion? How many? The general's a bit scratchy today, but it's nothing personal. When we dropped on Sunday... ...I think he cracked his spine. - How many boats have we got then? - About six in each truck. Where's Major Cook, soldier? - I think over there, sir. - Thank you. Julian, where the hell are you? Here, sir. We're going to take Nijmegen Bridge tonight. - What's the best way to take a bridge? - Both ends at once. I'm sending two companies across the river by boat. I need a man with very special qualities to lead. Go on, sir. He's got to be tough enough and experienced enough to do it. Plus one more thing. He's gotta be dumb enough to do it. Start getting ready. What was all that about? Well, someone's come up with a real nightmare. Come on! Keep moving! We just got word from the Dutch Resistance people at Arnhem. - And? - It's not going well for the British. Their main force never reached the bridge. Those that did are hanging on by their fingernails. - And General Urquhart? - He's got his back to the river. The Germans trapped his men in a pocket and they're squeezing it smaller. How long can he hold? Where are those goddamn boats? Just keep it clear. Right. They're no further than we thought. Julian. - Sir. - There's been a change in plans. We're gonna make the crossing in daylight. - Daylight. - Traffic's all screwed up for miles. By the time we're ready, it'll be 0800. - That's when we go. - Fine. I'd like to wait and go tomorrow night, but the British can't hold. Better by daylight. Much. - Any news of the boats? - No. We're switching... - You want some? - No, thank you. We're switching the start to 9:00 just to make sure. You start laying smoke just before we go. Fine. They're going to get creamed from the far embankment. Your smoke screen's gonna be their only protection. Don't worry. We'll cover you. Please. Okay, can I have your attention, please? I'm pleased to inform you that our 9:00 departure has been postponed till 10:00. So you can all have an extra hour's fun and relaxation. - Major? - Yes. We got any more information on those boats? We're reliably informed that they float. Outside of that, we don't know squat. Not how many, not how heavy, not how big. We are sure that the river is wide and that the current is strong. As any more cheery information comes my way, I'll be happy to pass it along. In the meantime, just think of this as on-the-job training. What's the matter? No sense of humor? Goddamn it! We go at noon. Come on. Clear those roads! You men are probably wondering why I've called us here together. I've reached a decision that I'd like to share with you all. I intend to go across like George Washington... ...standing on the prow. You guys can do the rowing. - That's it! Move 'em out! - Here we go! Get up there, guys. It's heavy. What the... What'd you expect, destroyers? Come on, put it together. Unload 'em. Easy on them, guys. - How many more? - Get those sides up. Fire! What else can you see besides smoke? Nothing yet, but they are going to try a river assault. It will fail. Of course it will fail, but... ...what do we do if it doesn't? I ask your permission to blow up the bridge. Out of the question. I understand, Field Marshal. They will not cross the river and we will blow no bridges. Have all demolition charges been checked? Yes, sir. Everything is wired and ready. Captain Krafft is standing by as ordered. The bridge will not fall into enemy hands. As soon as the first British tank starts to cross... ...I'll blow it sky-high. - Let's get going! - All right! Go, go, go! Go on. Don't wait. Go. Jump in, boys. If you don't have an oar, use your rifle butts, anything. Row! One, two. The current's taking us down. Stay to your right. - Support fire ordered, sir. - Right. Thank you. Get down! Hail Mary, full of grace. We're drifting! Pull to your left! Pull! Keep it going, boys. Keep rowing. Stay down. Come on, boys. Thy will be done. Come on. Let's go. Let's go! Snipers! Help me. Go up the side. Second platoon! - Can we make it through the tunnel? - No way, sir. Up the bank. Cover. Come on. Sergeant. Take four across, draw fire. Harry and I'll go up the side. You cover. Go, go, go! Come on. Let's go! Are you ready? Yes, General. Goddamn it. My God, they're only 18 kilometers from Arnhem. Who can stop them now? No one. Oh, hell. Any chance, Whitney? No, sir, not unless we're relieved in the next few hours. Harry? - Try and get him down to the cellar. - Very good, sir. It's working. I'm through to H.Q. Where's the colonel? - Down below. - Get him. - Colonel Frost! - What is it? Up top. It's Headquarters, sir, on the radio. Coming. Sunray on set. Pass your message. Over. What's your situation, Johnny? Over. I hadn't expected the pleasure, sir. We are holding out. We need reinforcements and above all, ammunition. Over. I'm not sure if it's a case of us coming for you... ...or you coming for us. Well, we'll just wait for 30 Corps then. That would probably be best. Very reassuring talking to you, sir. I'm sorry, Johnny, getting stuck on that bloody bridge... ...four days on your own. Have you anything else for me? No, sir. I'll give you a call when our friends arrive. Over. All right. Good luck. Out. - Sergeant Tomblin! - Here, sir. I'm coming over. Sergeant Taylor! I don't understand. Why aren't you moving? What's the matter with you guys? Those are British troops at Arnhem. They're hurt bad. You're not gonna stop, not now. I'm sorry. We have our orders. We busted our asses getting here. Half my men are killed. You're just gonna stop... ...and drink tea? We're now facing a completely different situation. We can't lead with tanks up that road. Jerry'll pick us off like sitting ducks. Our infantry is fighting in Nijmegen. When they get here, we'll move on. For Christ's sake, must you do everything by the book? Our orders are to wait for the infantry. I'm sorry, but there it is. It's Major Carlyle, sir. All right. I'm all right. Things are not so good, eh? I've been meaning to ask you something... ...and I haven't because I know you were so anxious that I should... ...and I wouldn't give you the satisfaction. Why the hell do you always carry that bloody umbrella? - Memory. - What? Bad memory. Always forgot the password. I knew no Jerry... ...would ever carry one. I had... ...to prove I was an Englishman. Get back! Back into the houses. 30 Corps, please hurry. - Nothing, sir. - All right. Thank you, Corporal. It's no use in any event. Take my boot off, will you, Wicks? Hello, 30 Corps. Oh, God! We're out of ammunition anyway. Right. Off you go, Wicks. Join the rest of the lads. Try and get back to the main force. - What about you, sir? - I'll be all right. We just didn't make it this time, did we? Calling 30 Corps. Come in, please. My general says please take it. It's very good chocolate. Your planes dropped it to us yesterday. English. Action stations! God bless Field Marshal Montgomery. Would five minutes be too much? Just five minutes respite. Dear God... ...grant these young men... ...die in peace and quiet. I'm sorry, lads, but you're going to have to move. Please. Take my hand. We're a bit late with this one, mate. ""Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler... ...and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers... ...and under His wings shalt thou trust. His truth shall be thy shield and buckler."" There you go. Head back. You'll be all right now, chum. Can it get worse? Oh, yes, much worse. Bring up the bulldozer. Stretcher bearer! Help me! Stretcher. Easy, now. Take it easy. Morphia. I must have morphia. Morphia is only for the people who are really hurt. I thought I was really hurt. Well, you're wrong. I asked him to come over, but Dr. Spaander does agree with me. - We've got to do something about them. - Yes, what? Good day, Doctor. General Urquhart, we have no more space and we have no more supplies. And since a prisoner of war... ...has more chance than no chance at all... I have a mind to ask the Germans... ...to accept our wounded into their hospitals... ...if we could arrange evacuation. - Have I your permission to try? - Certainly. If Weaver agrees. But I hardly think the Germans will. Those are our guns out there. That's 30 Corps. I don't think my permission is going to be your major problem. I've come with a message from General Urquhart. How you manage that? I swam the Rhine, sir. I'm afraid the radios are all up the spout. The general asks if you'll get your men across the river. We've been holding out for six days now. Any help at all would be of considerable assistance. You swim back with reply? Yes, sir. Well, we can't swim... ...not with equipment. We have small rubber boats, that's all. I'm afraid rubber dinghies may be a bit flimsy for the Rhine, sir. I agree. Tell the general we're coming. We're coming tonight. Yes, sir. Not possible. If you would just say yes, it would be very possible. Forgive me, but there is a battle... ...and we are in the process of winning it. Winning and losing is not our concern. Living or dying is. Cease fire... ...one more hour, two... ...just to evacuate our wounded. Afterwards you can kill us as much as you want to. General Ludwig. - Will you thank him, please? - I just did. Please, you can go. How short are we? A mile? Why don't we just try to bash through? For God's sake, it must be worth it. They're trying to force Urquhart away from the river. Now, once they do that... ...once they've got him surrounded, he'll be annihilated. Not in Monty's plan at all. Have we replaced the boats we lost at Nijmegen? Yes. Well? Well, then? Well, that's it then. We're pulling them out. It was Nijmegen. It was the single road getting to Nijmegen. No, it was after Nijmegen. And the fog... ...in England. It doesn't matter what it was. When one man says to another, ""Today let's play the war game""... ...everybody dies. ""Withdraw""? Two days, they said. We've been here nine. One bloody mile. You'd think they could accomplish that. - Hancock, here are another two. - All right. Thank you. They're the last two I could find. Charles? We've been given our marching orders. If they discover we're leaving, they'll go all out to destroy us. So we must take every precaution. I've designed this like a collapsing bag. Macdonald here has agreed to man the wireless... ...in order to give the Germans something to listen to. All the padres and medical staff have volunteered to stay behind as well. Now, the wounded who are too bad to move... ...will replace the men firing... ...so our defense will seem as before. By the time the Germans find out what's happening... ...we should all be safely across the river. - Pleasant journey. - Thank you, sir. - Are you all right, laddie? - Thank you, sir. I'm beginning to believe we're actually going to make it, sir. I thought everyone knew God was a Scotsman. Come on. Don't hang about. General Browning will be down right away, sir. He wondered if you perhaps might like to change. - Change? - Your clothes, sir. No, thanks. Hello, Roy. How are you? I'm not sure that I'll know for a while. But I'm sorry about the way it worked out. You did all you could. Yes, but did everyone else? They've got a bed for you upstairs, if you want it. I took 10,000 men into Arnhem. I've come out with less than 2,000. I don't feel much like sleeping. Quite. I've just been on to Monty. He's very proud and pleased. - Pleased? - Of course. He thinks Market Garden was 90/ successful.  But what do you think? Well, as you know, I've always thought we tried to go a bridge too far. Mind his head. Thanks, Taff. Abide with me Fast falls The eventide The darkness Deepens Lord, with me abide When other Helpers fail And comforts flee Help of the helpless O abide With me Hold Thou Thy cross Before my closing eyes Shine through the gloom, Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness. We're doomed. There'll be no escape for the princess this time. What's that? R2-D2, where are you? At last. Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what. Wait a minute. Where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. This is a consular ship. We're on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans! And bring me the passengers! I want them alive! There's one. Set for stun. She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. Hey. You're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. Come out, before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there. I'm going to regret this. - There goes another one. - Hold your fire. There's no life forms. It must have short-circuited. That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this thing is safe? Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. - You've attacked a diplomatic-- - Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan. You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. Take her away! Holding her is dangerous. If word gets out... it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate. I have traced the rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. She'll die before she'll tell you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed. Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship... and no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir. How did we get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where do you think you're going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've just about had enough of you. Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile. And don't let me catch you following me, begging for help... because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way. That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault. He tricked me into going this way... but he'll do no better. Wait. What's that? A transport. I'm saved. Over here! Hey! Hey! Help! Please help! R2? R2-D2, it is you! It is you! Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir. Droids. We stopped. Wake up. Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Will this never end? - Fine. Let's go. - Luke! Luke! Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce. Doesn't look like we have much choice, but I'll remind him. Yeah, we'll take that red one. No, not that one. I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol. Protocol? It's my primary function, sir. I am well-versed in all the customs-- - I have no need for a protocol droid. - Of course you haven't, sir. Not in an environment such as this. That's why I have been programmed-- I need a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators in most respects. very similar to your vaporators in most respects. -Can you speak Bocce? -Of course. It's like a second language. -All right. Shut up. I'll take this one. -Shutting up, sir. Take these two to the garage. I want them cleaned up before dinner. But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters. You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on. Get to it. All right. Come on. And the red one. Come on. Come on, red. Let's go. - Uncle Owen. - Yeah? This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look. Hey, what are you trying to push on us? Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain. Uncle Owen, what about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that one. - Take this away. - You'll be pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Let's go. Don't you forget this. Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity. Thank the maker. This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move. It just isn't fair. Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here. Is there anything I might do to help? No, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest... or teleport me off this rock. I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on. Well, if there's a bright centre to the universe... you're on the planet that it's farthest from. I see, sir. - You can call me Luke. - I see, Sir Luke. Just Luke. And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. This is my counterpart, R2-D2. Hello. A lot of carbon scoring here. Looks like you've seen a lot of action. With all we've been through, I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are... with the rebellion and all. You know of the rebellion against the Empire? That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir. - Have you been in many battles? - Several, I think. There's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyway. Well, my little friend... you got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a Starcruiser or-- Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? ""What is what''? He asked you a question. What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, I believe. - Our captain was-- - Is there any more to this recording? Behave yourself, R2. You're going to get us into trouble. It's all right. You can trust him. He's our new master. You're my only hope. He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts... and it's a private message for him. Frankly, I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles. But with all we've been through, this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi. I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi. I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan... but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. Sounds like she's in trouble. I better play back the whole thing. He says the restraining bolt has short-circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt... he might be able to play back the entire recording. Oh, yeah. Well... I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off. Okay. There you go. Where'd she go? Bring her back. Play back the entire message. ""What message''? The one you've just been playing. The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards. Luke! Luke! I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Here. See what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either. - That R2 unit might have been stolen. - What makes you think that? I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? I wonder if he's related to Ben. That wizard's just a crazy old man. Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't. I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. - He knew my father? - I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow. In the morning, I want them on the south ridge working on those condensers. Yes, sir. I think those new droids are gonna work out fine. In fact, I was also thinking about our agreement-- about me staying on another season. If these new droids work out, I want to apply to the academy this year. You mean the next semester before the harvest? Sure. There's more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. It's only one season more. This year we'll make enough on the harvest to hire more hands... and then you can go to the academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. - But it's a whole 'nother year. - It's only one more season. That's what you said when Biggs and Tank left. - Where are you going? - Looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to go finish cleaning those droids. Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of. - What are you doing hiding back there? - It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. - Kept babbling on about his mission. - Oh, no. That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. - Blast it. - Couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait till morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down. I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. -That droid's gonna cause me trouble. -He excels at that, sir. Come on. Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had things to do before he started today, so he left early. - Did he take those new droids with him? - I think so. He better have those units in the south range repaired by midday... or there'll be hell to pay. There's a droid on the scanner. Dead ahead. It might be our little R2 unit. Hit the accelerator. Where do you think you're going? Master Luke is your rightful owner now. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish. Don't talk to me of your mission. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go. What's wrong with him now? There are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople. Or worse. Come on. Let's go have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there, but I don't see any-- Wait a second. They're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now. Hello there. Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry. He'll be all right. Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day. You're fortunate to be all in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi? Boy, am I glad to see you. The Jundland Wastes are not to be travelled lightly. Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far? This little droid. He's searching for his former master... but I've never seen such devotion in a droid. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about? Obi-Wan Kenobi? Obi-Wan. Now, that's a name I've not heard in a long time. A long time. I think my uncle knows him. He said he was dead. He's not dead. Not yet. - You know him? - Of course I know him. He's me. I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan... since, oh, before you were born. Then the droid does belong to you. I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting. I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled... but they'll soon be back-- and in greater numbers. 3PO. Where am I? I must have taken a bad step. Can you stand? We've gotta get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly. They're on the move. My father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. - You fought in the Clone Wars? - Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best starpilot in the galaxy... and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough... but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan... on some damn-fool idealistic crusade, like your father did. Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for a while. Go ahead. - What is it? - It's your father's lightsabre. This is the weapon of a Jedi knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant weapon... for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations... the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the Empire. How did my father die? Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader... who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil... helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force? The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Let's see if we can't figure out what you are, little friend... and where you come from. - I saw part of a message-- - I seem to have found it. General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request in person. But my ship has fallen under attack... and my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion... into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've gotta get home. I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved. I've got work to do. It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it. But there's nothing I can do about it right now. - It's all such a long way from here. - That's your uncle talking. Oh, boy. My uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Learn about the Force, Luke. I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course. Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander... not to this battle station. The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate-- The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible. How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. - Fear of this battle station. - And what of the rebellion? If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station... it is possible, however unlikely... that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture... no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant... next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion... has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes... or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortress-- I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this. Vader, release him. As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress... by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke. It looks like the Sandpeople did this. There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. I've just never heard of them hitting anything this big before. They didn't, but we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side-by-side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers. These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO. And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise. But why would imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to... and that would lead them back... home. Wait, Luke. It's too dangerous. Uncle Owen. Aunt Beru. Now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location... of your hidden rebel base. There's nothing you could have done, had you been there. You'd have been killed too... and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. Mos Eisley spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. How long have you had these droids? - Three or four seasons. - They're up for sale if you want them. Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his identification. We don't need to see his identification. These aren't the droids you're looking for. These aren't the droids we're looking for. He can go about his business. - You can go about your business. - Move along. Move along. I can't abide those Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You really think we're gonna find a pilot here to take us to Alderaan? Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here. Only watch your step-- this place can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, R2. - Hey. We don't serve their kind here. - What? Your droids-- they'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you, sir. I'll have one of those. - He doesn't like you. - I'm sorry. I don't like you either. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on 12 systems. - I'll be careful then. - You'll be dead. This little one's not worth the effort. Come, let me get you something. I'm all right. Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs. I've outrun imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. - What's the cargo? - Only passengers-- myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked. Is it some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements. Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? And it's gonna cost you something extra. 10,000, all in advance. We could almost buy our own ship for that. But who's gonna fly it, kid? You? You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot. We don't have to sit here and listen-- We can pay you 2,000 now... plus 15 when we reach Alderaan. Seventeen? Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking Bay 94. Ninety-four. Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. All right. We'll check it out. 17,000. Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship, get it ready. - You'll have to sell your speeder. - That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head so large... every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. Yeah, but this time I've got the money. If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba-- Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers... who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser. Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. Over my dead body. That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I'll bet you have. Sorry about the mess. Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final checkout is completed. All systems are operational. What course shall we set? Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. - Set your course for Alderaan. - With pleasure. Lock the door, R2. Check this side of the street. The door's locked. Move on to the next one. I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. Watch your language. All right. Give it to me. I'll take it. Look at this. Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand. It'll be enough. Solo! Come out of there, Solo! Right here,Jabba. I've been waitin' for you. Have you now. You didn't think I was gonna run, did you? Han, my boy, you disappoint me. Why haven't you paid me... and why did you fry poor Greedo? Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come yourself. Don't send these twerps. Han, I can't make exceptions. What if everyone who smuggled for me... dropped their cargo at the first sign... of an imperial starship? It's not good business. Look,Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes. You think I had a choice? But I got a nice, easy charter. I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time. Han, my boy, you're the best. So, for an extra 20% -- Fifteen,Jabba. Don't push it. Okay, 15% . But if you fail me again... I'll put a price on your head so big... you won't be able to go near a civilized system. Jabba, you're a wonderful human being. Come on! If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well. What a piece of junk. She'll make .5 past light speed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board, we'll get outta here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men, load your weapons. Stop that ship. Blast them. Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel. Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our passengers are hotter than I thought. Hold 'em off. Angle the deflector shields... while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp. There's two more comin'. They're gonna try and cut us off. Why don't you outrun 'em? I thought this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, or you're gonna find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few manoeuvres. We'll lose 'em. Here's where the fun begins. How long before you can jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer. At the rate they're gaining? Travelling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy. Without precise calculations... we'd fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova... and that would end your trip real quick. - What's that flashing? - We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm gonna make the jump to light speed. We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin. I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it... signing the order to terminate your life. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Princess Leia, before your execution... I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony... that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin... the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet... that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base... I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No. Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system. I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time. Where is the rebel base? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. There. You see, Lord Vader? She can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. - What? - You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough. Commence primary ignition. Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror... and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. You can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun them. Don't everybody thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours. Now be careful, R2. He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. 'Cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2. Let the Wookiee win. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. - You mean it controls your actions? - Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a blaster at your side. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff... but I've never seen anything to make me believe... there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self... and act on instinct. With the blast shield down, I can't see. How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Stretch out with your feelings. You see? You can do it. I call it luck. In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else. We're coming up on Alderaan. I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world. Yes? Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a rebel base... but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied. She lied to us. I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion. Terminate her immediately. Stand by, Chewie. Cut in the sublight engines. What the-- We've come out in a meteor shower, some kind of asteroid collision. - It's not on any of the charts. - What's going on? Our position's correct, except no Alderaan. - Where is it? - That's what I'm trying to tell you. It ain't there. It's been blown away. - What? How? - Destroyed by the Empire. The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more firepower than I've-- - There's another ship coming in. - Maybe they know what happened. It's an imperial fighter. - It followed us. - No. It's a short-range fighter. There aren't any bases here. Where did it come from? Sure is leaving in a hurry. If they identify us, we're in trouble. Not if I can help it. Chewie, jam its transmissions. - Let it go. It's too far out of range. - Not for long. A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something. He ain't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us. He's heading for that small moon. I can get him before he gets there. He's almost in range. That's no moon. - It's a space station. - It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about this. Turn the ship around. Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse. Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? A tractor beam's pulling us in. There's gotta be something you can do. There's nothing I can do. I'm at full power. I have to shut down. They're not gonna get me without a fight. You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting. Clear Bay 327. We are opening the magnetic field. To your stations. Come with me. Close all outboard shields. Close all outboard shields. Yes? We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. Its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9. Release charge. 316, report to control. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after take-off. It must be a decoy. Several escape pods have been jettisoned. - Did you find any droids? - No, sir. If there were any, they must have jettisoned. Send a scanning crew aboard. I want every part of this ship checked. Yes, sir. I sense something... a presence I've not felt since-- Get me a scanning crew in here. I want every part of this ship checked. There's no one here. Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. Leave that to me. Damn fool. I knew you were gonna say that. Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him? The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. Let's go. Hey, down there. Could you give us a hand with this? TK-421, why aren't you at your post? TK-421, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. Between his howling and your blasting everything... it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight to sneakin' around. We've found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network. He's found the controls to the power beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already. - I want to go with you. - Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids. They must be delivered safely... or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path from mine. The Force will be with you... always. You said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. - Great at getting us into trouble. - I didn't hear you give any ideas. Anything's better than just hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up. Who do you think-- - What is it? - I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says, ""I've found her,'' and keeps repeating, ""She's here.'' Who? Who has he found? - Princess Leia. - The princess? She's here? - Princess? - Where is she? Princess? What's going on? Level 5, Detention Block AA-23. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no. We've gotta do something. - What are you talking about? - The droids belong to her. She's the one in the message. We gotta help her. Don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait here. He didn't know she was here. Find a way into that detention block. - I'm not going anywhere. - They're gonna execute her. You said you didn't want to just wait to be captured. Now you want to stay? Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. - But they're gonna kill her. - Better her than me. She's rich. Rich? Rich, powerful. If you were to rescue her, the reward would be-- - What? - Well, more well than you can imagine. I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit. - You'll get it. - I better. You will. All right, kid. You better be right about this. - All right. - What's your plan? 3PO, hand me those binders there, will you? Okay. Now, I'm gonna put these on you. Okay, Han, you put those on. Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking... but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here? - Lock the door. - And hope they don't have blasters. That isn't very reassuring. 517 to scanner control. 517 to scanner control. 316, report to control. 53 to upper bay door. 53 to upper bay door. I can't see a thing in this helmet. - This is not gonna work. - Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before. Where are you taking this... thing? Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. - Look out! He's loose! - He'll tear us all apart! Look out. We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is-- 2187. You go and get her. I'll hold them here. Everything's under control. Situation normal. What happened? Had a slight weapons malfunction... but everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here now. Thank you. - How are you? - We're sending a squad up. Negative, negative. We have a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak, very dangerous. Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke, we're gonna have company! Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper? Oh, the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. - You're who? - I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. - Where is he? - Come on. - He is here. - Obi-Wan Kenobi? - What makes you think so? - A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the Force. The Jedi are extinct. Their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes. We have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23. The princess? Put all sections on alert. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone. Get behind me. Watch your left. They went down the cell bay. - Can't get out that way. - You cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. - C-3PO. C-3PO. - Yes, sir? Are there any other ways out of the cell bay? We've been cut off. What was that? I didn't copy. I said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out. All other information on your level is restricted. Open up in there. Open up in there. Oh, no. There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever. Now what? Some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't-- - What the hell are you doing? - Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy. Get in! Get in there, you big furry oaf. I don't care what you smell. Get in there, and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl. Either I'm gonna kill her, or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there. The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered. Let's get out of here. - Get away from there. - No, wait. I already tried it! It's magnetically sealed. Put that thing away! You're gonna get us all killed! Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here. It's not gonna take 'em long to figure out what happened to us. It could be worse. It's worse. - There's something alive in here. - That's your imagination. Something just moved past my leg. Look. Did you see that? What? Kid! Luke! Grab hold of this! Blast it! My gun's jammed. - Where? - Anywhere! Help him! - What happened? - I don't know. It just let go of me and disappeared. I got a bad feeling about this. - The walls are moving! - Try and brace it with something. Help me. Wait a minute. 3PO! Come in, 3PO! 3PO! Where could he be? Take over. See to him. Look, there. They're madmen. They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me. You stand guard. Come on. All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. All right. 3PO. Come in, 3PO. 3PO. - Get on top. - I can't. Where could he be? 3PO. 3PO, will you come in. They aren't here. Something must have happened. See if they've been captured. Hurry. One thing's for sure. We're all gonna be a lot thinner. - Get on top of it. - I'm trying. Thank goodness they haven't found them. Where could they be? ""Use the comlink''? Oh, my. I forgot. I turned it off. - Are you there, sir? - 3PO? - We've had some problems. - Shut up and listen to me. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level! Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level! No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no. What? You did great, 3PO! Listen to them. They're dying, R2. Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault. My poor master. We're all right. You did great! Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number-- Where are we? 3263827. If we can avoid any more female advice, we oughta be able to get out of here. Let's get moving. Where you goin'? Wait! They'll hear! Come here, you big coward. - Chewie, come here. - Listen. I don't know who you are or where you came from... but from now on, you do as I tell you, okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person-- me. It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this. Give me regular reports, please. Right. - Do you know what's going on? - Maybe it's another drill. You seen that new VT-16? Yeah. Some of the other guys were telling me about it. They say it's quite a thing to see. What was that? It's nothing. Outgassing. Don't worry about it. - There she is. - C-3PO, do you copy? Yes, sir. - Are you safe? - For the moment. We're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought. Nice. Come on. It's them. Blast them. Get back to the ship! - Where are you going? - He certainly has courage. What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on. I think we took a wrong turn. There's no lock. - That oughta hold them for a while. - Quick. We've got to get across. -Find the controls to extend the bridge. -I think I just blasted it. They're coming through. Here, hold this. Here they come. For luck. We think they may be splitting up. They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir. Where could they be? Where could they be? Close the blast doors. Open the blast doors. Open the blast doors. I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again at last. The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the master. Only a master of evil, Darth. Your powers are weak, old man. You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down... I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. You should not have come back. Didn't we just leave this party? - What kept you? - We ran into some old friends. - The ship all right? - Seems okay, if we can get to it. I hope the old man got the tractor beam down. Look. Come on, R2. We're going. Now's our chance. Go! Come on! Come on! - Luke, it's too late! - Blast the door, kid! Run, Luke, run. I hope that old man got the tractor beam down, or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it! We're coming up on their sentry ships. Hold them off. Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns. I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet. You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp. Here they come. They're coming in too fast! - We've lost the lateral controls. - Don't worry. She'll hold together. Hear me, baby? Hold together. Got him. I got him! Great, kid. Don't get cocky. There's still two more. - That's it. We did it. - We did it. Help. I think I'm melting. This is all your fault. Are they away? They've just made the jump into hyperspace. You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I amaze even myself. That doesn't sound too hard. They let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. - You call that easy? - They're tracking us. Not this ship, sister. At least the information in R2 is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data's analysed a weakness can be found. - It's not over yet. - It is for me, sister. I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive. Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody. I care. So... what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid. Good. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. What do you think? You think a princess and a guy like me-- No. You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst. We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack. It's our only hope. - Yes. - We're approaching the planet Yavin. The rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet. The battle station is heavily shielded... and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet. Its defences are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defence. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters against that? The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter to be any threat... or they'd have a tighter defence. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia... has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. The approach will not be easy. You're required to manoeuvre straight down this trench... and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two metres wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction... which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home. They're not much bigger than two metres. Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you. Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the rebel base will be in range in 30 minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi... and will soon see the end of the rebellion. All flight crews, man your stations. So, you got your reward and you're just leaving, then? That's right. Yeah. I got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya. Come on. Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them. What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like... suicide. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Hey, Luke. May the Force be with you. What are you looking at? I know what I'm doing. All pilots to your stations. - What's wrong? - It's Han. I don't know. I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. Open main launch tubes. Main launch tubes opening, sir. Hey, Luke! - Biggs! - I don't believe it. How are ya? - Coming up? - I'll be up there with you. - Have I got stories to tell you. - Skywalker. Are you sure you can handle this ship? Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories. - You'll do all right. - Thank you, sir. I'll try. Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right? Hey, Biggs. I told you I'd make it someday. It'll be like old times, Luke. They'll never stop us. This R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up. You want a new one? Not on your life. That droid and I have been through a lot. You okay, R2? Good. Gold squadron, begin take-off procedure. Hang on tight, R2. You've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you. Standby alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, 15 minutes. - All wings report in. - Red 10 standing by. - Red Seven standing by. - Red Three standing by. - Red Six standing by. - Red Nine standing by. - Red Two standing by. - Red 11 standing by. Red Five standing by. Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through the magnetic field. Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on. Double front. Look at the size of that thing. Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. - This is it, boys. - Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. - I copy, Gold Leader. - We're starting for the target shaft. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and draw their fire. - Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees. - I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five. I'm going in. Luke, pull up! - You all right? - A little cooked, but I'm okay. We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so small they're evading our turbolasers. We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. - I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins. - Right with you, Red Three. I've got a problem here. - Eject. - I can hold it. - Pull up! - No, I'm all right-- The rebel base will be in firing range in seven minutes. Luke, trust your feelings. Squad leaders... we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way. My scope's negative. I don't see anything. - Pick up your visual scanning. - Here they come. You've got one on your tail. I'm hit! - You've picked one up. Watch it. - I can't see it. He's on me tight. I can't shake him. I'll be right there. Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me. - Fall in. Fall in. - Watch your back, Luke. Fighters above you, coming in. I'm hit, but not bad. R2, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there. Red Six, can you see Red Five? There's a heavy fire zone. Red Five, where are you? I can't shake him. I'm on him, Luke. Blast it, Biggs. Where are you? - Thanks, Wedge. - Good shooting, Wedge. Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. We're starting our attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation. The exhaust port is marked and locked in. Switch all power to front deflector screen. Switch all power to front deflector screen. How many guns do you think, Gold Five? Say about 20 guns, some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switch to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns. They've stopped. Stabilize your rear deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters. They're coming in. Three marks at 210. I'll take them myself. Cover me. Yes, sir. - It's no good. I can't manoeuvre. - Stay on target. - We're too close. - Stay on target. Loosen up! Gold Five to Red Leader, lost Tiree, lost Hutch. - I copy, Gold Leader. - They came from behind. We've analysed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by? Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances. Rebel base, three minutes and closing. Red boys, this is Red Leader. Rendezvous at mark 6. 1. - This is Red Two flying toward you. - Red Three standing by. Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run. Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run. This is it. We should be able to see it by now. Keep your eyes open for those fighters. There's too much interference. Red Five, can you see them? - No sign of any-- Wait. Coming in .35. - I see them. I'm in range. Target's coming up. Just hold them off for a few seconds. Close up formation. Almost there. -Let her loose. They're right behind me. -Almost there. I can't hold them. It's away! - It's a hit! - Negative. Negative. It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to .05. We'll cover for you. Stay there. I just lost my starboard engine. Get set up for your attack run. Rebel base, one minute and closing. Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in full throttle. That ought to keep those fighters off our back. Right with you, boss. Luke, at that speed, will you be able to pull out in time? It'll be just like Beggars Canyon back home. We'll stay back far enough to cover you. My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port. Are you sure the computer can hit it? Watch yourself. Increase speed, full throttle. What about that tower? You worry about those fighters. I'll worry about the tower. R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again. See if you can't lock it down. Fighters coming in .3. - I'm hit. I can't stay with you. - Get clear, Wedge. - You can't do any more good back there. - Sorry. Let him go. Stay on the leader. Hurry, Luke. They're coming in much faster this time. R2, try and increase the power. Hurry up, Luke. Quick. Quick. Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing. I'm on the leader. Hang on, R2. Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one. Luke, trust me. His computer's off. You switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm all right. I've lost R2. The Death Star has cleared the planet. The Death Star has cleared the planet. Rebel base in range. You may fire when ready. Commence primary ignition. I have you now. What? Look out. You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home. Stand by. Stand by. Great shot, kid! That was one in a million! Remember, the Force will be with you always. I just knew you'd come back. I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward. I knew there was more to you than money. Oh, no. Oh, my. R2, can you hear me? Say something. You can repair him, can't you? - We'll get to work on him right away. - You must repair him. Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them. He'll be all right., The political situation in the world is such as to cause grave concern and anxiety. It has now reached a stage where the very foundations of civilization are seriously threatened. War is a contagion. The peace of the world, the welfare and security of every nation, including our own, is being threatened by that very thing. Let no one imagine that America will escape. Yes, we are determined to keep out of war. Yet, we cannot insure ourselves against the disastrous effects of war, and the dangers of involvement. This is bloody ridiculous. Wasn't your empire built on ridiculous traditions? Don't defend them, Layton. You might speak their language, but they still think you're a barbarian. Be honest. You won't miss this place when you're gone? Oh, please. The next time I see the little buggers, I hope it's through the sights of a 14-inch gun. Gentlemen. On behalf of the British Empire, I wish to thank Admiral Yamamoto for this invitation. May our nations work together to maintain peace on the seas. Which is why I know that you must have an opinion. I was once our naval attache in Washington. After you went to Harvard. Like you, I thought there was value in studying a potential adversary. There's a rumor that you told the prime minister that Japan can't win a war with the United States. I said we couldn't win a long war. There's another rumor that your life is in danger. That the nationalists think you're too moderate and have targeted you for assassination. Japan is at a crossroads. We are emboldened by our invasion of China and eager to become a world power. Yet we get 80% of our oil from your country. If that supply is threatened, it will force us into drastic measures. You want me to pass this information along to Washington? Don't push us into a corner. You must give those of us who are more reasonable a chance to carry the day. Nobody wants a war. Sayonara. Sayonara. Come on. Step it up, ladies! Clear the flight deck. Let's go. Prepare to brace! Why aren't you using the flaps, sir? Because someday we might have to land with our flaps shot away. So we might as well practice now. This isn't how Ensign Hunt used to fly. Which is why Ensign Hunt is now counting seagulls in San Diego and you're here with me. Looks like we got hit in our fuel tank, too. Please don't, sir. This might save your life one day, Murray. Engine's about to die. Stand by to recover aircraft. What the hell is Best doing? He's out of the groove. It looks like his engine cut out. Is it a stunt, or is he in trouble? I don't know. But he's going to hit the first wire like always. Not with that angle. Why are we sideways? To shave speed so we don't put a hole in the deck. Better not crash that damn plane. Hey, hang in there, kid. We're almost home. Brace! Are you trying to get court marshalled? I had electrical issue. Could have happened to anyone. Hey! Good job. Well, it's not me you have to convince. McClusky's about ready to have your ass. Then I'll take it upstairs to the old man. He knows what's coming. That's why we've been flying double scouting missions this whole trip. Going somewhere? Yeah, they're sending the whole squadron into Pearl this morning. And I'll be drinking a beer on the beach with Roy by noon. And I'm not coming? No. McClusky's holding back Scouting Six. It's probably 'cause you're such an asshole. Yeah, you're lovin' this, right? Morning, sir. Aircraft is spotted. Hey, take it easy on Miller. He's having a tough morning. It's my last day of sea duty, sir. And I'm the only one from my radio class who hasn't crashed. Don't worry, Miller. I'm sure even Mr. Dickinson can fly you from here to Pearl without getting you wet. Hey. Me and Roy, we'll pour a little beer out on the beach for ya. Well, you boys are taking your sweet time. Chaplain's gonna be here any minute. It's another hot one, sir. - Are you complaining, Sully? - No, sir. I just can't help wondering why I have to set up chairs for church, even though I don't believe in God. Well, that's because your only religion is chasing tail. And the Navy ain't gonna pay you for that. Incoming! Barbara! Barbara! Barbara, come here! Come on, sweetheart. Get the wounded below deck! Everyone else, battle stations! Get down! Comin' to church? I have to go to the office. It's Sunday. You work too hard. Layton residence. I'll meet you outside. Edwin, what's happening? The Japanese are attacking us. Did you reach the office? No. The switchboard was jammed. Go. Sully, get up! Come on! We need to get to the gun directors. They're firing way too low. Take cover! Get down! Drive! Hey. Hey. Are you okay? We have to get off the ship. Come on. Hurry up, kid. We gotta jump. You go in that water, you're dead. Sully! You first, Sully! I can't! My hands... You wanna live? You get to that goddamned ship, you hear me? What is it, sir? Looks like Coastal Artillery went stark mad. I bet you somebody's gonna catch hell for it. Incoming! Miller, break radio silence. Get that gun working! Pearl is under attack. This is no shit. Miller, you okay? Miller, bail out! Miller! Miller! Miller! What the hell is going on? Pearl is shooting at our guys, sir. Then maybe it isn't Pearl. Look, call Dickinson. We had a transmission that he was under attack and then nothing. Sir. Get this to the admiral. Keep going, Sully. Get down! Oh, come on. There's the man who tried to warn us. If it's any satisfaction to you, Layton, you were right. Sir, it's no satisfaction to me whatsoever. You bastard. Sir, where are they going? Back to their carriers. Drive out to the radio direction finder and report back to me. Yes, sir. Admiral Halsey on deck. Pearl found something? Intelligence managed to get a line of bearing on the attacking fleet. But it's a bilateral reading. The Japanese are either at 343 degrees or 163 degrees. Oh, for Christ's sake. Pearl is under attack and we don't even know if the bastards are north or south? Army bombers also reported a possible ship sighting here. We're gonna place our bet right there. We have a possible location on the Jap fleet. Fly a grid on bearing 185. If you make contact, Best and his men will put down a smokescreen and then the torpedo bombers will make their runs. Lindsey has command. Eh, to hell with smoke. Let me go after those carriers with a real bomb. Torpedoes sink ships, not bombs, - and my men need a screen. - Yeah, even if you get close enough, your torpedoes don't work. - That's a rumor. - Yeah, it's a rumor, 'cause the damn things have never been tested. Look, the Japs are out there killing our friends. Let me put a 500-pound bomb right down their goddamn smokestack. We're not changing tactics just because you want revenge. Going after the Japs, sir? Yeah, we're gonna smoke 'em to death. Japanese are attacking on multiple fronts. We captured a radio log from a downed Japanese plane. They hit us with all six of their fleet carriers. At least they didn't destroy our oil tanks. The whole fleet would have had to withdraw to the West Coast. You are the best intelligence officer I've ever known, Layton. They'll probably burn you for this, too. But if they don't, swear to me, you'll make the next man in this chair listen to you. See anything, sir? Not even a goddamn whale. Six baker 10, this is six torpedo one. Lead us back to Enterprise. Six torpedo one, your pilots aren't trained for a night carrier landing with live ordnance. Go land at Pearl. We can't clear the mountains. Take us back to Enterprise, lieutenant. That's an order. Six torpedo one, I'm dropping my smoke tanks and returning to Enterprise. Follow me if you want. We got word from Pearl. The Jap fleet was north, not south. God damn it! Hey, Lindsey, this is what I was afraid of. One of your men almost blows up the damn carrier, because you were too afraid to get shot down flying into Pearl. Do I have to remind you that I am your superior officer, lieutenant? You gonna hide behind your rank? Save it for the Japs. We're at war now, McClusky. - When that guy screws up, people die! - Listen to me. You wanna keep flying? I suggest you knock off the cowboy bullshit. Come on, Murray. Jesus. What are they doing? When she went over, everyone below deck was probably trapped inside. Did you know anyone aboard Arizona? Yeah, my roommate from the Academy. Lieutenant Roy Pearce. I heard you jumped out of a perfectly good plane. Well, it was on fire. And the controls were dead. Where's Miller? Ah, hell. Yeah. Hey, Ann's by the gate. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. - Hi. - Hey. - Come home tonight. - I wish. We sail as soon as we're refueled. Look, I want you and Barb to go back to your parents' place in Jersey. - No. - It's not safe here. Everyone is saying this is gonna be a long war. - What if... - You're not shipping us off to Jersey and that's final. Did you talk to Sarah? Was Roy aboard the Arizona? Yes. We're checking all the hospitals, but nothing yet. Tell her I'll find him. Thank you. Hey. I heard you were with Lieutenant Pearce during the attack. Sully... what happened to him? I don't know. I don't know. We're doing our best. But they've been bringing body parts... in pillow cases. There's too many. He was a blond guy. Tall. Probably wearing an officer's uniform. Officers are down here. Is there anything else you can give me? Identifying features? Tattoos? Well, he would have been wearing our class ring from Annapolis. We, uh... took this off the body when he came in. I'm sorry. I'll give you a moment. December 7th, 1941... a date which will live in infamy. The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at peace with that nation... and, at the solicitation of Japan... ...was still in conversation with its government and its... Congratulations, sir. You're the right man to run the Navy. When they get in trouble, they send for the sons of bitches. The situation in the Pacific is far worse than has been reported. We have three carriers. The Japs have ten. We have zero functional battleships, they have nine. They have more cruisers, more bombers, more fighters... and much of their equipment is more modern. We'll just have to count on the men that we have out there to hold the line. I don't envy the new commander. It's me, isn't it? The president asked for you himself. He said that you should get the hell out to Pearl and stay there until our ships sail into Tokyo Bay. Welcome to the most difficult job in the world. Detail. A-ten-hut! Ready. Aim. Fire. Aim. Fire. I'll be right back. Fire. I'm so sorry. Roy wanted to be a pilot like you. But I talked him out of it. I said it was too dangerous. I'll see you at the next funeral. You don't have to go. Yes, I do. We're family. Hey, hey, hey! I just wanna say... Roy Pearce was one of the finest bastards that I've ever met. And I could talk about the man for an hour. But I think that's a job I'll leave up to one of you boys that went to the Academy with him. What do you say? Yeah, well, I can't let some torpedo jockey speak for Roy. Especially one not good enough to fly from Enterprise. - Ooh! - Okay. Okay. Summer after plebe year, me, Roy and Dickie went up to visit Roy's uncle, up in the Great Lakes. It was the peak of Prohibition, so one night, we decide to sail to Canada to buy a keg of beer. On our way back, right before the sun comes up, the wind dies. So, there we are, just floating in the middle of the lake, waiting for the Border Patrol to show up. I said we should just ditch the booze, but Roy... Hey, Dickie, what did Roy say? ""Hell, no. ""We'll drink it all."" Roy was my best man. He was the godfather to my daughter. I thought someday... we'd be on a porch, drinking beers, telling lies about what we did in the big war. To Roy. To Roy. To Roy. Man, oh, man. Why'd you make me drink so much? You might have to carry me home, darling. Oh, shit. Shore Patrol. No, that's the admiral's flag. Hey, I bet it's the new commander. Who do you think it is? That looks like Nimitz. I hear he's true-blue. Hey, Nimitz! When are you going to let us at those Japs? I'm sorry, sir. Do you want me to get their names? No. I think he might have heard you. I'm glad at least some of the boys still want to fight. Welcome to Pearl, sir. I'm Lieutenant Commander Layton. I know who you are. Well, then you'll understand my request. I wish to be reassigned to a destroyer. Didn't you try to warn my predecessor about the impending attack? Well, not exactly. I said that we had lost track of the enemy carriers and needed to be prepared. I should've pushed harder. A lesson, I assume, you have taken to heart. Sir... I'm the intelligence officer responsible for overseeing the greatest intelligence failure in American history. Close the door. Morale is at an all-time low and for good reason. The Japanese are advancing on all fronts at a terrifying pace. I, nevertheless, know the fighting spirit of our men. And I have faith in them. But I also need to know that they have faith in themselves. I need you to be my Admiral Yamamoto. Get in his head. Tell me what he's going to do next. Your first assignment... we need to throw a punch. Not just for morale, but so the Japanese know what it feels like to be hit. I'm sending Halsey to attack the Marshall Islands. But I need to know that they're not walking into a trap. The target is Roi Island. Our submarines have reported shipping traffic and one military airfield. We don't know what we're facing, so hit 'em as hard as possible and then get the hell out. So what about the enemy carrier? Intelligence says they're 2,000 miles away. You mean the same group of geniuses who didn't know the Japs were gunning for Pearl? Like I said, be prepared for anything. The early bird catches the worm, gentlemen. We're gonna hit that anchorage before the Japs have even rolled out of bed. Looks like he spit polished his shoes. Hey, guys, let's get home in one piece. Oh, don't you worry. What's the plan, sir? The other squadrons will strike first. Then we go in and clean up the remaining targets. Japs will know we're coming. What happens if we get shot down? Look, I'm not gonna end up as a POW. And neither are you. I've got a large target in my sight. Get close enough to make it count. Start your runs, boys. Engage torpedoes. Looks like our boys on Roi poked a hornet's nest. We got a problem. I got eyes on a second enemy airfield on Taroa Island. I'm counting maybe 30 bombers and heavy fighter cover. You hear that, boys? If we don't knock out that airfield, they'll go after Enterprise. And I want a place to land when this is over. Enemy fighters, 11 o'clock! We got company. Start your runs! Get those bastards off me, Murray! Let's get out of here, Murray. We got most of the bombers, but not all of them. Looks like they almost got you. Yeah, not enough lead. What, too much excitement for ya? I'm not looking to win a medal. You know, the Navy's gonna make you pay for this aircraft. How'd you boys do? We lost Hopping. He never pulled out of his dive. That can't be good. Twin-engine bombers, five o'clock. Goddamn gunners. Don't they know they gotta lead those planes? - Right standard rudder. - Brace! Brace for impact! What the hell is he doing? He's turning himself into a bomb. Come on! Come on! Damn, Bruno. Aren't they paying us to kill Japs? Admiral Halsey wants to see you. That's the bravest damn thing I think I've ever seen. What's your name, son? Bruno Gaido, sir. Aviation Machinist's Mate, Third Class. Well, Bruno, you are now an Aviation Machinist's Mate, First Class. Signal the fleet. Tell 'em it's time to haul ass with Halsey. Yes, sir. You heard the man. Signal the fleet. Are you really sure you want your wife flying wingman for you tonight? Yeah, nobody told me there'd be USO girls here tonight. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. I got us a table. Wade, have you met Ann? Wade McClusky. I fly with your husband. Hey, uh, you want a drink? I do, if you want me to dance. - Thank you. - You're welcome. How long have you been married? Long enough to know my husband's talents. Why isn't he commanding a squadron? I don't make those decisions. - Two Mai Tai, please. - Yes, sir. I understand before the war, when it was about politics, but now? I told you she was a firecracker. I have to say, I often wondered what kind of woman would marry Dick Best... and, well, you have not disappointed. Dick Best. - Hey, Layton. - Hey. How was the Marshall Islands? Yeah, we got our feet wet. You keeping tabs on me? Ah, I'm with Fleet Intelligence. Thank God. Yeah, we're gonna need someone as smart as you after Pearl. You gonna straighten those boys out? I'll do my best. Your Mai Tai, sir. Well, I'm rooting for you. - Hey, say hi to the wife. - You as well. Just be straight with me. What am I missing? Every time we go up in one of those planes, there's a chance we won't come back. Now, it's hard to follow a man who doesn't know that. Or even worse... doesn't care. Let's dance. Okay. Excuse me. Come to bed. Welcome aboard Enterprise. You're replacing good men. Much earlier than me or the Navy wanted, but... Well, that's the hand we've been dealt. Now, you're going in the rotation, and as XO, it's my job to make sure you're worth more than a bucket of warm spit. The Japs are waiting for us, so we need pilots who can hold their own. Hey. You gotta see this. What the hell are army planes doing on a carrier? Well, Mr. Browning, the commander of those bombers? Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle. Maybe the best pilot in the world. And he intends to launch his planes off the Hornet, strike Tokyo, and then land in Free China. Captain? Enemy pickets 50 miles out. They're gonna blow our cover. Every mile we get Doolittle closer to Japan, is fuel he can use to get the hell out of there. But I'm not gonna risk these carriers. What do we tell Doolittle? The truth. We got the order to launch. How far out are we? Too far. We'll probably end up ditching in the East China Sea. But if we bomb Tokyo, we'll be the first enemy in Japan's history to hit their home territory. If any of you want to bow out, now's your chance. We all wanna fly, sir. Man your planes. I'll see you all in China. They can't take off. Certainly not with a load. And they sure as hell can't land. Ten bucks says they don't make it off the deck. Yeah, I'll take that bet. Hello, everyone. This is Radio Tokyo, talking about the collapse of American forces in the Philippines. Our glorious Japanese forces have captured thousands... Evening, gents. What's going on, Captain? Those sound like air raid sirens to me. Bombs away, sir. Let's get out of here. - No. - Taking these hostage. Just half an hour. Does America winning the war really depend on Edwin Layton working himself to death? Some of our boys bombed Tokyo today. They were supposed to land in Free China. But they're probably gonna run out of fuel and have to ditch in the China Sea. If, by some miracle, they actually make it into Japanese occupied territory, they'll be tortured and executed. What can you do? Most likely nothing. But we're not gonna lose any more men because I didn't dig deep enough. I'll fix you a sandwich. I keep recalculating, but with this steady tailwind... You think we're over land? Yeah. Maybe. Only one way to find out. Everyone. We gotta bail out. I don't know if we're over Chinese or Jap territory. So, watch yourselves. I'll see you all in Quzhou. You're next, Potter. The Japanese are sending their carriers into the Coral Sea. Yes, sir. They're trying to break our lifeline with Australia. Send a secure message to Admiral Halsey. I want Enterprise to join Yorktown and Lexington in the Coral Sea. And tell Halsey time is a factor. There's something else. There always is. I heard a theory. What kind of theory? According to one of my officers, Coral Sea is just a warm-up. He thinks that the Japanese are planning something bigger. Much bigger. What makes him think that? Little bits and pieces that we've intercepted. A message about a battleship not being ready for an upcoming operation. Request for maps of the Aleutian Islands. What's the target? We don't know yet. Do you trust this officer? He's the most brilliant man I know. Well, have him figure it out. Always no match. Keep it. Thank you. There are no installations here. What's their target? People are target. People. People. And we just made it worse. 24 hours too late. Damn it. Why couldn't we have been here? This leaves us and Hornet as the only carriers in the Pacific. Attention on deck. I wanna talk to McClusky and Best. As you were. Oh, for Christ's sake. You okay, Admiral? I got this damn rash. Listen up. I'm done playing politics. The Navy... hell, the whole damn country is counting on us. And I need my best men in the right spots. So, McClusky, you are now in charge of the air group. I don't have a lick of confidence in those damn torpedoes. So, I want you in a dive bomber. And, Best, I'm bumping you up from XO. You're the new skipper of Bombing Six. Good luck, boys. Well, I guess you're gonna have to learn to fly an SBD. I've logged plenty of hours in the Dauntless. Not diving at a live target. Can't be that hard. I mean, you do it. So, I just got off the phone with Washington, and their intelligence guys think you're wrong about this big operation. They think that the Japs are sending their carriers back into the Coral Sea. Yeah, and they've ordered me to keep Enterprise down there. That's a mistake. Washington is starting from a faulty assumption and looking for evidence to corroborate it. So, what's the Japs' real target? We believe it's Midway. They see our base there as a step towards Hawaii and eventually the West Coast. When? In a few weeks. I think it's time to pay a visit to your friends in Station HYPO. Matt, bring the car around. I have to warn you, sir, codebreakers are a rare breed. Rochefort's way of doing things is especially... particular. I don't care if he consults coffee grounds while doing the boogie-woogie as long as the intel is good. Attention on deck. Carry on, gentlemen. Where's Rochefort? If you'll follow me, sir. Didn't realize that the Navy had so many trained codebreakers. We don't. Most of these men were in the band on the California. But since we don't have much use for bands these days, Rochefort thought that their musical abilities might make them naturals at breaking the rhythms of ciphers. Sorry, Admiral, it, uh, gets cold down here in the dungeon. I'm told you're brilliant. Well, Lieutenant Commander Layton has been known to exaggerate. I hope not. He told me he's absolutely certain the Japs are gonna hit Midway and I need to know whether or not I can believe him. Well, if you don't believe him, we'll all be speaking Japanese. Or, most likely, we'll be dead. Show me how this works. You mean, like a tour? Exactly. Like a tour. So, this is where it starts. We intercept roughly 60% of secure Japanese radio traffic and we've cracked enough of their code to be able to break about 40% of those messages. So, we're able to read about a quarter of their secure communications? Uh, no, not exactly. Here's some of our, uh, cracked messages. It's gibberish to me. Yes, but if you read enough of it... Rochefort has a gift for assembling the fragments. He can recall a message from two months ago, and plug it into today's intercept. Explain the disagreement with Washington. Well, we all have access to the same raw information, but, uh, over here, is where our paths diverge. Translation and analysis. Now, Washington agrees with us that Japs are gonna attack a major target codenamed AF. But Washington believes that AF is located in the South Pacific, which is why they ordered you to keep Enterprise down there. Do you have any direct proof that they're wrong? Direct proof? No, but... Sir. Imagine that you're throwing a wedding. And maybe I've never seen the invitation, but I hear from the caterers that they have an event on a certain date. The flower guy is buying up all the roses on the island. The best band is booked. That's what signal intelligence can give you. Clues. Not a definitive answer. Sir? After Pearl, you told me to stick to my guns. I swear to you, Joe's right about this. I'm not generally predisposed to trust a bunch of tuba players led by a man wearing fuzzy slippers. But... I'll figure a way to get the Enterprise back here. Meantime, you gentlemen need to convince Washington that the Japs' real target is Midway. How, sir? Washington doesn't exactly have a habit of listening to us. Well, I'm sure you'll think of something. Come in. An eyes-only message from Pearl. Nimitz. He wants us to be spotted. Because if the Japs see us, we can break our standing orders with Washington and return to Pearl. We never received this message. Sir? The admiral needs you. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, keep me informed. That was Washington. They've intercepted several Japanese messages claiming that the target of their upcoming attack is out of fresh water. Interesting, sir. I heard that Midway accidentally sent out an unencrypted transmission that their water plant was broken. And is their water plant broken? Not that I know of, sir. But that proves Midway is AF. Okay, tell your man, Rochefort that everyone now agrees on where his wedding is gonna be held. We just need to know how many guests are coming and when they plan to arrive. Mack, I think we found the spot. Can't say, Mr. Ford, that I've ever helped a big-time Hollywood director scout for a movie before. What kind of film you planning to make in a godforsaken place like this? Friend of mine in the Navy said that I might be able to find some real action here. I think I've been hoodwinked. I don't know, sir. From the way we've been fortifying this little island, I'd say your friend has some good intel. Attention on deck. Very funny. Sit the hell down. I'm gonna keep this short. I know some of you thought I was a pain in the ass as XO... Well, that's about to get worse. We're headed back to Pearl to resupply, and it's probably because something big is coming down the pipe. I'm therefore doubling our scouting flights and I expect you to practice diving runs whenever you get a chance. Don't be the man who lets down the squadron when we finally face the Japs. Dismissed. Can I talk to you, sir? I don't know if I can do this, sir. I thought I was a good pilot, but I've lost my confidence. Why did you become a pilot? Your dad wanted you to be an officer, huh? Actually, my dad didn't have much respect for officers. Said that most of them didn't know their ass from their elbow. You know, my dad was a tough son of a bitch. You know how I got his respect? By always staying in the fight. I wish I had the luxury of worrying about your confidence, but we're short on pilots, so, you gotta suck it up. Yes, sir. Wait. From now on, you're my wingman. I'll be lookin' out for you. Now go suit up for a scouting flight. Tell me. What's your secret? My secret? He wants to know why nothing bothers you. My uncle was a welder on the Empire State Building. He'd walk on a beam, 1,000 feet up in the sky, no ropes, nothing. And everyone thought he was crazy, but to him, he was just doing a job. And one Sunday, he's walking home from church. He's a block away from his house, when a cab jumps over the curb, splatters him like a bug. You never know what's gonna get you. So, why worry about it? Hey. Let's go. Simple scouting mission. On the way home, we'll practice the dive, you got it? Yes, sir. We'll be going deeper this time, so don't pull up too fast on the bottom or you'll black out. Oh, shit. The ship's moving too slow. Abort! Abort takeoff! The ship's too slow! We're not generating enough wind for launch. No, stop! Stop! Plane in water. Plane in water. Turn starboard, God damn it! Turn starboard. Guess you don't like the chokers either. I'd get grease on that thing just trying to button it up. Makes me look like a damn waiter. Nobody would ever confuse you for a waiter. You look like hell, Bill. I'm fine. Tired. Every man on the ship's tired. We've been out six months without a break. There's a big difference between tired and whatever the hell you are. You're going ashore to the hospital. Does this look like a battle wound to you? It's a damn rash. Now, what are my men gonna think when their admiral up and decides he needs a vacation? It's a direct order, Bill. And we keep losing men. It's not even the Japs. Herman crashed on takeoff. Tom Durkin disappeared on patrol. And there's this other kid... Willie West. He didn't think he could cut it. I figured it was just the usual jitters. I take him under my wing. I wrote a letter to his mother yesterday telling her I failed him. It's not your fault. He was right to be scared. Everybody knows something big is coming. We're talking about a couple dozen planes against the whole Japanese fleet. And if we lose, they own the Pacific, and they raid the West Coast. Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles... will burn. And this damn war will last a decade. I've never seen you this worried before. I never had to worry when it was just me and my plane... but, Ann, it's different now. I have to lead these men. What do I say to them? Just... be honest. And let them see what I can see. They'll follow you anywhere, Dick Best. Sir, the Yorktown was hit by a 500-pound bomb. We need at least two weeks for repairs. Not acceptable. Our initial estimate was three months in dry dock in Seattle. I need this ship. I don't care if you need to patch the deck with plywood. Yorktown sails in 72 hours. Halsey is out. He's in the hospital with shingles. So I've given command of Task Force 16 to Admiral Spruance. We're setting a trap. Our carriers will lie in wait northeast of Midway. Now, we have set up a picket line of submarines here. As for Midway itself, we have crammed every plane we can spare onto that runway. But this time, if we're lucky, surprise will be on our side. Layton, how reliable are these estimates of the Japanese positions? They represent our best guess, based on the intelligence that we have. I can't plan around your guess. I understand that we're asking the impossible, but we need you to be specific. The Japanese will attack on the morning of June 4th from the northwest, at a bearing of 325 degrees. They will be sighted 175 miles from Midway at 0700 local time. I trust Layton and his team. Make your plans accordingly. Dismissed. Clear the deck. Torpedo Squadron Six coming in from Pearl. Clear the deck. Torpedo Squadron Six coming in from Pearl. He's in trouble. Shit. We need a rescue team! - Easy. Easy. Easy. - Easy, boys. Easy. Get him over. Hand him off. One, two, three. Easy, Lieutenant. How's your back doing, Lieutenant? It feels like someone dropped a tractor on it. So, that's what your squadrons are up against? Four carriers. Approximately 250 aircraft, plus the biggest battleship in the world. Yeah, not to mention the Japs are unbeatable. We've got the drop on the bastards. Make it count. How's Lindsey? Not good, sir. Do you trust the intelligence? I'm trying. Because we're betting a hell of a lot on this hand. Yeah. I can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh... I liked you better when you were cocky. Hey, you don't have to worry about me. Oh, really? You've been blaming yourself for that kid who went down. How do I make it right? Make sure your men are ready for tomorrow. And you bring back as many of 'em as you can. Ship sighted. It's the Yorktown! How the hell did she get out of dry dock in time? I don't know. I guess every battle needs a miracle. Whoo! You've memorized every position on that board, Layton. Go home. I think I'm going to spend the night here, sir, just in case anything comes up. Your wife doesn't mind? Well, she knows the drill. My wife knows the drill, too, but she still minds. And when the war's over, I plan on spending the rest of my life making it up to her. Get some rest. Good night. They've scrambled all the squadrons. Radar must've picked up something. That's great, Mikey, that's great. Next time, get the horn up a little higher, all right? - All right, sir. - A little higher. Good. All right. Lower the flag, we're going again. Get something in your stomachs. It's gonna be a long day. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, boys. Nobody thinks we can go toe-to-toe with the Japanese. Not in a fair fight. Today, we're gonna be big underdogs. Me? I think the men in this room can fly with anyone. Maybe that's 'cause I'm a cocky son of a bitch. But it's also because I've seen what you can do. You're ready for this. We're gonna give 'em a shellackin'. They're coming! The Japs are coming! Mr. Ford, we have incoming aircrafts. We need to get you to a bunker. Incoming aircrafts? Sir, you have to take cover, sir. Holy shit! To the roof! Mr. Ford, wait! With all due respect, sir, there isn't going to be a movie, sir, if we don't get you to cover. I'm gonna shoot the damn picture. Got it, Jackie? Beautiful! Are you okay? Keep shooting. Keep shooting! Japanese air attack reported on Midway. And one of our scout planes just sighted the enemy fleet. Spotted where? He reports carriers bearing 320 degrees, 180 miles northwest of Midway. Well, Layton, you and Rochefort were only off five minutes, five miles and five degrees. Well, we'll endeavor to do better next time, sir. Give our pilots the enemy position. Tell them to attack. Yes, sir. Hey, Lindsey, you still owe me 10 bucks. You trying to collect before I get myself shot down? Nah, I know you're good for it, Lindsey. You don't have to fly today. Nobody would doubt your courage. I will lead my squadron in. Good luck, sir. I'll be right behind you. I'll meet you at the Japanese fleet. They got a Jintsu type cruiser. Range 2,500 yards. I'm not wasting a torpedo on a cruiser. Where are the carriers? Sir, we need to go deep. Man battle stations. Battle stations. Everybody, in your bunks. Well, Murray, this is it. The Enterprise has launched its SBDs and their squadrons of marine dive bombers following a new sighting report out of Midway. We gotta climb higher, boys. We need to conserve fuel. Approaching altitude 14,000 feet. Release your oxygen, sir. Are you okay, sir? It's my oxygen. Must've gotten a bad mix. We have to go back. It'll tear up your lungs. I'm not sending the squadron out there without their commander. There she is. We got a carrier, maybe 4,000 yards. Sir, the Japs are right on us. Make tubes one and two ready. Make tubes one and two ready in all respects. Make tubes one and two ready in all respects. Tubes one and two ready, aye. Flood down tube one. Flood down tube one, aye. Bearing. Mark. - Matched. - Tube one. Fire! Six Baker 10, do you have visual? Nothin'. Must've gotten a bum sighting report. Or maybe they've changed course. Let's do a back search. Here they come again. Target spotted. The screws are fading. I think they're leaving, sir. Take us to periscope depth. Enemy destroyer's headed back to her fleet. I've got a ship. Jap destroyer at flank speed. What do you wanna bet she's trying to catch up with the carriers? Sir, we've been up here for almost two hours. What if we run out of fuel and the whole squadron has to ditch? Then I'll probably end up scrubbing potatoes at Leavenworth. To hell with it. Follow me, boys. I hope you're right, McClusky. Bombing Six on me. Think they've seen us? When they see us, we'll know. Brace for impact! God damn it. That magnificent son of a bitch actually found them. All right, boys. Bombing Six, we've got the first bastard in line. Mr. Best, watch out! What the hell? McClusky was supposed to go for the far carrier. Stay on me. At 4,000. Do it, baby, come on! Come on! Come on, Dickinson, do what you're paid to do. Whoo! Yeah! Feeling a little lonely, sir? Wish we'd brought more planes to the party. You always wanted to be a hero, Kroeger. Now's your chance. Okay, Murray. We put that carrier out of action even if we have to crash on her deck. That was a beauty, sir! Right on her deck! Any fighters on our tail? No, sir. They must be chasing someone else. We're going in! O'Flaherty and Gaido are down, sir. If you don't hit them damn Zeros, we're gonna be joining 'em. Are you okay, sir? Radio our position. We gotta get a ship out here to pick up Gaido and O'Flaherty. Do you want us to contact Admiral Spruance? No, he can't break radio silence. For me? Rochefort intercepted a Japanese signal. He can't translate the body, but look at the call sign. That's from Admiral Nagumo. But he's not transmitting from the Akagi. He's transmitting from a cruiser. Now, why the hell would Nagumo leave his flagship? They taught us about dehydration in flight school. Your skin starts to crack, liver fails... Knock it off. What if nobody finds us? We swim back to Pearl. Good luck with sharks. We'll need something to eat. Wait. Wait, I see something. Looks like a destroyer. American or Jap? You, tell us your ship, or we throw you overboard. Cigarette? You know, I had a lot of friends at Pearl Harbor. So how about you go fuck yourself? Murray, get something to eat. I bet we're going back out there. We have to go upstairs to report. Hey, what happened? I got strafed by a Zero. Hey, how'd you know to follow that Jap destroyer? I played a hunch. Well, your hunch might have won us this battle. But I gotta tell ya, that looked like some cowboy bullshit to me. Well, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Yorktown's hit. What have we got left? Couple of SBDs just returned. The pilots are coming up to report. What's the news from the enemy fleet? Three carriers down. One to go. And our air group? Only three torpedo bombers came back, and they're all shot up. What about the dive bombers? We can probably scrounge up a dozen. McClusky, you've been shot. - I can fly, sir. - The hell you can. Get your ass down to sick bay. Put the pilots you trust in any plane that can fly. Yes, sir. You okay, sir? I'm fine. Has anybody heard from Dickinson? No. Not yet. Look, I know you boys have just been through hell. But we gotta go back and hit the last carrier. I'll see if I can find more men. Hey. Strap up. We're going back out. I'm sorry, sir, but I think you need to find somebody else. You don't know what it's like to be in the back seat, sir. You fly like you don't care if we come home. I wanna go home, too. I wanna spend more than a few days at a time with my wife. See my little girl grow up. And you're right. If we go out there, we probably aren't coming back. But this is our job, and we're the guys who have to hold the fort till the cavalry arrives. Look, if you really can't fly, I'll find someone else. But you should get back in that plane. You'll remember this moment for the rest of your life. And if you know that you came through when people were counting on you, you'll be able to face anything. We've come this far, Murray. Don't make me go back out there without you. I'll warm her up, sir. Get ready, Murray. We're not sneaking up on them this time. Here they come! Altitude. We've got Zeroes on our tail. This is for Pearl. You're gonna be okay. Thanks, boys. What happened to you? I ran out of fuel about 20 miles out. Ditched next to the Phelps. Where's Best? That's one of his wingmen. He hasn't come back yet. He's probably just taking a victory lap. Yeah. Hey. Men like Dick Best are the reason we're gonna win this war. Come on, Best. Any news? The kids are out back. Go, go. Hi. Cindy heard a rumor from the base. There's a big battle and one of our carriers is sinking. And the pilots? It sounds like we lost a lot of them. I am gonna go powder my nose quickly. The Japanese might charge with their battleships. So we will withdraw for the night. But their fleet might be out of range in the morning. Nimitz ordered us to be judicious. We won a great victory today. Let's not blow it. God damn it! Dick Best! Hang in there, kid. We're almost home. I thought you were dead. Yeah. They said the same thing about you. I'm glad they were wrong. Admiral's orders. Give it to Murray. He earned it. Give me your hand. You okay? Yeah. Corpsman! I need a corpsman! I got you. Here we go. What happened to Bruno? PBY flew over his last known position. They spotted an empty life raft. The Japanese are retreating. - We won. - Yeah. God bless those boys. Turns out all they needed was a fair fight. Half our men, dead or missing. Yeah. Hey, whatever happened to that whiskey? I was waiting for you to sneak out of sick bay. We did it. Hang on, boys. - Thanks. - Of course. Hey, Layton. Hell of a job. You boys really came through for us. There's Daddy! Come on, baby. - Hey! - Daddy! Daddy! Hey, sweetie. Oh, thank God. What happened? Apparently, I inhaled caustic soda. What does that mean? My lungs are shot. The Navy's never gonna let me fly again. Well, get good at something else. You have the rest of your life to figure it out. Oh. Subtitles by explosiveskull www.OpenSubtitles.org, ''Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome ''Fremde, tranger, stranger.

Well, look, you can use my room for that. See? Practically a suite. Come on in. You'll adore these. Prairie oysters, darling. lt's an egg with Worcestershire sauce, all sort of whooshed up together.

He's a divine playboy, hurtling from party to party... ...seducing everyone in all directions. You mustn't believe from Sally. l'm a most serious man of business. Making import-export with machineries. Listen, Fritz is crazy to improve his English... ...so he can dazzle fat American divorcees. And l said you might deign to give him lessons. Darling, give me one of those cigarettes. One moment. Oh, you've got to try one of these. They're absolutely devastating. l'm sure they're filled with opium, or some such thing. They make me feel wildly sensual. Till later. She's hot stuff, yes? No, thank you. Oh, you're not mistaking me. We do not sleep on each other. That is correct? ''On?'' ''With.'' ''With.'' Linken Lieselotte... ...72 kilos. Her father, you know, is a big ambassador from Washington. An ambassador? Oh, yes, dear chap. And soon, with her, l think, l am entering the high diplomatic circles. Strict rules will be obeyed. Sally tells me, sir, that you're from Oxford University. A professor of language. Well, it's, it's Cambridge, actually, and l'm... ...l'm still working for my doctor of philosophy. That's why l'm here. But, if you really want lessons, l'd be pleased to help. Excellent. Start! For the sport! lf it's not...if it's not too expensive. You know, business is... ...business is terrible. The inflation, the Communists... ...the Nazis. Soon l am with a tin cup, too... ...or l make a rich marriage. That at least is sensible. l suppose you're wondering what l'm doing... ...working in a place like the Kit Kat Klub? lt is a rather unusual place. That's me, darling... unusual places, unusual love affairs. l am a most strange and extraordinary person. Now, tell me all about you. l want to hear everything. Everything? Absolutely everything. Well, there's nothing very dramatic to tell. Well, since l've been down from Cambridge, l-- Lya de Putti. Absolutely my favorite screen siren. Well, when l left Cambridge, l-- l'm going to be a great film star. That is, if booze and sex don't get me first. Do l shock you, darling? Not a bit. l don't? Since mother died we're even closer. He's an ambassador, l understand. Who told you that? Fritz Wendel. Oh, Fritz. He's practically an ambassador. Where is he now? Oh, who knows? Timbuctoo, outer Mongolia. He dashes all over the globe on momentous affairs of state. Then, you don't see much of him. Darling, what are you talking about? Of course l do. He can't bear us being apart. He's always swooping down and carrying me off for divine vacations. The Riviera, Capri. Have you ever slept with a dwarf? Once, but it wasn't a lasting relationship. Oh, l know l can sing, but what l really want to be is an actress. Like...who is it? Lya de Putti? Oh, darling, come on. l could act her right off the screen. l thought you said she was your favorite. She makes too many faces. No, please.... We made an agreement. Thank you. Just you wait. One of these days Max Reinhardt is gonna drift into the club. Well, you never know. That's right, you never know. lt has happened before. What, just last week, a man who's a very good friend... ...of the head of casting for UFA asked me to sit at his table, and he's.... Come on. Come on. Run, run! Where? Excuse me, miss.... Didn't you just scream? Does my company upset you that much? You know, sometimes l come down here and just wait. l mean, just especially. You should try it sometime. Me? Yes. Me? -You. -No. Yes, you. Go on. l couldn't possibly. Don't be so British. You'll feel terrific afterwards. You know you want to. No, l don't. Here comes one now. -Will you do it? -All right. No, not yet. Okay, you ready? Now. l can't promise you anything, but we can give it a try. Darling, l want you to meet Herr Ludwig. He's just back from Hamburg. He lives in the room off the kitchen, and he's a marvelous publisher. Now look, he's got this book, and it's got to be translated. And l told him what a famous writer you are... ...and it's 50 marks. Right? Fabulous. lt's all settled. lt will be an honor for me to associate with... ...so talented a young man of letters as Miss Bowles tells me. This book, l assure you, is most artistic... ...most artistic and color-- Twenty-five marks in advance. Right? l think, Herr Roberts, you will find the style-- ls there any hot water left? -Hot water? -Yes, a little. l think you will find the style admirable... ...and the subject matter, l feel, is universal. -Cigar? -No, thank you. No, you must. lt's the finest Havana. lt's a deal? Herr Ludwig, l'm afraid that Sally's rather overestimated my powers of.... lt's a deal. That's it. Fifty marks. Not bad, huh? Do you know what this artistic and colorful book's about? No. Tell, tell. lt's pure pornography. But of course it is, darling. All of Herr Ludwig's books are dirty books. What's this one called? ''Cleo, the Whip Lady.'' You lied about the hot water. l'm freezing. l'm freezing to death. Hug me? Tighter. Don't be so literal. Doesn't my body drive you wild with desire? Doesn't it? lt's a very nice body. Do you really think so, darling? lt does have a certain kind of style. l mean, look, it's very flat here... ...not much hips, and... ...here.... lt's a little early in the day for this sort of thing, isn't it? Maybe you just don't sleep with girls. You don't. Well, listen, we're practically living together, so if you only like boys... ...l mean, l wouldn't dream of pestering you. Well, do you sleep with girls, or don't you? You don't ask questions like that. l do. All right. lf you insist. l do not sleep with girls. Let me be absolutely accurate. l've gone through the motions of sleeping with girls exactly... ...three times. All of them disastrous. The word for my sex life now is... ...''nil,'' or... ...as you Americans would say... ...''plenty of nuttin'''! All right? Why didn't you tell me in the first place? Look, Brian. You're absolutely my best friend. And friends are much harder to find than lovers. Besides, sex always screws up a friendship, anyway, if you let it. So we won't let it. Okay, Sally. ''You would have been, he would have been....'' Pluperfect tense. ''l have been....'' lf you did a little homework, instead of gadding about all over town.... Fraulein Schneider, there's a new pupil coming at 3:00. -Would you show her up, please? -Certainly. ''You had have been, l had have been....'' Future perfect. ''l shall have....'' ''l shall have been.'' This English. l go now to try to pull a deal. Or l make business soon... ...or l go as a gigolo. ''Either, or.'' ''Either, or,'' l go as a gigolo. Anyway, who is the new pupil? Natalia Landauer. Landauer? Of the big department store? A Landauer? How did you meet a Landauer? l had a letter of introduction from England. They invited me for coffee. lnvited you for coffee? Landauers are enormous rich Jews. Stinking rich, it seems. Good. l shall make a pass after her. What if she's...fat and hideous? Perhaps the father will take a liking from me and give me a job. lf l marry her, a partnership perhaps. l'm not prejudiced. Hello. You said you wouldn't be back until 4:00. l must have a drink this instant. The new pupil's due at any moment. Can't the drink wait? Oh, God, only gin. Sally, please! Three marks an hour. l need it. -We need it. -All l need is a drink! She's young and very strictly brought up. Look, l may have my tiny faults... ...but l'm really not planning to white slave her to Latin America. Whose room is this, anyhow? Sally, in all fairness-- Fairness? Who cares about fairness? Honestly. Thank you. You're welcome. -Excuse me. -How fat? How fat? l think the weather will be fine, isn't it true, Miss Landauer? Fraulein Landauer. Come in. -Good afternoon, Fraulein Landauer. -Good afternoon. -How nice to see you again. -lt's nice to see you again. lt is good, you have others. So, we shall make a party for speaking English, yes? Well, actually, my friends were just leaving. No, l'm delighted to stay, Brian. Sally, you have this appointment, don't you? l'll cancel it. l love parties. Good, this is splendid for the practicing. You will introduce me, please. Yes, of course. Herr Wendel, Fraulein Landauer. -lt is a pleasure, miss. -No, no, English conversation. l am so charmed, dearest miss. And...and this... ...this is Miss Sally Bowles. How do you do? Bobby, a Landauer in my house. Last summer when l.... You are all healthy, l hope. l have had a cold, but it is better now. Good. How sad. A cold from the nose is most aggravating. This was a cold of the bosom, not of the nose. All the plegm vas here. All the what? Ze plegm...zat comes in the tubes. l think l'm gonna be sick. Phlegm. ''Ph'' is always pronounced as ''f'', and... ...you don't sound...the ''g.'' Then why are they putting the ''g'', please? That's a very good question, but... ...it's rather difficult to explain. Try, Brian. lt's just there. So, Mr. Professor, you do not know? No. Then l'm sorry, l cannot help you. lt's most amusing. Very amusing. Come in. How thoughtful of you, Fraulein Schneider. Thank you very much. You're most welcome, Herr Roberts. Please. Please, you must take a cake, dearest miss. l'm not eating between meals. You're not eating between meals. l am eating between meals. Thank you. So much. You're welcome. Brian, Liebling, did l tell you? l saw a film the other day about syphilis. lt was too awful. l couldn't let a man touch me for a week. Coffee? ls it true you can get it from kissing? Oh, yes. And your king, Henry Vlll... ...caught it from letting Cardinal Wolsey whisper in his ear. That is not, l think, founded in fact. But from kissing, most decidedly. And from towels...and from cups. And, of course, screwing. ''Screwing,'' please? Fornication. Fornication? Brian, darling, what is the German word? l don't remember. -Oh, yes.... -Oh, no. Bumsen. lt would be the one German word you pronounce perfectly. Well, l ought to. l spent the entire afternoon bumsening... ...like mad with some ghastly old producer... ...who promised to give me a contract. Gin, Miss Landauer? Fritz is overdoing it a bit, isn't he? Natalia's very rich. Fritz is very broke. That old heel-clicking, hand-kissing routine of his... ...isn't going to get him anywhere with her. The only thing to do with virgins is to make a ferocious pounce. l can't imagine anyone pouncing on Natalia. That's why it would be so effective, darling. You are a woman of many sexual experiences, l think. l'll say, darling. Ever since l was so high, men have found me irresistible. -Daddy was always worrying that.... -Yes? You know. How's the gigolo campaign going? Terrible. This week, already l'm giving up three dinner invitations... ...to spend 32 marks on her. That's quite a sacrifice. And here is the craziness. l like it. Goddammit! What? l think l'm falling in love with her. l'm so sorry. So am l. You assure me the English reader will find this... ...arousing...stimulating? Well, l.... Yes, l...l should think so. Look, everybody. Positively a nun's hands, aren't they? -You look lovely, Sally. -Just lovely. Thank you. Well, l'm off to the Adlon... ...to see my sexy... ...marvelous, devastating father. -Auf wiedersehen, my darlings. -Auf wiedersehen. Good luck. l'm terribly sorry, but l couldn't possibly find any more of them. Good night, and thank you so much for a delightful evening. You're most welcome, Herr Roberts. -Good night. -Good night. lt really has been...sublime. Thank you. Dearest miss. You see how she is with me? You see that kiss? You see that kiss? No, l...l was too discreet to look back. l think l go... l go crazy with the frustration. You know, l...l kiss and inside me comes the explosion. But her? Brian, l tell you a simple fact... -...and l'm not boosting. -''Boasting.'' The French women, the Swedish women, even the English... ...they go wild for my kisses, but... ...this one.... Nothing? Nothing. And l'm a crazy, love-sick fool. Sally says you ought to pounce. Pounce? Throw her on a couch or something. To attack Natalia? lmpossible. Well, Sally is rather knowledgeable in these areas. You do what Sally says and you end up, l think, in the prison cell. -Pounce, huh? -Pounce. How'd it go? Bad? Sally, what is it? l waited at the Adlon till 10:00. When l got back, there was this. ''Dear Sally: ''Sorry, schedule revised at last minute. ''Writing. Love.'' Well, these...these things do happen. l'm sure he had a good reason. Ten words. Exactly. After ten it's extra. You see, Daddy thinks of these things. lf l had leprosy, there'd be a cable. ''Gee, kid, tough. ''Sincerely hope...nose doesn't fall off. ''Love.'' Bastard! l'll show him! l'll become a big film star. The poor man, he tries to love me. Perhaps he even thinks he does... ...but the real truth... ...is that he just doesn't care. Maybe he's right. Maybe l'm not worth caring about. Maybe l am...just nothing. Nothing. You're a perfectly marvelous girl. -And beautiful. -No. -And talented. -No, l'm not. Yes, you are. Do you really think so? l mean really? Yes, l do. Thank you. ''Maybe this time, l'll be lucky ''Maybe this time, he'll stay.'' Obviously those three girls... ...were just the wrong three girls. ''Maybe this time, for the first time ''Love won't hurry away.'' Doesn't my body drive you wild with desire? ''He will hold me fast ''l'll be home at last ''Not a loser anymore ''Like the last time And the time before. ''Everybody loves a winner ''So nobody loves me. ''Lady peaceful, Lady happy ''That's what l long to be. ''Well, all the odds are They're in my favor ''Something's bound to begin. ''lt's gotta happen, Happen sometime ''Maybe this time, l'll win. ''Cause everybody, they love a winner ''So nobody loves me. ''Lady peaceful, Lady happy ''That's what l long to be. ''Well, all the odds are They're in my favor ''Something's bound to begin. ''lt's gotta happen, Happen sometime ''Maybe this time ''Maybe this time, l'll win.'' Hey, what's going on? Tell him your lover is a gangster from Chicago. -You told him? -l did better than that. l just told him that l had the teeniest touch of syphilis. Wait till he gets a load of what little old Elke's got. -Landauer? -Ja. l am grateful to you that you came to me from my call. Don't be silly. l'm all agog. Thank you. -You will eat food, please? -Thank you. -You see, Fraulein.... -Sally. Our acquaintance is not long, but l am choosing you... ...because l know no other young woman... ...who is giving her body frequently to men. My English. l am rending you an embarrassment? No, no, l'm fascinated. Fritz Wendel has declared love for me. At first l not taking this seriously. He is so... ...so formal. And also l think so much... ...the gigolo who hunts for the fortune. ls that what you say? That's what we say, all right. Then... ...the night before yesterday... ...my parents are from the house... ...und we are seated here... ...upon my father's library sofa. Suddenly... ...he throws aside the formalities... -...there is fire, there is passion. -Oh, my God... -...he pounced! -Please? He made love to you. On my father's library sofa. Und even for that he is showing no respect. l am fighting, l'm calling out harsh words... ...but then.... May we not be frank? Suddenly... ...all is...equal fire... ...equal passion in me. And since then, l think only of him. Now, is this love... ...or mere fatuation of the body? You with so many, as you call, ''screwings''... ...shall please tell me the truth of it. Please. Does it really matter, as long as you're having fun? How can you speak of ''fun''? He has asked me to marry him. Well, that's wonderful. Why don't you? And say to my father that l am marrying a man who is perhaps a fortune hunter? And a Christian, too. Oh, this l think is...breaking his heart. Well, in that case then, l guess you better just forget the whole thing. Forget Fritz? How am l ever forgetting Fritz? Look, l really have to be running along. Don't cry. Oh, please, don't cry. l'm no good at all if anybody cries. Natalia, about Fritz pouncing... ...you see, l thought.... l didn't think.... How shall so grave a problem resolve itself? Poor thing. You can't marry him. You can't give him up. l don't suppose you'd ever consider seeing him on the sly, every now.... No, l didn't think so. My God, it's enough to drive a girl into a convent. Do they have Jewish nuns? -Good day. -Good day. Please...can you wash...? -Excuse me, miss, l think you lost this. -What? -l think you dropped this. -Yes, thank you. Can you wash my clothes... ...Monday, Tuesday? l'm sorry, l don't understand you. Excuse me, may l help you? l want my laundry back by Tuesday. The young lady would like her laundry back by Tuesday. l understand. lt's okay. Thank you so much. Maximilian von Heune. Sally Bowles. Do you have a cigarette? l'm absolutely desperate. l must have left mine at the club. The Kit Kat Klub. Divine decadence. May l drop you somewhere? l have my car outside. All right. -Auf wiedersehen. -Auf wiedersehen, darling. Money. Money. ''Money makes the world go around ''The world go around The world go around.

''Turk's blood.'' A famous German drink. lt's divine. l'll never drink anything else. Prost, my friend. Prost. Well, mes enfants, you are like me, adrift in Berlin. l think it's my duty to corrupt you. Agreed? Fascinating. Let's go to the Kempinsky. Darling, he's a baron. He never even told me. Class! He must know everybody. l betcha a man like that could get me into films... ...faster than you can say Eric von Stroheim. ln exchange for a little infidelity. A little infidelity? ldiot! Don't worry, l can handle him. Trust me. Just trust me, darling. All right, don't trust me. l had a marvelous time last night. So did l. Darling. Darling. Bri, darling, wake up. We have a visitor. Maximilian's here. Please, what time is it? -Three thirty. -l'm sorry, Brian, we're late. Oh, darling, we had the most glorious time. -We didn't stop laughing. -Don't open your eyes. Don't look! Okay. lsn't it fabulous? l feel just like Kay Francis. Bri, why didn't you come? We had the best time, and so much fun. -Max really knows how to corrupt a girl. -l try. Not only did l get this glorious pelt, l got perfume, l got silk stockings.... And you got that funny little blue hat. You call it funny. l think it's divine. l love it. Oh, God, we didn't get anything for Brian. l'm afraid l had no time to have it wrapped. Darling, isn't that beautiful? What on earth makes you think l'd accept that? -To give me pleasure. -Max loves buying things. Brian, you're a man of strong convictions. Can we have caviar again? But, you had it for breakfast. Can l have it for lunch? For lunch, for dinner, breakfast again-- Anything you want. Drei Caviar, bitte! That's for me. What are you having? Oh, you should have been there. The Nazis are just a gang of stupid hooligans, but they do serve a purpose. Let them get rid of the Communists. Later we'll be able to control them. -But who exactly is ''we''? -Germany, of course. Hey, Max, can we go to the Bristol Bar? -Why not? -Oh, wonderful. l'm dying to show off my new coat. l think l could do with a drink, too. Good. We'll make a night of it. Or, why not a weekend? Berlin makes strange bedfellows these days. Some people have one people... ...some have two. Some even.... ''Two ladies ''Two ladies ''Und l'm the only man, ja. ''l like it. ''They like it. ''This two for one. ''Two ladies ''Two ladies -Und he's the only man. -Ja. ''l like it. ''We like it. ''This two for one. ''l do the cooking. ''l make the beds. ''l go out daily to earn our daily bread. ''But we've one thing in common. ''He -She -Und me ''The key ''The key ''The key ''Two ladies. -Und he's the only man. -Ja! ''We switch partners daily To play as we please. -Twosies beats onesies -But nothing beats threes. ''l sleep in the middle. -l'm left. -Und l'm right. ''But there's room on the bottom lf you drop in some night. ''Und l'm the only man, ja. ''l like it. ''They like it. ''This two for one.'' -What'd he say? -He's asking about his asthma. Miss Bowles, in mother's room, l thought. -Mr. Roberts, in the blue room. -Yes, Mr. Baron. The master says in case you have nothing to change into... ...he asked me to bring you these. Thanks. Come in. No, no, help yourself. Please. l'm not quite sure, but l think they're mine. This used to be my room before l was married. Looks familiar. You can at least get out of that shirt. Try this one. Blue should be your color. Brian, not even a sweater? Are you still married? Very much so. -Where is your wife, now? -ln Cologne. For the culture. She lends her support to the arts. She in her way, l in mine. We have quite a special understanding. That must be useful at times. What about these? l was right. Blue is your color. We thought you deserted us permanently, Max. My dear Stephanie, l would never desert you. l find it very interesting. Your father must be a very important man, Miss Bowles. Oh, l'll say, darling. He's practically an ambassador. We have the most marvelous relationship.... lnstant he can tear himself away, he dashes to wherever l am. Oh, it's excellent, excellent. But the food here is always good. Excuse me, but didn't we meet with Emil Jannings at UFA last winter? l don't-- You do know Emil, don't you? l find him trs amusant. Money. Be careful! Clara Bow. -That's not Clara Bow. -lt's early Clara Bow. Wait, l got one. l got one. Late Sally Bowles. Yes, it is. You two are marvelous. Have you ever been to Africa? -Where, mein Schatz? -Africa. Let's go, the three of us. Smile Brian. -Sally, you're really talented. -What? You're talented. He wants to take us to Africa. He must be insane. More! Come on, please. More! More, more, more! Please! -That's all. -More! More, please! More! -Come on, Max. -No, no. No. Oh, please? Oh, bravo, bravo. The king of the jungle. What's the matter? You all right? You okay? Mombasa's quite wonderful, really. l mean, the way ports are all over the world. Sounds absolutely exotic. All the way through Tanganyika. Sure? Sally, champagne? Every now and then the train stops in the middle of nowhere... ...and right there is a family of giraffes, nibbling the trees... ...or a herd of zebra, galloping off in a cloud of dust. And when the flamingos come in, thousands and thousands of them... ...turning the whole sky pink.... You'll be amazed when you see it. Hey! Hey, Sally. Are you quite comfortable? Come on. Sally is an endearing child. But l must admit l find it peaceful when she's taking her nap. To Africa. To Africa. ''The sun on the meadow ls summery warm ''The stag in the forest runs free ''But gather together to greet the storm ''Tomorrow belongs to me. ''The branch of the linden ls leafy and green ''The Rhine gives its gold to the sea ''But somewhere a glory awaits unseen ''Tomorrow belongs to me. ''The babe in his cradle is closing his eyes ''The blossom embraces the bee '''But soon', says a whisper, 'arise, arise '''Tomorrow belongs to me.' ''Fatherland, fatherland, show us the sign ''Your children have waited to see. ''The morning will come When the world is mine ''Tomorrow belongs, Tomorrow belongs ''Tomorrow belongs to me. ''Fatherland, fatherland, show us the sign ''Your children have waited to see. ''The morning will come When the world is mine ''Tomorrow belongs, Tomorrow belongs ''Tomorrow belongs to me. ''Tomorrow belongs, Tomorrow belongs ''Tomorrow belongs to me.'' Do you still think you can control them? Natalia. Fritz, you frightened me. l'm sorry, but l must speak to you. No, go away. Please go away. l told you not to come. Natalia, please. The situation is impossible. We must not see each other anymore. ls it the money? ls it that? l did think it was the money, at first. But not now. Now l know that you love me. l know you are an honest man... ...who would never lie to me. Natalia, l beg of you, marry me. l can't. ls it your parents? lsn't it? lt's not my parents. lt is me. lt is you, too. Fritz, be careful! What am l doing? l've never jumped on a running board before. Are you all right? Why won't you marry me? Don't you see what is happening in Germany today? l'm a Jew. You are not. Goodbye, dear Fritz. You, drive. There is somebody in the way, sir. Just drive on, idiot! l told Schneider we'd be gone for at least two months, maybe more. She cried and cried and said she'd miss us. l think the only reason she was crying, though, was because she knew... ...she can't get 50 marks a month from anybody else... ...for this pitiful little room. You know: ''Money makes the world go around.'' Where've you been? l've been packing for hours. Have some champagne, darling. Compliments of Max. Oh, your laundry came back. lt's there on the bed. You know Bri, it occurred to me.... l know l've handled Max brilliantly.... Enough of the African moon. l mean, it would be funny, wouldn't it, if he asked me to become... ...the next Baroness von Heune und Regensburg? l've been looking for that for months. l mean, stranger things have happened. l wouldn't dream of accepting him, of course. For God's sake, l wish you could hear yourself sometimes. l mean, really hear yourself! Christ! Aren't you ever gonna stop deluding yourself? ''Handling Max!'' Behaving like some ludicrous, little, underage femme fatale! You're about as ''fatale'' as an after-dinner mint. Darling, we all know... ...about your vast experiences with les femmes... ...fatales, or otherwise. Why don't you just come out with it? You can't stand Maximilian because he's everything you're not! He doesn't have to give English lessons for three marks an hour. He's rich! And he knows about life. He doesn't read about it in books! He's suave... ...and he's divinely sexy... ...and he really appreciates a woman. Oh, screw Maximilian! l do. So do l. You two bastards! Two? Two?! Shouldn't that be three? Help us with our order.... l think your paper and your party are pure crap, sir! What did you say? l said: That's a lot of crap! And so are you! He's a foreigner. l hear you took on the entire Nazi party single-handed. Only two? Sounds like...cigarette? Feel up to a little surprise? Poor thing, you're blind. ''Dear Sally and Bri....'' ln that order, please note. ''l know you will forgive me, but family affairs make it imperative... ''...for me to leave for Argentina, immediately. ''lt was fun, wasn't it?'' Signed: ''Maximilian.'' Argentina, my ass. He also sent this. Three hundred marks. For the two of us. A hundred and fifty each. Let's see, on an hour-to-hour basis... ...that puts us on a par with Fraulein Kost. Some gold diggers, aren't we? Oh, Brian, l'm so sorry. Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew. Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew. Anything the matter? What is it? What's happened? Goddammit, l'm gonna have a baby! Well, aren't you gonna ask? All right. -Whose is it? -l don't know. l really don't know. -What are you going to do? -Obviously, l can't have it. The doctor l went to said he'll do it. But it's expensive. He has to... ...bribe somebody or other for some kind of... ...a certificate or something. Oh, l don't know. Well... ...there goes my fur coat. l would like to marry you. -Okay, a touch of toothpaste. -Naturally. A lot of gin. All whooshed up together. With this spiked prairie oyster, l thee wed. To the future. With any luck, l'll get a fellowship at King's. Oh, dear, what's that? My college at Cambridge. -You'll absolutely love it there. -l know l will. -lt's crazy. -Who? Me. Wanting to be an actress. l guess babies love you automatically, don't they? They don't have much of a choice. -To you and the baby. -To me and the baby. Probably is yours. But l don't suppose we'll ever know for sure. So what? You sure you don't mind? Honestly? Honestly. Oh, Bri.... -To me and the baby. -To you and the baby. To you. You. Me? To me. And the baby. -Oh, where are you going? -l'll be right back. You are a most strange and extraordinary person. l know, l know. The proud father. Good lord, Fritz. You're on time. l can't believe it. How's Natalia? Please, l do not speak of Natalia. As bad as that? Bad. Perhaps l cut myself at the throat. Prepositions, Fritz, prepositions. ''ln the throat?'' No, just ''cut my throat.'' l assure you... ...they're all in it together. lf all the Jews are bankers, then how can they be Communists, too? Subtle... ...very subtle, Fraulein Kost. lf they can't destroy us one way... ...they try the other. You don't really believe that, do you? But you read it every day in the Volkischer Beobachter. That ridiculous Nazi tripe! lt is an established fact, Herr Roberts... ...that there exists a well-organized international conspiracy... ...of Jewish bankers and Communists. lt's also an established fact, that there exists... ...another well-organized group, of which you're obviously a member. The lnternational Conspiracy of Horses' Asses. l wish the Kaiser was back. ln those days we had order. l expect Schneider will raise my rent after that little exhibition. Oh, well, what the hell. Let's get on with these prepositions. What a black day l'm meeting that girl! l...l thought you loved her. Love, love, who's needing verdammtes love? You want to hear the big joke on me? You want to hear it? l am a Jew. So? To be a Jew in Germany? Only a fool is this, l think. So... ...l come to Berlin and l'm not a Jew. How did you manage that? Where it says on my papers ''religion''... ...l am writing...''Protestant.'' So, the work comes. The friends come. The parties come. Parties. Whoever dreams that l shall fall in love with a Jewish girl? But surely that solves your problem. -All you've got to do is tell her-- -Do you understand nothing? This girl! Do you know what she has done to me? lt's terrible! She has turned me into an honest man. ''Oh, you're good,'' she says. ''A man of integrity, who will never lie to me.'' What does she do if l tell her now? l tell you what she does, if l tell her now. She kicks me out into the streets. Don't be silly! She'd understand. Anyway, what have you got to lose? What do l lose? She kicks me out into the streets. All my friends hear l'm a Jew, they kick me out into the streets. And then, l think, comes a big Nazi with a club and bangs me on the head. Fritz, l really think you're underestimating Natalia. What am l doing? l don't like whiskey. Look, just tell her. No, l can't, l can't. What a coward am l. ''l know what you're thinking. ''You wonder why l chose her ''Out of all the ladies in the world. ''lt's just a first impression. ''What good's a first impression? ''lf you knew her like l do ''lt would change your point of view. ''lf you could see her through my eyes ''You wouldn't wonder at all. ''lf you could see her through my eyes ''l guarantee you would fall like l did. ''When we're in public together ''l hear society moan ''But if they could see her through my eyes ''Maybe they'd leave us alone. ''How can l speak of her virtues ''l don't know where to begin. ''She's clever, She's smart ''She reads music. ''She doesn't smoke or drink gin like l do ''Yet when we're walking together ''They sneer if l'm holding her hand ''But if they could see her through my eyes ''Maybe they'd all understand. ''Why don't they leave us alone?'' Meine Damen und Herren, mesdames et messieurs... ...ladies und gentlemen... ...l ask you... ...is it a crime to fall in love? Can one ever choose where the heart leads us? All we ask is that you understand. A little understanding. Why can't the world live and let live? Live und let live. ''Oh, l understand your objection ''l grant you the problem's not small ''But if you could see her ''Through my eyes ''She wouldn't look Jewish at all.'' l'm a Jew. Brian, anything wrong? Lazy that's all. That's all? That's all. Look what l found. See? We must be lucky. Will you still love me when l'm blown up like a balloon? Will my body drive you wild with desire? Sure. Why not? Oh, Bri, it's fantastic, isn't it? Just think: Your life and my life... ...solved in one fell swoop. And all by the baby! l guess it's just about the most significant baby the world has ever known... ...since Jesus. lt'll be a most strange and extraordinary baby, won't it? Good morning, darling. Darling, would you mind seeing if there's a bit of brandy left? Put an egg in it, and we'll call it breakfast. l suppose you wonder what on earth happened to me? l'm afraid we made a night of it. Where's your fur coat? You did it, didn't you? Did what, darling? The abortion. ln God's name... ...why? One of my whims? ls that all you can say? ''One of my whims?'' What right...? lf you wanna hit me, why don't you just hit me? But you wanted it. Didn't you? Me and the baby. l suppose Max Reinhardt did show up at the club. Or was it a friend of a friend of a friend of... ...an assistant director who said he'd try to squeeze you into the chorus line? That is, of course, if you... ...if you went to bed with him. -You think that? -Yes. Well then, it's just as well, isn't it? For you, for everyone. And, darling, would you be an angel and just let me get some sleep? Tell me why you did it. What is there to say? You've said it all in one way or another. Sally, please. l have to know. Okay. l'm self-centered, inconsiderate... ...and what was the third adjective? Oh, yes. And l have this infantile fantasy... ...that one day l'll amount to something as an actress. A dinky little cottage in Cambridge? A playpen in the bedroom, diapers on the towel rack.... How soon would it be before we started hating each other? How soon would it be before l started dashing out... ...disgracing myself at some nearest pub? And how soon would it be before...? Before? Say it. Go on! You might as well, now. Forget it. Just forget it. l see. l really do love you. Yes. Yes, l think... ...l think you do love me. You...you all right? ls there anything l can... ...do for you? l just think l should sleep a little while. Oh, shit! Magazines? No. lt's a long trip. Chocolate? No. -We seem to be here. -Yes. l'd love to come down on the platform with you... ...and wave a tiny, white handkerchief etcetera... ...but there is that interview. lt may not amount to anything... ...but you never know. Shocking. l'll see you. Meine Damen und Herren, mesdames et messieurs... ...ladies und gentlemen... ...l give you that international zensation... ...Fraulein Sally Bowles.

They're wonderful, and fun to travel with. Course, they keep us in separate cages. Not that I can't be trusted. I'm married to a woman who's a terrific sport. She even looks like Joe DiMaggio. Joe DiMaggio? Yeah, she's so ugly that... Anybody out there, or have we been captured? But all kidding aside, I just wanna say to all you guys and nurses what a thrill it is to be in Korea with you. We're all in this together, right? That guy's first. Get this guy inside. Give him a third of a grain of morphine. - Quarter of a grain's enough. - A third. - Are you going over my head? - Just through the hole in it. - Now you hold it! And that's an order! - Move! That's a threat! - This is a gold oak leaf. - I thought it was a little big for dandruff. He's a big guy in severe pain. He can handle a third of a grain. If not, the anaesthesiologist can support breathing. - Go do what I said. - Informed opinion says a quarter. Informed opinion isn't on a stretcher with a boot full of blood. You've insulted me in the presence of others for the last time. Don't forget your hat, Frank. This guy with laryngitis walks into the doctor's office and sees a beautiful nurse. She's built like a brick hospital. Down, Charlie. He walks in - the guy with laryngitis - and says ""Is the doctor in?"" And the nurse winks and says ""No, come on in."" Yeah, but really, though, I know how hard you medics and nurses really work. I really do. Although... I wouldn't mind being paid for playin' doctor, though. - How am I doin'? - Not too good. His BP's low. His pulse is rapid. Gimme another unit of blood. I gotta go into his chest. This could take a while. I hope he doesn't have a late date. Is it necessary to make bad jokes while operating? - Absolutely. Scalpel. - Scalpel. I've found it invaluable to make bad jokes since my first autopsy, when my colleagues put a kidney under my cap. - Sponge? - Sponge. - How am I doin' now? - You're fine. He's in trouble. Can I be of any help? You can pray for me to become a better doctor in the next five minutes. Excuse me, Father. # Why don't we do this more often # Just what we're doing tonight # Gee, but it's great to get together again # Why does it only happen now and then? # We ought to do this more often # Don't you agree that I'm right? # We make each other laugh # We make each other sing - Why aren't you at the switchboard? - You asked me to come here. They could phone about my wife any minute. You just spoke to the hospital. She's not in labour yet. Don't argue! It's bad enough that she's having a baby and I can't be there with her. Yes, sir. Well, at least you were there for the important part. # Just what we're doin' tonight You know that joke about the guy who saves his regiment? Shoots the cook? No. How's it go? - Kaplan, pass the salt. - No. I beg your pardon? This dentist is not touching anything that hasn't been checked by the bomb squad. Taking rides in your chair again? That makes you dizzy. - Reach into my pocket. - I hardly know you. My shirt pocket. - My travel orders. I'm going home today. - No kidding. - Mind if I look, for drooling purposes? - You unfold it. I could get a paper cut. I'm not having any last-minute infections. - Aren't you stretching things a bit? - I haven't used the latrine in 18 hours. - Now that's something I didn't have to know. - In my pocket. Can't be too careful. Friend of mine got his orders, broke his leg the next day. Got it tangled in a nurse at his farewell party. Well, you got a good point there, Kaplan, and good luck. # Again # This couldn't happen again # This is that once in a lifetime # This is the thrill divine You're not eating. Know something I don't? - Something's troubling me. - Think of me as your mother, Father. - May I make a confession? - As long as you don't use real names. For some time now, I've been comparing the disparity of our callings. Doctor versus priest. You fellows are always able to see the end result of your work. I mean, you know immediately if you've been successful. For me, the results are far less tangible. Sometimes - most of the time - I honestly don't know whether I'm doing any good or not. I used to have a professor in med school who said: ""God cures the patients but the doctor takes the fee."" Do you think that's true? I'm able to do things in surgery that I'm not really good enough to do. Thanks, Hawkeye. # But never, never again # Never again - Gimme some suction. - Yes, Doctor. Feels like someone used my eyeballs for a teabag. Nurse! Trapper, you better not be much longer. - Clamp? - Clamp. Thanks. OK, come on. Stay with us, will ya? Hello? Hello, uh, Bloomington, Illinois? - General Hospital? - You got them? - I'm calling about Mrs Henry Blake. - Maternity. Right. She's pregnant. You know, with a baby. Yeah. OK, OK. They're ringing her room. Boy, can you imagine? I am becoming a father for the third time. Yes, sir. They know what causes that now. - What are they doing? - Hello? Yes? - I'm still holding, operator. - Why am I so nervous? For gosh sakes, she's got the best obstetrician in town. Marv Handleman. He could deliver a baby with his eyes shut. That's the only way I'd do it, sir. Yes? What? Are you sure? Sir? She's not there any more. - She's not there any more? - We'll get right back to ya. - I just... - It's all right. They sent her home. She had a false labour. - She had a what? - A false labour? - Radar? - Steady, sir. - I'm not gonna make it. - Steady, sir. Just sit. OK. Everything's gonna be fine. Would you believe that I've got a craving for dill pickles? That's the last of the shrapnel. - Close him fast. - Gimme some 3-0 silk. - I've lost the pulse. - I'm gonna massage the heart. Get some adrenaline ready. - Hang on, dammit! - Still no pulse. - Adrenaline! Let's go! - It's going again. But it's irregular. Oh, God... Yes, operator, go ahead, I can hear you. - Seven pounds, two ounces, 21 inches? - What's, uh, seven pounds, two ounces? Your son, sir. My son? - My wife's had a boy? - Well, it isn't a girl-son, sir. Your wife is doing just fine. It's the hospital. The hospital? Listen, tell Mildred - Mrs Blake - that her husband, Henry, loves her very much. - She didn't hear your name. - What? Henry. H as in... Never mind, she knows my name. Just tell her that I love her, and that I'll call her and that all my labour pains have stopped. Goodbye. - Congratulations, sir. - Thanks, Radar. A son. A boy. So this woman gets up real close to the guy in the sailor suit and she says: - ""So what kind of doctor are you?"" - Guy says ""Me? I'm a naval doctor."" And she says ""Boy, when you specialise, you really specialise!"" Ohh, so it's that kind of a crowd, huh? You really go for the sophisticated stuff, huh? # I had the craziest dream # Last night, yes, I did # I never dreamt it could be # Yet there you were # In love with me # I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you # And you didn't mind it at all # Not at all - You've never had any children, have you? - Being single, it never seemed a wise move. It's too bad. It's a great feeling. Then why do you sound like a hit-and-run victim? Me? I couldn't be happier. There's no disgrace in being depressed because you can't be with your new baby. Yeah, inasmuch as no umbilical cord reaches 20,000 miles. Here's to your new son, Henry. Yeah. Yeah. But let's hope I meet him before he gets drafted and sent over here. # Say it and make my craziest dream # Come true Let's hear it for the girls! How about this band? They're gonna do a number, but first I'll tell you about Charlie. Charlie served in World War II. Remember it? It was in all the papers. What'd he say? Uh... I didn't really hear. Charlie's in a hospital with a sheet over him. He pulls it down and sees himself being wheeled away on a stretcher. He asks the orderly ""Where we goin'?"" The orderly says ""To be buried."" He says ""I'm not dead."" Orderly says ""Wanna make a fool outta the doctor?"" It doesn't look good, Trapper. - You did your best. - Too bad it was so lousy. What's goin' on? There's a rumour you three eloped. I started out to be an architect. Couldn't handle the math. - Why don't you get some rest? - Here, Father. We need some cross action. The blood pressure is still low, but it's better. Hang another unit of blood. What was that about not being sure you did good? It's not supposed to work that way, you know. Go hit the sack or I'll report you to the doctors and the architects. I'll take care of him. Come on. You know something? Those two could wind up... Uh, yes? Rolling Easter eggs. Captain Kaplan? Pile in. Move over. You think I'm putting my life in your hands? - What are you - 19? - I'm 18, sir. My feet have corns older than you. What is that? A disinfectant? Who knows where this kid's hands have been? - Goodbye, Doctor. - Please, Nurse, no offence... I'm a dentist. I know. The mouth is a playground for germs. If the tongue weren't attached, it'd jump out in a minute. - Is it possible to bless a jeep, Father? - Consider it done. We better go. You have a plane to catch. Don't remind me. As we're talking, the propeller's getting older. Well, goodbye, everybody. - Lucky man. - Certainly is. I knew it! Did I know it? Did I know... did I say it? I said it from the very beginning. Jinxed. Look at that. Anybody can step on the gas instead of the brake. - How's the driver? - The kid's OK. Figures! I'm going home, I'm in pieces! He's staying here, he didn't bust a pimple. You know how I'm getting home when the time comes? I'm walking! You're not leaving me alone! - Would you like a surprise, sir? - Yes, I would. I'd like to be stolen by Gypsies and taken to their camp in Illinois. Close your eyes. Radar, this is not a good day for playing games. Please? Yeah. OK, now, no peeking now. Yeah. - Well? - Just a minute. - Oh, boy. - I'm coming. Mm-hmm. - Can I open my eyes yet? - Not yet. Hold out your hands. OK, open 'em. Oh... oh, don't cry. Radar, where did this baby come from? You're not in any kind of trouble, are you? Oh, no, no, sir. His mother works in the camp laundry. I just thought, since you couldn't get to see your own son... He's, uh, he's a beautiful boy. - Can she speak English, Radar? - Uh, no, sir. But it's nice you could smile in Korean. - Well, I guess we'd better get back to work. - Yes, sir. Sir? In a minute. # You make me feel so young # You make me feel there are songs to be sung # Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung # And even when I'm old and grey # I'm gonna feel the way I feel today # Cos you make me feel so # You make me feel so # You make me feel so young # So young Just wait a second. It's been a ball, an honour, and a privilege meeting with you like this. It's time to go because they're winding up the rubber band on the airplane. On behalf of the Miller Sisters, let's hear it! Charlie Keller and his Clan of Lunatics. And me, yes sirree, in person, Jackie Flash, saying we'll be back to see you again real soon. Same time, same place, same war. So long now, and God bless ya. Yes, sir, let's hear it out there., Jesus! ""To the city of San Francisco. I will enjoy killing one person every day... ...until you pay me one hundred thousand dollars. If you agree, say so tomorrow morning... ...at personal column, San Francisco Chronicle... ...and I will set up meeting. If I do not hear from you... ...it'll be my next pleasure to kill a Catholic priest or a..."" ""Scorpio."" What goes on in their minds? Kooks. Where the hell does he expect me to find a hundred thousand dollars? You're not thinking of paying him, are you, Mr. Mayor? The City of San Francisco does not pay criminals not to commit crimes. Instead, we pay a police department. Chief, who's in charge of this case? Inspector Callahan. He's outside. Send Inspector Callahan in. Callahan? Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan. All right. Let's have it. - Have what? - Your report. What have you been doing? For the past 3/4 hour... ...I've been sitting on my ass waiting on you. Damn it, Harry. It's the mayor you're talking to. Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan? There's a madman loose. I've asked you what's being done. Fair enough? We've got a dozen men checking identification files. Checking on all known extortionists, rooftop prowlers... ...rifle nuts, peepers... Mr. Mayor? We've arranged for rooftop surveillance and helicopters... ...especially around the Catholic churches and schools... ...and in the black area. Ballistics is checking on the slug. We're sure it's a 30-06. Seven lands and grooves, right-hand twist... We're running a computer check... ...on everybody in the files whose birthday falls between... ...October 23 and November 21. Why? Natives of Scorpio. Thank you, inspector. Have you mentioned this note to anyone? How about you? Nobody. Your wife, sweetheart? Press? Nobody. All right. Give the message to the Chronicle. We'll pay. But we need time to get the money together. Wait a minute. Do I get this right? You'll play this creep's game? It'll give us breathing space. It might get somebody killed. Let me meet with the son of a bitch! Nope, none of that. We would end up with a real bloodbath. I agree with the chief. We'll do it this way. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Come on, Callahan, let's go. I don't want trouble, like you had last year in the Fillmore district. That's my policy. When an adult male is chasing a female... ...with intent to commit rape, I shoot the bastard. That's my policy. Intent? How did you establish that? When a naked man chases a woman in an alley with a knife and a hard-on... ...I figure he isn't out collecting for the Red Cross. I think he's got a point. - Inspector Callahan. - Jaffe. Usual. Usual lunch, or usual dinner? What difference does it make? Not much. Hey, Jaffe... ...is that tan Ford still in front of the bank? Tan Ford? Yeah, tan Ford. Engine running? I don't know. How can I tell? - Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe. - That's awful! Look at that pollution. Do me a favor, will you? Call this telephone number. Police Department? Tell them Inspector Callahan thinks there's a... ...two-eleven in progress at the bank. Got it? Got it. Be sure and tell them it's in progress, right? In progress. Yes, sir. Now, if they'll just wait till the cavalry arrives. Shit! Halt! I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? To tell the truth, in the excitement I kind of lost track myself. This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world... ...and would blow your head clean off... ...you've got to ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well, do you, punk? I got to know. Son of a bitch! It looks like we can save that leg. I've got a couple under my knee. Ever consider another line of work? I really appreciate this, Steve. We Potrero Hill boys have to stick together. Nothing fancy, now. Just a little tweezers and Mercurochrome. Do I tell you how to beat a confession out of a prisoner? - I haven't got all night. - You might experience discomfort. But if you do, just have your wife fix a... Sorry, Harry. - What will you do with those? - Cut your pants off. - No. We'll pull them off. - It'll hurt. For $29.50, let it hurt. You can turn your back if you're embarrassed. - Good morning, inspector. - Maria. You wanted to see me, lieutenant? When the hell you going to get a haircut? Whenever you do. Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m. checking the search patterns. - Put in for overtime. - That'll be the day. You made a good pinch. Chief was pleased. - He was? - He said to say, ""Well done!"" I can't tell you how moved I am. I pass along a compliment... ...you could be a little polite. It might not kill you to say thanks. I'd rather say thanks to a raise. Harry, check communications. Something from Chicago. A gun nut. - I'll get right on it. - Now wait a minute! I'm putting somebody with you. - What are you talking about? - You need a partner. - What's wrong with the one I've got? - He's in the hospital! - He'll be out in a few weeks. - Say hello to Chico Gonzales. - He'll be working with you. - You must be kidding. I have no time to break in newcomers. - Why don't you do this boy a favor? - What do you mean? You know what happens to guys I worked with. Deitzick's in the hospital... ...and Fanduchi's dead. So? If I need a partner, I'll get me one who knows what he's doing. What about De Georgio? No way! You work with Gonzales or you don't work. Straight from the fifth floor. Got it? I got it. If you see De Georgio, send him in here! You from around here? Yeah, but I went to San Jose State. - Play ball? - No, I boxed. Light heavyweight. Just what I need is a college boy. - Found anything you like about me yet? - It's early yet. - Get your degree? - Sociology. Sociology! You'll go far, if you live. I intend to. Inspector Callahan. Don't let your degree get you killed. I'm liable to get killed with you. I'll remember that. - Hero! Nice work yesterday. - Fatso! Bressler wants to see you. You're a sweet man, Harry. There is one question, Inspector Callahan. Why do they call you Dirty Harry? That's one thing about our Harry. Doesn't play favorites. Harry hates everybody: limeys, micks, hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks. You name it. - How does he feel about Mexicans? - Ask him! Especially spics. Hey! There's a guy on the roof over there! On Stockton Street by Washington Square. You, on the roof! You, there! Yes, you. Stop what you're doing. Turn around and put your hands in the air. I don't know how the helicopter boys lost him! How could they let him get out without seeing him? They were probably talking instead of looking, like they were supposed to. That's possible. - Attention, all units. - Turn that thing up louder. Prowler last seen in the vicinity of Washington Square. He is an adult male. Caucasian. Repeat, adult male Caucasian. When last seen, he was wearing tan chinos... ...pale blue shirt, brown coat or sweater, dark gloves. He had a tan suitcase... ...which probably contains a 30-06 rifle. He's wanted... Those loonies! They ought to throw a net over the whole bunch! I know what you mean. - There! - What? Tan suitcase. - Where? - I lost him. There he goes, over there. Does that bag look tan? I don't know, I haven't even seen him yet. Go to Filbert and hang a left. Look out for these people! - Fruitcake! - Get out of the way, hammerhead! It was a tan suitcase. I know it was. I saw him. - There he is. - I see him. Car 2, the license number... ...at 10-32 on that Chevrolet, Colorado plates. - How do you want to work this? - Find another entrance. I'll go here. Car 2, what's the model of that Chevrolet? Car 2. It's an Impala convertible. 10-4. You can cancel that 10-25. Three cars here. Anybody home? - I brought you a nice present. - Let me see it. It's beautiful! Why don't you go get a nice container of egg rolls? You getting an eyeful? You goddamn pie hawker! - We should call the police. - I am a police... Up against the wall. Right now! Move. - Let them go. - Let them go? - You heard me. - They assaulted a police officer. A police officer! He was standing on a can peeking in... ...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend! Beat it. Get out of here. - How about the man with the suitcase? - Wrong number. I just had another thought. Yeah? About what? About why they call you Dirty Harry. Inspector 71. Inspector 71. Please respond to your call. Inspector 71. Do you read me? - This is Inspector 71. - I've got an 8-0-4 in progress. California Hall at Polk and Turk streets. 10-4. We're on our way. It's some idiot. Where? I don't see him. - There he is. - Yeah. Now I see him. I have a 10-29 and a 10-28. In 600 block of Baker. On a Chevrolet. California license D-dog, C- Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2. We thought it was your sniper, but it turned out to be a suicide attempt. - Anybody try to talk him down? - Yeah, no luck. But now you're here... - You mean, I go up. - We'd sure appreciate it. Don't you try to get me! Not me. You're the one who wants to get yourself killed. Not me. Always happens with you guys. The last minute you want to... ...grab onto somebody, take somebody with you. Down you go. Not me! Won't you try to grab me? A friend of mine was up about 20 floors with a jumper a few years ago. The jumper grabbed him and they went off. Mashed all over. Couldn't tell which legs was with which, which arms with which... It was a terrible mess. I tell you, I almost threw up myself. - I'd just like your name and address. - Why? It's a mess down there afterwards! It makes identification impossible. Even if they find your driver's license! All that blood! I think I'm going to puke! Don't do that, son. All those people down there looking up. The fire chief looking up. With his face... You bastard! Get the stretcher up here. Now you know why I'm called Dirty Harry. Every dirty job that comes along. Inspector 71. This is Inspector 71. Got something for you. Corner of Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro. What about him? Shot in the face. Blew part of it away. Anybody know who the boy is? His name was Charlie Russell. I'm his mother. He's only 10 years old. Inspector, this officer... Oh, Jesus Christ! You'd better go check on the mother. What do you have? That 30-06 shell casing. He was up here all right. Welcome to Homicide. The man who designed blue serge uniforms for police departments... ...has to sell these for a living! .458 Magnum? - This thing will stop an elephant. - Yeah. - Apparently you like a little edge. - All I can get, sir. He's no elephant, Harry. He's no animal of any kind. What have you got, lieutenant? The blue flags represent the units that will be on duty by dark tonight. - Double shifts and overtime. - At nighttime. Daylight, the helicopters will keep him off the roofs. We're going for high visibility. Units will make themselves very noticeable. - Except here. - Right. The North Beach area. We're saving that for him. - Have you found a good stakeout? - I think so. It's a building that overlooks the roof where they spotted him yesterday. Something bothering you? - Nothing. - Speak up. You're among friends here. It seems a long shot that he'd come back to the same roof. There are a lot of rooftops in San Francisco. Most of them are locked. This particular one'll be open for him. These sick guys have behavior patterns. We know they'll rob the very same store 3, 4 times in a row. Must appeal to their superego or something. Scorpio strikes again. They like that feeling. There's one other reason why he might pick the same rooftop. He's got a clear view of the St. Peter and Paul's Church. And they're having a novena tonight. Go on. The note. He threatened to kill a priest or a Negro. The Russell boy was black. He may just figure he owes himself a padre. Inspector 71. We're in position to start our surveillance. How about the priest? - He knows he's being set up for bait? - Yeah, he wanted to. We told him we had a volunteer willing to take his place. Who? Never guess. Yeah, I know. Welcome to Homicide. You owe it to yourself to live a little, Harry. Son of a bitch took the bait! When I say ""now,"" hit him with the light. Now! - You all right? - I think so. Call an ambulance. Collins never knew what hit him. Let's go. Clear the alley. There's nothing to see. Call headquarters. He's loose in North Beach. It's a whole new ball game, fellows. He grabbed a 14-year-old girl. Ann Mary Deacon. The bomb squad got a call. Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park. It was addressed to the mayor. The lab sent it to us, with this letter inside. ""Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive."" The poor kid went to the movies last night and never came home. ""Double-crossing San Francisco police made me do this. Now ransom $200,000, in used tens and twenties. One man with yellow bag. South side Marina. Green East Harbor. 9 p.m. She has oxygen till 3 a.m. tomorrow. Red panties and bra. Nice tits. Mole on left thigh. Anything cute and you'll force me to let girl die... ...of slow suffocation. Signed, Scorpio."" Anything else? The mother identified the bra... ...the hank of hair... ...and that. The dentist identified that. Said it was pulled out with a pair of pliers. You know she's dead. All I know is the letter says she'll be alive until 3 a.m. The mayor's out trying to put the money together now. He's using up a lot of favors. He wants to pay. No tricks. We need a bag man. You want the job? You got it. - Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m. - All right. - Wait a minute. What about me? - You're out. No cover? Not even one man? Sure that's how to do it? I'm not sure! But those are my orders. All right? No wonder they call him Dirty Harry. He gets the shit end of the stick. One more word and you're chopped off at the ankles. Al, let's split the difference. Give him the night off. Get the hell out of here, both of you. Testing 1, 2, 3... - What are you yelling for? - All you have to do is whisper. ""Mary had a little lamb, its fleece as white as snow."" Okay, that's better. It's good for 2 or 3 blocks. But in a tunnel... ...forget it. All right, Sid. What do I owe you? Bring it back in one piece. Count it and sign for it. Did you count it out? Did you count it, chief? It's not my responsibility. Always knew I'd get rich on the police force. Just make sure nobody takes it away from you. God knows how he'll contact you. He'll probably run you all over town. Go where you're told. Do what you're told. Play it straight down the line. Okay? Nothing cute. Nothing fancy. Just pay the ransom money and report back here. Would you mind if I borrowed a little Scotch tape? It's disgusting that a police officer should know how to use that weapon. - You got a yellow suitcase? - Yeah, I got it right with me. - What's your name? - Callahan. - What are you? - Police officer. Hello? All right, police officer... ...this is how we play. I bounce you all over town to make sure you're alone. If I even think you're being followed, the girl dies. If you talk to anyone, even if it's a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost... ...the girl dies. - Is the girl okay? - Just shut up and listen. No car. I give you some time to go from phone booth to phone booth. I ring 4 times. You don't answer by the fourth ring... ...that's the end of the game. The girl dies. What time you got? - 9:30. Now listen... - You listen. I'm watching you. Not all the time, but you'll never know when or where. Now get to Forest Hills Station as fast as you can. Understand? - Yeah. - I hope you're not stupid. Downstairs. Take the ""K"" car. Get off at Church and 20th. Hurry up, or you'll blow it. You sound like you had a good rest. You'll need it. I'm going to give you a nice little run this time. You better make it, because if you don't, dead girl! Public phone, hamburger stand, Aquatic Park. Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard. What's in the bag, man? - You dudes get lost now, you hear? - Screw the bag! Just give us the wallet. You don't listen, do you, asshole? Don't answer that! - Who picked it up? - Some old guy. Never saw him before. Chico, he hung up. - You know Mt. Davidson Park? - Yeah. Go to the cross. I'm at the entrance on Lansdale Street. I'm going up. I see a couple of people. Just a couple of kids necking. Boys or girls? I'm Callahan. My friends call me Alice. And I will take a dare. When was the last time you were busted? If you're a vice, I'll kill myself. Well, do it at home. Freeze! Just like a statue. That's right. One wrong move, anything, I don't care. I'll kill you and the girl both. Understand? Yeah. Drop the bag. Left hand. Let's see the gun. My! That's a big one. Left hand. Throw it. Easy. Raise your hands. Come on, get them up. Now turn. Face the cross. Come on. Put your nose right up against the cement. You lift that hand once more and I won't let you know where the girl is! Do we understand each other? Do we understand each other? Don't pass out on me yet! No, no. No, no. Not yet. Not yet! Don't pass out on me yet, you rotten oinker! Do we understand each other? If you care what happens to the girl, you'd better answer me! All right? Listen to me carefully. I've changed my mind. I'm going to let her die. I just wanted you to know that. You understand? I just wanted to make sure you knew that before I killed you. Goodbye, Callahan! Chico, don't kill him! The hospital report on Gonzales looks okay, chief. Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid. He's right here. He's got two cracked ribs. They want to do some more tests on him in the morning. The son of a bitch really kicked him a couple of beauts. I'm sending him home. Right, chief. He says beat it! That's an order. The chief wants to know if I misunderstood his orders. Meaning, am I just plain stupid or did I deliberately disobey him? He wants to know what Gonzales was doing there. He wants to know why we screwed everything up. What am I going to tell him? Why don't you start by telling him the truth? Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders from a superior. Me. Tell him you didn't know anything about it. When this is over, if he wants my badge, he can have that too. You wouldn't have a belt of booze around here, would you? Lieutenant Bressler's office. - Put him on. - What is it? It's Park Emergency. They just treated a guy who had a knife wound in the leg. Yeah, Doctor? What'd this guy look like? Long blond hair... ...medium build, about 150 pounds. Pale complexion. - He didn't give you his name, Doc? - Nope. They usually give a phony name. But I've seen him someplace. It's important you remember. There's a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating. I'm trying to think! It was... I believe he works around here. Doctor, could you give him something? He's in pain! Yes, just a moment. She'll be dead in an hour! I'm trying to remember! I've got who he is. When they had football, he used to sell programs at the stadium. I think the groundskeeper lets him live there. - Live where? - There. Kezar Stadium. Illegal entry. No warrant. Looks like we climb. Too much linguine. I'll find another way. Stop! Don't do anything more! You tried to kill me! You need any help? - Go on and get some air, fatso. - Please! No more! Can't you see I'm hurt? You shot me! Please, don't! Let me have a doctor! Please, get me the doctor! Don't kill me! The girl, where is she? You tried to kill me! If I did, your head would be splattered all over this field. Where's the girl? I want a lawyer. I said, where's the girl? - I have the right for one. - Where's the girl? I have the right to a lawyer! Don't! Please! I have rights. I want a lawyer! Harry Callahan. He said it was urgent. Yes, the district attorney has been wanting to talk to you. - It's Inspector Callahan. - Have him come in, please. Won't you come this way? - May I bring you in a cup of coffee? - No, thanks. I'll be done in a minute. Have a seat. I've just been looking over your arrest report. A very unusual piece of police work. Really amazing. I had some luck. You're lucky I'm not indicting you for assault with intent to commit murder! Where does it say you've got a right to kick down doors, torture suspects? Deny medical attention and legal counsel? Where have you been? Does Escobedo ring a bell? Miranda? You must have heard of the 4th Amendment! What I'm saying is, that man had rights. I'm all broken up about that man's rights. You should be. I've got news for you. When he's well enough to leave the hospital, he walks. What are you talking about? He's free! You're letting him go? We have to. We can't try him. And why is that? Because I'm not wasting 1/2 million tax dollars... ...on a trial we can't possibly win. The problem is, we don't have any evidence. - What do you call that? - I call it nothing. Zero. You're saying that Ballistics can't match the bullet up to this rifle? It does not matter what Ballistics can do! This rifle might make a nice souvenir. - But it's inadmissible as evidence! - Who says? It's the law. Then the law is crazy! This is Judge Bannerman of the appellate court. He holds classes in constitutional law. I've asked him for an opinion. Your Honor? In my opinion, the search of the suspect's quarters was illegal. Evidence obtained thereby, such as that hunting rifle for instance... ...is inadmissible in court. You should have gotten a search warrant. I'm sorry. - It's that simple. - Search warrant? A girl was dying! She was, in fact, dead according to the medical report! But I didn't know that! The court would recognize the officer's legitimate concern for the girl... ...but there is no way they can possibly condone police torture. All evidence concerning the girl, the suspect's confession... ...physical evidence... ...would have to be excluded. There must be something you can get him on! Without the evidence of the gun and the girl? I couldn't convict him of spitting on the sidewalk! Now, the suspect's rights... ...were violated... ...under the 4th and 5th... ...and probably the 6th and 14th Amendments. And Ann Mary Deacon, what about her rights? She's raped and left in a hole to die! Who speaks for her? The district attorney's office! If you'll let us. I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want him on the streets any more than you do. He won't be out there long. What is that supposed to mean? Sooner or later he will stub his toe and I'll be there. This office won't stand for any harassment! You're crazy if you think you've heard the last of him. He will kill again. How do you know? Because he likes it. You sure you weren't tailed? Yeah. You really want $200 worth. Every penny of it. Might as well be comfortable. Go on, sit. Relax. Take it easy. It's going to be all right. You sure you want the rest of it? Every penny's worth! You black son of a bitch! This one's on the house. That's got to be him. Are you claiming that the San Francisco Police did this to you? I swear it. As God is my judge. Why are they harassing you? They tried to frame me with the murder. And now they're trying to murder me. And look at me! I'm innocent until proven guilty and look at what they did to me. Everywhere I go cops follow me. And just look at me! Just a minute, nurse. Let me ask him one more question. Did you see who did this to you? Can you identify him? His name is Callahan. He's a big cop. Works Homicide. Callahan. Now, that's the rerun from the 4 o'clock news. Since then he's given a statement to The Chronicle. He claims you've been following him. And beat him up. What about it, Harry? - You want my star? - I want an answer. Have you been following him? Yeah, I've been following him on my own time. - Anybody can tell I didn't do that. - How? Because he looks too damn good, that's how! Before I let you go, let's get one thing straight. I don't want any more surveillance! Neither does he. What does that mean? Good night, sir. Go ahead. Try them. - Guy makes them where I always eat. - Thank you. I talked to Bressler about being on with me. So you know you got a spot when you get out. I don't know if I am coming back, Harry. Doing a lot of thinking about it and... I have a teaching credential. And I figure... ...what for? You know? - Time for therapy. - You hang in there now. See you tomorrow. Same time? - It's my fault, you know. - What? His leaving. I thought I could take it. No class. - Don't ever say that. - What? Don't ever low-rate yourself. What I meant was, whatever it takes to be a cop's wife... ...I'm just not sure I'm making it. He really tries, and all these bastards... ...""pig"" this and ""pig"" that. But maybe it's when I watch him walk out that door at night. And I think... ...what if it's the last time I see him? Am I the only one? Doesn't it drive your wife crazy? No. You mean she got used to it? No, she never did, really. What, then? She's dead. Please, forgive me. She was driving home and a drunk crossed the center line. No reason for it, really. - I'm so sorry. - That's okay. I want you to tell Chico... ...that I understand him quitting. I think he's right. This is no life for you two. - Why do you stay in it, then? - I don't know. I really don't. Let me have a fifth of Seagram's. Please. What the hell happened to you? My wife's brother. I hit her... ...so he hit me. Several times. You're the guy that's been robbed all these times. 14 times the last 3 years. Last 2 times, I sent them out of here on platters. I'm getting to be a pretty good shot. And I always keep it right here. Right where it's handy. Please, I scare easy. Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer! Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Everybody out who gets out here? School bus inspector. One minute. I'm not allowed to have anybody... I'm authorizing it, so go. What are you doing? I don't know you. Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll decorate this bus with your brains. - Where? - Just get started. I'll tell you where. Let's have some fun now. Who knows a song? Everybody knows a song. You? You must know a beautiful one. Come on, sing for us. - Millie, this is Inspector Callahan. - The Mayor is waiting for you. - What's up? - Another note from our boy. - Who's he grabbed now? - That's the trouble, we don't know yet. The jet must be fueled and ready to go in half an hour. Skeleton crew. They must be volunteers. Tell them the man is dangerous. I'll read you this note which was delivered at 8:00 this morning. ""To the City of San Francisco. You double-crossed me for the last time. I'm warning you to have my $200,000 in a jet airplane ready and waiting. I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00 and tell you about the hostages... ...who I will be happy to kill if you don't do... ...exactly what I say. Scorpio."" Better have somebody standing by! I don't think it's a false alarm. There's a call for you on line 2. I think it's the one you've been waiting for. - It's the Mayor. - I got 7 kids from Park Street School. I got the bus and... Come on, honey, now back in the bus. That's a good girl. I got the bus driver. Here she is. Just tell him. Not my fault, he had a gun... Just your name! This is Marcella Platt. You can check if you want. But I don't see any point. I'm not bullshitting. It's simple. I got the kids. You start screwing around... ...the kids start dying. - The plane ready? - It's being fueled, and ready to go. The money will be there by the time you get there. Listen carefully. I will drive along nice and easy. Just me and a busload of kids. I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake on my way to Santa Rosa Airport. I don't want any police cars... ...helicopters, whatever. If you play this game by the rules, the kids will have a nice plane ride. Where are you going? I'll tell the pilot when I get on. No alerts. I guarantee you, you will not be molested in any way. I give you my word of honor. Marcella Platt. It checks. Willing to take the money to him? When will you stop messing around with this guy? He has to be stopped now! He's got a busload of kids and I can't take that chance. I gave my word of honor and he will not be molested! And that's a direct order! You can just get yourself another delivery boy. Where are we going? - This isn't the right way! - We're going to the ice cream factory. Anyone doesn't want to, can get off. I want to go home to my mother. Go home to your what? Now, sing! Sing again! What's the matter? Don't you sing? Are you sick? What is it? Sing or your mothers will die! I'll kill your mothers! And the rest of you! Get in the right-hand lane. Not right to treat children that way. - You'll hurt them. - Just drive the goddamn bus! And get in the right-hand lane! I want my mother. The sign, Sir Drake Blvd. Make a right there. There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard! Not this one. I want my mother. Shut up! Just get to the right! Jesus! What the hell is he doing up there? What the hell are you doing? Pass the V.W., will you? Drop the gun, creep! I'll blow his brains out. Drop the fucking gun! I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, did he fire 6 shots, or only 5? To tell you the truth, I forgot myself, in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world... ...and will blow your head clean off... ...you've got to ask yourself: ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well, do you, punk?

How ya doin'? Tod Engels. How are ya? - This your rig, son? - Yeah. Open it up. Let's see the manifest. Well, placin' you under arrest for transportin' alcoholic beverages across state lines without the proper permits. And that means you, you dumb cowboy. You know truckin' Coors beer east of Texas is bootleggin'. - This here's Georgia, son. - Just a friendly bet. These two old boys put me up to it. Now, when ya gonna learn? Big and Little Enos Burdette make that same bet with every gearjammer they can. I say he ain't gonna go for your game. Son, from what I've heard, the biggest thing about the Bandit is his ego, and I figure that, plus a lot of my dollars, and he'll try anything, legal or not. They've put on quite a show for us today, haven't they, friends? Yes, sir, you have seen some of the finest gearjammin' in all of this country. Remember, these are the boys that take the long hauls. They really did it today. - Hoss... Where might I find the Bandit? - I ain't seen him. - Over there behind his rig. - Who wants to see him? - Who's askin'? - I'm askin'. 'Cause I'm the guy payin' him $25 a day so all his loyal fans can look at him. Do it. I'm buyin' your attraction for a half an hour. Egotistical son of a bitch. A guy that paints his truck like this would go to a minister's funeral dressed in feathers. See, son? Old legends never die. They just lose weight. Seems like a legend and an out-of-work bum look a lot alike, Daddy. Bandit, me and my son are here. Oh, I love your suits. It must be a bitch gettin' a size 68 extra-fat and a 12 dwarf. I came to make a deal. What's he get if he wins this truck rodeo thing? - If?! - $5,000, Daddy. - Chicken-shit money. - Just what the hell you want, anyway? You to get out of this dumb-ass rodeo and accept a real challenge. Gettin' to Texarkana and back in 28 hours, that's no problem. - It ain't never been done before, hotshit. - Watch your language, little lady. The problem is that Coors beer. You take that east of Texas and that's, uh... that's bootleggin'. I believe you're just a little bit scared. Great psychology. Why don't you say somethin' bad about my mother? - Your mama is so ugly... - Look, you make this run for me. These Peterbilts are worth $80,000. That comes to about three grand an hour if you make it in 28 hours. How about that for a challenge? - Dad, I don't believe that that's necess... - Never mind. Wait a minute. Why do you want that beer so bad? Because he's thirsty, dummy. You see, I got a boy runnin' tomorrow in the Southern Classic. When he wins, I wanna celebrate in style. - How much style? - Well, I got a few friends and me. 400 cases. - 400 cases...? - Well? - Well, let me see your cash. - Big Enos's word is gold. All right, show him the cash. - Go ahead, Little. - Shit. Let's see. There's 400 cases of beer, I'll need the cash for that. No problem. Go ahead, boy. New car. Gotta have a new car to block for the truck. - OK. Go ahead, boy. - I'd like to kick his ass just once. Speedy car. Speedier than that. Go ahead. - Hello, darlin'. - Hi, Uncle Bandit. - Which one of the house apes are you? - Kate. He's droppin' 'em like flies, isn't he? Well, well, well. Hello, beautiful. - How about 'gorgeous'? - You can't have him. Obviously you can. What are you tryin' to do, start another race? Look, you got Cledus in jail once. Leave us alone! - Hi, Uncle Bandit! - He ain't your damn uncle! I always recognise you! You know why? You always kick me in the balls! Damn it, Bandit! Look at me! I find it hard to look at you, Waynette, especially with those things in your hair. Makes me think you're listening to a radio station in Savannah. You can't go in there and bother Cledus. Hey! This is my home! - Cledus. - No! I know in the past I may have done you wrong. - Right? - Right. However, in the future, Cledus, I will never, ever do you wrong again. - Right? - Right. We have a big chance, a big chance to make a run for some big bucks. - 80,000 of them. - Really? - Are we gonna kidnap the Pope or somethin'? - How'd you guess? No. We're just gonna run over to Texarkana and pick up 400 cases of Coors and bring it back in 28 hours. Whoa! I got a flash for you. That's called bootleggin', and that's against the law. Who gives a turkey when the Snowman and the Bandit are runnin' the booze? - No one can stop us. - Hold it right there. There ain't gonna be no more Snowman and Bandit. Because I've got to go in the morning to Conyers and pick up a load of manure. - Shitty job. - Can I ask you a question? Sure. Ask me. What the hell do we wanna go to Texas for and haul beer back here? For the good old American life. For the money, for the glory and for the fun. Mostly for the money. You know what we're gonna do with the money? - What? - We're gonna buy a new rig. - You're crazy, you know that. - Yeah. - How much money did you say it was? - Hm. - Waynette! Now, Bo, I'm tellin' ya, Fred here ain't gonna be no problem. - I can see he'll be a major asset. - Besides, he's one hellacious watchdog. - Well, let's get goin'. - Whoa. Hold it a minute. I got to ask you a question. Sit right there, Fred. You mean to tell me we're gonna drive from here to Texarkana, Texas, and back to here in 28 hours? It's only 900 miles there and 900 miles back. Well, for your information, that ain't never been done, not in no rig. 'Cause you and I never done it in no rig. You gotta stop thinkin' so negative. 'Course we can make it. We ain't never not made it yet, have we? - Well, no. - You see? There you are. Yeah. Yeah, I see. I see all right. I see our asses in a sling if we get caught, that's what I see. Hey! Ho-ho-ho! Well, God Almighty, would you look at that! - It's beautiful, huh? - Honey, hush. I don't guess we're gonna be ridin' in the truck together this time? No, son. I'll be drivin' this one and blockin'. You'll be drivin' the truck. This is Bandit One and that is... ...Bandit Two. Together again. - Like Fred and Ginger and Lester and Earl. - That's right. But we got a problem. You know them Smokeys got them CBs in the car now. I haven't worked that out yet, but I'm thinkin' about it. I got an idea. Why don't we do this? If I say go to channel 21, forget it. We ain't goin' to 21, we're goin' to 19. - 21 is 19? - If I say go to channel six, forget it. - We go to three. - I go to three. Perfect. - If I say go to channel two, we go to one. - Two is one. - That'll confuse everybody. - That'll confuse 'em. On the other hand, if we stayed on the odd channels, switched every time and started in the basement, that'd work, too. - That'd do it, too, wouldn't it? - Well, yeah, that'd work too, I guess. - Let's haul ass. - OK. Breaker One. This is the Bandit. Is the Snowman out there? - Am I hittin'ya, son? - Mercy sakes. You put about eight and a half on me, blowin' my windows out. Bring it on. I'll be within earshot. You keep it wound up to around 90. - Hey, Bandit. Me and Fred's got a question. - What do you and Fred want? How come we're doing this? They said it couldn't be done. - That's the reason. - That's good with Fred! # Westbound and down 18 wheels a-rollin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm westbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes # Let it all hang out 'cause we got a run to make # The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarkana # And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes # Westbound and down 18 wheels a-rollin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm westbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # Old Smokey's got them ears on # He's hot on your trail # And he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail # So you've got to dodge him you've got to duck him # You've got to keep that diesel truckin' # Just put that hammer down and give it hell Well, hello there, Smokey. # Westbound and down 18 wheels a-rollin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm westbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes # Let it all hang out 'cause we got a run to make # The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarkana # And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes # Westbound and down 18 wheels a-rollin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm westbound Just watch ol' Bandit run Fred, I hope me and you ain't lettin' Bandit talk us into somethin' we gonna be sorry for, son, 'cause he's about as crazy as you are ugly. # Westbound and down 18 wheels a-rollin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm westbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # - Big town, ain't it? - I wonder what they do for excitement.

Hey, want a beer? - Well, son! - Redneck heaven. - How we gonna load all this stuff, though? - I'll load it with this. - You can't drive no forklift. - I can drive any forkin' thing around. - Get serious! Can you drive this thing? - I am serious. - Crank it up. Now back it up. - Oh, shut up! - I said back it up, not raise it up! - I am backin' up, ya big dumbbell! Hold it! The beer! Watch the beer! - You all right? - Very funny Very funny I thought it was funny. Hey, we really oughta pay somebody for that mess we made in there. - All right, have you... - I got that all worked out. You just leave a note. Tell the folks to send the bill to Big Enos Burdette. ""Send... bill... to... Big... Enos... Burdette. "" Burdette. B... B- e-r... B-u-r... B... Hell, I got to go. Hey, Spiderman, are you out there? Come back. Snowman! How we doin', son? Come on back. Hang on just a minute, and I'll tell ya. We're about 28 minutes ahead of schedule. - Come back. - I hate to say I told you so. Don't lose your head, son. We still got a lot of boogiein' to do. Put the pedal to the metal. I'm 10-10 on the side. For sure. Me and Fred, we got your back door, ain't we, Fred? - Sorry. I don't want to get married. - Terrific. That makes two of us. - Will you unzip me? - Sure. - Does this thing move? - Oh, yeah. Where are we going? No, don't tell me. Let me guess. - We are a bride in search of a wedding. - No. There is a wedding in search of a bride. Let me put it another way. Think of it as a wedding posse in search of a bride. - You understand that, cowboy? - Yeah. What are ya doin'? - These are my shoes. - Oh, yeah. - And these are my legs. - Yeah. - What are you gonna do with them? - With the shoes or the legs? Last time I saw legs like that, they had a message tied to 'em. What do you mean? These are great little legs. I'm a professional. Well, in that case, you shouldn't be dressed in white. - Dancer. - Oh. Well, cowboys love fat calves. - They're not fat. - They're bigger than mine. - Do we really wanna talk about legs? - One of us does. Otherwise we wouldn't have gone... What are we doing now? Well, I am getting my clothes, you fool. Good idea. Why don't you slip into somethin' comfortable? Are we really going 110? We're going 110! Why do you wear that cowboy hat? Because you think it looks dazzling on you. I'd no idea this dress would be so hard to get out of. Hold up on that car wash, gentlemen. Come here, son. Whoops! You look tired, boy. Rest yourself. You punks look tuckered out, too. That's an attention-getter. - Now, a lady in a weddin' gown. - Yes, sir. - Get in a car? - Yes, sir. - See who was drivin'? - N-no, sir. - Licence plate? - Y-yes, sir. Georgia plates. ""Ban-one. "" B- A-N dash O-N-E. All right. Now, you boys just stay here and watch the car. There might be some vandals around who wanna steal somethin', so you boys just stay here and keep your hands on the car until one of my associates arrive. And don't go home, don't go to eat, and don't play with yourself. It wouldn't look nice on my highway. Oh, you can think about it, but don't do it. Hey, man, he's gone. Let's get outta here. Shit! You do what you want. I'm stayin' right here. 28 years old and... Oh, goodness, what's this? I'll tuck it right in. I was down here dancing in a home appliance show. - I danced around three trash mashers. - Talk to me, my boy. I had this costume that lit up. I only short-circuited once. - Where did you get that seat cover, son? - This ain't no seat cover. - I was standing in the parking lot... - I'm sitting next to Lawrence of Arabia. I met this guy... These can't be my pants. God, he was good-looking. - And he had this hat on... - Funny, ain't she? I think he was from Texas or something, and I thought, ""Why not marry the guy?"" Nobody walks out on a pretty weddin' I set up. I'm gonna get that girl and set everything straight. She insulted my town. She insulted my son. - Look, what if we... - Shut up! She insulted my authority. And that's nothin' but pure and simple old-fashioned Communism. It happens every time one of those dancers starts poontangin' around... with those show-folk fags. Halfway down the aisle I said to myself, ""Jesus Christ, what are you doing? His mother doesn't even have any teeth!"" I jumped in this car, and it blew up on the side of the road, and I ended up in this goddamn airplane. What do you do? I don't remember. - Oh, are we on the air? - Sort of, yeah. You think I'm... nuts, don't you? No, I don't think you're crazy. I picked up three brides yesterday, just like you, very subdued. Hey, what... what's goin' on up there? - Come back, Bandit. - Bandit? - Is that your name or your profession? - That's my handle. Bo's my real name. - What's your name? - Carrie. Is she wearing a wedding dress? She was. What's she wearin' now? Come back. Hey, you got peanut butter or somethin' in your ears? Tell me what that woman's got on... her mind! No coozie's gonna leave me at no church. Decoratin' up a whole town at a cost of $40. Right. I can see her now, runnin' back up that aisle... No, she was dancin' back up the aisle, her knockers bouncin' all over the joint. Let go of that wheel. Why, her ass was wigglin', too. Why so fast? You're late for a big bowling date? Cute. - So, tell me about yourself. - What do you wanna know, my sign? - What do you do besides drive fast? - Have fun. - Is this fun? - Drivin'? - Driving, talking to me. - They're both a challenge. - You've got a great profile. - Yeah, don't I? Especially from the side. At least we finally agree on something. Yeah. We both like half my face. Hey, would a cop taking a leak on the side of the road interest you? Yes, it would. - He's taking a 10-100. - At least it's better than a 10-200. - Smokey. - Smokey. - Is this fun? - I forgot to tell ya: I'm runnin' blocker for 400 cases of illegal Coors. Holy shit! I don't believe this. Funny, I don't remember that turn. - Bandit, where the hell are you? - I'll be back on the highway in a second. All right, good buddy. I'll keep my eyes peeled. - Them things are fabulous. - I think I just went 10-100. - Well, it's better than 10-200. - That's true. # Well, the more wheels I got the better I like it. # I'm the brother of a truck-driving mother boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity. # - Snowman, you got your ears on? - You lucky devil, you got him. - Where the hell are you? - I'm on a two-lane blacktop. Highway marker number 71. How's our time doin'? Oh, how are we doin' on time? About 25 minutes ahead of schedule. - What's your 20? - I'm about four miles ahead of you, turkey. Not for long. - Breaker to the Bandit. - Come on back, breaker. Bandit, I've got a smokey report for you. Come on. - Well, talk to me, good buddy. - You've got trouble comin'. Well, what's your handle, son, and, uh, what's your 20? My handle's Smokey Bear, and I'm tail-grabbin'your ass right now. Goddamn. That's a Texas mountie. What the hell's he doin' in Arkansas? Well, let's just see what he's got under the hood. Bye-bye, baby! You smoke much? I just started. - Cledus, you got your ears on, son? - Oh, bring it on, you lucky devil. - Comin' around you. - Be careful. You're gonna have to make your own lane, 'cause you definitely got oncoming traffic. Be careful. Be careful. Oh, my... Oh, my God! I'm about to be killed in this... in this moving CB radio show, and I... I don't even have a handle! You want a handle? OK, I'll think one up for ya. Let's see. - Oh, I got one for ya! - What? Just give me a minute here. He done good, didn't he, Fred? What? Frog. - Why? - 'Cause you're always hoppin' around. And you're kinda cute like a frog, and... I'd like to jump ya. Nobody... Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice look like a possum's pecker. - Except for that... - Shut your ass. - Break for that, Bandit One. - Yeah, Snowman, come on back. That was a Texas bubblegum machine on your back door. - A Texas bubblegum machine? - Yeah, I saw him. You ain't gonna believe this, but that crazy sombitch tried to drive up under my truck. What's a Texas county mountie doing in Arkansas? - I don't know. - I don't know. I don't know! - Well, who the hell knows? - I really don't know. What we're dealin' with here is a complete lack of respect for the law. This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice. I'm in pursuit of a black TransAm. He's all mine, so stay outta the way. This is Sheriff George Branford of Deeson County, Arkansas. We are apprised of the situation and are taking appropriate measures. Did you say you are a sheriff? That's a big 10-4! This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice of Texas! Texas? You know, of course, that you're out of your jurisdiction. I suggest that you let my department handle the situation. That's very comfortin', but I'm in a high-speed pursuit. - Don't you hear good? - I hear perfectly. The fact that you are a sheriff is not germane to the situation. The goddamn Germans got nothin' to do with it! - What? - Shut up! One shit at a time! - What do ya see? - We lost him. This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice again. I lost that TransAm. Set up a roadblock. - Good idea! - What the hell you know? I believe we have the situation well under control, Sheriff. Breaker, breaker, lookin' for the Bandit. - You out there, son? - You got the Bandit. Come on back. My handle's Silver-Tongued Devil. Your fellow CBers are mighty proud of ya out there. Thank ya, son. I appreciate it. Tell me, you comin' up on Fayetteville and Interstate 82? - We're almost on top of it. - I got a big bad bear story for you there. I just rolled past a county mountie roadblock. - You ARE a silver-tongued devil. - That's a big 10-4, good buddy. Well, you keep your wheels spinnin' and the beavers grinnin', then. I'm out. Why, thank you, Officer. - Classy guy. - Classy guy. Did you see that? They went right through our roadblock. You sombitches couldn't close an umbrella. You know somethin', Sheriff? If J.W. Don't get out of my way, I'll pass him. Where? In the woods? I don't care if your daddy is the mayor. You wreck this car, it'll come outta your pay. - Yeah, but he's gettin' away. - Son, he's not goin' anywhere. The Mulberry Bridge has been dismantled for the past six months. That's not good. It would be better with a whole bridge. And that's worse. - Why don't you drop me off? I'll catch a cab. - Too late now. We did it! We did it! See? I didn't wreck it, Sheriff. We jumped over that bridge! - Did you see what we did? - Yes, I did. I wanna jump something else! I wanna jump a house! I wanna jump something! Well, jump me. - Honest to God, it wasn't my fault! I stopped! - Yeah, right. Hey, boy, where's Sheriff Branford? I am Sheriff Branford. Oh, hey... For some reason or another, you sounded a little taller on radio. What the hell is the world comin' to? Sounds good to me, Tower of Power. Listen, buddy... - What channel we on? - What? - What channel are we on? Snowman, are you out there? I'm doin' what I'm supposed to be doin'. What are y'all doing, he'n' and she'n'? - Come back. - Oh, we were playin' a little bridge. - How we been doin'? - We're losin' minutes, son. If you don't get up here and run me some interference, we ain't never gonna make it. I'll drop the dolly off at a choke-and-puke, and then I'll get right back on the job. All right. 10-4 on that choke-and-puke. - Oh, by the way, Bandit... - Yeah, guy? How 'bout bringin' me a hamburger for Fred? I'm beginnin' to worry about him. - He's lookin' a little thin in the skin. - You got 'em. - Choke-and-puke. - Choke-and-puke. - That's where I'll get off? - Right. You oughta give up smokin'. That's bad for your health. But I enjoy it so much. I guess you can get your ticket over there. - You got enough money? - Yeah. I have enough to get to Jersey, walk the rest of the way. - Hey, thanks. - Oh, it was nothing. - I'll see you around. - Yeah. Frog? You gonna be all right? Yeah... I'm always all right. Can I have a couple of cheeseburgers to go and a glass of iced tea? How much I owe ya, ma'am? - A dollar and a half. - Keep the change. Just keep your eye out for that Mr Bandit bastard! Let me have a diablo sandwich, a Dr Pepper. Make it fast. I'm in a goddamn hurry. - You want somethin'? - A hush puppy, Daddy. We got no time for that crap! Dumb sombitch! - Diablo and Doc. - Thank you, nice lady. - You must be in a hell of a hurry, Sheriff? - You bet your ass on that, boy. Oh, you got a little mess there. Let me help you get that off there... - Yeah, yeah. Much obliged. - Yeah. Who ya chasin'? Somebody chasin' you? Nobody chasin' me, boy. I been chasin' a goddamn maniac all the way from Texarkana, Texas. Really? What is he, a bank robber? Bank robber? Bank robbin' is baby shit alongside of what this dude is doin'. Almost killed 20 law officers. Drivin' through people's backyards, knockin' down mailboxes. He's got a broad in the car, took her across the state line. That's the Mann Act. I don't think he's got her permission, and that's kidnapping. - How's that for high jinks? - Yeah. - What I owe? - Oh, let me pay for it. - You're an officer of the law. I'd be honoured. - Much obliged. - Where's the can? I gotta take a squirt. - Right back there. Just used it. Hey! Hey! What are you doin' in my car? - You're goin' the wrong way! - Oh. - Hang on! - What the hell are ya doin'? - Sheriff Justice is in there! - I know! I know! - Thank you, nice lady. - Sure thing. Yoo-hoo! Sheriff! Oh, boy. Nice ass. I didn't want to be dumped at any old truck stop. - I wanted to stay with you. - Well, why didn't you ask? You might've said no, and I have a hard time handling rejections. We're gainin' on 'em. I think it'd be a good idea if we changed places, don't you? You be a passenger for a while now. Up, up... I'll just slide right... - Oh, you got my hair. - Sorry. I'll slide right under. - Ooh, I don't know. Wait. Wait. Wait! - I got it. I got it! - Wait a minute! - Wait a minute! Hold it! I'm stuck here. This is not workin'. - I got my foot on the... - Goddamn it! I seen it in the movies! Oh, my God! Duck, or you're gonna be talkin' outta your ass! - Daddy, the top came off. - No shit Snowman! How are your vocal cords? Well, my vocal cords are fine. I'm a little worried about Fred now. He's been gnawing everything, barkin' and screamin'. He's turned into a stalk of bananas. - What's your 20? - About 16 miles this side of Mississippi. Whoa, hold it. I just passed another Kojak with a Kodak. This place is crawlin' with bears. Where the hell are you? Come back. I'm still tryin' to get rid of that Texas County mountie. I don't know what the hell he wants. You know what he wants. How would you like to be the dude that handcuffs a legend? Give me five minutes, we'll put some moves on that mother. I'll meet ya at Old Miss. You'd better hurry, or we can just kiss that money goodbye. Understand? I read you loud and clear. 10-4. You got the one Snowman. I'm eastbound and down. We gone, killer. That's the way I wanna go out. Hey, man, watch it! - What the hell was that? - A left, or half a 'u'. Well, please don't do it anymore. Hey, you know who that was? Check this out. Bandit, this here's the Grave Robber. Put the pedal to the metal, and we'll hold this county mountie as long as we can. - Well, go, girl, go! - I'm goin'! I'm goin'! I've got the metal to the pedal, and the thing to the floor... Damn, he had a lot of friends, didn't he? If they had cremated the son of a bitch, I could've been kickin' that Mr Bandit's ass around the moon by now. Hold my hat! - My hat blew off, Daddy. - I hope your goddamn head was in it. - OK. We're gonna switch. - OK. I'm comin' over underneath you. You just slide right on over. I think I'm in love with your belt buckle. Close. Colourful, but close. I like this seat better anyway. Yes, have a smoke. It seems to help. Come on, defence! Come on, Billy Ray, get tough! You know, I wanted to be a high-fashion model once. But, hell, how long can you model clothes for 8-year-olds? Boys. Besides that, my cheeks were too fat. These cheeks, these. Aarghhh! - Oh, my goodness, we're airborne here. - Jesus Christ! - Oh, look, a football game! - There's kids! For Christ's sake, watch out! - Don't hit the kids! - Get your hands off my wheel! Lean to the left, lean to the right... Stand up there and see if you can see where the hell they went. - Can you see anything? - It's a football game. Can we watch, Daddy? - You stay and watch. I'm goin' back! - But, Daddy... # Bandit, you're reckless and you live much too hard # Oughta be in Nashville. Snowman, are ya out there, son? What's your 20? Where are you? I'm at mile marker 85. Come back. Son-of-a-gun! So am I! Well, damned if ya ain't. Damned if ya ain't. Cledus... This is Frog. Hello, Frog. I want you to meet Fred, Frog. - This is for Fred. - Frog, feed Fred. What's wrong with you? You were gonna dump the chick at the truck stop. - I ran into complications. - You always run into complications. Always the same, some chick. We ain't doin' good time. - What are we yappin' for? - It's the chick. - Switch down to the next channel, right? - Yeah. Hey, Bandit? Nice ass. - Thanks a lot. - Thanks a lot. All right, Fred. Come on. Let's go, boy. Come on. Fred, I'm tired of pickin' you up... Fred! - Did Cledus call you a legend? - Uh-huh. - Why? - Well, I used to do some crazy things. - I used to. - Oh. So did I. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two... I'm a gypsy... four. That's someone who goes from chorus line to chorus line... six, seven, eight. - You know, I was on Broadway once. - Really? - For almost 12 minutes. - Oh. The show closed the first night. But, God, I was so good. You shoulda seen me. You'd have loved me. What do you do? Straight. I just go from place to place and... do what I do best. - What's that? - Show off. Yeah. You do do that well. You do. So do I. Five, six, seven, eight. - For almost 12 minutes. - Oh, shut up! Come here, Fred. Come here, boy. Fred, don't you make me come after you. Get over here, Fred! Come here. I'm in a hurry, and you want to swim. You're drivin' me crazy, Fred. What is the matter with you, Fred? That's it for you and the truck drivin'! Look, I've got to go 10-100. Could I have a dime? - Crawl under. - Terrific. ""Crawl under. "" - TransAm! What's your pleasure? - Fill it up, my man. Gimme that talker. Hello? Mr Bandit? Would you just happen to be listenin' out there? Can you hear me, boy? This is the Bandit. Who've I got at that end? This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice of Texas. Well, hot damn. Welcome to Mississippi, Sheriff. Thank you, Mr Bandit. And I got a big welcome waitin' for you when I get you back home, you sombitch! Don't you cuss on this here radio. I apologise to all the friendly folk who are listenin'. Now hear this, you tick turd: I'm gonna get you. I didn't come all the way this far to go home with empty pockets. I been meanin' to ask you that. How come you're followin' me? I'd be delighted to tell you, Mr Bandit. You see, when I get you back home, I'm gonna find the tallest tree in the country, and then I'm gonna hang you from it. - Sheriff? - I'm listenin'. Do the letters F.O. Mean anything to you? Smart aleck. You keep this one for yourself. - Have a smooth ride, Mr Bandit. - Thank you, partner. Oof! Snowman, I'm right beside you. Looks like we got a clear shot all the way to the 'Bama state line. Oh, a clear shot? I'm gonna believe that when I see it. This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice puttin' out an all-point advisory. That black TransAm is now headed toward Alabama. What happened, Daddy? Get back in the goddamn car. You know who I feel has revolutionised the American musical theatre? - Stephen Sondheim. - Yeah? - Who's that? - Stephen Sondheim? - Does he do a lot of musicals and stuff? - Yeah. - He ever do anything with Brenda Lee? - Does she dance? - She spins. She's a little spinner. - Oh, they were a good group. - The Spinners were good. Yeah. - Yeah. Have you ever been in any plays? Holy shit. We got a lot of company up there. A lot of company. - Sarge, here he comes. - Yeah, I got eyes. - Are you ready, Roy? - I was born ready. Don't just stand there. Go get him! - Drives pretty good, don't he, Sarge? - We'll see about that. - Sarge, you OK? - You see me movin', don't ya? - Wanna do a little pond hopping, Frog? - Uh... Swell. Now, I know you're in a little distress here, but did you see a black TransAm go by? He caused all of this, the Bandit. Ain't he somethin'? The Bandit ain't nothin'. He's a mental case. Good shit! Banzai! I saw that, you sombitch! You did that on purpose! You're goin' away till you're grey! I got the evidence! Put the evidence in the car. - But, Daddy... - Put the evidence in the car! I'm gonna barbecue your ass in molasses! Put the evidence in the back. There's no way, no way... that you could come from my loins. When I get home, the first thing I'm gonna do is punch your mama in the mouth. I- I'll be with you in a moment, young man. Bandit, honey, this is the Good Witch of the North speakin'. You'd better not come this way. There's been a little fender bender here on 64. - Snowman, you copy that? - Yeah, I got a four on that. That'll work for me, 'cause I need to pull off, suck up a little go-go juice and put some groceries down my neck. Y'all be careful and I'll catch ya later. - One Snowman. I'm playin' on the side. - We'll be 10-10 on the side. Lady, don't you know you're supposed to signal? Oh? Really? # They call you the Bandit # An outlaw untamed # Shackled only by freedom # You wear no man's chain We got some time. You wanna stretch your legs, Frog? # Some say they despise you # Well, maybe they do # But deep down inside them # I bet they wish they were you Fill her up, hoss. Come on, Frederick. Come on, boy, my boy. Let's go get some of Lamar's greasy spoon. I'm gonna put you on a diet, Fred. Mercy. Come on, Fred. Come on, boy. Inside. Come on, boy. Lamar, surprise. Look who's here. - I knew you was comin'. - Hi, Snowman. What do you mean, you knew I was comin'? Lamar, you're rotten to the core, you know that. About as rotten as that food you've been poisonin' me with... - How many do you want? - I don't know. Fix the same thing. Just cook the onions this time. - How have you been, Sugar Bear? - Pretty good. You, Snowman? Oh, pretty good, considering the shape I'm in. Say hello to Waynette. Looks like old Fred's gettin' fat. Yeah, tell me about it. It damn sure ain't from eatin' the food at this joint. - Tell me about that. - I know it. By the way, where did you get all them warthogs back there? Damn if I know. They slid in here a little while ago. I'm gonna slide on out. Catch you later, Snowman. Yeah, why don't you just leave me? Yes, operator? This is a collect call from Cledus Snow. No, I am not Hank Snow's brother. No. Hey, sugarbabe, how you doin'? - Could I ask you something? - Sure. Do you think we have anything in common? Besides being chased around the country in that feckuckteh car? Yeah. Like what? Have you ever seen the Broadway show Chorus Line? No. You like Elton John? No. - Do you know who Casey Tibbs is? - Baseball player. - Close. Richard Petty? - No. - Waylon Jennings? No. - No. When you tell somebody somethin', it depends on what part of the United States you're standin' in... as to just how dumb you are. Mr Bandit, you have a lyrical way of cutting through the bullshit. And you have a unique way with the English language, Miss Frog. # Bandit steals a lady's heart # With only a smile - Don't you take that hat off for anything? - Sure. I take it off for one thing, and one thing only. # And you live much too hard # Bandit, you're the joker - If we were lost on a desert island together... - Yes? Do you think we'd get along and talk and... things? Sure. Yeah, we'd get along. It'd never be boring, I can tell you that. It would never be boring. Take your hat off. If you want to. # They call you the Bandit I want to. # They call you the Bandit # They call you the Bandit... # - No. Honey, we'll be home in a little while. - Hey! Is this your goddamn mutt? Honey, I got... I gotta go. Yeah, I gotta go... Bye. - Yeah, that's my dog. Yeah. - Well, he just bit me. - Fred! Come here, Fred. - I said... He just bit me. - Put the son of a bitch out of his misery. - Let's roast him. - That's not a bad idea. - Eat him. I don't think Fred bit you, mister. Fred absolutely don't like grease. Gearjammer, huh? King of the road, huh? - It's time to get out. - That's a big 10-4. How much do I owe you, Billy? - Never mind, just keep the change. Sorry what happened, Snowman. It's OK, Lamar. Far out. What the hell is this, a drive-in movie? Get off of there, you schnauzer's tit! - How do, Officer. My name's... - I don't care if it's Broderick Crawford. Don't you know you can't drive a piece of shit like that on the highway? I'll thank you not to use that kind of language in my presence. Never mind that crap. What the hell is this? - This is evidence. - Evidence? I don't care what it is. You can't drive this piece of shit on my highway. I'm tellin' you for the last time. I have my young son in the car, and I don't wanna hear that kinda language. - Look! I'm askin' you one single, goddamn... - Hold it! Hold it! Don't you ever, ever raise your voice to me! Do you know who you're talkin' to? I happen to be Buford T. Justice, a distinguished officer of over 30 years' seniority! One of the most highly respected law-enforcement agents... in the United States of America. That vehicle happens to be evidence, valuable evidence, that's going to convict a maniac that I've been tryin' to apprehend and that I have been in high-speed pursuit of for 700 miles. He is wanted for the Mann Act, kidnappin' and the attempted murder of over 20 brother officers. Sir, I'm sorry. I had no idea. It never occurred to me... Well, please, sir, you proceed immediately, and... I hope you'll accept my apologies for my profanity. Apology accepted. Now... How about you, Bandit? You copy this Snowman? Come on. I got ya, son. Come on back. You ain't gonna believe this, but I just did my imitation of Joe Palooka. I went a few rounds with some dudes at this eat-'em-up joint. Oh, I believe anything you tell me. How'd ya do, same as always? Yeah, about normal. I lost. We also lost a lot of valuable time. We gonna really have to cook. - Is that a 10-4? - That's a big 10-4. Actually, my heaviest relationship was with an acid-rock singer... named Robert Crumly. We were together... eight and a half days. God, I really thought that was it. And? One day I came home and found him in the shower... ...with a girl... and her mother! Well, at least he kept it in the family. You have a wonderful way of putting things. - So did he. - Oh, yes. Breaker one-nine. This is the Bandit. I'm lookin' for a west-bounder on highway 85. I need a smokey report, and I need it bad, son. This is Foxy Lady, Bandit. We heard you were comin' by, and we decided we'd take care of those bears for you. - You know, a little ""personalised service"". - Send me the bill, Foxy Lady. Better yet, why don't you come by and pay up in person? I'll catch you on the flip side, darlin'. I'm too pooped to pop. - Daddy, listen. - Shut up! But I'm just ahead of you. I'm at mile marker 86. Come on by, Bandit. All right, you talked me into it. Now I got that sombitch, and I got him with his fly open. - What do we do when we get home? - Go to bed. For a week. Good idea. - And sleep. - Wanna bet? Orville, you seen that new waitress at the diner, Arlene? - She's got some nice legs. - I'd like to take a run on her. - Oh, man, what are you talkin' about? - I'm tellin' ya. Let me tell you somethin' about that. She makes herself... - Feel lucky? - Let's get him. This is car four. We're in pursuit of the black TransAm. It's the Bandit. # Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm eastbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # Oh, shit. Breaker one-nine. Breaker one-nine. I see a portable gas station ahead of me. Do you copy? Is this Bandit? This is Mr B., gearjammin' this rollin' refinery. You got a smokey? This is the Bandit, son. Can we slide right into your convoy there? Come ahead, Bandit. We'll slip you into the rockin' chair, play a little hide-and-seek. The welcome mat is out, and you're comin' home. - We're going in the rocking chair, honey. - Good. Trucks, I love 'em. I love 'em. This is not a convoy. This is a dream. - They can see right down into this car! - Well, so what? That's why I used to love to drive those trucks, darlin'. Spot those beavers. - Safe as in your mother's womb, darlin'. - Is that right? # Son, never mind them brakes # Let it all hang out 'cause we got a run to make # The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarkana # And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes # Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm eastbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # Old Smokey's got them ears on he's hot on your trail # He ain't gonna rest till you're in jail # So you gotta dodge him you gotta duck him # You gotta keep that diesel truckin' # Just put that hammer down and give it hell # Thank you, Mr B. I don't know how to thank ya. You can thank me by not gettin' caught. Have a good day and a better one tomorrow, good buddy. Hey, Bandit, this is Little Beaver. Put your foot on the floor. We got your back door, and I'm clear. That's a 10-4. Snowman, you got your ears on, son? You've got him, you lucky devil. You're about to come up on a convoy. Keep your rubber band stretched real tight. I'm bringin' it, son. I'm clear. # Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm eastbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes # Let it all hang out 'cause we got a run to make # The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarkana # And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes # Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm eastbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # I don't care if you're the Governor of Texas. You're makin' a big mistake. Read him his rights, Junior. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law. And... What's all this about? Oh, hello, Officer! Glad you're here to assist me. My name is Sheriff Buford T. Justice. I have just apprehended the Bandit. No, sir. You just apprehended my captain. - Take the cuffs off, Junior. - But, Daddy, we just... Take the cuffs off, you moose twit. May I express my feelings about inconveniencing you... But if you gonna hang out in these kinda joints... wear a badge on your didie. Oh, no. Hey, Bandit. Listen to this. You know who that is? That's Mr Evel Knievel. He snuck in my back door when I wasn't lookin'. Give me a hand, or we gonna be in a heap of trouble. - Please roger that transmission. - Hold on to Fred. Here comes the cavalry. - Howdy, Officer. - How ya doin'? Give me your licence and manifest, boy. You know you was goin' 96 miles an hour? - I was doin' 96... - You're damn right, you was. I didn't know this truck could do 96. The judge gets to you, he's gonna turn you every way but loose. It's time you truckers learn these roads don't belong to you. You be careful, you hear? - Whoa. Want a little piece of advice, Bandit? - Yeah. Lay it on me, son. Don't take your foot off of that hammer. Them bears'll pour over you like maple syrup. - You all right? - Yeah. - Don't you know this ain't Saturday? - Thanks a lot. We don't need assistance. I've got him in my sights. Headquarters, disregard my last transmission. Son... you reckon you can let me off at the next exit? - Go get your daddy a beer. - OK. ...I understand every cop in the state's after him. - Stay 10-10. I'll let you know. - That's a big 10-4. Damn, he's been stirring up some trouble. Ooh, it's the Bandit! I'm Hot To Trot. Just tell me how I can help and I'm with ya, body and soul. - Channel clear. - Breaker one-nine, breaker one-nine. Is that Hot Pants Hilliard yakkin' out there? - And who wants to know? - This is the Bandit, darling. Well, where are you, you bodied-up, smooth-talkin' thing? And how can I help? Bring it back. You still workin' at that choke-and-puke on West 85? Affirmative, affirmative. I'm still dishin' it out. We'll come screamin' by in five minutes with a herd of smokeys on our ass. How 'bout gettin' those pallies of yours out there, block 'em off? Love to! But hey, you're gonna owe me one. - I owe you a big one. - That's a big 10-4. All right, gang, we're gonna go for a big smokey red 22. Wahoo! - Ride with me? - Yeah. - You sure we ain't gonna get in trouble? - Nah. I've done it before. - We're comin' at you, darlin'. Are you ready? - Ready, willin' and able. ""Ready and willing. "" Ha. She always was. OK, gang, be alert, 'cause here he comes. - Well, go ahead and answer. - 10-4, Hot Pants. We copy. Let go of the button. Paydirt. I just picked up the Bandit eastbound on 95. All units converge. I copy, Chopper One. I'm on my way. Heading for the fairgrounds! This is car 12, Bobby Lee, and I have him westbound on 75. - Cledus, where the hell are we? - Four miles to go, good buddy. - Four miles. Goddamn it! - Four miles... Bo, did you count on this? I mean, all of this? No, I didn't, honey. - Cledus? - Talk to me, my boy. Goddamn it, son, we gave it our best shot. I don't like this any more than you do, but... We ain't gonna make it, son. We're gonna hang it up. Whoa, negatory, negatory! You crazy or somethin'? We come this far, ain't we? When we say we gonna do a job, we do a job! It's me they're after. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists. Oh, they don't? Well, I'll tell you what we gonna do. We gonna introduce 'em to the boy. So move over, good buddy, 'cause the Snowman is comin' through. Hold on to your ass, Fred. Hot damn, we're gonna make it. Move them vehicles. We gotta get through! Here they come! Daddy, you're about to have your evenin' ruined for you. - OK. - All right. - We're in trouble. - I know we're in trouble. - What time is it? - One minute after. - Goddamn, we're 10 minutes early. - We're in trouble! We need a way out of here. We need the money. Here's my Cadillac. That'll leave me with an even dozen. Good luck, son. - Cledus, get the money. - How 'bout the money? - How 'bout double or nothin'? - How 'bout forgettin' it? What about double or nothin'? You run up to Boston, bring back some clam chowder. - You're on. - Uh, you're on. - In 18 hours? - You're still on. Y- y-you're crazy! And I'm divorced! And you... Ain't half bad, is it? 20 to one I break the son of a bitch this time. Gimme 500 on the Bandit. Apprehend that horse ass for reckless drivin'! - But, Daddy, he's... - Do what I tell you, you pile of monkey nuts! Sheriff Buford T. Justice, please. - Who there? - This is Bandit Darville talkin'. Where are you, you sombitch? Before I tell you where I am, Sheriff, there's just one thing I wanna say. You must be part coon dog, 'cause I been chased by the best of 'em, and son, you make 'em look like they're all runnin' in slow motion. - I just wanna say that. - Well, thank you, Mr Bandit. And as the pursuer, may I say you're the goddamnedest pursuee I ever pursued. Now that the mutual bullshit is over, where are you, you sombitch? I'm right down at the bottom of the hill. I'm six-foot-eight, in a cowboy outfit. I got a little pygmy standing beside me dressed like me. You can't miss me. 10-4. Wait a minute. Scratch that. Hold it. I can't lie to you, Sheriff. You're too good a man. Look over your left shoulder. Oof. We're on our way to Boston to get some clam chowder. Bye-bye. - No hard feelings, Junior! - I'm not givin' up! I'm never gonna give up! I'll get you, you sombitch! Daddy, wait for me! Don't leave me! Who's gonna hold your hat? # Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go And a short time to get there # I'm eastbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes # Let it all hang out 'cause we got a run to make # Those boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarkana # And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes # Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm eastbound Just watch ol' Bandit run # Old Smokey's got them ears on he's hot on your trail # He ain't gonna rest till you're in jail # So you got to dodge him you got to duck him # You've got to keep that diesel truckin' # Just put that hammer down and give it hell # Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin' # We gonna do what they say can't be done # We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there # I'm eastbound Just watch ol' Bandit run #, MAN: Ten-hut! Be seated. Now, I want you to remember... ...that no bastard ever won a war... ...by dying for his country. He won it... ...by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country. Men... ...all this stuff you've heard about America not wanting to fight... ...wanting to stay out of the war... ...is a lot of horse dung. Americans... ...traditionally love to fight. All real Americans love the sting of battle. When you were kids... ...you all admired the champion marble shooter... ...the fastest runner, big-league ball players, the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner... ...and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. Thas why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war... ...because the very thought of losing... ...is hateful to Americans. Now... ...an army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team. This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap. The bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality... ...for the Saturday Evening Post... ...don't know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating. Now we have the finest food and equipment... ...the best spirit... ...and the best men in the world. You know... ...by God, I actually pity those poor bastards we're going up against. By God, I do. We're not just going to shoot the bastards... ...we're going to cut out their living guts... ...and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun bastards by the bushel. Now... ...some of you boys... ...I know are wondering... ...whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you... ...that you will all do your duty. The Nazis... ...are the enemy. Wade into them! Spill their blood! Shoot them in the belly! When you put your hand... ...into a bunch of goo... ...that a moment before was your best friens face... ...you'll know what to do. There's another thing I want you to remember. I don't want to get any messages saying we are ""holding our position."" We're not ""holding"" anything. Let the Hun do that. We're advancing constantly. We're not interested in holding on to anything... ...except the enemy. We're going to hold on to him by the nose and kick him in the ass. We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time... ...and we're going to go through him like crap through a goose! Now... ...there's one thing... ...that you men will be able to say when you get back home. And you may thank God for it. Thirty years from now when you're sitting around your fireside... ...with your grandson on your knee... ...and he asks you: ""What did you do in the great World War II?"" You won't have to say: ""Well... ...I shovelled shit in Louisiana."" All right, now, you sons of bitches... ...you know how I feel. I will be proud... ...to lead you wonderful guys into battle anytime... ...anywhere. Thas all. The Arabs need food and clothing. They strip our dead before we can even bury them. Looks like the reports were pretty accurate. Sixty-one armored vehicles, 45 tons of ammunition... ...twenty-five 40mm guns, three self-propelled 105s. Not counting mortars, machine guns, rifles... ...pistols, telescopes, belt buckles, GI socks. One thousand, eight hundred men. Our people salute you, general... ...for your brilliant amphibious landing on the continent of Africa... ...and for your enlightened administration of our country. I've enjoyed being here, Excellency. Naturally, I'd prefer to be in Tunisia fighting the Germans. ""The lions in their dens tremble at his approach."" I appreciate that, Excellency. Magnificent! I wish our troops looked that good. Tell me, general, what do you think of Morocco? I love it, Excellency. Is a combination of the Bible and Hollywood. BRADLEY: These men fight at Kasserine? CARVER: Yes, sir. For the American Army to take a licking like that... ...the first time at bat against the Germans... Up against Rommel, what we need is the best tank man we've got. Somebody tough enough to pull this outfit together. - Patton? - Possibly. God help us. Lieutenant... ...where is the duty officer? Sir... - He said he's caught at shaving. - Why isn't he here on duty? Guess he needed a shave. We got a new commanding general due today. MAN: Who the hell is kicking me in the butt? Oh, sorry, sir. - What were you doing down there? - Trying to get some sleep, sir. Well... Get back down there, son. You're the only son of a bitch here who knows what he's trying to do. Yes, sir. PATTON: Brad, how the hell are you? - Fine, George. Good to see you. We were all under the impression you wouldn't be here until 0900. Yes, I gathered that. - You know my boy, Dick Jenson. - Yes. Brad, tell me. - What are you doing here? - Ike wanted a report on Kasserine. Meanwhile, I have to stay here as an observer... ...but I report directly to Ike. You're spying. Get me General Eisenhower's headquarters. Tell me, Brad... ...what happened at Kasserine? I heard it was a shambles. Apparently, everything went wrong. We'd send over a 75mm shell, the krauts would return an 88. Their tanks are diesels. Even when we managed to hit one they kept on running. Our tanks... The men call them ""Purple Heart boxes."" One hot piece of shrapnel and the gasoline explodes. I warned them about the tank. I talked to one of the soldiers about the half-tracks. I asked them if the machine-gun bullets pierced the armor. And he said, ""No, sir. They just come through one side and rattle around a bit."" I understand they had a little trouble coordinating the air cover. The trouble was no air cover. - General Smith on the line, sir. - Excuse me, Brad. Bedell? Listen, I'm calling about Bradley and his job here. I need a good number-two man, I want to make Brad my deputy commander. You clear it with Ike? All right, thanks, Bedell. Now you're not spying for Eisenhower anymore, you're working for me. - Okay? - Fine, okay. Dick. You got those stars? - Yes, sir. - Les get them on. Whas the matter, Brad? I've been nominated by the president. I know, but it doesn't become official until is approved by the Senate. Well... ...they have their schedule and I have mine. George... ...if you were named admiral of the Turkish Navy... ...I believe your aides could dip into their haversacks... ...and come up with the appropriate badge of rank. Anyway, congratulations. Premature congratulations. You know... I think those stars look better on a green shirt. Did I ever tell you about the time I designed a uniform for tank crewmen? It was green leather, it had red stripes... ...and sort of a row of brass buttons down across here. And topped off by a gold football helmet. The Army rejected it, of course. Goddamn, it was beautiful. Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving. George, there's one other thing I put in my Kasserine report. Some of our boys were just plain scared. Thas understandable. Even the best foxhound is gun-shy the first time out. I can remember... ...when nothing frightened me as much as the idea of... ...a bullet coming straight for my nose. I don't know why, but the image of a bullet coming right for my nose... ...was more horrible than any other possibility. Well, I can understand that, with such a handsome nose. You want to know why this outfit got the hell kicked out of it? Blind man could see it in a minute. They don't look like soldiers. They don't act like soldiers. Why should they fight like soldiers? You're absolutely right. The discipline's pretty poor. In about 15 minutes we're going to start turning these boys... ...into fanatics, razors. They'll lose their fear of the Germans. I hope to God they never lose their fear of me. Up bright and early, general? Breakfast? Have all my officers finished breakfast? We're open from 6 till 8. Most of the officers are just coming in, sir. Please inform these officers the mess hall is closed. But, sir! Is only a quarter to 8. From now on, you will open at 6 and no one will be admitted after 6: 15. Where are your leggings? Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir, I'm a cook. You're a soldier. $20 fine. Gentlemen... ...from this moment any man... ...without leggings, without a helmet, without a tie... Any man with unshined shoes or soiled uniform... ...is going to be skinned. This is a barracks. Is not a bordello. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. Doctor. Sir. I understand you have two cases of self-inflicted wounds. Yes, sir, we do. Get them out of here. One has developed a serious infection. I don't care if he dies, just get him out of here. Doesn't belong in the same room with men wounded in battle. - I'll see that they're moved. - One more thing. There'll be no ""battle fatigue."" Thas an order. Battle fatigue is a free ride to the hospital. I'm not going to subsidize cowardice. Yes, sir. Doctor... Where's your helmet? I don't wear a helmet in the hospital. Start. I can't use my stethoscope when I'm wearing my helmet. Well... ...then cut two holes in your helmet so that you can. And get those yellow-bellies out of here, today. Hold it. Turn right, here. The battlefield is ahead. Don't argue. I can smell a battlefield. He was out here yesterday. Is over there. Turn right, damn it. It was here. The battlefield was here. The Carthaginians defending the city... ...were attacked by three Roman legions. They were brave, but they couldn't hold. They were massacred. Arab women... ...stripped them of their tunics and their swords and lances. The soldiers lay naked in the sun... ...2000 years ago. I was here. You don't believe me. You know what the poet said: ""Through the travail of ages Is the pomp and toils of war Have I fought and strove and perished Countless times upon the star As if through a glass and darkly The age-old strife I see Where I fought in many guises Many names But always me."" You know who the poet was? Me. There's an opportunity for us to mount an offensive. We've concentrated on the flank... ...draw strength from the British. It appears now that we could... ...split the African corridor. Drive through Rommel to the sea. I'm sorry, but that territory has been reserved... ...for General Bernard Law Montgomery. We're supposed to let him win this one no matter what. They're entitled to have their hero. Montgomery did push Rommel clear across North Africa. What about the Americans? Don't they need a hero too? You have anybody in mind? Air Vice-Marshal Coningham is here with General Buford. Excuse me, gentlemen... ...while I ask our British friends whas happened to our air cover. BRADLEY: Harry. How are you? George. Good to see you. - You know Arthur Coningham. - Sir Arthur. Delighted to see you. I've heard so much about you. Gentlemen, it appears there's been a slight misunderstanding here... ...and Ike thought we should fix it. No, no. No misunderstanding. We're supposed to have Allied air cover and we don't. German planes are strafing my troops. If I may say so, general, I'm afraid your operation reports are inaccurate. Report? Three days ago, the crowds took off after my command car... ...ran my ass into a ditch. My staff has assured me, we have complete air supremacy... ...everywhere in the Mediterranean. PATTON: When I complained about air cover... ...you said our troops were not battleworthy. You spoke of the discredited practice of using air force as an alibi... ...for lack of success on the ground. I have to wet-nurse Montgomery, I don't have to stand for that. I sincerely apologize for that remark, whoever made it. And I promise you one thing, general: You will see no more German planes. We were discussing air supremacy, Sir Arthur. Damn door won't open! By God, thas enough! Get that thing out of here! Come on, you bastards, take a shot at me on the nose! Get back in here, George! We need a corps commander, not a casualty. CONINGHAM: How'd you manage to stage that? I don't know... ...but if I could find the Nazis flying those things... ...I'd give them each a medal. PATTON: Can't get over how cold it gets in the desert. Awfully cold, sir. PATTON: Rommel's out there somewhere, waiting for me. JENSON: Yes, sir. PATTON: You know... ...if I had my way, I'd send that genius son of a bitch... ...an engraved invitation in iambic pentameter: A challenge in two stanzas to meet me alone in the desert. I'll deliver it. Rommel in his tank and me in mine. We'd stop about 20 paces. We'd get out, we'd shake hands... ...then we'd button up and do battle, just the two of us. That battle would decide the outcome of the war. Is too bad jousting's gone out of style. Is like your poetry, general. It isn't part of the 20th century. You're right, Dick. The world grew up. Hell of a shame. Dick, I want a 24-hour guard put around this area. If we don't, the Arabs will dig them up for their clothes. Yes, sir. Our graves aren't gonna disappear like everybody else's who fought here. The Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians. God, how I hate the 20th century. General. General? We intercepted a German radio message. Rommel's 10th Panzer is going to hit us near El Guettar. Rommel, huh? All my life... ...I've wanted to lead a lot of men in a desperate battle. Now I'm going to do it. Look. Battalion strength at least. They haven't spotted our positions yet. They'll get an education in about 10 seconds. Wait till they get a dose of that artillery fire. Commence firing. Fire at will. Commence firing. Fire at will. Commence firing. Fire at will. What a hell of a waste of fine infantry. - Get General Bradley on the radio. - Yes, sir. Sir, I can't raise him. Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's where we hold them by the nose... ...and kick them in the ass. Go on. Put him in my car. Rommel... ...you magnificent bastard. I read your book! PATTON: Captain Richard N. Jenson was a fine boy. Loyal, unselfish and efficient. I am terribly sorry. There are no coffins here since there is no wood. We will have a trumpeter and an honor guard... ...but we will not fire the volleys as people would think an air raid was on. I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair in a letter to his mother. He was a fine man... ...and a fine officer. And he had no vices. I shall miss him a lot. I can 't see the reason such fine young men get killed. There are so many battles yet to fight. NARRATOR: Battle-weary, but victorious, American Gls and Tommies... ...of the British 8th Army meet in an Allied victory celebration... ...at Wadi Akarit in North Africa. For the first time in this war, Broadway and Piccadillyjoin hands. Meanwhile, General Montgomery, hero of El Alamein... ...continues to lead his victorious British 8th Army... ...in a relentless drive against Rommel's vaunted Africa corps. General Bradley's done a tremendous job with 2nd Corps. He's moved into Bizerte and taken over 41,000 prisoners. Good. Very good. You're not surprised, are you? After all, you trained that outfit. - Excuse me, general. - Hm? This is interesting. We've discovered Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar. - Who says so? - G2, sir. When we took 10th Panzer, Rommel was in Berlin with an earache? Severe nasal diphtheria, sir. Also, Hitler probably retained Rommel in Berlin... ...because things were going badly for the Africa Corps. He didn't want his favorite general to lose face. I'm my favorite general, and I don't like to be told... ...that some second-stringer is up against me. Then I lose face. Who the hell are you, anyway? CARVER: General, this is Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Your new aide. Codman. I pulled your name off the list because I know your family. I'm glad you did, sir. Rommel is the best the krauts have, and I kicked the hell out of him. Now my own G2 section is telling me he wasn't even there. But, general, he undoubtedly planned the German battle. If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel. Isn't that true? Codman... - Have a drink with me tonight. - Yes, sir. I have a plan for the invasion of Sicily. I want to make sure I get it approved. You can help me. I want to give a dinner for General Alexander. Get to him before Montgomery does. This will be strictly a formal affair, Codman, but purely social. By that I mean... ...purely political. - Yes, sir. I want the finest food, the best wine available. Everything, comme il faut. Thank you. George, this is really splendid wine. Thank you, Arthur. Thank you. Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades in the Peloponnesian War... ...415 B.C. He said, ""If Syracuse falls, all Sicily falls, and then Italy."" He knew that Syracuse was the jugular of the island. Old Alcibiades always went for the throat. I propose to take Sicily in the same way. - How's it going? - The old man has them in his pocket. PATTON: Now, according to my plan... ...General Montgomery will land here. I'll hit the beaches here, take Palermo. Monty will drive north on the coast, I'll come due east... ...take Messina and cut off the German escape route. Yes... It looks like an interesting plan. Well, gentlemen, to the conquest of Sicily. ALEXANDER: To the conquest of Sicily. OFFICERS: To Sicily! George, you'd have made a great marshal for Napoleon... ...if you'd lived in the 18th century. But I did, sir. I did. Morning. Is General Smith in? MAN: I believe he's in the lavatory. - Thank you. - Ah, there you are, Bedell. - Monty. Bedell, I've been giving a good bit of thought to the Sicily operation. Yes? I assume we're alone. Georgie Patton has already discussed his plan with Alexander. I realize that... ...but I have an idea that his plan may lead to an absolute disaster. Oh? Bedell, look. This is Sicily. Now then, according to Patton's plan... ...I will attack Syracuse here. And he would attack Palermo up here. Now, obviously our forces would be divided. And obviously, they could be chopped up piecemeal. Now then, what I propose, and what I shall insist on, by the way... ...is this. I will land at Syracuse as planned. But the Americans- The Americans will land here, at Gela. I will advance north to Messina, the Americans protecting my flank. After all, Messina is the key. Is the reason for invading Sicily. I'll discuss your plan with Ike. I'm sure he'll give it serious consideration. - Amusing, isn't it? - What? That the plans for the invasion of Sicily... ...should have been put forward in an Algerian lavatory. George, I have bad news for you about your Sicily plan. Ike has turned it down. Since the Italians will be defending their native soil for the first time... ...and the German resistance is stiffening, we shouldn't be divided. - Well, where do my people land then? - In the Gulf of Gela. There's nothing there but a beach. Yes, but it puts you in a good position to support Montgomery. Where does Montgomery land? He'll land in Syracuse and drive north to Catania. Possibly even Messina. And you'll be alongside, protecting his left. I see. In other words, we get the burden again while good old Monty gets the glory. Ike had to consider all points of view. He made his decision not as an American, but as an Ally. Had it been the other way around, I assure you, Monty would protest. No... ...I've been in the Army 30 years. When I get an order, I say, ""Yes, sir."" And I do my best to carry it out. This is what happens when your commander stops being an American... ...and starts being an Ally. I don't think I've made myself clear, sir. Is true, Montgomery met the toughest resistance there at Catania. However, if we're- Perfectly clear. Old Monty is as stuck as a bug on flypaper. But this order from General Alexander... ...directing you to turn over the Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery. Well, then, old Bradley will have to slug- slug, mind you... ...his way up center of the island over those tough mountain roads, won't he? Yes, sir. Messina, Bell. Messina... ...is the heart of it. If they'd followed my plan, I'd be there by now. I'd cut off the retreat of every German on this island! Now, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to Palermo. I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina if is the last thing I ever do! Hey, whas all this talk about taking the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps? General Alexander's orders. Road goes to Montgomery. Now, that road was assigned to me. How can I get north without it? You know the terrain there. I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run into tough opposition. Very tough. You wouldn't be taking advantage of this situation, would you? I don't know what you're talking about. Without that road, your army, except for my 2nd Corps... ...would be out of a job. Free for you to go into Palermo. Who said anything about Palermo? I can read a map. Does Alexander know you've pushed out this far? Thas a reconnaissance in force. George... ...are you saying I've got to slug it out in those mountains... ...with heavy resistance? Just so you can make a bigger splash than Monty? General... ...I just follow my orders. Like the simple old soldier I am. General Bradley. Sir, General Alexander has heard we're moving west. He says here, ""Stop immediately. Go no farther than Agrigento. Repeat. Stop, immediately."" Thas what you think it says. I think it was garbled in transmission. Ask them to re-transmit the message. Thall take half a day at least. Yes, sir. Now, Brad. Where were we? We were talking about a simple... ...old soldier. Look at that, gentlemen. Compared to war... ...all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance. Les go, sergeant. Move out! Give me that helmet. Come on, les get out of here! What silly son of a bitch is in charge of this operation? I don't know, but they ought to hang him. PATTON: Afternoon, Padre. PADRE: These men are here from the States, looking over our program... ...for the spiritual welfare of the men. We'll take you right into Palermo. Col. David toured us around your quarters... ...and I saw a Bible by your bed. Do you actually find time to read it? I sure do. Every goddamn day. Sir, Patton's taken Palermo! Damn! Palermo's the most conquered city in history. First the Phoenicians... ...the Romans, Carthaginians, Byzantines. Then came the Arabs... ...Spaniards, Neapolitans. Now comes... ...the American Army. This is from General Alexander, sir... ...reminding you that you are not to take Palermo. Send him a message, Cod. Ask him if he wants me to give it back. PATTON: Let me ask you a question for a change. You've just come from Washington. How do they feel about our boys taking Palermo? The general impression is, your army barreled through token resistance... ...while Montgomery faced the brunt of the fighting. Don't they know we took on the Hermann Gring division? Toughest outfit in the German Army. The people at home are interested in you. They're curious about your pearl-handle revolvers. They're ivory. Only a pimp from a New Orleans whorehouse... ...would carry a pearl handle. What about your language? When I want it to stick, I give it to them loud and dirty. What do your troops feel about that? I don't want these men to love me. I want them to fight for me. Ernie Pyle says you have a secret weapon here: General Bradley. Ernie calls him ""The GI General."" Omar Bradley is no secret. He's a damn fine commander. MAN: Whas your feeling about Montgomery? PATTON: He's the best general the English have. He seems more concerned with not losing than he does about winning. He's not aggressive enough, is that correct? Look, I've been getting into a lot of trouble lately. Yesterday, the office told me that my Italian prisoners... ...didn't have enough latrine. They didn't know what a latrine was till I showed them. If I've said anything too critical of my British colleague... ...les forget about it. I will tell you one thing, though. Off the record. I'm gonna beat that... ...gentleman to Messina. Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what this madman Patton is saying? He's going to save our skins by taking Messina. This report might interest you. Here I am in these bloody marshes, fighting malaria and Germans... ...while he's taking Palermo and getting all the glory. Well! Now he's up against three good German divisions and he's stuck. He's not going to get Messina. Thas reserved for the British 8th Army and me. Is time for a move, Lucian. Terry Allen's 1 st Division is bogged down. You're bogged down too. What we need is another end run just to break things loose. - Lucian. How's my fighter? - Fine, George. Come in, come in. We need another one of your amphibious specialties. Lucian, I want you to send a reinforced battalion by sea... ...to make a landing up here at Brolo behind the kraut lines. You want me to do a land-based attack. Right. I want a coordinated attack the morning of the 11 th. I don't think we can make it by the 11 th. - Hell, is only 15, 20 miles. - My boys have been dying for yards. Hm. Maybe you better kick a few butts if you have to. I recommended you for your DSM in your last promotion. I know what you can do when you put your mind to it. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry, but I can't do the impossible. You're too old an athlete to think you can postpone a scheduled match. You're an old athlete yourself. You know matches are postponed. If we can't back Lucian up by land, our end run could be a disaster. Those men might get caught on the beach and cut to pieces. - Whas the matter? BRADLEY: All we're saying is... ...not to rush in until we're ready. Give him an extra day. Just one more day. The landing is on. We're going to Messina. We're going to get there before Montgomery does. - Whas so important about that? - General Truscott... ...if your conscience won't permit you to conduct this operation... ...I'll find somebody who can. General, is your privilege to relieve me anytime you want to. This match will not be postponed. Any questions? No, sir. You're a very good man, Lucian. You want to guard against being too conservative. Remember what Frederick the Great said: ""L 'audace, I'audace! Toujours I'audace!"" Go on, have a drink. Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking for the next couple of days. If anything happens to those men, I'd like to be there with them. You're not going, so forget about it. You believe Truscos right? No. But you're gambling with those boys' lives... ...just to beat Montgomery into Messina. If you pull it off, you're a hero, but if you don't... What happens to them? The ordinary combat soldier. He doesn't share in your dreams of glory, he's stuck here. He's living out every day, day-to-day, with death tugging at his elbow. There's one big difference between you and me, George. I do this job because I've been trained to do it. You do it because... ...you love it. The men on the beach are catching hell, general. The men are doing their best. We have no replacements. I can't break through to the coast. I'm going down there myself. PATTON: Colonel! How did he get over there? PATTON: What the hell are you waiting for? Looking for a place to ford, general. I sent a patrol to reconnoiter. PATTON: I've done that. Down there this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep. Get that outfit cranked up or you'll be out of a job! - And put that helmet on. - Yes, sir. Move it! Les go! - Whas holding up this column? - I don't know, sir. Planes! Come on, move it! Pull up over there. - Come on. - Whas going on here? Sir, these mules- Jackasses! You let a column get stalled and strafed on account of two jackasses?! No. No. Now, dump them over the side and clear this bridge! We're pinned down because we can't get air support! Nobody's getting any air support! Put fire into this battalion, or I'll get somebody who can. Major! - You the executive officer here? - Yes, sir. - Your name? - Walker. You're now commanding officer. You've got 4 hours to break through that beachhead. If you don't make it, I'll fire you. 50,000 men on this island would like to shoot that son of a bitch. Please take me home. Take me home. Please take me home. Take me home. - There he goes, ""Old Blood and Guts."" - Yeah, our blood. His guts. Hi, how are you, son? Where are you from, Gomez? California, sir. Me too. - Where were you hit? - In the chest, sir. Well... ...this might be interesting to you. The last German I saw had no chest. Didn't have any head either. You get well quickly, son. Whas the matter with you? I guess I just can't take it, sir. What did you say? Is my nerves, sir. I just can't stand the shelling anymore. Your nerves? Hell, you're just a goddamn coward. Shut up! I won't have a yellow bastard crying... ...in front of these brave, wounded men. Shut up! Don't admit this yellow bastard. Nothing wrong with him. I won't have sons of bitches afraid to fight stink up this place of honor. You're going back to the front, my friend. You may get shot, you may get killed, but you're going up to the fighting. Either that or I'll stand you up in front of a firing squad. I should shoot you myself, you bastard! Get him out of here! Send him up to the front! You hear me? You goddamn coward! I won't have cowards in my army. I had to kick a few butts... ...but Truscott finally broke through to those people on the beach. Have you seen the casualty lists? Yes, I've seen them. Whas the word from the coast road? The 3rd Division's east of Brolo, heading toward Messina. Les get over there. I want to go in with the troops. You go ahead, George. I'm not very good at that. General Bradley... ...is time to consider how many casualties we'd have... ...if we were still crawling on that goddamn road. Forward, march! Don't smirk, Patton. I shan't kiss you. Pity. I shaved close this morning to prepare for getting smacked by you. Forward, march! You wanted to see me, George? Got a letter here from Ike. I was rereading Caesar's Commentaries last night. In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to distinguish him from his men. I was struck by that fact because- ""Despicable."" First time anybody's ever applied that word to me. Well, at least is a personal reprimand, is not official. The man was yellow. He shoulve been tried for cowardice and shot. People have taken a lot worse than a little kick in the pants. I ruffled his pride a bit. Whas that compared to war? Two weeks ago at Palermo they said I was the greatest general... ...since Stonewall Jackson. - Now they draw cartoons about you. Dirty bastard! They got me holding a little GI and kicking him with an iron boot. You see that, whas on my boot? A swastika. On my boot. An iron boot with a swastika! ""You will apologize to the soldier you slapped... ...to all doctors and nurses present in the tent at the time... ...to every patient in the tent who can be reached... ...and last but not least to the 7th Army as a whole... ...through individual units, one at a time."" God, I... ...feel low. PATTON: Oh, God... ...Thou art my God. Early will I seek Thee. My soul thirsteth for Thee. My flesh longeth for Thee in a dry and thirsty land. So as I have seen Thee in the sanctuary. My soul followeth hard after Thee. But those that seek my soul to destroy it... ...shall go into the lower parts of the earth. They shall fall by the sword. They shall be apportioned for foxes. But the king shall rejoice in God. Everyone that sweareth by him shall glory. But the mouth of them that speak lies... ...shall be stopped. Ten-hut! PATTON: At ease. I thought I'd stand up here and let you people see... ...if I am as big a son of a bitch as some of you think I am. I assure you I had no intention... ...of being either harsh or cruel in my treatment of the... ...soldier in question. My sole purpose was to try to restore in him... ...some appreciation of his obligations as a man... ...and as a soldier. If one can shame a coward... ...I felt one might help him to regain his self-respect. This was on my mind. Now, I freely admit... ...that my method was wrong... ...but I hope you understand my motive... ...and will accept this... ...explanation... ...and this... ...apology. - Dismissed. - Ten-hut! Good evening, general. I want to report on a private poll I'm taking. What poll? The fan mail. Eleven percent con, 89 percent pro. And that 11% of protest, in most cases, is both obscene and anonymous. But the pro letters are mostly from relatives and servicemen. ""I want you to know we're proud our son is serving in your army. From the newspaper, we're not clear exactly what you did and why... ...but we want you to know we're for you. Keep going, and God bless you."" Keep going, huh? Where? I thought you might like a sip of wine, general. Is New Year's. You didn't celebrate at all last night. I'm sick of sitting around this... ...royal doghouse. We've taken Sicily. I'm ready for a new assignment. Maybe you've got it. Here's a radio message, just came in. Cod. I've been relieved. They've relieved me from command of the 7th Army. I don't believe it. Happy New Year. Just a minute, sir. Since they're sure to give you another command... ...isn't it logical they'd relieve you here first? You mean command of all American troops going into Europe? Is possible. I know is been discussed from time to time. The logic of it is so obvious, it couldn't mean anything else. Sir, I'm going to open this bottle of wine. No, Sir Cod... ...but if you find a bottle of cognac, I'll help you drink it. - How you feeling tonight, general? - Not bad, not bad at all. - Get me some writing paper, will you? - Yes, sir. Your wife ever give you the devil for not writing? All the time, sir. Only I don't write as often as you do. Don't seem to get around to it. Lucky for us we got them. Who wants to marry a couple of broken-down old horse captains? Thas what my wife says to me every time I come home, sir. Why are you up so late, George? Thought you'd like a nice hot bath or something. I got this sleeping pill from the doc, just in case you need it. Sleeping pill! - Whas going on here? - I heard the news, sir. - They announced it on the radio. - What news? About General Bradley, sir. How they gave him the top American command. Oh. Oh, yeah. I just thought you might be feeling kind of low, sir. Your writing things, sir. Here on the desk, sir. Yeah. Thank you, George. One little dog face. One measly little slap. Thas what done it. Ah, George. I wish I'd kissed the son of a bitch. He's paying tribute to the Free French Forces under DeGaulle and Leclerc. And to the people of the Resistance... ...who risk their lives to help destroy the Germans. ""France will be free again. I give you my word."" ""Just as Free French troops liberated Corsica, Napoleon's place of birth... ...I will someday land in France to liberate the birthplace of Lafayette."" General, the reporters would like a word with you. - Good afternoon. - General. Can you tell us the purpose of this visit to Corsica? General Eisenhower ordered me here. You wrote the mother of the boy you slapped, ""The rat shoulve been shot."" - Is that true, general? - No comment. Sir, I understand Gen. Alexander suggested... ...you take over Gen. Clark's Italian campaign... ...but it was killed due to the incident. - No comment. - Can you say where you're going, sir? Off the record, Eisenhower's ordered me to Malta. Interview concluded. You plan on slapping any soldiers there, general? PATTON: In 1528, these forts were defended by... ...400 Knights of Malta and 800 mercenaries... ...against a force of 40,000 Turks. Codman. - Still no word from Gen. Eisenhower? - No, sir. Not even a response about the two turkeys I sent for Christmas? No, sir. Go ahead, gentlemen. Take a closer look for yourselves. Looks like you boys have hitched your wagon to a falling star. Pass the word. If anyone wants out, I'll understand. Sir, I can speak for the entire staff. We want to stay with you, no matter what duty you're assigned to. Up in London, they're planning the invasion of Europe. I've trained my mind, body and spirit for that. What, in Gos name, am I doing here? All right. Les get on to Cairo. See if the pyramids are still standing. - This place is for me? - Yes, sir. This way, sir. Whoever found it has a genius for cloak and dagger. Who picked this cathouse? I think it was Gen. Smith, sir. To spite me, that son of a bitch. - Welcome to London, Georgie. - Bedell. How are you? - Is Ike here? - He asked me to brief you. Would you excuse us, please? Let me put you straight about Ike. We hear a lot about you criticizing his decisions. Not really. You know me. I'm just an old fool. At times, I do wonder whether he isn't a limey at heart. George, this is the toughest coalition ever attempted in history. Ike's trying to hold it together and lick the Germans at the same time. - Is a hell of a job. - I understand. You have an important assignment connected to the Normandy invasion. Good. I've studied the Overlord Plan and there's a number of flaws in it. You can't depend on Monty taking Cannes by D-day. He'll never make it. I've drawn up an alternate plan to land at Calais... ...following an air bombardment- - Will you just listen for a change? Ike stood by you when everyone, I mean everyone... ...wanted Patton with a rope around his neck. We're gonna let it leak out that you are here undercover. That you're preparing to invade at the Pas de Calais. We hope to pin down the German 15th Army there... ...so that they can't be used against us at Normandy. Is that all I'm good for? We're going to build an army of 12 divisions around you. All fictitious, of course. Dummy troop concentrations, dummy landing craft... ...simulated radio traffic. The Germans are convinced that you will lead the main invasion effort. Their agents will spot you soon... ...then we can move you to Knutsford. - What do I do there? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Frankly, George, you're on probation. Take my advice and behave yourself. Remember... ...your worst enemy is your own big mouth. Look at this nasty-faced son of a bitch. Ready for combat. I'll call him William as in ""the Conqueror."" - Sir, should we leave him in the car? - No. Good afternoon, ladies. Good afternoon. Watch this, Cod. - Sir, he'll kill that dog. - I'll hold him. I'm terribly sorry, general. Did Abigail frighten your dog? Thas quite all right, madam. This way, sir. Your name isn't William. Is Willie. WOMAN: My dear friends. General George S. Patton, Jr., has accepted our invitation... ...to say a few words to you... ...on the occasion of this inaugural ceremony. General Patton is not here in an official capacity... ...and I have assured him most earnestly... ...that nothing he says will be quoted. May I present General Patton. - Remember, sir, watch your language. - Yeah. My dear ladies. Until today... ...my only experience at welcoming has been... ...to welcome Germans and Italians to the infernal region. At this I have been quite successful... ...since the troops, which I have had the honor to command... ...have, to date, killed or captured... ...some 170,000 of our enemies. I feel that such clubs as these are of very real value... ...because I believe with Mr. Bernard Shaw... ...that the British and the Americans are two peoples... ...separated by a common language. Since it is the destiny of the British and Americans to rule the world... ...the better we know each other... ...the better we will do it. The Russians, don't forget the Russians. I think that a club like this... ...is an ideal place for promoting mutual understanding. Because as soon as our soldiers meet and get to know the English ladies... ...and write home and tell our women just how lovely you truly are... ...then the sooner the American ladies will get jealous... ...and force this war to a quick termination. And then I'll get the chance to go to the Pacific and kill Japanese. NARRATOR: All over the nation... ...mass meetings are held to protest General Patton 's statement... ...that Britain and America will rule the post war world. That Russia will have no say. Congressional leaders like Senator Clayburn Foss are quick to react. This man has insulted our Russian allies... ...implying Anglo-American world rule. In my opinion, he should be severely disciplined. This time I didn't do a damn thing. They promised there wouldn't be any reporters. I made a few remarks off the record. Ike told you to keep your mouth shut. You know how suspicious the Russians are of the British and us. I was only trying to be polite to the old ladies. If I'd seen the Russians there, I'd have mentioned the sons of bitches. Bedell, I don't know anything about politics. I have no political ambitions. All I want to do is to command an army in combat. Well, is out of our hands now. Ike sent a message last night to the chief of staff. Now is up to General Marshall whether you stay here as a decoy... ...or he sends you home. He's a good man. At least he's a fair man. I'll let it sit with him. PATTON: George... ...our war is over. Over, sir? Is just a question of waiting for the orders now. I feel I'm... I'm destined to achieve some great thing. What, I don't know. But this last incident is... ...so trivial in its nature and so terrible in its effect- It can't be an accident. It has to be the work of God. Yes, sir. The last great opportunity of a lifetime... ...an entire world at war and I'm left out of it? No, sir. God will not permit this to happen! I am going to be allowed to fulfil my destiny! His will be done. NARRATOR: In the greatest amphibious operation ever attempted... ...a predawn naval bombardment prepares the way... ...for allied soldiers to assault the Normandy beaches... ...and claw out a desperate foothold on the continent of Europe. I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so. And here they are all hung up in the hedgerow country. They should pivot the way von Schlieffen planned it in World War I. Then we might get a chance to do some real broken field running. But they don't listen to me. What a way to enter the continent of Europe. Along with all the rest of the spare parts. Sir, everything on this plane is high priority. Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you unless he had something in mind. I'll tell you, Cod. I've learned my lesson. If I ever do get another chance, I'm gonna keep my mouth shut. I'm gonna play the game. If I forget, you remind me. - I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs. - Give me a swift kick in the ass. Yes, sir. Welcome to France, sir. Hope the war's still on. Where's the boss? Right this way, sir. Patton, haven't seen you since Messina. How are you? You're doing a splendid job decoying the Jerries. You'll forgive me, I'm off to the front. Best of everything, old boy. By the way... ...intelligence confirms that I'm against Rommel again. Rommel. Hi, how are you, George? - Pretty fair, Brad. How are you? - Fine. Well. My, my. Isn't this plush? Looks like you're bucking for archbishop. Chet Hansen had this rig built for me. George, sit down. Ike wanted me to talk to you since we can level with each other. Thas right. We're making 3rd Army operational when I take over 12th Army group. Do I get it? I'll be honest with you. I've had reservations. You've been my senior ever since I left the academy. You were the boss in North Africa and Sicily and I just thought... ...well, it might be a problem for us. It wouldn't bother me. There's one other thing. We're different kinds of people. Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right. With your brains and my screwy ideas, we make a great team, like in Sicily. Truthfully, if I had been your senior in Sicily, I would have relieved you. Brad... ...I'm not crawling on my belly to get a command. For Gos sake, get me in this fight. The only way out of the doghouse is to do something great. I gotta get back in the war! Hitler's own people tried to kill him a few days ago. First thing you know, ill be over and... I'll... ...keep my mouth shut. I'll behave myself. I give you my word. George... ...I've been working on a plan called Cobra. I'd like your opinion. We've been slugging through hedgerow country... ...half an acre a day and we've got to find a way out. I want to use this road. The Saint L-Periers road. Monty will pin down the enemy forces at Caen. We'll pulverize an area 31/2 miles wide with bombing. Then seven divisions will follow. The 3rd Army will swing around here, a sweeping end run right across France. What do you think? I think you'll need a screwball old cavalryman to command the 3rd Army. George... ...Ike came to that conclusion in London three months ago. He what? Why, that dirty-! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I promise to keep my mouth shut. George could have the courtesy to tell us where he's going. Good God, look at that. Where you going, general? Berlin. I'm going to personally shoot that paper-hanging son of a bitch. Hold it. Hold it! This place isn't on the map. You know why? We've run clear off the map. Give George a headline, and he's good for another 30 miles. SOLDIER: Atten-hut! Hold it! Pay attention. We're gonna clean this mess up right now. Les move this vehicle out this way. This one out this way. Back that thing up there, and we'll take this one here. All right, get up off your ass. Les go now! Thas it. Thas the way to move. Good boy. All right, come on. Come on, now. Here we go. Come on. Thas it! Thas it! Gun it! Gun that thing! Okay, come on. Watch it! Go, go, go! Come on. Hold it up. Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Thas it. Come on, now. - Chet. - Yeah, will do. Come on, keep coming. Keep coming. Hold it up there. Now come on! Hold it! Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank! Thas it. Come on. Good boy. - Hold it up there. - General! General Bradley wants to have a word with you. Okay. Come on! Okay. Hold it up. Take over. George, you'd make a good traffic cop. George this drive has been magnificent... ...but I'm sorry to say I have to slow you down. - What the hell for? - We'll have to cut off your supplies. Gasoline, ammunition, everything. We're up against new priorities. - I think I smell Montgomery. - Take it easy, George. There are serious issues involved. Political issues. By God, it is Montgomery. The launching sites for the B-2 bombs are all in his area. Churchill wants those bases destroyed. Hitler kills more civilians in London than soldiers. Expect Montgomery to do anything? You give me gasoline and I'll gain ground with it, kill Germans too. Give me 400,000 gallons. I'll go to Berlin. George, I can't do it. The Siegfried line is an empty shell. They stripped the equipment and sent it east. Is crawling with cows. I can punch through in two days. There's no use in arguing with me. It wasn't my idea. Why did you pick me to command? I didn't pick you. Ike picked you. George, you have performed brilliantly. You are loyal, dedicated. You're one of the best I've got, but you don't know when to shut up. George, you're a pain in the neck. I have a lot of faults, Brad. But ingratitude isn't one of them. I owe you a lot. Hell, I know I'm a prima donna. I admit it. What I can't stand about Monty is, he won't admit it. Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas. The point tank has run out too. And there's a kraut column up ahead. Yeah, I know. PATTON: Were you in command here, captain? I was in command. My tank platoon was supporting an infantry company. Tanks ran out of gas, so we had to fight it out. We started 11:00 last night. Finished a couple hours ago. This morning the fighting was hand-to-hand. I had a dream last night. In my dream it came to me... ...that right now the whole Nazi Reich is mine for the taking. Think about that, Cod. I was nearly sent home in disgrace. Now I have precisely the right instrument... ...at precisely the right moment of history and exactly the right place. The Saar? This will change too, very quickly. Like a planet spinning off into the universe. A moment like this won't come again for 1000 years. All I need is a few miserable gallons of gasoline. Right now, the weak spot is here. In 10 days, we could be in Berlin. What about the fortifications that were done in Metz? Fixed fortifications, huh? Monuments to the stupidity of man. When mountain ranges and oceans could be overcome... ...anything built by man can be overcome. You know how I'm sure they're finished out there? The carts. They're using carts to move their wounded and the supplies. The carts came to me in my dream. I couldn't figure it out. Then I remembered... ...that nightmare in the snow. The agonizing retreat from Moscow. How cold it was. They threw the wounded and what was left of the supplies in the carts. Napoleon was finished. Not any color left. Not even the red of blood. Only the snow. Look at this, Cod. I love it. God help me, I do love it so. I love it more than my life. NARRATOR: Paris is liberated, and French troops lead the way. The Allies march into the city after four years of Nazi occupation. The hard-fighting French 2nd Armored Division... ...under Major General Jacques Leclerc... ...gets an unforgettable welcome... ...as they enter their beloved Paris. In a powerful drive to the north... ...General Montgomery cuts off and bypasses the French coastal towns... ...of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. Pushing on to capture the vital Belgian port of Antwerp. Meanwhile, the main body of Patton 's army... ...resupplied now and rolling like a juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar. Nazi resistance appears to crumble. It seems that nothing can stop our troops from driving on into Germany. - Sir, General Bradley on your line. - Good, good. Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead across the Saar. I'm on my way to Germany. Wait a minute, George. There's a lot of trouble up north. I want you to transfer tank armor to Middleton's 8th Corps right away. Brad, you can't do that. George, listen. I don't have time to argue. There's a lot of enemy activity up around Ardennes. No, I don't know how serious it is... ...but Ike wants us to meet with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun. Be there at 1100. Yes, sir. PATTON: There's absolutely no reason for us to assume... ...that the Germans are mounting a major offense. The weather is awful and their supplies are low. The Germans haven't mounted a winter attack since Frederick the Great. Therefore I believe thas exactly what they're going to do. I want you to start making contingency plans... ...for pulling out of our eastward attack. Changing directions 90 degrees, moving up to Luxembourg. Don't look so stunned, gentlemen. I want you to plan for three possible axes of attack. From Diekirch, due north. From Orlans to Bastogne. From Neufchteau against the German left flank. We've identified four German armies: The 7th, the 5th Panzer, 6th SS Panzer and the 15th. They've hit us with 26 divisions. They've overran two regimens of the 106th Division. And 7500 of our men were forced to surrender. Our concern is that von Rundstedt... ...has the 101 st Airborne trapped here at Bastogne. Bastogne, by the way, is the key to this entire area. If we can hold it, we can break up the entire German offensive. If they take it, we're in serious trouble. Ike wants to know if anybody can go... ...and relieve the 101 st before they're torn to pieces. There's nothing Montgomery can do. At any rate, not for some weeks. What about you, George? I can attack with three divisions in 48 hours. I'd give myself some leeway. Ike wants a realistic estimate, George. You're in the middle of a fight now. Is over a hundred miles to Bastogne. My staff's already working out the details. Frankly, I don't see how is possible. Not in this kind of weather. I should have thought you'd want to fall back and regroup. Not me. I don't like to pay for the same real estate twice. TEDDER: But what about your men? You can't cart them off 100 miles, expecting them to attack without rest. I trained these men. They'll do what I tell them to do. We hadn't realized you were so popular with your troops, general. I'm not. They'll do it because they're good soldiers. And because they realize, as I do, that we can still lose this war. Then I think I can speak for Field Marshal Montgomery. He'd say you're asking the impossible of your men. Of course he would. Cause he's never realized thas what we're in business for. General McAuliffe refused a German surrender demand. You know what he said? What? He said, ""Nuts."" Keep them moving, colonel. A man that eloquent has to be saved. This is where it pays off. The training and discipline. No other outfit in the world. Pulled out of a winter battle, move a hundred miles. Going to a major attack with no rest, no sleep, no hot food. God! God, I'm proud of these men! Sir, von Rundsteds thrown another panzer division against Bastogne. 101 st Airborne's barely holding on. We need damned air cover. If we had decent weather, we might make it. CARVER: General Mason, sir. Hello, Mase? Listen, we're short on foot soldiers. Cannibalize your antiaircraft units and turn them into riflemen. Yes, every last one you can find. Good evening, general. I just got the weather report for tomorrow. More snow. There goes our air cover. We may have to wait for better weather. Brave men dying up there. I won't wait, not an hour, not a minute. Going to keep moving. Is that clear? We're going to attack all night and attack tomorrow morning! If we're not victorious... ...let no one come back alive. You know something, general? Sometimes, they can't tell when you're acting and when you're not. It isn't important for them to know. Is only important for me to know. - You want to see me, general? - Oh, yeah, chaplain. I'm tired of 3rd Army having to fight Germans... ...with supreme command, no gasoline... ...and now this ungodly weather. I want a prayer, a weather prayer. A weather prayer, sir? Yes, les see if you can't get God working with us. Gonna take a thick rug for that kind of praying. I don't care if it takes a flying carpet. I don't know how this will be received, general. Praying for good weather so we can kill our fellow man. I assure you, because of my relations with the Almighty... ...if you write a good prayer, we'll have good weather. And I expect that prayer within an hour. Yes, sir. ""Almighty and most merciful Father... ...we humbly beseech Thee... ...of Thy great goodness... ...to restrain this immoderate weather... ...with which we've had to contend. Grant us fair weather for battle. Graciously hearken to us... ...as soldiers who call upon Thee... ...that armed with Thy power... ...we may advance from victory to victory... ...and crush the oppression... ...and wickedness of our enemies... ...and establish Thy justice... ...among men and nations. Amen."" Weather's perfect. Cod, get me that chaplain. He's in good with the Lord and I want to decorate him. Hiya, general! NARRATOR: Supported by medium bombers and fighter bombers... ...flying sorties against German positions... ...elements of the 3rd Army... ...spearheaded by the 4th Armored Division... ...drive into Bastogne... ...to relieve its 18,000 defenders... ...on the day after Christmas. During this operation, 3rd Army moved farther and faster... ...and engaged more divisions in less time... ...than any other army in the history of the United States. Excuse me, sir. General Katkov would like to know if you'll join him... ...to drink to the surrender of Germany. My compliments to the general. Please inform him that I do not care to drink with him... ...or any other Russian son of a bitch. Sir... ...I cannot tell the general that. You tell him that. Tell him word for word. The general says he thinks that... ...you are a son of a bitch too. Okay. I'll drink to that. One son of a bitch to another. Is it true that Roosevelt, before he died... ...promised you a command in the Pacific? Yes. But now that he's gone, I don't think there's much chance of that. Doug MacArthur doesn't want me up there. We're told of ""wonder weapons"" the Germans were working on: Long-range rockets, push-button bombing... ...weapons that don't need soldiers. ""Wonder weapon""? My God, I don't see the wonder in them. Killing without heroics. Nothing is glorified, nothing is reaffirmed. No heroes, no cowards, no troops. No generals. Only those that are left alive and those that are left... ...dead. I'm glad I won't live to see it. REPORTER: Is said you're still using former Nazis in key positions. Despite the denazification policy. Well, if I'm supplied with trained personnel... ...I'll get rid of the Nazis. Until then, I'll use them to keep the railroads and telephones working. After all, didn't most ordinary Nazis join the Party... ...in about the same way Americans become Republicans or Democrats? Yes, thas about it. You agree that national policy be made by civilians, not by the military? Of course. But the politicians never let us finish. They always stop short and leave us with another war. You thinking about our Russian allies? Did you say if you found your army between the Germans and the Russians... ...you'd attack in both directions? No, I never said that. I never said any such thing. But I wish I had. Sir, there's a call on your line from supreme headquarters, General Smith. Bedell? Ike is furious. How could you compare Republicans and Democrats to the Nazi Party? And the statement that you refuse to denazify... ...has the Russians, the British, everybody, screaming. Well, the hell with the Mongoloid Russians. We've given them Berlin, Prague, God knows what else. They gonna dictate policy too? George, don't be a fool. The war in Europe is over. Washington dictates policy. The war shouldn't be over. We should stop pussyfooting about the Russians! We'll have to fight them anyway. Why not do it now, when the army's here? Instead of disarming Germans les get them to help fight the Bolsheviks. You better shut up. This line may be tapped. I don't care. I'll tell you... ...we've been fighting the wrong people. You and I don't have to get involved, you're so soft about it. Leave it to me. In 10 days I'll have us at war with them... ...and make it look like their fault! George, you're mad. You're absolutely out of your mind! Well, I'm no diplomat. I'm a combat soldier. Thas all they understand. Get Ike to give me the word, and I'll kick them back to Russia! Shall I call the artist back, sir? Oh, the hell with it. Nobody wants to see a picture of me. I'm mad! Don't you know that? Field Marshal Montgomery, his majesty is prepared... ...to receive the next chief of the imperial general staff. Thank you. Thank you. Take care of yourself. George. Well, gentlemen... ...all good things must come to an end. And the best thing thas happened to me... ...in my life... ...has been... ...uh... ...the honor... ...and privilege... ...of commanding the 3rd Army. Goodbye... ...and God bless you. Brad... ...they've taken the 3rd Army away from me. I know. I thought we could have dinner together tonight. Thank you, Brad. Thas damn thoughtful. I appreciate it. Right now, I think I'll take Willie for a walk. George, look out! After all I've been through... ...imagine getting killed by an oxcart. No, Brad, there's only one proper way for a professional soldier to die. Thas from the last bullet of the last battle of the last war. At least the 3rd Army earned its pay. In our drive across Europe, we liberated... ...12,000 cities and towns... ...and inflicted a million and a half enemy casualties. I sense from now on, just being a good soldier won't mean a thing. I'm afraid we're gonna have to be diplomats, administrators, you name it. God help us. George, I want to say one thing. You've done a magnificent job here in Europe. Thas right, George. That soldier you slapped did more to win the war than any other private. I'll see you for dinner. Six-thirty? PATTON: For over a thousand years... ...Roman conquerors returning from the wars... ...enjoyed the honor of a triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeters and musicians and strange animals... ...from the conquered territories... ...together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot... ...the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes, his children, robed in white... ...stood with him in the chariot, or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror... ...holding a golden crown... ...and whispering in his ear a warning... ...that all glory... ...is fleeting., The headboard. The headboard, honey. You know it makes me nervous. Could you put your hand up there... ...and hold it? That's right, because-- That's-- That's-- Jesus! Oh! That's right. Jesus Christ! When did you get back in town? Where are you staying? Is she still in the same place? Listen. Why don't you--? I'll call you tomorrow. Why don't you come by the shop and say hi? Okay. Bye. Why do you bother with them? Tell them you're sleeping and hang up. This girl has problems. Know what your problem is? - You have too many sick ladies. - Oh, yeah? Particularly in your business. Don't worry, honey... ...because I'm gonna protect you. Look what I found. Oh, shit! Shit. What do you mean? I don't know why you don't get yourself an answering service. What are you doing? I'm looking for my keys. Keys? - You said you weren't going anywhere. - I just gotta see this friend. What are you talking about? You're going to see one of those girls. She's not a girl. Just a friend. Wait. Wait until I'm dressed because I'm going too. Christ, get me a Kleenex. Look, Felicia. I won't be long. - You're great. - Thanks a lot. - This girl has attacks. - What attacks? These attacks. It's got something to do with her pancreas. She's got a... - Pancreatic ulcer? - Yeah, I think so. - That's serious. - I know. - Her doctor? - Don't know. - Very serious. - I know. - Ruth had a pancreatic ulcer. - She did? - It turned out to be a cancer. - Wow. What are you going for, George? You're not a doctor. I gotta give her some pills. She ran out of Percodan. Felicia, I want your ass in this bed when I get back. - You do? - Yes. - You're very weird, George. - You're great, baby. You are great. Take this off. Christ! Goddamn it. Oh, shit! - Who is it? - Who do you think? - Honey. - Yeah? - Don't yell at me. - I'm not. - There were shots. - What? Gunshots. Some gunshots. - Where? - Here. - In the canyon. - It's a big canyon, honey. So what? A bullet can probably go miles. - Why do you leave me alone? - I was running all over... - ...preparing for the bank tomorrow. - Why didn't you call? I can't make outgoing calls. Just breathe, honey. Sometimes I get this terrible feeling that something awful will happen. Like what? I don't know. Like somebody's going to get me. - I've had these dreams lately. - What dreams? They're dumb, but... ...somebody gets me and they throw me around the room. They grab me and tie me down. - Then what? - Then I wake up. I figure if somebody's gonna get you... ...it's probably gonna be me. No. How are you, baby? How are you? Where were you? I'm great, honey. Fantastic. I really couldn't be better. I really feel incredible. No. Where were you? Getting it together. I'm opening up the shop. - Really? - Yeah. - I'm at the epitome of my life. - What happened tonight? I can't talk about it. I've been disgusted. - You said you're at the epitome. - I am. I am. Till I get Norman off my ass, and people work for me... Women can get to be an occupational hazard. What do you mean? While I work in that shop, I'm always doing too many heads. - What about me? - You're different. - I am? - You're great. - Do you really mean that? - I'm gonna retire with you. - Honey? - Yeah? - Why am I great? - Jesus, I don't know. You're great. - Know what I read in Cosmopolitan? - What? If you don't have a baby by 30, you'll have a Mongolian idiot. - George. - Bullshit. Maybe you don't even like children. You've never been around one. I'm around you and I like you, don't I? - Yeah. - Okay. Good night, honey. - George? - What? Jackie won't bring children into the world. Says it's overpopulated and hypocritical. Could we talk about this in the morning? Jesus, let me show you something. Six, six and three-quarters. That's our prime rate. I'll tell you something else. The big boys are going for it. Do you know where FHA is? - FHA? - Just take a guess where they are. Well, seven and a half. - Wow. - Wow, indeed. We're not going back to the old days. - Guess not. - Inflation's not the reason. Rates rise independently of tight money. What sort of references do you have, Mr. Roundy? I do Barbara Rush. You do what? Her hair. I do Barbara Rush. I meant credit references and... Jesus. I'm not the cigarette kind. So what? We get a trip out of it. It's a job. Egypt? Why Egypt? - That's where the pyramids are. - You seem disappointed. No. Egypt? - Maybe we can change our location. - No, that's not it. - Do you have children? - No. - Are you married? - No. - Got something against traveling? - No. - Something against us? - No. Jill, you can come out and say it. I'm embarrassed. We'll let you know tomorrow. Thank you for coming by. Please don't misunderstand. I would like to go. - Thank you. - Sure. Jesus, this town. Financial statement? I got the heads. Customers come to me. They want me. If I open a shop, they'll come to me. - I got lots of heads. - Okay. - Know what I'm talking about? - No. How do you expect to lend me money if you don't know my business? I don't. Good morning, Mr. Roundy. Excuse me. Aren't I entitled to make out a financial statement? Yes, of course. Miss Michaels, would you hand me a few of those forms? Thanks very much. Just have these notarized... - ...and we'll see how it goes. - Thanks. You asshole! Do you know what George did? He wakes me up at 2:00 am to do my hair. Why? I don't know. He woke me up and said ""I'm gonna make you... ...the grooviest chick in this town."" - What did you do? - I looked at him and said, ""George... ...if you love me, I am the grooviest chick."" - Did he cut your hair? - We didn't get around to that. Jackie, when you and George were together, did he do that stuff? I can't remember. It was so long ago. Yeah, stupid question. I'm pleased that you're happy with Lester. It's great to wake up in the morning with your rent paid. George was just too much of a gypsy for me. - He went to the bank today. - Oh, he did? I just couldn't wait that long. But George is great. Yeah, George is great. He's great. Hello, George! - Hey, baby. What's happening? - Nothing. I reconciled with Ron. - Ron? - The guy I divorced last summer. Great. - I hope you make it. - Call me. I don't have your number. Stop by the shop. Am I dry? Think it has enough height? You think it has the height? Would someone feel me? Am I dry? - Is this a nice height? - It looks great. - You're late. - Let me-- - Wait. - I don't care. - The girl-- - I don't care if she's dead. - Norman says to charge for coffee. - You know what you can tell Norman. - Sorry. - Don't waste my time. Understand? It's important to me. Let's stick to hair if you want. - Stop. Have Mary do it. - Have her do what? - You have no respect for me! - I don't? You can't distinguish me from your Hollywood numbers! - My what? - Numbers! - That's Tickle Pink. What? - Numbers. I don't need to be put in this kind of position. - Why are you here? - Wash and set. You need a cut. - Norman said-- - George says you need a cut. - I shouldn't be put in this position. - I'm not trying to do that. I'll have Mary wash you. Mary? - Wash her. - With? A Brillo pad. I'm not trying to put you in a position. Shit. I'll be right back. - I'm taking a lot of shit lately. - It's Norman. Ain't no Norman. You're like my Otis. He can't keep off the ladies. - How's he doing? - Got a letter from him. - He just made corporal squad leader. - That's great. Rocko, I don't believe what you're saying to me. That is the purest comment I've ever made. - If you can't do my hair-- - Stop. I'm going crazy. - Why? - I've been cutting too much hair. I'm losing all my concepts. Baby, you're great. - Hey, baby. What's happening? - They want me to go to Egypt. Great. Jill, meet Felicia. - Hello. - Hello. - How did it go at the bank? - Great. - Could I speak to you? - Well, I'm-- - Go ahead, George. - Could I? - I said I wasn't sure I could go. - Where? - Egypt. - Great. I gotta get back. - How did it go at the bank? - Great. Can we talk later? - Why the bank? - Trying to get my own shop. - Really? - George. - Yeah? - You're late. You're supposed to go to Buffums. - Buffums? - Yes, Buffums. - I'm busy. - You promised to do the show. - Fuck, Norman! - George. - Gloria needs a cut? - Her ends are split. Well, don't you contradict me in public again! What is this shit about not charging for coffee? I'm charging $25 a head already. I'm not gonna hit them for coffee. I want you to learn to collect. Will you learn to nickel-and-dime? You're gonna end up without a pot to pee in. - Looking great. - What are you doing later? - Whatever you say. - We have this political thing tonight. Can you comb me for it? You went to the bank? For a loan? You really want your own shop? Go see Lester. - Your husband? - Yes. - About? - The shop's a good investment. - I'll tell him. - Hey, I'm a star. - George. - Hey, baby. Say hello to Felicia. I already did. - When can we talk? - I'm working now. - I have an important decision to make. - About what? - Whether or not to go. - Go where? - Egypt! - Did they offer you a job yet? No! But I think they might. I'll be right back. - Is she the one with the ulcer? - I don't know. - They didn't offer you the job? - I still want your opinion. - Can we talk after work? - I never know when that is. Neither do I, baby. Know what Lillian Bercovici did after I sprayed her? She touched and played with it! I don't know what it is! - She's heavy. You gotta take it. - I can't stand her. Jill? - Shit. - She all right? - She's fine. - You would be a good investment. - Great. - Otherwise, I wouldn't tell Lester. - You really mean it? - Yes. I mean it or I wouldn't say it. Dennis, doesn't Felicia looks great? - Great. - Great. Yeah? I don't care whether the fish lay eggs in the Baltic. I want beluga caviar! Call Chasen's. Call Jurgenson's. I don't care how much it costs-- How much? Well, then spend it. Be sure it's there tonight. You gotta do everything yourself! Felicia says you're a good hairdresser. Well, yeah. - She says you're fabulous. - Thank you. I didn't say it. She did. How did you get into that... ...line of work? I went to beauty school. You go to beauty school and get your operator's license. You graduate and you're a hairdresser. It's an unusual trade. The important thing is you're successful at it. - In a way, but I-- - What's this? - The chairs from Mr. Russell. - He calls that wholesale? We've had it with him. - I'm better than my boss. - That's very good, George. Wonderful that you want to do something. Thank you. I usually don't get into personal services. Too hard to monitor. If you don't watch your operators they'll steal. - Am I right or not? - You're right. Who needs that aggravation? - When I come home from work-- - Sorry, but I have to have that key. - What key? - I've been ringing. The door's locked. The man from Sloan's is coming-- How did you lose it? George, this is Jackie. Hi. I mean, hello. We've met. - Is that right? - George is a terrific hairdresser. That's what I hear. - How's Norman? - Great. - Who's doing your hair? - Oh, nobody much. George wants to open a shop. No kidding. Your own shop? George, will you excuse us a moment, please? - Out, please. - Yeah. I called to tell you I was sending it over, but the line was busy. You're always on the phone. My secretary saw you talking to that boy. - Steve? - Whatever his name is. That actor. Steve Slutes couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy. Then you were talking to him? I ran into him at the 76 station. Should I have hidden? I was talking to him. You never let me see anybody. I can't even bring my girlfriends to the house. You're even jealous of the dogs. I have to talk to somebody, don't I? I'm not jealous of the dogs. I'm not jealous of anybody. I can't afford to get caught off base. I can't talk to some broken actor. Think I'll tell him I'm screwing you? Of course not. - That's not very logical. - It is logical. It's the most logical thing. You'd feel better if we go out with people and have conversations. Yes? How about starting with tonight? Look, sweetheart. I know it's tough. But my business involves handling money for touchy people. Politics and so forth. Felicia's in a very difficult period in her life. Any divorce and settlement and so forth and... ...my finances would have to be looked into. - Your touchy investors. - You do well for people, you don't stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money. Not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share. You're lying about one thing. - What's that? - You're still jealous. God, you're a doll. I'll work something out about tonight. I promise. I promise. Give me the key to Beaumont. Come on. I'll walk you down. Felicia's very interested in your shop. You may not think $15,000 means much to me, but... ...but I invest for others as well. - We'll need to talk more. - When? When? - Well, how about tonight? - Tonight? Contributors are coming over to the bistro to watch the returns. It's a pain in the ass, but I have to do it. - We'll have time to talk there. - Great. That's great. Maybe on your way over you could pick up Jackie here. It's good you want to do something. I wish my son knew what he wanted. Anything, something. Maybe beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll. - Jesus. - Yeah. Your car down here? I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo. - She can come with us. - I don't want her to. All right. - You serious about the shop? - Are you with Lester? - I asked you first. - I'm never serious. - How long you had this? - About six weeks. - I won't go tonight. - Honey, please-- - Does he know we went together? - Never came up. Tell him. Then I'll take you. You'd do this for any other girl. - I'm not gonna be a beard for you. - Why? It's against your principles? I wonder what you do for his wife. I don't fuck for money. I do it for fun. I'll do whatever you want. You know that. - Sometimes, George... - Want me to do your hair? Oh, no. - I don't know. What do you think? - Oh, boy. George, you can't leave me... Stop by the shop. I'll see what I can do. Gold closed $43 an ounce. At the bell, the Dow Jones Industrial closed at 946.23, off 218... ...volume 16 million shares. One of the most active stocks, Texaco... ...853/4, down 1/2, Sears 681/4, up 1/4, Polaroid 1091/4. Atlantic Richfield, tipped 1/4 to 1021/2. No, I tried that stuff. You know I always burn. The dermatologist gave me that stuff and it gave me a rash. Well, that's fine for you. No, you have different skin than me. All right, I'll try it. - Do you think George is a fairy? - Who? That kid. The hairdresser. Well, I don't know for sure. He is a hairdresser. Thank you, Mona. Maybe he's just kooky and likes kooky things. Maybe. Why do you ask? I'm thinking of investing. But he worries me. Why? Maybe he's flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy. I don't know. He's a hairdresser. You suggested it. Think it's a good idea? - Yes, but I thought, you know... - What? I thought you were indulging me. You indulge me. No, doll. I listen to you. If the deal doesn't make any money, that's not too bad. If handled right. He's a nice boy. I invited him tonight. Just sorry he's a fairy. What do you think? Doctor Feldman says it's normal. What's that? Postnatal frigidity. But with me it's really... This guy expected me to jump into bed. I've got to feel something tender or whatever. - I must know somebody. - George, line two. Line two, George. Hi. I'd like to, Jackie, but I told you to stop by the shop. Chicken salad. Okay, but I got to be in Bel Air by 4. Ask Ricci if he'd wind up Anjanette for me. There's still too much red. No, it's great. Sorry, I got to split. I can't do anyone else. I have an appointment. Ricci, it's not a dye job. - Why can't you finish? - What's wrong? - George can't finish her. - I don't care. You don't comb Mrs. Karpf till 4. Why can't you finish it? - I'm busy till 4. - Doing what? - Whatever I feel like. - And whenever you feel like it. It's all right. Shut up. Hi. Come on in. - You like a drink or something? - No, thanks. Well, I would. Nice place. Where do you want to do this? - You got a bathroom? - Can't we do it in here? - What will you do? - I'd cut it. - Cut it? - Yes, I think so. - You don't seem too sure. - I'm sure. - You don't like it? - It makes you look like a hooker. What a terrible thing to say. What do you want me to do? Lie to you? I'd cut it. I have to look great tonight. I have to look absolutely great. Hello. Oh, hi. Just a second. How are you? How about what? I can't. You can't really come up here, Johnny. Well, it might be difficult, but it's not impossible. I don't want short hair. Not too much off, eh? What's the matter? - Everything's great. - Great? - Good. - Good? - It's not bad. - Not bad is not great. I lied a little. - It isn't even good. - I lied a lot. Oh, stop it, you silly. It's hot in here. It's the steam room. Lester likes it on in case he wants to use it. Mona. Mona, Mona, Mona! I need you. This earring. Will you try to find the other one? When George comes, tell him to wait. I have to pick up a dress, but be sure to tell him to wait. I have to go to the market. Make sure he doesn't leave. It's important. The guy at the bank thought I was a hippie. I did it to myself. He didn't know a good thing when he saw one. - Jill's gonna be mad. - She won't. - What are you doing? - You'll see. Jill absolutely adores you. Remember Myrna Lynn? She adored me. Then she called me a hairdresser, and took off with some agent. Jill is 20 times the girl Myrna is. - Exactly. - What does that mean? I don't know. You can sense these things. What? She needs to be with somebody who can take care of her. --closed down at 48. AT&T at 57, off. RCA, 463/4, off. Revlon, 83, up 1/2. Shell Oil 68, off. What about Felicia? - What about her? - Did you? - Did I what? - Come on. Can't wait to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room. Well, did you or didn't you? Can't stand to miss one of them, can you? Oh, George. Shit. Yeah. Oh, you're a genius. You're a genius. You're a genius. Oh, no, baby. No. No, baby, no. - I want to. I want to. - No, no. Baby, no. No, no, really. - Sorry. - Don't ruin it. It's gonna ruin everything. Jesus Christ! - Honey! - My God, it's Lester. - Get up. Get up. Get up! - Hello? - Jackie? - Oh, God. Do something, please. Baby, you sleeping? Jackie? Jackie? Shut the door, honey. - Come on. - Oh. Sorry. - Come in or stay out. - Shut the door. You think this is a picnic? Just don't let the steam out. Hey, Jackie? I brought you a little something, doll! - You look like you had a workout. - Women can get you very upset. - I know. - This doing hair, it's... I know you're in the middle, but if you'd bear with me tonight-- Oh, hey... No, it's a difficult situation. I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be very, very tough on me. - I don't know... - But we'll do business, son, I... I can tell you that. I'll clean up or the dogs will get it all over. What have you been doing? You should get rid of them. They get hair all over. They're Yorkies, and they don't shed. - Aren't you having a drink? - No. - Why not? - I don't want one. Have a drink. It's 5:00. I don't want one. You tell me not to drink, then to drink. Which is it? I don't want a drink. I called to tell you I was coming but the line was busy. You're always on the phone. - You here to see my mother? - Yeah, did-- She's out. You're supposed to wait. Nobody's home up there. Maybe... Are you hungry? Yeah, a little. This is the one thing I like about this house. - Want some lox? - No, thanks. You're my mother's hairdresser. I do hair, yeah. - Chopped liver? - No, thanks. Are you gay? Want a baked apple? They're cold, but good. No, thanks. Did you hear me? Yeah. - Well, are you? Are you queer? - Sure. - Are you or not? - This is great. Tell me. Don't be afraid. - Why do you want to know so bad? - See if you're making it with my mom. Why would it have anything to do with that? Nothing, I guess. - Have you ever made it with a guy? - You ever make it with a girl? - Are you? - What are you talking about? Making it with my mother? I'd love to do your hair sometime. Do you like older women? That's sort of faggoty, isn't it? I never get my hair done. I've never been to a beauty salon in my whole life. - You think that's funny, don't you? - Yeah. Beverly Hills hairdresser. You might as well be a faggot. You think that's funny too? - No. No. No. - Then what do you think? I think you got exactly the same eyes as your mother. - Your chin's a bit like hers too. - No, it isn't. No. - My eyes aren't like hers either. - They are. I'm nothing like my mother. I'm not trying to insult you. Can't we just be friends? Okay. You want to fuck? - Can I ask you something? - Sure. As long as you don't ask me what sign I am. - Are you married? - Sometimes. But not at the moment. Would you like to go to a party? George. George. Lorna, have you seen George, by any chance? - My hairdresser. - He's in the bathroom. He's in the bathroom. - He's in your bathroom? - Yeah. Hello, George. I should be dry by now. - George, come here. - What? - You dry? - No, don't comb my hair out. - I'll do it now. - Do it later, for heaven's sake. - I'm so glad you'll be there tonight. - What? I'm so glad you're going to be there tonight. - Right here? - Right here. I don't care. I don't care. - I'd better get-- - I don't want to. - Where's your car? - A friend dropped me off. - Who? - Never mind. I'm going tonight. Jackie asked me. - I need you to fix my hair. - She'll pick us up pretty soon. I'm going with somebody else. By the way, you never said how it went this morning. Okay. - Are they gonna give you the loan? - Well... I don't even know why I ask. The only way you'll get money out of a bank is to rob one. - What are so mad about? - Just fix my hair. You go to Jackie's. What about my hair? - She asked me. - You do whatever anybody asks? I'm always at the end of the line. - I'll do your hair. - Stop kissing everybody's ass. That won't put you in business. - I'm trying to get things moving. - Grow up. You never stop moving, you never go anywhere. Grow up! Grow up! - Honey, I'm sorry. - You're right. I just want us to have a normal life, like everybody else. Jesus, I just can't take it anymore. All I want is to get up early, run my own business... ...take you out to a movie on the weekend. I'm trying, honey. I just can't get out of my own way. I know. I know, honey. I'm so sorry. Honey, come on, we don't have much time. Sure. What do you know about this guy? He's a director. - You've heard of him? - Sure. Movies or television? Commercials. Make you feel better? - Thought it might. - Commercials. - Who is it? - Oh, it's nobody. - There's Norma Stern. Look at her hair. - George. Looks like someone took a dump in it. - You've been chipping on me. - I know. Isn't it awful? - We're upstairs, come on. - Excuse me. Don't let me drink too much. You don't do that anymore, do you? Good evening. Check your coat? Your coat. Can I take this? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. In case she wants it back. What would you like to drink? - I'll have a stinger. - Before dinner? I don't know. What do you think? Why don't you try something? Waiter? - Yes, sir? - A white dubonnet on the rocks. - And for you? - A little white wine. A little white wine. And...? I'll have a Coke. - Soda with a twist. - Yes, sir. - Glad you could make it. - Thank you. - Hi, doll. - Lester, this is my friend Jill. - Hello. - Glad to know you, Jill. - And this is-- - Johnny Pope. - Mr. Pope. - Hello. Who are they? I've told you about Jill a hundred times. You never listen. - Does she know about us? - Jesus, she's my best friend. I need to find room for them. Who's the guy? George's boyfriend? - I don't know. Ask him. - Jackie, I'm only-- Keep an eye on Jackie. She's a bit high-strung. See she doesn't drink too much. See you later, doll. - How does she know Lester Karpf? - I don't know. Why? Well, I just wouldn't want him mad at me, that's all. George. How are you? This is Jackie. Jackie, say hello to Felicia. Hello, Felicia. I'm so glad that you could make it. I've been looking forward to seeing you all evening. Ohio is nothing to worry about. I don't know. What the fuck do you think you're doing? - Jesus Christ, I'm sorry. - Never mind. I'll do it. Why didn't you come alone? Did you have to bring her? She's a friend of Jill's. Who is Jill? She's a friend of Johnny Pope's, the director. --14,000 to 672,000. That leaves California, the big one. NBC News now projects Nixon to win in South Carolina. Jackie. Jackie. Excuse me, I know you, but I can't remember where. - Bruce Barton's? - Excuse me. Come with me. That other couple we're with. Do you know them well? Why? Why? Maybe you know why George went into the ladies' room. George? --in our administration the American flag will not be a doormat... - Let me out. - No, it's boring. - You'll get us killed. - It's boring. - Come here. - What? Come here! - Come here, you. - What do you want to do? Listen, you both have tidelands. You both want Uncle Sam to give you drilling permits. Do it together. - Am I right? - You're right. That son of a bitch. Everything he says is phony. Does he think I'm some cigar butt between his teeth? He ignores me. He could've at least introduced me to someone. Couldn't he? You're drunk. Oh, George, what do I want? How about some coffee? Hi, doll. Say, what's wrong? You know what's wrong. Felicia. There you are. We were just-- You know George. And... - Jackie Shawn. - Jackie Shawn. Yeah, my wi-- Felicia. We've met. Anyway... Your hair looks just fabulous. - It's George. - Just fabulous. - Wonder if he could do mine? - I could try. Do you wash your hair every day? - Isn't that bad? - No, it's very good. The skin has to peel, or else the follicles can't breathe. That's how you lose your hair. Remember, the follicle never dies. This here ought to be layered. - Layered? - Yeah. Otherwise it lies there and if you layer it, it fluffs it out... Everybody's ready for dinner. Did they sit down? - We don't know where to sit. - They're waiting for you. Waiter. One word out of you and I'll gargle with it. You should've seen those kids, senator. Forty of them, all blind. We put mattresses on the lawn. They came stumbling out of the house. Having a good time. They were blind, of course. But it gave me a feeling of accomplishment. I had such a good time. - Aren't you hungry? - Not for rubber chicken. Maybe I can get you something. That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth. - Sid. - Sid. You must be a very important executive. Whatever I am, I can get you whatever you'd like. You do? - Whatever I'd like? - Whatever you'd like. Most of all... ...I'd like to suck his cock. Where is the school located again? - The other side of Santa Barbara. - Curious to see it sometime. I can't stand it. It's killing me. Come on. Why not? Come on. You don't want to? - Who's the greatest cocksucker? - You are. Fucking A! Excuse me, senator. Your friend feeling under the weather? You phony asshole! Oh, dear. Too bad. - Get her out of here. - I'll go. - What was that? - Illinois. Oh, good. - I have to take her out of here. - Okay. - Take her home. - Aren't you--? I'll see you later. Johnny'll take me home. - Your coat. - Fuck it! We won't get a winner tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, I have been awarded the privilege... ...of introducing our guest of honor tonight. Are you all right? I'm just fine. Thanks. --for the people, for the country... ...for our Constitution. - Lester. - Sweetheart, please. I hope you like Miss Shawn. What? She's very nice, yeah. I mean, normally she's-- Because she's going to be very expensive. Sweetheart, can't we go into this later? No. No, we cannot go into this later. Well, that's okay too. --Senator Joe East. - I've blown it with Lester. - I don't think so. - I thought you were great. - You always say that. And I really care for Lester, don't I? Where should we go? Sammy's? - Is he still having parties? - He never stopped. This tells the story of the ancient grandmother... ...who upon seeing the garden gate of her childhood... ...stops for a moment and says, "" Hello, garden gate. Hello, garden gate. Garden gate, hello."" Be straight with me, Lester. Just be straight with me for once in your life. This party involves more than you and me. These people care about more than each other. - Is that right? - That's right. Some of us are trying to make this country a better place. Is that what it's all about? Yes, that's what it's all about. It's a beautiful thing he's doing. I recall another ancient song. My God, Lester. You're a miserable human being. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for selfish sons of bitches. You think your business partner will keep his hands off your girl? Or that she's gonna keep her hands off him? - What do you mean? - Think what you have time to think. Excuse me, senator. Ladies and gentlemen, evacuate this room quietly... ...and quickly. There's nothing to worry about. Exit through the door on my right... ...continue down the stairs, into the street. For God's sake! You don't have to entertain me. - Am I entertaining you? - We're friends. Sure. Go play. There's a lot of players here. - George. Hey, how are you doing? - What's happening? - You look good. - Come on down to the jacuzzi. - We're going there now. - No, no, I can't. - What's the problem? - His car is blocked. That's no problem. - Gene, you want to move that truck? - Sure. Thank you. Could you kids give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded. - Sure. Yeah. Come on. - Good. You all right, son? I will be, as soon as I can find my keys. I'll get in the back. - No, no. - It's so little. You see, nothing to it. - What was your name, sweetheart? - Jill. Jill. Yeah, Jill. - That's wonderful, Jill. - Thank you. Just wonderful. Hi, what are we doing? Mr. Karpf needed a ride home. I said we'd take him. Do you mind? Of course not. Call me Les. Where to, Les? Would you kids like to stop off for a drink? We'd love to, but we're going to another party. That's wonderful. I'll stop off there for a drink. You never were a tit man, were you? Ass and legs. Look who's talking. Do you know why I used to get so angry with you? I wouldn't settle down. Because you're always so happy... ...about everything. I was? I found it rather unrealistic. Your type. Very nice. - You want children? - I don't think about it. There's so much to do and so many places to go while I'm still free. You know, unattached. We're kidding ourselves. We are? You know, last night I had a dream. I was 50 years old... ...and I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. Boy, it scared the hell out of me. Why? I can't imagine being with Jill when I'm 50. I can't imagine not being with you. When do you go to Egypt? Two weeks from tomorrow. Same time you do. You're kidding. Really? I don't know how to say this. Would you like to come home with me? - Hi. - Hi. Come on in. Yeah? Why not? We shouldn't leave that poor man here alone. Les? He won't care. I know. But let's go tell him we're leaving. What is it, man? - Where can I get a towel? - By the tennis court. Thanks. That's what I call fucking. Am I right or am I right? Come on, Les. Let's get out of here. Oh, my God! You bastard! Where have you been? We've been looking for you. You son of a bitch! - Jill? - Oh, God! Baby? Jesus, what shall I do? I better get her. Wait here. Jill! Jill! Honey! Jill! Jackie! Honey? Shit. Jackie! Jackie! Jill? This is George Roundy. I left a message earlier for Jackie. Has she picked it up yet? No, just tell her I called twice. Thank you. - Want me to come in with you? - No. I'll call you in a few minutes. I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight either. I'm sorry. Bullshit. - Why didn't he come in? - I didn't want him to. I hope he doesn't mind me. Did you get a job out of it? I'd like you to leave now. And take this with you. - Where did this come from? - Who knows? I'm sure you don't. But if it'll help any, I found it in your bed. Obviously there were others. Weren't there? Obviously. - How many? - Why? - Because I want to know. - What's the difference? I don't want girls knowing and me not knowing. - Don't do this. - It'll help me. - It'll help me. - How? I'll know that you've lied to me all along. I'll know that you're incapable of love, and that'll help me. If it'll do any good. I just-- You really want to know? Yes. There were a couple-- I mean there-- Let's face it. I fucked them all. That's what I do. That's why I went to beauty school. They're always there, and I-- I don't know why I'm apologizing. So sometimes I fuck them. I go into that shop and they're so great-looking. I do their hair. They feel and smell great. I'd be on the street... ...at a stoplight, or go into an elevator. There's... ...a beautiful girl. I don't know. That's it. It makes my day. It makes me feel like I'm gonna live forever. As far as I'm concerned with what I'd liked to have done in my life... I know I should've accomplished more but I have no regrets. I mean... Maybe that means I don't love them. Maybe it means I don't love you. Nobody's gonna tell me I don't like them very much. Jesus. I'm glad you told me. I wish you'd go now. Hi. No, everything's fine, really. How long have you been here? All night. You live like a pig. Yeah. Hal, wait outside. Having lost eight years ago and won this year, I can say... ...that winning's a lot more fun. Who are those guys? What do they look like? You unhappy about something, Lester? Sit down. - Now wait a minute-- - I said sit down. Either you admit it, or I'll see they pound it out of you. - They do it well. - Okay. I want to know about it. - Jesus. - I want to know how you think. Have them put me away, or whatever... Do you get your kicks by taking advantage of people? - Trying to be anti-establishment? - I'm not anti-establishment. - You have something against me? - You think I planned it? Jackie, Felicia. Did they have something against me? - They could be pissed about something. - Tell me. I don't know what they've got against you. They're women, right? Ever listen to women talk? I do till it's running out my ears. They only talk about one thing: How some guy fucked them over. That's all that's on their minds. That's all I ever hear about. I follow your thinking on that. They know we're always trying to nail them. They don't like it. They like it and they don't like it. It's got nothing to do with you. It just happened. Felicia just shops, gets her hair done. - She's aging. Her daughter hates her. - Wait a minute. You think Lorna hates her? - She may resent her a little, but-- - Are you kidding? She hates her. Why? - I mean, why is that? - How would I know? I don't know. You want a drink? No, thanks. - Oh, have a drink. - Okay. Thanks. There ain't a clean glass here. Jesus Christ. What a way to live. I never lived like this, even at your age. Not even when I never had a dime. It's a hell of a way to treat a business partner. - Who? - Me. - You weren't gonna give me the money. - I was gonna give you the money. Probably, I would've. Shit, I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. But you never know. One minute, you're here, the next-- I just wish I knew what the hell I was living for. A teenager held up the sign, ""Bring Us Together""... ...and that will be the great objective... ...of this administration at the outset. To bring the American people together. This will be an open administration. You can lose it all, no matter who you are. Why have it all? Market went down 10 points last week. Goddamn Lyndon Johnson! Yeah, well... ...maybe Nixon will be better. What's the difference? They're all a bunch of jerks. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know what's right or wrong. At least you do what you want. But me? I'm shit. What about Jackie? Never mind. She's a whore. I go over, have drinks, get my gun off. I'm through with her. She's a whore. You could call everybody a whore. She really likes you. It's not just the bread. - You think so? - Yes, I do. No, I'm through with her. By the way, you want me to say hello to Lorna for you? What the hell, go easy on him. Just having a little fun. Come on, Hal. Let's go home. Listen. I'll call you tomorrow about the shop. Christ, I'm beat. Devra, call Jackie Shawn. Keep trying till you get her. Mrs. Schumann and Mrs. Young are waiting for you. She's on the Rolodex. Will you get her? Sorry. - Where's Mary? - She's with Norman. I asked you to call Jackie. Do it. - Mary will have to wash-- - Not today. What are you talking about? What's going on here? I'm not the shampoo girl. Can you give me a little help? - What's wrong with Norman? - Settle down. His son was killed. - Killed? - Car accident. Near Oceanside... ...on his way back to Pendleton. It was foggy and a truck jumped the divider on the freeway. Lord, have mercy. Just a minute. Almost ready. Where you going? - Oh! You'll have to go. - I gotta leave? - Honey, you have to get out of here. - Why? Lester's on his way. - Where are you going? - We'll talk about it later. - Honey, about last night-- - Oh, forget about it. It's okay. - We'll talk when I get back. - I want to talk now. - Where you going? - You leave, or I will. I don't want the two of us here when Lester comes. That's him. - It's a cleaner. - Fine. I'm leaving! Honey. Cleaners. You're gonna kill me. What are you trying to do? I want you to marry me. I want to take care of you. I want you to have a baby with me. I'm a fuck-up, but I'll take care of you. I'll make you happy. What do you think? It's too late. We're not dead yet. That's the only thing that's too late. Lester's left Felicia. We're going to Acapulco today. He's asked me to marry him. Honey. Honey, please. Please, honey. I don't trust anybody but you. Baby. - Lester's at the house. - Don't go, honey. Please don't. I have to go. I can't just leave him standing there. I have to go. The puppies are in the car. I can't think of anything else, so why don't we just take off? Okay?, It has to be from downtown. It's handled through this office, but it requires downtown approval. I don't know. It has been submitted. Sylvia, can you help me with this? Coming. Closing time. Going in? - Yes, sir. - Okay. I couldn't say. - You the manager? - It's a matter of policy. It... It looks... Keep talking like nothing was wrong. Listen, let me call you back. Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes. What are you talking about? Maybe we should take something smaller, Sonny. You crazy? He started already. He's got the gun out. Go on, go over by the door. Get over by the door. Freeze! - Nobody move. - Get over there! Okay. All right, get away from those alarms. Come on, get in the center. He moves, take his head off. Put the gun on him! Get out of the center. Sonny. I can't do it, Sonny. - What? - I'm not gonna make it. - What? Put it on him. - I can't do it, Sonny. Oh, fuck me. Sal. - What? - Where are you? He can't make it. Fuck him. Let him go! Come on, Sonny! All right, let him out. - Let him out! - Do what the gentleman says, Howard. Let him out! I'm sorry, Sonny. Oh, shit. - Stevie, don't take the car. - How do I get home? Take the subway. We need the car. Stevie, the keys. - I'm sorry, Sonny. - Right. All right, lock it. Shit. - What do you want? - Sonny, there's a girl under that desk. All right, go. We got rid of him. So now we just move it along. - Sal, you got them? - I got them. Okay. What'd he say to me? Wait a minute. Anybody here? What's this, a squirrel? Hey, you. Come on. Go ahead. In the back there. No one's gonna hurt you. Go ahead, get to the back. - Pull the drapes! - Howard. Now, you, to the back there. Go to him, right there. Okay. We're gonna move this now. Just moving along. Come on. Gotcha. Gotcha. We're moving right along, folks. Gonna get this thing done in half an hour. We just gotta block... Oh, shit. Here. Knock out the TV. There we go. See? No replay, folks. No alarms. Let's get you all fixed up and on your way. - Right. Is the vault open? - I can take care of that. That's good. Let's go. Take care of it. Hey, wait a minute. What are you trying to do? Trip the alarm? Use the spot key? - I must've been out of my mind. - You get your mind right! I'm a Catholic. I don't wanna hurt anybody, understand? - Yes, sir. - No alarms. - No alarms! - Okay. No games, all right? Use the other one. Miriam... ...open the safe. It's all right. It's all right. Here. Put it in this. What? That's all there is. What are you talking about? They picked it up today. There's only $ 1,100. - It's true. - He's gonna shoot me. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. There's no money here. - Come on, Sonny, let's do it! - I'm doing it! Too much. This is too much. This is too much. All right, come on. Let's go. Somebody... You answer it. Watch him, Sal. You, come with me. Watch him. - Sit down. - Who's the head teller here? - I am. - Come here. All right, open it up. Nope, not all of it. Look, I worked in a bank. I know the alarms. All right? Don't play games with me. See. You take one of these, go like this... ...in here, and out it comes. You got your 100. I'll call you back. No, it's decoy money. It's marked. It's shit. See? Cheer up, you'll be the veterans of a robbery. You know the bank sends you a dozen red roses? Sal, let him answer it. Hey, you. Manager. Fucker! Don't get ideas. I bark, that man there, he bites. - Believe me, I'm on your side. - On my side, shit. Listen, we got young girls here. You could watch your language. I speak what I feel. ""Watch my language."" Empty the drawer out. I don't know. You'd have to find out from him. Traveler's checks... ...and the register. The register. You've got it. All right, let's go. I'll take that from you. All right, Sal, here we go. Shit. Come on. - Shit. - Sonny, what the hell are you doing? I'm burning the register here. Moving right along, folks. All right. Okay. We're leaving. Let me have the keys. Howard, give him the keys. - Come on. - Howard. Nobody's gonna hurt you. We're gonna leave. Sonny. Who's that? It's the insurance guy from across the street. He probably saw the smoke. Please, put out the fire. - I'll get some water. - Stay right there! No, no, please, don't...! Don't do it! - I'm call you back later. - Get rid of him. - Come on, get rid of him! - Howard. Howard. - Use your head. - I can handle it. - Everything's all right? - Cigarette butt got in the wastebasket. - Well, then you're okay. - Yeah. Thanks for keeping an eye out. Okay. - Good. - Go now. We gave you all we've got. Okay, we're going. Answer the phone. Sal, get them in the vault. Come on, in the vault. - Where's the money? - I'm getting it. Got it. He's gonna come with us. Okay. No, please don't close that door. How can we breathe? - I can't explain. I'll call... - Right. Wait a minute. - Wait a minute. Listen. - What? I will never make this. I'll have to go to the toilet. Honey, it's no joke. I got a terrible fear of being locked in. - Who has to go to the bathroom? - I do too. - See, now they all wanna go. - Look, do you wanna check it out? It's the first door on your right. All right, Mouth, let's go. First door on my right. It's Maria! Listen, I... I forgot she's in there. It's not her fault. She's always pulling this. She's supposed to have 10 minutes... ...she takes 15... - Shut up! Nobody goes to the bathroom. - Let's go, out. - We're having a bank robbery. Mulvaney speaking. All right, Mouth. Mouth. - Here's your toilet. - It's for you. - What? - Telephone call. For you. Yeah. - What are you doing in there? - Who's this? Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti, asshole. We got you by the balls. I'm looking you right in the eye. Right now I can see you. - Who is it? - Cops. You come to the front door... Hang it up. Get on the side of the street. Come on, let's go. How'd that happen? Did I do anything to hurt you? Did I treat you badly? - Look at my salary. I won't be a hero. - Did you have a plan or what? What did you do, just barge in on a whim? - Why'd you have to light a fire? - I told you to get out... ...when you could, but you had to hang around. He don't have a plan. It's all a whim. - Rob a bank, right? - I had it planned! Only the money should have been delivered, not taken away. That fucking Jack, downtown, he gave me the wrong information. That fuck! What is this Jack supposed to be? A mastermind or what? I wouldn't be arguing with me. We're all in a barrel together and we wanna get out of it. All right, I gotta have time to think. I gotta think. Oh, shit. Listen, bastards. You keep away, or we'll start throwing bodies out... ...one at a time. Got that? Who is this? There a Jenny here? - Who's Jenny here? - That's me. It's the squirrel. You got a husband? Yeah? Well, he's on the phone. Go ahead. Well, what could I tell him? I don't know, tell him whatever. Tell him the truth. What a fucking comedy. W-N-E-W, plays all the hits. Listen. Now, don 't hang up. - First off, is anybody hurt in there? - No. Keep away, or we'll start throwing bodies out, one at a time. You got that? Don't do that. Let me talk to you for a while. How many people you got? No, call me back. - Call me back. - Excuse me. He said he wants to know what time you'll be through. What? Oh, girlie, please. Come on. Let's go. - Where's the back door? - It's locked on the inside. Where is it? Through the passageway to the right. Sal, cover them, cover them. You could just go ahead and cook whatever's there. Ready for riot gang. 3- 4, sergeant. 3- 4, sergeant. Is that roof...? - Negative. - Tell units preset. Oh, yes, I will. Yes, I will. - Let's go, come on. - Honey, I've gotta go now. I gotta go. I love you too. All right, inside here. Sal, I don't know what happened. Maybe somebody tripped an alarm or something. I don't know. - But there's a way out of this. - Listen. - Were you serious about what you said? - About what? About throwing... About throwing those bodies out the door? - That's what I want him to think. - I wanna know what you think. Because I'll tell you right now, I'm ready to do it. Right. Okay. - I mean it. I mean it. - I know. All right. Listen, everybody. I know we got a problem here, right? But there's a way out of this thing. I'm telling you. All you gotta do is cooperate with me. Stay cool, and we'll get out of this, all right? Nobody gets hurt if you listen to me. First, we'll do things a step at a time. You gotta go to the bathroom, right? She'll get to go to the bathroom. Everybody who has to go will get to go to the bathroom. We'll do things together. Now, stay cool... What's the matter with him? He's got asthma. - Asthma? - Yeah, asthma. Asthma. Shit. All right, I'll take care of that. - You, what's your name? - Mulvaney. Mulvaney? Come with me. - He's got asthma and he's a guard? - They go to guard school. To learn what, how to shoot? He doesn't have a gun. They earn a $ 105 a week to fold the flag in the morning... ...straighten up. I don't know what they learn. All right, I wanna block that door. In case they try coming in, I can hear it. All right. Let's move this. Wait a minute. Hold it, hold it. Let's get rid of this. You got kids? I got 2 kids and I'd like to see them again. You'll see them again. You're being cooperative with me. I got no complaints against you, whatsoever. Whatsoever. You got bank insurance? You know I do. You seem to know a lot about bank procedure. I know a lot about a lot of things. I just wanna get you out of here safe, right? What if I take you with me? If you take anybody... ...please take me. They'll shoot you, you know? The cops... ...don't care about bank insurance. See what they did in Attica? Forty-two people, they killed. The innocent with the guilty. Anyway... I won't take you. I'll take one of them girls, a married one with kids. Cops don't like it in the papers when they shoot a married woman with kids. You're all right. You won't fuck with me, will you? Come on, set a car. - Help with those barricades. - Move them back. There's the FBI. How you doing, Sheldon? Why didn't you wait and try to take them outside? I made an error in judgment. Thought the S.O.B. S would be remorseful at the sight of a policeman. And you know something? Nobody said ""hostage"" yet, understand? - We have a bank robbery here. - Yeah. How did the press guys get through the barrier? We don't know what's up yet. We're setting up communications. This is Ron Cummins from CBS. Can you tell me the situation? We got the... We're setting up communications now. The perpetrators are in the bank. That's all I can say now. When I get it, you'll get it. That's all. Okay. What are you doing on the fire escape? I said on the roof. Now, get up on the roof, will you? - Get the phone company? - It's being set up now. This phone is gonna be a direct line into the bank. - Mulvaney speaking. - Moretti here. Let me talk to him. - Yeah. - Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti. - Yeah. - Okay... ...you're in there, we're out here. What do we do? - I don't know. What do we do? - Listen. - Are the people in the bank okay? - They're okay. - You alone or you got confederates? - I'm not alone. - I got Sal. - Sal, what's that for, Salvatore? Yeah. Sal, he's a killer. We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us. - In the Army? - In the Army, yeah. - So there's you, what's your name? - Why do you wanna know my name? Give me any name. Just so I got something to call you. Let's be reasonable, okay? Just give me your name. Call me Sonny. - Sonny? - Yeah. Okay. Now listen, Sonny. I wanna see if the people are okay. - Right. - Yeah. Then I wanna work out a way to get them out of there. I wanna come over without a gun. You can frisk me so you can trust me. We'll find a way out of this. Right. I just wanna find some way that I can trust you too. Not be on the street where you could just shoot me. - Some sign, right? - Right. Like what? How about letting the people out? Come on, now. Who do you think you're dealing with? A fucking idiot here? They're keeping me alive. I'm gonna let them out? Talk to me. Just talk to me straight. I'm ready to talk. Okay, okay. How about giving us the women? No, I've got women. That's all I've got here. Okay. Give me something. Give me one of them. - Why do you want one? - It's like a fair exchange. - I'll come over. I won't pack nothing. - Yeah? I don't know if you'll take me hostage. It's a sign of trust. - How do I call you back? - We got a direct line here. Pick up the receiver and I'm here. He wants one. - Him, right? - Right. - Right? - Right. - Okay? He goes. - Okay. Can you get up? What are we dealing with here? Hey, you have to keep checking me out all the time? Yeah. - Here you are. Your stomach okay? - It's all right. He'll need the keys. Got the keys? - Just the one, Sonny! - Right. - Hey, don't fire! Don't fire! - What are you doing? - Get away from him! - That's a hostage! - Don 't fire, don 't fire. Hold your fire. - Hold your fire! We voted to send him out! - He's one of the hostages! - Get away from him! - What's the matter with you? - He's a hostage! He's one of the hostages. What the hell's the matter with you? I don't give a fuck, goddamn it! Get away. Get out of here. Hey, Sonny! Wait a minute, Sonny. That was your fault, Sonny. You know we had the communications set up here. We're not set up properly. We've got 250 cops here. We don't know what's going on in there. - You almost killed him! Are you crazy? - That was smart. You say you got nothing but women, and throw out a guy. What's going on? You wanted a hostage, I gave you one. - You gonna deal with us or not? - I gave you one. You did, but you should have picked up the phone. Come on out. Look. I ain't packing nothing, see? I ain't packing nothing. You can come out and frisk me. You can tell. - Why you want me to come out? - To look at something. - To see what you're up against. - I can see it. Why come out? Come out and see it all, all right? Come on. All right? Sal is in there with the other people. Anything happens to me, they'll get it. I don't forget about Sal. Come out and look. Okay? Come on. Okay? - I gotta check with him first. - All right. You don't need that artillery. Sonny, five minutes. You tell him that. Take it easy. Get them back. He's got a white flag. All right. Okay. Everything's all right. - See that? - Right, yeah. Okay. - Come on out, Sonny. - He's too close here. Get back! What the fuck are you doing? - Get them back. - Get back! - All right. - Okay. Come on out. Take a look at this. Come on. Here, look. Look up here. Look. Look. Look over here, huh? Over there, right? We got everything here, okay? You got the militia out here, huh? Let Sal come look. What hope have you got? Come on. Quit while you're ahead. - It's only attempted robbery. - Armed robbery. All right, armed, then. Nobody's been hurt. Release the hostages. No one will worry over kidnapping charges. The most you'll get is 5 years. - You'll get out in one year. - Kiss me. - What? - Kiss me. When I'm being fucked, I like to get kissed on the mouth. You're a city cop, right? Bank robbery's a federal offense. They got me on kidnapping, armed robbery. They're gonna bury me. I won't talk to somebody trying to con me. - Get someone in charge. - I am in charge. I won't talk to some flunky pig trying to con me. What's he doing? - Get back! - Why are they moving in? Will you get the fuck back there? Get back there. Get over there! - Go on back there, man! - Get over there! He wants to kill me so bad, he can taste it. - No one's gonna kill anybody. - Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Remember Attica! Go ahead. Go ahead. Your word don't fucking matter! Come on, calm down. - To put their guns down! Put your guns down! Wasn't for the TV guys, they'd kill us all. Tell them to put their guns down! Get back! - Put those guns down! - Put the guns down! Get back! Put those fucking guns down! Put those guns down! Put them down! Put them down! Put those fucking guns down. Put those guns down. Attica! Attica! You got it, man! You got it, man! You got it, man! You got it! You got it! You got it, man! You got it, right? You got it, right? You got it. You got it. You got it, right? - Headquarters in Washington... - Robbing a bank? - What was...? What? - As to the identity of one of the men. Why didn't he tell me he needed money? He should've come to me if he needed money. I can't believe it. We know that 8 people are still being held in the bank. The situation inside the bank is totally unknown to us other than... ... descriptions that have been obtained from Howard Calvin. Why steal when your mom's a sucker? We'll switch you now to Ron Cummins at the bank in Brooklyn. Miss Benson, what's it like inside? They're holding up, what can you say? - The guy with the gun on us... - Got a deal? ...he's a quiet type. - Any confidence in Detective Moretti? They don't know Detective Moretti yet. I gotta go now. What's this with the hands? She's out, let her stay out. They're my girls. I'm going back in there. - Howard, how is he? - Howard's all right. - Put the TV on. - Girls, I was interviewed. Sal, looks good. Everybody's out there. They got the whole media. Television people. Television people... ...they wanna talk to you. They're out there. Yeah? Hello, Sonny. Sonny, you're on the air. - Would you answer a few questions? - Yeah. Why are you doing this? - Hello? - See, now... ...I just saw myself there. What'd you...? - Why am I doing it? - Yes. - Doing what? - Robbing a bank. What? I don't know what you mean by that. I'm robbing a bank because they got money here. I mean, why do you feel you have to steal for money? Couldn 't you get a job? No. Doing what? You know... You know, if you want a job, you gotta be a member of a union. See. If you got no union card, you don't get a job. What about non-union jobs? What's wrong with this guy? What do you mean, non-union? Like what, a bank teller? - Know how much a bank teller makes? - Not much. Not much. $ 115 to start, right? You gonna live on that? I got a wife and kids. How am I gonna live on that? What do you make a week? - I'm here to talk to you, Sonny. - No, well, I'm... I'm talking to you. We're entertainment, right? What do you...? What do you got for us? What do you want to get for it? - Do you expect to be paid? - I don't need to be paid. Look. I'm here with my partner and nine other people, see, and we're dying. You're gonna see our brains on the sidewalk. They'll spill our guts out. Gonna show that on television? Have housewives see that? Instead of ""As The World Turns""? What do you got for me? I want something for that. - Sonny. - Yeah. - You could give up. - Give up? - Right. You ever been in prison? - No. No. Let's talk about something you fucking know about, okay? - How much you make a week? - Transmission has been interrupted. Please stand by, we will return to our special newscast very soon. Hello? What the fuck happened? Guess he didn't appreciate your language. Fuck him. Sal. Sal. I don't know, they might deal with us. You know? I mean, I don't know about that guy out there. But if I get the FBI involved in this, they might deal. What do you think? No. - Sal... - No! - What's the matter with you? - You made a promise, didn't you? - Did you promise me something? - Yeah. Did you say either we get away clean or we kill ourselves? - Did you? - I'm not talking about that. - You believe in keeping your promises? - Yeah. - Then does it still go? - Yeah. - Well, what are you talking about? - I'm trying to... I ain't going back to that prison, Sonny. - Yeah. - Kill them all. Now. - Take your bayonet, jam it into their... - Fuck you, you fucker. Shit. We ask for a jet. What do you think? We get a helicopter. We get a helicopter here, it lands on the roof... ...and takes us to a jet. And we fly the fuck out of the country. Sal. Sal... ...we can do it. Sal. Sal, look. We got them. We don't even know it. We got the hostages. We've been looking at this the wrong way. We make the demands. They're gonna give us anything we want. I'm flying to the tropics. Fuck the snow. Hey, where's the Mouth? - You ready to go to Algeria? - Algeria? Yeah, sure. We're all going to sunny climes! Sal, I can make it happen! I can make it happen! I made it happen so far, right? I can make it happen. - Yeah. - Give me Moretti. Sarge. All of you, go ahead, make phone calls. Call home or whatever. We're all going on a trip. - Yeah, Sonny. - Yeah. I wanna talk to you. - And I'm coming out. - Good, I'll be there. Let's go. Come on, he's coming out. Sal. Now, you gotta understand something. If we leave the country, there's no coming back here. There's no coming back. If there's anyone you wanna talk to... ...you wanna say goodbye to, do it now. No. No. Is there any special country you wanna go to? Wyoming. No, Wyoming... That's not a country. That's all right. I'll take care of it. All right, put them down! Put them down. You need a gun? What do I have? See this here, look. I got nothing up my sleeve. I got nothing here either. Wanna see my pockets? Here. You need that gun, right? Yeah. Moretti, tell them to put their guns down! Hey, you, see that? Put it in your holster. Put the guns down! You know what it means to put a gun down? What's this? - What's this? - Put them down. Right. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You got it, right? You got it, baby! Hey, Moretti! You ready to let these...? You got Maria in there! Maria! He's got a gun in there! Maria! Maria! Maria! Get him the fuck out of here! How the hell did that happen? - I got Sal in there! - Take it easy. - Notify the precinct, all right? - Who the fuck is that? No, no, no. He's one of them Spanish kids. - Who's Maria? - She's inside. Sal wants to see Sonny, says he'll shoot unless he does. - Sal. Sal. - He's serious. Sonny, he means it! - He means it. - It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. - Hey, man, I'm sorry. - How'd that happen? You got his girlfriend. You know the Spanish. You okay? That fuck tried to kill me. - You look all squeezed out. - Squeezed out, I'm squeezed out. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Wait, let me see. Let me see your head. - I'm bleeding. - Let me see it. Let me see it. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. It's all right. You want to talk to me about something? You should've heard that phone call. Calls up, some creep, says, ""Kill everybody."" Everybody wants to kill everybody. You're gonna get assholes like that anyhow, right? Right. Yeah, I wanna talk to you. I got an offer. I want a helicopter out of here. And a jet to go wherever I wanna go. So I don't want a little jet, I want a big one. One with a bar, a piano. Maybe I wanna go out of the country. I don't know, Sonny. I don't know whether a helicopter'll fit in here or not. I'll check it out. - It could land on the roof. - No, that's asphalt. You know what'll happen, it'll break through. I'll call my superiors, you understand? Why don't you bring your superiors here? Why am I talking to you if you gotta call your superiors? - We don't always see eye-to-eye. - Yeah, so I'll talk to them. I'll see what they say. I talk to them and I ask them, all right? Then we'll see. Anything else I can give you? Yeah, I want you to bring my wife down here. - What do you give us? - What do you want? The women hostages. Oh, man. You know, there's no talking to you. That's all I got in there, I told you, is women. You gonna talk to me or what? I'll give you one hostage for each thing you give me, see? Give me the helicopter, I give you a hostage. Give me the jet, I give you a hostage. You give me my wife, I give you a hostage. Then the rest come home on the jet. I'll see what they'll do, all right? In the meantime, you pick out who you wanna give us. And you tell me where your wife is, all right? I'm here minding my own business, I hear the transistor, go, ""Sonny what?"" I can 't believe my ears. I grab the kids. I'm telling you, Sonny didn 't do it. It ain 't him to rob a bank! It ain 't him to steal or hurt anybody or do nothing wrong! He's never done wrong since the day I know him. Night before last we're at Coney Island. I'm looking in the glove compartment. He's got a gun with bullets in it. Things are adding up how crazy he's acting lately... ...and in with a bad crowd. So I look at him. Go on, get in bed. He's yelling at the kids like a madman. Then he wants me to go on a kiddie ride. I don't wanna go. He starts screaming at me. Sweetheart. He's screaming and screaming. I say, ""What are you gonna do with the gun? Shoot me and dump me in the river?"" I mean, I was scared of him. I never been scared of him. His mother says we was always fighting, the cops was always at our house. I hit him with a jack handle once in the car. Only I didn't even hit him, I hit myself. You should've seen the bruise on my leg, from here to here. He'd put on his hat and coat, he goes out the door. So they tell me he did it. But I don't believe it. Mrs. Wortzik, please, listen to me. They want you down at the bank. His body functions might've done it, but he himself, he didn't do it! ""Dear Abby: Lately I've been dreaming about falling into water... ...and not being able to reach the surface. I begin to breathe heavily and I wake up in a cold sweat. A friend tells me that my problem is one of sexual repression."" - Margaret, are you all right? - No. What are you, a renegade, a bandit? What kind of man are you... ... siding with the Indians against his own people? - What's your grudge against me? - I'm taking you in for murder, Kilgore. Yeah? Are you doing anything to any of those girls in there? He's back again. Well? Who is this? Look at Margaret. What's the matter with her? There's no air in here. What happened to the air conditioning? - I'm sorry, Syl. - It's all right. - Where's the air conditioning? - The basement. Sal, I'm gonna go check the air conditioning. - I'll be right back. - Sonny. What? I never been up in an airplane before. So? I mean... I mean, it's safe. It's like a car. It's safer than a car. It's all right, Sal. - I'm gonna go check it now. - Okay. - Sal! - What? - They're coming in the back! - In the vault! Come on. - Goddamn it, move! - Back, get back. No, don't shoot! That's it, Sonny! Get her in there! Do it! Get her in there! Who fired that shot? Pick her up by the legs. Who fired the shot? Come on! Move! Okay, legs. I'll bring her. - They're moving good. - What's that? Sonny? Sonny! Get me a bullhorn. Sonny! - You got that bullhorn? - Right. Here. Hey, Sonny. Come on out, Sonny. - Sonny. - Sonny! That's all I need. - Sonny? - Sonny! Come on, take care of that, will you? - Sonny, come on out. - Sonny, come on out. Go straighten that out, will you, Carmine? Sonny! Sonny, come on out. - Sonny? - You did fine. Sonny. Sonny! You son of a bitch, you wanna get those people killed? Come on out, Sonny. Sonny, come on out. Come on out here, now. Come on out, Sonny. Sonny! Sonny? Come on out here, Sonny. All right, I see it, Sonny. Come on. Come on. All right, get back. Wait, wait. People, wait. Keep going. What's the matter with you? - What? - What're you firing that shot for? We got 250 cops here! Fuck you! What were they doing back there? What the hell's the matter with you? Are we dealing? - They were trying to get in, right? - Who? Come on, don't give me that shit. You know who. - What's going on? - You're full of shit! Find out what's going on there! - Honest to God, Sonny, I don't know... - Bullshit! Communications aren't set up yet. - Get someone to talk to me! - Goddamn it. I'm not talking to you anymore. - Let me talk to you. - You say this, you do that. Why were they back there?! - I don't know! - You're full of shit. That's another force, a tactical force! They like to shoot, climb through windows! They like that, right? Without your orders, right? No. Yes! Without my orders! - You're not coming through the roof? - I tell you we won't. You're telling me a lot of things, but you're not doing them. What were they doing?! - I don't know! - You can't answer me, right? - You can't answer me. - What? - You can't answer me. - Yes, I can. So tell me what they were doing. No communications! I sent someone back there. I got a guy in there who's gonna kill somebody. That's your responsibility. - Not mine, that's yours. - Wait a minute, hold on. Let's... - We got everything you wanted. - Oh, yeah? Yeah. We can't get a helicopter in here, but a bus is coming. We got a jet coming into Kennedy, all right? Okay? All right? Now, we got ahold of your wife. Your wife is coming. We reached her and she's coming here, all right? - Okay? - Where you going? Where you going? I'm right here. I thought we were gonna talk. I thought so too. But we're not talking. We're trying to get in the back door. Your wife will be here in about a half-hour. Okay? They're still pointing. They love to point. Holster that weapon! Holster it! Holster that weapon! You too! All right, come on. - What? - What else do you want me to do? How could you do any better? We got everything you wanted. I'll do anything I can to stop anything I can. Anything else? - Yeah. - What? I got some people in there that are hungry. - Can you get some food? - No problem. What do you want? - Want some pizzas? - Yeah, all right. Pizzas? Hey, Carmine, get some food, some pizzas. Can we get some beer, you think? No beer. Let's keep it to soft drinks, all right? Come on. All right? Carmine... ...some soft drinks too, okay? Cokes. - What else? - I need some aspirin too. Some lady's not feeling well. You got it. Anything else? - Just don't fucking con me. - I'm not. Why would I wanna do that? I'm in trouble enough as it is. I'm not trying to create any trouble. All right? It's okay. They can't... They can't bring a helicopter in here, Sal. Because they can't land it here. But they're gonna get us a limo bus... A big bus so we can all get in. And that's how we get to the airport. It's good. It looks good. You people, I just ordered you some food, so... I even got her some aspirins. Okay? So we're moving it along now. I gotta pay for the food. Where's the marked fives? That was a foolish thing you did back there. - Yeah? - Foolish thing. We gonna get the ball rolling? Yeah, what do you think I'm doing? I'm working on it, right? What's it look like? You think it's easy? I gotta keep them cool. I gotta keep all you people happy. I gotta have all the ideas and do it all alone. I'm working on it. You wanna try it? Your food is here, Sonny. You're starting to get on my nerves. All right. Go on with him there. You'll be all right. Go right here. - What do I owe you? - It's all paid for. - It's paid for. - I paid for it. No, I got it. I got it. Here. Keep the change. What? - You want this? - Yeah! You like it? Moretti, could you use five? I got a lot for you. Get back! Get back, goddamn it! Get back! Let him go. Let him go. More! More! More! More! More! More! Could you open it? Thank you, man. See you later. I'm a fucking star! - Okay, kick... - Right. ...out, turn. - Around. No, just pick her up and hold her. She'll be okay. You get your kick good. Here. Kick, out... This is where it gets stuck. - Is that it? - Yeah. Here. - Miriam's making a fool of herself. - Out. - Anybody got a cigarette? - Yeah, I do. Sylvia, you don't smoke. You don't smoke? No. Why...? Why do you wanna start now? I'm scared to death, that's why. What, you don't smoke? - No. - How come? - I don't want the cancer. - Oh, my God. - Give me the cigarette. - Go ahead, do what you want. I just think you ought to take care of your body. My body? What for? The body is the temple of the Lord. You're serious. So you rob a bank... ...but you keep your body pure. Is that it? You gonna smoke or what? Yes. If I die of cancer, it'll be half your fault. - No, it's because you're weak. - Right, I'm weak. - One, two, three... - Where's your bullets? Mulvaney speaking. It's Moretti. Wants to talk to you. - Yeah. - Will you guys hold it down back there? Sonny, they're bringing in your wife. Step back. Stay back. - Where's Moretti? - Probably in the bar. In the barbershop. What's that? We went to Bellevue where you told us... ...said he was his wife. They were married in a church. Jesus Christ! Leon. Leon! Hey, Leon, over here! Leon! Hey, Leon! - Now move it back. - Leon, over here! Leon! Happy birthday! - Hey, give us some room, huh? - Watch his head. He's a queer? Sarge. Sarge, he wants you! Come on, get the shield out of here. I don't need it now. Where were you 4 hours ago, when I needed it? He's not gonna shoot. Yeah, Sonny, what? What happened? Is he all right? - He's a little groggy right now, okay? - No, let me talk to him. Let me get him on his feet and call you back. Shut the fucking door. Stop the noise in here. I don't wanna hear a fucking sound! Typewriter! - Get off the fucking phone! - Sarge. Now! Give me some water, all right? Leon? Leon. You all right, man? They give you a shot down at the hospital or something? Oh, God. They shot me with, like, unreal! You gotta get ahold of yourself... ...so you can talk to him, see if he'll come out of the bank. Oh, no. He's got 8 people, and a kid named Sal. You know him? - No, not really. - Says he's gonna shoot these 8 people. I can't help it. I can't stop him from anything. Who will he listen to, then? I can't... I can't talk to him. He won't listen to anybody. He's been... He's been crazy all summer. He's tried to kill me since June. Yeah. Put a gun to my head. And he cut me with a knife. - He beat up my friends. - Did you contact the police? What good would that do? It'd just make him mad. They don't know him. And it wouldn't stop him. - Somebody's gotta stop him. - You don't understand. He's crazy. He's got a wife, children. He's a wonderful father. His mother... ...you should see her. Together with his father, they're like a car wreck. It just... It just rolls off his back. He sees them. He pays the rent. Unbelievable. I was the one who wanted to get married. He didn't really want it... ...but he did it. I don't know why. Why did you wanna get married? I thought it would help me. But it didn't. I... I was so confused. I was doing... ...insane things. What sort of things, Leon? After the wedding... ...I ran off for 10 days to Atlantic City. Sonny was frantic. He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't know where I was, who I was with. I couldn't explain the things I did. So I went to a psychiatrist... ...who told me... ...that I was a woman trapped in a man's body. So right away Sonny wanted to give me money for the sex change operation. But where was he gonna get it? My God, he was in hock up to his ears already. He needed the money for your operation? It drove him crazy. He... He would fly into these rages. And I got more depressed than ever. I knew I'd never get my operation. So I tried to kill myself. I took about a half a pound of pills. Blues, reds, yellows, screamers, uppers, downers, you name it. And I wound up in a hospital. And Sonny comes there... ...and he just looks at me. And he says: ""Why, Leon? When things were going so good?"" Don't you think...? Leon, don't you think he sort of did it for you? Yeah, I guess so. Don't you think you owe it to him to try to get him out? I can't talk to him. You're up to your neck in it, Leon. You're an accessory. - No, no. They can't hold me responsible. - Wait, you could help us a little. I'm afraid. Just talk to him for a minute. How can he hurt you on the phone? - All you're gonna be is on the phone. - I can't. I don't know what to... - Just talk with him on the phone. - I can't. No. You think about it, Leon. Yeah. - He doesn't wanna talk to you. - What do you mean, won't talk to me? - Let me work on it. - I thought you were doing that. He don't wanna talk to me. Police are questioning Leon Shermer, a 26-year-old admitted homosexual... ... who claims to have married one of the bank robbers last November. According to sources in the barbershop where Leon is being held... ... Leon has reportedly said... ... they were married in an official ceremony by a Father Burke. Leon 's story has been confirmed. Seven bridesmaids, all male, Sonny's mother and 70 other guests... ... all members of the gay community, were present. We've been able to obtain a still photograph of Leon in his gown. Leon has confirmed... ... that the gowns for himself and his bridesmaids cost $ 700. We have not confirmed the story... ... with the priest. But we are told that he was subsequently defrocked. Phone calls have arrived from various factions of the gay community. Some in support of Sonny and his actions, others totally condemning... ... the present events and calling the marriage a farce... ... and, quote, ""A case of sheer exhibitionism. "" End quote. Our coverage of the Brooklyn robbery where two homosexuals hold hostages... ... for their demands of a helicopter, a jet... Sonny. Sonny, they said, ""Two homosexuals in the bank."" - Right on TV. You hear? - What difference does it make? They're gonna say anything they want. Let them say it. Well, I'm not a homosexual. Tell them to get that right. That's going out on the TV. Sal, what am I supposed to do? I can't control what they say on television. What should I do? I'm doing everything I can. I can't do that. I mean, they're... Look, Sal. Forget about it. It's just a freak show to them, anyway. It don't matter. Whatever they say, it don't matter. It'll be all right. What's the matter with you? You shouldn't let something like that spoil your fun, you know? You gotta get fun out of life. Shit. Where's the goddamn jet? They're always screaming overhead, going somewhere... ...when you don't need them, you know? What are you gonna tell the pilot when you get on the plane? You have to know, right? - Did you know Holland's pretty good. - Use this. - Holland? - They sheltered people during the war. They're good people. Where's Holland? - It's right up... - It's over there. She doesn't have a map. It's got good chocolate. Come on, get in the vault. Get in the vault. Come on. Quickly! They're waiting for us to do something, I think. Sonny. - Come on out for a second, please. - It's him, Sonny. Come on out here. I wanna talk to you a second. - Come on, Sonny. - Sonny. Sonny. Come on out, Sonny. Sonny? Come on out a minute. That's it, Sonny. Hey, Sonny! Moretti! What the fuck is going on? Get the lights back on. Moretti! Who are you? FBI, Sheldon. Oh, good. About time. Maybe we can get this thing started, huh? Look, get the lights back on... ...and the air conditioner. We got no air conditioning. - No more favors. That's all over, Sonny. - Favors? You been doing me favors all night? I have a jet, limo will be here in a half hour. I want the hostages. No, no, no. Bullshit. I'd like to work with you on this, not against you. The hostages are what's keeping me alive. When do I get them? Didn't they tell you anything? I'd like to hear it from you. You get one hostage for the limousine that you bring me in. One hos... One hostage for the jet. Then I get to the airport. I go into the plane, check it all out. And if it's okay, then they all come out. - I wanna go inside. - Why? - To see if everybody's all right. - They're all right. No, I have to see. You got guts. Think if we slit their throats, we're gonna let you out? I have to see. I gotta check with my partner. The FBI, Sal. They're coming in. Hey, pussycat. There you go. You'd like to kill me? Bet you would. I wouldn't like to kill you. I will if I have to. It's your job, right? The guy who kills me... ...I hope he does it because he hates my guts, not because it's his job. Nobody give your right name. It's the FBI. Just wanna make sure all you young ladies are all right in here. - Look... - We're all right. ...they asked for the jet hours ago. Now, what are you doing? That's being set up. We'll have you out in a couple of hours. - A couple of hours? - Why not give them what they want? They'll get what they want. We wanna be sure we get what we want. That's to get you all out of here safe. You two boys too. That's close enough. Tell the TV to stop saying there's two homosexuals in here. I will, Sal. Outside for a minute, Sonny? You handle yourself well, Sonny. A lot of men would have choked. We might have had a death on our hands. But you handled it. I respect that. Now, don't you try to take Sal. We'll handle him. - Just sit tight and you won't get hurt. - Wait. What are you talking about? You just sit quiet. We'll handle Sal. You think I'd sell him out, you fuck? What'd he say? He was just talking about arrangements. I talked to him about the TV, Sal. It's gonna be all right. That's all? Yeah. Why couldn't he say that in here? I don't know. He wanted to show me how the bus is coming in. What's the matter? Somebody get a glass of water. Got a hankie? They poisoned the pizza. It's not the pizza. He's got diabetes. He had some Coke before. Don't give him anything. I'll hold it. What can we do for you, Mr. Mulvaney? Tell us. Is there a doctor out here? We need a doctor in here. We need a doctor. - What's wrong? - The manager, he's diabetic. He don't look good. I gotta search you. Watch out he don't kiss you, doc. Looking for an antonym. Okay. Just him. Sonny. I've convinced Leon to talk to you. He's on the phone now. He's coming on. Hello. Hello? Hello, Leon? Hello. Hello, Sonny. What happened? How you...? How you doing? Well, I'm out of the hospital. Yeah, I know. You know, I thought you'd never get out. Hot. I never thought I'd get out this way, I'll tell you. Yeah. So how you doing? - I'm a little shaky. - Oh, yeah? Moretti told me that you were all drugged up... ...so I figured that's why you didn't talk to me. I was wondering why. It was really terrible, you know? I mean, you walk in, and right away they say you're crazy. And then they start sticking things in your arm. I mean, how do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time? I'm... I'm just starting to come out of it now. - So... - So how are you? I'm fine. This is something, huh? Yeah, yeah. I don't know, Leon, you know? I'm dying here. I'm dying. Don't you ever listen to yourself when you say you're dying? - Did you ever listen to yourself? - What are you talking...? What do you mean, what am I talking about? You're dying. Do you know that you say that to me every day? ""I'm dying."" You're not dying. You're killing the people around you. Leon, don't give me that shit. I don't need the deep shit now! You don't realize what the things you do mean. Yeah? I know what I do. You stick a gun to somebody's head. - I don't know what I'm doing sometimes. - Obviously, you don 't. ""Go to sleep so it won't hurt when I shoot."" What do you think I've been doing in the hospital? I take a handful of pills to get away from you. - Right? - Yeah. So now I'm talking to you on the phone again, right? I... I... I got no job. I don't have friends. I can't live. I have to live with people. This death business, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm getting here with that shit. You know, what am I supposed to say to that shit? This is going on. - And you're giving me that shit. - I'm sorry. You know what's happening with me. You know the pressures I've been having, right? I got all these pressures. You know it. You're in that hospital... ...with them tubes coming out and want that operation, right? You're giving me that shit. Everybody's giving me shit. Everybody needs money. So you needed money? I got you money. - I didn't ask you to rob a bank! - I know you didn't ask me. Look, I'm not putting this on anybody, you know? Nothing on nobody. I did this on my own. You see? All on my own, I did it. But I just want you to know something. I want you to know that I'm getting out of here. I'm getting a plane out of here... ...and I just wanted you to know it. And I wanted you to come down... ...and I wanted to just say goodbye to you. Or, if you wanted to, you can come with me. You're free to do what you want. That's just what... ... I wanted to say to you, that's all. - I'm... I'm free to do what I want, huh? - Right. I been trying to get away from you for months and I'm going with you on a trip? Where? Where are you going? I don't know where yet. We said Algeria. I don't know. So I'll go to Algeria. I don't know yet. Why are you going to Algeria? I don't know why. They got a Howard Johnson's there. Your chances... You're warped, you know? You're really warped. I'm warped. I know I'm warped. God, Algeria. It's... You know, they walk around with masks on, things on their heads. - They're a bunch of crazy people. - What am I supposed to do? - You could have picked a better place. - Like where? Sweden? Denmark? Yeah, like that. Yeah. You know what? Sal wanted to go to Wyoming. I had to tell him it's not a country. He don't know where Wyoming is. I'm with a guy who don't know where Wyoming is. Think you got problems? So, Sal is with you? Oh, boy. You'd be better off giving up. I'm not giving up, because why have I done this so far? I've gone so far with this, and why should I give up now? I can't give up. - Would you do me a favor then? - Yeah, what? These guys that have me down here, you know... ...they think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank. That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy. They're bullshitting you, giving you a snow job. - They told me I was an accessory. - No. That's just a con job on you. Don 't listen to that. I have to listen to it. I can't survive in prison, Sonny. - Leon, you're not going to prison. - How do you know? Because I know. Believe me. - Look, please, just tell them. - Please what? Tell them what? That you didn't do it? Are they on the phone now? - Are they on the phone now? - Yeah. That's great, Leon. That's really terrific. You talk to me with them on the phone. Really smart. - I have no choice! - What do you mean? What am I supposed to do? There's 7,000 fucking cops all around me. - Who's on now? - Look, don 't lay it on me! I'm not, but you knew that was going on, right? You knew what was happening, right? Yeah! I wanna know who's on the phone now. Moretti. Moretti, is that you? Hello. Will somebody talk to me? Somebody gonna talk to me or what? - They on the phone now? - They won't talk to you. All right. He didn't do it, okay? He had nothing to do with it. All right. Now, will you get the fuck off the phone? Are they off the phone? Yeah. Terrific. That really convinced them. That's what they wanted to know. - Did I do it for you? - Yeah, thank... - Thank you very much. - Okay. So now what? What are you gonna do? Well, I thought... ...that I would go back to the hospital. They're really nice there. They seem like they're trying to help me. That's good, then. You found something. Yeah, I don't know if I have or not. So are you gonna still have the operation? Yeah. Yeah. So then, what am I supposed to say to you? Thanks a lot... ...and bon voyage. Yeah, right. See you sometime. Yeah. I'll see you in my dreams, huh? Right, I'll write a song. - I don't know. Life's so funny. - You said a mouthful, sweetheart. Well... Goodbye, huh? Bye. - Yeah. - Give me... Can I have...? - Moretti. Moretti. - Hey. Hey. You cut off the incoming calls. Can I have a line? I wanna talk to my wife and to my kids. He wants an outside line, is it all right? - I want a line. - Yeah, Sonny, I'm getting it. I could call anybody, they'd put them on the phone. The Pope, an astronaut... ...the wisest of the wise. Who do I have to call? I just don't know what to do. - Hello. - Angie. Sonny, Jesus! I was watching it on TV. - Yeah. So where are the kids? - I sent them to the neighbors. I can't believe. I can't believe. I mean, it ain't like you. I know. You've never done anything like it before in your life. I'm dying, you know that? I'm dying here. I blame myself. I notice you been tense, like something is happening. Like that night you're yelling at the kids like a madman. Then you want me to go... ...on that ride, here to there, full of those kids. It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go, so you yell at me: ""You pig, get on the fucking ride!"" Everything fell out of me. My heart, my liver just fell to the floor. I mean, everything. You know what it felt like? You yelling at me in front of all those people? You never talked to me like that before, Sonny. I think, ""He's gonna shoot me, dump my body in the river."" - Will you just shut up. - I was scared of you! Will you shut the fuck up and listen to me?! Just listen to me! You see that? With the language and everything. I'm trying to talk to you, and you... A person can't communicate with you! I mean, what am I here? I'm your wife. I'm your wife! You know something? You hurt me. You hurt me, you know that? Can you imagine, marrying another man? Did I ever do anything to make you do that? Did I ever turn you down or anything? I know I let myself get fat. - Don't call yourself fat. - You can 't stand me to say it. Like I can't stand you being a bank robber. That's what love is. Yeah? You know what love is, right? If you know what love is so much, why didn't you come down here? - Well... - Talk to me about love, go ahead. Sonny, I'm scared. I'm scared. Are they gonna shoot me or something? They're not gonna shoot you! You should see it on the TV. They got cannons, machine guns. They're after me, Angie, not you. It's late already by the time I find out... ... it's just you and Sal. I can 't get a babysitter! What'll I do? Listen, I think I better take him back for a cardiac check. So, what's the matter? What, he gonna die or what? No, no. It's just a precautionary measure. It's awfully warm in here. All right, then. Let's go, let him out. I'm not going. I'm okay. I just needed the injection. What, you trying to be a hero? You don't look good. We'll let you out. I'm not trying to be anything. I just wanna be left alone. Okay? - No one's bothering you. - I wish to fuck you never came. That's all. Don't try to act like you're some angel of human kindness. Out of the closet and into the streets! Out of the closet and into the streets! Out of the closet and into the streets! Out of the closet and into the streets! Sonny all the way! Sonny all the way! Sonny all the way! Sonny all the way! Sonny all the way! Sonny all the way! Ladies. Ladies. I wanna apologize for my use of language back there. Why? What did you say, Mr. Mulvaney? - What did he say? - He said the 'F' word. What? What did he say? He said the 'F' word. - Fuck. - I know, Miriam. Fuck. But I'm a Christian and my ears are not garbage cans. Come on. Oh, Edna. - Then we shouldn't go after them. - Then we won't. - What's that? - Sonny. Could you come out, please? Sonny? - Shit. - What? - It's my mother. - Sonny. Someone here to see you. Sonny... ...could you come out, please? - Oh, who needs this shit? Sonny. Sonny, could you come out, please? Mom, what are you doing down here? - I don't need you down here. - Oh, Sonny. All of Brooklyn is out here. Three networks of television. - I got it all worked out, Ma. - I talked to the man from the FBI. Who? No, don't talk to anybody. He says if you come out now, everything is gonna be all right. - I'm trying to get you out of this. - Don't talk to the FBI. I told them everything... ...how you were in the war in Vietnam, I told them you always had good jobs. I told them you were with Goldwater in '64 in the convention and... Listen, I'm getting a plane and I'm going to Algeria. - I'll write you from there. - Algeria? - I gotta get out of here. - I don't understand. If I stay and talk to you, they won't send the limousine. - They'll think I'll come out with you. - What's the matter with that? Because I'm not coming with you. The FBI understands everything, that it is not you that is doing this. It's the pressures from your home life! - Don't get on Angie now. - Did I say one word against her? You were going to. She has nothing to do with it, it's me! Your life was sweetness and roses. And you... You wouldn't need Leon if Angie was treating you right, you know that! I don't understand why you wanna sleep with her anyway. You got two kids on welfare now. - You want three kids on welfare? - I can't talk to you about this now. What are you gonna do? All right, come out. I can't come out. I can't. Sal is in there with the people. - If I come out, he's gonna kill them. - Oh, my God. Run. Run. Run? Where am I gonna run? Ma, I can't run. - Maybe... - There's no maybe. No maybes. You gotta go home. Where's Pop? He didn't come, did he? Is he pissed off at you! He says he doesn't have a son. - He says you're dead. - He's right. - No. No. - Look, Ma... ...I'm a fuck-up and an outcast and that's it. You come near me, you're gonna get fucked over and fucked out! Now, I gotta go, Ma. Get her home, okay? Just take her home. How beautiful you were when you were a baby. Go home now. Get her home now. All right. Ten minutes. Being of sound mind... ...and body... You know, what they... To my darling wife... ...Leon... ...whom I love... ...more than any man... ...has loved another man... ...in all eternity. I leave... ...from my $ 10,000 life insurance policy... ...to be used... ...for your sex change operation. If there is any money left over... ...I want it to go to you... ...at my first... At the first anniversary of my death... ...at my grave. To my wife... ...to my sweet wife... ...Angela... ...$5,000 from the same policy. You are the only woman... ...that I ever loved. And I repledge my love to you... ...in this sad moment. To little Kimmy... ...and Timmy. I hope you remember me, Timmy. You are the little man of the family now... ...and I hope you look after them for me. To my mother... ...I ask forgiveness. You... You don't understand... ...the things I said... ...and did. But I'm me and I'm different. I want a military funeral... ...and I'm entitled to have one, free of charge. God... God bless you... ...and watch over you... ...till we are joined in the hereafter. Here, I'll sign. I'll spell that last name. - Watch out! - Watch out over here. Look out over here. Watch it. Come on, Sarge, just one picture? Back, back! All you guys, back up! - You're the driver? - Yeah. All right. I wanna check it out. - These seats come out? - No, they're bolted. All right, here. Light me on that side. Give me light over there. All right. Jesus, you're the man, huh? I was watching. I saw you, man. You should see yourself, you wouldn't believe it. - I believe it. - Goddamn, Sheila won't believe it. - Who's Sheila? - My old lady. They said, ""Gas up a stretch... ...go to 285 Prospect Park West."" - Give me some light over here. I said, ""Shit, another load for the massage parlors."" It's okay. My man, I'm gonna remember you. This is Agent Murphy. He'll be your driver. No, I want him. - Give me the black guy. - Hey, man, I ain't into that shit. Nobody'll hurt you. If they would've shot, they would've shot already. - I can't allow that, Sonny. - You can't allow? What makes you think you can say shit to me? I'm running this. I'll pay you. What do you want? $ 1,000? Come on. Don't look at him, I'm running this. Come on. Look, it'll be an adventure. You men that shoot, aim for white meat. Take a walk. Give me him. You think you're dealing with a fucking idiot? Take a walk, cop! Everybody is a con man. Come on. I want everyone across the street. I want them all back, on the sidewalk! Let's go! At least I know who I'm dealing with now. Here's a pen for you. Come on. Don't move, okay? Sonny, here's your document. - Right. - Oh, you gotta sign it. Here. We're taking off. We're going now. Okay, Sal. Where is he? Sal? Sal. That's it, we're going. Here, people, let's go. We're going. - Can I get my sweater? - Get what you had when you came in. Sal? Sal. - How you doing? - Good. - Good? We're gonna do it, right? - Yeah. We're gonna do it. Sal, see... ...you gotta keep your eye on him. He's the driver. - I need it. - No, it's mine. You gotta keep your eye on him, Sal, see? All right, where am I now? All right, hold it. Hold it. All right, let's go. Swing around now. Swing around. Just keep holding hands. Hold it. Break it on ""three."" Not yet, don't break yet. One... ...two... ...three. Go. - Go. Oh, fuck. We did it. - We did it. - Wish us luck. Bye-bye. - Okay, you got your one. - Follow my car. Sheldon here, get me Kennedy. - Sal, we did it. - Yeah. I'll be a son of a bitch, we did it. Okay, let's move. Come on, honk the horn. Hey, Sal, do me a favor, will you? Keep the gun pointed up. We hit a bump, the gun'll go off. All right. You set out there? We're leaving now. We want no trouble en route. - Intersection check? - Check. - All right. We'll be starting up right now. - 10-4. It's gonna be all right. Sal. Sal, you just gotta remember to keep the gun pointed up. You fucking... Hey, let him go! What's he doing? He's still got some arrangements to make. - That's it? - That's it. Sal, see it? There it is. Oh, I forgot. I forgot to ask if they got food on board. They gonna have food on board? There's your jet. We get one more now. That's the deal. Right. Okay, who goes? Sylvia? Maria. I'll pray for you. Sal... ...because this is your first plane trip... ...don't be scared, okay? I didn't eat all day. Will there be any food on board? There'll be hamburgers. Ready? - Sal. - What? Ready to go? Yeah. Okay. Let's move it. Sal... ...we don't want any accidents at this point, right? You keep your gun pointed up. You ready to get out first? I'm ready. Don't shoot me. Quick bullet. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it, please. Okay, it's safe. Come on. Put him away, put him away. All right, guys, move back. Come on, back up. Now spread them! No. No, we're all secure here. Murphy will report from the car. You make the report. Put the gun down. Back off. Get up now, Sonny. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney during your interrogation. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer... ...one will be appointed to represent you if you wish one. Agent Sheldon, would you please remain on the apron... ... until the hostages are well inside the terminal? Repeat: Agent Sheldon, would you please remain on the apron... ... until the hostages are well inside the terminal? Yeah, I got you. We'll hold here. Subtitles by SDI Media Group , Apartment For Rent - A phone token, please. - No tokens. At the end, on the left. Maman? Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going to see it. Then I've got to go to the station to meet Tom. I promised him. OK, see you later. Bye! I've come to see the flat. I saw the sign. - The sign? - Yes. It's always the same! Nobody ever tells me anything. - I'd like to see it. - You want to rent it? - I don't know yet! - They rent, they leave... ..and I'm the last to know. Do you think that's right? If you want to go up alone... ...go on. I'm afraid of spiders. The key is missing. Strange things happen. They drink six bottles a day. Wait! Don't go! There must be a duplicate. Here it is. You must be very young. Let go of me! She's crazy! Who are you? You gave me a fright. How did you get in? - Through the door. - Oh, yes. I left it open. I didn't hear you come in. - I was already here. - Sorry? Oh, it was you who took it. I had to bribe the concierge. These old houses are fascinating. An armchair by the fireplace would look good. The armchair should go... ..in front of the window. Are you American? You've got an American accent. - Are you going to take it? - Are you? I don't know. Oh l l! Do I answer it or not? There's no one! I don't know. So you're going to take it? You've decided? I had already decided. But I'm not sure now. Do you like it? Do you like it?! I don't know. I shall have to think about it. Think fast. I thought you'd left. - Watch out! - Have they taken us for someone else? We're in a film. We're in a film. If I kiss you... ...it might be cinema. If I stroke your hair... ...it might be cinema. What's going on? Do you know them? It's a long story. In short, Portrait of a Girl. It's been accepted for television! And the girl is you. It's you! You're mad! You might have asked me first. Yeah, but I wanted... I wanted to start with shots of Jeanne at the station meeting her fianc. Yes, I know them. They're my crew. So you kissed me... ...and you knew it was being filmed. You're a bastard! Traitor! No, you'll see. It will be a love story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling. What did you do while I was away? I thought of you day and night, and I cried. Darling, I can't live without you! Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect! I'd have finished by now... ...but the police wouldn't let me touch anything. They didn't believe it was suicide. There was so much blood everywhere. They had fun making me do a reconstruction. ""She went there."" ""She came through here."" ""She opened the curtain."" I copied all her actions. The guests were awake all night! The hotel was crawling with cops! They enjoy playing around with blood. They were all spies! Asking if she was sad, if she was happy... ...if you fought... ...how long you'd been married, why you didn't have any children. Pigs! They got familiar right away! They said, ""Your boss is a bit unstable."" ""Do you know that he was a boxer?"" So? ""It didn't work out... ...so he became... ...an actor."" ""Bongo player... ...revolutionary in South America... ...journalist in Japan."" ""One day, he lands in Tahiti... ...hangs around... ...learns French."" ""Then he comes to Paris. There... ...he meets a woman with money, marries her and..."" ""Since then what has your boss done?"" ""Nothing."" I say, ""Can I clean up now?"" ""No! Don't touch anything!"" ""Do you really think she killed herself?"" He pushed me into a corner and tried to paw me... Turn the tap off now. They'll be doing the autopsy right now. Why won't you turn the tap off? They told me to give you your razor back. It's not mine. They said they don't need it anymore. The investigation is over. Yes, she had cuts there... ...and on the neck, too... Excuse me, where shall I put this? - You could have rung the bell. - The door was open. I'll put it there. In front of the fireplace. - Careful, Madame. - There. - What about the table? - How do I know? He'll decide. - This is a king-size! - It won't fit. Well, your husband has no idea. All this in an hour... It's not long. What a mess! - Thank you. - Thank you. The armchair goes in front of the window. Like that. But I only came to return the key. - To return it to you. - I don't care about the key. Take your coat off. Take your coat off and help me. OK. Get those chairs and bring them here. Put them on the other side. Take that, too. That's it. You didn't waste any time. Listen, monsieur! I've got to go. - I thought you'd be here. - I expected you later. I took the first train. Oh, Paul! How awful! How awful, Paul! Papa is in bed with asthma. The doctor wouldn't let him come. It's better like that. I'm stronger. What are you looking for? Something that would explain... - A letter, a clue. - Nothing. I told you, there's nothing, nothing at all. My little Rosa wouldn't have... Nothing for her mother. Not a word. It's useless to keep on searching. Not even for you, her husband! You need to rest. I think room 12 is free. With a razor? What time did it happen? I don't know. In the evening. And then? Then I... I already told you on the phone... When I found her... ...I called the ambulance. After you called... ...Papa and I stayed up all night... ...talking about Rosa and you. Papa kept whispering... ...as if it had happened in our house. Paul! - Where did it happen? - In one of the rooms. Did she suffer? Ask the doctors. They're doing the autopsy. The autopsy. I already had some announcement cards. I've seen a lot of death. I think of everything. I'll prepare her a beautiful room with flowers. The cards... ...clothes, relatives, flowers. You've got everything in that suitcase. You didn't forget anything. But I don't want any priests here. - But... - No priests. - But, Paul... - Understand? We have to. Funerals must be religious. No! Rosa didn't believe. Paul, don't shout. Don't talk like that. They'll give her absolution. Absolution and a nice mass. That's all I ask, Paul. Rosa... Rosa is my little girl, do you understand? Rosa... Why did she kill herself? Why? Why did she commit suicide? Why? You don't know, huh? You don't know. You shouldn't have done that to me. It's not a wig, it's my hair. Doesn't it suit me? Tell me, don't you like it? Tell me. Of course I like it. Listen, you know... I don't know. You have changed, and yet you haven't. I can see the shot now. The camera is up high. It descends slowly and follows you. You come forward, and it moves in on you. There's music, too. It gets closer and closer to you. I'm in a hurry. Let's start. But... ...can't we talk a little first? Tonight we improvise. You follow. He was my childhood friend. He used to watch me for hours and hours. I think he understood me. Dogs are worth more than people. Much more. Meet Olympia, my nanny. Mustapha could always tell the poor from the rich. If someone well-dressed came in, he never stirred. But if someone scruffy came in, you should have seen him! What a dog! The colonel trained him to recognize Arabs by their scent. - Olympia, open the front door. - Give me a kiss. Go and open it. Olympia is a compendium of domestic virtues. Faithful, admiring, and racist. After Papa died, we moved back to the family home for a while. My childhood was made up of smells. Musty smells, the smell of walls and rooms. Children used to come and play in my jungle, all day long. Growing old is a crime. That's me there. And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher. She was very strict... and very religious. She was too good. She spoilt you. That's Christine... ...my best friend. She married the pharmacist and has two children. It's like a village here. We all know each other. I couldn't live in Paris. We're safe here. - It's odd looking at the past. - Cut! Why is it odd? It's you! It's fantastic, it's your childhood. It's everything I was looking for. What are you up to? Move it! Move it! Who are these zombies who are always following you around? Scoot! Go on! The door, the door... I'm opening the door. I'm opening all the doors. - What are you doing? - Setting up my shot. There it is! That's it! I've found it. Reverse gear! What are you doing there? Beat it! That's it. Into reverse. Yes! Do you see? Like a car, you go into reverse gear. That's it. Close your eyes. Start reversing. Close your eyes. That's it, come on. Come on backwards. That's it. Go back to your childhood. - Papa? - You're soaring. - Take off and return to your childhood. - In full uniform. Don't be afraid. Overcome the obstacles. Papa in Algeria. You're 15. - We're there. - My favorite route when I was eight. My old notebook. French homework. Theme: the countryside. Exposition: the countryside is cow country. The cow is all dressed in leather. The cow has four sides: the front, the back... ...the top and the bottom. - Isn't that good? - Beastly! Here are my cultural sources. Le Grand Larousse. I just copied from it. Menstruation. Noun. Physiological function comprising the discharge of menses. Penis. Noun. Male copulation organ, measuring five to forty centimeters. That's Le Petit Robert. Tom! Look! - Who's that? - My first love. - Who? - My cousin Paul. My first love. - But his eyes are closed. - What? - His eyes are closed! - He played the piano divinely. That's how I remember him. Sitting at the piano... His fingers would skim the keys. He played for hours and hours. At the bottom of the garden, there were two big trees. A plane tree and a chestnut tree. After mass on Sundays, we used to sit there... ...each under our own tree. It was wonderful. We sat gazing into each other's eyes. Aren't my trees beautiful? They were my jungle. - What are you doing? - Having a shit. No, we're doing a poo. - Shame on you, doing it in my jungle! - Watch out! Run for it! Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go and shit in your own country! Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't stop, whatever you do! - Did you get it? - Everything. Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of Paris. It's a real jungle here. So, tell me about your father. - I thought we'd finished. - Five minutes. - I'm meeting someone for work. - But the colonel... The colonel had green eyes and shiny boots. I worshipped him. He was so handsome in his uniform. What? Don't... He died in Algeria in '58. And don't joke about things like that. Why aren't you listening to me? The first time? I was really late for school. I started running and it was downhill. All of a sudden, I felt a strong sensation here. So I ran and ran... ...and I came as I ran. The faster I ran, the better it was and the more I came. A couple of days later, I tried to do it again... ...but no luck. Why aren't you listening to me? Why do I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall when I talk to you? Your solitude weighs on me. It isn't indulgent. It isn't generous. You are selfish! I can't sleep with this music. I came to this hotel a long time ago, to spend one night. And I stayed for five years. When Papa and I had the hotel... ...people came here to sleep. Now, there's all sorts. They can hide, take drugs, play music. Take your hand away. You're not alone, Paul. I'm here. You're crazy! I'm starting to understand. Do you want me to make them shut up? - What are you doing, Paul? - I'm afraid! Put the light on! The light, Paul. - Good evening, Madame. - Good evening. Good evening, Marcel. Goodnight, Paul. Who's that? Do you like him? He was Rosa's lover. Again! I'm coming! I'm ready. Shall we leave together? Bastard! He's a git! Not even goodbye! What are you doing there? I'm coming! I'll fly! - Wait! I've got to talk to you. - Why didn't you speak on the phone? What's up? - You must find someone else. - For what? - For your film. - Why? Because you're taking advantage of me. Because you make me do things I've never done. Because you're taking up my time. You make me do whatever you want. The film is over! I'm tired of being raped! Come in! You wanted to talk to me. Go on, then. You know I haven't come to cry with you, huh? Do you mind if I carry on working? It helps me a lot after what has happened. Identical. Rosa wanted them identical. Our bathrobes, huh? You can't tell me anything I don't already know, huh? Same color, same pattern. Yes, yes, yes. You're meticulous. I've always wondered why you save newspaper clippings. Is it work? Or a hobby? Hobby? I don't like that word. Let's say it's some extra cash. I do it for an agency. Oh, so it's serious. It's a job that makes you read, huh? Very educational. Be honest. You didn't know we had the same bathrobes. Marcello. We've got a lot of things in common. Marcello, I know everything. No, Rosa often talked to me about you. I don't think there are many marriages like that. It's strange. I'm thirsty. - Would you like a shot of bourbon? - Hold on. Here's the bourbon. Was that a present from Rosa, too? I don't really like bourbon... ...but Rosa wanted me to keep a bottle here in my room. I was asking myself this question. If, with these little things... ...unimportant things... ...we could go back over things, and understand together. Together? It's almost a year that Rosa and I... Not passionately, but regularly... I thought I knew her as much as you can know... - Your mistress. - For example... ...a while ago, something happened that I still don't understand. Do you see there, on the wall? She had climbed onto the bed... ...and she was trying to tear at the walls with her hands. I stopped her because she was breaking her nails. She had a strange... violence about her. I'd never seen her like that. Our room is painted white. Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel. To make it look like... ...a more normal home. But... ...it had to be changed here, too. I think she started with the wall. A cold sore. I don't know. Shit. You're lucky, huh? You were... You must have been very handsome... ...20 years ago. Not as much as you. You've still got all your hair. My hair... I have to have it trimmed often. And wash it. I wash it nearly every day. Don't you have massages? Yes, I do. You're in good shape. What do you do for... your stomach? That's my problem. For that... I have a secret. Tell me! Are you leaving us? I saw your suitcase was packed. America. Why was she unfaithful to you? You can't believe that Rosa... ...killed herself. It's hard for me to... ...believe, too. This is my secret! Thirty times every morning. Are you in? Is anyone here? Hi, monster. Is something wrong? Do you really think... ...that an American sitting on the floor in an empty flat... ...eating cheese and drinking water is interesting? There's something under here. Can you hear it? It's hollow. What are you doing? Shit! Do you know why I sent the others away? Because you're angry, or you want to be alone with me? And why do I want to be alone with you? You have something really serious to tell me. I have something really very serious to tell you. - Is it happy or sad? - It's a secret. So it's happy. What sort of secret? - A secret... - Speak up! I can't hear anything. - ...between a man and a woman. - Is it dirty or is it about love? About love. But that's not all. A secret about love, but which isn't love. What is it?! That in a week I'm marrying you. - What? - I'm marrying you. - What?! - I'm marrying you! - You're marrying me? - Yes! - We're getting married? - Yes. - No? - Yes. - No! - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. - No. - Yes. - Yes? - No. - Are we getting married or not? - I don't know. - So, yes, then? - Yes! - No! - Yes! - Yes. - No. Yes or no? Of course, I'll send everything to the country. What do you think, Jeanne? Olympia will be happy. I went there yesterday with Tom. She's preparing a family museum. Of course, I'm not sending the boots. I'm keeping them with me. I get strange shivers when I touch them. All these military things never age. When I was little, it seemed really heavy... ...when Papa taught me how to shoot. I'm keeping that here. In a respectable household, it's useful to have a weapon. You don't even know how to use it. The important thing is to have one. It makes an impression. You really kept everything of Papa's. Who's that? His orderly? A fine example of a Berber. A strong race. I tried to employ them as servants, but it was disastrous. I'm glad I decided to send everything to the country. All his things were piling up and piling up. Don't worry. You'll soon have all the space you want. What does that mean? Nothing. Madame, the colonel's lady... ...I announce... What? What? On this solemn day... What? What solemn day? I'm getting married in a week! - What did you say? - To Tom! In a week! - Pardon? - Tom! - In a week! - What are you doing in a week? Five... two! Move into shot! We're shooting! So... how do you see marriage? - Marriage? - Yes. I see it everywhere. All the time. What do you mean, everywhere? - On walls. On buildings. - Walls and buildings? Yes, on advertising hoardings. What are they selling? Cars. Tinned meat. Cigarettes. No. They're all about young couples. Before marriage, no children. Then the same couple, married with children. In short, marriage. The perfect, ideal, successful marriage. It's no longer the preserve of the Church. The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged. Now, weddings in advertising smile! They smile. On posters. On posters, of course. But why not take poster marriage seriously? Marriage... Pop marriage! Pop? That's the formula. For pop youth, pop marriage! But... what if the pop marriage doesn't work? Then you have to fix it like you would a car. The spouses are two workers in overalls... ...bending over an engine to fix it. And in case of adultery what happens to the pop marriage? In that case, there are three or four workers. What about love? Is love pop? No. That's not. Love isn't pop. Love isn't pop. So what is it? The workers retire to a secret flat... ...take off their overalls and become men and women again... ...and make love. You're wonderful. It's the dress that makes the bride. You're better than Rita Hayworth. Better than Joan Crawford! Better than Kim Novak! Better than Lauren Bacall! Better than Ava Gardner... ...when she was Mickey Rooney's lover! What are you doing? Stop! Stop, but keep filming! Why aren't you filming in the rain? You're crazy! - Where's Jeanne? - She must have run off. When? In the rain? Please forgive me! I wanted to leave you and I couldn't. I can't leave you, do you understand? Do you still want me? Voil! I want to get out of here. I want to go. I can't stand it here anymore. Yes. I'm going. I'm not coming back... ...ever. Quo vadis, baby? What? Is anyone there? There was a noise in there! Well? Is anyone there? Here he is. Hurry up! Wake up! - Open up! Open up! - It's four in the morning. I need room four for a while. Half an hour? Yes, that'll do. Yes, half an hour. - We're full. - That's not true. When you're full, you put a sign outside. I know the hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on the street. Call the owner. What are you waiting for? The owner has never made a fuss. Rosa and I are old friends. Open up. Don't make any trouble or I'll tell your boss. Come in, it's all sorted... You've won. He's taken off. I'm very sorry. Hurry up! He can't be far away. Make him come back. Tell him he can't just walk off. Oh... please don't tell her you found me. I don't fancy it any more. Did you see her face? Once, my wife satisfied me. But now she's got a skin disease. It's like snakeskin. - Put yourself in my place. - Come. Come with me. But... let go of me! You're crazy! Let go of me! Let go! Try and remember! The man from the fourth floor. He moved in a few days ago. I told you, I don't know anyone. They come and go. The man on the fourth, the woman on the first. What do I know? Where did they take the furniture to? It's empty. Where do you send his mail? Give me his address. I don't have it. I don't know these people. - Not even his name? - Nothing! Mam'zelle! I've found a flat for us. 1, rue Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come quickly! You'll come now? Do you know where it is? I'll wait for you. Come over. Come in, it's open. Do you like our flat? It's very light. There's a tiny room, too. It's too small for a double bed. It would be fine for a child. Fidel. That's a nice name for a boy. Fidel, as in Castro. But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but I like it. You know... ...I wanted to film you every day. In the morning, when you wake up... ...in the evening, when you sleep. When you first smile... ...and I didn't film any of that. Here. Today is the last day of shooting. The film is finished. I don't like things that finish, things that end. You have to start something else right away. This flat is huge! - Where are you? - I'm here! - It's too big! We'll get lost! - Stop it! Don't start! - How did you find this flat? - By chance. - We'll change everything! - Everything! We'll change chance to destiny. Go on, Jeanne. Take off! Fly away, you're in heaven! You're soaring, you're in heaven! Come down, take a nose dive, come down! Make three turns, come down. Jeanne, what's happening? There's an air pocket. What's happening? The patches of turbulence are over. We can't play like children anymore, Jeanne. - We're adults. - Adults? That's awful! Yes. It's awful. What do adults do? I don't know. We'll have to invent the gestures and the words. For example, adults... But there's one thing I do know. Adults are calm, serious... ...logical, measured, level-headed. Yes. - And... they face up to problems. - Yes, yes. Yes, yes. You see, Jeanne, this flat won't work for us. This flat, it won't work for us, Jeanne. - Where are you going? - To look for a flat. What kind of flat? A flat we can live in. We can live here. It's squalid. It smells. It makes me sick. - Are you coming with me? - No, no. I've got to close the windows and return the key. There's a lot to do. OK. - Bye. - Bye. The jury has chosen... ...the following ten best couples: Number three! Seven! Eight... Nine... ...15... and 19! And now, ladies and gentlemen, good luck for the last tango! That's the limit! What are you doing? You'll have to leave, sir. Madame! 'Tis ever love. Go to the circus if you want to see love! Go on! Get out of here! You'll have to leave. It's over. Stop it! We're finished. Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! I'll call the police! After you, mademoiselle! It's over! It's over! It's over! Help! Help! Help! Please, help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help! I don't know who he is. He followed me in the street. He tried to rape me. He's a lunatic. I don't know what he's called. I don't know his name. I don't know who he is. He tried to rape me. I don't know. I don't know him. I don't know who he is. He's a lunatic. I don't know his name., - Hey, sexy. - Hi. I love that dress. Of course you do, Lorenzo. You made it. - Ah, there you are. Hi. - Lena. - You've done it again. - Well, it's all for you, Bradlee. Gotta mingle. Oh, the girls are by the pool. Well, well, well, Lena. So, where's this sexy boy toy of yours hiding? I didn't know you were a football fan, Patrick. I've never watched a game. I'm just a big fan of his old underwear ads. Well, he's probably just getting out of the shower. Let me go hurry his ass up. - Hi. - Hey, babe. Start of the fourth quarter, and Owens will throw. He's got Brown wide open! You have got to be kidding me! Honey, just let me finish the game, I'll take you to the movies. Take me to the movies? Hello! There's a huge party going on downstairs. Remember the catering trucks, the valet parkers? Oh, shit, I forgot. I'll tell you what you should forget about. Football. Because it's forgotten all about you. Now, you're gonna put this outfit on that I bought you, drag your drunken ass downstairs and mingle with my clients like a good boy. Who am I? Elton John? I ain't wearing that shit. - Yes, you are. - I'm not your trained monkey, honey. No. You're much more expensive than that. But I tell you what. If you're not downstairs in five minutes, I'm gonna throw you out of my bed, out of my house and out of my life. Then you're gonna have to pay for your own bananas. I'm just so mad at you because you're not wearing my gift. Gift? What gift? It's like a... I-love-you gift. I left it in the closet for you. Really? - Paul, I'm so excited. - Yeah. I can't believe you did this. - Where'd you put it? - In the back, on the right. Paul? Paul, what are you doing? I think we need some alone time, honey, so... I'm gonna go take a cruise in your Bentley. Don't you dare take my car, you drunken bastard! - I own you! - I love you. Somebody please open this damn door! Patrick? - Lena? - Patrick. What happened to you? He locked me in the closet and left me to die. Oh, my God, he is deranged! He thinks he can mess with me. 911. Oh, man. Here come the party poopers. Well, well, well. I'll be damned. If it isn't Paul Crewe. So, what did I do wrong? Was I driving poorly? Nope. Nope. This car was reported stolen. No, no, no. It's, uh, actually my girlfriend's car. Shit happens. Shit does happen. I mean, look what happened to your ears. I gotta ask you something. Does he get XM Radio with those? Actually, they get a couple of channels. It's Paul Crewe. Another question, though. Santa Claus. What's he like? Boy, I hate to arrest a public figure like yourself, but, hell, I don't think you got too many endorsement deals to worry about now, do you? Now, listen here, Mr. Frodo. Don't get short with me. That was good. I mean, he's good. Man. I hope you got a lot of money for that game you threw, cause that was the most pathetic thing I ever saw. Now, step out of the vehicle, Mr. Crewe. Uh, don't you think I should pull the car over more? I could get sideswiped. You sound like you're slurring your words a bit there, Paul. You been drinking tonight? Absolutely not. Now, could you do me a favor? Hold this beer while I back it up. Hey, you can finish that one. I got five more. Take care, guys. We got a 3-94 in progress. Okay, remain calm. How you doin'? What's up? What's up? What's up? What you are watching is live footage of a vehicle, apparently stolen, being pursued by police. We're receiving word now that the driver of that vehicle is former Pittsburgh football star Paul Crewe. Crewe, you might remember, was the only man ever to be indicted on federal racketeering charges for shaving points in a professional football game, although it was never fully proven. Yeah! - Yello. - Do not get one more scratch on my car, or I will slit your throat. See, that's our problem, sweetie. You care about this car more than you do us. And how'd you even know there was a scratch on this baby? Because I am watching you on TV, as is the whole country. Once again, you are proving to everyone what a worthless piece of shit you are. Well, I hope they like this. Hey, Lena! I think we should start seeing other people! I think I'm in love. Good news, boys, I didn't spill my beer. Without question, Crewe's five-year federal probation for point-shaving has been severely violated tonight. The future of this once-great football star looks very dark indeed. Long way from the big city, huh, superstar? Staying with the times around here, huh? Ain't she beau-ta-ful? Home sweet home, boy. Get on your feet. You're one lucky son of a bitch, Crewe. - Is that right? - That's right. See, the warden loves his football. Fact, he was on the winning side of your little thing. - Well, tell him congratulations. - But I wasn't. Welcome to Allenville. Thank you, sergeant. I'll take it from here. - Afternoon, inmate Crewe. - Yeah. Come on. Warden wants to see you. Let's do it. Move it. I used to play a little college ball myself. Down at the University of Miami. I bet a lot of your old teammates are locked up in here. No inmates from my playing days. Couple of guards, though. See, we got us a fine prison-guard league down here. It's like a... company softball team. Now, the warden... he's gonna ask you to help out. Okay. With what? That wasn't nice. When the warden asks you, - what are you gonna say? - Yes? You're gonna tell him ""no"". You got it? You're gonna tell the warden that you want nothing to do with his football fantasies. Not in my back yard. Because the warden don't run this prison. I do. - You understand? - Not entirely. Okay. I feel you, dog. I feel you. Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe. I don't get to say this to my new guests very often, but it's an honor to have you here at this institution. It's an honor to be locked up here, sir. Oh, this is, uh, Errol Dandridge. Colonel Sanders been eating his own chicken. He's my political adviser. See, I've been approached by several very influential people wondering if I'd be interested in standing for governor. They see the way I run this prison, think maybe I should run this state. Only with less sodomy, right? Hopefully none. Sorry. Now, there are two things we take very seriously here in the state of Texas. Prison and football. We play a little of the latter here. Uh, the warden is too modest to admit that his team is rather good. But not good enough. Five years since our last championship. Five years. Now, I've worked real hard, pulled strings, called in quite a few favors to get you here, Paul. Now, why would you go and do that? Because I am convinced that you can get us back on track. I haven't played football in I don't know how long. I don't really want to. You wouldn't be playing, Paul. Just... just consulting. Anyone who was once the MVP of the National Football League must have a great deal of expertise to offer. Captain, what would you say to Mr. Crewe looking in, giving us the benefit of his experience? Oh, I think that's a real good idea, warden. We can use all the help we can get. Well, then, it's all settled. Whatcha say, Paul? I appreciate the offer, but I'm gonna have to pass. Now, I can assure you that your time here will be a whole lot easier if you just participate. I just wanna do my time and go home. Nothing else. If you'll excuse us, Mr. Crewe. Captain Knauer, you can stay. Sit down! I used to love your underwear commercials. Thank you very much. My ex-husband wore the same brand of tighty whities. He didn't fill 'em out quite as well as you, though. Special effects. Hollywood. Not all me. Oh, I doubt that very seriously. Well, then get him enthusiastic, damn it! Come on, get up. How'd it go in there? We all set now? Oh, yeah, we're real tight. Only the finest for you, superstar. I was just playing. I ain't gonna forget you, Crewe. Hey, yo, you owe me money on that game, punk! Better watch yourself, Mr. Football! Bitch! Yeah, you better run, woman. Yo, football. Take a seat. Thanks. You know, I have never seen one inmate just walk in here and be unanimously hated by the entire population. - I ain't never seen it. - How'd I get so lucky? Well, you could've robbed banks, you could've sold crack, you could've stole your grandmama's pension, and nobody would 'ave cared. But shaving points off a football game? Man, that's just un-American. - You play football? - Me? Nah. I suck so bad, they used to pick me after the white kids. Used to be mad too. It's like ""I can't believe I picked a nigga that can't play."" - Caretaker. - Paul Crewe. Whatever your pleasure, I can facilitate. You need weed, you need meth... Hey, you need Prozac, I'm your man. I know how you white boys always deal with that depression. I mean, me personally, I don't understand what you white boys all depressed about. Hey, you're white. Smile. And for a small fee, I can even get you McDonald's. - Really? - Yeah, that's right. Mickey D's. My man Cheeseburger Eddy got the hookup. Cheeseburger Eddy? That's right. We can get our McFlurry on. Enjoy it, fat man. What about the love of a beautiful woman? Well, you're gonna have to lower your standards on the beautiful part and on the woman part. Hey. Let's just stick with the cheeseburgers. Oh, they ugly now, but in eight months, he gonna look like Beyonc. No, thanks. Now, here's the most important part. You can't let these guys scare you. You can't let them punk you. Cause if you do that, you gonna end up being somebody's bitch. Don't want that. Thanks for the advice. Hey. Let me take that tray out for you. I ain't done eating yet. Oh, you're not? I'll give it back to you, then. You're dead! Hornet's Nest! - Everybody stay down. - Stay quiet! Come on, Crewe, get up. Get up, superstar. Yes, sir. You think you can do anything you want around here, don't you? Well, you are no different than any other piece of shit that calls this place home. Really? These guys think you're a dumb redneck too? Ooh, girl, that's your new boo. You better cut that shit out. It's gettin' old. - That's gonna cost you. - Lookin' forward to it. Wake up, Sleeping Beauty. Hey, superdick. Warden's wondering if your stay in the hotbox has changed your mind. How long have I been in here? One week. Wanna go for two? Huh? How'd you find these guys anyways? Recruitment, boy. When college stars don't get drafted, they need a place to go. A job, money, security... Who drank all the damn Gatorade?! - Damn it! - And apparently steroids? Look, seems like you got all the talent you'd want. So why do you need me? Well, now, you might find this hard to believe, but there's some folks here in the prison league don't care for me very much. - You, warden? - Yeah, well, they thought it might be amusing to schedule the defending league champs as our first game. And me? Well, I thought an old pro like yourself might have some training-camp tricks, drills, insights to offer up. Give us the competitive edge. All right. Relatively simple. You need a tune-up game. A tune-up game? Yeah. In college, we'd start every season against the Appalachian State or some slack Division 2 team. Kick the living shit out of them. Get their confidence up. You know something, Paul? - You've just given me an inspiration. - That's great. What? You're gonna assemble a team to play the first game against us. And you, Mr. Crewe, are gonna be the quarterback. I don't think so. Let me tell you something. In my prison, to get along, you gotta go along. I just wanna do my three years and be done. Three years is before you assaulted captain Knauer. Now, you could be with us for a very long time, Mr. Crewe. Fine, I'll do it. Good choice. But, uh, one condition, though. Gotta promise me to keep captain Knauer off my back. It's a deal. Now, you got four weeks to assemble a team and train 'em. What, are we gonna have a half-hour a day to practice with a Nerf ball? Oh, I'll make sure my boys allow you sufficient freedom, within these walls, to get your team in shape. What's this? Foot-ball tree-outs. What the hell is a ""tree-out""? ""Try-out,"" you half a meatball. - Now, what's this football thing about, man? - Crewe's gettin' a team together. - To play against who? - The guards. Now, I don't know about y'all... but I occasionally have the impulse to physically assault one of our finer correctional officers. Yeah? Well, how the hell we gonna get to do that? Just show up at the ""tree-outs"", you big, dumb bitch. Do the girls get to play? Oh, we're playing footballs, not... balls-balls. This is bullshit. Just another chance for the guards to beat on us. Don't you idiots get it? We could get a free shot at the guards. This is our turn. We could beat up on 'em. We could kill them. Kill 'em. You know, MVP sold his own teammates out. What do you think he's gonna do to you, fools? And that's the truth. With some cheese on it. There ain't no meat loaf between these buns. Yo, man, that's my flier, man! I worked hard on it! You see? He ran like a little bitch, right? You saw that, right? Yo, team needs you. Team needs you. You sh... Come to the tr... Come to the tree-outs. Crappy field, shit-ass equipment... Hey, man, at least we got some world-class players over there. Forty-five. Forty-six. Forty-seven. He might make the team. Well, if we gotta cut 'im, you're doin' it. Forty-nine. Fifty! - All right, man. - Good job, man. Well, well, well. You a football player? Oh, no. I never played no football, mister. So, what happened? You read the flier, thought it looked like some fun? - Oh, I can't read. - Oh, don't worry. Reading's for rich people. Just so you know, we're putting together a football team. Love you to join. Will you teach me to football? Sure we'll teach you to football. Won't we, Caretaker? Hey, I'll teach you anything. Just don't eat me. Okay. Down, Shrek. Down! Okay. Bring it in. Whoever's tryin' out for the team, wake up. Can you give a brother a little hustle? Very good. For those of you who don't know who I am, I'm Paul Crewe. I'm gonna be your coach, your captain, your quarterback... Hey, you haven't played in years. Why can't I be quarterback, huh? - You're right. Let's see what you got. - All right. - Hit me, I'm open. - Hike, hike! Hike! That's why. Now, sit down and shut up. It slipped. I just ate popcorn. Question: Any of you gentlemen ever play football before? - You did? Where? - Kansas State. Are you shittin' me? For coach Snyder? Ah, Kansas State Prison. Now, I hear they have the softest mattresses out there. Yeah, they do. They do. Not as soft as the ones at West Texas Mental Institution. - Really? - All right, let's finish this conversation later. For now, I wanna see what you got out there. Uhh, we'll grade them on a scale of one to ten. Yeah. Move it! Hustle, hustle, hustle! Give these guys sixes. Give these guys fives... Good, good. Give them threes. Very nice! - Aren't we missin' somebody? - Where is the Kansas State guy? You assholes better not cut me! I'm still on this team! - Negative two. - All right, go with negative two. Hey! Somebody bring me a Diet Coke! - Let's do this! - That's it! Five. Good. Seven. Stupid tire! You're a fricking tire! You think you're better than me?! I'll kick your ass! Three. And a half? Yeah. That's better. Okay. Good. Yeah. Hit that bag, man. Four. - Five,  I don't know. - I go. Come on, Switowski! Daddy! Oh, man! - Look at that. - He got it off the hinge. - I think that's a ten. - Let's go with a ten. I'm sorry. I brokeded your toy. No, that's a good thing. You should have a victory hug with Caretaker. What? What you talkin' about, man? Hey! Asshole! Okay, fellas, it's pretty simple. You do a buttonhook. The rest of you guys block for me. I'll take care of the rest. Okay? On ""go"". On ""go"". Ready? Break! We'll work on that. Okay, half speed on this one, guys. Slow and easy. Ready?! Go! Stop it! Stop the violence! Can't we all get along? - Hey, Paul. - Unger. - Team's looking great. - Oh, yeah. - So are you. - Yep. Working on it. The blood of the guards is gonna flow like the rivers of ancient Babylon. That's good news. Unger, you're the man. Good job today. You're all startin' to look really sharp out there. Yeah. See you tomorrow. - We're gonna suck. - Yeah. No doubt about it. You look like you could use a little help. No offense, my man, but, uh, you're a little... seasoned. Seasoned? I'm not asking to play. I'll coach. I'm Nate Scarborough. Nate Scarborough? The Heisman Trophy winner from Oklahoma? The inmate from cellblock D. But about a hundred years ago, when I could run and gun, - yeah, I was a Sooner then. - I heard you were dead. No, I ain't dead. I've been right here, rotting. Waiting for a chance to get back at those sadistic guards. Waiting. For this. Well, coach, as you can see, we don't exactly have the cream of the crop to work with here. Well, what are we gonna do? How are we gonna find players? How'd they get you to go to Florida State? They recruited me. I'll get the strippers. Well, now, Lindsay, this isn't about credit or congratulations. This is about giving men who've made mistakes in their lives an opportunity to rise above themselves. To move beyond the bars of containment. Say what? What I would do to you. Meow! Yeah. Nice boot, skin man. Hey, Crewe, why does he get to be the kicker? I was All-State, man. Let's see what you got. That's why, you dumb-ass. Go do some laps. I heard you boys needed to see me? Yeah. I want you to meet Skitchy. Hey, dog. Check that building over there. They keep all the records in the basement. He's been here so long, he knows where everything is. That ain't necessarily a good thing, is it? I had a parole date in '86. But I got in a tussle with a guard and, uh... One punch and it went away. Twenty extra years for one punch? Well, unfortunately for him, the guard he punched just happens to be the warden now. - Oh, shit. Warden Hazen? - ""Oh, shit"" is right. Warden, fight in the yard. Send backup. Right on time. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. Ain't you guys glad you got a black man for a friend? - Hell, yeah. - Come on. Hazen has a rating system for every con. What's three stars? The more prone to violence that the inmate is, the more stars he gets. Five stars is the max. - I didn't know that. - Yeah. Let's see how many stars my maniacal ass got. Wow! Wha... Ha-ha-half a star? That's gotta be a mistake. Check it again. Check it again. You're about as maniacal as a boxful of kittens. Come on, that's not funny, man. I'm-I'm gonna have to stab somebody or somethin'. Get my rep up. Why don't we have a maniacal pillow fight tonight? That could get it up some. Yeah. And we can sell it to pay-per-view. Superstar versus Half-a-Star. Why don't you shut up before I slit your throat and watch the dust come out? Come on, guys, we only got a couple minutes. How 'bout this guy? Damn, this fool got the chair three times, ain't died yet. Well, we may not have the most talented team, but we will definitely have the meanest. - What's he doing that for? - Cause he's a freak. Hey, Sasquatch! Someone's here to see you! Not too smart on your part. Hey. How's the headbanging comin'? You're bleeding. Just so you know. People have told me that you and I look a lot alike, so I wanted to see for myself. I'm gonna take a piss. You scared him away, dumbshit. You're kidding. Five-star Torres likes The View? No, just Joy Behar. The good news is she can breast-feed standing up. That's it. Where does she come up with this shit? I'm a Star Jones man myself. I love that big bitch. That was, like, the furthest thing. Well, I-I got married so young, so, I mean, I... they weren't pressuring me, the society was pressuring me... Mr. Torres. Us convicts are startin' up a football team. Not interested. We're playing the guards. - Walk away. - Good idea. 0 for 2. You're putting the pressure on her right now. Show's over, amigo. I still got 15 minutes of Joy Behar. Well, I'm cuttin' you short. Back to your cell, asswipe. Hey, white boy. - Cherryhead gonna play? - Yes, he is. Crewe, don't forget, I'm gonna be open. Green 40! Hut! Damn! Brucie, Brucie! You all right? You breathin'? I got a bird. His name is Ronnie. Well, tell Ronnie you got knocked the fuck out. Wow, no bullshit. Real football? Against the guards? Full contact. Captain Knauer is their quarterback? - Yep. - So I get to... tackle him? Yeah. You can, uh, either tackle him or hit him over the head with that hammer. I wanna hurt 'im. Not kill 'im. Let's get out of here before that thing bites somebody. All right. We'll see you and your pet iguana at practice. Down, set! Hut! Hut! Hey! - Hit me. - Get rid of it. Get rid of it! He didn't get rid of it. Sacked your ass. Somebody's gotta get open, guys. You got hammered by the hammer. I think I felt it on my leg. We gotta get some speed, man. What'd you expect? You got no brothers out there. What are you talking about? We got Switowski. Switowski? That's one brother. That's a lonely nigga. This ain't hockey. You want some speed, you know where to go. Hey, yo, check out this fake Slim Shady, man. I knew you couldn't resist my shit. I got the shakes that'll make you quake. I got the fries that'll cross your eyes. I got the burgers that'll... I just got burgers. I'm all right. Thank you. Just, uh, wanted to talk to you fellas about possibly joining the football team. The only game we'd play with you... is Slap the Point-Shaving White Boy Till He Cries Like a Baby-Back Bitch. Baby-back bitch, baby-back bitch Baby-back bitch. - That's a big-ass robot. - Yeah. You gonna help me out here? Thank you, Half-a-Star. Just so you know, we are playing the guards. That ain't a team. That's just a bunch of dumb rednecks giving themselves excuses to grab each other. This guy must be quite the athlete, huh? You risk bringing your ass in the jungle because you know I am. Yeah, so you'd beat me in a game of one-on-one, right? - What? - I think it's time for you to get steppin'. How's this, though? One game. I beat you, you guys play for the team. You beat me, I'll leave you alone. Take that. Take that, Deac. This fool ain't nothing but a thing, baby. - Ball, dog. - Ball up! - Can Crewe play ball? - He's a natural athlete. So is Greg Louganis, but I bet you he'd get his ass whupped out here. - Game's 11. Call your own fouls. - Okay. - Come on, come on. - Give it to him, Deac! - Did I get you? - No, that was clean. He'll be a'it. Call his mama. - If I foul you, tell me, dog. - Okay, baby. Take this f... Take this foul. What happened there? I think it's my ball, right? All right. Get up! Get up, Deac! Come on, Paul! - Calm down. - What? Now, don't stir-don't stir up the brothers, now. Come on. Come on, Deacon! Did I get you, dog? Hell, no, baby. That was clean. Good D. I thought he didn't wanna get hurt. It ain't about getting hurt. It's about pride. I bet you he's pretty proud right now. It ain't easy being cheesy! Did I get you? Did I get you? - No, I think I'm okay, baby. - I didn't get you, did I? That's traveling, bitch. You keep comin', huh? Game point, baby. How you want the game put up? Foul. That was a bullshit call! My court, my ball. A'it right, y'all. Let Deac speak! Nice spanking that ass, dog. - Now, get stepping. - Hold up. - Y'all got a runnin' back? - Not any good ones. No disrespect, Deac... but any man that can take that kind of beatin' out here, I can't wait to see what he can do in a contact sport. Shit, I'm in. Man, gimme that cheeseburger. You acting like a real McAsshole. Cheeseburger, he wants to run with the white boys, we will let 'im. Let's do this. Earl Megget. Well, we didn't get the whole chocolate bar, but we got a Hershey's Kiss. I'll take it. Let's get this over with, rookie, I'm starvin'. Fresh meat, boys! Fresh meat! Down, set! Battle, you're a psycho! Tony, you're a fat shit! Hut! Holy shit! Get 'im! Ran right out of your shoes, huh? Hey, manager, don't you think we can get our new star running back a decent pair of cleats? Yeah. I-I-I think I got a cousin that drives a truck for Reebok. It's cool, man. I never had shoes growing up noway. - I'll be a'it for now. - Oh, okay. Get your country ass back in the huddle. That boy got some slave feet, you see that? Defense! Huddle up over there! Paul. Paul! Hey, ladies. How's it hangin'? - Tell 'im. - I'm-a say somethin' to 'im. I just wanted to let you know I am your biggest fan. And I will be cheering my jailhouse boobies off for you at game day. - I appreciate that. Thank you. - Paul. I appreciate you. Okay, thanks. I'm glad to know that. Okay, are you done now? Huh? What's wrong with you? Jealous cause I don't cheer for you anymore? I don't know what you're talkin' about, freak show. Whatever, back freckles. Oh, yeah, back freckles. She's making up shit now. I'm gonna get some water. That feature interview worked better than I thought. I just got off the phone with ESPN2. They want to televise the football game. Guards, cons, Paul Crewe, it's compelling stuff. - Lots of human interest. Cha-cha-cha. - Don't do that in here. Television. Dandridge, do you think that might help my visibility with the registered voters of this fine state? Oh, yeah. The freak is back! Hey, hey. It's me again. You know, if I take this half down, we could play together. I'm just gonna take this half down. Don't worry. Don't worry. I got another ball. It's okay. You wanna serve? I'll serve. Really good news. We started a football team. You like football? It's kinda like ping-pong. Only the ball's a little bigger and egg-shaped, like my head. Just a joke. Stay calm. Give you a good chance to... throw people on the ground, hurt them like... you used to when you were a kid, 10 feet 6 inches ago. We'd be playing the guards. I think Papajohn's their safety. Turley, nobody gets to me. We'll play more ping-pong later, okay? Hut! Effective. - All right. - He brokeded my nose. I don't wanna play no more. Hey, hey, hey. Switowski, what are you talking about? This is football. Shit happens. Paul, he brokeded my nose. Okay. Stop cryin'. All right. We can fix this. Here we go. Okay. Good, good. How's it look? How's it look? It looks... It looks like, uh... It looks better than before. - Really? - Yeah, it's straighter. More distinguished. Kinda like a young Michael Jackson. I love little Michael. That's great. That's great. I think he did it on purpose. No, he didn't. Okay, maybe he did. You gotta apologize to 'im. Come on, Turley. Say you're sorry. Come on, say it. He said he's sorry. I got him to say he's sorry. Yeah, yeah. We're all impressed. Looking good, gentlemen. Way to work hard. Good practice, Paul! Me and the girls wanna show you - what we've been practising. - Okay, hit me. - What we've been practicing. - Okay, hit me. Come on, let's go. One, two, three. Give... me... a... D, D, give me a I I, I, give me a C C, give me a... All right, all right! I got it. Just save it for the game. Don't act like you ain't wanna see more, Brucie! - Yeah, you wish, pal. - No, you wish I'd kiss you again, cause your breath smell like eight cans of shark shit. I wouldn't touch her with a 10-foot pole. - What's he talking about? - He's a freak. Run, Forrest, run! That's how a white man plays guitar. Captain, he said he had some info. You guys have ""Halo 2."" I didn't even think that was out yet. Focus. Turn the music off! Yeah, captain. You know them convicts? They're startin' to get some serious players. But their biggest threat? A running back. Megget. - He's good? - He's fast. He's really, really fast. I mean, he's so fast, he makes fast people look not fast. I got it, he's fast. Now, why don't you show us your speed and get your pyro ass out of here. Yes, sir. Here I go. I'm sorry. Any books you'd recommend, inmate? No, sir. Not much of a reader. Oh, come on, now, maggot. I've seen you in here reading before. You requested this detail. Isn't that right? Nah. It's the quiet time I like, sir. Maybe you'd like to read this. What the hell kind of bullshit book is that? It's historical. Sir. Now, why would he wanna read a book about a four-eyed nigger? Does the N word offend you... nigger? No, sir. Oops. Sorry about that. You mind fetching these books for me, boy? No, sir. Just pick 'em up. Put 'em on the table. There you go. You forgot one. Bet you'd like to hit us, huh? Hit you, sir? Nah. Y'all my friends. Pick these up. Go! Hit me! I'm open! I'm open! Come on! We got one week before we play that game. We can't complete a pass yet. - Megget can't run the ball every play. - I know, coach. What the hell is he smiling at? This better be on the up and up. - I guarantee it. - Let's do this shit. There goes the neighborhood. Now I'll never get to play. Did you see that? Did you see that? The Deac is here! Nice. Okay, we seal off here, seal off here. - Cheeseburger. - Yeah. You're just gonna chip this guy... Ow, that stings. Nothing a Quarter Pounder can't fix. Oh, with cheese on it? Hut! Man, that boy would catch a cold in the desert. Here you go. - Everything's looking up. - Yeah. Still got one more pain in the ass to deal with. All right, boys, what do you say? How about a little best ball? No, I hate that bullshit. Everyone play their own damn ball. Shit, is that Paul Crewe? How do you like that, boys? The MVP coming to kiss my ass. So, uh, what's on your mind, Paul? Got a problem with inmate Unger. - Oh? Is he on your little squad? - I believe he's on your little squad. Mr. Crewe, would you mind if we had a picture? Please? That's up to the warden. - Ah, damn it. All right. - Rewound it. Did everything. - Flash is ready. - You don't need a flash. It's daylight. Oh, my bad. I just want a good picture. You know, I think you had sex with my wife before I married her. - Sorry about that. - Oh, hell, no. If she's hot enough to have a one-nighter with a pro football player, I must be doing all right. Okay, here we go. - Sergeant Engleheart? - Yes, warden. Would you step out of the picture, please? Yes, sir. - His wife has got the hottest ass. - Great. Just cut to the chase, shall we? You don't actually think you have a chance of winning, now, do you? We're gonna get our asses handed to us. I know it. You know it. I just don't want my players to know it. Your players? Just when I thought I had you all figured out. - What does that mean? - In the time you've been here, you haven't made or received one telephone call. You haven't opened so much as a single shred of mail. Why do you give a damn about those slimeballs? You never cared about anybody in your entire life. Well, maybe I finally found that sense of family I been yearning for since I'm a baby. And gosh almighty, my new family and I would sure appreciate it if you got Unger off the field. You hear? - Sergeant Engleheart. - Thank you. Oh, and as for your request... you'll have my answer soon enough. Did it rain last night? Not a drop. Son of a bitch. All right, boys. The warden is tryin' to break our spirit. He thinks we're gonna skip practice today, wait for the field to dry, make it up tomorrow... You know what? Who gives a shit? Three days till game time. We can handle it. But let me say this: That old man flooding this field tells me somethin'. The guy is scared. Scared of you sick, degenerate convicts. And you know what? He should be. Cause I got news for you guys. We're gonna win this thing. Did he say ""win""? What's it gonna be, boys? Do we go back to our cells, call it a day? Or do we get ourselves ready for the greatest ass-kicking fiesta in the history of football? I'll leave it up to you guys. Hey. You're part of the goddamn team. Get your point-shaving ass in there. You got it. I guess that asshole Hazen wants to play dirty. - We all convicts, right? - Right. Maybe it's time we started acting like it. Right here. Right here. Take it, Deac. Let's see which guards have some broken bones. Yeah! Shoes, nigga! Check this out. These be brass knuckles. They damn near old as me. Hut! That's perfect, Cheeseburger! Never been better. Good ball. Good ball. Okay. - Who we gonna crush? - The guards! - Who we gonna kill? - The guards! - Who we gonna kiss? - The guards! Gotcha. Lights out! Good night, ladies. - Yo, Crewe! - Yes, Mr. Caretaker. Check your toilet. There should be a little surprise in there for you. You took a shit in my toilet? No, that's the surprise I left in Brucie's toilet. - You got somethin' else. - All right. Well, would you look at this. A bottle of Ketel One and two glasses? Now, what would I need two for? Just shut up and pour me a drink, bitch. - Man... who taught you to be so cool? - My mama. Now, when I get out of here, I don't want you to get all Hollywood on us. I want you to meet 'er. Here, look at my girl. She's your biggest fan. Your mom's beautiful. - And you, you are ugly. - Thank you. Got it. Here's to, uh... the first friend I've had in I don't know how long. Hey, I thought I was your friend, Paul. You are, Switowski. Just... finish your coloring book and go back to sleep. Okay. And here's to having one o' these with you on the outside, sometime in the next three to five years. Lachaim. - Yo, Crewe. - Yes, sir. You being a ex-football player and all, I'm sure you got a lot of hot ass on the outside. Well, let's not forget I wasn't the most popular guy out there. Don't give me that shit. O.J. chopped his wife's head off and still got some ass. Yeah. My mama taught me not to kiss and tell. Now, go to sleep. A'it. I got one more question to ask you. Okay. What is it? Why'd you shave those points? Didn't you read the papers? I'm innocent. Yeah. Ain't we all? Yo, Crewe, what would you say if I could get you film from the guards' games last year? I would say that's incredible, but how? Thanks, gentlemen. The warden will be done with him in 15 minutes. - We can handle him. - Yes, ma'am. Then you're gonna, ma'am. Nice job. I can't tell you how much this means to me. Thank you, Lynette. Now Nate can study all the guards' formations. Not so fast, sugar bear. You gotta earn 'em. We only got 15 minutes, but, sunshine, we're gonna make 'em all count. - One more, please? - Mm-hmm. Let's go. - Quiet down. Guys. - Let's go. Before we watch the guards' game film from last season, we have a special presentation from our very own Mr. Paul Crewe. What are you talking about? What's going on? Now I gotta relive this shit? Yeah! You can say this, my man's a team player! You know what they say. Once you go gray, there ain't no other way! Hey, hey, hey. Brucie! Brucie! I'm glad you think that's funny, because I got something pretty funny to show you guys. Tony, hit it. You're gonna like this. - What the hell is this? - What? It's good. It keeps goin'. - Hi. - Here I am. Turn this shit off. Turn it off. No! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very funny. Trick photography. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. I was showing a little wrestling move. That's all. Knock it off! Knock it off! It's time we took a look at what we came here to see before the guards come back. The first film is the guards' offense against Texas Southern. Now, as you can see, they're running a standard wishbone. So you're telling me that these animals are watching our game films. - Is that right? - Yes, sir, boss. They got all last season. Seems to me that we ought to do something about this. W-w-what do you want me to do? You're the criminal. Be creative. But on game day, if I so much as... What are you doin'? I don't know. I've had hot flashes all shift, and... now my nipples are killin' me. Why are we talking about your nipples? We're-we're not. Just go do what you're doin' there. Guys. I want Crewe finished. Yes, sir. You give me the inspiration, sir. I got somethin' for 'im. Hut! Everybody! Huddle up! Every day we've been taking shit, for a long time. Tomorrow, payback. Now, think about that for a second. - What time is it? - Game time! - What time is it? - Game time! - What time is it? - Game time! Tomorrow, 12 o'clock, the bus leaves. Don't be late! Where the hell is Caretaker? I don't know. A gift for you, Mr. Crewe. How does he listen to that cracker shit? We're here deep in the heart of toothless country, coming to you from a simple Texas high school stadium that's been retrofitted for the big event. Now, when my man Travis tried to drag me out here, I said ""What are you, brain-dead from talking to too many Raider fans? It's not going to work."" But the fact of the matter is, this could shape up as an epic day. Hot-dog vendors, high-powered rifles, I love the combination. And apparently so do the fans. Hey, shitheads! Listen up! Everybody on their feet for the warden. Anthony, wow. You can sit down. Thank God. Gentlemen, Texas marshals have been kind enough to supply us with a dozen of their finest sharpshooters. So for those of you thinking of mingling with the civilians or trying to make a break for it, you will be shot. In the head. Now, let's all go out there and have some fun! Crewe! I'll see you on the field! I think he's in love with you. All right, listen up. I know it's hard to get psyched for the game without Caretaker being here. But somehow that sick, skinny bastard found a way to get us all fired up from beyond the grave. Caretaker's last gift to us. Battle, I presume this is yours. I still don't think that's big enough. - That's it? - No, that ain't it. Caretaker said he'd find us some gear to wear. I think he found us a name too. Mean Machine! Mean Machine! Mean Machine! Mean Machine! Good afternoon and welcome to a very special edition of ESPN football. As today, the semipro Allenville Federal Prison guards will be taking on the very prisoners they guard. And with this special game, folks, comes a special broadcast, as I'm joined in the booth by Baby Face Bob. Say hi to the folks, Bob-O. Chris, we went to a commercial. This, uh, this job, Bob, it's a lot of give and take. So when I bring you in, don't be afraid to talk to the folks. Unless you don't want to. And here come the cons, led by former NFL MVP quarterback, Paul Crewe. Holy shit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Well, hello. How are you? Back away from the girls! - Hey, now. - Call me! What the hell are you dressed up for? Hey, I didn't spend 14 years in the joint just to watch this game. And there in the high-security bleachers are the good-behavior cons, along with their... cheerleaders? We're the mean machine Don't mean to dis you We're gonna kick your ass And then we'll kiss you Hey! Ho! What? I didn't do it! Come on, Batt! - What's that? - Did you see that? Damn it! Papajohn's at the 20, the 10. And he will score. Sweet dreams, bitch. That's a 90-yard return and I gotta tell you, the cons seem more interested in hitting the guards than tackling the ball carrier. Hey, mom. Hey, dad. Thanks for picking me up from school. And here comes the big story of the day. Paul Crewe, serving a three-year sentence, hasn't played since he was banned from the NFL six years ago. Center, shift it! Shift it! Hey, Sasquatch! Twenty, hut! Crewe drops back to pass. Turley's leaving him unprotected. Fumble! Goddamn it. That's gonna be a personal foul on the big guy. And this is certainly inauspicious start for the cons. Come here! All right! You got 'im. Now, protect me! Let's go! Hold them! And here comes Knauer and that big offensive unit for the guards. Back to your cell. Hut! Hut! Knauer has Potter wide open. Touchdown, guards. - Son of a bitch! - And in the first 90 seconds, the guards are up by two touchdowns. This one looks like it could be over early. Sorry. What are we celebratin' for?! It's 14-nothin'! You guys wanna beat these assholes, do it on the scoreboard! Are you okay? Oh, God, you're not hurt, are you? Jesus, you sound like my mother. Listen, if you wanna cry, you go ahead and cry. I'll cry with you. Get off me! Get back out there and kick some ass! Why are you yelling at me? All I did was care! Look! A broken leg will heal. A loss to the Mean Machine lasts forever. Sorry, guys. Yeah, yeah. Me too. All right. Now, let's get started! Now, get the hell out there! Let's go! Way to go! Way to go! Here's the first sign of life from the cons. Let's see if Paul ""Motley"" Crewe can make something happen. Hut! On first down, Crewe will throw. He's got Deacon wide open. That's gotta be pass interference. But the ref is waving it off. - What?! - Oh, come on! Come on, now. I'm in this hellhole for less than that. - Be a man and make a call. - You're right. Unsportsmanlike conduct! Eighty-eight black! What?! Come on! This is baby-back bullshit! - Bullshit, D. - Calm down. Let it go. Let's call that one a questionable call. Blue 42, hut! The give is to Megget. He spins to the outside. Megget has room. He's at the 35. The 40. Oh! He's brought down hard, by his facemask. What? Oh, come on, man! That was a facemask! - You're not gonna call that? - I saw a clean tackle, sir. What you looking at? Are you serious? Tell it to the parole board, criminal. I mean, this is absurd. We can't win with the refs on the payroll! Listen up. I got an idea to end all this bullshit. Come on, let's all stay up! Come on! Down, set! - Red 58. - Cover your man! Red 58. Hut! That one hurt my marble sack. All right! - You all right? - Yeah. - What down is it? - Fifth. - No, no. It would be fourth down. - Okay. What do you think? Should I go for the left nut this time? Underneath! Let's go! Ref, you gotta get in the game! Right over here! Well, I don't quite get this, but on fourth and 22, the cons are gonna go for it. Down, set! Red 58. Red 58. Hut! You gotta always protect the McNuggets. How about from now on, you call a fair game? How's that sound? - Sounds good. - Okay. Wet Willie. Yeah, you like that. And so the guards will take over after one of the strangest offensive series I've ever seen. Okay, boys. We know who doesn't have any balls out there now. Have we got any? Have we got some balls? - Yeah! - All right! Let's go kick some ass! Come on, Swit, stand them up, baby. White 50. White 50. Hut, hut, hut! Knauer, play action. Here comes the blitz. Ouch! Switowski is so big, it's like being tackled by a Coke machine with legs. This is fun! - Nice to see you smiling, Bob. - Thanks, Chris. Green 90! Hut! Third and 5, and the give is to Megget. He's to the 40, where he'll come up short. But look at Turley push the pile. And now Crewe. And that's a first down! And look out. Boy, somebody better take control of this game soon, or they're gonna need body bags on the sidelines. - Let's go, guys. - Come on. Start of the second quarter. Cons still down by two touchdowns, but they finally have some momentum. Hut! Crewe with a shovel pass to Megget. And Megget scrambles for a first down. Oh-ho-ho, you fooled me. - I got you there, didn't I? - You did. You know what? Engleheart, you are the best-looking guy on your team no kiddin'. You know, Paul, in the midst of all this, for you to say something like that is... Come on, let's go. Let's go, D. First and 10 at the guards' 35. Crewe dumps it over the middle to Deacon Moss. And he's hammered at the 17 for a 13-yard pickup, and that's a first down. - Hut! - Crewe, trying to get his team on the scoreboard. He will throw. And it's caught by Deacon Moss for a touchdown! All right! And so there'll be no shutout today, as the cons are on the board. Quit booing, people. Both teams are trying very hard! What the hell's wrong with you? Stop acting like a damn cheerleader! - Sportsmanship, try it. - Shut up. Damn. 2:11 left in the first half. And Dunham is back in at fullback. And he is a load, at 6'2"", 260. Dunham, breaking tackles. He refuses to go down. But he finally does after a 15-yard gain. That's how a white man runs a football. If I was on D, I'd crack you square in that egg-ass head o' yours. Yeah, but you ain't on D. Are you, bitch? Switowski! Come 'ere. Do you know what he said to me in the library? Yes. Him. Out. D, D, defense D, D, defense The cons don't seem to have an answer for Dunham, who's averaging close to 12 yards a carry this half. Green 67. Green 67. Hut! Oh, what a hit on Dunham by Switowski. I think I made him shit himself. I think he just shit himself. I think he just shit himself. Good Lord. This guy shit himself bigtime. See? I told you I made him shit himself! Yo! I'll make sure I send them books to the hospital, pimp. And some diapers. Nineteen seconds. We got a lot of ground to cover, so... you bastards remember that play we practised in the mud? What are you talking about? That was some schoolyard bullshit. Yeah. Let's try some schoolyard bullshit. Come on, D, let's go. Down, set! Green 88. Green 88. Hut! The clock starts to run. Crewe hands the ball to Megget. It's a reverse. Cheeseburger Eddy's got it. Go, baby, go! He laterals to Deacon. Tackle 'im! To Turley. The clock is running. To Brucie. Shades of Cal-Stanford. Back to Crewe. He tosses to Megget. Tackle 'im! And look at that little Megget run. Three seconds left. Yeah! Go! He could... go... all... the... way. Touchdown! Did you see that?! Do that sound again. I like that. And so, on a miraculous play, the cons end the first half with the score: 14-all. Bring it in. Do you have any idea... who's beating you out there? This was supposed to be a blowout, and they're showing you up in front of the whole nation. The whole nation! I like it when he's angry. - I told you! - Way to go, baby, way to go. What in the hell do you think you're doin' out there? Playing football, sir. I didn't say nothin' about winnin'. We're not winnin'. Not yet. You got yourself in quite a predicament, Mr. Crewe. - Is that right? - You see, it's just come to my attention that inmate Unger has been taken into custody for the murder of Caretaker. - Good. - Oh, yeah, it's good. Only thing is, he claims to have an accomplice. Claims you knew all about it. Hell, he even says you sent Caretaker to your cell. Bullshit. Captain Knauer says he saw you planning it with Unger. There's no way that could hold up in court. Court? Hell, boy. In Allenville, I'm the judge, I'm the jury, and in your particular case, I'm the executioner. - What do you want? - I want you to lose. I can't do that. Course you can. After all, you've had plenty of practice. But the men! It's more important to them than it is to you. Okay. Suit yourself. Spend the next 25 years of your useless life in prison. All right, I'll do it. But I don't want my guys hurt. You get ahead, you coast. We clear? Fine. Right after I get a two-touchdown lead. I tell you what bothers me the most, warden. That you're not gonna be out there on that field with us, gettin' what you got comin' to you. The only thing comin' to me is victory. Mean Machine. It's cute. - Let's go, boy! - We can do it, baby! Captain. May I have a word? Don't worry, warden, we'll take care of business. I already have. What? We can win this on our own. Captain, a man in my position doesn't leave things to chance. Now, after you get a comfortable three-touchdown lead, I want you to inflict as much pain as humanly possible. Do not let up, you hear? I want those cons to understand who owns 'em. - Do I make myself clear? - Oh, yes, sir. Good. There's the kickoff, and we're under way in the second half. Megget is finally brought down at the guards' 33, where Paul Crewe will take over. And what a first half he's had. Here we go! Here we go! Down, set! Y 45. Hut! On first and 10, Crewe will pass. He's got Deacon wide open. Oh, incomplete. It's okay. Get your head up. It's all right, man. Come on, Paulie. Second and 10 from the 33. Crewe's looking for Deacon once again. - He's open! - He's open! But overthrows it. And it's picked off by Papajohn. Look out! He might go. Say goodbye. Touchdown! The first mistake Crewe's made all day. Short memory, baby. We'll get it back. We'll get it back. Defense, let's do this! 8:38 left in the third quarter, and Crewe has struggled thus far in the second half. Hut! The pitch to Megget. Oh, my! That ball is live! It's picked up by Lambert. He's at the 15, the 10, and he will score! Yeah! Touchdown! Yeah! Crewe took a shot on that play and he's getting up slowly. Meanwhile, in the end zone, the guards have something to celebrate, as they find themselves up by two touchdowns. This is simply a different Paul Crewe we're seeing here in the second half. There's the old Paul Crewe we love to write about. What the hell are you doin' out there? I'm done. I'm out. That's it. - Where you hurtin'? - My knee. - Seems okay to me. - Well, it ain't. If Crewe can't go, I don't know how deep these guys are at quarterback. The guards will try to keep it away from Megget, so they'll pooch kick. Fair catch. Fair catch. As Big Tony calls for the fair catch. Watch out. That was as late a hit as I've ever seen. And even some of the home crowd not liking that one. Hang in there, partner. Can o' corn. Can o' corn, and I'll be fine. Can o' corn. Yeah, I'd have a hard time looking at me too. Brucie! Yeah, coach. You're the only one that knows this offense, son. Now, do it. Coming into the game, replacing the injured Paul Crewe, is number 1, Brucie. All right, all right. Crewe's playing like shit. That's his problem. I'm gonna bring us back. Right, 32 Flex Dive Motion on one. Ready! Break! Yeah. It's Brucie's time to shine, baby. Okay. Down, set. Hut! There's the snap and the ball is fumbled. And the guards recover. I... knew I shouldn't have had that popcorn. The guards are in command here as we move late into the third quarter. Ninety-eight. Hut! Hut! The give is to Potter. Back to Knauer. He's got a man open deep downfield. He'll throw the flea-flicker! And he's got it. Touchdown, guards. And this game is starting to look like a blowout. Hey, man, after all Caretaker did, this is how you show him love? Don't worry about it. You haven't changed one damn bit. All right. Down, set! Back in at quarterback is Brucie, who will try to find a handle on the ball this time. Throw it, Brucie! Oh, shit! And look out. Ooh, what a shot he took! How much more blood do you want? I think the cons are just about out of options at quarterback. Hey, Skitchy, let me ask you something. When you popped the warden, was it worth it? Was it worth spendin' the rest of your life in here? Was it worth it? It was worth every goddamn second. What the hell is he doin'? Paul Crewe must be feeling better, because... here he comes. All right, I missed you guys, so I'm back. We got a lot of work to do. Let's get it goin'. Deuce right, 89. Fly on two. Ready? Break. As we start the fourth quarter, cons down by three touchdowns. Wide left! Tight left! Black 90. Hut! Hut! Here comes the blitz, and no one's blocking! And Crewe will be sacked for a big loss. That looked like a message to Crewe from his offensive line. Did you see that, man? They're quittin' on 'im. Okay, baby. Jailbreak Blitz. Ready? We got that out of the way. I deserved it. - Now we gotta play some football. - Switch it! Switch it! Cons need to do something to get back in this game. And that's not it! And Crewe is leveled! I don't think he's gonna get up from that one. - Nice hit! - Oh, yeah! But he is. And I don't know how, after that last hit. All right, punt team! Keep them off the field! We're goin' for it. Dumbshits are goin' for it! Let's go! Let's go! Come on back, if he wants to get his ass kicked. Come on back. This is unbelievable. Fine. You guys don't wanna help me, I'll do it on my own. On two. Let's go, to the line. On fourth and 20, the cons are gonna go for it. This could be the ball game right here. Red 98. Hut! Hut! Crewe dodges the blitz, but he loses his helmet. And he's not going down. He's got the first down. Time-out! - Not bad. - Not bad. Huddle up. Look. I'm sure you already know this, but I never said it out loud. I did throw that game. I did it. I was in a bad way with some worse people. After I did it, I felt so shitty I wish... wish I would have just let them kill me instead. Now... the warden wants to pin Caretaker's murder on me if I don't throw this game. So it looks like I'm gonna get to know you guys a lot better, cause I ain't doin' that twice in a lifetime. We got a little time left. We can still do this. I'm beggin' ya. Put your hands in here. Okay. Thank you. Now, who are we? Mean Machine! Come on, Mean Machine, let's go! That's great news. All right. We got ourselves a game. Brown 65. Hut! First and 10 from the 30. Crewe finds Deacon open in the flat. Hut! The give is to Megget. And he fights his way for a 9-yard gain. One yard, baby. One more yard. Hut! Hut! Crewe tries a sneak. Or is it? He flips it back to Megget. Megget's got the first down and more. And Megget is down to the 4-yard line, where it'll be first and goal. Hut! Crewe hands it to Turley. And look at the big man go. Tackle 'im! Touchdown! That was some rumbling, bumbling stumbling right there. And listen to the crowd as this underdog con team is startin' to win them over. Third down and 6. Guards have the ball on their own 29-yard line. Knauer needs a first down to put this game away. White 50! White 50! And look at Battle take off. He knocks the ball loose! There's a dogpile in the backfield. The refs are trying to sort it out. Ah, my arm! The cons recover! Yeah, we got the ball! We got the ball! We got it! We got it! With just over two minutes left to be played, this has turned into a game. Crewe will start in great field position at the guards' 25. And look at this formation. The guards, they're confused. Shift over! Move! They're trying to call time-out, but there's the snap. Moss is behind a wall of cons. I wouldn't wanna be in front of that thing. And they'll score! - Hey! Is that legal? - Yeah, it is. - Is that a touchdown? - Yes, it is. What is going on here? Shit! And with the extra point, the cons are down by just seven. - Brucie! - Yeah. Yeah, coach. I want you to go out there and kick off. - I can do it. - Kick off! - Brucie can't kick worth a shit. - I know. Recover the ball. Jesus Christ, my Savior. If you help me out with this one, I promise to stop cheating on my wife with black guys. Amen. Back in the game is Brucie, and he'll do the honors. And it's a horrible kick. But the ball is tipped! And the cons have come up with it! - We got it! One time-out. - Got it. Got it. Got it. That's it, Brucie. Oh-go! My bad. My bad. My bad. Come on. Give me that. Damn... Well, that felt unnecessary. Cons have enough time for one final drive. Crewe drops back to pass. He's under pressure. - Watch the pass! - He's looking for Deacon. He gets the ball up, but he's leveled. And Deacon's got it for a first down, but he stayed inbounds. Tick, tick, tick. The clock keeps running. Clock's runnin'. Clock's still runnin'! Clock's still runnin'! On the ball! Damn it! Do something! Hut! Crewe. He's looking to throw. Under pressure again. Go! Get rid of it! Go! Go! He pitches it to Megget. He's got some room. Here we go. Here we go. Go, Megg! Go, Megget! - Go, Megget! - Get 'im! He could go all... the... way! But he won't! Goddamn it! And Megget is hit hard at the 4, and he's hurt. My knee, man! You busted your knee for us, we'll bust our ass for you. Hey, coach, I need a back! Win this shit. - I'm goin' in. - Coach, you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. And look who's coming into the game. You can do it! Get that old ass of yours in the end zone! We gotta win this thing! Come on! No, no, no, no. Hey. Old man. Absolutely not. You're gonna get killed out here. They've been tryin' that for years. Don't worry, I got the perfect play. - I ain't handin' you the ball. - You don't have to. Nate Scarborough, the former Heisman Trophy winner from 1955, is gonna play tailback, but he's gotta be in there more for moral support than anything. Mean Machine. Mean Machine. Mean Machine. Mean Machine. Mean Machine, Mean Machine, Mean Machine Mean Machine! Mean Machine! Mean Machine! Six seconds left on the clock. Cons down by seven. They must score on this play. Don't let them through! Down, set! - Black 99! - Come on, D! Black 99! Hut! Hut! The give is to the big man, Turley. He's stopped by Lambert at the line for no gain. No! Wait! The ball's picked up by Scarborough. Come on! Touchdown! What an amazing comeback, folks! Taking a play from the old Nebraska playbook. The Fumblerooskie. Easy. Easy. - You still alive, old man? - Never felt better in my life. You're a sick bastard. Come here. And now the cons are a mere extra point away from overtime. Mean Machine! Team vote: We go for the win? We go for the tie? Hell, guys, we're convicts. We always go for it all. Yeah. Unfortunately, that's why we're all in the joint. What would Caretaker do? Give me that blackboard. Yeah, come on! Come on. - Are you serious? - I don't know. That-that play is wack. It's gonna work. It's gonna work. Let's go. On the ball. Come on! Let's go! Let's go, y'all! Let's go! I think it's gonna work. And wait a minute. Crewe is coming back into the game. The cons are gonna go for the win. They're goin' for it. Crewe... trying to settle his team into formation. But there seems to be a lot of confusion. Come on! Run the play! Turley! Turley. Over here. Move your giant ass right here! Right here. Come on, baby. Come on. The play clock is still running. Crewe better call a time-out. Come on, Crewe! They don't know what we're doin'! Run the play we set up. I think you're still dizzy from that hit! The snap is to Deacon. It's a trick. He throws it to Crewe. They did it! Unbelievable! The cons win! We win! Group hug in the shower tonight! Or not. Or not. Well, there you have it. A bunch of ruthless criminals have beaten the men that uphold our justice system. Criminals are people too,Chris. Now, give me your wallet. - What? - Ah, just kiddin'. You got a lot of balls, Crewe. You played a hell of a game. And don't worry. I know you had nothin' to do with Caretaker's murder. - And I'll back that up. - Thank you, baby. Mean Machine! Mean Machine! You humiliated me. I can't believe you couldn't even win a fixed game. Now, where the hell does he think he is goin'? He's escapin'. He's escapin'! - Officer, shoot that man! - But, sir, there's people. Shoot 'im. Crewe! Captain, I order you to shoot that prisoner. - Shoot 'im! Fire! - Crewe! Damn it, I'm giving you an order, captain! - Crewe! - Pull the trigger! It's the game ball. Hey. Why don't you stick this in your trophy case? - You have a nice time, old man? - Yeah. Yeah? Okay. So, what do we do now? Well, the first thing is, we tell the team where they're hiding Unger. Oh, I can't wait to see what Switowski does to him. Great game, sir. - That's a week in the hotbox! - Who gives a shit?, Catch them. Kill them. What's wrong, Ronnie? I love you, Jodie. Suffolk County police. May I help you? Everybody's dead. What do you mean, ""everybody's dead""? A guy come running into the bar and says... his mother and father are shot. I've been to a lot of crime scenes, never seen one like this. Six members of the family were found last night... in bed, shot... and killed. Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo, his wife and four of their children. The sole survivor of the family... 23-year-old Ronald ""Butch"" Defeo Jr... is said to have discovered the bodies. The police state that for his own safety... they're holding him in protective custody. Five of the victims were found shot facedown on their beds. The sixth was found in a closet. No one seemed to stir in their sleep. It's strange. Suffolk County police have charged 23-year-old Ronald Defeo Jr. The accused told police he heard voices... coming from within the house, telling him to murder his family. Oh, God! Damn it. Hi, Michael. Oh, hey, baby. You okay? George, what are you doing to my mom? Nothing. - Yet. - You perv. Come on up here, little man. You can make it. Oh, you're getting heavy. Did you meet my dad? No... never had the pleasure, pal. Do I have to call you ""Dad"" now? - Guess what. - What? - You can call me whatever you want. - Anything? - Yep. - Cool. - Anything. - Cool. Yeah. - Stinky. - Sure. - Poopy-head. - Yeah. Crap-monkey-fart. Okay, we gotta draw the line somewhere, pal, that does it. All right. - This sucks. - You're not kidding. Billy. Look, maybe we'll grab you something on the way to school. - What do you say, huh? - I'm not hungry. I can walk to school. No, you can't, and get your feet off the chair. I'll drop you a couple blocks away. Nobody'd see. - Mom, I'm 12 years old. - Before you plan... your retirement party, we're gonna drop you off at school. We got a big day. Why? Where are you guys going? - Mom, can you help me? - Oh, Michael. Houses here are way out of our price range, Kath. Not according to this. - Well, then it's gotta be true. - Think positive, babe. I'm positive that houses here are out of our price range. Look, when the business is going good... - we're gonna... - There. - What? - That's it. - Look. - Honey. Baby, look, 412 Ocean Avenue. - It's beautiful. - What? Look at how friendly they are here, honey. They get like that when they think they'll make a sale. Let's just play it cool, Kath. Kathy. Katherine. Or not. - Hi there. - I'm Katherine Lutz. Well, just call me Edith. This is your husband? - George. - This is an amazing house. You are going to love it. Just follow me in here. Careful on the steps there. Holy shit. Excuse me. Let me show you the rest of the house. This... This is a mistake. How's that? No, I mean your ad in the paper. This is... It's gotta be a misprint. I'm a contractor... and I know what a place like this should cost. And, you know, if this is... Well, if this is true, then this is a... The deal of a lifetime. And what is wrong with that? - Come on. - I love it. - There's a vibrant history here. - Vibrant history, George. In fact, the house was built in 1692, at least the basement. The rest of the house was added from that foundation. It's one of the oldest Dutch Colonials in Long Island. Wow, that's impressive. This room would be perfect for children, if you have any. And the view's... Well, have a look for yourselves. There's a boathouse. Oh, all you need now is a boat, right? Actually, George has a speedboat. This place sounds like it's made for you. And this is your basement. As you can see, it's very spacious. It can be a game room, a playroom. Well, let's... Let's have a look. I'll just wait up here. Yep, looks like a basement. So, what do you guys think? - I think you look foxy in that skirt. - Will you stop it? Come on. Yes, yes, okay? It's a value. It's a value for people with money. Okay, look, if we do this, we're gonna be eating dry wall for a year. We deserve this, George. You deserve this. How many times you tell me how hard you work for so little. - Kathy... - Maybe today is the day it all pays off. - We'll make sacrifices. - Huge sacrifices. Yeah, I understand that. Listen, honey... this is the life we want. - We're happy? - Yes, we're happy. She's happy. I'm broke. Hold on, hold on, hold on. So look, I gotta ask, what's the catch? There's always a catch. There was a tragedy, a crime... - a murder. - I'm sorry, what? In the house? Several people, a family. But, you know, we've moved on, the whole town. It is a distant memory now. And the house is fine. Really. Doesn't it seem kind of strange to buy this house, honey? Well, houses don't kill people. People kill people. Just... Excuse us. Do you think we can make it work? You know what? You want it, then we're gonna make it work. - Really? - I'll work out of the basement... and you can, well... - sell one of the kids. - Hey. A little one. We're rich! We're rich! We're rich in something, but it ain't money. Wait. - You say your prayers? - Yep, said them twice. - What did you pray for? - If I tell you, it won't come true. Why don't you tell him the truth. - What? - Praying doesn't do any good. William. Nobody answered me when I asked for Dad to be kept alive. Don't say that. Sometimes things happen in life that can't be explained, Billy. Billy, look at me. I need you to give George a chance, okay? You're not being disloyal to Dad by liking George. He doesn't want to be anything but your friend... and maybe one day something more. Nobody will ever replace your dad, honey. For you too? For me too. How's Billy? He'll be fine. - First call. - First call. - Lutz residence, how may I help you? - Can I talk to my daughter, please? Yeah, sure, she's... She's right here. Okay. Your mother's gotta stop gushing over me, seriously. It's embarrassing now. Hello? - Hey, Ma. - Hi. No, we're all moved in. - Yeah, Ma. - Are you cold? No, Ma. Yeah. - What is it, baby? - Nothing. - Are you okay, baby? - No. I don't feel well. - Give me a kiss. - I can do it, I can do it. No, you can't. Come here, come here. Honey, I'm gonna make you some tea. How many brothers and sisters do you have? - Chelsea? - Hey, Mommy. Hi, hon. Who are you talking to? - The girl who lives in my closet. - Oh, yeah? - And what's her name? - Jodie. You know there are plenty of other little girls to play with in town too? I know, but Jodie says they're all mean. Is that Jodie? No, that's someone else. Who? I'm not supposed to say who. She says it's an A-hole. You are not allowed to say that word. George, George. - Look what I found. - What is that? Where'd you find that? Harry and I found it. - Where? - In the basement. Not the basement. My office. You listen to me. You don't go down there. Understand? Guys, would you help me with the groceries? Go on, go help your mom. I'm sorry. Go on. - How are you feeling? - Good, good. I found a babysitter off a board at the grocery store. Billy will love that. How about we call her the young-adult-sitter? Where's Chelsea? Where's Chelsea? Chelsea? Chelsea? Chelsea! Chelsea. Hey, give me your hand. Give me your hand, sweetie. - Chelsea, go to George. - Come on. Hey, give me your hand. What were you thinking? You could have fallen in the water. Jodie wanted to see the boat. Somebody should have been watching you. Billy, get up. Billy, I gotta go pee. Chelsea. Goddamn it, Harry. Seriously. You trying to kill me? Come on, get away from there. Hey, that's enough. Hey! George? Hon, what are you doing down here? It's the only place that's warm in this damn house. Somebody keeps opening the windows. What is that? You tell me. - Why don't you come back to bed. - No, I can't sleep. I'm sorry, baby. Don't... Don't talk to me like I'm one of your kids, okay? - What? - That goddamn dog woke me up. Billy's dog. Found him in the boathouse. - But you locked it. - Yeah. Hey, and guess what I found in Billy's room. You ready to talk about those keys? There's not a lot in this world can't be solved with an apology, Billy. I'm not apologizing for something I didn't do... George. Get to work, buddy. ""Get to work, buddy."" ""Katch 'em..."" George? George? George, you down there? George? What? What's the matter? Did you do that thing with the magnets? Nothing. Just seeing things, I guess. You look hideous. You're rather repulsive yourself, Mr. Lutz. - Where's the babysitter? - Babysitter? Told you guys, I don't need a babysitter. - I'm old enough. - Baby, I know you can... I'm not letting her watch us. She's not coming in, I won't let her. I won't. - She's not coming in. - Billy, listen to me. - I won't leave you alone. - I can't believe you hired a babysitter. - I told you I was old enough. - Hi. - I'm Lisa, the babysitter. - Great. Can I take your coat? Okay. Hi. I'm Billy. You sure you don't want a babysitter? Would you like me to show you around? No, it's okay. I know it already. I used to sit for the Defeos. Kind of freaky being back here. I'm Billy. Yeah, I got you the first time. Have a good night, Billy. This is just what we needed, don't you think? Yeah. Definitely. You feeling all right? You know what? I feel better. I think I just needed to get out of the house. Come on, drink up. Are you trying to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz? That's the appeal of marriage, hon. Hopefully, I won't have to. Be right out. Hungry? Kid, you read my mind. The kids, they're... They're going through a tough time. I guess they're just adjusting to everything. Yeah, well, we all are. Do you feel different? What do you mean? About us. About me. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I feel like for the first time in my life, I'm sure about something. And that's you. And I'm gonna spend the rest of my life making you happy. Oh, boy, you know how to turn on that Lutz charm. Some people say his tongue is fake. I think it's all him. Got this at a pinball arcade. Cool. So do you French? Do I what? Kissing, tongues. No. Did your family know the Defeos? - The who? - The family that lived here before you. No, we just moved here. Well, you know what happened to them, don't you? No. I really shouldn't be telling you this. Your parents are gonna be pissed. It's okay. Stop. That's not how you play. - I can't hear you. - Stop it. Let me try. You're killing him. So this wack job, Ronnie, the guy that lived here. People in this town say he heard voices telling him to do it. The guy was a nut. I mean, first he thinks his dog's out to get him. So he kills it. A few days later, he thinks his family is a bunch of demons. So you know what he did? Wasted them. How did he do it? Do what? You are way too young to hear this. So cover your ears. And don't listen. A rifle. He went room to room, splattering their heads as they slept. He killed his brothers in this very room. Right here. In these beds. It's kind of gross you guys still sleep in here. Actually, it's fucking sick. Yeah. I'm totally freaking you out, kid. I suck at babysitting. This was the little brat's room. Jodie's. You know, they found her in there. - Jodie says you're a bad babysitter. - Yeah? Well, Jodie's... What's the word? Dead. Is not. That little shit got me fired. Dare you to go in there. You give me your Kiss poster if I do it? Okay. Okay. You're going to make her mad. Come on, guys. Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny. Billy, Michael. It's not opening. I can't open it. - Unlock the fucking door. - There's no lock. This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out. Billy, Michael. Let me out. Let me out of here. Let me out of here! What's going on? Let me out. Hi, Lisa. Look what Ronnie did. Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out! Help me. Let me out! I saw Jodie. I saw Jodie. Who's Jodie? The little girl. She's dead. She's supposed to be dead. - It's one thing to pull a prank. - We didn't pull a prank. - It's another one to hurt someone. - It was this house. Shut up! - George. - I got this under control. You don't have you under control. What you guys did was wrong. Stop it, Kathy. Whatever you're doing... whatever you're saying doesn't work. From now on, I'm doing the disciplining around here, end of story. This house is bad, Mommy. Michael, honey. There's no bad houses. There's just bad people. Why didn't you tell us about the people who died here? - Where did you hear that? - The babysitter told me... that two little boys died in our room. Goddamn babysitter's an idiot. Get to bed. We'll deal with this in the morning. No, I'm not sleeping in that room. It's gross. - Me neither. - Wipe that stupid look off your face... and go to bed. Run. Why all the yelling, Mommy? It's nothing. It's over now, baby. I need you to tell me what happened with Lisa, honey. Lisa was being mean to Jodie. So Jodie hurt her. - Jodie. - It's okay, Mommy. Jodie won't hurt you. She thinks you're a good mommy. But the man who lives here... she says he's bad. She wants him to go away. He makes her do bad things. Move it... from there to there. Go. And, Billy, don't come in until you're finished. What? Is this discipline or torture? Thought it was meat loaf. When the body suffers, the spirit flowers. It's what my dad taught me. His dad's not around to teach him that, now, is he? Billy, why is George such a jerk? He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag. And a weirdo. And a doofus and a dipstick. Catch them. Kill them. Catch them. Kill them. Catch them. Kill them. Catch them. Kill them. Kill them. - No! No! - Look at me. - No! - What's the matter? - God! - It's me. - It's me. - God! Baby, it's all right. Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz? No. But after this week, I'm gonna give it... some serious thought. Suffer from headaches, nausea? Actually, I feel great now. Weird as that may sound. Well, there's no sign of a concussion. No sign of any bruising at all. I want you to give Dr. Stone a call. Wait, wait, wait. This is a psychiatrist. - Do I look nuts to you? - I'm not trying to offend you here. I'm just trying to help you figure out the problem. I feel like it's my fault, George. - Kath. - I was the one who wanted this place. - I put too much pressure on you. - This is the life... that I want too, okay? We got the old American dream here. Okay? There's no way in hell... that I'm letting that get away now. I love you, George. Billy, can I get my teddy? She's real hungry. Okay, go. And hurry up. Mom finds out I let you out of my sight, she's gonna kill me. Hi, Mommy. Look at me, Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! - Chelsea. - Chelsea, don't move. Just sit down. Chelsea. Chelsea. Hold the ladder. Honey, stay there. Chelsea. Chelsea. - Chelsea. - Goddamn it, Chelsea. Which way? Which way did they go? Going left. Chelsea. What are you doing up here? I have to go with Jodie, Mommy. Baby... you come to Mommy. No! George. - Hang on. - Hurry. George! George, please, God, I'm slipping. George! George! Chelsea. What would you...? Why would you do that? Sorry. I'm sorry. You can't do that to Mommy. - Jodie wanted to show me something. - There is no Jodie, okay? - Yes, there is. - No, there isn't! - You have to stop this! - Jodie's real. - Jodie's real. She's... - She is not real! Liar! Liar! Liar! I've seen her. She was gonna show me Daddy. I just wanted to see Daddy. Jodie promised to take me to Daddy. She says I can stay here so we can play together... forever and ever. Do you miss your daddy? Yes. - Do you miss your daddy a lot? - Yes. I know you miss your daddy, baby. But no one can see him because... he's in heaven. He's with the angels. He's with the angels. I just got so scared. What's the matter with you people? Wacko family. Father Callaway? Father. Kathy Lutz. Hello. Do you have a moment? It's my family. We've changed. It's... It's like we've grown apart. I don't think I understand. There's something... There's something evil in my house. I know it sounds... crazy, I know that. I would think the same. I just don't know where else to go. There was a family... lived here some time ago. They had a similar problem. The Defeos. You knew them? I'm living in their house. Now, hold it steady. Because if you get shaky, I get shaky. Go! What, are you crying? Why are you crying? That wasn't so bad. Pick up another log. Hurry up, pick up another log. Hurry up. Put your hands up there. Put your hands up there. No. Put... We're friends. We're having fun, right? Put your hands up there. Go! Come here, little girl. You're my favorite girl. Catch them. Kill them. George. I think there's something seriously wrong here. Something's not right. What's not right? We need to get out of here. To just go. Just pack up and go. No, no, no. You know, you can't run away from your problems, Kath. Please, let's go, George. - Somewhere. Anywhere. - Did you hear that? Do you hear that squeak? I gotta fix that squeak. Because, you know, these houses, they're big... Big projects. Kath, and you can't just walk away from it. How did you get so fucking stupid? What? Everything we have is in this house. Everything. I'm not worried about our goddamn money. Oh, our money. George, we're losing each other. Don't you see that? We stay here, we'll have a house for the family... only there won't be a family. It's always so cold in here. Would you let the stove alone and pay attention to me? I'm not going anywhere, neither are you. So shut up about that! Just shut up! Goddamn it. You're the one who wanted this godforsaken house. Well, now you got it. Mom! Mom! Home sweet home. What is it, sweetie? We can't find Harry anywhere. He's gone. I'll help you look in a sec, sweetie. You seen Harry, George? No, I haven't, Billy. Maybe he ran away. Harry never runs away, George. What's the matter with you, William? Get out of here now. - Now! - Fine. Come on, Michael. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. - Hello? - Is your mommy home? Hold on a second. Mommy, there's someone at the door. Who is it, honey? Come in, Father. This is gonna sound strange... but you know the doll with one eye that your daughter is holding? Well, that belonged to the little girl who lived here before you. Yes, it was left here. No, Mrs. Lutz, it was not left here. Father, what exactly are you trying to tell me? I knew the Defeos very well. I presided over their funeral. Jodie Defeo was buried with that doll. Oh, heavenly Father. Almighty God... we ask you to bless... and sanctify this house. To bless all who live here... and to bring them the abundance of all thy fruits. Get out. Father! Father! Why are you leaving us? What's the matter? It's okay. I'm here. Catch them. Kill them. Oh, goddamn it, Harry! Catch them. Kill them. Catch them. Kill them. Catch them. There was a crime. A murder. You know, the town has moved on. And it is a distant memory now, and the house is fine. We don't open for a few more minutes. ""Voices told him to do it."" ""He just moved into the basement."" ""Twenty-eights days later he killed them all."" Oh, my God. ""Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham."" ""He started a mission for Indians."" ""He slaughtered them all."" ""Over 20 bodies were found in the lake."" Catch them. Kill them. Father. Why did you run away from my house? Why did you abandon us? Your house frightens me, Mrs. Lutz. I just read about this man, Ketcham... who tortured Indians on my land. On my basement. I read about how he slit his throat... so that his presence would live forever. Do you believe this could be true? Ronnie Defeo came to me weeks before the murders... and he spoke about hearing voices and seeing things in the house. I didn't believe him until yesterday. Mrs. Lutz, get you and your family out of that house... right now. - Hello? - George. George, I've just been to see Father Callaway. Listen to me, you gotta get you and the kids out of the house. George? Are you there? George? Billy! Michael! Where's George? He's in the boathouse. George, we have to get out of here now. George! Are you fucking crazy, George? Have you lost your mind? You tried to kill me. - Chelsea! - Mommy! Mommy! I'm down here, Mommy! Chelsea, honey, what are you doing down here? I think she misses her daddy. Don't you? Give me back my daughter. I wanna talk to you. Wait. I wanna talk to you! Kids, get down here, now! Kids, get down here! - Billy, help me push this! - Mom, where are you going? Billy! - Hurry. Go. - Billy! Mom, why are you wet? Mommy! Mommy! Come on, Mom! Hurry. Billy, come on! Run! Go, go, go! You're stuck! You're stuck! Stay here! Great! Let go of my mom, you bastard! Let go right now! Let go. - What the hell is your problem? - Let's go. These kids are out of control. - Mom, it's stuck! - It won't open! Where's Chelsea? Chelsea! - Hurry, hurry, Billy. Hurry. - Come on. Let's go. Be quiet, be quiet. Billy! I want you to hold on tight. Jump, baby. - Come on, honey. - Come on. - Come on, Michael. - No, Mommy. - No. - Hurry, baby. Come on, Michael. Come on, Michael. - Come on, hurry. - Let's get out of here. - Come here. Come here. - No. You leave him alone. Kill them. Don't hurt him! Back the fuck up! Kill them. Hurry. Let's grab some rope. Kill them. Kathy, kill me! You kill me, or I'll kill you! Nobody's dying today. Okay, let's get him in the boat. Why are we taking him? Let's just leave him here. I can't explain it to you right now. We have to get him away from the house. Don't even look at it, Kathy. Let's get out of here., Let's see what you got. I need more runners. I can't write the business fast enough. You gotta see Granger. 8720. Yeah. Yeah. Hold it a minute. Beat it, Mottola! Mr. Granger? Chicago's on the line. Yeah. This is Combs. Why haven't we heard from you? Everybody else is in. We had problems with the law this morning. The mayor promised to get tough on the rackets... so he shut everybody down for a couple of hours to make it look good. Nothing serious. It just put us a little behind. - Been making your payoffs? - Hell, yes! He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about. Finish your count and get it up here. I don't want to be here all night. The man's going to be real happy. We cleared over ten grand this week. We cleared 22 here. What the hell! You got the whole Chicago South Side. How do you expect my eight lousy spots to compete with that? They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 in Gary, and 20 in Cicero. Looks like you're bringing up the rear. I just got the count. I'll put the take on the 4:15. We'll be waiting. Mottola! Take this up to Chicago on the 4:15. They'll be waiting for it at the clearinghouse. And don't stop for any entertainment. Get a cab over on 7th. Cut it out! Hey, you there! Stop! Hey, you! Stop that man! Stop him! He's got my wallet! Stop him! Stop that man! He's got all of my money! Stop him! Stop him! Goddamn nigger-lover! I'm gonna get you someday for this! Sucker egg! Don't let him get away! He's got my wallet! He's got all my money! - My wallet! He's got my wallet! - We got it! What happened? Did he get you with the knife? - You need a doctor. I'll call a cop. - No, no! No cops! You wanted by the law or something? No, it's okay. Are you nuts, carrying a wad like that in a neighborhood like this? Thanks. I'm obliged to you. I gotta get going. You ain't going nowhere on this leg. I gotta. Gotta run some slots in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind in the payoffs. They think I've been holding out on 'em. They gave me 'til 4:00 to come up with the cash. If they don't get it, I'm dead. It don't look good, Gramps. It's almost 4:00 now. I'll give you and your friend a hundred bucks to deliver it for me. I don't know. That mug that hit you is mad enough at me already. What if he's around the corner, waiting with some friends? He won't know you're carrying it. You've gotta help me. I'm sorry, pal. I'm gonna maybe help you get to a doctor... but I ain't about to walk into no knife for you. How about you? All you gotta do is put it in the door slot. I'll give you the whole 100. What makes you think you can trust him? He didn't do shit. Butt out! I gave him back the wallet. How far is this place? 1811 Mason. Put it in box 3- C. You won't have no trouble. There's $5,000 there... and here's a hundred bucks for you. Okay, I'll make your drop for you. And don't worry, you can trust me. Hey. Hey! If those goons search you, you ain't gonna get far carrying it there. - What'll we do? - You got a bag or something? - How about a handkerchief? - Here's a handkerchief! Give it to me. Give me the money. Just hurry, will you? You got any more? Better give it all to me if you want to keep it. They think I've been holding out. My wife got sick, and I had to pay the bill. Stuff it down your pants here, like that. Got it? Hurry, will ya? Ain't a tough guy in the world that's gonna frisk you there. - Thanks. - Yeah. Where to? - Which way is Mason? - Twenty blocks south. - Go north, Joliet Station, fast! - Right. What's so funny? I just made the world's easiest five grand! - Come on, Luther! Come on! - Hold on, man! Okay! Hustle! In here! Man, was that beautiful! I thought for sure he was on to us. No, you had him all the way. All the way! Wai... Luther. Good God! We're millionaires. - Did you know he was that loaded? - Hell, no! I just cut into him. I would've settled for pawning one of them shoes. Oh, God! Do you... Come on. Let's get out of here. We'll split it up tonight. Heya, Marge! - Hi, kid. - Hi, Hooker. She's on stage. Hi, Hooker. Gettin' married or something? Get used to it, Leonard. I'm going to look this good from now on. - Whaddaya say, Ed? - Hi, Hooker. I wanna talk... Hey, Hooker, you gettin' married or somethin'? For Christ's sake, Ed, did you hear that? Harry drops four beats in the middle of my goddamn routine! - How long do I gotta put up with that? Crystal! Leonard, you're on. You wanna get outta here tonight? I come into some dough. I can't. I got a I'll spend 50 on you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. .. opens up his pants, the duck sticks his head out. One lady says to the other, ""See what I see?"" She says, ""So what? You've seen one, you've seen 'em all."" She says, ""Yes, but this one's eating my popcorn."" You see that guy Harry, he can't keep time. Supposing there's some Hollywood movie agent out there. All those years of training right down the drain. Ain't seen you in months. Thought you took a fall. Just a little hard times. Everything's jake now. How about a ten spot on the line? There's a lot of action there on 28th Street. Pay you 35... Three grand on the red. - Are you nuts? No, I feel lucky. Hooker, I can't accept that. It's too big a bet. - There's a house limit. - Take it. - But Hooker here... - Take it! Twenty-two, black. Tough luck, kid. Lucky for me it came up black. A fella could get in trouble here, losin' a bet like that. Listen, Jimmy, can't we do it again, huh? Seven! Don't worry about it. There's always more where that came from. Oh, don't worry about it, he says. Three thousand dollars! Thanks, Hooker. Comes in here with $50 he's going to spend on me! - Thanks for the evening, Hooker. - It's not over yet. Next time you wanna spend $50 on me, mail it. Listen, will ya... They found Mottola, drunk in a dive in Joliet. He never got on the train. I don't wanna hear about his day, Greer. What happened to the money? He lost it to a couple of con artists on his way out of the spot. - How much? - Eleven thousand. Okay, I better get on the phone to New York... see what the big mick wants to do about it. I have a pretty good idea, though. - Doyle, can I talk to you? - I'm busy, Floyd. It's important. We had a little trouble in Chicago today. One of our runners got hit for 11 grand. What makes you think he just didn't pocket it? We checked his story with a tipster. He was cleaned by two grifters. They working for anybody? I don't know. Could be. We're running that down now. Have some local people take care of them. Nothing fancy. We've got to discourage this kind of thing. You follow? Johnny Hooker! - If you ain't a sharper in them linens! Evenin', Louise. Hey, Ma! If I didn't know you better, I'd swear you had some class. Johnny, Luther said you was something to see today! I don't know, Alva. I gotta get faster tyin' that bundle. I still give 'em too much time to think. Bushwah! I used to make that switch with slower hands than you got. 'Course, the Up and Down Broadway was my best game. Me and Luther didn't make much on it, but it wasn't so touchy. Them marks can beat you up bad when they catch you makin' that switch. Come on, Leroy. We'll be late for church. Ma, they were closin' in on Machine Gun Kelly! Who you rootin' for anyhow? - Hey, Hooker! - Can't help you, Leroy. - You can't beat the house. - Nuts! Since when do you go to church at night? Since they started late bingo. I'm gonna ask the Lord for some of that cash while He's still payin' off. Luther, look in on the baby from time to time, will you? - You too, Louise? - Child, yeah, got to go pray. See ya. Hey, Erie. - Gimme! Gimme, gimme! - There's your cut. Guy turned out to be an oil well. Which way'd he go? - Due north. He was gonna take it all. Ah, the bastard. He can blow his nose all the way. There you go, Luther. Six G's. - You're late. Where you been? - I had a couple of appointments. How much did you lose? All of it. In one goddamn night? What are you spraying money around like that for? You could've been nailed! - I checked. There were no dicks there. But you're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp! - Didn't teach you to be no pimp. - What's eatin' you? - I've blown money before. - No class grifter would've done it. - You think my play is bad? - I think you're the best. I wouldn't be getting out, otherwise. What the hell are you talkin' about? I'm getting too old for this racket. You hang on too long and you start embarrassing yourself. We just took off on the biggest score we've ever had. It's nothing compared to what you could be making on the big con. But you played the big con. You told me yourself it was some dumb game for mama's boys and flakes. Hell, I never played no big con. I hung around and picked up a few things. Ain't no rich boys gonna trust a hungry nigger enough to be conned. But I'll tell you... I've been looking for this one all my life, Johnny. Now I have a chance to step out when I'm ahead. Come on! What would you do with yourself? I have a brother in K. C., runs a freight outlet. I can go halfsies with him. It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal. I got an old friend in Chicago named Henry Gondorff. I want you to look him up. There ain't a better inside man alive. - He'll teach you all you gotta know. - To hell with that. I want to work with you, Luther. I'm out, Johnny. Yeah, sure. If that's the way you want it. That's the way I want it. How do you like that Coleman? After five years. - He knew he was holding you back. - Yeah, but we were partners. If it weren't for Luther, I'd still be hustling pinball at Gianelli's. I don't need more than what I got. You ain't gonna have anything if you don't lay off the games of chance. There's a depression on. - Yeah, there's always a depression on. If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much. - I like griftin'. - You could buy yourself some things. - What? - New clothes, a car. I got clothes, and I don't know how to drive. What else do you got to sell? Hey, Hooker! Come on, you son of a... Hi there, Snyder. What's the matter? Things a little slow down at the bunco department? Somebody lose the dominoes? You scored blood money today, and you need a friend. Go find yourself a shoplifter to roll. You got the wrong guy, pal. I've been home with the flu all day. - Stake out my toilet if you want. - Keep talkin'! I'll tell you what you did, smart boy. You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxie's. You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th. If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan... it would've been perfect. You're crazy. I ain't stupid enough to play for no racket's money. Not intentionally, maybe. That don't cut no ice with Lonnegan. - He'll swat you like a fly. - Yeah, well... I'll square it with the fixer. Nobody can buy you a prayer if I put the finger on you. Now, I figure your end of the score was at least three G's. - I want two, no matter what it was. - My take was only one. Then you're gonna have to come up with another grand somewhere. All right. You're a smart egg, Hooker. No sense getting dead over two grand. Relax, Erie. I'll bill ya. - I thought you blew all your money. - I did. The stuff I gave him is counterfeit. They'll spot it the first place he tries to spend it. Are you crazy, giving him counterfeit money? Hey! Wait up! Where you goin'? What the hell are you gonna do if Snyder puts the finger on you? - You're committin' suicide, kid. - What difference does it make? If Snyder knows, so does everybody else. He never gets anything first. Hey, listen to me. Don't go back to your place tonight. Don't go anyplace you usually go. You hear me? Damn! There's no answer at Luther's. Look, you better get out of town or something. Hey, lady, lady, let go! Ma'am! Ma'am! Hey! I want my nickel back for that telephone! No, sir. Nobody here did. 1521 North Bryant. - Is he dead? - I don't know. There was a big fight. I don't know. Somebody must've pushed him. - Jesus! - Luther! - Luther! - Jesus! God! No! No! No! Luther! Luther! What happened? God, who would do such a thing to you, Luther? Come on. Come on! Let's get out of here. Come on! If Snyder catches you here, you're dead! - Get outta here! - Outta the way. Help me, help me, help me! Excuse me. I'm looking for a guy named Henry Gondorff. You know him? No. You sure? - Beat it. - Luther Coleman sent me. - Are you Hooker? - Yeah. Why didn't you say so? We heard about Luther last night. Come on. I thought maybe you were a cop or something. It's the room in the back. He wasn't expecting you so soon, though. Thanks. The great Henry Gondorff. Turn it off! You sober? Turn it off, will ya? Glad to meet you, kid. You're a real horse's ass. Luther said I could learn something from you. I already know how to drink. Sorry about Luther. He was the best street worker I ever saw. He had you down as a big-timer. What happened? I conned a senator from Florida on a stock deal. A real lop-ear; thought he was gonna take over General Electric. Some chanteusie woke him, though, and he put the feds on me. You mean you blew it. Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth. He didn't tell me you was a screw up either. You played any big cons since then? I lammed around a bunch of bohunk towns, one kick ahead of the G-men. Would be still, if Billie hadn't set me up here. Don't kid yourself, friend. I still know how. You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat? I picked something up along the way. Is Lonnegan after you too? I don't know. I ain't seen anybody. You never do, kid. Doyle? Yeah. We just talked to Chicago. They got one of the grifters last night... a nigger. - How about the other one? - They're still looking for him. - Who did Combs put on it? - He gave it to Riley and Cole. They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed. They figure maybe he skipped town. You wanna keep after him? You see that fella in the red sweater? His name's Danny McCoy. Works a few of the protection rackets... when he's waiting for something better. Danny and I have known each other since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd. Because if he ever finds out I can be beat by one lousy grifter... I'll have to kill him and every other hood... who wants to muscle in on my Chicago operation. - You follow? - Yes, sir. Good lad. You feeling all right this morning, Henry? Yeah, fine. You mind opening up the round a little early today? We got some business coming in before hours. - Sure. - Check the main gearing, will ya? Man O' War started rattling yesterday and threw a kid on its head. Great little countess, that Billie. She runs a spiffy house up there too. You plan to spend the rest of your life here? I could do a lot worse. Listen, am I gonna learn to play the big con or not? What's your hurry? - I wanna play for Lonnegan. - You know anything about the guy? Yeah, he croaked Luther. Anything else I gotta know? All right. He runs a numbers racket on the South Side. He owns a packing house, a few banks... Yeah, and half the politicians in New York and Chicago. Not a fix in this world is gonna cool him out if he blows on you. - I'll get him anyway. - Why? 'Cause I don't know enough about killing to kill him. You can't do it alone, you know. It takes a mob of guys and money to make 'em look good. - I know plenty of guys. - It's not like playing winos. - You can't outrun Lonnegan. - I never played for no winos. You gotta keep his con even after you take his money. - He can't know you took him. - You're scared of him. Right down to my socks, buster. You're talking about a guy who'd kill a grifter... over a chunk of money wouldn't support him for two days. You're gonna go for him. Just don't want a hothead looking to get even, coming back halfway through... saying, ""It ain't enough,"" 'cause it's all we're gonna get. Can you get a mob together? After what happened to Luther, I can't get more than 300 guys. Luther said you learn fast. I hope he's right. Lonnegan gets most of his income from the numbers... even though he's been putting more money into his savings and loan business. - Think he's moving out of the racket? - No. He owns most of the stock, and it's traded. My guess is he's just trying to build himself a respectable image. He came out of Five Points... but he's been telling everybody he was born in Forest Hills. He knows the market, though. I don't think we can take him on a stocks deal. Twist, what about the numbers? It's run out of a packing house on 14th by a guy named Combs. Lonnegan comes out every three weeks or so to check on it, but... he stays away from the day-to-day stuff in case it's raided. These are two of Combs's favorite torpedoes: Riley and Cole. You ever seen 'em? No. They're the ones who hit Luther. They also got the numbers runner you conned: a guy named Mottola. Found him in a quarry with a knife in his eye. Lonnegan's had seven or eight people rubbed on his way up. His pattern has been to get close to a racket boss... Learn the operation, then move in on it. He's done it to Gorman, O'Donnell, Buchalman. He took the numbers from Sharkey. All four of these guys are dead. He's vindictive as hell, Henry. Kills for pride. Doesn't add up he'd let Hooker get away from him. You see anything, kid, you let us know. If they put you on the spot, we gotta fold the con. You got that? Yeah. You sure it's gotta be one of these two guys? Nope. They're just the only ones we know of. Time. Set me up five more beers, will you, Danny? - You the owner here? - That's right. Lt. Snyder, Bunco. That's a Joliet badge, Snyder. Don't cut much up here. Looking for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap. - Thought he might've come here. - Don't think so. I know everyone in the place, and I always bounce the lamsters. All right if I look around in here? No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go. I don't really need your permission. I don't know what to do with this guy. He's an Irishman who doesn't drink, doesn't smoke and doesn't chase dames. He's a grand knight in the Knights of Columbus... and he only goes out to play faro. Sometimes plays 15, 20 hours at a time; just him against the house. - Roulette, craps? - He won't touch 'em. The croupier at Gilman's says he never plays anything he can't win. Sports? He likes to be seen with fighters sometimes... but he doesn't go to the fights or bet on 'em. Jesus. Does he do anything where he's not alone? Just poker. And he cheats. Pretty good at it too. Where does he play? The porters say he runs a braced game on the Century Limited... when he comes out here from New York. $100 minimum, straight poker. A lot of high rollers ride that train just to play him. That sounds good, J. J. Which way are the rooms? - Who told you this guy was in here? - Nobody. I just know what kind of woman he likes. I'm gonna check all the joy houses till I find him. Maybe I could help you if you tell me his name. I doubt it. Which way are the rooms? Right through there. But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. - What are you gonna do, call the cops? - I don't have to. You'd be busting in on the chief of police just up the hall. We'll play it out here. A huge duke is too simple. With no fix, we're gonna need a con with a surefire blow-off. I think we ought to play this guy on the payoff. It's the tightest game we got, and it's not all over the papers yet. Lonnegan is a fast egg. He's not going to sit still for a standard play. What does that leave us? We can't con the payoff to a banker. We'll use the wire. Haven't known a poker player didn't wanna beat the ponies. The wire's been out of date for ten years. That's why he won't know it. I'm not sure I know it. It'll take two of us working the inside. Any objections to Hooker as second man? All right. We'll give Lonnegan the hook on the train and play him here. J. J., you think I can get in that poker game? Just show up with a lot of money and look like a sucker. I also gotta win. By the way, any of you guys been passing bad money lately? If he comes in again, stall him so I can get a look at him. Fella by the name of Stenner had this place 'til about six months ago... but he had to give it up. It doesn't look so good, but maybe you can fix it up a little bit. Watch your step when you come in. There's a dip down to the left. - How does it look, Eddie? - It looks all right, Kid. It's big enough, and it's off the street. It's kind of short notice. I'm not sure we can get it done by Saturday. Got to. Gondorff's riding the mark down from New York on the Century. We'll take it. That building at the end of the alley, do you manage that? For 15 years. I'll need a corner room facing this way. - How much a week? - Only rents by the month. Two hundred and fifty for the two of them. Last time I expect to see you down here. Never heard of the place. It's been a while since I stocked the wire store. Not many mobs playing that anymore. All we'll need is the bookie setup for now. I'll rent you everything I got in the warehouse for two grand. That'll give you phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand. - That's pretty steep, Benny. - Gondorff's still a hot item. - Where would I be if he gets hit? - Just give us what you can. We'll send a truck. How do you want to work this? Flat rate or percentage? - Who's the mark? - Doyle Lonnegan. Flat rate. The guy in the black hat with the gimp. He's not as tough as he thinks. Neither are we. - Mr. Shaw? - Right. You wanted to see me? I hear there's a friendly poker game on this train. You know anything about it? - Oh, a little. - Thank you, sir. - Can you get me in that game? - Oh, I don't know. There's usually a waiting list. That'll get you first alternate, sir. I'll see what I can do. Twist! - Patty, me boy! How are you? - How are you, Twist? Champ, you're lookin' like a million! Good to see you! Goldie, you old son of a gun. I saw the Kid in Denver. He says to say hello to you. Joiner, are you still workin' those shapes? Any number you want, Twist! - Good to see you again. - Okay, Lacey. Good to see you. - It's good to see you. Come on in! - Dukey, how are you? - When did you get back in town? - A couple of days ago. You heard about Luther Coleman, didn't you? Yeah. Some of the boys were passin' the hat for Alva and the kids. - I never seen the guys so worked up. - Don't worry about it, Dukey. We're gonna send a little calling card of our own. Gondorff is setting up a wire store. I'm gonna need a 20-man boost right away. I got plenty of talent out there tonight. Take your pick. Lace! This is a tough one. These boys have got to be the quill. Get me the sheet. Let's see who's in town. Patty, give me the sheet. Sure. Gondorff's already on... Twist, you know this guy? No, I never saw him before. He's a dick, though. Hello, Snyder. - What are you doin' up here? - I'm on vacation. You seen that friend of yours lately? No, no. He packed it in. Enrolled in detective school. If you see him... you tell him he better pay up before I get to him. That son of a bitch. Thanks, Lace. Let's see what we got here. Horse Face Lee, Slim Miller... Suitcase Murphy and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Cryin' Jonesy and the Boone Kid from Denver. Dippy Burke and Limehouse Chappie from New York. These and the guys outside should give you 30 or more to choose from. Good, Dukey. Have them down at Stenner's old pool hall before 6:00. We're gonna run the route tonight. Okay, Twist, but... if this thing blows up, remember, I can't do you no good downtown. Gondorff is federal. Dukey, if this thing blows up... the feds will be the least of our problems. Yeah? - You in? - Yeah, I think so. I gave the kayducer a C- note. Did you find out the deck? He usually plays with a Tallyho Fan or a Tallyho Circle. I got you one of each. He likes to cold-deck low, eights or nines. That's nice work, J. J. Here. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't mention it, ma'am. - He'd like to join us. - Yes, Clyde is a member of our firm. She picked him clean. He never missed it. My God, it looks like he's expecting a big night. Must be 15, 20 grand here. He's waiting for you in the card room. Let him wait. Just worry about your end, kid. If we ever get to it. Excuse me. You sure you checked this guy out? He seemed like a pleasant man; a lot of cash on him. Two-hundred-dollar suit, expensive luggage. I'll vouch for him. Why isn't he here then? Don't worry. He'll be here. All right. What're you doin'? Always drink gin with a mark, kid. He can't tell if you cut it. Two thousand for you, Mr. Clayton? Thank you. All right, gentlemen. Should we not wait for him? Let's go. I think that's a good idea. Mr. Clemens, give me the cards. Sorry I'm late, guys. I was takin' a crap. The name's Shaw. Mr. Shaw, meet Mr. Jameson from Chicago. Mr. Lombard from Philadelphia. - And Mr. Lonnegan from New York. - Pleased to meet you. Mr. Clayton, Pittsburgh. Any of you guys want to make a little book in Chicago, I'm the guy to see. Game is straight poker... $100 minimum, table stakes. Mr. Shaw, this is a gentleman's game. We assume you're all good for your debts. - How much would you like, Mr. Shaw? - I'll start with 5,000. Mr. Shaw, we usually require a tie at this table. If you don't have one, we can get you one. Hey, that'd be real nice of you, Mr. Lonneman. Lonnegan. Name's Curly Jackson. Worked for Gad Bryan outta Baldwin. Jackson? Jackson, Jackson. Oh, yeah. Ever play the wire, Curly? Roped for it long ago. I can shill, mark board, anything you want. I don't run with riffraff, and I only drink on weekends. Me specialty's an Englishman. We got a rack of suits over there. Pick yourself a nice tweed one. That's all right. I've got all my own stuff. Doyle? One. Bill? I'll take one. - Shaw? - Three. And the dealer will take one. Bet 500. I'll call. Call and raise. - Three hundred. - I'm out. Fold. Your three... and raise... 500. That's eight to me. Call. Jacks on top. Beats me. Three tens. Tough luck, Lonnihan. But that's what you get for playing with your head up your ass. Couple more like that, we can all go to bed early. The name's Lonnegan. Doyle Lonnegan. You're gonna remember that... or you're gonna get yourself another game. You follow? Bring it right up here! Eddie, we brought you a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire. You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything. And just as fast as Western Union gets 'em. - Does J. J. know how to use that thing? All he's gotta do is read. The name is Joe Erie. Joe Erie. You played for any particular mobs? No. - You ever play the wire before, Erie? - No. I never played no big con before, but... Luther Coleman was a friend of mine, and I thought maybe... there'd be somethin' I could do. You get that nose in Duke Boudreau's tonight? Yeah. You got moxie, Erie. Get yourself a suit. Thanks. I'll bet three. Call and raise 200. Call. - No. - I'm out. Call. Aces over. Three cowboys. All red, queen high. - Well, that finishes me. - Don't worry about it, pal. They wouldn't have let you in here if you weren't a chump! Lombard'll be joining you in a couple of minutes. - Now, look here, Shaw... - I've had enough of this game... and quite enough of this company. Check me out, Clemens. I guess that just leaves the three of us. Yes, Mr. Shaw. That just leaves us three. Mr. Clayton, I think we should take a break for five minutes. Tempers seem to be running a little high. Ah, come on, Linneman, I was just startin' to do good. Stack me a cooler. We'll be in the station in another hour. The other guys are the big losers. You're still okay. Fix me a deck... threes and nines. I'll cut it in on Clayton's deal. - What do you want Clayton to get? - Nothin'. I want him outta there early. I'm gonna bust that bastard bookie in one play. Four hundred to you, Mr. Jameson. You're even. Well, it just wasn't my night. Oh, I need it. - You know what time we get in? - No, I don't. Hey, where's your ante? Every time I had anything, he stayed in front of me. Five hundred. Your five. One thousand. I'll fold. I'll play. Cards? Two. Three. Five hundred. Your five hundred, and one thousand. Your one thousand. I'll raise you two thousand. Your two thousand. Mr. Clemens... give me $10,000 more. I'll call. Four nines. Four Jacks. You owe me 15 grand, pal. Must've left my wallet in my room. Don't hand me any of that crap! When you come to a game like this, you bring your money! How do I know you won't take a powder? I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll send a boy around to your room in five minutes. You better have the money, or it's gonna be all around Chicago that you welched. You won't be able to get a game of jacks! Cash me in for the rest of these bums. You're on, kid. But I gotta tell you, it's a hard act to follow. - How'd it go? - We got working money. - Hey? - Yeah? - He's steamin'. - Yeah. Watch yourself. Doyle, I know I gave him four threes! He had to make a switch! We can't let him get away with that. What was I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me? Name's Kelly. Shaw sent me. Your boss is quite a card player, Mr. Kelly. - How does he do it? - He cheats. In that case, I'll keep my money, and we'll have another game. You don't have any to keep. Here's your wallet. He hired a dame to take it from you. Shaw's been plannin' to beat your game for months. He's been waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip you. Who do you think you're talking to, errand boy? Nobody sets me up! Take him back to the baggage room! Put one in his ear! There were four witnesses at that table! Then get that other son of a bitch and dump 'em in the first tunnel. We're gonna be in the station in a couple of minutes! It ain't gonna look too good killing a guy you owe money to. There's better ways of takin' him down. What do you think Shaw would do if he knew I was tellin' you this? Okay. Why the rat? I wanna take over his operation, and I need you to help me break him. - Where's my money? - Shaw's got it. How the hell could I ask him for it back? We're pullin' in. I'm givin' you a lift home. - I was supposed to go with Shaw. - Explain it to him somehow. - But he's expecting me. - I'm givin' you a lift home. You follow? Yeah, sure. Sure thing. What makes you think you can beat him? I've been planning this for two years. I know his organization backwards and forwards... and I need somebody who's respectable but not completely legit. I'm a banker, Kelly. That's legit in this state. All you gotta do is put down a bet for me at Shaw's place. I'll do the rest. I'll supply the money. I'll supply the information. What about the money you come to collect? I'll tell him you paid it. I keep his books. He trusts me. If you help me, I'll pay back the money he stole out of my own pocket. - It's worth that much to you? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Maybe a couple of million. Where do you come from, Kelly? From the east side of New York. A place called Five Points. - But I got out of there. - Out and up, huh? Hey, Floyd? I'm gonna have to keep you away from this guy. You're liable to get ideas. I'll be at Klein's Drug Store... 660 South Marshall at 1:30, if you're interested. If I'm not there by quarter to 2:00, I'm not comin'. Hey, Hooker, how'd it go? Jake. - Everything go okay? - Yeah, sure. Hell, easy. - No sign of trouble, huh? - No. - What about Lonnegan? - I gave him the breakdown like you said. - And? - He's good. He threatened to kill me. Hell, kid, if they don't do that, you know you're not gettin' to 'em. Hello, Doyle. All right, Riley, what the hell happened? We missed him. Whoever he is, he made a fool out of you. There was no way he could've known we was in that room. Somebody must've wised him up. What does Cole say about that? I don't know. He took it hard. Get out of here, Riley. Put Salino onto it. Salino? Why waste our best people on a small-time job? This is a nickel-and-dime grifter we're after, Doyle. - They'll get him next time. - They had their chance. All they did was shoot up a neighborhood, wake up a few cops. I told you to put Salino onto it. It may take a little more time, but there won't be any holes. Tell Cole I wanna see him when he comes in. He won't be comin' in; not to get bounced off a job anyway. This is Salino's job, Vince. Cole wants to muscle in, that's his business. But he's breakin' the rules and Salino won't like it. Now, get me the books. Those odds on the third race are wrong. Just a minute. I'll get 'em. Don't worry so much. You're gonna be all right. Just stay to the back the first time around. Put a little of this on your nose. Kelly? You should always look to the back, kid. I was afraid you wasn't gonna show. We haven't got much time. Get on with it, then. Sometime after 2:00... a guy's gonna call on that phone and give you the name of a horse. All you gotta do is take this two grand across the street... to Shaw's place, and bet it on that pony. Don't take too much time. We've only got four minutes after you get the call. You'll not break him with a $2,000 bet. This is just a test. The big one comes later. Be careful with that. That's all I got. You were gonna pay me back out of your own pocket? I am. After the race. I gotta get back before Shaw misses me. Good luck. Yeah? Go ahead. The horse is Blue Note to win. - Fourth race at Narragansett. - Got it. Yeah? Blue Note to win in the fourth race at Narragansett. Turning for home, it's Lady Scout by a length. Speed Queen a half, Lady Trust and Miss Petrina. Into the stretch, it's Lady Scout ahead, Speed Queen a half. And at the wire, it's Speed Queen the winner! Lady Scout placed and Miss Petrina showed. Post numbers two, five and one. Taking off at 23. Look at that. He's got his apes with him. Yeah, we're gonna have to do something about that. Bubblesome is 10, Beefsteak, 7... Vote Boy, 6, Kerry Patch, 12. Blue Note is 7 to 1. This is your last call for the third race at Lincoln Fields. They're going to the post. - You may still wager if you hurry. - There he goes. At Detroit, the winner, Speed Queen, paid $7.20... 4.60 and 3.40. Lady Scout, $7 and 4.20. Miss Petrina paid four dollars. Last flash at Narragansett. Lady Higloss, 6 to 5. I'd think you'd get tired of losing, Harrigan. Thank you, Mr. Williams. Blue Note, $2,000 to win. Fourth race, Narragansett. Make sure you see the cash, Eddie. He's got a name for bettin' money he doesn't have. We'll give you the results on that one in a minute. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe... your caller for the fourth race. The mile and one-sixteenth handicap at Narragansett Park, Rhode Island. Thirteen thousand dollars added for three-year-olds and up. The flag is up, and they're off and running. It's Bubblesome going to the front, followed by Lady Higloss... Vote Boy, Chancing, Beefsteak, Kerry Patch... and Blue Note trails the field. Around the clubhouse turn, it's Bubblesome ahead... Chancing a half, Lady Higloss by one... followed by Vote Boy, Beefsteak, Kerry Patch and Blue Note. Into the second turn, it's Chancing by a length. Lady Higloss driving on the rail and Vote Boy... followed by Bubblesome, Beefsteak, Kerry Patch and Blue Note. Come on, Chancing! Lady Higloss a half, Vote Boy by one. Lady Higloss is a hell of a finisher. Chancing's gonna have to open up. Know anything about a horse named Blue Note? He never done much. Probably in there just to round out the field. Chancing's where you want to have your money. Great tip you handed me, kid. - Just give him time. - Chancing by one. And here comes Blue Note driving on the outside! - Nice work, Erie. He loves ya. - He's third! Chancing is shortening stride, and now it's Lady Higloss and Blue Note. They're head to head. They're neck and neck. It's Lady Higloss, Blue Note; Lady Higloss, Blue Note. And Blue Note wins it by a nose! Lady Higloss is second by three, and Chancing is third by one. Who in the blazes is Blue Note? The winner, Blue Note, paid $16, 9.40 and $6. So you want to have your money on Chancing, huh? Chancing paid 3.80. Time for the mile and 1/16th: 1:44 and 1. They're going to the gate at Belmont. And here are the late odds. Those garbage men belong to you? Get 'em out of here and don't bring 'em back. This is a class joint. - Hey, you, Kelly! - Yes, sir? Run those bums out of here. - Mr. Shaw, could l... - Don't give me any of your lip, kid. Now, run 'em out of here. Time for the three-quarter mile: 1:11 and 4. The winner, Panic Relief, paid 12.40, 8.20 and $5. Barbara A., 6.20 and 4. Wilder paid four dollars. They're at the post at Belmont at 38. We're waiting on one. I'll call Belmont next. That's it, fellas! - I wanna repeat that... - All right, J. J. What do you say, pal? Yeah? He's on his way. Hi, Mutt. Say, Jeff. What'd I tell you? - You got lucky once. That's not enough. Ah, lucky, hell. I can do it every time. - Why don't you then? - It's better to do it all at once. We're gonna put down 400 grand next week. At five-to-one odds, that's two million. - Twenty percent is yours. - Got a system, Kelly? No. You can still lose with a system. You're past-posting, aren't you? Could be. - How? - You're gonna stay in? Not 'til I get some answers. I got a partner downtown. He runs the central office of the Western Union. Race results from all over the country... come in and go across his desk to the bookies. All he does is hold 'em up 'til he can call us, get a bet down on the winner. Then he releases the results to the bookies. We clean up on a race that's already been run. You can't miss. Unless the Western Union dicks get a hold of it. You got the 400 grand yet? No, not yet, but... - There's only a grand here. - Make another bet tomorrow. Where's my money? - I got 16 grand coming. - You owe me 15 grand already. If your setup's as good as you say it is, there's plenty more to come. I decide when to place the bets! Not if you want me to keep making 'em. I gotta talk to my partner. We can't afford to expose too much. - I'll talk to him myself. - No! You've been waiting a long time for this. Don't ruin it for yourself. I'll pick you up tomorrow at 3:00. You follow? Twist, I told him the tale, but he didn't go for it. He wants to see my partner tomorrow at 3:00. - Yeah. We can't get a telegraph store set up. Any chance of talking him out of it? None. I would've stalled him, but I didn't have many friends in the room. Yeah. All right, we'll have to play him on the fly. I'll get Eddie looking for a place. - Let me know when you got something. - Sure thing, tootsie. All right, Hooker! Stop him! Hooker! Hooker! I'll get you, you rat! Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before? - I thought I'd lost him. - You found him again. We're gonna have to do something about it. - What else haven't you been telling me? - Nothin'. That's all. Hold still. Why'd you move out of your room? It was too noisy. You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker. You know how easy it would be for Lonnegan's guys to get you? All we need is a couple of days... and we can get the son of a bitch and nail him. You just won't learn, will ya? I come in here, teach you stuff that maybe five guys in the world know. Stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it. - All you wanna do is run down a bullet. I'm askin' a couple of days. I can stay clear that long! Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me. - Hey. - Hi. What'll you have? Give me the blue plate special. One blue plate special. - You're done? - Yeah. - Guess I should've had the meat loaf. It isn't any better. - Hey, where's June? - She quit. I'm fillin' in for her a couple of days... until I can get a train out of here. Yeah? Where are you going? I don't know. Depends on what train I get on. - Keep it. - Thanks. Let's go. Excuse me, ma'am, but we're looking for Mr... - Harmon. - Mr. Harmon's office. - Mr. Harmon? - Yeah. Got a work order for a painting job. - For Mr. Harmon's office? - That's right, ma'am. Well, hold on. Just a second. Hiya. - Where to? - 110 South Wabash. 110 South Wabash. Get going. What happened to your face? Ah, got into a fight with a raggle down on 13th. Cut me with her ring. You oughta lay off the skirts. You don't find any of my boys messin' around with that kind of trash. Brigham signed it, all right. I can't understand why he didn't tell me. Ah, he's like all them supervisors. They think they're too good for regular people. He says he was in here a while ago and the place was a mess. We'll hurry so we don't keep you out too long. Why can't I work with you in here? We gotta cover the floor, the furniture, everything so we don't spill on nothin'. If you want to sit in here with a tarp over your head, you're welcome to it. - How long will you be? - An hour or two at the most. It's a small job. We'll go in the side door here. Hiya, Les. Les, this is Doyle Lonnegan. - Mr. Lonnegan, this is Les Harmon. - How do you do? What did you bring him here for? I thought it would be a good idea for him to see the operation. I'm having the place painted. We can't talk in here now. We'll have to find someplace else. Excuse me, Mr. Lonnegan. Miss Barnes, I'm going home a little early. If there are any calls... tell them they can reach me here tomorrow morning. Mr. Lonnegan? I wanna see it one more time. I can't do it. We got telegraph inspectors all over the place. One more time isn't gonna make much difference. We got 400 grand coming in from the coast next week. You gonna risk that on a lousy 15 G's? If it works again tomorrow, I'll finance the whole thing. Half a million dollars. Sixty-forty, we split. What are you talking... We've already got a guy. He's gonna give us half. - What am I supposed to say to him? - Say to him what you want. What I know about your operation, if I were you... I'd be worried about making me happy. Your guy says a week. How do we know it won't be a month? Lonnegan here's a banker. He can get the money without any questions asked. We can't keep goin' into Shaw's place and cleanin' up on long shots. - He's bound to get wise. - All right. We'll go for short odds. You follow? Are you Lieutenant William Snyder? I don't know. What's up? F. B. I. Special Agent Polk would like a few words with you. You got a couple of minutes? Yeah, sure. No, no, no. It's got to be south of the river. Probably this section in here. 31st, 39th, Morgan and Halstead. Now, that's this section here. Now, let's break it into two sections along 35th. What the hell is this? I got work to do. Sit down and shut up, will ya? Try not to live up to all my expectations. Take two men with you. Work your way south from 31st to 35th, Morgan and Halstead. Go into every place and let me know what you find. We've been told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker. - You know him, or don't you? - Yeah, but I don't know where he is. Well, we do. He's chumming around with a big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells? Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff. Well, there's word he's gonna run a con on the South Side here. We've got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef. He can beat it in court unless we catch him cold. All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us. Why don't you pick him up yourself? If word gets out the feds are in on it, Gondorff will fold up the whole thing. Wouldn't that be too bad? Then you'd have to move out of this nice office you've got here. Don't crack wise with me, flatfoot. I spent too much time in dumps like this eating Gondorff's dust... while you guys in the bunco squads get rich tipping him off! That's not gonna happen this time. We're not gonna tell the police we're here. You keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be reward bucks in it for you. And you better take it, 'cause I can make you work for us without it. What the hell good is Hooker to you? He's gonna set up Gondorff for us. - He'll never do it. - I think he will. He's there. Let's get on it. What's the line on Exponent? Five to one. - How's it going? - Nothing yet. I had a good one on the lead at Lincoln Fields, but he faded. Best we had the last hour was Love Potion at Rockingham... and she was 5 to 1. All the long shots coming in today. Take 4 to 1 if you have to. Okay. You can forget the boodle, Eddie. He could hit us for 15 grand at 4 to 1. We can't handle that. - Give him the shutout. - Okay. Okay, Billie, here we go. At the wire, it's Wrecking Crew, the winner by five. Black Mischief, second; Whichaway, third. Wrecking Crew was... 3 to 1. That's our boy. Henry? Here we go, Henry. We got a 3 to 1 at Belmont... Wrecking Crew. Yeah? All right. Okay. - Yeah? - In the sixth race at Belmont. Wrecking Crew to win; Black Mischief to place; Whichaway to show. Wait here. The winner, Time To Go, paid seven dollars... 5.40 and 3.80. Joy Flag, $6 and 4.20. Readily paid 3.80 to show. The weather's threatening, but the track is fast there in Salem, New Hampshire. Here's a late jockey change there in the fifth at Rockingham. R. C. Stark will ride Itsie-Bitsie. - Thank you, sir. - That's R. C. Stark. Five thousand on Black Mischief, across the board. Sixth at Belmont. Would you hurry up there, please? Wrecking Crew is 3 to 1; Vale Of Tears, four; Black Mischief, five; Whichaway, six; Chief Yeoman, 12; Peerless Pal is 20; and Mariato is, uh, 40. And here we go for the sixth at Belmont. It's five and a half furlongs. They're at the post. - Now. - The flag is up. - And they're off! - Sixth race, Belmont, 15,000. Excuse me, sir. We can't take any bets once the race is started. You can bet on another race if you care to. Going into the backstretch, it's Wrecking Crew by two. Whichaway a half, Black Mischief and Vale Of Tears driving on the outside. - Nothin', thank you. - What happened? I didn't get the bet down in time. Jesus! Heading for home, it's Wrecking Crew all alone by six lengths... Whichaway a length, and Vale of Tears. It's Wrecking Crew, Whichaway and Black Mischief. And at the wire, Wrecking Crew wins it by six lengths. Black Mischief is second by a head... Whichaway is third, followed by Vale Of Tears. You should've had your money on Wrecking Crew. It's raining and the track is sloppy at Riverside Park. There's a late scratch there. Transmutate is scratched in the fifth at Riverside. At Belmont, the winner, Wrecking Crew... paid $6, 4.20 and 2.80. Black Mischief, 4.60 and 3.20. I'll have half a million here by post time tomorrow. Lay it on the first race where the odds are 4 to 1 or better. - Make sure I get to the window on time. How am I gonna do that? I don't know. Figure it out for yourself, Kelly. Finished? Yeah. Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee. - Say, what time you get off work here? - 2:00 a. m. - Yeah? Doing anything tonight? - Yeah. Sleepin'. Eighty-five. - You got a back door to this place? - What's wrong with the front? There's a guy out there I don't need to see. Don't look around. - What does he want? - He'd like to kill me. Do me a favor. Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait there. Do what I tell you, and everything will be jake. Please. Thanks. Good night. It's taken. Thanks. See ya. Shit. Salino. Hey, I wasn't... Hey! Gotcha, Hooker! Hey there, Snyder. Long time no see. Get goin'! Chuck... get this off to the department right away. Yes, sir. Hello, Hooker. Take them off. Special Agent Polk, F. B. I. Have a chair. - You want a drink or something? - No. We want to talk to you about Henry Gondorff. Yeah? I don't think I know him. Give yourself a couple of seconds. You wouldn't want to lie to me. Lt. Snyder here says you've done a lot of confidence work in his town. Oh, yeah? Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit. - You ain't got nothin' on me. - Yeah? How about counterfeiting? We've got a tip that Gondorff is gonna run a con on the South Side here. All you've gotta do is tell us when he's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and... you walk out free as a bird. No. You wanna spend the next 20 years in a federal penitentiary... starting tonight? I'll make parole. Like hell. You won't even get a review. I'll chance it. Okay. If that's the way you want it. We might even provide you with a little company on your way up the river. That wife of Luther Coleman's... what was her name? - Alva. - Alva. That's it. Alva Coleman. Pretty fair grifter in her time. Snyder's given us quite a folder on her. Nothing major by itself, but... put 'em all together, it could add up to a lot of years. - You stink, mister. - Don't be a sap. It's not her I want. If you're too dumb to save yourself... there's no sense dragging her down with ya. It's over, Hooker. You can save me a lot of trouble. But I'm gonna get Henry Gondorff whether you help me out or not. - You'll wait till the chump is played? - Hell, yes. We don't care about the mark. He deserves what he gets. I mean completely played. You come in before we beat him, and I'll kill him. All right, Hooker. But you try to take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight. As long as I get to finish the play. What is it, kid? You're not saying much. - Just got the jumps. - Come in. Things are a little slow. I wanna open the round for the girls. Sure. Take it easy, kid. We're not gonna lose him now. We had him ten years ago when he decided to be somebody. Believe me, I've seen enough to know. Ten. - Twenty. - Thirty. - Go. - Thirty-one. How many guys you conned in your life, Henry? I don't know. Two, three hundred. Sometimes we played two a day when I was with O'Shea's mob. Of course, Chicago was a rigged town. The fix was in. The dicks took their end without a beef. We had it down to a business. And it really stunk, kid. No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same thing as bein' a citizen. I got packin' to do. I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow. I wouldn't ask you to do this, you know, if it weren't for Luther. Nothin's gonna make up for Luther. Revenge is for suckers. I've been griftin' 30 years. I never got any. Then why're you doin' it? It seems worthwhile, doesn't it? See ya. Looks like he missed you. Yeah, yeah. This time, anyway. Good night, Mrs. Hillard. I was wonderin' if you might want to come out for a while... maybe have a drink or something. You move right along, don't you? Hey, I don't mean nothin' by it. I just don't know many regular girls, is all. And you expect me to come out just like that? If I expected somethin', I wouldn't still be standin' here in the hall. I don't even know you. You know me. I'm just like you. It's 2:00 in the morning, and I don't know nobody. Come on, Henry. Knock off. You've done everything you can. - Yeah? Polk. - Polk, this is Hooker. - Ready? - Yeah, go ahead. Everything's all set. There'll be a guy or two at the door. Nobody's carrying any heaters, so you shouldn't have any trouble. Okay. See you there. She was gonna kill you, kid. Her name's Loretta Salino. Lonnegan's people set her up in the diner. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on! Come on! She could have killed me last night. Too many people could have seen you go in her room. She was a real professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz mob. Who are you? Gondorff asked me to look after you. Snyder, we just got a tip that Gondorff's mark... is some big New York wheel. As soon as we're inside, you get him out of there fast... before the reporters show up. I don't want any big shots around to mess this up for me. All right, let's go! Let's go, guys! The flag is up, kid. - Anytime, J. J. - I'm workin' on it. We got one, Billie. Here we go. - Yeah? - Place it on Lucky Dan... third race at Riverside Park. 1:11 and 3/5ths seconds. They were off at 21. Last call on the third at Riverside Park. They're at the post. At Havre De Grace, the winner, Light Chatter... paid 5.40, 3.80... and 2.40. - Blacksod... - $500,000 to win. Lucky Dan, third race at Riverside. - Post time for the third race... - You heard me. - is 2:27. - Hold on, sir. - There's a jockey change... - I'll get the manager. in the fourth at Belmont. Jay Stout will ride Flying Cross. See that guy over there? He just bet a half million dollars on Lucky Dan. The winner at Rockingham Park... Enfin, paid 6.10... 4.30 and 2.50. What's your problem? I'm putting half a million dollars on Lucky Dan to win... third race at Riverside. Can't lay that off in time. A bet like that could break us. Not only are you a cheat... you're a gutless cheat as well. - What are the odds? - Four to one. Take all of it. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe... calling the third race at Riverside. This is a claiming race for $1,500 for three-year-olds and up. It's been raining, and the track is muddy. The flag is up, and they're off and running. Dr. Twink is going to the front... followed by Lucky Dan, Ima Dreamer, Orkin... Josie G., Chi Chi and Little Star. Around the clubhouse turn, it's Lucky Dan ahead... Dr. Twink a length, Orkin a half... followed by Ima Dreamer, Josie G., Chi Chi and Little Star. Into the backstretch... it's Lucky Dan a length, Dr. Twink a half... Orkin a head, Ima Dreamer by one. Sorry, I couldn't wait. Everything going all right? You got nothing to worry about. - Dr. Twink a length, Orkin a half. - I put it all on Lucky Dan. Half a million dollars to win. - Into the turn Lucky Dan still a length. - To win? I said place! Place it on Lucky... That horse is gonna run second! Ima Dreamer a half, Dr. Twink a half and Orkin by two, followed by Little Star. It's a driving finish! There's been a mistake. Give me my money back! I tell you there's been a mistake! Give me my goddamn money back! All right, everybody. F. B. I.! Don't anybody try to leave. Stand on your feet, put your hands over your head and move nice and slow. Snyder! Get 'em up against the wall. Make sure they're not carrying anything. Hello, Henry. It's been a long time. But it's over. Okay, kid, you can go. All right, I said hands up. Keep 'em up! Come on. Move 'em back! Put 'em up! Get him out. Get him out! Come on! Gotta get you out of here! - Come on! - But my money's in there! There's a couple of dead guys too. You can't get mixed up in that. You don't understand. There's a half a million dollars in there! He's gone. Okay, Henry, all clear. Can you believe it? We pulled it off. It's a nice con, Hickey. I thought you were the feds myself when you came in. No trouble, Henry. Snyder went for it all the way. You should've seen the rag he lit under Lonnegan! Well, kid, you beat him. You're right, Henry. It's not enough. But it's close. Okay, guys, let's take this place apart fast. You can pick up your splits from Eddie at Boudreau's tonight. Nice goin', J. J. You're not gonna stick around for your share? Nah. I'd only blow it. One, two. One, two, three., Get to it. Jackson! No! Ahh. Roger. You're a wonderful man, yes, and you're a great lawyer. We're just not meant to be together. No, I don't wanna marry you! Are you crazy? The hell's the matter with you? Roger, we're done. Oh, my God. Fuck! God! Hurgh! Fucking men! - Did he cry? - Yeah, he cried. He laughed. He yelled at me. You know, whatever. - You broke his heart, Mama. - I did the right thing. - Ally, garbage! - It just wasn't right... Oh, hey, Bryan. - Can somebody else do it? - Let her shine! It's your fucking turn! - Oh, my God! - Who's he talking to? OK, I'll see you upstairs. Come on, Bryan! She's performing tonight! Here we go. Taking out the trash. Wipe your mouth. You can go early if you finish your job. Well, you gotta keep your mouth clean. OK? Ohh. Where the fuck are we? We are uh...east of the city. - Is there any more? - No. No, sorry, Jack. And it's... It's about an hour, 40, with traffic till we get there. - Really? - Yeah. Think we can find something around here? No, I'll find something. I'll find something. How's your kid? How old is he now? - He is 17. - Fuck me. And he got a scholarship to play baseball in college already, man. - Wow, that's great. - I'm proud of him. My little guy is not so little any more. I don't wanna go home. Wish I could find you a spot. - Sorry, Jack, I don't know this area. - Would you make a right here? - You sure? - Yeah. All right. Here we go. That looks like a fucking bar. - Here? - What's that say? ""Bleu Bleu."" Here, let me just try this. Oh, shit. Wait, wait. - My man, my man, I... Aren't you like... - This is a bar, right? - Yeah, but not your kind of place. - They got alcohol? - Well, yeah, but... - Oh, it's my kind of place. Oh, shit! This is crazy! How are you doin', papo? How am I doin'? All right, if I can get a drink. - You good? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. There's the bar. - This is my home girl Giselle. - How you doin'? - Oh, yeah. That's Jack. Can we get this man anything he wants, please? Can I get a gin on the rocks... Papo, wow. Oh, my gosh. I'm freaking out right now. - Hey, is this a drag bar? - Yeah, papo. Yeah, yeah. But, look, we do this every Friday night. Yo, it's crazy. It's so lit, though. I thought maybe I was in some sort of hallucinogenic state. - Or something. - No, no. All are welcome. A dress or something. Gonna have something? Let me get you a drink. OK. Yeah, um, wow. You better kill 'em tonight. All you ladies, kill it tonight, OK? - I'm ready. - I always do! Make sure you've turned in your music already. Don't make me have to come get you tonight. This is a professional show. Oh, yes! Oh, you stayed! - That's good. I like it. - Everything good? You good? Yeah, I was just talking to Nicki. You know Nicki? - Hello, Nicki. How you doin', baby? - She's telling me her life story. - Fascinating. - My home girl's about to perform. Y'all know her well because she used to work here as a server. But, tonight, the only thing she's serving are some fabulous, French live vocals. Is she really singing, or is it one of those karaoke things? No, she's really singing, papo. I promise you. Watch this. Watch. Would anybody like some French tips tonight? Yes, baby! Yes, baby! Oh, fuck. - Oh, papo, you crying? - A little bit. You have... You have to meet her. - What's that? - You have to meet her! - Oh, no, I can't meet her. - Yes! Come on. Donte, you got a rag, honey? Thank you. Miss Ally, now you sang in French, you gonna pick something else next week? - I don't know. - Look at her, doing languages. - Do Moroccan. - No! - This is my friend, Jackson Maine. - Hey. - This is Jackson Maine. - Hey. How are you? - Hey! Oh, my God! - Right? This is my friend, Ally. - Hi. - Hey. - I thought that might be you. - What'd you say? - I thought that might be you. - That's me. Thank you! Do you wanna sit down? - No! You've been on your feet all night. - No! You're our guest. - You sure you don't mind? - A little drink? - I'm here watching the show - you guys. - Word. - Yeah, yeah. - Sign my boob? - Sure. Yeah, I can do that. - Oh, my God! - Give me a sharpie! - You know, it's BYOB around here. - Yeah? - ""Bring your own boobs."" Oh, God! Oh, those aren't really her boobs? Wow! So, why are you in here, hon? - Sorry? - What brings you here? I was playing right around here tonight. I'm a musician. - How'd your show go? - I think it went all right. - OK, here we go. All right. - Thank you! - That's all right? - Oh, my. - Aahh. - Which one should I do? - Do 'em both! I don't care! - Slut! - Why don't I do it across? - Bitch, Jackson Maine! - I'll just... - Oh, my! Ohh, she will stop at nothing. - You gotta blow on it! - I did it pretty big. Oh. - Oh, you got it. OK. - Thank you so much! You all gotta go home but you know the phrase. You gotta get the hell up outta here! Cos I'm not losing my virginity or my liquor licence over you bitches, so pack up! - That's right! - That's enough cocktails! Clear it out! Hello, goodbye, Roger. Have fun! - Bring the drinks on out! - Do you do that often? - Do what? - The show. Yeah, yeah. The girls are so nice to me here. I mean, they would never normally let a girl sing at one of these shows but they've always loved my voice. They used to beg me to sing. It's an honour, really. I get to be one of the gay girls. Is that your real eyebrow? Um... No. No. I... I make it out of tape. - Oh, so it's, like, stuck on? - Mm-hm. Can I try to take it off? Uh... Yeah, sure. It's incredible what they do. - Look at that. - Yep. There it is. - I should put her down somewhere. - OK. There we go. Why are you covering your eye? Just cos I don't have my eyebrow on any more. Oh, no, no. The whole point is I can see your face. Yeah, there we go. Why did you come back here? Your friend brought me back here. I'm glad he did. Can I buy you a drink? Oh... I... I gotta change, and I've got paint in my hair. - And my eyebrows are... - That's not your real hair? No, my hair's like your colour. - Oh, OK. - But I paint it with this... - ..makeup. - I'd love to see what that looks like. I'll wait for you. Um... Yeah, OK. Sure. Yeah, if you wanna wait, I'll come have a drink with you. Sure. Bitch, can you get down off that stage and come help me close this bar, please? Don't talk to me like that in that bus driver wig, girl. Oh, I know you did not. What, you have a street appointment tonight, sister? Excuse me! Mr Maine, would you mind? Uh... What do you want me to do? Just come play a little song for me. - I don't know. - Can you leave the man alone, please? I showed you mine, you show me yours. Come on. He already signed your tits, honey. Say, ""No, sir."" - Show off for me a little bit. - Only because you already performed. You're so nice. Thank you. Lord, the man is here for Ally. Not for you, sister. - Oh... She's nice. Yeah. - Isn't it cute? Little arts and crafts. - Yeah, and light. - Mm-hm. - Did you do this yourself? - Yeah, all me. Looks great. Does this mic work? Oh, yeah. Fuck, all right. What do you want me to play? I don't care, just look at me while you do it. - Oh, Lord! Somebody kill me now. - Let me see what I can... All right. You're ready? - You know I would! - OK. - It's a cop bar. - Cops? Yeah, that's why they serve all night long. - Can I ask you a personal question? - Oh. Sure. Do you write songs or anything? - I don't sing my own songs. - Thank you. Why? I just... I just don't feel comfortable. Why wouldn't you feel comfortable? Um... Well, cos, like, almost every single person that I've come in contact with in the music industry has told me that my nose is too big and that I won't make it. - Your nose is too big? - Yeah. Your nose is beautiful. - Are you showing me your nose? - Yeah. - I've been looking at it all night. - Oh, come on. I'll be thinking about it for a long time. - You're full of shit. - I'm telling you the truth. - You're full of shit. - Can I touch your nose? - Oh, my gosh! - Let me just touch it for a second. - You're very lucky. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. - Yeah, not really. My nose has not made me lucky. I could've had maybe a hit song if it wasn't for my nose. - That's fucking bullshit. - Yeah. No, it's not bullshit because you go into these rooms and there's all these fucking men in there and they're just staring at you, listening to your record, going, ""Oh, you sound great, but you don't look so great."" You know, I had a thing when I was little... I was born with this thing in my ear. Couldn't hear. What do I wind up being? A singer. So, you never know. Look, talent comes everywhere. Everybody's talented. Bet you fucking everybody in this bar is talented in one thing or another, but having something to say... and the way to say it so people listen to it, that's a whole other bag. And unless you get out there and you try to do it, you'll never know. That's just the truth. If there's one reason we're here, it's to say something so people wanna hear it. - Understand what I'm trying to tell you? - Yeah, I do. I don't like it, but I understand it. Oh, I think you like it a little bit. I think I'm getting through a little bit. I can see it. No, you can't. It's a good thing we met. - Yeah. - For both of us. - Trust me. - I don't know what is going on. - Honestly, what... - Who does? I'm in a cop bar, with Jackson Maine. It's, like... - Jackson Maine! - I'm gonna wake up in a minute. When you get famous, people start saying your full name. - Well, what do you want... - Just ""Jack"". Speaking of... Come on. - What? - Did you put that on? You put that on. When did you even go to the jukebox? Oh, God! I hear that song, and I just wanna turn it the fuck off. - Jack Maine! - I fucked that song up. - No! What? Come on. - Oh, my God! Hey, I know that we're not supposed to do this. I know that we're not supposed to bother you. That's all right. You got your camera? I don't have mine. Excuse me, one sec. - My ex-girlfriend was fucking this guy. - OK. - Who looks like you, she said. - Shut up. But I gotta take a picture of you to send to her to show her that you look nothing like that fucking guy. - Jack, I'm sorry. - Take a picture. Will that help you? Will that make you happy? - OK. Take a picture? - Want someone to take the picture? - No. It's OK. - Excuse me. - Get the fuck off, you little whore. - What? What? - Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah. - What? - I got you. - I'm sorry, Jack! - It's all right. - Oh, my God! Why did I... I'm fine, honestly. I'm OK. This is so stupid. No, you gotta get ahead of the swelling. Just trying to find some... - This is so embarrassing. - ..peas. Here we go. Yeah, put that on there. Gotta wrap something up with it. Find it. - You like Cheetos? - No, like gauze. - Some gauze or something. - Gauze? Try to do that. With that hand. And do that hand. You play piano? - Yeah, we gotta take care of this, then. - Oh, OK. Thanks. And that's it, yeah. Keep that on there. Hold on. Can you do that? Yeah. Did you get it? It's already gotten warm, hasn't it? - Should we have gotten two? - No, it's OK. Thanks. I'm sorry. I... I had to. That's all right. - It's not really all right, though. - Have a good one. Be careful, she'll hit you. These rings are gonna get stuck if you don't take them off. - Does that hurt? - Yeah. That's OK. - May I? - Yeah. Safekeeping. - Put this on there. - You're a sweetheart. And we'll just wrap it up. You'll be good to go. How the hell do you deal with that all the time? - What's that? - People just...talking to you like you're not a real person, or taking your picture. - Is that too tight? - Ah, it's OK, thanks. - Whoo... That hurt you? - That's fine, it's OK. There we go. Now you're mobile. Swing it around. - I look like a pirate. - Right? I told you it was worth coming here. How do you do that? - Do what? - Don't change the subject. - Is that what I'm doing? - Nobody ever asks you about you, huh? - Not sure. - Where are you from? Arizona. - Arizona boy. - Mm-hm. Dad had, like, a midlife crisis, I think. So I've been told. Made his way to Arizona, started working for this family on a pecan ranch. - A pecan ranch? - Yeah. Knocked up the family's daughter. She was just shy of 18. Uh-oh. That's when I came into the picture. - OK. The son of an 18-year-old. - Yeah. Well, she died at childbirth. - Then, my dad... - I'm sorry. He... He died when I was 13, so I guess... my brother would tell you that he raised me, but... ..I don't know. I don't know who was raising who. Just 127 acres of nuts, Navajo, and nowhere to go. Is that me? That's you. - Did you just write that now? - Yeah. It's pretty good. I started writing this song the other day, and... ..maybe that could work, like as a chorus or something. I have to think if I can remember it. Ah... Holy shit. What is this? Was this supposed to help me? Can I tell you a secret? I think you might be a songwriter. But don't worry, I won't tell anybody. But I'm not very good at keeping secrets. You're a real gentleman. I think. Thank you, sir. It's on the right. - Right there? - Which one? - This one. - Oh, yeah. - What's all this? - Oh, it's my dad. It's a long story. What's he, a sheikh? No, he's a driver. Hey, I got a gig. You wanna come? - When? - We're headed to the airport now. - Tonight. - Tonight? No, I can't. I gotta go to work later. I gotta go to bed. Who's gonna take care of your hand? I messed it up. - Me. - No, no! - I'll take care of it. - It's my fault. - That's OK. - No, listen. Hey! - You have my number. - OK. All right. - Hey. - What? I just wanted to take another look at you. Maybe I fucked that up. No. - Hi, Dad. - Pretty late, pretty late. - Oh? Is it late? - Yeah. Look at you. You don't even know where you're walking. - Come on. - Well, I wanna go to bed. No, come in for two minutes. It's Wolfie's birthday. Come on. - Two minutes! - OK. - Wolfie! - Yeah, sweetheart? - Who was the guy in the car? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Hey, Ally. - How's it goin'? - Happy birthday. - ""Happy birthday""? - Yeah. - It's not my birthday. - What do you mean? Come on. - No, I was just saying... What the hell happened in here? My God! - This place is a mess! - ""Starting gate"" is ""shuppatsu geto"", - and ""bad beat"" is ""warui bito"". - What's going on? Leave the butter out? Who the hell's betting on horses at breakfast time in Japan? - It's not breakfast time. - They're loading! - Joe, come on! - You're crazy! Have a sizable investment on this. What did I say about smoking in this house? - Outside! - Who are you? - It's my house. - I know it's your house. - But you smoke too. - All right, forget it. Sweetheart, you're happy here, aren't you? I'm happy, Dad. I'm just saying, she's got no space. - What are you saying? - Sweetheart. - She's got no space. - Wait a minute. I want my friends to look at you. Take a good look. With a voice like from heaven, but you know what? It's not always the best singers that make it. You know? I knew a couple of guys could sing Sinatra under the table. But Frank, he'd come on stage with the blue eyes, the sharkskin suit, the patent leather shoes... he becomes Frank Sinatra. And everybody else, all these other guys... that really got it, that really have it inside... ..just a bunch of nobodies. OK. Everybody, let's go. Time for work. Unfortunately, you keep blasting the hearing... it's not gonna come back. I think it's time we reconsider the in-ear monitors. We talked about that with Bobby a couple of weeks ago. If we put the in-ear molds in, we can use those to amplify the high frequencies. - OK, great. - Cut down the sound. - Yeah. - I'm gonna talk to Bobby - and get something set up. - Sold. I'm sold. - All right, Jack. - Yeah, call Bobby. - Stubborn son of a bitch. - Ready. One, two, three, four. - We're trying... - You gotta put 'em in, man. I told you, I can't wear those. When I wear 'em, it's just in my head, and I need to be here. The doctor said it's the only way to manage this thing, Jack. You're not gonna get back what you lost. It's the only way we can manage what you still got. Oh, wow. Ha! I think we're managing pretty good. What do you want me to do? - The door's wide open if you wanna go. - You know what? Don't start that shit. Show a little fucking pride in what you're doing, buddy. I just wanna know if she's on her way or not, that's all. Who's coming? What the fuck? Who's here? I have no idea. He won't tell me. - Hi, Ally. I'm Phil. - Hi. - We met last night. - Yeah. - Jack sent me to take you to the gig. - Oh, my God. Um... But I gotta work. - I can't go. - He's really looking forward to this. I appreciate that, but... I can't leave, so I'll be in my car right down the street. Tell him, ""Thank you, but no, thank you."" Say it like that. - Wait, Ally. What are you doing? - The fuck is that shit? This is crazy. - This is great. - What the hell's going on? Look, a guy like that invites you to a show... - It could be a great opportunity. - Dad, don't start with me! Listen. Does he know you sing at all? Did he hear anything from you? - I gotta go to work. - It's the opportunity of a lifetime. I don't have the same disease you have. You get around celebrities like they're gonna rub off on you. - What are you talking about? - ""Oh, you know who I drove?"" Like magic, now you're famous. - And you're not. It's not magic, Dad. - Sweetheart. He's a drunk! You know all about drunks. Sweetheart, he's still there. You fucking hit a cop? Yeah, he was being an asshole to Jack, so I fucking popped him in the face. That is so gangster! Then we ended up in a parking lot and he put peas around my hand to fix it. Then he was singing and I was singing. I don't know what's going on. Now he's got his driver following me around. He's been following you from your house to work? - Yes. It's crazy! - You're fucking late. I'm what? I said you're late! Are we doing this? Hey, Bryan, I'm out. - Find somebody else. - Bryan, I'll be back. - Papo, I promise. - See ya. I won't. - Did you see Bryan's face? - Hey, great! Let's do this. Let's go. What are we doing? You know, if I didn't know Jack... I would call you a stalker. Yeah, sorry about that. Yes, man! Lay on that couch right now! I'm gonna take my shoes off. - Oh, my God! - This is nice. How this shit works? - They just told you no. - Oh, OK. I'm so sorry. Oh, shit! I could get used to this shit. You need to date more rock stars, baby girl, you know? We're not dating. Hi, Ally. I'm Gail. - Hi. - Hi. Leave your bags. We'll grab 'em in a sec. - Ready? - OK, sure. - OK. Yeah. - Thanks. - Did you have a good trip? - Yeah. Passes. - Thank you. - Put 'em around your necks. Ear plugs. You'll need these. It's loud up there. Yeah, I got 'em. We're coming in. I'll bring you guys to the side stage. Guys, guys, guys. This way. Wrong way. - Sorry. This place is so big. I'm just... - Come on, this way. Oh, watch yourself. You guys good? Hey, boys. He's so excited that you're here. Thank you very much. That was great. There's a friend of mine who came a long way to be here and she wrote a great song, and I'd like her to sing it. I think it's pretty fucking good. - How are you? - I'm good. Hi! - It's so good to see you. - How are you? - You were so good. - The trip was fine? - Yeah. - Phil didn't bother you? Gail was so nice. So, listen, we're gonna sing that song, all right? I did an arrangement - kind of not so great - - but stick with it. - No, I can't. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, you're coming. Please. It's not funny. Jack, don't fuck around. All you gotta do is trust me. That's all you gotta do. I'm gonna sing it either way, so... - Steve... - ""Trust me."" OK. - You have to go sing. - I'm not going out there, no. - Oh, my God! There's so many people. - Pretty fucking good, man. Pretty fucking good. The way the guitar started... I thought maybe I set it in the wrong key, and the tempo was too fast. - No, it was so beautiful, and... - I wasn't sure... - Ally, you OK? - Jack? Jack? You. You, move! - Isn't that the girl who sang? - Good concert, man! - Thank you, yeah. - Love you, man. - Thank you. - Hey, Jack. Killed it. - Really? - Yeah. Hi! Oh, my God! Where's my key? I don't fucking... Ah! Ha-ha-ha. Oh, fuck! I'll be right back. OK? Just give me one second. Is this the bathroom? Where's the fucking... OK. Hey. Jack? I don't know, wake him up. - I can't wake him up. He's drunk. - Yes, you can! Shake your titties in his face or some shit, and just fucking... Know what I'm saying? Take two shots. Thank you so much for your help. You are so helpful. Let me know how it goes, baby. Come on, pal. He's out. You think maybe he drinks a bit much? Sweetie, you have no idea. Tell you one thing, though. He's never brought a girl on stage before. And it's been a long, long time since he played like that. Well, that's good to know. One time, my brother came home, I was playing on this upright we used to always have in our den. And I was, like, in my own world. No-one was ever home, and then he comes home to take care of my dad, who was sick. And he's sittin' there, and he's looking at me. I swear to God, he looked at me like I was special or something, and it just kind of filled me up. I should've never told you that. I don't know. Why? - Cos it's embarrassing. - It's so sweet. Cos you're nothing like my brother, let me just say. - Yeah, I don't look like your brother? - He's a fucking old man, OK. My dad had me when he was 63 years old. 63 years old? - And we have different mothers, so... - Huh. What's that number down here? That is how many people looked at it. Get the fuck out of here. How do they know how many people looked at it? I think it's... They call it an algorithm, or... What's an algorithm? It's like a beat. - A beat? - Yeah. Yeah. - Like in music, a beat? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think, I don't know. - Do you believe this? - No. - Wow. - And you see this? - Yeah. - That's how many people have watched. - Yeah, we're just telling... - They was telling him. - How the fuck do they do that? - I've watched it 200 times myself. - I'm 200 of those people. - Go, Pops. Oh, jeez! My God, you're so fast! Jack! French toast is gonna come out. First one to hit the bed. - Beautiful. You wrote this with him? - He's so talented. - Can I watch it again? - Yeah, it's good. One more time. - I'll be up all night watching this. - Or 500. Come on! Christ! Oh, my God. How did you get in here? Your dad let me in. What? I don't feel this way about everybody. Well, good. Then we're on the same page. You come and sing with me. Where? Well, first stop's Arizona. I'm never getting on that thing with you when you've been drinking. I haven't even thought about drinking or anything else. We'll see how long that lasts. Go wait downstairs. Actually, when I was in my 20's and 30's, I was like a crooner. As a matter of fact, a lot of people thought I was... better than Sinatra. Frank Sinatra? What are you writing down in here? That's my songbook. I usually use a typewriter, but... I had this idea on the bike... and I didn't wanna forget it. How do you hear it? Aren't you excited to be home and play for all your Arizonian fans? I don't really come back here. - You avoid your home? - I don't know. It's like the hot air and... ..the history, I don't know. Bought the ranch, though, I grew up on. Gave it to my brother. We buried Dad there, and so I wanted to make sure that nobody... paved over his grave or... - any of that kind of shit. - Is it around here? It's not far. Why don't we just go there? It's nearby. Mm. Mm. Mm. Jack? Yeah, if he shows up! These guys have been vamping out there for a fucking half an hour. It's time to fucking get on. Don't you get tired of being... You sold Dad's ranch! They turned it into a fucking wind farm! I bought that for you. Where's his grave? He washed away in a fucking storm. His grave isn't there any more. I told you, but you were fucking drunk. You were fucking loaded... and already pissing yourself a swan song. Fuck if you shed a tear for that piece of shit you idolise for no goddamn fucking reason. All Dad ever did for you... ..was make you his fucking drinking buddy. And you'd be right there with him if he was still alive and you fucking know it. What did you think... that I was gonna fucking take care of it... ..while I'm fucking cradling your ass all over the goddamn world? Yeah. That's a good excuse. Raising a little brother so you don't have to deal with the fact that you were no fucking good. If I was no good, why'd you steal my fucking voice? - Huh? - Cos you had nothing to fucking say. You were too proud to sing any of the songs I ever wrote. Well, I got something to say now, pal. I'm done being your fucking errand boy. I quit. Yeah, my voice just got up on me a few months ago and... ..another shot of steroids is better safe than sorry. Thank you for that. We should be good. Hey. - You OK? - Yeah. Well, let's play. All right, I got an idea for the end. - Sorry... - That's OK. - It's gonna be a little different... - Cheers. Where's that joint? We're gonna be a little different for the end, OK? - Do the encore and the thing that I said. - OK. All right? Come on, let's go back out and do it. - What are you doing? - Go, go, go. All right, listen to me. Here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna do the song that I said I wanted you to do. - The one that I love. - No. I'm not. - Please! - Do the one that I love. It'll be great. - Jack, please... - I said I always... - You promised to do it. I love you. - I always say... Always remember us this way. Everybody, we're gonna bring out Ally to bring us home... and she's gonna sing an original song. Thank you. Ally! Ally! Ally! Ally! That was fucking beautiful. No, you were fucking doing it. I was there, I fucking... - Our car's over there. - Ally, that was unbelievable. - Thank you. - That was unbelievable what you did. Thank you. I don't know if you know about me, about where I've come from. I'm Rez Gavron. I know who you are. What you have right now goes way beyond just this. There's people who need to hear what you have to say musically. This is not normal stuff. It's really amazing what you're doing. I think you have it all. I do. And the question to you is, ""What do you want?"" I'm in that position, to put you wherever you want to be. I... I don't... I don't have... I gotta talk to Jack. He said that he thought Interscope Records might really wanna sign me. And he said that he has this wonderful studio with a beautiful live room and these amazing producers he wants to bring in to record my songs. And he loves Look What I've Found. Remember the song we did in the diner? - Remember, when we were driving? - Yeah. Yeah? I mean, it was so nice talking to him, and he really believes in me. - You all right, Jack? - He's OK. He's fine. He does this all the time. Hey, Jack. Thanks. What's going on? Hm? What are you doing? Oh. You jealous fuck. I'm so happy for you. Oh, you are? Oh... Jackson! Oh, my God! Jack. Stop! Why are you so jealous, boy? Hm? What are you doing? What's wrong? You upset? You want me to make you less... I know, do you wanna play? OK, let's play. What the hell is this? - I'm so sorry. - No, you're fine. - You sound great, OK? - You're doing great. We'll do it again. I'm gonna cue you in. One second. Listen to my cue. We'll come right in, OK? So, should... Well... I'm sorry, but will I sing in the beginning? You're gonna hear the second line, and then I wanna start recording. I think I got an idea that might help out, all right? - Please. Be my guest. - That was really good up to that point. - I'm gonna go in there for a second. - All right, Jack. - I've never sang with a track before. - I think you need your piano. - If you're playing it and singing it... - Yeah, I always play it on the piano. I'm gonna have them fly one in, and we'll try it there - and see where it goes. - You think that's OK? - OK. Thank you. - I got you. You're doing great. - You OK? - No, I'm so nervous. - You look so beautiful. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh, so you guys have already met the new girl, have you? - Rez! What's the plan? - What's up? Thanks for doing this, man. I appreciate it. This is pop music, kids. We have a battle to do, OK? You are the troops, so if I call you ""troops"", just know that we're going into battle. What is my lyrics, Ally? This is just fine-tuning and creating an image. I know. I just don't wanna lose the part of me that's...talented. I'm not gonna let you lose that piece. I'm not gonna let you lose that piece. OK. What are we gonna do with you? What are we gonna do with... Oh, he's beautiful! - ""You can't send me back. I'm too cute."" - Hey, he's got your eyelashes. He does. He's got your eyelashes. Hey, bud! This has never been done before, just so you know. It actually has been done before. Would you please... Please. Do it for me. No, I can't in the water. Mm. You comin' with me to Memphis? - What are you talkin' about? - I gotta go do this... You know, it's one of those paid things. Soul-crushing work, really, but it's kind of never what I thought I'd wind up doing, maybe. I don't know, but... I've made peace with it, though. Anyway, if you wanna come, I thought... we could have a laugh, at the very least. Rez wants to keep me here because, you know, they rushed out the single and they were so excited that they want me to finish the album. - So I'm working on that. - Listen to what you're saying. Listen to what you just said. People wanna hear what you have to say. That's the stuff. - I... I can't... - Hey, hey. Take it in. Thank you, by the way. - Thank you for what? - Giving me a home. This place never felt like one before. Oh, fuck. Jack, you OK? Jack? Is there a reason why you're not up there? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my... Oh, my... Hey! - Pretty incredible. - Did Jack show up? - I haven't heard from him. - What do you mean? - I haven't heard from him. - I can't find him. I called him three times. What happened with the dancers there? I just thought that I should do it alone cos it's so overwhelming. OK, but you can't go rogue on me. You have to understand that this is what I do and you have to trust me, OK? So, if I give you a couple of dancers, don't not use them and then miss a couple of steps, OK? We also have to change your hair. We have to change the colour of your hair. What's wrong with my hair? - I'm thinking platinum, or... - I don't wanna be fucking blonde. I am who I am, and I'm worried about Jack. I will find Jack, OK? I will find him. Jack. I feel like we've done this before. Didn't think we'd do it so soon, man. Come on, bro. Get up. All right. There we go. In my mind, I made it to the door. I almost didn't wake you. You looked so comfortable. - How you doin'? - I've seen better days, I guess. I apologise for... - disrespecting your property... - Not necessary. - ..or whatever I did. - You want some coffee? Put some on, and we'll come in in a minute. OK. That's him, right? That's your boy. Jack, he's as old now... ..as you were when I met you. Saw you on YouTube. - That video with the girl. - Yeah. It made me happy, man. You looked like you. You were just... just doing it, bro. She writes too. - She wrote that tune? - Yeah. Bunch of others too. Got hooked up with some manager guy, wants to... You know. - She's good, bro. - I know. Maybe she's a way out. Ain't nothing to be afraid of, bro. You know, it's like... I don't know... You... You float out... ..float out at sea, and then...one day, you find a port, say, ""I'm gonna stay here for a few days."" A few days becomes a few years. And then you forgot where you were goin' in the first place. And then you realise you don't really give a shit about where you was going, cos you like where you're at. That's how it is for me. I like where I'm at. I didn't even realise I liked it so much... ..till I saw your ass sleeping in the grass this morning. Yeah, come on, man. You can rest in my daughter's room, bro. I thought of, like, a million things to say to you on the plane... and I can't remember. Jack... Glad you're here. You make it to Memphis after all.did  Fuck. I won't do this again. I won't come and find you. Next time, you can clean up your own mess. You understand me? How was the show? It was fucking awesome. I cut the dancers. - Dancers? - Yeah. Ah. Good. Fucking dancers. All you do is need to sing. - You made me so upset. - I'm sorry. I saw that video on YouTube. - Oh. - It was great. Thank you so much. Excuse me one second. - What's going on? - Do you have, like, a plier? Jack's OK? I wanna cut the guitar strings, not too crazy. There used to be pliers or something like that. Ah... Yeah, yeah. I don't know where my mom is. - Yeah. I understand that. - I think you're pretty. Me? You think I'm pretty? Thank you. I think you're pretty. It was real great, and then Jack tells me you wrote the song. Yeah, he got me to start singing my own songs again. - He has a way of doing that. - Yeah, he does. Does anyone want some more mac and cheese? Yeah? Here, sweetheart, you want some? Ah. There he goes. What's up, man? I understand what you said. What the hell are you... Are you kidding? - That stupid? - No. - It's not stupid. - It wasn't a stupid thing I just did? Is that what you were doing when you left the table? He told me he was looking for some pliers. I didn't know what he was gonna do. I didn't think he was gonna ""do it"" do it. Oh, she has another ring! Well, that's just temporary. No, no, no, no, no. Jack, wait a minute. Let's anoint this. Let's do it today. - Yo, for real. - It's a good idea! No, you get the dress. I'll call my cousin right now. It's Saturday. Nobody's gonna be in there. - Let's go. - You really wanna do that? That place has a magical quality to it. It what? It has a magical quality? - It does. - What do you mean? - That church is special. - We can go. - I'll take you to get a dress. - There you go, right there. It'd be great! OK, you're coming with us for sure because you're... I can't believe this. What am I doing? OK, sure. - My brother. Good to see you. - Hey, hey! - Jack! - Good to see you, my man. - Thank you so much. - Welcome to the Lord's house. With the power... I think that's how it goes. Do you take him... Do you take him? I do. I do. Congrats, man. - I listened to what you said. - I'm glad you did. I can't believe he did it. - One thing at a time, OK? - What? Oh! I didn't understand. - Lot of people downstairs? - Yeah. - She better come out before they leave. - Want me to check on her? Well, I think we're gonna have to go pretty soon, so... All right. Ally. I'm coming in. What are you doin' in the tub? This is so weird. I don't know who the hell I think I am. I... One song is fine, but... ..to put out a whole record, I don't know what the fuck I was thinking. I don't know about all of that, but you definitely look like a star. - Really? - Yeah. What do you think of her hair and the look and the...? - I discussed it with her. - Yeah. - It looks great. - Was that your choice? No, it was actually hers. - No drink? - What's that? No drink? No socks? Touch. Touch, mate. Yeah, I could never get used to that, the idea of not wearing socks. - Your feet get all... - No, actually I am wearing socks. They're these kind of little female insert socks - that work with these shoes. - Oh, you are. You're hiding them. Yeah, I'm just hiding them. That's right. OK, now is this thing... Yeah, there it is. Oh, that's a good light. Here, hold this for me, baby. Hey, Ally, girl! Wait, hold on. Come on. Sookie, Donte. Come here. I put my Jackson titties on! Hi! Baby, listen, we just wanted to say congratulations. - Congratulations! - We love you! - I love you too. - Girl, please come back soon. We done put Etta in your station, girl. - The queen is here! - Stop! - Wow! - What do you think? Well, it's beautiful. You. SNL. Alec Baldwin hosting. - Did you get it? - Season finale. - No fucking way. - No, got it.you  - No way! Oh, my God! - No, got it.you  Oh, gosh! - That's incredible! Thank you. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Bitch! - Oh, my gosh! - Get downstairs. - Everyone's waiting. - OK. Can I just talk to her for one second outside? Just one sec, sorry. Just be a second, yeah. It doesn't do you any justice, I'll tell you that. You always said you liked my nose. - I love your nose. - It's real big up there. I wish it was bigger up there. The whole thing should just be your fucking nose. Fuck all those people who ever said anything. Just put a billboard of your fucking nose up there. Just the nose? That's so ridiculous. Listen, if I just don't say this, I'll never forgive myself. What? If you don't dig deep in your fucking soul... ..you won't have legs. I'm just telling you that. You don't tell the truth out there, you're fucked. All you got is you, and what you wanna say to people. They are listening now. They're not gonna be listening forever. Trust me. So you gotta grab it. And you don't apologise, you don't worry about why they're listening or how long they're gonna be listening, you just tell 'em what you wanna say. Cos how you say it is the stuff of angels. Pop! Six to the right, and hah! Ball, change. Down. Hah! Ball, change. - Attitude. - Whoo! - The last part. - I know. All right! 30 seconds. Red mark. Alec in 20. Stand by, guys. Here we go. Ready? Song one. Stand by, Alec. - In ten, nine... - Alec in ten. - eight, seven, six... - Ready 4. Dissolve 4. Alec in five seconds. - Four, three, two, one... - And go 4. Dissolve 4. - And cue Alec! - Ladies and gentlemen, Ally. Dissolve 1. The caterpillar becomes the butterfly. What the hell are you doing here? I'm in town for a gig. Been working for Willie. - I've been working for Willie. - No shit. Yeah. Thought I'd stop by and check her out. Is it gettin' worse? Nah, I've just been with my wife, and it's goin' real good. Funny to run into you, cos... ..I was thinking about asking you to come back out with us. I gotta say, it's easier without you. Listen. You run into any trouble... ..call me. Thank you! That light's beautiful. Oh, God, here we... Yeah, that's it, Ally. Yeah, that's it. That's it, Ally. That's it, I love that. Oh, my gosh. It's so early. I've been here all night. - Early for me, late for you. - Hi, it's nice to see you. - How you doin'? - I'm kind of... - He's amazing. - What do you think? These fucking photos. - They're so beautiful. - Look at that! Look at that! - That's incredible. - It doesn't even look like me. You've just been nominated for three Grammys. Including Best New Artist. They just announced it now. Everybody! Grammy-nominated artist. Have you been drinking? Are you fucked up right now? I'm out a couple. It's the morning. Yup. Hey, buddy. You're nominated for three Grammys, and it's fucking great. Thank you. How did you find that out? Bobby told me. He called. He said that... ..they wanna do some Roy Orbison tribute. They want me to sing and shit. - Great. - Some, like, supergroup thing. But the point is, you got nominated, and it's great. I'm just trying to figure it out, that's all. ""Why do you come around me with an ass like that?"" - My lyrics? - ""Why do you walk around in jeans?"" ""Why do you come around with an ass like that?"" Yeah, that's my song. What about my song? I fucking listened to it over and over in the fucking... You're not making any sense. Yeah, just keep drinking. - That'll give you the answer. - Maybe I fucking failed you. - That kills me. I'm sorry. - You what? You failed me? Yeah, you're embarrassing, and it's just... - I'm embarrassing? - I feel bad for you. - Yeah... - I'm not embarrassing! - I have to tell you. - You're embarrassing! You're so embarrassed of your fucking self that you gotta put me down. You're worried that you're ugly, and you're not. So you need to get approval by all these people. - Why can't I just be enough for you? - I don't need approval. I'd like for my boyfriend to love me. For my to love me.husband  Who's your fucking boyfriend? You have a boyfriend? - Yeah, I've got a boyfriend. - That hurts. - I have a boyfriend. - Call me your fucking boyfriend. You're my boyfriend. You're my boyfriend if you don't treat me like your wife. I don't even know what that fucking means. It means clean your shit up. You're fucking messy. - That's what it means. - Well, that's not true. - Oh, it isn't? - Uh-uh. Let's go. You wanna be my drinking buddy? Wanna practise? - I don't think you could handle it. - You don't? Let me see. Know why? Cos you're too worried about what everybody else is thinking. Here we go, Jack. You want me to be your dad? - Be your drinking buddy? - Yeah. Yeah, you couldn't be my dad if you fucking tried. He had more talent in his finger than you have in your whole body. So don't even fucking go there about that, all right? - That's over the fucking line. - Why don't you have another drink and we can just get fucking drunk until we fucking disappear, OK? - Do you got those pills? - You're just fucking ugly, that's all. - I'm what? - You're just fucking ugly. Get the fuck out! Get out! I said, get out! Fine. Good evening. Seven and eight and huh. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, up! Pull it! Six. Come on, feel it. Ooh-huh. Down, up! Hah! Swing it! - That was great. - What are you doin' here? Something fell through, so I was able to come back a few days early. I think I might have said some things... Just...how I acted. You hurt me. You really hurt me. Sorry. You haven't been drinking. What'd you say? I said you haven't been drinking. I can tell. No, I haven't. No. - I have to get back to rehearsal... - Oh, yeah. Can I watch? Yeah, OK. Meet me at home. Or I can wait and drive you home. - Just meet me at home. - OK. What do you mean, they don't want me to sing? They hired this fucking kid at the last minute. They didn't tell me a fucking thing. Look, we've been on that other side before. More than once. Yeah. Truth is, I didn't deliver. Well, it's a good thing I know the... ..how to play the guitar. It's fine, I'll do it. - You're gonna do it? - Sure. Hey, where's the wedges? Can't fucking hear with the... But, yeah, like I said, it's a real, real honour. Yeah. Oh, honour's mine. Yeah, you're great. It'll be fun. - Yeah, hope so. - Yeah. Who coulda been a crooner? Right? You remember what Paul said. Paul Anka told me I had more natural talent... - ..than Sinatra. - ..than Frank. - That's it! Do not... - Direct quote! Know what Paul Anka actually said? - No, what did he say? - He said... ""Would you please pull the car over and let me out over here on the kerb?"" All right, but... Oh, my God! Sweetheart. This is unreal. The Grammys. - Hey, look at everybody. How are you? - Hey, there he is! - Oh, thanks. - How are you? Are you OK? - What's that? - Are you OK? - Are you OK? - Oh. - I'm great. - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm great. They have me going in early, so I gotta go now and then... But I made sure that they tell me where you're sitting so I can go right after. - OK. - I don't wanna miss the award. - OK. - It's right before it. You just got that look on your face. I do? Watch. It's gone. Amazing. Gonna get to see you perform tonight, get to see you sing. Hey, Jack, that's an incredible... collection of vinyl you have in there. Take whatever you want. It's yours. - Take whatever I want? - He just said, ""Take whatever you want."" He's talking to the wrong guys. I thought he was supposed to be singing. Oh, it's over? It's over? - You good? - I'm fine. And the nominees are... - Right here? - Roxy Carlile. Hi. Are you OK? Come on, baby. Sit down, sit down, sit down. - Hi. You OK? - I was trying to go to the men's room - and they rushed me over here. - OK, put your legs inside. - I had to go to the bathroom. - Put your legs inside. They're announcing your fucking category. Keep quiet. - And the winner is... - Yeah... Oh... This is exciting. How great. Ally! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - What happened? - We won! - Is that why everybody's... - Yep, that's right! Where are we going? Just stay right here. Go sit back there. Go sit back there. I'll stay here. Oh, my gosh, thank you! You look beautiful. Thank you! Oh, wow! Oh, my gosh! I can't believe I'm holding one of these. Thank you to Rez Gavron, my manager. - Thank you for believing in me... - Wait, did you win? ..and telling me to get back from behind the piano and onto the stage. Did you just win? Thank you to my...my... to Jack Maine, my husband. - Should I come up there? - I love you so much. I always wanted to be a singer on a big stage and because of him, I am. - We're having a lot of fun tonight. - Yeah. - I... - Shit. Look. - If I haven't thanked you yet, just... - Did you see you're up there? Yeah, I do. I started out singing with this beautiful man and I'll sing with him for life. - Right, baby? - Yeah. I'm so blessed to be in the company of such wonderful musicians. This is a dream come true, and all I can say is... ..believe in yourself and don't give up because there is a spot on that stage for you. - Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. - Good night. Oh, I think I peed... - I think I peed myself. - Turn around. Oh! - I think I... - Baby, baby, can you... - That's a bad come down. - Holy shit! - Take him to the shower. - Follow me, Wolf. Ally, go inside, OK? - It's on the left, Dad. - I got it. - Go inside! - They got him. - They got him! - It's my job! - Don't do this to my daughter! - Hey, hey! What the fuck is wrong with you? Get off! Damn it! Watch his fucking head. Watch! Watch! Bobby'll take you there. You have Bobby's number? No, Jack, you gotta sit up. I don't want you to choke, baby. Sit up! Sorry, I...I might've taken too much. - You all right in there? - I'm fine. He's fine. So, everybody has their journal... and we remember the homework assignment - the three things that I wanted you to write down. - Jack, hey. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. You can't be late, Jack. Understood. Sorry. Good. Where's your journal? - It's in my room. - No, no, no, no. No. Sit down. So, it's all agreed. Nobody's ever late here, right? OK. Good. Anything you wanna tell us? Um... I'm grateful to... ..to be here and... ..trying to hold it together. I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic. Jack. Drug addict. Oh... - This is all my fault. - You don't have that kind of power, Dad. Eat your dinner. Eat your food. Sorry. I don't even know what meal it is. Go on, have some fruit. How many times did you carry my piano up the stairs? How many times did you sit there while I wrote a song? - Always. - OK, it's OK. It's OK. You didn't do anything. It's not your fault. You're just the greatest person in the world. How long have you been here now? Two months. Can it be fixed? Well, you would know that, don't you? Once it's gone, it's gone. - I don't know what you have. - Oh, the tinnitus, they say, once you... - Well, tinnitus can't be fixed. - Right. Well, I just hear that tone, that's all. The tone, yeah. The ringing. - I have hearing aids on, as you... - I know. That's why I asked you. You know, I'm convinced that... ..it happened when I was younger. I used to... My dad had, like, a Victrola, you know, an old record player. My head was just about the size of it when I was a kid, and I used to love to just put my whole head in there. He was big into the blues, so... Cos you gotta figure, it's just me and him all day long. My brother's out there tryin' to make something of himself. So I took one of his belts. I put it around the... ..ceiling fan and... ..tried to do the deed. The whole fucking fan came out of the ceiling. Had a big cut on my fucking forehead. I was more mad about that than it not working. And he didn't even notice. He didn't even fucking notice. - Cos he was drunk? - Yeah. That fucking fan stayed on the floor for about half a year. How old were you then? I was just shy of 13. Oh... You smell good. You smell good, and you look good too. - I've been swimming. - You've been swimming? - Yeah, there's a pool. - I love that you're swimming. - That's a great pool there. - Yeah. How's Charlie? Oh, Charlie's sweet. He just sort of sits by the door like this. Waiting for Daddy. We're both waiting for Daddy. What, three weeks? You gonna come back, right?are  - What do you mean? - You gonna come home when you're done? - Do you not want me to? - No, I want you to. - I'm just wondering if... I just... - Where else would I go? - I don't know. I guess I just thought... - Why... - ..there's Jack... - Wait, wait. - Wait. Why would you say that? - I don't know. I guess... I wondered, without the booze, if you would want to come home. Cos when you met me, you were drinking, and now you're not. I wasn't drunk the whole time we were together. I know, but... But it got bad when we were together. It's OK. I mean, it's fine. I just was wondering, that's all, and whatever you want is OK. Whatever I want? I wanna be with you. - That's why I'm here. - OK. I know, I know. I just want you to be happy. I'm working on that. I need to stick with you. I brought something. I wanna know... ..what this is. ""My Love."" You hiding love songs? No, I wouldn't... I wouldn't say I was hiding it. I just um... I started puttin' it down to paper when we were at home. I don't know, it sort of fell out of me, I guess, and onto this page. And I put it in here, and I thought... I thought maybe you'd find it when... ..when you came back to you, maybe. Well, I found it. Listen. Um... Um... I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK. It's not your fault. I'm sorry I did that. It's OK. It's not your fault. It's a disease. No, but I embarrassed you. - I embarrassed you, and I... - I'm not embarrassed of you. It was so wrong. And then your...then your dad... My father loves you. It's OK. I know, but I... - It's OK. - I know, but I... It's OK. It's OK. I have figured out what I think is the best solution for both of us. Jack should come out on tour with me. We'll start with our duets. I know he's gonna be able - to play by himself. - You realise that's not an option. He's... He's so inside of his art in a way he has never been. - He can hear himself again. - Ally, there is no way that you can take Jack on tour with you. There's no way. Do you understand what I'm saying? If you can't make that happen, then fucking cancel the tour. I don't know what to tell you. I think if we had a better band name, we might've made it. Or maybe it was cos we looked like a father and son duo. Not many of those around. I was not a good look for you, that's for sure. Not my fault I couldn't find a better guitar player in the whole goddamn state. Where in the fuck is it? Right here. Thanks for the ride. Sure thing, Jack. Hey, you know...when I... ..when I said I... you know, when I... ..took your voice, you know. It was you I idolised. It wasn't Dad. Come here. What was that, guy? Hey. Hey. I wanna know how you hear this. That sounded unbelievable, what you were playing. - Thank you. - It's nice to hear it. Thank you, and I had the beautiful backdrop of you and Charlie. I only heard it in my mind for so many weeks, so it's good to hear it... You know. - The words are beautiful. - ..in the real thing. In the real thing. - Well, you want me to do that? - Mm-hm. Oh, God, I don't know. I knew you were gonna ask me. Back from the dead. - Hey, sorry. Were you waiting long? - No, no. Uh... Ally's not home. No, I told her I'd meet her here, if that's OK. Of course, yeah. Here you go. Hey, thanks for taking care of my girl when I was gone. Anything for her. She told me about that European leg. That's a hell of an accomplishment this soon out of the gate. Shit, I remember it was like...ten years before I even went across the pond. It was summer, 2004. Shit, was it? We're not exactly friends here. While you've been away, we've been back here in serious triage, trying to clean up your fucking mess. Barely finding our way through it. You almost single-handedly derailed her whole career. You understand that? She's never gonna say this to you. She loves you too much. Just by staying married to you, she looks like a joke. It's embarrassing. Let's be honest, we both know it's only a matter of time before that's pushed aside again for the real thing. And when that happens... ..I don't want her anywhere near you. Hey. I have some good news. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. I'm not gonna go to Europe. We're gonna cancel the rest of the tour, and I'm just gonna be here all summer. Isn't that great? - What happened? - Nothing happened. The label just loves the record, and it's doing so well and they wanna keep with the momentum and have me make another one. Rez is super psyched, so it'll be great. So tonight's gonna be my last show. Going out with a bang at the Forum. Great. Yeah. Why don't you come with me? We can sing Shallow together. The fans will go crazy to see you. Come on, cowboy. Yeah, why not? OK. Yeah? OK, good. I'll have a car come get you. When I... Once I get there. I'll go meet you there. I'll see you soon, OK? Hey. What? I just wanted to take another look at you. Bye, honey. Bye. Come here, Charlie. Come here. Thank you so much for bringing us all here together. Please look over all of the dancers tonight and the band. And my husband, Jackson. We're so excited for him to be here with us. We got a big night. We're at the Forum, LA. Let's do this. - Is he here? - He's not here. - He's not here? - We have to do Shallow regardless, OK? The guitar's up there. Everything's gonna remain the same. - What? - The guitar's up there. Everything's gonna remain the same. Both verses. - I'm sure it was just a bit much for him. - Please send somebody to the house. - I'm doing it right now. - I have 15 seconds. Give it up for my husband, Jackson! I can stay, if you want. Aargh! Some kid started singing one of his songs in a bar I was in the other night. They're playing his songs everywhere. At first I got angry. I don't know why. I guess I felt like... ..""How can any of these people feel like they knew him?"" Who he really was. But then something changed. And it soothed me. That it wasn't... wasn't all for fucking nothing. The last thing I did was lie to him. Listen to me. It isn't your fault. It just isn't. You know whose fault it was? Jack. That's it. No-one else. Not you, not me. No-one but Jack. I just keep... ..going over and over it, over it in my head. Jack talked about how music is essentially 12 notes between any octave. 12 notes and the octave repeats. It's the same story. Told over and over. Forever. All any artist can offer the world... is how they see those 12 notes. That's it. Hm. He loved how you see them. He just kept saying... ..""I love how she sees them, Bobby."" Hello, I'm Ally Maine. Thank you for being here tonight to honour my husband. He wrote a song for me. I'd like to sing it for him tonight. And, with your help, maybe I can. Thank you. Really. Thank you. Black Eyes, Hey, Curt, you guys gonna have a little bash your last night in town? Moose has been lookin' for you all day. He got worried. Thought you were tryin' to avoid him. What do you got? - Oh, great. - That's $2,000, man. $2,000! Mr.Jennings gave it to me to give to you. He's sorry it's late. It's the first scholarship the Moose Lodge has given out. He says they're all very proud of you back at the lodge. - Why don't you hold it for me? - I don't want it. Take it. It's yours. I'll take it. Listen, your sister calls. I'll talk to you later. - Wait a second. She can wait. - Make it short and sweet, huh? Listen, I don't think I'm gonna be going tomorrow. Come on. What are you talking about? I was thinkin' I could wait a year, go to City for a while. You chicken fink. After all we went through to get accepted? We're gettin' out of this turkey town... and now you wanna crawl back into your cell? You wanna end up like John? You just can't stay 17 forever. - Get that through your head! - I just need some time. I gotta go talk to Laurie. Now take it. Take it! We're leaving in the morning, all right? We're leaving in the morning! We gonna rock and roll ourselves to death, baby! You got the Wolfman Jack Show! Don't with the thing! Will you stop it with the Big Bopper stuff? - Hi,John! - Not too good, huh? Why is it every girl around here is ugly or has a boyfriend? Where is the dazzling beauty I've been searching for all my life? I know what you mean. The pickings are really gettin' slim. The whole strip is shrinkin'. You know, I remember about five years ago... it would take a couple of hours and a tank full of gas... just to make one circuit. It was really somethin'. Hey,John. Someone new in town. Are you gonna go after him? Hey, listen, professor. If he can't find me, then he ain't even worth racin', right? Big shot. Well? Where was I? How you thought high school romances were goofy... and we started dating only because you thought I was cute and funny... but then you suddenly realized... you were in love with me, it was serious You were leadin' up to somethin' kinda big. You make it sound like I'm giving dictation. Well, seriously... what I meant was that... since we do care for each other so much... and since we should really consider ourselves as adults now Could I have a couple of those fries? Where was I? - Consider ourselves adults. - Right, right. I thought, maybe before I leave... we could agree that... seeing other people while I'm away can't possibly hurt, you know? - You mean dating other people? - It would strengthen our relationship. Then we'd know for sure that we're really in love. Not that there's any doubt. I think you're right. I mean, we're not kids anymore... and it's silly to think that when we're 3,000 miles apart... we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out. Laurie, listen. I didn't ask for that back. I know. I just sort of think it's juvenile now. I'll keep it at home. It's less conspicuous there. - You don't wanna wear it? - I didn't say that. I understand, and I'm not upset. I can't expect you to be a monk while you're away. I got a really neat record collection. I even got ""Pledging My Love"" by Johnny Ace. How can you love Nelson when he's going out with Marilyn Gator? - Since he dumped on you-- - He didn't dump on me, you little dip! Oh, hi, Steve. Hey, sis. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - What is it? - Nothing! I've decided to let you take care of my car while I'm away. At least until Christmas. I'm comin' back for a couple of weeks at Christmas. I've got some very simple instructions for you. Here's the keys. First of all, only 30-weight Castrol-R. I've written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove - Are you listening? - Hey, what's wrong? - Are you crying? - I can't believe it! I don't know what to say! I'll love and protect this car until death do us part. This is a super fine machine. This might even be better than Darryl Starbird's superfeck moon It is! It's better than Darryl Starbird's superfeck moonbird. Budda? How'd you like to go to the drive-in movies with me? - You gotta be kidding. - Would I kid about a thing like that? I have a new car. Did she do that to you? Curt, you wanna bomb around? I wanna try out my new wheels. Well, I'd like to, Toad... but I'm gonna go with Steve and Laurie to the hop. - Besides, I'd spoil your luck. - Yeah, right. Tonight, things are gonna be different. Wait a minute. You're goin' to the freshman hop? Come on, man! That place is for kids. You two just got your ass outta there. Don't go back there. You ain't got no emotions? We are going to remember all of the good times. - Yeah, well, go. - Why don'tyou come with us? - Bullshit, man! - Come on. For old times' sake. Listen, you go. Go ahead, Curtsie baby. You go on over there and remember the good times you won't be havin'. I ain't goin' off to some god damn fancy college. I'm stayin' right here-- havin' fun as usual! Jesus, Milner, you're really in a great mood tonight! What's the matter,John? Did I do somethin' wrong? I'm sorry. Man, it's nothin'. - We'll see you later, okay? - All right. We'll all do somethin' together before Steve leaves. Wait a minute. Now you're not goin'? I don't know. - Hey, Milner! - What happened to your fat head? - What happened to your fat head? - Your mother! Your mother! Hey, we been talkin' 'bout you. There's a very wicked '55 Chevy lookin' for you. - Yeah, I know. - Watch out for the cop at Jerry's. Yeah, all right. Thanks. Hey, Toad! Is that you in that beautiful car? Jeez, what a waste of machinery! Hey, kid! All right, baby. Here we go with another call. -Answer the phone, dummy. - Pinkie's Pizza. You got anymore of those secret agent spy scoops? Hit parade on astethoscope? No, secret agent spyscope, man... that pulls in the moon, stars, the planets... and the satellites and little bitty spacemen. You have the wrong number, partner. Wait! What did you say? Quick. Quick. Hang a right. - What? Why? - Steven, cut over to ""G"" Street. I just saw a vision. I saw a goddess. Come on. You gotta catch up to her. - I didn't see anything. - Come on, Curt. We can't be spendin' half the night chasing girls down for you. Laurie, this was the most perfect, dazzling creature I've ever seen! - She's gone. Forget it. - She spoke to me. She spoke to me through the window! I think she said, ""I love you"". That means nothing to you people? You have no romance, no soul? Someone wants me. Someone roaming the streets wants me. Will you turn the corner? - Later. - Alligator. You're new around here. Where you from? - Turlock. - You know a guy named Frank Bartlett? No. Does he go to Turlock High? Well, he used to. He goes to J.C. now. - Do you go to J.C.? - Yeah, sure. Wow! Do you know Guy Phillips? Yeah, sure. I got him in a class. He's so boss! How'd you like to ride around with me for a while? I'm sorry. I can't. I'm going steady. - Come on! - I just can't. You're just ridin' around with a bunch of girls. Anybody else in there wanna go for a ride? You got nothin' to fear. I'm as harmless as a baby kitten. - I'll go! I'll go! -Judy's sister'll go with you, okay? Yeah, sure. Judy, her sister, her mother... Anybody. I'll take 'em all. Listen. We'll go up and stop at that light. It'll turn red by the time we get there. All right? If you ever get tired of going steady with somebody that ain't around... I'm up for grabs. So, you're Judy's little-- Shit! How old are you? I'm old enough. How old are you? - I'm too old for you. - You can't be that old. I think you better go back and sit with your sister. Where are they anyway? Are they comin' back? This is a joke, right? This better be a joke, 'cause I'm not drivin' you around! You asked me. What's the matter? Am I too ugly? Judy doesn't want me with her, and now you don't want me with you. Nobody wants me. Even my mother and father hate me. - Everybody hates me. - They don't hate ya. - You throw me out, I'll scream. - No, no. Stay cool. Everything's all right. We'll find your sister. - Can't be too hard to find. -John, you gonna be there tonight? Shit! Hey, get down. - Is this called ""copping a feel""? - What? No! Get up. Jesus. - What's your name? - My name? Mud, if anybody sees you. - What do you got in there, kid? - More than you can handle. Excuse me. I think we've had an accident. Damn it, I won't report you this time, but next time,just watch it! - Good evening. How are ya? - Yeah, hi. This is really a beautiful car, you know? Of course you know it. You know what I'd like to give you for this car? I'd like to give you $1,000! I can't give you that, but I'm not gonna give you a whole line. I'm gonna tell you what I can give you. Come over here. How would you like, for $525, to own this practically new 'Vette? I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm gonna knock ten percent right off the top. How about that? - That's $98 down. - No, I'm sorry. $98 a month. You ask me how can I do this? I'll tell you how I can do it. My boss wants to get rid of the sporty cars. - You all right? - I'm fine. I don't think it's a good idea. - I'm busy. - I want you to listen. I've gotta go! Leave me alone, for God's sake! One, two, three, four At the hop You can rock it, you can roll it Do the stomp, even stroll it at the hop When there cords start spinnin,you can mix it with the chicken at the hop Do the dance sensation that's sweepin' the nation at the hop Let's go to the hop You can swing, you can groove it, you can really start to move it at the hop Where the jockey is the smoothest And the music is the coolest at the hop All the guys and chicks can get their kicks at the hop Let's go! Why are you so depressed? You'll forget him in a week. After you're elected Senior Queen, you'll have so many boys after your bod. Peggy, the point is, I do not want to go out with any other guys. Laurie, I know it's a drag, but you can't just-- Remember what happened to Evelyn Chelnick? When Mike went into the Marines, she had a nervous breakdown... and was acting so wacky she got run over by a bus. I just wish I could go with him. Laurie,jeez! Come on. Hey, zit makeup! Hey, everybody-- Just cool it, Steve? Let me see some of that stuff. You leavin' tomorrow? - You and Laurie engaged yet? - No, but we got it all worked out. We're still gonna be goin' together, but we can date other people. And screw around. I know. Hey, I hear college girls really put out. When I saw her standing there I had to pick her up I couldn't fail 'Cause I knew I had to make her mine She's so cool She's so fine I was tryin' to think of words to say So I went up to her and changed my fate - Come on. - ""Come on"" what? - Let's dance. - No, thanks. - Laurie, I said I wanna dance. - Who's stopping you? I thought you might wanna dance with me our last night together. How sentimental of you. You'll be back at Christmas. - I want to dance now, not at Christmas. - Get your cooties off me! - Don't make a scene. - Go ahead. Slug me. Scar my face! I wouldn't dance with you if you were the last guy in this gym. - This is getting good. - Come on, Eddie, I'll dance with you. You don't mind, do you, Peggy? Joe College strikes out.

Middlebury. Vermont. - Got a scholarship. - Only stayed a semester. One semester, after all that. Came back here. Why'd you come back? Decided I wasn't the competitive type. I don't know. Maybe I was scared. Well, I think I may find that I'm not... the competitive type myself. - What do you mean? - I'm not really sure that I'm going. Now, don't be stupid. Experience life. Have some fun, Curtis-- Bill? Mr. Wolfe? Can I speak with you a minute? - Hi, Curt. -Jane. Good luck, Curtis. Yeah. I'll see ya. Thanks a lot. A Wolfman Jack exclusive! The Beach Boys, baby.

And the front end of this thing you're drivin'... looks a little low. No, sir. It's 12 1/2 inches, regulation size. It's been checked several times. You can check it if you like, sir. Look, Milner. Listen. You can't fool with the law. We know that was you tonight. We have an excellent description of this car. I could run you in right now, and I could make it stick. But I'm not gonna do that. You know why? I want to catch you in the act... and when I do, I'm gonna nail you but good. Happy birthday, Milner. Thank you, asshole. You're a regular J.D. File that under C.S. over there. C.S.? What's that stand for? Chicken shit. That's what it is. Ain't he neat? You know a guy around here with a piss-yellow deuce coupe? - Supposed to be hot stuff? - You mean John Milner? Ain't nobody can beat him, man. He's got the fastest-- - I ain't nobody, dork. Right? - Right. You see this Milner, you tell him I'm lookin' for him, huh? Tell him I aim to blow his ass right off the road. Ain't he neat? What a babe! What a bitchin' babe! Hello. You sure you don't need a lift somewhere? You know John Milner? John Milner's a good friend of mine. Did anybody ever tell you that you look just like Connie Stevens? - You do. I really mean it. - For real? Yeah. I met her once at a Dick Clark road show. -Yeah? You really think I look like her? -Yeah, no shit. I'm sorry. I mean-- I mean that I'm not just feeding you a line. I really think you do. You look like Connie Stevens. - What's your name? - Debbie. I always thought I look like Sandra Dee. - Well, you look a lot like her too. - Is this your car? Yeah. I'm Terry, the-- - They usually call me Terry the Tiger. - It's really tough-lookin'. - What school you go to? - Dewey. Can it lay rubber? Yeah, I got a 327 Chevy in it. It's got six Strombergs. That's bitchin' tuck-and-roll. I really love the feel of tuck-and-roll. You do? Well, come in. I'll let you feel it. I mean you can touch it if you want. I'll let you feel the upholstery. Okay. - Peel out. - What? Peel out. I just love it when guys peel out. And they came all the way from Stockton. Let's hear it. I don't care if you leave this second. And we wanna thank Darby Langdon, who did all these neat decorations. Now the next dance is gonna be a snowball... and leading it off is lastyear's class president, Steve Bolander... and this year's head cheerleader, Laurie Henderson. - Come on. - """"Come on"""" what? Steven, please. Smile or something. Quit pinching! You think I care if you go off? You think I'm gonna crack up? - Boy, are you conceited! - I don't know why I ever asked you out. - You didn't. I asked you out. - What do you mean, you asked me out? Backwards Day. Remember? If I had waited for you to ask me-- Oh, brother! Even after that, you didn't call me for two weeks. - I was busy. - You were scared. Dave Ogler told me. When you did ask me out, you didn't kiss me for three dates. - Well, I was-- - Scared. Jim Kiler told me. I even asked my father why you hadn't kissed me. - Your father. Great. - You know what he said? He said he thought you were bright enough... and that you'd probably get around to it after a while. You didn't, of course. I had to. Remember the picnic? Out at the canyon? Boy! You don't remember anything, do you? The first one, up at the lake. That was the first time you kissed me. I had to practically throw myself at you. I remember. What's wrong? Go to hell. What are you doin', stealin' hubcaps? - Well, hey, Wendy. - How've you been? Fine. - Great. How you been? - Wait a sec. Wait a minute! Bobbie Tucker. She's got her car. - Heard you're going away to school. - Maybe, maybe. - What? - Same old Curt. All the time we were going together, you never knew what you were doing. - I gotta go. - Where ya goin'? - Nowhere. - You mind if I come along? - Okay. - Okay. Louie, Louie Me gotta go A fine little girl She's waitin' for me Catch a ship across the sea Sail the ship all alone Never think I'll make it home All right, Bolander, break that up. You know the rules. You and your girlfriend wanna do that, go someplace else, huh? Hey, Kroot. Why don't you go kiss a duck? - What did you say? - I said go kiss a duck, marble-head. All right, Bolander, you are suspended. Don't you even come in Monday. You're out! I graduated last semester. Remember? Why don't we go out to the canal? What for? Listen, I can get tough with you too, you know. Hard guy. A double Chubby Chuck, a chili-barb, two orders of French fries and-- - Cherry Coke. - And two Cherry Cokes. What? Right. Cool. Hey, Deb. How's my soft baby? Come on. Beat it, Vic. I'm not your baby. Come on, honey. So I never called you back. I been, you know, busy. Yeah, three weeks? Besides, it only took me one night to realize... if brains were dynamite, you couldn't blow your nose. Look who's talking. Who's the wimp you're hangin' out with now? Einstein? Tiger happens to be very intelligent, unlike you. I know everything your dirty little mind is thinking. It shows. Hey, now, buddy, look. The lady obviously doesn't want-- Look, creep. You want a knuckle sandwich? No, thanks. I'm waitin' for a double Chubby Chuck. Then keep your smart-ass mouth shut. I'll call you sometime, Deb. - Some night when I'm hard up. - I won't be home. Get out of here. You seem to know a lot of weird guys. That creep's not a friend of mine. He's just horny. That's why I like you. You're different. I-- I am? I mean, you really think I'm intelligent? Yeah. And I bet you're smart enough to get us some brew. Brew? Oh, liquor. Yeah, this place is too crowded anyway. What about your hamburgers and Cokes, sir? Will you speed up? You're gonna lose her. Cut around him. Just hang a right at the corner. Lost her again. - Who is she? - I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. I know who she is. Well, come on, Bob. Come on! Who is she? Come on! You know Mr. Beeman? He owns Hepcat Jewelers? That's his wife. Get outta here. That's ridiculous. That girl is young and beautiful. - And married. - And she was cruising Tenth Street. You gotta be thinkin' of someone else. Did you know that my ex is going to become a presidential aide? It's a secret, so don't tell anybody, but his greatest ambition... is to shake hands with President Kennedy. How do you suppose you're gonna do that, wishy-washy, at J.C.? Maybe I've grown up. Maybe I changed my mind. - Doubt it. - Maybe you don't think you can do it. - Maybe you oughta shut up. - Maybe I ought to, but I won't. Maybe you oughta come into the aft chamber... where we can discuss this in private. Thanks a lot. Come on, Wendy. Move over. I'm not sitting on your lap. - To the opera, James. - Drop dead. Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam and have a little orgy. You wish! I could pick up some margarine. We could roll around in it for a while. - I've been silly. - Yeah? I'm really glad you're gonna stay. We might even have a class together. - Maybe. - Look. - Maybe. - Look. There's Kip Pullman. He's so neat. Say somethin' to him when we go by. - What do you want me to say? - Anything. I just wanna meet him. Hey, Kip, buddy. What's up? Hey, Henderson, long time no see. What you been doin'? Nothin'. I just wanted to tell you Bobbie here is madly in love with you... and trembles at the sight of your rippling biceps. - Out of my car, you-- - Wait a second! I hate you! Get out of my car! Temper, temper! Here it is: one ten-cent Coke with ice. And don't take all day drinkin' it. Please. Rats! I thought some of my friends might be here. Probably a couple of weeks past their bed time. There's Dee Dee. I hope she sees me. Oh, shit. Dee Dee. Hiya,John. - What do you say, Al? - Not much. You think if I brought my Mopar by the shop on Monday... you could spot-weld the bumper bracket? Sure, anything.Just come by before noon, all right? - You met Linda? - No, no. Hi, Linda. This is my cousin, Carol. I'm baby-sittin'. - Baby-sitting! -Jesus! Watch it, will ya? Been hittin' me all night. Kids will be kids, you know. Goddamn it! Why don't you grow up, for Christ's sake? We don't get along too well, you know? - Been like this all-- - You spastic creep. Hi, cousin. How's your bod? Wolfman Top 40 is Box 1300, Chula Vista. Wolfmans weat shirts is Wolf Enterprises, Bakersfeld. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, son? I was wondering-- - Could you give me the time? - Sure. It's quarter to 12:00. Quarter to 12:00. Good. Thanks a lot. Excuse me, sir. I got a problem. See, I lost my I.D. in a food... and I was wondering, since you're going in there anyway... could you pick me up some Old Harper's-- hard stuff? - Would you buy me a bottle? - Why, certainly. I lost my wife too. Her name wasn't Idy though... and it wasn't in a food, but I know what you-- Yeah, good. Here's some money. Old Harper. - Quarter to 12:00. - Right-o. - Night. - Night. No, not wine! - Was there an old man in here just now? - Yeah. Just went out the back. Want something? Yeah. Let me have a Three Musketeers... and a ballpoint pen, one of those combs there... a pint of Old Harper... a couple off ashlight batteries and some beefjerky. You got an ID for the liquor? Yeah. Oh, nuts. I left it in the car. Sorry. You'll have to get it before. I also-- I forgot the car. Did you get it? You got it! You didn't get it. Why didn't you get it? I needed some things and I thought as long as I was in there-- Look, Debbie, can you loan me a dollar? Are you for real? Come on. Girls don't pay. Guys pay. See, I've only got a 50, and he doesn't have change. I can't believe this. I really cannot believe this. Here. - Excuse me. Could you-- - Buy you a bottle of booze? Yeah, I know. You lost your I.D. What kind doyou want? Gee, that's terrific. Just some Old Harper? That one over there-- that's Freddy Benson's 'Vette. He had a head-on collision with a drunk. Boom! Didn't have a chance. He was a good driver too. It's pretty grim when a guy gets it and it's not even his own fault. Needs a paintjob, that's for sure. See that over there? That '41 ? That used to be-- believe it or not-- the fastest car in the valley. I never got a chance to race Earl, though. He got his 1955 in about the hairiest crash we ever had here. Jesus, you should've seen it. Eight kids killed and both drivers. Board of Education was real impressed, so they filmed the whole thing. Now they show it in driver's education classes. Probably see it if you get lucky. Course, pretty tough when they take somebody with them. You've never had an accident though. You told me. Well, I come mighty close. Almost rolled it a couple of times. But I've been just quick enough to stay out of this graveyard. Bet you're the fastest. I've never been beat. A lot of guys tried. Seems to me there's more guys lately than there's ever been. Sneakin'around with the Wolfman, baby. This is gonna strike arawnerve. Mama. Here's The Platters. Oh, yes I'm the great pretender Pretending that I'm doing well My need is such I pretend too much I'm lonely but no one can tell What are you doin', creep? Who, me? No, I'm talkin' to the other 50 creeps here. You know Gil Gonzales? No, I don't. Don't know Gil. Well, you oughta. He's a friend of ours. That's his car you got your butt parked on. - Where you goin'? - Nowhere. You must be goin' some place. You left here, didn'tya? Bring him over here. I want to show him somethin'. Bend down here. Look across here. See? Right across there. You see? - I guess so. - You scratched it, man. Where do you get off sittin' on Gil's car, man? Sorry. It's really not much of a scratch. I don't think you'd see it. It ain't the size that's in question here. It's the principle! Jeez, this is gonna be tough. What should we do with you? Tie him to the car and drag him. You know Toby Juarez? He's a Pharaoh, isn't he? Sure, we know Toby. We killed him last night. Tied him to the car and dragged him. This is gonna take some thinkin'. You better come with us and maybe take a ride with the Pharaohs, huh? No, listen, I'd really like to, but I've gotta-- I'd rather-- I know just howyou feel. - Shotgun. - No, I called it. - When? - Before we picked you up. You can't call it for the whole night. I got it now. Get in the back, punk. Will you get in there? Jesus! Rock 'n'roll will stand, man! Whois this on the Wolfman telephone? - Hello, it's collect. - Your name is Collette? - Yeah, collect call for Wolfman-- - Your name is Collette Call? - Sir, this is the operator. - Are you French, operator? This is a collect call for Wolfman Jack. - I love you, operator. - Is this Wolfman Jack? - Is Floyd there? - It's for Wolfman Jack. I just love listenin' to Wolfman. My mom won't let me at home. Because he's a Negro. I think he's terrific. Do you know that he broadcasts from a plane... that fies around in circles all the time? Do you believe that? Floyd, I love you, Floyd. Floyd, is this you, Floyd? Floyd, I cannot look on thee. Love took my hand and smiling did reply... """"Who made the eyes but I?"""" Floyd, reach out. Touch my soul, Floyd! - Your party's ready, sir. - Hello, Floyd! You tell her, Wolfman! He's my man. When I graduate, I'm gonna be a Wolfman. - He broadcasts out of Mexico someplace. - No, he don't. I've seen the station outside of town. That's just a clearing station. So he can fool the cops. He blasts that thing around the world. It's against the law, man. - They'll never catch the Wolfman. - No way. Man, who cut the cheese? """" He who smelt it, dealt it."""" There's that bad-ass Chevy again. Look at that snatch he's got with him. - He looks like a wimp. - Probably is. Wimps get all the snatch. Milner ain't gonna beat that. His time has come. He's gettin' old. He ain't as fast as he used to be. You got two seconds to get your ass over in your corner. Don't worry, I won't rape you. - You got a bitchin' car. - Yeah, I know. In fact, your car's so neat, we're gonna give you our special prize. You want me to give it to ya? Sweetheart, if the prize is you, I'm a ready Teddy. Well, get bent, turkey! Very funny! What a chop! Ha-ha! Quit laughing! -Jump out and fatten their tires. - Wait a minute. -Just do what I say! - All right, boss. It's a really beautiful night tonight. It's a perfect night for horseback riding. I was going with a guy who had horses once. - Yeah? I had a couple of horses myself. - Really? I used them for hunting. I do a lot of hunting. Deer mostly. Got a couple of bear lastyear. Those were good ponies. Had to train 'em myself. Took a lot of time. Do you still have 'em? We can go for a ride. No, no. I had to sell 'em to get these wheels. And a Jeep. I got a Jeep pickup with four-wheel drive. It's got a gun rack. I use that for hunting mostly. Why do you kill little animals? I think that's terrible. Well, yeah. I figure with bears, though, it's me or them. - I think you're really neat. - Wait a second. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I guess maybe it's the booze or somethin'. - Oh! You pinched me. - I'm sorry. Let me get my head over here. You get up. Okay. My leg, my leg! Watch it. I just love tuck-and-roll upholstery. Jesus, it's like Grand Central Station around here. - Why don't we go someplace else? - Come on. They won't come back. Wait a minute. I got a blanket in the back. Why don't we go over into the field? All right. Okay. - How old are you? - I'm 13. How old are you? - I'm only 14. - I love you, Wolfman. We're gonna do the weather for the valleys and mountain tops. It's gonn abe hot. About 200 degrees in Merced. Four hundred degrees out in Fresno. And about 500 degrees up around the valley somewhere. You got the Wolfman Jack Show! This is terrific. I love miniature golf. Is that right? I hate it. I don't play it too often. What are we doing here? We're outta gas, man. They don't sell gas here. I know. But we're outta money too. What are you punks doin'? What's goin' on here? Hi, Mr. Gordon. What's up? Henderson? Curt Henderson? Are you with these punks? These are just some friends of mine. We're just-- You know. You had me nervous there for a second, huh? You didn't leave yet, huh? No, I'm not-- I'm not scheduled to leave until tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? Hank Anderson's inside. Come in and say good-bye. He brought your name up at the Moose Hall. You got the check? Hank, look who's here. How are you, Curt? What a pleasant surprise. Congratulations, my boy. We're all proud of you. All of us. The Moose scholarship went to the right boy--you. And we're all proud of you. We're all done out here. All done? What's he mean? He means we're all done having loads of fun out here. You can have all the fun you want. This place is for fun. Yes, it is. Thank you. Thank you both. Good luck, son. Before I say good-bye, I hope you'll be taking along with you... a little piece of this place. I think I have. Good. Don't forget us. No, I won't forget you, and you won't forget me. - Bye-bye. - Good-bye and good luck. - It was nice to meet ya. - What he said goes for me too. You just might make it as a Pharaoh yet, boy. Someday he'll make a fine Moose. What's the matter? The radio's gone. That means the car is gone! Come on. Oh, God! Not the car! Oh, no! Anything! Not the car! You know, it doesn't make sense... to leave home to look for home. To give up a life to find a new life. To say good-bye to friends you love just to find new friends. - Wait, could you say that again? - Something Curt said. Figures. You must've talked his ear off tryin' to get him to stay. No, Steven. That's not true at all. I didn't say anything. Curt just said at dinner tonight... that he didn't see what the big hurry was. He thought that he ought to stay and go to J.C. for a while... and try and figure out what he wanted to do with his life. - That sounds logical. - Do you think so? Sure. I think Curt's probably right, for Curt. Not for me, though. Laurie, look at me. You know what I want out of life. And it's just not in this town. I'm not going with you to the airport tomorrow. - No, Steven, don't. - Come on. It's our last night together for three months. I know. But we've been through this before. I'm gonna miss you so much. I need something to remember you by. You don't want me to forget you, do you? No. What's wrong? You're just sitting there. - You want to. Go ahead. - Not like that. If you're not gonna remember me for anything else,just go ahead. Come on. You want it and you know it. Don't be so damn self-righteous with me... after all that stuff you told me about watching your brother. You're disgusting! Get out of my car! I told you never to mention that! So, anyhows, the goat killer-- - Can't we talk about something else? - No. Whenever he strikes, he leaves a bloody goat's head next to the victim. Isn't that creepy? They thought he went up to Stockton, but two nights ago... they found the bodies of Carlie Johnson and Don White... right here at this canal all hacked to pieces. Who do you think'll take the regionals this year? Not only were there bloody goats' heads all around... but he had switched parts of their bodies. She had on his arms and he had on her legs and-- Wait a second! Did you hear that? - Doyou think it's the goat killer? - No! Listen, I'll go for help and you stay here. No, let's get in this field. Come on, come on! Maybe if it's the goat killer, he'll get somebody and we'll see the whole thing. I don't want to see the whole thing! I can't see what he's doing. Darn it, I wish I could see. I can't see anything. I don't wanna see anything. Just keep him away from me. That's all I want. How do I get into these things? We're all right up-- Debbie? - Oh, no! Please! Please! - Terry. - Steve! - What are you doin' up here? Oh, God, Steve. Is it safe to come out? - Where did you go, anyway? - Over there. - Let's get outta here. - Where's my 'rod? - Your 'rod? - Yeah. Did I introduce you? This is Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve. Well? It's in the garage. I put it in the garage for safe keeping. I don't want to take any chances with it. It's a good thing too, because somebody stole our car. - That's terrible. What kind was it? - Where's Laurie anyway? - I guess we broke up. - You broke up? Bull. Doesn't look like a gearshift knob. What is it? - Come on, give it back to me. - What's wrong? You're a tough guy. Go ahead and cream me. Break my arm. See if I care. I was just gonna keep it for a little while. You're an ogre, like my father. He won't let me stay out late, or play records, or anything. Your fatherwon't let you stay out late? No, he's terrible. Once I was out late at a party. He called the cops. Can you imagine? He had the whole police force there. By the way, where is it that you live, Carol? Over on Ramona. Why? Oh, no! You thought I'd tell you where I live? Not me. Not old Carol. The night is young. And I'm not hittin' the rack till I get a little action. What do you keep lookin' at? Who's that? You know him? - He's followin' awful close. - Grab on to something. Hey, man, I'm sorry if I scared ya. You'd have to do a hell of a lot more than that to scare me. I been lookin' all over for ya. Didn't nobody tell you? I can't keep track of all you punks runnin' around here backwards. You're supposed to be the fastest thing in the valley. But that can't be your car. It must be your mama's car. I'm sort of embarrassed to be this close to you. I'm not surprised, drivin' a field car. Field car? What's a field car? A field car runs through the fields, drops cow shit all over the place. That's pretty good. I like the color of your car, man. What's that supposed to be? A cross between piss yellow and puke green, ain't it? You call that a paint job, but it's pretty ugly. I'll bet you gotta sneak up on the pumps just to get a little air in your tires. At least I don't have to pull over to the side just to let a funeral go by. Funny. You know what? Your car's uglier than I am! That didn't come out right. Come on, boy. Let's go. Prove it. Why don't you go out and try to win yourself a few races? Then you come on back and I'll show you a few things. Race him. You can beat him. That's a tough-lookin' girl you got with you, man. Tryin' to pick up a few extra bucks baby-sittin'? Doll, come and ride with me-- in about ten years! Leave her out of this. This is between you and me. He's really fast, isn't he? Yeah, but he's stupid. Any of you guys know a blonde in a white T-Bird? I know her. What about it? I'm tryin' to find out who she is. She's out of your price range, man. - My brother's been out with her. - Price range? Are you trying to tell me she's a prost-- That's right, she's a $30 Sheri. Can you imagine that? - Thirty bucks for that broad. - We're thinkin' about different broads. Watch it. Fuzz ahead. - Where? - AtJerry's Cherry. You can barely see the fender. Yeah. We oughta do somethin'. I got an idea. I got a good idea. I think I'm gonna go over to Burger City. Yeah, Laurie's probably over there. You think she's got me worried about where she is, don't you? I couldn't care less. - Want to come along? - Yeah, I do. - No. - Make up your minds. No, thanks. We got to report the car missing. All right. I'll see ya. Shut up! They'll hear us. - Listen, Carl-- - Curt. Despite you scratchin' Gil's car, I like you. And I know what you'd like more than anything right now. Like every guy in this town, you got the same secret dream, right? You wanna be a Pharaoh. Go ahead. You can admit it. But you didn't think it was possible, did you? Well, tonight... I'm gonna give you your chance. Get down. Okay. Now, you got it? - I'm stayin' here. You're on your own. - Wait a minute, Joe. - What if he hears me? - Listen, listen! Look at it this way. You got three choices. One, you chicken out. In that case, I let Ants tie you to the car and drag you around a bit. - You don't want that, right? - No. Two, you foul up and Holstein hears you, and, well-- - You don't want that, right? - No, I don't. Three, you are successful and you join the Pharaohs... with a car coat and a blood initiation and all that. Wait a minute. What blood initiation? Why don't we go get your Jeep? - What are you talking about? - Your Jeep. The one you sold the hunting ponies for. The one with the four-wheel drive. You sure you got enough slack? Yeah, no sweat. Let's get outta here. Come on, Terry. Stand by for justice! I can't believe it. Feeling so good 'cause you're 16. Ooh, you come on like a dream Peaches and cream Lips like strawberry wine You're 16 You're beautiful and you're mine Why are we stopping here? - Carol. - What? I don't think that I can control myself any longer. - You can't? - I've got to have you. Me? All night you've been sitting there and you've been so sexy... and it's been so hot out here... and I can't wait any longer. A lot of that was an act, you know. Like my crying. That was just an act. It's been building up inside of me like a volcano all night. If you told me where you lived, then I could take you home... but you won't tell me where you live, so here we are. I mean, I've got to have you. It's too late. It's not too late. It's never too late! 231 Ramona. Two-three-one. I'll show you. It's easy to find. Hi, Steve. Mind if I sit down? No. Have a seat. Just got five minutes off and I saw you all alone... for once. - Where's Laurie? - I don't know. I thought you guys'd be together, this being your last night. - We broke up. - What? - It's no big deal. - What happened? Budda, you got an hour left. Let's get on it. All right, all right, you old fart! Relax! Listen. I'm off in an hour, and I thought you'd maybe like to come over. - I don't know. - Well, why not? This time it'd just be for fun. Okay? Okay. I'll see you later, then. Budda, wait. Listen, I-- I gotta get up early in the morning and I don't think it'd work out. I tell you somethin'. That thing jumped about five feet in the air-- Listen, I still gotta find that blonde. Anyway, we'll catch you tomorrow. I guess so. I don't know. What do you mean, you guess so? We don't admit a lot of guys to the Pharaohs. We got to steal your car coat, things like that. You gotta make up your mind. Rome wasn't burned in a night. - Let's go! - I'll see you, boys. You only got about five minutes if you want to talk to the Wolfman. Gonna make all your dreams come true, baby. Hello! Would you dedicate a record to keep me and my girlfriend together? -Are you separated? - We're havin' a little problem. I'll bring you right together. Hold on a minute, man. Everything's gonna be allright now, man, understand? I chased the evil spirits away. Now let me play the record for ya. Hey, baby. What do you say? Don't say anything and we'll get along just fine. This is the first time you've been quiet all night. I had fun. Good-bye. Bye. - Do you like me? - Yeah, I like you. You're all right. But I mean do you like me? I like you. Okay? Couldn't I have something to remember you by? - Bye, kid. - Gee, thanks! It's just like a ring or something. It's like we were going steady. Wait'll I tell Marcia and everybody! - Don't go overboard with this thing. - I'll see you around. I haven't cried so much. Tears and everything, man. I leaned towards the microphone, I almost shorted myself out! I leaned towards the microphone, I almost shorted myself out! - Hold that up. - You're right about that. But why should I leave home to find a home? Why should I leave friends that I love to find new friends? Wait a minute, wait a minute! I've heard this already. Aren't you the one that told me for eight weeks... that you have to leave the nest sometime? I realize that. No ""realizing"". You've been telling me all summer... that it's time to stick your head out of the sand... and take a look at the big, beautiful world out there somewhere. Gimme this thing. I feel like a midwife. I may have been wrong, Curt. Wrong, nothing! You've been telling me for eight weeks. - Goddamn it. - Yeah, I know. You're just mentally playing with yourself. Just relax and we'll talk about it at the airport. Where're you going? It's awfully early in the morning. - I have a dental appointment. - Come on, Curt. Just relax, will ya? I'll see you at the airport. Some enchanted evening You will see a stranger You will see a stranger Across a crowded room And suddenly you'll know That she is the one - He mustn't have been used to drinking. - No. He likes to drink. He told me so. I knew a man once who got that sick. Billy Weber. That was ten years ago. On his hands and knees like that he looks like a dog, like old Ginger. Sicker'n a dog, that's for sure. - Are you all right? - Oh, rats. I feel terrible. The car! Debbie, look! Debbie, that's the car! Look. It's sitting right here. - Are you sure this is it? - Yeah, sure. This is it. They must've taken the keys with 'em. - Maybe we better go call the police. - No. Wait a minute. I got a better idea. We'll just steal it back, all right? You get some wire-- about a foot. We can hot-wire it. Took the header plugs off? Expectin' some action? Yeah, I think so. There's some punk lookin' for me. Why the hell do they bother? You've always been number one. Been a long time, ain't it? I'll see you. Thanks. Hi, this is my car. What I mean is, somebody stole-- No, I mean, I lost my car, see? And I want to thank you two guys for retur-- I mean, now listen. Now, listen, guys. I've been sick, and this kind of activity can really be hard on a guy. Easy. Easy. Stop it! Stop it! Help! Police! Help! Stop it, you creeps! - Go, John! - Get him! Come on, get up! Come on! What the hell's going on here, Toad? Man, are you all right? Yeah, I'll die soon and it'll all be over,John. Wow, you're just like the Lone Ranger! Listen-- Are you with him? You're talking to the woman I love. What happened, man? - Hi, Steve. - Hi,Judy. Hi, Karen. Where's Laurie? We know where she is. So what? So nothing. It's just that she was with a really cute guy... in a really boss car. And we thought you just might know who it was. - I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know. - We know. His name's Bob Falfa. Bring two cherry Cokes with lots of ice. No, never mind. Just bring the ice. Pronto. Out! Out! Get out of the car. Steve, what are you doin'? Just get out and shut up. You too. Get out. Get out! - What's going on? - I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. I can't believe it. You practically get killed trying to get your car back... then you let him have it. It's not my car. What? It is not my car. Well, then, where is your car? I don't have a car. What about your Jeep? How am I gonna get home? Where's your car? I have to hang 'em on a car. I need a ride. Toad, what happened to you? Did you lose your car again? No, Steve took it. I want to go to sleep. You got to take it easy when you drive that car of yours. You've got to cruise easy, baby. Don't be doin' any accidents or anything on me now. You know, Terry? I had a pretty good time tonight. - Come on. You're just-- - No, no. Really, really. I really had a good time. I mean, you picked me up and we got some hard stuff... saw a hold up and then we went to the canal. You got your car stolen. And then I got to watch you get sick. Then you got in this really bitchin' fight. I really had a good time. Well, I guess I have a pretty good time just about every night. If I'm not doing anything tomorrow... why don't you give me a call, okay? Yeah, all right. I got a little Vespa I play around with. Maybe, you know-- Really? Well, that's almost a motorcycle... and I just love motorcycles. You do? Why didn't you say something earlier? We wouldn't have had to go through all the fun. I gotta go. - Good night. - See ya. Hey, what do you want? Push the red switch down. I'm looking for this girl. Yeah. Aren't we all? She's not here. Come on in the back. You just go around the back. This way. Have a popsicle. The ice box just broke down and they're melting. - You want one? - No, no, thanks. - Listen-- - Have a popsicle. Are you the Wolfman? No, man. I'm not the Wolfman. Wait a minute. Who is this on the Wolfman's telephone? That's the Wolfman. He's on tape. The man is on tape. Where is he now? I mean, where does he work? The Wolfman is everywhere. I gotta give him this note. Shit! Here, let me see the note. Hell, that's just a dedication, man. What I can do is relay it. - It'll be on tomorrow or Tuesday. - No, no, this is very important. I may be leaving town tomorrow and it's very important... that I reach this girl right now. You don't know whether you're going to leave town or not? I'm supposed to go to college back east tomorrow. And I don't know if I'm going to go. I don't know. Wait a minute. Have a popsicle. - No, thanks. - Sit down a minute. - It's early in the morning. - Damn. I can't talk for the Wolfman... but I can tell you one thing. If the Wolfman was here, he'd say, ""Get your ass in gear"". The Wolfman comes in here occasionally... bringing tapes, you know, to check up on me and what not. And the places he talks about that he's been... the things he's seen. It's a great big beautiful world out there. And here I sit... sucking on popsicles. Why don't you leave? I'm not a young man anymore. The Wolfman gave me my start in the business, and I like it. I tell you what. If I can possibly do it tonight... I'll try to relay this dedication in... and get it on the air for you later on. That would be terrific. Really. Thanks. Just a minute. - It's been a pleasure, really. - Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Sticky little mothers, ain't they? Six or seven of them, right? I know. I got a whole refrigerator full. - Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. - See you later. Rock on, baby. We gonna do it right here. Rock 'n' roll yourself to death. Oh, mercy! Give me some more! My, my. John, let me go with you. Come on. Nah, man, I can't take you when I'm racin' somebody. Just let me go. I just want to watch. Or I'll fag you, okay? All right. Go ahead. Paradise Road. Where's this Paradise Road? Just follow this street straight out of town. If you're going to race John Milner, let me out when we get there. Why don't you shut up, baby? You ain't said one word all night long. You're a weird broad. But you're gonna appreciate me soon. You'll be hanging on for mercy when I get this sucker rollin'. Headin' out to Paradise Road? Paradise Road? Some guy named Falfa's goin' up against Milner. - He's racing Falfa? - Yeah. Figured something's up. Saw 'em head out of town real cautious-like and-- I got a dedication here for a friend of the old Wolfman. He wants me to play the next song... for a blonde young lady in a Thunderbird. A white T-Bird, you understand. My friend's name is Curt and he wants to talk to you, baby. So yo umeet him at Burger City... or you can phone Diamond-3132. He's a friend of mine, you hear? Little girl, you better call him or the Wolfman gonna get ya. Laurie, what in the hell are you doing in there? - Is she gonna ride with you? - Mind your own business,John. Yeah, she's going with me. You take care of yourself, man. You guys ready? You son of a bitch! Come on, she's gonna blow. I don't know. Please, don't come near me. I'm gonna be sick. Oh, Steven. Oh, Steven! Please don't leave me. - Don't leave me, please. - I won't. I couldn't bear it. Please. I'm not gonna leave you. - I'm not gonna leave you. - Promise me. - I promise. - Do you? I'm not gonna leave you. That was beautiful, John. Just beautiful. - I was losin', man. - What? He was pulling away from me just before he crashed. You're crazy! You creamed him from right off the line. Shit, Toad! The man had me. He was beatin' me. John, I don't know what you're talking about. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. He might as well get a wheel chair and roll himself home. Man, you got the bitchinest car in the valley. You'll always be number one. You're the greatest. Look at your glasses, man. Okay, Toad. We'll take 'em all. - All right. - We'll take 'em. Let's get out of here. Jesus, what a night! - Curt? - Yes! Yes. This is Curt. - Who are you? - Who were you expecting? - Do you drive a white T-Bird? -A white '56. I saw you on Third Street. Who are you? Do you know me? Of course! - How do you know me? - It's not important. It's important! It's important to me. You're the most beautiful, exciting thing I've ever seen in my life... and I don't know anything about you. Listen, listen-- - Could we meet some place? - I cruise Third Street. Maybe I'll see you tonight. No, I don't think so. Tell me your name! At least tell me your name! - Good-bye, Curt. - Wait a minute! Little kiss on your ear. Goodnight, sweet heart. I'll see you later. Oh, The Spaniels. Good-bye, son. Call us when you get there. I'll miss you. Good luck. Same to you. - Am I gonna see you there next year? - I'll be there. Bye-bye, Curt. Stay cool, man. And don't do anything I wouldn't do. I'll see you, buddy. You probably think you're a big shot going off like this. But you're still a punk. Okay, John. - So long. - So long! Have a good trip., Okay, go ahead. My name is Sidney Westerfeld. I'm the owner of this antique tavern... ...Monmouth Valley, New York State. I was here when this crowd really came. We expected fifty thousand a day, and there must have been a million! I, myself, was hungry for two days, because I couldn't get any food in. I couldn't get out to buy any food. I was eating cornflakes for two days! And the kids were wonderful. I have no kicks. It was ""sir"" this and ""sir"" that, and... ...""thank you"" this and ""thank you"" that. Nobody can complain about the kids. This thing was too big. It was too big for the world! Nobody has ever seen a thing like this! And when they see this picture in the news, over the moving pictures... ...they'll really see something! ""It's been a long time coming..."" ""...because it's been a long time gone..."" ""...and it appears to be a long..."" ""...appears to be a long..."" ""...appears to be a long..."" ""...time. It's a long, long, long, long time..."" ""...before the dawn.""

What's the worst part of running one? I don't know. You dig it all? I guess the biggest hassle is dealing with politics. You know. Is there a lot of politics involved? You mean with the cities? And you got that solved? Well, it looks that way. How long did it take you to put it together. Two, three months? Uh, been working on it for about nine months. Nine months! Full time? Are you in charge of the whole thing? Yes. But you got backers? Partners and backers. Where are you going to go from here? I mean, are you going to do another one? If it works. Aw, you're really good tonight! You know... ...this is the most outrageous spectacle I've ever witnessed. Ever! There's only one thing I wish. I sure have to pee! And there just is nowhere to go! I believe we're ""GOING UP THE COUNTRY"" a little bit right now. ""I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"" ""I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"" ""I'm going to someplace, where I've never been before."" ""I'm going, I'm going, where the water tastes like wine."" ""I'm going where the water tastes like wine."" ""We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time."" ""I'm going to leave this city. Got to get away."" ""I'm going to leave this city. Got to get away."" ""All this fussing and fighting, man, you know I sure can't stay."" ""Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk. You know we've got to leave today."" ""Just exactly where we're going, I cannot say..."" ""...but we might even leave the U.S.A."" ""Because it's a brand new game and I want to play."" ""No use in your running or screaming and crying..."" ""...because you've got a home as long as I've got mine."" ""If you smile at me, I will understand..."" ""...because that is something everybody, everywhere does in the same way."" ""I can't see why you called a friend from the other side."" ""There's just one thing I've got to know..."" ""...can you tell me who I am?"" ""Say, can I have some of your purple berries?"" ""Yes, I've been eating them six or seven weeks now."" ""Haven't got sick once, probably keep us both alive."" ""Wooden ships on the water..."" ""...very free, easy, easy."" ""You know, the way it's supposed to be."" ""Silver people on the shoreline, let us be."" ""Talking about very free and easy."" ""All the ships that watch as you die..."" ""...all they can do is echo your anguished cry."" ""Still I go keep on feeling, why?"" ""We are leaving. You don't need us."" What do you think? Well, what could I think? We're in the middle of the, of the situation and we make the best of it. It's about all we can do. We were standing on the curbs watching them come in, uh, last night. All the townspeople. It was just like a, an army invading a town. It's hard to believe. Do you live here? No, we're here for a vacation. Are you having one? We did, up until last night. They kept us up for a while. Who is they? Freaks. Is that what you call yourselves? Sure. Why? Well, because that's what everybody else calls us. What do you call yourself that for? Because we admit it. Compared to everybody else, we're freaks. I don't think you are. As long as you behave yourself, there's nothing wrong. I'm not putting bad connotations on the word ""freak"", you know. I'm just... Don't you think that the word ""freak"" itself has a bad connotation? It's whatever you think about it. Last time we saw anything like this was at the Rose Bowl Parade last New Year's. That's right. Like four ice cubes out of the bag, you know. They wanted to buy four ice cubes? Yeah, right. I don't know, what can you charge them for ice cubes? You know. It's a great shot in the arm to Sullivan County, business-wise. Something we needed. As far as whether it will leave a favorable effect later, besides money... ...we'll know when the festival is over. Uh, they're beautiful people. Well is this festival affecting you in any way? Well, it's kind of overwhelming us. Put it this way. In what way? Just to take care of, to try to get the people fed, I would say is one of the main objectives here. I know all these young fellows here, they've got to be fed and they're going to get hungry. I hope that they can bring enough supplies in for, for... That seems to be the big trouble. And traffic, that's... well, you know yourself without me telling you. What's it done for business? Oh, come on. What's it done? Increased it about what? As much as you can do. Put it this way. And more. I'll say one thing for the young people. They've been very nice. All of them. So far. It's really amazing. Yet it looks like some kind of Biblical, epochal... ...unbelievable scene! They're all, you know, like all... You see these cars, they're strewn on the sides of the roads from the helicopters and... ...in all different angles, you know. They look like jackstraws and stuff like that. There is this continual flow of people just riding the stream. They're going along and it... Jerry, it was all frozen. So let's enjoy. It was all I could get. Well, I mean, I mean, from a practical point of view, what do you think, how could they limit this crowd? They didn't want this many people here, really, I don't think. So you find the control points at the beginning of the highways... ...and those with tickets are allowed in and those without tickets are not. You have to have some control. You know, when you have man-eating... ...Barabunda ants coming over a hill in South America... ...they want to cut them off and stop them from coming. They make a ditch... ...they put oil in the ditch and they make a flame. Now I'm not saying they should put up flames to stop the people... ...but there has to be some way of stopping the influx of humanity. Uh, in numbers, tell me, how many do you expect? Two hundred thousand. Two hundred thousand people here over the three days? Where will you put them? We have contracted for land surrounding the area... ...setting up camp grounds, water facilities, toilets, electric, food. What does it cost to put one of these things together? A fortune. And I suppose the returns will also be good. Yeah, we'll probably... I don't, I don't know what the returns will come up to... ...up to what it's cost or not, but... ...the point is that it's happening. A couple of million dollars. In other words, you have to make two million dollars to break even? Well, if we're going to break even. Huh, you know. The point is that it's happened and it's working... ...and it's enough for now. What is it that musicians have? Are you a musician yourself? What is it the musicians have that they can communicate so well to the kids? Music! I mean, they've always had music. Music has always been a major form of communication. Only now the lyrics and the type of music is a little bit... ...more involved in society than it was. I need something now, let me tell you, to kind of run as a voice over... when I'm showing this music on... If you could, if you could tell me... ...that I can run your voice over while this music is playing... ...what the music is saying, kind of, you know, what that's about. It's about what's happening now... ...and if you listen to the lyrics and you listen to the, to the rhythm... ...and, and what's in the music... ...then you'll know what's, what's going on with the culture. I've got to split. Can we count on you? Great, groovy. Thanks. I'd like... Mike hangs out here. I'd like to see a little bit of him. Just natural sound, while he's getting harassed and bugged. Okay? Now, goddamnit, I was going to call you last week! That means you've got to call me and I've got to get that thing into the air. Now I'm going to order a five-passenger helicopter. I'm really scared the roads are going to get jammed up. If anybody wants anymore rooms... ...shows up with more people than they're supposed to have... ...tell them they can drop back fifteen yards and punt! They've got about as much chance as a snow ball in hell... ...of getting a room closer than Middletown. There's a Holiday Inn in Middletown, New York. Let's clear the road, please! Peel back, peel back there! Let them through. Everything has room to flow here. Please walk... ...on the grass. Walk on the sides of the road if you're going to walk through here. Let's go. How is it out there? We apologize for the, uh, noise of the choppity-choppy, but... ...it seems there are a few cars blocking the road, so we're flying everybody in. I almost made the worst pun in the world about high musicians, but we'll skip that. You know Artie? Artie Kornfeld. How you doing, man? Good to see you, man. Glad you could make the party. It's going beautifully, man. Wouldn't have it any other way. It's really together. Look at the way... It really worked out nice, didn't it? Looks fantastic! The vibes are so beautiful. Everybody helps everybody. Today it feels so great right here, you know? How can I ever live on the east side of Manhattan after this scene? Yeah, man, it smells like strawberries! It's perfume! Oh, it is! ""Just Like A Woman""... ...and ""Let's Get Stoned."" We're in sync, but you can't hear a fucking thing... ...because of the fucking helicopters, so I'm going to quit! Because of the fucking helicopters... ...I can't get a fucking piece of dialogue at all, man. I'm hanging around blowing my brains out! We're getting it tied up. Two or three of the groups are in. We're just trying to match up two groups and equipment and we'll be okay. Can those of you in the back hear well? Raise your hands please. It's all right? Thank you. Marijuana! Exhibit A. Look at all those people! The Daily News, in rather large headlines, still costing ten cents... ...""TRAFFIC UP TIGHT AT HIPPIE FEST."" See, if you see the, show the picture in India... ...they won't believe this is taken in America. Because their impression of American children... ...and American ways is completely different. All neatly dressed, put on hat and tie and sitting on chairs. That's not like this at all. Wheat Germ, Holly has your bag with your medicine. Please meet at the information booth as soon as you can, please. Helen Savage, please call your father at the Motel Glory in Woodridge. The warning that I've received you might take it... ...with however many grains of salt you wish... ...that the brown acid that is circulating around is not specifically too good. It is suggested that you stay away from that... ...but it's your own trip, so be my guest. Please be advised there is a warning on the one, okay? Sam, can you get the monitors on? Get some more guys over here. This is going to be the heavy side. Richard Boch, get back to Eddie Kramer in the sound truck. - Watch your fingers right up there! - Hold it. Mr. Richie Havens!

""I can almost hear its whistle, yeah, yeah, yeah!"" There are a hundred million songs going to be sung tonight. All of them are going to be singing about the same thing... ...which I hope everybody who came, came to hear, really. And it's all about you, actually. And me and everybody around this stage and everybody that hasn't gotten here. And the people who are going to read about you tomorrow. And how really groovy you were. All over the world. If you can dig where that's at. That's really where it's really at. Guitar mike, please. ""Freedom! Freedom!"" ""Sometimes I feel like a motherless child..."" ""...a long way from home.""

What better way to start than with the beautiful ""Richie Havens."" It's worth it. Just to see the lights go on last night, man! Just to see the people stand up, man, it makes it worth it. I mean, I feel there will be people, you know... ...there are people out there that really don't dig it. Very few of them. But you know, it really is to the point where it's just a family, man. All box office people please go to the main box office. We don't need it any more. Somebody unplugged the lines, man. Let's have a hot mike. Number two, number three. You are not giving the world's greatest three day freebee! Okay, there's only one way to do it. There's a way to do it, man. There is no way. The only way to do it is to get into a rap with... It's okay. Come here. Come here. This is one thing I was going to wait a while before we talked about it. But maybe we'll talk about it now so you can think about it. It's a free concert from now on! That doesn't mean that anything goes. What that means is... ...we're going to put the music up here for free. What it means is that the people who are backing this thing... ...who put up the money for it, are going to take a bit of a bath. A big bath. There's no hype, that's true. They're going to get hurt. But what it means is that these people have it in their heads... ...that your welfare is a hell of a lot more important... ...and so is the music, than a dollar. Look, when they hook the electricity up, a great jolt runs all the way through here. If you've got the ticket, you disconnect the circuit and... ...otherwise you disintegrate. Wendy and Mayar... , Maynard... ...from Fair Lawn, please meet Jill in front of the stage. George has a slight problem. He broke his arm. Oh, it's on Forty-second Street. Tiny Tim used to sing there. Did you know that? Under the name of Robert, uh, Love. Larry Love! Could I get the picture, too? Oh, yes. Toot too, too, too. Tell me, little girl, what's your name? My name is Beth Riley, and what's yours? My name is Hugh. How do you do? My name is Sue. I'll see you around. Ah, here they come, here they come. My name is Hugh Romney. I'm with the Hog Farm. And I'm working on a scene. Some people call it bum trips. I don't think there is such a thing as a bum trip. We're working with hobo voyages. A half an hour after we release anybody from our section... ...we turn them into doctors... ...and they care for people that were tripping like they were when they came in. Now people have been saying that some of this acid is poison. It's not poison, it's just bad acid. It's manufactured poorly. If you can find out who it is, we... Anybody who thinks they've taken some poison, forget it. And if you feel like experimenting, only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you. You know, the Japanese made that motorcycle. The Japanese affected that thing over there... ...with the yellow robes, or the Indian. Really does a lot for the music that motorcycle. Who's on? A guy named Bert Sommers. I think Timmy Hardin is going on next. So the order of everything just went kaplooey? You're closing tonight, honey. Maybe there'll be a few more people here by then. I don't like a puny gathering like this. I'd like to sing you a song that is one of my husband, David's, favorite songs. And let me just tell you that he is fine. And... ...and we're fine too. And David was just shifted from the county jail... ...which is very much of a drag, to Federal prison... ...which is kind of like a big summer camp... ...after you've been in county jail long enough. See I just, just now got a letter. I have it with me. About the trip from the county jail. Manacles on his legs... ...and his arms manacled to his belt. Well, I mean, it's all worth writing about. He doesn't care, you know. And there's only one time that... ...where the first time he felt afraid in the whole thing, was a couple of... ...I guess guards, or something, they started talking very loud. And he started saying... ...talking about the last draft case that they had been through... ...and ""that motherfucker,"" and ""we'll get you, motherfucker,"" you know? He just prayed a little bit harder. He wouldn't do anything anyhow, but it's not a very comfortable feeling. But nothing has happened. Anyway, this is, this is an organizing song. And I'm, I was happy to find out that... ...after David had been in jail for two and a half weeks... ...he already had a very, very good hunger strike... ...going on with forty-two federal prisoners... ...none of whom were draft people. ""I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night..."" ""...alive as you and me."" ""Sez I, 'But Joe, you're ten years dead!""' ""'I never died, ' said he."" ""'The copper bosses killed you, Joe!""' ""'They shot you, Joe, ' says I."" ""'Takes more than guns to kill a man'..."" ""Says Joe, 'I didn't die!""' ""And standing there as big as life..."" ""...and smiling with his eyes."" ""Says Joe, 'What they can never kill,"" ""...went on to organize.""' ""From San Diego up to Maine..."" ""...in every mine and mill..."" ""...where working men defend their rights..."" ""...it's there you find Joe Hill!"" ""Swing low..."" ""...sweet chariot..."" ""...coming to carry me home."" ""Swing low..."" ""...sweet chariot..."" ""...coming for to carry me on home.""

""Well, I went to the boss, said, 'I've got a date.""' ""The boss said, 'No dice, son. You've got to work-a late.""' ""Sometimes, I wonder what I'm going to do."" ""There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."" ""Well, my mom and poppa told me, 'Son, you've got to earn some money...""' ""'... if you want to use the car to go riding next Sunday.""' ""Well, I didn't go to work. I told the boss I was sick."" ""Says they, 'You can't use the car, because you didn't work a lick.""' ""Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do."" ""There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."" ""I'm going to take two weeks, going to have a fine vacation."" ""Going to take my problems to the United Nations."" ""Well, I went to my Congressman. He said..."" ""'... l'd like to help you, son, but you're too young to vote.""' ""Sometimes I wonder what I'm going to do."" ""There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."" Ladies and gentlemen... ...The Who! The word I get is that... ...maybe the best thing for everybody to do... ...unless you have a tent or some place specific to go to... ...just carve yourself out a piece of territory... ...say goodnight to your neighbor... ...and say thank you to yourself for making this the most peaceful... ...most pleasant day anybody has ever had in this kind of music. Well, music is a thing that... Well, you're obviously not here for the girls. Oh, that's good, that's a basic thing, you know, like... ...there are a lot of girls here and they're probably... ...a lot freer than, you know, other places. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of balling. Well, you bring your own coals to Newcastle? Are you two going together or are you just hitching together? We've lived together for about four months, or five months. You know, with a lot of other people. Kind of what you'd call... ...a communal thing, or someone else would call a communal thing. But it's just, we just live together... ...and so we just decided to come down together because we were coming here. And like there's nothing, I mean, no definite thing about... We're not necessarily going to be together throughout the whole thing. So you're not particularly jealous of him? Are you two going together? But you two came up here together. You like that? Yeah, I like her. I love her. I enjoy her. What do you think about all this? Well, the way I look at it... ...like I've known Jerry for what? Four or five, six months now. When he moved into the family group... ...that I was alr... that I already knew for quite a while... ...in that time, I got to know him real well and I learned to love him. Like, you know, we ball and everything, but... ...it's really a pretty good thing because I have plenty, there's plenty of freedom. Because if we're not going together and we're not in love or anything like that... Can you communicate with your parents? I can communicate with them on, on one level. Now that I've been away from home for two years. But at first it was very rough. Now... ...they, you know, they're beginning to mellow about it. It's not so hard on them I'm the way I am. But I can't really communicate to them... ...about anything that's really important because they just could not understand it. My mother is really, she really... ...lives in a lot of pain... ...because she's sure I'm going to go to hell and there's nothing I can do... ...to tell her that there is, that it just does not exist for me. So I, there's no communication on, on those levels. My father was asking whether I was in a communist training camp or something... ...in, in the house that I lived in. I could understand, you know, where he came from. Because when he... ...well, he's an immigrant, you know. And so he came over here to better himself... ...economically and so forth, and all that other rot. And, to make it better for me and he can't understand why I didn't play, you know... ...saying, ""Why aren't you playing the game?"" ""Here's all this opportunity. Here's, here are all these things... ...which have so much value."" But they only have value to him... ...and he can't understand why they don't have value to me. But he does have wisdom enough to know, to allow me to be who I am. I guess he had some kind of idea in his head that... ...I will, by doing what I'm doing, learn for myself how to live. And that's what he wants me to do, anyway. So he, he can't understand why I am the way I am... ...but he, he very much wants me to be that way. Because he knows that's the only thing for me. He started his trip when he was four years old. Really? Nothing to do with drugs or anything? Me, neither. Do you think that's a cop-out or...? I, I don't know. I, I used to be into drugs and... ...I was very heavy on drugs, but... ...now it seems like it's almost contrived. It's like drugs and revolution and the united front and all. You know, I'm a human being and that's all I want to be. And I don't... ...I don't want to have a mass change... ...because a mass change only brings around mass insanity. I just want to be myself and find out, find a place where I can... ...maintain some kind of balance within myself, you know. I'm kind of like the Hamlet trip, you know. To be or not to be. Do you think you could ever communicate with a guy like Nixon or Westmoreland? I hope so. They're doing their thing, aren't they? I don't know. It's like they, they're neurotic or psychotic or... ...having fun as they say in Life Mag... I don't know. They could say the same thing of you. Yeah, right. But it's not true, because, I, I don't need all that power, you know. Where I can just, I can just sit here right on this roadside... ...and I, I don't have to become President of the United States. And I don't have to go all that way up. I don't have to make the climb. Because there's nothing to climb for. It's all sitting right here. Do you have tickets to this thing? No. How are you going to get in? I don't really know. I figured, you know, once I got here... ...l'd see whatever happens and go along with it. It's like people that are nowhere are coming here... ...because there are people they think are somewhere... ...so everybody is really looking for, you know, for some kind of answer. Where there isn't one. Why would three hundred thousand... ...or a hundred and twenty thousand sixty thousand... ...seventy thousand people come to anything just because it's music? I mean, was music all that important? I don't really think so. People don't know, they don't know how to live and they don't know what to do... ...and they think that if they... ...can come here they can find out. You know, what it is... ...or how to maintain with it. It's just like people are very lost, I think. America leads the whole world in several ways. Very recently, when I was in the East... ...the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi... ...met me and asked me... ...what's happening in America? And I said, ""America is becoming a whole."" ""America is helping everybody..."" ""...in the material field..."" ""...but the time has come for America to help the whole world..."" ""...with spirituality, also."" ""At the hop..."" ""...we can rock to and fro and never let go, at the hop, hop, hop."" ""When the records are playing, people eat a lot of chicken..."" ""...at the hop, hop, hop."" ""If you've got a little chicken, share it with your baby, at the hop, hop, hop."" ""Oh, baby, hop! Let's go to the hop. Oh, baby, let's go to the hop."" ""Oh, baby, let's go to the hop! Oh, baby, let's go to the Hop!"" ""Well, let us go now. Let's go to the hop. Let's go to the hop, oh, baby!"" ""Let's go to the hop, oh, baby. Let's go to the hop."" ""Go, go, let's go to the hop! Let's go, go!"" ""We will go rocking and rolling and stomping at the hop!"" ""When the records are playing and the women start a-singing at the hop!"" ""Oh, let's go now. Let's go to the hop! "" ""Let's go to the hop, oh baby. Let's got to the hop, oh baby."" ""Come on, let's go to the hop. Hop!"" Ladies and gentlemen, the Sha-Na-Na! Harold, turn up the mike. Now, very slowly, start coming back up. Lower the lock and pull yourself back up. And then keep breathing as fast as you can. Then exhale. And relax. Then just feel the energy. These, these are all beginning exercises of Kundalini Yoga. Yoga means union. It's the same energy force that drugs give you with a rush. Right? It's, it's the same channels... ...only drugs do it for you and this way you can do it yourself. You can do it when you want to... ...and you don't have to score to be able to do it. All you've got to score is some clean air. I learned it in Los Angeles. And there was only a couple of months of clean air when I was learning it. That's hard, too, these days. But while there's still some clean air left, it would be groovy to... ...experiment with it like those guys who have been experimenting for... ...at least six thousand years and getting very high behind it. The Kundalini nerve, it's called the nerve of awareness. You can't dissect it. It's a current that runs up the center of your spine. I don't know if any of you have ever sat down... ...and crossed your legs and smoked DMT and watched what happens. But what happens to me is this big thing... ...goes ""uuurrrah"" up my spine! And flashes in my brain! Well apparently, that's what is going to happen if I do this stuff and learn it. It takes years, I guess, but this is the beginning of it. These exercises are exercises to create... ...those channels in your body and to free your body of blocks. The major block is your solar plexus. That's why we're doing a lot of breath of fire. It loosens the solar plexus. And there are blocks in your spine and... ...back and wherever you've got blocks, to keep that energy from flowing. Go within yourself and meditate on each breath. Make each breath a complete breath. And if you do it right, you'll be flashing momentarily. Just keep up, concentrate on your breathing and hold that position. Roll your toes forward so they point forward. We're going to leave you with the usual thing. Only thing I can say, as I said to so many people, this title, just about... ...puts it all into focus. It's called ""With A Little Help From My Friends."" Remember it. ""What would you do if I sang out of tune..."" ""...would you stand up and walk out on me?"" ""Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song."" ""I will try not to sing out of tune, yes."" ""Oh, I'll get by..."" ""...with a little help from my friends."" ""Well, I never come up alive."" ""Hey, there are so many ways."" ""Well, I'm going back there for my friends."" ""What do I do when my love is away?"" ""Does it worry you to be alone?"" ""Ho, no, no."" ""How do I feel at the end of the day?"" ""Are you sad because you're on your own?"" ""I'll tell, never say it any more."" ""Going to get a little help from my friends."" ""I've got to buy favors for them."" ""Don't bother about the love I gave."" ""Help me find my way."" ""Do you need anybody?"" ""Oh, I need someone to love."" ""Could it be anybody?"" ""Oh, I need somebody..."" ""...to dream about. I know her."" ""Oh, I love her."" ""Well, I'm going there, I'm going there."" ""Then I'm going to say that I'll know my way."" ""Don't you know I care for my friends?"" ""Would you believe in a love at first sight?"" ""I'm sure that it happens all the time."" ""You know it does."" ""What do you see when you turn out the light?"" ""I don't see nothing."" ""I told you I get a lift, I've got to have a lift from my friends."" ""Nobody cares the way I feel now."" ""Oh, I sat there all alone."" ""Do you need anybody?"" ""Oh, Lord, I don't need anybody."" ""Could it be that you're lonely?"" ""Oh, Lord, I love her. I'll stand by."" ""Going to dream about her, I know I am."" ""Somebody said, 'Oh, I love her'."" ""I've got to get my friends, I've got to get my friends to go..."" ""Don't you know I said, there before your eyes...?"" ""...l've got to get my friends together."" ""All I've got to do is that now."" ""I'm going to take them home with me now."" ""You've got to get all your friends now."" ""...you've got to get all your friends now."" ""Nobody goes away..."" ""...nobody goes away, yeah."" ""You've got your friends, you've got your friends..."" ""...you've got your friends, yeah."" ""With a little help from my friends."" ""Got to have love from my friends."" The Grease Band and myself thank you all very much, indeed. See you again! Beautiful! It looks like we're going to get a little bit of rain, so you better cover up. If it does and if we should have any slight power problems... ...just cool it out. We'll sit here with you. It will be okay. All right, everybody, just sit down, wrap yourself up. We're going to have to ride it out. Hold on to your neighbor, man. Please get off those towers! We don't need any extra weight on them! Please move away from the towers. The lamps might give us a problem. Everybody who is in the back, please move back. We have to get away from these towers. Please move away from the towers! Put the mike stands down on the floor. Cover all the equipment. Let's keep it nice and cool. We'll be back with Country Joe in just a second as soon as we get set up. Okay, so come on down off the towers. Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain! Yeah. Please move away from the towers. Jody, get off the stage. The wind is blowing this way. Please be on this side of the towers. Everyone in the back, please move back. Just take it calm and easy. I see it. Please move away from the towers. I think the wind has run through it. It is okay? Give us some room. Go slowly, but move back. It will be cool. Just move away from those towers! We don't want one of those lamps to be blown. Please! That's it. Everybody just help get away from the towers and clear them. And look up, very seriously. Let's think hard to get rid of it, please. No rain! No rain! No rain! Keep thinking it! Keep your eyes on those towers. It's going to blow through. Try and keep yourselves comfortable. And keep an eye on the towers. Hey, cut the power off up there, all right? What do you want? We're going to have to turn off some microphones for a minute. Hang in there with us. God bless you and watch those towers. Let me get down with the mike. Oh, can I talk to you a minute? Sure. What do you want to know? Do you like the rain? Yes, yes. It's nice. It, it gets you clean. What are you thinking about? Does, is this encouraging, or what? Definitely not. It's great! Just a little added attraction, that's all. You, at least, you don't have to wait for clothes to get dry. Groovy! I dig it! I dig it! Do you think it's coming off well with all those fuck-ups, or what? Yes. The only, the only hassle is the mud, that's all. Does this discourage you at all? Or is it all right? Mud. A drag! I can't believe it! Do you feel discouraged at all, or is this all right? It's a bummer! It's fine. Peace, brother! I've got something to say. I want to know how come the Fascist pigs have been seeding the clouds? Right! For the last hour and a half. Going over twice with that, with all... ...with all the smoke coming out of them, seeding the clouds. I want to know, know why that stuff is going down there. And why doesn't the media report that stuff to the people? You want to talk about what's happened? I'm telling you these planes... ...come over an hour and a half and they seeded all the clouds. This is the second time they did it today! I don't know what they hope to prove, man. What's going on here? Sharon Silverstein, return home immediately. Your father has been taken for open heart surgery. Please stop at the information booth right away. The first Aquarian Exposition. The forecast for this afternoon is... ...intermittent entertainment between intermittent showers. Somebody was saying this is the second largest city in New York. There's been no police. There's been no trouble. If you check the statistics out... ...you'll find that... ...these people have lived, over three hundred thousand people... ...have lived together peacefully, loving each other... ...feeling for each other, want, needing for each other... ...and wanting to make this the experience it is. What are they doing? They're dropping dry, they're dropping flowers and dry clothes. Out of that helicopter? You said a moment ago that this wasn't the end of this festival... ...that this was a beginning. What do you mean, a beginning? Well, well, look at it! This is the beginning of this kind of thing. This culture and generation, away from the old culture and the older generation. And you see how they function on their own. Without cops, without guns, without clubs, without hassle. Everybody pulls together and everybody helps each other and it works. It's been working since we got here. And it's going to continue working. And no matter what happens when they go back to the city, this thing happened. And it proves that it can happen. That's what it's all about, you know. That's the whole thing right there. Mr. Kornfeld, was, was this a suc... , a financial success? From the point of view of the fellows that put it on? It was a financial disaster! Why do you say that? Well, we just opened the gates and let everybody in. It's a free festival... ...paid for by the people who put up the money... ...or the people that are going to have to pay it back? Uh, paid for by the people who bought the tickets. The two hundred thousand, of which I don't know how many of them got here. No, this was paid for by, by all the people that bought it. By all the people... ...that had the thought that put it to the point, to get us in a position... ...to just be a tool, like, like a vehicle... ...like everybody else. Just to get it to this point. You're in the red? Oh? The company? Financially? If you tried to think in those terms... ...when you're talking about something like this... ...financially, this is a disaster. But you, you, you look so happy! I'm very happy! You can't buy that for anything! Sure, this is really beautiful, man! These people are communicating with each other. That, that rarely happens anywhere anymore. It has nothing to do with money. It has nothing to do with tangible things. You have to realize the turnabout... ...that I've gone through in the last, in the last three days. In the last three million years that I, meaning us, all of us... What do you mean, the turnabout in the last three days? Just to see, just to really realize, what's really important. The fact that, that if we can all live together and be happy... ...if you have to be afraid to walk out in the street... ...if you have to be afraid to smile at somebody... ...what kind of a way is that to go through this life? Marijuana! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Waters, Country Joe and The Fish! Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We're certainly delighted to be here today. I'd like to start off my portion of the show... ...by giving you a taste of a little something we call... ...rock and soul music. ""Oh, your love is like a rainbow..."" ""...your love is like a rainbow, darling. Now..."" ""...your love is like a rainbow, I said..."" ""...your love is like a rainbow, all around my shoulders, yeah..."" ""...performing all around my shoulders."" ""You know that your love is like a rainbow..."" ""...falling all around my shoulders. And I said I love you..."" ""...you know I do!"" A lot of freaks!

""Could we ever feel much finer?"" Folk music has come a long way hasn't it, Arlo? It used to be the walk down the road trip, you know. It's incredible. I heard the New York Throughway is closed. This morning we heard they were backed down... ...on Route Seventeen with an eight hour delay! Right. Well, the New York State Throughway is closed. It's incredible! Isn't that far out? I don't know if you, I don't know how many... ...of you can dig how many people there are, man! Like I was rapping to the fuzz. Huh, can you dig it? Man there are supposed to be a million and a half people here by tonight! Can you dig that? New York State Throughway is closed, man! Yeah, it's far out, man! Hey, man, I've just got to say... ...that you people... ...have got to be the strongest bunch of people I ever saw. Three days, man, three days! We just love you! Tell them who we are. They'll know if you just sing. Test. Forty-nine. Sixty-five. Hike! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome with us Crosby, Stills and Nash! ""It's getting to the point...""

Alright friends, now you have seen the heavy groups... ...now you will see morning maniac music. Believe me. It's a new dawn. The regular guys. Don't you get a dial tone, or anything? Yeah, there are some toilets around here, some of those rolling outhouses... ...like they had in Newport. You ask for somebody that doesn't exist... ...and then they don't accept the charges and they know you're okay. You cheat the telephone company. Oh, yeah. I'm fine, man. We don't take the car. We walk. It's the only way to get there. Why? Because my mother wants to make sure I'm all right. I'm going to call my mother and father because... ...oh, they think this is going to be like another Chicago. Like I'm going to get my head beaten in. They're terrified. So I'm going to call and tell them... ...""Ha-ha, I fooled you. I'm alive!"" They've got, they've, you don't even have to bother bringing your tickets... ...or anything, because they're not going to collect them. There's no way they can. They've got a fence that's half up... ...and there are people just sitting in that field. It's really beautiful. I'll try. It's like I say, really, you know how crowded it is here. It, it's just swarming! What? Out, out on the ground. It was nice. We got wet. All I miss is the bathtub. Okay. Goodbye. I didn't even finish dialing and they said... It's so great in some ways and so lousy in others. Look at the people you're meeting. Everybody is here for one purpose. It's ridiculous! It's getting worse every time. There is no water. No water, no food and no medical supplies. Why don't we pray for rain? They're telling everybody to go home. They called it a disaster area. Oh, that's rot! They called this a disaster? You should see, everybody's happy! Who are you calling? My mother. Somebody may have noticed, or all of you may have noticed... ...a familiar colored helicopter over there. The United States Army has lent us some medical teams... ...and giving us a hand. They're with us, man. They are not against us. They're here to give us all a hand and help us. And for that they deserve it. There are forty-five doctors or more. I know at least forty-five... ...who are here without pay because they dig what this is into. Look, it's acid and shit like that. One kid died, a heroin overdose. Yeah, another guy died. Run over, I believe. The army is really doing a great job, you know. All those guys calling them pigs and shit like that, it's not right. They've done a good job. Dr. Jack Maitland, please, with full suturing equipment... ...your presence is requested. You've got a delivery to make! Marilyn Cohen. Wherever you are, Marilyn Cohen... ...Greg wants you to meet him at the information booth... ...because he wants to marry you! There goes Marilyn! About how long does it take to...? Well, before it was backed up, eight hours. And they've been working at it and there are still some cats... ...that think they can come here for Sunday. And they're stopping them in Monticello and all that, you know... ...so it's really getting to be a mess. So, you know what I would do? I would wait, because this way... There's no gas in the gas stations. Because this is the third largest city in the world. So I would wait, you know? Until when? Until this traffic starts clearing up. You know, like Monday morning. I've got to be in North Carolina Monday morning. Oh, wow! Do you? Why? A job? Well, like what? This has been declared a disaster area. Because I called long distance to Buffalo... ...and asked some cats there and they said... ...it definitely has been declared a disaster area. Is there any way to get out? They're trying to evacuate it today. So maybe late tonight, you know. You know, like one. How are they going to evacuate? We're not sure. I think they're trying to get all the cats in the cars... ...and just direct the cars to get out. I mean, you can try it. I mean, like it's all up to you, man. But if your car gets, you know... Yeah, if you run out of gas somewhere, there's no gas in the stations. You're screwed. Yeah, I mean, like you'd be even more stuck on the highway... ...than you are here, because... ...at least here there are a lot of other cats. I have to get out of here because there are just too many people! And I can't leave because my friends will be lost. And I can't, I can't stay here any more. It's too crowded! We are only taking drastic emergencies. Nobody worries. Nobody up here has any money. You could live and eat here a week without money, so don't worry about it. I know, but I've got to go back to California. You can get a ride to California, too. You know, everybody here, it's the same thing with them, you know. You just have to dig it and live with it. About thirty hours, at least. Thirty hours straight? No naps? Are you on speed? No, I'm not on anything. Blind faith? Blind Faith is a groovy group. You wouldn't believe some of the kids that come in here. They're really spaced out. Last night, this cat, this cat comes in and says... ...""If anger is red and envy is green, what color is jealousy?"" And I mean he's really spaced out! And you just don't go fucking people's heads up when they're spaced out! So I said, uh, ""Black, right? Because jealousy is poison."" He says, ""Yeah, but it's got to be something else than that."" And I said, ""Green, because after all, jealousy is like envy."" ""Except that envy is over things and jealousy is over people."" ""A lot of people treat other people as, you know, things."" And he says, ""Wow! Groovy!"" And he walks off and I never saw that cat! Another cat comes up and he asks me to tell him about his wild eyes! Did he have wild eyes? He was speeding. Really groovy. And all the people that come up here asking, you know... ...if we can page their freaked out friends. I mean, like right now I'm missing my sister. I lost her. She was on, uh, on mesc. And I lost her during Richie Haven's performance. I've got her tickets home. I haven't seen her since. She's all right. Sure she is. It's just that I'd like to see her so I can get home in time. She's got to be back Monday for Court. Otherwise, you know, I wouldn't care. Otherwise, I'd probably let her hitch home. City McGee... ...please come immediately to backstage right. I understand your wife is having a baby. Congratulations! John Sebastian! This is really a mind fucker of all times, man! I've never seen anything like this, man! It's Newport, right? But they owned it. It was something else! Just love everybody around you, and clean up a little garbage... ...on your way out and everything is going to be all right. And Chip. My man, Chip. Aw, you're doing so well, man. He says to look out for the fence, too, man. You have to look after the fence. Like the, the press can only, can only say bad things unless there ain't no fuck-ups. And it's looking like there ain't going to be any fuck-ups. This is going to work! I'd like to hear a tune about... ...I guess about those discussions I was talking about that... ...small circles of friends around living rooms... ...around pipes, when they weren't selling any papers on the street... ...and we weren't walking around this beautiful green place smoking, and... ...not being afraid. There's a cat, and I really don't even know his name... ...but I remember that Chip said that... ...his old lady just had a baby and that made me think. Wow, it really is a city here! But this is, this is for you and your old lady, man! Whew! That kid is going to be far out! ""Why must every generation think their folks are square?"" ""And no matter where their heads are, they know Moms ain't there."" ""Because I swore when I was small, that I'd remember when..."" ""...I knew what's wrong with them, that I was smaller, then."" ""I determined to remember all the cardinal rules..."" ""...like sun-showers are legal grounds for skipping school."" ""I know I have forgotten maybe one or two..."" ""...but I hope that I recall them all before the baby is due."" ""And I know he'll have a question or two..."" ""...like, 'Hey, Pop, can I go ride my zoom..."" ""...that goes two hundred miles an hour..."" ""...suspended on balloons?""' ""'And I can put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue..."" ""...and imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs?""' ""And I must be permissive..."" ""...understanding the younger generation..."" ""...and then I'll know that all I've learned..."" ""...and then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid..."" ""...then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid assumes..."" ""...and all my deepest worries must be his cartoons..."" ""...and still I'll try to tell him all the things I've done..."" ""...relating to what he can do when he becomes a man..."" ""...and still he'll stick his fingers in the fan..."" ""...and, 'Hey, Pop, my girl friend is only three..."" ""...she's got her own bitty phone and she's taking LSD..."" ""...and now that we're best friends, she wants to give a taste to me.""' ""'But what's the matter, Daddy? How come you look so mean?""' ""'Could it be that you can't live up to your dreams?""' No, it's not true, because we're doing it! I love you. Goodbye. Ladies and gentlemen, John Sebastian! Give me an ""F""! Give me a ""U""! Give me a ""C""! Give me a ""K""! What does that spell? Fuck! Sing it! More! More! Country Joe! Sir? You live here? I sure as hell do! Do you mind if we ask you a few questions? I'm right here to answer them. Have you been affected by this festival at all? In any way? What? We lost all of our milk. We're just trying to put together a film, to show what the whole picture was like. You know, from all sides. How do you feel about it? Do you want me to explain in plain English? A shitty mess! Tell me, in what way? No bathrooms. Our hundred fifty acres. Gone, that's all. And we didn't rent to them. They all trespassed, every one! Clarence, first tell me where you want this to go. Can I ask you a question? Is it okay if we use your telephone? Oh, we have none. It's out. This is a disaster area. We don't even have a phone. It's been out since yesterday morning. Water? Water I can give you. And I'm sorry the phone has been out, I had an emergency call. It's a disgraceful mess, if you want to know the answer! What, specifically, has happened to you? My fields are all cut up. Our second cutting of hay is going. Our cows, the milk truck didn't get here. The milk had to be thrown out. May I ask you how much money you made on this, uh, four days? I have no, no conception. Did you make five thousand dollars? have no idea. It's too private a question? It's, it's not only too private, I didn't even have a chance... ...to total up the amount of purchases we made... ...the amount of money we took in. We just, uh, haphazardly sent it to our home... ...and had it locked up until we had a chance to sit down and count it... ...which would probably be in about, uh, two to three days. Would you like to see it again next...? I'd love to see it again! You'd love to see it, though? I can't say the farmers would. Well, it, it's, it's a matter of opinion. What are your feelings about the garbage? Where there are people, there is garbage. You, you can't stop, stop progress. Saturday night we got word over WVOS that... ...a lot of kids in town didn't have anything to eat. Word went out that everybody should contribute food. We went over to the park... ...the village permitted them to camp there. A police car went up the street here with a loud speaker... ...and told the kids to come up there. And we fed them Saturday night and all day Sunday. Excess stuff was taken over to the school and they flew it to the, to the site. How do you feel about them now? Very good. I have a nineteen-year-old myself. He's out on the Coast, and I felt that we've got to give them a fair shake here. If kids are hungry, you've got to feed them. I don't know... ...maybe we ought to put, we ought to put everybody on pot. And those kids were all happy. They were all on pot. Well, whatever it is... It never should have happened. If pot makes them happy and no trouble... ...maybe we ought to put all the adults on pot! You want a fifteen-year-old girl sleeping in the field in a tent? What are you, out of your mind? It never should have happened! Do you feel bad about the kids who were killed in Vietnam? This has nothing to do with... It's the same thing. The same thing. There's no comparison. People get more excited about the kids in Monticello than they do about... Fifteen-year-old kids sleeping in the field? They wanted to. They're all high on pot! Look, maybe if pot made them peaceful, maybe we all should take pot! I was giving them water all along the road here, right up on the bridge... ...and they were not on pot! Very lovely children, believe me. They were selling stuff. There was plenty of stuff there. There's no doubt about it. They had hundreds of kids in that house. If you have four hundred and fifty thousand kids... ...and you've got two or three hundred... ...they were selling these, these blue acid tablets... ...which are bad, and they were selling them. True, but figure the law of averages. If you took 500 adults and brought them together and had plenty of booze... ...you know what would have happened? You didn't see any drunks. That's right. There was no fighting. There was nobody stealing. We had to feed them! What the hell else was there to do? There was nothing else to do! Having a good time? Very nice. The water is nice. We were all sitting on a tree stump over there. And the more people got on it, the lower it got. About a year ago, I wouldn't have believed this was the way to swim... ...but this is the way to swim! It's the way to go all the time, actually. Think that's going to happen? It's got to happen! You go walking down the street where all the cars were coming in... ...and it's just the first day, and it was just beautiful! Everybody is free. Everybody is talking. Everybody is really nude. I don't think, uh, people come here to get uptight. They come here to dig what's going on. And even if they don't get into a festival, it's just a groove... ...being with all the people. You know, you realize all over the country, they're coming together. You realize that you're not the only people in your city... ...who are doing the things you are, but they're everywhere. We're taking over! I think the body is beautiful. I think skinny dipping is just beautiful if, if you want to do it, if you can do it. Some people can't, because all their... ...their environment made them, you know, feel that it's wrong. Even though they know in their subconscious that it's right... ...it's kind of normal and natural, but we've been made to feel that it's wrong. Row, row, row! ""Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream..."" ""...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream."" No, I haven't done this too often before. Get it pointed in the right direction! Well, did I miss any big spots? Your cheekbone. Here? Why don't you tell me something really interesting? I can't, really, standing there with the microphone. Don't worry about it. Don't let it intimidate you. It's just a microphone. I know, but it's very intimidating. Just tell me anything, like anybody you'd like to meet. Oh, wow! I don't know. What did you think about the kids? From what I've heard from outside sources for many years... ...I was very, very much surprised. And I'm very happy to say... ...we think the people of this country should be proud of these kids. Notwithstanding the way they dress or the way they wear their hair. That's their own personal business. But their, their inner workings, their inner selves... ...their, their self-demeanor cannot be questioned. They can't be questioned as good American citizens. That's kind of surprising coming from a cop. I'm not a cop. I'm a Chief of Police. We've got one more tune for you. It's called ""Soul Sacrifice."" Ladies and gentlemen, Santana! ""I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."" ""...take you higher."" ""Baby, baby, baby, light my fire!"" ""I'll take you higher."" ""I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."" ""...take you higher..."" ""...take you higher..."" ""...take you higher!"" ""I wanta, I wanta take you higher!"" ""I wanta, I wanta, wanta take you higher!"" What we would like to do is sing a song together. Now, you see, what usually happens... ...you get a group of people that might sing... ...and for some reasons that are not unknown anymore, they won't do it. Most of us need approval. Most of us need to get approval from our neighbors... ...before we can actually let it all hang down, you dig? But what is happening here... ...is a sing-along. Now, a lot of people don't like to do it... ...because they feel it might be old-fashioned. But you must dig that it is not a fashion in the first place. It is a feeling... ...and if it was good in the past, it's still good. We would like to sing a song called ""Higher""... ...and if we could get everybody to join in, we'd appreciate it. ""Wanta take you higher!"" ""Higher!"" What I want you to do, is say ""higher"" and throw the peace sign up. It will do you no harm. Still again, some people feel that they shouldn't... ...because there are situations where you need approval... ...to get in on something that could be so good. ""I wanta take you higher!"" ""Higher!"" Now, if you'll throw the peace sign up and say ""higher"", get everybody to do it. There's a whole lot of people here and a whole lot of people... ...might not want to do it... ...because they can somehow get around it... ...they feel there are enough people to make up for it... ...and on and on, et cetera. We're going to try higher again, and if we get everybody to join in... ...we'd appreciate it. It will do you no harm. ""Yeah, I wanta take you higher!"" ""Higher!"" ""Way upon a hill, I'll take you higher!"" ""Yeah, I'll take you higher!"" ""Going to take you higher!"" ""Higher!"" How are you out there? You're staying stoned and you've got enough water... ...and you've got a place to sleep, and everything? Good morning. What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand. Now, it's not going to be steak and eggs, or anything... ...but it's going to be good food and we're going to get it to you. It's not just the Hog Farm, either. It's like the Ohio Mountain family and the Pranksters... ...and everybody else that volunteered... ...putting in their time into the free kitchens. In fact, it's everybody. We're all feeding each other. We must be in heaven, man! There's always a little bit of heaven in a disaster area. So, if you want to make it back to your campsites, we'll try and get the food to you. Or if you stay here, we'll try and get the food to you. Now, there's a guy up there, some hamburger guy... ...had his stand burned down last night. But he's still got a little stuff left... ...and for you people that still believe that capitalism isn't that weird... ...you might help him out and buy a couple of hamburgers. Okay, here it comes! Mess call! Good morning. Left side of the audience, stage right here... ...that wants to be fed... ...has got to slowly move it through the forest... ...to the Hog Farm where we've got about seventeen lines going, uh, to serve with. If you start your lines going through the forest, you'll wind up... ...going into a line that will take you right to where all the food is being served. Helen Hayman, to the front. Jim MacLean, please go to the pink and white tent hospital as soon as possible. And kissing builds up your mouth. Richard Moss and Barbara, meet us at the information booth. Cort Ritcher or Greg Hollander, go to the Ferris wheel at twelve o'clock. Greg's sister has his medicine. Okay, Gayle, wow! S, i, r, i, n, c, i, o, n, e... ...meet your daddy-o at the first aid station, near the security office. If you've got food, feed other people. Bugsy, to the pink and white tent. Keep feeding each other. And if you're too tired to chew, pass it on. We have a gentleman with us. It's the gentleman upon whose farm we are. Mr. Max Yasgur! Is this on? I'm a farmer. I don't know... I don't know how to speak to... ...twenty people at one time, let alone a crowd like this! But I think you people have proven something to the world. Not only to the town of Bethel, or Sullivan County, or New York State... ...you've proven something to the world. This is the largest group of people ever assembled in one place. We have had no idea that there would be this size group... ...and because of that you had quite... ...a few inconveniences as far as water and food and so forth. Your producers have done a mammoth job to see that you're taken care of. They would enjoy a vote of thanks. But above that, the important thing that you've proven to the world... ...is that a half a million kids... ...and I call you kids, because I have children that are older than you are... ...a half a million young people can get together... ...and have 3 days of fun and music and have nothing but fun and music. And I, God bless you for it! I see we meet again. ""Purple haze was in my brain."" ""Lately things don't seem the same."" ""I'm acting funny, but I don't know why."" ""Excuse me while I kiss the sky."" ""Purple haze all around."" ""Don't know if I'm coming up or down."" ""Am I happy or in misery?"" ""Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me."" ""Help me, baby. Help me, baby!"", Come on! Hit 'im! Hit 'im! You're waltzin'. Give the sucker some action. You're fightin' like a bum. Want some advice? Water!

How you doin', Moby Dick? You miss me today or what, huh? Huh? Here you go. Say hi. If you could sing or dance, I wouldn't be doin' this, you know? And this turtle food I got here, it's... This turtle food, gotta add more flies in. There are more moths in it. More flies... More moths... Who the hell cares? How you feelin' this mornin'? Full of life? - Fine. - Hey, how you doin', killer? - How's the turtle food this week? - Fine. - Me, I'm kinda aggravated, you know? - Oh, I'm sorry. - Ain't your fault. Wanna hear about it? - I'll tell you somebody who don't. How you doin', Gloria? The last turtle food I got here had more moths in it than flies. The moths get caught in the turtles' throats. They cough and I smack 'em on the back of the shell. What do you think they get? And they get what, huh? Come on... Shell-shocked. They get shell-shocked. - Startin' with the bad jokes early, huh? - Inventin' jokes ain't so easy sometimes. That wasn't a joke. How's my buddy doin' today? Yo, Butkus! - I ain't had time to check 'im. - Yo, Butkus! Adrian, I want you to go downstairs and clean all the cat cages. They're a mess. You gotta pay for that turtle food, Rock-head.

Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob, you understand? Gimme some money. Gimme some money. Come on. - There's 130 here. - That's it. I'm broke. Hey, Bob. Hey, hey. You're still $70 light. You don't have to break nothin'. Here, take my coat. It's worth 50, 60 dollars. Here, take the coat. Take the coat! - Be smart. - You shoulda planned ahead, you know? - You shoulda planned ahead. - I'll tape up the hand! - You shoulda planned ahead. - Gazzo won't have to know! He won't be wise to nothin'. Gazzo won't be wise to nothin'! He won't... He only had 130, but I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr Gazzo. Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it. That's it for today. Tomorrow collect from Del Rio. - He's late three weeks and I don't like it. - Tomorrow, three weeks, Del Rio. I got it. How do you spell Del Rio? - How'd you do last night? - Real good. - Hey, did you get the licence number? - Of what? - The truck that run over your face. - Relax, buddy. Pull it over here. I wanna let Rocky out, then I'm gonna talk to him. How come you didn't break his thumb? - How do you know I didn't? - I hear things. - Did I give you a job this mornin'? - Yeah. So why didn't you break his thumb? When you don't do what I tell you to do, you make me look bad, Rock. I figured... Look, if I break the guy's thumb, he gets laid off, right? He can't... Well, let me do the figurin', OK, Rock? From here on, just let me do the figurin'. These guys think we're runnin' a charity and they're gonna get off light. From here on in, do what I tell you to do, because it's bad for my reputation, you understand? You got it, Rock? I got it. Hey, how do you spell Del Rio? - Look in a dictionary, Rock! - Come on! Hey, I won't let that happen no more - about the thumb. You know? So long, meatbag. I shoulda broke your thumbs! - I heard you did real good last night. - Absolutely. You shoulda seen me. - You oughta take a rest. - No, my back is hurtin'. - Your back? - My back is hurtin'. You deaf? No, I'm short. Hey, yo, Mike. Where's my lock? Whose stuff is this in my locker? It's Dipper's stuff. It ain't your locker no more. What you talkin' about? It's been my locker for six years. Where's my gear? Mickey told me to bag it and hang it. You put my stuff on skid row? I been in that locker for six years and you put my stuff on skid row? Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it. - Where is he? - He's outside, working with Dipper. - He's in a bad mood. - So am I. Put your hands up there. That's right. Keep your hands up. That's right. - Hey, Mick. - Shut up! Attaboy! Time! Time! - What the hell? What do you want? - How you feelin' today? - What are you, a doctor or somethin'? - You got problems today? - Never mind my problem. What's yours? - I've been talkin' to Michael. - How come I been put outta my locker? - Because Dipper needed it. Dipper's a contender, a climber. Know what you are? - What? - A tomato. Yeah, let's face it. I run a business here, not a goddamn soup kitchen. - Did you fight last night? - Yeah. - Did you win? - Yeah, I won KO in the second. - Yeah? Who'd you fight? - Spider Rico. He's a bum! - You think everybody I fight is a bum. - Well, ain't they? You got heart, but you fight like a goddamn ape. Nothin' special about you. You never got your nose busted. Leave it that way, and what's left of your mind. Mick, I think I'll go take a steam. You know why? I did real good last night. You shoulda seen me. - Big deal. - You shoulda seen me too. Hey, kid, you ever think about retiring? - No. - You think about it. - All right. Time! - Hey, hey! - What? - I dig your locker, man. Cold night. Good night to catch pneumonia, you know? You need some help with that cage? There's a good game down at the Spectrum tonight. You wanna go to a basketball game? Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid. Tough day today. They took my locker away. I had that locker for six years, but it don't bother me. Lockers are bad. People get the combination. I must've had 20 bucks taken outta there in the past six years. It don't sound like much, but it adds up. You know? It doesn't matter. Who cares? Cold night... Hey, birds! Hey, look who's here! Look who's here. The giant worm. Look at these birds. Don't these birds look like candy? Like flyin' candy. Want to fly me home? Do you need somebody to walk you home, you know? No. It's a cold night. If I was you and you got the money, I would take a cab. Too many creeps around here, you know? Every other block there's a creep. You can always tell a creep. All right, listen. I'm gonna go now. I'll see ya's later, all right? Now you guys get up. I know you had a hard day in the cage. So... I wanna go home, make up a joke. I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow, OK? - Good night, Adrian. - Good night, Rocky. Yo! There you go. I got a friend for you here. - Hello, Rock. - How you doin'? You seen Paulie? He's in the steam room. - Hey, Rocky, what's with the eye? - Been fightin'. - Hope ya's won it, at least. - I did real good. You shoulda seen me. - Hey, Rock, who'd you fight? - Spider Rico. - Hey, is he still around? - Yeah, he's doin' real good. He's doin' better than you are, that's for sure! Hey, Paulie, you lock the door? I'd like to kill the moron who broke the mirror. Hey, yo, Paulie! Every day, every night I pass by. Your sister's givin' me the shoulder. - Forget her. You could do better than her. - I don't forget nothin'. Every night, I pass by the place, I tell a joke. Every mornin', I tell a joke. Nothin'. She just looks at me, you know? - Looks, huh? - Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers. I need a Cadillac to connect with your sister? Somethin' wrong with my face? She's a freakin' loser. Sometimes she gets me so crazy, - I could split her head with a razor. - Don't get mental, man. - You caught me in a bad mood. - You always are. - Adrian ain't sharp. Adrian is a loser. - Hey! She's pushin' 30 years old and if she don't watch out she'll end up dyin' alone. - I'm 30 myself. - And you'll end up dyin' alone. - I don't see no crowd around you. - I'll kill the moron who broke the mirror. Come on, let's get outta this stink, would ya? Come on. - I wanna talk to you, anyway. - About what? - Do you still work for Gazzo? - Yeah, sure. Why don't you talk to him about me? Well, I just don't think Gazzo's hirin' right now, you know? Come on. - The girl's dryin' up. - Who? My sister. If she don't start livin', her body's gonna dry up. You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving. Come over and talk to her. - Sure. Beer! - Tomorrow you come for some bird. Absolutely. You got it. I gotta go. If I'm late, she calls the hospital. - Paulie! - I got it. ... with Mac Lee Green here in Philadelphia at the fabulous Spectrum. You're speakin' of your Bicentennial fight. The greatest sportin' event in the country's history. A gala occurrence. - I'll beat him like he committed a crime. - Would you take a look at that guy? Where are the real fighters gonna come from, the pros? All we got today are jig clowns. - Clown? - That's right, clown. In keeping with great events in our history, I will duplicate the cracking of the Liberty Bell by cracking Mac Lee Green. - You callin' Apollo Creed a clown? - Well, what else? Look at him. Stay in school and use your brain. Be a doctor, be a lawyer, carry a leather briefcase. Forget sports as a profession. Sports make you grunt and smell. - Be a thinker, not a stinker. - OK, thanks a lot, champ. Are you crazy? He's champion of the world. He took his best shot at becoming champ. What shot did you ever take? Hey, Rocky, if you're not happy with your life, that's nice. But I got a business goin'. I don't have to take no shots. ... no one having gone more than 12 rounds with him, and that was Jake... - Stick that up your business. - What are you so insulted about? You want me to take a shot? All right, I'll take a shot! - Hey, Rocky, how about a bottom? - No wine, man. Come on! Just a little. You're makin' a lot of money. Marie, does your brother know you're out? - Screw you, yo-yo! - These guys teach you to talk like that? - Stuff it, man! - Don't you say that to me. Come here! Stick up on it! Swivel on it, ya bum! Hey, you know, when I was your age there was one girl in the neighbourhood who talked like that, you know? Just one. What you doin'? That'll make your teeth yellow. - I like yellow teeth. - And your breath like garbage. - Maybe I like garbage. - C'mon, nobody likes garbage. Anyway, this girl wasn't bad-looking, but guys never took her serious, you see? - They never took her out for a date. - Why? Guys laugh when you talk dirty. They think you're cute. If you get a reputation, you get no respect, you understand? You get no respect. I gotta use a bad word. Whore. You understand? Whore. You see, if you use dirty words, you maybe end up becomin' a whore. - Come on, Rocky. I'm 12. - Hey, that don't matter you're 12. You don't really have to be one. You just act like one, and that's it - boom! You get a bad rep, you understand? 20 years from now, people are gonna say ""Do you remember Marie?"" ""No, who was she?"" ""The whore that hung down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."" ""Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."" You see, they don't remember you. They remember the rep, you understand? Hey, you got a boyfriend? No, you ain't got a boyfriend. You know why? Why don't you? Because you hang out with them coconuts on the corner. You hang around with coconuts, you get nowhere. They're lemons! Hang out with nice people, you get nice friends. Hang out with smart people, you get smart friends. Hang out with yo-yo people, you get yo-yo friends. It's simple mathematics. I hope you ain't gonna... - I won't. - What was I gonna say? You hope I stop actin' like a whore or I'll turn into one. - Somethin' like that. - Night, Rocky. - Night, Marie. Take care. - Hey, Rocky. - Yo? - Screw you, creepo! Yeah, who are you to give advice, creepo? Who are you? - Are the doctor's reports confirmed? - Definitely. It says that Green has suffered a severely cracked third metacarpal in his left hand. We can cancel the fight indefinitely if you're set on fighting Green. Hey, it ain't just Green! What about all the time Apollo has invested? - I believe we can find a solution. - Solution nothin'. Find me another contender in a flash, Jergens. Don't play games with my client. He's done a million dollars' worth of publicity and has made contractual obligations. - He's not going to be embarrassed! - I contacted Ernie Roman's manager. - Ernie is fighting in France that week. - Buddy Shaw. He's ranked fifth. Went to California and gained 50 pounds. I got hold of every worthwhile contender and they all say five weeks isn't enough time to get into shape. Shape nothin', man! They afraid! They know everybody's gonna see the fight. None of 'em can whip me. They're makin' excuses so they don't get whipped in front of the whole world. All I can say is I'm a good promoter. I've promoted fights in every goddamn country in the world and I've broken my ass over this, but I don't know what the hell else to do. I do. Without a ranked contender, what this fight is gonna need is a novelty. This is the land of opportunity, right? So Apollo Creed on January 1 gives a local underdog fighter an opportunity. A snow-white underdog. And I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me. And I'll tell you why. Because I'm sentimental, like a lot of other people in this country. There's nothing they'd like better than to see Apollo Creed give a local boy a shot at the world title on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it. And that's the way it's gonna be. Apollo, I like it! It's very American. No, Jergens. It's very smart. - What is it? - I just wanna check this out. I pick up two yards from Snyder and a grand from Cappoli? No, no. Two yards from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder. - Two yards. Yeah, I got it. - OK, write it down, OK? Who's this girl you're goin' out with tomorrow night? - How d'you know? - Don't you think I hear things? - A lot of canaries flyin' around the docks. - I'm goin' out with Paulie's sister. - I hear she's retarded. - She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know? I'll tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo. I hear retards like the zoo. - This bum gotta say that? - You callin' me a bum? - I'm callin' you a bum! - OK, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood. - It's his prostate. - He's always in a bad mood. Count your blessings, Buddy. You're still healthy. - I don't like your face. - I don't like yours! - Kiss my ass! - Move! Relax! Relax! Relax! My ears! What, are you drivin' me crazy? Both of ya's. Buddy doesn't like ya. Some guys, they just hate for no reason, you got me? - Yeah. - Come here. There's 50 bucks. You and Adrian, you have a nice time. Thanks. - Hey, how'd you know her name? - You don't think I hear things? - Remember what I told you. - What'd you tell me? Take her to the zoo! - Some more coffee, Mr Creed? - No thanks, Shirley. - What do you think about Billy Snow? - Fouls. - How about Big Chuck Smith? - Yeah. No, he's too old and dull. Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy. - No, I don't feel the heat from that name. - Joe Zack's a good prospect. Exactly what are you lookin' for, Apollo? This is what I'm lookin' for. The Italian Stallion. Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him. Look, it's the name, man. The Italian Stallion. The media'll eat it up. Now who discovered America? An Italian, right? What would be better than to get it on with a descendant? He's a southpaw. I don't want you messin' with them. - They do everything backwards. - Southpaw nothin'! I'll drop him in three. ""Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion."" Sounds like a damn monster movie! What are you doin' with that bat? I used to be deadly at stickball. - You sure your sister knows I'm comin'? - Very excited. Look at my swollen hands. The joints, from carrying meat in and out of freezers. - Plays hell on the joints. - Maybe you oughta see a doctor. I don't need a doctor. I need a different job. - What kind of turkey? Big or small? - Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me. I'd make a great collector. Bustin' bones don't bother me. A big turkey, right? Hey, forget Gazzo. That's a bad job, you know what I mean? - You got a match? - Go to him for me, as a favour. Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey, it was when they had a $2 special at Horn AND Hardart's about three years ago. - Your sister knows I'm comin', for sure? - Yeah, she's gonna be excited. Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh? - I don't ask nobody twice. - You don't ask nobody twice. ~ Stay away, baby - You sure your sister knows I'm comin'? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very excited. Paulie! You're late. You called the hospital? She calls the hospital if I'm ten minutes late. Yo, how you doin'? I told you she's very excited. Why didn't you say you were bringin' him? - Look at me. I'm not ready. - Would it make a difference if you were? - He's a friend and he's takin' you out. - No, I can't. I want you outta the kitchen and I want you out right now. I won't. Hey! Hey! Hey, I want you outta here instamatically! I'm sick of seein' you hangin' around like a spider! Go out and live! Enjoy life! - Paulie, I can't go! - Don't get wise with me now. - I'm tired of you bein' a loser. - Don't call me that, Paulie! Apollo Creed is shopping for another ""victim"" to fill Green's vacancy for the Bicentennial championship fight... You didn't tell me you were bringin' him home! I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go! I won't go! Why? Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I got a turkey in the oven. Oh. A turkey in the oven? You want the bird? Go in the alley and eat the bird! Oh, Paulie! I want you outta here! Get outta the house! Go out and enjoy your freakin' life! You hungry, Rock? Hey, yo, Paulie. Maybe we'd just better forget all this, you know? - Just forget it. - Forget nothin'. Say somethin' funny. Ain't nothin' to say. She's in a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood... You know how to do funny. Wanna go out with her? - Yeah. - Well... - I don't know what to say. - Funny. Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky. Rocky, you know? Listen... I dunno what to say, cos I ain't never talked to no door before, you know? - I mean, what do I say to a door? Listen... - Come on, you're doin' fine. I ain't doin' fine. I look like an idiot. Keep doin' what you're doin'. Funny. I know all about these things. I feel like a jerk. Yo, Adrian. It's Rocky again, you know? Listen... I know you ain't too happy at this moment. Well, could you do me a favour? I ain't got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with. So how about maybe you and I could go out together and get somethin' to eat? I don't know, maybe laugh a little bit. Who knows? Would you like to... I don't know. Would you like to maybe, you know, you and me go out together? We're gonna have a good time. We'll have a real good time, you know? Thanks for the bird. I'm gonna turn the TV off. I got a headache. - What's your sister like to do? - Ice-skate. Adrian, come on, you're lettin' the heat out. Who pays the bills around here? Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway, you know? - But it was Thanksgiving. - It was what? - It was Thanksgiving. - Yeah, to you, but to me it's Thursday. - Yo, looks kinda quiet. - I think it's closed. No, I think we're just early or somethin' like that. - Yo! - Yo! - We're closed! - What? - I said we're closed! - Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna smooth this guy out. Wait here for a few minutes. - We could go someplace else. - No, it's OK. Are you closed to the general public or closed to everybody? It's after six o'clock. It's Thanksgiving. That's why there's nobody here. Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here, so do me a favour and leave, huh? - Could you do me a favour? - Hey, come on, we're not operatin'. Look, this girl here ain't feelin' well. The doctor says she should exercise and ice-skating's the best thing. - Yeah? So what do you want from me? - Do me a favour. She ain't feelin' good. So if you could let her on the ice, I'd appreciate it. - Ten minutes, ten bucks. - Ten bucks? How about eight bucks? Come on! It's Thanksgiving. - All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal. - You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks. Gimme the blades. - Aren't you skating? - No, I ain't skated since I was 15. That's when I started fightin'. - Skating's bad for the ankles, you know? - Yeah. You're a pretty good skater, ain't ya? Like I was sayin' on the way over, fightin' used to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to do was prove I was no bum, that I had the stuff to make a good pro. - You never got the chance? - I ain't cryin', cos I still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby. The trouble is, I'm a southpaw. - What's a southpaw? - It means you're left-handed. A southpaw throws your timin' off, see? Other guys, it makes 'em look awkward. Nobody wants to look awkward. - You know where southpaw came from? - Nine minutes! A long time ago, a couple of hundred years ago, this guy was fightin'. I think it was around Philadelphia. He was left-handed. His arm was facin' towards New Jersey. And that's south, so they called him Southpaw. You see? Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden, Southpaw... You know what I mean? Things worked out for the best. You never got a chance, being left-handed? Well, that's absolutely true, you know? Watch out, watch out. I just dislocated my finger. Agh! Look at that. No, hey, wait! It ain't your fault. Look. See? Look. It's an old wound. You see that? Look. See? Nothin'. It bends like that. I originally done it... Push the button... Bong! It works. - It ain't your fault. I'll show you... - Seven minutes! I originally done it... I keep pictures of all my fights. I done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See? He's the size of an airplane. I broke both my hands. I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture, don't you think? See how it works there? Come on. Are you havin' a good time? I'll tell ya, you can see I ain't too graceful. I don't move well. But I can really swat, you know? I can really hit hard. But I'm a southpaw and nobody wants to fight a southpaw, you know what I mean? Whooo! You know how I got started in fightin'? - Huh? - No. Am I talkin' too loud? - No. - Three minutes! My father, he's... My old man, he was never too smart. He says to me ""You weren't born much of a brain, so start usin' your body."" So I've become a fighter. You know what I mean? Why are you laughin'? My mother, she said the opposite thing. What did she say? What did she say, the opposite? ""You weren't born much of a body, so you'd better develop your brain."" - Did she say that? - Yo! Time! - Can I ask you a question? - Absolutely. - Why do you wanna fight? - Cos I can't sing or dance. Hey, yo! Don't fall! Don't fall! Hey, that was terrific. I'm good at this. You like the way I skate? The last fight I had was with a guy named Spider Rico. He bust my head up. Do you see that scar? I'll tell ya, things get pretty rough in the ring. You know, some people are very shy by nature, you know? I suppose. I say you're very shy by nature, you know? Yeah... I suppose. Hey! Hey! The bum from the dock. Get a job, ya bum! You know, some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me none. It don't bother me, either. Why did I bother bringin' it up? Cos I'm dumb, that's why. I think we make a real sharp couple of coconuts. I'm dumb, you're shy. I don't understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter. Hey, you gotta be a moron. You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what I mean? It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum. - I don't think you're a bum. - I'm at least half a bum, you know? I'll tell ya somethin'. The worst thing about fightin' is the mornin' after, you know? I'll tell ya. The mornin' after a fight, you're nothin' but a large wound, you know? Sometimes I got pains all over me. I wanna call a taxi to take me from the bed into the bathroom. Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face is all busted up, your hands is swollen. Look at this face. 64 fights. Look at that nose. See that nose? That nose ain't been broken in 64 fights. I've had guys bustin' on it, chewin' on it, twistin' it, punchin' it. I mean, whack, boom. These guys are hittin' my nose all the time. Never broke. I'm proud of that. Ain't that rare? That's rare. - Why do you do it if it hurts? - Why you think? - Cos you can't sing or dance? - Yeah, somethin' like that. Hey, you wanna come inside? - No, I gotta go. - Hey, come on. I got some animals. I got these very rare animals inside. Come on. Come on in. - No, no. I gotta go. - I gotta go too. I gotta go to the bathroom. - Go on. - No, I gotta go. Hey, look at this face. Is that a face you could trust? Huh? Is it? They oughta stick this face on a stamp. What do you think? Huh? Come on. Come on in. Yo. Flick. - Yo, Adrian, you hungry? - No. I got some things in there. I got soda, some doughnuts or somethin'. A couple of cupcakes, huh? No? I think I got some chocolate in there. No? Hot in here, you know? I could go for some music. Yo, Adrian. These are the exotic animals I told you about. - These are my friends Cuff and Link. - I sold 'em to ya. Sure, I know you sold 'em to me. You were workin' at that pet shop. First day you was there, I bought both these animals. Sure, I remember that. I bought this bowl and I bought the animals themselves, the food, the marbles that go on the bottom there. Remember that mountain? I had to get rid of it, cos they kept fallin' over and flippin'. Yo, why don't you come on over here and sit down? It's a nice couch. I don't know... There's big bugs in there, you know? It's safer over here. You wanna sit down? Are these your parents? Yeah, that's both of 'em there. - Is this you? - Yeah, that's me when I was eight. That's the Italian Stallion when he was a baby. Why don't you come on over and make yourself comfortable? Relax. - Do you have a phone? - No, I ain't got no phone. I had it pulled, cos of people callin' all the time. Who needs the aggravation, right? The interruptions. - Who do you wanna call? - I wanna let my brother know where I am. Why? - I think he might be worried. - Well, I'll call him, if that's the problem. Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me! I'll call ya's back later! See ya! You don't like the room, do ya? - It's fine. - Well, it's only temporary, you know? It's not that. What's the problem? You don't like me? Or the turtles? What's the problem? - I don't think I belong here. - It's OK. I don't belong here. Well, you know, it's OK, cos you're my guest, you know? I don't know you well enough. I've never been in a man's apartment alone. Well, I have. They're all the same, you know? I'm not sure I know you well enough. I don't feel comfortable. Yo, Adrian, you know, I ain't so comfortable either. - I should go. - Don't go, please. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. - Do me a favour? - What? Take off these glasses. You have nice eyes, you know? Do me another favour? Would you take off that hat? I always knew you was pretty. - Don't tease me. - I'm not teasin' ya. I ain't teasin' ya. I just... I wanna kiss ya. You don't have to kiss me back if you don't want, but I wanna kiss you. I heard you had a fight comin' up. Yeah, I'm gonna fight next month, January 27th. That's good, man. You come on down the gym. We'll see that you get in shape. Hey, Rock, how you doin'? - Mick was lookin' for you up there, man. - For me? You sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was lookin' for you. Get on up there and see him. - You got somethin' for me? - A guy from Miles Jergens was here. - They need sparrin' partners for Creed. - When was he here? - About an hour ago. - Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners. I said that before, you dumb dago! I've been comin' here for six years and you always stick it to me. How come? - You don't wanna know! - Yeah, I wanna know how come! - You wanna know? - I wanna know! OK, I'm gonna tell ya! Cos you had the talent to become a good fighter! And instead of that, you became a leg-breaker to some cheap, second-rate loan shark! - It's a livin'. - It's a waste of life! Yes? May I help you? Oh! You must be Mr Rocky Balboa. Mr Jergens is expecting you. Just a moment. Mr Rocky Balboa to see you, sir. Fine. - Please go in, Mr Balboa. - Can I have that? - Oh, certainly. - Thanks. Mr Balboa. How are you? George Jergens. Take a chair, please. Thanks. - Mr Balboa... - You can call me Rocky. Rocky. Tell me, Rocky. You got any representation? You have a manager? Uh, no, just me. Rocky, I've got a proposition I'd like to make to you. - About sparrin'? - I beg your pardon? I know you're lookin' for sparrin' partners and I wanna say I'm very available. - I'm sure you are. - Absolutely. It would be an honour. And you know what? I wouldn't take no cheap shots. - I'd really be a good sparrin' partner. - You don't understand me, Rocky. My proposition's this. Would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the world heavyweight championship? - No. - Listen, Rocky, Apollo's seen you fight. He likes you. He wants to fight you. Well, it's just that, you see, I fight in clubs, you know? I'm really a ham and egger. This guy is the best. It wouldn't be such a good fight. But thank you very much, you know? I appreciate it. Rocky, do you believe that America is the land of opportunity? Yeah. Apollo Creed does. And he's gonna prove it to the world by giving an unknown a shot at the title. And that unknown is you. He picked you, Rocky. Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime. You can't pass it by. What do ya say? All right. That's enough pictures. We wanna ask Apollo a few questions. How do you like the city of brotherly love? Well, just bein' in Philadelphia makes me feel patriotic. Beautiful people in a beautiful city wishin' me the best. I love my Philadelphia brothers. I'm proud to be an American. Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man who has virtually no chance of winning? Look, if history proves one thing... American history proves that everybody's got a chance to win. Didn't you guys ever hear of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill? It is a coincidence that you're fighting a white man on the most celebrated day in US history? I don't know. Is it a coincidence that he's fightin' a black man on the same day? Right on! Tell the truth, brother! How do you feel about your challenger? How do I feel about him? Come here, Rock. - My main man. Rocky, ain't you Italian? - Yeah, I'm Italian. - Well now, what does that mean? - If he can't fight, I bet he can cook! - Do me a favour. His lungs, punch out. - Paulie! Rocky, how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed? Well, jeez, Creed's the best. I guess I'll have to do the best I can. Tell me, Rocky. Just between us, where did you get the name ""Italian Stallion""? Oh, I invented that about eight years ago when I was eatin' dinner. Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000. Any comment? - You got no comment, Rocky, right? - No. No comment, right. Wait a minute. I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, OK? Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky. Look at this. Can you believe all this? Rocky, you didn't! - Thank you, Rocky. - Quit pushin', man! Thank you, Rocky. Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool? I'd break his lips. - He's takin' cheap shots. - It don't bother me none. Yo, Rock. I guess you'd be lookin' for people to help you out. - Help what? - You know... - Keep you livin' a clean life. - I do OK, you know? You need someone to help with the exercise, stand by with a towel, run errands. Who cared about me yesterday? Nobody. I think I'm gonna train myself, you know? Without such good people around to help, you don't have such a good chance. Einstein flunked outta school. Twice. - That so? - Yeah. Beethoven was deaf, Helen Keller was blind. I think Rocky's got a good chance. - Want me to get you a beer, Paulie? - You lookin' to do a good deed? Keep outta my freakin' life! - What did I do? - Nothin'. - Did I say something? - You didn't say nothin'. That's right, you didn't say nothin'! Nothin' at all! I gotta go. Where's the freakin' pretzels? Goddamn the pretzels! Hey, we don't have any beer! I thought you were supposed to pick up some beer! How'd you like hearin' your name on TV tonight? I was shocked. Why'd you do that? - Come on, you're puttin' me on, right? - Absolutely. - What time should I expect you? - Oh, about seven. Hey. Hey. You know I said that stuff on TV didn't bother me none? Yeah? It did. Listen, the reason I've brought you here is because... Have you got money for trainin' expenses? - I got a few dollars, you know? - Well, here. Put this in your glove. - What's this? - 500 bucks. Don't worry about it. You ain't never had any luck, but this time Lady Luck may be in your corner. - What do ya think? - Maybe. Maybe... - Hey, thanks for the money, Tony. - It's OK. Don't worry about it. See ya. - Wait a minute. - What? - You're in trainin'. Huh? Come on. - Hey. - Yo, Tony? - What? You gonna show up at the fight? - Ringside. - Hey, hey! I'll see ya. Yeah! Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. Good! Hey, this is a nice place here. Anyway, what I come to tell you is that... ...that what happened to you is freak luck. - Yeah, freak luck. - Ain't it true? Look at the other guys. They're good fighters. They're colourful, they got good records. They fight their guts out for peanuts. But you... you got a shot at the title. - Freak luck is a strange thing. - Yeah, sure it is. Can I sit down? Yeah, sure. - What the hell are those? - Oh, they're domestic turtles. The one on top is Cuff and the other is Link. The rest are marbles. Yeah? They make good soup, do they? Anyway, look, I'm here to warn ya that you gotta be very careful about this shot that you got at the title. Because, I don't know, like the Bible says, you ain't gonna get a second chance. - Yeah, all right. - You thought of that, huh? Well, what you need is a manager. A manager. Listen to me. I know, because I've been in this racket for 50 years. - 50 years, huh? - 50 years. God, I've seen it all. All of it. You know what I done? - What? - I have done it all. You shoulda seen me when I knocked Giny Russel outta the ring. Outta the goddamn ring, I tell ya. September 14, 1923. And it was the same night that Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring. - The same night. Who gets the publicity? - Dempsey. - That's right, but why? - Cos he was champ. No! Because he had a manager. I had nothin', man. I wanna show you somethin'. Look at my face for a minute. Look. I got 21 stitches over this left eye. I got 34 stitches over this eye. You know what? I had my nose busted 17 times. The last time was with that fight with Sailor Mike. I got the clippin' here. A good fight. Read that. Well, it doesn't matter. Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear. Ah, Rocky Marciano! You know, you kinda remind me of the Rock, do you know that? - You really think so? - That's right. You move like him. And you got heart, like he did. Yeah, I got heart, but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick? Anyway, you know, when I begun in this business, kid... Look, I wanna make a suggestion. Don't drink that piss before a fight. It's no good for ya. You don't mind my sayin'? Anyway, when I started this racket, pugs like us, we was treated like dogs. For $10, you gotta tear somebody's throat out. But I never had no management. One time, this son of a bitch that I fought, he put a nail right there. - In his thumb? - Yeah, in the glove. And he punched so many holes in my face, I had this spit shootin' outta my cheeks. Can you imagine that? When I tell you what I looked like when I was in my prime... I want ya to look at somethin'. Will ya look at that? That's the way I looked before these guys got at me. That's nice. You don't take care of the picture, though. Well, I never had no management. That was the trouble. Now I got all this knowledge. I got it up here and I wanna give it to you. I wanna take care of you. I wanna make sure all this shit that happened to me doesn't happen to you. You know what I mean? - The fight's set. - Listen to me. I wanna be your manager. - You follow that, do you? - The fight's set. I don't need no manager. But you can't buy what I'm gonna give ya. I've got pain and I've got experience. I got pain and I got experience too. - Now listen, kid... - Hey, yo. Hey, Mick. I needed your help about ten years ago. You never helped me none. - You didn't care. - Well, if you wanted help... I say, if you wanted help, why didn't you just ask me, kid? Look, I asked, but you never heard nothin'! Well, I... I... I'm 76 years old. And... Ah, shit. Took you long enough to get here. Ten years to come to my house. What's the matter? You don't like my house? My house stink? That's right. It stinks! I didn't ask no favours from you! Don't throw it around! Talkin' about your prime. What about my prime, Mick? At least you had a prime! I ain't had no prime! I ain't had nothin'! Legs are goin', everything's goin'! Guy offers me a fight. Big deal! Wanna fight the fight? Yeah, I'll fight the big fight. I'm gonna go and fight that big fight. I'm gonna get that! I'm gonna get that! And you wanna be ringside and see it? Do ya? You wanna help me out? Huh? Do you wanna see me get my face kicked in? Legs ain't workin', nothing's workin'! They go ""Go on, fight the champ!"" Yeah, I'll fight him. Get my face kicked in. You come around here! You wanna move in with me? Come on in! It's a nice house! Real nice! Come on in and move! It stinks! This whole place stinks! You wanna help me out? Well, help me out! Come on! Help me out! I'm standin' here! It's 28 degrees. We'll check that forecast in a minute. I feel very weird. Very... Well, the thing is I got vinyl seats in my car. When I hit the seats this morning, I just went ""Whoo!"" I figured if I'm up, everybody in the Delaware Valley should be up. Do you agree? At three minutes past four, what else are you gonna do? - Hello? - Mrs Kramer! This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia. - How are you this morning? - Huh? What? I think you have a lot of nerve callin' me at this hour in the morning! Goodbye! ~ WYBG ~ Philadelphia Ha! We got Mrs Kramer up and it's a good morning. Boy, I need somethin' to struggle with. 28 - it's cold out there. We've been getting away with murder for weeks. Our high today could be 30. Tonight we're back down in the 20 range, colder in the suburbs. And tomorrow, with a little bit of luck, we may hit 40 somewhere. But it's awfully chilly. Make sure you have it bundled up before you bring it out. Come on. It stinks... Hey, come on! It stinks in here, you know? Yeah, I know. Hey, do you kill all these things? No, across the street. This place looks like an animal morgue, you know? - It's a little cold in here, ain't it? - Yeah. Who killed all these things? - What, are you crazy? - Pay Gazzo or you end up on a hook. Hey, Gazzo's a good man. You know that. Hey, don't get excited. I know that. That's why I want you to talk to him about me. I can get me out of this stinkin' freezer. Why don't you do yourself a favour? Keep this job, because you eat better. Moo... Does it ever snow in here? You and my sister. How are you gettin' along together? How you think? I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story? - About what? - What's the story? What's happening? - You really like her? - Sure I like her. I don't see it. What's the attraction? I don't know. It fills gaps, I guess. - What's ""gaps""? - I don't know. She's got gaps, I got gaps. Together we fill gaps. I don't know... You ballin' her? Hey! Hey, you don't talk dirty about your sister. You screwin' my sister? You see? That's why I can't connect you with Gazzo, Paulie. Because you got a big mouth, you know? You just talk too much. - It's gettin' cold in here. I'm goin' home. - Cold in here?! It is cold in here! It stinks in here! And you stink! You're breakin' the ribs. If you do that to Apollo Creed, they'll put us in jail for murder. I'll see you tomorrow mornin', OK? - I turned the heat up. - Thanks. You know, your brother's a good man, but he's awful pushy, you know? - You want me to rub you down? - No, I'm just sore, OK? I'll just sit here. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Hey, come on. No foolin' around, all right? I'm tired. Hey, Adrian, I'm serious now. There's no foolin' around durin' trainin'. I wanna stay strong. - You're not kiddin'. - No, I ain't kiddin'. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Why don't you just make the meat, OK? OK, I'll make the meat. Yo. - It's OK. - I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, c'mon. C'mon. Underneath. Underneath. Underneath! Underneath! Come on! Rock, hold it, hold it. Hold it, Rock, will ya? You're drivin' me crazy, you're so sloppy. You're off balance. Let's try this. Take this string. Tie it to both ankles. Leave two feet of slack. - I ain't never had good footwork. - Never mind. You're off balance. Marciano... He had the same problem and this string cured it. The idea is that if you can move and hit without breakin' the string, you got balance. You become a dangerous person. You follow? - You're lookin' good, Rock. - Thanks. That's it. Underneath! Hey, Rock, how about an autograph? Get outta here! Don't you ever interrupt me while I'm conductin' business. Move your little chicken asses out. Listen, kid. You... You lay off that pet-shop dame. Women weaken legs. - Yeah, but I really like this girl... - Then let her train ya! - OK, no more foolin' around. - OK, now hit it. Women weaken legs, huh? - Yo, Rock! - Yo, Rocky! Yo! - Yo! - Yo, you look great. - Really? - Oh, yeah. Terrific. I mean, you're gonna be a heartbreaker. You'll walk down the street, breakin' hearts. Very sharp. - I got another surprise for you. - What? Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus, gimme a kiss! Come here! To keep you company when you run. Come and meet the family. The owner never come back? - He's yours if you want him. - Boy, do I want him! - What's he eat, this dog? - He eats little turtles. Yo, Butkus! What's that, Butkus, huh? Whose truck is this? C'mon. One call from me, you're a celebrity. - You need exposure. - Don't breathe on me, Paulie. That's the big time... I know about these things. - What do these guys want from me, huh? - To watch you train. Hey, what is the matter with you? This is private. - I'm doin' you a favour. - No, you're embarrassin' me in front of everybody, in front of your sister. You see this cigar? Stick it in your ear. Don't do these things to me. You shoulda called me up or somethin'. Leave a message. Don't do that! My sister really likes you. - I'm gonna kill you one of these days! - Come on, come on. - Pretty... - Baby. Here he is, the next heavyweight champion of the world, Rocky Balboa! Rocky Balboa, we wanna get a brief interview in with you. - What about me? - What about you? - In charge of the meat. - Stand behind it. Listen, just settle down. Just relax. What we're going to do is ask you a few questions about your unique training method. Talk to the folks at home. They wanna know how you got into this. This isn't an everyday thing. Jimmy, you guys ready? Rocky, turn around here. - Just don't take no cheap shots. - No, I won't do that. Just relax. Today we're here with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa. The reason... Hey, freak guy's stickin' his face in. Let's try it again, Rocky. Today we're with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa. The reason we're in this refrigerated box is that Mr Balboa has an unusual method of training. In a moment, he's going to demonstrate that for viewers at home. But first, Rocky, how did you come to train in an icebox? Well, my friend, the guy over there, he let me in one day. I hit the beef and I kinda liked it. Since I've become a challenger, the owner don't mind neither. Is this a common training method? Do other fighters pound raw meat? - No, I think I invented it. - Would you give us a demonstration? And be sure to fly my barber to Philly. How much is going to West Coast advertising? - Make it 450. Send the mayor's wife 200 roses and make sure we get a picture for the newspapers. Do you want to run 15 radio spots in the Midwest? You could spend better in Canadian publicity. Either way, I've got friends in Toronto who could get you good tax breaks. George, I like your friends. Hey, champ, you oughta come and look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV. - Looks like he means business. - Yeah, I mean business too. - Hey, Shirley, we got any more coffee? - Certainly, Mr Creed. I'll get you some. Diana Lewis, in the meat house, with southpaw Rocky Balboa. - He called the reporters? - It threw my trainin' schedule off. Don't be mad at him. He's tryin' to help. Adrian, I ain't mad. It's just that when reporters are around, I get out of joint. They take cheap shots. Paulie knows that. Paulie keeps askin' me for a job all the time, but he don't know nothin' about fightin'. Are you gonna say anything to him? What's to say? I just don't know what he wants from me. I don't want nothin' from you. I don't want nothin' from you. This ain't no charity case. Get outta my house! It's not just your house. He's no friend no more. Get outta my house, I just said. - Don't talk to him like that. - Both of ya, get outta my house! Yo, it's cold outside, Paulie. I don't want ya messin' her. I don't raise ya to go with this scumball! Yeah?! C'mon! You wanna hit on me? C'mon! I'll break both your arms, so they don't work for ya! I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo? That's what I think of Gazzo! Now you're a big-shot fighter on your way up, you don't even throw me a crumb! When I go and get you meat every mornin'! I even give you my sister, too! - Only a pig would say that! - I'm a pig? A pig gets you the best? I'm a loser! I don't get married because of you! You can't live by yourself! I put you two together, and you... don't you ever forget it! You owe me! - You owe me! - What do I owe you? You're supposed to be good to me. What do I owe you, Paulie? What do I owe ya? I treat you good. I cook for you, I clean for you, I pick up your dirty clothes! I take care of you, Paulie! I don't owe you nothin'! And you made me feel like a loser! I'm not a loser! - You're busted! - What?! You're not a virgin! You let a man take down your pants! She's busted! I can't haul meat no more. You want a roommate? Absolutely. OK, now when you walk into the ring with the No.1 heavyweight of the world, you'll be ready, won't ya? Why? Because I've waited for 50 years to make ya ready. You'll be able to spit nails, kid. Like the guy says, you're gonna eat lightning and you're gonna crap thunder! You're gonna become a very dangerous person. - Yo, Mickey! - Hey! Oh, Rock. I want ya to meet our cut man here, Al Salvani. - Take a look at his eye, kid. - How you doin', Al? - Not bad. I've seen worse. - You ain't so bad yourself. - Cover up. Things'll be OK. - You cover up. - Go and take a shower, will ya? - OK, Mick. I'll see ya's tomorrow. - Hey, you covered that Whitmore fight. - That's why he won. Listen, we got a winner here. We got a chance. He goes to the body like nobody you've ever seen. You just stand by for him. We're gonna win. Hey, Rocky. It's OK I talk to ya? OK you talk to me? Sure. I figured an angle to make money off your name. My name? How's that? Advertising. I know about that stuff. What do you know about advertising? Huh? Hey, you can make money off my name, make it, OK? I'm gonna take a shower. - Hey, wanna help me off with these? - Sure. ~ Trying hard now ~ It's so hard now ~ Trying hard now You're gonna kill him! ~ Feeling strong now ~ Won't be long now ~ Getting strong now ~ Gonna fly now ~ Flying high now ~ Gonna fly ~ Fly ~ Fly Rocky. What brings you here tonight? Mr Jergens, the poster's wrong. - What do you mean? - I'm wearin' white pants with a red stripe. It doesn't really matter, does it? I'm sure you're gonna give us a great show. Try to get some rest, kid. Good night. I can't do it. What? I can't beat him. Apollo? Yeah. I been out there, walking around, thinkin'. I mean, who am I kiddin'? I ain't even in the guy's league. What are we gonna do? I don't know. You worked so hard. Yeah, it don't matter, cos I was nobody before. Don't say that. Come on, Adrian. It's true. I was nobody. But that don't matter either, you know? Cos I was thinkin'... It really don't matter if I lose this fight. It really don't matter if this guy opens my head either. Cos all I wanna do is go the distance. Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed. And if I can go that distance and that bell rings and I'm still standin', I'm gonna know for the first time in my life, see, that I weren't just another bum from the neighbourhood. Time, kid. Let's go. I'll wait for you here. Well, how about I wait here and you fight, you know? You're lookin' very great today. You know that? Mm? I gotta go now, but don't you leave town, huh? Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it. Good luck. Say, Adrian, you don't think this robe is too baggy, you know? - Good luck. - Don't leave town. I'd like you to meet the man working the fight with me, Stu Nahan. Thank you, Bill Baldwin. The electricity is all over the place tonight... What the hell is that? I trained you to be a fighter, not a billboard. - I'm doin' it for a friend. - What do you get out of it? - Paulie gets three grand, I get the robe. - Shrewd. On tonight's fight, their difference in style, a recent magazine said it could be the caveman against the cavalier. The buzzing in the background could be the challenger getting into the ring. - Rocky! Look at me! Ya cost me $200. - Oh. I gotta go. I gotta work. - How's the robe? - A little baggy. A 50-1 underdog, a Cinderella story, and he's captured people's imaginations all over the world. We love you, Rocky! - Yo, champ! - Hey, thanks for showin' up. His record: 44 victories - 38 by knockout. And he's lost 20 fights. Which makes me wonder, can he stand it? The stamina and the skill to last the three rounds? Las Vegas odds say no. Rocky Balboa climbing into the ring now. The Italian Stallion. Some meat sign on the back of his robe there. See that? ""Shamrock Meat Company."" There's a lot of noise. You could go deaf with that noise! Am I seeing right back there? Is that the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed? He's riding in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so. He's got the hat on. Look at that. Well, it's been confirmed. The world champion Apollo Creed is doing an imitation of George Washington. He's throwing money. Remember when we talked about George Washington throwing a dollar? Of course, throwing a dollar in those days went a lot farther. The white wig came off, the hat came off... I want all of you! And the crowd is loving every minute of it. Here is the world heavyweight champion. For you around the world, he was dressed as George Washington. I want all of you! Come on, Stallion! - Uncle Sam himself... - I want all of you! - All of you! I want all of you! - He looks like a big flag. I want you! You! - Is he talkin' to me? - He is. - Is he talkin' to me? - Let him talk. I want the Stallion! Come on! He says ""I want the Stallion!"" In foreign countries during World War I there was a picture of Uncle Sam with his finger pointed - a recruiting poster for our fellows in the army and the navy. ""I want you!"" That's what he's doing a take on. - That's it. ""Creed"" he's yelling. - ""Creed in three."" What do you think that outfit cost? Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. A very happy new year. Welcome to Philadelphia. Everybody who's anybody is here tonight. Time does not permit me to introduce the many luminaries of politics, show business and the sporting world who are with us tonight. But I would like to present one of the immortals of pugilism, a champion in and out of the ring. Philadelphia's own Smokin' Joe, the beloved Mr Joe Frazier! Hi, how are you doing? Don't hurt him, OK? What a credit he's been in his career as a fighter. He's coming over to talk with the champ. - Hey, Joe! - You been dumpin' me long time. You next, Joe! You next, Joe! They must be friends. Joe Frazier! Fight fans around the world, get settled down, because it won't be long now. And now for the main event! On my left, the challenger. In white trunks, weighing 190lb, Philadelphia's favourite son, the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa! And on my right, wearing red, white and blue, weighing 210lb, undefeated in 46 fights, the Master of Disaster, the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed! I want you! I want you! You, chump! I want you! You've both fought in Philadelphia before. You know the rules. No low blows. Watch your heads. No buttin'. - Shake hands now and come out fightin'. - Put your hands up, chump. Come on! A little body play goin' on there. Rocky taking it carefully, though. He's just going over and being calm, it looks like from here. There goes the big hat. I've never seen a fighter that concerned about his hair! And there's the bell for round one. The fighters come out into the centre of the ring, looking at each other. Creed the champion zipping those left-handed jabs, right in the head. The champ stinging the slower challenger jabs at will. In fact, it looks like Rocky is blocking the blows with his face. The champion doesn't look the best he's ever been, but he's moving smoothly. Well, the champion is smiling now. He's toying with his man. Tryin' to give the fans their money's worth. He's makin' a show of it. And a very badly outclassed challenger right now. Creed trying to make this man make... See? Make him miss like that. Oh, the champ is just taunting him now. Creed dancing around. I don't believe it! The champ is down! Yes, he is! Creed is down! What a surprise this is! This is the first time the champion has ever been knocked down. Six! Seven! Eight! He appears to be all right. Glancin' around... Come on, Rock! Go to the ribs! Let's go to work right now, Rock! Rocky comes back out. He's like a bull in a china closet. He really wants it. Apollo, left to the head. Now the champion's comin' back. He's comin' off the floor now. Another left, another right. Combinations into the face. That's Apollo! Now the champ is taunting Rocky to come and get some more. Left. Another. Another left! And Rocky's coming back now! Left! Right! Rocky's got him on the rope! OK, let's break it. There's no way they expected this kind of hitting power. But the ability of the champion, Apollo, is apparent. Apollo unloading, Rocky really tight against the ropes. They're leading him back over to his corner. Rocky can hardly find his way. - I told ya! I told ya! - Your nose is broke. - How does it look? - It's an improvement. I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'. Stick and move. Go for the ribs. - Don't let that bastard breathe. - The guy's great. He doesn't know it's a damn show. He thinks it's a damn fight. - Finish this bum and let's go home. - Right. Stay to the body! To his right! Here we go. Round two. Creed predicted he would win in three. Creed got knocked down in the first. He came back at the end. Oh, he's working now. Oh, that sharp left! Again, a hard right. He's working Rocky into the corner again. He's got Rocky back in the corner. Pelting him left and right. He's bouncing up against the ring. Oh, Balboa's taking a tremendous beating here. - Battering him like a punching bag. - What's keeping him up? - He says he wants more! - He wants more! You folks in front of your television are watching a battle, I tell you that! Balboa trying to fight back... Ooh, a tremendous hook! The champion is trying to get himself out, but he can't. He is being barraged with lefts and rights to his body! Balboa is smacking the champion right on the kisser! The referee's stepped in. They're ready to keep going! Back to your corner! Come on, Creed! This is gonna be a tough one. Hard left and right combination! What is keeping him up, Bill? I don't know! He can't even get his gloves up to protect himself! Down! Down! Stay down! Apollo dancing around with his arms in the air! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! OK, OK. Come on! Apollo can't believe it! The champion got a left to the ribs, his right ribs. - You OK, champ? - Yeah, I'm OK, I'm OK. I can't see nothin'. I gotta open my eye. Cut me, Mick. - You don't wanna do it. - Go on, cut me. Cut me. - You're bleeding inside. I'm gonna stop it. - You ain't stoppin' nothin', man. You stop this fight, I'll kill ya. The 15th and final round. They look like they've been in a war, these two. The champion really tightening! And Apollo clearly protecting his right side, his ribs. Hard left and right! Look at the blood coming out! Oh, he's spitting out blood now. A tremendous right hand from Rocky! Go for it, Rock! - Listen to this crowd! - Left to the ribs. Right to the chin! He's got him up against the rope! There ain't gonna be no rematch! Don't want one. Rocky, you went the distance, 15 rounds. - How do you feel? - All right. It's all right. - Adrian! Adrian! - What did you think in the 15th round... - Rocky! Rocky! - Ladies and gentlemen, - your attention, please! - Rocky! Rocky! Tonight we have had the privilege of witnessing the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring! Adrian! Rocky! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a split decision! - The judges voted... - Adrian! - Rocky! ...8- 7 for Creed! Your fans want a rematch. - There ain't gonna be one! - Why not? - Come on! I had enough. Adrian! - You heard him. - Let go! That's my friend. Rocko! - He's everybody's friend. - You're breakin' my jacket! - Let's go. - Paulie! - Adrian! Adrian! - Rocky! - Adrian! - Hey, where's your hat? - I love you! I love you. I love you! I love you! I love you! Visiontext subtitles: David Van-Cauter, There were probably no two people on this earth more opposite than each other than myself and Billy Jack, and now that I look back on it, it's hard to believe that the chain of events that that would first bring us so close and then end up in so much tragedy in bloodshed could begin with an early Saturday morning drive by Sheriff Cole over to his deputy's house. Morning, Cole. What brings you out this hour? They found your daughter. Where? Haight-Ashbury again? Yeah. They're flying her in to Phoenix. You want to take my car and go down and get her? When? Now. I can't, damn it. Posner just called and told me to be out at Box Canyon in half an hour. It's illegal for anyone to hunt wild mustang, Mike. Especially a deputy sheriff. You know that. I know. I also know that when Posner says jump a lot of people in this town have to jump, including me. What do you want to do about Barbara? Look, Cole I'll try to get back before she gets here. Hey, Mike? Yeah? How much is the dog food company paying for mustang meat now? Six cents a pound. Why? Nothing. I was wondering if Barbara would think it's worth it. Get the gate! You like the first shot, Mr. Posner? Thanks, Mike. I'll let Bernard have that. Come on now, Bernard. Get your ass out of that truck. Get up there and start shootin'. Please, Dad. You know I can't shoot. I said now! Shoot! Shoot, damn you! I can't. All right, Mike. Start shootin'. I knew he'd find us. Morning, Billy. You're illegally on Indian land. I'm sorry about that. I guess we just got caught up in the chase and crossed over without knowing it. You're a liar. We got the law here, Billy Jack. When policemen break the law then there isn't any law. Just a fight for survival. Mr. Posner, I got no authority on a federal Indian reservation. Drop it or die. On this reservation I am the law, so I'll tell you this just once. Have your men drop their guns and you can leave quietly. You're making a mistake. I've made 'em before. We got him outnumbered, Mr. Posner. You know me, Posner. And you know my meaning. Drop 'em. All the townspeople knew about. Billy Jack was that he was a half-breed, a war hero who hated the war and turned his back on society by returning to the reservation, where he watched over the Indians, the wild horses, and the kids at my school. No one even knew where he lived. Somewhere way back in ancient ruins with an old holy man who who was teaching him secret Indian ways and preparing him for a sacred initiation ceremony. Hiya, sweetie... My first instinct is to beat the hell out of you. You know that, don't you? But it probably wouldn't do any good, now would it? I bet you're hungry. Can I fix you something to eat, Barb? How long since you last eaten? Two days. Two days? No wonder you don't look well. I don't look well because I've got hepatitis and a goddamn abscessed tooth that's killing me. Well, let's call a doctor. You can't call the doctor. He'll make me stay in the hospital. I know, but that's the only way to cure hepatitis. Not because of hepatitis, because of the baby. What baby? The it baby. I'm pregnant. You're what? Pregnant. I've been expecting this. How long? Maybe six weeks. All right. Where's the father? Where's the father? That's funny. I don't even know who the father is. What's that supposed to mean? It means, concerned father, that I was passed around by so many of those phony Maharishi types who kept telling me love is beautiful and all that bullshit. In other words, concerned father, I got balled by so many guys, I don't know if the father is going to be white, Indian, Mexican, or black. Hey. Hey, miss. Hey, come on, wake up. Well, she's a pretty sick girl, but nothing a lot of bed rest won't cure. The question now is what are we going to do with her? Another beating like that and she'll lose that baby. May be the best thing that could happen to her. - Cole! - All right, all right. Billy, anyone see you bring her in here? Why? What do you have in mind? Well we can't take her home, and Posner would protect her father against anything we could do. We sure can't hide her anywhere around town, so... So you want to hide her out at the school? Yeah. At least until she gets well. I ain't going to no damn school. Well, it's either that or go back to your father. Besides, this isn't an ordinary school. It's a very progressive school out on the reservation run by a very remarkable woman. You'll like her. Person hasn't been born I'd like. What is her father going to do when he finds out she's out there? He thinks she ran away. Nobody here is going to tell him any different. Too narrow! Come in much wider! If you want to win, Kit, you've gotta do better than 18 seconds! Gee, I just can't seem to get close enough. Could you show me again? What are they doing? Probably teaching some of the kids how to barrel race. Anything any kid wants to learn, they try to teach it to them here. I told you this was a different kind of school. When I took over this school out here at the reservation, I knew here would be trouble. First because I opened it up to any kid with a problem... Black, white, Indian, Chicano... Who could come any time they wanted, stay as long as they wanted and leave when they wanted. No questions asked. Then people became even more hostile when I announced that there would only be three rules. No drugs, everyone had to carry his own load, and everyone had to get turned on by creating something, anything. Whether it be weaving a blanket, making a film, or doing a painting. Preferably something that made one proud of one's own heritage and past. Or by getting involved in such strange things as yoga meditation. Keep your eyes focused on the third eye point. Or psychodrama and role playing, things that the townspeople could never understand. You guys are my last chance. Do you think you can do anything with her? Sure. Sure. Okay. No problem. Hold it for just a minute, okay? Everybody, this is Barbara. She's going to be working with us for a while, and instead of going through a lot of introduction, why don't we just get to know each other by getting into another scene? Why don't we do one of those role-playing things, where we send her out the room and then she has to come back and figure out who we are. Good Idea. And all you have to do is come into the scene and discover who you are as the scene progresses. I can't. Why not? The reason I'm here is because I'm knocked up. Congratulations. Okay well just do it about her being pregnant, that's all. Great! All right, then let's get it together. I got a good one. How 'bout if the world is really messed up, and it really needs a new savior, and she's going to give birth to it. Agreeing. Okay. Let's rap it out. What happens? Okay, a virgin birth. Okay, a virgin birth. But this is going to be a modern one, it won't have to be, like, the old kind. Okay, let's do it. Let's get in aisles. I'm going to be the Savior... What are you doing? That's beautiful... a black Jesus... so they should crucify Him, and then the rest of us say give us a sign before you die, or give us the answer, or something before you die because He's dying on the cross, and that's when He gives us the sign. What's the sign of the new religion so people will know each other? Carol wrote a new song about her brother, but she's too bashful to sing it. Will you go up and sing it for us? I don't want to. Come on. Don't be so bashful, you sing so well. What's her trip? She's really out of it. She wears three pairs of false eyelashes and thinks the world is Hollywood in the 1940s. She's just not quite right. I guess she doesn't have any place else to go. This whole idea of doing your thing in the mess hall came from a visit somebody made to a Benedictine monastery. And anybody who wants to read or sing or just do anything at all just gets up and does it. Carol has written us a new song about her brother. Two of 'em. I beg your pardon, two of them. Go ahead. When you go through that ceremony to become a brother to the snake, do you let the rattlesnake bite you? Over and over? Could I be your apprentice and help during the purification part? In order to be an apprentice you have to be able to... strip yourself of your greed and and your ego trips in order to let the spirit enter into you. My grandmother is a Kachina. They say the spider woman came and worked through my grandfather. He was a medicine man. You believe in the spirit? One night when I was a boy, one came and left the bow arrows on my bed. Most people think that's a bunch of crap. I don't. What are you so worried about? About the kids going into town tomorrow. Why don't you just tell them that they can't go? - I can't do that. - Why not? Because they have to make their own decisions here, you know that. Do they love each other? Nobody knows. It's funny, isn't it? How everybody in town is afraid of you. But I guess it's a good thing they are, because if they weren't, they'd hurt the school a lot more than they do now. It's an awfully lonely life, though, isn't it? What's going to happen tomorrow is going to happen, and all your worry in the world isn't going to change that, okay? Come on, smile. Okay. Right. Hey, Cole, when are you going to do something about those long-haired weirdoes? Before or after they start to burn their draft cards? He's waiting till some of our kids start going out there and smoking, ain't you, Cole? Nope. As soon as I finished my shine, I'm going outside and shoot three or four of them, show 'em who's boss. Wow! Is that nice! Wow! Is that nice! Was that class? Or was that class! I've seen better. Mr. Stud, himself. He could pick up that chick just like that. Couldn't ya, Bernard? Are you kidding! Of course he could handle her, can't you, Bernard? Just put up the money. Like, say, 50 bucks. Covered. Howdy. My name is Bernard Posner. Really? Really. Is that supposed to mean something? Around these parts, you hear the name Posner quite a bit. That's very interesting. You know, you hear my name quite a bit, Not just around here, either. No fooling. What's your name? Up... Up. That's an odd name. What's your last name? Yours. Up yours! Hey, why isn't everybody going in? They're afraid to go in. Why? Indians aren't allowed in some of the stores here. What do you mean, not allowed? I don't see a sign. Indians don't need a sign. They know damn well when they're not wanted. Then why you going in? 'Cause I like ice cream. Here you go. Thank you. Could we have some ice cream, please? Look we'd like to buy some ice-cream cones. Please! Sorry, I'm all out of cones. You just sold to the kid ahead of us. Look, I told you. I'm all out of cones. You're a liar. You're a smart little punk, aren't you? Hey, hold it, hold it! Come on, you guys. There's no need for all this violence. It's a simple problem, really. Harry look, I know you worked hard to own your own store and you feel you should have a right to serve whoever you want to, right? - Right! - Okay. While little Miss Up Yours here feels if she wants you to serve her non-white friends, you damn well better serve her non-white friends. That doesn't sound like an insurmountable problem. Hey Dinosaur, bring me some of that flour over there. Simple solution is simply to make. Miss Up Yours non-white friends... white. All right, all right. What's the matter, boy, you gonna let the women do your fighting? Come on. Let's get out of here. You know, I'm always suspicious of you pacifist types, that it's just a fancy way of covering up that you're yellow. Please this won't accomplish anything. We'll just leave. No. Our good deeds not done! As for the little one here... Hey! Stop it! There. Now everybody is white. So Harry, why don't you serve all our friends an ice-cream cone? Remember, before you try anything, you're in our territory now! With the sheriff nearby! Bernard, the Sheriff is out at the school. Go get my dad. And have someone get the Sheriff! Bernard, I want you to know that I try. When Jean and the kids at the school tell me that I'm supposed to control my violent temper and be passive and non-violent like they are, I try. I really try. But when I see this girl... of such a beautiful spirit so degraded... and when I see this boy that I love... sprawled out by this big ape, here. And this little girl who is so special to us that we call her God's little gift of sunshine. And I think of the number of years she's gonna have to carry in her memory the savagery of this idiotic moment of yours... I just go... berserk! You hurt? Get in your eyes? A lot of stupid people in this world, aren't there? Sure you're all right? How come you don't smile? You do look kind of funny. You better go. They're going to kill you. You okay? Okay. Don't go out there. Nobody in town is going to help you. Please don't go out there. Big Indian chief. So special. So above the law. You think you can do just as you please. I told you you'd make a mistake and I'd be waiting. Watch his feet, man. He can kill you with his feet. He can do anything he wants with his feet. Do you really think those green beret karate tricks are going to help you against all these boys? Well, it doesn't look like to me like I really have any choice, now does it? That's right. You don't. You know what I think I'm going to do, then, just for the hell of it? Tell me. I'm going to take this right foot... and I'm going to wop you on that side of your face. And you want to know something? There's not a damn thing you're going to be able to do about it. Really? Really. Kill that Indian son of bitch. Johnny. How you doing? Ben, hear you got a new foal out at your place. Howdy, AI. How's that new Olds working out? Pete. Well, I think we've done enough damage for one day, don't you? Mike, take care of Billy Jack. All right, let's everybody go home and take a hot bath. Wait a minute! Aren't you going to press charges? Where would I begin? Please, Martin. Wait until they get back. Billy Jack said you should never practice alone, Martin. You know that. Why don't you two go play in the hay? Stop it, Martin! Please, stop! I better go get Jean. The only thing I can do is put him in a cast for a month or two and see how it mends. Is there anything further we can do? Not for him, but you better do something about her. Why? Well, her father suspects she might be out here, and he'll probably come out here with a search party tomorrow looking for her. Any ideas? At the moment I'm fresh out of them. I want you to know that warrant isn't legal on reservation land. You don't have to let us search unless you want to. Cole, whose side are you on? These people are holding this man's daughter illegally. Hey kids, they don't really have a right to search here, but if it will make them feel like big men, we're going to let them go ahead, okay? To hell with this... Well, one thing is pretty clear Posner, she's not here. I guess that means Billy has taken her off. Don't you think you ought to found out where Billy is? Jean, they want to know where Billy is. Who ever knows where Billy is? Well, you must have some way of getting in touch with him when you need him for emergencies. Whenever we want Billy, we just contact him Indian style. What does that mean? We just want him, and somehow he shows up. How the hell are we going to find Billy on this reservation, much less get Barbara if we do. Jean, this has gone far enough. I think we better find Barbara and forget the whole thing. I honestly don't know where she is. But if you did, you would tell me? You know me better than that. The only way we're going to find Billy is to get one of these kids to tell us where he is. Offer them a reward. I'll back it. Make it $1,000. Kids, can I talk to you a minute? Can I talk to you a minute, please? Please I want to talk to you a minute, goddamn it! Now look, I want my daughter back. She's sick, and she needs help. She has to be home or in a hospital. Can't you damn kids listen a minute? Now look I'll offer $1,000! You can do it anonymously, no questions asked. Don't you damn kids know what you can do with $1,000? You can live in Big Sur for a year! Damn hippie creeps. I'm sorry I got you into all this, Jean. From now on it's going to get very ugly. Think about it for the sake of all these kids. You think about it. Will you tell? Now you know me better than that. In view of the violence of the episode at the ice cream store and in view of the extreme likelihood that more such violence even more severe in nature is liable to erupt at any moment, inflicting serious harm to members of the community as well as students and faculty of the school and in the interest of everyone's safety and the establishment of law and order the board unanimously votes to request the city attorney to seek a court injunction restraining members of the Freedom School from coming into town except on Saturday between the hours of noon and 4:00, and then only in groups of six or less. To the point of this resolution, we're now opening the floor. If you'd care to make a statement or ask a question affecting this matter. My name is Phil Crowder, and I'm a student at the school. He was beat up. All those guys jumped Billy Jack, right? Mr. Chairman... Would you yield? The chair recognizes Doc. I'd like to remind this board this board that the violence at the ice cream parlor was caused by the townspeople and Billy Jack. The students from the school had nothing to with it. There's one man on our council here who agrees with you that it was not the fault of the school. We are there are more than one person... excuse me. Well, Mary... there are a lot of citizens that agree with that. He has the floor... Why don't you take a bath? That's a beautiful statement. If you have something to say, you'll come forward and you'll give your name to the give your name, and make your statement. O.K. Corrales. Respect this meeting enough to give your proper name. My proper name is O.K. Corrales. Do you have something against Mexicans? O.K. wants to speak. Let O.K. speak. Okay, O.K. Do you have anything to say, Mr. Corrales? To speak to the resolution, it opposes not only the spirit but the letter of the constitution, and many state and federal laws. And it's something that you ought to consider before you even bother to sending it to the city attorney. The chair recognizes Mr. Posner! But the door doesn't! Order! Order! Order! The chair recognizes Mr. Posner! I respect what Mr. Corrales said. And our intensions are really parallel with his. We would like to preserve the peace. We would like to see the children unharmed, and we are passing this measure with that intent. We would like not to have violence. So how come your son pours flour all over Indians? Mr. Johnson... When's the last time you cut your hair? When's the last time you brushed your teeth, sir? You're out of order Phil. All right, now I want this meeting run orderly. Chairman by our behavior as this council, we're proving to these students that most of the things they believe about us are true. But they're proving to us that most of the things we fear about them are true. Man, this council sucks. Proceed. A little girl in the school has something she'd like to read. What's your name, young lady? My name is Kit, and her name is Carol, and she has something she'd like to read. How old are you, young lady? Too old for you. Just about old enough for you, I guess. Proceed, young lady. I'd like to read a speech, and after it's done, I'd like you to guess who said it in public. ""The streets of our country are in turmoil."" The universities are filled with students rebelling and rioting. Communists are seeking to destroy our country. Russia is threatening us with their might, and the republic is in danger, yes danger from within and from without. We need law and order. ""Without law and order, our nation cannot survive."" Who wrote it? Well, that's very nice, young lady. Do you want to know who wrote it? Adolf Hitler wrote it in 1932, and everyone from Nixon's cabinet to your council is repeating it today. Now, I'd like to know from this child if she would tell us who told her to read it here? She has her own mind. She can read by herself, you know. I wish she'd answer the question! Nobody told me to read it. I just... Then why did you? I think I have a right to read what I feel like reading. Why did you read it? Were you taught this in school? Because her brain is damaged by the heathen devil-weed, marijuana. Thank you, very kindly. She still has the floor! I have another question for Mr. Posner. Well like this council here is always talking about law and order and things, well, how come he kills stallions, which is against the law? Right on! This is irrelevant and immaterial. I've been sitting here for like over an hour, and I've been listening to you. And all I can see is that you're really scared and you're scared of all of us and you're scared of me. Right on. We're scared of what you can do. I can come into this town but I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to do anything like that. How do I intimidate you? Because, like, I'm another human being. Are you scared of me sexually? What is it? I really want an answer. I'll give you an answer: Because you're a filthy little girl. David! You're out order! You're sick! Every one of you! Go ahead and take a bath! You're out of order! You want to speak? You'll have your opportunity! Order! Order! Hold it! Hold it, everybody is a little crazy. You people think you're free. Why don't we all calm down for a few minutes, and probably the best thing to do would be if you all could come out to the school and see what we do at our natural habitat. This is a fine example of what you do. We've been invited to this council... Chairman! Chairman! This is no more an example of what the school is like than it is for what the town is like, and what you're like as people. This is the example, This is the example! Are you afraid? Come on out to the school and see us. Yes. I, for one, am afraid. Will any of you come to the school? Very well. Very well. I will come. Well, I don't know, man. I don't feel loaded, y'know. We should smoke another one? Okay. My grass or yours? All tastes about the same past a certain point. I think your taste buds have burned out. No, actually, it's my brain that's burned out. Cool it! There's a plain-clothes car coming out at the intersection. Come on, man. Straighten up and act normal. You sure look weird when you're acting normal. The red one means stop, right? Right. Keeps you on your toes. Don't you think you better pull up to the intersection? Just testing you. Hey, look! Over in the next car. A couple of high school kids passing a joint around. I'll turn on the red light. Right. You kids want to pull over up here! The police when they see them in their rear-view mirrors. Yeah, it seemed a little one-sided to me. Yeah, but kids look at things one-sided. Most of the things they're looking at are pretty much one-sided. Well no I have an idea though, let's try something here. Would you want to come up? By the way does everybody know who Mr. Eldridge and Miss Osgood from the city council? Why don't we do another scene which involves a policeman and differing attitudes so we can use your attitude about policemen as well as ours. And, Kit, we want you to come up too. And why don't Kit you be a mother and Howard be a father a family together? And, Ed, why don't you be a Sheriff Cole? And the two of you be teenage children there of this family. Sure! Sure! Well, I just can't do that. Sure you can. Sheriff, why don't arrest them for, say, marijuana and then take them home to meet their parents and explain the situation. Are you ready to be busted? You're under arrest. Come with me. Hello, Kit. What brings me here are these two. Some trouble sheriff? Yes, Howard. I'm very sorry to have to come here for this, but these children have been smoking marijuana with a known dope fiend. What? Our children? I want to thank you again for coming down. Well I'm sorry it had to happen this way. I know I appreciate your doing this. We'll see you Saturday night at the Donavans'. Sure. Good luck. Pig! Kit! Love from Marge! Bye-bye. Thanks again, Cole. All right, just calm down. Calm down! How can I come down at a time like this? Just sit down. Sit down. How can I sit down? Just bend your legs and sit! Now just calm down. Now what happened here? Nothing happened. What do you mean nothing happened? Nothing happened. Can you believe me? He lied to us. That's right. He lied. You listen. We pay that man to tell us the truth! - Now what happened? - Nothing happened. Saint Jones, you owe me an honest explanation. I want to hear it right now. - I'm not your dog. - Right On! As long as you live under my roof and eat the clothes I give you... I owe you! What are you, are you high on the stuff?! Get up! Don't yell at me! Don't use that tone of voice with me. Dig yourself! What's that supposed to mean, young lady? What happened? I don't know. Tell me what happened, or I'll knock the words right out off your mouth. Nothing happened. Are you smoking this dope or not? No. Snake, you talk to me, or you are going to be in big trouble. Violent creature! Come talk to me. You're just a big hypocrite. That's what you are! Get the door! Tell him we don't want any. Get the door! Tell him we don't want any. Sit! Watch television. Now watch the television and enjoy it. Just everyone be quiet for a second... Watch yourself. And I wondered if everything was all right... Snake's car broke down, and Cole was kind enough to bring him home. You hypocrite! Now you watch your language, young man. - You told me... - Never mind what I told you! I'm telling you something different! A whole new set of lies! Show some respect for your father, son. I'll thrash you! If you ask me, I think you ought to put on a whole show. Invite the whole town. Let 'em know what you're doing up here. Why not? Is Billy still in the kiva? No. The grandfather took him away. Would you like to come and watch the ceremony with me? What is the snake ceremony? It's a ceremony where Billy becomes a brother to the snake. How does he do that? By going on the mountain and being bitten by the snake over and over. Then he passes into unconsciousness for the last time and if he lives he has a vision and in this vision he finds out what his life's mission will be and who the spirit will be to guide him on this mission. Also during this purification part Billy has taken a secret herb medicine and given a sacred poultice to put on the bites. Without it, he would die for sure. It takes about three days for the poison to work its way through his body. And by then it'll either kill him or make him a blood brother to the snake. Listen. The old man is giving him a final blessing. Achieva the Snake waits for you upon sacred mountain. If you pass this test, then you will have a vision. It is not easy, and if you show fear, you shall die. Hold on to this eagle feather, and do not let it go, regardless of what you see or what you hear. The demons will come and try to scare you, but show no fear or you shall die. May the Great Spirit watch over you. How long before we know? Tomorrow. The time is now when the Indian will triumph. He's still in the rapture of the vision. A great Indian holy man, Wovoka, is speaking through him. You mean they had holy men, like saints? They sure did. And Wovoka was one of the greatest. Once even Christ appeared to him. To prevail, and the whole spiritual wisdom of the great holy men of the Indian tradition is now what the young people of the world are looking for. I wonder if I have the guts. This is crazy, man. You pull that trigger and well never get out of here alive. The young whites, they know there is a supernatural world and a great spirit, and they try to reach the Great Spirit. They try by drugs. They are made to do this because their religions no longer believe in the other world. Heaven is not out there, the other world is here. The Great Spirit, the Messiah, the Christ are here in this pit. Your people, my loved ones, there is a thin veil separating us from them. The whites do not know how to reach through that veil, they do not have the belief and they cannot touch their loved ones or the other spirits. I could do it. I could kill him. Yeah, sure you can. But not now, man! Let's get out of here and get some help. And lastly you must learn the dance, the dance of friendship and welcome in which all whites who come to you with open hearts must be taught the dance in the Indian way. Rise up now and I will teach you the dance exactly as Wovoka has seen it should be done. Yeah, well be back. But not with help. I'm going to get him all by myself. Hey, Bernard! Isn't that Barbara? Damn! She is screwing around with an Indian. I thought that was just talk. Okay, Martin. You run and get the paint, and we'll pick you up later, okay? Okay. I don't see how you expect me to carry all the paint? You hang it up on the top of your crunches. Hey... Can we bring it back in case it isn't it might be kind of, you know... Yeah, look at these. They're great. And if you help us get her out of there, you'll not only collect that big fat reward I offered, but you'll save someone's life. Like whose? Yours. And Billy Jack's. But if you fail to help us as sure as this pipe is at your throat you're going to be one hell of a dead Indian. Savvy? You know, I think he is sweet on her. Did it look that way to you Dinosaur? Yeah. Holding hands, kissing her... Now you listen to me, grease ball. If you ever touch her again, I'm going to cripple your other leg, and I don't mean the one you walk on, you hear? What the hell do you think you're doing? Well, I guess the boys found him sneaking out the back without paying. Right, Sam? Yeah, that's right. What are the charges, then, Sam? You heard me, what are the charges? Charges? Well, no charges. Sam here is a pretty good guy. You're not going to press charges, are you, Sam? No charges. No, you're a nice guy, aren't you, Sam? You're a dirty, rotten, lying son of a... Bitch! We are going to do it because of the injunction, we're going to do it by their rules, but we're going to do with our attitudes. And what we want to do is to send six people, because that's as much as we can, into town, where we're going to do some street theatre rather than... Sure! Why let Bernard and the deputy ruin all the friendships we're starting to build. It just pulls us down to their level. Give me all your money! Give me your money. Come on... I left my wallet at home. Well, you got any change? No, sorry. What's in the briefcase? Yogurt. You got a wristwatch? Well, it's a Timex, actually. What did you pay for the band? No, man! That doesn't work! That doesn't scare me. You've blown it as a robber. You've got to come out here and give this man something for his trouble. I as a spectator felt nothing for you other than total embarrassment. You've got to let this man know that as the robber you are going to give a performance to the rob-ee. Now you've got no energy. You need a subtext. In theatre it's a place where you get your energy from the center so that you can bring it out, all at once. Now, what's the first emotion that comes into your head? Confusion. All right. Then use that and bring out that energy. Do you have any bullets in the gun? No. I didn't want to hurt anybody. You should put a bullet in there so that he knows, see? Or at least make him think there are bullets in there. Did you think there were any bullets in the gun? Well, I wasn't very intimidated. I didn't. I'm sorry. Okay, well, it doesn't work that way. You take the gun and you put a bullet in it, and have that feeling of power that you plant in the back of your brain and you mix it with your energy so that when you come out here, you come out a dynamo of robbery. A man who's going to get respect as well as money. I'm going to be robbing you in just a second, so hold on. Okay I'm going to show you exactly what I mean, you get yourself together as a robber and you can even keep it down because it's all flowing out so fast, so you keep it cool and you play it yourself and this man won't know what is happening and you come up to him very cool, let's have your money. Let's go. Freeze! I don't want to hurt you, son, so don't you make any sudden move. Now you just very slowly drop that gun down on the sidewalk? Put your hands up above your head, way up! Move to your right. Keep moving. Hey, you! I want you... No, man! Absolutely not! You took your eyes off me and I'm the suspect. When you look at me and you get me and you don't say freeze while I've got a gun pointed his head. I could freeze his brains out. There's an honest tax-paying citizen ready to blow his own foot up because you haven't put the situation in your control with something short and sharp and authoritative like drop the gun and up against the wall. Hey man, now come... What's going on here? I think it would be a lot clearer if perhaps we just did it all over again. Very good idea. Okay, fine. We'll take it from the top. Okay here's your gun. Remember energy is what's important. I'm waiting for the bus, right? You're waiting for the bus. What have I got here, three psychos? You're not even here yet. Okay, give me your money because I'm confused and I'll explode at any minute. I forgot the line. ""Drop the gun up against the wall."" I can't drop the gun. I've got bullets in it. Well, then take the bullets out. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Here, here. Excuse me. Here, take the briefcase. All right, now look. You stand right over here, sir, and you'll see the whole thing right from the beginning now. You're a businessman, you're a... Let him discover all those things. Fine, good idea. What if the bus comes? Do I get on it? Don't play it that real. Okay give me all your money right now, or bad news. All right, drop the gun. I think that gesture is a little too flamboyant. I wouldn't use that. But you get the tone, don't you? Right, the line was good. That was the important thing... Let's take it from the top once more, please. You're beginning to mesh as a unit. Can I be the robber this time? Sure, mix it up. - My hat... - Yes. Your hat. No subtext is fine, but he just wants to play another guy. I get to be the sheriff, don't I? Right - But I'm not here yet. No you're not here. Okay, I'm gonna warn you, if you drop the gun again, I'm going to mess up the briefcase. - Fair is fair. - Okay, fine. Okay, so I'm waiting for the bus. Right, you're a businessman. Where is that darn bus? Well, Madge and the kids are gonna... All right, you! You've got to be prepared. All right, one of you... I don't care who it is... Get up there and drop the gun. Okay, man. I warned you. You're going to throw the gun around... Hey! Hey! New briefcase there. I borrowed the gun! I don't care if it's a... Okay, Jean. Is that enough? You knew she was there? I knew she was there, you knew she was there. Did you know she was there? Yeah, come by the school anytime. You like nice things, don't you? You better believe it. Maybe you can have them sooner than you think. Just what's that supposed to mean? You heard the deputy. He'll pay $1,000 just to find out where his daughter is. No questions asked. Look, those kids are my friends. What kind of person do you think I am? One would do anything for a buck. Where is Billy Jack hiding Barbara? I honestly don't know. Okay, Miss False Eyelashes. Off with your blouse. OFF! Where's Barbara? Please... I don't know where she is. None of the kids do. I'd tell you if I knew, I would, but I don't know where she is. All the way off... I can't believe it. I really can't believe this guy. Can you believe him? Not really, no. You know what he reminds me of? What? A little monkey. Posner's little monkey, just running around trying to get in all the bananas. Get your blouse and get out of here. Will you look? Probably. Go on, get your blouse. Okay, Bernard. Get out of the car and let's teach you a lesson your daddy should have taught you a long time ago. No, Billy, you can't do it. If you hurt Bernard, they're going to close down the school and ruin everything we've tried to build. What do you suggest I do? Teach him a lesson, but without really hurting him. How? Why don't you drive his car into the lake? What? I said why don't you drive his car into the lake. You know, that's not a bad thought for a pacifist. We have our days. All right, Bernard. Which is it going to be? Drive your car into the lake or... get a dislocated elbow? What do you mean dislocated elbow? What are you, nuts or something? Yeah, a lot of people think so. But then we're stuck with that, you and I. Now which is it gonna be? My old man is going to kill me if anything happens. He just bought this car for me. I mean, he'll kill me if I hurt this car. Really. Come on, Bernard. You get to choose. Which is it going to be? What if I drive away? Or take the knife. Bernard, I wish you would. I really wish you would. Don't, Bernard. You don't stand a chance. Next time I'll cut off your bra! Now... You've got to choose. When I count to three... You drive your car in the lake. One... Two... FLOOR IT! You're gonna sit there and tell me that he didn't pull a gun on you? A knife? Nothing? Nothing. He just told you to drive the car in the lake, and you obeyed him? Now why didn't you drive away? I was scared. You were what? I WAS SCARED! You were sacred? You were scared, so you drove a $6,000 automobile into the lake? Well, you're nothing but a lousy coward. Cole, things are getting uglier and uglier around here. Nothing but a lot of hot heads in town that would like nothing better than to charge right up to that school now and start a fire. Unless you do something, there are going to be a lot of innocent people on both sides getting hurt. So suppose we begin by pressing charges. What kind of charges? What can we prove? That my son is an idiot? A stupid coward, what else? I told you, Stewart. I'll handle it! How come you're hanging around down here, Barbara? It wouldn't have anything to do with Martin, would it? Martin? Listen, I'm going to go for a swim. But you stay off that horse now, you hear? Yes, Mama. How come you never try to lay me? That's a stupid question. Don't cover up. Are you afraid of me? No, I'm not afraid of you. Then what? Wasn't I good enough for you? I heard all Indian boys want to go to bed with white girls. Don't believe everything you hear. But I know you want to. I can tell. How come you never tried? Because you've always been an anybody's... What's an anybody's? An anybody's is someone who puts out so she can get dates or be accepted. I want you to experience the fact that I don't love you because you'll give me some sex. I love you for yourself and for what you are. You see you are very soft and beautiful person and I love you very much. What's that? It's a saying by St. Francis of Assisi. It's kind of dumb, but go ahead and read it. ""Lord grant me this serenity"" to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. My mother left that to me. It was all she had. I want you to have it. Tell me, Dinosaur, why is it when a guy hates his old man as much as I do, you still keep trying to do that one thing that he'll be proud of? What makes you think Billy is going to be by here? I mean he could be in Africa for all we know. My God, Bernard! Look at that! God-damn. What are we going to do now? One move, one sound, one twitch of your eye lash, and you're dead. Put your feet forward! Hang on to the horn! Y'know, for all my braggin'... I never really been able to go all the way with a girl. What if I get all worked up and can't finish it? Hey, it was so funny when my car went into the lake. How come you're not laughing now? Martin? Have you found Jean yet? - We've sent for her. - You better hurry up. I'm afraid Barbara is going to loose that baby. Bernard, this is kidnapping and rape. You stop now and I'll forget it. You go on and I swear that I'll see you in prison for the rest of your life. Not a chance. You got no witnesses. Whose word do you think my old man and the Sheriff will believe anyway, yours or ours? Lousy rotten bitch! You touch me again and I will scream. You let out one sound, and I'll put a bullet right in your mouth. Then you better pull a trigger right now, because I would rather die than have you touch me again. Try Peer Lake. You know part of me doesn't really want to do this. Then let's get out of here. Billy! Kit! They're down here! Help! Billy! Race you, man. Lets get out of here. I pray Billy kills him. You mustn't tell Billy, Cindy. Why not? Because he will kill him. Damn your pacifism! I am not going to let that sick animal get away with this! He has gotten away with it. Even if Billy kills him, kills them all, it wouldn't change what's happened here today. He wouldn't take away any of the horror. It will just destroy a lot of innocent kids. Can't you understand that? My religion, my non-violence... the kids, that's all I have left now. If you rob me of this chance... if I can't really turn the other cheek... when I can help the kids the most... then I couldn't endure what happened here today. And if they took the school away, I just couldn't live with what happened here. Please, Cindy, please. Hey, what happened? I guess she got thrown when she was doing some trick riding. What else is wrong? Come on, I've never seen you act so strange. I guess I'm just upset about Barbara. It was a boy. White. We lost it. Martin, do you know what mental toughness is? Well, mental toughness is the ability to accept the fact that you're human, and that your going to make mistakes. Lots of 'em. All your life. And some of them are going to hurt people that you love very badly, but you have the guts to accept the fact that you're imperfect, and you don't let your mistakes crush you and keep you from doing the very best that you can. A lot of good I could have done. You sure could have. You could've gone inside and comforted that girl instead of sitting out in the porch whining, feeling so sorry for yourself. And the only reason they cremated it was to keep us from knowing that it was that Indian's kid. It was not an Indian. I told you, I handled it. It was a white foetus. You're a goddamn liar. Come on, now, Mike. I don't have to listen to that from you. The hell you don't. Did you know Barbara was at that school? What the hell. I can see this is going no place. Doc! Did Cole know she was at the school? You guys wait. Just wait until it happens to one of your kids. Well, now... I don't think we ought to wait. Jean? Yeah... Telephone. Thank you. Come on, you guys! Star Spangled Banner group get out here! Places! Come on... Hello? Jean, I'm afraid it's really bad. Nobody is going to show up tonight. Why not? It's Posner and the deputy. Seems they are up to something very stupid and crazy. Don't get out of your cars, boys. I don't even want to know who any of you are. Now the only trouble we're going to have here tonight if you are trying to get past me. What do you want to do? Inch forward. You all know me, and you know I'm not going to let this happen. Now you just turn around and go on back home. Every night Martin goes down to the barn to feed the horses, why don't we grab him and hold him until they give you Barbara back? - Cindy? - Yes. Go down to the barn and get Martin, would you? Okay. Martin... come out come out wherever you are. Stop it! I thought I told you to leave him alone. I was just giving the pacifist a chance to turn the other cheek. Look, Jean, if I knew where they were holding him, I'd go there right away, but at this point they don't trust me any more than they do you. I couldn't possibly turn her over to that man. Why not? She can just run away again right after she gets there, and in the meantime, the boy will be safe. Cole, you know damn well that Posner will never hurt that boy. Wouldn't you arrest him if he did? Sure I'd arrest him, but we can't get a conviction in this town and you know it. I'm going back with you. He's right. As long as I stay here, anything can happen. As soon as Martin's safe, I can split again. What can I say? All right, Buck. Where is she? WHERE IS SHE? Leave him alone! She can't pull that trigger. You release that boy, or I swear I'll shoot! I swear it! Please, don't make me shoot you! Now, look miss, do you have the courage to shoot a man that's looking you right in the eye? Please don't make me shoot you. Please! Look out! Martin, get in the truck. Okay. Come on, get in. No, they'll follow you. I can't leave without you. Martin, get going. As soon as you're gone, it's all over. Now go back to the school. I can't. Martin, please get going. All right Bernard, go get him! Careful! He's armed! Billy's gone after Martin! Lord, no. Well, I'll be damned! That injun is shootin' back. Take her home. No, sir. Not until we get Martin back. She's all the insurance I've got. Where's Martin? I said, where's Martin? He got away. Hold it! Now you drop that gun, or I'll shoot her. I'm not gonna ask you again. You won't have to. What? I said shoot her. You'd kill her, just like that? You'll kill her. And then I'll kill you, just like that. I'm itching to kill somebody, so it might just as well be you. Pull the trigger... I wasn't going to hurt the little girl. You knew it all the time, didn't you, Buck? All right, Cindy. Get on. Did you see anyone with a gun? I only heard the shots. Yeah, then what happened? I saw a Corvette pull out. Where did the shots come from? Came from over there. Was he shot? Four times. In the head. I'll give you 24 hours to bring him in, Stuart. And then I'm coming after him. Cole, the girl is gone. It's my fault. It is my fault. If I'd have said something, Martin wouldn't have had to die. If you would have said what? You're not making any sense. Cindy! If she would have told me that Bernard raped Jean. How did you know? I didn't. Billy, please! We haven't crossed over that thin line yet, but if you kill Bernard, you'll be doing just what they want. Can't you see that? You just can't keep making your own laws. There's got to be one set of laws fair for everyone, including you. That's fine. When that set of laws is fairly applied to everyone, then I'll turn the other cheek, too. There's got to be a better way to change those people. To change those people? You worked with King, didn't you? - Yes. - Where is he? - Dead. - Where is Bob and Jack Kennedy? - Dead. - Not dead. Their brains blown out because your people wouldn't even put the same controls on their guns as they do on their dogs, their bicycles, their cats, and their automobiles. I don't care about all that! I just don't want you to go out and commit murder. Please, Billy, please. We'll go someplace else. Someplace where it doesn't have to be like this. Really? You tell me where is that place, where is it? In what remote corner of this country... No, the entire goddamn planet... Is there such a place where men really care about another and really love each other? Now you tell me where such a place is, and I promise you that I'll never hurt another human being as long as I live. Just one place? That's what I thought. I'll be back for Barbara. How old are you? Get out. Search warrant Federal, search warrant State, search warrant County, And a court order demanding that Barbara be turned over to the court pending an investigation into her father's fitness as a parent. Come on, let's get out of here. What do you want to do? Go with you. We can try. All right, tell him I'll take care of it right away. Well, it went out over the wire services. It's a big story now. The governor is sending someone to take personal charge. He wants everything frozen till he gets here. We've cornered him in the old church. He's killed Mike. No. What are we going to do, Jean? He'll die before he'll give himself up. Can you talk to him? Try? You never told me what's in that thing. It's my medicine bag. Got some owl's feathers, sacred corn, snake teeth. What's it for? Contains my power. Without it I'd be outside of the flow of life's forces. Like Samson without his hair? You got it. Billy! Billy Jack! Can you hear me? Jean is coming in to talk to you. It's no trick. No one will try to sneak up on you. She just wants to talk to you. I don't suppose you care too much that you're bleeding to death. Everything they want from here on out, they're gonna have to take. You don't understand that, do you? No. I only know you can't solve everything by violence, Billy. They'll kill you, Billy. I wish there was something I could say to change all that. I know I've never said it to you, but I think you know. I love you. I think you know too. It just seems so insane that we have to go living without you. What about Barbara? It's up to her to decide. Barbara, will you go out with me? No. May I ask why? From the day I was born till this moment, and every second in between, life has just been one big shit brick. I just can't take it anymore. The way things are going, well as the Indians say, today is as good as any to die. You've taught her well. An Indian isn't afraid to die. Don't ever expect a white man to understand that. I understand it. That's good for an Indian. Like the old man said, being an Indian is not a matter of blood. It's a way of life. I understand that, too. She's a 15-year-old child who worships the ground you walk on, and now she's going to die needlessly because you haven't got the guts to control your temper. It's so easy for you to die dramatically. It's a hell of a lot tougher for those of us who have to keep on trying. Stay back there! Hello, Charlie. How are you? Jim, what's the situation? He's barricaded himself in the church. We've got to make every effort to take him alive. No way. Hell, he's only one man. It shouldn't be too tough. What do you mean no way? Why can't you just move on in there and take him with some cover fire, and bring him on out with some tear gas? You've got a whole army here. No way. Can you do it? Well do it. - Get down! - I want to help load. Put your head up and I'll knock it off. Now get down! Stay down! Pull back! Pull back! Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! Pull back. Okay. You can come out now. I don't think I can. This dying stuff's not all it's cracked up to be. You crazy nut. Don't let them take me. You don't even have a medicine bag, so how can it be your day to die? You're going, period. It's just that if you die, that'll kill Jean, the school, and everything she lives for. And if you love her, I don't see why you'd do that to her. That's all. Got to take him alive. Where's that girl? She's already been in there several times. Well, then send her in there several more times. Maybe a couple of us ought to go in with her this time. Hey, Billy! We're not armed. No tricks. You have my word. Come ahead. But you will get a fair trial, because the whole world will have reporters here watching it. And because a lot of politicians will realize it's in their own selfish interest to at least go through the form of giving you a fair trial. But in the meantime, you will have accomplished an awful lot of good. Like what? Like calling attention to the unbelievably horrible way that the Indian is cheated and forced to live in this country. And the stupid insensitivity of Washington, the whole damn Indian bureau. For God's sake, Billy, you get yourself killed now, it's a headline in tomorrow's paper and that's it. But if you go to trial, millions of people will learn what's happening. Like you just said, still not a damn thing will be done. What about the school? Could we get enough money and freedom to run it for the next five years without interference? They'll give you that in a minute. In writing? I'm sure they would. It's funny, isn't it? Only the white man wants everything put in writing, and only then so he can use it against you in court. You know, among the Indians, a promise is good enough. As far as I can tell, Washington entered into 3,500 treaties with the Indians to date, and they've broken about 3,499. I agree with you, Billy. Promises haven't meant very much. But this is one they'll keep. The important point is this. If you have to go out, you might as well make it count for something. Well, I can't think of anything else to say. Tell them that I'll give them an answer in the morning. We're different, you and I. Your spirit is more calm and pacific in you than any person I have ever known. And mine has been in a violent rage from the day I was born. And you know something? I didn't really want it that way. Billy, that's a bunch of crap. I'm no different than you. Do you think when Bernard was on top of me, grunting and slobbering, I didn't hate? I hated more than anybody else on this earth ever hated. And every time that picture pops in to my mind, I... whoo... I've never hated so much in my life. When I think of that, I dismember and I mangled, and I castrate Bernard over and over and over and over in my mind. At least a million times a day. The bad part is, even though he's dead... I couldn't tell you. You had to get your hate out. I had to keep mine in. I knew what you'd do. But I knew how important it was to the kids. And I knew that their lives and their needs were more important than any hate I had. They're more important than killing Bernard. But maybe... maybe if I had told you... Martin may... might be alive now. I don't know. I don't know anymore. First, the school be guaranteed to operate for the next ten years without any interference, and that I be given a ten-year contract as directress. Second, that Barbara be put in my custody as her legal guardian. That's all he wants? No, he also wants you to guarantee that someone from the governor's office will hold a press conference every year to report on the progress of the school. Hell, he's got it. Call Washington. See if they'll honor their end of the bargain. Some lawyer from the East called. He wants to defend you free. I know to let them handcuff you... close you in, and lock you up is by far the hardest thing you've ever done. And I know that you're only doing it because of the love you have for the kids... and me. Washington says okay, Billy. I love you, Billy. You've got a deal!, There was me. That is, Alex, and my three droogs. That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim. And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar, trying to make up our rassoodocks... ... what to do with the evening. The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus. Milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom... ... which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up... ... and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence. In Dublin 's fair city Where the girls are so pretty I first set my eyes On sweet Molly Malone As she wheeled her wheelbarrow Through streets broad and narrow Crying, ""Cockles and mussels..."" One thing I could never stand... ... was to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie... ... howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers... ... and going ""blerp blerp"" in between... ... as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age. But more especially when he was real old, like this one was. Can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards! I don't want to live anyway. Not in a stinking world like this. And what's so stinking about it? It's a stinking world because there's no law and order anymore! It stinks because it lets the young get onto the old... ...like you done! It's no world for an old man any longer. What kind of a world is it at all? Men on the moon. Men spinning around the earth. And there's not no attention paid... ...to earthly law and order no more. Oh, dear land I fought for thee It was at the derelict casino that we came across Billy-boy... ... and his four droogs. They were about to perform a little of the old... ... in-out, in-out on a weepy young devotchka they had there. Well, if it isn't fat, stinking... ...billy goat Billy-boy in poison. How are thou... ...thou globby bottle of cheap, stinking chip-oil? Come and get one in the yarbles... ...if you have any yarbles... ...you eunuch jelly, thou. Let's get them, boys! The police! Come on. Let's go! The Durango 95 purred away real horrorshow. A nice, warm vibratey feeling all through your guttiwuts. Soon it was trees and dark, my brothers... ... with real country dark. We fillied around with other travelers of the night... ... playing Hogs of the Road. Then we headed west. What we were after now was the old surprise visit. That was a real kick... ... and good for laughs and lashing of the old ultra-violent. Who on earth could that be? I'll go and see. Yes, who is it? Excuse me, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident! My friend's bleeding to death! Can I please use your telephone? We don't have a telephone. You'll have to go somewhere else. But, missus, it's a matter of life and death! Who is it, dear? A young man. He says there's been an accident. He wants to use the telephone. I suppose you better let him in. Wait a minute, will you? I'm sorry, but we don't usually let strangers in... What do you want from me? Pete, check the rest of the house. Dim... I'm singing in the rain Just singing in the rain What a glorious feeling I'm happy again I'm laughing at clouds So dark up above The sun 's in my heart And I'm ready for love Let the stormy clouds chase Everyone from the place Come on with the rain I've a smile on my face I'll walk down the lane With a happy refrain And I'm singing Just singing... ... in the rain Viddy well, little brother. Viddy well. We were all feeling a bit shagged and fagged and fashed... ... it having been an evening of some small energy expenditure. So we got rid of the auto and stopped at the Korova for a nightcap. Hello, Lucy. Had a busy night? We've been working hard too. Pardon me, Luce. There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner... ... laughing and govoreeting. The devotchka smeched away, not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disk on the stereo twanged off and out. And in the short silence before the next one came on... ... she suddenly came with a burst of singing. And it was like, for a moment, O my brothers... ... some great bird had flown into the milk bar. And I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott... ... standing endwise. And the shivers crawling up like slow, malenky lizards... ... and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van. What did you do that for? For being a bastard with no manners. Without a dook of an idea about how to comport yourself public-wise. I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be. Watch that. Do watch that, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish. Yarbles! Great, bouncy yarblockos to you! I'll meet you with chain or nozh or britva anytime. I'm not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it. A nozh scrap anytime you say. Doobidoob. A bit tired maybe. Best not to say more. Bedways is rightways now. So best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right? Where I lived was with my dada and mum... ... in municipal flat block 1 8- A, Linear North. It had been a wonderful evening. And what I needed now to give it the perfect ending... ... was a bit of the old Ludwig van. Oh, bliss! Bliss and heaven! It was gorgeousness and gorgeosity made flesh. It was like a bird of rarest spun heaven metal. Or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship... ... gravity all nonsense now. As I slooshied... ... I knew such lovely pictures. Alex. Alex! What do you want? It's past eight, Alex. You don't want to be late for school, son. Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be, and I'll try and sleep it off. And then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after. But you've not been to school all week, son. Got to rest, Mum. Got to get fit. Otherwise, I'm liable to miss a lot more school. I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off meself now. All right, Mum. Have a nice day at the factory. He's not feeling too good again this morning, Dad. Yes. Yes, I heard. You know what time he got in? No, I don't. I'd taken me sleepers. I wonder... ...where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings. Like he says... ...it's mostly odd things he does. Helping-like... ...here and there, as it might be. Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid. Funny surprise, seeing you here. Alex-boy! Awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere. Hence, not at school, yes? A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother sir. It should be clear by this afterlunch. Or certainly by this evening, yes. The evening's the great time, isn't it, Alex-boy? - Cup of the old chai, sir? - No time, no time. Sit, sit, sit! To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong? Have you been doing something you shouldn't? Just a manner of speech. Yes, well, it's just a manner of speech from your... ...post-corrective advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. Because next time it's not going to be the corrective school. Next time it'll be the Barley place, and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for yourself... ...you at least might have some for me, who sweated over you. A big, black mark, I tell you, for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you... ...who ends up in the stripy hole. I've been doing nothing I shouldn't. The millicents have nothing on me, brother. Sir, I mean. Cut out this clever talk about millicents. Just because the police haven't picked you up... ...doesn't mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of nastiness last night. Some very extreme nastiness, yes? A few of a certain Billy-boy's friends were ambulanced off late. Your name was mentioned. The words got to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Nobody can prove anything about anybody, as usual. I'm warning you, little Alex... ...being a good friend to you as always... ...the one man in this sore and sick community... ...who wants to save you from yourself! What gets into you all? We've been studying the problem for damn well near a century. But we get no farther with our studies. You got a good home here. Good, loving parents. You've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you? Nobody's got anything on me. I been out of the millicents' rookers for a long time. That's just what worries me. A bit too long to be safe. You're about due, by my reckoning. That's why I'm warning you... ...to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear? As an unmuddied lake, sir. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Excuse me, brother. I ordered this two weeks ago. Can you see if it's arrived? Just a minute. Pardon me, ladies. Enjoying that, are you, my darling? A bit cold and pointless, isn't it, my lovely? What's happened to yours, my little sister? Who you getting, bratty? Goggly Gogol? Johnny Zhivago? The Heaven 17? What you got back home to play your fuzzy warbles on? I bet you've got little pitiful, portable picnic players. Come with Uncle and hear all proper. Hear angel trumpets and devil trombones. You are invited. Hi, hi, hi, there. Well, hello. He are here! He have arrived! Hooray! Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well! To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? We got worried. There we were, waiting and drinking away at the old knifey moloko... ...and you had not turned up. And we thought you might have been, like... ...offended by something or other. So around we come to your abode. Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver, so I had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for wakening. Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver too much-like, maybe. Giving orders and discipline and such, perhaps. You sure the pain is gone? You sure you'd not be happier back in bed? Let's get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such... ...does not become you, my little brothers. As I am your droog and leader I'm entitled to know what goes on. Now then, Dim. What does that great big horsey gape of a grin portend? All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way. New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, I know it. If you must have it, have it, then. We go around shop crasting and the like... ...coming out with a pitiful rookerfull of money each. And Will the English in the coffee mesto... ...saying he can fence anything any malchick tries to crast. The shiny stuff. The ice! The big, big money's available, is what Will the English says. And what will you do with the big, big, big money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motorcar, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it. Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a man-size crast. Good! Real horrorshow! Initiative comes to thems that wait. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you had in mind, Georgie-boy. The old moloko plus first. Would you not say? - Something to sharpen us up. - Some moloko plus. You got to go there first. We got a start on you. Moloko Plus! As we walked along the flatblock marina... ... I was calm on the outside, but thinking all the time. So now it was to be Georgie the General... ... saying what we should do and what not to do. And Dim as his mindless, grinning bulldog. But suddenly I viddied that thinking was for the gloopy ones... ... and that the oomny ones used, like, inspiration and what Bog sends. For now it was lovely music that came to my aid. There was a window open with a stereo on... ... and I viddied right at once what to do. I had not cut into any of Dim's main cables. And so with the help of a clean tashtook... ... the red, red kroovy soon stopped. And it did not take long to quieten the two wounded soldiers... ... down in the snug of the Duke of New York. Now they knew who was master and leader. Sheep, thought I. But a real leader knows always when, like... ... to give and show generous to his unders. Now we're back to where we were. Yes? Just like before, and all forgotten? Right, right, right? Right. Right. Right. Well, Georgie-boy... ...this idea of yours for tonight. Tell us all about it, then. Not tonight. Not this nochy. Come, come, come, Georgie-boy. You're a big, strong chelloveck, like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie-boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? It's this health farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own. It's full up with, like, gold and silver... ... and, like, jewels. Tell me more, Georgie-boy. Tell me more. Oh, shit! Who's there? Excuse me, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident! Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance? I'm frightfully sorry. There's a telephone in the public house a mile down the road. I suggest you use that. But missus, this is an emergency! It's a matter of life and death! Me friend's lying in the middle of the road, bleeding to death! I'm very sorry, but I never open the door to strangers after dark. Very well, madam. You can't be blamed for being suspicious... ...with so many scoundrels and rogues of the night about. I'll try and get help at the pub, then. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. Thank you very much. Good night. Dim, bend down. I'll get in that window and open the front door. Radlett Police Station? Good evening. It's Miss Weathers at Woodmere Health Farm. I'm sorry to bother you, but something rather odd just happened. It's probably nothing at all, but you never know. A young man rang the bell, asking to use the telephone. He said there's been some kind of accident. The thing that caught my attention was what he said. His words sounded like those quoted in the papers this morning... ...in connection with the writer and his wife who were assaulted. Just a few minutes ago. If you think that's necessary. But I'm quite sure he's gone away now. All right, fine. Thank you very much. Hi, hi, hi, there. At last we meet. Our brief govorett through the letter-hole was not satisfactory. Who are you? How the hell did you get in here? What the bloody hell do you think you're doing? Naughty, naughty, naughty! You filthy old soomaka. Now listen here, you little bastard! Just turn round and walk out of here the same way you came in. Leave that alone! Don't touch it! It's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want? To be perfectly honest, madam... ...I'm taking part in an international students' contest... ...to see who can get the most points for selling magazines. Cut the shit, sonny... ...and get out of here before you get yourself into serious trouble. I told you to leave that alone! Now get out of here... ...before I throw you out! Wretched, slummy bedbug! I'll teach you to break into real people's houses. Fucking... ...little... ...bastard! - Let's go. The police are coming! - One minoota, droogie. You bastards! I'm blind! I'm blind, you bastards! I can't see! It's no good sitting there in hope, my little brothers. I won't say a single solitary slovo unless I have my lawyer here. I know the law, you bastards. Righty-right, Tom. We'll have to show our friend Alex here that we know the law too. But that knowing the law isn't everything. Nasty cut you've got there, little Alex. Shame, isn't it? Spoils all your beauty. Who gave you that, then? How'd you do that, then? What's your point, you bastard? That is for your lady victim. You ghastly... ...wretched scoundrel. Get him off me! You rotten little bastard! Good evening, Mr. Deltoid. Good evening, Sergeant. They're in room B, sir. Thank you very much. Sergeant... Good evening. Good evening, Inspector. - Would you like your tea now, sir? - No, thank you, Sergeant. May I have some paper towels, please? We're interrogating the prisoner now. - Perhaps you'd care to come inside. - Thank you very much. Good evening, Sergeant. Good evening, all. Oh, dear! This boy does look a mess, doesn't he? Just look at the state of him. Love's young nightmare-like. Violence makes violence. He resisted his lawful arrestors. This is the end of the line for me. The end of the line, yes. And what of me, brother sir? Speak up for me. I'm not so bad. I was led on by the treachery of others. Sings the roof off lovely, he does, sir. Where are my treacherous droogs? Get them before they get away! It was all their idea, brothers. They forced me to do it. I'm innocent! You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer. Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchok. She were breathing, I swear it. I've just come from the hospital. Your victim has died. You try to frighten me. Admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. - Say it, brother sir. - It'll be your own torture. I hope to God it'll torture you to madness. If you'd care to give him a bash in the chops, don't mind us. We'll hold him down. He must be a great disappointment to you, sir. This is the real weepy and tragic part of the story beginning... ... O my brothers and only friends. After a trial, with judges and a jury... ... and hard words spoken against your friend and humble narrator... ... he was sentenced to 14 years in Staja Number 84- F... ... among smelly perverts and hardened prestoopniks. The shock sending my dada beating his bruised and krovvy rookers... ... against unfair Bog in His Heaven. And my mum boo-hoo-hooing in her mother's grief... ... at her only child and son of her bosom... ... like, letting everybody down real horrorshow. Morning. One up from Thames, mister. Right! Open up the cell! Yes, sir. Here are the prisoner's committal forms. Thank you, mister. - Name? - Alexander DeLarge. You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor. From this moment, you will address all prison officers as ""sir."" Name? Alexander DeLarge, sir. Sentence? 14 years, sir. Crime? Murder, sir. Right. Take the cuffs off him, mister. You are now 655321. It is your duty to memorize that number. Thank you, mister. Well done. - Thank you. - Let the officer out. All right, empty your pockets. Are you able to see the white line painted on the floor... ...directly behind you... Then your toes belong... ...on the other side of it! - Yes, sir. - Right. Carry on. Pick that up... ...and put it down properly. One half-bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens. One black, one red. One pocket comb, black plastic. One address book, imitation red leather. One ten-penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch... ...Timawrist, on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets? - No, sir. - Right. Sign here for your valuable property. The tobacco and chocolate you brought in... ...you lose that... ...as you are now convicted. Now over to the table and get undressed. Were you in police custody this morning? One jacket, blue pinstriped. Prison custody? Yes, sir, on remand. - One necktie, blue. - Religion? C. Of E., sir. Do you mean the Church of England? Yes, sir. The Church of England. Brown hair, isn't it? Fair hair, sir. Blue eyes? Blue, sir. Do you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses? No, sir. One shirt, blue. Collar attached. Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness? One pair of boots, black leather. Zippered. Worn. Have you ever had any mental illness? Do you wear any false teeth or any false limbs? One pair of trousers, blue pinstriped. Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness? One pair of socks, black. Are you an epileptic? One pair of underpants, white with blue waistband. Are you now, or have you ever been, a homosexual? Right. - The mothballs, mister. - Mothballs, sir. Now then, face the wall... ...bend over and touch your toes. Any venereal disease? Crabs? Lice? - Through there for the bath. - One for a bath. What's it going to be, eh? Is it going to be in and out of institutions like this... ...though more in than out for most of you? Or are you going to attend to the divine word... ...and realize the punishments that await unrepentant sinners... ...in the next world as well as this? A lot of idiots you are... ...selling your birthright for a saucer of cold porridge. The thrill of theft. Of violence. The urge to live easy. Well, I ask you what is it worth... ...when we have undeniable proof... ...yes, incontrovertible evidence... ...that hell exists? I know! I know, my friends. I have been informed... ...in visions... ...that there is a place... ...darker than any prison... ...hotter than any flame of human fire... ...where souls... ...of unrepentant criminal sinners like yourselves... Don't you laugh, damn you! Don't you laugh. I say, like yourselves... ...scream... ...in endless and unendurable agony. Their skin... ...rotting and peeling. A fireball... ...spinning in their screaming guts! I know. Yes, I know! All right, you lot! We'll end by singing hymn 258... ...in the prisoner's hymnal. And let's have a little reverence, you bastards! I was a wandering sheep - Sing up, damn you! - I did not love the fold Louder! I did not love my shepherd's voice I would not be controlled Louder! It had not been edifying. Indeed not. Being in this hellhole and human zoo for two years now. Being kicked and tolchoked by brutal warders... ... and meeting leering criminals and perverts... ... ready to dribble all over... ... a luscious young malchick like your storyteller. It was my rabbit... ... to help the prison charlie with the Sunday service. He was a bolshy, great burly bastard. But he was very fond of myself, me being very young... ... and also now very interested in the Big Book. I read all about the scourging and the crowning with thorns. And I could viddy myself helping in... ... and even taking charge of the tolchoking and the nailing in. Being dressed in the height of Roman fashion. I didn 't so much like the latter part of the Book... ... which is more like all preachy talking... ... than fighting and the old in-out. I like the parts where these old yahoodies tolchok each other... ... and then drink their Hebrew vino... ... and getting onto the bed with their wives ' handmaidens. That kept me going. ""Seek not to be like evil men. Neither desire to be with them... ...because their minds studieth robberies... ...and their lips speak deceits."" If thou lose hope, being weary in the days of distress... ...thy strength shall be diminished. Fine, my son. Fine. Father? I have tried, have I not? You have, my son. - I've done my best, have I not? - Indeed. I've never been guilty of any institutional infraction, have I? You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful. And you've shown a genuine desire to reform. Father... ...can I ask you a question in private? Certainly, my son. Certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember... ...I know of the... ...urges that can trouble young men... ...deprived... ...of the society of women. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment. It gets you out of prison in no time. And makes sure you never get back in again. Where did you hear about this? Who's been talking about these things? These things get around. Two warders talk, as it might be. And somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops... ...and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment? I take it you are referring... ...to the Ludovico technique. I don't know what it's called. I just know it gets you out quickly... ...and makes sure you never get back in again. That is not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment. It has been used, hasn't it? It has not been used in this prison yet. The governor has grave doubts about it. And I've heard there are very serious dangers involved. I don't care about the dangers. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be... ...one act of goodness. The question is... ...whether or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness... ...is chosen. When a man cannot choose... ...he ceases to be a man. I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good. Be patient, my son. Put your trust in the Lord. Instruct Thy Son and He shall refresh thee... ...and shall give delight to thy soul. Amen. - Mister! - All present and correct, sir! Right! All present and correct, sir! Prisoners, halt! Now pay attention! I want you in two lines... ...up against that wall, facing this way. Go on, move! Hurry up! Stop talking! Prisoners ready for inspection, sir! How many to a cell? Four in this block, sir. Cram criminals together and what do you get? Concentrated criminality. Crime in the midst of punishment. I agree, sir. We need larger prisons, more money. Not a chance, my dear fellow. The government can't be concerned any longer... ...with outmoded penalogical theories. Soon we may need all prison space for political offenders. Common criminals are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex, that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them. They enjoy their so-called punishment. You're absolutely right, sir. Shut your bleeding hole! Who said that? I did, sir., I believe the harder time is to wake up in the morning. Those first moments before I remember who I am... instead of remember me... Who I was. Mother, there is snow in Mt. Tom.  Will still be there on the weekend. Do not make me go to school today. It's the first day of snow. There is snow on Mount Tom.   Want to get some more sleep? I can not delay on the first day of class. Everyone will go skiing, except me. Oh, I wanted to go, too. Get out of here! Mother! Want to please find Gary. The reverend called tonight and said his class... will be full this year. Good morning, children. Good morning. I am Jill Kinmont, your teacher. Good morning. Then my mother puts me in the chair in the morning. And I stay all day. Until she takes me out at night. Do you stay in the chair all day? I stay. Are you never going to the bathroom? All the time. I have a catheter inserted into me. A probe that stays inside me... attached to a bag stuck in my leg. See. Here is the place. Wow, what a beautiful thing. What is the best way to fish for trout? With a harpoon. Great. How do you write harpoon? Come on. You can fish the trout. A-R-P-A-O It was almost, it was almost certain. But in the end it is no. Do you know how to write? Edie? - A, til, O. - Right. So how do you write harpoon? - Me, me, me! - Everyone. A-R-P--O Right. No, no one will want to marry you. Do not you? Of course, she is beautiful. But she can not dance or anything. Has anyone ever asked you? - He asked for what? - In married. - Yes. - Who? You do not know. If he asked, why did not you accept? I always think I have overcome everything. That no longer hurts me more. Suddenly everything comes back. Here in Bishop, more than anywhere. Because here I can raise my eyes and see the snow. I am Jill Kinmont and I am a skier! A WINDOW FOR HEAVEN Here, look at it here. The most beautiful thing that I have ever seen. The fastest skier in the world. Buek, the crazy dog is his nickname, because he... is a crazy person. And they say he's trying to kill himself. - Is it? Well, that's what they say. What if he dies before we meet him? What if he kills himself before joining the team? No you will not. - And if he dies? We will not know. - What is this? - Anything. Ah, what is this, come on. Let me see. - What is this? - Anything. Girl. Oh, it's Dick Buek. I got a letter from him this morning. Did not you know? We have corresponded ourselves for a long time. He's crazy to meet me when joining the Olympic team. Of course! But he is too old.  You must be about 22 years old. Besides, I'm in love with another guy. Oh is it? And who is the lucky one? James Dean. Attention, I want all listening. A.J? We have our first competition of the year... this weekend, or next weekend. In general I take the best skiers to these races. But this time I decided to take everyone. Herbie, do you want to stop with these hands? I did not do anything. Herbie, take it easy. What did I do wrong? As if he did not know.  You do not stop with those hands. Lie, they're still. It's okay. Can someone change place with Gil? I change. Audra Jo! - How wonderful! - Wow! A.J. return here and take your skis. Thank you. Herbie. Herbie, tell her to come back and get the skis. Let's all be together , okay? As far as I remember, everything I wanted... It was skiing. It was not just a sport, it was a way of life. Our coach was David McCoy. A former champion who gave to our Gym the... team level first line. And now the number 74, Boulder. Colorado. Our most difficult opponent was the team from Boulder, Colorado. Led by a real hall named Buddy Werner. Ready for the start No. 46 of Bishop, California. Ten seconds. Skeeter Werner of Boulder, Colorado with # 6.  One, already! The best team of Colorado skier was... Skeeter Werner. And began a personal war for... prove which team was the best. Paragraph 14, ten seconds. Alda Jo Nicholson, Bishop, California. - Five, four... - Number 14. Three, two, one, already! This is your second year of competition. Last year she finished fourth in the... Finals in Z'berg, California. No 89, ready for the start. At the starting spot, Jill Kinmont, No. 89. Jill can still reach it. Skeeter beat me... for only five seconds. Ten seconds! Five, four, three, two, one, already! - Jill goes, goes! - Go! Jill Kinmont, No. 89, Running Incomplete. Beautiful. Do you want me to take a picture of you? I bit my tongue. Who ordered to leave out in the race? Wonder why you burned? My coach will tell me, thank you. Skinny is gravity.  It's so much more powerful than you. The less you fight it, the faster it will go. Do I know you? No. Raises. What are you, doctor? No. Look, keep your hands right in front of you. What do these initials mean? That's my name. Bend like this and release the body. Gravity works... - Mike? Ankles, knee, back , elbows. Is Melvin? Mark? Make you a projectile. Do you want to learn to ski or not? Look, I'm sorry. But I do not take ski lessons... with anyone not. I am Jill Kinmont and it happens that I am the best skier... My God! It's the crazy dog Buek! We now have the first placed, Skeeter and Buddy Werner. I had met Dick Buek. And I thought my life would never be the same. But summer has come and all the fantasies... they had to be put aside. My family ran a ranch named Rockin K. And during the summers we all worked on it. That was it. - I can not believe. My best friend was Audra Jo Nicholson. We were inseparable. - He is looking at us. Look at his face. There was nothing we did not know about each other. No dream we did not share. But our biggest dream was skiing. We lived always in the hope of some day to participate... Olympic team meetings. Hey, J. Are you awake? Can I talk to you? I'm so tired. But you just will listen. It's okay. I've been thinking about luck. Why does luck always walk with me? Everything I wanted, I always did. Have you ever felt this? Once in a while. E... I begin to think if... I am not one of those people who were born with luck. If I'm using all my luck at once. What do you think? I think I'm sick. What happened? I have a horrible headache You did not catch the sun too much A. J.? Want an aspirin? I already have. It was too much sun that you took. Improved? Continue. Do not know... I wonder if... I'll go back to see Dick. What do you think? Jose? A.J? Are you alright? Jose? Are you alright? Guys, call a doctor, there's something wrong with A. J.! What did the doctor say? I think it would be better you guys get my car... And come back, okay? But what is it? They think it's polio. You must go now. Coach! Can you give her that ring? And tell her that I love her. Really. Josie. We go together the Olympics. You will be fine. We go together. You will be fine. You will be fine, Jose. You will be fine. After Jose got sick I wanted to ski for both of us. And I trained that summer more than in any other. Is it really him? He is. He landed his airplane practically... in Dave's backyard. I saw you from the highway. I thought he was going to fall. But when I got there - it was coming out of the... Crutches plane. Of crutches? I swear to God.  He was flying the crutch plane. Why? The leg, it broke the leg. Did not you know?  She left in all the magazines. He was on the motorcycle at 150. He hit a trailer of camping and... flew in through one window and out the other. They thought she had died and even covered his face. Have you ever imagined? He did not know anything. That's what you get for living in the woods. You're not kidding me- no, right Linda? Cheating? I swear.  Look at his plane, son of a bitch. - Hi, girls. - Hi. What happened? It's just that we were going to school, so... We decided to give a pass here. And knowing what time will be the training. In the usual time. I did not say that would be the usual time? I do not know why she insisted on passing by? - Hi! - Excuse. Hi. - I'm Linda Mayer. - Hi, beautiful. I've read a lot about you since you started skiing. I wrote you a letter to the hospital. Ah, this is an old friend of mine. Old friend of mine too. Do you know her? Everything that she knows, I taught. Listen to girls, you're not going to be late for class, right? Come on Jill, we'll be late. You can go, find you later. What story can this be? That you can go. Then... Would not you like to take a walk? Ok. Do you think she's on the plane with him? It's best to call David McCoy. - We can cross here. You will not. Give up to betting race. Why do you do these things? Do you want to kill yourself? I've heard of the crazy things you do. Freefall with parachute found in trash cans. Motorcycle racing like crazy. Do not believe everything you say. - Why, Dick? - Because what? Why do you want to die? - Are you worried? - Do not play. I'm wondering. I do not worry about it. Oh, yes. Here I am. And I am nothing. I studied until high school. No thought important in the head. But I live. No matter what I do, I end up standing again. I do not know why good people die. And I keep living. You are a good person. Yes it is. And how do you know? I know I care with you. So it should be good. You find me funny. I think you're beautiful. You too. Yes it is. Dick. Please stay alive. Winter of 1955. We were there for a year of the Olympics. And everyone who wanted to if they were classified would have... they finish the season among the first. E at the starting spot, or No. 32, Allan Freeman. Four, three, two, one, already! Listen, you can not see it very well. So then, let go. But be aggressive until the end, okay? Ten seconds. And with No. 89, Jill Kinmont. Three, two, one, already! As the dispute escalated... greater was my determination to win. I won the regional tournament more trophies... than I had won in a year. And No. 89 was beginning to draw attention. Excuse me. - Wow, you were great. - Thanks. - Let's see what it was... - Hey Buddy, how about putting... the arm on her waist? Ask her if she will leave. The best was Jill Kinmont. You leave? In that wonderful year Buddy Werner has obtained many... victories like me. And for all the places we were going to, we all wanted... We started dating. But I kept thinking in Buek and during... That winter I searched for him. - Account for me. - IT IS. - Is it really? - Yes.  Look who's here, the Buek. Who is that blonde with him? Must be someone's daughter. They say they are engaged. - Hi, how are you?  You do not want to play a game? - Give it some time. Okay, bye, Dick. Hey, Dick. How did you break your arm? Dancing with a heavy girl. I know you, do not I? Yes. - Hello Buddy. - Hi. I want to introduce you to you my fiance. Hey, Dick Buek! How's it going, man? Are you reminded of Charlie last winter? - Yes, of course. Come on, I'll buy you a beer. Come on, you talk to these guys later. Hey. If there is anything wrong, I would like to help. - Good race! - Too! Listen, you take it easy this time. You're good on the front, right? So do not try no record. And do not forget that tree, right? Come on, there. Capriche, have fun and... Hold the lead. 89, ten seconds. At the starting spot, Jill Kinmont, With No. 89. - The skier of the year. Four, three, two, one, now! When the season was nearing the end. Buddy and I were invited to train in a special field. Preparing us for the last great race of the year. It was called, snow bowl. And it was held in Alta, Utah. If I won there, I would be qualified for the Olympics. Come on Jill, stop with the jokes. Jill, let's go back. Come soon, let's get down. February 1, 1955. The Snow Bowl would be within a few days. And the experts bet that we would both win. Will both of you go to the Olympic games together? Have both of you ever fallen in a dispute? Listen, I'll talk to you later. I get distracted from _ time to time I fall. And you think it will be very difficult? How about competing with all favorites? Thanks. - Good luck. - They are awesome. Flight 32, coming from Los Angeles, landing... through gate four. David. And then? Did you have a good trip? She will be doing a lot well, of course she will leave. This reception was a beauty, was not it? It is divided into three parts. You have to go slowly at first. But it will have to increase well the speed... when entering the middle part There's the ditch they call a corkscrew. On that side. Then comes a relatively easy voucher. And already will have arrived. Look, the race will be won or lost right there. There in the corkscrew. There is a rise. A steep climb up before him. So if you get into it too fast, you will... upload with everything. Therefore, decrease there. - Right. Wait a little, that is Andrea Mead Lawrence. It is decreasing. You're slower, right? Okay, it was almost perfect, you saw? She lost some time, but managed to control himself, understood? Now go ahead and do your training, okay? My main opponent was a girl named... Andrea Lawrence. Great skier from the east who needed to beat the... Race as much as I do. But after seeing her train I concludes that he could beat her. She was decreasing a lot in the corkscrew and it was there... that I could beat it. - Jill! - Buddy! - I wanted to wish good luck. Also for you. - Take. - What is it? - I want you to stay with you. - What is? Saint Kitts, for luck. - I have to go. - Jill. I want to go to the olympics married. With me And with whom would it be? I do not know. I'm a heap of nerves. Now I have to go. I love you. I love you, too. We meet there down, right? Right. And we talk about that there too. - Right. - Good luck. With the No. 14 by the male division, Bob Lowner... in his first race. - See that. How he fell. Right and left. Carpenter and Walsh... have already hit a record. And the two main competitors... Andrea Mead Lawrence and Jill Kinmont are still going to run. At the starting spot, Andrea Mead Lawrence... with number 6. Go Andy! Yes, we are ready. Three, two, one, already! And here she comes - coming down very well. It will be difficult to beat her.  Half the race is over. Next competitor, No. 89, Jill Kinmont. You can win the race. You have to win, right? Be sweaty, use your head and watch the mountain. Are they all ready? - Yes.  - Chronometrists too?  Yes, all set. Everything ready for the skier No. 89. - Yes, everything is ready. - It's ok. Ten seconds! Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two, one, already! Empty the lane, please. Empty the lane. It's okay. They're already doing it. Yes, they are. Empty the track. Want to Empty the track, please. Do you feel pain in some place, Jill? I do not feel anything. Can you feel your toes? No. Jill, it's David. We will take care of her. Jill, I want you to listen to me. Try to stay calm. These people will take care of you, okay? I'm going down to the bottom and I'll see you from here. - Are you okay? - Right. Don, Jake, take her by the arms. Sam. You take by the legs. Skeeter, you hold your feet. Let's straighten it out. Careful and slow. That's right. It's only gonna take a minute. Hold on, Jill. Straighten up and her leg a little longer, Skeeter. It's okay. When I say three, let's get her up. Slowly. One two Three. Slow down, that. So. Cover it now. Ready? One two Three. Slow down, be careful. Try to keep it level. So. Caution. Back, please. Please, back. Driver. How long will it take? You are very bottled. It may take hours. She will not succeed. David, I will not die. I want you to hear me. This is Jill Kinmont. And she will not die. You understood well? My head. What's in my head?  It is the traction. Jill. You will be good Jill. Are you listening to me? Do not look at me like that. Sleep, Jill. Close your eyes and sleep. If I sleep, do not agree more. You will heal yourself, Jill. Yes you will. Help me stay awake, Buddy.  Help me stay awake. There was a fracture with displacement of the spine... at C5 level. In simple language, means that... Her neck broke. And the marrow was entirely broken. And is there a cure? It will merge. But that's not the same thing as healing. - What is the... - Prognosis? Yes. At this point... It is a matter of speculation. We will have to wait... she tells us. In the meantime, all we have to do is wait. And twist. Wait for her to walk? Let her live. One, two, three. Who is there? Hi, I'm your doctor, Dr. Pittman. There is blood in your shoe. Oh, it's life. I hope it is not mine. Wait outside. - Jill. Mom, come here. - Oh, Jill. - I do not see you. - Can you turn it on? We turn now. Please do not cry, Mom. His eyes are filled with water. Do not cry too or will wet my whole face. No, just with eyes. It hurts the head. I'm almost done. And come back again. Great. Nurse. Thank you. - It's bad, no. - Why do you say that. I suspect smiling doctors. Want to hear about it? Of course. Nothing seems to have been left here below. No movement, no feelings... of any kind. If the fracture had been a fraction below. You would have lost the use of your hands. But if it had been a fraction above... You would have to live in a steel lung. - How long? - How long? For me to get well. - Jill. - Dr. Pittman. - You do not understand. And not you. I have a mania, you know. How much do I want some... thing, I can. I understand this, but... No, you do not understand. I'm going to walk out of here. And if you tell someone who will be the opposite... I'll leave you with your face to the ground. Hi. How are you feeling? - Very well. I'm coming home. So I decided to go here and tell you that... if you need anything, anything... same, just ask me for them to call me... Then I'll see what I can do. I think they are very competent. They are doing a good job. Yes. Look at this mess. Yes, I saw this. How is Anie getting successful? He was already successful before. She won many races. She is a good skier. Great skier, great skier. You have practically everything here, no. David, David. David. Everything is fine. It's... alright. I see you soon. = Bye. I felt very much to be _ obliged to leave... Before you woke up. But I intend to compensate this by spending the rest of my life... Seeing you wake up and go to sleep in our own bed. Can not imagine how I was excited... When I read that you will... When I read that you are going to go back to skiing. But I knew you would not settle for less. When I can join enough money... to visit you. You will walk to me... And to my arms. And we'll go walking together. With love, Buddy. He is wonderful. Yes it is. And you are a lucky girl. Is here the crippled sector? A.J? Mom, it's A.J.! Audra Jo! In the flesh. Look at you, on crutches. Queer, right? No, fantastic. Unbelievable. Come here, Josie. Come here. - How did you get here? I got a ride. How crazy. - Oh really. I took a ride with my therapist, his family lives here. And he is handsome. What do you think? I think it's sensational. - Open your mouth. - No. Good... I have to go. Do you want to see me again? Jill. Good friends are the ones who tell the truth. What do you want me to do? Stop trying? Who gives up? What do you want? The Academy Award? I want to walk. What is so important about walking? For God's sake. A three-year-old child can walk. Because I can not walk. I can not even move. So take it, Jill. Admit it. Stop playing heroin. I remember very well that you wanted to be a hero. At that time many people laughed at you. Yes. But I did not tell anyone who was going to climb Everest. Advice from a veteran cripple. You have to know what you are.  And say what you are. Before you set out to work with little... That remains of you. Audra Jo. What if there was nothing left of me in the end? So you'll have to learn to paint with your teeth. What happened to you? The same thing that will happen with you. There's only one thing that kills the cripples. It is not to value to themselves. You still have your arms, Audra Jo. Great, we go to the center of rehabilitation and I show... someone who has no face or a child in... a steel lung. Enough. So stop moaning the loss of your medals... Olympic and thank God for still having your head. Anything else is superfluous. - Audra Jo. - What? I could have won. Did you know that? Beaten or what? The Snow Bowl. The Cup of the Snow... Was not this tournament that ended your career? An iron disposition, to declare from the bed of a... hospital she will go back to skiing. They say that you will go back to ski. And you will. You will come back to ski. In the spring I was transferred to a hospital in Los Angeles. And that began work to find out what I had... and what I did not have. Now, deeper. Likewise, Jill. Now continue. Continue pulling safely. Keep your head to the front and keep pulling. I started getting familiar with words like extenders, Flexors, deltoids, trapezoids. And I exercised more than I have exercised in my entire life. Continue, that's right. So, Jill. Is very good. Very good indeed. Now, stretch very slowly. Slowly. Like this. - Hi, I'm Dr. Enders. Hi, Doctor. - I can save your time. - Ah yes. I have biceps, but I do not have triceps. Deltoids, but not pectorals. Just a little bit of pectoral on the left side... but not much. I believe it's a bit unusual , but it was a fracture... cross, so the left side is a bit stronger. Oh, yes. And how do you feel? I'm fine, and you? I want you to squeeze your fingers now. Very well. I want to feel pressure on my finger. It's okay. Push. Push. Not the arm, Jill. He's moving his arm. Great, try again. Push. - It's still your arm. - Right. Let's try more once. Ok. Now try not to look at your arm. Just look at the board and let's see what happens. Now, just worry with your shoulder. Let your shoulders do the move up and... and gravity will do the rest. Come on. That. More with the shoulder. We are going well. More strength with the shoulder, more. So. You can. - Come on, come on. - That. - Come on! - Continues! - Come on! - Let's go! - Come on! - Push! - Come on! - Do it! - How am I? - You look beautiful. Go there and see how I get the distance. Oh, it's wonderful. Where are the fried potatoes? - They are on your lap. - Can go. Hi. Enter. You look beautiful. - Do you think? Yes. Oh, Buddy, I miss you. I was homesick too. Can you kiss me? Are you okay? I am wonderful. I tried to write every week. Did you try? Well, I just tried. Want to see something exciting? If you want to show me. If you want to see it. That's what I came for, was not it? Go there and look here. Will not you need help? Are you sure? Go there and look. It's okay. Now feel. Come on, I'm waiting. Hold your breath and do not say anything. This requires a tremendous concentration. Come on, Jill.  I've been waiting for it for a long time. It's okay. Watch with attention because the hand... is faster than the eye. And neither broke. Did not you see what I did? It was the hardest so far. Jill. Are not you going to walk? Walk? - It's... I thought you were... No.  I will never walk again. Buddy phoned a week later. I never heard from him again. How about taking her home for a while? Physically she is more capable than ever. It would be a good rest before it was transferred... to the California Rehabilitation Center. That's another problem, Dr. Enders. She does not want to go to the Rehabilitation Center. Every time I mention the Rehabilitation Center... She says she does not need nobody to teach... How to sell pencils. What do you want? It's time for the injection. Injection of what? Of what you most need, my dear. Oh, my God. I do not believe it. Well, you'd better believe girl.  And get your ass off that bed. - What are you doing here? You have a coat? - What are you doing here? Taking you. Where is this bottle connected? She is permanent. Then she goes along. - Who is this? My only friend. Dick. I can not be removed in this way. Who said that? - The doctors. Well, doctors do not know anything. Dick! Listen, one more word of yours and I pat your ass. And I would not feel anything.  You'll be glad you do not feel it. Jesus, you are heavy. - You're totally crazy.  And you were not the first to notice. - Good morning. - Good Morning. Dick, please, watch out for the ladder! Dick, stop, please. Dick, this is crazy! Open up wings, it will pass a paraplegic. Buek, the signal will open. No one runs over a wheelchair. Will open! Open it, what will you do? What are you doing? It's okay. I have a few things to say to you. But she needed a little privacy. Why do not you say to your bride? Because I do not have bride, she did not want me. I do not blame her, because I would not either. Oh is it? For it is better to think twice... about this because you will get a damn job... To attract lovers lying in the drug of that... hospital bed, made a lot of clay. Ah, poor thing. And mourn rather than maybe... get some idiot like Buddy Weber... Feel sorry for you. Oh, you've talked too much. I've heard. No, you did not hear everything. Because I'm going to stay here... Until you get the hang of it.  You understood. I do not care about you not being able to ski. And it matters little to me - you can not walk. I do not care if you creeps around... made a gecko. This will not make me feel pity for you. You are too presumptuous, to think that I need you. I do not care if you need it or not. I have nothing better to do with you. This is a public road, come on! Oh, I'm sorry, I do not understand what you're saying. Do you want me to check the oil? Are you going crazy, boy? What the hell did you decide to do with my car? Move away from there. This is a particular property. You can not do this. Get away from that car, boy. Wait a little. The oil is low. What? I changed the oil last week. You are crazy, are you? Look here, boy. Put that in place. Or I'm going to get out of here. I will inform the authorities. I will sue you. This will not be _ like that, boy. Ready. Are not you going to pay me now? I want my money WELCOME JILL. GOOD TO SEE YOU. I get off the plane and suddenly we were surrounded by... a lot of men with machine guns. They thought we were spies. Wow, machine guns. Did you hear that, Father? What are your plans, Dick. I say about the future. Well, I do not have any. I live one day at a time. Jake, cut the meat for me? Cut yourself. We can not spoil it. That is her problem. As I said. I was sitting there in the woods. I did not know any of those people. They did not know what government I was. They arrested me for... -  I think I stayed there for a couple of days. Finally I got to go from  hitchhiking to Acapulco. - Take it easy, let's take it easy. - I'm afraid. I am holding you. There is no danger. Dick. Ah yes, look there. See? There is no danger. I think that's enough. Wait, Bill. Father, leave him alone.  He knows what he's doing. You have no way. You. You do not want to wet your hair, do you? They're already wet, Dick. They are already wet. Come on, extend your arms. Put your arms here. Like a boat. I'm scared, Dick. Dick. Dick, come here.  Do not leave me here alone. Please, I'm scared. Dick, please. Dick, I'm slipping. Dick, Dick! Dick, I'm slipping, Dick. Jill! Calm down, I got you. Is everything okay? Calm down. Are you okay? Ok. I'm sorry. Was inadvertently. It was not meant to be. I just wanted to see how you did it, that's all. Are you okay? Excuse me. - Because, Dick. I did not mean it. What do you think? I do not know. I already have the house all in the head. No stairs, only ramps. All things in the kitchen in low places. Up to the sink, 60 cm high. Yes. I can not have children, Dick. I already thought of that. I... I do not feel anything. From the neck down. So I do not know how we'll make love. Not only that we will do. You'll want more than me. The people of arranja. No, you were going to get tired. It would come out to give its turns with... No, never again. I'm going to get a job. I will not do that. For God's sake. Someone has to do this to me. What is it? You will tell me. Why are you so reluctant? - I know. There must be something... something that avoids... that I am so... = = Useless. It seems we have the same problem. Clear my nose. Okay? Only if you say you love me. I love it. I Love. I'm going to build that house. Okay? What if you do not want it... I can find another crippled to live there. It's okay. Are you listening? It is the bell of the Indian reservation school. - Which tribe? - Paiute. Do you know anyone there? No.  We had two in grammar classes, but... They were very quiet boys. Yeah, usually they are. Why did you ask? Have you ever been there? No.  You mean you lived in this city all your life... - and did not go there even once? - Never. Good, so I guess it's time for you to go. I do not understand. Why does no one help them? Because they are busy trying to organize... their own lives. Why do they stay in this place? Why do not they leave? They have no other place to go. The problem is the teachers, Jill. They pay almost nothing to those who teach... in indigenous reservations. So good teachers go to places like Los Angeles. But that is not fair. Many things are not fair, my dear. I at least had a chance. But those people do not have... the least chance. Mother, father. Dick let me fly the plane. - What? I left nothing. See if you do not get me in trouble. I did not, I swear. - Did you revise it? - To go away. Where? - Home. Are you leaving? You did not expect me to stay forever, did you? It will only be, for a while. Jill. Why did not you tell me? It was so fast. You will have to do the rehabilitation. I'm going to build the house. And in the spring... Spring is far away. Time passes so quickly. Dick. Do you want to stop? So you're going to make me cry too. It's good to have friends who can make us cry. Not everyone has friends who do this. Okay, you'll be fine. You will be fine. Take it easy, take it easy. Calm down, that. Calm down. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Okay? You are OK? Okay? Okay! Jill, you will love this place. It does not look like much with a Rehabilitation Center. If it looks like one more great party. It is one of the most participating. You will meet the other inmates, they are great. Fantastic. Well, they are strangers, at first. But as soon as you know better, will like them. Personally, this is Jill. Jill, these are Keny, Cookie, - Neil. Welcome to the circus. Bill, George... Pat! And there are Willis and Lee.  Lee Zadroga. Bill? Did you see the play he did? - It was Willie Mays! - Duke Snider! It was who? - Duck Snider! - Willie Mays! Duke Snider, right? Over the shoulder, over the shoulder. I think it was the Duke Snider! Charlie how can you compare a white with a black? I can, that's why I say it was Willie Mays. Jill was a famous person. Someone here knew that? What did you do, Jill? He did nothing. Her photograph left on the cover... From the magazine of popular mechanics. Yes. She was the cripple of the month. - Will do what, now? - I do not know. Try to be useful. Useful how? Try to teach. For example. And after that she will try to be a neurosurgeon. She was skiing.  It was America's hope in the Olympics. Well, she can hold the skis in the chair and go back to ski. And then, Jill.  Are not you going to say anything? Maybe she can not say anything without the press nearby. You know, it's a famous girl. Jill. On basketball court we thought of... fact that we were something. We always left the court very happy. And one of the guys from the team made a joke saying: Why are we happy? We beat a bunch of cripples. It's beautiful in this chair. I love this chair. It's a wonderful world! Hey, wait there guys. She's only been here for... a few hours, and therefore, we will handle, right? She's still wanting sympathy, Ken. You know sympathy in the dictionary... is not it? Between _ grave and suicide. They live in a very isolated world here. Newcomers are a threat. Especially those who come with great ideas. What is so great about wanting to teach? This has already been attempted. There is not a single school in the country that accepts a... teacher in chair of wheels. Why the paraplegics and the quadriplegics can not... nor sign up to get the certificate. - It's not fair. Of course it's not fair. But the world out there - imagine that if the feet... They become paralyzed, the brain also remains. So there is a lot of lost potential. People who swallow defeat because it is... tucked in so hard throat down... that do not swallow, are choked. With you not happened? Well, in a way it's much easier for me than for them. They will be paralyzed forever. - And you walk again? No, I'm going to die. They gave me a year of life. So time is so precious to me. I can not allow myself to lose it. And what do you do with your time? I am studying. University. I'm doing masters. And will it end? I will get very close. What are you going to do? With? Now, when are you going to start studying? They would not accept me. My gym notes were bad. Look, listen to something. When the body goes away, the mind can compensate. Do you understand this? It's like a blind man who suddenly the hearing gets sharper. I already understood. But how will they know? I'll tell them. I recommended Audra Jo and Cookie.  I can do the same for you. I can hurt you. My brain has always been the weakest muscle in my body. Then, force, exercise, place under training. Are you okay? Say you're fine. Ok. Uh, what a day. - Now it's my turn. - Oh yes. - Are they ready? - You are ready? Do you think I'm what, Tarzan? Look, the secretariat is there, just ahead turning right. Are you seeing those columns? It will be all right. You will see. - Will it? Of course. You have to stay calm. It's ok? - I'll carry the bags. - Right. - You can go. - It's ok. - What class. - Of course. You are next. Thanks. Ready. Come on, skinny. Let's see how much you weigh. Beware, huh. Come on, come on. Calm down, girls.  There's a way we can get out of this. Tell me which one? But what is it? A show of freaks? We should charge tickets. And that has an idea much more popular than in taught... When I was learning about this subject. Do not try to write down what he says, just the important points. Summarize or use single words if necessary. And the way we knew it was because a man... Called Goldsteen took a pipe and on the sides the paste... The most important thing started to happen... were the children. There were dozens of them in the  Rehabilitation Center. And I began to cling to them, and them, to me. Then, Timothy Tom was very skinny. But in the Christmas season. When everyone leaves... in search of a turkey, No one wanted Timothy Ton. And he was free. When you do a writing test, you have to... Write as a writer. Make each sentence say exactly what you intend. If you have a great idea, make a great sentence. If you have not, do not. Simple. You're right, John.  It really does look like a bouquet. But it is pronounced Bouquet. I like more of bouquet. Me too. But if you say so... Nobody will know what you're talking about. Because they do not write right. - This is complicated. Do you understand what I say? Jill, I wanted you to be my teacher. You know what. I really wanted to be. - Do not do this, Jill.  I have nothing else to lose. Yes. Faith in humanity. Are you wanting to lose your teeth? I put the denture. I can tell you what he's going to tell you now. He tells me in first hand. You all have been an inspiration to me. Absolute inspiration. You have been an inspiration to me. Absolute inspiration. The way you persist despite the shortcomings... It makes me feel good small, actually. We talked about the certificate of completion. I know. But unfortunately would be a waste of time. I can not grant it to you. I have all the time in the world. But my responsibility is to teach something... you can do. I can teach. I know I can. No school will accept you. Not without certificate of completion. Of course they will not. Not the certificate. Be realistic is your... is your disability. At that time, in my life.  My only handicap is you. I want you to know that how I feel. I am a man who, after all, likes challenges too. And what are these challenges? Ora... The position I occupied was a considerable challenge. In what sense? Well... I had to fight, and fight very hard. Do you know what it is to fight for a piece of cake? Try any time without hands. What does one thing have to do with the other? Ever tried to slide to the seat of a toilet... without using your legs? Without knowing exactly if is in the right place or not... for not being able to feel the porcelain underneath. Miss Kinmont. Do not try to flatter me. I'm just trying to show that... Have you ever felt an itch on your nose and could not... - achieve it to scratch? - Enough! Not enough, no sir. Do you want to listen to the respect of challenges? I teach you the meaning of the word. It's okay. You have proved your thesis. Let me introduce mine. Paraplegics are not accepted as teachers in absolutely... No school in this country. Unless you find one who wants to hire you... I will not allow you to receive the certificate of completion. Do you allow me to? You have my word of honor. The school I had in mind and that no one could imagine... It was the Indians' school there in my town, Bishop. I went there and said that if they wanted teachers... Qualified would have to accept me as I was. What did they say? They said yes. She's going to be the teacher. Come on. It was the beginning. I started a new life. You could depend on me again same time again and... open my way. Dick. Hey, are you okay? Yes, that's okay. I want you to come to my birthday. Your birthday? Is not it great for birthday parties? I have something to tell you. Speak! Can not, just say when you come. - I will not wait. You'll have to wait. Jill, help me to understand this. You make a long distance call... To say no-can talk to me. What is happening with you? Jill? Hello? Hello? Hello? Okay, I say now. I love you and I want to marry you. I will charge this. Do not start this party without me. Very well, Linda. Soft, like that. While waiting for Dick, I went back up the mountain. And there, in full snow station... I saw perfectly that life had gone on without me. Okay, you have to keep them straight, right? And work with your knees, okay? Who would believe that. What are you thinking about? That I am a lucky girl. Calm down. He'll be there soon, teacher. It will be difficult to call you that. - More gifts? - More gifts. But you will not open none of those present... while it does not arrive. Any sign of the red baron? Soda Springs Airport? I wanted to know if you can tell me when... Dick Buek took off. Two days? No. It's that we're waiting for him here... this morning, just this. I'm sure he will arrive. Thank you. HAPPY BIRTHDAY JILL. He is the best pilot in the whole world, do not you think? I'm sure he caught a storm. It should arrive soon. He really likes to scare people. Yes. This guy loves dramatic entries. Hello? It's him! It's Mr. Buek, of Soda Springs. He did not leave the house.  He must have come back. Yes. It's from here. Hello, Dick. It is Dick's father. He wants to talk to you. Someone takes me outside. Bobby, take me out there, please? - I'll go with you. - No mother. I prefer to be alone. Hello. Yes. This is Bill Kinmont. Oh, yes. I get it. I... I'm sorry. Very much. Yes, I tell her. Can we do anything? We loved him very much. We will miss you a lot. - Has anyone asked? You asked for what? - In marriage. - Yes.  If asked, why not accept. It's time for us to come back. Let's go, kids! Let's go! I try to avoid this, but sometimes, everything comes back to my head And when it comes back, I remember of the words that Dick Buek... He told me about the last time I saw him. How happy I am to have met someone like you. It's awful to have to say goodbye. Jill Kinmont is now teaching elementary school in Southern California She died in 2012 at 75 years old., - Engine room, chief still there? - Yes, sir. - It's the captain, put him on. - Aye, aye, sir. - Are you making contact? - Yeah, I'm making contact. Chief, the captain wants you on the phone. Chief here, go ahead. What's going on? Anything more you can do with the stabilizers? There's nothing wrong with the stabilizers. Besides, my hands are full with this pump! You know what the trouble is. It's that bastard Linarcos. Care to repeat yourself? He's standing right here. Good, I hope he heard me! All right, Joe, do the best you can until we clear this weather. - Where the devil did you come from? - From my cabin, sir. Don't you realize it's dangerous out there? You said come up anytime. Robin Shelby... ...remember? You picked a particularly fascinating moment to come here. The waves don't bother you? I've surfed up to 18 feet. - But these look more like 30. - Thirty-five to be exact. Some get up to 300. - I find 60 about maximum. Steady up. - Steady up, sir. - Bring her up. - Bring her up, sir. Hang on! - All lifelines rigged? - All except C deck, sir. When I order all lifelines rigged it includes C deck. See to it. Wow, surf's really up. - Master Shelby. - Yes, sir? We'll continue our discussion another time. Fair enough? Aye, aye, sir. That last one almost broached us, Linarcos. I warned you. We should've loaded extra bunkers in Gibraltar. We are top-heavy and when that pump is repaired... ...I am taking on more ballast. - Where next? - Mr. and Mrs. Rogo, M45. - Yeah? - I'm Dr. Caravello. You asked for me. All morning. - You the only doctor on this tub? - The only ship doctor. What if somebody was dying? Oh, my God, who's not dying? Most of the passengers are sick, Mr. Rogo. We have to take them in rotation. Use one of these now, another in 8 hours... ...and remain in bed until the sea is calm. Hold it, hold it. You mean we had to wait all this time for you to come... ...and give her some pills? And some crap about staying in bed? How do you know she's just seasick? Look at her! It could be something else. You didn't even examine her. Oh, shoot me, Mike. For chrissake, just shoot me. You see how sick she is? I'll tell you what this is. It's food poisoning, that's what. How is she gonna swallow pills when she can't even swallow water? They're suppositories, Mr. Rogo. You... ...don't swallow them. What do you do with them? I know what to do with suppositories. Just get them out of here! Oh, hon.... Nurse, I think we should continue with our rounds. I still think it's food poisoning. Oh, shut up. - Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Rosen. - Good morning. Don't fall over. - That Martin, he's crazy. - I like that man. Of course you like him. He runs on time like a train. You and trains. When, in my whole life, did I ever run for a train? Who cried for a week when they tore down the 3rd Avenue El? Yeah. He's lonely. That's why he runs, so you won't notice. Says here there's a package tour to the mountain... ...where Moses received the Ten Commandments. No. When we finally get to Israel, we're gonna stay put, no traveling. We're gonna get to know our grandson. Just think, he's 2 years old already. He's talking. We've never even seen him. Get down on your knees and pray to God for help... ...and then maybe everything will work out? Garbage. Not where I come from. You could wear off your knees praying to God for heat in February. And icicles would grow from your upraised palms. If you're freezing, you burn the furniture... - ...but you get off your knees. - Somewhat unorthodox, Reverend Scott. But realistic. John, the church is for more than prayer. With those sermons, it's a wonder you're still ordained. - Or are you? - The best kind. Angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade... ...stripped of most of my so-called clerical powers. But I'm still in business. - You seem to enjoy the punishment. - Punishment? The church has blessed me. Banished to a new country in Africa. Hell, I had to look it up on a map. My bishop doesn't know, but he's given me exactly what I wanted: Elbow room. Freedom! Real freedom. Freedom to dump all the rules and all the trappings. And freedom to discover God in my own way. Id better be going. I'll see you later. John. Still want me to give that sermon this afternoon? Well, one thing's for sure: Nobody will sleep through it. The weather report, sir. ""Weather moderate to the southeast. Barometer 1016 millibars. Smooth seas, clear skies. "" Good. Keep her on slow, start taking on ballast. Aye, sir. Full ahead, captain. As I've told you, we don't have enough ballast yet to run full ahead. I suggest we talk privately. Linus, start taking on ballast. I did not suggest full ahead, captain. As the new owner's representative... - ...I ordered it. - Damn it, man... ...the Poseidon is too fine a lady to be rushed to the junkyard. We're three days behind schedule and it's costing thousands of dollars... ...to maintain a wrecking crew. We dock Monday! I can't gamble with my passengers' lives! Your business is to deliver this ship when and where we want it. An unstable ship at full ahead is dangerous. Especially one this old. I'm sure I don't have to remind you of my right to relieve your command. Three other officers have their master's license. Now, order full ahead. You irresponsible bastard. Full ahead! Aye, aye, sir. Where did they come from? They boarded at Gibraltar. They're on their way to Sicily. A free trip for free music. They're going to a jazz festival. Morning after I can't take this. Give me a Strauss waltz. I rather fancy it. You? You even fancy bagpipes. Hey, did you know this? The engines on this ship have more total horsepower... ...than all the cavalry Napoleon used to conquer Europe. How about that? That's heavy, Robin, real heavy. The generator creates enough electricity... ...to light Charleston, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia. - Shelby? - That's right. - Cable. - Thank you. - It's my turn to open the cable. - Don't be so childish. ""Mother and I waiting impatiently your arrival. Our thoughts and our love with you on this New Year's Eve. Dad."" - We should've sent them a wire. - I did. Why didn't you ask me for my ideas? I mean, what to put in it. Why don't I have a brother who's easier to live with? - Stop jumping and go take a shower. - I'm going to the engine room. - You're going to church. - On vacation? - Will you get in that bathroom? - I want to see the propeller shaft. - You'll see the propeller shaft later. - Why don't you shove it? Don't you ever say that to me again. Shove it, shove it, shove it. God is pretty busy. He has a plan for humanity that stretches beyond our comprehension. So we can't expect Him to concern Himself with the individual. The individual is important only to the extent... ...of providing a creative link between the past and the future... ...in his children, or in his grandchildren... ...or his contributions to humanity. Therefore, don't pray to God to solve your problems. Pray to that part of God within you. Have the guts to fight for yourself. God wants brave souls. He wants winners, not quitters. If you can't win, at least try to win. God loves tryers. - Isn't that right, Robin? - Right. So, what resolution should we make for the New Year? Resolve to let God know that you have the guts to do it alone! Resolve to fight for yourselves and for others... ...and for those you love. That part of God within you will be fighting with you... ...all the way. Do you know what it means to be picked out from all the passengers... ...to sit at the captain's table on New Year's Eve? I'll tell you one thing it means. That your worries about other women looking down on you is bull. He only invited us because you're a detective lieutenant. Why don't you just go without me? What should I do at midnight, kiss the captain? Don't knock it. Why don't you admit the real reason? You're still afraid some bum will recognize you. That's pretty stupid! You're out of that business now. You're my wife. You can't go around afraid all the time... ...that every guy you bump into is a former customer! Linda, you hear me? Will you shut up? I'm busy in here! You weren't on the streets that long! How many guys did you know? You realize how slim the chances are... ...that even one of these characters is on this boat? You don't have to shout. I said... I said, do you realize how slim... I heard what you said! Mike. I saw a young officer on deck the other day. And he looked pretty damn familiar. Even with his clothes on. So he recognized you. So? Doesn't that bother you? If it bothered me, I wouldn't have married you. Well, first you arrested me six times! I had to keep you off the streets until you'd marry me! Come here, you lousy cop. Belle. Mr. Martin, what is the little green one for? That's alfalfa, Mrs. Rosen. It's essential to blood formation, neural function and growth. The growth part doesn't work. At least not with me anyway. And the yellow one? That's very attractive. A tocopherol, derived from seed germ oil. - It looks like vitamin E to me. - It is, Mr. Rosen. Doesn't that increase virility? That's the rumor. All you need is a pretty wife. I think I've been a bachelor too long. Sure, you're too busy taking all those pills. There she goes. My wife can't stand seeing anyone who's not married. No. - It comes from caring. - I'd like to be married, Mrs. Rosen. I just can't seem to find the time. I mean, I get down to the shop at 8, I open at 9. I close at 7 and go home at 8. Except on Wednesdays and Fridays, I go home at 10. Mrs. Rosen, when you see your grandson... ...tell him not to become a haberdasher. I know what you mean. We never went to Coney Island until we sold our business last year. You see? Mr. Tinkham, are you married? No marriage for me, Mrs. Rosen. I've got a mistress. - What? - The sea. Hey, that's good! From the seismographic station in Athens, sir. ""Sub-sea earthquake, 7.8 on the Richter scale. Epicenter 130 miles northwest of Crete."" That's the cat this ship is named after? That's right, the great god, Poseidon. In Greek mythology, the god of the seas, storms, tempests... ...earthquakes and other miscellaneous natural disasters. Quite an ill-tempered fellow. - Yes? - Sorry to disturb you, captain. - Please come to the bridge. - Right. Would you all excuse me, please? Duty calls. Reverend, do you mind taking over as host? - Glad to. - Thank you. Thank you, Acres. - Oh, by the way, happy New Year! - Thank you, sir. Where you two heading? Oh, Napoli, Roma, Venezia... And don't forget Torino. It's the first vacation we've had since we got married. And why we didn't fly, I'll never know. Well, since I'm in charge, I'm gonna propose a toast. Great. What will we drink to? To love. Hear, hear. To love. To love. - To love, dummy. - Oh. Tell me, sir, just what does a purser do? In spite of what you may have heard, he really runs the ship. Not the captain, the purser. You see, the Poseidon isn't really a ship. It's a hotel with a bow and a stern stuck on... ...and I'm the hotel manager. Susan, would you like to dance? - Hello, Susan? - Hey, Sis! I was just asking if you'd like to dance. Yes, I'd like to. That's a frightening target, sir, and getting closer. Seismographic station, Athens, sir. This is Captain Harrison, S. S. Poseidon. Can you give me any further reading on that seaquake near Crete? This is Athens. Epicenter 130 miles northwest of Crete. Duration 42 seconds. One aftershock, 3. 6 on the Richter scale, duration 10 seconds. First reports indicate a major bottom displacement... ...and heavy swell conditions building to the northeast, over. This is the Poseidon. Thank you for the information. Out. - Are we all battened down? - Tight as a button, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. It is exactly 50 seconds to midnight. Will you all please stand and fill your glasses? Mr. Martin, don't be by yourself tonight. Come, stand next to me. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, silence. Quiet, quiet, please. Ten seconds, nine... ...eight, seven... ...six, five... ...four, three, two, one. Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! It seems to be piling up in those shallows. - By the way, happy New Year. - Thank you, sir, same to you. - What's its speed? - Sixty knots, sir. It must be mountainous. - Lookout, see anything? - Nothing, sir. - Radar target port bow. Keep watch. - Yes, sir. Get my binoculars. Captain. Lookout. - What is it, lookout? - On the port bow... I never saw anything like it. An enormous wall of water coming at us. Oh, my God. - Hard left! - Hard left, sir. Close all watertight doors! Sound boat stations. What the hell is happening? - Sparks. - Yes, sir. Send a mayday. - Mayday, sir? - Yes, I said, mayday, mayday. Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is S. S. Poseidon calling. Manny! Manny! Manny! Manny! No, Manny! Manny! Hold on, Linda! - Manny. - Belle. - What? - Belle. Oh, Manny! - Are you all right? - I think so. - You're not hurt? - No, I don't think so. - Jesus Christ, what happened? - We've turned over. - It's okay. - Linda? - Linda, honey, you all right? - Hi. - Where the hell have you been? - Where do you think? Flying around on my ass. Please... ...help me. Help me, please. Teddy? Ted? Must go to the lifeboat stations. Soon. Very soon. Please... ...go to the lifeboat stations. Listen to me, everybody! I want you all to stay where you are. Help will be here any minute. This ship is equipped with watertight compartments. So just remain calm. Keep your positions. Help is on the way. - Sis! - Help is on the way. Susan! Susan! - Robin, are you all right? - Yes, sir. I'm all right. - But I can't... - Robin? Reverend Scott. Can you help me? What are you doing up there, Sis? That's a stupid question! - Are you hurt? - I don't think so. Just stay perfectly still. You wait right here. It'll be all right. Hold on, Sis. Over here, everybody! Listen to me, give me some help. Gather around. Pull it tight. Let's make a net. Tuck it down tight. All right, boys. Pull it tight. That's it. All right, hold on. Come on, Susan! Jump, we'll catch you! I can't! Don't be afraid! Jump! Trust us! Come on, you can make it, Sis! Come on and jump, Susan! You can make it. Susan, you can do it. Now, come on. - It's a cinch. Come on! - That's it, keep coming. Come on. Come on, jump! Sis! - Are you all right? - Yes. - Sis! - Okay. Listen to me, everybody! Listen to me, please! Please stay where you are! Reverend Scott? - Who is it? - It's me, sir, Acres. Could you help me down? I've injured my leg. Hang on, we'll get you down. Grab that. Pull it out. Grab hold. Excuse me, Reverend, my name's James Martin. - Isn't it better to go up? - What do you mean? It seems that any rescue would have to come through the hull. - The hull? You mean the bottom? - My God, that's right. We're upside down. We've got to go up. Acres, where's that lead to? To the galley, sir. - You stay there, we're coming up. - Wait. How do you figure going through the bottom? It's solid steel. Aft, sir, at the outlet of the propeller shaft. Kid, this isn't some toy boat, so you let us figure it out, huh? I'm sorry, sir, but Charley, the third engineer... ...he told me that by the shaft, the hull was only one-inch thick. Look, do you know how thick one inch of steel is? It's one inch less than two inches. We're climbing up! All of us! Is there a ladder there, or something we can climb with? No, sir, this is the linen service area. - Tablecloths? - Yes, sir. - We can knot them together. - Wouldn't be strong enough. What we need is a... Something like that, the Christmas tree. - Come on, give me a hand. - No. - You gonna give us a hand? - No. Didn't you hear the purser? He said to stay put and keep calm. Help will be here. - I'm staying right here. - There he goes. That's my old man. - Linda. - Everything by the book! - You stay the hell out of this! - You get your ass with us, mister. Hey... ...watch your language, preacher. You sound like you come from the slum! You son of a bitch, go help him! Okay, okay. Who the hell does he think he is? Clear the way! Come on, clear the way! We're gonna lift on three. Get over. One! Two... For God's sake, Reverend, that's suicide! We're cut off from the world. Maybe we can get to them. - Now, get out of the way. - Pray for us but don't do this! Climbing up will kill you all! Sitting on our butts isn't gonna help us either! Maybe by climbing up we can save ourselves. You got any sense, you'll come too. Grab hold. On three! One! Two! Up! Holy mackerel, it's heavy. All right, forward! Hold it! Let's upend it. Bring it up to your waist. Stand by, Acres! Good for you, Mr. Rosen. All right, come on, everybody! Push! - Come on, push! - Get the bottom! - Anchor the bottom! - Keep it up now! - Put some muscle into it! - Be careful there. - Keep it straight! - All the way up! All right, Reverend. - Come on, push! - Come on! - Come on, Rogo! - Catch it, hold it! Don't let it tip over! - Good. Easy. - That's it. That's it. Acres, watch out. - Stand clear. - We did it. Acres, can you anchor it up there? - Yeah, I think so, sir. - Good man. - Mr. Rosen. - Yeah? Get your wife. - Are you all fixed up there, Acres? - Yes, sir. Let's start climbing up. I need a monkey. - Are you game? - Yes, sir! Good boy. Climb up inside as far as you can go. Then come out and Mr. Acres will give you a hand, okay? No sweat. It's a cinch! Come on! - Now the rest of us. - So you get us up there, then what? Through the kitchen and deeper until we reach the hull. That way. Then you kick out the bottom and swim ashore, huh? Or yell, ""This is the police,"" and it'll open up. - Don't be a smart-ass. - Susan, you're first. You can't climb in a gown, so it'll have to come off. Okay? Go up the same way Robin did... - ...and don't look down. - Okay. Excuse me, Reverend, what about all those other people? I'll keep them moving. Try and get the others to join. Okay, Miss Rogo, up you go. - You have to take off the gown. - Like hell she will! - She can't climb in that, too tight. - She's got nothing under it! Just panties. What else do I need? What do you mean, what else? - Give her your shirt. - My... Come on. Linda... ...next time you put something on like I told you to put on. - How you coming, Susan? - All right! Good girl. Ladies and gentlemen, there's very little time. Please, everybody, you heard what the reverend said... ...he's taking us up to the engine room. - Please, everyone, come this way. - Mr. Martin! - We're staying right here. - Can't you see the logic? - What are you doing? - I want you... ...to give this to our little grandson, huh? Why? I'm going somewhere you're not? - Tell me something, Manny. - What is it now? How long you think since we told each other ""I love you""? Who knows? Twenty years? Yesterday? I love you. Not many people have had that. Put it back on. You'll give it to him yourself. - No. - Mrs. Rosen... ...we have to go right now. Mr. Scott, a fat woman like me can't climb. - I'll wait here with the others. - I'm afraid I can't allow that. Listen to him, Belle. There's something different up there than there is down here? Yes. Life. Life is up there. And life always matters very much... ...doesn't it? Yes. All right, so I'll climb. Please, Ted. You've got to wake up. We've got something we've got to do. You know how disorganized I am without you. - Wake up. - Miss? Miss? I think you should come with me. Leave him? Oh, I can't. I can't leave my brother. He's all I've got. What's your name? Nonnie. Nonnie... ...your brother's dead. Did you like his music? I would have danced to it... ...if I'd had somebody to dance with. Come, please. Come with me. Please. - Come on, Belle. - I can't! You can. It's just a little higher. I can't, Manny, I'm stuck. I'm stuck in the spokes! - Yes, you can. - I can't, Manny! I can't! What's happening? What is that? What's down there? Good girl. - Excuse me for getting so familiar. - What else could you do? Mrs. Peter Pan, I'm not. All right, Belle, let's get up. Come on, come on. That's it. There we go. You ready? - Follow her. - Wait a minute. - Don't you ever say ""please""? - If it'll get you up that tree... ...please. This is Nonnie, she's coming with us. - What about the others? - Nobody will listen. They have more confidence in the purser than in us. You help her up, Mr. Martin, and then you follow her. You didn't say what you thought of my sermon. - You didn't ask me. - I'm asking you now. You spoke only for the strong. I'm asking you to be strong. Come with us. I can't leave these people. I know I can't save them. I suspect we'll die... ...but I can't leave them. They don't want to go. They've chosen to stay. Why should you? What good's your life then? What's it all been for? I have no other choice. John, I'm not gonna give up. Can I have your attention? May I have your attention, please? That's the way out. - That's our only chance. - Don't listen to him! - We must stay until help arrives. - Help from where? From the captain? He's dead. Everyone above us before the ship turned over is dead. Because now they're under the water. - That's not true! - It is true, you pompous ass! There's nobody alive but us! And nobody's going to help us except ourselves. It's up to each one of you. It's up to all of us. Together. Now, for God's sake, come with me. I order you not to go! He knows nothing about this ship. - He's right. - Mind your own business! - God bless. - God bless you. Here, sir. Here, sir. Here you are. - I appeal to you for the last time. - You don't know what you're saying! I know this much: The sea will keep pouring in. We'll keep settling deeper. We may even go under... ...before we cut our way out. But it's a chance. We might make it. If you stay here, you'll die! We are staying with the purser! - Couldn't talk anybody else into it? - We're on our own. Let's get inside. Get them inside! Get in! Let's get to the tree! Hold it! One at a time! - Don't panic! - Goddamn it, get off my back! Don't panic! One at a time! Get off my hand! One at a time! Take it easy! Give me your hand, Reverend! Give me your hand! I'm going under! Help me, help me! I'm going under! I'm going under! I'm going under! Help me, help me! Please! Oh, my God! I don't want to die! Please help me! Please! Don't hang on me! Help me! Which way to the kitchen, Acres? This way, sir. What is that? Fire, sir. - That's a special fire door, eh? - Yes, sir. It's a safety door. - It closes at high temperature, right? - Yes, sir. So any fire would be out of oxygen... Smothered, wouldn't it? - That's the theory, sir. - Let's test it. - Get them to stand away from the door. - Hold it! Do you know what a flash fire is? I won't let you kill us! I'm going through that door, Mr. Rogo. You can either close that door behind me or try to stop me. Now, what's it gonna be? I always thought I was gonna catch it in some tenement by some criminal. Okay, open it. Move back against the bulkhead, please. Would you move back? Thank you. Over there. Here. Get back! Go on! Get back, all of you! Excuse me, Mr. Rogo. What if he doesn't come back? So, how the hell do I know? Well, we have to do something. We have to formulate some plan. Meanwhile, what do I tell the others? Tell them to bring out their hymn books and start singing. Get back! Get back! Okay. - Okay, what? - Acres. Where does the companionway by the kitchen lead to? Down to... Up to Broadway, sir. - What's Broadway? - Service way that runs along the ship. Does it lead to the engine room? I don't know much about below deck but there might be access from there. There is! - You again? - Sorry, sir. Robin, how do you know about Broadway? I went there with my engineer friend. He called it Broadway when he took me to the boilers. That's it then. - You're taking his word for it? - Why not? - He's just a kid! - Mrs. Rosen, no more Christmas trees. I'd be grateful. - Can you make it, Acres? - Oh, yes, sir. I'm fine, sir. Fine. - Get your brother. - Nonnie, come on. - Belle, we have to go. - Let's go. There's a lot of dead bodies in there. Don't touch anything, it's hot. No! Manny, the fire will burn us. We'll go back! For 30 years you've given the orders, now obey mine. We're going through! I'll take care of you! Acres, is this the only way? Yes, sir. We'll need something to pull you up with. Reverend, try this. Acres, you first. I need you. Rogo, give him a hand. Rogo, Rogo, Rogo. Mr. Rogo, put this around his waist. What I don't like about you, Scott, is your attitude. Or is it deeper? Maybe we're two of a kind and you don't like looking at yourself. Through those doors? Oh, no, that's the crew's galley. It's... It's that way, sir. - Get the rest of them. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. All right, grab ahold of this. - I'm surprised the lights still work. - Emergency circuit and batteries. Supposed to stay operational for three hours. They better. Oh, God. - Well? - There's no other exit from this area. There's gotta be. Think. You're all right, Belle. Go ahead, pull. It's okay, Mrs. Rosen. I helped my dad pull in a 600-pound swordfish off Hawaii. There. That's it, sir... ...down there. Right there. I think that's it, sir. - This leads to the central shaft? - It's what I've been told. - Where does it lead to? - I think there's exits on all decks... ...like this one. - It doesn't look very promising. - No, it doesn't. Okay, up you go. The water's coming in! The water's coming in! - There, grab it! - The water's coming in! Shut up! Come on, get up this goddamn ramp! We all can't be as composed as you are, Mrs. Rogo. Come on up here. - Hurry! Hurry! - Get the hose down here. All right, grab it! - Bring it down. - Come on! - Pull! Pull! - Get up. Don't panic, don't panic! All right, all right. - Rogo. - Yeah? - Bring them this way. - Everybody down this way. It's crazy. We're sinking! Nothing will keep us from drowning! - Keep moving! - He's right. - There are air pockets everywhere. - Air pockets? Yes. That last deck flooding doesn't mean this one will. - How long will we stay afloat? - Long enough. Andrea Doria stayed afloat 10 hours before sinking. You see, we've got a long time to go. Come on, keep moving. This duct leads to a vertical air shaft. Through that little hole? This little hole will get us up to Broadway. We've climbed four decks, two more to go. - This is the only way. - You expect a person to fit in there? Mrs. Rosen, you'll crawl through there, believe me. She has this illusion. Always thinking she's too fat. - Rogo, follow me. - I figured. It's me again, huh? Why? I'll need you when we get to the other end of this duct. - Mr. Martin! - Yes, sir? See that everyone gets in and follow at the rear. Oh, okay, Reverend. I'm going next... ..so if old fat-ass gets stuck in there... ...I won't be caught behind her. Come on, kids, you're next. Manny... ...if I get stuck, push. Don't worry, you won't get stuck. Watch your head. That's it. - Okay, Nonnie, you're next. - No, with you. With you. - Mr. Acres, would you, please? - Yes, sir. Come, we don't want to lose the others. You'll be right behind me? Like two peas in a pod. Quickly! Hello! Hey! Hey! Hey, in there! You follow me. And don't look down. Easy does it. Come on. Get your foot up on the ladder. That's it. Go ahead, you're all right. Go ahead, honey. I said, don't look down! Okay, okay. Thattagirl. Take it easy. This must be it! Bring them up! Don't lose your footing. Your turn, kid. Give Mrs. Rosen a hand. All right, come on. - How you doing, Mrs. Rosen? - Fine. I think I'm getting my second wind. How are you doing, Mr. Rogo? Fine, fine. Don't mind that. Don't mind that. - Just look up. - Manny, are you there? - Where else could I be? - Mrs. Rosen.... I didn't mean it to sound the way it did. I miss something? When I told you about Dad's 600-pound swordfish... ...I didn't mean that you weighed that much. With all that's happening, that's what you're worried about? Sure. What else? You're a good boy. Tell my sister. Watch your leg now. It's all right, Mrs. Rosen, come on. I'm coming. Press against my back. Push. - You go first. - All right, Mrs. Rosen. But don't... Don't go too fast. Manny, are you behind me? You haven't lost me yet. Up you go. Up, up. Keep it moving! Nonnie, you all right? I'm sorry. I can't move. I can't. Nonnie, keep your eyes on the ladder. Don't look at anything except the ladder. I'm right here. I'm with you. Do you understand? All right, now, one rung at a time. Just reach up your hand. Now, don't think of anything but the ladder. Go ahead, Nonnie. Come on, what are you doing up there, taking a coffee break? Move it! Please, Mr. Rogo. All right, Nonnie, now your foot. Step up. Step up. That's it. That's it. That's the one. The first rung's the tough one. Now again. Now again. Once more. That's it. All right. One rung at a time now. Now your foot. Now your foot. Keep going. That's it. Okay. Now the next rung. Those terrible explosions. - What's happening? - It's all right. It's all right. We're still afloat. Look! My God! There are others still alive! You stay here. Help the others out. I'll see where they're going. - Where you going? - We're following the doctor. Doctor! You're going the wrong way. You're going toward the bow. That's right, Reverend. Wait a minute. You can't get out that end. - Why not? - Because we're settling by the bow. The bow's underwater. Go to the stern. We'll exit through the engine room. - It's gone. - How do you know? The explosions. You must've felt them. The only way out is forward! Did you check the engine room? Did you see it? I don't have to. We're going forward. Please, come with us, Reverend. You're going the wrong way, damn it! We lost Acres. In the shaft. He fell. Where in the hell were you? What's that supposed to mean? I told you to keep everybody rounded up! - Mr. Rogo did the best he could... - You don't have to defend me. I've had just about enough from you. Who do you think you are, God Himself? - He was hurt and needed protection! - So he was hurt! The boat tilted and he fell! The shaft blew up! He's dead. That's it! Or do you want to make something more out of it? I said I'd get everybody out and, goddamn it, I'll do it! Mr. Scott, all those other people, where were they going? They're going toward the bow. But they're wrong. The bow's underwater! How do you know?! Have you seen it?! What makes you so damn sure about everything? If all those people think they're right... ...maybe we should go with them! Not you! That's brilliant! Twenty people decide to drown, so that's all right. That's typical. Everything by numbers... - Stop it, Mike! - He's been right so far. Wait a minute. May I make a suggestion, please? We'd feel more secure if you two would stop fighting! Well, what do you want us to do? I'm gonna make a deal with you. I'm gonna go to the stern, to the engine room. And if it's passable, we're gonna do it my way! If not, we'll go forward. You got it?! Preacher! You got 15 minutes. If you're not back here in 15 minutes, we're going the other way. You're on. Wouldn't it be a good idea to look around... ...try to find things we might need, like food or something? - Yeah, sure, sure. - Good. All right. Start looking, everyone, but stay in the area. Nonnie, let's take a look. Manny, wait a second. I want to ask you something. I'll follow Mr. Scott. Stay here. No way. I'm gonna help find things. Okay, but don't stray too far. Manny, have you still got your handkerchief? It's not very clean. Reverend Scott. Mr. Scott. Why aren't you with the others? I'm scared. I feel safer with you. You will get us out of here, won't you? Oh, you bet I am, Susan. You bet I am. We can't get out this way. But we went by a lot of other passages. We'll look down every single one until we find that engine room. Okay. Okay, come on. We're never gonna see our little grandson, are we? Now, darling, you have to think positively. We'll see him. We'll see him. If any of us are saved, I hope it's those two children. They still have their whole lives in front of them. Stop giving our lives away. We'll come out of this. All of us. Now you just sit here while l... Manny... ...you are a good man. You're such a good man. - Promise me something. - Depends. What? If I'm not back in five minutes, tell the others that I was wrong. Tell Mr. Rogo to do it his way. Understand? I promise, but you'll be back! I'll be back. Look at that. A whole new idea of cutting hair. Strap the customer in, push a button, raise him up, flip him over... ...let his hair hang down and snip, snip, snip. Yeah, snip, snip, snip. My brother, Teddy, has lovely hair. He's really dead... ...isn't he? I can't go on without him. I can't. Nonnie... ...you will go on. We do, you know. We have to. At first we don't think it's possible... ...but in time, believe me, in time... ...you'll find other things, other people. Someone else to care for. You'll see. - Brandy, rope, axe. - We found these. Good, good. Well, it's 17 minutes and he ain't back. - Sixteen minutes. - Let's go. - Can't we wait a few minutes longer? - What for? We're gonna move that way and fast. Mr. Rogo! - What's wrong? Where were you? - With Mr. Scott. We found a hatch he thought might lead to the engine room. So he told me if he wasn't back in five minutes to tell you... - ...to do it your way. - Come on, kid, pull yourself together. Goddamn it, that does it! We've been wasting time... ...while we should have gone up front with the rest. Wait! After all he's done for us, we can't leave without him. - You act as if he's already dead. - I agree. He made a deal! We're sticking to it! We're going up front right now! Let's move it! I found it! I've been there. Do you hear me, Rogo? I've seen the engine room and the way out. And it's this way. To use your words, ""Let's move it!"" Come on. Robin? Wait, where's Robin? Last time I saw him, he went that way. Wait, Susan, you take everybody to the hatch. I'll find Robin. - I can't without him. - Will you trust me, huh? You're the only one who knows where the hatch is. I'll find Robin. - That poor little boy. - Keep going, he'll find him. Robin, come here! In here. Up that ladder. - All right. Up you go. - Not without my brother. - Up you go. - Wait. - Get up there. - Robin! Oh, my God. Get him up here! Get up there, boy. Get up there. Sorry, Sis, had to go to the john. - What a dumb, stupid way to die! - I said, I'm sorry! - Where do we go now? - Down! Close that watertight door! Down? That can't be. I've been keeping track. We've come up eight decks. Each deck we passed flooded. Not the engine room. I've seen it. We go down! This is no goddamn engine room! Where the hell are we? That corridor leads to the engine room. - But now it's underwater. - So we'll swim. Give me the rope. - You're kidding! - She's right. The engine room's probably underwater too. It's in the clear. It's one deck up. I saw it. It's above us. I'll swim up a companionway. It's not more than 35 feet. Oh, is that all? We can do it. Believe me. I'll tie the rope on the other end. When I get there, I'll give a tug. Pull yourself along the rope. Take a deep breath. It can't be more than 30 seconds. - How long can you hold your breath? - I don't know. Do me a favor. Try it now. - Mr. Rogo, time him. - Go ahead. Look at this. I was the underwater swimming champ of New York... ...for three years. I held my breath for 2 minutes 47 seconds. - Let me do this, please. - You were 17 then. You've all been dragging and pulling me all this way. Now I have a chance to do something I know how to do. Please, may I do this for everybody? I'm perfectly capable of holding my breath long enough to swim 35 feet. Thank you. Hey, hey, preacher. Take a deep breath. - Anybody timing him? - I am. He's swimming through corridors and up and down stairwells. I'm the only one here trained to do that. Will you shut up! What makes you think you can do it? You can ask anybody in the Women's Swimming Association. Just because I put on a little weight doesn't mean I wasn't once an athlete. - What time now? - 39 seconds. - What? - The rope's not going through! - Maybe he's there. - Give him more time. He said he'd tug on the rope. What'll we do, goddamn it? What'll we do? Pull him back. Pull him back! Give, you son of a bitch! Give! Belle, be careful. Manny, you think I'm planning to be careless? What does she think she's doing? Let her go. She knows what she's doing. - She must have found him. - Oh, thank God. They must have made it. You see, Mr. Scott, in the water, I'm a very skinny lady. They're not tugging! Wait, wait, give them time. I guess I'm not the champion... ...of the Women's Swimming Association anymore. Hold on, Mrs. Rosen. Just hold on. Mr. Scott... ...enough is enough. Let me go. Please, let me go. Give this to Manny. Tell him he has to give it to our grandson... ...for both of us. You see, that's the sign for life. Life always matters very much. Oh, God. God, not this woman. Oh, God, not this woman. Something's happened. Belle would've signaled. - They've had enough time. - That does it. - I'll go find out what happened. - No, you'll drown too! - Let me go, it's my wife! - Let him go. I'm going through. All of you stay put until I come back. - Give me that flashlight. - Mike, please! Take it easy, baby, I'll be back. What the hell happened? You didn't pull on the rope. I got trapped. Mrs. Rosen freed me. Thanks, Mrs. Rosen. If it hadn't been for you, none of us... Oh, Jesus. Go back and get the others. - What'll I tell him? - Tell him nothing! Just go back and get them! You had a lot of guts, lady. A lot of guts. I'm okay, baby. - I'm okay. - Belle, is she all right? She got through. She saved Scott. She cleared the way for all of us. She got through. But something went wrong, didn't it? Like I told you, she did everything. Mr. Rosen, follow that rope! Something did go wrong. She got through. Now listen to me. I want you all to step up here, take deep breaths and swim along that rope. You'll be in the engine room soon. It is above water like the preacher said. You kids first. I can swim three pool lengths underwater, but Sis can only do two. Okay, kid. Now don't forget. Take a couple of deep breaths. All right, go. I can't swim. You can't swim? No, not a stroke. Now you two. Mr. Rogo, would you mind going? I'll help her. All right, but let's make it snappy. No horsing around! - You really can't swim at all? - No, I can't. - But you can hold your breath. - Yes. That's all you need. Start taking deep breaths and hold the last one before you go under. And hang on to my belt. I'll pull you through. No. You've got to, Nonnie. I'm not leaving without you. You really mean that, don't you? Why don't we stay behind? We don't have to follow the others. What will happen? - We might still be rescued. - Maybe, maybe not. You really won't leave me? I'm not going without you. I just have to hold my breath. - That's all. And don't let go of me. - No, I won't. - Ready? - No. All right, now we'll take three deep breaths and then we go. Belle. You all right, hon? Help! Get her! Get up here! Come on. Come on. I've seen the propeller shaft opening. We're almost home. Only we must keep moving. Now, come on. - You bastard, ain't you got feelings? - Now, look! Listen to me, all of you. Mrs. Rosen is dead. We can't bring her back. But what we can do is keep moving. That's what she would've wanted! So let's keep moving, come on! Get up! Get up, come on, let's keep moving. Come on. - You too, Mr. Rosen. - No, my place is here with her. God bless, Mrs. Rosen. Look, Mr. Rosen.... The last thing she said to me was: ""Give this to Manny to give to our grandson from both of us."" Your place is with the living. If you don't come with us, her death is meaningless. Now come on. All right... ...but you go first. I want to stay with her just a while longer. You got one minute. All right, listen. You see that red valve up there? Beneath it is the entry to the propeller shaft area. The propeller shaft is that silver thing. And this catwalk is the way we get up there. Now follow me. It's this way, Mr. Rosen! This way! We can't get through that way. We'll have to go up. Stay here. One more door and we're home! There it is, Mr. Rogo, just like I told you! - Come on! - The little bastard was right. Linda! You! Preacher! You lying, murdering son of a bitch! You almost suckered me in! I started to believe in your promises! That we had a chance! What chance? You took from me... ...the only thing I ever loved in the whole world. My Linda. You killed her! You killed her! You killed her. You killed her. Mr. Scott, the hot steam! It's blocking our escape! What more do you want of us? We've come all this way, no thanks to you! We did it on our own, no help from you! We didn't ask you to fight for us! But damn it, don't fight against us! Leave us alone! How many more sacrifices? How much more blood? How many more lives?! Belle wasn't enough! Acres wasn't! Now this girl! You want another life? Then take me! You can make it! Keep going! Rogo! Get them through! What are you doing?! Come here! Susan. Now. Get back here! You can't help him now. Susan, get back here! Susan, come here! Susan, come here! Get up here. Get up here. Come on. No. What do you think you're doing? You heard the reverend. He said, ""Get them through."" Well, go ahead. Get us through! It'll be all right, Sis. It'll be all right. What kind of a policeman were you? You've done nothing but beef and complain. Always negative. Always destructive. Well, now's your chance to do something positive for a change. Are you quitting, Mr. Rogo? Are you going out with a whimper? On your belly? All right, you, that's enough! Pull yourself together, Susan. Robin, take care of your sister. Go ahead. Nonnie, follow them. Are you coming, Mr. Rosen? Watch it around this door. It's hot. All right, now what? Dead end. Excuse me, sir, but I don't think so. - You don't think what, kid? - You see, sir, I tried to tell you. We're in Shaft Alley. Nowhere is the steel hull thinner. - This hull is only one-inch thick. - All right... Quiet! I think I hear something. My God, there's somebody out there! Hold it! Again. Hold it, hold it. Again. Stop it, stop it! It's no use! No, keep trying! Mr. Scott wouldn't have stopped. Let's go! Hold it, hold it. My God, there is somebody up there. The preacher was right. The beautiful son of a bitch was right! Look. Look! Get back. Get back. - How many of you down there? - Six. Is that all? Did you save anybody else? Anyone from the bow? No. Subtitles by SDI Media Group, He said four minutes precisely. Non, non, non. Quickly. Two perfect eggs this time, no? Ah. Hmm. Maybe. I blame the chicken. Why do hens lay eggs of different sizes? It's not you, mon ami. These are two perfectly good oeufs. Mr. Poirot... I've got three religions bent on riot. If you're going to perform one of your miracles, the time is now. Have the eggs. Allons-y! Poirot! Sorry for the, um... It is not the, uh... It is the imbalance of the... Right. That's better. Excuse me. Coming through. Make way, please. Excuse me. Please call for the accused. The rabbi... the priest... and the imam. It is like the old joke, yes? The rabbi, the priest, and the imam. Forgive me, I am Belgian. So, let us begin. In the Church of the Holy Sepulchre above us... three representatives meet under the supervision... of the Chief Inspector of Police to discuss a divided timetable for market use. One hour after this tense meeting... a priceless relic is found to be stolen. It is said, one of these three men has stolen it. The police find no pieces of evidence at all. I find one. On the meticulously well-kept wall of a fresco... a single crack from an indelicate climb... with a hard-soled shoe or perhaps a boot. So, ladies and gentlemen, we must ask... who stands to benefit from the crime. Our three holy men live humbly. They're thin-soled shoes poor. Sudden riches and rubies would be... too conspicuous, yes, to enjoy. They do not gain. At this point, we need an armed guard at the south gate. Thank you very much. No, the only one... who benefits from the theft and the unrest it causes... is a man whose office I had searched this morning... as I waited, I have to tell you, rather disappointedly upon my breakfast. Difficulty with eggs. You don't need to know this. A man who is paid lavishly to keep order in Jerusalem. I mean, of course, the Chief Inspector of the Police. A man who does not wish to lose a well-paid post... when there is discussion among the local peoples of self-governance... who does wear boots, and who, I believe, now does regret... inviting me to consult on this case. How dare you accuse me! Please, Sergeant... did you search the office as I asked? Uh, yes, sir. And did you find what I said you might? Uh, yes, sir. Just as you said. Merci. Halt! You need to deliver that, Captain. It should be through first thing in the morning. Very good, sir. Luggage is on board, sir. I won the right to escort you to your boat. To Stamboul, then? Will you be back to London straight off? I am tired, and I have earned myself a little holiday. I want to look at paintings and have too much time on my hands. You are staring. Does it stop? It's just... How did you know it was him, sir? From just a tiny crack on the wall. I have the advantage... I can only see the world as it should be. And when it is not, the imperfection stands out... like the nose in the middle of a face. It makes most of life unbearable. But it is useful in the detection of crime. But it's as though you see into their hearts and divine their true natures. And whatever people say, there is right, there is wrong. There is nothing in between. We must part here. Oh, no, sir, I'm to escort you on the ferry. Au revoir, mon capitaine. We must never meet again. Could you straighten your tie, please? Just a little. Yes. That is perfect. Final passengers, please! Oh, I'm sorry. Will be fixed soon. But, will it be fixed in time? We are working! I have a connection in Stamboul. Leaves tomorrow at seven. There's a very ill patient waiting for me in London. I am a doctor. Doctor. I am a doctor. I am shouting at you in English, and now I'm doing it louder and slower. Very silly, forgive me. May I help? Let me help. I know your mustache. From the papers. You're the detective, Hercules Poirot? Hercule Poirot. I do not slay the lions. Mademoiselle. Mary Debenham, monsieur. I'll forget a name but never a face. Not yours, anyway. You come from Baghdad? It's true. No detail escapes his notice. Your ticket. Ah. I might also ask you if you enjoyed your time there... as a governess? The chalk on your sleeve and the geography primer. A governess or a cartographer. I made my gamble. I always begin them with geography... and monster them till they have the world down cold. They may get lost in life... but I'll be damned if they don't know where they are. Well, our chains are free. Right on time. I feel so free out here on the water. I wish I could enjoy it. We should be out of this, Mary. Not now. When it's all over. When it's done. Then, nothing can touch us. Ah, my holiday begins here. I can see the soul of the city in these humble breads. The world insists on destruction, yet here... masterpieces are baked to order every day. Monsieur Poirot! Mohammed! Mohammed, my friend... you are an artist. Ah! My friend! Sorry. Here. Come, come. Don't mind us, we're just looking for a place to have a private argument. It should take some 20 minutes or so... at which point we will both come to an agreement, or at least I will. Monsieur Bouc! Poirot! In the kitchen? Well, of course, this man will sniff out a perfect pastry faster than he catches... a jewel thief. Mon ami! Now, I am no longer a policeman. I cannot bail you out when this goes badly, eh? This is my dear, old friend, the esteemed... Poirot, who I knew before the esteem. Hercule Poirot, this is... A prostitute. She is. I am. Bouc, you did not tell me you had famous friends. We're friends because I'm the only person who never asks him... any questions about his cases, because I don't care. And he never judges me for being a terrible person. Indeed you are. Madame, Bouc, please join me for a drink, yes? You only have me for an hour. I ride on the Orient Express at seven, official director business. Uncle pays me absurdly to stay onboard his gorgeous train... and far away from him... at the home office... consigned to wine and dine handsome officials for all eternity. There is an art to nepotism. And you are its Michelangelo! Mr. Poirot. Are you a prostitute as well? Certainly not. Is this man bothering you? He is about to. You are from the British consulate. I am, sir. It is the Kassner case. Why, yes. I was correct in certain predictions? Quite. I do not need to read the telegram. Oh, how fun. Did someone cheat, or die? Unfortunately, both. Someone has... interrupted my longing for rest. It appears that I must travel with you tonight, Bouc. Can you find me a cabin on the Orient Express? My friend... I may not be good for much, but I sure as hell can get you a bed on my train... in the dead of winter. Three days... free of care, concern or crime. You will love it. Mademoiselle, it has been a pleasure. Sir. Your luggage has been collected and your expenses paid. You will be met at Calais... and then escorted to Dover, and then by rail to London Victoria. I would like to formally express gratitude. Please, don't speak. You make it worse. Here's a tip for you, pal. Thank you, Mr. Marquez. I didn't even carry your luggage. Oh, I had a good week. We celebrate when fortune smiles, and we share the good fortune. Remember to say nice things about us Americans, huh? No! Hey, stop! Monsieur, bonsoir. For you, Mr. Ratchett, the best table in the house. Just here, sir. The very best table. No, I want that one. Hey, Masterman. You got everything? Kind of you to inquire, Mr. MacQueen. I do not make mistakes. Oh, my goodness! It's Count Andrenyi. Come, come, come. I saw you dance at the Monte Cristo. Could I take your photograph? Please, my face, no! Sorry. The Simplon Orient Express... with stops in Sofia, Ni, Belgrade, Vinkovci, Brod... with transfers to Bucharest, Zagreb, Trieste, Venezia, Milan, Lausanne... Dijon, Paris, Boulogne, Calais... with connection to Dover and London, leaves in fifteen minutes! This way, Michel! Precious cargo. I need a first-class compartment. Give special care to my friend, Michel. I want him pampered like a zoo panda. But Monsieur Bouc, we are fully booked. There's no space left. Then we make space. He can have the number eleven. The eleven is always kept open for official use. It's very comfortable. Eleven is taken. The Austrian professor booked it two days ago. There is not one first-class sleeper car on the whole train? Negative, sir. Second-class? There's no space left at all. Mademoiselle Debenham. Mr. Poirot, are you joining us? It depends who wins this debate. Have all the passengers arrived? All but one. Mr. Harris. ""All passengers must check in ""at least one half hour prior to time of departure... ""or their seat may be forfeit."" The half hour has passed. The seat is forfeit. Please take Monsieur Poirot's luggage to number three with Mr. MacQueen. Merci, Bouc. Enjoy, my friend. Welcome, sir. Merci. Number three is unlucky. Oh! Apologies, madame. I meant no disrespect. Well, you could try to mean a little. One thing about train travel, you're always knocking into somebody. It's wonderful. Though, I am looking forward to getting back. Travel is fine for spicy food, mosques, meeting men. But eventually, you just miss your own bed. I've been accused of husband hunting abroad. Well, I can't, in all honesty, deny it. I like my time alone, I do. But a lady has certain needs that deserve to be met if she has any money... and preferably, on a regular basis. Oh! Oh, my! Fire in the kitchen! Farewell, madame. Good evening. Bonsoir. Number nine. Good evening. Bonsoir, bonsoir. How you doing? Bonsoir. Oh. Excusez-moi. No, after you. Merci, merci. Ah number three. You are Mr MacQueen? Yeah. I think you might have the wrong berth. Uh... Sorry, is there a problem sir? No, no problem. The train is full. I think that we are, how do you say... ""bunkies."" Really? I am equally disappointed in you. This is nice. Come along, darlings. No. No. This? Why am I not yet unpacked? Five minutes to departure. Final call for passengers! Shall we brush you? What the hell is taking them so long? Soon as we get out of here, have them make up the bed. It's already arranged, Mr. Ratchett. No, I want the bed made. And bring my Dictaphone. Dogs on the table. Most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life. Yes, sir. I want you to get MacQueen... and have him bring every receipt from the Milan sale. I want you to get it done. Yes, sir. I want you to get it done now. Did I say get it done now? Right away, sir. ""Better watch yourself."" Your coffee, Mr. Ratchett. Who did this? I can't say, sir. Good evening, Mrs. Hubbard. Hello there, Mr. Masterman. Well, hello. Eyes linger any longer, I'll have to charge rent. I'll pay. Mmm. Have another drink. Are you insulted? Hmm. Disappointed. Some men have a good look. All they have to do is... keep their mouth shut, and they can take home any prize they want. Still, the mouth opens. Is everything all right, Mrs. Hubbard? You have a strong intuition, I know. My second husband used to say just so. Hold that, it was my first. Yeah. Brightest man I ever met. Face like a turnip, but I loved that turnip. It was nice to talk. Good night. Monsieur Poirot? Entrez, Pierre Michel. Voil. When you take supper... I will move Monsieur MacQueen into Monsieur Bouc's compartment. You travel first class, monsieur. Ah, impeccable. Merci. Bon apptit. ...and the eggs? Good afternoon. Ah, Mrs. Hubbard. Good afternoon. There we are. Compliments of the Orient Express. Thank you, Mr. Bouc. I am here for all of your needs. No, thank you. I do not drink. It does not agree with you? Sin does not agree with me. Vice is where the devil finds his darlings. We should no longer speak. Good afternoon. Monsieur. How about a apritif? I regret I have an appointment with the director of the train. He was gonna leave anyway. Please, sir. Madame, madame. Madame, madame. All settled in? Ah, merci! As advertised. And yet, the best things on the train are not food. You know there's something about... a tangle of strangers pressed together for days on end, with nothing in common... but the need to go from one place to another... then never to see each other again. Boredom plus anonymity plus a... constant, gentle rocking. With your hobbies, you will never amount to anything. God, I hope so. Hmm. Order me the fish. Um, exchange grouper for sole, escarole for the potato, and... the beef sauce for the velout. Garon, that sounds superb. The same for me. The Princess Dragomiroff. You know, if I ever were to marry for money, I'd marry for that much money. I brushed Dalia this morning. No, you tortured my darling doggy. I asked you to brush her. Are you still enjoying your Dickens? Very much, mon ami. You know, with your books and your capers, you are missing out on romance. Romance never goes unpunished. There was, uh... There was someone once. I would prefer, in the future, to be sat not with that man. Like should be seated with like. We are not alike. Not all of us are so concerned with the separateness of races, Professor. It is out of respect for all kinds that I prefer to keep them separate. To mix your red wine and the white would be to ruin them both. I like a good ros. Hey, how you doing? Would you mind... if I joined you? Dessert is an indulgence... and I feel kinda silly and stupid indulging alone. I am at my happiest alone. But... for a small piece of your fragelit, please join me. Oh, with pleasure. Excuse me, another fork? I've been trying to make your acquaintance, Mr. Poirot. Merci. I never ever sat so close to fame before. No, I tell a lie. Once, I was on a bus with Ty Cobb. Ball player, Detroit. Ah. Would you mind if I have the little curly bit at the top? You're an odd bird there. You're a strange, peculiar man. I am of an age where I know what I like and what I do not like. What I like, I enjoy enormously. What I dislike, I cannot abide. For instance, the temporary pleasantries before what is determined to be a business discussion. You're fun. All right. I would like to offer you a job. ""The avenger of the innocent."" It's what they call you in the papers. And you are an innocent? I'm a businessman. I'm an art dealer. I mean, I'm new to it. But my beginner's luck has panned out. Relics, antiquities. Rugs, weird. Orientals. I'm new to the game, so I got the amateur eyeball. But I got a little problem with these, uh... so-called appraisers. You can't trust a one of 'em. Some of my customers... they buy a piece... they find out that they're not exactly original... which is hardly my fault... if a Kashan silk scarf is a fake. Right? Huh? C'est bon. But I've managed to make a few enemies, is the thing. I got a few letters, people making threats. I think, most likely, it's the Italians. I sold them a set of Oriental carpets in Milan. And the buyers weren't so happy with the provenance. And they want their money back with interest, you know? Italians. A guinea's a guinea. And then comes along the genius detective. Me? Yes, you. Hercules Poirot. Hercule. Um... Here's what I'd like to do. I would like to hire you to watch my back... until I get someplace safe. It's easy money for you. And it's peace of mind for me, you know? I understand. Good. I refuse. I'm sorry? That's bad. Maybe I didn't make myself clear enough. You see, someone's out to get me. And I know I'm not the best guy born, not by a long shot. And if there's a world after this one, I will face judgment just like you. But... I ain't in no goddamn rush to do it. You're holding a gun on me? No. Not you. On the world. I exist in the world. Do not point a gun at me. How's ten thousand sound for a week? It's a generous offer, Mr. Ratchett. I must decline. Fifteen thousand? You didn't hear me. I decline. Oh, I get it. It's not flashy enough for the great Hercules Poirot, huh? No flashbulbs... You sell fakes to gangsters. You're suffering the consequences. I detect criminals. I do not protect them. So you say ""no"" to my dirty money. I say ""no"" to you, Mr. Ratchett. Business with the gun, right? Is that what it was? It is far more personal than that. I do not like your face. If you will excuse me. You liked my cake, didn't you? The cake was excellent. Have a pleasant afternoon, Mr. Ratchett. Thank you. Ooh! Cold. Hmm. Mysweet Katherine. My love. Mr. Dickens. Mr. Ratchett? Mr. Ratchett? It's nothing. Very good sir. Good night. Mrs. Hubbard? It's always Mrs. Hubbard. Mrs. Hubbard. Did we die? Ladies and gentlemen, the train has been derailed. Are you all right, Mr. Marquez? I'm fine. Thank you. You'll be safest in your cabins. Mr. Bouc will speak to you all... in the morning. Please, you will be safest in your cabins. Of course. Are we gonna die? Oh... MyKatherine. Mybeautiful... Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that our train is still unable to go anywhere. Yeah, except down. How long are we supposed to just sit here? Yes, someone must be doing something. Of course I am doing something. I am doing nothing. Precisely two hours and ten minutes ago, when we did not arrive in Brod as scheduled... the station master will have surmised our situation... and already dispatched a team to excavate the engine... clear our path, and send us on our way. Until then, I assure you... we will all be made warm and fed and comfortable. We could walk. We could die of exposure trying. I have a connection to make. My boat sails day after tomorrow from France. Without you, I'd wager. Or me in London. I hold you accountable for my loss of time, Mr. Bouc. Madam, you cannot hold me accountable for the weather. Of course I can. You're the one here. And my conference in Turin? And I was to meet at the auto factory in Sochaux. Yes, some things, they are in God's hands. It is not for us to say... if we deserve to arrive safely at our destination... or if, like Lucifer, we must fall. Breakfast for you, Mr. Ratchett. Ah, Bonjour, Mr. Masterman. There is a problem? I can't say, sir. Mr. Ratchett? Excuse me. That is cold air. Please bring Monsieur Bouc immediately, and also Dr. Arbuthnot. Good God! Touch nothing else, only the body. My God, this is horrible. First the snow, now... I'll have to meet with the police and make some statement in some grimy station. And a man has died. And a man has died. He was stabbed. Long, straight-edged knife. Multiple stab wounds, some shallow, some cut clean through muscle. Left-hand side or right-hand side? That's the thing. It appears the killer maybe closed his eyes and struck blind. Can you estimate the time of death? It's hard to say with the window open... but my best guess is between midnight and 2:00. But no one went in his compartment then. I sat in my seat all night. I would have seen if someone went in. It's impossible. Thank you, Doctor. Please, return to the dining car. Michel, secure this carriage. Poirot. I need your help, my friend. You have to find who did this. Please, I implore you, on behalf of the Orient Express. When the police arrive, we can present them with the case closed. You are the only one who can save me. Your faith touches me, mon cher. But I must have this rest. Well, think of it as a little beachside puzzle. That's nothing to your mind! You look up the antecedents of the passengers. You establish their bona fides. Then you do what you do. You... You... You... You sit in a chair and you eat your cake... and you think until the solution presents itself. What else are you going to do while we sit here in the snow? Without constant stimulation, your little gray cells will starve and die. You think that is what I do? I sit in a chair... and I have a little piece of cake, and then I come up with a great idea? I don't know what you do. I have my Dickens. Damn your Dickens! If we leave this to the police, they will choose a culprit... right or wrong, and they will hang him. Most probably Mr. Marquez... for no other reason than his name is Marquez. Or Dr. Arbuthnot for the color of his skin. You are the only one who can bring justice. Let me have a map of this coach. Of course. Every passport. Anything. Interviews arranged with all of our passengers. Evidence, order and method, until one culprit emerges. I do not approve of murder, my friend. Every day, we meet people the world could do better without... yet we do not kill them. We must be better than the beasts. So let us find this killer. What's going on? Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to, um... It appears that our bad luck has worsened. That is... A passenger has died on the train. Monsieur Ratchett. Looks like they got him after all. You assume he was killed? No, no. I just mean he was in perfectly good health. He had his enemies, that's all. Indeed, he did. He was murdered. Good God. Murder, here? Alas, madame. God rest his soul. Someone was rummaging around my cabin in the middle of the night. Nobody would believe me. What is going on? As we are snowbound, I have elected to take the case... and find for my friend, Monsieur Bouc, the criminal. And why you? My name is Hercule Poirot... and I am probably the greatest detective in the world. I will speak to all of you in time. For the moment... I must recommend that you remain in your compartments with the doors locked. I feel like a prisoner here. It is for your own safety. If there was a murder... then there was a murderer. The murderer is with us... on the train, now. The doors between coaches were locked at night, hmm? Absolutely. Done myself. The train's been searched. There's no one hiding on it or under it. We can therefore limit our investigation to the occupants of the Calais coach. Bouc, you will assist me. As the only traveler who slept in another coach... you are the only one who is not a suspect. Mr. MacQueen, is this really the time for drinking? My boss is dead. I'm out of a job, and you're looking at me like I did it. We make no accusations. You knew him, so from here we must glean the essential facts. Were you his relative? No, his secretary. Book his travel, order his steaks. The man ate more steak than I've ever seen in my entire life. He was in antiques. He had no qualification for it, not the eye or the languages. Truth is, he had no head for business, accounting... none of it. I took care of everything. How long were you in his employ? Twenty days shy of a year. Prohibition wasn't to my taste... so I found myself overseas, and in debt. I'm a lawyer by education... not disposition. I was downright awful at it. You were fond of him? I was fond of his money. Ratchett was crude... demanding, insulting, and most likely a felon. When did you last see him? It must have been just after 10:00. He called me in to go over our sales in Italy. Milan, the sale of forgeries? Yeah, yeah. He wanted to look over the accounts. I had to translate everything... as the contracts were in French and he didn't speak a word. And when we stopped at Vinkovci... I struck up a chat with the colored doctor, Arbuthnot. And we had a couple of drinks, stretched our legs. He had some... odd opinions about Stalin I had to turn around. I don't hold a man's race against him, but I don't often take to Britishers. When did your party end? He left just after 2:00. Did you know of any specific enemies Ratchett might have had? Gosh. Pick a number. He confided he had been threatened? He got a couple of nasty letters. I have them if you like. Some, anyway. He tore up the rest. Threw them into the fire. That's them. Merci, Mr. MacQueen. Uh, thank you. If we have any further questions, we will call for you again. Have you considered the Latin man? Marquez. Hell of a guy. And, well, you know, his kind... they don't have the same distaste for murder, historically speaking. You said you don't hold a man's race against him. I suppose... depends on the race. And he was doing so well. You think it's MacQueen? Too early to say. I admit, I cannot see him stabbing a man twelve times in a frenzy. Not sober, anyway. Who did it then? I do not know yet. It is time we ask. Ask who? The victim. He has twelve stab wounds and, as Arbuthnot said, they are patternless. If the doctor is guilty... he certainly did not let it influence his responsibilities. Hey, the watch. Stopped at 1:15. Now that agrees with the doctor on the time of death. Hmm. It is possible, yes. Certainly possible. I don't quite understand. I do not understand, myself. I understand nothing at all. If you look at these two wounds... they are powerful and deep, and yet there is little blood. But this was a frenzied attack. Lashing here and there. No pattern at all, just extreme violence. And during all this, our victim, vigorous and anxious and full of coffee... merely lies still and accepts death without struggle... when he also has here... the means by which he might defend himself. For you. Now, let us see here. Barbital. The Mickey slipped. Drugged him so he couldn't use this. And later around here, a lady's handkerchief. An objet de luxe, handmade. Boom, two hundred francs in Paris. And she even has an initial, ""H."" And our little friend, the pipe cleaner. Another clue. Yes, a riot of clues dropped most conveniently. Yet only one appears, however, to be perhaps genuine. And maybe this ashtray provides the accidental breadcrumb. A charred fragment of a note. An attempt, perhaps, to burn evidence. Merci, monsieur. We may borrow your equipment, yes? Thank you. Merci, merci. Now, I prefer to understand... why a clue is left rather than what the object is. We seek the truth from within, not without. In this case, however, I may welcome a little scientific assistance. You will adjust the flame. It's just another one of those nasty letters. You are mistaken, mon ami. This one has a secret to tell. Look. ""As a strong blood is on hand, you will die."" What does this mean? Come with me, Bouc. Let us fill in the gaps. This was never a beachside puzzle. I know the dead man's real name. It is not Ratchett, but Cassetti. I know that name. Then you will also know the name Armstrong. The Armstrong case? The story shocked the world. Two years ago... the renowned pilot, Colonel John Armstrong... and his wife, Sonia, woke to find their only child, little Daisy... taken from her crib as she slept. Desperate... the Armstrongs paid the ransom. But soon after, Daisy was found murdered by... Ratchett, who was Cassetti. Sonia Armstrong was with child when she received the news. The shock sent her into premature labor. Neither she nor her baby survived. How do you know this, Poirot? Because John Armstrong told me so himself. He wrote to me to ask me for my help. By the time I received his letter... it was too late. He was found dead of a gunshot wound. Self-inflicted. ""Daisy Armstrong's blood is on your hands. ""You will die for it."" Indeed, you did. Monsieur Poirot? Yes, Michel. Mrs. Hubbard wants to speak to you. I held her as best as I could. Ah, Mrs. Hubbard, I'm sorry to have kept you. You have a head full of steam and a mouth full of words. You're goddamn right, I do. What I have been trying... to tell you all day. The murderer was in my compartment last night. I thought I'd be killed. Turns out I might have been... only he got Ratchett instead. I woke up in the dark, and I knew there was a man in my room. You are certain it was a man? I know what it feels like to have a man in my bedroom. I told your conductor, and he wouldn't believe me. I said, ""Check the communication door ""between my room and Ratchett's. ""He must have left through there."" Sure enough, it was unbolted. I know I locked it... after what Ratchett said. He made a rather overt overture. Have you perhaps... heard of the Armstrong kidnapping? You couldn't avoid it. Morbid stuff. The child's murderer, Cassetti... died last night. Ratchett was the man. I told you, I knew he was a rotten one. You do believe me... about the man in my room? I'm aware you think I'm a silly woman. But I have proof it's true. It is from the uniform... of an Orient Express conductor... but it might have fallen from Michel's when he was in your room. I'm not missing any. I found it at the foot of my bed, on the cover... right where I slept. What do you call that? I call it evidence. Thank you so much, Mrs. Hubbard. Have you ever been to America? Once. Years ago, briefly. For what purpose? To confirm a suspicion. Which was? That I wouldn't like it. I was offered a post in Boston. Saw Boston, went straight back to London. Is that where Ratchett was from? Boston? I can't says I know. It wouldn't be proper... to ask. Carry on. I last saw... Mr. Ratchett at nine o'clock. I brought his coffee and hung up his clothes. You have a toothache, I think. I've got an extraction booked in London this week. Mr. Ratchett insisted on not putting it off any longer. He said he was tired of hearing my suppressed groans. This sympathetic Ratchett... was it his usual practice to drink coffee at night? Not at all. But he'd been very agitated lately. Said he wanted to stay alert, especially so last night. He found a letter in his compartment. Please tell me you didn't do this. If I were to leave something unpleasant on your pillow, sir... it would not be a letter. Coffee. Surely, such a... proper and precise valet... would never speak to his master as you did? Unless he knew his career was coming to a sudden... end. No mere toothache, I think. The lungs? The thyroid. Spread now to stomach. Same as got my father, five years younger. Months at best. ""Inoperable, I'm afraid,"" said the doctor. And suddenly, I wasn't... afraid. I would only do what I wanted from here on. I speak my mind now. The coffee. It appears that his cup was laced with barbital. You, of course, will tell me that you did not put it in there. Of course I didn't. When and from where did you procure the coffee and the cups? In the kitchen, sir. I ordered it at dinner to be ready at 9:00, and so it was. Anybody could have got a hold of it before me. Merci. Mr. Masterman. I'm sorry about the toothache. Merci. I love the little cakes. So, Miss Pilar Estravados, you are a missionary... but you trained as a nurse before you changed professions, yes? I owed it to God. You owed Him a debt? There were... indulgent times in my life... when I took more than I gave. Gerhard Hardman. Professor of engineering. It is science that will win back for Germany her pride. - Biniamino Marquez. - Mr. Marquez. Listen, I wanna be clear of any association with the crime... so please ask me anything. Anything. I never lie anymore. Did you leave your compartment at all last night? Only once, to get an aspirin. Mrs. Hubbard offered me something earlier. I declined at first, but when I couldn't rest... I went to ask for it. My conference is in Turin. I am the only Austrian to present, which means without me... the talks will be substandard. Then I escaped prison, and I bribed myself into the US... where I swore never to lie or steal again. You see, my friends, because when people trust you, they buy more. The Italians are cows. The Spaniards, sheep. The Belgians... I come to my room, which I share with the unhappy English butler. A fish. He groans a lot. But I'm sure he saw me sleep all night until morning. I should say... in case it is relevant... there was an embarrassing moment. When I went to see Mrs. Hubbard... first, I opened the wrong door. Oh, sorry. What time was this? That must have been about... Don't be sorry. ...twenty minutes to 11:00. This is interesting. As far as it is known, you are the last person to see Ratchett alive. Your business? Automobiles. I have three showrooms. I come to America with nothing. And now... If what you say is true, Miss Debenham will confirm it. But it is true. I would not lie. May it be possible that Miss Debenham left your compartment without you noticing? No. I sleep very lightly. The slightest sound and I bolt upright. I was surprised once. Never again. No, I didn't say I was a chauffeur. The photographs that spilled out of your luggage... there was a beautiful one with a little boy wearing a chauffeur's hat... visiting his papa at work. Who did you chauffeur? Miss Estravados, why do your hands have the calluses of a boxer? I do my work in dangerous cities... where I cannot be governed by fear. I trained to fight. But you do not trust your god anymore... since your surprise? No, in case He is busy. God is always busy. It's Masterman. A man dying is a man with nothing to lose. Bravo, Bouc. Except for the problem of Mr. Marquez... who has now confirmed that his bunkmate, Masterman... was reading in his bed at the time of death. If it were easy, I would not be famous. Next. Miss Debenham... you do not mind to brace the air? For you, we have the picnic. While you made my roommate suffer cramped quarters. I see. Choose the best location to extract the truth from each suspect. Put her off-balance and me, freeze. Clever. Will you write down your full name and address, please? A pale mauve, by the way. Miss Estravados told me you asked the color of her dressing gown. Merci. ""Mary Hermione Debenham."" Do you ever go by Hermione? A constant Mary, when I'm not employed as Miss Debenham. Left-handed. Unusual, I know. You mustn't have your theory fixed if you're testing my handwriting. What did you think of the dead man? Uh, I can't say I did think about him. I don't quite see the point of your question. Oh, forgive me, mademoiselle, my little originalities. Human nature is perverse in its complexity. To plumb it, it takes the right tools. These are toys, not tools, Hercule. I prefer you put them away. The direct method? Parfait. You knew the doctor before traveling? Dr. Arbuthnot? No. But such instant attraction? We are not in America... Miss Debenham. There are no laws against what you may feel. Nor are there laws against silence, of which... I hold my... I've never been to America. Perhaps I may ask about some... words I overheard? You and the stranger, Arbuthnot, are closer than strangers might be. You said... ""Not now. When we are done. Then no one can touch us."" What did you mean? You think I meant murder? To a man with a hammer, every problem is a nail. You live crime. You see evil every day. Not so. I see enough crime to know that the criminal act is the anomaly. I believe it takes a fracture of the soul... to murder another human being. I ask again, what did you mean? As we established... there are no laws against my silence. Very well. And afterwards, Princess Dragomiroff? After dinner, I came to bed. God blessed me with long life, but cursed me with a bad back to make it miserable. About a quarter to 1:00... I called for Frulein Schmidt. Mmm-hmm. She massaged me... and read to me for a while. - Then I sleep. - Mmm-hmm. Were you ever acquainted... with a family by the name of Armstrong? They endured an unspeakable tragedy. I was an admirer of Sonia Armstrong's mother... Linda Arden, the actress. A once-a-century talent. Miss Arden was to turn to directing. She would have become the first woman titan of Broadway... were it not for the tragedy. And this Linda Arden, she is dead? She might as well be. She no longer leaves her home. Daisy was my goddaughter. She was a... I don't see how this relates to our troubles, Detective. The man killed last night, his true name was Cassetti. The man who murdered little Daisy Armstrong. I see. I admit I know this family, and now this man is dead. The coincidence... must seem unbearable. You may be permitted a coincidence. I must now ask a few questions of your Frulein Schmidt. No. There is no need. I can answer to her character. Even still, if you will allow. Fraulein. Answer please in German. But her Excellency cannot comprehend me. That is the point. This is yours? H for Hildegarde? It is too fine for me. This is the truth about last night? As she said. She sent the conductor for me, then I returned to bed. Did you see anyone when you returned? Only the other conductor. ""The other conductor."" You mean Michel? No. A different one than had awoken me. Please come with me. Are you sure you did not see him? I'm certain. The other conductor was a small man with a short beard. Frulein, there is no other conductor. I know what I saw. I remember because his voice was high and the uniform was the same exactly. Though, I suspect, missing one button. Sir, I need your passkey immediately. We need to find a uniform and a red kimono. Thousands of photographs, endless pairs of socks... dressing gowns in every color but red... and still no contraband conductor's uniform. Have we checked all the passengers' luggage? All except for the Count and Countess Andrenyi, monsieur. It is forbidden to search their suitcases. They travel under diplomatic visas. Where else could it be? There is one last suitcase we have not checked. My own. The killer is mocking me. Good. His first mistake. And as the night must follow the day... Pardon, mademoiselle. No, it's not mine. I told you of the conductor. Why would I tell you if it was me? You would not... which makes your compartment the ideal choice to hide it. Voil, the button. And if a conductor's uniform... why not a conductor's passkey? Now we know how the killer magically passed through locked doors. Bourbon. MacQueen. Now what are we looking for now? 500 pounds. MacQueen also had a ledger. All his dealings with Ratchett. Where is it, hmm? Poirot? Bouc, keep everyone inside! Monsieur! Please stop! Monsieur! Monsieur! Please stay where you are. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. So, it was MacQueen? You have your man? Pardonnez-moi, madame. How could he? I didn't kill him! You tried to burn Ratchett's accounts... but they are still legible in places. The maths do not tally... because you have been stealing from him. It is full of the... - What is the English word? - The chocolat? Fudge? Fudge! It is full of the fudge! You stole from him! You thought you would be found out. That is why you killed him! Yeah. Yeah, you're damn right I stole from him. Thousands. I knew his money wasn't honest. What did it matter if I skimmed some off the top? But let me ask you a question. Why would I slaughter my cash cow? I didn't do it. - I didn't kill him! - He didn't. He didn't. I expect his alibi revolves around me, drinking till the early hours. Well, it's true. I saw him having whiskey, and remarked on the lesser quality of American liquor. He offered me a tipple to change my mind, then another. We got to arguing politics. He had some... tomfool opinions on Stalin I had to correct. But the man knows his spirits. A word, please, monsieur. You can confirm you were with him all night? We smoked and spoke till nearly 2:00, yes. Ah, such chums, him with his cigarettes, and you... Yes, you are the only man on the train who smokes a pipe. May I see your pipe and your tobacco, please? Of course. And you, Dr. Arbuthnot, were traveling from India, I believe. Yes? You're interviewing me now? Mmm-hmm. Were you ever in Ratchett's compartment before he was killed? Certainly not. But this is one of your pipe cleaners, n'est-ce pas? If you found that in the dead man's cabin, look elsewhere. I am a doctor, sir. I heal people. I do not hurt them. About this, see, you must have worked very hard to become a doctor. Not many of your race are allowed the opportunity. Middlesex Medical College permits one per class. I had the honor in '24. I was a sniper in my tour. A sharpshooter. Saved more than a few officers. The more grateful, recognized a fair mind with a steady hand... and supported my education. I take their generosity as a debt. Did you know a Colonel Armstrong? Might have known two or three Armstrongs. Tommy in the 60th... Selby Armstrong... No, I meant Colonel John Armstrong. He had an American wife, and his child was kidnapped and killed. Oh. Never came across the fellow. When did you first meet Miss Debenham? We met when we shared the railway convoy car from Kirkuk to Nissibin. She claims otherwise, and she has made herself problematically suspicious. Excusez-moi. Mary is a lady. Leave her out of this. I can vouch for her character. As you vouched for MacQueen's time? You won't listen to reason. Never. You are lucky. The good doctor insists he did not let you out of his sight. See? There. Couldn't have done it. Yes, you could. Ratchett took a sleeping draught each evening. You could add barbital, easily access that drug. Do the same with one of the doctor's many drinks... and the chance to kill him is clear. Why would I do any of that? We have established your motive. Perhaps I will suggest a different one. A different reason, a more personal reason. ""A lawyer by education, not by disposition."" Why did you pursue the law, I wonder? Was it to appease a much loved, but demanding father... one who himself had made a great success in the same field... and then lost his position? There was a renowned MacQueen, was there not? The district attorney for the state of New Jersey... responsible for the prosecution of the Armstrong case. They didn't have a suspect. My dad was pressured to go after this poor French woman... a maid with a weak alibi, Susanne. He hung his whole case on her. She killed herself. She was innocent. By the time the evidence lead to Cassetti, oh, he was long gone. They tore my old man apart. I couldn't do anything for him. And yet you claim that you did not know Ratchett was Cassetti? No, no. But you found him. No. You found him. You bled him dry... No. in order to settle your father's debts, and then finally, to settle the score. No, no, no. No. It wasn't... It wasn't like that. It's not the way... Someone kicked in the door... Doctor! covered my face. All right, this needs to come out now. I want my bag. Of course. It's in my compartment. There will be no fingerprints. The killer was disposing of the murder weapon. It'sthere! The killer didn't hit a lung or artery. She's lucky to be alive. You all are. Yeah, some genius! Why haven't you solved this case? You must give the man some time. Yeah, well... I can't give that much more. I don't have any blood left. Yeah. Accosting Mr. MacQueen, and the real killer is right here. One of you people. I don't know who you are. I said nothing. Please, leave me alone. Play something. My friends, the tracks will be cleared by morning. Please, return to your rooms. I'm sleeping here... where everyone can see me and I can see everyone. You should all do the same. Conserve heat. Remain in the open, safely in view, until morning. A killer will never hesitate to kill again. I will convey the same message to the Andrenyis... diplomatic immunity or not. If I may, I will look at your passports. You know that I must talk with her. By the way, there is a grease spot on your wife's name. You might want to look at that. Elena is not well. If you do not permit me, your reluctance will be noted to the Yugoslav Police... and I have no doubt that they will arrest both you and... How dare you! Darling! Darling. You are funny-looking, monsieur Poirot. Are all detectives so funny-looking? I am sorry to wake you, Madame la Comtesse. Hmm. I am always awake at night. In the day, I sleep. Some fear darkness, but I cannot stand the light. You are always under the influence of... Barbital. Barbital, barbital. I take oceans of it. Oh, there's no use in a lie, love. He can see right through us. I cannot go outside without it. I cannot sleep without it. I take it against my fears. What are you afraid of? Everything. Your passport has your maiden name as Goldenberg. Jewish, yes? Not so Jewish. My middle name isn't Maria. And you are a dancer like your husband? No, not like my husband. Corps de ballet. He is touched by angels. I have been shoved by passion and hard work to become adequate. Excuse me, I must lie down again. Is this your only dressing gown? No, I have another. Corn-colored chiffon. I like speaking to detectives. You never know what they're going to ask you next. I'm particularly good at capitals. My governess was a stickler for geography. Are you satisfied? I am always satisfied when I uncover a liar. Madame, your name is not Elena. It is Helena. Despite your clumsy attempts to change it here and on your luggage. My husband heard of a piece of evidence found... a handkerchief embroidered with an ""H,"" and didn't want my ""H"" involved. So we changed it. The luggage and the passport. It's no crime to want to be distant from trouble. Yet, here is trouble. A curious detail about the Armstrong tragedy at the heart of this case... is how many people were wounded by it. The younger sister. The actress mother... stage name, Linda Arden. I suppose she, too, was of Jewish ancestry... as who is most likely to take a stage name? Is it too far to suggest... her original name was Goldenberg? Especially when we find a young woman, the same age... as her surviving daughter... living in a world of fear? The sister of Sonia Armstrong. Get out! I hear noises and I run. Just in time, yes? You must now believe the count and countess are the killers. The count is protective. The countess would no sooner kill a bedroom spider. And you may desist with this charade. You are neither an Austrian, nor a German, nor a professor. But a good imitation. Was it based on someone you know? A local butcher where I grew up was a Kraut. Good man, great accent. What was it? You said ""Tur-in..."" the emphasis on the wrong syllable for a proud and proper Teuton. ""Tu-reen."" You are one sharp knife, I give you that. Herr Professor Gerhard Hardman... is my cover. I'm sorry about the colored folks cracks. Hell, I'm half a Heeb myself. Cyrus Bethman Hardman. You are a Pinkerton detective? 30 years. I was in Stamboul, coming back from a job, when the office cabled. Ratchett asked for a man to tail him, offering triple time. Lucky me being nearby. He told me to look out for a small, dark man with a high voice. I watched that hall... all night through a crack in my door. Any thug... had to go by me first. I'll take my oath on it. And would you also take your oath... on your thirty years as a Pinkerton Detective... or would you lie to me again... and deny that you were, in fact, a policeman first? Your gun, the checkered grip, the blue finish... produced for the Police Positive edition. 1927 issue. It appears there are no end to the lies manufactured just for me. You can leave your gun as you go, Professor. From the position of his cabin... it would have been impossible to miss. Unless Ratchett's door was open... as Pilar Estravados claims she opened it. In which case, someone could have been... masked from his view. My darling Katherine. This is an abominable crime... and I am stuck, ma Katherine. I cannot find the crack in the wall. Why does one of them elude me? I have always been... so sure. Too sure. But now, I am very humble. And I say, like a little child... I do not know. I am afraid, ma Katherine. My apologies, ladies and gentlemen. It is not safe on board whilst the engine is put back on the tracks. We are to wait in the tunnel. Thank you. Where are they taking the dogs? They'll be happy. That's not right. Just to stretch their legs, it's good. No, that's not right. It's freezing! Are we stuck? You asked for me? Another interrogation? Oh, no. I enjoy your company. Merci, Bouc. Uh, please. I have a list of ten questions I am no nearer to answering... and the train is about to leave. You have a clear mind... and I thought that you might produce an insight. Please. Hmm. ""The handkerchief. The pipe cleaner. ""The scarlet kimono. The uniform. ""The time on the watch. ""Was he murdered then? Earlier or later? ""By one person or more? ""Which of them?"" Sorry, I can't help you. Uh... Merci. Perhaps there is an eleventh question you don't know to ask yet... that will give you the answer to the rest. Perhaps. I could point an easy finger at the, uh, Countess Andrenyi. I discovered she was Sonia Armstrong's sister. Are you certain? Yes. I suspect she may perhaps be innocent. Perhaps. But so many people have lied to me on this train and do not seem to mind. You yourself did so effortlessly. Me? You told me you had never been to America. You also concealed the fact that at the time of the tragedy... you were living in the Armstrong household... as governess to their daughter. And you know this. I have my living to get. A girl detained in connection to a murder case... no decent class family would engage me. Miss Debenham, you planned Ratchett's murder. And then you sent for the countess to witness it. If she saw him dead, the Helena you knew might return. You waited for your roommate to sleep, but she did not. You drugged her. But the barbital only gave her a headache. She begged for an aspirin when the train stopped, when the conductor was on the station... when the coast was clear at last... when you were allowed to enter Ratchett's compartment, unseen. You loved Daisy Armstrong. You killed Cassetti. Cassetti was a pig. He deserved to die. She didn't kill him. I did. Mary, go. I can't let you take the blame... for what I did alone. Mary, please, go. John Armstrong was my best friend, my commander. He believed in me. He sent me to medical school, gave me a future. Cassetti destroyed him. In grief, I found Mary. Then I found Ratchett. Our plan was to reveal him to the police, that's what you heard. But when I saw his face... I knew he didn't deserve a trial. So, you drugged MacQueen. You changed the time on the watch... so that you could lie about the time of death. I couldn't let Mary be accused. Or MacQueen. My sins are mine to pay for, alone. I'm a soldier. A soldier kills to protect. And now, Mr. Poirot, I must protect myself from you. Why aren't you dead yet? Poirot? Gentlemen, stop! Sir, we need to get all the passengers back on the train. You will retire... away from the train... until I tell you to return. You tell your lies... and you think no one will know. But there are two people who will know. Yes, two people. Your God... and Hercule Poirot. It is time to solve this case. Dr. Arbuthnot asked me why I was not yet dead. He knew, of course, the answer. A sharpshooter who does not kill at close range? Your shot was not a mistake. It was a surgery. You could not kill me because you are no killer. None of you are killers. And yet, someone must be. There are two possible solutions to this crime. One difficult, because it fits with most but not all of the facts... and one more... complex. The first solution. Ratchett had enemies. A rogue Mafioso steals onto the train at Vinkovci... as MacQueen and Arbuthnot take the air. Equipped with a uniform and a passkey, he stabs Ratchett. He leaves through Mrs. Hubbard's compartment, and makes his escape. No. No, no, no. It doesn't work. Why hide the uniform, hmm? Who drugs Ratchett? Or stabs Mrs. Hubbard? Damn it, man! So I ask, who stands to benefit? This crime is the murdering of a murderer. The benefit is, perhaps... to the spirit, an ease of suffering. To quiet a shouting voice in the head that prevents sleep. There is a murderer among us. So... We have Dr. Arbuthnot, a dedicated, grateful friend to Colonel Armstrong. He meets and finds solace in the company of the governess, Mary Debenham... who is almost like a mother to the little girl. And so close to Mrs. Armstrong's young sister, Helena Goldenberg... married to a powerful man no stranger to rage and violence. We travel also with Daisy's godmother... to whom belongs... the monogrammed handkerchief found at the scene of the crime. The letter ""H"" in the Russian alphabet, of course, pronounced ""N."" Natalia Dragomiroff. And her devoted maid with a chef's eye? Who was she before her current employ? Might I suggest the Armstrongs' cook? But we are not yet done. The nurse in charge of Daisy... her newfound religious zeal born of guilt at allowing her charge... to be abducted. It was you, was it not... in her room the night when Ratchett came in through the window? Did you have a glass of wine too many with your supper that night? Have you blamed yourself ever since... for not being alert to stop him? She knew nothing but kindness... and love, until... until I... No need to divine with me, sir. I was Colonel Armstrong's batman in the war. And afterwards, his valet in New York. As fine a man as God ever made. Would his chauffeur agree? Was it a bank loan, secured by Armstrong, allows him to build his automobile empire? He's indebted for life. Who else can we count? What of the Pinkerton detective, once a police officer... assigned to the Armstrong case? And he becomes attached to someone, for there is another, uncelebrated victim. You fell in love with the maid before she was falsely accused. You quit the police when you witnessed... the travesty ofjustice... when MacQueen's father insisted on her arrest. When she took her own life. No! No, no! Susanne was so gentle. And she fell for me. Old and already getting grey. I told her she could do better... but there she was... on time for every date. Why else is a train... so full in the dead of winter? Why the inconsistent wounds? Why the abundance of evidence? Why...? Why the conductor? Pierre Michel of Avignon... who lost his sister... the accused maid... Susanne Michel. Only one soul can claim to have lost more than any of you. The tragic Linda Arden... mother of Sonia... grandmother of Daisy. Retired from the stage... but for one final performance. You're an awfully clever man. A murder should have one victim. When Ratchett kills Daisy Armstrong... a dozen lives are broken, deformed, ended. They demand justice! Of all these wounded souls, we must finally answer... who among them is a killer? Who takes up the knife? The answer is... No single one of you could have done it. Nor any pair. It can only have been done... by all of you. Together. Together. Even when the avalanche changes everything... as does the detective, plans must change. The kimono, the uniform. A remarkable improvisation, the doctor who knows how to wound without killing. Each has their part to play. Do it. It was my plan. I recruited them. I had Hardman track down Cassetti. I sent MacQueen to work for him, and then Masterman. MacQueen could arrange he travel on the day that Michel was on duty. Mr. Ratchett? It's nothing. Bien, monsieur. Good night. And so it is done. For the death of the innocent. A life for a life. Revenge. No one should hang for this but me. It was my plan! Tell the police it was me, alone. There's no life left in me anymore. They have a chance now. Helena, I pray... has a chance. They can... go live... find some joy... somewhere. Let it end with me. They're not killers. They're good people. They can be good again. There was right, there was wrong. Now there is you. I cannot judge this. You must decide. You wish to go free without punishment for your crime... then you must only commit one more. I will not stop you. You can't let them kill you. You give my body to the lake, and you walk away innocent at the station. You must silence me. Bouc can lie. I cannot. Do it! One of you! Don't. I already died with Daisy. No! You said your role was to find justice. What is justice here? Sometimes, the law of man is not enough. Where does conscience lie? Buried with Daisy. My dear Colonel Armstrong. Finally, I can answer your letter... at least with the thoughts in my head and the feeling in my heart... that somewhere, you can hear me. I have now discovered the truth of the case, and it is... profoundly disturbing. I have seen the fracture of the human soul. So many broken lives, so much pain and anger... giving way to the poison of deep grief... until one crime became many. I have always wanted to believe that man is rational and civilized. My very existence depends upon this hope... upon order and method and the little gray cells. But now, perhaps, I am asked... to listen, instead... to my heart. Ladies and gentlemen... I have understood in this case that the scales of justice... cannot always be evenly weighed. And I must learn, for once... to live with the imbalance. There are no killers here. Only people who deserve a chance to heal. The police have accepted my first solution to the crime... the lone assassin who made his escape. I will leave the train here to conclude formalities. You are all free to go. And may you find your peace with this. May we all. Hello. I'm looking for a Mr. Poirot. He's needed on a very urgent matter. Ah. He is on holiday. The, uh, Kassner case again? No, sir, far worse. I have to take him to Egypt straight away. There's been a murder, sir, right on the bloody Nile. Are you the detective? Yes. I am the detective. Could you please straighten your tie? I will see you at the car. Here you are, sir. Merci. Allons-y., FABER COLLEGE - 1962 Take off that beanie. - We're meant to wear them to homecoming. - Don't be a fruit, okay? Okay. Doug Neidermeyer, Omega membership chairman. Larry Kroger. This is my roommate, Kent Dorfman. Hi there. Doug Neidermeyer. These are our name-tag hostesses, Mandy Pepperidge and Babs Jansen. Hi there, Kent. Hi, Larry. - Welcome to Omega house. - Thank you. - Nice to... - Why don't we go meet some of the guys? A wimp and a blimp. There are many great guys here, so don't feel you have to meet everyone. We just want you to enjoy yourselves while you're here. Omega house has more activities... than most campus fraternities, is far superior... - Mandy. - Hi. Right there. Hi there, fellows. Meet Ken and Lonny. Larry. Ken, Lonny, I'd like you to meet... Mohammet... Jugdish, Sidney and Clayton. Grab a seat and make yourselves at home. Don't be shy about helping yourselves to punch and cookies. I'm not going to say Omega's the best house on campus... but a lot of outstanding guys figure they'll pledge Omega or won't pledge at all. We do have more than our share of campus leaders... something that never looks bad on your permanent record. Sure. Everybody says Omega's the best, but... I hate to seem... you know, pushy. Let the unacceptable candidates worry, because after tonight, they're... ...you are... Kent! I'm Greg Marmalard, president of Omega House. Meet my friends, Mandy Pepperidge... We already met. And Chip Diller. How are you? How are you? Over there is Terry Auerback, captain of the swim team. That's Carl Phillips, editor of the Daily Faberian. And... Clayton. Sidney. Jugdish, Mohammet, Lonny... - We already met. - Super! Then you'll have lots to talk about. - I don't think you're trying very hard. - I hate this. No sweat. My brother Fred was a Delta. That makes me a legacy. They have to take me. It's their law. Don't worry. I'll put in a good word for you. Great. I heard Delta's the worst house on campus. Excuse me, sir. Is this the Delta house? Sure. Come on in. Grab a brew. Don't cost nothing. See you later. And bump you $20. Hi, guys. You guys playing cards? You want another beer? Hi. - You want a beer, Larry? - Sure. Nice fish. - I'm Robert Hoover, chapter president. - Hi, Robert. Have you seen Boon? He disappeared when we got here. He's probably upstairs talking to Otter. No doubt. They're well-known homosexuals. Have another beer. She's just kidding. Right, Bluto? You going out tonight, Otter? Norma? No. Let me give you a hint. She's got a couple of major-league yabos. Beverly! No. But you're getting warmer. Let me give you another hint. Does this ring a bell? - ""Oh, God. Oh, God!"" - Marlene. You're going to pork Marlene Desmond? - Pork? - You're gonna hump her brains out. I anticipate a deeply religious experience. Why the interest in my social life? Where's Katy? Downstairs, pissed off about something. She thinks you're an immature jerk? Yeah. I don't take anything seriously. She'll take this seriously. Try it. - You guys coming down? - This thing talk? There are 50 people trying to get into this fraternity. Otter, you are the rush chairman. You should be present at the rush party. Hi. My name is Kent Dorfman. Eric Stratton, rush chairman. Damn glad to meet you. D- Day! Eric Stratton, rush chairman. Damn glad to meet you. That was Eric Stratton. He was damn glad to meet you. Larry, I see you've met D-Day. You're having a nice time. That's good. Eric Stratton. Damn glad to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice tie! Is that a clip-on? Boon, come check this out. Excuse me. Pardon me. Ninety percent rayon! Very nice. Hi, boys. Having a good time, I hope? Excuse me. - Did your mother buy that? - Yes. Kent is a legacy, Otter. His brother was a '59. Fred Dorfman. He said legacies get asked to pledge automatically. Usually, unless the pledge in question is a real closet case, like Fred. - My brother. - Kent, come over here. - I liked the tie. - Great tie. Katy. Eric Stratton, rush chairman. Damn glad to meet you. Katy! - Where are you going? - Home. - We just got here! - No, you just got here. I've been downstairs entertaining some kid from Pig's Knuckle, Arkansas. Maybe we could drive to your folks' place this weekend. Fabulous. My car filled with your beer buddies going up to empty my parents' liquor cabinet? It's too depressing to think about. Just you and me, and Otter and another girl. Is this what you're going to do for the rest of your life? What do you mean? Hanging around with animals, getting drunk every weekend? No. After I graduate... I'm going to get drunk every night. I think I'm in love with a retard. Is he bigger than me? Greg... what is the worst fraternity on this campus? That would be hard to say, sir. They're each outstanding in their own way... Cut the horseshit, son. I've got their disciplinary files here. Who dumped a whole truckload of fizzies into the swim meet? Who delivered the medical-school cadavers to the alumni dinner? Every Halloween, the trees are filled with underwear. Every spring, the toilets explode. You're talking about Delta, sir. Of course I'm talking about Delta, you twerp! This year, it's gonna be different. This year we'll grab the bull by the balls... and kick those punks off campus! What do you intend to do, sir? Delta's already on probation. They are? Yes, sir. Oh... Then as of now, they're on double secret probation! Double secret probation, sir? There is a little-known codicil in the Faber College Constitution... which gives the Dean unlimited power to preserve order... in time of campus emergency. Find me a way to revoke Delta's charter. You live next door. Put Neidermeyer on it. He's a sneaky little shit just like you, right? The time has come for someone to put his foot down. And that foot is me. Larry Kroger. All in favour. We need the dues. Good. Larry Kroger is now a pledge to Delta. Next slide, please. Just a minute! Just settle down! This is Kent Dorfman. He's a legacy from Harrisburg. Now wait a minute! Okay, this guy is a real zero. That's true. Think back to when you were freshmen. Boon, you had a face like a pepperoni pizza, right? And Stork here. Everybody thought that Stork was brain damaged. I myself was so obnoxious... the seniors beat me up once a week. So this guy is a total loser? Let me tell you the story of another loser. Get up! Let's go! On your feet! ""I..."" State your name. I... state your name. ""...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat."" ...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat. ""With liberty and fraternity for all."" Amen. Sergeant at Arms... do your duty. From now on, your Delta Tau Chi name is Weasel. From now on your name is Mothball. Kroger, your Delta Tau Chi name is Pinto. - Why Pinto? - Why not? What's my Delta Tau Chi name? Dorfman, I've given this a lot of thought. From now on... your name is Flounder. Flounder? We now consecrate the bond of obedience. Assume the position. Thank you, sir. May I have another? Thank you, sir. May I have another? Thank you, sir. May I have another? Now, what can we say... of John Milton's... Paradise Lost? It's a long poem, written... a long time ago, and I'm sure... a lot of you have difficulty understanding... exactly what Milton was trying to say. Certainly we know that he was trying to... describe the struggle between good and evil, right? Okay. The most intriguing character, as we all know from our reading, was... Satan. Now was Milton trying to tell us... that being bad was more fun than being good? Okay. Don't write this down, but I find Milton probably... as boring as you find Milton. Mrs. Milton found him boring, too. He's a little bit long-winded... he doesn't translate very well into our generation, and his jokes are terrible. But that doesn't relieve you from your responsibility for this material. I'm waiting for reports from some of you. I'm not joking! This is my job. Come on, Mandy, I would tell you. Are you and Greg doing the dirty deed? Greg doesn't believe in premarital intercourse. Too bad. I think he's just dreamy. And one, two, three, four... Company, halt! Dress that line. Dress that line, mister! Dress that line, soldier. Mister, hold my mount. You fat, disgusting slob! You're a goddamned disgrace! A vicious mother, isn't he? He can't do that to our pledges. Only we can do that to our pledges. Redo those buttons! Dress that belt buckle! Straighten that cap! And goddamn it, tuck up those pyjamas! Attention! Eyes front! What's that on your chest, mister? - It's a pledge pin, sir. - A pledge pin! On your uniform? Hooked it. Shit. Just tell me, mister, what fraternity would pledge... a man like you? It's a Delta pin, sir. Slice! Report to the stable tonight and every night at 1900 hours. Without that pledge pin! Do you understand? Your left arm is straight... but you're not keeping your head down. You're all worthless and weak! Now drop and give me 20! Get back in ranks! Always try to hit through the ball. I've gotta work on my game. Don't think of it as work. The whole point is just to enjoy yourself. I want you to fix Pinto up, but it has to be a very special girl. She should be decent-looking, but we'll trade looks for... a certain kind of morally casual attitude. Somebody he can screw on the first date. Well put. You see, Pinto's never been laid. What did I say? Don't embarrass me in front of Dave. He's the only professor I like. Mr. Jennings is a wonderful teacher. Teaching pays the rent till I finish my novel. How long have you been working on it? Four and a half years. Must be very good. It's a piece of shit. Would anybody like to smoke some pot? Yeah. You ever smoked before? Sure. When did you ever smoke pot? I've done a lot of things you don't know about. I won't go schizo, will I? There's a distinct possibility. Is this right? Try not to drool quite so much on the end of it. Hey, Paula I wanna marry you Hey, Paula Nobody else could ever do I've waited so long For school to be through I can't wait no more for you Okay. That means that... our whole solar system... could be, like... one tiny atom in the fingernail of some other giant being. This is too much! That means... - one tiny atom in my fingernail could be... - Could be one little... tiny universe. Could I buy some pot from you? Give me that. Yeah, baby. Good baby. It's all right. You stupid... Dorfman! What kind of man hits a defenceless animal? I've got a good mind to smash your fat face. Listen up, you nauseating pile of blubber. Your days are numbered at Faber. You and all your sick Delta buddies. Meantime, your ass belongs to me. Now, drop and give me 20. But... Hit it! Trooper, baby. Come here, baby. Cutie-pie. I want these quarters standing tall by 0900 tomorrow. You got that? Yes, sir. Brother D-Day, brother Bluto. You hate that ying-yang? - Who? - Neidermeyer. You hate his guts? - I guess so. - You guess so? Yes, I hate him! I hate his guts! We have an old saying in Delta. ""Don't get mad, get even."" Nice horsey. Good. Let's go. He's in there! Boy, is this great! Now finish it, Flounder. Are you kidding? I never shot anything before in my life. - I thought you hated Neidermeyer's guts. - I do. And the horse? Is there anything in the world you hate as much as that horse? Get it over with. - Just blanks, right? - Right. - Holy shit! - There were blanks in that gun! - I didn't even point the gun at him! - Holy shit! There were blanks. - Maybe he had a heart attack. - Holy shit! If you want the homecoming parade in my town... you have to pay. Carmine, I think it's wrong to extort money from the college. Look... as the mayor of Faber, I've got big responsibilities. These parades are very expensive. You're using my police... my sanitation people, my free Oldsmobiles. If you mention extortion again... I'll have your legs broken. I'm sure I can arrange a nice honorarium from the student fund. Another thing. You better sit on that zoo fraternity of yours. I don't want no drunken riots in my town. Don't worry. I've got those boys just where I want them. We'll have the best homecoming parade Faber's ever had. Mandy! - I haven't seen you since we... - Go away. I can only stay a minute. Let me buy you lunch. You've got your lunch. How about some milk? You got your milk, too. Can I just massage your thighs while you eat? Do I have to leave? Is this any way to treat an intimate friend? I asked you never to speak to me again. Will you go away? I do hope we're not interrupting anything. If you must know... - Eric was just leaving. - I wasn't. I could make you leave, if you... Bluto! I think you know everybody here. Greg, can't you... Don't worry. Just keep your hands and feet away from his mouth. Don't you have any respect for yourself? This is absolutely gross! That boy is a P-l-G, pig! See if you can guess... what I am now. I'm a zit. Get it? All right, you bastard. Let's go, right here! Why don't we go out tonight? Don't flatter yourself. It wasn't that great. Food fight! Oh, Greg. Look. It's a star. Let's make a wish. - ""Star light, star bright..."" - Wait a minute. That's not a star. It's moving too fast. It's probably a 707. Those babies really can move across the sky. Is anything happening yet? My arm's tired. I'm sorry, Mandy. That thing with the Deltas has me a little distracted. God knows how they've molested women. Anything? Maybe a little faster. Yeah. - How's that? - Yes. That Eric Stratton's lucky he's not in jail. I'll say. What? You'll say what? I'll say what? You said, ""I'll say,"" when I said, ""He should be in jail."" I'm trying to figure... If you're not even going to try, I'm going to stop. Mandy, I... - Good night, Greg. - Good night, Mandy. She stole your boyfriend? Her boyfriend. And not your boyfriend? Speaking of boyfriends, how was your date with Greg? Good night. That's it. She broke our date. - Washing her hair? - Dead mother. We're in trouble. The Jewish guys said our test answers were wrong. Every one? Those assholes must have stolen the wrong fucking exam! God, look what just creeped in. Well, well, well. Looks like somebody forgot there's a rule against alcoholic beverages... in fraternities on probation. What a tool! What was that? I said... what a shame... that a few bad apples have to spoil a good time... - for everyone by breaking the rules. - Put a sock in it... or you'll be out like shit through a goose. Yes, sir. Have you boys seen your grade point average yet? - Have you? - I have, sir. It's a little below par... It's more than a little below par. It stinks! It's the lowest on campus. It's the lowest in Faber history. Well, sir... we're hoping that our midterm grades will help our average. Laugh now... because you clowns have been on double secret probation all semester. - Double secret probation? - That means one more slip-up... one more mistake... and this fraternity of yours has had it... at Faber. That was pleasant. Nice of him to stop by. We must do something. He's serious this time. I think he knows about the exams. - He's right. - You're right. We got to do something. - Absolutely. - Know what we gotta do? Toga party. We're on double secret probation. We can't afford to have a toga party. - You guys up for a toga party? - Toga! Toga! - They like the idea. - Otter, please don't do this. I've got news for you, pal. They're going to nail us, no matter what we do. So we might as well have a good time. Toga! Toga! Toga! It's not going to be an orgy. It's a toga party. Honestly, you're 21 years old. In six months, you graduate. Tomorrow night, you'll wrap yourself in a sheet, pour grain alcohol all over your head. - Cute, but I think I'll pass this time. - Want me to go alone? I don't want you to go at all. It's a fraternity party. I'm in the fraternity. How can I miss it? I'll write you a note. I'll say you're too well to attend. It's funny. Very funny. Where did he get the wheels? From his brother. He's letting him use it for a week. Flounder's bringing his girlfriend up for the weekend. I am appointing you... pledge representative to the social committee. Gee, thanks! What do I do? Drive us to the Food King! Food King! Otter, please. - What are you doing? - Fixing your sweater. There you go. Keep them under there, and keep your sweater closed. - I could get in trouble. - That's right, so... be cool. Mine's bigger than that. - I beg your pardon? - My cucumber, it's bigger. Vegetables can be really sensuous, don't you think? No. Vegetables are sensual. People are sensuous. Right. ""Sensual."" That's what I meant. My name is Eric Stratton. They call me Otter. My name's Marion. They call me Mrs. Wormer. We have a Dean Wormer at Faber. What a coincidence. I have a husband named Dean Wormer at Faber. You still want to show me your cucumber? Nothing for me today, thanks. It looks like you gained some weight since you came in. - It's a prank. I'm pledging a fraternity. - Don't sweat it. I won't tell. The Delta Tau Chi house is having a party tonight, and you are cordially invited. I'm old enough to be your mother, almost. Besides, I have to go to the goddamn senior honours dinner tonight. Oh, well... Maybe some other time. Doubtful. Maybe? So if you're not busy, you want to go to a fraternity party? - Will I be home by 12:00? - Any time you want. I'll pick you up... My dad would kill me if he knew I was going to a frat house. Okay if I meet you there? Is it okay? It's terrific! Girls, welcome to the Delta toga party. Come in. Let me take your coat. Great pair of togas. Have some delicious Delta punch, and I'll join you in a minute. This is Sissy, my steady girl. This is the guy I told you about. You're even prettier than Kent said. What a great dress. - You two talk, and I'll get us some punch. - Good idea. He's really a lucky guy. Why don't we go sit down somewhere? I gave my love a cherry That had no stone I gave my love a chicken That had no bones I gave my love a story That had no end I gave... Sorry. - You look great. - So do you. I had to wait until my folks went out. Get me some more punch. I got a lot of catching up to do. You want to dance? Yes. Yeah, Otis! Gator! - Mrs. Wormer, I'm so glad you came. - Cut the crap. Give me a drink. - This is Hoover's room. - Yeah? It's neat. I think it's locked or something. Just a minute. Fuck her. Fuck her brains out. Suck her tits. Squeeze her buns. You know she wants it. For shame! Lawrence, I'm surprised at you. Don't listen to that jack-off. Look at those gazongas. You'll never get a better chance. If you lay one finger on that poor, sweet, helpless girl... you'll despise yourself forever. I'm proud of you, Lawrence. You homo! My fault! For Christ's sake, Carmine, how could it be my fault? One of those goddamn fraternities, I guess. I don't know, but I have a pretty good idea which one. I'm gonna string them up by the balls! I bet it was that Eric Stratton. You know that for sure? No, but... you'd be surprised at some of the girls he's had. Very surprised. It must have been some party. Unbelievable. A new low. I'm so ashamed. Almost sorry I missed it. - What did you do, human sacrifice? - No, just some harmless fun. Buy me a dinner tonight? Can't tonight. Busy. Busy tonight? Please take your seats. This meeting of the disciplinary council will now come to order. We'll waive minutes and proceed directly with charges against Delta Tau Chi. Sergeant at Arms. The following charges are brought: First, that the Delta house did knowingly violate... the rules governing pledge recruitment... by serving alcohol to freshmen during pledge week... and after established drinking hours. I'd like to address these charges one at a time, if I may. You'll get your chance, smart guy. Get on with it. Second, that for the fifth consecutive semester... Delta has achieved a deficient aggregate grade point average. Half the houses didn't make grades. You will speak when you're told to, and not before! Read. Third... that the Delta fraternity routinely provided dangerous narcotic diet pills... - to its members during... - That's not true! Not another word! ...during midterm examination week. And most recently... that a Roman toga party was held... from which we have received... two dozen reports of individual acts of perversion... so profound and disgusting... that decorum prohibits listing them here. These are the charges as recorded this day... 15 November, 1962. Faithfully submitted... Douglas C. Neidermeyer... Sergeant at Arms. - Well done. - Robert Hoover will speak for Delta house. I don't think you can fully judge a fraternity... without looking at the positive qualities of the people in it. The Delta house has a long tradition of existence to its members... and to the community at large. We've heard enough, Mr. Chairman. - I was told I'd have a chance to... - That's enough. The court will now decide. - You said... - He said that's it! Are you deaf? Let's finish this damn thing. Blow job! - I don't think it's fair! - I'll tell you what's fair and what's not! Eat me! - Tell those assholes to shut up. - Shut up, assholes! - Do we have to listen to this? - Point of parliamentary procedure. - Don't screw around. They're serious. - Take it easy, I'm in prelaw. - Thought you're premed? - What's the difference? Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be brief. What do you think he's up to? The issue here is not whether we broke a few rules or... took a few liberties with our female party guests. We did. But you can't hold a whole fraternity responsible for the behaviour of... a few sick, perverted individuals. If you do... shouldn't we blame the whole fraternity system? And if the whole fraternity system is guilty... then isn't this an indictment of our educational institutions in general? I put it to you, Greg. Isn't this an indictment of our entire American society? Well... you can do what you want to us... but we won't sit here... and listen to you badmouth the United States of America! Gentlemen! Order! You're not walking out on this one, mister. You're finished. No more Delta! You've bought it this time, buster! I'm calling your national office! I'm going to revoke your charter! If you wise guys try one more thing... one more, I'll kick you out of this college! No more fun of any kind! When my father was in Korea, he wasn't flying. He was in the infantry. He was an officer, of course... How does it feel to be an independent? How does it feel to be an asshole? What did he say? Hoover says we can't even enter a float in the homecoming parade. Some stupid zombies riding piles of Kleenex down the street? Look! Goddamn son of a bitch! I'll kill you, you scumbag! Jerk-off! Assholes! Jesus. What's going on? They confiscated everything, even the stuff we didn't steal. They took the bar! The whole fucking bar! Thanks. I needed that. Christ. This is ridiculous. What are we going to do? Road trip. You can't take the car! Fred wrote the mileage down! He wants it back by Sunday. Please don't take the car! He'll be very mad at me! Get in. Otter, don't you understand? He wants it back by Sunday! Fred's gonna kill me. This car is expensive! I'll get in trouble! We can have fun, but drive carefully! We won't tell anybody! I hear Dickinson girls are fast. What should I say? Mention modern art, civil rights or folk music, you're in like Flynn. - You sure we have dates? - Absolutely. What's the chick's name? Fawn Liebowitz. - She was from Fort Wayne, Indiana. - I hope I score. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Turn the car around. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Can I help you? I'm here to pick up my date. Could you ring Fawn Liebowitz? Fawn Liebowitz? Just a minute. Hello, Shelly? This is Brunella at the desk. Could you come down here? Now. A boy is here for Fawn. Thank you. - Is she coming down? - Her roommate is. Fawn isn't here. She... Would you excuse me a minute? Evening. I'm Shelly Dubinsky, Fawn's roommate. I'm Frank Lymon from Amherst, Fawn's fianc. Actually, we're engaged to be engaged. What's wrong with everyone here? Why don't we sit down, Frank? I don't know how to tell you... so I'll just tell you. Fawn's dead. She's dead? Did she put you up to this? That minx. What a lively sense of humour. ""Sophomore dies in kiln explosion""? - Oh, my God! - I'm terribly sorry, Frank. I just talked to her last week. She was gonna make a pot for me. If there's anything I can do... You're so nice. - I really shouldn't impose on you. - No, really. Anything. I don't think I should be alone tonight. Would you go out with me? I'll get my coat. Could you get three dates for my friends? Otter, holy shit! Otis Day and the Knights! I don't believe this. It feels so good to be back here at the Dexter Lake Club. We'd like to do a tune entitled: Shama Lama Ding Dong. So hit it! Wait till Otis sees us! He loves us! Oh, my God! It's dented! We are going to die. We're the only white people here. - Are you sure... - Don't worry about a thing, man. A double rock 'n' rye, and... seven Carlings. Otis! My man! You girls come here often? - Are you all right? - Yeah. This is really fun. I'm really sorry. I know what you must be going through. Would you rather be alone? - What are you majoring in? - What? - What are you majoring in? - Primitive cultures. I need you so much. I'm here. Move to your left a little. Good. Where do you go to school? I wonder where Otter is. Maybe I should go look for him. I used to touch Fawn this way. I know. She told me. She did? Do you mind if we dance with your dates? Why, no, not at all. Go right ahead. If I was in your shoes... - I'd be... - Leaving. What a good idea. Compose yourself, we got to get out of here! The Negroes took our dates! Oh, my God! Please be careful! This will cost hundreds of dollars to fix! Oh, my God! We're out. What baffles me is why Fawn would go out with boys like that. - They reminded me of criminals. - They were horrible. I think Frank was kind of cute. I really felt sorry for him. He started crying and... What did Katy say? She wasn't home. Where could she be at 6:00 a. M? - What's with you two? - I don't know. Something's wrong. Women. Can't live with them, can't live without them. You know where Mandy is? She was supposed to help make tea. Sure don't. She said she was just going to wash her hair. That's typical. Just when we're doing something important. I hate to see her make such a chump out of you. What are you saying? I'm saying that Mandy and Eric Stratton are having an affair. But I love you, Greg. That's why I had to tell you. Babs... I want you to do something for me. Good. I'm outta here. Katy? Good luck. Hey. Stop blubbering. When I'm through with this thing, you won't even recognise it. Come on, Flounder. You can't worry forever about your mistakes. You fucked up. You trusted us. Make the best of it. Maybe we can help you. That's easy for you to say. What am I going to I tell Fred? I'll tell you what. I'll swear you were doing a great job taking care of his car, but... you parked it out back last night, and this morning, it was gone. D- Day takes care of the wreck. We tell the police. Your brother's insurance buys him a new car. Will that work? It's got to work better than the truth. My advice to you... is to start drinking heavily. Better listen to him. He's in premed. There you go. Just leave everything to me. Hi, Katy. I missed you. I was going to call you... Where are they? Boon, I don't know what to say. Boon, wait! Shit. Must be in the kitchen. What's the matter? There they are. Are you sure, Babs? Why would Mandy want to see me? I'm sure I don't know. You'll have to ask her. As soon as you can get there. Well... Do you know the Rainbow Motel on Old Mill Road? Thank you very much. Bye. Teddy! Did you get the Deltas' grade reports? Yes. I have it right here. Why didn't you tell me? Good. It's ""Mr. Thoughtful"" with a dozen roses for... you... One, two, three, four, five. Looks like we're a couple flowers short, so some of you boys will have to... Where are the other two? Stratton and Schoenstein? - We looked everywhere, sir, but... - Never mind. It doesn't matter. You gentlemen seen your midterm grades yet? They're not posted yet, sir. I've seen them. Mr. Kroger... Two C's, two D's, and an F. That's a 1.2 grade average. Congratulations, Kroger. You're at the top of the Delta pledge class. Mr. Dorfman. Hello. Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life. Mr. Hoover. President of Delta house, 1.6... four C's and an F. A fine example you set. Daniel Simpson Day... has no grade point average. All courses incomplete. Mr. Blutarsky. Tell Mr. Stratton and Mr. Schoenstein exactly what I'm about to tell you. - What, sir? - You're out! Finished at Faber! Expelled! I want you off this campus Monday morning! And I'm sure you'll be happy to know... that I have notified your local draft boards... and told them that you are now all... eligible for military service. Well? Well? Out with it! Relax, honey. You know, I know, everybody knows that Otter certainly had it coming. I don't think the Deltas will be giving us any more trouble. Greg, honey? Is it supposed to be this soft? Christ! Seven years of college down the drain. Might as well join the fucking Peace Corps. My mother's going to kill me. I knew it. I can't believe I threw up in front of Dean Wormer. Face it. You threw up on Dean Wormer. Jesus Christ! What happened? You look grotesque! - Some Omegas danced on my face. - Who was it? It was Greggie and Douggie... - and some of the other Hitler youth. - What did you do? I don't know. They're just animals, I guess. Looks like I missed something. You did. We're all officially kicked out of school. Wormer just got our grades. They kicked us out of school? That makes sense. - What's this lying around shit? - What should we do, moron? War's over. Wormer dropped the big one. What? ""Over""? Did you say ""over""? Nothing's over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell, no! - Germans? - Forget it, he's rolling. And it ain't over now. 'Cause when the going gets tough... The tough get going! Who's with me? Let's go! Come on! What the fuck happened to the Delta I used to know? Where's the spirit? Where's the guts? This could be the greatest night of our lives... but you're gonna let it be the worst. ""We're afraid to go with you, Bluto. We might get in trouble."" Just kiss my ass from now on. Not me! I won't take this! Wormer is a dead man! - Marmalard: Dead! Neidermeyer... - Dead. Bluto's right. Psychotic... but absolutely right. We got to take these bastards. We could fight them with conventional weapons. That could take years... cost millions of lives. In this case... I think we have to go all out. I think this situation absolutely requires... a really futile and stupid gesture... be done on somebody's part. We're just the guys to do it. Let's do it. Let's do it! Go! Go! Go! Tommy? Hi. Hi. I'm Larry. Remember me? I took you to the party. Wait a minute. So how come you show up now? I didn't expect to see you. I never got a chance to say good night to you after the party. They almost pumped my stomach. Can we take a walk or something? - What do you mean, ""or something""? - I could get some beer. Not tonight, okay? Besides, you might get lucky without it. Before we go any further, there's something I have to tell you. I lied to you. I've never done this before. You've never made out with a girl before? I've never done what I think we're going to do in a minute. I sort of did once... That's okay. Neither have I. Besides... I lied, too. Yeah? What about? I'm only 13. Hi, there! Marvellous day. Excuse me, please. Pardon me. Off that mailbox! That's government property. Move it. Would you hold this? Thank you. My kid can't see. Can he stand in front of you? No. Hoover! Where's Boon? I don't think you should stay around here. What are you talking about? We all got expelled last night. What? Why? Where's Boon? Listen to me. I think you'd be glad later if you weren't here now. May I have 10,000 marbles, please? Testing. It gives me great pleasure to present... this ceremonial gold-plated whistle... to this year's honorary grand marshal... Dean Vernon Wormer. Mr. Marshal... the streets of Faber are yours. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Let's go. Sequence! Hut! Faber! Thank you, God! Those guys are coming pretty fast. - What the fuck's going on? - I don't know. Let's stop this now. Charge! Get up, you faggots! Charge! Stand up and fight, for Christ's sake! Faggots! Remain calm. All is well. Cut the cake! Look! Oh, my God! Let's take the cheese. I hate those guys. Ramming speed! Oh, boy, is this great! All is well! You can take your thumb out of my ass any time now. Remain... This may seem an inopportune moment to ask, Dean Wormer... but do you think you could give us one more chance? ROBERT HOOVER '63- PUBLIC DEFENDER BALTIMORE, MARYLAND Daddy! Mom! This is Larry Kroger... the boy who molested me last month. We have to get married. We should discuss this some other time, sir. LAWRENCE KROGER '66- EDITOR NATIONAL LAMPOON MAGAZINE Come out of there! Come on out, you bastards! Who is it? You know damn well! I'm sorry. You'll have to come back later. I'm doing the dishes. Look at my thumb. Gee, you're dumb. GREGORY MARMALARD '63 NIXON WHITE HOUSE AIDE RAPED IN PRISON, 1974 ERIC STRATTON '63- GYNAECOLOGIST BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA Bye! Excuse me. Pardon me.

BOON AND KATY - MARRIED 1964 DIVORCED 1969 BARBARA SUE JANSEN '63- TOUR GUIDE UNIVERSAL STUDIOS, HOLLYWOOD SENATOR & MRS. JOHN BLUTARSKY WASHINGTON, D.C., P. A.: Attention. Attention, please. Continental Airlines announces the departure... of flight three for Los Angeles and Honolulu at gate 28- the blue concourse. Global 45, Lincoln Tower. Clear to land. Runway two-niner. Wind: 15, gusting 25. Roger. Cleared to land. Runway in sight. Lincoln Tower from Global 45. We cut the taxiway short. We're stuck in the snow. Please notify company dispatch. We'll need assistance. We've got a condition four on two-niner at taxiway Echo. Change traffic to runway 22. Two-niner's closed. Trans World 729, a change. Taxi to runway 22. Runway two-niner is closed. Air Canada ninety-niner, hold short of taxiway Bravo. Emergency equipment will pass to your left. Runway two-niner closed account of disabled aircraft. 22. Approach. Runway two-niner is closed. We'll stay with 22 with everything. Global 10, clear for takeoff. For this food and your bounteous goodness, we give thanks to thee in the name of-Jesus Christ! Mel, I'm glad I caught you before you got away. Yeah. We just lost runway two-niner. Tail's sticking out on the runway 20 yards. I don't know. Could be a long time. I'll go out there. Bakersfeld. Mel, Tanya. How about some coffee? -I just found something. -I just lost something. Runway two-niner. Oh, no. Snow? One of your jockeys missed a turnoff, buried the wheel. No one told us. It just happened. I'm on my way. Any casualties? Just me. There's bound to be a $50 wrenched back. I'd better bring some release forms... and plenty of sympathy and understanding. -May I ride with you? -See you downstairs. P. A.: Mr. Bakersfeld, white phone. Urgent. Bakersfeld. Where the hell are you? We've got an emergency on the field. You said you'd be home at 6:00. You promised me a week ago you wouldn't miss this dinner. I didn't know we'd have the worst storm in six years. You've always got some damn excuse. I'll call you back. Let me take that, ma'am. You'll be warmer in the bus. I'm sorry this happened. Captain wants to take off all the weight, hook the nose gear, and tow it out. The nose gear would never stand the strain. That's what I said. Maybe use pneumatic bags and lift the wings. Could take until tomorrow. I want it cleared tonight. Tonight? Look, I know you're trying, but if I can get Patroni from TA, will you object? Joe can have all the tries he wants. Mr. Bakersfeld! Yes? Snow desk! -Yes, Danny? -I'm calling Patroni. -Stand by on mobile phone. -Roger. -Hello, Joe. -Hi, Mel. Danny gave me the poop. Tonight I am not available. Joe, I got 14 on the ground and 18 stacked upstairs. I've got 5 kids at my mother's so me and Marie could be alone. Tell Marie I'm sorry, but I need two-niner badly. Can't Global handle it? They're deciding now what to do, but I need somebody who knows, a genius like Patroni. Hold the whipped cream. I've just had dessert. -All right, I'll be there. -Good. In the meantime, give everybody a shovel. Start digging an incline in front of the wheels. -Right. -Out. Aw, Joe. Do you have to go to work tonight? They're not called emergencies anymore. They're called Patronis. I suppose you'll be late, huh? I'll be back in time. I'll pull that plane out with my teeth. What's this you've found? Your brother-in-law was on the snow clearance committee. Here's the report. It says the airport, meaning me, has been inefficient... -in snow clearance- -Grossly inefficient. causing flight delays, loss of revenue to airlines, et cetera. Signed Captain Vernon Demerest, Chairman. How can he say this? Because he's a no-good, irresponsible louse... who'll take every opportunity to knife me. Mobile One, snow desk. Where are you? At the ramp. Mel, Commissioner Ackerman wants you at the terminal. Trouble. I'm on my way. Close down runway 22. Close down runway 22. Keep moving, please. -Close down runway 22. -Keep moving, please. Close down runway 22. They'll break it up after the TV cameras get a few shots. TV? A lawyer arranged for news coverage. That's all we need. I'd better get in touch with the other commissioners. Afterwards you and I will meet and figure something out... to calm those people down. I'll call you. WOMel! Hi, Sis. I thought Vern was on flight two. He is. Sure here early enough. With the weather and traffic, Vernon didn't want to be late, but we just sailed right along. I thought they were pilots picketing you. I was set to join them. I heard about your report. Besides everything else, now you're an authority on snow clearance? I call them as I see them. You need an eye check. Clearing those runways and taxiways is the equivalent... of 700 miles of two-lane highway. And I'll bet you measured every foot of it all by yourself. We've had 10 inches of snow in 24 hours. Anchorage had twice as much, and they're clean. They've got twice the equipment. Then get some more. This isn't Alaska. You don't spend $2 million... for machinery you'd use once in 10 years. You buy for average snowfall. In an emergency, you work around the clock. Sitting behind that desk, you think like a bookkeeper. I didn't always fly a desk. All right, Daddy, tell me all about when you were a war hero. You flew pursuit and could land in a parking lot. When I'm setting down over 200,000 pounds of 707, I want something under my wheels that's plenty long and dry. It'll be dry tonight, but not too long. 29 is closed. The pilot from your flight made a shortcut across the field. He didn't make it. What are you doing? When the snow melts, we'll get it out. What do you think I'm doing?! Now, stop that, both of you! It's a waste of time arguing with a penguin. Good-bye. Have a good flight. What should I bring you from Rome? Just yourself. If you have time, I could use some white gloves. Size 61/2, right? No. I'm the one who wears size 71/2. Hey, that's a good idea, Mel- using little old ladies for skycaps. You're doing a good job. Mel. For my sake, be patient with him, hmm? How can you live with that overage juvenile delinquent? If I left him, what would I have? What if he decided to leave you? He won't. A girl gets serious, he waves his wedding ring like a flag. I'm his disaster insurance. More like group insurance. Thanks for caring, Mel. Don't worry. Someday he'll come home... for something other than a change of clothes. I hope so. That's for me. Good-bye. Bakersfeld. No, no. I'll take care of it. Vern! We don't have time. I have a cab. We can make the airport in 15 minutes. The driver will wait. His meter's running, and so is mine. I must finish packing. Getting me up to full throttle, then throwing me into reverse... could damage my engine. We'll be in Rome tomorrow. We'll have three days. Try a little patience. Or a cold shower. Think about something else. That I like. You can see right through it. Who's in the righthand seat? I am. Demoted? It's a pilot check flight. I'm checking Anson Harris. -He's been a captain for years. -So have I. You're checked out every six months... to make sure you don't pick up any bad habits. Such as nuzzling stewardesses? Mm-hmm. Does he hold on to the control too firmly? Or can he coax them along with just his fingers? Ohh! -We still have to- -Go wash it. When he's stacked up and can't get clearance to land, how does he take it? You and your roommate have enough china, glasses, and booze for a round trip to Australia. That's not all our loot. The girls in the building have contributed. Grace is getting married. We're having a party. You could hijack a 707 and start your own airline. We thought of that, but none of us has a pilot's license. With the kind of fringe benefits you girls can offer, I could get you a crew right now. Mel, Joe. I'm stuck in traffic... on Carden Road, just east of Mannheim. A tractor trailer jackknifed. It's on its side like a drunken dinosaur. I need two-niner awful bad. If you're not out soon, I'll get the Highway Patrol. What else can go wrong? I better check the snow desk. I'll be back soon. You're exhausted. You've been rushing around for three days. -I've got to go. -Why do everything yourself? You've got an assistant. Let Mike do it. Sit down and relax. I'll fix you coffee and a sandwich. Oh... one thing you should do. You promised to call your wife back. Bakersfeld residence, Libby speaking. This is Mr. Bakersfeld talking. Daddy! Isn't the snow super? Baby, it's cool, real cool. Robbie! Daddy's on the phone! Hello, Dad. Hi, Robbie. Are you coming home tonight? Honey, I'm not so sure. You see, I- Say good night, girls. Mommy wants to talk. Good night, Daddy. Good night, Dad. You hung up on me before. Don't do that again. I'm sorry. I was rushing to the field. All right. We don't have time to argue. You have a dinner jacket there. Meet me at the hotel. I can't make it. We've got an emergency. I have to stay here all night. You can't. You can't keep doing this to me. Listen to me, Cindy. In the past month, you've scheduled me for seven charity wingdings. I've made four. That's not a bad batting average. I'm not a ball game where you keep score. I'm your wife. Then try to think of my position for a change. I'm only thinking about you. This isn't just another dinner. Dad wants to talk to you. He's been talking and I've been saying no for 15 years. Then why? It's a wonderful opportunity. You two should have gotten the message. I'm not interested in your father's job. I've been in navigation for 20 years. That's what I like, and that's my life. Yes. What kind of a life? This would give you regular hours. We could be together and with our children. Your income would be three times what it is. Sure. We can join the country club. And what's wrong with that? Let's get something straight. I'll support my family on the income from my job. You don't give a damn about our future. I'm just trying to survive the present. Well, maybe you won't have to. -What the hell does that mean? -Figure it out. Why don't you have your coffee in here and lie down? Guess what. They just picked up a stowaway from L. A. on flight 86. That's four this month. BOAC had one on Monday, a 16-year-old. If you're wondering, we didn't have another fight. It's a continuation of the same one. But I'm as much to blame. She's right. I look for excuses not to go home. Hello, Joe? Oh, Harry. All right, I'll be right there. -Get on the nose wheels. -How deep should we go? You've got about three feet at the wheels. The forecast is for it to go on like this for days. We need a lot more men. I'll try to round up some. Maybe there's an easier way. Captain Demerest has a good idea. Captain! Tell Mr. Bakersfeld. My idea will make you aviation man of the year, and Captain Benson agrees with me. Put pneumatic jacks under the jacking plates and lift her. Then you fill in, plank over, and roll her off on the flat. If every jack isn't absolutely level, she'll slide off, and you'll have a hole. I'll stick with Patroni's judgment. Do it the hard way, but you better move this. I'm not taking off on 22. You'll use what's available. If it's 22, I'm not cutting back on power over those houses. Unless you want a bill... for cracked plaster and broken dishes, you'd better move this. Keep digging. Another pilot gets an idea, hand him a shovel. Yes, Peter? Uh, Mrs. Livingston, I've got that stowaway... that Mr. Miller told you about. Bring him in. Hello. I'm Mrs. Ada Quonsett. I'm Mrs. Livingston. Pleased to- I mean, won't you- Sit down. Thank you. It was a long walk from that gate. We've got some talking to do. Lock that door. You've done this sort of thing before. Yes, my dear. It's illegal. Why do you do it? I'm a widow and have a married daughter in New York. Sometimes I get lonely for her and the grandchildren, so I go to Los Angeles and get on a plane going to New York. When I'm ready to go home, it's, well, vice versa. Without a ticket? I couldn't possibly afford a ticket. I just have my social security... and the small pension my late husband left me. Have you stowed away on other airlines? Oh, yes, but I like Trans Global the best. Well, it's nice to meet a satisfied customer. How about Patroni? Highway Patrol's bringing him in. -How long before he's here? -Half an hour. Good. Now I'll have that sandwich. I'm starving. I haven't eaten since about-Oh, I'm sorry. No, don't go away. I'd like you to meet Mrs. Quonsett, the stowaway I was talking about before. This is Mr. Bakersfeld, General Manager of the airport. Well, how do you do? It's a pleasure to meet someone so important. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. Don't go. Come sit with us. Have a cup of coffee and a sandwich. Perhaps Mr. Bakersfeld could impress upon Mrs. Quonsett... that this isn't a nice thing to do. Mrs. Livingston hasn't been able to. Uh, yes. Uh... uh, Mrs. Quonsett, uh, what you've done is, uh, is dishonest. You've broken the law. You defrauded Trans Global. They can prosecute you. But they wouldn't, would they? It wouldn't be very good public relations to prosecute a little old lady because she wanted to visit her daughter. -May I have one? -Well, sure. On the plane, the beef was a little too well done, and the salad dressing had garlic in it. You should tell them, my dear, that very often elderly people can't tolerate garlic. Gives them gas. Well, I'll certainly mention it to our chef. Thank you. Not at all. Look, Mrs. Quonsett, since you've had so much free travel from Trans Global, at least you could tell us how you get aboard. Well, I use many methods, but I like to be in the airport... early enough to get a boarding pass. But our boarding passes are ticket folders. I know. I go to a counter and say I've lost mine and need another one. The clerks are busy, and lots of people are waiting. They always give me one. It's just a blank folder. It isn't made out as a pass. I do that myself in the ladies room. I know just what to write. I carry one of these black pencils like the airlines use. -See? -Yes, I do. I'll keep that if you don't mind. It's really mine, but if you want it, I can get another one. So now you have a boarding pass. What then? Then I go to the departure gate. -Coffee? -No, thank you. I wait till the man checking tickets is busy. Then I walk past and onto the plane. Do you hear that, Mr. Coakley? No one stops you, not even the stewardesses? If you get on late, they're hanging up coats and talking to the men, and I just show them my folder quickly, you see, like- I'll keep that, too. But I'm sure you don't always use a boarding pass. No. Sometimes I tell them that my son has gone aboard... but he dropped his wallet. I carry a man's wallet in my hand... That works best of all. I must say, Mrs. Quonsett, you have everything figured out very carefully. My late husband taught me to be thorough. He was a teacher of geometry. My late husband was a lawyer, and he always said, Now I understand what he meant. You're a widow, too. Oh, I'm sorry, my dear, but you're young and attractive, and I'm sure- Let's confine the conversation to you, Mrs. Quonsett. We're sending you back to Los Angeles on the next flight. Yes, I was afraid of that. I would like a cup of tea first, so I'll go now. When do you want me back? Oh, no, you're not going anywhere alone. Mrs. Quonsett will be on flight 103. Stick with her every second until departure. -Don't lose sight of her. -Ma'am, she'll need a ticket. Yes. That will be a change, won't it? I'll make out an order. May I please have my tea now? Yes, you-Where are you going? In the Commander's Club. Mrs. Quonsett, that's for members only. But I have a card. This card says Mrs. Henry Jackson. My friend Gertrude lets me use it when I'm traveling. We'll send it back to Gertrude with a very strong letter. We'll go this way, Mrs. Quonsett. Good-bye. Good-bye, ma'am. You have been very nice. Thank you. I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. You were a big help giving her that VIP treatment- deference, courtesy, sandwiches. Why not break open a bottle of champagne? If we had one, I would have. She's fabulous. She just laughed at us. Take it easy. There have been stowaways... ever since the Egyptians sailed the Red Sea. When they caught them, they tossed them overboard. The airlines won't do a thing, and she knows it. Crafty little old biddy. Come on. Relax. She only stole a ride, not a plane. I know, but... Mel, they've been pressuring me... about that transfer to San Francisco. I think I'll take it. The pay is better. The climate will do me good. No snow. Yes. It's a beautiful city. I'll miss you. Will you... enough not to let me go? I'm sorry. You've been honest with me from the beginning- no false hopes, no promises. I'm not as honest as you think. I said I invented excuses not to go home. But I didn't mention why I stay. I tell myself I've got to hold things together... for the children's sake. But I'm not sure that's true or even kind. They know what's going on, and it's hurting them, especially Roberta. I think about my mother and father, and... God knows they had their ups and downs. But somehow they... somehow they worked it out. I feel I should do the same, or else I've failed. I don't like to fail. I don't know what to do. Maybe you love your wife more than you realize. No. No. Not for a long time. The only thing we've got in common is our address. I'm not pressing you, Mel. I wouldn't play that kind of game. But I better take that job in San Francisco. Mrs. Livingston. -Yes? -Excuse me, Mrs. Livingston, but customs just called. The chief wants you. He says it's important. All right. One of our passengers is demanding... to speak to someone in authority from Trans Global. Will you explain to this man that this isn't the Dark Ages, that nowadays stores in this country... import clothes from France? If you'd look, you'd see the Bergdorf Goodman labels. Oh, I did look, madam, rather closely, and I find the sewing of the labels... isn't up to Bergdorf's usual standard. They're always very professional, very neat. As you can see, that's... that's a pretty sloppy job. But I suppose everybody's having trouble getting... good help these days. Especially the customs service. Well, what's the matter, boy? Is there something the matter? Huh? Oh, your collar's too tight. Officer, about the fur and the dresses, perhaps I made a mistake. I did buy them there, and there are some other... I'm sorry, madam. Check everything else very carefully. Inspect the lining of the bags and the cases. -Make a list. -Yes, sir. Sorry, fella. I'd like to change that declaration, please, officer. I beg of you. My husband will- Madam, please sit down. This might take some time. When will they learn? The duty would have been 1/10 of the fine. You are amazing. I never would have suspected her. Well, after 30 years, you kind of know. First I look in their eyes, then the luggage. Thanks for coming. Now, may I ask you another favor? If you want me to smuggle anything, the answer is no. No. My sister's girl, Judy Barton, will be on your number two flight to Rome tonight. Can she have a window seat? -I'm sure of it. -Good. -Oh, uh, Mrs. Livingston. -Yes? Will it get off on time? Flight two, the Golden Argosy, will depart for Rome on schedule. Good. Fine. Thank you. I thought you were leaving tomorrow. No. I have to start work tomorrow. I got to be in Milwaukee tonight. Remember? Is this another one of those hello/good-bye jobs? I talked to Mr. Williams himself. 175 a week. Look, this is a 30-story building. The job will last, uh... eight months at least. I hope so. This time do me one favor. If your boss says two and two is six, agree with him. Whatever way he wants to do anything, that's my way. Don't lose your temper. And Williams said that after the job in Milwaukee, they're building in Detroit, and he said they may subcontract the excavating to me. Be satisfied that you're working. I am, but you'll see. Everything will be fine, the way it used to be. Nothing's the way it used to be, but I'm not complaining. You never do. How you could stick with me after- ""FFor better or for worse. ""F I meant what I said. It will be better again. I promise. I've got an idea the kids won't have to live... with your sister anymore and you'll have money... and a nice home and clothes. Dom, stop dreaming. Just hold on to the job. I'll do it right this time. I won't mess it up. How will you get to Milwaukee? The bus. It leaves in a few minutes. I've got enough for that. Then I can draw in advance... on my salary tomorrow. But I will need something for a hotel room tonight. If you could- All I've got is enough for the rent. Yeah. All right. Dom... the silverware is gone. My watch is gone. My mother's ring- don't pawn that. Here. I can give the landlord another hard-luck story. Good-bye, Dom. Inez... I haven't been a very good provider, but I will be. I promise you that. Good-bye, Inez. I love you. I want you to always remember that. Good-bye. It's highway robbery. Why the airlines don't provide free transportation... I'll never know. Mister, I just drive the bus. You're holding up the line. Here, here. Hi, Anson. Why are you here so early? Trying to impress me? How about an ""FA""F for effort? We're using 324 tonight. On her last flight, number two engine gave them trouble. I wondered what maintenance did about it. I hope we got a new one. They even replaced the wiring to be on the safe side. That's the side I like. What's the matter? The last time you checked me out, you marked me for not wearing a regulation shirt. I was hoping to get even. Not a chance. Knowing how tough you can be, tonight I even polished my wings. Thanks, fellas! I tried to get more help, Joe, but I only got 20 men. I did a little phoning from my car. I got 50. Where'd you get them from? Braniff, Delta, Continental. We're not like those front office stiffs... who wear ties and steal passengers from each other. Maintenance-it's like a circus. One of us gets in trouble, they all come running. Let's go. I got a beautiful dame waiting for me. We should be above this in about 20 minutes. Let's hope. -Forget something? -No. Just checking the Rome weather. It's not too cold and sunny. As usual, I've brought the wrong clothes. -I don't have a thing to wear. -Great. I'll have this mother out by midnight, so stop worrying. The party starts at 12:01. I'll settle for a box of cigars. See you later. You keep leaning on that shovel, Jack, you're going to freeze solid like Lot's wife. We want to move this airplane before it becomes obsolete. The way you guys keep heading for this bus... looks like you got a broad stashed in there! Out! Everybody out! P. A.: Attention. Attention, please, ladies and gentlemen. Trans Global Airlines regrets to announce... that the Golden Argosy flight two to Rome... will not depart until 11 p. m. We are indeed sorry, but this is due solely... to the condition of the highways, which is causing unavoidable delays... in ground transportation. Those of you on flight two to Rome, don't worry. They're going to hold the plane. Just relax. I'll get you there in time. They could have decided that before we left the terminal. Making us sit here and worry- it's inexcusable. -Go away. Your nose is running. -No! Of course, if it's not crowded, I... Here's the ticket. It's flight 103. -Oh, thank you. -Oh, no, you don't. My, she has a suspicious nature. Well, go on. You were saying... you prefer the flights that aren't direct. Yes. That's why your flight 86 is my favorite- St. Louis, Kansas City, Chicago. Yes, but I should think they check... at all the intermediate stops. I pretend to be asleep. Usually they don't disturb me. But this time they caught you. It was that man sitting next to me. I confided in him, and he betrayed me to the stewardess. He was a policeman from San Diego. I think they should make them always wear their uniforms. Otherwise, how's a person to know? Hi, Mel. I was just going to have you paged. -I had to go out in the field. -We got trouble, Mel. I talked to the lawyer for those Meadowood people, and he says unless we stop planes... from taking off over their houses by midnight, he's starting a damage suit... first thing in the morning for $10 million. That's a nice round figure. He hasn't got a prayer. He might not win, but he can sue. Any legal action will only make... our public relations worse than they already are, and that's something the other commissioners and I... don't want to risk. What do you propose to do about it? Well, there's only one answer- shut down runway 22... and cut out the noise over Meadowood. And with two-niner out, that means closing down the airport completely. Only until morning. After all, you've promised them dozens of times... you wouldn't disturb their sleep. I promised we wouldn't take off over their houses... unless there was an emergency, and I promised them something else: In the foreseeable future, the noise problem would not get any better. If you don't want to spend a couple of months in court, you better start conning them a little. You think lying to them is the answer? Oh, Mel. There's your answer. A modern expanded airport big and efficient enough... to take anything the designers can throw at us. That means buying off Meadowood... and rezoning it for industrial use... so the noise won't make any difference. I didn't come here to talk about the future of aviation. Well, you better start, and you better start looking ahead a few years. What are we going to do... about these jumbos that seat 500 passengers? How will we get people to and from the airport? Save that for the women's clubs and the Rotary luncheons. We've got to be practical. Sure, sure, ignore it. Don't stick your neck out. It's about time that you and the other commissioners... began fighting for a bond issue... to finance this kind of an airport... instead of running around... checking to see if the toilets flush. I don't think insulting me is going to solve anything, so let's get back to our immediate problem. We've got to make a decision about tonight! I've made it. The airport's staying open. Mel, stop being so bullheaded. Think of the consequences. Don't talk to me about consequences. When Congress voted to cut airport appropriations, you never even sent in a letter of protest. Where were you when the airlines and the pilots... and the rest of us were pleading... for more airports and better traffic control? You were picking out the colors in the ladies lounge. So now you've got your consequences- congested air traffic where Sunday pilots hold up... airliners with thousands of people aboard... and force us to stack up planes bound for New York... as far away as Denver. When it comes to politics, you're a child. Two of our councilmen live in Meadowood. Think what they could do to us downtown! I'm thinking of those pilots upstairs waiting to land, flying blind in that muck... and circling in holding patterns and praying to God... that some tired, overworked, underpaid controller... in the tower... doesn't have another plane on the same course. You can call it pigheaded. Call it anything you want. As long as we're not below F. A. A. minimums, we're not closing down. All right, if that's the way you want it. I'm calling the other commissioners, and I'll let you know what our decision is... within an hour. That's your privilege. You hired me, and you've got the right to fire me, but until you do, this airport is staying open. Do you wish to make a reservation? No, I don't. Could you please tell me... if there's a flight to Rome tonight? Yes, our Golden Argosy flight two. It departs at 10 p. m. Only tonight, it's delayed one hour... due to weather conditions. Well, could you- it's very important to me... to find out if somebody's on that flight. His name is D. O. Guerrero. I'm terribly sorry. We're not allowed to give out that information. You don't understand. The person I'm asking about is my husband. I am sorry, but it's a company rule. You might go out to the airport. If you can get there before they board the flight, you could see your husband if he's there. I see. Well, if that's the only way, I suppose. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for calling Trans Global. Why didn't you tell me this before? I tried, but we were in a hurry, and... You're sure? Do you mean am I sure I'm pregnant... or am I sure you're the father? Come on, Gwen. I didn't- The answer to both questions is yes. You know I wasn't asking- You have a perfect right to. I want you to know something, Vern... that there hasn't been anyone else but you. You see, there couldn't be. I happen to love you. I'm afraid I was careless. I stopped taking the pills... because they were making me gain weight, so instead of being plump, I'm pregnant. Stop twisting your wedding ring. I know you've got a wife. I know you can't marry me. I knew it in the beginning. I won't make things difficult for you. I'll work it out myself. Don't be ridiculous, Gwen. You don't think I'd walk out and ignore the whole thing? I'll take care of you. I'll make sure you don't go... to some butcher two flights up over a drugstore. I hear Sweden's the best place. Good doctors, good hospitals, medically safe. Very quick, very simple. One minute you have it, next minute you don't. There's no danger of complications. That is, no physical complications. I'm not so sure about the moral ones. You have religious scruples? No, no... but the strangest thing happened to me today... when the doctor told me. I've known other girls in the same situation... toss it off with bad jokes... like ""Fl've got a bun in the oven... ""F or ""FCaptain, we've got an extra passenger on board. ""F I knew I'd react the same way... very modern, very sophisticated. But I certainly didn't. I was suddenly filled with a sense of wonder and awe. I don't want to sound mystical or anything, but I am carrying someone who's part of us. I'm not so sure I want to lose it. And if you have the baby, then what? Well, I suppose adoption would be the answer. They're very careful nowadays. They find the right family. They're very careful, and all the arrangements are made beforehand... and the records are kept secret, you know... and you'll never see the baby. I suppose in time I'll be sensible, but I've got to have time to think. Vern, thank you for caring. Most men would have said, ""FSo long, girl. Tough luck. ""F Not this one. You know, I think you really do love me a little. It makes it harder to decide... but easier to bear. Is something wrong, Gwen? The air vent was stuck. The captain fixed it. Oh. Full throttle! All the way! You chickened out on me. I said I wanted all the power you got. At full throttle, this plane would be standing on its nose. You might fly these things, but I take them apart... and put them back together again. If you had any guts, we'd be on the runway by now. You felt it vibrating. Another 10 seconds, we'd have had structural damage. You're not talking to some kid that fixes bicycles. I know every inch of the 707. Take the wings off this, and you could use it as a tank. This plane is built to withstand anything... except a bad pilot. All right, hold it. This kind of talk will get us nowhere. You might tell your mechanic... I've got over three million miles in the air. And 21/2 feet in the ground. Let's stop wasting time! What do we do now? Now we got to dig a lot deeper, put lumber under the wheels, but the next time we try, since he's afraid, I'll drive it out. I'm not turning this ship over to anybody... without authorization from our chief pilot. I phoned Kettering, but there's no answer. We'll just sit here and wait till you get him. No, we don't. We haven't got time. You're not in the air, Captain. You're on the ground- my ground- and you're blocking my primary runway. I'm not using full power. It's too risky. Then I'll make the decision. I'll take the responsibility for the aircraft. Mr. Patroni is licensed to taxi. He'll take over. If he tears this ship apart, you better have eight million to pay for it. Joe, my neck's out about 14 feet. Sure it will work? Buzz, put it this way. You promised me a box of cigars if I pull this off. What are you standing here for? Go get them. Bus from the downtown terminal is just coming in. P. A.: Your attention, please. Trans Global Airlines' the Golden Argosy... flight two nonstop to Rome is now ready for boarding. All passengers holding confirmed reservations, please proceed to gate 33, green concourse ""FD.""F Oh, Rome. The Colosseum, the Sistine Chapel... the Catacombs. My dear late husband and I always planned to visit there. ""FSee Rome and die,""F he always said... but he died just when we were packing. Oh, gee, that's too bad. Yes. So near, and yet so far. What's wrong? Oh, dear. Oh, dear. -What is it, Mrs. Quonsett? -Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm having one of my spells. I'll get help. I'll call for a doctor. Oh, it's-I'll be all right. I've had them for years. It will pass. Oh, dear! If I could just lie down for a little while. I saw a cot in the ladies room a little while ago. I'll help you. Come on. Take it easy. Are you sure you're going to be all right? Sit down along the way if you're not. You'll be all right. We'll be there in a second. I'm much better-much better. Are you sure you don't want me to call for the doctor? Oh, no. I'm in enough trouble already. But-but don't go away. You will stay right here like you did before, won't you? Oh, certainly. I'll stay right here. Perhaps you're right. You better get a doctor. Of course, right away. But don't worry. I'll be all right. There's an attendant in there. She'll take care of you. I won't be a minute. Thank you. Uh, that is E-R-O. And what amount policy were you considering, Mr. Guerrero? Uh, 150,000. -That will be $5.00. -Yes, I know. But for $2.50 more, you could take out 225,000. It isn't much extra for all that protection. I don't know if I have that much left- American money. I exchanged all my dollars to lira. Oh, we accept foreign currency. Yeah, well, I've got that all in big bills. We'll take a personal check if you like. No. When I go to Europe, I always leave my checkbook at home. You know, it's too much of a temptation. Oh, wait a minute. I may have enough. I didn't mean to push you, but we're having a sales contest, and I've got a chance for the prize. Every little bit helps. Yeah. Could you hurry that up, please? They've already called my flight. Oh, just the first call. You still have time. But I distinctly asked for the fourth row. I'm terribly sorry. This is the best we can do. Well, give it to me. Did you say this is some kind of exchange program? Yes. You see, the Italian girl would be living with my folks, and then I'll be living with them. Oh, well, that should be quite an experience. I'm sorry. Could you hurry, please? There's the terminal, lady, over there. Just be a couple more minutes now. How about letting me buy you a cup of coffee? Good. Mr. Bakersfeld's in there having dinner. We can join him. Let me check the calendar first. Right. Here you are, sir. Seat 23A. Have a good flight. Thank you. Just two no-shows in first class, huh? They've been waiting in the Commander's Club. Oh, no. No. I'm just a visitor. I work downstairs. Oh. Sorry. Ready? Did you see that man with the attach case just now? No. Well, if he were coming in from abroad instead of going out, I'd want to inspect it. Do you think he's smuggling? It was the way he held the case, the look in his eye. He tried to hand me his ticket... Sorry about the delay, Mr. Donovan. -That's all right, Mike. -Excuse me, young man. My son dropped this. All his money's in it. He just went on board. Blond hair, no hat, camel's hair coat. I wonder- I'm not allowed to accept a wallet. See the stewardess about it, please. Oh. But, you see, if someone is smuggling, they usually start to get nervous when they land, not before they take off. This guy was really shaky. If it's contraband and he's a trembler, Italian customs will nail him. There's not much we can do about it here. I don't know. I think somebody ought to. Maybe you should tell your boss, in case he wants to notify the captain. I guess you're right. Be right back. P. A.: Braniff International flight 49 for Dallas... now boarding at gate 19, the red concourse. All passengers holding confirmed reservations... please proceed to gate 19, the red concourse. 23B? Oh, yes. Right here. What are you doing here? She got away. She what? Well, what she did was- we were- I don't care how she got away. Get on that phone and call every airline. I'll see if security can round her up. Forward jetway still in place. Your decision, Captain. Make some noise. Miss Meighen? Yes, Captain? What's the delay? The tourist head count won't tally. Where's the ramp supervisor? -He's back there counting. -Get him. The plane to Rome- is it gone yet? -No, but hurry. -Which way? Go through there and turn right. -Green concourse, gate 33. -Thank you. I know you got problems, and so have we, but how long will we sit here? I've just ordered a ticket recheck. We should have 81. It seems we've got 82. Every second, we're burning fuel on three and four- which you gave the OK to start- precious fuel that we'll need tonight. I know, Captain, but- Unless this plane leaves right now, I'm going to shut everything down... and send for fueling to top off our tanks, so make up your mind. It'll only take another few minutes or so. And something else- the tower just told us there's a temporary gap, so if we taxi out right away, we could take off fast. But five minutes may mean a half-hour delay, so you take the responsibility. What do we do? Cancel that ticket recheck. OK. You're leaving now. May I see your ticket, please? Thank you. Ruth! Cancel the ticket check. We're leaving. Fine. C. B.: Commander, start two. Turning two. OKto start one? P. A.: Braniff International flight 252 from Houston... now arriving at gate 10, the red concourse. Excuse me. I'd like to find out if the- my husband's on that flight that left. I- I'm sorry. I'm not allowed to give that information. He hasn't been well lately. I just wanted to make sure he got on board safely. His name is D. O. Guerrero. All right. Yes. He's aboard. Life rafts are located in the ceiling storage compartments. In addition to the doors, there are emergency exits located over both wings. For more information concerning these items, please look in the seat pocket in front of you. We suggest you read it sometime during the flight. Don't worry. If you take one of these, you won't get airsick at all. Thank you, Doctor. Global two, Lincoln Tower. You're clear for takeoff. Global two rolling. On top at 7,000. Clear above. Visibility unlimited. Proceeding on course. We'll report passing Cleveland. Now, there's nothing to be nervous about. I've flown thousands of miles, and I can tell you, it's a lot safer than crossing a street. P. A.:... now in the final stages of departure... at gate 41-A, the green concourse. Yeah, she was here. I saw her go on. But did you see her get off? No, but I'm almost certain she did. Her son dropped his wallet. She went on to return it. The wallet gag. She's on the plane. Maybe that's why the head count didn't tally. Speaking of head counts, have you counted yours lately? I'm sure you've got at least two. Should I send word to the captain to verify? Yeah. Have flight dispatch call... on the company frequency to keep it private. Our ground speed is 620 miles per hour. We've reached our cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, and the temperature outside... is a pleasant 50 degrees below zero. Our route tonight will take us over Toronto, Montreal, Cape Ray, St. John, Newfoundland, across the Atlantic, reaching the European coastline just north of Lisbon, and on into Rome on schedule. The weather in Rome is a lot better... than what we left behind in Chicago. If there's anything we can do to make your flight more enjoyable, please let us know. Thank you. This is Global two. Flight two, Cleveland. I have a message from Lincoln. Advise when ready to copy. Go ahead, Cleveland. We're ready. Practically certain you have a stowaway on board- Caucasian... female... approximately five feet, 100 pounds... age about 70... wearing a brown hat with a brown pompom, tweed coat with black velvet collar. Name-Mrs. Ada Quonsett. Determine and confirm. We'll check and advise. -I don't believe it. -Oh, I believe it. Those penguins on the ground are idiots. Now the guy in 21D says it's too hot. You want a laugh? Have you seen her? Well, she's not in first. I've hardly checked the tourist section yet. Well, go back and see if the old biddy's there, huh? If so, what do I do? Nothing. Just come back and report. How about that, huh? Little old lady just walks on... like she's walking into an elevator. Excuse me. There you are. WOMiss, the captain said we'd arrive on schedule. That means we'll make up for the hour's delay. Father, with a ground speed of 620 miles per hour and a distance of 4,817 miles, it's a physical impossibility. Your son is right. The captain was referring to scheduled flying time. It will be approximately 71/2 hours from takeoff. Oh, excuse me. Oh, I see you've got a boyfriend. Yes. He's invited me to Rome to a nightclub. Miss! Miss! These nuts are stale. I'm sorry. I'll try and find you some fresher ones. $474, and they give you stale nuts. So you play the oboe. My late husband played the violin. Not professionally, but he was very good. He once played the ""FMinute Waltz""F in 58 seconds. -There you are. -Thank you so much. -Nuts to the man in 21D. -You said it. May I treat you to another sherry? Oh, no, really. One is all I ever- Well, thank you. You're very kind. She's there, all right. 23B. That's why the head count was wrong. What should I do? Nothing. If you start questioning her now, there's bound to be tears, and- We were asked to check and report, that's all. They'll grab her in Rome, so until then, why make the old girl miserable? You know, Captain, you're a real nice person. I didn't know you were so fond of old women. -Oh, I prefer the younger ones. -So I heard. But opportunities, you know, don't last forever. Pretty soon, we'll have to settle... for the not-so-young ones. Well, I already have for quite some time. That's right. You always played it straight down the line. No mucking around on layovers. Ellen was a stewardess flying DC-4s. That's how we met. She knew what was going on, so when we got married, I made her a promise- the obvious one. Always kept it. I guess all those kids you had helped. Yeah. Maybe. -How many have you got? Six? -No. Seven. Four we planned. Three we didn't. The ones you didn't plan- did you ever consider... doing anything about them before they were born? No. Let me tell you something. I love all seven of them, but the three we didn't plan... boy, they turned out to be something real special. Detain on board... after landing. Release only... to station manager Roth. I'm going to flight dispatch. I'll take it. I'll take it for you, Mr. Weatherby. No, thank you. It'll wind up in the ladies room. What about the man, Mr. Weatherby, the one with the attach case? If Standish wants to find out what he's smuggling, let him get Italian customs to check. I won't offend a paying passenger... with something that's none of our business. I was wondering, what if he isn't smuggling? What if- Forget it. I'm sorry, Mrs. Livingston, that he got mad at you. It was all my fault. Never mind. He'll get over it. That man was one of the last to go aboard, so he probably was on that bus that was late. -Randall. -John, this is Tanya Livingston. Do me a favor. Read me the passengers on flight two... who came out on the bus. Yeah. Hang on. I've got it right here. Never mind the women. Just the men. OK. ""FRathbone, Marcus J.""F ""FBinelli, Luigi. ""F ""FGuerrero, D. O.""F ""FYates, Robert. ""F She stood us up, that's all. I hope that's all. You or me? You. Bakersfeld. Your wife insisted that I page you. She's waiting for you in your office. Thanks. P. A.: Delta Air Lines flight 76 for Atlanta... now departing at gate 12. Oh, Mrs. Livingston! I'm sorry to bother you, but one of my men found this woman... wandering aimlessly about the terminal. Seems terribly upset about something. -She should see the doctor. -She doesn't want to. I think what's worrying her most... is she has no money to get back to town. I'd like to help, but- She let me go through her purse. I thought I'd find... a little address book or something, call somebody, but there was nothing in it but this. I thought since her husband bought a ticket on Global, you might want to give her bus fare. $5.00 would do it. You just take it easy, ma'am. Everything will be fine. Guerrero. And we don't have a home anymore. We have a waiting room, where I walk the floor... and wonder whether you will leave this damn airport... long enough to drop by for a few minutes! Why you have to pick tonight to come and fight with me. I came here to tell you that Roberta left home! What do you mean, left home? When? I called from the banquet, and I spoke to Libby. Roberta, she said, told her that she couldn't stand... our fighting any longer, that she couldn't stand the atmosphere of hate. And that's a direct quote. Where is she? Did Libby say? She's going to spend the night at Sally Bolton's house. I spoke to her. Cindy, we can't do this to the kids. We've got to call a truce, even if it's a pretense. We've got to start being civil to each other. And add hypocrisy to the problem? They'd see through that. That's not the answer. Well, we've got to do something. You're right. And the only answer is a divorce. You think that will make them feel more secure? A broken home? It's better to come from a broken home... than to live in one. You may be right. And you may be right about me, too. I'm suppose I'm like a lot of men-a bigamist, married to both a woman and a job. And I can't be number-two wife any longer. Yes, Danny? Patroni wants a skip-loader. Get one from the lot. We've got to get that plane out. And, Danny, keep 29 clean so it'll be operational. That's what I mean. Those things are more important than we are. No, not more important, but at the moment, more imperative. We're in a hell of a mess. We certainly are. It's a big step, Cindy. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider? No. It's too late, Mel. And it's not just the girls I'm thinking of. There's someone else, Mel. There has been for quite a while. Someone who makes me feel wanted occasionally. You had no idea, had you? Too busy to even consider the possibility. Mel? Mr. Bakersfeld, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were busy. Cindy, uh, Mrs. Livingston. Mrs. Bakersfeld. -How do you do? -How do you do? I have information on that man with the attach case. I'll talk to you about it in a little while. Certainly. Are you sure? Are you really sure? Yes. When we tell the children, we must do it together. Of course, and I promise there won't be any trouble. You may see the girls as often as you wish. Thanks. As a matter of fact, you'll probably see them more often. Ex-husbands always seem to make a special effort. Bakersfeld. Hang on a sec. Ned, I'll be right with you. OK, Hank. Go ahead. Yes. That's all right. Put it in warehouse 12. Well, get the trucks out. They're not supposed to be blocking that area. Right. What's up, Ned? No, no, no, no. Let the city police handle it. Now, you stay right here. I'll just be a minute. The downtown terminal said they remembered... a man with an attach case. They must have seen 10 men with attach cases. But this one held it under his arm. When the agent tried to put a tag on it, he pulled away and insisted on putting it on himself. That's why they remembered him. And it was Guerrero. I can't get anything out of his wife, except a blank stare. Maybe you can make her talk. Please try. I have a horrible feeling. All right. Bring her in. Mrs. Guerrero? She's gone. Hold it. Yes, sir? Remember the woman you turned over to Mrs. Livingston? She's given us the slip. She's probably still in the terminal. You've got to find her, Ned. We'll try. Will you round up our boys? We'll announce from here. You do it. I'll call the insurance counter. -What's the security code? -Lester Mean-Wearing. Attention, please. Attention, please. For Mr. Lester Mean-Wearing's party- Mr. Mean-Wearing requests... that all members of his travel group... report immediately to the main terminal entrance. To the main terminal entrance. Yes. Here it is, Mr. Bakersfeld. ""FD. O. Guerrero. ""F It's for 225,000. Yes, I remember him. Yes, sir. He was a little nervous. Aside from that, did you notice anything unusual about him? Well, just one thing. For somebody going to Europe, he didn't seem to have much money. He paid me with six $1.00 bills... and the rest in change, mostly nickels and dimes. It seemed to be just about all he had. Thanks. You've been so busy, we just haven't had a chance to chat. I'm Ada Quonsett. How do you do? What's your name, sir? Guerrero. Guerrero? That's Spanish, isn't it? Yes, but way back. You look more Irish. So did my mother. I've been fascinated by that figuring... you've been doing on the map. I said to Mr. Davidson I was sure you would win. The contest. The one that comes the closest to guessing... our time of arrival wins a sightseeing trip. Oh, no. I didn't-no. I just do this as sort of a hobby. I like to see if I can... calculate where we are all the time. -Now, that's- -If you'll excuse me, I think I'll take a little nap. ""FApproach with extreme caution. His seat assignment is 23A.""F Have the dispatcher send it on the company frequency- probably New York. They're out of the Cleveland area by now. Maybe the man is just an ordinary eccentric. Maybe all he's got in there are important papers. I don't think so. I wish I did. I have a niece aboard that flight. All right. Suppose he has got a bomb. They've been up there over an hour. -Why hasn't he let it go? -I don't know. Maybe he's waiting until they get out over the ocean. The Atlantic doesn't leave traces. We just found the Guerrero woman. One of my men is bringing her. Hold that call. We may have something else. I'll call you right back. Now they say it's too cold. Oh, he has fainting spells. When he feels one coming on, he takes a whiff of oxygen. Sometimes it helps. Don't let him kid you. It's an F. A. A. regulation. Over 25,000, if one of us leaves the flight deck, the other one must go on oxygen. It's just a precaution. Thanks. Why didn't you ring? I could have brought you that. Up there, I'd have to be formal. Up there, I couldn't tell you, uh... how sorry I am. -How do you feel? -I feel great, Vern. No fainting spells. No craving for pickles. No morning sickness. It's funny. I didn't think you were the kind of a guy... who would worry about a thing like this. Neither did I. You know, before, you said that you thought I loved you just a little. You're wrong. I-I love you a lot more than just a little. I didn't know he was going to Rome. He said he was going to Milwaukee. Here, Inez. Take another sip of this. But this was in your purse. You must have known. It just came tonight, special. I only saw it after he left. Does your husband have business in Italy? What is your husband's business? Oh, he's, uh, he was... he did excavations for buildings. You've said ""Fwas. ""F He's not in that business anymore? Things... went wrong. -Financial trouble? -Yes. Bad trouble? Broke? In debt? Then how did he pay for his ticket? I think, uh... he pawned my mother's wedding ring. When I looked tonight in the case, it was empty. He-he just... can't seem to hold a job lately. Why not? He gets in arguments. They fire him. It's his temper. He's been like that... ever since he got out of the hospital. What sort of hospital? Army hospital. Yes, but, uh, I mean, what was he in the hospital for? He, uh... was sick. Mental patient? Mrs. Guerrero, what did your husband do in the army? He was a demolition expert. And I suppose in his excavation work, he used explosives? He, um... You were about to say something. His last job-they fired him. Something... was missing. Some dynamite. What we need is an unlisted number. This is Global two. Global two, New York. We have an important message for you. Advise when ready to copy. OK, New York. Go ahead. Strong probability- repeat, strong probability exists... that passenger D. O. Guerrero, seat assignment 23A, may have an explosive device in attach-type briefcase. Passenger purchased excessive insurance, mentally disturbed, and desperate. Approach with extreme caution. Right. Tell him another section of 3-by-12s laid crosswise. Will do. They need you? No. It won't be ready to drive for a half-hour. Ingram knows what to do in the meantime. OK. So we know the kook is sitting in 23A. That's here. That's right. What's your opinion? My opinion is they should get back here as fast as they can. If he lets go, could the plane stand the explosion? We got one break-he's not sitting in an aisle seat, so first, it'll blow out a hunk of the fuselage here. What kind of structural damage would that cause? There's nothing but skin on the sides. All the control cables run here, so if it's not too big a hole, she might still fly, but the sudden decompression at 30,000 feet... is something you got to see to believe. -He'll get sucked out, won't he? -So will anybody next to him. Until that pressure equalizes, everything within 20 feet of him that's not nailed down... is going to get sucked out. Is it that powerful? Are you sure? Huh. Yeah, I'm sure. As a mechanic in the Air Force, I was being transferred on a MATS plane. At 20,000 feet, one of the windows shattered. The guy sitting next to it was about 170 pounds. He went through that space like hamburger going down a disposal. Right after him, coats, pillows, blankets, cups, saucers... yeah, I'm sure. Takes about three seconds, doesn't it? Three, four, five. Depends on the size of the hole. Everything fogs up just like that, and then, watch out. That altitude, you can't breathe, so unless they get on oxygen in 45 seconds, it's good-bye. We'll turn back, but I'm going to make a wide, slow turn. That way, the passengers might not notice. Toronto Center, this is Global two. Seem to have a problem here. Request clearance back to Lincoln at a lower altitude. Roger, Global two. Turn left, heading 2-7-0. Descend and maintain flight level 2-8-0. Are you declaring an emergency? Possible emergency. We might have a disturbed passenger. There's no mistake. He's in 23A. -Fits the description perfectly. -When did you see him? When I was boarding Mrs. Quonsett. He's sitting right next to her. Did you notice the attach case? It's on his lap, and he won't put it down. Ruth told me that when she was serving the snacks, he wouldn't use the pull-down table. He insisted on putting his tray on top of his case. Sounds as if that's where he's got it. Then he must have a trigger on the outside of the case. Is anyone sitting on the other side of the old lady? A man. Then I'd have to lean over two people. I couldn't surprise him. OK if I go take a look? Sure. Not too close a look. He might suspect something. No. I'll do one of those smiling, good evening walk-throughs. If anybody catches the fact that we're turning around, I'll give some double-talk. Toronto Center, Global two starting to turn. Would like to make it wide and gradual. Global two, wide turn approved. Will alert other sectors to your problem. So delay serving dinner. Put every bottle, cup, glass, and everything else away... and lock it up. Right. Be careful, Vernon. All right. I'll tell the girls in tourist. Oh. Oh, Captain. Our son has a question to ask you. Schuyler, here's our captain. Before, Virgo and Leo were right there, sir. Now I'm beginning to see Ursa Minor and Cassiopeia. We must be turning around. You have a young navigator here. I'll tell you, son, due to a setzle wind, distors vexered us into a 360 tarsan of slower traffic. We'll maintain this borton hold... until we get fortomagnus clearance from Malnix. Oh. Yes, of course. What did he mean by that, son? Never mind, Father. I'll tell you later. Enjoying your trip? Very much. I was telling my wife how smooth it is. A little while ago, I put my drink on the armrest, and there wasn't even a ripple. Didn't lose a drop. -Hi, girls. -Slumming, Captain? -No. We got some bumpy weather ahead, so don't serve dinner yet. Keep everything in the drawers. OK. Doug, are you getting plane-to-ground direct? Affirmative. They've turned around and started a slow descent. What's the frequency? I'm sorry to have to put this on you, but if I go back there a second time, he might get suspicious. Don't worry. I think I can handle it. Excuse me, madam. May I see your ticket? My ticket? That nice young man at the gate took it. He wouldn't do that. If it was a round-trip ticket, you still have the return flight coupon. If it was one-way, you have the ticket stub and boarding folder. You're English, aren't you? I knew it the moment you started to talk. You make our language sound so delightful. -My late husband said- -Never mind what he said. What about your ticket? I'll look, dear, but I'm sure- Why don't you stop wasting my time, Mrs. Quonsett? You are Mrs. Ada Quonsett, aren't you? Since you're aware of who I am, there's no use denying it, is there? If there's some misunderstanding, I can help. There's no misunderstanding. Are you traveling with her? No. Then it's not your business. This woman is a stowaway. Are we going to turn back? You're not that important. When we land in Rome, you'll be handed over to the authorities. Come with me. The captain has to make a report on you, but first he'd like to see you. Let this lady out, please. -The captain wants to see me? -He doesn't like to wait. Don't treat her like a criminal. That's what she is. Shoving an old lady like that! I've never seen the like. Mrs. Quonsett, I'm Captain Demerest. This is Captain Harris. Would you come forward as far as you can? Oh, Captain- Please sit down, Mrs. Quonsett. I'm sorry to be a trouble to you, but I was going to New York to visit my poor daughter- Why'd you get on this flight? Because according to the schedule, the next flight back from Rome is to New York-your number 5- and I thought they'd want to get rid of me quickly, so they'd put me on that plane. If you help us, I promise you, you'll get to take trips to New York, first class. Oh. Thank you. But how can I help? Mrs. Quonsett, now, whatever happened back there, you can forget. That's not why you were brought here. Mrs. Quonsett, I hope I didn't hurt you. No, no... not much. Are you frightened easily? No. I get nervous sometimes, but not as much as I used to. When you get older, there isn't a lot left to be frightened of. Good. All right, now... you listen very carefully. C. B.: Global two, this is Toronto Center. Your position is 15 miles east of Klineberg intersection. Say altitude. Level at 2-8-0. Request continued slow descent. Roger, Global two. What altitude do you wish? -Request flight level 2-1-0. -Roger. Continue slow descent. Maintain flight level 2-1-0. Mel, I just talked to the other commissioners, and they all agree with me. So as not to have more trouble with Meadowood residents, I'm instructing you to shut the airport down until 7 a. m. Read this... dispatch we just sent. The plane's on its way back. You still want us to shut down? Under the circumstances, I, uh, I... Global two, this is Toronto Center. Continue slow descent. Whatever she's done, you don't have to be so rough. Don't interfere. Ask the captain to reconsider. I don't want to be handed over to the Italian police! It's too late. Get in your seat. All I ask is to be sent back. Please, don't hand me over in a foreign country. -Can't you see she's upset? -I told you to keep out of this. Sit down and be quiet. You hurt me! You hurt me. Stop it! You're hysterical. Oh, help me! Please, help me. Help me! No! No. That's his personal property. You can't take it! No! No! You stay where you are! Don't try to get any closer. Guerrero, listen to me. Do you hear me? Listen. They know about you on the ground. Your insurance is no good. It's canceled. It's worthless. No one has ever gotten away with a thing like this. No one has collected a penny. You won't help your family. You'll only hurt them. You'll kill yourself for nothing if you explode that bomb. Stay where you are! Your family will be hounded and blamed. Listen to me. Think. Guerrero, let these people sit down, and we'll talk. I promise, until you're ready, no one will come close. Sit down, please. Guerrero, you know now that you've failed. The only way you can help your family is to give me that case. Give me the case. If you do, I promise, no one on this plane will hurt you. Grab him! He's got a bomb! Get on oxygen! Mayday! Mayday! Trans Global two. Decompression. Making emergency descent. Request 10,000. Roger. Descend and maintain 10,000. Report your intentions when ready. Global two, Toronto Center. We're level at 10,000. Returning to heading 2-7-0. We have damage due to explosion. Extent unknown. Turn on all the heat you've got. Can we maintain control? The rudder's heavy, and the stabilizer trim won't respond, but at least the tail didn't fall off. -Where'd he pull the trigger? -In the starboard can. Go back and check the damage and report by interphone. According to the manifest, there's three doctors aboard. Let's hope they're not dentists. They're probably pitching in already. Get anybody else that can help. And find out about Gwen. WOI'm so cold. I'm terribly cold. Put him on the walk-around. I'm cutting off the oxygen. All right. You can breathe normally. You can take off the masks. Fasten your seat belts. Fasten your seat belts. Fasten your seat belts. Stewardess, if there's any brandy on board, pass it out. Are you a doctor? Yes, sister. Press that hard. Are you all right? -May I help you? -I'm all right, thank you. Take care of that man behind me. -How is her pulse, sister? -Weak. I have some adrenaline syringes. Would you prepare a shot? Will it hold? SECOND After I get this blanket wedged in here. Joan. As soon as they're patched up, move them forward. Stow the center armrests. Put four people in three seats. Right. Go ahead. The hole's about three to four feet. What about control surfaces? Can you see anything? Possible damage to rudder power, and it looks like we have stabilizer problems. Most of the glass, thank God, went sideways. Can we stay in the air an hour? Hard to tell. There's a tear in the ceiling from the hole... over to the port side. Think there's a rupture in the outer skin? I don't know. Could be. What about the passengers? I can't say anything definite. I checked the structural damage first, but what I did see was less than I expected- some cuts and bruises and shock and puking. Medical help good. I'm going to cut off the passenger oxygen. How's Gwen? Pretty bad shape. The doctor's working on her. I'll report when I can. Sounds like the break is this side of the tail. Better sit down as fast as we can, if we can. Right. Toronto Center, Global two. Have structural damage. Would like to land nearest available airport. Global two, Toronto Center. Everything east of Lincoln on your course... is closed due to weather or field conditions. However, if you are declaring an emergency, Detroit possible. They report five inches of snow over ice, but they will try to clear. Request detour. Stand by in case of any change in condition. We'll try for Lincoln. Roger, Global two. You are leaving my area. Contact Cleveland Center, 117.5. Good luck. Roger, Toronto. Cleveland Center, Global two on your frequency. Global two, this is Cleveland Center. Radar contact. Turn right, heading 2-8-0. Maintain 10,000. Lincoln weather: sky obscured, visibility 1 mile, blowing snow. Runway two-niner still closed. But we have control damage which makes landing on 29 imperative. -Repeat: imperative! -Roger, Global two. We'll relay your condition and request. Keep monitoring. I'll be in Mobile One. If there's any change, call me. Global two, this is Cleveland Center. All eyeglasses off. Eyeglasses off. All eyeglasses off. Take off your eyeglasses and return your seats to their upright position. Take off your eyeglasses and return your seats to their upright position. The captain deliberately struck me across the face! Unless you shut up, the second officer's going to do the same. Is there anything I can do to help? Yes, Father. I'm putting you in charge of praying. If that's an order, you're 30 minutes too late, son. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Demerest. I want to thank you for moving forward in an orderly manner. I think it'll be warmer for you this way, and it'll help us in controlling the plane during landing. You know we've all had trouble, bad trouble. I won't attempt to minimize it, but we've all gone through an experience... that none of us has ever had before, and thank God we have come through. We have the airplane under control. We estimate landing in about 25 minutes. I won't kid you-we still have a few problems ahead of us. Now, there are two thoughts that should comfort you. First, you're in one of the best-constructed planes... that there is. Second... tonight, instead of one experienced captain, you have two- Captain Harris and myself. Between us, we have more flying years than we... I'm giving you something for the pain, but don't move your head. Later on, Second Officer Jordon... will give you instructions on landing procedure. Please do exactly as he says, and I promise you, we'll all come through this together safely. Thank you. Global two, Cleveland Center. Lincoln advises runway two-niner still closed. They are attempting to clear, but failing that, plan landing on 22. Roger. -Want me to take over a while? -Yeah, thanks. Ground, Mobile One. Yes, Mel? Tell the chief to take position between runway 29 and 22... so they can move either way. We'll notify which runway later. Roger. Turn left, heading 2-0-5. At pilot's discretion, descend and maintain 6,000. Report leaving 10,000. Global two turning left, heading 2-0-5, leaving 10,000 now. Mr. Jordan said you wanted to see me again, Captain. We radioed ahead, and they'll have all the equipment that you asked for. Oh, good. You'd better call again. Ask the airport doctor to have an ophthalmic surgeon stand by. -For Miss Meighen? -Yes. Besides the other injuries I mentioned, I'm afraid her right eye has splinters. Whether they're wood or metal, I have no way of knowing. Her left eye, as far as I can tell, is unharmed. Of course, it's too early to draw conclusions. Modern ophthalmic surgery can do extraordinary things. I'd better get back to her- Doctor? Gwen-Miss Meighen- she's pregnant. Does that make a difference? I had no way of knowing. Her pregnancy can't be very far advanced. No, it isn't. She wasn't deprived of oxygen long enough to harm the child. No one was. If there are no abdominal injuries and she survives, chances are good that the baby should be born normally. Global two leaving 8,000. Advise Lincoln doctor to have ophthalmic surgeon available. Roger, Global two. Will notify. I'll take over now. Vern, I guess you know how badly I feel about Gwen. What's between you two, that's none of my business, but if there's anything I can do as a friend... You already have. Mobile One, ground control. Yes, Doug. This is Mel. Cleveland just handed off flight two to Chicago Center. The aircraft transmissions aren't exactly regulation. The captain's blowing a fuse. I'd like to monitor. What's the frequency? We need answers, not questions. Are you guys sleeping down there? Why aren't we getting any action? We need help! Global two, this is the Chicago Center watch supervisor. Please understand we're doing everything we can. We're holding other traffic and giving you priority. What type of approach do you wish? Chicago supervisor, listen carefully. Any approach is no damned good if it ends on runway 22. We need two-niner. We've got an unserviceable stabilizer trim, doubtful rudder control, and structural damage. If we're brought in on 22, there'll be a broken airplane and a lot of dead people, so you call Lincoln and turn the screws. You tell the Lincoln manager to get off his butt... and clear that runway! Snow desk, Mobile One. This is snow desk. Go ahead, Mel. Danny, listen carefully. Break the conga line. Send the heavy plows across to runway two-niner. They're to head for stuck airplane and await instruction. Roger. Conga leader, snow desk. Yeah, that's it. On this side, get close under the wheel. Whack it on the other side. Keep monitoring Chicago Central and ground control. If you hear anything important, honk. Right. What's with the plows? If you can't move this plane, they will. Shove an undamaged airplane with snowplows? Are you out of your mind? No. I'm out of runways. Think of what this baby costs. I'm thinking of that planeload of people. This runway is their only hope. If those snowplows rip it apart, chunks of fuselage will be everywhere. It's a chance I've got to take. OK, but you keep those toys out of my hair... and away from this airplane for 15 minutes. Maybe less. I'll drive it out. Joe, let's get one thing straight. When tower says time is running out, that's it, no arguments. Plows will move on my order. Get everybody and everything out of the way. We're starting. Get me somebody that's cockpit-qualified. All right, everybody, we're clearing out! And Chicago Center expects to hand over in 12 minutes. After that, our approach control has the flight for 8-10 minutes. We figure touchdown at 1:28. That's less time than we figured. Also, the runway choice must be made... no later than five minutes before landing. After that, they're committed. They can't turn them. -What'll we do now? -Get out of the way and wait. And holding 6,000 on heading 205. What's the status on runway two-niner? No change. We'll keep you advised. Roger. Mobile One, snow desk. Go ahead, Danny. The equipment is in position, standing by, ready to move. Roger. But be clear- if the plows go in, I'll give the order- no one else. Right. Better you than me. You'll do a hatchet job on that plane. Then the owners will do the same to you. If the owners were on the plane, they'd agree with me. -Roger. Standing by. -Mobile One, ground control. The Center estimates hand-off to Lincoln approach control at 17. This gives you 11 minutes to make a decision. I must be kept informed of exact status of approaching flight. Can we hold this frequency clear? Affirmative. We've moved regular traffic to another frequency. Can you also put stuck 707 on same frequency so I can monitor? -Roger. -May I speak to Patroni? That's OK. Approach control, who's taking the hand-off? Frank has east arrivals. Continental 73, due to emergency, continue to hold at Joliet. Maintain 8,000. The Center will hand off Global two in three minutes. He's all yours. Stick with it. We'll take everything else. You'll have the runway as soon as we know. Right. OK, son... let's get going. Ready to start. Pressurize. Light on number three. 30 miles east of the airport, contact Lincoln approach control. 118 point niner. -Good luck. -Roger. Lincoln approach, Global two. Global two, Lincoln approach control. We're still hoping for runway two-niner. We should know in three to five minutes. Roger, Lincoln. Keep us advised. Global two, 25 miles east of outer marker, turn right, heading 260. Begin descent at your discretion to 2,000. Hold it, Doug. Don't commit that flight to runway 22. There'll be a change in two-niner's status any moment. Roger. -Snow desk, Mobile One. -Go ahead, Mel. Start the plows. Roger. Conga leader, snow desk. Move. Joe, this is Mel. There's no more time. Stop all engines. Get out. Repeat. Stop all engines. Mr. Patroni, she won't take much more. Well, anyway, she's going to get it. Joe, the plows are moving. Shut down and hold on! Joe Patroni, do you read me? Acknowledge. Joe, shut down! Don't you hear? We have to shut down! Can't hear a thing. There's too much noise. Hold on! We're going for broke. The instruction book said that was impossible. That's one nice thing about the 707. It can do everything but read. Light up two-niner. Instructing aircraft remove from runway two-niner. -I'm inspecting for debris. -Roger. Standing by. Runway two-niner clear and open. Global two, turn right, heading 285. Runway two-niner is now open. Roger, Lincoln. You've just freed the slaves again. Request P. A. R. approach. Global two, Roger. This will be a precision radar approach to runway two-niner. Stand by. We'll pick you up on another scope. -How's it handling? -Real sluggish. What was that? A bump! Now shut up and move over! One bounce, we might leave the tail behind. Heads down! Keep your arms under your pillow! Heads down! We're going to crash! We'll be killed! I know we're all- Ohh! Maintain heading 285. Position: 8 miles from the airport. Final approach turn in one mile. Maintain 2,000 feet. You need not acknowledge further transmissions. Global two, turn right, heading two-niner-five. Approaching glidepath in one mile. You're cleared to land runway two-niner. Wind 300 degrees. 30, gusting 35. Now intercepting glidepath. Begin normal rate of descent. On course. If no transmissions received for five seconds on final, abandon radar approach and make straight-in I. L. S. approach. Now six miles from touchdown. Course and glidepath good. Now drifting left. Turn further right, heading 305. Slightly high on glidepath. Adjust your descent. Keep your head down! Passing five miles from touchdown. Going through glidepath. Adjust your descent. Now 100 feet low. Ease your aircraft up. Four miles from touchdown. Turn left, heading 301, returning to glidepath. Now on glidepath. Check wheels down and locked. Cleared to land. Three miles from touchdown. Course good. Slightly low on glidepath. Ease it up a little. Surface wind gusting to 35 knots. Two miles from touchdown. Course good. Glidepath good. Looks OK. Advise when approach lights in sight. -We've got the lights. -Roger. Good luck. -Checklist complete? -Checklist complete. -I'll need help with the rudder. -Right. -Right rudder. OK if Jordon watches the right side for a minute? I'll be right back. Global two, welcome home. Need a tow, or can you taxi? Over. Global two, again, need a tow or can you taxi? We can taxi. -How is she? -I think she'll be all right. -Can I speak to her? -Go ahead. Gwen... it's Vern. Can you hear me? If you can, squeeze my hand. Hold on. You'll be all right. We're going to make it. P. A.: Please do not obstruct the tourist jetway. Open the gate. Get that down here! -Mel! They're down. Everything's fine. -I was watching television- -I know. The news picked up the mayday and flashed it everywhere. They're all right. P. A.: All passengers will deplane... through the first-class jetway. Come on. Stand back, please. Let us through here. -I'd like a statement. -I'll have one later. You can talk to the captain, too. Please stand back. This is too important. -We need a wheelchair. -A wheelchair! I'm Mrs. Demerest. Is Captain- -He's coming off that jetway. -Thank you. Move back. Let these folks through. Get these people over there. Step back, please. Step back. Those of you who aren't helping, step back. Sit down in a central area. Sit down right here. Sit down right here, please. We'll notify your families. Judy! Oh, thank God! Stay in this area, senora... in this area. -Oh, madam. -Oh, oh! -I'm sorry, but that's my coat. -I'm sorry, too. Come on, let's move back. Let's move back, please. Hey! I'm so sorry! He didn't mean it. He-he-he didn't mean it. I'm sorry! -I'm so sor- -Inez. I'm sorry! I'm Dr. Nash, airport physician. I'm Dr. Compagno. A stewardess has splinters in her eye. They may have penetrated. An ambulance is waiting to take her to the hospital. An ophthalmic surgeon's waiting. Any other complications? She has a fractured right arm. They'll probably use a general. Before they decide which type of anesthesia, tell them she's pregnant. Here she comes. It's all right. We'll take care of her. I'm going with her. Nice going, sweetheart. Remind me to send a thank-you to Mr. Boeing. Good morning. First class or economy? First class. You know, it was much more fun the other way. I'm too keyed up to sleep. What about breakfast? Good idea. Where should we go? Your apartment. Well, you've been bragging about your scrambled eggs. It's time I found out how good they are. Mr. Bakersfeld? Maintenance just called. The snow blowers got damaged. Mike wants you to decide whether to work overtime to repair them. -Tell him to do it himself. -Yes, sir., - Okay Boan, how much you got here? - About 1,800. - What's going on? - There's Bagley. Mr. Bagley! Something haywire. We haven't loaded enough pipe. - Less than 2,000 feet. - That'll be enough. On Huangatan, it didn't come until we were past 26,000 feet. This hole proves out within 2,000, or it's a write-off. How are you this evening? All right. The barometer is still falling. It's a lousy forecast all right. We should stay here another 48 hours. Every hour we delay gives others a chance of beating us to the island. - I thought only we knew... - We'll sail right away. You'll be sorry. All right, Mr. Carnahan, ready to let go. - Stand by fore and aft. - OK, haul the gangway ashore! Let it go. - Roy. - Fred. Well, here's to the big one. MAIN TITLE Mayday, mayday. Mayday. I'm reminded of Amsterdam. Ever eat a raw herring with a beer chaser and a scoop of ice cream? - Captain here. - I picked up a mayday call. - It faded before I could get a fix. - Keep listening. Let me know if you get anything. Like you said: ""The hell with the weather. "" We can get out of this by backtracking around Timor. - It'll only cost us a few days. - Keep on course, I'm fine. I gotta admit, for a New York desk guy, you got a lot of guts. I sold this one to the board. If that island doesn't produce huge, I'll be wiping windshields. Men. Carnahan. I'd have told you earlier, but I couldn't risk any talk. Men, we may be sailing into the history books. Hit the lights. I believe we're headed for the biggest oil strike ever. - Here in the magic circle. - It's magic all right. Are we supposed to find oil under 2,000 fathoms of sea? Just sea is what the charts say. Now let's take a look a low angle. This was taken in 1943. This wake was left by the ship that took the photograph. No sign of land. Here's a fog bank you wouldn't look at twice. Let's look at another picture. This is taken from precisely the same angle. Same area, same fog bank. This was taken two weeks ago. 35 years later. A bank of fog that doesn't change a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic. Still nothing to explore, except for one reason. A spy satellite photographed it by mistake. I got hold of the classified pictures via a donation to someone. No names, but he lives on Pennsylvania Ave. OK, fellas. Roy Bagley, would you take over and let science make the point? The satellite was to analyse exhaust gases from a missile test. So it was loaded with two special kinds of film. No, first the infrared. The different colors represent different surface temperatures. - You mean there's land there? - Correct, Joe. An island, hidden by a perpetual fog bank. Never seen by human eye nor walked by human foot. The infrared patterns aren't like any I've ever seen. More surprising, though, is what the spectrograph picked up. Chemical composition of our mysterious fog bank. Free hydrocarbon radicals, excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide. And, not poisonous but very damn curious... This has to be caused by vapors seeping up through the ground. - Vapors from petroleum deposits. - Yes! That island is the tip of a huge underground tankjust waiting for us. - I'm betting everything I've got. - I'll take 50 cents of that. The excess CO2 might also be accounted for by animal respiration. - Turn the lights on. - Animal breathing. Are you crazy? And I'm not so sure human feet have never walked the island before. In 1605, Fernando De Queres was blown south from Tenotang. He wrote of the piercing the white veil. That's the cloud bank. And landing on the beach of the skull, where he heard the roar - - of the greatest beast... The rest of that log entry was suppressed by Rome. In 1749, a water-logged lifeboat was found in the same area. It was empty, but drawn in blood on the port - - was a likeness of a huge, slouchy humanoid thing. And this strange warning: ""From thy wedding with the creature who touches heaven, lady, - - God preserve thee. "" I also heard of a note in a bottle from a dying Japanese in 1944... What the hell are you talking about? Who is this joker? - Beats me. - He's wearing a crew jersey. I'll pay any fair amount for my... passage. - You're a stowaway? - Jack Prescott. From Princeton. - Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology. - You lying hippie! You're from another oil company! The meeting's over. He's got one of our T-shirts. This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf or Exxon can fix a fake passport. - Who the hell are you? - I am Jack Prescott... My interest in your island has got nothing to do with oil. You're not even a good liar. You couldn't find out where we're going. - You bought charts! - Come on. Who'd you pay off? They hadn't sold charts for this area in years. A friend tipped me. I did pick up some charts in Surabaya. Take this spy below till he's hungry enough to stop spouting ape shit. Let's go. Come on. - There's something out there. - Oh, come on! - Honest to God, look! - Quit horsing around. Come back here! There's something out there! About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses. Son of a bitch, it's a raft! All stop. She's alive! Gently. I've had first-aid training, Captain. Will you all clear out of here? - You have to undress her, huh? - It's usual. In case of internal injury or shock syndrome. - Get outta here! - Clear out. Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills. There's no sign of injuries anywhere. C- Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht. - Careless yachtsman, to lose this. - Remember that mayday call? You can stop sweating. Navy record's clean, it all checks out. Fingerprints. The guy's kosher. I know just how to use him, too. The girl's about to come to. She could be hysterical, so follow me. - Can I get a cheeseburger here? - You went to medical school, right? What have you got, crystal balls? There's nothing I haven't checked. I know the day and hour you completed your toilet training. Now we gotta figure a way for you to work off your room and board. - You're pretty good with a camera. - I've snapped a few monkeys. Congratulations. You're now our official photographer. Hello. Everything's fine. You're safe and well on an American merchant vessel. Where's Harry and everyone? - You mean they're gone? - Do you remember anything? No. No. Yeah... I was on deck and then... - Then I was swimming to a star. - To a light. Let her call it a star. The life-raft was blown over board near you. It had an automatic flare. I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge. The yacht didn't get very far after the SOS. The radio reported that someone found a piece of charred hull. We're sorry, ma'am. So am I. Harry had discovered me. He was going to put me in a movie he was making in Hong Kong. Dumb luck. But I guess I really can't complain. When you're alone adrift in the Pacific and somebody just... - Who spotted me, by the way? - That young fellow. How can I ever thank you? I'm Dwan. D- W-A-N. That's my name. Like Dawn, - - except that I switched two letters to make it more memorable. - I'm a mere Jack. - You must be kidding. How could anybody who saved my life be mere to me? You need some rest. I haven't had a good one of those in years. - Are we headed back to Singapore? - Not directly, ma'am. I guess it doesn't matter. I'm in no rush. Harry probably wouldn't have put me in that movie anyhow. Oh, my God! What a meaningful miracle! - I owe my life to a movie. - Is that so? I swear to God. Harry was showing this film that I refused to watch. That's why I was up on deck when the yacht exploded. Did you ever meet anyone whose life was saved by ""Deep Throat""? Come on, men, let her rest. Maybe my luck has changed. You know something? I always wondered how Cortes felt when he first saw the Inca treasure. It was Pizarro, and he died busted. Here we go... Solid land all right. This is its profile east to west. Typical Pacific formation... This would be the slope at the beach, the mountainous sector at the west. Let's get in closer. - What was that? - Just a glitch. - False echo off a flock of birds. - Spot anything unusual? - Not a thing. - Look at the screen, Fred. All those going ashore, report to the companionway. Hi there. How do you like this for beach wear? Fantastic. I'm afraid you can't come ashore, though. Wait a minute. You said I could come on the first boat. You should wait till the recon is gone. You want full coverage of this landing, don't you? I must be in it. The all-American girl saved from a yacht - - by ""Deep Throat"". - Don't print those, I'm married. - Guaranteed to be on People Magazine. - Printjust one. - Really, Mr. Wilson... I need a break, and you owe it to me. Because I am a holder of a Petrox credit card. I really am! Ask your computer. I may be late on my payments, but you take 18%% % interest plus charges. Dwan, you come ashore with us. Captain, she'll come ashore. Good luck. As soon as you get through, get on the horn. Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him. Fred Wilson. I had my horoscope done before I flew to Hong Kong. - It said that I was... - Here you go. It said that I was going to cross over water - - and meet the biggest person in my life. That's interesting. The current is 18 degrees cooler than the air. - What does that mean? - The fog might lift at the edge. Crossing 20 fathoms. Shallowing rapidly. Standing up ahead. I think I hear breakers. Shore boat to Explorer. There's a curtain around the island. We just broke through. There's a beach dead ahead. In two words: No problem. Let me get down! I haven't touched the ground in weeks. That's good. Jack! I'm coming ashore. Wait, hold it. All right. Beautiful. Let's start getting a line on this island. Bring the mosquito spray! We won't have to start wondering which way to go. You want to start setting seismic charges this morning? - Yes. Got to knock the stucture. - All right, move out! There's a waterfall ahead! Last one to get in is a rotten egg. Don't go running off anymore. We'll wait here for them. Just stick close by me, OK? Holy Mother! That looks as old as the pyramids. Could be. But the pyramids weren't repaired six months ago. There's earth on those timbers. It has to be replaced after each monsoon. Are you telling me there's people here? What's more, I'll characterize them. Scared people. - Scared of what? - I don't exactly what it is. But apparently, they thought they needed a wall to keep it out. Let me straighten you out on a couple of points. One: This wall is an ancient ruin. Two: The island is uninhabited. And three: There's an uninhabited German beer hall in there. Let's go. Fred? Look down there. Take your binoculars. - What? - Down there, that pool. - Do you think it could be? - The surface seems viscous. It sure as hell could be oil. Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller! - Maybe it's a wedding. - A good guess. It's scheduled for the night when the moon's full. Where's the groom? See the one in the ape mask? You might say that's the groom's stand-in. The groom is on the other side of the wall. You mean it's bad luck if they see each other before the wedding? Ghastly luck for the whole congregation. Oh, Christ! You want to talk for us? I'll try. Shoot in the air only. What's he bitching about? He's probably telling us we've contaminated their magic. No. Remember, in the air. What is it? He wants to make a deal. Six of them for Dwan. Tell them that I like him, too, but not that way. In the air! - You'll have trouble with the chief. - I will buy the chief. What have we got that wogs go for? Radios, pots and pans, all sorts ofjunk. This is no longer the 19th century. You can'tjust grab their island. I'll check that with the UN. In the meantime - - we scare them into the boondocks with a July 4th number. Are your men ready to set the charges? Kong! Kong! You heard him chant. He exists. You saw the wall. Who do you think they were planning to give the girl to? It's some nutty religion. A priest dresses up and gets laid. We'll humor Jack. Take plenty of TNT. Any sign of a monkey bigger than four feet, send it bang-bang. - You wouldn't. - Bet me. Even you wouldn't be asshole enough to wipe out a unique new species. The kids would burn every Petrox gas station in the country. - He could be right. - Kong, Kong, Kong... - What are you doing? - I'm going to steal a boat. - Seriously? - As soon as I've swiped supplies. - I'm going on a camera hunt. - That sounds dangerous. It's a chance of a lifetime. You either grab it or you're dead meat. You shouldn't go ashore tonight. It's not a good night for Aries. How did you know I was an Aries? By the shape of your ears. All right, I asked Fred Wilson. He knows everything about you. - I really wish you wouldn't go. - Is it better to watch an old movie? There's nothing else to do. Use your imagination. 80 times around the deck is a mile. We could jog. I guess my camera hunt can wait a couple of hours. Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing in the galley. You'll disappoint me if you're here when I get back. - What do you mean? - I hope you'll wait in your cabin. Here you are, son. Get it out right away. All right. I said that pool might be oil. We can't be sure... Think positive. Guys who think negative don't get far at Petrox. ""Has to be the biggest ever. No problems at all. "" - Well, you're the boss. - Don't worry about it, Roy. Help! Help me! No! We're too late. Set off the show. - Help him with that bolt. - Cover the gate. Get on the other side! Pull! Open that gate! The lights will hold him back! Don't shoot. - He's taken her. - No one's taken her. Who do you think went through there, some guy in an ape suit? - You all right? - I just fell in a Goddamn hole. No, you didn't. You're not in a hole. That's a footprint. Carnahan here. We've gone over two miles. There's still no sign of her. - It's better than finding remains. - Unless he's gobbled her down. Give me that thing. Mostjungle apes eat only fruit. Mostjungle apes don't have a size-90 foot. The men have had it. I'm going to pitch camp. Are you a bunch of old ladies? Come on. Keep moving. Carnahan's right. It makes more sense to stop. All right, Carnahan. You know the drill. We'll plant seismic charges for mapping and fire rockets... - Right, right! - Will somebody be on the radar? Any large, furry blimp seen moving in your direction, you'll know. That footprint measured 6.4 feet. If that were for real. How high would that make him? Multiplied by about eight, I guess. He'd make a hell of a commercial. ""The battles we at Petrox fight to fill your tank. "" If he's not going to eat her, why did he take her? Apes are very territorial. He'll probably take her to his turf. What for? Joe said you said that the ape was going to marry her. - Is that some kind ofjoke or... - I don't know, Carnahan! I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking me so many dumb questions. I can't stand heights. Honest I can't. When I was ten I got sick in the Empire State Building. Put me down! You put me down! You put me down! Put me down. Please put me down. You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape! What are you waiting for? You wanna eat me? Then go ahaed! Do it! Go ahead and eat me! Go ahead! Choke on me! I didn't mean that. Sometimes I get too physical. It's a sign of insecurity, like when you knock down trees. Such a nice ape. Such a nice, sweet monkey. We're going to be great friends. I'm a Libra, what sign are you? No, don't tell me. I'll bet you're an Aries. Of course you are. I think that's just wonderful. Help me! Help me! Radar had him on the screen. 3.6 kilometres west of your flare. He moved in a random manner. - Not in our direction? - Affirmative. Random. Like a circle. Maybe he's lost her. She got away and he's searching for her. Carnahan! Wait a minute! - Have you set seismic charges? - The men are doing it now. - Don't move until it's finished. - He's nuts. The girl might be running for her life from a gigantic turned-on ape. I know how you feel. But there's an energy crisis. We must all rise above our self-interests. - You hypocritical bastard... - Save your wind, he's signed off. Let's get going. I ain't busting my ass for no whites. OK. Who gives a shit that the ape's headed in our direction? - There's Roy. - Well, Fred... I finished testing the samples from that pool. - It'll be real great oil! - Son of a bitch! Fred Wilson is crazy, is he? Wait till those candy-asses in New York hear about this. - I'll grind them... - Like I said, it will be great oil. As soon as Mother Nature finishes cooking it a little longer. How much longer? Hardly a tick of clock, in geological terms. Say 10,000 years. Till then you'd get better mileage filling your Cadillac with mule piss. Oh, my God! I hate to kick a fella when he's dead, but I told you. You shouldn't have told New York you were bringing in the big one. The big one. Jesus! Who says I ain't gonna? Wilson to Explorer. Get me a channel to Surabaya, I want an engineer drop. OK, Jack, you go first. - Come on, it's solid as a rock. - OK, let's go. - Stop firing! - Jack! Boan! Try to make it back. I'm going on. All hands, stand by for recovery. - Over and out. - Recharge the batteries. - Air drop done, right on target. - Perfect. Haul your asses. Get that equipment working. - You think I'm crazy? - You said it. If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon would be crawling all over here. Not this one, pal. Kong is all me and Petrox. A Fred S. Wilson exclusive. Move your ass, Shorty. You think it'll ring the bell? Promise oil, bring back a monkey? Look at Exxon's ""We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank"". Beach green to Carnahan. Report back immediately. Do nothing to endanger Kong. Acknowledge. Carnahan, do you read me? Do you read me? Give us a hand over here. Wilson! Still no contact with Carnahan. - The radio's not working. No sweat. - I want to take out a search party. - I can't spare any men. - Six guys are cut off in the bush. And you're building monkey traps. You're playing with their lives. Don't worry about it. Boan! Where's the others? Come on, Kong, forget about me. This is never going to work. Can't you see? Jack! We've got to do it. Are you ready? Radar update. Monkey spotted 1,800 yards west by north-west - - heading 0-89, velocity 2.2 miles per hour. Estimated time to your position, five minutes or less. Kill the lights. Everybody clear out! - Logan, how are you doing? - Almost finished. One minute more. - That's enough. - All set, Mr. Bagley! - Ready, Boan? - OK. It's hot now. Are you sure that monkey will be able to bust through that gate? Pull back the bolt halfway. - Come on. - I can't. Open the gate! Help! - Help! - Jack! It's Prescott, open the gate. Come on! Close the bolt! Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing! Still want to play? Dwan! Congratulations. Hey, Jack. Do I look different? - Yeah, you shine. - That's right. - I'm a star. - It's all set. Coast-to-coast tour. We open in New York. Lights, cameras, Kong! And probably Nureyev and Fontaine. I want Balanchine to choreograph ""The Beauty and the Beast"". Any chance of you two getting married? I don't know. This is so sudden. We could think of some nutty way of Kong giving away the bride. It'd be tough to get him to do it. Probably just old-fashioned, huh? I don't know. What do you think, Jack? Christ. After all these years, I'll finally end up with a shrink. How can I become a star because of someone - - that was stolen off that gorgeous island and locked up in that tank? It's not someone. It's an animal that tried to rape you. That's not true. He risked his life to save me. He tried to rape you, honey. Ask the natives what they thought of losing Kong. - They'll miss him a lot. - Like leprosy. You're dead wrong. He was the terror, the mystery of their lives. A year from now, the island will be full of burned-out drunks. When we took Kong, we kidnapped their god. It's like there's a curse on all of us. I'm tired of your trying to confuse this girl. This is her big chance. And yours. There's stars at Princeton - - just like in Hollywood. You want me to get Kong another keeper? Coast-to-coast tours? ""Beauty and the Beast""? It's a farce. Just say the word and your contract is torn up. Tell me right now. See you opening night. Oh, God, I'm tired of thinking. - The ape had the right idea. - What's that? Wait a minute. I'll be right back. All hands on deck! Fire detaiI, report to the controI room. This is the captain. Sea water pumps to full pressure. Prepare to flood tank No. 4. I""m ordering the ape drowned. Hey, Kong! Here I am. Do you remember me? Remember your blind date? You haven't forgotten, have you? Dwan! Come back here! He's going berserk. - Stop, or I'll jump. - Dwan, please. - You can't help him now. - Don't come any closer. OK. Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up all these people? No one's going to hurt you. You're just going to be a star. Don't flood the tank! She fell in. You could've... Jack! I'm so glad to see you. - What is it? You're not dressed. - That's right. I was wrong when I called this thing a farce, it's a tragedy. - I'm quitting your circus, Fred. - You signed a contract. - You took an advance. - I donated it in your name. To the SPCA Fund for Sending Kong Home. Here's your receipt. - Sue me. - Don't leave me tonight, please. - My horoscope says... - Shut up. I love you. Come with me right now. The hell with the contract. Go ahead. But I promise you you'll never get another booking. You'll end up tap-dancing at rotary clubs. - Don't you understand? - Yeah... I do. Sorry. Stay well. Ladies and gentlemen of our TV-satellite audience, - - you are seeing this live around the world- - as it is happening here in New York City. You have better seats than these lucky King Kong contest winners. Thus, Beauty set foot on the forbidden island and was seized. Great was the fear as Beauty was lashed - - to the dreadful bridal altar of the Beast. Now the earth booms. Kong's power! Superpower! Hail the power! That's the power of Kong, and Petrox! No! Don't push her around! Ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing to fear! That is an escape-proof cage certified by the city government. Come on out! Easy. His feet are still chained. It's all right. Come on. We're in position. The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned up. What's the situation at Brooklyn? I""II tell that monkey to spread before he crosses it. Come on, there's a train coming. Hit the lights. This is a message to all traffic. Clear all streets. Proceed to shelters. Repeating: Clear all streets. Any person found looting will be shot. Keep running. Jack! Buy me a drink, will you? Come on, buy me a drink. Ten more blocks and we've got the key to a great apartment. We've put a river between us. The bridges are mined, and apes don't swim. Your book says so. Please, buy me a drink. Buy me a drink over there. OK. What's the matter? Dj vu. I don't know where, but I've seen this view before. Here. We don't want to get shot as looters. OK, get smashed. How about that nice offer you made me? Do you still want me? Look, chinchilla. Looks great on you. I asked you a question. - You know what I earn? - Do you think I need furs? Yes. Excitement is in your blood like dope. You're going to need new fixes I'm not able to give you. Don't be stupid. It's OK. Probably some National Guardsman ran his tank into a powerhouse. Do you remember that black-out? And all the babies born exactly nine months later? Well, here's to all the future sons and daughters of King Kong. I'll drink to that. The hell with furs. Tell me, does that nice offer still stand? It depends on Kong. He's bigger than both of us, know what I mean? Don't tease me, I'm serious. Of course. I know where I've seen that view before. I think we've got a chance. Sit tight, I've got to make a phone call. Keep it down, everyone. What do you think? Is he flipped out or not? Hello? Hello... Excuse me, Professor. You say you know where Kong is headed. Yes. You can trap him without danger. Get some helicopters and blasting nets on top of him. No problem. Where is he headed, Professor Prescott? Promise me to capture him without injury and I'll tell you. - Do we have a deal? - Yes, Professor. Where is Kong heading? A place in Manhattan that looks exactly like his natural habitat. Let him climb to the top of the World Trade Center. Jack! He's coming down Fifth Avenue on schedule. The power is back on. Keep quiet, get in the shadows. No. Hold on! Close your eyes! The helicopters are coming to net him! Hold on! Kong... What are those men doing up there? Didn't they get my orders? The rotten bastards! He's still got the girl. Follow me in a tight holding pattern. No! Don't put me down. Hold on to me. Hold on to me, or they'll kill you. Now! Oh, God. Wait. Hold on to me. Please don't let me go. Don't kill him! Don't kill him! Assholes! Kong. Dwan! Jack! Jack!, Whoa! Put me down! Say, uh, Daisy Lou, would you like to hear a tune? Eh, cousin... Oh, Blackie! You're wonderful! Sweetheart, I'll talk to him. Son, your mother and me would like for you to cozy up to the Finkelstein boy. He's a bright kid, and, uh... he's going to military school, and-- remember, he was an Eagle Scout. Arnold... Will you shut up? We're not going to have a family brawl! ...and a retard. We've put up with a hell of a lot. Can this wait? Build your goddamn muscles, huh? You know, you could build your muscles picking strawberries. You know, bend and scoop... like the Mexicans. Shit, maybe I could get you a job with United Fruit. I got a buddy with United Fruit. Get you started. Start with strawberries, you might work your way up to these goddamn bananas! When, boy? When...are you going to get your act together? Gross! Oh, good God Almighty me. I think he's the Antichrist. Anthony, I want to talk to you. Now, listen! Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you! You get a goddamn job before sundown, or we're shipping you off to military school with that goddamn Finkelstein shit kid! Son of a bitch! Up in smoke That's where my money goes In my lungs Sometimes up my nose When troubled times Begin to bother me I take a toke And all my cares go up in smoke Buenos dias, Pedro.

This is serious! This stuff destroys your mind! Can't you see she's sick? She's been through a lot. She's all fucked up. You watch your language, miss. Harry, remember to get a lab sample of this stuff. You have the right to remain silent. If you refuse that right, anything you say may be used against you. Have you got the book? No, sir. Used against you in a... in a court of law. Read the book! Thank you. Jesus! You have the right to remain silent. If you give that right up.... What's going on here? Hey, who are you?

They take the whole wedding party, plus they even get fed lunch, man. So we're cool? Yeah. We got nothin' to worry about, man, unless you don't got a green card. Hello, Uncle Chuey. This is Pedro. Hey, man, we got deported. We're in Tijuana right now. We need a way to get back. You got anything needs to be picked up here? Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Oh-- Hold on. No. No. Gracias. Okay, what's the address? Hey, toro. Hey. Hey, man. We got a ride. Far out, man. My Uncle Chuey's got a van we gotta smuggle across the border. What are we smuggling? Upholstery, man. He's got an upholstery shop in Beverly Hills, but he gets cheaper work done here, man. The smuggling of marijuana from Mexico into the United States has reached a dangerous high. The methods have become unbelievably devious, and these seeds may sow the destruction of the human race. Gentlemen, I don't think we need to comment on the seriousness of the situation. Harry, will you cool that? Stop that, Harry. Gentlemen, we are on the threshold of copping one of the largest shipments of marijuana ever to cross the Mexican border into the United States. The question is, how are they going to transport it across the border? - By boat. - Carrier pigeon. Freight. Piggyback. Plaster casts. Long trucks. Long trucks. Let me show you. Inside TV sets. No, Harry. No, no, no. Not inside TV sets. The TV set itself is the marijuana-- the tube, the picture, the aerial, the whole works. How can you make a TV set out of marijuana? That's a good question, Harry. I'll show you. Now, the weed is separated from seed. The weed is then transformed into liquid. The liquid is then acted upon by a chemical which makes it hard like a plastic. The plastic is then transformed into a spray. This spray, gentlemen, is called fiberweed, and it's pure marijuana. Thanks to the efforts of our undercover man inside the dope factory, we have some very interesting facts. That is quite a quantity of marijuana, gentlemen. It is not a lid or kilo or gram. How much do you think is here? A million pounds. Harry? A shit-load. Harry! We do know that the dope factory's disguised as an upholstery warehouse. Hey, this is the street, man. Come on. How can you eat this stuff? I love them. Don't you like these? I told you not to buy it, Man. God. What did you do that for, man? I would have ate it. A dog could be in that stuff. You got the address? Good dog, man. Hey! Son of a... Is that 7 or 1 ? Ah, it's 7. Come on. Let's go check this place out. Hey, we're here to pick up the van, man. Shh! We're here to pick up the van. Have a seat. The boss will be right back. Okay, the boss will be right back, man. Those burritos, man. Hey, man, where's the bathroom? Straight in the back. Yeah. Thanks. Come on, cheeks. Come on. Tighten up. (Machines Make Farting Sounds) Come on, cheeks. Stay together. Let's stay together. Come on, cheeks. Stay together. Oh. Oh, God. I hope that was a fart. Oh, shit. Ah... excuse me, sir. What? Where's the toilet? Over there. Hey, excuse me. Where's the toilet? Oh, thank you very much. Oh, shit. Oh, I'm sorry, man. Man, did you eat one of them burritos, too, man? Supposed to be eating a little bit of ice cream with it. Come on, ice cream! Even though we do not know what we are looking for, we do know the approximate value of the weed itself. Gentlemen, I would like to hear your opinions. A million? The television set alone is worth close to a million. - A billion dollars. - Now we're getting somewhere. I'm freezing at 200 million. - Sarge, I think it's four billion. - You're all wrong. Nine billion big ones, boys. And you know what that means. The better the bust... - the bigger the boost. - the bigger the boost. Excellent. Well, I guess that about wraps it up. Any questions? (Pedro) Where'd you learn how to roll them big joints, man? You like that, man? Whoa. They're heavy. I used to be a roadie for the Doobie Brothers. What a groovy gig. Yeah. That's how I learned to play drums. Oh, yeah? Beating on the drums. Hey, I dig Mexico, man. I'd like to come back here When we got more time. Are we at the border already? Looks that way, man. Shit. Hey, man, get rid of the stuff. Oh, yeah. Better get rid of this shit. Man, put it down. Get rid of it. We're at the border, man. Shit. Oh, lookit. Hey, get rid of it! Not that way, man. Throw it out! Throw it out. This is Toyota Kawasaki here at the Mexican- United States border where a huge task force of narcotic and customs agents is preparing a surprise welcome for a vehicle which they say is constructed entirely of high-grade marijuana. Don't make that face, man. You make me laugh. Okay, just let me do all the talking. Good afternoon, sisters. Good afternoon, officer. How long have you been in Mexico? Okay, just be cool. How long have you guys been in Mexico? A week-- I mean, a day. Which one is it, a week or a day? A weekday. You got any narcotics or marijuana in here? Uh, not anymore. You guys better step out of that van. Aah! I'm on fire! Oh, Sister is on fire! Hey, this looks like a bust. Get Stedenko on the phone. This may be it. Hey, come on. What have we got here, Sister? Hey, they're busting nuns, man. Wow. That's cold-blooded. Hey, let's watch. Okay, up against the wall. All of you. Spread them. Let's get up against the wall. Sergeant Stedenko, exactly what are you looking for? Dope, drugs, weed, grass, toot, smack, quackers, uppers, downers, all-arounders. You name it, we want it. And how important is it to you to apprehend the suspects? Critical-- The buying and selling of dope in this country may be the last vestige of free enterprise left. There's rumor, Sergeant, that the suspects might be armed and dangerous. Do you expect to see any violence here today? I certainly hope so. Sergeant, have you yourself smoked marijuana? Only once. Hey, look, we're on TV, man. Sergeant, telephone. Hi, Mom. This could be it. Why are there so many cops? Let's find out. Listen, I got to go pee first. Okay, don't go scuba diving. So it was a station wagon, huh, Harry? Very devious. And they almost look like real nuns, don't they, Harry? Down to the stockings. Very clever. Very clever. Not bad. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you know that? Reminds me of a funny story my dad told me. The only kind of meat a priest could eat on Friday was nun. Inside! Harry, get a sample of that car. Yes, Sergeant. Start the interrogation, Murphy. I'll be right back. Hey, what's going on out there, man? Huh? Excuse me. What's going on out there? Don't worry about it, buddy. It's nothing. Just some people doing what they're not supposed to do. Son of a bitch. Look at the-- Some asshole pissed on my leg! Listen, our agent just phoned from Mexico. It's not a bunch of nuns in a station wagon. It's two hippies in a green van. Must be some heavy shit. Let's go! Come on! Get that siren up! Where would these two creeps hang out? Where do hippies hang out today? Sunset Strip-- That's where they hang out. Yeah, we could try there. If they're not there, we could go up to San Francisco. Imagine the field day those two creeps are gonna have when they find out that van is made of grass. Huh? I don't believe it. I really don't. You guys are supreme idiots. How could you let a big green van slip right through your fingers? Spend one week at the border, and what do we end up with? Busting a bevy of nuns, a guy pisses on my leg, and I lose my special canine sentry dog-- Best cop I ever knew. See anything? Negative. Well, use mine. They're on the floor. Oh, yeah. These are great, Sergeant. You can see everything. What do you see? You know, there's a great donut shop up there. Do we have time-- No! No! I mean on the road! Wait a minute. There's the van. There's the van! Yeah, that's it. Hey, listen, man. When we get back to town, let's get serious about this group, okay? Yeah, really, man. Like, if we practice all the time, we could have a heavy band. Let's not let anything interfere with our music. Yeah, that's right. Hey, you see what I see, man? Yeah... Hey, they're hitchhiking, man. There they go, Harry. Keep your eye on them. (Man Stoner) Wonder what they're doing way out here. I don't know, but here comes the Mounties to the rescue. Holy... Wow. Turn around, Harry. They're over there. Keep your eye on them, Harry! Hey, man, you know how to drive, man? Sort of. Why? Take over, man. Hey, what are you doing, man? Hi, ladies. Hi. Hey, entrez vous, alla yous. Thanks. There you go. Watch your step. I'll watch everything else. Hey, what's happening? How far are you going, man? All the way. All right. We're going there ourselves. Come on over. There they go, Harry! I see them. Shoot their tires out! Got it. No, not yours. Use my gun. Oh, my God! Damn it! You stupid idiot! Look, you idiot! You are a stupid, stupid man! Get over here, Harry! Get over here. Give me that gun. When I think of the time and money I've wasted on your training, and you still turn out to be a blithering idiot! You're an utter failure! You make me sick! Have you anything to say for yourself? In the car! God, I will never, ever, never take a baldheaded man in the department again. Wow. This is a neat van. Yeah. Want to see the rest of it? Sure. Okay, we'll go right back there. The rest of it is right back there. Go ahead. Watch your step. Yeah. There you go. Yeah, right back there. Hey, have fun at Magic Mountains. Oh, yeah. I see London. I see France. If I ain't out in three weeks, man, send a search party. Hey, hold on. Don't start without me. Want to do a lude?

You could always tell if she was balling her old man. Everyone would be dozing off, and all of a sudden she'd start up. First it would start like-- Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. But then she'd really get going, and she'd be more like-- Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! And she'd start going like a motorboat, you know? Fu-u-uck me, Alex! Her boyfriend's name was Alex. Fu-u-uck me-e-e-e!

Did you hear that crowd? They gave us a standing ovation. We're going to have a bad band. We had them eating right out of their hands. We're going to be big, man, really big. We'll be bigger than Ruben and the Jets. All we got to do is keep practicing, just keep it together. I feel good, man. I wish we had something to celebrate. You got a joint or anything? Hey. What? We getting pulled over? I just remembered. I got some hash. Oh, yeah? Fire it up, homes. I need a pin or something. There's a pin right here on my tutu, man.

Hello there! Oh, my God! Oh, Shirley! Thank you. I can't find him. He said he'd be here before the finale. He said if he could make it tonight, he'd get here before the finale. - He'll be here. He'll be here. - Don't get your hopes up too high. - I really hate to see this show close. - We'll do another one soon. See you on the breadline. I told you, I told you, Adele! "" I'll always love you."" He'll always love me. Fanny... ...Nick didn't come with the flowers. This did. I'm afraid it's pumpkin time, princess. Why don't you go pass out... ...the presents to the kids. Before the booze eats its way out of the bottles. Easy come, easy go. Out, out! If you're gonna sob, do a single. Anything coming up? Anything at all? Oh, yeah. I've auditioned for a few things. I'm scared, Fanny. I think I'm going to be a little too... ...distinguished to go on shaking it around, you know? How many shows have we been in, Bobby? - Six? - Oh, easy. You knew me before Nick... ...during Nick... ...after Nick. You always do things for me. It's time I started paying you. - Hey, Fanny. I'm not really... - Maybe you're not, but I am, really. - What is that supposed to mean? - I got the willies too. The show closing... Can you balance a checkbook? Now, you know, I bet I could. If somebody showed me how. You don't have to offer me a job. I can't take your money. Who's offering you money? You think I got any money? - We'll all be back soon, Miss Brice. - You bet. You better start getting the gum off the seats. - Hey, I got a terrific idea. - What? Move into my place, Bobby. No pay, but room and board. I think we can help each other. I mean it. I'm gonna say something stupid. I know a little of what you're going through. You see, I miss Nick too. So I do know a little bit of what it's like. It's just a matter of time, Fanny. And Nick's pride. He will make a comeback, and when he does... ...you'll be there. - Yeah. I ain't going nowhere, kid. Except home. Come on. I'll race you. When do you start the new Follies? He can't raise the money, Barney. Ziegfeld can't raise the money? Not even from Buck? - Things are tough. - Even the grocer is suing us. It'll look lousy going to court over corn flakes. Fanny, darling, I think I'd better make you a loan. "" Dollink,"" I better sell my house. What can I get? Not anywhere near what it's worth, with the mortgage it carries. - What about a second mortgage? - What about a loan? What's the use of borrowing? - There are Fran's holdings. - I didn't hear it. It's all right, please. He'll understand. There's an important meeting. I do apologize, Mr. Baruch. Excuse me, Mr. Baruch, but I bought you this milkshake. Sorry to bust in on you like this, Miss Brice. I hope the milkshake's not C.O.D., kid. Now that we're all here, is there anything I can do? Fanny, Mr. Rose is a man of many parts. He's a champion speed-writer, 200 words a minute. We're going over holdings. Maybe I can be of some help. - Do you mind? - Why should I mind? So, l... I'd like to make a few suggestions. You should take a few more losses. These will only go lower. So, I'd sell. American Hide at 34, now 81 l2. AT&T bought at 150, now 111. Cellutex at 60, now 3. Keep it. We shouldn't cause them more aggravation. Cuban Sugar, from 21 to 3, Elkhorn Coal bought at 51 l2, now 1 l8. - Elkhorn Coal? Figures. - Noranda Mines bought at 17, now 17. Bought at 17, still at 17? That's a winner. Maracaibo Oil bought at 103, now 13l4. Pennsylvania Coal bought at 121 l2, now 4. Sell! Before they wipe my kid out! Billy, did you get it? - That sums it up. - There's an act in there. Now if you'd allow me to make you a loan... - Thank you for seeing me, Barney. - Anytime, my dear. Anytime. Come on, Bobby. - Nice seeing you again. - Same here. Listen... ...Miss Brice, hang onto that AT&T. Believe me. Who's the pansy? Mr. Moore is her secretary, an old friend from the days with Nick. She should've taken a loss. Look at this child. That was gorgeous! You better get out there. Why don't you cut a record? Who can afford? Where am I gonna get new material? We should get all duded up, go around to all the spots. Right, right. Wonderful, wonderful. What'd she say? It makes her mad when I let my nose drip. So you mean anytime my nose drips... ...I have to say "" Mouche mon nez""? Fanny, really. Let's do like I said. Go out and tour the clubs. See if there's anything we can borrow. This way, please. Oh, there's Fanny Brice! - Find out who wrote that song. - Sure. Order me a stinger. - Hey, Buck. - Bobby. Fanny! - Buck! How are they running? - Dandy. Good to see you. Meet Miss Norma Butler. - Glad to meet you, Norma. - It's a thrill to meet you. - Nice set of beads. - Thank you. Fanny, I'll call you. - Let's go, baby. - Bye. Hey there, Miss Brice. How are you? Quite an entrance. You know how to part the waters. Ain't difficult in a bathtub. - Well, a small thing, but my own. - Oh, yeah? - Good for you. - Hello there, Joe. You don't remember me? From Mr. Baruch's office. ""Sell!"" Did you hang onto that AT&T? - Oh, yeah. I did. You better be right. - Well, I'm always right. You got some ashes on your jacket. When I saw you, you were working for Barney. Respectable. Suddenly you're in the clip business? Not so suddenly. I haven't worked for Mr. Baruch in years. We're just friends. - You mind? - No, go right ahead. - How do you...? - Oh, excuse me. Oh, thank you. That's cute. To tell you the truth... ...I knew you were in that office that day. I just wanted to meet you. Waiter, one Scotch and water, and one stinger. What'll you have? The drinks are on the house. Bring me the usual. Something you stir up in back? - I drink celery tonic. - Celery tonic? - Mother said, ""A boozer is a loser."" - You had a mother? So, how'd you get from Baruch to here? And why? - Maybe I wanted to meet girls. - You like the girls. Sorry I took long. The guy who wrote it runs this club. His name's Rose. That a fact? Bobby, I'm sorry. You remember Mr. Rose from Baruch's office? Oh! Oh, yeah, sure. I didn't recognize you without your shake. You really write "" More Than You Know""? I wrote it before breakfast. ""When A Woman Loves A Man"" before my coffee. I might like to record it, maybe we can get together on a second number. I'm sure we can. I have three numbers I think would be terrific for you. But I promised them to Ruth Etting. Maybe I can get one of them back. But if I do, I'll let you have it for what Etting pays... ...which is one-third off of my price, because I like the broad. - I feel a little sorry for her. - Do you believe your ears? Kid... ...new song writers pay me to record their stuff. I ain't that new. "" More Than You Know,"" I don't like enough to buy, only enough to steal. That's what I said in the first place. "" More Than You Know"" is a steal. But take it. I wanna talk about the other number. The one you're gonna love. You'll love what I do for you. When I record, it sells. I know that. You're the greatest. I'm lucky you know I'm alive. But let me talk about something else. This other number... I believe in it so much, I'm willing to gamble. Record this, I'll make you full partner. I'll give you the rights. If it sells under 100,000, we split the royalties. It goes over, give me my full percentage. That's before we even start talking about the really big numbers... ...which is sheet music. So you see, it's all a steal. - Metaphorically. - Metaphorically? This is a shrewd kid, Bobby. I'll marry him. I hate paying for material. Even laughs in the right places. If you get your suit cleaned, it's a match. Ruth Etting, my ass. Anytime I want your ass, I'll know what to call it. Come on, Bobby. - I expect a lead sheet. - Thursday. - Can I have my cigarettes, please? - Oh, yeah, I'm... Ganef, huh? Take care of yourself, will you? That's a wonderful girl there. Three, four... What's with the clarinets? It's killing the melody. Why don't you sit over there, kid? Everything'll be all right, you know. Just relax, okay? Where're we up to? Bar what? Okay, 15. The drums, too heavy. I don't like it. Skinny, smoother on the drums. - You wanna try one? - Yeah, sure. Why don't you see how it sounds. I know how it sounds. Lousy. The strings are too hot. - What? - The strings are too hot. - Let me hear four bars from the top. - Four bars from the top. He's right, Fritz. Bring down the strings. Bring up the horns. - Bring up the horns. - Bring up the horns, boys. Let's go for a take. Top? Could we take that a little slower? Ready? Fanny Brice. "" More Than You Know."" Take One. Come in. When did you see Billy Rose last? Three days ago. I don't believe it! Nobody can! He has just announced a show starring W.C. Fields... ...Marilyn Miller, Eddie Cantor, Bert Robbins and you. In that order? Well, no, actually you do get first billing. Well, I guess I better go have a little talk with the little man. Are you a decorator or are you a painter? Paint the chair, I'll hold this watch on you. However long it takes, we'll multiply it by 200. So we'll know how long it takes. That's the time I pay you for. Sure, Mr. Rose. Where do you want me to do the painting? Right here, you thief, where I can watch you. Got a cigarette? - Just one second. - Yeah, come in. - It's a wonderful surprise. - I'll bet. What are you stand...? Do it in the hall. Do it where I can see you. - Miss Brice. - Painting contractor. The chairs. - All right, you ready? - One second, one second. All right, go, go. Thieving bastards. Gotta watch them every minute. Well, I'm very glad that you came up here. I'm sorry you found me like this. I worked very late at the club. I appreciate you're a hard worker. What I don't appreciate is that you're a fast worker. Where do you get the nerve, using my name in your release? - Interested in explanations? - In retractions. - Maybe you'll agree to... To be in some half-assed sandlot production... ...by a tasteless Johnny-come-lately hustler like you? I was a Ziegfeld star when you... ...were sweating through shorthand class! I know where I can get $50,000 right now. - Really? - Yes. If I get you, I can pull in... ...another star. But it's you I really want. And you can get 50,000 when Ziegfeld can't? Hey, that ain't good enough. - I know you can do better than that. - Sure. Where? - Where? - Where can you get the 50,000? - Bolton. - Buck is Ziggy's bank. - He's mine now. - How? Believes in me. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're not just a nickel-and-dime hustler. Maybe what you are is a bigtime pimp. Buck's got a new girl. Does she get billing? - She works sketches? Don't lie. - Not yours. - Look, Fanny, you need a show. - Really? Why try to scrape up an act when you can do a show? You need me. - Kid, you need me. - Let me rephrase it. - Please. Use me. - Let me rephrase it. Don't use me. You want me to be in your cockamamie show, you ask me nice. Fanny, do my show. Please. Yeah. Please. Because... I need you. - Just don't aggravate me. - You'll do it? - What a crummy world. - Thattagirl. Come on. Why don't you get a manicure? Cost a buck. It's not the buck. It takes 20 minutes. - I'm done, Mr. Rose. - I gotta use your john. - Yeah, well, listen... - Hello. Is that the door to the john? - You're Fanny! I don't believe it! - That Fanny Brice goes to the can? Oh, my God! I see all your shows every chance I get. I die laughing. - Sometimes I laugh so hard that l... - Fall right out of bed? - Excuse me, Mr. Rose. - Yeah, sorry. - What have you got? - Eight minutes. Eight minutes per chair. You want two coats? That's two coats, that's 16 chairs. Sixteen minutes times 200 is 3200 minutes. 53 hours. I'll pay cash for 45 hours. Take it or leave it. Sure, Mr. Rose. It's okay with me. Glad to get the work. And congratulations, you got a show going. Spray 'em. Four weeks of rehearsal, this is what you come up with? - What do you call that step? - That's a shim-sham. Wonderful. I got such a headache. What is this? Oh, that's cute. Cute. - Mr. Rose! - What? They're dancing. You made 16 girls look like two. Oy, you bring me roosters? What are you smiling at? I hate it! I pay this creep thousands. To design shrouds? Put it on a horse! - Who's that? - One of the showgirls. - I know. Who hired her? - You did. Get rid of her. What? - About Norma's costumes... - I'm sick about it. The director is. - What would straighten them out? - Money. Can I hear the words this time? I'd like to hear Billy Rose lyrics. Paper, paper, paper. There's a "" D"" in cardboard. A ""car"" board is on the end of a car! I like him I know he's phony But when they package it nice And market it right I buy baloney Yes, I like him Though I can see he's the type I better get busy and do unto first Before I find he's done unto me He's mostly made of chutzpah A fake, a con, a lie Could be I like him, maybe 'Cause so am I Hold it. Hold it! Hold it! - Maybe I can help you out. - I wish you would. I don't think they understand what you're talking about. Kids, Mr. Rose is a very fine lyricist, an artist. He has great respect for the written word. And I think he wants you to articulate his artistry. This girl didn't get to where she got from not understanding what I say. You want me to show you? Hey, Freddie, one, two, three, four. I like her I think she's funny And we've a mutual interest Deep down inside Money Yes, I like her Although it's true she's the type You'd better get busy And do unto first Before you find she's done unto you I'm certain there's a Fanny You seldom get to see Whoever that is Maybe she'll like me You know, you'd better learn to be a little nicer. Otherwise, those kids are gonna walk out on you. Where do you read that crap? Take five. Not now, Bobby. I know. Yeah. - Have you seen Norma? - Oh, no. Bucky! Bucky. Oh, these costumes are just beautiful. Cliff, are you ready to start the technical rehearsal yet? Cliff! - You don't think a moose gets a laugh? - It's a buffalo. I can get a laugh without a moose or whatever else. Without tons of scenery. The thing is over-produced. You're dripping. Screw it. The moose is funny and he stays. I'm the producer. You do your job, I'll do mine. I thought I hired a press agent. Where have you been? What's the problem? Have we got any press coming from New York? No, Billy. Just the locals, and that's bad enough. That's funny? Get out of here. - He got a name? - Charles. His name is Charles. - This moose is gonna get a big laugh. - Buffalo. Watch your cues, Charles. You step on a line, it's open season. - I'm so nervous! - Break a leg. Wait, I have an entrance. My hat! Please, I have a cue. Where's Norma? Tell that idiot to slow down! What the hell is happening here? What's happening? What are you doing? - Schmuck, what are you doing? - I'm trying! I'm doing my best, sweetheart. Oh, God, wait'll I get my hands on that little putz! Fifty million Frenchmen Can't be wrong When they go Ohh la la, la la la la On the bully boulevard Let's hope this one goes better. You're whistling in the dressing room? Keep it going. Keep going. Is this producer nuts? We need an army to move this. Keep going. Just keep going, I don't care how long. ""You do your job, I'll do mine."" What crap! Get out! If you'd sing like you yell, we'd have a hit. - I'll give you a hit. - Dress, Fanny. Listen, we had a little technical trouble in the first half. The trouble is that we got an amateur producer. Get out of this room, you little bum. Throw him out. Get Bobby to throw this bum out. If you're gonna have me thrown out, it won't be by your pet poodle. Lovely, darling. A trifle slow in the beginning. The buses stopped running and we got an act to go. - They adore it. - They love it. Five minutes. Second act in five minutes. Get out! Billy, I'd like to talk to you about a tiny cut. Would you look at this place? Drops the shells all over the floor. Keep singing, keep singing. Hit the rain. Boys, come back. It's only water! Just keep playing. Thank you, mister. - What's that? - The reviews. - Of what? - The first act. Thank God they didn't stick around. There are 10 people out there. I'm going to lay them in the aisles. Fanny? - Get me the house detective! - It's me! - Are you crazy? - It's only a joke. It's only a joke. It's me. I got those tickets. We're rehearsing. - You idiot! - Charades. I'll call you later. Right, goodbye. Are you some kind of break-and-enter artist? You wouldn't let me in. I borrowed a key. You gave me a heart attack! - I'll tell you how we fix the show. - We?! Mr. Rose, I have been through burlesque, Ziegfeld... ...childbirth, divorce, the Crash. Last year I saw my daughter ride in a pony show. I've also been kicked in the ass by a horse. But I've never been through anything like last night. - I know. I know. - What? - Look, we got a few weak spots. - Buffalo shit! - Look... - Get out! Childbirth, was that easy? Like pushing a piano through a transom. - We gotta push this one through. - You push this one. 8 a.m., I call my lawyers. Out! All right. All right, all right, all right. Goddamn it. What is the matter with you? I might as well tell you the whole mess, Fanny. What? Wasn't just Bucky's money. I spent that weeks ago. I needed some more so I... ...I had to borrow from the boys, and it's gone too. - They'll build me into the highway. - That's good news. - I'm not kidding. - I'm not either. I'm into them bad. They're gonna come for me. Oh, God, they're gonna come for me. They'll come for me. You borrowed money with no backup? - Yep. - You must be smoky in the head. Look, you gotta help me, please. I know I can fix the show. Please, I can fix it. Give it to me. Bucky'll stay in. If you stay, I know I can fix it. What happened was mostly my fault. You were right about everything. The sets, the costumes. Charles? Everything. But the songs are good. I'll get some dancers to back up Bert. And the sketches, they're good. They're swamped by your damn production. Teach me. I can learn. I learn it faster than anybody. - You need a show. - You gonna start that again? I don't need you. I'm a star. Listen. Come on, Fanny. - Where you gonna get some more dough? - Same place I got it before. Why not? You get knocked off, you might as well do it for a good sum. - Let me take a look at this. - Ow! What are you, nuts? Why don't you get some sleep. Why are you up? It's 4 a.m. You must be crazy, I'll tell you. - Go to sleep. Give me the key. The key. - I'll return it. - Give me the key. Thanks. Go to sleep. It's 4:00. Billy... ...you think you can get your friends to take Charles for a ride? You gotta dump two-thirds of the set. Simplify the orchestrations. The Spanish number. Cut the gypsies and the campfire. Did you ever hear of ""in one""? A curtain and me. See, I come out, and I'm Martha Graham. You see, Billy, in a tutu, I can be funny. If Little Eva was Jewish, maybe funny. - Time for us to part - I'll be twinkling So long, honey lamb I'll be keeping you Right here in my heart Watch me winkling Think of this as temporary Just a toodle-loo Toodle-Ioo to you too! Oh, God, was that a note! It was given to me by my friend Grace Moore on my birthday. Oy, was she glad to get rid of it. I gotta have more in the second act, a new number. What about Bert's number ""Clap Hands""? Where are the hands? - Another number that's gonna work. - It's working now. It's almost working. Get the sequins off the gloves. Hey, Clark, get the goddamn sequins off the gloves! Hey, Clark, get the goddamn sequins off the gloves! Yeah, listen, what can I tell you? He's a maniac. Listen, I didn't invent them. I'm just his press agent. - Did you call Buffalo? - I'm on it. Sorry, this evening's performance is sold out. Hey, we're sold out tonight? Hey, you hear? We're sold out. We're sold out. We're sold out. We're sold out. Hey! - Let's make this the last one. - Watch the silk. We're SRO tonight. We're SRO tomorrow night. Here's the picture. I'll take a celery tonic out of your shoe. Not from this shoe. This is a custom-made shoe. Give me my shoe. Give me something. Give me a nice tooth. You got a nice tooth. Give me an earring. Give me your hand. Get up off the floor. You'll ruin your pants. It's a new act. Brice and Rose. We go through life together. You better do a job on the four-sheets. You have to see it on an outhouse wall 200 yards away... ...going 60 miles an hour. No fine print. All that matters is, can they see it? Yellow and black. You got it? Good. You're such a slob. Why do you drop your shells? I gave you good advice. I hope you got it. - When I got you, I got it all. - Are you crazy? What? Nobody can touch a star? Stop that! I don't like being handled. Is that right? - Is that right? - Stop that! I am sorry, I really am. I'm so sorry. Billy, please. Can I help you brush your coat off? Billy, I just grabbed the first thing. I grabbed the first thing. Look, look. When we get into New York, I don't want posters, I want billboards. I want you to blanket Times Square. And full page ads in the Times. Got that? In the Times. And I want plugs from Winchell. You don't know what a billboard is gonna cost. What are you, a banker? Give me a cigarette. We'll bring in a hit. He's out there! He's with some 18-year-old, but he's out there. Get me out of this! He'll be here in two minutes. I don't wanna wear that black thing. No, I hate it! You gotta put something on. - Fanny. - What? - He's coming! - Is he alone? He ditched her! Quick, open the door! Oh, this goddamn makeup! Jesus, I got a run in my stockings. Hello, Fanny. Why, Nick, how good it is to see you. All the world changes but you. Over a year I've been practising that line. You want a drink or something? You want a cigarette? I'll call Adele. What do you want? I don't want a drink, and I don't want Adele. Is that for me? Don't open it now. Fanny, I... When you're a star, everything you do is magic. You don't have to entertain me, Fanny. It isn't necessary. - I can't say how good it is to see you. - Try. Wait a minute. I gotta do my number first, okay? Explain to me why I can't remember one thing I was gonna say. I'll remember my lines if I just don't have to look at you. I'll remember. - Fanny, I want to talk to you. - You don't have lines here. My turn. Nicky Arnstein, I love you so much. I don't blame you for divorcing me. You got hit by this steam engine the papers called Fanny Brice. By this made-up person the papers made up. And I can understand how you really had to dig yourself out. I really can. But I want to get off, Nicky. I just want to climb into your back pocket and stay there. - Fanny. - Just stay there all the time. You're married. I just didn't know how to tell you. - When? - Three months ago. To that girl? That beautiful girl I saw you sitting next to tonight? My wife was sitting on my other side. That old lady? She's 43. Forty-three and loaded, right? I'll always love you very much, Fanny. Who's that? We just wanted to congratulate her. Miss Brice isn't dressed yet. She all right? She said you should go on to the party without her. Take it. Go ahead. It's for you. - She's from Philadelphia. Here, Adele. - Thanks. She's got $12 million. She has an apartment in Paris, a house in Antibes. And she's got a yacht. So Nick can teach her how to be Ionely in all of them. Opening night present. He must've spent a whole week's allowance. Hey, did you see that? It came wrapped around the record. Yeah, from the company. Boy, it's been a swell opening night. Fanny... ...I'm sorry. I know you are, kid. Go to the party without me. I'll be along later. I just want a few minutes. You too, Adele. Why don't you just shut up! Ain't she got fun She's the luckiest one Satin on my shoulder And a smile on my lips How lucky can you get? Money in my pocket Right at my fingertips How lucky can you get? Every night a party Where the fun never ends You can circle the globe With my circle of friends Someone I am crazy for Is crazy for me I'm his personal pet Wow, how lucky can you get? Wrap it up and charge it That's my favourite phrase How lucky can you get? When I see the chauffeur Think I'll give him a raise How lucky can you get? Weekends in the country With a baron of course And a wardrobe to choke Mrs. Astor's pet horse Making merry music With the one that I love We're a perfect duet Can you get! Satin on my shoulder How lucky can you get? Money in my pocket How lucky can you get? Every night's a party Where the fun never ends You can circle the globe With my circle of friends Someone I am crazy for Is crazy for me I'm his personal pet Wow, how lucky can you get?

Satin on my shoulder And a smile on my lips Money in my pocket Right at my fingertips Wrap it up and charge it That's my favourite phrase When I see the chauffeur Think I'll give him a raise Life's a bed of roses Squirting perfume on me You can spare me the blues I don't sing in that key And if there's a man Who'd leave me I am happy to say I haven't run into him yet Gee, whee, wow! How lucky How lucky can you get? Look, just look at that. It's worse than ever. Fanny? Fanny. - Oh, my God, look! Is that Buck? - No, C.V. Silverstein. Silverstein from the Silverstein Movie Studios? Come visit me in California. Hey, push off with Bobby. I wanna talk to Fanny. Alone for once, okay? Come on, I wanna show you something. Come on. 48th and 10th. It's a theatre-cabaret. I'm gonna call it the Casa Maana. That's Mex for "" House of Tomorrow."" What, you gonna play a fair in Texas? You already got our show. They'll pay me 100,000 bucks. It's a big deal, the Texas Centennial. It's nice. Here, look. Classy, huh? - Too classy? - Too classy for what? Buffalos? I got some fan dancers. - How you fixed for feathers? - You're always on the hustle, Billy. So how long are you gonna be down there? Why, what do you care? I'm used to you. You're good for laughs. It's hot in here. This thing's gotta be a spectacle. I'm gonna get 50 girls in here. They're all gonna be 5'10"" or bigger. And, the closing number, I was thinking of all white. Maybe a wedding routine. Very impressive. How'd you like to star in a wedding bit? I paid retail. You want the goddamn ring or not? Speak up, I got a rehearsal. - You're asking me to marry you? - Yeah. - I mean serious? - Yeah! And I'm not gonna ask you again. So right now, yes or no? Yes or no? It ought to work out fine. You saying yeah? I'm saying yeah. I got a little confession to make. I never borrowed money from the mob, like I told you. You bastard. Making me think they had you on ice. It was a very good argument. You bought it. Only by now, you should know better. I wouldn't want you to think you married dumb. Darling... ...I do adore you. But you are absolutely mad. Tell me, why him? I fell in like with him. Do you have a light? Here. Oh! Did you see what that man did? It is a crunch. My wife, however, is determined to speak to Miss Brice. - Do you know her? - I married her. Of course. You must be... Rose. Billy Rose. Rose. - Crude little bastard. - Screw him, he's only in on a pass. - Have a nice evening, Mr. Brice. - Rose. No action in the club car? How many times I gotta tell you that I am not a gambler? - Did you do your knees yet? - No, I'm coming to them. I thought you did your knees before your heels. I do the heels first. Then I do the knees. - Every night. - Every night. By the time you finish that production, I get all mixed up. Mixed up what? I don't know what I should go for. I figure, maybe there's something I don't know about. Maybe I'm supposed to go do something to your goddamn knees or heels. You put perfume behind your knees? - You never did that before. - Yes, I did. Maybe I'm right. I should go for your knees? Will you forget about the knees? We're gonna arrive in Fort Worth at 7 a.m. Let's get some sleep. The heels before the knees. The knees after the heels, before the elbows. After the knees. Hang up your pants. You'll get there looking like two bits. - I'll get them pressed. - Why not just hang them up? Did Nick always hang up his pants? - Yes. - I'll pay the buck. Flinging your clothes makes the room look like a dump. I've never been in a train for three days with goddamn royalty. Here! How come you never go to the can? In the theatre you used to. It's none of your damn business. How come now we're married... ...and you never go to the can?! How do you think I feel having to go to the can all the time? You don't like being cooped up with me... ...there's an empty compartment. Hire it. I won't have to look at your crummy pajamas. What's wrong with them? I hate your pajamas! They're terrible. Well, I hate your lemons! And I hate your fancy bed junk! And where, where, tell me, where... ...do you come off reading a French magazine on our honeymoon? I know you can't read French! I look at the pictures, creep! I learn what goes! One thing that'll never go is your pajamas! Screw my pajamas! Screw them! And screw you, lady! And... - What? - Oh, God... What's the matter? Gave me a nosebleed. You gave me a goddamn nosebleed. Hold it, hold it, there. I'll get some ice. Okay, here. If you bleed on my good gown... When I stop, I'm gonna belt you one. Tough guy. Kid, you are some nut. Let me see. - Just lie still. - You know the trouble, Fanny? The trouble is that I love you. I love you. You could've told me. Put your best foot forward for the hell of it. I'm gonna take you to Sulka's and have some pajamas made for you. - They'll make pajamas for you? - Sure. Just like shirts. They make underwear too so it fits. You ain't getting me measured for no BVDs. Pajamas maybe, but no BVDs. Okay, okay. Go back to sleep. Billy. Billy! Shirley, will you get me that clipping, please? Would you let me read it to you first, then blow your stack? Okay. Shirley? "" Miracle Man of Broadway Billy Rose's beauteous Aqua Belle... ...Eleanor Holm sings Circe songs to Billy in Cleveland. Are you listening, Billy? Fanny, are you listening to Billy? Five years, five hits. Is this your first miss?"" Burn it. No, I can't kill a Winchell item, Billy. You know that. Well, what I can do is to prevent anybody else from running with it! You think I don't know how sore she'll be when she finds out? I'm close enough to get grabbed! The proofs. His name should be in another colour. Billy, what can I do? - Ned, did you order a sandwich? - Yes. You and Fanny wave to each other every six months from separate trains. How can I publicize that? What should I do? You want me to stage something on the tracks... ...where she flings your slippers after you as you whiz by? Ned, it's Miss Brice. Billy, Fanny's on the other phone. Tell him about the Hippodrome. I'm on the wire to Billy. He says he's very Ionely out there. The accountant thinks you better... I saw the poster, what about it? You want to kill the kid costume? Okay. We get out a flood of releases that you also sing. Big news. But if that's what you want, you got it. Hey, you wanna talk to Billy? Hold on a minute. Billy, talk to your wife for a minute. She's leaving for California tomorrow. Okay, go ahead. You'll knock them dead. I could use your advice. - I could use your advice. - What about? ""Circe songs?"" Don't listen, kid. Put cotton in your ears. - Okay. Fran sends you her love. - Give her my love. And you too, Fanny. Hang up now, let me talk to Ned. - Bye, good luck. - Bye, Billy. Ned? Yeah, Fanny? What can I do for you? Your California train? If it doesn't go through Cleveland, it's gotta go some place near. Want me to check that out for you? Sure, hold on. No, honey, it's my pleasure. Billy? Billy! Beautiful, let me see that. You gonna fly? - Mr. Rose, let's go. - It's about time. Would you get...? I thought you were in California. I thought you were in Cleveland by yourself. Introduce me. This is the champ, Eleanor Holm. - How do you do? - Just call me Mrs. Rose. As long as she doesn't call me Mr. Brice. - What are you doing here? - Oh, my train passed through. I got off to check him out. How's it going? - Places, everybody. - Excuse me. Back to work. Terrific break that you showed up. You couldn't have timed it better. I really think I got a hit. I feel it. I'd like to see what you think. Any advice you could give. You look... That's terrific. I love that suit. You should. It cost you $200. Mr. Rose, we need you up there. It's all right. Don't worry about me. Terrific. Come here. Here, sit here. You'll be all right? I'll see you in a bit. Hit the music! Stand by. Lights. Presenting the Billy Rose Aqua Belles. Give me a little celery tonic. Billy Rose's new star, Miss E leanor Holm. That's great, Billy. Terrific! Hey, come here. You wanna dance? Your star trout's got a lot of muscle. Don't let her get you in the water. Eleanor's a great kid. You ought to get to know her. Maybe we should have her for dinner. Amandine. I just made a joke. You didn't think it was funny? No, kidding. You got a great show. With an ace attraction. Ace. - You shouldn't kid a kidder, Fanny. - What? - You performed for me tonight. - What is that supposed to mean? I know you. I know how you think. When you want something, you get it by being funny. I've seen you do that before. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You went to a lot of trouble to make me laugh tonight. You got a very primitive sense of humour, kid. Pratfalls, dropped drawers, drowning bits. You know, I got a terrific idea. I don't know if it would work, but see what you think. - What's on your mind, kid? - Why don't we get married? We got married. No, I mean, really be married. Really married. Mrs. Rose is the name and chicken soup is the game. Is that what you want? What I want is... ...I want you to do more of what you did tonight. Brush off a broad if you think she's getting too close. You remember a long time ago, you made me say I need you? That's what I want. I want you to need me. I mean, really need me. Need me. You got some sexy ears, honey. I think I'll stick diamonds in them. I need you. I need you. I need you. Life, Colliers, Esquire, Stage? What is this? The Saturday Evening Post? You shouldn't get bored and pick up strange men. Are there any other kind? Billy, will you call me every night? Reverse the charges, if you want. Don't be a chump. I got a new system for beating the phone company. All aboard. I'm a mess, huh? All aboard. Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles. I'm gonna get you a bigger ring. - All right. - So long, Billy. All aboard. Billy? Don't go near the water. Norma, I cancelled the Baby Snooks rehearsal to come here? What is this? I get paid for wearing costumes. Stop "" kwetching."" You're gonna just love it. - We got seats next to the field. - Hi-Ho Silverstein, right? Oh, Fanny! So this is Beverly Hills. You can't catch up with the goyim. When you think you learned it... ...they come with sticks and hookers. - Chukkas. - "" Chukkas?"" Oh, I wish Billy was here. Billy loves baloney. When Norma promises you'll be excited, you'll be excited. - You know Nick? - Nick? Oh, Fanny, you don't think I planned anything. He just was here. Thank God you never had to learn to act. I wanna know if he knows I'm here. I'm absolutely certain he'd want to. I'll see you kids later. I'll send the car back. Quit while you're ahead. Don't try to walk on the water, kid. Why don't you come on out here? I'll send you a return ticket. You want a private car? I'll give my body to Huntington Hartford. Come on. No, I'm okay. No, I really am. I just miss you, kid. That's all. Look, if I get too Ionely, I'll send for Fran, right? Yeah, sure. No, don't be silly. Of course I understand. I'll talk to you next week, huh? Maybe sooner. Me too. So long, Billy. I'll see you. Goddamn it! And the thing is... ...I guess I wanna see him, talk to him. Just do what you want! How are you, kid? I'm not sure. A little nervous, I think. Me too. Like always. Did you ever think about directing? You got the wardrobe. - You look ravishing, old girl. - You look ravishing too. Didn't have time to change out of your polo clothes? Oh, yes, I had plenty of time. I tried to decide what I should wear. I looked in the mirror and saw how becoming this outfit was. So I just took a shower and put on the same. - I thought I might get by with it. - A new trick, telling the truth. What are you thinking? I was just remembering... ...when I first went out with you. I was still living home with Mama. I used to sleep in the same bed with her, and... ...once in the middle of the night I woke up kissing her. Then she woke up and said, ""This ain't Nick."" That's what I was thinking. How is your mother? She sold the saloons. She lives in Lakewood, New Jersey. - She likes Billy. - Oh, yes, Mr. Rose. How is Mr. Rose? He keeps busy. How about you? When you come down off your horse? When I come off my horse, there's the yacht and... ...a 13th-century palazzo we're rebuilding in Cap D'Antibe. The problems of dismantling are just staggering. I like dismantling much better than mantling. - Still the same Fanny. - You expecting Mrs. Roosevelt? I was expecting Fanny. Hoping for Fanny. You know, Fanny, the only trouble we had was money. That's not a problem now. No problem for you or for your wife? No problem for either of us. If I walk away, I walk away with a very large stake. How you fixed for toothbrushes, kid? Oh, God! I remember that first time in Baltimore. When I went up to your hotel room. And I went into your bathroom. Jesus! You had seven toothbrushes. Seven. I guess one for every day in the week. And you had this big wooden bowl with soap in it. "" By Appointment to His Majesty"" it says on the bowl. Royal soap. And hanging on the door were these silk pajamas. Red, with... ...a monogram, real tiny, tiny. That small. Class. Boy, did I come out of that bathroom with personality. I was all over the place... ...because I fell in love with those toothbrushes. Still have seven toothbrushes, Fanny. And all these years... ...I've been in love with nothing but a set of... ...goddamn toothbrushes. You have a daughter, you know. You haven't seen her in six years. And you don't even think to ask about her. You ask about Mama... ...but you don't inquire about your own daughter, you son of a bitch. - How is Fran? - She's great.

Here is Shep Fields with one of your favourites. Billy. - Oh, Miss Brice! - Oh, Jesus! Fanny! So just don't lay there, honey. Swim something. You always were a fast dresser. Sloppy, but fast. Fix your tie. Can I sit down? Yeah, sit. Alone at last. That was like a crummy burlesque sketch. I'm sorry, Fanny. I'm sorry. You know, I flew all the way to Cleveland in a plane. I had to get here fast so I could tell you my news. What news? I should have phoned. What news? I wanted to be with you when I told you. It's all over with Nick. I mean it, really over. Look, Billy. It's okay. You see, I figure what happened... ...was because I called you and I wanted to see Nick... ...and you got sore at me. You figured, screw her. And I don't blame you. I don't blame you. I mean it. You're entitled. So let's negotiate. I'm willing to forget it if you're willing to forget it. Fair? I'm in trouble, right? You really go for the trout. I go for her, Fanny. She's got a good shape. What else? To her I'm Nick. Do you love her? I don't know. I suppose so. She loves me. That's it, then. If you love her... ...there's nothing to discuss. I'd make a clean exit, but my train doesn't leave for another hour. I have to hang around here, so you better check out. See you in court, kid. Good luck, Fanny. Good luck, Billy. Daddy, I know how we can settle this whole thing right now. - How? - Let's go take a sock at them. This was the 10th anniversary of The Baby Snooks Show... ... from Hollywood, California. Hurry, I got company coming. I gotta get home and change. Hello, Fanny. Hello, kid. It's been a long time, huh? Sure has. So, how do you think I look? You look sensational. You look great. Thanks, kid. Why don't you...? How much did she take you for? Oh, I can afford her. Besides, the lady had a legitimate beef. - You don't know your lines. - What should I say? Eleanor's a bitch, and you've never seen me like this. - Seen you like what? - Like I am, you jerk, perfect! But I have. I've seen you like that. I mean, to me you always were perfect. - So, what'll you drink? - Celery tonic. - How's Fran? - Grown up. Gorgeous. Married. Thanks for asking, kid. - You're still good company, Billy. - Yeah? If I was such good company, how come we were never alone? Kid, we were four years married. That's not alone? - Remember? - Are you kidding? One of your best. You know what I was thinking about when I wrote that? Nick? That's right, Nick. Except you. Nick, Adele, Bobby and me. Being married to you was like being married to a parade. "" Me and My Shadow."" You used it in Cleveland. Let's not rehash Cleveland. You still get high on celery tonic? I took your advice. I bought that company. Now I make two cents while I enjoy. Billy, I gotta hand it to you. You got everything you ever went out for. But tell me something. You really have as much money as they say? All it takes to make a lot of money... ...is a lot of money. But what to do with it. I don't worry about you. You're resourceful. You know, Fanny... - I bought the Ziegfeld Theatre. - Really? The Ziegfeld's mine. I'll open up with the biggest show ever. Salvador Dali to do the sets. Stokowski in the pit. Music by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Sketches by Kaufman and Hart. Costumes from Paris, the best of everything. Real Alenon lace on the chorus girls' drawers. That sounds great, Billy. Who's gonna be in it? Well, for openers, you. Me? I knew you were on the hustle. Look, you haven't been on a stage in years. You're sitting out here doing that radio show. You're getting lazy. You're a Ziegfeld star, the star of stars. Name your figure. I give you whatever you want. I make a good living. I don't need the money. Maybe not, but you need me. You? You I've had. If you gotta get personal, it won't be complimentary. Professionally, I only helped you. In the work department, I was good for you. Come on, let's get together again, huh? You know something, my timing was always off for us. It's too bad. I just loused it all up. You don't get all the credit. Look, "" Billy Rose presents Fanny Brice."" I don't like the Billy. I'll think it over. You'll think it over? That's what you say to me? I haven't done anything without thinking in over 10 years. You want to know the truth? I was rattled as hell, you coming here tonight. I wanted for you to come in here begging me to come back... ...so I could have the pleasure of saying no. Taken me a long time to say no. I wanted to practise. That's what you're saying to me? No? I'm saying that I'll think it over, and I'll call you. - Think fast. - I don't wanna. That's the point. I'm at the Beverly Hills till day after tomorrow. So, yes or no? So I'll call you before noon, day after tomorrow. Make it yes. Rose and Brice. Brice and Rose, whatever. We could have a terrific time. Make it yes. Huh, Fanny? Start the drumming Sound the cymbal All my worries Fill a thimble I need you. So come on, kids Let's hear it for me 'Cause now I'm not afraid Those butterflies are gone My act is looking great I can't wait to go on And on Grab a ticket Find your row, kid We'll be strictly SRO, kid And I'm glad to say I'm finally free Oh, your head feels so good When you finally clear it If I saw a worry I wouldn't go near it Come on, now Let's hear it for me Subtitles by SDI Media Group, His name was Jeremiah Johnson. They say he wanted to be a mountain man. The story goes that he was a man of proper wit and adventurous spirit... suited to the mountains. Nobody knows where he came from, and it don't seem to matter much. He was a young man... and ghosty stories about the tall hills didn't scare him none. He was looking for e Hewkin gun, 50 caliber or better. He settled for e 30, but damn, it was e genuine Hewkin. You couldn't do no better. Bought a horse, traps and other truck that went with being a mountain man. And said goodbye to whatever life was down below. Where is it I could find bear, beaver, other critters worth cash skinned? Ride due west as the sun sets. Turn left at the Rocky Mountains. This here 's his story. ""I, Hatchet Jack..."" being of sound mind and broken legs... do hereby leaveth my bear rifle... to whatever finds it. Lord hope it be a white man. It is a good rifle... and killed the bear that killed me. Anyway, I am dead. ""Yours truly, Hatchet Jack."" Ha, ha! A 50 caliber Hawkin! Come on, you. That'll be far enough, pilgrim! Where are you? You're a fine target, pilgrim! Empty your hand. I ain't seen no live man in 2 months. I am Bear Claw Chris Lapp. Blood kin to the grizzly that bit Jim Bridger's ass! You are molesting my hunt! - I am... - I know who you are! You're the same dumb pilgrim I've been hearing for 20 days... and smelling for 3! How come you ain't been scalped? Ain't been too lucky? - No. - This place has been trapped out since '25. Why are you here? I hunt griz. - Griz? - Grizzly bears, pilgrim. I collect the claws. I had one in that thicket. Ready to shake hands, until you came! I'm sorry, then. You look it! Hungry too? Come on. You know how to skin griz? I can skin most anything. You sure are cocky for a starving pilgrim. There she be. Go in, get warm, eat something. I've got a chore to finish. My boy! Are you sure that you can skin griz? Just as fast as you can find them. Jesus! Skin that one, pilgrim, and I'll get you another! Must have missed another war down there. Didn't miss nothing. If I head due west tomorrow, will I find places to trap? If you head due west or any place tomorrow, you'll be starving in a week. You ain't likely to meet someone like me. Mountain's got its own ways. What? Use that skin pad, pilgrim, before you lose all your fingers. What you learned down in the flat will serve you no good up here. You got some work to do. Utes and Flatheads... are generally peaceful critters. Crows, they are fearful. Mighty warriors too. In my opinion, the Crows are the handsomest Indians there is. And proud too. There ain't a man alive can match them on a horse. I've seen them ride with one foot on the horse's rump... one wrist through a loop in the mane... shooting arrows and guns under the horse's neck! But they are an adulterous people. Adulterous. Here you are, pilgrim. Sharp enough to scale a fish with. Ever get lonesome? For what? Woman? Full-time night woman? I never could find no tracks in a woman's heart. I packed a Squaw for 10 years, pilgrim. Cheyenne, she was. And the meanest bitch that ever balled for beads! I lodgepoled her at Dead Wolf Creek and traded her for a Hawkin gun! Don't get me wrong, I love the women, I surely do! But I swear... a woman's breast is the hardest rock... the Almighty ever made on Earth... and I can find no sign on it. Now these coals here will simmer until sunrise. You better go do likewise. Didn't put enough dirt down. Saw it right off. You track well, pilgrim. - Kind of like it, don't you? - Maybe. Figures. A human man... likes tracking and killing. An Injun, he figures it's natural. Wind's right. But he'll just run, soon as we step out of these trees. Trick to it. Walk out on this side of your horse. What if he sees our feet? Elk don't know how many feet a horse has. No, you damn fool! Slide it up over the saddle! You got him, pilgrim! You nailed him clean. We got us an elk to skin! Can't figure people there eating hog when they could feed on elk. Didn't like it down there? - Ought to have been different. - Is that so? Many a child journeys this high to be different. To get from here what their natures couldn't get them below. It comes to nothing. Can't cheat the mountain, pilgrim. Mountain got it... Probably Crow. They'll steal our horses unless we bribe them. Why? It's their territory. They figure we're trespassing. Yep, Crow. Paints-His-Shirt-Red. That's his sign. Just stand still. You two know each other? I saw him once. He says you fish poorly. You understand their language? Paints-His-Shirt speaks English, he just does this to aggravate me. Says he's got enough bear claws. Hold that. What's your name? Johnson. Your Christian name? Jeremiah. You've learned well, pilgrim. You'll go far. Providing you ain't burnt alive or scalped. I will do my best. You can out wood and leave it up on the Judith. Riverboat captains will leave you gold if you put out a pouch. Good thing to know... if times get hard. Watch your topknot. Yes. Watch yours. I told you not to go play outside. You got yourself all dirty... and also, young lady... without your shoes. And you, Josh... dirty! Look at you! There, now! Mary Lou, you knew better than to go out in the sun... Have I told you not to go out... without a bonnet on your head? You better stop there. Woman, I am your friend. We have graves to dig. You were borne on the wind today. Josh was being a bad boy. I must tell your father. Time to start the garden. If the wind would stop. We will now sing. Shall we gather at the river Where bright angel feet have trod With its crystal tide forever Flowing by the throne of God Yes, we'll gather at the river The beautiful, the beautiful river Gather with the saints at the river That flows by the throne of God Boy, did you see all this? Better get one of these biscuits, boy. I make damn good biscuits. Here's food. I could not find your husband anywhere, ma'am. So, maybe he will come back here. The Indians will not bother you now, on account of... you are touched. They will be afraid. What about the boy? Maybe you and the boy best come with me now. I will take you down to the Judith. Put you on a ferry. Take him. - What? - Take him! Ma'am, I wouldn't know how to tend after... You got a name, boy? Huh? I will call you Caleb. It is a name I have always admired. You like that? Caleb? Do what you like. I was much the same myself. Damn! Are you all right? Sure, I got a fine horse under me! Got one of them feathers in my nose. Keep sneezing, it'll come out all right. Haven't seen anyone pass by recently, have you? Nobody's gone in front of me. Can't say what's happened behind me though. The Injuns put you here? It weren't Mormons. A chief, name of Mad Wolf. Nice fellow, don't talk a hell of a lot. You wouldn't have an extra hat on you, would you? Shade's getting scarce in these parts. Why did you shave your head? Mad Wolf figures like every other Injun I know. Says this scalp ain't fit for no decent man's lodgepole. Ain't the first time I protected my head in such a way. Name's Del Gue. With an ""E."" - When did they come through? - A few hours ago. I will be happy to see my horse. I hate walking. I knew you would help me get my pelts back. I wouldn't leave a man without a horse or gun. Ain't that Hatchet Jack's rifle? Yeah. How did you get it? I found him, froze to a tree. Damn! That Hatchet Jack was a wild one. He was living with a female panther. Two years in a cave up in the Musselshell. She never did get used to him. That be them. - How many you figure? - Three. Just like before. Are you smelling them Blackfeet? No, I'm locating my horse. Dirtiest animal this side of hell. Come dark, you give me your pistol. Load that bear rifle full of nails. No. I got no truck with them Blackfeet. I plan to be here a long time. I do not want them down on me. Them critters hammered me into the ground. Took my rifle, horse. Stole my pelts. Not to mention what they done to that boy's folks! Then let it pass? Nope. But they'll be asleep soon. Should be no trouble to slip in there and then get your possibles. Use this blanket, boy. To keep you warm. He don't say a lot, does he? No. Hey. No. No. Stay here with the animals. No! I am Del Gue! I can whip my weight in Wolverines... straight through a crab apple orchard on a flash of lightning! You've stolen my pelts! And die, you must! You skinheaded son of a bitch, you almost got me killed! Where are you going? Don't you want any of these? What? Scalps! No. Mother Gue never raised such a foolish child. Stop that, boy. - What do you do with the scalps? - Sell them to the English. English? London is wallpapered with Injun scalps. - Let's pull into those trees. - Don't go getting hasty. Them is Flatheads, and they've hurt nobody that I know. Just hold back. - What's he saying? - Says they're Blackfeet ponies. He asks if you are the great warrior... who avenges the Crazy Woman in the Wolf Tail Valley. She's big medicine. And so are you, if you are that man. - So what's he shouting for? - Scared of you. - But how did you...? - I didn't know they'd be Flatheads. It's all right, boy. Chief here is named Two-Tongues Lebeaux. Mighty educated too. French missionaries taught him their language. - Christian Indians? - Lots of them. He says the scalps are fierce and the horses are fleet. Take them. Take them. And the ponies. I have no further use for them. Damn fool, you may have cooked our brains! Why? He brought us here to honor you and you want to give him a gift. If he cannot give you a better one, it'll be an insult. What's so funny? The danger is over. He has thought of a better gift. - His daughter. - Huh? Now you have a son, you need a wife. - I don't want no wife... - He says he'll be very happy. What is that word? Oh, yes! He may read the Bible, but he's still an Injun. And his rules is his rules. If you value your hair, you will get married! Del Gue, I do not think this is funny. It ain't. When you leave, you can take her to Fort Hawley and sell her. But you best take her, friend. Besides, maybe she ain't near bad. He says she's called The Swan, but she'll answer to anything you want. But maybe you need her. You turn down this gift, they'll slit you, me, Caleb and the horses... from crotch to eyeball with a dull deer antler! Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Johnson. Your husband has told me so much about you. Congratulations, Two-Tongues. Wonderful wedding. - Bye, Jeremiah Johnson! - Where are you going? I wouldn't want to disturb your wedding night. I'll see you in the fall. Have a nice honeymoon, Mrs. Johnson. Do you speak any English? I don't speak any Flathead. So don't bother me, neither of you! Wondering about something? Go ahead, ask. Leave it be. Nothing wrong with quiet. Cooking sure don't smell like Bear Claw's. Tie him off, boy. Suppertime! Go on, boy, and eat. It's good for you. No. I'm full. You religious too? Religious. I'm not going to harm you. Religious. Yes. Yes. I'm not going to harm you. Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes. Ain't that a lot easier than saying all that gibberish? Yes! Great hunter. Yes. - Yes. - Yeah. Fine figure of a man, yes? Yes? - Yes. - That is all you need to know. For now. You getting enough, boy? Yes. This wasn't my idea, you know? Lord! ThiS'll do. River in front, cliffs behind. Good water. Not much wind. This will be a good place to live. Hawk. Yeah. Going for the Musselshell. It'd take me a week's riding. And he'll be there in... Hell, he's there already. I wish you would see fit to stop the practicing of these ceremonies. NO! Caleb, take notice of the traps and go fetch some proper food. And keep your nose open, there may be Indians about. Be going for buffalo soon. No, you'll stay here. Here. Go on, fetch the rest of that wood. Ch. Swan, I cannot stand this weight. Well... It will have to do. Johnson. It will keep me warm in the strong wind. And the rain will not pass through neither. Thank you. You have beaver scent? What happened to your face? Huh? My beard? Watch this. Spring. There. Careful, that'll take your hand off. Put that smell down. Won't come around without the smell. Hell, don't run off. It's me. What? Skin this. Troop, halt! Johnson? I'm Lieutenant Mulvey, Third Cavalry. That's Reverend Lindquist. We've been watched since we started to climb up from the Gila. Who are they, Flathead? I said, are they Flathead? - Did I say something? - No. It's been a long time... since I had... so much of the English language spoke at me. I ain't used to it. Crow. This is Crow land. This is the Department of Colorado. - Yeah. - You're on good terms with them. Crow? Who gave you that idea? People talk about it down below. You live up here. I do that. And you know the high country. Do you know Feather Mesa? I do. So? We have wagons there. Three of them. Broke down in the snow and ice. We got to get them out of there before they freeze. Gr the Indians get them. Would be wise. We were told that you would know how to get there. Through those passes. We were hoping that maybe... These are Christian families. Christian women and children, starving. Do you mean that you intend to let those people die? How's the war going? Which war? One against the President of Mexico. It's over. Who won? Did you hear something? Can't go through here. Why not? Crow burial ground. Sacred. - We'll have to turn around and head east. - How far east? Next pass. Twenty... 20 miles or so. Those people are waiting for us! They're freezing, hungry and scared. Crow only come with medicine men and burying parties! - We are not Crows! - What would happen? I don't know. I don't know. This is big medicine. They guard it with spirits. You don't believe that. It doesn't matter. They do. You've been up here too long, believing in this! What chance would I have finding a way through, just by riding west? Poor chance. Or none. Thanks all the same, Johnson, but we're riding through. Sergeant! Prepare to move! You won't make it. You have to hunt, you said. I have to try. Tell your men to keep behind me in single file. Tell them to go slow and stay quiet. - Sergeant! - Sir. Single file, slowly. Yes, sir. Keep them quiet. Well, we seem to have escaped. How long have you been carrying your Squaw? - Thank you... - Move them fast. Crow don't take kindly to trespassing. Where's your mule that kicks holes in the sky and shakes off its saddle? Where's your slavering wolf of the rolling prairie? Here's your old grizzer brown bear can clobber bark off a gum tree. There's a man for you, Jeremiah Johnson. I'm half horse, half gator, and a touch of the earthquake. I got the prettiest gal, fastest horse... ugliest dog this side of hell. I can outjump, outrun, throw down... drag out and whip any man in all Kentucky. How you been, Jeremiah? Staying alive, Del. Ain't that hair I see on your head? It sure is. I've decided that when I depart from this life, I'd leave something. At least to be remembered on some man's lodgepole. Sound wisdom. - Where you headed? - Same place you are, Jeremiah. Hell in the end. With all them Injuns after you, I cannot brag about your campsite. You got old and scary since you growed hair on your head? What ever happened to that boy? The one that didn't talk much? Never did take him to Hawley. Stayed with that Injun gal all this time? She wasn't no trouble. Just like this, one at a time? You're lucky they were Crows. Apaches would send 50 at once. Amongst Injuns... a tribe's greatness is figured on how mighty its enemies be. Maybe... Maybe you'd best go down to a town... get out of these mountains. I've been to a town, Del. Which way now? Don't know. I hear the Big Belt in the Blue has beavers the size of bobcats. That so? I ain't never trapped either... but sure would like to. - Jeremiah- - You will do well, Del. You will do well. If you don't get in too much trouble with all that hair. Ain't this something? I told my pap and mam I was coming to the mountains... to trap and be a mountain man. Acted like they was gut-shot. Says: ""Son..."" make your life go here. Here's where the people is. ""Them mountains is for animals and savages!"" I said: ""Mother Gue..."" the Rocky Mountains is the marrow of the world."" And by God, I was right. Yes, you were. Which way you headed, Jeremiah? Canada, maybe. I hear there's land there a man has never seen. Keep your nose in the wind... your eyes along the skyline. I will do that, Del Gue. I ain't never seen them, but my common sense tells me... the Andes is foothills, and the Alps is for children to climb. Keep good care of your hair! These here are God's finest sculpturings... and there ain't no laws for the brave ones! And there ain't no asylums for the crazy ones! And there ain't no churches except this right here. And there ain't no priests... excepting the birds! I are a mountain man! And I'll live until an arrow or bullet finds me. And then I'll leave my bones... on this great map of the magnificent... Right here, mister. Where's the crazy woman? She's gone. Walk over this way. Gone where? Dead. One of them mounds. Who are you? My name's Qualen. I'm a settler. Settler. What are you going to do? I do it when Indians are coming. You're him. Ain't you him? What's this? It's for you. If you be Johnson. A might early, ain't they? It ain't a grave like the other. More like a statue or a monument. We never see them. We never even hear them. We look and there's e new piece of bone or hide, or somethings been left. So we know they've been here. Some say you're dead on account of this. Others say you never will be on account of this. It won't save anything. Huh? Sending them out to hide in the corncrib. What's on the spit? Grown particular? Not about feeding. Just the company I keep. Thank you kindly. You've come far, pilgrim. Feels like far. Was it worth the trouble? What trouble? You cook good rabbit, pilgrim. Cold up here. - What brings you up so high? - Griz. Griz. Avalanche took the cabin. Lost my mule. We swum out of it. But no matter. Weren't no griz left anyway. Would you happen to know what month of the year it is? No, I truly wouldn't. I'm sorry, pilgrim. March. Maybe April. March, maybe. I don't believe April. Winter's a long time going? Yeah. Stays long this high. March is a green, muddy month down below. Some folks like it. Farmers mostly. You have done well to keep so much hair... when so many are after it. I hope you will fare well., ""In the decade of the 1930s even the great city of Metropolis... ""... was not spared the ravages of the worldwide depression. ""In the times of fear and confusion... ""... the job of informing the public was the responsibility... ""... of the Daily Planet. ""A great metropolitan newspaper... ""... whose reputation for clarity and truth had become a symbol of hope... ""... for the city of Metropolis."" This is no fantasy. No careless product of wild imagination. No, my good friends... ...these indictments... ...I've brought you today... ...specific charges listed herein against the individuals... ...their acts of treason. Their ultimate aim of sedition. These... ...are matters of undeniable fact. I ask you now to pronounce judgment... ...on those accused. On this... ...this mindless aberration... ...whose only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction. On the woman, Ursa... ...whose perversions and unreasoning hatred of all mankind... ...have threatened even the children of the Planet Krypton. Finally, General Zod. Once trusted by this Council... ...charged with maintaining the defense of the Planet Krypton itself. Chief Architect of this intended revolution and author of this insidious plot... ...to establish a new order amongst us... ...with himself as absolute ruler. You have heard the evidence. The decision of the Council will now be heard. Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El. It has therefore now become your decision. You alone will condemn us if you wish... ...and you alone will be held responsible by me! Join us! You have been known to disagree with the Council before. Yours could become an important voice in the new order, second only to my own! I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El! Take it! Join us! You will bow down before me, Jor-El. I swear it! No matter that it takes an eternity! You will bow down before me! Both you and then one day... ...your heirs! Forgive me, forgive me... An unpleasant duty has been masterly performed, Jor-El. They have received the fate they deserved. Isolation in the Phantom Zone... ...an eternal living death. A chance for life, nonetheless. As opposed to us. It's suicide. No, it's worse, it's genocide. Be warned, Jor-El. The Council has already evaluated this outlandish theory of yours. My friends, you know me to be neither rash nor impulsive. I am not given to wild unsupported statements... ...and I tell you that we must evacuate this planet immediately. Jor-El, you are one of Krypton's greatest scientists. Yes, but so is Vond-Ah. I don't question your data. The facts are undeniable. It's your conclusions we find unsupportable. This planet will explode within 30 days. If not sooner. I tell you Krypton is simply shifting its orbit. Jor-El... ...be reasonable. My friend... ...I have never been otherwise. This madness is yours. This discussion is terminated. The decision of the Council is final. Any attempt by you to create... ...a climate of fear and panic among the populace... ...must be deemed by us an act of insurrection. You would accuse me of insurrection? Has it now become a crime to cherish life? You would be banished to endless imprisonment... ...in the Phantom Zone: The eternal void... ...which you, yourself discovered. Will you abide by the Council's decision? I will remain silent. Neither I, nor my wife... ...will leave Krypton. Have you finished? Nearly. It's the only answer, Lara. If he remains here with us... ...he will die as surely as we will. But why Earth, Jor-El? They're primitives, thousands of years behind us. He will need that advantage to survive. Their atmosphere will... ...sustain him. He will defy their gravity. He will look like one of them. He won't be one of them. No. His dense molecular structure will make him strong. He'll be odd. Different. He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable. Isolated. Alone. He will not be alone. He will never be alone. The energy input to Jor-El's quarters is now in excess. Our data indicates the loss is due to a misuse of energy. Investigate. And if the investigation proves correct? He knew the penalty he faced. He even is a member of this Council. The law will be upheld. You will travel far, my little Kal-El. But we will never leave you. Even in the face of our death... ...the richness of our lives... ...shall be yours. All that I have, all that I've learned, everything I feel... ...all this and more, I... ...I bequeath you, my son. You will carry me inside you... ...all the days of your life. You will make my strength your own... ...see my life through your eyes... ...as your life will be seen through mine. The son becomes the father, and the father... ...the son. This is all I... ...all I can send you, Kal-El. ...which Einstein called his theory of relativity.

Chief among these powers will be your sight... ...your strength, your hearing... ...your ability to propel yourself at almost limitless speed. The early history of our universe was a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war. Each of the six galaxies which you will pass through... ...contain their own individual law of space and time. It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. - What! - What was that? Now wouldn't that beat all get out. Well, you... Oh, Pa! Oh, my. All these years, as happy as we've been... ...how I've prayed the good Lord would see fit to give us a child. Honey, will you hand me that rag up there. You take things easy now. Remember what Doc Frye said about that heart of yours. Now the first thing we've got to do when we get home is find out... ...who that boy's proper family is. He hasn't got any. Not around here, anyway. Are you thinking what I think you are thinking? We could say he's the child of my cousin in North Dakota... ...and just now orphaned. Jonathan, he's only a baby. Martha, now you saw how we found him. Martha Clark Kent, are you listening to what I'm saying? Come on, gang. That was a great game. All right. Come on, hustle, let's go. Stack your helmets neatly. Remember about the uniforms, cleaned and washed... ...by tomorrow, and looking like a football team. Let's have those clothes washed and ready for tomorrow's game. Got to beat Mount Vernon High. Can you give me a lift? Lana? Don't bother with these. I'll take them in with the other equipment. - Thank you, Clark. - Sure. Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up to Mary Ellen's. Play some records. Would you like to come? Sure. Sounds like it could be a lot of fun. Kent can't make it. Still got a lot of work to do. What are you talking about? I've just finished stacking... All that? Oh, Brad! Hey, come on, Lana. Come on, let's go. - He has to clean up. - 'Bye, Clark. - 'Bye, Lana. - Clean this up, Clark. 'Bye, Clark. 'Bye, Clark. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye. Golly! I saw a boy out there run as fast as the train! Faster, even! Lois Lane, you have a writer's gift for invention. - I'll say that for you. - But... Lois, please read your book. No one ever believes me. Hey, look, there's Clark! Clark? How did you get here so fast? I ran. Ran, huh? Told you he was an oddball, let's get out of here. Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son? I didn't mean to show off, Pa. It's just that guys like that Brad, I just want to tear them apart. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know I shouldn't. Yeah, I know you can do all these amazing things... ...and sometimes you think that you will just go bust... ...unless you can tell people about it. - Yeah. - That's right. I mean, every time I get the football I can make a touchdown. - That's for sure. - Every time. Is it showing off when somebody's doing the things he's capable of doing? Is a bird showing off when it flies? No, now, you listen to me. When you came to us, we thought... ...people would take you away... ...when they found out the things that you do. It worried us a lot. Then when a man gets older and he thinks very differently. And things get very clear. And there's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason. I don't know whose reason, or whatever the reason is... ...maybe it's because... I don't know. But I do know one thing. It's not to score touchdowns. Thanks, Dad. I'll race you to it. Yeah. You will? Run. Come on, come on. Move, move. Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron. Jonathan! Dad. All those things I can do... ...all those powers... ...and I couldn't even save him. Clark, get up. Good morning, Smiley. Clark, breakfast. Are you going to sleep all day? Clark, come on. Get up. I have to leave. I knew this time would come. We both knew it from the day we found you. I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday. He said that he'd be happy to help out from now on. Mother! I know, Son. I know. Do you know where you're headed? North. Remember us, Son. Always remember us. My son... ...you do not remember me. I am Jor-El. I am your father. By now you will have reached your eighteenth year... ...as it is measured on Earth. By that reckoning... ...I will have been dead for many thousands of your years. The knowledge... ...that I have of matters, physical and historical... ...I have given you fully on your voyage to your new home. These are important matters to be sure... ...but still matters of mere fact. There are questions to be asked... ...and it is time for you to do so. Here, in this... ...this fortress of solitude... ...we shall try to find the answers together. So, my son... ...speak. Who am I? Your name is Kal-El. You are the only survivor of the Planet Krypton. Even though you were raised as a human, you are not one of them. You have great powers, only some of which you have... ...as yet discovered. Come with me now, my son... ...as we break through the bars of your earthly confinement. Traveling through time and space. Your powers will far exceed those of mortal men. It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. Rather let your leadership stir others to. In the next year, we shall examine the human heart. It is more fragile than your own. As we pass through the flaming turmoil which is the edge of your own galaxy... ...we will enter the realm of the red Krypton sun... ...source of your strength and nourishment... ...and cause of our eventual destruction. The Planet Krypton, my son... ...your home as it was. This year we shall examine the various concepts of immortality... ...and their basis in actual fact. The total accumulation of all knowledge spanning the 28 known galaxies... ...is embedded in the crystals which I have sent along with you. Study them well, my son. By the time you return to the confines of your galaxy... ...twelve of your years will have passed. For this reason, among others... ...I have chosen Earth for you. It is now time for you to rejoin your new world... ...and to serve its collective humanity. Live as one of them, Kal-El... ...and discover where your strength and your power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason, above all, their capacity for good... ...I have sent them you... ...my only son. Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet. Fresh fruit! Hey, how about a tomato, lady? Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables. Smile. How many ""T's"" in ""bloodletting""? Two. What are you writing? An ode to spring. How do you spell ""massacre""? M- a-s-s-a-c-r-e. Thanks. Golly, how come you get all the great stories? A good reporter doesn't get great stories. A good reporter makes them great. Chief, here's that story on the murder case. The way I see it, it's a headline on the front page with my picture... There's only one ""P"" in ""rapist."" Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent. Hello, Miss Lane, how are... How are you doing? Jimmy Olsen, photographer. Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you. It's got everything: Sex, violence, the ethnic angle. So does a lady wrestler with a foreign accent. - Kent, can you open this? - Sure, Mr. White. This could be the basis for a series of articles: ""Making Sense of Senseless Killings"" by Lois Lane. We get psychologists, sociologists, interviews... Lois, you're pushing a bunch of rinky-dink tabloid garbage. The Daily Planet has a tradition... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shake it up like that. Of course not, Lois. Why would any one want to make a total stranger look like a fool? I'll take that. Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White. Why do I pay you $40 a week when I should have you arrested for loitering? - Go get Mr... a towel. - Kent. - Move, kid, move. - Right, Chief. - Make mine black, no sugar. - Right, Chief. And don't call me sugar. Right... Sugar. Chief wants coffee, no sugar. I'll take tea with lemon. Lois, why don't you take Kent out to meet everybody, huh? Just introduce him around. He's starting on the paper today. I'm giving him the City beat. Chief! That's my beat! Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just a mild-mannered reporter... ...but not only does he know how to treat his Chief with the proper respect... ...not only does he have a snappy, punchy prose style... ...but he is, in my 40 years in this business, the fastest typist I've ever seen. That's great. Here, you forgot my article. Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering... ...if you could arrange for half my salary... ...to be sent to this address on a weekly basis. Your bookie, right? My what? Don't tell me! He sends a check every week to his sweet, gray-haired mother. Actually, she's silver-haired. I'll see what I can do. Thank you very much, Mr. White. Well? Any more at home like you? Not really, no. I didn't think so. Well, get yourself a desk over here. Over here? Here, there's some paper and a file right there. Sorry. - Hi, Bill Breesen. - Hi, Clark Kent. - Nice to meet you. - Welcome aboard. - Here's your towel, Mr. Clark. - Kent. - What? - Kent. - Clark Kent. - Jimmy Olsen. - I met this really great guy, you know. - Hey, fabulous. We had this fabulous weekend. I met him at this dude ranch. I haven't been since I was seven. - I got to mail these letters. - Good luck tonight. - Hi, Clark. - Hi, Lois. How did you like your first day on the job? The hours were sort of longer than I expected... ...but on the whole, meeting you and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White... Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell. - ""Swell""? - Yup. You know, Clark... ...there are very few people left in the world... ...who feel comfortable saying that word. - What word? - Swell. Really? I always thought it was kind of natural. - Sorry. - Clark. - Sorry, Lois. - Hi, Rex. - Did you see anything good today? - Not until you came along. Rex, this is... - Clark Kent. How do... - See you... Lois? Hey, where you going? Can I help you with your coat? - Thanks, can you get that? - Sure. Did you like Mr. White? He was a nice guy and Jimmy was fantastic. Come here. Come on. Get in here, hurry up. Come on. We'd better get out of here. We'd better do what he says, Lois. Come on, get in here, quick. Don't, don't do anything. It's all right, I'm coming. We're coming. Excuse me. - Here? - Yeah, yeah. Don't point that at me, sir. You could hurt somebody with that. Okay, okay. Hold it there. Just a minute. Now I realize that... ...times are tough for some these days, but this isn't the answer. You can't solve society's problems with a gun. You know, buddy, you're right. - I'm going to turn over a new leaf. - Good for you. That's the spirit. He doesn't really want to hurt anyone. Right after I rip off this lady's purse. Of course! Now come on, lady, hand it over. Lois, I think you'd better... Lois! What are you doing? Are you all right? What happened? - Golly, I guess I must have fainted. - Fainted? - You fainted! - I'm sorry. Really, Lois, supposing that man had shot you? Is it worth risking your life over $10... ...two credit cards, a hairbrush and a lipstick? - How did you know that? - Know what? You described the exact contents of my purse. Wild guess. Taxi! - Hey! - Hi, Otis. So, what's happening, partner? Look what we got. Let's take him. Wait a minute. Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself. Lex Luthor? You got it, Aramus. We'll make Captain by midnight. Hey, what do you read? XK-101 rocket to be used. Hey, what do you read? - Hey, Matt. - Hi, Otis. Just getting a Daily Planet here. Okay. All right. See, I'm paying him, and I got a pretzel, too. Thanks, Otis. How many bags, Shutzy? This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot. Over and out. Let's go. Your attention, please. The Metropolis Flyer is now ready for departure... ...on the upper level. Track 6. He's going down on a train platform. I'm going after him. Okay, I'll call for backup. Be careful now, will you? All right, Aramus. All right. Now boarding on the lower level... Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars, Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie... Board now. All aboard. Metropolis Transportation to Buffalo, Syracuse... Smoking cars are forward, move along now. Luggage at the top. Smoking cars are forward. All aboard, boarding. Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22. I've seen him and I'm right on him. Lower level, Track 22. So that's it! It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to keep those legs moving. Harry... Harry, where are you? Harry? Sick! Sick, you're really sick! I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher? Sick when we're days from executing the crime of the century? No. Step away from that, please. How do you choose to congratulate the greatest criminal mind of our time? Do you tell me that I'm brilliant? Oh, no, that would be too obvious, I grant you. Charismatic? Fiendishly gifted? Try twisted! Get away from that, get away! Tell me, Lex. Why do so many people have to die for the crime of the century? Why? You ask why? Why does the phone always ring when you're in the bathtub? Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader of our time... ...surrounding himself with total nincompoops? I'm back, Mr. Luthor. I was just talking about you. You were followed again. In spite of those cat-like reflexes. Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry. Is that the newspaper I asked you to get me? Yes. Then why am I not reading it? Because I haven't given it to you yet? Right. At last it's official. Thanks to the help of the US Government... ...we are about to be involved in the greatest real-estate swindle of all time. Lex, what is this... ...obsession with real estate? All the time, ""land, land, land."" When I was 6 years old, my father said to me... ""Get out! "" Before that, he said, ""Son, stocks may rise and fall... ""... utilities and transportation systems may collapse... ""... people are no damn good, but they'll always need land... ""... they'll pay through the nose to get it."" - ""Remember,"" my father said... - ""Land."" It's a pity that he didn't see... ...from such humble beginnings how I've created this empire. An empire. This? How many girls do you know have a Park Avenue address like this? Park Avenue address, 200 feet below? Do you realize what people are shelling out up there... ...for a few miserable rooms off a common elevator. What more could anyone ask? Get this Loch Ness update right into composing. Yeah, no that's it, Roth. Put it to bed, right. Why are you standing here for? I'm not. - I wasn't going to say it. - Go. The sex maniac profile. Right. Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet? There's no ""Z"" in ""brassiere."" Nice job on that union scandal, Kent. Gosh, thanks, Mr. White. Hi, Clark. Good night. - Here, let me carry that for you. - Thanks a lot. Lois, have you got a minute? Excuse me, please. And these two go to the addresses on the envelope, okay? I was wondering if you'd have dinner with me? I'm sorry, I'm booked. Air Force One is landing at the airport. This kid'll be there to make sure... ...you-know-who answers the questions he would rather duck. Don't you ever let up? What for? I mean I've seen how the other half lives. My sister, for instance. Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage. I would go bananas in a week. - Can I take you to the airport? - Not unless you can fly. ""Ladies."" I have to change, thank you. Goodbye. Maybe we could... - Would you mail that for me? Thanks. - Sure. Good night. Going down, please, going down. Going down? Going up. Up, up. Good night. Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground. Planet One, go ahead. Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight. We're on our way over the river. Have one aboard for transfer. Over. Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land. Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9. Roger, Over and out. A malfunction, can't get lift off. - You've hooked a cable. - What's happening? Set it down. My God, we've lost motor control. I can't hold it. I can't hold it. He's lost it. Wake up. Help! Step back, folks. Get back. Move over to the other side of the street. Bring the canvas here. Get it up there. There's a helicopter up there. Help me. All right, folks. Let's move back. Let these firemen get in here. Help me! Hold it. Get back. Get off the street, folks. All right, get along there. Get away from the side of the building. Hold these crowds back. Move. Help! Say, Jim... Excuse me. That's a bad outfit. Okay, move these people. My God! Look up there. What the hell's that? Easy, miss. I've got you. You've got me? Who's got you? I can't believe it, I just cannot believe it. He got her. Gentlemen, this man needs help. I hope this little incident hasn't put you off flying, miss. Statistically speaking, of course, it's still the safest way to travel. Right. Wait! Who are you? A friend. 'Bye. Something wrong with the elevator? Going down? Officer. Good evening, Officer Mooney. They say confession is good for the soul. I'd listen to this man. Take him away. Come on, let's get out of here. Move your ass! Come on! Okay, let's go. Let's go. Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons. Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here. Okay, hold it. Hold it right there. Okay, freeze, you turkeys. - Don't shoot! - Keep your cool. You got us. Bad vibrations? Sergeant, you don't believe me. I swear it, flying. With a big red cape and bright red boots as well. Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird. - A big blue bird? - You don't believe me! With bright red boots? Take the night off. Go back to Murphy's bar and continue what you started. I'll be off in a few minutes and I'll meet you there. The first bottle's on me. Let me get my hat. Frisky, will you come down from there. Hi. I'll get him. Come on, it's all right. - Here you go, miss. - Gee, thanks, mister. Goodbye, Frisky. So long now. 'Bye. Mommy, Mommy, Frisky was stuck in the tree. Then this man swooped out of the sky and gave him to me. Haven't I told you to stop telling lies. Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One. Could we have the latest weather report? Metropolis currently ceiling 500, overcast 700 broken... ...visibility one half in showers. Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8. Roger. Doesn't look good. What do you think? - What the hell was that? - You've lost power in number one. Lost power? We've lost the whole engine. - Pressure's going. - Shut down number one. Bring up two and three. We haven't got enough pressure to keep going. Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower. Air Force One. We have lost port outboard engine and part of wing. Request emergency landing. What's the position? Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport. Notify them the President's on board. Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles southwest of Metropolis Airport. Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet. What the hell happened? We got our engine back? What the hell's going on out there? Fly, don't look, just fly. We got something. I'm not saying what it is, just trust me. You enjoyed it. I don't know what to say, Father. I'm afraid I just got carried away. - I anticipated this, my son. - You couldn't have. You couldn't have imagined... How good it felt? You are revealed to the world. Very well. So be it. But you still must keep your secret identity. Why? The reasons are two. First: You cannot serve humanity 28 hours a day. As it is, in earth time. Your help will be called for endlessly. Even for those tasks that human beings can solve themselves. It's their habit to abuse their resources in such a way. And secondly? Secondly: Your enemies will discover... ...their only way to hurt you... ...by hurting the people you care for. Thank you, Father. Lastly: Do not punish yourself with your feelings of vanity. Simply learn to control them. It is an affliction common to all, even on Krypton. Our destruction could have been avoided but for the vanity of some... ...who considered us indestructible. Were it not for vanity... ...at this very moment... ...I could embrace you in my arms... ...my son. Reports are coming in of a miraculous saving of Air Force One... ...from almost certain destruction... ...rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter from the Daily Planet, with one hand... ...and a crashed helicopter with the other. That'll be the day. That'll be the day when a guy could fly. I don't know. You would be surprised. ...some sort of fantastic hoax. Your guess is as good as anybody's. True or false? Miracle or fraud? The answer... - Miss Teschmacher! - Man or myth? Turn it off. What's the story on this guy? Do you think it's the genuine article? If he is, he's not from this world. Why? If any human being was gonna perpetrate such a hoax, it would have been me! My robe. Right away, Mr. Luthor. It all fits somehow, this coming here to Metropolis... ...and at this particular time. There's a kind of cruel justice about it. To commit the crime of the century, a man wants to face the challenge of the century. Listen, maybe this guy that flies is just sort of passing through. Passing through? Not on your life, Otis... ...which I would gladly sacrifice by the way... ...for the opportunity of destroying everything that he represents. And, Otis, by the way, next time put my robe on after I'm out of the pool. Now look. The Post, ""It Flies."" The News, ""Look, Ma, No Wires."" The Times, ""Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."" The Planet. We're sitting on top of the story of the century here. I want the name of this flying whatchamacallit... ...to go with the Daily Planet like bacon and eggs... ...franks and beans, death and taxes, politics and corruption. I don't think that he'd... ...lend himself to any cheap promotion schemes. Exactly how would you know that? Just first impression. Who's talking cheap? I'll make him a partner if I have to. - Right? - Right, Chief. I want the real story. I want the inside dope on this guy. Has he got a family? Where does he live? What does the ""S"" stand for? Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name? What's he got hidden under that cape? Batteries? Why did he show up last night? Where does he come from? Does he have a girlfriend? What's his favorite ball team, Kent? Now listen to me, I tell you, boys and girls... ...whichever one of you gets it out of him... ...is going to wind up with the single, most important interview since... ...God talked to Moses! What are you standing around about for? Move! Get on that story. ""8:00,"" he said. Some friend! That's the story of my life, ""Cinderella Bites The Dust! "" Good evening, Miss Lane. Did you have plans this evening? This old thing? No. - I could come back later. - No! Don't move. Sure you can move. Just don't fly away, all right? Sorry to drop in on you like this, but I've been thinking. There must be some questions people'd like to know the answers to. Yes. You really shouldn't smoke. Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right? Well, not yet, thank goodness. Would you like a glass of wine? No, thanks. I never drink when I fly. Nice place. Thank you. Thank you. Shall we get started with the interview? Let's start with your vital statistics. Are you married? No, I'm not. Do you have a girlfriend? No, I don't. But... If I did, you'd be the first to know about it. How old are you? Over 21. I get it. You don't want anyone to know. And how big are you? How tall are you? About 6' 4"". 6' 4"". And how much do you weigh? Around 225. I assume then that... ...the rest of your bodily functions are normal? I beg your pardon? Well, putting it delicately... ...do you... ...eat? Yes, I do, when I'm hungry. You do. Of course, you do. Well, then is it true... ...that you can see through anything? Yes, I can, pretty much. And that you're totally impervious to pain? Well, so far. What color underwear am I wearing? Did I embarrass you? - No. - I did. No, it's just that this planter must be made of lead. Yes, it is. So? I sort of have a problem seeing through lead. That's interesting. Problems with lead. - Do you have a first name? - Like Ralph, or something? - No, I mean like... - Pink. Pink! Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you. You didn't embarrass me. What's your background? Where are you from? It's kind of hard to explain, actually. You see, I'm from... Well, from pretty far away. Another galaxy, as a matter of fact. I come from a planet called Krypton. Krypton. Cripton! With a C-r-i... No, actually it's Krypton, with a K-r-y-p-t-o-n. Do you like pink? I like pink very much. Why are you? Sorry? I mean, why are you here? There must be a reason for you to be here. Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice and the American way. You'll end up fighting every official in this country. You don't really mean that. - I don't believe this. - Lois? I never lie. How fast do you fly, by the way? I don't know. I've never actually bothered to time myself. Say? Why don't we find out? And how do you propose we do that? - Take a ride with me. - You mean I could fly? I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay. - This is utterly fantastic. - Wait a minute. Where are you going? - Are you serious? - Sure. Don't you want to go? You won't need these. - I need a sweater. It must be kind of... - No, you'll be warm enough. Ready? Clark said that you were just a figment of somebody's imagination. Like Peter Pan. Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend? - Clark? No, he's nothing. - Peter Pan? Peter Pan flew with children, Lois. In a fairy tale. Can you read my mind? Do you know what it is that you do to me? I don't know who you are. Just a friend from another star. Here I am, like a kid out of school. Holding hands with a god. I'm a fool. Will you look at me? Quivering. Like a little girl shivering. You can see right through me. Can you read my mind? Can you picture the things I'm thinking of? Wondering why you are... ...all the wonderful things you are. You can fly. You belong in the sky. You and I... ...could belong to each other. If you need a friend... ...I'm the one to fly to. If you need to be loved... ...here I am. Read my mind. We forgot to time ourselves. Maybe next time. You okay? Good night. Good night. What a super man! Superman! Anybody home? - Hi. Can I come in? - Oh, yeah. For goodness' sake, didn't you hear me knocking? We did have a date tonight, remember? You haven't been...? I should certainly hope not. Well, let's push off, shall we? I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out. I mean, I need a purse, and I have to fix my hair... ...put some blush on. There's something I have to tell you. I'm really... I was at first really nervous about tonight. But then I decided, darn it, I was going to show you the time of your life. That's Clark nice. We could go for a hamburger or whatever you want to do. Now then... ...given the exact location of the galaxy that he mentions... ...and the proximity to our own solar system... It's amazing. Amazing! Too good to be true. It's too good to be true. 6' 4"", black hair, blue eyes... ...doesn't drink or smoke and tells the truth. Some people can read War and Peace... ...and think it was an adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a gum wrapper... ...and unlock the secrets of the universe. Lex, what has chewing gum got to do with the secrets of the universe? Right, Miss Teschmacher. ""N."" ""M""? You want ""M,"" Mr. Luthor? Coming right up. So there you go, ""M."" ""M"" as in ""moron,"" Otis? No. It's ""N"" as in ""Neanderthal""... ...""nincompoop,"" ""nitwit,"" and ""L"" as in ""ladder."" Here's a ladder, coming right up. I didn't see... I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor. In the interview he says that the Planet Krypton... ...exploded in 1948. That ridiculous little freak... ...took three years in a rocket to get to earth. - Ergo... - Ergo. Ergo 1948, that's three years on. He's 6' 4"", you know that? Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and me? It's your weight and my I.Q. Think, people, think. Deductive reasoning. That's the name of the game. Fragments from the Planet Krypton... ...exploded and went into outer space. It is reasonable to assume... ...that some of those particles of debris drifted to Earth. Meteorites! Jawohl. Voil! Voil! A meteorite found in Addis Ababa? I know I'll get rapped in the mouth for this, but... ...so what? So what? You mean to us they're just meteorites. Fair enough. But the level of specific radioactivity... ...is so high to anyone from the Planet Krypton... ...this substance is lethal. Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor. Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy... ...but this stuff here... ...will kill him. Doesn't it give you a kind of... ...a shudder of electricity through you to be in the same room with me? Not like the shudder you'll get when you lay that rock on him. He can see you coming for miles with those super peepers of his. O Lord, you gave them eyes, but they cannot see... ...nor can Superman, through lead. He can't see through lead? And Kryptonite will destroy him. Any questions, class? I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa? Looks like a burnoose. It's just a wraparound. Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor? Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over. Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead. Everything looks good, see you at the base. Over and out. Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out. Look at this! Looks pretty bad. Take her pulse. Get an ambulance down here. I don't want to hold this convoy up more than I have to. She's having trouble breathing. What do you think? I suggest a vigorous chest massage. If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth. Yes, sir! I won't have my men do anything I wouldn't be prepared to do myself. Get an ambulance. Gather around. Turn around! Hi. Somebody hurt? I did it, Mr. Luthor. Miss Teschmacher, I did it. - Just like you told me. - All right, Otis. It isn't that I don't trust you, but... I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do? I set the first directional vector... ...to 38. The second one to 67. And the third one to 117. What about the fourth one? What fourth one? Wait a minute. The third one to 117? - Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor. - Otis! The third one was supposed to be 11, and the fourth one, 7. Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor. I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see. Would you like to see a long arm? Otis, would you like to see a very, very, long arm? No, Mr. Luthor. - All right. Get it right. - Yes, Mr. Luthor. I thought you told me this road would be blocked off? - Jablowsky, didn't I tell you... - I didn't ask him, I asked you. All right. Follow me, men. Back that thing off the road. Back it off the road. You'll have to circle back. I don't have time to argue. It's a heck of a day, isn't it? - Route 12? That's back there. - No, sir, it's up there. - Sergeant, we took the wrong road. - I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer. Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way. This man is a diabetic, you see. As you know, the Daily Planet is very interested in that dam... ...but what I don't understand... ...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person you've never met? You don't know his name. At the stupid high price he offered... ...for this worthless piece of desert... ...I hope it's Custer! Perfect, just what I need. Thank you. Reporting live from the launch site, ground zero. Today marks a historic occasion since... ...two XK-101 rockets will be launched simultaneously. One by the Army, and one by the Navy. Hi, everybody. Has anybody seen Lois today? No, but the Chief wants to see you. You're blocking the set, Clark. Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay? Good. Excuse me, Mr. White. You wanted to see me, sir? Have you seen Lois today? She's out West, looking into a land-fraud deal. I sent young Olsen with her on his first assignment. Some unidentified clown is buying thousands of acres... ...of worthless desert at incredible prices. That doesn't seem to make sense. The world doesn't make sense. You ought to know that. Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa. People break into a museum at night, kill two people, and what do they take? A worthless piece of meteorite. How do you figure that? I've never been able to understand violence. I know that about you. That's why I wanted to talk to you. I've been in this news game 40 years man and boy... ...and I got where I am with guts, compassion... ...elbow grease and something you're sadly lacking in, son. Humility? Not humility, you've got bags of humility. Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket. Take charge. Let people know who you are. This is Lex Luthor. Only one thing alive with less than four legs can hear this frequency. That's you. In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet containing propane lithium compound... ...will be released through thousands of air ducts in this city... ...effectively annihilating half the population of Metropolis. I was a reporter before most of my friends were copy boys. I want you to get Lois to introduce you to Superman. Find out who he is. Where did he get that blue suit? Did he have it made? Is it silk? Is it plastic? I know it all seems a bit much... ...but how else was I going to meet you, Superman? I knew you'd never accept an invitation to tea. But a disaster, with people in danger, people who need help... I just knew you couldn't resist that chance to sort of pitch in. You know what I mean? There's a strong streak of good in you, Superman. But then nobody's perfect. Almost nobody. - Oh, Superman! - Gee! Stand back, please. Nothing to get worried about. Don't sit there like a numskull, get out! Look at that overgrown boy scout, Miss Teschmacher. Tell me what you see? Cuteness, dimples. You like cuteness? Dimples. I'll give you dimples. The pressure is still on you. You know they say: If you can't stand the heat... ...get out of the tunnel. It's your last chance, Superman. Why don't you do yourself a flavor and freeze. I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor. He's definitely coming. It's open, come in. My attorney will be in touch with you about the damage to the door. Otis, take the gentleman's cape. I don't think he wants me to. Where's the gas pellet? Somewhere. It's in the back of my mind, actually. It's a little idea I was toying with. Is that how a warped brain like yours gets its kicks? By planning the death of innocent people? By causing the death of innocent people. Fire! Navy Bird, we have a good launch. Navy missile... As you may or may not know, I am, as they say... ...very heavy into real estate. To make money, you have to buy for a little and sell for a lot, right? Right. So, the problem? How to make the land more valuable between the time you buy it... ...and the time you sell it? Now this is California. The richest, most populous state in the Union. I don't need a geography lesson from you. Of course, you've been there. I do forget, you get around, don't you? Where was I? - California. - California, right. The San Andreas Fault, maybe you've heard of it? Yes. It's the joining together of two land masses. The fault line is shifting, which is why you get earthquakes in California. Wonderful! Couldn't have said it better myself. Everything west of this line is the richest, most expensive real estate in the world. San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco. Everything on this side of the line... ...is just hundreds of miles of worthless desert land... ...which just happens to be owned by... Lex Luthor Incorporated. Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible. It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb... ...planted at just the proper point would... Would destroy most of California. Millions of people would be killed and the West Coast as we know it would... Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California. Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast. Costa Del Lex, Luthorville. Marina Del Lex, Otisburg. ""Otisburg""? Miss Teschmacher, she's got her own place. ""Otisburg""? It's a little bitty place. Otisburg? I'll just wipe it off, that's all. You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor. A sick, twisted dreamer. Your plan couldn't possibly work. I'll admit there were a few problems. Adjusting the precise trajectory of the missile. Finding the optimum stress point for the fault line itself... ...which, by the way, is target zero. Right... ...here. That's impossible! What's happening, Lieutenant? Trajectory malfunction, sir. Abort. All counter control units... ...remove vacuum pressure to maximum. Function negative, sir. Can't you knock them down? Absolutely impossible, sir. They have the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems. Get me the Pentagon. What do you think, super baby? Interesting? Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor. Would you go to the viewing room, please? But as for the rest, it's nothing but a sick fantasy. Fantasy? No. It's history. It's happening, Superman. Miss Teschmacher! Yes, Lex? Where's the rocket now? It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon, so is the other one. The other one? There are two of them? Yes, Superman, double jeopardy. Even you, with your great speed, couldn't stop both of them. While I, on the other hand, could stop them with my detonator. All right, Luthor, where is it? Where's the detonator? Diseased maniac! Do you think you could hide it from me by encasing it in lead? I'll mold this box into your prison bars. Don't touch that. I told you. It's Kryptonite. A little souvenir from your hometown. I've spared no expense to make you feel at home. You were great in your day. But it just stands to reason... ...when it came time to cash in your chips... ...this old diseased maniac would be your banker. Mind over muscle. You don't even care where the other missile's headed, do you? Certainly I do. I know exactly where it's headed. Hackensack, New Jersey. I have to leave you now. No hard feelings. We all have our little faults. Mine's in California. Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack. Please, you can't... ...you can't just stand there. You can't just stand and let millions of innocent people die. Maybe. Please, help me to save them. Would you promise to save my mother first? But, Lois, and Jimmy... But my mother comes first. If you promise, I'll believe you because you always tell the truth. I promise, I promise. Why did you kiss me first? I didn't think you'd let me later. Thank you, Miss Teschmacher. Why is it I can't get it on with the good guys? Stand aside now. I wouldn't stay here, either. Army Bird still heading due east. Navy Bird still heading due west. Losing radar contact. Next radar contact after three seconds. Army Bird still headed east, sir. Army Bird gaining altitude. Miss Teschmacher! Radar contact strong. Miss Teschmacher! Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area. Navy Bird heading down, 15 seconds to impact. 15 seconds and counting. A military missile has exploded in the Southern California desert. The force of the explosion has activated the San Andreas fault. California is suffering a major earthquake. What's going on? It's a quake! Look! Okay, kids, it's all right now. Hey, it's Superman! Holy mackerel! We're going off the tracks. All personnel evacuate dam. Watch that cable! Someone try and pull the main. It's impossible. It's red hot! Is that man all right? Yeah. Hang on, Jim. The dam broke. You're safe here, son. That's okay. Miss Lane will be driving by any minute. - Come on! - Make it to the hill. There has been major quake damage to Southern California. The San Andreas fault has miraculously sealed itself. Yet Southern California is suffering an aftershock of a major earthquake. The population is still warned to be aware... Please, come on, turn over. Come on! Help me. Help me, please. It is forbidden for you to interfere... There's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason. It is forbidden. All those things I can do. All those powers... ...but I couldn't even save him. It is forbidden. Hi. Don't bother, it's dead. Sure it's dead. The problem with men of steel is they're never around when you want one. Do you know what happened while you were off flying around? I was almost in an earthquake. A gas station blew up beside my car. Telephone poles falling all over the road. I was almost killed. To top the whole thing off, this stupid car runs out of gas. I'm sorry about that, Lois. But I've been kind of busy for a while. I'm sorry, that's all right. Thanks a lot, Superman. Put me in the middle of nowhere during an earthquake. No food, no water, snakes everywhere. I had no idea if you were coming back. There's something I have to do. I'll see you later. He can't stay still for a second. Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this. Yeah, poor Clark. He's never around when... Clark... Wait a minute. What? Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea. I'll tell you something, Miss Lane. I think he really cares about you. - Clark? Of course, he does. - No, not Clark. Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy. But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky... You're messing up my suit! Otis! Watch the ground, you... Good evening, Warden. These two men should be safe here 'til they can get a fair trial. Who is it, Superman? Lex Luthor. - The greatest criminal mind of our time. - Of our time. - I hereby serve notice... - He's serving notice to you. ...that these walls... Will you shut up, you fat little fool! You, you nitwit! Nincompoop! This country... ...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you. No, sir. Don't thank me, Warden. We're all part of the same team. Good night., (# ""Let's Misbehave"") # We're all alone, no chaperone can get our number # The world's in slumber # Let's misbehave # There's something wild about you, child, that's so contagious # Let's be outrageous # Let's misbehave # When Adam won Eve's hand, he wouldn't stand for teasin' # He didn't care about those apples out of season # They say that spring means just one thing to little lovebirds # We're not above birds # Let's misbehave # Let's misbehave # Let's misbehave # If you'd be just so sweet and only meet your fate, dear # 'Twould be the great event of 1928, dear # Let's misbehave # Let's misbehave! Well... ...a most excellent feast! (all) Hear, hear! Soon we will retire to the royal bedchamber. But first, as I have been victorious this week in battle... (cheering) ...I wish to be amused. Bring me my fool. (fanfare) Your Majesty, it's great to be back at the palace. You know what the palace is - 24 living rooms and a dungeon. But seriously... I love the king. He's one of the strongest men here, isn't he? He's the only one amongst us that can swim the moat lengthwise. Cos... I know you're out there. I can hear you breathing! But seriously, ladies and germs, I wanna say that... ...that plague is really something! Doesn't everything look black?! Cos it's a... a black... a black plague! Save it up and let me hear it at the end... big. And, uh... I love the new exercise His Majesty does to keep in shape. It's called taxing peasants. But seriously... the... the best... thing... I can't stand it any longer! He's not funny! I've cut men in half for making jokes as bad as that! - But, sire... - Get me a fool who's funny! Go on! The feast is over! Not funny! Come on! Out, out, out, out! I do a couple of impressions that you might like. L-I'm one of the few guys that can do the King of France. Not his voice, his walk. If you've ever noticed, he'll have that funny motion when he walks. He's... Don't everybody... burst into spontaneous applause on this! - Look where thou goest, fool! - I beg your puberty. Thou hast dropped the royal rubies and emeralds! I fain wouldst pick it up and pin it and fain well on thy fain. - Aye, pin! - Yes, extend thy fain, madam. - And I... On the knocker it hangs. Perfect. - Knock! Didst I feel right? Or didst I feel that thy two hands did upon my royal body cop a feel? Oh, madam, not I. I surely would never lay my hands on the royal tomatoes. Tomatoes?! Hearken to me. If my husband the king and my son the doctor... ...walketh near upon these paved paths and heareth what thou sayest... ...thy life would not be worth a plug nickel! But so beautiful do they lay - one on either side... That's the way they were made, fool! Away with thee! (groans) Oh... I... I fell on my bells! TB... ...or not TB? That is the congestion. Consumption be done about it? Of cough. Of cough. (guard) Ohhh, Jesus! My jokes grow stale. I would my life take for a bare bodkin. If only I could see the queen's bare bodkin. Or anybody's bare bodkin, for that matter. Or a bodkin with a little clothes on it even. I'm so melancholy. Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead! Their tailor shop is closed. (echoing) Felix! Who calls my name? Felix! No one knows I'm here. Not even my service. I am the ghost of thy father. Oh... my father. You who died in childbirth. I cannot rest... ... unless thee makes it with the queen. But she is a queen and I am a baseborn fool. I can't screw above my station. You must know, my son... ... that thy uncle... ... my father... ... poured hemlock in my ear. Why? Don't ask me why. He does that with everybody. Whenever he sees an ear... ... he likes to pour hemlock in it. (gasps) Oh, Father! See the sorcerer, my son. (fading) The sorcerer! The sorcerer... He's gone! Do I dare sleep with the queen? And will she sleep with me? Although she sleeps with the king, and he wears leotards! The sorcerer... Ah! An aphrodisiac! Do you want a soft one? A strong one? Or one that will... ...mmm? - What can I get without a prescription? - Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! This, placed softly... ...in the queen's drink... ...will make her blood boil! Her passion... unbridled. Lustful. - In other words... - The hots for me. (chuckles) Exactly. But be cautious. For if His Majesty should get wind of thy intent... ...he will cut off your legs... ...your arms... ...and your head. Right... Five out of six is not bad. Now go. Yes, sir. I think your eggs are done. - Halt! Who goes there? - It's just the fool. What business have you in the royal chamber? I was just bringing Her Majesty her orange juice. But why you? Where is her usual servant? He... He lies ill on the... kitchen floor with the pox. A terrible pox all over his socks. - Get thee hence, fool. - Yes, I'm getting hence. Immediately. I... D'you like the way I fooled these guys? Fool, what dost thou in my chamber? Madam, I fell by for perchance you might like a drink - a nice, soothing potion. Aye, well, I do confess a thirst. Bringst to me. Yes. Wouldst grab some of this potion before the fizz goes out. - Isn't it wonderful? Mm! - It bubbleth greatly. Wolf some down, my lady. Cheerst! And Roebuck. It go down bubblest, but it's fine. Takest away. Well, I have to go back now to the dungeon. There's a... To get a deposit on the goblet. Wait! Fool, come here. I have o'er me this extraordinary warmth that is flowing through my veins... ...that makes me wisht - nay, longst - thou should run amok over my entire body. Make love to me now. Ravage me and take me now. Take me. - It will be my pleasure. - Take me to the bed. Make love to me. - Yes. To the... To the bed. - Lead me there, fool. - Yes, I am. - How this passion groweth within me. - Right. Come quickly. - I cannot walk fast, fool. - (queen) The passion is so great. - Right. To the bed. Aye. Haste to the bed. Right, over here. Here. The potion will be under the pillow. If you lose your hots, we can refurbish them. - Aye. Comest o'er! - Oh, yes. - Run thy hands upon my body. - I shall. I shall reline your brakes. Aye. Mmm! Oh, God! Nay, I needst the feel of naked flesh against flesh. I'm all out of naked flesh. But will the velvet do? - Kiss me quick. - Yes. Where is your quick? - Shh. Canst undress me now? - I'm kissing my own arm! Yes. Up quickly and I will remove the royal dress. (panting) Oh, God... Mmm! Oh, God! Takest off. Pullst not upon me so! On thy feet, fool. This is not mockery. This is not games. Ah! Oh, God... At la! What... What's this?! Heavy underwear. 'Tis the chastity belt that the jealous king hath fastened on me... ...that no man but him shallst havest the goodst of the body. That's a bad break for all of us here at the palace. Yes... Yes... Wait! Wait here. L-I... I will go. Here, now, with most grievous dispatch, I will open the latch... ...and get to her snatch. - Quickly. - Aye. All right, hold that. This key is too big for that lock. (key drops to floor) - Um... - Agh! J-J-Just move back. (clang) Sorry about that. I must think quickly. Before you know it, the Renaissance will be here and we'll all be painting. Her Majesty wishes to borrow this. She has some food stuck between her teeth and I need to pull it out. - Forgive me... - Argh! Whoops! Ah! Ugh! No! Agh! This is what they call beaver shooting. I wouldst pick this lock. - There. - Agh! We did it. It's done. - Yes. - And now I am yours. At last, the portals of ecstasy. You have got portals of ecstasy? Be prepared! His Majesty has this day been awakened by a loud banging! Be prepared! His Majesty has this day been awakened by a loud banging! - He will cleave thee in twain! - Yes. Cleave me in twain. Twain over here and twain on the other side of the room! Onst chopping block. Yes. I do not look good in twain. - My suits are made for a whole person. - I shall not have this passion fulfilled! Well, quickly, lock up the... the thing that you have there. Lock the royal box! Quickly! Quickly! Before... - Help me. Help me. - I'mst helping, but... Aye, 'tis done. 'Tis locked solid. More solid than any... M-My hand! 'Tis caught in the chastity belt. I always get my hand in the cookie jar, so to speak. The king approaches. What canst we do? - The king?! - Aye! Quickly! Into the dress immediately. My queen! Where is my queen? Very casual. As though nothing had happened. Queen! Oh, my queen. A most dreadful pounding did awaken me. Making my mood most foul! Oh... My lord didst startle me! Aye, my lord. Be a good king, wouldst thou, and go and get me a drink of water? The fool hath made the most jestfully quipping in thine absence. Aye, my lord! Tickling the royal funny bone, so to speak. Because, you see, 'tis most Ionely when thou nappest. Aye, my lord. For me, too. I still don't... ...think he's funny. I got some new ones for you, my lord. What's black and white, black and white, black and white and black and white? A nun falling down the stairs. (nervous giggle) Come give me a kiss. - Of course. Stick out your tongue. - Not you! Now begone! - That damn fool! - No! I... I will accompany thee to the door. At last. At last, we are alone. - Aye, my lord. - Come to me. - My lord, I wouldst... - Mmm! Mmm! - Nay! Kiss me not! - To the bed! I will soon find that key. Where is't? Ah! Here it is! Ha-ha-ha! Tickles! Oh! Aye, my lord. Remember you said that if I was ever in town I should look up your wife? I don't know what everybody's getting so upset for. I never humped her, you know. Just... Just clean up my neck a little and leave the top full. Your case. So... - Give me a good ""ah"". - Ah. Ah. ...down this side of my arm, mostly at night. I don't notice it as much in the daytime, but at night it bothers me. I don't want to hurt you, but how far up can you raise it? Mr Milos, would you come with me, please? Come in, Mr Milos. Come in. Sit down right over here. I just want to get some history on you first. So... - Your name is? - Stavros Milos. - And your address? - Armenia. - Armenia? - I am from Armenia. - I am visiting my brother. - I see. Um... occupation? Shepherd. - A shepherd? - My whole family. Except for my brother over here, who is a rug salesman. Mm-hm. - Have you had any major illnesses? - No. None. Good. So... Now... what seems to be the trouble? - I'm in love with a sheep. - I beg your pardon? I am in love with a sheep. Oh... I see. You see, doctor, up there in the mountains where I tend my flocks... ...it's so beautiful under the starry skies. And I am alone. And sometimes it gets so Ionely. And the hours pass. And soon I desire a woman. But, doctor, there are no women. I am not married and... Well... one night last summer... ...I could stand it no longer. My body needed to be satisfied. And then... I saw her. Her? - Daisy. - Sheep? I took Daisy off to a little cove... ...and there, under the Armenian sky, had sexual intercourse. With the sheep? Naturally. Ohhh... God! It was the greatest lay I ever had. Mr Milos... Forgive me if I... seemed at all shocked. I'm sorry. Doctor, Mrs Gallbladder's on the phone about her rupture. Later. Later... Uh... Mr Milos... Of course, I'm happy for the two of you. But, um... ...I do have other patients. And unless there's some... ...specific way... ...that I could help you... Doctor. Doctor, please. One minute. See, the point is... ...she no longer loves me. That's why I'm here. Because she's fallen out of love with me. How can you tell that? Oh... little things. She's cold. Indifferent. - Mm-hm? - Speak to her. She'll listen to you. Mr Milos... You are... ...crazy. I brought her all the way from Armenia. My brother says you are a great doctor. You saved his life once. You need a psychiatrist. I am a medical doctor. Speak to her. Please? - I can't talk to a sheep! Are you nuts? - She's outside in my brother's truck. Would you get out of my office, please! I'm an MD. I'm not a veterinarian! - I bring her in. - Don't bring any sheep in this office! - My mother just got finished paying for it! - I know no great men of wisdom. My brother says you are a great man. I'm not! I'm just an ordinary GP. - That's all I am! - I'll get her. No! Mr Milos! You don't understand. It's not normal... ...to experience mature love for anything with four legs! Wait till you meet her. I don't believe this. - Doctor, the prescription you gave me... - I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. Would you sit down?! Would you sit down, Mrs... - I'll talk to you... - (bleating) Doctor Ross, this is Daisy. Oh... Good. Um... Why don't you take her right into my office? You'll have to excuse me. His sheep has... ...a... a strep throat. Mr Milos, I'm gonna have to call the police. Can we talk for a minute? Mr Milos, don't put that sheep on my desk! Please! You shouldn't do that. You shouldn't do that. - Isn't Daisy beautiful? - Yes, she is beautiful. Mr Milos... You're a very nice man. I don't want to see you get into any trouble. What I don't think you understand is that... ...you have... ...a, uh... psychiatric problem. You really need to see, uh... ...someone in the... in the, um... psychiatry field. I'm a medical doctor. Um... (bleats) I know you didn't, uh... mean any harm... bringing this sheep in here, but... (bleats) ...I have patients, you know. Kidney problems and... ...heart problems and... Seeing a sheep just like that, it's... Hello, Daisy. - (bleats) - She's so... ...wonderful. I'm, uh... I'm Dr Ross. Doug Ross. She's... Um... Mr Milos... I, uh... I'd like to see the two of you again, but... ...right now, you know, my office is jammed full. Oh, I knew you could help! Thank you, doctor. As a matter of fact, uh... ...if I could see Daisy alone... ...maybe, you know, I... Anything. Anything! Darling, what's the matter? Nothing. I'm just a little tired, that's all. Why don't you turn in early, then? Hm? What are you doing? Oh, just nothing. No, you were fondling your lamb's-wool sweater. I was not fondling my lamb's-wool sweater! What would I do something like that for? Well, God knows! Doctor. Mr Milos brought in his sheep. She's here? All right, show her in. (gargles) Thank you. You can... you can go. Hi... ...darling. I know this must all seem very strange to you. You from the hills of Armenia and me from Jackson Heights. And yet... ...I think it could work. If we gave it a chance. A room, please. Oh. Thank you very much. Wait a second. There you are. Oh, uh... do you want the ""Do not disturb"" sign on the door? Oh... th-that's all right. I... Uh... all right. Yes. Thank you very much. Uh... Room service, this is Dr Ross in room 525. I would like to have some chilled white Burgundy... ...a little caviar... and some grass. Oh, just... plain, green grass. That's 525. Thank you. Daisy. Little Daisy. - Let's be gentle. - (bleats) I'm, uh... I can't... I'm exhausted. Just... (sniffs) Boy! That was really something. I never thought it could be like this. Never in my wildest imagination. (bleats) You're really something special. I love our L-shaped room. I'll never forget these afternoons we've had. I don't think I've ever known such peace and happiness in my life. I hope you feel the same way. (bleats) Sorry. I'm sorry, honey. I was out when you phoned. - Mm. - Emergency house call. - Mm! You smell good. - (sniffs) - Darling? - Hm? Is it my imagination, or do you always smell from lamb chops? Lamb chops? What kind of silly thing is that to say about lamb chops? How could I possibly smell of lamb chops? That's not logical. What... kind of cheap suit is this? That's it with these suits! (door bursts open) Ann! Wait a minute, I can explain! We're just friends. - How could you?! - This is Mrs Bencourse. One of my patients. She thinks she's a sheep! That's all! There's nothing to it! (man)... defendant did commit an adulterous act with a sheep. It's most distasteful in view of the fact that the sheep was under 18 years old. So what? So Ann's left me. So she's taken all my money, all my savings. My licence has been revoked. But I don't care. If you're willing... ...we'll get by somehow. I'll get a job. I don't know... We've been here for an hour. That's what I ordered. Waiter, I ordered two sauerkraut! I didn't order cake! - Waiter! - Don't call me waiter! I'm a doctor! You understand that? I'm not a waiter! I am a doctor! Don't call me waiter! I'm a doctor! Ah. Say ""ah"". Come here! Spread your legs apart! Couldn't you at least not have eaten this morning?! Isn't that... What kind of a mess is that in there?! Daisy? Daisy? Honey? ""I have finally saved up enough money... ... to come back to America and take my Daisy home. "" ""You did a terrible thing to me, but now I've taken Daisy to the mountains again... ... where you will never find her. "" ""Stavros Milos."" (sobs) I have waited so long for this moment. Fabrizio, my darling, go easy on my hymen. Gina, your body to me is a cathedral. Now take off your pants. Didn't you like it? Yes. It didn't look like you were having fun to me. Yes. You were wonderful. But you just lay there - passive - like a lox. It was my first time - did you like it? Me? Are you kidding? More fun than laughing. Maybe next time I'll be more relaxed. S. (camera shutter clicking) Brava! Bravissima! Marcello, do you know anything about frigidity? It's all in the foreplay. A woman needs to be played with before you lay her. How long? Fifteen minutes, half hour - depends on the woman. What about your wife? Thirty seconds. Lucky! Don't tell me Gina's a problem. Er... no... it's not that. Do you fondle her before putting it in? Put what in? Oh! I don't like to talk about Gina like she's a whore. How long have you been married now? Six weeks. Play with her. Fondle her. It's always the man's fault. Any woman can be made to feel ecstasy. Last week, in the middle of... of... She was watching television. You must be doing something wrong. Some women take longer. Find her erogenous zones. Her father gave me a map of them, and still... Okay, turn over. Huh? Over. I want to do a quick check on some parts I missed. - Ah... - S. S... Foreplay... Mmm! Foreplay... Eccitare... Eccitare... Eccitare... (snores) Fabrizio, there is nothing the church can do for you. If I could, I would be glad to try and make your wife come... ...but that is impossible. At least you get pleasure from her. Maybe someday she will get it from you. And here will be my new offices. A hundred people will work under me. Yes... Yes, but tell me about your sex life... your wife. She moans and screams and claws my back. She comes six, seven times. She's like a wolf in heat. Mine lays there and stares at the ceiling. Like a dead one. Are you... small? Small? Like a French bread. Small... Okay, okay... then I don't know. You're depressed still. No. I'm okay. (Gina sighs) You're still thinking about it. Because I love you... because you're so beautiful... ...and I want you to love me loving you. Please... (Gina moans) What are you doing? Take me. Do it to me. Here?! Yes... yes... - There's people all around. - I don't care. We could get caught! I know... I know... Do it... Do it. Oh, my God! Now she wants it! Life plays strange tricks on me. She comes - like an express train. The next night in bed she lays there... It's the danger, my friend. The fear of being caught. The sinful, mischievous, naughty, tempting of fate... That's what she needs. Mark my words. No question. She is weird-city. Did anyone see Fabrizio? Listen carefully to what I say. You'll get caught. It's dangerous. Don't do it! We were nearly caught last week. At the church. In the confessional. I still have a charlie-horse. (exasperated sigh) Stop it before it's too late. (screams) (woman screams) Ma che sta facendo? Ma questa  una cosa da pazzi! Are you angry with me? I love you. At least we know you're not frigid. As long as we do it in public. You'll get used to it. I'll try. I knew we'd work things out. (banging) (man) Do we have to get there that early? Where is it written that we do? Oh, Sam! It's Julie's fianc's parents. You wanna be late? - Listen, Tess. - Mm? - I haven't been feeling well lately. - Oh, come on. It's just psychosomatic. A tension headache by you is psychosomatic. All of a sudden you've become a psychiatrist? Stop complaining. It's Alvin's parents, so it's an obligation. - An obligation. - I don't like them any more than you do. Or should I say it's them that look down their noses at us? I heard that! I think you're both a little paranoid. Alvin's parents are lovely people. They like both of you very much. That's what I call a lawn. Nice, clipped. Not like my house - overgrown. - Did you hear George and I... - Who's your gardener? - Me! Me! - You're the gardener? - Of course. - Sam, did you see the roses? - I thought that... - Oh, please pick... (romantic piano music) - Can you give me the recipe? - You didn't make this yourself? - Excuse me. - (Tess) Where are you going, Sam? - To the bathroom. - (George) Upstairs, first door to the left. (woman) Well... Yes. We prefer Bermuda to Puerto Rico, let's say. It's much nicer. Mm! Of course, I like... I enjoy wearing a formal gown once in a while... ...but when I'm on vacation... ...I like to relax and wear slacks... ...or little skirts and blouses. And sweet little hats. We, um... Your husband and I had quite a talk. He's a very, um... gentle man. Very interesting. I'd love to. I've never seen wood carvings. Well, I mean African heads, and we picked them up in, uh... - (George) Bimini. - Bimini. We got them for a steal. You won't believe the price we paid for them. You want wood carvings? I'll show you wood carvings. Tell her. You simply must see these. They're absolutely... (George coughs) - George! - Yes, dear? They're on the top shelf in the closet. The closet or the bureau? Top shelf in the closet. Top shelf? Right. (humming) You know, Bimini is a free port and we got a marvellous buy on them. - From Bimini. The Bahamas? - Oh? - Beautiful, hm? - Uh... yes. - Look at that detail. - They're... I'd like your husband to see these. Thief! Purse-snatcher! Thief! Help! Help! Get him! (high-pitched voice) Let it go! Don't call the police! Oh, my God! The police! You know, I'm wondering, uh... what could be taking Sam so long? - Would you excuse me for a second? - Certainly. - Are you all right, lady? - It's just another crime in the street thing. It's... an everyday happening. It just happened to me. It's... - You're really lucky. - Lucky?! Well, I don't know... - Oh! I coulda been dead! - Right. You're absolutely right. - Did you have any valuables in it? - No, I don't think so. - You're probably wondering why... - Yes. I got a cold. It's dripping. I don't feel good altogether, you know... - Oh, these young people today! - What can you do? What can you do? It's the society we're living in. What I... But don't make a fuss. (knocks) Sam, what did you do? Fall in? Are you sure you're all right? Officer, there was a bag stolen. He got away. All right! Who's the lady whose purse was snatched? It's perfectly OK, officer. I forgive the little rascal. I'm sorry, but I'll have to fill out a report. I don't wanna press charges. Really, you silly... (siren) - What's all the excitement about? - There's a crowd. And police! - Police? - (Julie) Exciting! - You got me, too. I follow fire engines. - (Julie) Let's look. Do you need some money? (woman) I don't need any money. It was her purse that was stolen! Somebody oughta give her some. - Name? - Uh... name? I... Jasmine. Jasmine Glit. - Oh, that's a very unusual name. - Oh, you're sweet! - What seems to be the trouble, officer? - It's just a purse-snatching. Purse... Oh! L-I'm sorry, lady. I'm very sorry for you. - If I lose my baby, I... - Baby? - Yes. - Come in and lie down. - I'm three months pregnant. - I'm sorry. My gynaecologist told me to avoid excitement. - Please come inside and let me... - Nah... (woman screams) My God! She's my husband! Sam... Sam Le... Yes! Sam Letterman! I'm a man! I'm a man. Here. See? Pull! Pull! Look. Sylvia! Zip me down. (Sam) Look at this. Look at this. Look. Huh? Huh?! Look at this. - (outraged screams) - Help me get this stuff off. Here! Take a look at that! (Tess) Sam, you should have told me, that's all. I would have understood. It's not the kind of thing that's easy to talk about. Sam... we've been married for years. I love you. You love me. You could have come to me and said... ...""Tess... I have a diseased mind."" ""I'm a sick individual."" ""I need help."" ""I need treatment. I'm perverted."" ""I'm unfit to function with normal, decent people."" I would have understood. Thank you. Tess? - I'm going to see Dr Fillmore next week. - I'm glad. You're wonderful. The look on their faces when the police removed your hat! Ha-ha! Brought to you by Lancer, the hair conditioner for men. Are you still using that same old stuff on your hair? Yeah. Why? Try this. - Lancer. Really? - Go ahead. Hey, this is great. No grease or oil! Right. Grooms and conditions at the same time. Smells great, too. Lancer. The conditioner that grooms and conditions. Good! Lancer - for that better-groomed look. A product of K Pharmaceuticals. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome once again to What's My Perversion? Panel members, you look splendid. Pamela and Toni, so beautiful. And Regis and Robert Q, so handsome. And, panel members, we have... ...some very interesting guests this evening. Let's get right to them. So... First guest, will you sign in, please? (Jack) Bernard... ...Jaffe. - (applause) Mr Jaffe, would you sit down, sir? A pleasure to have you with us, here on What's My Perversion? - You know the rules of our game. - Yes, I do. You get $5 every time the panel comes up with a ""no"" answer. To start our game going... ...would you whisper in my ear what your perversion is? While you do that, we will let the studio and the home audience know... ...exactly what your perversion is. Good. All right, panel members. The studio and the home audience know what his perversion is. - We'll start with Robert Q Lewis. - Thank you, Jack. Mr Jaffe, is this one of those nice perversions... ...that any guy might indulge in? (Jaffe) Anybody can do it. I'm sure you could. It's just a matter of wanting to. I see. Thank you. Is this one of the perversions... ...that might best be... performed in the home... ...or could you just do it anywhere? - (Jack) Not necessarily. I think that will get a ""no"" answer. And $5 to you, Mr Jaffe. And we turn the questioning over to Pamela Mason. Pamela? Is it something that is, uh... done with the hands? - Do you want to help me on that? - Yes. I would think that would not necessarily have to play a part in the procedure. And we give you a ""no"" answer on that. That's $10 for you, Mr Jaffe. And Regis Philbin is up next. When you're doing your perversion... ...do you have any need for... for props? Props? You know, uh... whips or leather boots? - Oh, no! - No, no. That's definitely not necessary. - $15, Regis Philbin. And now Toni Holt. - Mr Jaffe... ...would a telescope or a pair of binoculars be helpful to you at any time? It would have to be... pointed in the right direction. - (audience laughter) - I would have to interject to say that... ...it would not be helpful to you, but to somebody else. In that respect, I think we must give you a ""no"" answer, Toni. Robert Q Lewis. Are you... I'll take a wild guess. Are you... a rapist? - Hardly. - No. No, not at all. $25. And... Pamela Mason. - I'll pass to Regis. - Is it self-contained? (Jaffe) Yes. I carry it with me at all times. - (audience laughter) - I'm gonna take a guess. I think I have it. Do you molest children? (Jack) No, you're all on the wrong track. Would you tell them what your perversion is? You already have your $50. Yes. L-I like to... to expose myself on subways. On subways. (applause) And now the winner of this week's contest. Each week, we give you at home an opportunity to play our game. We ask you to write and tell us exactly what your perversion is. We select the most interesting letter... ...and we give that contestant a chance to act out his fantasy on the programme. I present this week's winner. Ladies and gentlemen and members of the panel... ...here from Muncie, Indiana is our winner - Rabbi Chaim Baumel. (applause) Well, congratulations to you, Chaim Baumel. Uh, excuse me. It's not Chaim. It's not Caim. - It's pronounced Chiam. - Chiam. Chiam. Very good. I understand, in addition to being... ...a very distinguished clergyman, you have a very fascinating fetish. - Yes... You mean a hang-up. - Yes. Yes. Silk stockings. - Silk stockings? - I love silk stockings. To touch 'em... To hug them... To... To... Now, you wrote in your letter that what you'd like is to be... ...tied up. For this we need the help of one of the members of the panel. Uh... Someone to tie him up. Regis Philbin, would you? Excuse me. - Must be a girl. - A girl. Well, we certainly have two lovely girls. Pamela... ...will you do the honours and tie him up? - Love to! (Jack) Rabbi. Now, Pamela is going to tie Rabbi Baumel... ...according to the wishes as expressed in his letter. I haven't had a lot of experience, Rabbi, but... I think I can manage. If you have any special instructions, please let me know. Is there any special area that you'd like to have tied? Not too tight! (chuckles) - There. - Good! (Jack) And now a model from the Lucy Jones Modelling Agency... ...is going to pretend that she is Rabbi Baumel's governess... ...and she is going to spank the rabbi. You've been a naughty rabbi! - (Jack) While at the same time... - I have to be in the synagogue tomorrow. ...Mrs Baumel, the rabbi's wife, who we've flown in from Indiana... ...will sit at the rabbi's feet... ...and eat pork. Take that! Naughty rabbi! Now, don't you do that again! (model) You're bad! Naughty, naughty... (giggles) (Jack) Well, there it is, America. Another lucky winner gets to act out his fantasy. This is Jack Barry, saying goodbye and good luck from me and the panel. We'll see you next week on... What's My Perversion? (applause and cheering) - Uh... Let me have 50 worth of regular. - You bet. Excuse me. My car broke down about two miles down the road. - Could you send somebody to get it? - Sure, ma'am. Thank you. Uh, how far is Dr Bernardo's house? - Uh... about seven miles. - Oh, dammit! - Miss? - Yes? - You're going to Dr Bernardo's house? - Uh-huh. - Would you like a lift? I'm going there. - Oh... Gee, that'd be swell. - Yeah? Oh, well, come on. - OK. Are you a friend of Dr Bernardo's? Not exactly. I'm gonna be working with him, helping with his experiments. Are you studying sexual phenomena, too? Yes. I, uh... was a biology major in school. I'm really looking forward to working with the doctor. He's a great hero of mine. He was the first man to ever measure the sound waves produced by an erection. - Yes, I know. - Do you? Yes, I'm a reporter for The Globe. I'm going to interview Dr Bernardo for a story in our Sunday supplement. - A reporter, huh? - Mm-hm. You know, you're kinda cute. Why don't you just watch the road, huh? What's your name? Helen Lacey. What's yours? Victor. Victor Shackelpopolous. (mumbling) Is... Is Dr Bernardo here? I think he wants us to come in. The doctor is expecting us, so, uh... Look at this place! It's really great. Is your decorator still living? It's chilly! Uh... So... So, what d'you think? Is... Is Dr Bernardo here or... what? I am Dr Bernardo. You must be Victor. And Miss Lacey. Igor! I thought I told you to keep to your room. (mumbling) Forgive him. He usually keeps to his room. I know there's a big problem with domestics nowadays. Come. Shall we have dinner? (whispers) Yeah. I understand you're famous for your potato pancakes. Dr Bernardo, you don't know how excited I am to be here. I've waited so long to meet you! I'm really looking forward to helping you with your experiments. Have you read my latest book... ... Advanced Sexual Positions: How To Achieve Them Without Laughing? It's getting to be a classic. I'm familiar with it. It's wonderful how you men of science... ...have finally gotten around to sex. The girls at The Globe are so pleased with your work on respiration during orgasm. A mere trifle compared to my real work. Doctor, I read a statement you made. You felt the average length of a man's penis should be 19 inches. Doesn't that seem a little long? Long?! My friend, I'm making discoveries you wouldn't dream of! Yes, I know. But... But 19 inches... I mean, that's... (doctor) Does that sound mad?! That's what they called me at Masters' and Johnson's clinic. Mad! Because I had visions of explorations... ...in sexual areas undreamed of by lesser human beings! It was I who first discovered how to make a man impotent by hiding his hat! I was the first one to explain the connection... ...between excessive masturbation and entering politics. It was I who first said... ...that clitoral orgasm should not be only for women. They laughed at me, ridiculed me, said I was mad! Ha-ha! But I showed them! Ha-ha! They threw me out of Masters' and Johnson's. No severance pay. And I had it coming! But I showed them! (manic laugh) Are we having dessert? Oh, come. I want to show you my laboratory. Igor! (mumbling) Clean up this table, and hurry! (mumbling) You must forgive Igor. He was part of an experiment of mine that backfired. Using an electrical generator, I gave him a four-hour orgasm. He had fun, but he turned out like this. Well... Posture. Posture! Here it is. Here's where I'm discovering new facts about sex. Facts that will make me a great man one day. (electricity buzzing) (machines humming) Dr Bernardo, what is all this? Come this way and you'll see. Here I'm studying premature ejaculation in a hippopotamus. How often does that problem come up with a hippo? Here I'm forcing a man to have intercourse with a large rye bread. They're getting on famously! Here... I'm going to take the brain of a lesbian... ...and put it into the body of a man who works for the telephone company. But why? What good will this do anybody? It'll show those fools who called me mad! Come! - But, doctor, this is immoral! - Nonsense. The human mind is capable of many strange things. Look. Each day for the past year I feed her nothing but silicone. She used to be flat-chested. Give me another year and watch out! You're insane! That's what they said at Masters and Johnson. And all because I built a 400ft diaphragm! Birth control for an entire nation at once! You! You will be the subject of my newest experiment. - Me?! - Yes. Look here. - (moaning) - In here I have 20 Scouts. I want to measure your respiration when they gangbang you. - No! - (moaning) Get away from her. - Why don't you let her relax and enjoy it? - You shoot her... ...and I'll sue you for malpractice! Igor! Victor! Victor, do something! Helen, keep your legs crossed. Victor! (machine buzzes) Igor! Now we owe them a dinner! (engine doesn't start) What's wrong, Victor? I think the battery's dead and we're out of gas, oil and water. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm all right. - (explosion) - Agh! - What was that? - That sounded like Igor. Victor! Look! Oh, my God! A gigantic tit! (bubbling) Oh, Victor, what are we gonna do? I don't know about you, but I'm going home to get my catcher's mitt. (Victor) It looks angry. The nipple's erect. - Oh, Victor! Come on, let's go. - No! They were all boys in my family. Oh... (typewriter) Sheriff, I wanna report an escaped tit! - A what?! - It's already killed two people! Dr Bernardo and his assistant. - A tremendous tit. - Have you been drinking? Listen, we don't have time to argue here. The countryside's being ravaged by a colossal boob! (woman giggles) Mmm! - You've got the most beautiful breasts. - (interference on car radio) Oh, shit! There's something wrong with the radio. There's something wrong with the radio. See? (bubbling) (man) Oh, my God! Jesus Christ! God! - What is it?! - Relax! Just relax! Be on the lookout for a large, female breast. It's about a 4,000 with an X cup. About a 4,000 with an X cup. Let's go. (bubbling) We're too late. He's dead. The cream slowed him up and the milk killed him. We're up against a very clever tit. It shoots half and half. Victor, what are we gonna do to stop this fiendish tit? I got an idea, but I'd have to get my hands on some camouflage. I can get you camouflage. Victor, don't do anything dangerous. Don't worry. I know how to handle tits. (bubbling) Victor! I'm so proud of you. You did it! Oh, I was so worried. Were you scared? - Do I look like a guy who gets scared? - I thought you'd be nursed to death. Everything's all secure now. You don't have to worry. One thing bothers me, though. That's a single. You're sure that was a single? - That was a single. - They usually travel in pairs. - No, you don't have to worry. - I've never seen one by itself. Two, yes. But not just one. So we're gonna take a nipple print, just so we'll have ID on this one. I think we'll put it on probation for maybe... 90 days... ...and then take it down to the orphanage. There's a lot of hungry babies down there. You both take care of yourselves now. (Helen) You were so magnificent out there. I knew then that I wanted you. I don't wanna say anything about this, Helen. L-I kinda had a personal stake in this case, you know. I've never told anyone this... ...but when I was a little child, I was breast-fed from falsies. I've learned one thing from this whole situation, and that is: ...when it comes to sex, there are certain things that should be left unknown. And with my luck, they probably will be. (phone rings) Brain room. Come in, motor function 12. Check. His leg itches. - Scratch the, uh... left leg. - The leg has been scratched. There's a joke coming in on 4-1. - Prepare response for incoming joke. - Joke response 18.2. - Smile, please. - He's smiling! Brain to stomach. Stomach to brain. Over. - Food coming down. - What kind? - Fettucine. - Jesus Christ! - Italian food coming down! - (man) Again?! Italian food?! Stomach proceeding with breakdown. This is Mission Control. Mission Control. Please stand by for systems check. Well... what do you think? No, thanks. - Think we'll have intercourse? - I'm very optimistic. The date is beautiful. Have you seen her? No. I haven't had a chance. It's been so damned hectic up here. She's lovely. You should take a look. - Brain to eyes. Brain to eyes. Come in. - Eyes to brain. Over. Focus on the dinner date. I want to check her out. - Do you want the whole body? - Yes, please. Take a look. Hey! - (man #2) lt'd be a shame to lose her. - (man #1) And how! Wow! Any indication yet? Brain to ears. Brain to ears. Can you throw some voice up here? Yes. For me, Norman Mailer has exactly that... same sort of relevance. That... affirmative, negative duality... ... that only Proust or... Flaubert could achieve. I don't know if we're gonna make it. Doesn't look too good. I'm a graduate of New York University. We're gonna make it. (man #2) I'm worried. About a possible failure, huh? Yes. Anyone can have a fiasco now and then... ...but a few in a row can lead to a serious loss of confidence. You can see what it's doing to morale around here already. Don't worry. We're gonna bring this off. My place or your place? To me, it doesn't matter where we do it. Hey! Why do you look so scared? Goddammit! Who flashed the scared expression?! C'mon! Anybody press ""frightened""? No one! Must be a short circuit somewhere. That's all we need now! (bleeping) Mission Control! Prepare for launching! Prepare for launching! It looks like they're gonna do it! Attention, sperm! Attention, sperm! Stand by. - Well... here we go again. - D'you think we'll get out this time? I hope it's not another false alarm. Been having trouble in Engineering. Yeah, but I heard it was all mental. Hey, you're... you're on my tail. Sorry. Heart factors are all balanced. We could use more adrenaline. This is the adrenal gland. We're pumping away here. Oh, my God, Sydney! Can't you wait? You wanna do it right here in the parking lot? Signal the voice to answer yes! All systems on the alert! We're gonna try to ball her in the car. Ears! Quickly! Ears! I've made it in cars before, but always in hardtops. - Prepare for launching. - Sexual organs, proceed with erection. - (man #1) It's stuck! - (man #2) Let's go, boys! Come on, get it up, fellas! Pull! All together... Roll out the tongue. Here comes the kiss! Hang on! (rumbling) Activate pleasure centre! (ecstatic moaning) Can we have an erection? What the hell's going on?! I know you can do it, boys! Pull! Come on, fellas! What's the matter? Don't just stand there! What's the matter, Sydney? - Maintain hands on breasts. - We're having trouble with respiration. We're way over the limit down here. If you're not getting an erection, something's wrong. Proceed with erection. All systems go. Let's go, boys! All together! We gotta get it up! What the hell's going on down here? We need an erection. We need more help from the brain room. Maybe there's some trouble in the stomach. Fettucine is moving along nicely. A couple of injuries from the veal scallopini, though. I'm not laughing, Sydney, honestly! Now kiss me. We have an erection of 45 degrees. - Shall we attempt penetration? - Prepare for penetration. - Well, this looks like it. - Do you know what it's like out there? It's like they told us in training school. It's an ovum. I'm scared. I don't wanna go. This is what all this training was for. Who knows what it's gonna be like out there? You saw slides in class. Yeah, but... you hear these strange stories. Like, there's this pill these women take. Or sometimes the guys slam their heads up against a wall of hard rubber. (sperm #1) Oh, that's nonsense. Yeah, or... or what if it's a homosexual encounter? (sperm #2) This is no time to doubt our mission. You took an oath when you went to sperm school. To fertilise an ovum, or die trying. No, I'm scared. I don't wanna go out there. We're too low to attempt penetration. The men can't hold! We gotta hold! We need more stimulation. Organ room to brain control. Re-stimulate pleasure centre. - Prepare to stroke her thighs. - We're on the thighs and stroking. Attention, mouth. Attention, mouth. Please blow in her ear. Erection is at 45 degrees and holding fast. Readjust mouth. We're missing her ear and blowing into her nose. Attempt penetration. Thrust! Ah, it'll never work. The angle's bad. Hey, we're gonna make babies! This is Mission Control. Penetrate! - We can't. It's no use! - Hold tight, men! We're losing it. What am I doing here? What am I doing here?! It's going down! Keep it up, boys! Higher! Pull! It's no use! We're losing it! Start preparing an alibi to save face. We found him tampering with the machinery in the cerebral cortex... ...turning up the guilt reflex. - That's a lie. I never touched anything! - It's a lie, sir. - I work in the conscience room. We found the conscience tied to a chair. He'd knocked him out. - Is this true? - What if it is? Don't you think you should be ashamed of this?! Sexual relations between unmarried people?! To take an innocent woman... ...and assault her in a brutal, sadistic, ungodlike manner is... ...blasphemy! Lock him up. Sabotage is over. Blasphemy! It's blasphemy! Full steam ahead. (pleasured moans) - Here we go again! - I'm not going out there. I'm not gonna get shot outta that thing! What if he's masturbating? I'll wind up on the ceiling! - No! - Get a grip on yourself. Fellas... Fellas, it's dark out there! - Sh! Sh! - I'm due at my parents' for dinner. Heave-ho! Heave-ho! # Mine eyes have seen the glory # Of the coming of the Lord (excited gasps) # He hath loosed the fateful lightning # Of his terrible swift sword # His truth is marching on Mmm! We're inside! We're making it! (gasps) Memory, think of baseball players to keep sperm from premature launching. (melancholy harmonica) Can't hold out any longer. Prepare for release of sperm. Willie Mays. Joe Namath. Mickey Mantle. See you guys in the ovary! Save me an egg! Well, at least he's Jewish. (pleasured gasps) (bleeping) (frenetic bleeping) (bleeping slows) (alarm) (power shuts down) Listen! Everybody! Everybody! Can I have your attention? This is Mission Control. I just wanna congratulate everybody on a fine job, well done. I mean that in all sincerity. It was hectic, but we brought it through! (cheering) - Well, she was worth it. - Yes, she was. - I'll drink to that. - (relaxed chatter) That was great, Sydney. Let's do it one more time. Hey! Everybody stand by! - Here we go again! - (groaning) Attention, all hands! Attention, all hands! Stand by! Stand by! - Give me a fatigue reading. - Uh, 4.5. Fatigue reading 4.5. Looks good.

That's good. It's okay, I've got it. Thanks. - Good morning, madam. - Good morning, Karl. Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic. You'd better get some traps. - Rats? - I'm afraid so. But the attic is clean. All right, then, we've got clean rats. - No, no. No rats. - I just heard them, Karl. Maybe plumbing. Yeah, or maybe rats. Now, will you just get the traps? Yes, I go now. Don't go now. The stores aren't open yet. - I'll go see. - They're closed! In the group over here... I need a priest, a nun and two students. That's what we want. That's exactly what we want. Burke. Oh, Burke. - Is this scene really essential? - Chris. Just consider if we can do without it. Take a look at this damn thing. It just doesn't make sense. It's plain. You're a teacher of the college. You don't want the building torn down. - Come on. I can read, for Christ's sake. - Well, what's wrong? Well, why are they tearing the building down? Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris, I believe. - Hiding? - Fucking. Scene 39: Hotel. Take four. All right. Hustle, background. And action. Hasn't there been enough killing? Is this your campus? Get the Defense Department off this campus! It's our school! - You have no rights! - Hypocrite! Military complex, man! And action, Chris. I've seen enough killing in my lifetime! There's no need for it! That's right! That's right! We're all concerned with human rights, for God's sake... but the kids who want to get an education have a right too! Don't you understand? It's against your own principle, for God's sake! You can't accomplish anything by shutting kids off from their... - If you want... Hold it, hold it! - Quiet! If you want to effect any change, you have to do it within the system. Okay, cut. That's a wrap. - I'll walk home tonight. - Okay. Here, take that and drop it at my house, yeah? - Good night, Tom. - Good night. There's not a day in my life that I don't feel like a fraud. I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers. I've talked to them all. I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that. Hello? In here. - Hi. How did your day go? - Oh, not too bad. It was like the, uh, Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story. Other than that, terrific. - What we got, anything exciting? - Here. - Oh, all right. - And also, you got an invitation. - What's this? - Dinner at the White House. You're kidding. Is it a big party or something? I think it's five or six people. Oh. Thursday, huh? All right. Hi, Mom. What'd you do today? - Stuff. - What's that mean, stuff? Well, uh, me and Sharon played a game in the backyard. - You did. - And we had a picnic down by the river. That sounds good. You should have seen. This man came along on this beautiful gray horse. - Really? What kind? - Wasn't he pretty? Was it a mare, a gelding, what? - I think it was a gelding. - Mm-hm. It was gray. Oh, it was so beautiful. The guy let me ride it all around and everything. - You're kidding. - She rode for half an hour. It was so nice. Oh, I loved it. Oh, Mom, can't we get a horse? - Not while we're in Washington, honey. - Why not, Mom? Ha, ha. We'll see when we get home, okay? - When could I have one? - We'll see, Regan. We'll see. Hey, listen, on the party invitations, I wanted to write a personal... - Regan, don't! Regan, come back here! - Ha-ha-ha. - All right, give it up. Give it up! - No! - Ooh! - Ha-ha-ha. - You'll be sorry! Come on. - No! Father? Could you help an old altar boy? I'm a Catholic. All right, come on, man. - What, are you crazy? - Go ahead. Mama? Mama? Mama? Dimmy! Dimmy! Oh, how are you, Mama? - I'm so glad to see you. - You look good. I'm all right. - How's your leg? - How about you? You are all right? I'm fine, Mama. I'm fine. Your Uncle John passed by to visit me. - Oh, really? When? - Last month. - Too tight? - No. You have to stay off it. You can't go up and down the stairs. You have to give it a rest. Okay. I could take you somewhere where you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone. There would be people around. You wouldn't be sitting here listening to a radio. You understand me? This is my house and I'm not going no place. Dimmy, you worry for something? - No, Mama. - You are not happy? Tell me, what is the matter? Mama, I'm all right. I'm fine. Really, I am. Here it comes. There. - Oh, look at that. - Do you like it? Aw, isn't that funny? Ha, ha. I better put him over here to dry, though. He's still wet. Oh, here we go. There, he can dry there. Hey, where'd this come from? - I found it. - Where? Closet. Huh. You been playing with it? - Yup. - Do you know how? I'll show you. Wait a minute. You need two. No, you don't. I do it all the time. Oh, yeah? Well, let's both play with it. You really don't want me to play, huh? No, I do. Captain Howdy said no. - Captain who? - Captain Howdy. Who's Captain Howdy? You know. I make the questions and he does the answers. - Oh, Captain Howdy. Yeah, I see. - He's nice. Oh, I'll bet he is. - Here, I'll show you. - All right. Captain Howdy, do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice. - Well, maybe he's sleeping. - You think? Regan, why are you reading that stuff? Because I like it. It's not even a good picture of you. Look at that. - You look so mature. - I wouldn't talk. You wouldn't talk? Well, I didn't know they were taking it. I didn't have my makeup man there. Let me take an eyelash off your face. Okay. No, I didn't get it. - Mm. - What are we gonna do on your birthday? Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year? No work? What can we do? I don't know. Well, what would you like to do? - Got any ideas? - Mm-mm. Hmm? Let me think. Let me think. What can we do? Hey, we never finished seeing all the sights in Washington. Didn't get to Lee Mansion and lots of stuff. Shall we do that? Go sightseeing? If it's a nice day? - Yeah, let's do that. - Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie. Okay? Oh, I love you. I love you, Rags. We'll have a good day, yeah? You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like. Mr. Dennings? Well, you know, it's okay. Well, thank you very much... but why on earth would I wanna bring Burke on your birthday? Well, you like him. Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him? Hey, what's going on? What is this? - You're gonna marry him, aren't you? - Oh, my God. Are you kidding? - What? - Me marry Burke Dennings? Don't be silly. Of course not. Where did you ever get an idea like that? But you like him. Of course I like him. I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one. You don't like him like Daddy? Regan, I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy, honey. Okay? Burke just comes around here a lot, because... well, he's lonely. He don't got nothing to do. Well, I heard differently. Oh, you did? What did you hear, huh? - I don't know. I just thought. - Come on. What did you hear? Well, you didn't think so good. - How do you know? Ha, ha. - Ha-ha-ha. Because Burke and I are just friends. Okay? Really. Okay. You ready for sleep? - Good night. - Good night, honey. Lord, I was born a ramblin' man Lord, I was born a ramblin' man It's my mother, Tom. She's alone. I never should have left her. At least in New York, I'd be near her. I'd be close to her. I could see about a transfer, Damien. I need reassignment, Tom. I want out of this job. It's wrong, it's no good. You're the best we've got. Am I really? It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, Tom. Some of their problems come down to faith... their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore. I need out. I'm unfit. Think I've lost my faith, Tom. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator, you have got to be kidding! I have been on this line for 20 minutes! Jesus Christ. Can you believe this? He doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday. - Maybe the circuit is busy. - Oh, circuits, my ass! He doesn't give a shit. - Why don't you let me...? - No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right. Yes. No, operator, don't tell me there's no answer. It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome. Would you try it again, please, and let it ring? Hello? Yes. No, operator, I've given you the number four times. Do you take an illiteracy test to get that job, for Christ's sakes? Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it! Yeah? You're kidding me. Okay. I thought I just went to bed. Yeah. Hey, what are we doing, scene 61? Okay. Oh, just remind Flo about that blue belt, huh? All right. Yeah, I'll see you. What are you doing here? My bed was shaking. I can't get to sleep. Oh, honey. Goddamn it. Jesus. There's nothing. Oh, Karl. Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that. Very sorry, but you see, no rats. No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific. Oh, my God. Okay. Unroll your fist. Arm up. Very good. That wasn't so bad, was it? Remain perfectly still. Breathe normally. Tell me if you feel a vibration. Regan? You feel anything? Can you feel this? I don't feel anything. Put this in your mouth. Keep it there. This tells your temperature. When the red light goes on, that's your temperature. I don't want it. A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works. It's often seen in early adolescence. She shows all the symptoms. Hyperactivity. Her temper. Performance in math. Yeah. Why the math? What is that? It affects her concentration. Ah-ha. - Now, this is for Ritalin. - Okay. Ten milligrams a day. Is that a tranquilizer? It's a stimulant. A stimulant? My God, she's higher than a kite now. Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic behavior in a child. The Ritalin seems to work to relieve the condition. And as to how or why, we really don't know. But, uh, her symptoms could be overreaction to depression. That's out of my field. My daughter isn't depressed. Well, you mentioned her father and the separation. You think I should take her to a psychiatrist? No. I think we should wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. - Okay. - Let's wait two, three weeks. All right. And the lies she's been telling? That's part of it, huh? - Lies? - Like saying her bed's shaking. That stuff. Have you ever known your daughter to swear? - To use obscenities? - No, never. Hmm. Interesting. Similar... Similar to things like her lying... - ...it's uncharacteristic for her. - I don't understand. She doesn't swear. Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil. I find that hard to believe. What did she say? Her vocabulary is rather extensive. Well, give me an example. Like what? Specifically, what did she say? Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil... she advised me to keep my fingers away from her... goddamn cunt. I can't believe it. - She... - You don't think a psychiatrist...? No. I think the best explanation is always the simplest. - Well, we'll wait. We'll wait and see. - Yeah. So in the meantime... try not to worry. How? The edema affected her brain, you understand? She don't let no doctor come near her. She was all the time screaming, talking to the radio. - You should've called me when it happened. - Listen. Regular hospital not gonna put up with that. We give her a shot and bring her here... until the doctors fix up her leg, then we take her right out. Two or three months and she's out, good as new. - Miss? - Yes? We want to see Mrs. Karras. - Do you have an appointment? - Yes. - Are you a relative? - Yes, I am her brother. He is her son. Just a minute. You know, it's funny. If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist on Park Avenue. Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of there. You go in, Dimmy. I'll wait for you outside. You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side. No, no. No, no. Go get someone else. Don't bother the father. Go to your bed. Go to your bed. No, no. No, no. The father will be back to see you. It's all right. Mama. It's Dimmy, Mama. Dimmy. Why you did this to me, Dimmy? Why? Come on, I'm gonna take you out of here, Mama. I'm gonna take you home. I'll get you out of here tonight, Mama. Mama, everything's gonna be all right. Mama, I'm gonna take you home. Mama, I'm gonna take you home. - Couldn't you have put her someplace else? - Like what? Private hospital? Who got the money for that, Dimmy? You? There seems to be an alien pubic hair in my drink. - I beg your pardon? - Never seen it before in my life. Have you? We're pretty comfortable up there compared to the Gemini and Mercury programs. They were tight for space. You see, we got about 210 cubic feet, so we can move around. If you ever go up there again, will you take me along? Ha-ha-ha. What for? First missionary on Mars. Tell me, was it public relations you did for the Gestapo or community relations? - I'm Swiss. - Yes, of course. And you never went bowling with Goebbels, either, I suppose, eh? Nazi bastard. Over behind the church. You know where I mean? - It's a red brick wing. - Saint Mike's. What goes on there? Who's the priest I keep seeing there? He's there all the time. He has black hair. He's very intense looking. Who's that? - Damien Karras. - Karras? That's his office, back of Saint Mike's. He's our... Our psychiatric counselor. He had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy. His mother passed away. She was living by herself... and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her. Cunting Hun. Bloody, damned, butchering Nazi pig. Stop it! I'll kill you! What's the matter with you? What's for dessert? You sleeping? You get some sleep. Okay. Very good. All right. Listen, Burke, your car's at the curb. Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm. Yes, honey. What? Fuck it. - I've never seen him acting up. - Really. Blind is what he was. Down on Thoity-Thoid and Thoid - Hi, Chris. This is a great party. - Yeah, don't stop. Keep going. I don't need any encouragement. My idea of heaven is a solid white nightclub... with me as a headliner for all eternity, and they love me. Down on the east side Of Thoity-Thoid and Thoid That's my home sweet home Some people think It's the home of black eyes Just because... Hey, I think we've got a guest. You're gonna die up there. Regan? Oh, my God, honey. Honey, what's the matter? - Sorry, she's sick. - It's okay. She didn't know what she was saying. Come upstairs. Come on. What made you say that, Regan? Do you know, sweetheart? Mother? What's wrong with me? It's just like the doctor said. It's nerves, and that's all. Okay? You just take your pills and you'll be fine. Really. Okay? Is it coming out, Willi? - Yes, I think so. - Good. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! - Oh, my God! - Make it stop! - I'm gonna fold. - Big flop. Another five for the pair. There's the ten with two and three of clubs. And a six. Pair of threes still best. - I'll talk to you about it tomorrow. - Yeah! Yeah. Hey, if you get a chance, can you take a look at it for me? Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal... - ...the poor box? - Ha. That's an insult. I got a vow of poverty. Where'd you get it, then? I stole it. I believe you. College presidents shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example. I figure I saved him from a big temptation. Oh, Christ! I should have been there. I wasn't there. Should have been. There was nothing you could do. Lie down. Give me the butt. Come on. - Now you think you can sleep? - Yeah. - Are you gonna steal my shoes now? - No. I tell fortunes by reading the creases. Now, shut up and go to sleep. Good night. Stealing is a sin. I don't want it! - Regan, honey, it's to help you. - I don't want it! - Hold still, honey. - I don't want it! You fucking bastard! Remember also, O Lord, thy servant, Mary Karras... who has gone before us with the sign of faith and sleeps the sleep of peace. Lord, I am not worthy to receive you. But only say the word and I shall be healed. May the body of Christ bring me to everlasting life. Well, it's a symptom... of a type of disturbance in the chemical-electrical activity of the brain. In your daughter's case, the temporal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. - Mm-hm. - It's rare... but it does cause bizarre hallucinations... and usually just before a convulsion. A convulsion? The shaking of the bed. That's doubtless due to muscular spasms. Oh, no, no, that was no spasm. Look, I got on the bed. The whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor... and shaking, the whole thing, with me on it. Mrs. MacNeil, the problem with your daughter is not her bed. It's her brain. So, um, ahem. What causes this? Lesion. Lesion in the temporal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder. Look, Doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change. - In the temporal lobe, it's very common. - It is? It, uh, can last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive... even criminal behavior. Hey, do me a favor, will you? Tell me something good. Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion, in a way, she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar. - Let's move her. - Regan, can you sit up, scoot over? A little more. Good. Regan, I'm just gonna move you down on the table, okay? Let me do this. It's okay. See? There we go. It's just for a short time. You're doing fine. Very sticky. Good. Now, Regan, you're gonna feel something a little bit cold and wet. Okay. Now you're gonna feel a little stick here. Don't move. Good. Okay. You're gonna feel some pressure here. Now, don't move. Hook up. There's nothing there. No vascular displacement at all. Do you want me to run another series? I don't think so. I'd like you to see her again. Excuse me, doctor. Chris MacNeil is on the phone. She says it's urgent. - You got some time? - Of course. - Dr. Klein? - Yes, I'm Dr. Klein. - This is Dr. Taney. - How do you do? Things have gotten worse since I phoned. Come upstairs. - Is she having spasms again? - They've gotten violent. - Did you give her the medication? - Yes. - What was that? - Thorazine. Before that, it was Ritalin. Chris, doctors. - This is Dr. Taney. - Mother, please! - What is it? - Please, make it stop! It's burning! It's burning! Do something, doctor. Please, help her. Please, Mother, make it stop! He's trying to kill me! Mother! Mother! All right, Regan, let's see what the trouble... Regan! Keep away! The sow is mine! Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me! Stay away from me! Stay away! Hold her steady. Hold her tight! Don't let them! She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow. What was going on in there? How could she fly off the bed like that? Pathological states can induce abnormal strength... accelerated motor performance. For example... say a 90-pound woman sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck... runs out and lifts the wheels a half a foot up off the ground. You've heard the story. Same thing here. Same principle, I mean. So, what's wrong with her? We still think that the temporal lobe... Oh, what are you talking about, for Christ's sakes? Did you see her or not? She's acting like she's fucking out of her mind! Psychotic, like a split personality, or... Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. There haven't been more than 100 authentic cases... of so-called ""split personality,"" Mrs. MacNeil. Now, I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry... but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first. So, what's next? A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal. Oh, Christ! Well, what we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms... could conceivably turn up there. At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities. Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative. In other words, normal. You keep any drugs in your house? No, of course not. Nothing like that. Are you sure? Well, of course, I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass. Are you planning to be home soon? I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean. Um... No, I, uh... I'm building a new house. My old one has been sold. I don't know. I was gonna take... I was gonna take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school. Why do you ask? I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist. Hello? Sharon? Shit. God. Sharon! What do you mean, leaving Regan by herself? Her window's wide open. The room is freezing. - Didn't he tell you? - Who? - Burke is... - What's Burke got to do with it? Nobody was here. When I went to get the Thorazine... - ...I had him stay with her, and... - Oh. - I should have known better. Sorry. - I guess you should have. How were the tests? We have to start looking for a shrink. Hi, Chuck. Come on in. I suppose you heard. Heard what? You haven't heard. Burke's dead. He must have been drunk. He fell from the top of the steps right outside. By the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck. Oh, God. No! Yeah, I know. Sharon... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. When I touch your forehead, open your eyes. Are you comfortable, Regan? Yes. How old are you? Twelve. Is there someone inside you? Sometimes. Who is it? I don't know. Is it Captain Howdy? I don't know. If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer? No. Why not? I'm afraid. If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you? Yes. I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now. If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions. Come forward... and answer me now. Are you the person inside of Regan? Who are you? - Help me! - Let go! Father Karras? Have we met? No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell. That you look like a boxer. William F. Kinderman. Homicide. What's this all about? It's true. You do look like a boxer. Like John Garfield in Body and Soul. Exactly. John Garfield. People tell you that, Father? Do people tell you you look like Paul Newman? Always. Well, you know this director who was doing the film here... Burke Dennings? I've seen him. You've seen him. You're also familiar how last week he died? Only what I read in the papers. Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft? From the Witching end, not the hunting. I once did a paper on it. Really? From the psychiatric end. I know. I read it. All of this desecration in the church... do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft? Maybe. Some rituals used in the black mass, maybe. And now Dennings. You read how he died? In a fall. Let me tell you how. And please, Father... confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father... was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M Street... with his head turned completely around... facing backwards. Didn't happen in the fall? It's possible. - Possible, however... - Unlikely. Exactly. So on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder... and on the other hand, a black mass-type desecration in the church. You think the killer and the desecrator are the same? Maybe somebody crazy... somebody with a spite against the Church. Some unconscious rebellion. A sick priest, is that it? Look, Father, this is hard for you. Please, I understand... but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist. You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that. I don't know anyone who fits that description. Ah. Doctor's ethics. If you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh? No, I probably wouldn't. Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist... in sunny California, no less... was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient. - Is that a threat? - No, I mention it only in passing. Incidentally, I mention it only in passing... I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession. Hey, Father, wait a minute. - Do you like movies? - Very much. Well, I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K, though, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go. - That's too bad. - Yeah, I hate to go alone. I love to talk film... discuss, to critique. You want to see a film with me? I got passes to the Crest. It's Othello. - Who's in it? - Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You happy? - I've seen it. - Ah. One last time. You can think of some priest who fits the bill? - Come on. - No, answer the question, Father Paranoia. All right. All right. - You know who I think really did it? - Who? The Dominicans. Go pick on them. I could have you deported, you know that? I lied. You look like Sal Mineo. It looks like a type of disorder that's, uh, rarely ever seen anymore... except in primitive cultures. We call it, uh, somnambular-form possession. Quite frankly, we really don't know much about it at all... except that it starts with a conflict or a guilt... and it leads to the patient's delusions that his body has been invaded... by some alien intelligence. Um... A spirit, if you will. Look, I'm telling you again, and you'd better believe me... I am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum. - Well, it's out of... - And I don't care what you call it. I'm not putting her away. Well, I'm sorry. You're sorry? Jesus Christ! Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can tell me with all your bullshit is... Of course, there is one outside chance for a cure. But, um, I think of it as a shock treatment. As I said, it's a very outside chance... Would you just name it, for God's sakes? What is it? - Do you have any religious beliefs? - No. What about your daughter? No. Why? Have you ever heard of exorcism? Well, it's a stylized ritual... in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's been pretty much discarded these days... except by the Catholics, who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. But it, uh, has worked, in fact... although not for the reasons they think, of course. It's purely force of suggestion. The, uh... The victim's belief in possession is what helped cause it... so in that same way... the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear. You're telling me that I should take my daughter to a witch doctor. Is that it? Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom? She's going to be well? Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me. Now, did you? No, not me. I didn't. This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there? Of course, I didn't. I didn't put it. - Excuse me, madam. - What? - A man to see you. - What man? Might your daughter remember, perhaps... if Mr. Dennings was in her room that night? - Why do you ask? - Mm. Might she remember? No, she was heavily sedated. It's serious? Yes, I'm afraid it is. - May I ask...? - We still don't know. Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria. Excuse me, madam. Anything else? No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you. It's all right, Karl. Why are you asking all this? It's strange. The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes... and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil... it isn't likely he would fall from a window. Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found. Except maybe one chance in a thousand. No. My hunch... My opinion... he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of his skull: point two... plus the various other things we mentioned... would make it very probable... probable, not certain... that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be? It could be one way. If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left... and the time you returned. Judas Priest, just a second. - The servants? They have visitors? - Not at all. You were expecting a package that day, some delivery? Not that I know of. Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package? I really wouldn't know. See, Karl takes care of all that. I see. Would you like to ask him? No, never mind, it's... It's very remote. No, never mind. Yeah. Would you like some more coffee? Please. That's cute. Your daughter, she's the artist? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Incidentally, um... you might ask your daughter... if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night. Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room. Oh, I know, I realize... but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?""... we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct? Well, when she's better, I'll ask her. - Yeah, couldn't hurt. - Okay. Uh, in the meantime... That's okay. - I really hate to ask you this, but... - What? For my daughter, could you please give an autograph? Of course. Uh, where's a pencil? Right here. Here. Oh. She'd love it. And what's her name? I lied. It's for me. - The spelling is on the back: Kinderman. - Okay. You know that film you made, um, Angel? - Oh, yeah. - I saw that six times. - Really? - It was beautiful. Ha, ha. Thank you. You're a very nice lady. - Thank you. - You're a nice man. Uh, I'll come back when she's feeling better. - Bye. - Bye. Please, no! - Do it! - Please, don't! You bitch! Do it! Do it! Please, no! Yes! Let Jesus fuck you! Let Jesus fuck you! Let him fuck you! Aah! Give it! Give it to me! Aah! - Ugh! - Lick me! Lick me! Chris! Mrs. MacNeil, open the door! Open the door! Do you know what she did... your cunting daughter? Chris MacNeil? Please, go away. I'm Father Karras. I'm very sorry. Hello. I should have told you I wouldn't be in uniform. Yeah, that would have helped. - Have you got a cigarette, Father? - Sure. Thanks. Cold. Yeah. Uh... How did a shrink ever get to be a priest? It's the other way around. The Society sent me through medical school. Oh. Where? Harvard, Bellevue, Johns Hopkins. - Places like that. - I see. - You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right? - Yes, I am. - Pretty close? - Pretty close. Did he talk to you about my party? He sure did. About my daughter? No, I didn't know you had one. - He didn't mention her? - No. Oh. Didn't tell you what she did? He didn't mention her. Priests are pretty tight-mouthed, then, huh? That depends. - On what? - The priest. Sure. I mean, what if a person, uh, came to you... you know, that was a murderer or criminal of some kind... and they wanted some kind of help? I mean, would you have to turn him in? Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no. - You wouldn't? - No, I wouldn't. But I would try to convince him to turn himself in. Mm-hm. And, uh, how do you go about getting an exorcism? I beg your pardon? If, um... If a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something... how do they get an exorcism? I'd have to get them into a time machine and get them back to the 16th century. I didn't get you. It just doesn't happen anymore, Mrs. MacNeil. Oh, yeah? Since when? Well, since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All those things they taught me at Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil, since the day I joined the Jesuits... I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism. Not one. Yeah, well... it just so happens that somebody very close to me... is probably possessed. And needs an exorcist. Father Karras, it's my little girl. Then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism. Why? I don't understand. - To begin with, it could make things worse. - Oh, how? Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism... conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. - Yeah, but... - Meanwhile, your daughter... - You could do it yourself. - No. I'd need Church approval... - ...and that's rarely given. - But... Uh... - Could you see her? - Yes, I could. I could see her as a psychiatrist, but I... Oh, not a psychiatrist. She needs a priest. She's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world, and they sent me to you. Now are you gonna send me back to them? - Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me? - You don't understand... Oh, God, can't you help her? Just help her! It wants no straps. Hello, Regan. I'm a friend of your mother's. I'd like to help you. You might loosen these straps, then. I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan. I'm not Regan. I see. Well, then, let's introduce ourselves. I'm Damien Karras. And I'm the devil. Now, kindly undo these straps. If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear? That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras. Where's Regan? In here, with us. Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps. Could you help an old altar boy, Father? Your mother's in here with us, Karras. Would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it. If that's true... then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it? What is it? Thank you. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good. Nothing you could do could make it any worse. I can't do it. I need evidence that the Church would accept... - ...as signs of possession. - Like what? Speaking in a language she's never known or studied. What else? I don't know. I'd have to look it up. I thought you were supposed to be an expert. There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession as most priests. Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon. She says she's the devil himself. If you've seen as many psychotics as I have... you'd realize that's the same thing as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You asked me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find. You show me Regan's double... same face, same voice, everything... and I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut. I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter. I want you to tell me that you know for a fact... that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind. Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good. You tell me that! Did Regan know a priest was coming over? - No. - Did you know my mother died recently? - Yes, I did. I'm very sorry. - No. Is Regan aware of it? Not at all. Why do you ask? It's not important. Good night. Hello? - Here, take it and just don't... - Okay. Um. Hello, Daddy? This is me. - What should I say? I don't know. - Just talk to your daddy. - Anything you want. - All right, um... Tell him what you've been doing and how you're feeling and like that. Uh... Well, you see, um... I mean, I hope you can hear me. Can you hear me okay? - Well, uh, let me see. - He's not gonna answer you. Uh, ha-ha-ha. - Go on. Talk to your daddy, honey. - Um... I don't know what to say, though. Um... Well, let's see. First we... No. - Wait. I don't know. - Come on, Regan. - Tell him about Washington. - Okay. See, we're in Washington now, Daddy, and... He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said: ""Take this, all of you, and eat it..."" ""...for this is my body."" When the supper was ended, he took the cup. Again he gave you thanks and praise. He gave the cup to his disciples and said, ""Take this..."" all of you, and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood. ""The blood of the new and everlasting covenant, the mystery of faith."" What an excellent day for an exorcism. You'd like that? Intensely. But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan? It would bring us together. You and Regan? You and us. - Did you do that? - Uh-huh. - Do it again. - In time. No, now. In time. Mirabile dictu, don't you agree? You speak Latin? How long are you planning to stay in Regan? Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth. What's that? Holy water. You keep it away. It burns! Oh, it burns! Who are you? You know, I'm, like, in seclusion. No, I'm just exhausted from work. Um... She's... She's all right. She's just a little... I don't want to talk about it, okay? Um... Okay, I'll talk to you. I'll call you as soon as it's over, all right? No, I just... I'm really... I'm going through something... and I just have to, uh... No, no. No, no. There's nothing. Hey, thanks a lot. Bye, now. - Want a drink? - Please. What do you drink? Uh, Scotch. - Ice, water. - Okay. No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen. - No, I'll take it straight. - It's fine. No, please, sit. - Really? You sure? - Yeah, sit. Where's her father? In Europe. - Have you told him what's happening? - No. Well, I think you should. I told Regan that was holy water. I sprinkled it on her and she reacted very violently. - It's tap water. - What's the difference? Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession. She killed Burke Dennings. What? She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out her window. Who are you? It's a language, all right. It's English. What do you mean? It's English in reverse. Listen. Give us time. Let her die. I am no one. I am no one. Fear the priest. Fear the priest. Merrin! I am no one. Merrin! Fear the priest. Merrin! Merrin! Yeah? Yeah? I'll be right there. I don't want Chris to see this. - Well, what's wrong? What is it? - Shh. You're convinced that it's genuine? I don't know. No, not really, I suppose. But I have made... a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual. You would want to do the exorcism yourself? Yes. Might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in foreign missions. I understand, Your Excellency. Let's see who's around. In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know. Thank you, Your Excellency. Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway. What about the exorcist? Have you any ideas? How about Lankester Merrin? Merrin? I had a notion he was in Iraq. I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh. You're right, but he's finished. He came back three or four months ago. He's at Woodstock now. What's he doing there, teaching? He's working on another book. Don't you think he's too old, Tom? How's his health? He must be all right. He's still running around digging up tombs. Mm. - Besides, he's had experience. - I didn't know that. Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted months. I heard it damn near killed him. Father? - You're Mrs. MacNeil? - Yes. I'm Father Merrin. - Come in. - Thank you. - Is Father Karras here? - Yes. - He's here already. - Father? - Father Karras. - It's an honor to meet you, Father. - Are you very tired? - No. I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence, Damien... and gather up a cassock for myself... two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water... and, um... your copy of The Roman Ritual. The large one. I believe we should begin. Do you want to hear the background of the case first? Why? This is yours to do with as you please. You can choose to escape, if you want, but you may never be able to return. Don't let anyone decide for you. Hail Mary, full of grace... - Excuse me. - Thank you. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Would you like some brandy in that, Father? Well, the doctors say I shouldn't. But thank God... my will is weak. Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon. We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He's a liar. The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth... to attack us. The attack is psychological, Damien. And powerful. So don't listen. Remember that. Do not listen. It might be helpful if I gave you some background... on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, I'd say there seem to be three. - She's convinced that she's... - There is only one. What is your daughter's middle name, Mrs. MacNeil? Teresa. What a lovely name. Stick your cock up her ass... you motherfucking worthless cocksucker. - Be silent! - Aah! Our Father, who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done... on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from the evil one. Save me, O God, by thy name. By thy might, defend my cause. Proud men have risen up against me, and men of violence seek my life... but God is my helper and the Lord sustains my life. In every need, he has delivered me. Glory be to the Father, to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now and shall be, world without end. - Save your servant. - Who places her trust in thee, my God. - Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower. - In the face of the enemy... - Let the enemy have no power over her. - Son of iniquity be powerless to harm her. Your mother sucks cocks in hell, Karras. You faithless slime. The Lord be with you. - And also with you. - Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father... everlasting God... and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ... who, once and for all, consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell... who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion... hasten to our call for help... and snatch from ruination and from the clutches of the noonday devil... this human being, made in your image and likeness. Strike terror, Lord, into the beast now laying waste to your vineyard. Let your mighty hand cast him out of your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil... so he may no longer hold captive this person... whom it pleased you to make in your image... Aah! And to redeem through your son, who lives and reigns with you... in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever. - Amen. - O Lord, hear my prayer. Father Karras. Father Karras. Damien. The response, please, Damien! And let my cry come unto thee. Almighty Lord, word of God the Father, Jesus Christ... God and Lord of all creation... Who gave to your holy apostles... the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me... your unworthy servant... - ...pardon for all my sins... - Bastards! And the power to confront this cruel demon. See the cross of the Lord. Be gone, you hostile power. - O Lord, hear my prayer. - And let my cry come unto thee. - The Lord be with you. - And also with you. Father. I cast you out, unclean spirit! - Shove it up your ass, you faggot! - In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ! It is he who commands you! He who flung you straight from heaven to the depths of hell! - Fuck him! - Be gone... - Fuck him, Karras! - ...from this creature of God. Be gone! In the name of the Father, and of the Son... and the Holy Spirit. By this sign of the Holy Cross, of our Lord Jesus Christ... who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Damien! Amen. God, defender of the human race... look down in pity... You killed your mother! You left her alone to die! - Shut up! - She'll never forgive you! - Shut up! - Bastard! I command you... by the judge of the living and the dead... to depart from this servant of God. It's the power... Holy water. It's the power of Christ that compels you. - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you! - The power of Christ compels you. - The power of Christ compels you. He brought you low by his blood-stained cross! Do not despise my command, because you know me to be a sinner. It is God himself who commands you. The majestic Christ who commands you. God, the Father, commands you. God, the Son, commands you. God, the Holy Spirit, commands you. The mystery of the cross commands you. The blood of the martyrs commands you. Give way to Christ, you prince of murderers. You're guilty before almighty God. Guilty before his son. Guilty before the whole human race. It is the Lord who expels you... he who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world, by fire. Are you tired? Let's rest before we start again. Why this girl? It doesn't make sense. I think the point is to make us despair. To see ourselves as... animal and ugly. To reject the possibility that God could love us. Will you excuse me, Damien? Why? Why? No. No. Dimmy, why you do this to me? Please, Dimmy. I'm afraid. You're not my mother. Dimmy, please! What is it? Her heart. Can you give her something? She'll go into a coma. You're not my mother! Don't listen. Why, Dimmy? Damien. - Dimmy, please. - Damien. Get out. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name... Is it over? Mm-mm. Is she gonna die? No. You son of a bitch! Take me. Come into me. Goddamn you, take me! Take me! No! Mother. Mother. Mother. Did somebody fall? - The steps! - Help! Mother! Mother! Rags? Do you want to make your confession? Are you sorry for...? Are you sorry for having offended God and for all the sins of your past life? - Where do you want this? - What? Phonograph. Storage. That's everything. I'm gonna miss you. Same here. Sure you won't change your mind? I found this in her room. You better hurry. Come on, honey, we have to get going. She doesn't remember any of it. That's good. - All done. - Okay. Honey, this is Father Dyer. - Hi, Father. - Hello. Ready, missus. - Goodbye, Father. - Goodbye. I'll call you. Bye. - Bye, Father. - I hope I see you again. I hope so too. Father Dyer? I thought you'd like to keep this. Why don't you keep it? Lieutenant. You just missed them. How's the girl? She seemed fine. That's important. That's important. Well, well... back to business, back to work. - Goodbye, Father. - Goodbye. Father Dyer... do you go to films? Sure. Well, I got passes. In fact, I got a pass to the Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go? - What's playing? - Wuthering Heights. Who's in it? Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball. I've seen it. Another one. - Had your lunch? - No., The child is dead. He breathed just for a moment. Then he breathed no more. The child is dead. Dead. The child is dead. I'm afraid it will kill her. My God, she wanted a baby so much. For such a long time. What can I tell her? What will I say? You could adopt a child. She wanted her own. If I may suggest, it even resembles... Your wife need never know. It would be a blessing to her and to the child. Are there no relatives? None. The mother died, as your own child, in the same moment. You said it could be ours, but... On this night, Mr Thorn, God has given you a son. Here's your boy. Good morning. Come va? - What are you doing home so early? - Just came to start packing. What? We can't waste any time. We're leaving in the morning. Buongiorno, Carlo. Please, Carlo. What are you talking about? I am talking about London. I am talking about the ambassador to the Court of St James. - Well, what about him? - You're married to him. I'm what? It's me. I'm appointed ambassador to Great Britain. I've already told them yes. I loved it the minute I saw it. Well, it's a bit much. Well, nothing's too much for the wife of the future president of the United States. You know, you're pushy. Come on. Wait till you see this. Now this, they call his day room. His day room. So? How do you like it so far? - Well, it needs some books. To warm it up. - Couple of books. Warm it up. Yeah. - Something in mind, Mr Ambassador? - Why don't we have a little look upstairs? Well, there's no furniture up there, either. You know, you could be too sexy for the White House. - I'm gonna miss you so much. - I won't be long. We don't have that much to talk about. Since when did two old college roommates not have much to talk about? Since one of them assumed the awesome burden of the presidency. - Well, give my regards to the first lady. - I'll do my best. Why don't you change you mind, fly over with me? No, I'd better stay here and fool around with Damien. - Where is he? - He was right behind us... Damien? Oh, my God, Robert. Damien! Robert, where could he be? You little monkey. Don't you ever do that again. There you are. - Go. - Hooray. - Run out of film? - Just saving a bit for his canonization. - How's that? - He's either the heir to the Thorn millions - or Jesus Christ himself. - Want a bite, Daddy? Go on, Damien. Smile. A big birthday smile. Come on. Smile. Holly. - I'll take him, ma'am. - No, I'll take him. Come on. One... two... three... Let me jump on it, Daddy. Let me jump on it. Hold on. Damien. Damien, look at me. I'm over here. - Damien, I love you. - Look. There's Nanny. Look at me, Damien. It's all for you. Oh, my God. Go, Tom. - Morning. Have you read the papers today? - No, I haven't. There was an article on the suicide, your nanny thatjumped. - They say that she left a suicide note, sir. - Not true. Mr Ambassador, did you know she was on drugs? Would you mind? - Mr Thorn, did she use drugs? - Not that I know of. - The article said... - I don't care what the article said. I'm sorry. I am sorry. Will you send me a bill for the damage? No, that's all right, Mr Ambassador. Let's just say you owe me. Corporal. OK, outside. Yes? - There's a Father Brennan here to see you. - Who? A priest named Father Brennan from Rome. He says it's a matter of urgent personal business. - Never heard of him. - He says he just needs a minute. - Something about a hospital. - Donation time. - All right, send him in. - I didn't know you were such a soft touch. On that trip to Saudi Arabia, why isn't it the right time? Well, it's personal, Tom. I just don't feel like leaving home right now. Yes, Father? We haven't much time. You must listen to what I have to say. All right. What is it? You must accept Christ as your savior. You must accept him now. Forgive me, but didn't I understand that you have a matter of urgent personal business? You must take Communion. Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh. Only if he is within you can you defeat the son of the devil. - I see. - He's killed once. He'll kill again. He'll kill until everything that's yours is his. - Father, would you mind... - Only through Christ can you fight him. Accept the Lord Jesus. Drink his blood. I've locked the door, Mr Thorn. - Yes? - Would you send for a security guard? I beg you, Mr Thorn. Listen to what I have to say. Ambassador Thorn? I was at the hospital, Mr Thorn, the night your son was born. - I witnessed the birth. - Sir? I beg you. All right. Stand by. - What do you want? - To save you, Mr Thorn. So Christ will forgive me. What do you know about my son? - Everything. - And what is that? I saw its mother. - You saw my wife. - I saw its mother. - You're referring to my wife. - Its mother, Mr Thorn. This is blackmail. Come out and say it. What are you trying to say? His mother was aja... - Everything OK? - You sounded strange. The door was locked. - I want this gentleman escorted out of here. - OK, let's go. Accept Christ each day. Drink his blood. - Just get him off the grounds. - All right, Father. Come on. Father. Thank you. Come in. Excuse me. Mrs Baylock is here. She says she's the new governess. Well, that's a start. Show her in. Come in, please. - Ambassador and Mrs Thorn. - How do you do? I know it's a difficult time for you, so I'll not intrude on your grief. I'm here to take away some of your troubles and anxieties. We'll soon help your little boy to forget what's happened. I'm afraid, sir, that some of our young nannies, they get homesick, or they have boyfriend problems. I left all that behind a long time ago. Well, now, if you'll let me see your boy? Yes, of course. He's upstairs. I'll show you where it is. Why don't you just leave us alone at first? Let us get acquainted in our own way. - Well, he's shy with new people. - Oh, no. Not with me, he won't be. - Well, I don't think... - I think it'll be fine. Go on. Give it a try. All right, then. - Mrs Horton. - This way, Mrs Baylock. Excuse me. - I like her. - She seems all right. Where'd you find her? - Where did I find her? - Yeah. I didn't find her. I assumed you found her. Round that corner to the right and it's the door facing you. - I'll have your things sent up in a moment. - Thank you. - Mrs Baylock. - Yes, ma'am? I'm sorry, but we're a little bit confused. Oh? Why's that? - Well, we don't know how you got here. - The agency. - The agency? - Well, yes. They read in the paper about the... well, about your first nanny, so they sent you another. - That's it. - I'll call to confirm that. - Here are my references. - Thank you very much. Well, if I could see your boy, now? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. Have no fear, little one. I am here to protect thee. - In a minute, Horton, I think. - Very good, sir. - Kathy. - I'm coming. Mrs Baylock. - Mrs Baylock. - Yes, ma'am? - Where's Damien? - If you don't mind, I think he'd rather go to the park. - The park? I told you he was going with us. - He's too young for church. - He'll cause a fuss. - You don't seem to understand. It is my wish and my husband's wish that Damien accompanies us to church. - Kathy. - I'll be there in a minute. Now, please have him dressed at once. Well, excuse me for speaking my mind, ma'am, but do you really think a five-year-old will understand the goings-on of an Episcopal wedding? Will you have my son dressed and in the car in five minutes? Thank you very much. What's the matter, Damien? It's just a church, that's all. What's the matter? - Robert. - Something wrong? - I don't know. He just seems scared to death. - Is he ill? No, he's just... No, he's just trembling all over. - Mr Ambassador. Welcome, sir. - Good morning. - No! - Damien. Damien, stop it. Damien, stop it. Damien. No! Horton, drive on. Are you sure that you don't wanna call a doctor? No, it's just a couple of bruises. It'll be all right in the morning. No, I mean for Damien. Oh, no, he's fine. He's sound asleep. Just to have him examine him. Well, he's perfectly all right. Never been sick a day in his life. He never has, has he? Isn't that a little strange? Is it? I mean, no measles or mumps or chickenpox. - Not even a cough or a cold. - So? I just think it's a little unusual. Look, he's a perfectly healthy boy. I mean, we have nothing to worry about with him. Not physically or otherwise. He just had a bad moment. You know, like a fright. Yes? - I'm leavin' now. Is there anything else? - Nothing, thank you. Good night. I think the best thing to do with a bad day like this is end it. I'm gonna go to bed. I'll be along soon. Quiet, now. This is the master of the house. - What is this? - Sir? The dog. - Beautiful, isn't he? We found him outside. - Who gave you permission to bring it in? I thought we could use a good watchdog, sir. And Damien loves him. Gave you a fright, did he, sir? - Yes. - Well, you see how good he is. As a watchdog, I mean. I think you'll be grateful on your long trips away, sir. Mrs Baylock, we don't need a dog, and if we do, I'll pick him out myself. - Damien's taken quite a fancy to him, sir. - Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA, tell them to collect the dog and find him another home. You understand? Sir. Come on, boy. Welcome to Windsor Safari Park. Animal compound to your left. Parking, for refreshment and zoo area, to your right. When driving through animal compounds, please keep all car windows closed. Thank you. Thank you. Come on, darling. Let's go see the monkeys, OK? - Good morning, Horton. - Good morning, sir. Baboons bite. Keep all car windows closed. Keep all car windows closed. Baboons are dangerous. Oh, no. - All right, Kathy? - Yeah. You're so silent this evening. Just tired, I guess. Sorry. - Damien all right? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yes. If there were anything wrong, you'd tell me, wouldn't you? Wrong? What could be wrong with our child, Robert? We're beautiful people, aren't we? There is something wrong, isn't there? Kathy. Is it so serious? Robert, I want... I need to see a psychiatrist. I have fears. I have such fears. What kind of fears? What kind? If I told you, you'd put me away. Kathy, I love you. I love you. Then help me. Find me a doctor. I will. Of course I will. Keep that scrum tight. Get down low. Come on. Let it go. Let it go. Bring him down. Well done. I don't know what you're clapping for. You just lost a bet. - That's right. 27-3? - Right. That'll be three quid. - I thought it was two. - Inflation. Haven't you heard, old boy? Well done, George. Great stuff. It was a good game. Go and have a quick drink with the lads. That'll give me time to make sure everything's set up. Tomorrow, half past two, Bishop's Park. Five minutes and you'll never see me again. Your wife is in danger. She'll die unless you come. Father. Thanks again. Get on with it. Say what you have to say. ""When the Jews return to Zion, and a comet rips the sky, and the Holy Roman Empire rises, then you and I must die."" ""From the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother, till man exists no more."" - The Book of Revelations predicted it all. - I'm not here to listen to a sermon. ""It is by means of a human personality entirely in his possession that Satan will wage his last and formidable offense."" - You said that my wife... - Go to the town of Megiddo in the old city of Jezreel. There, see the old man Bugenhagen. - He alone can say how the child must die. - Look here... ""He who will not be saved by the lamb will be torn by the beast."" Will you stop? I'm here because you said my wife is in danger. She is pregnant. - You're mistaken. That's nonsense. - He will not allow the child to be born. - He will kill it while it slumbers in the womb. - What are you talking about? Your son, Mr Thorn. The son of the devil. He will kill the unborn child, then he will kill your wife, and when he is certain to inherit all that is yours, then, Mr Thorn, he will kill you. That's enough! With your power, he will establish his counterfeit kingdom here, receiving his power directly from Satan. - You're insane. - He must die, Mr Thorn. You asked for five minutes, and you've got five minutes. Go to the city of Megiddo. See Bugenhagen before it's too late. Now, I've heard you. I want you to hear me. I never want to see you again. You'll see me in hell, Mr Thorn. There will we share out our sentence. No! Mrs Baylock. - Anything wrong? - I just can't stand that noise. It's not all that bad. - Good morning, Damien. - Good morning, Daddy. - What are we gonna do? - Hold my hands. - Right. - Mrs Baylock. Yes, ma'am? - Would you take him out of here, please? - He's only playing. Would you just get him out of here, please? Yes, ma'am. Come along, Damien. Excuse me, sir. Come along. Darling, I don't know what's the matter with me. I just... I just don't seem to be able to... I don't know. Kathy, I love you. If this is what the doctor's doing to you, don't you think it's time I had a talk with him? Yes, you should. There's something he wants to talk to you about, anyway. Oh? Robert, I don't ever want to have any more children. All right. Then you'll agree to an abortion? I'm pregnant, Robert. I just found out this morning. Yes? Yes, this is he. Who? Who? But... Hello? Hello? Something about the newspapers. Well, she knew how much you wanted one. Now she can't cope. She searches for reasons that won't make her feel inadequate. She has these fantasies. She fantasises that your child is alien and that your child is evil. She thinks that the child is evil? The point is, at this time, another child would be disastrous. Well, in what way evil? Now, this is just fantasy. She also thinks the child isn't hers. The most important thing for you to do is to agree to an abortion. No. I'd like to know your reason. It was foretold that this pregnancy would be terminated. I'm going to fight to see that it's not. - Forgive me, Doctor. - Please don't leave. I'm sorry. I must get home. Damien. No, no, no, no! No! No! Are there any developments on the state of your wife, sir? - How is your wife, Mr Ambassador? - Is there any news, sir? - Ambassador Thorn? - Yes. Doctor? My name is Becker. Is she all right? Well, she will recover. She's in there. Bed by the window. She has a concussion and a broken humerus, and, well, some internal bleeding. - Internal bleeding? - Yes. But she's pregnant. No. - She's lost it? - Afraid so. You know, you've got a lot to be grateful for. She's still alive. And, with proper care, she can still have children. Robert. Robert. Don't let him kill me. Don't let him kill me. Kathy. It's all right. - Yes? - I'm sorry to bother you, Ambassador Thorn. - Who is this? - My name is Keith Jennings, sir. The photographer whose camera got smashed. Would it be possible to have a word with you at my flat? - If it's about the camera... - No, it's not about the camera. It's about you, Mr Thorn. And the death of the priest. Go on. Do you notice anything unusual? No. Sorry. At first I thought this was just a fault in the film. A strange coincidence. Then it happened again. Interesting, don't you think? And this, I took on the day that you were at the rugby match. - Same thing? - Only it's more pronounced and it's actually making contact with the body. The rest, of course - history. I can't explain it. That's why I started digging. The coroner's report shows that he was riddled with cancer. High on morphine most of the time. Injected himself two or three times a day. - He knew that he was dying? - Apparently, yes. He said that he wanted to be forgiven by Christ. Externally, his body was normal, except for one thing on the inside of his right thigh. - What is it? - Three sixes. Six hundred and sixty-six. - Concentration camp? - That's what I thought. But the biopsy says it's a birthmark. The best is yet to come. Pages of the Bible. Thousands of 'em. Every inch of wall-space covered, even the windows. He even needed to be close to his church. There are 47. I counted them. I think he was trying to keep something out, don't you? The police thought he was insane. They let me come here to see if I could find anything. The first item is a diary. It didn't say anything about him. It's about you. What time you left the house, where you went, what restaurants you had your lunch in, what time your speaking engagements were. The last entry says that he was supposed to have met you in Bishop's Park. And that was dated the day he died. The important items are here. If we're to get to the bottom of this, we've got to start here. This first clipping is from the Astrologer's Monthly. Reports an unusual phenomenon. A comet changed its shape into a glowing star, like the star of Bethlehem 2,000 years ago. This one was on the other side of the world, the European continent, five years ago. 6 June, to be exact. Does that date mean anything to you? Yes. Then you'll recollect this other clipping. It's a birth announcement from a Rome newspaper. Also dated 6 June, five years ago. The day your son was born. The sixth month, sixth day. Was your son born at 6am? Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out this birthmark. The three sixes. My son is dead. I don't know whose son I'm raising. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to help you try and find out. No. It's my problem. No, sir, you're wrong. It's my problem too. When I came here with the police, I took some photographs. I happened to catch sight of my own reflection in that mirror. I know you must think I'm crazy, but I'm so frightened. Don't be afraid. You'll be all right here. You'll be perfectly all right. Some all right! - What about Damien? - I'll speak to Mrs Horton. She'll look after him. Mrs Horton? - Mrs Baylock. - Sir. - Where's Mrs Horton? - Gone. - Gone out? - No, they've gone. They just got up and went. They left an address for you to send their last month's wages to. Well, didn't Mrs Horton say anything? Didn't Horton leave any explanation? No. But don't worry, sir. I can manage. - I'll look into this when I get back. - Just as you wish, sir. - And Mrs Baylock? - Sir? Last night, I saw that dog in Damien's room. I clearly told you... He's gone now, sir. They took him away this morning. No. This is the right address. Apparently, there was a terrible fire and the old hospital burned down. Five years ago. OK. But surely the fire didn't destroy everything. There must have been some records. I sorry. I think everything was destroyed. Isn't it possible there were some papers stored elsewhere? - I do not know. - Sister. This is most important to me. I adopted a child here. I'm searching for some records of it... - There were no adoptions here. - There was one. - No, signore. - It wasn't an actual adoption. - You are mistake. - Wait. Birth records. If I gave you a date. An exact date. It's no use. The fire started in the hall of records in the basement. All the paperwork was there. Went up like a torch. Shot up the stairwells. The third floor became an inferno. - The third floor? - The maternity wards. Nothing left but ashes. - You will excuse me? - What about the staff? - Surely some survived. - S, some. There was a tall man, a priest. Dark eyes. Piercing eyes. Yes. - He was principale. - Yes, he was in charge. Is he... - Yes, he is alive. - Is he here? - No. - Where? He's in a monastero in Frosinone. Many were taken there. Many die. Perhaps he is die since, but he lived through the fire. I remember people say it was un miracolo. Frosinone? - Here we are. - What is it? - ""When the Jews return to Zion..."" - That's the poem. ""When the Jews return to Zion..."" And there was something about a comet. Yes, that's here too. ""The shower of stars and the rise of the Roman Empire."" These are supposed to be the events that signal the birth of the Antichrist. The devil's child. It's making more sense. The Jews have returned to Zion and there has been a comet. As for the rise of the Roman Empire, scholars think that could well mean the Common Market, the Treaty of Rome. - Bit of a stretch. - What about this? In Revelations it says: - ""He shall rise from the eternal sea."" - That's the poem again. ""From the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore."" - That was the beginning of it. - Theologians have interpreted the ""eternal sea"" as meaning the world of politics, the sea that constantly rages with turmoil and revolution. So the devil's child will rise from the world of politics. Looks like this is as far as we go. Let's have a look. Found him? His mind is active, but since the fire he's not made a sound. We feed him and take care of his needs. And we pray for his recovery when his penance is completed. What penance? ""Woe to the shepherd who abandons his sheep."" ""May his right arm wither and his right eye lose its sight."" He's fallen from grace. Can you tell us why? For abandoning Christ. - How do you know he's abandoned Christ? - He told us. - But he doesn't speak. - There is some movement in his left hand. He was able to write it down. You will notice the curved line over the head. This indicates the hood of the monk. His own hood. - The three sixes. - Six is the sign of the devil. - But why three of them? - We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity. - The devil, Antichrist and false prophet. - Father, Son and Holy Ghost. For everything holy, there is something unholy. This is the essence of temptation. Father Spiletto, my name is Thorn. There was a child. I want to know where that child came from. - I am afraid that... - You confessed to them. Now confess to me. - What happened? - Please, signore. You said you knew its mother. Where is she now? - I must insist that you do not... - I beg you, where is she? Answer me. Answer. Excuse me. Cervet. Please, does it mean something to you? Cerveteri. It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times. Cripta Sant'Angelo. - It is nothing but ruins. - Where is this place? - But there is nothing there. Only graves. - Where is it? You will find it on the map. It is perhaps 50km north of Rome. Robert, over here. Maria Scianna. My God. June 6. Five years ago. Bambino Scianna. Infant boy. Same date. ""In birth and death, the generations embrace."" Is my son buried here? This woman could be the mother of the child you adopted. Why here in this terrible place? - No. - Oh, my God. - The other one. - No. Let's get out of here. If it's an animal too, then maybe my child is alive somewhere. They murdered him. They murdered him as soon as he was born. Murderers. Murderers. Come on. Robert. Don't run. It's only the smell of the graves. Run. Robert. - Hello? - Hello. Kathy? Hello, Robert. Is that you? I'm so glad you called. Kathy, darling. Now, listen to me very carefully. Do just what I say. I want you to leave London right now. - What do you mean, leave London, darling? - I've put through a call to the embassy. Tom Portman will meet you at the hospital and bring you here to Rome. - Robert, what's happened? What's wrong? - Please, darling. Just do it. Get ready to leave. - Robert, I don't think I can move very well. - Kathy, do it. OK. Yes, all right, I'll try to be ready by the time he gets here. All right, darling. Who is that? Is that somebody there? Tom? Is that you? Yes? Yes, this is he. Tom? Kathy? Tom, I can't talk now. Robert. I found out about the town of Megiddo. It's derived from the word ""Armageddon"". The end of the world. It's underground, about 60 miles south of Jerusalem. There's some excavation going on there. If only you could remember the name of the man you're supposed to see. It's Bugenhagen. He was an exorcist. I read about him. That was his name. And I remember the poem. ""When the Jews return to Zion, and a comet fills the sky and the Holy Roman Empire rises, then you and I must die."" ""From the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore turning man against his brother till man exists no more."" Kathy is dead. I want Damien to die, too. Hello, Mr Thorn. I am Bugenhagen. - What is this place? - The city of Jezreel. Town of Megiddo. The place where Christianity began. The little priest - is he dead yet? Yes. Yes. Come along, Mr Thorn. We had better get to work. You will excuse us. This is for Mr Thorn alone. All right. It must be done on hallowed ground. A church. His blood must be spilled on the altar of God. This first knife is most important. It extinguishes physical life and forms the center of the cross. The subsequent placings extinguish spiritual life and should radiate outward. Like this. This is not a human child. Make no mistake. - Is there proof? - Oh, yes. He bears a birthmark. A sequence of sixes. So, says the Bible, do all the apostles of Satan. - He doesn't have it. - He must have it. I've bathed him. I know every inch of him. If it is not visible on the body, it will be beneath the hair. Remove it. You must be devoid of pity. - And the woman? - She is an apostate of hell. She will die before permitting this. Look, I want to know what he said. I've a right to know. Robert, I want to know what he said. Look, I'm notjust some bystander. - I was the one that found him. - I'm the one that's supposed to kill him. These are knives. He wants me to stab him. - Wants me to murder a child. - It's not a child. How can he know that? Maybe he's wrong. It's insane. I won't have anything to do with murdering a little boy. He's not responsible. I won't do it. Well, if you don't do it, I will. No! Run, Damien. Run. Run. No! Hold it. - Panda Four to control. - MP to Panda Four, come in, please. Panda Four in pursuit. American Ambassador, white estate car. Heading north. Seven Hills Road. Over. Al. We've got a shout. I'll be back later, all right? MP to Zulu Seven. You are requested assist Panda Four in pursuit of white estate car, north Seven Hills Road. Possible diplomatic incident. Zulu Seven to Panda Four. We have taken over your pursuit. Over. Zulu Seven to MP. Heading west on Old Church Road. No! Please, Daddy, no! - No, Daddy. No! - God help me. Police! Drop. Drop, or I'll fire. And so to their final rest do we commit these two and entrust them unto our Lord. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Detail, attention. Present arms. Ready, aim, fire. Ready, aim, fire. Ready, aim, fire. Excuse me, Mr President. When you're ready to leave, your car is over there. - In a moment. - Yes, sir. Visiontext subtitles: Sally Lewis US ENGLISH, When I was 15, and my family came to the island for the summer...  ... there weren't nearly as many houses or people as there are now.  The geography of the island and the singularity of the sea...  ... were far more noticeable then.  And if a guy wasn't to die of loneliness, his family made certain...  ... that other families from his neighborhood contributed other kids to the island.  Look out, Hermie. Look out. Present with me in the summer of '42...  ... were Oscy, my best friend.  And Benjie, my next to best friend.  We called ourselves ""The Terrible Trio. "" And that house up there...  ... that was her house.  And nothing, from that first day I saw her...  ... and no one that has happened to me since...  ... has ever been as frightening and as confusing.  For no person I've ever known...  ... has ever done more to make me feeI more sure...  ... more insecure...  ... more important...  ... and less significant.  He's gonna take her right into that bedroom. He better put the wood down first. Funny. Hey, come on! Oscy, for Christ's sakes! Hey, come on, Hermie. Will you move your ass, please? Give it back, Oscy! Boy, I'd like to feel every one of those girls. You know, I should've tripped on them. They'd never know I was getting a feel. That's not the way to do it. So what is the way to do it? You have to say things. All right, so I'll say, ''Excuse me. '' You know what I mean. You just can't go up to a girl and fall on her. - It isn't done. - Why not? I did it with Gladys Potter. She was only 12 years old. What did she know? I don't know. She didn't seem to mind though. Well, she was surprised. Hell, so was I. She had nothing to feel. Come on, Benjie, stop dragging. I don't know what's gonna become of him. He has no emotions. He's just confused. Yeah. So am I. I've been waking up lately, in the middle of the night. A lot. Yeah, that's okay. I do, too. - You do? - Yeah. I wake up feeling crazy and thinking about Vera Miller. - So what? - So, I hate Vera Miller. Jesus! You think I'm in love with her? I don't know. I hope I'm not in love with her. I hate her! What kind of thoughts do you have about her? Well, I forget. - Then how can I help you? - Who the hell is asking you to help me? - What are you guys talking about? - Nothing you'd understand. Screw you! Yeah, that's your whole problem, Benjie. You're only interested in screwing me. - Why don't you try screwing a girl? - Okay. ''Okay,'' he says. Boy, that's something. - You wouldn't know the first thing to do. - I would so! Okay, what's the first thing you do? You feel them. Wrong! You kiss them. We didn't kiss Gladys Potter. We weren't in love with Gladys Potter. If you're in love with a girl, you're supposed to kiss her first. - Ain't that right, Hermie? - It's polite. It's not required. It's required, you ninny! It is not! How do you know? Because I found a book. If my mother knew I took that book...  It doesn't belong to me. It doesn't belong to my mother. It belongs to the house. If you guys get your fingerprints on those pages, it's your funeral. My mother's gonna miss that book! It's the biggest on the shelf. Ten books fell when I pulled it out. - Hold it! - Will you hurry up? Kill me. I don't read as fast as you do. Okay, turn. Jesus! Do you believe all this stuff?. It's a medical journal. Why should they lie? How do they take pictures like that? - They must have special cameras. - What drugstores would develop them? If we took film like that to Sanders, we'd be put in a reform school. I guess they develop them themselves. Yeah, I guess that's what they do. - Let me look. - Go away. You'll foam at the mouth. - It's my book. - Come on, let him look. There, they're doing it! - I don't believe it. - You'd better believe it. One day your turn will come and you'd better know what to do. I don't believe it. My mother and father never did that! - Never. - Why not? Because it's stupid! I hate to break the news, but that's the way it's done. You better stop pushing me around. It could be dangerous. It could. Benjie, if you just look at the pictures, it does look dumb. But if two people are in love, it's supposed to be very pleasant. How do you know? You've never done it! Well, it's right here in the book. In black and white and color. That's why people kiss first. It gives them a chance to know each other. Once they get to know each other, they fall in love, then they make love. Foreplay! It's called foreplay. Everyone takes off their clothes and they play foreplay. Then he does this and she does this, and he does this. And before you know it, they're screwing! Now what could be simpler than that? Now, listen, before I saw these pictures, I didn't think it was possible either. But these are pictures, Benjie, pictures! These aren't drawings. I've seen those drawings. These are pictures! In an emergency, it could mount... ...350 caliber jobs. Probably handle about... ...a dozen or so depth charges. It'd sink if it hit a fish. Stripped down it could do 30 or 40 knots. Thirty or 40 knots? Thirty or 40 knots straight down. Yeah, yeah. Two, three, four, five...  One, two, three, four, five...  Sixty-nine, seventy. I wish somebody would invade this dopey island. I'm going mad! Hey, Oscy, it's that lady again. Hermie, you're not gonna go into another deathlike trance again, are you? I swear, Hermie, I don't know what's come over you. That's a very old person over there. I don't see the attraction. Maybe it's her mind. Maybe their minds meet and say, ''Hello. '' Why don't you go and say hello to her mind, Hermie? Go on, go say hello. Cut it out. Come on. If she's the love of your life, go say hello to her. Come on, we want to see you go say hello. Maybe you're some kind of a hotshot lover we don't know about. - Cut it out! - Say hello. - Knock it off! - Come on! Come on. Go say hello to her, Hermie. - Go say hello to her. - Yeah, go say hello. Come on, we want to see you go say hello. Hey, lady in the pink suit! It's Hermie the rape artist! It's Jack the Ripper! It's Herman the German, Nazi spy! - It's a sex fiend! - It's Hermie the rape artist! Goddamn! Oscy, I'll...  Hey, come on, Herm. Come on. We were only kidding. Hermie, it was a joke! Look out, Oscy! Look out! Knock it off, Hermie! Knock it off! Cut it out! Now I'm gonna let you go, okay? Okay, now, I'll let you go. Goddamn it, Hermie! You're really crazy! You're really crazy, you know that? Crazy! Jesus. It's enough, goddamn it! Enough! Son of a bitch! Jesus! Jesus, Oscy, you killed him. Oh, shit! Hey, leave him alone, Benjie. Leave him alone! The son of a bitch threw sand in my face. - Goddamn it, I mean...  - We'll see you later, Hermie, okay? Bastards! - Hermie, where're you going? - The Planet Mongo. - It's not even 8:00! - I can't do anything about that! - What did you have for breakfast? - An elephant! - Bring me back a newspaper. - Okay. And a Time magazine for your father! Jesus! May I offer some assistance? Oh, yes, you may. I really didn't expect to buy so much. I should have brought my wagon. - Yeah, you should've brought your wagon. - Yes. - What you really need is a wagon. - I think you're right. I can take one. No, it's okay. It's okay. If you take some and I take some, I think we can manage. - I'll be happy to pay you. - No, I wouldn't think of it. Really. My house is a pretty long walk. - I know where it is. - You do? Yeah. It's that way. - Are you sure it's okay? - Yeah, it's okay. - Well, won't you let me take one? - No, no. - Do you live on the island? - In the summer. - With your family? - Yeah. But they don't bother me. I pretty much go my own way. Aren't they pretty? - Oh, yeah. - I couldn't resist. I got a 12-page letter today! - That's nice. - It sure is. Hey, Hermie! Somebody called you. Not me. Is your name Hermie? Yeah. Well, somebody back there called you. No, not me. Well, he called Hermie. Well, Hermie is a pretty common name. This is it. I can go further. There's really no need. Okay. - Oh, can you bring them in? - Sure. Hang on. Got it. - In there, in the kitchen. - Okay. You can put them on the table. - They should make these bags stronger. - I think you're right. - Please let me give you some money. - I wouldn't think of it. Well, how can I repay you? It's okay, really. I'm gonna have some coffee. Would you like some? Sure. Great. Sit down. These are marvelous doughnuts. Help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes. You drink coffee, don't you? I consume a couple of cups a day. - Well, I have milk. - Oh, no, I take it black. - Are you in high school? - I'm a sophomore. I thought you were older. Next year I'll be a junior. And so on. Now, don't be in too big a hurry. You can end up in the Army before you know it. Well, I'm prepared to go. I'm taking preflight courses in high school, and I guess I'll get my wings. And maybe I can team up with my brother. He's a paratrooper. And maybe I can drop him out. So, your brother is a paratrooper? But, mostly, I have a sister in high school. Coffee is ready. I hope it's all right. It's from this morning. It looks fine. I have a little bit of sugar. Would you like some? No, no thanks. I'll take it black. I forgot to tell you. It's awfully hot. Are you all right? Let me get you some milk. Do you think I could have a glass of ice water? Why don't I put the ice in your coffee. You like ice coffee? - Sure. Great. - I'm sorry. - Are you all right? - It's okay. I'm really sorry. Do you have many friends on the island? Two. But they're immature, you know. What do you do to keep yourself busy? Well, I lean toward basketball. But I think there's a lot to be said for baseball. At least in baseball you don't get round-shouldered from dribbling. No, that's true. - Do you like music? - Yeah, I'm quite musical. Do you play an instrument? I sing. Well, I think a voice is like an instrument. I do, too. And then for a change, you can always whistle. I can see that. - You'll like those. - They're good. - I think I'll be going. - Do you have to go? - Yes, I really think I should. - Wait. Here, take the rest of the doughnuts. Seems the least I can do. - Thank you very much. - No, I thank you. You're welcome. It was a privilege. Next time I'll be sure to take my wagon. I think you should. You could get a hernia. Goodbye, Hermie. And thanks again. Goodbye. And you're welcome. Perhaps I'll see you again some time. It would be a privilege. Goodbye. Hernia! Jesus! Hermie! Wait a minute. Hermie, hold on. - Hi. - You were in there a long time. You could've brought those bags in and be out in 10 seconds. What happened? - We had drinks. - You're kidding? They had drinks. - Big deal. - She let you get funny? You're a dope. Come on, an older woman like that, what's a little feel to her? - She let you have a feel, Hermie? - She gave me some doughnuts. Probably stinks from perfume. Grow up! Come on, will you tell us what happened in there all that time? I wasn't aware of the time. It flew quickly. Boy, I'm telling you, I'd like to give her a feel. I thought you were mature, Oscy. It's very mature to feel girls. My brother does it all the time. How come he's a dentist? Don't get to be such a big shot all of the sudden. Don't try to tell us something went on in there. I ain't trying to tell you anything. Which is exactly the same as telling us a lot went on in there. A lot! Screw you! I ain't gonna tell you that something happened if it didn't. Nothing happened! If you believe something happened, then I'm sorry, because nothing happened. - Jesus! I don't even know her name! - You expect us to believe that? I don't care what you believe! I'm going home. My father is waiting for his newspaper and his Time magazine. Going home? Yeah, I'm going home! A few things to think over. Going home. - Well, what are you gonna do later? - Gonna kill myself! - No, after that? - I don't know, Oscy, I don't know! Hernia! Jesus! Good evening. Fine night for an evening of movies. Are you old enough to be up this late? I have two charming friends. You have ice cream on your face. That perfume! I grow dizzy. My friends and I would like you three ladies to join us in the movies. Dutch treat, I suppose. Yeah. But, we'll spring for refreshments. - Where are they? - It's those two rascals over there. - Where? - Over there. Smile. Look older. Here, come on. They're coming this way. - What's your name? - Oscy. - Don't panic. - I'm sweating. Don't sweat! This is Hermie and this is Benjie. And this is Miriam. This is Aggie and this is Gloria. Let's see. Hermie, you're with Aggie because you're both intellectual. Benjie, you're with Gloria, because. I have to go home. - If Gloria doesn't go, we don't go. - Benjie! - It's not important that I go. - Don't be silly! I'm not being silly, I don't want to go. - Well, then we won't go. - Go without her. - She's our friend. We stick together. - Go without me. - She wants you to go without her. - She doesn't. - She does! - She does not! She left. Now, come on, let's get in line. The night is still young. I don't want to miss the cartoon. - Hello. - Hi. Then we each want a 15-cent candy. Sure, okay. Fifteen cents. That's the last time I ever do anything for Benjie. He's too young. It's beyond him. Christ, he almost screwed up the whole arrangement. - I got bad news. - What? You have to lend me a dime. Here's a nickel. Hold on, I got some pennies. Catch the boobs on Miriam. You catch them. She throws them, I'll catch them. I'll be ready. Those boobs come at me, I'll be there to catch them. Hermie. Hi. Hi, there. - Going to the movies? - Yeah. That's nice. Good to see you. - She really knows you. - Jesus, it's embarrassing. - What? - Her, seeing me with that. Hermie, excuse me. Do you think you could come by my house Thursday afternoon? I have some heavy things to move and I'll need some help. - Sure! Okay. - Great. Maybe Thursday morning would be better. About 10:00? Is that all right? - Sure. We'll have coffee. - Yes. You like it black, right? - Yeah, right. - See you Thursday. Enjoy the picture. - Hey, you're in. - Shut up! You're in, boy. I can't believe it. She's mad about you. Coffee at 10:00. Shit. Will you shut up? I'm all excited. I'm gonna squeeze the crap out of Miriam, soon as the lights go out. You're really something. You can't even wait till the cartoon is over. I can't wait. I can't wait! Silly name, isn't it? My father named me after a professor he was fond of.  I was J.D. in college and my wife calls me J. Duveaux.  But I'm Jerry to my friends.  And now, won't you tell me who you are? My name is Vale. V-a-I-e.  If it ever appears on the passenger list, it will be C. Vale.  Stop it! - Are you one of the Vales of Boston? - One of the lesser ones.  Well, which one? I don't even know yet whether it's Miss or Mrs.  It's Aunt.  Every family has one, you know.  But Aunt what? My name is Charlotte Vale.  Miss Charlotte Vale.  It was like a miracle happening.  Like having your child.  - Stop it! - All right. I even allowed myself to indulge in the fantasy...  ... that both of us loving her, and doing what was best for her together...  ... would make her seem actually like our child after awhile.  But I see no such fantasy has occurred to you.  Again, I've been a big sentimentaI fooI. It's a tendency I have.  Wait a minute.  I was afraid you were keeping Tina out of pity.  But there was no note of pity in your ridicule of me just now.  I know you still love me, and it won't die, what's between us.  Do what you will: ignore it, neglect it, starve it.  Stop it! It's stronger than both of us together.  Please, let me go.  Charlotte.  Please, let me go.  Jerry? Dr. Jaquith knows about us.  When he said I could take Tina, he said, ""You're on probation. "" Do you know what that means? It means that I am on probation because of you and me.  He allowed this visit as a test.  If I can't stand such tests...  ... I'll lose Tina.  Then we'll lose each other.  Jerry, please help me.  Shall we just have a cigarette on it? Yes.  May I sometimes come here? Whenever you like. It's your home, too.  There are people here who love you.  To look at you and Tina, see everything peace and contentment.  Of course. And just think, it won't be for this time only.  That is if you will help me keep what we have.  We'll both try hard to protect that little strip of territory that's ours.  We can talk about your child.  Our child.  Thank you.  And will you be happy, Charlotte? Jerry, don't let ask for the moon.  We have the stars.  Where do you live? That's off the point. - Let's go to the beach and watch the surf. - No, it's late. We really have to go. Come on. No! But maybe we'll see you on the beach tomorrow. - Will you be on the beach tomorrow? - Ain't gonna be on a mountain. Well, then we'll see you. 'Bye. Yeah, 'bye. Come on. - How did you make out? - Pretty good. - What did you do? - I held her breast. - You didn't? - For almost 11 minutes. Fantastic! - Eleven full minutes. - You timed it! The longest I ever got was eight minutes with Lila Harrison. - So, you broke your record! - By three minutes. What did it feel like? What'd you mean, what'd it feel like? It felt like a breast. Didn't it feel like an arm? An arm? - No, it felt like a breast. - Come on, I bet it felt like an arm. - Why the hell should it feel like an arm? - Because it was an arm. Now, what's the matter with you, Oscy? You were feeling her arm. I was looking. That's what I was trying to tell you. You were squeezing an arm for 11 minutes, you schmuck. So the eight minute record with Lila Harrison still stands. - God damn it, Oscy, you're lying! - I wouldn't lie about an arm, Hermie. An arm? Jesus, I was passing out and it was an arm. A very lovely arm. - Well, you're a son of a bitch! - What? - Son of a bitch! Why did you tell me? - What? - Why not just let me think it was a breast? - I thought you should know the truth. I thought you should know so you won't make that mistake again. You wanted to ruin my memory of it, you son of a bitch! The hell! What do I care if you spend your whole life squeezing arms? I just thought you ought to face reality. Especially if you're putting a clock on it and going for records. I guess you're right. God, how can I ever face her again? Make sure she's wearing long sleeves. An arm. An 11-minute arm! Lila Harrison, your record is safe! Lila Harrison. Jesus! Nothing is too heavy when love is in the air. Laughter becomes you. Coffee is exquisite. Exquisite. - Is that you, Hermie? - It is I. Come on in. The door is open. I'll be out in a minute. Why don't you sit down? I certainly will. Shall. Well...  Hi. We'll have the coffee later, all right? Okay. - Your coffee is exquisite. - Thank you. I hope it wasn't an inconvenience for you to come by like this. No, it's okay. - What's up there? - Dust. - May I see? - Sure. There's lots of room. We shouldn't have any trouble. Thank you. You're right. There's lots of dust up there. Laughter becomes you. The best thing for me to do is hand you the boxes one at a time, don't you think? Yeah, okay. How are you doing? Fine. Hermie, what's wrong? Are you all right? Yeah. Well, your leg is shaking. I don't think your ladder is too good. Do you want me to hold it? I think you better hand me another box. Just two more. That's it. Come on down. Good job. Look, this time you really must let me give you some money. - No, I couldn't take any money. - But you have to! I couldn't possibly have gotten those boxes up there myself. It's okay. I like you. That's very sweet of you, Hermie. I like you, too. I mean, I don't like many people. Hermie! Hey, Hermie! Come on! Come on, will you, hurry up? Get up here, come on. What happened? - Nothing. - What went on in there all that time? Nothing. Come on, try to remember. What happened? Well, the way it went, we went in and we chatted. Yeah? And than I put the boxes in the attic. - And then she kissed me. - Kissed you? Yeah, right here. See any lipstick? Jesus! He's right. Lipstick! - That's blood. It's a mosquito bite. - No, it's lipstick. - That's definitely lipstick! - Look, Oscy, I like her kissing me, not you. It's blood. She's a goddamn vampire! As I left, I'm sure she asked me to come back. Any time. You know, Hermie, I really think you've struck gold. I really do. - Benjie! We're gonna need the book again. - You can just whistle. You drooled all over it. I don't want to get blamed for any warped pages. My glasses for the book. You'll have loads of fun identifying enemy aircraft over the island. - You'll be a hero! - Nothing flies over this island except birds! - Maybe they're enemies. - Jesus Christ, no go! It's a fair swap. What's more, you can have the glasses for two days. I only need the book for one afternoon. If you don't like my offer, I'll break your nose. - Come on, Oscy. - Come on, Hermie! Christ! In the name of the USA, I award you these field glasses. Good hunting. Benjie, come on, hurry up. Hurry up, Benjie. Come on. Come on, hurry up. Come on. Now, Backstage Wife. The beloved story of Mary Noble.  Now Mary Noble, war wife.  Her husband Larry, former Broadway star, now Lieutenant Noble of the Coast Guard...  Come on. ... somewhere in the South Pacific.  If you recall, when we last heard from Larry, he and a lone companion...  ... Bosun's Mate Smith, were stranded on an enemy infested island...  ... after their rubber boat had been wrecked in a squall.  Come on. - Mrs. Larson didn't.  - She didn't, but now she does.  Yes, now she does use Duz.  Now Mrs. Larson knows Duz.  D-u-z does everything in her wash.  She's convinced this new kind of soap is best.  Why, it's even improved her disposition.  She used to be a crosspatch on washday.  - Watch that step. - Okay, okay. She's twice as sunny.  You wouldn't dirty up so many towels if you had to wash them.  I know your rayon undies don't look bright anymore...  Come on. Ah, but then Mrs. Larson started using Duz instead of...  Hermie, I just cleaned in there. Goddamn it! - Where's the paper? - It's in the drawer. I found it. Where's the carbon paper? In there! What are you doing? Making two copies. One for me and one for you. You can keep it with you at all times, and refer to it and learn it. What for? You can't call on your lady with a book under your arm... ...so I'm condensing it. Point by point. Stay close to this and you'll do okay. You know, Oscy, I'm troubled. I think I have a deep feeling for her. So what? Well, so I don't want to just lay her. I respect her. There's something you have to understand. It's all right to respect a lady. But, she's won't respect you if you don't try to lay her. I don't believe that. It's true! My brother told me. That's the way ladies are. They want you to try, even if they don't let you. Because even though they don't let you, they want you to. - I think I understand. - Good. Now you start memorizing. - This is crazy. - What? Point three. What's crazy about it? - I've never even heard of the word. - It's Latin. The original guys were Latins. - I wouldn't even know how to pronounce it. - You don't pronounce it, you just do it! I don't even know where it is! And what the hell is this in number four? That's Latin, too. It's all in Latin, Hermie. Jesus! Yeah? I may just have to ask her where some of these things are! They're all in approximately the same place. ''Seek and ye shall find. '' Besides, she's supposed to be helping you out. Well, I hope so because I'm gonna need all the help I can get. Point six, Hermie, very important. - Foreplay. - Right! That word keeps cropping up. I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. What do I say? ''How about a little foreplay?'' I told you. You don't have to say a word. Yeah? Point two definitely states that we're supposed to converse. Swell, but when you get to Point six, there's no more talking. Just moaning and sighing. Just moan and sigh. - Well, she'll think I'm sick. - No, she'll be moaning and sighing, too. It's gonna get pretty noisy. Boy. I got news on Miriam today. One of the lifeguards told me. Once she gets started, she's supposed to really be something. I'm home, Hermie, home! Look, Oscy, if I follow these 12 points, she just might have a kid. I can't afford a kid at this stage of my life. So the whole thing is off! I really can't believe it, Hermie. You are really dumb. I may be dumb, but I'm not gonna be a father! - Two wrongs don't make a right. - You use protection. You use a rubber. Haven't you ever heard of a rubber? - Yeah, of course I have. - All right, so that's what you use! I already have mine. When my brother went into the service, he willed it to me. I've been carrying it around ever since. It's my lucky charm. - How much do you want for it? - It's from my brother. It's a family heirloom. You have to get your own. Go to the drugstore. I'm not gonna risk it. I happen to be underage. Also, for information, Oscy, women shop in drugstores. So where do you want to get them? A sporting goods store? If you were a really good friend, you'd lend me yours. - What? - Well, I'll return it. Hermie, I'm beginning to think that maybe you're a homo. - Swell, Oscy, thanks a lot. - No, I mean, you don't know anything. A rubber's to be used once, and only once. And only by one party. Not even the best of friends can go half-sies on a rubber. - Just forget the whole damn thing. - I'm doing this for you, Hermie. I'm doing this out of friendship, because your time has come. Yeah? Let's forget it! I can't. It's all arranged. - What's arranged? - Marshmallow roast, on the beach tonight. Me and Miriam and you and Aggie. Don't try to get out of it, it's all set. - Here are your instructions. - I'm not interested in Aggie! You're not ready for the older lady. I have to sharpen you up on someone else. Aggie is all I got. - You know, Oscy, you're really crazy! - Yeah. Crazy, man! Sorry. Listen. I'm not asking you to get to Point 12 because I don't believe in miracles! I'll be happy if you get to Point two. - Now, all I want you to do is give it a try. - Forget it. I'm not sticking my neck out for Aggie. Jesus, Aggie! Tomorrow morning, you'll thank me. So, tonight, I'll bring the marshmallows and you bring a rubber. - Go on. - All right. Well, go on. Come on. Get in there. - Anything else? - Yes, a large bottle of cod liver oil. - Ma! - Shut up, it's good for you. It's $2.18. Thank you. Come again. - Move. - All right, all right. Move, move already. Can I help you? No. Just looking. Did you get them? - Not yet. - Well, go get them. There's a lady in there. Okay. Get going. Go on. - All right. - Go! Yes? It's me. The same guy as before. I just stepped outside for some air. Just what is it you're looking for? Maybe I can help you. I'll know when I find it. Maybe if you'd tell me what it is? I'll tell you. I just remembered. Well? A strawberry ice cream cone. All right, come with me. One dip or two? Better make it a triple. All right. That'll be 10 cents. There's something else I need. I just remembered. Well, what is it? Sprinkles. All right. Sprinkles. Here you go. Thanks a lot. That'll cost you 12 cents. Is there something else? Well, I hate to bother you, but...  Speak up, son. How about a napkin? All right. - Anything else? - How about some rubbers? Pardon? I understand that you carry them. Carry what? Come on, you know what. Contraceptives? Yeah. Right. And you want to buy some? Yeah. What for? Come on. You know what for. All right. What brand? - Brand? - Brand and style. - The usual. - Well, there's a number to choose from. Do you have to flash them around? Which is your usual? - The blue ones. - And how many would you like? Three dozen. You planning a big night? Just the usual. That'll be $12. - And 12 cents for the ice cream. Well, how much just for a dozen? And how many for $1? Three. - I'll take two. - They come three to a package. Can I just owe you for the ice cream cone, then? All right now, son. Fun is fun. - But how old are you? - Sixteen. How old? On my next birthday. What are you planning to do with these? Well, they're for my brother. He's older. Why can't he come in and get them for himself?. Well, he's sick. Well, then what does he need them for? For when he's feeling better. He's a Ranger. Do you know what these are used for? Sure. You fill them up with water, and then you throw them off the roof. Well, I just wanted to make sure you knew what they were for. Of course I know. My brother wouldn't send me in to buy them without telling me. We'll call it $1 even, including the ice cream. Okay. Thank you! - Hi, Hermie. - Hi, Aggie. I had a very nice time at the movie. - I'm sorry if I was rough on your arm. - That's all right. Is it healing well? It's okay, really. I'm looking forward to tonight. Oscy is outside. He's bringing the marshmallows. Yeah, I saw him. What are you bringing? I'll see you later Aggie, okay? - Tonight. 'Bye. - 'Bye. Can I toast you another tasty marshmallow? If you like, but... ...shouldn't we save a few for Oscy and Miriam? We may never see them again. They seem to be getting along very well. Yes, they're very friendly. Hermie. - Excuse me for a moment, please. - Sure. Thank you. Hi. Let me see your notes. Mine are all sweaty and crumpled. Hey, come on. Come on, fork over. - What number you up to? - Six. Six? Six is foreplay! You up to six? Yeah, but that crazy Miriam. She's up to nine! - You're kidding? - No, I'm not kidding. She's ruining my timing! Jesus Christ! How you doing with Aggie? - We're up to the marshmallows. - No time for gabbing, I got to go. - That was Oscy. - Yes. - Feel like another marshmallow? - What's that paper? This? It's a map. - A buried treasure? - Yeah. I think so. Can I see it? Why don't you just have another marshmallow? All right. Hermie. Hermie! - Would you excuse me again? - Yes. You're very kind. - What? - Give me a rubber! - What happened to your heirloom? - It was spoiled. I guess they don't keep. Come on, for Pete's sake! Come on, it's cold. Don't you even say thank you? Thank you, Hermie. Why did Miriam say, ''Thank you''? - Because she's a lady. - Oh, I see. - See what? - Pardon? - You said you saw. What did you see? - Actually nothing. - Then don't say you see when you don't. - Okay. Need a rubber? I need a breather. I also need another rubber. Did you get to Point 12 yet? Twelve? We're so far past 12...  But, that's as far as the book goes. What's after 12? There's 13 and 14. Fifteen. Hermie, you have no idea. And 16, 17 and 18. I think Miriam and I should be getting home now. - I'll take you home, come on. - I think I'd better get Miriam. Hey, Aggie! No, I don't think so! Aggie, I'll take you home. Hi. Hermie, hi. - How have you been? - Fine, thank you. And you? - Pretty good. - Good. What a beautiful morning! Should be a really nice day. How are the boxes we put away? Any trouble? No. They're fine. Still up there. I think they'll be all right. I'd ask you to the movies, but it's the same picture. Like to see it again? No. No thanks. I don't blame you. Once you know the ending, it kills the thrill. Tide is coming in. So it is. Have you any other heavy objects you want moved? No, none that occur to me. If you can think of any, feel free. All right, I will. Thank you. Will you be at home tonight? Pardon? Well, I thought I might drop by. I have to be in the neighborhood. Feel free to drop by. I'm not saying I can come for sure, so don't plan on it. It's getting late! I've got to get to the post office and get these letters off. - I'll run them down for you. - No, thanks. It's tricky postage, overseas. Thanks, anyway. Hello! I don't even know your name. Dorothy. I had a cat named Dorothy. Got hit by a truck. 'Bye. Hi. - You know what? - What? It's all over. - What? - Me and Miriam. - What happened? - I'm embarrassed to tell you. - Then don't tell me. - You won't believe it. - After last night, I'll believe anything. - It's not what you think. - Oscy, I'm in kind of a hurry. - We had an argument this afternoon. And I went over to her house to apologize to her. She's got appendicitis. Took her over to the mainland. Hope they leave her there. - I hope they don't cut up her boobs. - I don't think the scar goes that far. She told me she was breaking our date. The next thing I know, appendicitis! Christ, she sure goes to extremes. They loaded her on the speedboat on a stretcher. Maybe it's all for the better. For the better? How can you say such a dumb thing? - Because I'm not really interested. - Bullshit! You're interested. You took yourself some long look at us last night. - We knew you were looking. - I only caught a glimpse. Will you shut up, Oscy? I don't want to hear your dirty details. - You don't want me to tell you? - I don't want to hear about it. - I was gonna tell you everything. - Don't! When you want to hear about it, I'm not gonna tell you. Good! Something's wrong with you. You're not normal. Good! - Going to her house? - Screw you. Got your instructions handy? It's not gonna be that kind of an evening. You wouldn't understand because you're so crass. Crass? What the hell is crass? - Leave me alone! - What the hell are you so mad about? - I don't know. - Got your rubbers? You're a regular comedian! You know what? I'm sorry I ever tried to help you! Well, that makes two of us. I gave up my binoculars to get you educated, goddamn it! - Tough! - Word's getting out on you, Hermie. You're a homo. If you don't cut it out, Oscy, you're gonna get a fat lip! Homo! Hello. Hello? Dorothy, it's Hermie. Hermie, from the beach. Hi, Hermie. Hi. I don't look very nice, do I? I think you do. I think I don't. I'm sorry. Good night, Hermie. Good night. Miriam pulled through. I talked to her mother this morning. Jesus, they didn't even operate. They froze her. I'm relieved about it. She's through for the summer. Won't be back on the island again. My first lay. Gone with the wind. Have you seen Benjie anywhere? That rat still has my glasses. You know, you shouldn't feel so bad, no matter what happened. And you don't have to tell me. But if you want to tell me, you can. But you don't have to unless you want to. Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass! I thought maybe we'd attack the Coast Guard station tonight. You know, give them a scare. Dear Hermie, I must go home now.  I'm sure you'll understand, there's much I have to do.  I won't try and explain what happened last night...  ... because I know that, in time...  ... you'll find a proper way in which to remember it.  What I will do is remember you, and I pray that...  ... you be spared all senseless tragedies.  I wish you good things, Hermie, only good things.  Always, Dorothy.  I was never to see her again.  Nor was I ever to learn what became of her.  We were different then, kids were different.  It took us longer to understand the things we felt.  Life is made up of small comings and goings...  ... and for everything we take with us, there is something that we leave behind.  In the summer of '42, we raided the Coast Guard station four times.  We saw five movies, and had nine days of rain.  Benjie broke his watch.  Oscy gave up the harmonica.  And in a very speciaI way...  ... I lost Hermie forever. , Captain wants you to keep 500 feet. Maneuvering, Control. Come in shallow to 500 feet. - Keep 500 feet. - Keep 500 feet, sir. What the hell's going on, Eddie? Emergency stations. Captain to the control room. - What's going on? - Number five bulkhead shut down. - Control, Maneuvering. - Control, Captain. I'm losing electrical frequency. I'll have to break down the system. Control, Sound Room. Total loss of power on all sonar sets. Surface. Blow forward, blow aft, full ahead. Full rise on both planes. Raise the search periscope. Oh, my God. Yeah, put him through. Good morning, sir. No, First Sea Lord. There's been no contact with Ranger yet, sir. No sightings, no distress signals, sir. It looks very much like it. Yes, of course I will, sir. We've lost one of our nuclear submarines. What? The submarine Potempkin disappeared without trace? What a catastrophe, Comrade Chairman. Yes, of course. I'll assign our best agent immediately. - Rubelvitch, where is Agent XXX? - On leave, General. At a people's rest and recuperation center. It's been a wonderful weekend. - I shall never forget it. - Nor will I. When can we meet again? As soon as my mission is accomplished. I must go. I have to be in Austria tonight. Five more minutes. Agent XXX. Calling Agent XXX. You will report to headquarters immediately. Agent XXX, acknowledge and verify. This is XXX. Message received and understood. Yes, Mr. Prime Minister. I understand the gravity of the situation. Yes, I'll put our best man on it at once. Good-bye. Moneypenny, where is 007? He's on a mission, sir, in Austria. Tell him to pull out, immediately. Oh, James, I cannot find the words. Let me try and enlarge your vocabulary. What's happened? - Where are you going? - Sorry, darling. Something came up. But, James, I need you. So does England. He has just left. Over and out. Message received. We are waiting. Over and out. Now. Nobody does it better Makes me feel sad for the rest Nobody does it Half as good as you Baby, you're the best I wasn't looking But somehow you found me I tried to hide from Your love light But like heaven above me The spy who loved me Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight And nobody does it better Though sometimes I wish Someone could Nobody does it Quite the way you do Why do you have to be so good The way that you hold me Whenever you hold me There's some kind of magic Inside you That keeps me from running But just keep it coming How'd you learn to do the things you do Baby, baby Baby, you're the best Send in Agent XXX. You sent for me, Comrade General. Good morning. Major Amasova, we are facing a most delicate situation. Our nuclear submarine Potempkin has disappeared. Sabotage? That is for you to find out. We have one lead: A connection in Cairo. You leave tonight. Will that be all? There is one more thing. I regret to inform you, Major, that Agent Sergei Borzov has been killed. On a mission at Berngarten in the Austrian Alps. A tragic occurrence, Comrade General. It had not escaped our notice that you and Agent Borzov... had been more than friends for some time. I'm very sorry. How did he die? We haven't all the details yet. It appears he'd become involved in a British Secret Service operation. Please keep me informed, Comrade General. I should very much like to meet... whoever was responsible for his death. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Good morning, 007. - Hello, Q. - Mission successful? - On and off. - Good morning, Commander. - Good morning, sir. - Captain Forsyth. - Sir. Commander Bond, sir. - Mr. Fredrick Gray, Minister of Defense. - Good morning, Commander. Admiral Hargreaves, Flag Officer, Submarines. - Ark Royal, wasn't it? - Yes, sir. - I believe M told you about this. - Yes, Minister. Over here, please, gentlemen. This, I take it, is Ranger's prearranged coastal patrol area. - That's right. - How many people knew this course? Admiral Hargreaves, myself... and Talbot, the submarine captain. Good God. Where did this come from? I'm sorry, Benson. For the moment, that's top secret. I see, sir. Commander, this tracing means... that the Russians can track our nuclear submarines underwater and sink them. - I believe it does. - How could they? It's impossible. It's quite simple. Heat signature recognition, most likely. - With your permission, Minister? - Yes, of course. Thank you. We already know that satellites with infrared heat sensors... can detect a nuclear missile in flight by its tail fire. Well? Someone can now locate a submerged nuclear submarine... in exactly the same way, by its wake. That means they can totally undermine our Western defense strategy. Yes, it looks like it. Where did we get that tracing, Freddie? Cairo, diplomatic bag. Somebody got the plans of that tracking system and is trying to sell them. They sent us that tracing as proof that it's genuine. Then, if there is a deal to be made, the price will be high. ""High""? Astronomical. That missing submarine had 16 Polaris missiles aboard. We have a contact in Egypt? M will give you the details. You leave tonight. Dr. Bechmann and Professor Markovitz. Thank you. Gentlemen, now that the moment has come to bid you farewell... I congratulate both you, Doctor, and you, Professor... on your brilliant work in the development... of the submarine tracking system. Thanks primarily to you, I'm happy to say... that the first phase of our operation... has met with considerable success. I have instructed my assistant... to have paid into your... Swiss bank account... the sum of $10 million each. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, indeed. And that, I think, concludes our business. Before you go, however... I very much regret to inform you... that a dangerous development... has recently been brought to my notice. Someone has been attempting to sell the plans... of our tracking project... to competing world powers. Someone intimately associated with the project. My dear, it would be more seemly if you left us. Thank you. It was you who betrayed me. You had access to all the information. Now you will pay the penalty. Once again, gentlemen, my most profound thanks. - Sandor. - Yes, sir. Jaws. I'm assigning you the task... of recovering the microfilm copy... of the tracking system. Sandor, you will go with him. Obey him. Every person who even comes into contact with that microfilm... is to be eliminated. Stand by for helicopter takeoff. All personnel, clear the flight deck platform. Cancel transfer of $20 million. Inform next of kin that a tragic accident... has resulted in the death of Professor Markovitz... and Dr. Bechmann. The funeral was at sea. May the peace of Allah descend upon this magnificent abode... and allow a poor traveler to enter. May the hospitality of these miserable quarters... be sufficient to your honored needs. James Bond, what a delightful surprise after all these years. - Sit down. - Thank you. I always wondered what you were gonna do when you went down from Cambridge. I never had any problems knowing what you were going to do, Hosein. We don't only have oil, you know. What can I offer you? Sheep's eyes? Dates? - Vodka martini? - Information. Who is putting the submarine tracking system on the market? What a pity it is you insist on being so businesslike. The gentleman you will eventually be dealing with... is a certain Max Kalba. - ""Eventually""? - To reach Kalba... you must first make contact with a man called Fekkesh. Aziz Fekkesh. I'll give you his apartment address in Cairo. It's too late to meet him today. Can I persuade you to accept a bed for the night? That's kind of you, Hosein, but I really feel I... Are you quite sure I can't persuade you to stay the night? When one is in Egypt... one should delve deeply into its treasures. Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. The door was open. Mr. Fekkesh is expecting me. I phoned him. He asked me to give you a message. He will be late. May I ask where he is? Mr. Fekkesh asked me to entertain you while you are waiting. Really? Where is Fekkesh? You are very suspicious. I find I live much longer that way. Now where is he? If there's anything at all you would like... I had lunch, but I seem to have missed dessert. As urgent as my appointment is, I'd hate him to walk in and surprise us. There is no danger of that. He'll be some time then? Is he meeting someone? I'm sorry, I cannot answer that question. Oh, I think you can. Where's Fekkesh? Pyramids. What a helpful chap. You have come tonight to the most fabulous... and celebrated place in the world. Here on the Plateau of Giza stands forever... the mightiest of human achievements. No traveler, emperor, merchant or poet... has trodden on these sands... and not gasped in awe. The curtain of night is about to rise... and disclose the stage on which... the drama of a civilization took place. Those involved have been present since the dawn of history... pitched stubbornly against sand and wind. And the voice of the desert... has crossed the centuries. Excuse me, Major. I'll be back in a moment. With each new dawn, I see the sun god rise... on the far bank of the Nile. I am the faithful warden at the foot of his lord. So faithful, so vigilant... so near him... that he gave me his face for my own. I am a pharaoh's companion... and I am he, the pharaoh. This is the tomb of Cheops... Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty 4,500 years ago. Here is the Great Pyramid which he built... to defend himself against death. Here in the depths of his tomb... a servant of the king awaits the call... to set out upon his journey into eternity. Death lies waiting. Where is Fekkesh? With the pharaohs. - You killed him. - No, he was dead when I found him. Hope you enjoyed the show. Good night. What an unexpected pleasure. Welcome to the Mujaba Club. Buy you a drink, Major Amasova? Or may I call you XXX? You know who I am. You made quite an impression. I'm sorry about Ivan and Boris. They exceeded their orders. Good staff is hard to find these days. Yes, sir? The lady will have a Bacardi on the rocks. For the gentleman, vodka martini, shaken not stirred. Touche. Commander James Bond. Recruited to the British Secret Service from the Royal Navy. Licensed to kill, and has done so on numerous occasions. Many lady friends, but married only once. - Wife killed... - All right, you've made your point. You're sensitive. About certain things, yes. Now, if you'll excuse me. Tragically, I have a previous engagement. Happily enough, so do I. - Good-bye, Mr. Bond. - Let's say au revoir. I have the oddest feeling we'll be meeting again sometime. I'm looking for Mr. Kalba. Mr. Max Kalba is the owner of the club, sir. Over there. Mr. Kalba, my name is James Bond. What of it? You had an appointment with Mr. Fekkesh. - Well? - He won't be joining you. You have something I'm interested in buying. Just a moment. I would like to bid for it too. You forgot your drink. Thank you. It seems you have competition, Mr. Bond. From where I sit... I fancy you will find the lady's figure hard to match. Might the contestants be permitted to view the article for sale? Well, now, who will start the bidding? Mr. Kalba, sir, the telephone. An urgent call. Excuse me. Pardon me. This is Kalba. Hello? Another? We've really got to stop meeting like this. Kalba was called to the phone. What happened? He was cut off, permanently. Where is the microfilm? Search me. He must have it, or you wouldn't be here. You don't know who he is. - He's a professional killer. - Called Jaws? Make no mistake, Mr. Bond... I want that microfilm... and I'm going to get it. Unless I get it first. Watch out! Don't move. Give me the microfilm. Egyptian builders. Sorry. You're just too late. Give me the key! The key! Try the big one. Can you play any other tune? Let's try reverse. That's backwards. Would you like me to drive? Women drivers. Quiet. Watch this. Shaken, but not stirred. That gorilla must have his teeth fixed by a riveter. By the way, thanks for deserting me back there. Every woman for herself. Remember? Still, you did save my life. We all make mistakes, Mr. Bond. The cylinder head gasket. What did he say? He thinks we're overdressed, but he'll take us to Cairo. Good. It's getting cold. Is there anything I can do to warm you up? You don't have to worry about me. I went on a survival course in Siberia. Yes, I believe a great number of your countrymen do. What did they teach you? That it's very important to have a positive mental attitude. Nothing more practical than that? Food is also very important. What else? When necessary, shared bodily warmth. That's the part I like. Is this really what they do in Siberia? Yes, but not how they do it. You're not trying to take advantage of me, are you? The thought never crossed my mind. Just when it was getting interesting. Where's the girl? - Morning, Moneypenny. - Good morning, James. Is he in? It must have been quite a party. Boring. I dropped off. Hello, James. We've been expecting you. Good morning, sir. There's been a change in plan. You probably recognize my opposite number in the KGB, General Gogol. I believe you're familiar with Major Amasova. Enough to know which brand of cigarette she smokes. Our respective governments... agreed to pool their resources to find out what happened to our submarines. We have entered a new era... of Anglo-Soviet cooperation. As a sign of Russian good faith... I'm prepared to make available to you the microfilm... recovered by Agent XXX. With considerable ease, I might add. Don't bother. It's useless. I examined it on the boat. I assure you it is quite genuine. Except that the vital technical information has been taken out. This was only intended to whet our appetites. Maybe Q can make something out of it. I want that ready for Akmid's tea party. After you, Alexis. - After you, Miles. - Thank you. That could bring tears to your eyes. Everybody ready? Right. We're pretty certain that this drawing was drafted in Italy. The size corresponds with a Venetian octavo... and the typeface is an Italian one. Now, note the slight upward stress on the transversals. What's that mark there? Probably a show-through of something... the drawing was resting on when it was photographed. Must have been done in a hurry. - Can you enlarge it? - Wait a minute. - ""Oratory""? What is that? - It's another word for chapel. Looks a bit like a bishop's mitre. It is a fish. That is the symbol of the Stromberg Shipping Line. Karl Stromberg? He's one of the richest men in the world. One of the principle capitalist exploiters of the West, sir. So it's not ""oratory,"" it's laboratory. Stromberg has a marine research laboratory. On Corsica, I believe. Well done. Actually, it is in Sardinia. That's brilliant. I'm certain that two such perceptive talents... will enjoy working together in Sardinia... and that it will help to make Anglo-Soviet cooperation a reality. Here we are. That was a delicious meal. Thank you. I didn't realize you had such a healthy appetite. Neither did I. It must be traveling by train. I always enjoy it. I remember when... What do you remember? I was going to talk about a mission. Silly, isn't it? We can't talk, and yet we're in the same business. - But with rival companies. - We're not rivals at the moment. Then how about a nightcap, on the company? My company. I'm very sorry. I have an idea tomorrow is going to be a busy day. - I must sleep. - Yes. - Well, then, sleep well. - And you. Good night. What happened? He just dropped in for a quick bite. You're hurt. Later. Let's worry about you. What was it they taught you on that survival course? A positive mental attitude. And shared bodily warmth. Nothing about keeping out of drafts? Still enjoy traveling by train? You saved my life. Thank you, James. I'm sorry. Why don't you lie down and let me look at it? What can we use for a bandage? How about this? Wait a moment. - Good morning, Major Boothroyd. - Good morning, Major. Look what Q has brought for us. Isn't it nice? Right. Now pay attention, 007. Take great care of this equipment. There are some special accessories... - Have I ever let you down? - Frequently. You have a reservation for me. The name is Sterling. Yes. Mr. And Mrs. Sterling. Booked from Cairo. That's right. We have Suite A-5 for you; a sitting room and two bedrooms. Moneypenny being over-efficient. Do you have any messages for me? Thank you. Excellent. We have been granted an audience. - Mr. Sterling? - Yes. I'm Naomi. Mr. Stromberg sent me to collect you. How do you do? This is my wife... who also happens to be my assistant. - You are on holiday here? - Where there's an ocean... a marine biologist is never on holiday. Can we offer you a drink before we go? No, thank you. Mr. Stromberg's a very busy man. His time is precious. What a handsome craft. Such lovely lines. Thank you. Very impressive. I wonder if you'd mind showing my wife around... - while I'm with Mr. Stromberg. - Of course. - This way. - Thank you. Don't be a bother to Naomi, darling. - I'll be back soon. - By the way... Mr. Stromberg prefers not to shake hands. - It's the third button. - Thank you. Why do we seek to conquer space... when seven-tenths of our universe remains to be explored? The world beneath the sea. You seem to be well-equipped to repair that oversight. My name is Robert Sterling. It's very kind of you to receive me. It's always a pleasure to welcome someone with a mutual interest. An extraordinary number of rare species. You recognize that variety, of course. Of course. Other fish avoid it. Those dorsal spines are laden with venom. Handsome, but deadly. I see you know your subject. One tries. You have a remarkable establishment here. I'm somewhat of a recluse. I wish to conduct my life on my own terms... and in surroundings with which I can identify. That is a privilege of wealth. Don't you miss the outside world? For me, this is all the world. There's beauty... there's ugliness... and there is death. I think you will find this interesting. An underwater city. Fascinating, isn't it? The only hope for the future of mankind. We all have our dreams. No dream, Mr. Sterling. Soon a reality. I'm afraid you must excuse me. I have business to attend to. Good-bye. If we don't meet again, I wish you luck with your research. Thank you. The brief glimpse you've afforded me today... will only encourage me to redouble my efforts. Good-bye. - How interesting. - There you are. Darling, you should look at this model. It's beautiful. This is the Liparus... the latest addition to the Stromberg fleet. Launched nine months ago. At over a million tons, it's the largest tanker in the world. - After the Karl Marx, of course. - Really, darling? It's amazing the items of information you store away. Were they the two on the train? James Bond... and the woman is Major Amasova, a Russian agent. Let them get ashore... and then kill them. You're being very secretive. Where are we going? I want another look at that Stromberg laboratory. Do you think you could operate the tracking system from there? It's possible. All we know for sure is that two nuclear submarines are missing. What did you think of that tanker model? There was something strange about the design of her bows. I've asked M to check her out. - James, that motorcycle... - Has been following us for a mile. All those feathers and he still can't fly. Yes, I know. Don't tell me. You ever get the feeling somebody doesn't like you? Can you swim? It's time we said good-bye to an uninvited guest. Alone at last. That's what we've come to see. Brace yourself. Look! How did you know about that? I stole the blueprints of this car two years ago. Do you think we can make it? Hello. - I have a message for you. - I think you just delivered it. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt you... but I asked M for a list of all the ports... the Stromberg tanker had called at. What is the answer? In the nine months since she was fitted out... there is no record of her having put into port anywhere. That's very odd, if it's true. We don't make mistakes of that sort. You sound just like a Russian. I think we should take a closer look at that tanker, don't you? Yes, I do. Shall I contact Gogol? There's no need. - M has already offered to fix it. - Very nice. It's Austrian. I bought it in Berngarten. - I was doing some skiing. - When was this? About three weeks ago. Why? Do you recognize him? Who is he? The man I loved. He was in Berngarten three weeks ago. Did you kill him? When someone's behind you on skis at 40 miles an hour... trying to put a bullet in your back... you don't always have time to remember a face. In our business, people get killed. We both know that. So did he. It was either him or me. The answer to the question is yes. I did kill him. Then, when this mission is over... I will kill you. Come in. - Commander Carter? - That's right. Welcome aboard. Major. Have a seat. Can I get you something? Not for me, thank you. I don't know about the major. I'm sorry. I hadn't expected you to be a woman. Aboard this vessel, Commander, I am Major Amasova of the Russian Army. - Yeah, sure. - It's good of you to help us out. Got a couple cabins at your disposal. Thank you. Major, you're most welcome to use the shower in my quarters. You do not have to show me any special favors, Commander. All the same, I think it might be better if I did. From Com Sub Atlantic, sir. Right. What's the matter, sailor? You never see a major taking a shower before? Stand by for second observation on target. Up scope. Check. Target bearing. Mark. Range. Mark. Down scope. - One division in high power. - Range 6,200 yards, sir. Angle on the bow, port 50. Control, Torpedo Room. Boarding party ready, sir. Captain, sir, our best solution for the target is 120. Speed three knots. Officer of the deck, come right north. Maneuvering, make turns for 11 knots. Officer of the deck, aye, sir. Which bullet has my name on it? The first or the last? I have never failed on a mission, Commander. Any mission. In that case, Major... one of us is bound to end up gravely disappointed... because neither of the... Control, Maneuvering. We're losing electrical frequency. Control, Sonar. Total power supplies failure on all sets. - Surface! - Blow forward! Blow aft! Up scope. Stand by. Where the hell is she? She's right behind us. Impossible. Stand by on number two dock. Liparus crew, take up positions. Dock Officer to Operations. Mobilization crew entering dock area. Number two dock to Operations. Twenty-five meters to run. I say again. Operation Room to number two dock. Docking now complete. Disembarkation crew moving into position. S Ray program completed. Magnetic field shut down. All systems normal. Limpet speaker in position, sir. Commander, you have precisely two minutes... to open your hatches and surrender your ship. The alternative is extermination by cyanide gas. Well? There's no alternative. Now hear this. Your Captain speaking. Open all hatches and proceed quietly onto the casing. Hurry, Commander. I'm not renown for my patience. Okay, two ranks. Move it out. Stay close to me. We'll try and hide you. Our time is limited, Captain. - Commence operations forthwith. - Yes, sir. Attention all personnel. Stromberg crews One and Two... embark your submarines. Put the Americans in with the others, Captain. Remove the prisoners. Don't look up. You're on Candid Camera. Complete nuclear missile loading. Operations, Radar. No contacts within 25,000 meters. Bring those two prisoners here. Let's go. Come on now. Operations Room, Sonar. No contacts, no transmissions. Cease stable hold. You have certainly been persistent. Very well. Now your curiosity can be satisfied. Both crews aboard, sir. Missile onload completed. They have already been given their targets. At 12:00 noon, they will have reached firing positions. Within minutes, New York and Moscow... will cease to exist. Global destruction will follow. The new era will begin. Submarines One and Two... commence departure drill. All right, you've made your point. How much do you want? ""How much?"" Whatever do you mean, Mr. Bond? The price for not firing those nuclear missiles. You're deluded, Mr. Bond. I'm not interested in extortion. I intend to change the face of history. By destroying the world? By creating a world. A new and beautiful world beneath the sea. Today, civilization as we know it is corrupt and decadent. Inevitably, it will destroy itself. I'm merely accelerating the process. That does not justify mass murder. For that, Major... I will accept the judgment of posterity. Submarines ready for departure, sir. Open bow doors, Captain. Stromberg One... you are clear to proceed to sea. Stromberg Two, you are also clear to proceed to sea. Forward stern. Observe, Mr. Bond, the instruments of Armageddon. Put this man with the rest of the prisoners. The lady will be traveling to Atlantis with me. Farewell, Mr. Bond. That word has, I must admit... a welcome ring of permanency about it. Au revoir, Anya. Bring her. Get that man! Keep going. Call him over. - Where's your captain? - Here. Release the other crews, then make for the armory. Follow me, men. At the double. Come on. Let's go. Seal the operations room! You! Stand by over there! Help yourself to firearms! Grab a weapon. Come on, let's go. We've taken both sides of the lower dock area, but your captain's dead. We're still no closer to that control room. Leave it to me, sir. Andrews, James, Marchal, Purvis. Follow me. That armored plating must be inches thick. - We'll never get through it. - Let's get to the armory. - What do you reckon to find there? - A nuclear missile. A nuc... Hey, wait! This could take hours, sir. You got a date? No, sir. Now you are beautiful. I'm sorry if you feel less than comfortable... but you have a tendency to violence that must be controlled. - What is it? - I have to report, sir... a breakout by some of the prisoners. That is unfortunate, Captain. However, sir, we now have the situation under control. The operations room is quite impregnable. Then we must hope, Captain, that you will suffer no further mishap. All I need out of here is the detonator. James, are you sure you know what you're doing? There has to be a first time for everything. Blast. What's the problem? I mustn't touch any part of the impulse conductor circuit. This ring houses the impulse conductor circuit, sir. It's magnetic. I mustn't touch it with any part of the detonator. - What happens if you do? - It'll go off. - Get me a number six detonator. - Aye, aye, sir. - Number six, sir. - Thank you. Did you fix that 20-second fuse? Yes, sir. Here it is. Plastic explosive. Is everything proceeding according to plan? - Yes, sir. - Excellent. - Sir? - What is it? The monitors faded. Change the circuit. Cease fire! You're too late, Bond. Our submarines are already on station. In four minutes, the missiles will be launched. Can you work the printout transmission unit? Sure, but we've only got three minutes. If we can work out the position of those submarines, maybe we can reprogram them. - To do what? - To destroy each other. James! The globe! Pass the position of the first submarine to the second as their target. - And vice versa? - Exactly. Missile Control, this is the Captain. We have a change of target. New coordinates are 034285219. Missile Control, Captain. We have a new target. Everybody back on board the submarine! Pass it on! Come on! Let's go! Foster, get those lines cleared! Come on! Leaver, throw those guys a line! Get those block fenders cleared! Fore and aft! Get the submarine at diving stations! Control, Maneuvering. Reactor at half-power state. Ready to check telegraphs. All personnel, take up positions fast! - Get Roberts in the gyro unit. - Right. Come on! Move it! Stand by to revert to normal lighting. Come on, sailor. Get that hatch shut quick. - Torpedo Room, Control. - Torpedo Room. Load tube one with mark 46 torpedo. Open outer door on tube one. Select zero gyro angle. Outer door on tube one open. Match bearings and shoot. - Set. - Shoot. Torpedo running. Rudder amidships. Ahead two-thirds. Left seven degrees rudder. How far would you say? - About 10,000 yards, sir. - Commander. Close it. I just got this signal from the Pentagon. On instructions from the Security Council: ""Destroy Atlantis fast. "" What does ""fast"" mean? Battle stations five minutes. With torpedoes? Yes. He has Anya on there. - I know. I'm sorry. - I have to get her off. - How? - Can I have the equipment Q sent? Sure. Barton. That package for Commander Bond, bring it in quick. - I need an hour. - That comes from the top! Forty minutes! You're gonna get me court-martialed. One hour. Come in. I'll give you a hand. Good evening, Mr. Bond. I've been expecting you. Stay where you are. I'll send the elevator down for you. Good-bye, Mr. Bond. You did want me to drop in. - Where's Anya? - Well, well, well. A British agent in love with a Russian agent. Detente, indeed. Sit down, Mr. Bond. - Your time is running out. - Yours too, Mr. Bond. And faster than you think. You shot your bolt. Now it's my turn. How does that grab you? We're five minutes overdue, Captain. - Stromberg? - Dead. So are we unless we get out of here fast. Match bearings and shoot. Maybe I misjudged Stromberg. Any man who drinks Dom Perignon '52 can't be all bad. The mission is over, Commander. In my country, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request. Granted. Let's get out of these wet things. But, James, what would our superiors say? They'll never know. Lower the stern gate. - Is there danger of the bends? - We'll soon find out. - XXX. What are you doing? Keeping the British end up, sir., There's an old joke. Two elderly women are at a Catskill Mountain resort. One of 'em says, ""The food at this place is really terrible."" The other one says, ""Yeah, I know. And such small portions."" That's essentially how I feel about life. Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness. And it's all over much too quickly. The other important joke for me is one that's usually attributed to Groucho Marx. I think it appears originally in Freud's Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious. It goes like this - I'm paraphrasing. I would never wanna belong to any club... ...that would have someone like me for a member. That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women. Lately the strangest things have been going through my mind. Cos I turned 40, and I guess I'm going through a life crisis. I'm not worried about ageing. Although I'm balding slightly on top. That's about the worst you can say about me. I think I'm gonna get better as I get older. I think I'm gonna be the balding virile type... ...as opposed to, say, the distinguished grey, for instance. Unless I'm one of those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth... ...who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag... ...screaming about socialism. Annie and I broke up. And I still can't get my mind around that. I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind... ...examining my life, and trying to figure out - where did the screwup come? A year ago we were... in love, you know. And... It's funny... I'm not a morose type. I'm not a depressive character. I... I, uh... You know... I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess. I was brought up in Brooklyn during World War II. He's been depressed. All of a sudden he can't do anything. - Why are you depressed, Alvy? - Tell Dr Flicker. It's something he read. Something he read, uh? - The universe is expanding. - The universe is expanding? The universe is everything. If it's expanding, someday it will break apart... ...and that will be the end of everything. What is that your business? He stopped doing his homework. - What's the point? - What has the universe got to do with it? You're here in Brooklyn! Brooklyn is not expanding! It won't be expanding for billions of years yet, Alvy. And we've gotta try and enjoy ourselves while we're here, uh? Uh? Uh? My analyst says I exaggerate my childhood memories. But I was brought up under the roller coaster... ...in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous. I have a hyperactive imagination. My mind tends to jump around a little. I have some trouble between fantasy and reality. My father ran the bumper car concession. There he is. And there I am. I used to get my aggression out through those cars all the time. I remember the staff at our public school. We had a saying: ""Those who can't do, teach... ...and those who can't teach, teach gym."" And those who couldn't do anything, I think, were assigned to our school. I always thought my schoolmates were idiots. Melvyn Greenglass. His fat little face. And Henrietta Farrell. Just Miss Perfect all the time. And Ivan Ackerman. Always the wrong answer. Always. Seven and three is nine. Even then, I knew they were just jerks. In 1942 I had already discovered women. Ugh! He kissed me! He kissed me! Ugh! That's the second time this month! Step up here! Step up here! - What did I do? - You should be ashamed of yourself. Why? I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity. Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds. I did. For God's sakes, Alvy! Even Freud speaks of a latency period. Well, I never had a latency period. I can't help it. Why couldn't you have been more like Donald? Now there was a model boy. Tell the folks where you are today. I run a profitable dress company. Sometimes I wonder where my classmates are today. I'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company. I sell tallises. I used to be a heroin addict. Now I'm a methadone addict. I'm into leather. I lost track of most of my schoolmates, but I wound up a comedian. They did not take me in the army. I was... Interestingly enough... I was 4-P. In the event of war, I'm a hostage. You always only saw the worst in people. You never could get along with anyone in school. You were always out of step with the world. Even when you got famous, you still distrusted the world. I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, ""Jew."" You're crazy. We were walking off the tennis court. Him and me and his wife. He looked at her and they both looked at me. And under his breath he said, ""Jew."" Alvy, you're a total paranoid. I pick up on those kinda things. I was having lunch with some guys from NBC. So I said, ""Did you eat yet or what?"" And Tom Christie said, ""No. D'you?"" Not ""Did you"". ""D'you eat?"" ""D'you?"" Not ""Did you eat?"" but ""D'you eat?"" ""Jew?"" You get it? ""Jew eat?"" - Max... - Stop calling me Max. Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything. I was in a record store. There's this big, tall, blond, crew-cutted guy... ...looking at me in a funny way and saying, ""We have a sale this week on Wagner."" Wagner, Max. Wagner. I know what he's really trying to tell me, very significantly. Right, Max. California, Max. - Get the hell out of this crazy city. - Forget it. We move to sunny LA. All of show business is there. No. I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage... ...is that you can make a right turn on a red light. Forget it. Aren't you late for meeting Annie? I'm meeting her at the Beekman. I have a few minutes. Are you on television? No. Yeah. Once in a while. Occasionally. - What's your name? - You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. You were on the... uh... The Johnny Carson, right? Once in a while, you know. What's your name? I'm... I'm Robert Redford. Come on! Alvy Singer. It was nice... Thanks very much for everything. Hey! What? This is Alvy Singer! Fellas, you know... This guy's on television. Alvy Singer? Am I right? - Give me a break. - This guy's on television. I need a large polo mallet. - Who's on television? - On The Johnny Carson Show. Is this a meeting of the Teamsters? - What programme? - Can I have your autograph? - You don't want my autograph. - No, I do. It's for my girlfriend. Make it out to Ralph. - Your girlfriend's name is Ralph? - It's for my brudder. - Alvy Singer! - You're really Alvy Singer, the TV star? Alvy Singer over here! It's all right, fellas. Jesus! What did you do? Come by way of the Panama Canal? - I'm in a bad mood. - I'm here with the cast of The Godfather. - You have to learn to deal with it. - I'm dealing with guys named Cheech! Please. I have a headache, all right? You are in a bad mood. You must be getting your period. Every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think I'm getting my period! A little louder. I think one of them may have missed it. - Has the picture started? - It started two minutes ago. That's it. Forget it. I can't go in. - Two minutes, Alvy. - I can't do it. We've blown it already. I can't go in in the middle. We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish. - You wanna get coffee for two hours? - Two hours? No. I'm going in. - Go ahead. Goodbye. - While we're talking, we could be inside. Can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody? I get embarrassed. All right. So what do you wanna do? I don't know now. You wanna go to another movie? Let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity. Come on. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis. Well, I'm sorry. I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish. Cos... Cos I'm anal. That's a polite word for what you are. We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday. It is not one of his best. It lacks a cohesive structure. You get the feeling that he's not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say. I've always felt he was essentially a technical filmmaker. Granted, La Strada was a great film. Great in its use of negative imagery. I can't stand this guy. I'm gonna have a stroke. Well, stop listening to him. He's screaming his opinions in my ear. Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon. I found it incredibly... indulgent. He really is. He's one of the most indulgent filmmakers. The key word here is indulgent. Without getting... - What are you depressed about? - I missed my therapy. I overslept. - How can you possibly oversleep? - The alarm clock. Do you know what a hostile gesture that is to me? I know. Because of our sexual problem, right? Everybody at The New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse? It's like Samuel Beckett. I admire the technique, but it doesn't hit me on a gut level. - I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level. - Stop it, Alvy! He's spitting on my neck. He's spitting on my neck when he talks. You know, you're so egocentric that if I miss my therapy... ...you can only think of it in terms of how it affects you. Weltanschauung is what it is. Probably on their first date. Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. ""Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman... ...who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."" Our sexual problem? I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn. OK. I'm very sorry. My sexual problem. OK? My sexual problem. Huh? I never read that. That was a Henry James novel? Sequel of The Turn of the Screw? It's the influence of television. Now, Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a high... ...high intensity. You understand? A hot medium... What I wouldn't give for a large sock with horse manure in it. What do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind? Why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country. Do you have to give it so loud? Aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? The funny part is, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan. Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called TV, Media and Culture. So I think my insights into Mr McLuhan have a great deal of validity. Oh, do you? That's funny, because I happen to have Mr McLuhan right here. Just let me... Come over here a second. I heard what you were saying. You know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing. Boy, if life were only like this! June 14th, 1940. The German army occupies Paris. All over the country, people are desperate for every available scrap of news. Those guys in the French Resistance were really brave. To have to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much. Sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture. The Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card... ...and you'd tell 'em everything. That movie makes me feel guilty. Yeah, cos it's supposed to. Alvy... What? What... What's the matter? I don't... I don't know. It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time. Well, it's just that I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice. There's always an excuse. You used to think I was very sexy. When we first started going out, we had sex constantly. We're probably in the Guinness Book of World Records. Alvy, it'll pass. I'm going through a phase. That's all. You've been married before. You know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first. You're on right after Chris Brown, which looks about 20 minutes. Excuse me. When do I go on? Who are you? Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian. Oh, comedian. Yeah. Oh. You're on next. What do you mean, next? I'm... You're on right after this act. No, it can't be. Because he's a comic. Yes. - You're putting on two comics in a row? - Why not? No, I'm sorry. I don't wanna go on after another comedian. It's OK. No. Because they're laughing. So I'd... rather not. Will you relax? They're gonna love you. I'd prefer not to. Look. They're laughing at him. They're gonna laugh at him then I gotta go out. I gotta get laughs too. How much can they laugh? - They're laughed out. - Do you feel all right? Jesus! What's your name? Allison. Yeah? Allison what? Portchnik. Portchnik? - That's nice. - Thank you. Allison Portchnik! So, what are you telling me? You work for Stevenson all the time or what? No, no, no. I'm in the midst of doing my thesis. On what? Political Commitment in 20th-Century Literature. You're like... New York, Jewish, left-wing, liberal, intellectual... ...Central Park West, Brandeis University, socialist summer camps? The father with the Ben Shahn drawings? The really strike-oriented... Stop me before I make a complete imbecile of myself. No. That was wonderful. I love being reduced to a cultural stereotype. Right. I'm a bigot. But for the Left. I have to go out there. Say something encouraging. Quickly. I think you're cute. - Do you? - Mm-hm. Go ahead. I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally cos... ...I'm not essentially a political comedian at all. I interestingly had, um... dated a woman... ...in the Eisenhower administration briefly. And it was ironic to me cos, um... Cos I was trying to do to her... ...what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years. I'm sorry. I can't go through with this. I can't get it off my mind, Allison. It's obsessing me. I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention. But it doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository... ...and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? - It doesn't make sense! - Alvy... I'll tell you this. He was not marksman enough... ...to hit a moving target at that range. But... ...if there was a second assassin... - That's it! - We've been through this. They recovered the shells from that rifle. OK. What are you saying now? Everybody on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right? Well, why not? Yeah. Earl Warren? Hey, honey. I don't know Earl Warren. Lyndon Johnson? Lyndon Johnson is a politician! You know the ethics those guys have. It's like a notch underneath child molester. Then everybody's in on the conspiracy. The FBI and the CIA and J Edgar Hoover and oil companies... ...and the Pentagon and the men's room attendant at the White House. I would leave out the men's room attendant. You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me. Oh, my God! She's right. Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was beautiful, she was willing, she was real intelligent. Is it the old Groucho Marxjoke that I just don't wanna belong to any club... ...that would have someone like me for a member? Alvy, don't panic! Please stop it! It's a mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house. Stop it! Go for that one there. Maybe we should call the police. Dial 911. It's the lobster squad. They're only baby ones, for God's sakes. - If they're only babies, you pick 'em up. - All right! All right! - Here you go! - Don't give it to me! Don't! Look! One crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night. Will you get out of here with that thing? Jesus! Talk to 'em. You speak shellfish. Hey, look. Put it in the pot. I can't put it in the pot! I can't put a live thing in hot water! You think we're gonna take him to the movies? Oh, good, Alvy. Oh, thank you. OK. It's in. It's definitely in the pot. Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it'll run out. I'm gonna get my camera. I think if I could pry the door off... We should have gotten steaks. They don't run around. Goddamn it! Oh, jeez! Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please. You're gonna take pictures now? Alvy, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely! Oh, God! That's disgusting! One more, Alvy. Please! Oh, good! Good! Here's what I want to know. Am I your first big romance? Oh, no. No, no. Uh-uh. Really? Who was? There was Dennis from Chippewa Falls High School. Dennis? Local kid? Would meet you in front of the movie house? You should have seen how I looked then. Oh, I can imagine. The wife of an astronaut. Then there was Jerry, the actor. Look at you. You're such a clown. I look pretty. You always look pretty. But that guy... Acting is like an exploration of the soul. It's very religious. Like a kind of liberating consciousness. It's like a visual poem. Is he kidding with that crap? Oh, right. I think I know exactly what you mean when you say ""religious"". You do? - Oh, come on. I was younger. - Hey, that was last year. It's like when I think of dying. - You know how I'd like to die? - No. How? I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals. Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels! Listen, he was a terrific actor. He's neat-looking and he was emotional... I don't think you like emotion too much. Touch my heart... with your foot. I may throw up. He was creepy. I think you're pretty lucky I came along. Oh, really? Well, la-de-da. If anyone had ever told me I would be taking out a girl... ...who used expressions like la-de-da... You really like those New York girls. - Well, not just. Not only. - I'd say so. You married two of them. There's Henry Drucker. He has a chair in history at Princeton. The short man is Hershel Kaminsky. He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell. Two more chairs, they got a dining room set. - Why are you so hostile? - Cos I wanna watch the Knicks on TV. Is that Paul Goodman? No. Be nice to the host, because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. The Foul Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart. I'm so tired of making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery. Commentary. Really? I heard Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery. No jokes. These are friends, OK? Here you are. There's people out there. Two minutes ago the Knicks are ahead 14 points, and now they're ahead two points. Alvy... What is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases... ...trying to stuff a ball through a hoop? What is fascinating is that it's physical. Intellectuals prove you can be absolutely brilliant... ...and have no idea what's going on. But, on the other hand, the body doesn't lie... ...as we now know. Stop acting out. It'll be great. All those PhDs are in there discussing modes of alienation... ...and we'll be in here quietly humping. Alvy, don't. You're using sex to express hostility. Why do you always reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories? He said, as he removed her brassiere. Alvy! There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine! Oh, my God. What would they think? Damn siren! OK. Don't get upset. Dammit! I was so close! Last night it was a guy honking his car horn. The city can't close down. You wanna have them shut down the airport too? No more flights so we can have sex? I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York. We can't have this discussion. The country makes me nervous. You've got crickets. There's no place to walk after dinner. The screens with the dead moths behind 'em. You got the Manson family, possibly. You got Dick and Terry. OK! OK! My analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium? It's quiet now. We can start again. I can't. My head is throbbing. - You got a headache? - I have a headache. Bad? - Like Oswald in Ghosts. - Jesus! Where are you going? I'm going to take another in a series of cold showers. Max, my serve will send you to the showers early. The failure of the country to get behind New York City is anti-Semitism. Max, the city is terribly run. I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin. Every time some group disagrees with you, it's because of anti-Semitism. The rest of the country sees New York... ...as left-wing, Communist, Jewish, homosexual pornographers. I think of us that way sometimes, and I live here. Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day in the sun. Sun is bad for you. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college. I know, but I... Egad. Here he comes. OK. Hi! You know Alvy? This is Janet. This is Annie Hall. This is Alvy. Who's playing with who? You and me against them? - I can't play too good, you know? - I've had four lessons. Oh! Yeah! Hi! Hi. Hi. Oh, hi. Hi. Well... Bye. You play very well. Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God. What a dumb thing to say, right? You say, ""You play well"" and then right away I have to say, ""You play well."" Oh! God, Annie. Well... Oh, well. La-de-da. La-de-da. La-la. Yeah. You want a lift? Oh, why? You got a car? Me? No. I was gonna take a cab. Oh, no. I have a car. You have a car? I don't understand. If you have a car, so then... ...why did you say, ""Do you have a car?"" Like you wanted a lift? I don't... I don't... Jeez, I don't know. I wasn't... It's... I've got this VW out there. What a jerk! Yeah. Would you like a lift? Sure. Which way are you going? Me? Downtown. I'm going uptown. Well, you know, I'm going uptown too. You just said you were going downtown. Sorry. I can go uptown too. I live uptown, but what the hell! It'll be nice having company. I hate driving alone. So where do you know Janet from? - I'm in her acting class. - You're an actress? Well, I do commercials, sort of. - You're not from New York, right? - Chippewa Falls. - Where? - Wisconsin. You're driving a tad rapidly. Don't worry. I'm a very good driver. I'm good. - You want some gum anyway? - No. No, thanks. Hey, don't... No, no. Would you watch the road? I'll get it! - I'll get you a piece. - So, you drive? Do I drive? No. I've got a problem with driving. Oh, you do? I've got a licence, but I have too much hostility. Nice car. You keep it nice. Can I ask you? Is this a sandwich? Huh? Oh, yeah. I live over here. Oh, my God! Look! There's a parking space. That's OK. We can walk to the kerb from here. - You want your tennis stuff? - Huh? Oh. Yeah. That's good. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Well... Thank you. You're a wonderful tennis player and... ...you're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life. Anyplace. Europe. The United... Anyplace. Asia. - And I love what you're wearing. - Oh, you do, yeah? Oh, well, it's a... This tie is a present from Grammy Hall. Who? Grammy... Grammy Hall? Yeah, my grammy. Did you grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting? - Your grammy? - I know. It's pretty silly, isn't it? My grammy never gave gifts. She was too busy getting raped by Cossacks. Well... - Thank you again. - Oh, yeah. Hey, you wanna come upstairs and have a glass of wine or something? I mean, you don't have to. You're probably late. No, no. That'd be fine. I wouldn't mind. Sure. I've got time. I've got nothing... till my analyst appointment. Oh, you see an analyst? - Yeah. Just for 15 years. - 15 years?! I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm going to Lourdes. 15... Nah! Come on! Yeah? Really? Sylvia Plath? Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide... ...was misinterpreted as romantic by the college-girl mentality. Oh, sorry. I don't know. Some of her poems seem neat. Neat? I hate to tell you, this is 1975. ""Neat"" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century. Who are those photos on the wall? Oh! Well, you see now, uh... That's my dad. That's Father. And that's my brother Duane. - Duane? - Yeah, right. Duane. And over there is Grammy Hall. And that's Sadie. - Who's Sadie? - Oh, well, Sadie... Ha, ha. Sadie met Grammy through Grammy's brother George. George was real sweet. He had that thing... What is that thing where you fall asleep in the middle of a sentence? What is it? - Narcolepsy. - Narcolepsy! Right! So anyway, um... George went to the union, you see, to get his free turkey. The union always gave George this free turkey at Christmas time... ...because he was shell-shocked in the First World War. Anyway, so George is standing in line - oh, just a sec - getting his free turkey. But the thing is, is that he falls asleep... ...and he never wakes up! So... so he's dead! He's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well... Terrible, huh? Wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty awful. It's a great story, though. It really made my day. I think I should get outta here cos I think I'm imposing. Really? Well, maybe, um... You know, I... - You don't have to, you know. - I'm all perspired and everything. Didn't you take a shower at the club? Me? No. Cos I never shower in a public place. Why not? Cos I don't like to get naked in front of another man. Oh, I see. I see. I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender. You never know what's gonna happen. - 15 years, huh? - 15 years, yeah. That's... God bless. Well... well... You're what Grammy Hall would call ""a real Jew"". Thank you. Yeah, well, she hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money. But she's the one. Is she ever! I'm tellin' you. So did you do those photographs in there or what? Yeah. I sort of dabble around, you know. I dabble? They're wonderful, you know. They have a... a quality. Well, I would like to take a serious photography course. Photography's interesting cos it's a new art form... ...and a set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet. Aesthetic criteria? You mean whether it's a good photo or not? The medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself. Well... to me... I mean, it's... it's... it's all instinctive. I just try to feel it. I try to get a sense of it and not think about it so much. Still, you need a set of aesthetic guidelines to put it in social perspective. Well, I don't know. I guess you must be sort of late, huh? You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon. Otherwise I... - Hey, are you busy Friday night? - Me? Oh, uh, no. Oh, I'm sorry! I have something. What about Saturday night? Nothing. No, no. You're very popular, I can see. - I know. - Do you have plague? Well, I mean, I meet a lot ofjerks. I meet a lot ofjerks too. I think that's a... But I'm thinking about getting some cats. Oh, wait a second. Oh, no, no! Oh, shoot! No. Saturday night I'm gonna... I'm gonna sing. Yeah. You're gonna sing? Do you sing? No kidding? - This is my first time. - Really? Where? I'd like to come. - Oh, no. No, no, no, no! - I'm interested. I'm just... I'm auditioning at this club. I don't... - It's my first time. - It's OK. I know exactly what that's like. You're gonna like nightclubs. They're really a lot of fun. ~ It had to be you ~ ~ It had to be you ~ ~ I wandered around ~ ~ And finally found ~ ~ The somebody who ~ ~ Could make me be true ~ ~ Could make me be blue ~ - ~ And even be glad ~ ~ Just to be sad ~ ~ Thinking of you ~ I was awful! I'm so ashamed! I can't sing! So the audience was a tad restless. What do you mean, a tad restless? They hated me! They didn't! You have a wonderful voice! - I'm gonna quit. - I won't let you. You have a great voice. - Really? Do you think so? Really? - Yeah. It's terrific. I never even took a lesson, either. Hey, listen. Give me a kiss. - Really? - Because we're just gonna go home later. There's gonna be all that tension and I won't know when to make the right move. So we'll kiss now, we'll get it over with and then go eat. - We'll digest our food better. - OK. OK? So now we can digest our food. I'm gonna have the corned beef, please. Oh. I'm gonna have pastrami on white bread... ...with mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. So, um... your second wife left you. And were you depressed about that? Nothing that a few megavitamins couldn't cure. And your first wife? Allison? She was nice, but... That was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy. Mm... Mm... That was so nice. That was nice. As Balzac said, ""There goes another novel."" - You were great. - Oh. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. I'm wrecked. - You're wrecked! - I mean it. I will never play the piano again. It was... I don't know. You really thought it was good? Good? Yes. That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing. Here. You want some? No. I... I don't... use any major hallucinogenics because I... ...took a puff about five years ago at a party and... Yeah? Tried to take my pants off over my head. Got in one ear. Well, I don't really... I don't do it very often. It just sort of relaxes me. - You're not gonna believe this, but... - What? What? I'm gonna buy you these books because I think you should read them. - Instead of that cat book. - That's pretty serious stuff there. Yeah. Cos I'm obsessed with death, I think. Big subject with me. I have a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this if we're gonna go out. I feel that life is divided up into the horrible and the miserable. Those are the two categories. The horrible would be like terminal cases. And blind people. And cripples. I don't know how they get through life. And the miserable is everyone else. So you should be thankful that you're miserable. You're very lucky to be miserable. Look at that guy. In the pink. Mr Miami Beach there. He's just come back from the gin rummy finals. Placed third. Look at these guys. They're back from Fire Island. They're giving it a chance. - Italian, right? - Him? Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen supply business or cement and contracting, I think. ""Oh, gee! Must have my moustache waxed."" There's the winner of the Truman Capote lookalike contest. You are extremely sexy. Unbelievably sexy. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. You know what you are? You're polymorphously perverse. What does that mean? I don't know what that is. You're exceptional in bed because you get pleasure... ...in every part of your body when I touch you. Like the tip of your nose. If I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps, you suddenly get excited. You know what? I like you. I really do like you. Do you love me? That's the key question. I know you've only known me a short while. I think that's sort of... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you love me? Love is... too weak a word for... the way I feel. I lurve you. You know, I loave you. I luff you. With two Fs. Yes, I have to invent... Of course I do. Don't you think I do? I don't know. You're not gonna give up your apartment, are you? Of course. - But why? - I'm moving in with you. - But you've got a nice apartment. - I have a tiny apartment. - I know it's small. - And it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Granted. It has bad plumbing and bugs. You say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are... Entomology is a rapidly growing field. - You don't want me to live with you. - I don't want you to live with me? - Whose idea was it? - Mine. It was yours, actually. But I approved it immediately. I guess you think I talked you into something, huh? No! We live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus! You don't want it to be like we're married, do you? - How is it any different? - Cos you keep your own apartment. We don't have to go to it. We don't have to deal with it. It's like a free-floating life raft. That we know that we're not married. That little apartment is $400 a month, Alvy. - That place is $400 a month? - Yes, it is. It's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus! My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction. I'll pay for it. - You don't think I'm smart enough. - Hey, don't be ridiculous. Then why are you always pushing me to take college courses like I was dumb? Adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet interesting professors. It's stimulating. Does this sound like a good course? ""Modern American Poetry""? Or let's see now. Maybe I should take... ...""Introduction to the Novel"". Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf. What? Hey, what do you think? You think we should go to that party in Southampton? Don't be silly. What do we need other people for? We should just turn out the lights and play hide the salami or something. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, OK? Grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday. - Well, have you ever made love high? - Me? No. If I have grass or alcohol or anything, I get unbearably wonderful. I get too wonderful for words. I don't know why you have to get high every time we make love. - Well, it relaxes me. - You have to be artificially relaxed... ...before we can go to bed? - What's the difference? Take a shot of Sodium Pentothal. You can sleep through it. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for15 years. You should smoke this. You'd be off the couch in no time. - Come on. You don't need that. - What are you doing? - No, Alvy. Please. - You can live without it once. Wait. I got a great idea. Hang in there for a second. I got a little artefact. A little erotic artefact that I brought up from the city... ...which I think is gonna be perfect. There. Create a little old New Orleans essence. Now we can go about our business here... ...and even develop photographs if we want to. - Hey, is something wrong? - No. Why? I don't know. It's like you're removed. No, I'm fine. - Really? - Uh-huh. I don't know. You seem sorta distant. Let's just do it, all right? Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions? Do you remember where I put my drawing pad? While you two are doing that, I think I'm gonna do some drawing. - That's what I call removed. - Oh, you have my body. Yeah, but I want the whole thing. Well, I need grass. Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass. I'm a comedian. If I get a laugh from a person who's high... ...it doesn't count, cos they're always laughing. - Were you always funny? - What is this? An interview? We're supposed to be making love. This guy is naturally funny. I think he can write for you. Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid, he tells me you're really good. Let me explain how I work. I don't look like a funny guy like some of the guys that come out. You know you're gonna fall down. But material's gotta be sensational for me. I work with very... I'm kinda classy. Let me explain. For instance, I open with an opening song. Musical style like ~ Bam da dam da da da ~ and I walk out... ~ Place looks wonderful from here ~ ~ And you folks look wonderful from here ~ ~ And seeing you there with a smile on your face ~ ~ Makes me shout ""This must be the place"" ~ Then I open with some jokes. That's where I need you. ""I just got back from Canada. They speak a lot of French up there."" ""The word to remember is Jeanne d'Arc. It means the light's out in the bathroom."" ""I met a big lumberjack..."" Jesus! This guy's pathetic. Look at him mincing around. He thinks he's real cute. You wanna throw up. If only I had the nerve to do my own jokes. I don't know how much longer I can keep this smile frozen on my face. I'm in the wrong business. I know it. ""But... um... chri... ...what will I do with this?"" ""Oh, Marie! Sometime you make me so mad!"" They scream at that! Write me something like that. A French number. Can you do it? Where am I? I have to reorient myself. This is the University of Wisconsin, right? Cos I'm always... tense... I have a very bad history with colleges. I went to New York University. And I was thrown out of NYU in my freshman year... ...for cheating on my metaphysics final. I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me. My mother, an emotionally high-strung woman... ...locked herself in the bathroom and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles. I was depressed at that time. I was in analysis. I was suicidal, as a matter of fact, and would have killed myself. But I was in analysis with a strict Freudian. If you kill yourself, they make you pay for the sessions you miss. Alvy, you were just great. I'm not kidding. It was... - You were so funny. - College audiences are wonderful. And I'm starting to get more of the references too. Are you? Well, the 12 o'clock show's completely different. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. You'll meet Mother and Father. - They'll hate me immediately. - I don't think so. I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. It's Easter. We'll have a nice dinner. I think they're gonna really like you. It's a nice ham this year, Mom. Oh, yeah. Grammy always does such a good job. A great sauce! It is. It's dynamite ham. We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. We got some nice picture frames. We really had a good time. Ann tells us that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years. Yes. I'm making excellent progress. Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, I won't have to wear the lobster bib. - Duane and I went out to the boat basin. - We were caulking holes all day. And Randolph Hunt was drunk. As usual. That Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. - He was in the choir with you. - Oh, yes. I can't believe this family. Annie's mother is really beautiful. And they're talking swap meets and boat basins. And the old lady at the end of the table is a classic Jew-hater. They really look American. Very healthy. Like they never get sick or anything. Nothing like my family. The two are like oil and water. Let him drop dead. Who needs his business? - His wife has diabetes. - Diabetes? Is that an excuse? Diabetes? The man is 50 years old and doesn't have a substantial job. - Is that a reason to steal from his father? - What are you talking about? Sure! Defend him! Pass the wurst there. Mo Moskowitz, he had a coronary. You don't say! How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs Singer? - We fast. - Fast? No food. To atone for our sins. What sins? I don't understand. To tell you the truth, neither do we. Alvy. Hi, Duane. How's it goin'? This is my room. Oh, yeah? It's terrific. Can I confess something? I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... ...on the road at night, I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly... ...head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion. The sound of shattering glass. The... ...flames rising out of the flowing gasoline. Right. Well... I have to go now, Duane, because I... ...I'm due back on the planet Earth. - Don't let it be so long. - Look up Uncle Billy. - He is adorable. - Do you think so? - You're taking them to the airport? - Duane can. I haven't finished my drink. Yes, Duane is. Just a second. I have to get... - You followed me. - I didn't follow you. You followed me! I was walking behind staring at you. That's not following. - What is your definition of following? - I was spying. - Do you realise how paranoid you are? - You've got your arms around a guy. That is the worst kind of paranoid. I didn't start out spying. I thought I'd pick you up after school. You wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? You're having an affair with your professor. That jerk that teaches that crap course - Contemporary Crisis in Western Man? Existential Motifs in Russian Literature! It's all mental masturbation. We finally get to a subject you know about. Don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love. We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat. Neat. Are you 12 years old? - That's a Chippewa Falls expression. - Who cares?! Next he'll find you keen and peachy. Then he's got his hand on your ass. You've always had hostility towards David. - You call your teacher David? - It's his name. It's a biblical name, right? What does he call you? Bathsheba? Alvy. Alvy, you're the one who never wanted to make a real commitment. You don't think I'm smart enough. We had that argument just last month. Or don't you remember? - I'm home! - Oh, yeah? How did it go? Oh, it was really weird, but she's a very nice woman. I didn't have to lie down on the couch. She had me sitting up. I told her about the family and my feelings towards men... ...and my relationship with my brother. She mentioned penis envy. Do you know about that? I'm one of the few males who suffers from that. Go on. I'm interested. She said I was very guilty about my impulses towards marriage and children. Then I remembered, when I was a kid, I accidentally saw my parents making love. All this happened the first hour? I've been going for 15 years. I don't have... nothing like that. I told her my dream and then I cried. You cried? I have never once cried. That's fantastic. I whine. I sit and I whine. In my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding this pillow across my face and I can't breathe. - Sinatra? - Yeah. Strangling me. Sure. Because he's a singer and you're a singer. It's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It's a perfect analytic kind of insight. She said your name was Alvy Singer. - What do you mean? Me? - Yeah, you. Because in the dream I break Sinatra's glasses. You never said Sinatra had glasses. What are you saying? That I'm suffocating you? God, Alvy. I did this really terrible thing to him. Because then, when he sang, it was in this real high-pitched voice. What did the doctor say? I should probably come five times a week. I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife? - Will it change your wife? - My life. - You said, ""Will it change my wife?"" - I said, ""Will it change my life?"" - You said wife. - Life! I said life. She said, ""Will it change my wife?"" You heard that, so I'm not crazy. I told her I didn't think you'd ever take me seriously... ...because you don't think I'm smart enough. Why do you always bring that up? Because I encourage you to take adult education courses? You meet wonderful, interesting professors. Adult education is such junk. The professors are so phoney. I don't care what you say about David. He's a fine teacher. And why are you following me around? - I was following you and David. - Let's call it quits. That's fine. That's great. I don't know what I did wrong. She cooled off to me. Is it something that I did? It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades. Love fades? God! That's a depressing thought. I have to ask you a question. With your wife in bed... ...does she need some kind of artificial stimulation? Like marijuana? We use a large vibrating egg. A large vibrating egg? Well, I ask a psychopath, I get that kind of an answer. Jesus! Here. You look like a very happy couple. - Are you? - Yeah. So how do you account for it? Uh... I'm very shallow and empty... ...and I have no ideas and nothing interesting to say. - And I'm exactly the same way. - I see. Well, that's very interesting. So you've managed to work out something, huh? Well, thanks very much for talking to me. Even as a kid, I always went for the wrong women. I think that's my problem. My mother took me to see Snow White. Everyone fell in love with Snow White. I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen. - We never have any fun any more. - How can you say that? You're always leaning on me to improve myself. You must be getting your period. I don't get a period! I'm a cartoon character. Can't I be upset once in a while? Max, forget about Annie. I know lots of women you can date. I don't wanna go out with any other women. I have got a girl for you. You'll love her. She's a reporter for Rolling Stone. I think there are more people here to see the Maharishi than there were for Dylan. I covered the Dylan concert, which gave me chills. Especially when he sang, ""She takes just like a woman."" ""And she makes love just like a woman. Yes, she does."" ""And she aches just like a woman."" ""But she breaks just like a little girl."" After that, the most charismatic event I covered... ...was Mick's birthday at Madison Square Garden. - That's great. That's just great. - Did you catch Dylan? Me? No, I couldn't make it. My raccoon had hepatitis. You have a raccoon? A few. The only word for this is transplendid. It's transplendid. I can think of another word. He's God. This man is God. He's got millions of followers... ...who would crawl across the world just to touch the hem of his garment. Yeah? Must be a tremendous hem. - I'm a Rosicrucian myself. - Are you? I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look. There's God coming out of the men's room. It's unbelievably transplendid! I was at the Stones concert when they killed that guy. Were you? I was at an Alice Cooper thing... ...where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes. I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish. Oh, no. Don't be... Don't be silly. You know, I... I'm starting to get some feeling back in my jaw now. Sex with you is really a Kafkaesque experience. Oh. Thank you. I mean that as a compliment. I think... I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm. You know, to make up for empty areas in life. Who said that? I don't know. I think it may have been Leopold and Loeb. Hello. Oh, hi! Uh... no. What... What's the matter? You sound terrible. No. Sure, I... What kind of emergency? No. Well, stay there. Stay there. I'll come over right now. Just stay there. I'll come right over. It's me. Open up. Are you OK? What's the matter? Are you all right? There's a spider in the bathroom. What? There's a big, black spider in the bathroom. You got me here at three in the morning cos there's a spider in the bathroom? You know how I am about insects. I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around. Kill it! What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid? No. I told you a thousand times. You should always keep a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over. And a first-aid kit and a fire-extinguisher... Give me a magazine, cos I'm a little tired. You make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? Did you go to a rock concert? Yeah. Oh, yeah? Really? How'd you like it? Was it... I mean, was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? It was just great. Why don't you get the guy that took you to the rock concert... ...to come over and kill the spider? I called you. You wanna help me or not, huh? Since when do you read the National Review? - What are you turning into? - I like to try to get all points of view. Then get William F Buckley to kill the spider. Alvy, you're a little hostile. You know that? Not only that. You look thin and tired. It's three o'clock in the morning! You got me out of bed. I ran over here. I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency. I ran up the stairs. I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Are you going with a right-wing rock-and-roll star? Would you like a glass of chocolate milk? Hey, what am I? Your son? I came over for... I got the good chocolate. - Where's the spider? - It's in the bathroom. Don't squish it. And after it's dead, flush it down the toilet a couple of times. Darling, I've been killing spiders since I was 30, OK? It's a very big spider. Lotta trouble. There's two of them. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom? It's at your house. I think I left it there. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick. OK. Hey... - What is this? You got black soap? - It's for my complexion. What, are you joining a minstrel show? Don't worry! I did it. I killed them both. What are you sad about? What did you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em? - Oh, don't go. Please. - What do you mean, don't... What's the matter? Are you expecting termites? What's the matter? I don't know. I miss you. - Oh, Jesus. Really? - Oh, yeah. Oh... - Alvy? - What? Was there somebody in your room when I called you? - What do you mean? - Was there... I thought I heard a voice. I had the radio on. I'm sorry - it was the television set. I was watching... Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart. I think we're both much too mature for something like that. Living together hasn't been so bad, has it? No. For me, it's been terrific. You know? Better than either one of my marriages. There's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great. You know, I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun. I mean, I know it's hard. It's... Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend? Why don't we get Rob, and the three of us would drive into Brooklyn? We could show you the old neighbourhood. That'd be fun for you. Yeah, it would. Oh, my God! It's a great day! Watch the road! You're gonna total the car! I've never even been to Brooklyn. Got to see the old neighbourhood. We can show her the schoolyard. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max. The best. I was all-schoolyard. They threw him a football once and he tried to dribble it. I used to lose my glasses a lot. Oh, look! That's my old house. That's where I used to live. Holy cow! You're lucky. Where I lived is now a pornographic equipment store. I have some very good memories there. Your mother and father fighting all the time? Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things. - You fired the cleaner? - She stole! She's coloured! They have enough trouble! - She went through my pocketbook! - They're persecuted enough! - Who's persecuting? She stole! - So? We can afford it! How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more? She's a coloured woman from Harlem! She has no money! She's got a right to steal from us! Who is she gonna steal from if not us? - You're both crazy! - They can't hear you, Max. Leo, I married a fool! Hey, Max. What's that? That's the welcome-home party, 1945, for my cousin Herbie. Look. There. That's Joey Nichols. He was my father's friend. He was always bothering me when I was a kid. Joey Nichols. See? Nickels. See? Nickels. You see? Nickels. You can always remember my name. Just think of Joey Five Cents. Ha-ha! That's me! Joey Five Cents! What an asshole. The one who killed me the most was my mother's sister Tessie. I was always the sister with good common sense. Tessie was always the one with personality. When she was younger, they all wanted to marry Tessie. Tessie Moskowitz had the personality. She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt. She was once a great beauty. Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality. I was a great beauty. - How did this personality come about? - I was very charming. There were many men interested in you? Oh, I was quite a lively dancer. That's very hard to believe. Well, I had a really good day. It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday. - Your birthday's not till tomorrow. - But it's real close. Yeah, but no presents till midnight. I wonder what this is. - Happy birthday. - What is this? Is this a present? Are you kidding? - Yeah. Why don't you try it on? - Yeah? I don't... - This is more like a present for you. - It'll add ten years to our sex life. - Yeah. Forget it. - Here's a real present. Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway? - Check it out. - Let me see. OK. Let's see. Oh, God! You knew I wanted this. God! It's terrific. God! Just put on the watch and the... and that thing and everything. Oh, God. Oh. ~ Seems like ~ ~ Old times ~ ~ Having you ~ ~ To walk with ~ ~ Seems like ~ ~ Old times< ~ ~ Having you to walk with< ~ ~ And it's still a thrill ~ ~ Just to have my arms around you ~ ~ Still the thrill ~ ~ That it was the day I found you ~ ~ Seems like ~ ~ Old times ~ ~ Dinner dates and flowers ~ ~ Old times ~ ~ Staying up all hours ~ ~ Making dreams come true ~ ~ Doing things we used to do ~ ~ Seems like old times ~ ~ Here with ~ ~ You ~ Thank you. You were sensational. I told you if you stuck to it you would be great. And... and you know... you were sensational. Well, Alvy, they were just a terrific audience. It makes it really easy for me because I can be... Excuse me. Hi, I'm Tony Lacey. We just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your set. Oh, yeah, really? I thought it was very musical and I liked it a lot. That's really nice. Thanks a lot. Are you recording? Do you... Are you with any label now? Me? No. No. Not at all. Well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime if you get a chance. - Possibly working together. - Well, that's nice. Oh, listen. This is Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? No, but I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you very much. This is Shaun and Bob and... Bob and Petronia. Hi. We're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre. We're gonna meet Jack and Anjelica and have a drink. If you'd like to come, we'd love to have you. We can just sit and talk. Nothing... Not a big deal. It's just relaxed. It would just be very mellow. Remember we have that thing. What thing? Don't you remember we discussed that thing that we were... We had a... Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing. Yeah. Yeah... Oh, well, if it's inconvenient, that's fine too. We'll do it another time. Maybe if you're on the coast, we'll get together and meet there. It was a wonderful set. I really enjoyed it. Nice to have met you. Good night. Bye. What's the matter? You wanted to go to that party? I don't know. I thought it might be kinda fun. It would be nice to meet some new people. I don't think I could take a mellow evening. I don't respond well to mellow. I have a tendency to... If I get too mellow, I ripen and then rot. It's not good for my... So you don't wanna go to the party. So what do you wanna do? That was the last day I remember really having a good time. - We never have any laughs any more. - I've been moody and dissatisfied. - How often do you sleep together? - Do you have sex often? - Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week. - Constantly. I'd say three times a week. - The other night Alvy wanted to have sex. - She would not sleep with me. Then... I don't know... Six months ago I would have done it just to please him. I tried everything, you know. I put on soft music and my red light bulb. But the thing is, since our discussions here... ...I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you would have been happy because I asserted myself. I'm paying for her analysis. And she's making progress and I'm getting screwed. I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it. So I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. If I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. She's making progress and I'm not. Her progress is killing my progress. Sometimes I think I should just live with a woman. I don't believe it! You mean to tell me you guys have never snorted coke? Well, I always wanted to try. But Alvy, he's very down on it. Don't put it on me. I don't wanna put a wad of white powder in my nose. There's the nasal membrane. - You never wanna try anything new, Alvy. - How can you say that? I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should have a threesome. - Well, that's sick! - I know it's sick, but it's new. You didn't say it couldn't be sick. Come on, Alvy. Do your body a favour. Try it. I'm sure it's a lot of fun, cos the Incas did it. And they were a million laughs. Come on. For your own experience. You wanna write. It's great stuff. A friend of mine just brought it in from California. Oh, you know, we're going to California next week. It's incredible. I'm thrilled, as you know. On my agent's advice, I sold out and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV. No. That's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. You act like you're violating a moral issue. We have to leave New York during Christmas week, which kills me. Listen, while you're in California, could you possibly score some coke for me? Oh, sure. I'd be glad to. I'll just put it in a hollow heel that I have on my boot. How much is this stuff, incidentally? It's about $2,000 an ounce. Really? And what is the kick of it? Cos I never... ~ We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas... ~ I've never been so relaxed as I have been since I moved here, Max. I want you to see my house. I live next to Hugh Hefner. He lets me use the Jacuzzi. And the women are like the women in Playboy magazine... ...only they can move their arms and legs. I can't get over it - this is really Beverly Hills. The architecture's so consistent. French next to Spanish next to Tudor next to Japanese. God! It's so clean out here. They don't throw their garbage out. They make it into TV shows. Give us a break, Max. It's Christmas. Can you believe this is Christmas? It was snowing and really grey in New York, naturally. Santa Claus'll have sunstroke. Max, there's no crime. There's no mugging. There's no economic crime. But there's ritual religious-cult murders. There's wheat-germ killers out here. While you're out here, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party. ~ Remember Christ our Saviour was born on Christmas Day ~ ~ To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray... ~ All right now, Charlie, give me a good laugh here. ...limousine to the track break down? A little bigger. Max, you realise how immoral this all is? - Max, I got a hit series. - I know. But you're adding fake laughs. ...home so early. Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie. We do this show live in front of an audience. And nobody laughs, cos the jokes aren't funny. That's why this machine is dynamite. Honey, you'd better lie down. You've been in the sun too long. Now give me a medium-sized chuckle here. And then a big hand. Is there booing on that? Oh, Max. I don't feel well. - What's the matter? - I don't know. I just got... very dizzy. - I feel dizzy, Max. - Well, sit down. Oh, Jesus! - Are you all right? - I don't know. - You wanna lie down? - No. My stomach felt queasy all morning. - How about a ginger ale? - Oh... Max, no. Maybe I'd better lie down. Why don't you try to get a little of this down? It's just plain chicken. Oh, no. I can't eat this. I'm nauseous. If you can just give me something to get me through the next two hours. I have to go out to Burbank and give out an award on a TV show. There's nothing wrong with you, actually, so far as I can tell. You have no fever. No symptoms of anything serious. - You haven't eaten pork or shellfish. - Excuse me. I'm sorry, doctor. Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement so they're going to tape without you. Jesus! Now I don't get to do the TV show? - I know. Listen, doctor. - I was just saying, I can't find anything. - Nothing at all? - No. I could get a lab man up here. Can I have the salt, please? Perhaps it would be even better if we took him to hospital for a day or two. - Hospital? - Or there's no real way... ...to tell what's going on. - This is not bad, actually. Don't tell me we have to walk from the car to the house. My feet haven't touched pavement since I reached Los Angeles. I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy. I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. All the good meetings are taken. Right now it's only a notion. But I think I can get money... ...to make it into a concept, and then turn it into an idea. - Like this house, Max? - Mm-hm. I even brought a map to get us to the bathroom. You should have told me it was Tony Lacey's party. What difference does that make? - I think he has a thing for Annie. - No. Unfortunately, Max... ...he goes with that girl over there. - Where? The one with the VPL. - VPL? - Visible Panty Line. - Max, she is gorgeous. - Yeah, she's a ten, Max. - Great for you, cos you're used to twos. - There are no twos, Max. The kind with shopping bags in Central Park with surgical masks on, muttering. How do you like this couple? They just came back from Masters and Johnson. Yeah. Intensive care ward. My God. Hey, Max, I think she's giving me the eye. If she comes over, my brain'll turn into guacamole. - Hi. - Hi. You're Alvy Singer, right? - Didn't we meet at EST? - EST? No, I was never to EST. - Then how can you criticise it? - Oh, he didn't say anything. I came out to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis. - He's my food taster. Have you two met? - How you doing? - You taste to see if the food's poisoned? - Yeah. He's great. You guys are wearing white. It must be in the stars. Uri Geller must be here. We're gonna operate together. We just need about six weeks. In six weeks we could cut the whole album. I don't know. This is strange to me. You can come and stay here. There's a whole wing you can have. - Yeah? Stay here? - Really. Why are you smiling? I don't know. I don't know. Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meeting. This is a great house. Really. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. - Then you know who lived here? - Trigger. Charlie Chaplin. Right before his un-American thing. That's great. - But you guys are still New Yorkers. - Yeah, I love it there. I used to live there. I used to live there for years, but... It's so dirty now. I'm into garbage. It's my thing. This is a really nice screening room, Tony. There's another thing about New York. If you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in line. It could be freezing. We saw Grand Illusion here last night. Hey, that's a great film if you're high. Come and see our bedroom. We did a fantastic thing. No, thanks, man. I'm cool. It's wonderful. They just eat and watch movies all day. And gradually you get old and die. It's important to make an effort once in a while. Do you think his girlfriend's beautiful? A tad on the androgynous side, but dynamite. Yeah. I forgot my mantra. That was fun. I don't think California's bad at all. It's a drag coming home. A lot of beautiful women. It was fun to flirt. I have to face facts. I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work any more. I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Why do I need this? If only I had the nerve to break up. But it would really hurt him. If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest. Alvy, let's face it. You know... I don't think our relationship is working. I know. A relationship, I think, is like a shark. It has to constantly move forward, or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark. Whose Catcher in the Rye is this? If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine. It sure has... You wrote your name in all my books... ...cos you knew this day was gonna come. Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do. No question. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt. All the books on death and dying are yours, and all the poetry books are mine. Denial of Death. This is the first book that I got you. Remember that day? Jeez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. Hm. Oh. Thanks, Annie. Oh, no, no, no. I mean, I think it's really important for us... ...to explore new relationships and stuff like that. There's no question about that. Cos we've given this a more than fair shot. My analyst thinks this move is key for me. And, you know, I trust her. Because my analyst recommended her. Why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway? And you know what the beauty part is? - We can always get back together again. - Exactly. I don't think many couples could handle this. Just break up and remain friends. Hey, this one's mine, this button. I guess these are all yours. Impeach Eisenhower. Impeach Nixon. Impeach Lyndon Johnson. Impeach Ronald Reagan. I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake. She's living in Los Angeles with Tony Lacey. Then the hell with her. If she likes that lifestyle, let her live there. - He's a jerk, for one thing. - He graduated Harvard. He may have... Listen, Harvard makes mistakes too. Kissinger taught there. Don't tell me you're jealous. Yeah. Jealous? A little bit. Like Medea. Can I show you something, lady? I have here... I found this in the apartment. Black soap. She used to wash her face 800 times a day with black soap. Don't ask me why. Why don't you go out with other women? Well, I tried. But it's... you know, it's very depressing. This always happens to me. Quick! Get a broom! What are you making such a big deal about? They're only lobsters. You're a grown man. You know how to pick up a lobster. - I'm not myself since I stopped smoking. - When did you quit? 16 years ago. What do you mean? Mean? You stopped smoking 16 years ago. Is that what you said? I don't understand. Are you joking or what? Central Park's turning green. Yeah. I saw that lunatic that we used to see... ...with the pinwheel hat, you know, and the roller skates. Listen, I... I want you to come back here. Well... Then I'm gonna come out there and get you. What do you mean, where am I? Where do you think I am? I'm at the Los Angeles airport. I flew in. I... Well, I flew in to see you. Hey, listen. Can we not debate this on the telephone? Because I feel that I got a temperature. And I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles nausea already. I don't feel so good. Wherever you wanna meet. I don't care. I'll drive in. I rented a car. I'm driving. What do you... What, is that such a miracle? I'm driving myself. I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and... ...a plate of mashed yeast. Hi. You look very pretty. Oh, no. I just lost a little weight, that's all. Well... you look nice. I've been thinking about it, and I think that we should get married. Oh, Alvy. Come on. Why? You wanna live out here? It's like living in Munchkin Land. What do you mean? It's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice. And... well, I meet people and I go to parties and we play tennis. I mean, that's a very big step for me, you know. I mean, I'm able to enjoy people more. So... you're not gonna come back to New York? What's so great about New York? It's a dying city. You read Death in Venice. You didn't read Death in Venice till I bought it for you. That's right. You only gave me books with the word ""death"" in the title. Cos it's an important issue. Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life. You're like New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself. I can't enjoy anything unless everybody is. If one guy is starving someplace, that's... it puts a crimp in my evening. So you wanna get married or what? No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends. OK. Check, please! You're mad, aren't you? Yes, of course I'm mad. Because you love me. I know that. Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really can't. You know how wonderful you are. You know you're the reason that I got out of my room and that I was able to sing... ...and get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna... Listen, listen, listen, um... So what are you up to anyway, huh? The usual, you know. I'm trying to write. I'm working on a play. So what are you saying? You're not coming back to New York with me? No. Look... I gotta go. - I flew 3,000 miles to see you. - I'm late. Air miles. You know what that does to my stomach? It's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammies are tonight. - The what? - He's got a lot of records up for awards. They give awards for that music? I thought just earplugs. Just forget it! Let's just forget the conversation. Awards! They do nothing but give out awards! I can't believe it. Greatest fascist dictator - Adolf Hitler. I know what you're gonna say. I'm not a great driver. I have some problems with... Can I see your licence, please? Just don't get angry or anything, cos I... I have my licence here. It's a rented car and I... I... Here. Don't give me your life... ...story. Just pick up the licence. You have to ask nicely cos I've had an extremely rough day. My girlfriend... Just give me the licence, please. Since you put it that way, it's hard for me to refuse. I have a terrific problem with authority. It's not your fault. Don't take it personal. So long, fellas. Keep in touch. Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max. Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. I heard high-pitched squealing. Twins, Max. 16-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities of that? You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park. I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard II, and two guys with leatherjackets stole my leotard. Max, are we driving through plutonium? It keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old. You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle? What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city. You read Death in Venice. You didn't read it till I gave it to you. You only give me books with ""death"" in the title. - It's an important issue. - You are totally incapable of enjoying life. You're like New York. You're an island. OK. If that's all that we've been through together means to you... ...I guess it's better if we just say goodbye, once and for all. You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments... ...that it ends here, in a health-food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny. Wait. I'm gonna go with you. I love you. What do you want? It was my first play. You know how you're always trying to get things to come out perfect in art... ...because it's real difficult in life. Interestingly, however, I did run into Annie again. It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She had moved back to New York. She was living in SoHo with some guy. And when I met her, she was dragging him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity... ...which I counted as a personal triumph. Annie and I had lunch sometime after that and... ...just kicked around old times. ~ Just to have my arms ~ ~ Around you ~ ~ Still the thrill that it was ~ ~ The day I found you ~ ~ Seems like ~ ~ Old times ~ ~ Dinner dates and flowers ~ ~ Old times ~ After that, it got pretty late and we both had to go. But it was great seeing Annie again. I realised what a terrific person she was... ...and how much fun it was just knowing her. And I thought of that old joke, you know. This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says... ...""Doc, my brother's crazy. He thinks he's a chicken."" And the doctor says, ""Well, why don't you turn him in?"" And the guy says, ""I would, but I need the eggs."" Well, I guess that's pretty much now how I feel about relationships. You know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd and... But I guess we keep going through it because most of us need the eggs. ~ You ~, I think we can begin. The first parole request for Carter ""Doc"" McCoy. Is legal counsel present? Yes, sir. I'm Eugene Stewart, representing Mr. McCoy. "" Carter McCoy, one to ten year sentence for armed robbery. "" First offense in the state of Texas.

Good luck, man. Mr. McCoy has served four years of his sentence. His record's satisfactory. Applied for parole on September fifth of this year. Remarks? I would only, once again, like to point out to the committee... ...Mr. McCoy's good behavior while a prisoner. - Notice is taken. - Thank you, sir. The board met in closed chambers last week. Have you reached a decision regarding Mr. McCoy's request for parole? Request for parole is denied. The prisoner may re-apply after one calendar year. Lock 'em up. Open the gate. Lance said to have eight hole, Gallo one, Kirksky two. Eight hole colored. Go down to the garden house, turn to your left, go to the woods. We're going on to the brush. Burn it. Take the stumps up out of the ground. Bob Field, get them dogs out there close to the trailer. One hole. Eight hole. Thirty. Thirty. Come on. - Fifteen. - Fifteen. Get them dogs in close to 'em, Bob Field. - Thirty. - Thirty. Hogfield, you go to the left and start rounding up on that brush pile. Time to go. Put it back. Catch them, this squad. Round this pile up and get it burning. Oh, man, that's just a game. Man, get on this stump. Look out, McCoy. Get your axe and come on up here and pitch in. Go to work. Go to work.

No. Doc McCoy's old lady. Jeez, is that Carol Ainsley? Shut up! How are you, Mrs. McCoy? Ready to talk about my husband, Mr. Beynon. Please sit down. So the good doctor comes up again. He asked me to come and see you. Why? Can I help? Yes, I think you can. How about a drink? Yeah, I could use one. Come on over. You'll be back, Doc. Mr. Beynon will see you the day after tomorrow. - Hi, Doc. - Hi. Feel okay? I'm a lot better off now than I was an hour ago. - You want to drive? - My driver's license has expired. Sorry I'm late. I was having my hair done, the girl was slow. You look fine. - You feel good? - Yeah. - Where do you want to go? - Take a walk. What do you want for dinner? Drinks. Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey... You okay? Pretty good. Made a trip to Oregon to see my brother and his kids. I figured it'd be the last time I'd see them... ...unless they decide to travel. How's Estelle? Fatter. You know, some things never change. Yeah, that's right. That's not all of it. It's been a long time, Doc. Did you go out much? Four years, and now the question comes up. I couldn't handle it inside. But I can now. I'm still here, Doc. It does something to you, you know. It does something to you. It does something to you in there. We've got time, Doc. We've got lots of time. Just give me a minute, baby. Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are. Really? Really. Let me make you feel good, Doctor. It's been so long. So long. Fantastic. She's here. Hey, I was gonna fix you breakfast. You were sleeping. A little ketchup. And then we have a little... Thank you. - For what? - For getting me out. It was a pleasure. Thank you, ma'am. Hey, Claude. Here's your boy. You have to be kidding. Not at all. Just a pleasant way to have lunch. Sit down. It's good to see you in them civilian clothes. It just takes a long arm, Beynon. You know, it's hard to say how those things happen. The parole board almost never changes their decision. It must be because I'm a model prisoner. This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me... ...you handle it with him. He's my brother. Back with your own people, now. I got you some professionals. I'll get my own men, Beynon. You run the job, but I run the show. And don't forget it. You've got two weeks to set it up. It's not a big bank, but it handles the cash deposits for an oil company. Over half a million dollars. It's a family bank. The brother of the bank director... ...is on the board of directors at Con-Sol Oil in Beacon City. Here's a couple of fellas I'd like you to meet. Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson. Yeah, I've heard of you. You work with Miller? You're out of touch, Doc. Miller got blown up. Where? Fort Lauderdale. - Were you with him? - Yeah. I got out. You? I was backup man on a payroll job. I'd hit some liquor stores. I drive good. I drive. Sure. I want Mexican visas and passports. They'll be ready. You boys just do your job. Carol. Bank guard, 7:59. He's early. You got a flashlight, some light batteries. A-hooks, pliers, wire cutters... What do you want all this stuff for? - I'm going on a picnic. - Going on a picnic? Well... okay. And now, ladies and gentlemen, especially you gentlemen... We very proudly present the pride and Joy of Beacon City. Our own high-stepping and high-kicking... ...Southwest Texas Ropers. Following the strutters... representing the Ladies' Auxiliary of... ...the Volunteer Fire Brigade. We have the first beautiful float... ...which consists of the Constitution in the history of the Lone Star State. Good morning. I'd like an application for a checking account, please. He goes here, follows down here. Now, this is the spot you're looking for. Here. Yeah. - Can I get a copy of this? - Yes, sir. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. Change for a $50, please. Thank you. Y'all come back and see us soon. Set your clocks for five minutes after 9:00. All right, on the nose, now. The diversionary explosions are spaced 20 seconds apart. That gives you... ...one minute and 38 seconds, before they blow. You've got a bank president, you have three tellers. And you've got a bank guard. Usually on the right as you come in. Pin him right away. Careful he doesn't panic, and go shoot somebody. You got one local police car. Now he's a rover. Shouldn't be anywhere near the vicinity when we make our hit. Traffic is usually light at that hour. There are three exits. One at Hopkins, one at Guadalupe Street... ...and then there's the alley. Will you put that away and pay attention! Now the guard carries a.38. The cops carry 357-magnums. You know what this is. This'll stop an M-2 army rifle at 50 yards. I've been working ten years without one. - Suit yourself. - Thank you. What about the vault? It's a Chambers Reilly. It's on a time lock. Opens up 20 minutes before office hours. Wire pull over? No, one-inch stuff on a three number combination. That's me. No, no. I'll handle the fine stuff. You're backup all the way. Whatever you need, brother. Right. You keep going over this. I don't want anybody lost. If we're clean, Gollie will take us across at Laredo. If we're hot, we'll have to try Laughlin's in El Paso. Aren't we going a little bit hard? That's a walk-in bank, man. A piece of cake. You don't have to be Dillinger for that one. Bang. Dillinger got killed. Not in the bank. Take it with you. Expenses. Tell Beynon I don't want any mix-ups. I make one phone call. And his people better be there. All of them. I understand. Beynon's to be alone at the drop. Only one car in the garage at the ranch and that's it. Now, I'm not gonna have the money. And she's not gonna know where it is until I know I'm clear. Got it? - He understands. - Good, good. Make sure everybody does. Okay? - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Morgan. How are you? Fine, thank you. Hold it. Come on, move it! Relax. Superior technology, my ass. Hands up! Mr. President? Up! Everybody, out this way. Come on, come on! Hurry it up! Move it! Go! Come on, move it! Come on, honey, get on it. Now just relax. Face down! Move it. Move it, honey. They're on their way. Just relax. Everybody relax. Ninety seconds. Seventy-five. Sixty-five. Fifty, brother. No! No! Stupid bastard! Take the wheel. Take the wheel. How did it go? Bad. Jackson killed the guard. Fourteen seconds till the next one goes off. Come on, come on. Shit. Where's Jackson? He didn't make it. Neither did you. ...was held up this morning shortly after opening. The bank officials state that $750,000 was taken by three masked men... ...who forced the employees... Hey, there's only $500,000 here. - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Doc? I see it. Take it easy. They're looking for three men, remember? What seems to be the problem, Officer? Okay, drive on. I'll kill him. I'll kill that mother! He's on. I'm here. Yeah? Yeah? I'm here. They checked in. Tell me about Beynon's ranch. I've never been there. When we met, it was at his office. Do you trust him? I don't figure he's gonna try to cross us. At least not until he gets his money. Well, let's just send his cut back and just get going. If we make a mistake, he's gonna burn us. You make a deal, you're better off keeping up your end. I don't want to go there. Let's do it my way. Stay here. I'll wrap it up as quick as I can. News said two people killed. Three. Rudy got ambitious. And you got him. That's right. What about your wife? Let's cut up the money, Beynon. I want to get north. She told me no one would get killed. I'm in a hurry, Beynon. You still don't get the picture, do you? And I've always heard what a smart-ass operator you was. No applause. Let's examine the situation. One. An extremely attractive woman. And there's the woman's husband. And there's a man with political influence. A man who can easily get a parole for a convict. Why should he? A simple reason, McCoy. Let's get down to it. Radio's rapping about $750,000. There's a half a million, here. A little more was taken out before. You see, my brother's the director of that bank. We had a few problems we had to iron out. Okay. We covered you... Yeah. You surely did, Doc. My old lady must've made you a lot of promises. Close. I wouldn't feel... Stupid! Why didn't you tell me, huh? Why didn't you tell me? There wasn't any way to explain it. You sent me to him, you know. What the hell do you want anyway? Goddamn you! Still no answer. Something's wrong. Come on! Come on! What's the damage? Your collarbone's broken but it's not shattered. There's no infection, yet. Those bandages ought to be changed twice a day. It's okay. I got a nurse in mind. The three of us are gonna do some traveling. We're gonna take your car to El Paso. We... we can't leave here. That's not possible. I mean, we have all of this. Is that possible, Mrs. Clinton? Just tell us what you want. What kind of a car do you drive? A Ford. We have a Ford. That's good. That's very good, Harold. You run on out and gas up the Ford. If anybody but you comes back, Harold... ...she gets her clock stopped. You do what he says, Harold. Just do as I say. You. Get a cloth. You're gonna wash me. They still may be on the way to Laredo. What about El Paso? He's a friend of Laughlin. Well, we have to cover them both. We've got to get somebody down there. Either Rudy or... ...McCoy's got a half a million bucks. - Put out the word. - What about Jack? Just dump him down a dry well, if you can find one. No, he ought to be buried proper. You just do what I tell you. Thank you, ma'am. Wendy, sit down. Two day-coach tickets to El Paso. Leaves in 45 minutes. Gate three. Thank you, ma'am. Kind of tricky, isn't it? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come over here. You don't always have to take your gun out. I'll do anything you want. Really. I will. Get rid of that nail polish. Okay. I don't like it. And get rid of that, too. What is that? Don't get any blood on me. I hate blood. Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you? No, I'm afraid not. I'd like another one. Me, neither. I'm from Orem. That's right near Salt Lake. There's about 12 people in the state who aren't Mormons, and I'm one of them. I guess that makes you kind of special. - Yeah, I guess it does. - Thank you. Hey, baby. You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you? No, I'm afraid not! That's just my luck. Listen, I hope you have a really nice trip. Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too. Where's the bag? It's in the locker. I've got the key. A man helped me open it. How long ago? Fifteen minutes ago. It's the oldest con game in the world. He switched keys with you. He'll figure you for more time. He's probably still in the station. Find him. Your attention please. The Lone Star Flyer for ...and El Paso now boarding. Your attention, please. The Lone Star Flyer for... ...El Paso now boarding on track site. - There you are, ma'am. - Thank you. You have coach number six. You've got coach number four. You have coach number two. - My aunt forgot her bag. - Yes, sir. Coach number six. Coach number four. Coach number three. - I'm gonna see somebody off. - All right. Your attention, please. Last call for the Lone Star Flyer now leaving at track site. Last call for the Lone Star Flyer now leaving at track site. That's awfully heavy. To save my life, I can't possibly lift it up there. Thank you. That's coach number one. That's coach three. Y'all gonna miss the train, you know? Car number three, right over there. All aboard! Itll be open five minutes out of the station. Tickets, please. Tickets, please. When you work on a lock, don't leave any scratches. Tickets please. Two. End of the line. I'll get you. Stick 'em up! I said, ""Stick 'em up or I'll shoot you."" Now, listen... ...I know you're a good kid. Now, get back there with your mother. Because if you don't, I'm gonna break your little arm. Okay? Your attention, please. The 7:10 Special arriving from Dallas and Fort Worth... ...has been 20 minutes delayed. Next stop: Alpine, Texas. Next stop: Alpine, Texas. Talk it up a little, Harold. It'd be good for you. Loosen you up. Something ought to loosen him up. Something ought to loosen him up. What are we going to El Paso for, Rudy? I'm looking for a suitcase. At the Laughlin Hotel. You Laughlin? Yes, sir, all the time. This is my wife and that there's Junior. Congratulations. - I need a room. - You don't have to look any farther. One thing we got here is lots of rooms. Sign right there. That'll be $5 in advance. Junior... ...show this gentleman to his room. Checking-out time is 1:00 p.m. No girls allowed in the rooms. House rules. Call the conductor. Mama, Mama, Mama... Your attention, please. Shuttle train from Alpine now arriving at track site. Shuttle train from Alpine now arriving at track site. You're all right. How did you get it back? If you're trying to get me back in Huntsville... ...you're going about it in the right way. I wouldn't worry about it, 'cause I can always get you out. I mean, I can screw every prison official in Texas, if I want to. Texas is a big state. - I can handle it. - Yeah, I bet you can. You'd do the same for me, Doc, wouldn't you? I mean, if I got caught, wouldn't you? You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things are. What are we gonna do about it? Maybe we should split up. I'll cut up the money with you. - Do you mean that? - Yeah, I mean it. Well, I don't want to. I have to stop. Not now. We have to beat that suitcase to El Paso. We'll grab a hotel room, tonight. First thing tomorrow... ...just go out and buy us another car. Then you go out, buy yourself some other clothes. And pick up some for me. Tonight, I want you to go out... You go out and get some food. Paper bag it. We'll eat it in the hotel room. What happens when they find the body? All they've got is a description. Cops need a connection to channel it, and they haven't got it. It ain't gonna do them any good. You've got it all figured out, don't you? No. There's a few of things I'm working on. Like what? Where'd you get it? It was a gift. - Chico, get Lt. Judson down here. - Yes, sir. Call a medical officer, too. Come on, boys, let's look at some photographs. Yes, sir. If Rudy was by himself, we're okay. If he worked for Beynon... ...Beynon's people will be waiting for us at Laughlin's in El Paso. You're full of ""ifs."" So are you, baby. I think you liked it with him. I think he got to you. Maybe. At least I got to him. What about this one, boys? - Yeah. Yeah, that's him! - Yeah, that's the guy! - That's the one! - That's him, all right. That's the man, Officer. That's the one you shot, Raymond. What about him? Listen, I'm a friend of the court, right? That's why I'm here. You're here because you're under arrest. Lock him up. The man has been positively identified as Carter ""Doc"" McCoy... ...only recently paroled from Huntsville Penitentiary. He is believed to be traveling with his wife, Carol Ainsley McCoy. Stay tuned for further details. How you doing there, Harold? Do I have to take it off again? The radio, off. Come on, work! Give me the news! Can't trust a thing nowadays. Tell you something. One of these days, you're gonna have to trust somebody. I trust. You want to see what I trust? ""In God I trust."" It's the words on the back of every bill. Just keep that up, Doc, and it won't matter how far we get away. 'Cause there won't be anything left between us. You understand that? Nothing. Pull over. Yes, sir. Yeah. I'd like to have a radio. One of those portables. All right, sir. We got them from $15 to $55. Take your pick. - A $15 job. - All right, sir. ...Beacon City bank robbery last week... ...where they, along with two accomplices, made off with more than three quarters... That'll be, $15.95 and 60 cents tax, sir. I'll get your change. Want your change, sir? Now we got trouble. Let's clear the car. Yes, sir, can I help you? I want a shotgun, 12-gauge pump. - How about this one right here? - Yeah, that's fine. Wrap it up. Sir, you'll have to sign this form here. And let me have a pack of those double-ought bucks. What are you going to do, knock a wall down? Sir, you'll have to... have to fill out these forms here, sir. You know what this is, don't you, mister? Yeah. All right, now wrap that up. Let's go. I don't know where they went to. Operator, get me the police. There's this car here, and the man's in there, too. You might... ...try down here or up there. I don't know. Call Willie up. That lady right there. Hold it! Right there! Get those guns out on the street. Kick them over. Now, lay down in that gutter! In the gutter! You, keep your face down! What the hell's the matter with you? Hang a ""U."" Punch it, baby. Go ahead. In there. - How much to Dallas? - Sixteen dollars. Hey, dummy! How you doing, Slim? Where you going? Mexico. How much did you pay for that thing? Come on, let's go. Here, Harold. Here. Kitty. Have a rib bone. Have another rib. Christ, Rudy... ...you ruined my skirt. Goddamn it, what'd you do that for? Jesus! Know why I did that? It makes me feel good. Stop it. Rudy! Goddamn it! Have one yourself. You have one. - Have a bone, Harold. - Have a French fry. Have a rib, Harold. Poor Harold. Those are good ribs. - Wait a minute. - Have some French fries. Wait a minute! I don't like this game, anymore. Okay. You hear me? You! You! Okay. Authorities are reportedly on the lookout for Doc McCoy and his wife, Carol. The couple is reported traveling in a late-model, gray Mercury sedan. The pair is wanted for the recent bank robbery in Beacon City, Texas... ...which netted the thieves $750,000. In the course of the robbery, two men were killed. The holdup money is still missing. Good evening. Two hamburgers. A milkshake and two coffees. - What kind of milkshake? - Chocolate. - How about some fries? - Why not? Okay. Roll it up part way, please. Bang. Shit! She made us. There's that goddamn gray Merc. Punch it! Punch it, baby! Help me shove these back. It's been ten minutes. Come on out of there. You okay? I guess so. I don't know. Well, it looks kind of deep. No scar. Don't scratch. It's liable to give you an infection. What did I tell you? It's not a game. It's all a game. - There's something I want... - I don't want to hear it. Listen! It's hard enough for me as it is! The things you said before... You might be right. Ain't gonna mean anything if we don't make it together. I don't think we can make it. I think if we ever get out of this dump, I'll just split. We've made it together so far. We've come a lot of miles but we're not close to anything. I always thought jails made people hard. Not you, boy. I mean, you're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him, you know that? Not that it makes any difference. We pick up or we leave it. We leave it here, there's no other way. No more about him. Whatever happens... ...no more about him. $8 a day, in advance. House rules. Checking-out time is 1:00 p.m. Oh, no. Would you please carry my kitty for me? - Cat? - Yeah. What's its name? Poor Little Harold. - That's a strange name for a pussy. - Yeah. That's why it's kind of hard to figure. Don't hold for it. You gotta let 'em run. Dumb those goddamn horse trainers try to rate them. Just breaks their heart. All right to put the pussy on the bed? Yeah. The Lord loves a cheerful giver. Okay, now, ""house rule."" You got two choices. - You can live or you can die. - Yes, sir. What... what do I have to do? You have to do what I tell you to do. Yes, sir. You do that and you not only get to live, but you'll make a few dollars. Yes, sir. Now, I'm expecting Doc McCoy. - You know Doc McCoy? - Yes, sir. Then you're gonna let me know the minute he gets here. Yes, sir. That's all. Rudy showed up with a broad. Laughlin's in El Paso. Rudy's there. Mexico... tonight. Two. Sure, Doc, I can do it for you. Just like old times, ain't it? Yeah. It's a nervous way to live. Hello, Jimmy. Oh, good to see you, Doc. - How's your family? - Growing fast all the time. Well, I got it all here for you. Departure and arrival. All except the $500. - I get any calls? - No, sir. My old lady will be here in about five minutes. I want you to get some food and take it to the room. Just sandwiches? Yeah, that's all right. When she comes, she'll have some luggage. Have that boy take it up to the room. Well, he took the day off. Do it yourself. I can't, Doc. I can't leave the desk. You'll be in 318, Doc, till 11:00 p.m. Nobody else is on the floor. You're by yourself. All right. Answer it. Hello? Doc McCoy just got in. Yes, sir. Get up and get dressed. Are you ready? What are you doing? - I'm coming in with you. - No. Come on, honey. Come on, baby. What's the big hurry? I'm hurrying! Five fours. What's the matter? He's a juicer. His wife and kid are always with him to keep him off the horses... ...and to keep him off the sauce. So what? So they're not here. He sent them away. Get your ass in gear, baby, and let's go. - Move it. - Okay. Who is it? It's your food, ma'am. I brought up the sandwiches. Stall. Just leave them outside the door. I'm not dressed right now. I can't do that, ma'am. You must pay now 'cause I have to pay the boy that went out to get the food. Ma'am. Listen, you're just gonna have to wait a minute. My husband's in the shower. Okay. He'll be right out. Just wait a second. Come on, it's me, open up. I don't remember. Listen, you old bastard... ...tell me what I want to hear, or I'm gonna rip... ...these fingers clear up to your elbows. Are you gonna tell me? - McCoy's in... - What room is he in? - He's in 318. - What? 318. You better not be lying to me, you old fool. Down the hall, Max. Around the rear. Oh, my God. Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Bang, bang. Rudy! Where's Rudy? Have you seen Rudy? No, I haven't seen Rudy, you dumb broad. Operator. Get me the police! Don't do it! Don't! Just run away. Just... now! Run away! - Drive! - Sure thing, mister. - Get in there. - Whatever you say. Want me to go, too? - Hey, are you hurt? - No. Straight ahead. Hang in there, now, folks. Hey, how was that one? Oh, that was fine. Just fine. Where are we heading? We're going to Mexico. Can you find a nice, quiet place? Get us through? Why in the hell not? And don't hit any more cars. I don't reckon you're gonna shoot me, are you? I kind of doubt it. Well, that's fine. Now don't you worry, I'll cooperate. Shoot, I've been in trouble with the law myself. Can I ask you a personal question? Sure. Are you kids married? Yeah. I'm glad. Damn, you know... ...that's the problem in this goddamned world. There ain't no morals. Kids figure if they ain't living together, they ain't living. Buenas tardes. Chihuahua City. Building materials. Crazy. You know, if I was you kids, what I'd do? I'd quit this running around the country. You know, get a little bit of money together... ...and I'd buy a place and settle down, and raise a family. I've been married for 35 years. Same old gal. Man, she's a tough old hide. Yeah, everything I am, I owe to her. Say... Pull over, over here, would you? Okay, whatever you say. Now what? Let's get out a spell. How much money did you make last year? I reckon about $5,000. Suppose I give you $10,000 for that truck of yours? You serious? I am. And I keep my mouth shut... ...and I don't say nothing about the truck... ...and I never seen neither one of the two of you? That's what I want. How about $20,000? How about $30,000? Goddamn, ma'am, you got a deal. Pay the man, honey. Thank you, ma'am. Now, you'll have to walk on back to the border. Oh, that's all right. Don't worry about me. I hope you find what you're looking for. Vaya con Dios. You too, ma'am. Take care, you hear? Goddamn it! Come on. Subtitles conformed by SOFTITLER, Well, it's raining and I can't get a cab, and I haven't any money anyway. What the hell? He's probably just a nice guy who wants to help a girl. Just some rich, nice-looking guy who will give me a lift home. Yeah, that's all. Nope, that ain't all. Sherman. Good evening, Mr. Rapzinsky. - What is? - Is letter. Pick up and throw in garbage. Not on nice floor. I, Rapzinsky, say this. Sorry to take you away from your basement. I know you work to keep the building on House & Garden's ""10 Best"" list. Yes, Mr. Rapzinsky? - Still making the noise. - What noise is that? Tic-tac, tic-tac. My typewriter makes that sound when I press on the keys. This is how I produce the stories and the novels I write. I am a writer. - I got complaint again. - From whom? No matter. She say you make noise. Don't make no more. I, Rapzinsky, say this. Is that all? Then I will go up to my apartment. You can go back and sit in your tire. National Weather Summary. Severe weather along the coast... ... Sunday afternoon and evening. Towering rainstorms spawn strong winds, large hail and heavy rain. Lieutenant, do you think Cole did it? It could be Cole, I don't know. I do know that... All right, all right. You're surrounded, Vincent. Give up. Rapzinsky? Mr. Sherman. Yes. I think there's something you should know. Mr. Sherman. Mr. Sherman? What do you want? - I have to see you, Mr. Sherman. - Who are you? You don't know me, but it's terribly important. Please! - We don't open the door after midnight. - We? Wolf and I. Wolf is a Doberman pinscher. Please, it's a matter of life and death. Sit, Wolf. Come on, boy, sit. Sit, Wolf, sit. Sit, Wolf. Someone chasing you? I can't discuss it through the door. - Are you alone? - Yes. - Swear. - Yes, goddamn it. Say, ""As God is my judge, I'm alone."" As God is my judge, I am a little girl all alone here in the hallway. Hello, pansy! Fink! You rat! You fruitcake! Ratfink fruitcake! - You lied about your size. - You lied about your dog. How do you know? Creeps like you don't have dogs named Wolf. You have little faggy things called Pooky and Doo-Doo. You have the wrong apartment. Don't try to cop out. I got the right one and the right fairy. - You're suffering a paranoid delusion. - What? You're extrapolating from your sordid environment. - If I weren't refined, I'd beat you. - You're insane. This from a queer who peeps in girls' windows. - What are you talking about? - A rat who squeals to the super... ...because a girl is entertaining a gentleman friend. - And accepting a large tip. - That's a confession! You're a peeping Tom. The only thing worse is a squealer, and you're both. Look, I sense that you're upset... You must have eyes like a vulture. - If you'd close your window shades... - It's too damn hot. - Friction, no doubt. - What's that? Some kind of dirty joke? Friction. Oh, yeah, I get it. Something you wouldn't know about. The guys you pick up are air-conditioned. - I'm getting angry. - Gonna claw my eyes out? - I'm getting angry. - Or get a boyfriend to beat me? - I'm angry. - Where are you going? I'm calling the police. Why does this kind of stuff always happen to me? Look, please don't do that. There's no point in crying. It doesn't solve... Who's crying? Why not return to your apartment...? - That son of a bitch threw me out. - What? - I said Raspinasky... - Rapzinsky. - He threw me out. - Threw you out? - You were gonna call the cops. - I was...? - Are you a parrot? - I said nothing about the police. I said something was going on in an apartment. Oh, why me? Or is it just girls in general that you hate? - Look, could you cry someplace else? - I'm not crying! You're getting my typewriter wet. - You're creepy. - The keys will rust. - Where would you like me to cry? - Detroit? Give me 5 bucks and I'll go find a room. Don't worry, I'll pay you back. I don't have any money. I was paid today and I didn't cash my check. That figures. Finks never have any money. What about the money your friend gave you? Raspinas... Whatever his name is, he took it. He said if I gave it to him he'd cover up with the cops. That was a despicable thing to do. Yeah. What's that mean? - What does what mean? - What you said. ""Despicable."" - It means he's a rotten person. - That's his excuse. What's yours? - What's my what? - Why did you rat on me? - Why did you complain about my typing? - That's why? - I had a bad day. - You had a bad day? I lost my job. I got thrown out. I'm broke. It's raining. I'm stuck in a crummy room with a pervert! - At least you've got your health. - Very funny. You're one hell of a... Wait a minute. - It's 3 in the morning. - You watched me with these? You're no amateur peeping Tom, you're a pro. - Not so loud. - With the naked eye, it's just dirty. When you have to work at it this hard, it's filth. You ought to be ashamed! You're disgusting! - Did you take pictures of me? - It's part of my work, my studies. - Studying to be a gynaecologist? - I'm a writer. I observe people. Writers write. Peeping Toms look through windows. Incredible. I'm being lectured to by a berserk whore. I am not a whore, you hear! I'm a model... ...and an actress! - Now you've done it. - We'll both get thrown out. - I appeared in two TV commercials. - I've appeared in magazines. - All right. Shush. - And newspapers. It's true. - Shush. All right. Hello. Hi. Hello, Mr. Rapzinsky. Yes, I know. I know. Yes, it's 3:00. A friend of... Yes, I will. Where'd you go, tootsie? Hiding under the covers from the big, bad lady? Open this door, please. - Who's out there? - It's just me, Mr. Sherman. - Who? - Sherman. Felix Sherman. - What are you doing? - I live here. - Where? - In this apartment. Don't yell at me. Do you know what time it is? - Could I climb through your window...? - Watch out! Stay where you are. Don't come any closer. I got a broom. Look, I've locked myself out. Believe me, I'm completely unarmed. He's going to expose himself! Hey, Sherman, where are you? I'm out in the hall. - What are you doing out there? - I'm locked out. - You sure it's you? - Positive. - Are you alone? - Of course I'm alone. - Swear. - What? Swear to me you are just a little fruit all alone in the hallway. Did you hurt yourself, honey? I think I've got about a dollar and a half. I'll give it to you and then you'll go away. - A whole dollar and a half. - Almost $1.75. - Now I can go to Europe. - What about the YWCA? For $1.75? That Christian the YWCA is not. If ""I, Rapzinsky"" finds out you're here, he'll throw me, Sherman, out. Wouldn't that be terrible to get thrown out in the middle of the night? I'm going to sleep. And I'll be out of here tomorrow morning... ...because I don't want to look at your face any more than I have to. Okay? - Okay. - Where's your TV? - I'm proud to say I don't have one. - I can't go to sleep without it. - Use your set. - I can't. He busted it. He came charging in and he ripped the cord out with his bare claws. I've had this set eight years. Eight years next August. If he hurt it, if any of those tubes or anything are broken... ...I swear, I'm gonna murder him. What's the matter? You expecting company? This is an expensive creation. I sent away for it. - Did it come in plain brown wrap? - It's a modelling outfit. - You model for the Boston Strangler? - If you're nice, I'll let you wear it. Let's get one thing straight, Doris. - How did you know my name? - It's written there. Who gave you permission to read my panties? Good night. Hey. What were you gonna say? Can you talk to me for a few minutes? I can't go to sleep cold turkey. We have nothing to say. We do not speak the same language. Oh, come on. I won't hurt you. - You don't have to be scared of me. - Do you mind?! - Almost caught you, didn't I? - Put down the shade and go away. Why? You think you got something special? - Got something I haven't seen? - One of the very few, no doubt. You gotta get over this terrible fear of the opposite sex. - Get out of here. - You live in a sexual twilight world... Goddamn it, I'm as normal as you are. Let me rephrase that. What are you so ashamed of? - I'm not ashamed of anything. - Oh, yeah? Oh, God. That's what I get for laughing so hard. I'm sorry I laughed. I mean, honest, cross my heart, I wasn't laughing at you, anyway. I was laughing at the situation. I mean it. I mean it, cross my heart. You're a perfectly nice-looking person. Nothing wrong with you at all. Hold your breath. It never works. Take 10 sips of water. No good. You gotta scare me. - I've got to scare you? - It's the only thing that works. - You might hiccup yourself to sleep. - It's a strain on my heart! Stop fooling around and scare me, or I'll scream. Come on. You're waiting for me to frighten you? - Put me off my guard. - Off your guard? Of course, dummy. Change the subject. Distract me. - Okay. Nice weather we're having. - It's raining. - It's warmer than this time last year. - I was in Chicago then. - Fascinating city. - It stinks! - Do I have to hiccup to death? - I'm putting you off guard. - I am! - You're expecting it. I am not expecting it. Will you come on? You're right. I was expecting it. I'm going to sleep. I don't care what you do. Good night. You dirty, heartless son of a bitch! Hey, you got anything to drink? You got any Coca-Cola? - Hey, Tinkerbell! - In the icebox. I could die, for all that pervert cares. Nobody gives a damn about anybody anymore. What's the matter with you? You crazy? For Christ's sake! I told you to scare me, not give me a heart attack. Get your hands off me, you creep. - Get her. - Up yours! This makes three. - Three what? - Three times I've been on TV. This could be your big break. - What happened? - I know this is an imposition. - What happened? - If there were any other... What happened, Felix? Felix? We've... We've been evicted. - Hello. - I'm Doris. Pleased to meet you. - I'm Barney. - I plan to take this to the courts... Why don't you tell me about it in the morning? Felix? This is a peculiar situation. Doris and I met this evening for the first time... ...although we lived in the same building. I didn't have any cash, or we would have gone to a hotel. To separate hotels. Separate rooms. You're straight, huh? I didn't... Barney, you should have told me you were entertaining. We certainly wouldn't have interrupted anything. - You want to use the bathroom? - Certainly not. Thank you, though. Thanks for everything. Listen, if there's anything I can... - Felix. - Yes? I mean, that's really your name? Felix? Is something wrong with Felix? - Kind of eeuuchy-sounding, isn't it? - I'm not familiar with ""eeuuchy."" If you could stretch your meagre vocabulary to eke out a definition... I mean, Felix is a good name for a pet snail. Thanks. I know you're not well-versed in etymology... You bet your ass I'm not. - ""Felix"" means ""happy and lucky."" - That's you. A happy, lucky snail. Thank you, Doris. - What do you mean, ""Doris""? - Doris, a helpless, hopeless hustler. I got two things to say! One, I'm not a hustler! I'm a model and an actress. I've appeared in three TV commercials. Three? You must have made another in the elevator. Okay, okay! Maybe it was two. But I've appeared in many magazines and newspapers... ...and I have been in a movie. And in between assignments, you're for rent. I've only done that a couple of times and only with respectable people... ...under emergency conditions. It's something you wouldn't understand. What is? That I may be a prostitute, but I am not promiscuous. You're right. It's a subtle distinction. I take it back. You're an example of capitalism at its most efficient. You take resources... ...add the cost of labour and sell the product for a profit. I didn't follow that, but it felt insulting. Nope. It was just a statement of the way things are. Are you planning to sleep in that position? It's a habit I got from watching TV at night. - You had two things to say to me. - I did? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I just happen to know what the name Doris means because I looked it up. So I guess you don't know everything. You don't know what the name Doris means, do you, Dr. IQ? Would you like me to tell you... ...what the name Doris means? Would you like to learn something? If it will help you sleep. The name ""Doris"" means ""a Dorian woman."" - And what is a Dorian woman? - Beats the shit out of me. Very nice. Do you want to turn out the light? - I can't go to sleep yet. - But I can. Well, you're a very fortunate person. It's nice to be able to go to sleep whenever you want to. Once I do go to sleep, I do sleep very soundly, you know. Like a log. Like a corpse. But it's very hard for me to get to sleep once I'm awake. I had this shrink once who said it was because I was afraid of dying. I don't know. I think that... I think that it... I got this... I got too much of this stuff called... ...adrenalint. That I got, you know? See, like when I'm lying very still, I can feel it, you know? Sort of... ...going up my body. In all my organs. My arms. My legs. Like energy. Like electricity. Like Lon Chaney, you know, in the Man Made Monster? Where they experiment on him by giving him big hunks of electricity... ...until he damn near glows. After he kills someone, he's put in the electric chair... ...where they give him 50,000 volts of electricity. This makes him mad as hell. So he busts loose, and when they try to grab him... ...they realize all he has to do is slip them a goose and they would fry. Can you imagine what that must be like? What is it?! Why are you doing this?! - What's the matter? - I've been up since yesterday morning. My body is yearning for sleep, desperately. I have things to do today. I would like to be awake when I do them. I am not blessed with excess adrenaline. I am cursed by the need... ...once every day or so, to close my eyes and to actually sleep. ""To actually sleep."" You've got me so punchy I'm splitting infinitives! My mind is cracking. Soon I won't be responsible for my actions! - You're a tiger when you're aroused. - Please! Please, Doris! I'm asking you, in the name of everything we hold sacred... ...go to sleep. I'm sorry, but I can't fall asleep without the TV on. It soothes me. - How about a sleeping pill? - They're too enervating. - Did you hear what I said? - What? - I said pills are too enervating. - Yes, I heard that. - You know what ""enervating"" means? - Yes, I do. People think it means the opposite of what it means. But it doesn't. - No, words rarely do. - Do what? Mean the opposite of what they mean. My God, I'm starting to talk like her! Hey, maybe you could borrow a TV set from next door? What are you doing? Then there's no way to prove my innocence? Don't worry. Before he died, the old Indian confessed. He told us everything. Everything? Yes, everything about the money. They found it where he buried it... ...next to the old cross on the hill. And about Louise. Louise, is she...? Yes, but she'll never walk again. Never? At least, not until next week when she walks down the aisle with you. But, Dad, I thought... No, no, son. Your mother and I found her years ago. A tiny thing she was, half-dead with exposure, in Samson's Gulch. - Then...? - That's right, son... ...Louise is not your sister. But that's another story. Just time for a wrap-up of tonight's headlines before we sign off. The body of writer Felix Sherman was found early this morning. Autopsy reports show the cause of death was aggravated exhaustion. And that's this evening's headlines. Tonight's sermonette deals with God's greatest gift to man: The power of sleep. Sleep that refreshes the body and nourishes the mind. Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care. Sleep that seizes minister, priest and rabbi alike... ...without regard for colour or national origin. This is FELIX-TV, the Sherman station, signing off... ...forever. That was terrific. That was really terrific! - Don't get up. - You must be a terrific writer. - Please don't get up. - I gotta get water. - Did you write for TV? - Oh, my God, she's up. - Did you write for TV? - She's up. No, I never wrote for the lobotomy box. - Did you write for movies? - No, I didn't. - That's too bad. - They don't seem to think so. I love the movies. I used to go every night to 42nd Street. But somebody was always sitting next to me, trying something weird. - Ever try reading? - That wouldn't stop them. No, I don't mean in the theatre. Did you ever try reading a book? I used to read Playboy all the time until I got mad at them. Why? Well, I posed for these terrific Playmate of the Month things, you know? - Yeah, what happened? - They sent them back. I know the feeling. Hey, Felix. You wanna fool around? No, I do not want to fool around. Okay. Want a drink of water? I know this will come as a great surprise, but I would like to sleep. - Could you tell me a story? - It's impossible. Just tell me a story and I swear I will go to sleep. What kind of story? You know, like a good movie story. Sorry, I don't know the story of The Sound of Music. Oh, no. Not that terrible thing. You thought it was terrible? Four times, I saw that terrible movie. - You must have really hated it. - Nearly killed my friend Eleanor. In the balcony of the RKO 86th Street, now torn down. - Yes? - It was playing continuous. No intermission. - Get it? - Not quite. Her bladder burst. - There's a lesson there for all of us. - What about my story? - I plan to have a nightmare. Listen in. - The stories in your suitcase? They are works in progress. Read me some of them. I'm interested. I really am. - You would not understand. - How do you know? It has no beautiful people, no hit songs, no happy ending. Maybe I can show you where you went wrong. I went wrong when I opened my front door at 2 this morning. Read me your stuff and I'll never ask anything again. I dig the sound of your voice. It's very enervating. You know what that means? Oh, I told you. Come on, read me a story. I don't want to read you my story. Isn't there any other way you can fall asleep? - I'll read you my story. - Great! I'm a terrific audience. I bet I'm asleep before page two. That would be a compliment. ""Scream. Chapter One: The City."" ""Scream."" That's the title, right? Scream? Yes. - ""The City."" - That's a wild title. Thank you. ""The city came to life. The sun spit morning into Julian's face. Traffic's symphony responded to day's downbeat... ...as a million souls wrapped in the cocoon of sleep..."" The sun spit morning? ""As a million souls wrapped in the cocoon..."" The sun spit morning into this guy's face? - That was the image, yes. - His face got morning spit into it? - I told you, you wouldn't like it. - You said I wouldn't understand it. I understand it, but I don't dislike it. I hate it! - It wasn't written for you. - Who was it written for? What right have you got to say a terrible thing like that? What are you yelling about? It's a simple metaphor, that's all. That is not all! The sun spit morning into this guy's face! We didn't wake you, did we? Oh, no. Not at all. We thought we'd go watch the garbage collectors. Get a jump on the crowd. I'm sorry if we caused you any disturbance. No, really. We planned to take a drive today in the country anyway. And since the sun has begun to spit... ...we thought we'd get out early and catch some of the morning drool. I sure hope I didn't embarrass you with your friend. Hey, that's not his old lady, is it? He's a very nice-looking person. You know, you're not so bad yourself. I'm not kidding. Hey, aren't you gonna talk to me anymore? Hello? I'm sorry if I used all that vulgar language... ...and that you got bounced out of your place. I was so goddamn... I mean gosh-darn mad. You had every right. Considering the facts, your conduct was exemplary. You sure know some big words. Language is my business. - You okay in there? - Yes. - What you doing? - Brushing my teeth. Make much money at it? Brushing my teeth isn't the attraction it used to be. - No, dummy, I meant writing. - I don't write to make money. But you'd take it if they paid? Yes, but it would be inconsistent with my aesthetic responsibilities. I understood ""with"" and ""my."" They would give me money to write their way. I want to write my way. Well, I guess they figure it's their money. Yes, I think that's the way they figure. Good night, Doris. - Why did you do that? - This is a double bed. I know. I feel selfish sleeping alone in a bed... ...when there are people in China sleeping on the ground. - I'll just make it up again. - I'll do it. - I'm quite capable of doing it myself. - Look, I unmade it. I'll make it! - I said I'll do it! I'll do it! - Look... Doris! - You kind of get to me. - Come on, Doris! - Baby, I am coming on. - I'm about to give you a thrashing! - I dig tough guys. - Violence is not me. I dig gentle guys. I know you want it. - I'm not an animal. - You'll love it. I'm not governed by my appetites. I'm an intellectual. My life is governed by my mind! - Look, baby... - I am not ""baby,"" I am Felix. I don't care about your past. I've been with guys who were ACIDC. Goddamn it, I am not ACIDC! Can't you understand that? I am totally DC! If you want to, just give me your hand. Close your eyes and pretend I'm a guy. A guy with a really screwed-up shape. Wow, that was terrific! - I'll get it. - I can get it. - I got it! - Let me do it! - You're making it tighter. - I can do it. I'm used to this. - Let me untie it. Let me help, baby. - Get it. Get it. - Let me do it. - You're making it tighter. Wait a minute. - I got it. - Give it to me. - Watch it! Watch out! - Shit! Wait a minute. Just... Oh, you mother! - Don't point down! - Wait. Come here! - Easy! All right. Okay. - Here it goes! No, that's not it. That's not it, honey. - Give me a hint. - No, no. You have to undo it. - Does it hinge or something? - Yeah. - No, that's not it. - Do I have to say a secret word? Can I please help? Let go! Don't tear it! - Is this thing a decal or something? - I'll do it! I'll do it! What do you think? Do that some more. Do that some more. Come on, baby. - Come on, baby! - I'm not ""baby."" - Keep it up, lover! - I'm not ""lover."" Yeah, come on. Good, good, good. Attaboy, attaboy. Yeah, very good. Put your hand there. Under there, yeah. - Doris, please! - Wait, let me get my leg over. Doris? Good. How does that feel? How's that feel? Is it good? Could you please refrain from talking so much? It's ruining my concentration. - What am I, a chess problem? - Just shut up! Doris, please! Please, Doris! Come on, Doris! - What's the matter? - Just a simple respect for tradition. Anything you say, Mr. Sherman. What's your last name? Waverly. Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure. It's just that you asked me so suddenly. Well, actually, I am in between names right now. I tried Wadsworth for a while, and Wellington. But, at the moment, it's Waverly. Why do you keep changing it? It's important for an actress to have a catchy name, you know? Something that the audience can remember... ...and that sounds kind of classy. Don't you think? I think it's important for an actress to have some talent... - I got talent! - I didn't mean... I got plenty of talent. Just because I don't talk good, you think I'm dumb. Doris, I am telling you, you are not dumb. - You're not just being polite? - No. Well, you're wrong. Half the time, I don't understand you. Those big words really bug me. - Big words are not intrinsically... - Again! I don't know what that means. - Why do you get angry? - Why do I get angry? Suppose I said I spent time stoobulating. What would you think? I would think that that shows you have imagination. Not anybody can make up a word like ""stubbulating."" Stoobulating. The fact that you get upset when you don't understand shows your curiosity. - Yeah, that's a great attribute. - Watch it. Quality. Hey, I really do like talking to you, you know? Thank you. I bet... ...if we had a good conversation, say, once a day... ...I could learn a hell of a lot. There are aspects of life I could learn from you. You bet your ass. - Let me ask you something... - How do you like Washington? Washington, you like it? - Well, it's an exciting town. - Washington! Doris Washington. That's very nice. Listen, Doris Washington, tell me something. I can't help being curious about... - No, never mind. - What is it? It's none of my business anyway. I'll tell you if it's none of your business. Ask me. - You've been with a great many men... - None of your business. - I understand. - Understand what? - I didn't mean to upset you. - You think that could upset me? - What are you shrieking for? - I don't shriek. I talk loud. It's not okay! What'd you have to go and ask me a question like that for? I was curious, that's all. A peculiar thing to be curious about. How would you feel if I asked you that? - I wouldn't get defensive. - Because the answer's not interesting. - You're making this very personal. - I am? I'm sorry about that. After all, the question you asked me wasn't personal! ""Tell me about the 5000 or 6000 guys you slept with."" - But, Doris, in your case... - In my case? Yeah, I'm a special case. - I didn't say anything about 6000 guys. - But that's what you were thinking! Right? - Where are you going? - None of your business. - Is the truth that disturbing? - What truth? Why don't you ask what you really wanted to ask? - What is that, pray tell? - I'll pray tell you. You want to know how you stood up to the competition. - You want to know if you passed. - If you say so, teacher. - Ordinarily, I don't handle beginners. - A pro like you wouldn't. I know what your next question would have been too... ...because it's the same dumb question every trick asks: ""Did you actually get a thrill after all the times you've done it? A piece of wood like you couldn't enjoy doing it... ...with an honest, clean-living, hotshot citizen like me."" Right? Why don't I know better? How come I never learn? I'm not gonna be treated like a thing. I am a real person named Doris Wilgus! Wilgus? Take your beady eyes off me while I tell you something. Last night, I thought something real nice was happening. You really seemed to be a nice guy and all. But I'll tell you, I fall in love all the time, so it's no big deal. You were nice for a while. You said some swell things. So it proves you're a better actor than I am. I mean, actress. You'd know more about that since your acting's done in bed. Someone's gotta know what they're doing. Sorry if I didn't measure up. Do I get graded on a scale of 10? - If you accept fractions. - Know what you need? - I'm not interested! - You need a psychiatrist... ...who might, if he has time, assemble the pieces of your jumbled mind. - Bullshit! - A technical term from the theatre? Listen, Mister Know-It-All, I did my time on the couch. - Well, if a bed isn't handy... - Very funny! Anyway, that shrink was just like you, all talk and no action. He said, ""Do what you want as long as it doesn't make you unhappy."" So I did. I didn't pay my bill. It made him mad as hell! Why didn't you let him take it out in trade? Give me a dollar, please... ...if you can manage it. Just so I can get a cab somewhere. - Where do I send it? - Forget it. - I won't. - You worked for it. - Which is more than you did. - You can earn nine or 10 more. I'll come back here. Your friend Barney will tell me. Send it to Doubleday, 53rd and Fifth. Is that where you work? At Doubleday? In a bookstore? What are you, a clerk? Hey, get a load of that! The bigtime writer is a book clerk. That makes me happy. - I'm glad something satisfies you. - Happy book-selling, Mr. Sherman. Happy streetwalking, Miss Whatever-Your-Name-ls. Maybe I'll come to the store and take a look at the two-bit book peddler... ...who will never be a writer. - How would you know? You can't read. - I'll tell you how I know! I know that you will never be a writer no matter how hard you pretend... ...because, goddamn it, the sun does not spit! The clock's stopped with less than a minute remaining. The Wolves, trailing by three, have a first down at the 25-yard line. Stop! What do you mean by that, you stupid lug? - Screw? - I beg your pardon? I'll ask him for one dress and I can explain to him... ... how I'm an actress and it'd be good for his business... ... for me to wear one of his dresses, and he'll give me one on credit. - Could you tell me...? - What, mister? - Could you tell me what time...? - What, mister? - What time does Cycle Sluts go on? - What, mister? - Cycle Sluts! - Yes, yes. - I want to see Cycle Sluts. - Sluts now. - Overcoat? - I don't have one. You want to rent one? - Let me put money down on a dress... - I'm not here to sell no dress. If you're looking for trouble, that's what you're gonna find. Relax, relax, don't get so twitchy. Where do you think you're going now? I think I'm gonna go in here for a second. Okay? Okay, but I'll give you 30 seconds to get out of there. It's getting late. - I gotta get home, know what I mean? - Me too. You're a very neat person, aren't you? Well, I believe a man's clothes are his most valuable possession. Oh, boy. - Bring her in here. - No, no. - Yeah, to the room. - No, not the room! - Don't try that, you slut. - Want some of this? - No, no, I beg of you. - Hold her while I open the door. No, no, please! You'll stay in there until you learn some discipline. What are you doing? What's that for? What are you gonna do with that? What's that thing? And what's that other thing? Where do you plan to put that? Wait! Hold it! You can't do that! No, not with both of them! You can't, I tell you! You can't! Can you? Maybe you can. My God, you could! I've got something to tell you. What? I don't know how you're gonna take this... ...but you got a right to know. Know what? I just flushed your pants down the toilet. We close in five minutes. Can I help you find something? Are you sure I can't help you? We close in four minutes. - I'm Eleanor. - I see. Don't mean much to you, does it? I don't think too much of you either. I don't figure what she sees in you. - I appreciate your honesty, but... - You're a dump. - A what? - The way you treated her... Wait a minute. The way I treated whom? - Doris. - Doris? I don't know any Dor... Oh, Doris. I get it. Doris. Eleanor, you've got the wrong dump. - They all say that. - This time, they're telling the truth. - You want Felix. - You're not Felix? Yeah, listen, they said downstairs that Felix was up here. Well, he is. - That's Felix? - Disappointing, isn't it? - He sleeping? - No, he's dead. - Come on. - No, he passed away two weeks ago. But the folks here were so fond of him that we decided to have him stuffed. - Hell of a good job, don't you think? - Cut the crap. Felix Sherman? I think so. - What have I done to deserve this? - Not much, the way I heard it. You're not...? Are you...? I'm Eleanor. - Eleanor. Barney, this is Eleanor. - Don't touch me. I got a condition. Where's Doris, Eleanor? I got a message for you. Doris does not want to see you again. That's why I came. She told me to tell you... ...that she doesn't want to talk to you again or anything. Even if you should see her on the street or in a store by accident... ...including where she is, right this minute, which is... ...having a ham sandwich at Riker's on the corner of Sixth and 57th Street. Very good. You got it all out. You ran all the way, huh? - I was wondering... - Listen, l... - What were you gonna say? - Go ahead. I was wondering where you've been staying this past week. That's what I was gonna ask you. Are you still at Barney's? - No, I've relocated temporarily. - Same here. I'm staying with my friend Eleanor. She's got this place on 14th Street. - She seems agreeable. - Yeah, yeah. Doris, I have something to say to you and it concerns both of us. And if it's not... - Who was that? - Got me. - She said ""Hello"" to you. - No, she said ""Woo-woo."" - Total strangers say ""Woo-woo"" to you? - Not until tonight. - Now look, Doris... - You look lousy, you know? - I do? - Like you haven't been sleeping. - I haven't been sleeping well. - Tried hot baths? Yes, I have. I find hot baths too enervating. Enervating? I made you laugh. One for me. I want you to understand what I'm gonna say. I have struggled for 31 years to establish... - Is that how old you are? - Yes. I have tried to establish the supremacy... ...of the intellect over the physical. You ran all the way to Riker's just to tell me that? - I didn't run. I jogged. - You could have sent a letter. - I don't know your address. - You could've given it to Eleanor. I wanted to see you again. - I want to apologize for that night. - No, that was my fault. I got mad. You were justified. I had no right in asking questions... Sure, you did. You're a writer, aren't you? Writers gotta find out stuff. If you don't ask questions... ...how are you gonna assimilate? What? I said, if you don't ask questions, how are you going to assimilate? Assimilate? Not bad, eh? - You and Your Vocabulary. - I got it at the corner apothecary. - The apothecary. - Pretty impeccable, huh? It's very impressive. I try and learn, I mean... No, I try and assimilate five new words a day. I figure pretty soon I'll be able to talk as good as you. - Wouldn't that be something? - It would be wonderful. It's always an advantage to be able to express yourself clearly. Hey, lady, want to go for a ride? I think it would be good for me as an actress too. - Yes, language... - Hey, baby, what do you say? Language is one of the tools of the actor's art. - Get rid of the four-eyed freak. - I can do things I couldn't do before... ...because I couldn't express myself sussintly. Succinctly. - Remember, language is power. - I'll remember that. - Sweetheart, we got something for you. - Would you excuse me for a moment? Jump in here. Come on. I beg your pardon, boys, but you are intruding on my privacy. Felix, come on! People are so touchy these days. You gotta watch every word. - What is it about you? - What? - Is your life always so volatile? - Who? Volatile. Volatile? Volatile. Here it is, here it is. ""Explosive. Filled with energy."" Yeah, I guess so. It's because I'm temperamental. It gets me into trouble. One time, I had a fight with this guy who wouldn't pay me. - Pay you? - It's not what you think. - I grabbed him by his smock... - Smock? - Yeah, I was... - Why was he wearing a smock? He didn't want to mess up his suit when he was on the floor. - Why was he on the floor? - So he could aim better. - Hold it! What was he aiming at? - At me. I'm trying to tell you. - Doris, I'm getting very upset. - Okay, all right! Oh, my God. Will you let go? - Jesus, you got very strong hands. - Start at the beginning, step by step. - It's not interesting. - I'll be the judge. Well, this guy, a businessman about 50 years old... ...with an office on Madison Avenue that's got this long hallway. - And? - He'd give me 50 bucks to sit... ...at the other end of the hall. - Just to sit in a chair? - Yeah, in my raincoat. - You sat there in your raincoat? - With my hands tied behind me. I see. And what was he doing? He was at his end of the hall on his hands and knees in his smock. And? I'd yell ""Bombs away!"" while he rolled hard-boiled eggs at me. Say that again. - He rolled hard-boiled eggs at me! - He rolled eggs at you? - Hard-boiled! It wasn't much! - That's disgusting. - Why? Why? - Because it's... I can't find the word. Hey, where are we, anyway? Hey, where are we? Who lives here? What is this place? Whose place is this? This is the house of Mr. And Mrs. Weyderhaus. They are the father and mother of Miss Ann Weyderhaus, a concert pianist. She is also my fiance. - You're getting married? - We went to school together. We decided we'd be married as soon as I sold my first novel. - When's that? - At this rate, next century. - Why do you say that? - Who am I to argue with publishers? - What do they know? - Something I don't, apparently. You're awful hot, you know that? How do you feel? - I think my hair is on fire. - You gotta go to bed. - Felix has to go to bed. - Don't talk weird. It scares me. - Felix is weird and he scares people. - Knock it off. I'll get your shoes. I'll tell you the trouble with Felix. Felix went to a good college... ...and took literature, but he didn't learn anything about hard-boiled eggs. Will you shut up about that? - Felix has forgotten how to do buttons. - Lift your legs. Felix will now lift his legs. - Is there a thermometer around here? - Bathroom. Point. Hey, are the Weyderhauses rich? Loaded. Open. Close. This her? Is this Miss Weyderhaus? She looks partially attractive. I can only see part of her face, but I guess she plays pretty good, huh? She debuted with the Boston Symphony last night. Is that where the family is? How is she in bed? I said, how is she in bed? - That is none of your business. - No good, huh? - Our relationship is not based on that. - What's it based on? A mutual appreciation of the arts and literature. - She doesn't want to? - Music is her whole life. - Gonna honeymoon at Sam Goody's? - I don't want to talk about it. They are very fine people. They have a very old-fashioned moral outlook. - I know the type. - I don't think you do. - You're not normal. - What do you mean? Look, 94. You gotta go to bed. - My body hates me. - Come on. In you go. - What are you going to do? - Light a fire. - What if my temperature goes down? - Don't worry, I'll get an ice pick. - Eggs. - What? - What does it mean? - What does what mean? What did you think about when he was rolling the eggs? The 50 bucks I was gonna get. Same thing when I did that coffin bit. What, I am horrified to ask, is the coffin bit? Well, see, I walk into this room and turn the lights on... ...and there's this guy lying in a coffin, you know. Hands folded, face all made up. Total corpse time, see? Suddenly, he opens his eyes and he says, ""Good evening."" And I let out a scream and that's it. Fifty bucks. Another guy wants me to wrap him in cellophane and crinkle him. Then there's one that likes me to watch him while he eats a cucumber. There's this guy who takes Polaroids of me... ...while this parakeet's walking around on my back. Doris, you're a sexual Disneyland. Well, it takes all kinds. - I'm going to L.A. - What? - I'm going to California. - Why? Well, I haven't been doing too good here, you know? That's where actresses should go. That's where the work is. Just like you stay here because you're a writer. - What's that got to do with it? - The city is what you write about. - Like in your story, Scream. - I remember how much you liked it. I've been thinking about it. I didn't get it at first. Like about the sun spitting morning. But I can really see it now. - You can? - Oh, yeah. Sure. See, the sun, like a big face... ...here it comes, here it comes... ...real slow over the edge of the world. And it looks out over the city and it goes: See what I mean? - What'd you do that for? - I'm not sure. Would you mind doing it again? I wasn't ready the first time. Don't unbuckle it. It snaps. Listen, Felix, maybe you should take it easy. Get your temperature up. It's going up. I can feel it. Yeah, but you're exhausted, remember? Parts of me are wide awake. This could be very dangerous for a person as sick as you. - I'm gonna stop any minute. - You do and I'll kill you. - Do you think she's pretty? - Who? Miss Weyderhaus, the concert pianist. - Does she have a nice body? - She's very delicate. - Oh, yeah? - Well, she's extremely fragile. She got a sticker that says, ""This end up""? Not funny. You think I'm pretty? Yes. I'm not, really. I just make you think I am. How do you do that? - It's a trick. It's hard to explain. - I don't understand. It's kind of like acting, you know. I mean, you gotta act pretty. Watch this. What about now? I look pretty, right? - Right. - Now watch this. Oh, that's amazing. That's two completely different girls. - You're putting me on. - No, I'm not. It's fantastic. What are you doing? - I'm going to make you feel good. - I know what that is. - It's gonna put you in a good mood. - I don't want to. - Don't be such a tight-ass. - I'm not. I merely believe that there are certain limits. - I'll make you a deal. - Absolutely not. Listen, a couple of hits on this and I will... - Of course, if you're not interested... - Give me that. This is to demonstrate I have a freedom of choice. I'm not square. - I am, if I wish to be, perfectly hep. - I'm hip, you're hep. How are you feeling? How come you and Miss Weyderhaus don't mess around? I told you. How come you and Miss Weyderhaus don't mess around? I told you. What, she's very fragile? She's fragile, right? She's worried about her hands. She doesn't want to hurt her hands. She could wear boxing gloves. They're very beautiful, her hands. - She oils them. - She oils them? Like the tin woodsman? Exactly. To keep them supple. - She's an extraordinary human being. - She sounds like a drag. Yes, she does. - Is that a door? - I think that was a door. Did somebody come in? - Unless one of us went out. - Felix? - That is a definite person. - Correct. Felix, are you there? - You're about to meet Mrs. Weyderhaus. - Mother, is Felix here? - And Miss Weyderhaus. - Could we put it off for a while? Anyone in there? - They're understanding. Be yourself. - I don't have much choice. Mrs. Weyderhaus, this is Doris Wellington, a friend of mine. - Hi, Mrs. Weyderhaus. - My bed is broken and... Ann Weyderhaus, I'd like you to meet Doris Washington. Hello, Miss Weyderhaus. I've heard so much about you from Felix here. - What's going on? What's up in there? - Mr. Weyderhaus, allow me to... Doris! What are you doing? Jesus Christ! That's ""Bombs away."" That's the guy with the smock. You know, the hard-boiled eggs. Where are you rushing? Jesus, you walk so fast. - Where do you think you're going? - I don't know. - Please stop following me. - I'm not. I'm just going the same way. I want to be alone now. - Will you let me explain something? - What is it? You're depressed because you're not used to smoking grass. - Yes, doctor? - And you've come down real hard. The first time I got stoned I didn't feel human. - I felt like a cockroach. - Kafka. Yeah, like a Kafka. You never know what's gonna happen. Be careful. I'm going to be extra careful not to become involved in anybody's life. - It's not good for them or me. - What about last night? - What about it? - We made love. Wasn't that good? You're confused. That was not making love. - It beat the hell out of drying dishes. - What we did was to get a fast thrill. One time is a fast thrill. Six times is making love. - I'll show you what we did. Come on. - What? Felix! Come on, I'll show you something. Come on. Look. Look over there. That's what we did, with just as little sense or purpose. - Maybe that's what we're good for. - What? Being each other's pets. Would you enjoy that? - People love their pets. - You want to be my pet? That's not such a bad idea. You could wear a collar. - I'd have to lock you up at night. - I don't understand. I could wash and bathe you. Say, we've already done that, haven't we? - I could teach you tricks. - Don't. - You could sit up, play dead. - You're scaring me. What about retrieving? That's easy. Retrieving is an easy one. - Stop it! - Here's a stick. - Stop it, Felix. - Stick. There's the stick. Okay, fetch. Fetch! Go ahead, fetch! - That's too tough? - Stop it! Let's start simple. Give me your paw. - I don't know what you want. - Be a good girl and give me your paw. - I assimilated impeccable. - Good trick. I'm teaching you another. I'm gonna have to send you to obedience school. - Give me your paw. - Why are you doing this? Pets do as they're told, otherwise they are given away. Want me to give you to some family who'll beat you? Just don't stand there, give me your paw. - If I do, will you quit? - We make no deals with pets! I'm warning you, this is your last chance. Give me your paw. Hey, Felix? - My name is not Felix. - What'd you say? I didn't hear you. - My name is not Felix. - I don't get you. My name is Fred. The person you are staring at is Fred Sherman. Not Felix. Fred. Short for Frederick. Like Washington, Wellington and Waverly... ...Felix is one more pompous notion, one more hopeless pretence. F is for Fred. It stands for fake and fraud and... Phoney? And failure. Right, that's what it really stands for... ...the good old American failure story. - Oh, Felix. - Fred, goddamn it. Give me a chance! I can't just assimilate Fred all of a sudden. Stop using words you don't understand. Use words indigenous to you. You stop using words I don't understand... ...then maybe I'll understand what I'm not supposed to understand. Where you going? Huh? What'd you do that for? - It was either him or me. - What? That was your typewriter! The son of a bitch was trying to kill me. Who was? What are you talking about? Somebody tell me what he's talking about. Don't turn around. Just stand there. Stand there and count to 50. Do what I say! Just keep counting. Now listen very carefully. My name is Fred. Fred Sherman. What's your name? Doris. - Doris what? - Doris Waverly. I'm sorry. I didn't hear that. Let me ask you again. What is your name? - Doris... - Yes? Watch it. Yes? Yes? - Wilgus? - Wilgus! What a nice name! It's very real. Yeah, it's that all right. I work in a bookstore. I'm a clerk. I'm in line for the assistant managership. - No kidding? - Yeah. Well, I work nights. I thought I'd spend my day looking for an apartment. That's a coincidence. I don't live anyplace either. - What do you do? - I'm a model and an actress. But I was formerly a hooker. I was also in two TV commercials. I thought you looked familiar. I'm very pleased to actually meet you, Miss Wilgus. Very nice to meet you, Fred. Actually, it was only one commercial. You still love me? We might even find a place with a TV set. - I never watch TV. - Really? Yeah. It's too goddamn enervating. Subtitles by SDI Media Group, This is a.44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. And it could blow your head clean off. Do you feel lucky? Mr. Ricca! How do you feel about your acquittal? It proves what I always said, I had nothing to do with Scarza's murder. Who could have killed Anthony Scarza and his family? That's a stupid question. Get off my back! Mr. Weinstein, explain the technicality involving the lack of admissible evidence. That's a legality that can't be explained at this time. Mr. Weinstein, you don't seem surprised about the decision. I don't know why they waste the taxpayers' money. This whole thing is an arbitrary attack on a legitimate businessman. - Do you have any comments? - What, dear? Do you have any other comments? I'll give you a comment: Their minds are dead. - What do you mean by that? - Their minds are dead. Mr. Ricca means he is very pleased with the decision. There's a big crowd. Do you fear for your life? No, of course not. Mr. Estabrook. As the prosecutor, how do you feel about the court's decision? It's happened before, it'll probably happen again. I have no more comments. I'm sorry, no comments. No comments! I have no comments. You know what I think? I'll tell you what I think! Fuck the courts, that's what I think! They've already wasted too much time worrying about the rights of killers! Ricca, you're a killer! Get in the car! Go on! Murderer! Today the noted labor leader Carmine Ricca... ... was acquitted on a technicality: The lack of admissible evidence. Ricca had been charged with complicity... ...in the murders of labor reformer Anthony Scarza and his family. When he appeared outside the courthouse this afternoon, a free man... ... it touched off a wild, mob-like demonstration. But the police were finally able to bring it under control... ... and there have been no reports of injuries. But one can expect an uproar from an angry and alarmed crowd... ... which fully expected Ricca to be convicted. And I'm sure we haven't heard the last of the Ricca case. Art Brown reporting from city hall. Cop. Gino, for Christ's sake. Come on, Carmine. I'm driving this thing like a baby carriage. Could I see your driver's license, please? Do you know who that is sitting back there? I'll still have to see your driver's license, please. I'll have to find it. Do you know why you're being stopped? Yes, we know, Officer, and you're making a big mistake. - You crossed a double line back there. - A double line? Take it easy. Whatever you say, Officer. I just happened to find it, sir. That's right, Simple Simon. Check, see if it's stolen. I want this bastard busted out of his job. We'll take care of this guy. You fellas, just take it easy. - This car registered to you? - To him. - I'll have to see the registration. - Come on, give me that license. That's okay. Hi, Harry. Is this your case? Walter? Hello, Harry. What are you doing here? This couldn't have happened to a nicer bunch. Ricca, Weinstein, his attorney. James Cantina, the driver. What about the bodyguard? We're checking that out now, Lieutenant. Looks like somebody saved the taxpayers a lot of money, doesn't it? Callahan, what're you doing here? You're on loan to stakeout. We had nothing hot on, besides, we were close. Callahan, you get your lying ass in gear and get back to that stake-out squad. Anything else, you call it in. - Who do you think did this, Briggs? - You're on loan to stakeout, Callahan. That's right, Lieutenant, you saw to that. I've got nothing personal against you, Callahan. But we can't have the public crying, ""police brutality""... ...every time you're on the street. You just might need me on a job like this. Whoever did this was very good at it. You'd sure be the one to know, Harry. - Well, I just work for this city, Briggs. - So do I. Longer than you. And I never had to take my gun out of its holster, once. I'm proud of that. Well, you're a good man, Lieutenant. A good man always knows his limitations. - Lt. Briggs? - Yeah? What did you get? Well, it looks like they were killed with a Magnum. The boys now are checking the blood types and for fingerprints. What do you have? Driver's license. Doesn't look at all like the usual gangster crap, does it? Briggs has his nose up his ass today. I guess he thinks that's where his promotion is. See you later, Harry. What's with you and Briggs anyway? Jealousy. He knows this is the kind of case I should be on. It's just a matter of time. Hey, Early, want to get in on this? What the hell is that about? They're giving odds on how long you'll stay alive being my partner. Are you kidding? Nope. How long did your last partner go? A couple of weeks. Don't worry, he's still alive, teaching college. You have another trade, Smith? No, no. Do you? No, but Bill Mackenzie does. Who in the hell is Bill Mackenzie? He's an ex-homicide man, has a snack shop out at the airport. Greatest burgers in town. Hungry? - How can you be hungry after seeing that? - Seeing what? So, Ricca finally bought it. There must be hope for the world yet. How about you? Do you want something? - We got chili and garlic bread today. - No, thank you. I don't feel very hungry. In broad daylight at close range? Must've looked like ripe melons. Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix, use white courtesy telephone. Now all keep calm. I'll never forget the Floyd case. Got it with an axe during the rush hour. How about some cream pie? Operations Supervisor, Mr. Phoenix, use white courtesy telephone. Must be trouble. That's the airport code name for trouble. We've got 90 people being terrorized by those maniacs... ...in boarding area B right now. What's taking so long? They said they'd be there in 15 minutes? Where's that overseas pilot? I don't understand. How did they get through security? - I don't know. - Any problems here? What are you doing here? - I'm sorry, you'll have to leave. - I'm a police officer. We've got two frantic hijackers on our New York flight. - Have you called the FBI? - They're on their way here right now. But the hijackers want an overseas pilot before they take off. May I make a suggestion? Good afternoon. You took your goddamn time about it. Now, close that door! All right, what's in there? Overseas charts and flight plans. Set it down! All right, turn around. Stay there. All right, turn around here. Here! Now get in there! - It's all yours now. - All right get this thing up! Where to? You get us up, I'll tell you where to when we're up. You want to put us in take-off position? Starting three. Move it! All right, I'll take it. That's right, Lieutenant. We were lucky to have one of your men here. He's on board now, an Inspector Callahan. Callahan! Excuse me, Captain. I know this may sound silly... ...but can you fly? No. Never had a lesson. Sit down! What are you doing here, Lieutenant? Harry! You crazy son of a bitch! I could've killed you. Yeah, I noticed that, Charlie. What the hell you doing? I haven't seen you in a coon's age. I been meaning to drop by, but we've been kind of busy. Yeah, well, I ain't living with Carol anymore. Sorry to hear that. Yeah. It's my third time at bat. Where's the time go? I'm afraid of time. I know you 10 years already, ever since I first came out here, you realize that? You don't look older to me. Do I look older to you? Why don't you put in for some desk work, Charlie? You don't need the streets anymore. We should've put our 20 in the Marines. These days, a cop kills a hoodlum on the street... ...he might as well just dump the body some place. Because those snot-nosed young bastards... ...down at the DA's office will crucify them one way or another. A hood can kill a cop, but let a cop kill a hood... Am I right? You put in plenty of time, why don't you go for retirement? What the hell, you don't need this. I know you 10 years. I'll tell you something, I'll never retire. Never! I'm going out fighting. That's the only way to go. Am I right? You boys rookies? Yes, sir. Traffic. I'm John Davis. This is Phil Sweet. That's Red Astrachan, Mike Grimes. - You're Inspector Harry Callahan, no? - That's right. What are you doing here? Don't you have regular times for this? You shouldn't be on the streets if you can't shoot well. - Killers don't make allowances. - You're in big trouble. Can't fault you there. Are you shooting in the combat championship next week? I always do. - You win every year, don't you? - Became sort of an institution around here. Yes, sir, we've heard all about you. This is about the only time I get this place alone. We'll leave if you'd like the range to yourself. No, that's all right. What kind of a load do you use in that.44? A light special. This size gun gives me better control and less recoil... ...than a.357 Magnum with wadcutters. That's not bad. Care to try? No, sir. No, I don't think so. - Come on, give it a try. - Go on, Sweet. I'm farsighted. Don't drop it. Hey, that's not bad. Well, I think it's just a little heavy for me. I missed one. You'll get used to it. Where did you learn to shoot? Not around here. No, sir, no. Airborne Rangers, Special Forces. And the rest of these guys, even close? Well, Grimes here, he's... ...I guess he's about even with me. Astrachan's a little better on a good day. And Davis is just dog nuts. He's a lot better. A lot better? Sure show a sense of style. Sweet, is it? Yes, sir. When I get back on Homicide, I hope you boys will come see me. - Good. - Thank you very much, we'd like that. Let's go! - Good night, sir. - Good night. Who buys? The sun was in my eyes! - You got to be on, Grimes. - The sun is always in your eyes. How come I always have to buy the beer for you turkeys. Where do you want to go? Put your hat on! Come on now, baby. Will you look at my ring! It's beautiful! Is this a gang war? You have nothing to say? - Do you expect more murder or violence? - I have nothing to say at this time. - Is this a gang war, Lieutenant? - No comment. There were 200 murders last year. Do you want to make a comment on that? There'll be no bombs in pools. This town belongs to the people. We're gonna have law and order here. That's all I have to say at this time. What does that mean, Lieutenant? You're it! You're it! Don't you want to play with us? - Well, I don't know, sweetheart. - Just a little while? You're really getting the full treatment. It's not often you get a sit-down dinner. Okay, kids. All right, that's enough. - Just a little bit more, just five minutes? - Let's go, let's go. Say good night to Harry and off to bed. - Good night. - Good night, my love. - Good night. - Take it easy. - 'Bye. - Good night, Harry. Take the jacket out of your mouth, sweetheart. Boy, sometimes they're too much for me. But then I can't afford a woman coming in anymore. I think you manage quite well. Well, I just laugh all day long. I'm glad you called. Tell me, have you seen Charlie? Yes, I saw him last night. Wanted to see the kids... ...and then he started playing a little Russian roulette with his revolver. What happened? What could I do? I went next door, we finally got him to stop. What do you tell your children... ...when they ask why their father tried to shoot himself? What did you tell them? I just said it was a special kind of sickness that some people have... ...and that there are doctors who could cure it... as if they could. Do you know where he's living right now? I don't know and I don't care anymore. He's so sick. He shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun. Do you know that he was living in North Beach with some nude dancer? Oh, well, I'm glad I'm over that one. I do have to survive. You will. You know, Harry, if I ask you a personal question, would you mind? Sure, go ahead. Are you sure? Because, well, it's a little difficult. Look, we've been friends a long time, go ahead and ask. Well, I'm just wondering why you've never made a pass at me. Why? Goddamn it. With all those kids do you think I'll ever get laid? Hello? Yes, just a moment. It's for you. What's happening? Yeah? Yeah, Early, I saw it on TV. I'll be right down. I'll come in the back way. - That's it, right? - I have to go. Goodnight, Harry. Goodnight, sweetheart. How's it going? By the magazine rack. The owner remembers seeing him just before the last robbery. Yeah, he doesn't look much like a paying customer, does he? - There's a car parked out in front. - That's right, a no parking zone. Get over there by the door with that shotgun. Okay. You think it'll be a hit or a miss? Well, here's three salty looking dudes. Freeze, nigger! - What you got there? - Don't you go setting off no alarm. You! Get over here, fast! - You got a safe, nigger? - No. You lying sack of shit. All right, take it easy. Take it easy now. Suck it! Suck it! I'll kill you. I said, suck it. You go find that safe. Right here is where I kill me a nigger. Get on your knees. Get on your knees. Better get out there now. Not yet. Get on your knees. Police! Drop it! All right, hold it! I never shot a man. Why don't you help the lady? It's all right, ma'am. You handled yourself real well tonight. You work close. Man, you work close. Hey, where are you guys off to? - The Downtown Bowl on Eddy Street. - Oh, yeah. See you later. - You know them? - They came from the academy after me. They stick together like fly paper. Everybody thought they were queer for each other. I'll tell you something, if the rest of you could shoot like them... ...I wouldn't care if the whole damn department was queer. Excuse me, it's very important. What do you think you're doing? 1000 O'Farrell. We're not going to get there unless you keep your eyes on the road. Right on. 1000 O'Farrell. Too bad you're not on welfare. I'd give you a freebie. Drive. - Sidney, I was just on my way to see you. - Where to? - Just keep on going until I tell you to stop. - Yes, sir. Drop that flag. - You're on your way to see me? - Yes, Sidney, honest. How come you didn't come by the crib? - Well... - Don't shit me. I wouldn't do that. - I've been waiting for you for one week. - I've been working the convention. - No telephones in that hotel? - I've been working like hell, you know? Let me show you. - See? It's all here, all I got. - AII? Looks like you've been holding out on me. No, I haven't. I've been straight with you, Sidney. You know me. Damn right I know you. Let's see how much there is in the titty bank. Hello, Mr. Green. Check out the snatch bank, too. Damn right I know you. I was gonna give it all to you, but you didn't give me a chance. Bitch, you had your chance. I was your last chance. Everybody else in town threw your black ass out. Help me! Good day, sir. Is this car registered to you? Yes, sir. This is my car. You must be new. You know who I am? I'll still have to see your license and registration, sir. I believe you were speeding coming across the bridge. Hi. Hi. What's your name? Sunny. I've been living here for six months now. It's funny I've never met you before. Well, I work a lot. I know. - You're the cop who lives upstairs. - That's right. Mind if I ask you a question? No, go ahead. What does a girl have to do to go to bed with you? Try knocking on the door. - Hi. - Hi. Do you always live in the dark? Well, you meet a better class of people in the dark sometimes. Come on in. Sit down. Harry, this is Briggs. Are you alone? No, actually, I'm entertaining a young lady friend. Put your pants back on, Callahan, and come to the city morgue right away. The morgue? What the hell for, Briggs? I'm not on homicide anymore. I'm a stake-out man now, remember? Not anymore, Callahan. You and your partner are back on homicide. This is a little dramatic, isn't it, Briggs? Not your usual style. It's meant to be, Callahan. This thing might be bigger than even we think it is. Hijacking and gambling. Trucking. Narcotics and prostitution. This is the cream in the bottle. Someone wants to put the courts out of business. So far, you've said nothing wrong. This one just came in an hour ago. Somebody wants it all. This guy was just a pimp. That's one of his girls. How did she get it? Sometime before he got hit, he poured a can of drain cleaner down her throat. That shows a certain sense of style. You're all heart, Callahan. Am I gonna have to have him leaning over my shoulder? You work with Briggs on this, Callahan. But if you ever lean out of line, so help me, I'll flop you lower than whale shit. Speaking of whale shit, what have you turned up, Briggs? Nobody in my department is sitting on their ass. See this thing, Callahan? The chief. He calls me on this all the time. Even in the can. I haven't been out of my shoes in 48 hours... ...and still we have no witnesses, not one. In these cases, there's always an officer right on top of the crime. But nobody's ever seen a thing. - Who was the officer on this one? - A patrolman, Sweet. Wasn't it, Briggs? Sweet seems like a good man. I'll get on the ballistic reports first thing in the morning. We ran all the slugs through ballistics. We'll never see those guns. It was too professional, you're wasting your time. Well, it takes me time, Briggs. A man has to know his limitations. Warm enough? You're my first cop. Guess that'll be two firsts tonight, won't it? What do the others look like? The gun was a.357 Magnum. The other bullets are all too deformed to do us any good. Hollow points, fired point-blank, you know. We were lucky to get these two. I found them in the pimp's car. .357 Magnum? Maybe it's a cop. Maybe it's Harry. Nobody hates hoodlums as much as he does. Whoever it is, he enjoys it. It's possible the man was dead with the first shot. The others were thrown in just for good measure. - He unloaded a whole magazine into him. - One big mothering hole, huh? Well, everybody has to pay something. He would have to be standing right here, this close... ...point-blank range. The driver's license and the $100 bill were out. Almost like he was showing it to a traffic cop. Yeah. From what we have, it figures somebody to be impersonating a police officer. On the cars, at least. It's been done before. This close, it would have to be somebody he would never recognize. Or never suspect. Lou Guzman, ex-meat lugger with a first-grade education. He started working for the old boss of bosses as a hitter. He controls narcotics state-wide, and now dabbles in prostitution... ...has big friends everywhere. I want Casale and DiGiorgio on him. Next. Thank you. This one is for your special talents, Callahan. Frank Palancio. Two hundred and twelve pounds. Indicted for murder 23 times, no convictions. Complains about his health now. Suffers from ulcers, migraine headaches. Dangerously violent. At one point, he was Ricca's principle assassin. If you mix it with him, he won't back off. He's all yours, Callahan. That's very nice, Lieutenant, but I don't think Palancio... I want you on him, Callahan. I'd bust Palancio for stepping on a crack on the sidewalk if I could... ...but this isn't his style. Not the cars anyway, it's too direct. Callahan, you just keep your nose pressed against Palancio's ass... ...until I get a warrant from the DA's office to bring him in. And I want the first conviction on this animal. Conviction? He's liable to be your next victim. What are you asking for, Lieutenant? I'm not asking you to follow him, Inspector. For the last goddamn time, I'm telling you. Next. Nick Royale, Palancio's No. 1 hitter. He's had good training. What's happening? Nothing, just a lot of peeping and checking, checking and peeping. I knew an old boy once who used to keep pigs under his bed. Pigs? The eating kind? The eating kind. Is all you ever think of your stomach? That's very interesting. I think we better get going. Yeah. - They're splitting up. Which one, Harry? - We'll stay with these two. Across the bridge, it's out of our jurisdiction. Yeah. Well? Stick with the money. Pull over and stop. What are you trying to do? He doesn't even know we're cops. He may panic, and besides, we don't belong over here anyway. I hope he does panic. Then I'll get him for 23 other murders. And if he doesn't... ...then I may be right about something that's been nagging at me. I sure hope I'm not. What? I don't want to be winning bets for anybody. Go a little faster, I'm on their side. - Roll down your window. - What? Are you out of your mind? - I've never been wrong yet, have I? - I don't know why I'm doing this. - Say, excuse me. Could you help us out? - What do you want? Maybe you could help us, we seem to be lost. We were looking for the entrance to San Quentin. You know where that is? It's back there. Don't you see too good? Yeah, I see fine. I just wanted to know whether you knew where San Quentin was. And you do, don't you, asshole. Get you yet, you son of a bitch. You always gotta do things your way, don't you? No wonder Briggs stays on your tail. You do things someone else's way and you take your life in your own hands. That son of a bitch Guzman! He hasn't gone out for almost 24 hours now. Hey, one of our guys took a spill. It's Charlie McCoy! Seems to be okay. Let me take a look. Yeah, he's okay. There he is. So, all you've got to do is sit around all day, Guzman? This coke is out of sight! Oh, Guzman gets the best, baby. Oh, you bitch. Don't spill it. That stuff's worth $900 an ounce. You better not spill it. Don't get so uptight. Nobody says ""don't"" to me. You understand? Nobody. I never touch the stuff. You want to put that over there now? Take over for me, will you, Ed? Damn, I wish something would happen. Take it easy. That's what stakeouts are all about. Waiting. No, please! No! Frank! - Just what the hell is going on? - Somebody killed a cop. Folks, there's been a little trouble here. Everyone stand back. Please, ma'am, move back. There's been some trouble. What happened? Everything seems to be all right, folks. What's going on? Move it, people. Please, sir, stand back. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. We won't let anything out to the press. Yes, sir. You endangered an entire investigation by trying to push something. Not to mention your own lives. You blew the whole Palancio stakeout. Instead of keeping him under surveillance as I told you to... ...you had to harass him. What do you have to say about that? What do I tell Avery? What? You tell him it's not Palancio. You tell him it's a traffic cop. A cop? That's right. A traffic cop. Are you out of your mind? Do you expect me to believe that a traffic cop... ...is killing off all the top criminals in the city? Who? It's Charlie McCoy. He's ready for the rubber gun squad. He even tried to kill himself. Charlie McCoy. Guzman was hit today. A cop was killed. It was Charlie McCoy. - McCoy? - Yes, Charlie McCoy. The only reason I don't bust you into the bag this minute... ...is I know the two of you were close friends. I was just about to call his wife. Or you can, if you want to. I know he had kids. Yeah! - Who reported it? - Davis. Davis? What happened to the DiGiorgio stake-out team? It was an accidental coincidence. Davis happened to be going by, it happens. McCoy was already dead when he got there. Any witnesses? None. - I'll make that call. - Go ahead. Harry, if it means anything coming from me, I'm sorry about Charlie. But it's Palancio, believe me. I'll have a warrant in 48 hours. You can pick him up. He's all yours. Well, thank you for coming, Harry. You sure you have to leave? I won't have any place to go for a sit-down dinner anymore. I never really did like it here very much. I always liked the change of seasons. I'm going to take him home. It's time. It's time he went home. Come on, kids, let's get in the car. It was nice of that young man to help us with the children. Goodbye, Harry. We'll all miss you. 'Bye, doll. Take them to the passenger terminal, please. It was nice of you to come out. You didn't have to do that. If I'd have been there sooner, he might still be alive. He didn't deserve to get it that way. If there's anything I can do... I feel responsible somehow. The next shooter is Callahan. Davis on deck. You sure shot the pants off of everybody with that score, Harry. I've never seen you smoother. By the way, I personally want to tell you... ...how sorry I am about what happened to Charlie. What I can't figure out, Frank, is how that kid, Davis, got in there first. You guys were right across the street. I don't have a goddamned idea, Harry. The kid came out of nowhere. We were in that garage before you could spit. Maybe I'm slowing down in my old age or something, I don't know. I want to be the first to congratulate you on what I think will be the winning score. You shaded me by seven points. The only person now who has a chance is Davis. Shoot 'em up! I think the kid beat you, Harry. It happens. Harry, he edged you by four points. That evens it up on the overall champion. You have your choice in the shoot-off. Bull's eye or combat? Combat. Out! 5:46 seconds. Score, perfect. Good luck, sir. A good guy! That last one was a good guy! 5:36 seconds. But I'm sorry, Harry, you hit a good guy. You had a bad break. I really don't deserve it. You won, didn't you? - I guess, but... - That's all that matters. You mind if I try that one? Chester, how about six? Not bad. I seem to have lost the last one. You get used to it. I can see how you would, at that. You said five minutes and I've been waiting for a half an hour. Don't you ever get hungry? - It just didn't seem like a half hour. - Yeah, well it has been. I went over to my butcher's yesterday and picked up some veal. Pops is really an artist, man. I could watch that man cut meat all day long. Why don't you come home with me and... My wife's a good cook. Have a little dinner with us. No, thanks. I just saw something that killed my appetite. We'll catch those animals with their pants down. I was going to call you at home. We got our search warrants and multiple charges. We're going to make a city-wide raid tomorrow morning. Palancio is yours. Just don't take him out head-first, Harry. I think you'll find what I want to show you in ballistics very interesting. You'll find more leads than you can shake a stick at tomorrow morning. - Good morning, Harry. Sir. - Walter. Do you mind excusing us for a few minutes? Sure. There's only two. - I wonder what happened to the others. - Federal boys have them. Well? Take a look. Close, real close. But there's still a lot of lines that don't match up. All this proves is that these two bullets... ...came from barrels with a similar twist and width of rifling. You don't think it would stand up as evidence? As it is, no. But I'll have a full comparison report made, no problem. You're probably right. Besides, it isn't necessary yet. What do you mean, ""yet""? Where'd you get that slug? - I'd just as soon not say for the time being. - Don't play games on this. Whose side are you on anyway? It's just a wild shot and I'm probably wrong. I'd like to handle it my own way. By the way, I'd like to have Davis and Sweet as my back-up squad tomorrow. They're just rookies for Christ's sake. You drum up somebody in the department who can shoot as well and I'll use them. Goddamn it, there isn't supposed to be any shooting. Besides, they don't have the experience yet for a job like this. How the hell's a man supposed to get experience if nobody gives him a chance? And Davis is the new pistol champion. Suppose they panic and start shooting? Nothing wrong with shooting, as long as the right people get shot. - Let him know who you are and keep cool. - Okay. I want you to keep an eye on Davis and Sweet. What for? Just do it, will you? All right. - You all set? - All set. We'll take off in three cars. Davis and Sweet will make the arrest. Early will cover. I'll be on the back at the pier in case anybody makes a break for it. If there'll be trouble, that's where it'll start. We're holding the other squads back until you've made your arrest. Yours is the most important, it'll be the first. We don't want any foul-ups. - Right? - Right. I'd never walk up to a door with Harry, too many people don't like him. Thanks. I needed that. - You boys ready? - Yes, sir. - Thank you for requesting us. - Sir, we won't let you down. Well, I'm depending on that. Nickie. Yeah? Who is this? What was that, Nickie? Somebody said we'll be hit in two minutes. They'll be dressed like cops. Did it sound like anybody you know? No, I couldn't tell. Ed, Chuck... ...get over to the windows. I got the water side. I'll take the street side. If they are cops, this could be a set-up. After the holes they put in Ricca you want me to wait and see? If they're cops, they'll have papers. Car coming, Frank. There's a big guy out there. - He got a uniform on? - No. He ain't no cop. Cops always come in the front door. Another car. Why didn't they come in squad cars if they're cops? That big guy's working himself around by those containers. He's got a gun out. Two uniforms in it. That ain't no cop's gun, Frank. There's a cop in uniform coming up to the door. We aren't open. Come back tomorrow. Police officers, we'd like to ask you some questions. Yeah, I'm just a watchman. Nobody's here. We're looking for Mr. Frank Palancio. Would you open the door? We have a warrant for his arrest. I said nobody's here, goddamn it! We have warrants for a search of the premises. Serve them! They got Sweet! Send some help! Quick! Cease firing. Throw your weapons out and come out with your hands behind your heads. - Bullshit! - Fuck you! You sure you don't want a local for this? Takes about seven stitches. No, thanks. Okay, it's your ass. My head, cut's on my head. Why does everybody suddenly become a comedian in here? Does he have to stay in here? No, I could stop and let the man's brains run out all over his shoes. Rogers, I don't need to have a doctor display that kind of attitude. A police officer is dead. Sorry. I got those warrants for a search of the premises, Callahan... ...not for you to become judge, jury and executioner. It was supposed to be a simple arrest. Arresting a killer like Palancio isn't always simple. People are guilty until proven... I mean... Goddamn it, you know what I mean. The city's on the edge of the worst violence in its history... ...and you have to start full-scale military operations. I didn't start shooting at anyone who didn't start shooting at me first. Each time you pull out that gun, my paperwork backs up for three months. The chief and I have already conferred on this matter. A full investigation is warranted here. What about a dead cop? - I warned you against taking them. - Sweet was killed with the first shot. Besides they were tipped off. They knew we were coming, Briggs. How? Don't hand me that crap. They knew we were coming. After 200 arrests, I know the difference. If I have my way, Callahan, you won't make another arrest as long as you live. Is that all, Lieutenant? No, that's not all. I want that slug you showed me. I ran that through ballistics, it was nothing. The rifling was totally different. It's still State's evidence. I want it anyway. Eat it. Look, Harry, if it means anything, I think you got the wrong end of the stick. - You do? - Yeah. What did they find when they got in there? Nothing. Palancio was as clean as he could possibly be. They knew we were coming, Harry. Why do you figure they opened up on us? They must've thought it was a set-up like the others. - It was. - No. It was a set-up, Early. What I'll lay on you seems so far-fetched, I can't even believe it myself. I gave up being surprised working with you anyway. Would you be surprised if I told you... ...a bunch of rookie cops were the ones who were doing all the killing? See this? I gave Briggs a phony for the time being. This is a bullet I took out of the target range. It came from Davis' gun. It matches up with the one taken out of Charlie McCoy's body. Davis? That's insane. Maybe so, but somebody tipped-off Palancio that we were coming. Wanting me killed or Palancio or hopefully both. Yeah, but Sweet died today. Sweet was sacrificed. What's more important if I'm right, I'll be sacrificed. They've gotta figure I told you, which means you'll be sacrificed. Yeah. If anything happens to me, I want you to give that to Lt. Briggs. Okay. What happens if they get us both? Then they win. It's not hard to understand how this could happen, the way things are. As incredible as it seems, there may be a sub-organization within the police force. Sort of a death squad like they had in Brazil some years back. Damn. Some nights I wake up, wonder where the hell the world's going to. I want you to take care of yourself, you understand? Hi! Hi. Jesus, what happened to your face? Nothing, just a few stitches. I was going to the market, how about if I bring back a few beers? Good, I could use a beer right about now. I've got your key, so I'll get your mail, too. All right, baby. Keep it warm. Do you have any idea how hard it is to prosecute a cop? You heroes have killed a dozen people this week. What are you gonna do next week? Kill a dozen more. Is that what you guys are all about, being heroes? All our heroes are dead. We are the first generation... ...that's learned to fight. We're simply ridding society of killers that would be caught... ...and sentenced anyway if our courts worked properly. We began with the criminals that the people know... ...so that our actions would be understood. It's not just a question of whether or not to use violence. There simply is no other way, Inspector. You of all people... ...should understand that. Either you're for us or you're against us. I'm afraid you've misjudged me. - Hi, Sunny. - Hi, Sue. No, no! Harry, what are you doing? Hey, what's going on down here? I'm taking the mailbox apart, what does it look like? - You people live here, don't you? - Yeah. What are you doing to the mailbox? Did you lose you key? Why don't you mind your own goddamn business. That's my mailbox, too. Don't you get smart with me! Tampering with the mail is a federal offense. I'm calling the police. I am the police. What? The cop that lives upstairs? What's that? Plastic explosive. A bomb? That's right. If you'd bothered me any more, we'd all be stuck to the ceiling. - Do you want to hold it? - No. I don't want to get involved. Go to your apartment and stay there. Don't open for anybody. Homicide, Lt. Briggs, Inspector Callahan calling. Callahan, where are you? Look, Briggs, I just found a bomb in my mailbox. I want you to get a man over to Early's house right away. What? I've got a bomb right here! Now get a man over to Early's, you hear me? Right. Stay right where you are. I'll be down there myself. Don't move. Yeah? Come on in. I don't like looking down one of those. Where's the bomb? Right on the dresser. All right. Let's get out of here. Avery will want to see this. You mind driving? I want to take a closer look at this thing. This thing could be activated by your mailbox key. Or by a timer. Turn right, here. Get on the freeway. The freeway? You got a new route to city hall, Lieutenant? Your gun's out of its holster, Briggs. First time? You know you're not going to city hall. The only way you're going anywhere is in a rubber bag. Let me have your gun. Now the shells. Three. You always carry three. Throw them out the window. How do you figure on pulling this off, Briggs? I run the investigation, with your record, I can make anything stick. What I can't understand is, why you of all people? A hundred years ago in this city, people did the same thing. History justified the vigilantes, we're no different. Anyone who threatens the security of the people will be executed. - Evil for evil, Harry. Retribution. - That's just fine. But how does murder fit in? When police start becoming their own executioners... ...where's it gonna end, Briggs? Pretty soon, you'll start executing people for jaywalking. And executing people for traffic violations. Then you end up executing your neighbor 'cause his dog pisses on your lawn. There isn't one man we've killed that didn't deserve what was coming to him. Yes, there is. Charlie McCoy. What would you have done? I'd have upheld the law. What the hell do you know about the law? You're a great cop, Harry. You had a chance to join the team, but you'd rather stick to the system. Briggs, I hate the goddamn system. But until someone comes along... ...with some changes that make sense, I'll stick with it. You're about to become extinct. Get off at the next exit. Red? Red? Briggs was right. You guys don't have enough experience. Just hold it right there, Callahan. No tricks. Your organization's through, Briggs. There's a lot more where they came from, believe me. Move out of the way. Move it! Uphold the law. You just killed three police officers, Harry. And the only reason I'm not gonna kill you... ...is because I'm gonna prosecute you with your own system. It'll be my word against yours. And who's gonna believe you? You're a killer, Harry. A maniac! A man's got to know his limitations., How we doing, Richard? We should pass over the English coast 15 minutes ahead of time, sir. Well, with this load on our back, that's good going. Just trust the RAF, sir. - What the hell is that? - The shuttle ignition. Disappeared? And what happened to the Moonraker? Good God. Yes, yes, of course, Minister. Right away. Moneypenny, is 007 back from that African job? He's on his last leg, sir. Any higher, Mr. Bond, my ears will pop. I don't think I'm ever going to fly with anyone else. You're so right, Mr. Bond. This is where we leave you, Mr. Bond. A little premature, isn't it? Enjoy your flight. - Good morning, Moneypenny. - James. But why are you so late? I fell out of an airplane without a parachute. - Who's in there? - Q and the Minister of Defense. You don't believe me, do you? - And you should go right in. - Yes, Moneypenny. - 007. At last. - Good morning, sir. I think you know Frederick Gray, Minister of Defense. - Commander. - Minister. Q. Moonraker? - What do you know about Moonraker? - What I read in the newspaper, sir. Then you'll know that Moonraker, the space shuttle, was being flown over here on loan from the Americans on the back of a 747. Yes, which crashed somewhere in the Yukon, aircraft and shuttle totally destroyed, correct? - That's the official version. - The truth is rather more disturbing, 007. Look at this. Now, that's the scene of the crash. Wreckage strewn over a large area. That's all that's left of the fuselage. We've been through it with a fine-toothed comb, but there's no sign of Moonraker, not a trace. Are you suggesting the shuttle was hijacked in midair? That's for you to find out, 007. The shuttles are built in California by Drax Industries. Yes. We were responsible for the safety of that shuttle, Commander. The United States government is justifiably concerned. I can imagine. Then, California must be the place to start. - I agree. - Don't make any mistakes, 007. The situation is critical. We've got to find that shuttle. Yes, sir. If that's all, gentlemen... Just a minute, 007. I've got something for you. Roll up your right sleeve, will you? This is now being issued as standard equipment. Strap it on your wrist. It's activated by nerve impulses from the wrist muscles. Like this? Oh, thank you, 007. - Be careful, will you? - Yes, Q. Ten darts, five blue-tipped with armor piercing heads, five red-tipped, cyanide coated, causing death in 30 seconds. Very novel, Q. You must get them in the stores for Christmas. Good morning, gentlemen. - Welcome to California, Mr. Bond. - I like it already. My name is Corinne Dufour. Oh, and you're going to be showing me around, are you, Corinne? No. I'm just a humble pilot in the service of the Drax Corporation. This is the Drax estate now. Everything you see belongs to Mr. Drax. - Owns a lot, doesn't he? - What he doesn't own, he doesn't want. We're approaching the main complex now. That's where the Moonraker shuttle is made? That's right, workshops, hangars, design and experimental blocks, test centers, everything. Very impressive. I'd heard that Hugo Drax is obsessed with the conquest of space. Now, I can believe it. Good Lord. The Drax residence. Every stone brought from France. - Cute, isn't it? - Magnificent. Why didn't he buy the Eiffel Tower as well? He did, but the French government refused him an export permit. Look there. Those are the astronaut trainees. Mr. Drax is financing the entire training program out of his own pocket. He seems to have an eye for a good investment. Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond in the drawing room, Miss Dufour. - Thank you, Cavendish. - This way, please, sir. Mr. Bond, sir. - Mr. Bond. - Mr. Drax. Allow me to present, before they leave us, Countess Lubinski, Lady Victoria Devon, Mr. Bond. How do you do? Well, my dear fellow, your reputation precedes you, of course. I'm honored that your government should send you on so delicate a mission. Delicate, Mr. Drax? Well, to apologize in person for the loss of my space shuttle. How would Oscar Wilde have put it? ""To lose one aircraft may be regarded as a misfortune,"" ""to lose two seems like carelessness."" Well, an apology will be made to the American government, Mr. Drax, when we've discovered why there was no trace of the Moonraker in that wreckage. And your loyalty commands respect, Mr. Bond. You have arrived at a propitious moment, coincident with your country's one indisputable contribution to Western civilization. Afternoon tea. - May I press you to a cucumber sandwich? - Thank you, no, nothing at all. The shuttle, is it made entirely here in California? No. I own a number of subsidiaries throughout the world, producing components. The conquest of space represents an investment in the future of the entire human race, Mr. Bond. It is, therefore, logical to seek out the best that each nation has to offer. - Are you referring to people or skills? - Both, Mr. Bond. - Am I too soon? - Not at all. I'm sure Mr. Bond is eager to start his tour. Miss Dufour will escort you to Dr. Goodhead who will show you around. Ask anything you like. - Thank you for being so cooperative. - A pleasure. Look after Mr. Bond. See that some harm comes to him. You'll find Dr. Goodhead first on the right. - Oh. Thank you for the ride. - Call on me if you need anything. Good afternoon. - Can I help you? - Yes. My name is Bond. James Bond. I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead. - You just found her. - A woman. Your powers of observation do you credit, Mr. Bond. James, to my friends. Holly Goodhead. - Are you training to be an astronaut? - I'm fully trained. On loan from NASA, the Space Administration. Well, Mr. Bond, I guess we'd better get started. You don't want to lose time as well as a space shuttle, do you? This is it, the Moonraker. Capable of being launched into space by rocket... Orbiting the Earth and reentering the atmosphere to land like any conventional aircraft. This is the centrifuge training. It simulates the gravity force you feel when shot into space. The speed is controlled by the instructor from up there. Why not try it? Why not? - Strap yourself in firmly. - Yes, Doctor. Now your arms. That's to prevent you from knocking yourself out. I see. How fast does it go? It can go up to 20 Gs, but that would be fatal. Three Gs is equivalent to take-off pressure. Most people pass out at seven. You make a great saleswoman. You don't have to worry. This is what we call a ""Chicken Switch."" You just keep your finger on that button, the moment the pressure gets too much for you, release the button - and the power's cut off. - Just like that? Come on, Mr. Bond. A 70- year-old can take 3 Gs. Well, the trouble is there is never a 70- year-old around when you need one. - You want me? - Mr. Drax says to telephone him. All right, I'll call him from my office. You go ahead. I'll be right back. The instructor will supervise the session. Enjoy yourself. Yes. We're taking good care of him. I don't know what could've happened. Something must've gone wrong with the controls. Let me help you. My mother gave me a list of things not to do on a first date. Maybe you won't need it. That's not what I came for. No. What do you want then? Would your feelings be shattered if I were to say information? - Why should I tell you anything? - Why, indeed? You presume a great deal, Mr. Bond. What goes on here besides the manufacture of Moonraker? And the astronaut training program? There are other laboratories, but not much is happening now. No? They were working on something very secret, but everything's been moved. Where to? I don't know. What about that list of your mother's? I never learned to read. What are you doing? You whetted my appetite for information. Is there a safe in here? Thank you. James, no. That's amazing. There you are, you see? You have a heart of gold. Eighteen karat. You must go. Well, you go first. I'll turn off the lights. Thank you. - Take care of yourself. - And you. My dear Bond. This is Mademoiselle Deladier and La Signorina del Mateo. - Ladies. - I'll see you at lunch. A pity you leave us. Such good sport. Unless you're a pheasant. Really, Mr. Bond. Take my gun, a stray bird may fly over. I only stopped to thank you for your hospitality. Fraser will get you to the airport in plenty of time. Come now. - I doubt if I'm in your class. - Oh, you're too modest, Mr. Bond. Over there. You missed, Mr. Bond. Did I? As you said, such good sport. You called for me, Mr. Drax. You were with Bond last night in my study. No, I... - You showed him the safe. - I didn't. I'm terminating your employment. You will leave immediately. Franco, I'll call you to tell you where to meet me. Could I interest you in something? Why, I'm tempted to say yes immediately. But I think maybe I'd better have a look around. Please. Go anywhere you wish. And in 1955, the Venini Museum and Glass Works was taken over by Drax Industries. And here, ladies and gentlemen, we have some of the rarest examples of the glassblower's art. As you know, everything was done absolutely by hand. Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati, sometime between 1850 and 1860. If you'd like to follow me over here. This exquisite bowl was fashioned about 1520, over 450 years ago. If it ever came on the market, it would certainly fetch a price in excess of one million American dollars. But if any of you are thinking of taking it... Now, we have here a very early 17th century dish with an aquamarine medallion. Over here, we have something very, very interesting. This glass-handled sword, the only one of its kind in the world, was owned by General Menotti in the late 18th century and is the work of Bruno... 14th century. Dr. Goodhead. I can only hope your presence here is a coincidence, Mr. Bond. - I dislike being spied on. - Well, don't we all? You're staying at the Danieli, aren't you? - Yes. How did you know? - Well, I like to keep abreast of things. May I ask what you're doing in Venice? I'm addressing a seminar of the European Space Commission. My, heavy stuff. But there again, I keep forgetting that you are more than just a very beautiful woman. If you're trying to be ingratiating, Mr. Bond, don't bother. I have more important things on my mind. That's what I'd like to talk to you about. - Dinner this evening? - This evening I'm giving my address. Well, then, can you think of reason why we don't have a drink afterwards? Not immediately. But I'm sure I shall. Franco. Play it again, Sam. - What the hell are you doing here? - Convalescing. Your friend Cha just tried to kill me. And you think I had something to do with it? Well, the thought had flashed across my mind. - What's Drax up to in that laboratory? - Why don't you ask him yourself? - You leaving me your telephone number? - I don't see the point. Now I do. Not what I want to get stuck with tonight. James, why don't you pour yourself a drink? Thank you. Daily diary. Fairly deadly diary. Bollinger. If it's '69, you were expecting me. Trifle overpowering, your scent. Standard CIA equipment. And the CIA placed you with Drax, correct? - Very astute of you, James. - Oh, not really. I have friends in low places. Could this possibly be the moment for us to pool our resources? It could have its compensations. Where are you planning on going from here? I'm not planning on going anywhere. Oh, I suppose you're right, Holly. We would be better off working together. - Detente? - Agreed. - Understanding? - Possibly. - Cooperation? - Maybe. - Trust? - Out of the question. Send the night porter up for my bags immediately, please. I hope you know what you're doing, Bond. I've played bridge with this fellow Drax. 007 doesn't usually push the panic button unless it's something serious. - I should hope not. - Good morning, Inspector. - Good morning. - I see you've covered everything - with our Italian friends. - Yes, sir. - Is this it? - Yes, sir. Gas masks? We can't afford to take any chances, Minister. Frederick Gray. What a surprise. And in distinguished company, all wearing gas masks. You must excuse me, gentlemen, not being English, I sometimes find your sense of humor rather difficult to follow. On behalf of the British government, I apologize. I think you owe us an explanation, 007. I've never been so humiliated in my life. Your man should be taken off the assignment. I'll see you at the consulate. I'll have to do what he says. Well, before you do that, sir, have Q do an analysis of this. I took it from the laboratory. Tell him to exercise extreme caution. It is lethal. So, there was a laboratory. You better take two weeks leave of absence, 007. Do have any thoughts about where you might go? I've always had a hankering to go to Rio, sir. I think I can recall your mentioning it. 007, no slipups or we're both in trouble. Yes, a minor crisis has been averted. No, no, nothing serious, but all merchandise is to be rerouted as from today. Now, regarding a replacement for Cha, do you have someone in mind? Oh, yes, well, if you can get him, of course. Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro now boarding, gate number seven. Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond. - The President Suite. - Really? Well, don't bother showing me the rest. If I get lost, I'll take a cab. - Do you come with the suite? - It depends who's renting it. Vodka martini? Shaken not stirred. Why were you following me from the airport? I was trying to meet you. My name is Manuela. I work for Station VH. We have been asked to assist you. M thinks of everything. Tell me, Manuela, do the initials C and W mean anything to you? C and W? Yes, Carlos and Wilmsberg. They are very big importers in Rio. A subsidiary of the Drax Group, I believe. They have a warehouse on Carioca Avenue. I'd like to pay it a discreet visit tonight. Tonight? I think you may find that a little difficult. Difficult or not, it's something we have to do. And meanwhile, how do you kill five hours in Rio if you don't samba? - There's the warehouse. - And not a soul about. - I think there's a way around the back. - Good thinking. This is it. Don't talk to any strange men. I'll be back. - Are you all right? - Yes, but I'd rather dance with you. I did tell you not to talk to any strange men. - Did you find anything in there? - Only this. ""Drax Air Freight."" Do you know which airport they operate from? Yes. San Pietro. Do you want me to take you there? No, I think you need some rest. - Come on. I'll drop you off. - Okay. - Haven't we met before somewhere? - The face is familiar, as is the manner. It's become distinctly chilly since Venice. Well, that was before you walked out on me. Yes, nearly tripping over your suitcase on the way through the door. So? So why waste time working against each other? I've checked Drax's warehouse in town. It's empty. That's no surprise. Since I've been here, those planes have been taking off every two hours. - Yes. He's moving out. - Where to? That's what we're going to find out, now that we're working together. - I still don't know if I trust you. - I don't know if I trust you either. That's what makes it more exciting, doesn't it? - What's wrong? - I don't know. But I'm sure we're better off out than in. Bring that chain. - Hang on, James. - The thought had occurred to me. I might have guessed. - Do you know him? - Not socially. His name's Jaws. He kills people. Here, give me the chain. Come on. Hang on to me. Jump. - Have you broken something? - Only my tailor's heart. - What was that for? - For saving my life. Remind me to do it more often. Oh, thank you, but we're in great shape. Sorry about that. James! You look as though you've just fallen off a mountain. Well, it's funny you should say that, Moneypenny. As a matter of fact, I was in a cable car and... - Never mind. - The other courtyard. - There you are, 007. - Balls, Q? Bolas, 007. - Good. Have that ready for Army Day. - Yes, sir. - Where's M? - He's in the office over there. This way. - Good morning, 007. - Good morning, sir. - You're just in time. Sit down. - Thank you, sir. - Q's come up with something. - Splendid. - Any news of Dr. Goodhead? - Afraid not. Right, Q. Well, it's a breakdown on that phial of liquid you picked up in Venice. - You know, you seem to be right, 007. - Thank you. It's a highly toxic nerve gas that appears to have no effect on animals. May I see the formula? It's a chemical formula of a plant. Orchideae anegra. A very rare orchid indeed. Yes. It was thought to be extinct. Until a missionary brought one back from the upper reaches of the Amazoco. Well, actually he brought it back from the area of the River Tapirape. Well done, James. You better get up there and fast. And I've got something to get him there, if 007 can be trusted to look after it. Mr. Bond, you defy all my attempts to plan an amusing death for you. You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond. Why did you break off the encounter with my pet python? I discovered he had a crush on me. Jaws. Moonraker One on preset launch program, minus two minutes. Retract crew access arm. CAA retracted. - Transfer orbiter power. - Internal power transferred. Activate hydraulics. - Hydraulics activated. - Activate auxiliary power unit. - APU activated. - LH2 replenish. - Status confirmed. - Pressurize MPS helium tanks. Helium flight pressure confirmed. What exactly are you up to here, Drax? - And why the orchids? - The curse of a civilization. It was neither war nor pestilence that wiped out the race who built the great city lying around us. It was their reverence for this lovely flower. Because long-term exposure to its pollen caused sterility. Correct, Mr. Bond. As you discovered, I have improved upon sterility. Those same seeds now yield death. Not, of course, to animals or plant life. One must preserve the balance of nature. Moonraker launch program now commencing. Minus 20 seconds. - SRB gimbal profile. - Activated. - Cooling pumps. - On. - IMU to inertial. - IMU confirmed. Moonraker One, liftoff. We have liftoff. Moonraker Two, T minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Main engine start. Moonraker Two, liftoff. - Moonraker Three. - Moonraker Three, liftoff. - Moonraker Two, confirm program pitch. - PP confirmed. Moonraker Four on preset launch program. Moonraker Four, liftoff. Moonraker One, SRB jettison. We have separation. Confirmed. Moonraker Three, confirm program pitch. Moonraker Five, on preset launch program. - Minus ten... - Drax, one more thing. You delivered a shuttle to the U.S. government, then you hijacked it. Why? Because I needed it. One of my own Moonrakers developed a fault during assembly. Now, you have distracted me enough. Jaws, Mr. Bond must be cold after his swim. Place him where he can be assured of warmth. - Confirmed. - Moonraker Two, go for orbit. Velocity, 1,000 feet per second. - All systems... - SRB jettison. Separation motors fired. Moonraker Five, cleared for launch. James. Thank God, you're safe. Moonraker Five, transfer orbiter power. Hydraulics activated. - Activate auxiliary power unit. - APU activated. - LH2 replenish. - Confirm. Even in death, my munificence is boundless. When this rocket lifts off, I shall be leaving you in your own private crematorium. Mr. Bond, Dr. Goodhead, I bid you farewell. - EPS, power on. - EPS, power confirmed. Come on, the air vent. Fuel tanks go, and go. Moonraker Five, preset. External LH2 pressure. - Retract crew access arm. - CAA retracted. Get back quick. T minus ten seconds, nine, seven, - six, five, four... - Bang on time. - Four, three, two... - Come on, quick. Straight on. Moonraker Six, astro-technicians prepare to embark. I repeat, Moonraker Six astro-technicians, prepare to embark. - Moonraker Five crew. - All systems go. Moonraker Six, start launch sequence. - Go for orbit. - Confirm. We have separation. Moonraker Five ground crew stand down. Thrust 6.8 million pounds. We're going the wrong way. Moonraker Six, preset launch program completed. Pilots proceed from base to launch area. Shuttle go. Boosters go. Launch pad go. - External LO2 pressure? - Confirmed, 21 psia. - External LH2 pressure? - Confirmed, 42.5 psia. - IECF to internal power. - CAA retracted. Moonraker Six cleared for launch. T minus 10 seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, go. It's all right. We're on a prearranged flight program. That's Drax in Moonraker Five. - What about the others? - I don't know. Let's see. We're all on parallel courses. So, we must be headed for a rendezvous in orbit. Let's see what cargo we have. - The animals went in two by two. - What do you mean by that? Noah's Ark. This operation. We're converging. - Control rockets? - Yes, we're slowing down. What's that? There's no image on the radar scanner. An entire city in space and still nothing on the radar scanner. - So nobody on Earth knows it's there. - Right. Drax must have a radar-jamming system. All Moonrakers prepare to initiate docking procedures and continue radio silence. Moonraker Six, you are now in manual. Initiate docking sequence. All shuttles now docked. Execute station activation procedure. Gravity, normal conditions. Life-support system, nominal. Moonraker Six technicians, commence operational sequence. - Sequence four initiated. - Check airlock seals. ALS secure. All personnel to Command satellite. All personnel to Command satellite. All crews to M5 segment. Moonraker Six technicians to M2 segment. Moonraker One and Three to M1 segment. Moonraker Four and Five to M4 segment. Moonraker Two to M5 segment. Units four and seven, man console as planned. Units one, three, five and six, assume pre-assigned stations. - Pressure on-line? - Confirmed. - Life support? - Normal. Those are the globes I saw in Venice with the nerve gas phials inside. First there was a dream. Now there is reality. Here in the untainted cradle of the heavens will be created a new super-race, a race of perfect physical specimens. You have been selected as its progenitors, like gods. Your offspring will return to Earth and shape it in their image. You have all served in humble capacities in my terrestrial empire. Your seed, like yourselves, will pay deference to the ultimate dynasty which I alone have created. From their first day on Earth they will be able to look up and know that there is law and order in the heavens. All units, start Operation Orchid. If we were visible from Earth, they'd investigate. Where do you suppose that radar-jamming system is? We didn't pass anything on the way here, so let's try this way. Station two, check coordinates, mode four. Initiate globe launch timing sequence. Orbital communicator, level 10. Zero gravity. This is it, the radar-jamming system. - Coordinate conversion program. - Check. - Side lobe gain. - Check. - Spectral response. - Check. - Spin stabilizer correction factor. - Okay. Gigahertz reflector efficiency. Solar photon screen. Where did you learn to fight like that? NASA? No, Vassar. - Switched off? - Permanently. Now we can be spotted from Earth. - This doesn't look good at all. - It's over 200 meters in diameter. Yes, yes. Will you please listen, General Gogol? We didn't put it up there. Neither did we, Colonel Scott. So what are you suggesting? We've taken action already. We're sending up a vehicle to intercept. Very well, but if we don't hear from you in the next 12 hours we take action ourselves and hold you responsible for the consequences. We'll be in touch, General. - Sorry to have woken you. - I was already awake. How can I sleep? Nothing but problems. Problems, problems. Marine astronauts to launch pad. - Launch pre-program complete, sir. - Launch globe number one. T.D.R.S.S. reports a launch, sir. Continental U.S.A. Vandenberg. There are no launches scheduled. Check radar-jamming system. Well? Jamming power supply and backup have failed, sir. - Investigate immediately. - Investigate number 28, immediately. James Bond. You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season. I didn't think there were any seasons in space. As far as you're concerned, only winter. And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead. Despite your efforts, my finely wrought dream approaches its fulfillment. Your dream, whatever sort of nightmare it is, hasn't a chance, Drax. You think not? We shall see. We're coming up to second launch position. Launch globe number two. No doubt you have realized the splendor of my conception. First, a necklace of death about the Earth. 50 globes, each releasing its nerve gas over a designated area, each capable of killing 100 million people. And the human race as you know it will cease to exist. Then a rebirth, a new world. U.S. spacecraft on course to intercept us, sir. Activate laser. Prepare to destroy spacecraft. You see, my dear Bond, we're well able to protect ourselves against all enemies. Allow me to introduce you to the airlock chamber. Observe, Mr. Bond, your route from this world to the next. And you, Dr. Goodhead. Your desire to be America's first woman in space will shortly be fulfilled. Leaving you on your flying stud farm, conceiving your new master race? If you like, yes. And of course, anyone not measuring up to your standards of physical perfection - will be exterminated. - Certainly. Interesting. Most interesting. Jaws, expel them. Jaws! You obey me! Expel them! Hold them! Sir, U.S. spacecraft, three minutes to intercept. Stand by to laser it. - Initiate firing sequence. - Initiating. U.S. spacecraft in laser range, 25.5 and closing. Range 15. Range 10. Prepare to fire. Five, four, three, two... It's stopped rotating. Open the cargo doors. Number one platoon, EVA. Number one platoon, EVA. Let's try docking. Colonel Scott will take the first landing! Intruders have docked at satellite seven, sir. Double the guard at every entrance in this satellite. Report intruders' progress throughout the space station. Number three globe ready for launching, sir. Proceed! Group One, attack enemy. All units shoot to kill. - Colonel Scott, don't shoot. - Hold your fire. Corridor five penetrated. Intruders advancing on Command satellite. Maintenance crew needed, section three. At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery. Desolated, Mr. Bond? Heartbroken, Mr. Drax. Allow me. Take a giant step for mankind. - Where's Drax? - He had to fly. How's Scott doing? He's got control of the Command satellite. We put the launching gear for the globes out of action. When the station breaks up, they'll disintegrate. They'll harm no one. But the three that have gone, they'll kill millions. Those three must be destroyed. Come on! Colonel, get your men off as quickly as possible. Your mission is completed. Sergeant, round up your men, get them back to the shuttle. Fast! Back to the shuttle, everybody! On the double! Moonraker Five, that's the answer. Drax's shuttle is armed with a laser. We can track those globes and destroy them. It's hopeless, sir. The corridor's blocked. They can't get to us now. All right, let's go. Docking release system is jammed. Release the door lock. I'll see if I can operate it manually. It's jammed too. Well, here's to us. Jaws, we can't disengage. The docking release system is jammed. Can you help us? We're free. Don't worry, they'll make it. It's only 100 miles to Earth. Let's get a read-out on those globes. I have the three globes on the screen. We should have a visual in a minute. There it is. The laser's on automatic. Code 945 set. One down, two to go. Number two straight ahead. What is it? We're skipping on the Earth's atmosphere. In range. - We should see the last one soon. - There it is. - It's getting hot. - It can't be helped. I'm coming in at a steeper angle than I should in order to catch that last globe. I can't hold this course much longer. We'll break up at 200,000 feet. Just a few seconds more. Automatic firing system negative. Must be the heat. Switching to manual. Controls aren't responding. - The wings are beginning to glow. - Just hold her steady. Steady. It's entering Earth's atmosphere! James, this is our last chance. Steady. Colonel Scott reports picking up two survivors from the space station, a tall man and a short blonde woman. Right. Okay. Dr. Goodhead reported their position 20 minutes ago. They're just coming into range of our tracking ship in the Pacific Ocean. We should have audiovisual within a few minutes from the remote onboard TV monitors. Houston calling Dr. Goodhead. Houston calling. Confirm your position. As this is the first joint venture between our two countries, I'm having it patched directly to the White House and Buckingham Palace. Well, I'm sure Her Majesty will be fascinated. - We have audiovisual. - At last. - My God, what's Bond doing? I think he's attempting re-entry, sir. - James? - I think it may be time to go home. Take me round the world one more time. Why not?,  Of all the boys I've known And I've known some   First met you, was lonesome   You came in sight And my heart grew light   The world was new to me   You're swell   I'll admit you deserve Expressions that fit you   Racked my brain Hoping to explain   The things that you do to me   Bei mir bist du schn   Again and again   Means you're the fairest In the land   I could say bella, bella   Even sehr wunderbar   Each language only Helps to show   How wonderful you are   I've tried to explain Bei mir bist do schn  What do you know, boys? Hey, Papi, get over here. I got someone I want you to meet. Roland Legrand. Caught this fuckin' goat singing like a canary to the police. This is what happens when you cross me. Get this piece of shit outta here. So, what do you got for me? Piece of cake. Just like you said. You pocket any for yourself? Yeah, just a couple of big ones. You sure got some balls on you. You try to hustle me, and I'll cut 'em the fuck off. Good for 10,000.  Zulu man is feeling blue   Hear his heart beat A little tattoo   Diga diga doo, diga doo doo   Diga diga doo, diga doo   You love me and I love you   When you love It's natural to   Diga diga doo, diga doo doo   Diga diga doo, diga doo   Well, I'm so very Diga diga doo by you   By nature  Did you have a good night? - Yep. - At least you did. Maybe this'll cheer you up. Take it. It's for you. A couple of the big ones for us. You're crazy. - Where you goin'? - Castili doesn't want me leaving early. To hell with Castili. Let's go have some fun. Turn that frown upside-down. I know you wanna have some fun. I love you. Say that again. Slower. I... love... you. I want a house. In the countryside, like where you grew up. You make it sound so nice, riding your little horsey around. Let's go today. How am I gonna earn in the country? There's nothing to steal. We'll get jobs. I made more last night than most people in the country make in a year. Gimme six months. I'll be making more money than Castili and all those bums. Hey. I don't want to wait six months. I'm here for the rent. All right. I'm comin', I'm comin'. - It's him. - What the fuck? You're under arrest for the murder of Roland Legrand. What are you talkin' about? Well, he was murdered last night. A witness identified you. The pimp, Roland Legrand. You know him, right? - You got the wrong guy, pal. I was with her all night. - Come on. Let's go. - All right. Let me get dressed. - No, no, no, no. We got some stripes at the station for you, pretty boy. This is bullshit. - I didn't kill anyone. - You can't do that. - He was with me! - Nennete, relax. - They got nothin'. - Nobody believes a whore. - Nennete! - Get back in your room. Honestly, I'll be back in no time. - Papi! Papi! - Don't worry. Don't worry. Papi! Papi! Papi! He didn't kill anyone! He was with me! Step away from the bars! I can't believe they gave you a life sentence. You need to appeal. Appeal what? Nennete, this is a frame-up. They're all in on it. I just need to concentrate on breaking out. Okay. First thing I'm gonna do when I get back is kill that lying rat witness and anyone who has anything to do with this. - Calm down. - All visitors have to leave! Nennete, you need to forget about me. Don't say that. I love you. - Time's up, lady. - Papi, I love you. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Come on. Come on. Come on! - Get your hands off me! Papillon, right? They fucked you good, huh? Framed you for murder. Say you're one hell of a safecracker. I'm more of a smash-and-grab guy myself. Name's Julot. Got any money? No? Get some. You'll never escape without it. Keep goin', keep goin'. Let's keep goin'. - Next. Move forward. - Next, come on! - Let's go, let's go. - Next. - Line up. - Go to the end. Come on. Move along. - Stay in line. - Hey. - Perhaps I could speak with your supervisor. - Sure. Whatever you say. Louis Dega. Guy's a millionaire. Busted making counterfeit defense bonds. - Won't last long. - Next. Every con in the prison will wanna cut him open to get the money he's carrying. Next. As of this moment, you are the property of the Penal Administration of French Guiana. After serving your full term in prison, you will remain in South America as workers and colonists for a period equal to that of your original sentence. This is for the greater good that is French expansion. As for France... she has disowned you. She has rid herself of you... altogether. Forget France. Now dress yourselves. Are we going to hell? Look up. Just keep walking. Mr. Dega. Your appeal is in a few weeks. Be strong, Louis. I love you. I love you. You'll be home before Christmas. Dega. Mr. Dega, here. Look this way. Mr. Dega. Sixty-nine, 70. - That's right. - Move it! That's enough. Pick your feet up. Hey, Julot! All right, pair up. - Hey. - Take the corner. Looks like Dega's making friends already. Julot, make sure no one takes this hammock. Hey. I saved you a spot next to me. You got a lot of eyes on you. I can keep you safe. All I need's enough money for an escape. Won't be cheap, but you'll be safe. Said the scorpion to the frog. We're all scorpions in here, pal. I think I'd be better off taking my chances setting up in front of the guards. Wouldn't you agree? You seem like the kind of man who can make up his own mind. You're a good judge of character. Have a good night. Yeah, you too. Hey. Me and you, we should team up for an escape. If I get caught in some half-assed escape, I want it to be my mistake. Settle down now! Shh. I know you hide your money in your guts. Upper deck. Move it back. Back, you. Back. Back up. Get him outta here. The animals can clean up their own mess. Come on. Get rid of him. Show's over. How'd you sleep last night? Smells like freedom. What, you've heard of someone escaping the prison? Doesn't mean it can't be done. I have trouble seeing hope in hopelessness. That's why I need a man like you. I've reconsidered your offer. Keep me alive until I'm set up on the island, I'll underwrite any escape you care to arrange. All right. And when the time comes, you're not comin' with me. I have no intention of escaping. Unlike you, I enjoy being alive. My wife's working on my appeal. I'm confident I'll be home by Christmas. A fellow optimist. Four. Two. Look what the fuck you did! Get the knife! Come on! Get the knife! Get the knife! I'll kill you! Steam! Turn on the steam! Fuck you! Come on, come on, come on. Get back! Strip and line up, you fuckin' animals, or it's the steam again. Strip down! Gimme the fuckin' knife. - Move it! - Come on. Line up back there! Let's go! Strip down! - Come on, come on. - On your feet. Line up back there. Strip down. Strip right up. Hands. Hands out. - Everybody, hands out. - Everyone, let's have your hands out. Let's see. What you got? Get him to the infirmary. Let's get this piece of meat outta here. - Show me your hands. Let's see. - Turn 'em over. You. This one's been fighting for sure. Take him to first class. Come on. Come on! Time to go. First class, let's go. Try and behave, ladies. You should have finished him. I don't want to kill anyone. I'm gonna get myself sent to the hospital. Let me know if a guard looks this way. - Do not stop! - Get a move on! Shh. Move it, now! You two! - Move it! Move it! - Crazy, Julot. Go that way! You go this way! You two, come on down. Form a line. Form a line, I said. Form a line. Go ahead. You two, you stay here. Go back in line. Move. Move it! Come on! That way! Come on! Move it! Come on. I said move it, goddamn it. Get up. Get up! - Come on. - Move along! Move along! Eyes straight. Eyes straight. - Come on. Move it. - Move it! - That way. - Down the ladder! - Over there. Come on. - Faster! Move it. Move it! - Come on now. - Come on. Move. Don't be looking at me like that. - Come on. Move. - You too. Move along. Guys, get him up! My fucking leg! My leg. My leg! That's enough. That's enough. Break it up. Break it up. That's enough. - Move it! - Move. Back to the line. Move, move. Raise your hand if I call your name. Augustin. - Barba. - Come on now. Stay in line. Bellaire. Move along! Over there. Lofton. Navarrone. Navarrone. Move out! Move out! All right, come on. Move it. Keep moving! Prisoners, halt! Open the gates. March. I know many of you at this very moment are thinking about escape. Feel free to try whenever you like. We'll be happy to shoot you. If, however, you should avoid that mercy, there are two guardians who are always on duty... The bush, where the best thing that can happen to you is starvation. Or you could choose the sea, where sharks too, I assure you, are always hungry. If you manage to survive your first attempt, you'll get two years in solitary. Second attempt, five years in solitary, followed by a life sentence at Devil's Island. If you commit murder... you'll be executed. That's all. Move. Move. Jesus Christ. Take the corner. Hey, keep your eyes open and don't move. Hey. Who decides what work we get assigned to? - Excuse my ill-mannered... - I thought I told you not to move. He has yet to be tamed. And you're obviously a very important, very, very busy man. I'm just the turnkey. We're looking for someone to ensure we're assigned the right sort of work in the morning. It'll cost you a thousand. I don't think so. No, now that seems entirely too high. Sir, I think we started off on the wrong foot. I think a thousand is actually fair. Now, is there a selection of work you have... Attendants at the hospital. And for a thousand, you can throw in a pouch of tobacco. - And a notebook. - A notebook? - I'm an artist. - You're a forger. And you're a safecracker, a profession of which I thoroughly disapprove. - At least I'm an honest criminal. - Hmm. Hey. I'm gonna need that right now. I mean, right now. Excuse me. I think you need to go to the bathroom. Yes, of course. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen. Where you goin'? I've never been here before. Toilet's there, princess. What animal but a man keeps his only means of survival up his ass? Something bit me. We got a runner! - Lockdown! - Lock it down! - Which barracks? - No, he broke out the hospital. - Just one. - The hospital? Lock down your barrack. - I'll bet that's Julot. - Lock it down! Son of a bitch didn't waste any time. You see? It can be done. Lock it down! Into the jungle. Stand down. Route Zero. Route Zero. Route Zero. My friend and I need to be kept together at all times. Set these two up in the hospital. And it'll be a few days before I'm well enough to do any sort of... Don't push it. Both of them, Route Zero. Mr. Dega, stop. I know you. Do you know me? Yes. Yes, of course, sir. You're the deputy warden, sir. My sister's husband was arrested selling counterfeit defense bonds you furnished him with in Marseilles. Dega is a very common name in Marseilles. - Santini. - Yes, sir. This one goes straight to Route Zero. Take him away. Wait. Take him too. We try not to separate old friends here. Get them to Route Zero. Move. What is Route Zero? Stand clear! Your other round! I don't feel so good. Watch it now! It go... It goes in the cart. Move along. You do a lot of talking. - I do? - Yeah. Stop that. It passes... It passes the time. - Get outta my face. Get outta my face. - You take the bigger rock. You get into a fight with him, I'm not protecting you. If your wife was here... you were in Paris with all that money, how much would you pay to get her back? Everything I have. How much would she pay for you? You're a real optimist. Little man. Little man. You need to put some weight in. You can push harder than that. Come on. Trust me, he can't. Trust me, he has to. Come on! Push it! - Push it! - Pick up the pace. I have... I have diarrhea. What you want me to do about it? No, you don't understand. I lost the money. What's the holdup? What the hell are you doing? - What? - Stop shitting around. - You'll get us all killed. - You mind your own cart. The little guy is making more work for the rest of us. - Mind your own business. - Break it up. Break it up. What are you doing? Get up. Get up! Get up. - On your feet. - I can't. Pick him up. Come on, pick him up. Put him in the cart. Back to work. Move your carts. You had one job to do. You couldn't do it. My body's in revolt. Where is it now? Where do you think? I should have known better than to trust a thief. I can't steal what's already mine. As soon as we get back to the barracks, you're taking it back. And you're gonna hold onto it this time. I don't care if you have to sew your ass up to do it. I'm sorry. I may have prematurely judged you with an unworthy degree of suspicion. Well, don't propose yet. I just don't like carrying things in my ass. Mmm. He's dead. - He's dead! - Shut up, birdie. Are you stupid or what? We share his ration. Here. Here. So you got yourself a boyfriend, huh? You were in the navy? What do you think? I thought maybe it meant ""jailbird."" Swallows. It stands for hope. First thing you see when you reach land. - I know. - Yeah? How come? You were in the navy? Eighteen months. Followed by six in the brig. Didn't suit me. A butterfly. So you're a thief now? Guess that didn't suit you either. We should go sailing sometime. You got a boat? Can you get any of that? Maybe. Well, let me know then. Your boyfriend's got trouble. Give me your money, or you and your friend will die. - Is there trouble? - I was talking to your bitch. Now you're talking to me. Work it out in the barracks! Break is over. Get in line! Break is over. Forward march. Line it up. Line it up! Stop. Stop! Turn around. Eyes up front. Come on. You know better than to truck your ladies through here after a rainstorm. Yeah. Can you help me out? I'll make it good for you. Get the girls up here. Come on. Watch out. Watch out... Hey. Can you hear me? How much to take me up the coast? Don't be stupid. I'll give you 2,000. Guard! Don't turn me in, for Christ's sake. What's the problem? Just wanted to know which girl I should send to repay you. One that hasn't caught anything yet. My boat is on the other side of the river. I'll be there for three more days. It's 5,000. You're a goddamned thief. - The guards are coming. - Don't fucking touch me! I didn't know it would be like this. I'll be dead long before my appeal. I need to go with you. That wasn't part of the deal. Yes, I realize that, but I still have to go with you. You ever sail a boat? Spend any time at sea? Yes, I have spent a number of days at sea. I was locked in a cage for most of them. But I think I understand the concept well enough. You can't come with me, Dega. You should call me Louis. Keep it moving. Get 'em in line. Stand straight! Down on your knees. Take off your hats and cross your arms. At the moment of execution, you're all to bow your heads. A man stabbed two guards... one of whom died this morning, leaving two children without their father. And for what? So he could go on a run through the jungle. Thank you for coming! Watch me go to hell! Prisoner ready. Keeping you is no benefit. Destroying you is no loss. You. Pick another inmate. You carry the body. Go get the boat ready. He's gone. It's just flesh and blood. Why are you stopping? What are you doing? Move. I said, what the hell are you doing? Get up. You get up, you little worm. Get your ass up. You little worm. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Stop! Hey, stop! Hey! We've got a runner! He's heading north. Papi. - Papi? - Heading north now! Papillon! Check the tree line. Hey! Pick him up. Come on. Come on. Oh. You're a good man. Yeah, I'm a good man that wants his money. Look, I don't have it. Not with me. But I'm gonna make it worth your while. I got a lot of money in Paris. I'll give you everything I got. Hmm. Even if you had the money... the warden will pay us double. Son of a bitch. You're lucky that guard didn't die. Otherwise, you would have met the guillotine. Now you'll be transferred to the island of Saint Joseph, where you'll serve a two-year sentence in solitary confinement. There's no rehabilitation. We know that's useless, so we do our best to break you. Strange things happen there. Especially to those who cling to hope, because there is no hope on Saint Joseph. Just silence. You heard the warden. Silence must be observed at all times. Thought you grew wings, didn't you? Grab him. I'll teach you to be quiet. You make another peep... you might not survive your time here. Huh. Come on. He's crazy. Come on. Come on. Enjoy your next two years here. Dega. Hold on. Need to check that. What is that, hmm? Somebody paying you to bring this shit in here? Son of a bitch. Huh? Who's paying you? Who's paying you, you son of a bitch? No! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Jesus! I think you killed him. Get that body out of here and clean up the mess. What the hell were you thinking? No wonder you haven't broken yet. How long has it being going on? You may speak. Who sent you those coconuts? If you don't fess up... I'll put you on half rations. You're choosing another man's life over your own. Put him on half rations. I brought you some soup. It's got meat in it. Just tell me his name. Tell me his name. You think a person knows when he's going mad? Or you think it's blissful ignorance? 'Cause you're about to find out. Put him in darkness for the remainder of his sentence. Or the remainder of his life, whichever comes first. Six. Two. Twenty-four. Twenty-four. This is a good escape. Is he still alive? Two years are up. I know that some of you, at this very moment, are thinking about escape. Feel free to try whenever you like. We'll be happy to shoot you. However, should you avoid that mercy, there are two guardians who are always on duty. The bush, where the best thing that can happen to you is starvation. Or you could choose the sea, where the sharks too, are always hungry. If you manage to survive your first attempt, you'll get two years in solitary. Second attempt is five years in solitary, followed by a life sentence at Devil's Island. If you commit murder... ...you'll be executed. That's all. Papi. I wanted to come sooner, but I was afraid you wouldn't wanna see me. I'm sorry. It's my fault you're here. As you predicted, um, my appeal's run into some problems. But my wife's doing very well. She recently married my lawyer. Well, to hell with her then. You son of a bitch. I thought you'd gone simple on me. That's the idea. You know you'd have had a much easier time if you'd just given them my name. It's not like I didn't think about it. I just know how goddamn delicate you are. Mm. I fear under similar circumstances I would've fared differently. I don't know how you made it. I just got used to the silence. If I ever get out... I'm gonna live a different kind of life. This Sunday, the warden will be showing a film in the courtyard, entertaining some local politicians. It'll be loud. The guards will be doing double-duty, spread very thin. This is your best chance. Can you get a boat? No. What about Celier? Is he still here? Unfortunately, yes. If he can still get a boat... do you have enough money to pay for it? Well, I might, but then he'd wanna come with us. Us? Us. All right. But we still need a boat. You leave now! Leave! Get out! Get out! Leave! Get out! - This man's mad! - Go! - Get out! - He's out of his mind! No! No, no, no, no! No! - No! - He's out of his mind! Help me! Help me! Come, Papi. Here. Come on, come... Calm down, calm down. Let him go. Let him go! It's okay, it's okay. Shh, shh. Bring me some pills. Come on. Take one. Bring me some water. Swallow. It'll be okay. Lights out, ten minutes. Oh! Shh, shh. - Get off of me. - Just relax! - Leave me! - Relax. Get off! I will never let you fuck me. Shh, shh. You will soon, if you know what's good for you. Hey. Hey, I just wanna talk. - I'm not a goddamn whore. - That's not what I want. Yeah, everybody says that until they do. Trust me, I don't. I got a different proposition. If you repeat one word of this, it's not gonna be good for you. - I don't wanna know then. - Maybe you do. Look, I'm puttin' something together. This Sunday. We got room for one more. I have nothing to offer you. I need you to distract that turnkey. Get him to come in here at a certain time, keep him occupied. If I do that, your plan better work. It'll work. It's not gonna be easy. Can you handle yourself? You were framed for murder, right? Well, nobody framed me. That's Celier. He's gotten us a boat. Let's see the arm. Infected. Good job. Papi! You skinny son of a bitch. Good to see you. What'd you do to your arm? I had to cut myself to get in here. - It still work? - Yeah, it's nothing. Don't think about it. - I can still kick your ass. - Can we hurry this up? I have to get back. Birdie, can you shut up for once? This is Maturette. He's our fourth. Oh, yeah? - You know how to handle yourself? - Yeah, with a knife. - All right, take it easy. - Feisty little one, huh? - You all set? - Yeah, I'm set. I got a guy that's hiding a boat on the bank. It's upriver a ways. From there, it's a straight shot to the ocean. But we need half the money now. What about you? When the film starts, we'll go through the warden's building. I'll have a key. We got a plan. We got a plan. You all right? No. I'm not sure we can trust him. Look at him, he's unpredictable. He's like a caged animal. We're all animals in here, pal. He'll be fine. He needs the money now. Here. It's the sedatives they gave me. Get 'em in the guards' coffee. We'll do the rest. I have to get back. Hey. You're doin' good. - Hey. - What do we have here, huh? Go to hell. Give me those back. He's gonna fuck up our plan. It's gonna be fine. What the fuck are you doing, man? All right! That's enough! Break it up! Break it up! He does the warden's books. I had to figure I'd know how to throw a punch considering how often my father used to beat me. Yours too? My parents are school teachers. See ya tonight. Anisette for the warden. The best you have. Just give me the bottle. Here's two or three. Would you gentlemen like your coffees freshened? Bring it on in. Compliments of the warden. Wow. Very nice. Here. If we kill someone and this goes wrong, it's the guillotine. No one dies. Give me another one of them. All right. Dega! Where are you going? Dega! The warden. Now! Stop! Shh, shh! Shh, shh! What was that? I'd better go check. It's working. Oh, man. We're too early. Hey, got a light? Yes, of course, sir. Oh! Oh! Okay, go inside. Everybody, go inside. Come on. - Come on, darling. - Fuck. - That's our way out. - No, no. What's he doin'? - Power's off! - Fuck! Papi, we gotta move. We can't stay here. We wait for Dega. Forget about Dega! He's not reliable. And you know it! Let's just go. Come on. You wanna go? Go. You with me? Uh, yeah. Open the gate. What's wrong with you? Ha! I stole the keys to get us up to the central walkway. We can take that to the guard tower. As long as the lights stay off, they won't see us. And then we jump? You got a better idea? Come on. Come on! Go, go! Guard the wall! You! Take me to the south wall. Yes, sir! Oh, shit. All right. Come on. Let's go. Easy. You all right? Let's go! Come on! Go, go, go. Come on! Jump! Come on! Come on! Come on! They're gonna see you! Come on! Come on! Jump! Come on! Jump! Shit! Hey. It's broken. - Leave him. - He's got the money. Aah. Maturette, help me. Christ! All right, come on. Let's go. Come on. How much further to the boat? You're slowing us down, Dega. Come on. We've got to move faster. Don't take another step. You're not takin' me back. That depends if you have my money. Hey. Papi. It's okay. This is my guy with the boat. Where's our boat? It's a ways up the river. Want me to take you there, pay me. Or fuck you. This is all I have left. Let's keep that between us. Enjoy your freedom! Fuck! What kind of shit boat did you get us? Shut up, Dega! You're lucky to be here. Keep bailing! Get it outta the boat. I'm trying. Don't throw it at me, Dega. Goddamn it. - Throw it in the water! - I'm throwing it at the water. - Maturette! - Yes? Check the tiller. I got it, I got it. Papi. This boat can't hold all of us. You know it. We need to lighten the weight. He's gonna die anyway, Papi. Nobody needs to die. Fuck! It fell off! - Fix the tiller! - It's broken. Fix the tiller! Move! Come on. Here, take this. Take this. Maturette, help me. This storm is gonna sink the boat. We need to act, and we need to act now. Just let me get the boat ready. Did you lose your mind? Huh? You wanna die because of this guy? Nobody needs to die. Well, we can't all live. Dega, he's dead weight. How much money you have? He doesn't have any money. He doesn't have any money? You hear that, Maturette? They've been lying to us. You wanna die for him? That makes it two against one, Papi. Step aside. You don't need to do anything. Step aside, Papi! I'm not gonna die for that guy. Last chance, Papi. Step aside! I don't know about you, I'm going home! Stop! Stop! Enough! That's enough! That's enough. Enough. Welcome. I was traveling with two other men. They are being cared for. Where are we? This is Colombia. We know where you've come from. But you need only repent. Allow God back into your life... and you'll be forgiven. You should go and wash yourself. Then come and pray with us. We need to keep movin'. They know where we came from. Our deal is done. I told you we couldn't trust him. I'm leaving. With or without you. Good luck. Papi! We made it! Papi. It's paradise here. Yeah, but it's not home. Not for me, anyway. Good luck, Maturette. We're leaving. Now. Come on. - Aah! - Papi! Maturette! Repent. If you are truly sorry for what you have done, then you have nothing to fear. God will watch over you. You came back. Come on, Papi. I had to come and see this for myself. Few men survive five years in solitary. What were you living for? 'Cause I don't think you're gonna find it where you're going... Devil's Island. Now, what's the son of two school teachers doing in a place like this? Well? What do you think? I've had five years to work on it. The warden wasn't very happy with my disobedience. So he sent me straight here to Devil's Island. Let's get some food in you. Rise and shine. Come on. There's work to be done. Can we get to the ocean? I know what you're thinking. But even if you survive the fall... you'll never survive the ocean. Hmm? It's all about the waves. What? What are you talking about? What do you think I'm talkin' about? Oh, go back to bed. That's suicide, not escape. No. Listen. All we need to do is build a raft and get it to the ocean. The tide will take us straight to the mainland. Just come and see. Come and see! See? We ride the current to freedom. I'm a little concerned about your ability to protect me right now. Don't worry. The fall will probably kill us. Let's tie these together. I need to stay. What are you talking about? I need to stay. For the same reason you have to go. I belong here. It's okay. It's good. Go on now. You don't wanna waste any more time. Louis! Louis! Louis! I made it, you dirty little forger! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Thank you. Sir? Your water. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm surprised you risked coming back. I'd read the statute of limitations. You're still a wanted man. I won't be here long. My home is Venezuela now. But it's important that my memoir be published here... in France. My wife convinced me to write it all down... while I'm still young enough to remember. So is this really your story? It's the story of a lot of men. Subtitles by explosiveskull, Howdy. - You lost? - No. Don't see folks out this way much. That's a lot of dead prairie dogs. It's just target practice. You know, my grandfather used to say, ""If you kill all the prairie dogs, there'd be no one left to cry for the rain."" Prairie dogs don't make it rain. It's because they burrow, and then that turns the earth. They keep it from getting too hard-packed. And that way, when it rains, the water can get in and make things grow. Did I say something funny? It's always funny to listen to the white man explain how the world works. Still, hard to imagine coming all this way to see prairie dogs. What can I say? I dislike prairie dogs. Can't find something you dislike closer to home? Y'all army or something? Heard they was lettin' was lettin' girls in. Didn't realize they was letting in little, pretty ones. What... I was handling it. Psycho. Target is at seven o'clock. The brunette. I need confirmation. No, no, Sam. You're a fucking idiot. Joe, the fate of humanity rests on the line. Oh, the fate of humanity? The fate of your sperm anyway. Dude, why don't you go and pick her up? Because he knows I'd cut his balls off. She would, she'll cut off my balls, and I need my balls, which is why I have to live vicariously through your balls, Joe, which frankly sucks. Baby, tell Joe to hit on the brunette, please. - First, let's do some shots. - Yes. - How long ago did you break up with whatsherface? - Who's ""whatsherface?"" Can I get three shots of tequila, please? Thank you. - Janice. - Janice, the girl you're still bent out of shape over. That was six years ago. I'm not bent out of shape over Janice. If you don't date for six years after your break-up with someone, you're bent out of shape over her whether you know it or not. Hey, what are you doing with my phone? - I'm on Tinder. - No, no, no, no, no. Finding Joe a girl. Why can't the three of us just hang out, huh? 'Cause you're a third wheel, baby, and we don't enjoy hanging out with you. - What about Melanie? - Give me my phone. I'm not kidding. No, no. No, Mae. Oh, no, never mind. - You know what? - Selfie with a baby tiger. Even the kids are worried about you, Joe. Jude says to me the other night when I put him to bed, he looks up with me through his sad little eyes, and he says, ""Daddy, I'm worried that Uncle Joe is lonely."" You're such a shitter. No, he didn't. - No, he did. - Liar. He said it to me while I was putting him to bed. Yeah, right. You haven't been home to put the kids to bed in two years. Hmm, thanks, Babe. Just personalizing the story for effect. Being in a relationship is like being in a cult. When you're in one, you want every one else to be in one with you. Yeah, because it's beautiful, Joe. Okay, I'm gonna take my sweet wife home. I'm gonna make tender love to her, to my wife, to this woman who I share a rich life with, we share a family. Show her my innermost secrets, my hopes, my dreams. You, on the other hand, you're gonna go home in your shitty little apartment, you're gonna eat cold pizza, and jerk off into a pillow. Dude, I don't have any pizza. Okay, I just found your wife. She's perfect for you. - Let me see. - And you're a match. Let me see. Kathy H.? - She's pretty. - Let me see, let me see. She's pretty. Yeah. Kathy H. is gonna change your life. Do you wanna have a drink tomorrow? No, no, no, no. Don't send anything. Did you send it? Jesus. You sent it? - To Kathy H. - To Kathy H. Geez. To Kathy H. Yeah. Shut up. Hey, Sam. Hey, buddy, pick up your pace. You're not even running an eight-minute mile. Listen, I need you to come over here and look at something for me. No can do. Your wife hacked my dating life, remember? Yeah, well, it's important. I need your advice, Joe. Okay, sure. I can be at your place in an hour. Everything cool? I actually need you at the office. You want me to come to your office? What I want is for you to take those stairs up ahead on the left. Sam, are you tracking my phone? Not a good time to stop, Pal. Pick it up, Joe. Move. Come on, buddy, two at a time. Take a left to the top of the stairs. What's going on, Sam? Get in that van that's right in front of you. What van? Let's go, let's go, let's go. Who are we gonna see? Your Uncle Bob and the Deputy Director. Of the CIA? - Of the CIA. - Yeah? Two years ago, you wrote a program with Harold Floros to help screen employees at likely terrorist targets in the Middle East and Europe to assess the threat potential. - Do you remember that? - Yeah. You know, I didn't think anyone ever looked at that thing. The program is operational? It's operational, Joe, and it works. And you have a chance to save a lot of lives today. We flagged this guy, Ammar Nazari. Nazari is a Saudi national. Thirty-two years old. Before your program found this guy, we'd never heard of him. He's a fresh face in the Sunni terror community. Here we go. Welcome to the big leagues, Joe. Let me show you something. There it is. This is everything we've got on Nazari. Now, we've been watching him for the past six weeks. He's clean, until noon today when he goes to a PO box that no one knew he had, and picks up a package. What's in the package? That's the problem, Joe. We have no fucking idea. Yeah. We didn't have time to do a sweep. Sam, is that ComQuest Field? Mmm-hmm. That's where Nazari's been working as a janitor for the past six weeks until your program flagged him. The program I designed was supposed to screen employees with high profile targets in the Middle East and Europe. Joe. Your uncle has been running with this all by himself. - Bob is running this? - We had no idea. If you have an issue with it, you take it up with him, but you do it on your own time. Nazari, right now, is on his way to a stadium filled with people as we speak. So, you have a state trooper pull him over. You search the car. What if he detonates it? - Detonates what? - Exactly. What is it? Is it nuclear, biological, chemical? We don't know what, Why are we gonna give this guy a chance to pull the trigger? Okay. Wait. You're gonna kill him, aren't you? That's what this is. That's what this room is, right? That's why you're here. Yeah, we wanna hear every perspective... - This is fucking crazy. - ...before we act on it. Subject is just over one mile from the target. Is it a target, Mr. Turner? Joe, this is Mr. Abbott, Deputy Director of the CIA. Well, is it? Uh... The algorithm only looks at employees of high profile targets, Mr. Abbott. So the question isn't so much if ComQuest Field is a target, but more if Ammar Nazari is a threat. Your algorithm gave Mr. Nazari a 12% threat probability. Yes, but the algorithm wasn't designed to be used in this country, so there are variables that will need to be adjusted to make the program actionable. The subject is getting off I-495. A Saudi-born American citizen who is also a Muslim, just visited a secret safety deposit box, and is on his way now to a football stadium. How many variables do we need? But with all due respect, uh, Mr. Abbott, Muslim-Americans are allowed to have PO boxes and also work in football stadiums. - Sir? - Excuse me. What would you do if this was your play? I don't know. How could I... We don't have enough time to not know. Subject is pulling in to the stadium parking lot. Subject is parking. Shadow 1 Bravo engaging. Over. You're talking about killing a man without any evidence against him, except for an algorithm that I wrote years ago and subsequently forgot about. Now forgive me for taking a second to contemplate the 88% likelihood that this man is guilty of nothing more than coming from the wrong country and applying for the wrong fucking job. You wrote the program, Joe. Yeah, I did, so you guys would know who to look at, but not through the scope of a fucking sniper rifle. Enough dithering with your nephew, Bob. Let's get on with this. He's the reason we're here. His program found this man. A man we suspect of being a terrorist is about to walk a package, whose contents are unknown to us, into a football stadium packed with 80,000 American souls. Subject's car door is open. Thank you for your valuable service, Mr. Turner. We should have more young men like you. We'll take it from here. Thank you. - Joe. - Okay. Let's go, Joe. Sir, team leader wants to know if we have a green light. You know, the head coach and his offense coordinator... You've reached Sam Barber. Please leave a message. Sam, it's me. What the fuck was that? I mean, are those people safe or not? I'm just standing here, watching the fucking TV. Can you call me, please? Bye. And that part's been top-down. Which is why we saw a change coming into this season. But you can't change the culture of a football team overnight. These things take time. And right now, you're looking at a group of young men who are physically outmatching... Oh, shit. That takes a toll. Big challenge for the new coaching regime, trying to ride this ship. All right now, first down in mid-field. So, after the diagnosis, my aunt started seeing this energy healer. So, one day, I went with her, and he shook my hand, and said, ""You have the gift. You're a healer. That's what you're meant to do with your life."" He said that he could teach me how to harness the power of my gift, and... You know, use it in a positive way. So, uh, that's what you do? You're a... A healer? I'm a lawyer. Uh-huh. That's usually the part of the story where people laugh. You... Big football fan? - Uh, no. - Degenerate gambler? - No, I have... - 'Cause this is a new one for me. Losing a guy's interest to football in the first date. I hate football. I couldn't even tell you who's winning. - Is that supposed to make me feel better? - Yeah. No, uh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Uh... What kind of law do you practice? - Intellectual property. - Okay. I have some semi-conductor clients here in the US whose US patents are being knocked off in, uh, China and Korea and... I'd rather not drink alone. God. Wait. Wait, wait. Look, I'm sorry. I'm just glad something you're interested in wasn't on. I really am sorry. Today... Today was a bad... It was a weird fucking day. And the truth is, I meant to cancel our date, but I forgot. Well, why didn't you just start with that? Yeah. Yeah, in hindsight, that was the obvious move. Look, it's already late, but I just live a few blocks from here. I mean if you wanna walk me home. Yeah. All right. Why was today a bad day? Something happened. Work. What? I, uh... I can't really... I can't really talk about it. Yeah. Everyone I know has to sign NDAs now. Yeah. Wait, so what do you do? You know what? It doesn't matter. 'Cause I'm gonna quit tomorrow. Do you go on a lot of these? Dates? Uh, I text people. And I fantasize they'd be amazing. Basically have an entire imaginary relationship that ends in a breakup before they can even text you back. You got it. - I guess I'm not... - As unique as you thought you were. Me, neither. How are you single? That was a line. Takes too long really get to know someone. - Mmm-hmm. - That person is never as good as the one you imagined. Sometimes you get hurt. You know... If we were a rational culture, we would begin every first date by saying, ""Here's what's wrong with me."" - Let's just get it out of the way, huh? - Yup. This is me. Okay. So fine... - Tell me. - What? What's wrong with you? Come on. What? I'm a stranger. You're never gonna see me again. You're not gonna see me again? You think I'd go on a second date with you? Come on. I know this cozy little sports bar. It's a few blocks from here. You'd love it. Okay. Okay? Okay. All right. Hello. I imagine you must be pissed at me. You don't have to imagine too hard. I can't be part of a program whose mission I... No longer believe in. You're not the only one who believes that spying on American citizens is wrong, Joe. Yeah, but I am the only one whose belief that it's wrong stops him from doing it. Sometimes, you have to do the wrong thing. Why is that? So you don't have to do the worse thing later. See, you keep moving the line, Bob. That's your problem. Or maybe it's your talent. I don't know. But I... I can't do this anymore. I out. Sometimes a man's conflicted only because it's in his nature to be conflicted, which is what makes him so damn good at what he does. It's the people who don't have that dissenting a voice inside them that are truly dangerous. That dissenting voice doesn't mean much if the dangerous people you work for aren't willing to hear it. We're in a crowded theater. It's on fire. All we can do is yell as loud as we can. I'm sorry, Bob. You did a good thing, Joe. Yeah, I don't know what that means, and I don't wanna know. Turn on the TV. We'll talk about it tomorrow. I'm out, I mean it. Any channel. Did I wake you, sweetheart? The airborne or pneumonic type of the plague virus that was found on Nazari, is the rarest and deadliest form of the disease. With a mortality rate of close to 100% if left untreated. Had Nazari been allowed to release this bio-weapon undetected, those 80,000 people might now be back in their homes or offices unwittingly infecting thousands. The FBI is calling this an act of terrorism. I mean the guy IPO'd at 24 and retired at 28. Now he just sails around on his boat, you know, following the warm weather like some kind of bird. - Turner, Joseph. 8:22 - Oh, God. Ellie, leave Harold alone. He has work to do. It's still early right now. The resolve is melting, Joe. Faster or slower the polar ice caps? Good morning, Colonel. See, I'm playing a long game here, Joe. I'm gonna win to the Christmas party, and then I make my big move. What happens at the Christmas party? I break out my secret weapon. Colonel, do you see a, uh, secret weapon anywhere on Harold? No? You need a calling card, something to distinguish you. I don't need a calling card. What I'm saying is this is my home. Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, listen. I'm a fantastic dancer, okay? Women respond to this on a primal level. Do you get that? I mean, they can't help themselves. I lived with the Makalanga for a year, all right? They taught me how to dance. Surely you want Ellie to like you for your mind. - Listen, attraction is instinctual. - There you are. In our base programming, we're still primates. And the big monkey gets all the hugs. Great. Only 'cause his algorithms saved a few hundred thousand lives last night. What's that now? Comquest Field... That was... Thanks for telling me. That's... Our algorithm was used last night to stop a terrorist attack. Mmm-hmm. Nice to know. Probably saved all of DC last night. No big deal. Right back to work. Yup. Not even so much as a celebratory cigarette? You're right. I can't believe I have to go to dinner with my folks tonight and listen to my father bitch about how he should have become a doctor. Clark Kent will always be a coward to his friends and family. Not true. Ma and Pa Kent know he's Superman. Ah, yeah. Look, I know you won't get any credit, and you won't give yourself any, but you did some good, Joe. I mean, that's what this is all about, right? You know, honestly, until I saw the news last night, I was gonna quit. - Shut up. - No, I even told Bob. You honestly wanna quit because a terrorist's civil liberties are violated? Not to mention the civil liberties of a whole lot of other people who it turned out weren't terrorists. Yeah, we collected data on a bunch of innocent people who are now safer for it. - How's that bad? - Okay, but what about the ones we watched? Interviewed? Held for a few hours? Where's the line? Eighty thousand people get infected with the plague at a football game. They don't show any signs of being sick for days. They go home. They go to work. And some get on airplanes, and they go to other countries. A couple of minutes ago, it was just DC. Now we save the world? Come on. What's he doing here? What? I can't hear you. It's thick glass. Probably came to accept your resignation in person. Yesterday, countless American lives were saved because of this group. And you deserve congratulations. But... That's not what I'm here for. Ammar Nazari got a job at ComQuest Field with a plan to infect Americans with the plague during a football game. We know very little else about him. Until six weeks ago, he'd never been on our radar. We don't know... Who trained him, who he's working for. The device that was on him, would have required a great deal of engineering skill and manufacturing. Which means Nazari was most likely not working alone. Someone out there could still have weaponized plague, and we have to assume they're going to use it. JTTF is working on the encryptions on Nazari's laptop, combing through his house, interviewing his neighbors, trying to trace the materials on the device back to a manufacturer. But it wasn't the JTTF who found this guy. And I'm sure as hell not gonna entrust this hunt to conventional methods alone. Now, I've rarely ever given you anything other an open-ended mandate to innovate. But today, I'm asking you... To put whatever you're doing on hold, and make this your only priority. If the people Nazari was working with are gearing for another attack, we may only have a small window to find and stop them. You sure this is safe, Nathan? A hundred percent. I got kids. As one father to another I guarantee you, you have nothing to worry about. Our man will pick it up at the embassy tomorrow. - Okay. - Safe flight, Ambassador. So that's it. Let's do it. Bob, about last night... Let's talk about it later. Walk us through a scenario where a weaponized pneumonic plague gets that kind of traction in a major American city. What kind of plans does the CDC have in place? Well, the plan is mass prophylaxis. So, the US has been stock piling ciprofloxacin for decades. So, in the event of a health emergency, PODs or Points of Dispensing Sites would be set up in every major US city. Stock transactions? Every stock transaction in the pharmaceutical sector going back three years. Uh-huh. Why? Uh, well, I was thinking about the country's vaccine stockpiles. - Oh. - Ciprofloxacin. Bingo. Girl I used to date called this morning to ask if my father could write her a prescription. You're wondering if someone made a move into Big Pharma knowing vaccine stockpiles would be depleted? Like the terrorists shorting airline stocks before 9/11. You see, that's a fiction. Yeah, well, Dick Tracy wore a two-way wrist radio in the 40s, and now people wear Apple watches. Not cool people. The point is, fiction can become real. - Dick Tracy? - He was an underrated detective. So which transactions stand out? Uh, well... I found these 12 companies, and collectively, they bought over a billion worth of Big Pharma. What connects them? See, that's just it. They're all different sizes, they're headquartered in different countries. It all looks completely random, but that is exactly how you want it to look if you're the one doing it. Okay, so what you're saying is what you found is that you found nothing. Uh, no. Humans don't do random well. The minute we try to avoid creating a pattern, we just create a different kind of pattern. So your big idea is to follow the money back to the dick turds who planned this thing. Dick turds? Yeah. It's pretty flimsy there, bud. Yeah, you're reaching. I know, I know. Now, the FBI is calling this an act of terrorism, but there's been no claim of responsibility from any known terror organization. Is there any indication that a... Coming through. Hello. I have a new assignment for you. I need it expedited. The target package has been sent. I'm looking at it now. I'm gonna drop you on your head. Come here. So how'd it go with Kathy H? Yeah, it was good. Maybe. I don't know. Thank you. You're so good with him. You'd be such a great dad if you could ever get over your bullshit. My bullshit? They've heard worse. Yeah. You meet someone, have an actual relationship. Hard to do if you can't even tell someone what you do for a living. Yeah, that's the bullshit I'm talking about. Sammy, guys, bedtime. Uh-uh. Let me just finish this level. What did I say? She is a tyrant. Yeah. No kidding. Come on, Jude. You've been working for the CIA for a long time now, Joe. How is this still an issue for you? I guess it's in my nature to wanna... Trust a few people. You think Sam gets to tell me what he does every day? No. But, at least you know why he can't. You know what your problem is? What, I only have one? Well, that's up for debate. Unlike every other guy in the universe, you think with your heart, instead of your dick. Oh. You can't start every first date contemplating marriage. Get laid. See where it goes. Hey, babe, sorry I'm late. Whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Do I know you? Look, this creep's been following me for six blocks. Pretend you're my boyfriend, okay? Okay. Is he there? No. No, I think you're good. Thank you. Anytime. Thanks for meeting me, Sam. What the fuck's going on, Nathan? I don't like being exposed like this. Gareth has been doing some trades. What kind of trades? He bought stock in pharmaceutical companies that manufacture ciprofloxacin. That greedy motherfucker. It gets worse. What? Your friend, Joe Turner. He found out about them. And... You don't like being exposed? We're exposed. - So this guy... - You know, I thought you were gonna take advantage of the situation and kiss me. But you handled yourself like a perfect gentleman. Club soda and lime, please. Can I... Can I buy you a real drink? I can't. Big day at work tomorrow. I need to keep a clear head. What are you saying? I already sent the assignment to the assets. You what? You're mad because you have a personal connection, but once you get past that, you'll see that this is really the only way forward. Water. What's that? Sorry, I have a nasty habit of taking my work home with me. Isn't that usually a sign of a fulfilling job? What can I say? I love what I do. How about you? Are you fulfilled? I don't know. Your accent, where's it from? Cleveland. Oh. If you're not gonna talk about yourself, why should I talk about me? Come on. We don't know each other. You don't even know my name. How often do you get the chance to be totally honest with someone? All right. I have to lie to people about what I do for a living, and it makes it hard for me to get close to anyone. You carry a lot of guilt. That's good. I don't feel guilty about anything. It's okay to be happy. You're young, strong. You got a long life ahead of you. I really like that. You coming to bed anytime soon? Ah. I can't sleep. You okay? Sam, hey. Sam, what's going on? Nothing, nothing. I think I'm coming down with something. Well, you should definitely come to bed. Okay, doc. We have parent-teacher night next Thursday for Jude. I think we should both go 'cause his teacher's a bitch, and I think I'm gonna lose my shit if I'm in there by myself. Hey. Are you even listening to me? Huh? Did you hear anything I just said? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just... Got a lot of stuff on my mind, okay? Whatever it is, just let it go. For once. Come to bed with me. I'll be there in a minute, okay? Sam? Hi, Bob. Are you at home? There's too much going on to be at home. I'm at Nazari's. I'm gonna head over. I wanna run something by you. Hi, Bob. You seen Nazari's bed? Yeah. - Hospital corners. - Yeah. What compels a man about to walk a plague into a football stadium to make his bed? Well, I guess... When you're in a combat zone, those little routines are a big comfort. Yeah. I remember combat zones being less comfortable. Not much. Did I ever tell you I met your father once? In Nha Trang. I guess you saw a lot of shit. I mean it's a hell of a sacrifice to make for nothing. We were born after all the good wars were already over. The world has changed. These people used to want a seat at the table. Now they wanna blow the table up. How do you... How do you fight an enemy like that? So what did you wanna talk about? You're right. You can't fight an enemy like that, not like that. Hello? Hey. Power's out on the whole block. Back-up generator's dead. Huh. Dr. Lappe... Did you read my report about the pharma stock trades? Yes, I'm sending it up to Langley as soon as the power comes on. Morning, Colonel. Arms up. I'm gonna miss my flight. Turner, I may not have the most glamorous job in the world, but believe it or not, I derive some satisfaction in doing it well. What time are you gonna pick me up for dinner? My job is to protect everyone that works in this building. You going on the fire escape for your cigarette breaks is a breach of security that puts you and everyone who works here in danger. I'm giving you one last warning. If I catch you again, I'm writing you up. There's one T in Turner. You're an asshole. Morning. Morning. What's wrong? - Hey. - Hi. Soy vanilla latte, right? Harold, you didn't have to do that. I know, but I wanted to, so... Also, hey, um, so I was thinking maybe, maybe... Um, you and I could do something some night. Or something. Harold, you seem like a nice guy. Well. But you've been chatting me up every day since you started working here, and I've been very careful to give you no indication whatsoever that I might be at all interested in seeing you outside the office, precisely to avoid you asking me out and having to hurt your feelings. I know. I just thought, you know, maybe the drugs that I put in your coffee might change your mind. What? Bitch. Sharla called me a hypocrite. Gave me a guilt trip about how she'd work too hard in recovery getting to know herself to waste time with someone who couldn't even admit who they were to their own parents. Get right in there. You spent half a decade behind that desk, believing that you're protecting all of us just in case something terrible happened. Your life's purpose was a pitiful delusion. That flew right by my ear. What the hell? Look out! Go! Get out! Go! Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. No, no, no. Oh, Jesus. He's in the basement. Hey, it's me. I'm in Saudi. Package has landed. I'll await the courier. Pentagon. Subtitles by explosiveskull, This way, please. Ladies and gentlemen, this way, please. Follow me. Round there, please. Thank you. From the dynasty of Akbar the Magnificent, and for over a thousand years, our nation's religious symbol, the Pink Panther. Largest and most famous diamond in the world. Irreplaceable, its value cannot be estimated in terms of money. Isn't the museum worried that someone might steal it? The Pink Panther is protected, and by forces more impenetrable than any army. Observe. Deactivate. Failing the radar shield, the slightest release of pressure in the weight of the diamond, and the would-be thief is a prisoner. A prisoner of the Pink Panther. Why is it called the Pink Panther? The stone is flawed. If it is held up to the light in a certain way, the figure of a springing panther can be seen clearly. - Good morning, sir. - Sit. My department has already begun rounding up suspects. His Majesty has been informed of the theft. He is flying home from Washington. - I expect an arrest any moment now. - I do not share your optimism. We know the culprit is within our borders. All airports and railway stations are being watched. While your men search for this man with the Dutch passport who rented the hotel room, he has thrown away his passport and is making ready to leave the country under a new identity. - When we find the fingerprints... - If you find them... You are both in trouble. But if we do what is necessary and conventional. I am calling in outside help. The famous French detective who recovered the Pink Panther the last time it was stolen. - What was his name? - Clouseau. Inspector Clouseau. - Do you have a licence? - Monsieur? City ordinance 47-B prohibits the playing of any musical instrument in a public place for the purpose of commercial enterprise without a licence. I don't understand. It is against the law for you to play your musical instrument. - The leur? - What? You say it's against the law? Yes, unless you have a proper licence. What kind of licence? A licence that permits the playing of any musical instrument in a public place for the purpose of commercial enterprise. - Commercial enterprise? - Yes. You play that thing and people give you the money. People give the monkey the money. - It is the same. - Not at all, monsieur. I am a musician and the monkey is a businessman. He doesn't tell me what to play, and I don't tell him what to do with his money. Monsieur, don't try to be funny with me. He is your monkey, therefore it is your money! He lives with me, but he is not my monkey. One day I came home and found him in the living room! I let him stay, but he pays for his own room and board. Then the monkey's breaking the law. But he doesn't play any musical instrument. City ordinance 132-R prohibits the begging. How do you know so much about city ordinances? What sort of stupid question is that, - are you blind? - Yes. Oh, I see, yes. Yes, of course. You happen to be talking to a police officer, and because I expect to be transferred back to the Detective Division at any moment, I will let you off this time with just a warning. Thank you, Monsieur Agent. But you must get yourself a proper licence. First thing tomorrow. Try to do something about your filthy monkey. Halt! Just a moment! Move, move! Over there! Arretez! Idiot! How was I to know he was the bank manager? How were you to know the bank was being robbed? - That is correct. - What is correct? I did not know the bank was being robbed because I was engaged in my sworn duty as a police officer. You didn't even arrest the old beggar. There was some question as to whether the beggar or his minkey was breaking the law. - ""Minkey""? - What? You said ""minkey""! That is correct, yes, chimpanzee monkey. So I let them both off with a warning. The beggar was the lookout man for the gang. - That is impossible. - Why? He was blind. How can a blind man be a lookout? How can an idiot be a policeman? Answer! It's simple, all he has to do is enlist. Shut up! - How do you know he was blind? - Because he told me so. Oh, he told you so. And you believed him? I had no reason to doubt him. Do you believe me if I tell you that I'm not going to get you suspended for six months? - Do you believe me? - If you say so, sir. Yes. Because I'm a bigger liar than the beggar. You are suspended for six months without pay. - Six months? - Effective immediately. Have you anything to say? Could you lend me 50 francs? Will you get out of my sight! - Yes. - Idiot. My blood pressure. Idiot. One day, Franois. One day I'll be rid of him forever. That'll be the day. - Something on your mind? - An order from the commissioner. - Oh, yes? - It concerns Clouseau. Yes? Go on. He is to be reinstated as an inspector. What? You can't be serious. And he is to report immediately to a Colonel Sharki in Lugash. I see. - Sir! - What? It's a birthday gift from my wife. Most realistic. Get me the commissioner. Chief Inspector Dreyfus calling. The commissioner. Commissioner, I have just received your instructions to send Clouseau to Lugash, but you see, he's no longer with the Sret, I've just given him... Yes, but... Yes, but since France and Lugash have been allies for nearly 200 years, it might be a serious mistake to send someone who is... I see. Yes, of course. Very good, commissioner. It seems the Shah of Lugash telephoned the president personally and asked for Clouseau to be assigned to the case. - The Shah of Lugash. - Incredible. All right, Franois. The Shah of Lugash. ...the capital earlier this morning. It seems that the army... by sealing the area around the president's palace. Highs for the coast... Oh, good evening, Madame Landlord. ...against the price increases... Good evening. I was just reading the headlines in your newspaper. ...opposition is... Good evening. Cato? Cato! Monsieur Clouseau's residence. One moment, please. For you. Chief Inspector Dreyfus. - Yes, sir. - You're back on the force. Come to my office... immediately! Immediately, sir. Well, Cato, I am back on the force. You know, Cato, your freezer ambush ploy... I really congratulate you. It was very, very good. But Cato, your fly is undone. And so, my friend, are you! Yes, my little yellow friend. I knew the chief would have to reconsider. He did not get where he is by ignoring a man's qualifications. He knows that I am unique and therefore indispensable. We are much the same, the chief and I. But of course, Cato, all great detectives have one thing in common. You know what that is? Instinct. That rare ability to know immediately without having to stop and reason. And in my business it can easily mean the difference between life and death. All right, I'll get it. Thank you. Yes, that split-second timing when instinct tells you... that... Ah... Aghh! ...new wave of assassinations. ...the opposition spokesman has categorically denied... Infamous powers are at work. The instant you assign me to a case, the underworld hears about it and I am set upon. Cato is in hospital. They nearly blew his yellow skin off. It's amazing that I am still alive. Amazing is not the word. Do I detect something in your voice that says I am in disfavour with you? Yes. I wish you were dead. You are entitled to your opinion. And you are not! Out! Out of my sight! You want me to leave? If you are not out of this room in five seconds, I shall not be responsible for my actions! Five seconds is nothing, I can easily be out in three. - But if you really want me to leave... - I've had enough! Oh, thank you very much. A very amusing clever little gadget. Very realistic, but, of course, my instinct told me that... Something the matter? You're not feeling well? My blood pressure. Must take my pill. You're killing me. Yes. Perhaps some water. You have a defective carafe. Allow me to blot you. - Idiot! - I will blot you. I had an aunt who suffered from high blood pressure. She was attended successfully by Dr August Balls of Nice. And after he had attended her for several weeks, she... Oh. Obviously, out of fluid. Perhaps you would like me to fill it for you? Now just... just... Please just go away. Yes. Well, all right, inspector. I will leave, but remember, I will be at your service night or day. Of course, I will be on assignment in Lugash. Fortunately there is, I believe, some difference in time. My watch seems to have stopped, probably due to the explosion. You need a new flint. Well, chief inspector, until we meet again and the case is solv-ed. ""The case is solv-ed!"" Idiot! Dont just stand there, idiot. Call a doctor, and then help me find my nose! Inspector! A very interesting museum you have here. - Inspector... - Please tell me nothing. I prefer to investigate the scene of the crime spontaneously. That way it gives my trained instincts full rein. But our security measures... I'm sure your security measures are very good. But, obviously not good enough. Let me see... Yes, very effective. Very effective, indeed. The element of surprise. Of course, I knew it would happen. Nevertheless, the element of surprise. How very kind of you to welcome me. Is there any way of getting in and out of this place - without this happening all the time? - Deactivate it. Deactivate the door. Hmm. Yes... Oh. Ugh. So we meet again. - Very ingenious. - He pulled himself across the floor. He did? How else could he avoid the radar field? Yes, how else? Hmm. Of course, he would need a very slippery floor to do that. - Therefore, the wax. - The wax? Aah! Are you all right? 'Course I am all right. I am examining the wax. Have you taken a sample of this wax? - Wax is wax. - Well, this is where you are wrong. Wax is not just wax. In this case it is a clue. English wax, French wax, domestic wax... The inspector is right. Have the wax tested immediately. It is my guess that you will find it is English wax. - Why? - Because your thief is an Englishman. How do you know that? It is my business to know that. He is Sir Charles Phantom, the notorious Litton. - The Phantom? - Yes, one and the same. His calling card. Four years ago, Sir Charles suddenly vanished. It was rumoured in the underworld... given up his life of crime, but my instinct told me he would not remain in hiding for long. Four years is not long? Time is not the issue here, this glove is the issue here. It signifies the Phantom is up to his old tricks. But I will catch him and root him out. It won't be easy, he's a master of disguise. And, undoubtedly, he has gone back into hiding until the heat is off. How is he? Unlovable. Has he seen it? No, I thought you'd like to show it to him. - How was Paris? - Expensive. - Good. Buy anything foolish? - Lots. - How have you been? - Splendid. Fantastic. I have created something... absolutely extraordinary since breakfast. - Oh, can I see? - No, no, no. Not yet. Come on. Please don't be so... - The impact might be too strong. - Let me see. There you go. - How about that? - Hmm. - You know what? - What? I think I came back just in time. Damn! - What, darling? - Listen to this: ""Police today were conducting a house-to-house search of Lugash for the thief, who Monday night stole the fabled Pink Panther Diamond from the Royal Museum here. According to authorities, the only clue was a white monogrammed man's glove with the initial ""P"". Well, what do you think? That you didnt just spend your time just painting during my absence. Oh. You think I had something to do with the robbery. Didn't you? You little beast. Three, no four years ago I swore to you that I was retiring. I've been faithful to you ever since. - In your fashion. - Now, what the hell does that mean? That you're being teased. I believe you, darling. But you must admit it does sound like the kind of job only the Phantom could have done. I mean, the Pink Panther. No clues except your well-known calling card. Yes. I must admit, the impostor, very clever. Very clever, indeed. I'm surprised half the police force of France hasn't descended on us by now. But, of course, they will! - Without a doubt. - But if you're innocent... I'm not only innocent, I'm smart enough that if I decided to get back in business, I wouldn't leave my calling card. Will the police think that? No. But you can convince them. Not unless the real thief was caught. But then you are lost. If the police think that you are the real thief, - then who will catch the impostor? - Hm? Well, I can only think of one person really, can't you? Charles. Since the alternative is prison, I don't have very much choice, do I? I'm frightened. This impostor is obviously very clever. He could be dangerous. Oh, darling. Not to worry! Trust me. I may be a bit rusty, but I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I congratulate you, chief, on your excellent facilities. Of course, you understand that my visit here must be of the utmost secrecy. Of course. My department will do everything possible to assist you. However, there is one question that only you can answer. Oui? Does Sir Charles Litton have a swimming pool? A swimming pool? - Back before you know it. - Take care. Now, what identity will you travel under? Well, I shall be... dreary old Sir Charles Litton leaving the country. And... fearless... dashing young doctor Marvin Tanny arriving in Lugash. Watch it! I have the report here. Someone has trifled with your brakes. The underworld will stop at nothing. It's the second attempt on my life. I may have caught my death of pneumon... Gesundheit. I have fixed your doorbell from the ringing. There is no charge. Thank you. What do you want? I am from the telephone company, there is something the matter with your pheun. - My ""pheun""? - What? You said there's something the matter with my ""pheun"". - Yes. - My phone? That is correct, yes, that is what I been saying. No trouble with the telephones here. I know when there is a trouble, and when there is not a trouble. And I can definitely tell you that there is a trouble, - you may rest assured of that. - Since when? Since it was reported. I see. What is the trouble with the telephones? If I knew that, I could simply call you up and tell you what the trouble is. What's the trouble? This man says we have trouble with our telephones. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Emile Flournoy, communications expert and chief trouble-shooter - for the Nice Telephone Company. - Please come in, monsieur. Now what can we do to help you? Which is your nearest phone? - There. - What? Ah, yes... Hmm. Yes, this phone will not do at all. Show me another phone. It won't do at all, I'm afraid. - Show Monsieur Flour... - Flournoy! Flournoy... the telephone in Sir Charles's study. I hope you locate the trouble, monsieur. Madame, it is my business to locate trouble. - No trouble back there. - If you require anything... Monsieur, all I require... is a phone, my little bag of tools and some privacy in which to work. That is all I require. Take that phone, but don't pick it up until I tell you. - Raymond? - Si. I'm taking the 5.00 plane to Switzerland, have you got that? Si, Switzerland. Have you got the merchandise? - Si. - Good. I'll see you tomorrow at the Palace Hotel in Gstaad. Si. - Goodbye. - Si. Goodbye. Inspector? Do not come in! Do not come in, I am making further delicate adjustments to the phone. I will tell you when it is safe to enter. These adjustments must not be interfered with, you know. Do not come in, I am just putting my tools away. As I surmised, a slight malfunction with your phone which I repaired. Well, I must now return to my office and report my adjustments. According to the authorities in Nice, he has so far demolished one swimming pool and two trucks. And he's on his way to Gstaad. - Gstaad? - Yes. Today, a paradise in the Swiss Alps, tomorrow, a wasteland. Compared to Clouseau, Attila the Hun was a Red Cross volunteer. - Careful! - Huh? I put the real one in the bottom drawer. See? Oh! Ooh! Follow that car! Good day. - So nice to have you back again. - Thank you. Excuse me, do you know the way to the Palace Hotel? Yes. - Bags, sir? - No, thank you. This bag never leaves my arm. Your bag, sir. Thank you. Scusi, signor. May I take your coat? Thank you very much. - Your gloves? - Of course. Your hat? - Grazie, signor. - Prego. Oui, Monsieur? - Do you have a reum? - A ""reum""? - What? - You said, do I have a ""reum""? I know perfectly well what I said. I said, ""Do you have a reum?"" You mean, ""Do I have a room?"" That is what I have been saying, you fool. Do you have a reservation? I am Inspector Clouseau of the Sret... and I am here on official police business. Whether you're here on official police business or not, this is the height of the season and the hotel is full! Listen, my friend. This is a matter of national importance, and if you continue to be difficult with me I shall have no alternative but to have speaks with my superiors. Well... In that case, monsieur... we do have a room. I thought as much. Lugash Airways announce the arrival of flight 12 from Paris and Nice. Passengers wishing to travel to the city terminal by bus should proceed to the Lugash transport counter. The nature of your visit to Lugash, Dr Tanny? - Is it business or pleasure? - Purely pleasure. Next. Incoming passengers are reminded they should retain the white card. This must be surrendered to Lugash authorities before departure. The loss of this card may cause considerable delays. Have my bags sent up to my room. How are you, Pepi? What a surprise! It's Sir Charles Litton, isn't it? Not necessarily. Un Cognac, s'il vous plat. Well... Where do I find the Fat Man? I've... I have not... I've not seen the Fat Man in years. Really? You're not working for the Fat Man, then who are you working for? You are breaking my finger. Why don't you call a policeman? All right, all right. You can find the Fat Man at the Salamander. Thank you, Pepi. Why don't you order yourself some liniment... on the rocks? Well, Charles! Well, my old friend. It's good to see you. Come, sit down. I really miss seeing you. You look wonderful. What can I do for you? Well... I need a favour from you, old man. Of course. But first, I need your help. And my two associates, they're here to guard the Pink Panther. When you've finished your drink, - you'll hand it over. - I haven't got it. But you took it. I wish I had, truly. But I didn't, I swear it. Normally, Charles, I'm a man who detests violence, but in your case I'm forced to make a most regrettable exception. Would it upset you too much to explain why? Under the pretence of trying to catch the thief, the general is hurting many innocent people... and a group of my very good friends. If I give him the thief, he'll have to stop hurting them. Of course, if you didn't steal the Panther, one might almost conclude the general, in order to get rid of his political enemies, engineered the robbery himself. I bet he even offered a reward. - A very considerable reward, dead... - Or alive? And if you are dead... I can't prove I didn't steal the Pink Panther. I knew you would figure it out. Deliver the body to the general with my compliments. I'm awfully sorry... old boy. Well, you know the old saying, ""With friends like you, - who needs enemies?"" - Enemies. Good evening, Dr Tanny. Good evening. I am Colonel Sharki. Yes! I thought we might be running into one another... sooner or later. I... I need your help. Now, Colonel Sharki... What could a simple doctor do to help the head of the Lugash secret police? A simple doctor? Nothing. But the notorious Phantom? Oh, he could do quite a bit. For instance? I want your cooperation in recovering the Pink Panther. The Fat Man seems to think that you cooked up this robbery as an excuse to do a little political housecleaning. The Fat Man is not the only one with that opinion. And if you can prove that you are not guilty... - You have a bad leg? - Oh, it's nothing. If you can prove you're not guilty, I'm in serious trouble. Because of the religious significance of the Pink Panther, it's imperative to the government that sooner or later the thief be apprehended, - and the jewel returned. - You would prefer it later than sooner? I can't tell you how reassuring it is to know that we understand each other so well. And if... I do... catch the thief? I have every confidence that you will. How does the saying go? ""Set a thief to catch a thief."" Goodnight, Dr Tanny. - You hate him. - Yes, I hate him all right. - How much do you hate him? - How much? How high is up? I hate every little molecule in his body. You'd like to kill him? To kill him. Oh, God, yes. To kill him. Why don't you? Oh, to kill him. What? Why don't I? - It's not so easy, you try. - I mean kill him psychically. - Ridiculous. - Why? Nothing I can do psychically would have - the slightest effect on him. - Why not? Because he's got the brain of a minkey. - Minkey? - What? - You said minkey. - I did? You see, I'm beginning to talk like him. Now doctor, you'd better come up with a better suggestion or I'll get myself another analyst. Now, just relax. Relax. I haven't slept for a week. I just lie there thinking the same thoughts over and over and over again. Describe your thoughts. Get them out in the open and you'll feel much better. All right. See, it's always the same. Clouseau is sitting there, in a chair just like you, with his back to me. And then suddenly, my hands go round his throat and I begin to squeeze. It's wonderful, it's marvellous. I'm squeezing. And the more I squeeze, the freer I feel. I'm in ecstasy. And then suddenly... Suddenly, my problem is solved. Doctor? Doctor! Sir Charles arrived at my office this morning at ten, and we reviewed all the evidence to date. He was interested, asked all the right questions. Then we went to the viewing room and watched the film from the hidden monitoring cameras. This was the last group to go through the museum before it was robbed. - Do you recognise any of these people? - No. No. He appeared to study the film very carefully, and he claimed not to recognise any one of them. No. We questioned him three times about each. No. - You sure? - Absolutely. - This one? - No. - How about that one? - No! Each time the results were identical. Little or no stress until questioned about number three. Then, hard stress. Number three. A young man, the museum guide remembers him. Good morning. It could be better. - How? - You could go away. All right, but first I'll need your truck. I haven't got a truck anymore. I sold it. What do you want it for? You're gonna help me get across the border. It's impossible, the border is closed. You have to have a special pass. - Then get one. - It's out of the question. If I go to the Fat Man to buy a special pass, he wants to know the reason. Then tell him that I've threatened your life unless you help me to get across the border. Tell him that for half the sum of the reward plus a forged pass to get you out of the country, you will deliver me into an ambush at some pre-named place of the Fat Man's choosing, this side of the border. What if he doesn't believe me? I'm sure you'll be able to convince him. And if, my dear Pepi, you double-cross me, it'll be a very long while before you give your next piano recital. Yes? You asked to be kept informed of Lady Litton's activities. - Yes. - She's going skiing at two. - Skiing in this weather? - On the glacier. On the glacier? - How long have you been a bellboy? - Oh! Too long, monsieur. Keep up this good work and very soon I will see to it that you become a bell man. - Bonjour, milady. - Hello, good afternoon. I changed my mind about skiing. I'm going to the tennis matches instead. If my husband calls tell him I'll be back around four. - Oui, madame. - Thank you. Hello? Guten Tag? - Hello? Wie geht's? - Wie geht's? Swine bird, that is my private moustache. You naughty bird. Swine! No, no, no, wait! It's me, Inspector Clouseau of the Sret. - She's coming. - What? In the elevator. Hello. What are we going to do? What are we going to do? What we are doing... She's coming! I'm sorry. Oh, come in, please. - Some towels you have, bitte? - Oh, yes. I'll go get them. - What are you doing? - Nichts. Staubsucker. Out! Schnell! Schnell! Get up, you fool! Guten Tag! Wie geht's? What took you so long? The Fat Man is not convinced so easily. - But you managed. - Here is the pass. And you gave him... As you suggested. For the pass and half of the reward, I will hand you over. - Quickly, we must hurry. - Where? - What? - Where did you agree to hand me over? The Fat Man will be waiting at the point one mile south of the roadway, seven miles from the border. I know the place precisely. I will avoid it absolutely. Quick, we must hurry! No, after you. - What? - Try ""why."" - Why? - Shh! Because I know you precisely, and doubt you absolutely. Sir Charles... Please, please! Sir Charles... Don't worry, as long as you've told the truth, there's nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about. All right? - Be careful. - Thank you very much. Open it. Be careful. He tricked me! From the gentleman at the bar, madam. Good evening. Good evening. Monsieur Guy Gadbois, at your service. - How do you do? I'm Lady Litton. - Yes, I know. - Oh. - I took the liberty of finding out. I hope you are not offended. That depends on your intentions. Strictly honourable, I can assure you. A man sees a beautiful chicken, he can't help but be inquisitive, you know? Would you think it naughty of me if I offered to buy you a drink? But you already have. How about I buy myself one, and we'll drink it together? All right. Waiter... another Kahla and ginger ale, please. Well... If there is a Lady Litton, there must be a lord. - What? - Lord Litton. - Yes, he's in... - Yes? - ...plastics. - Oh, the plastic. - In... - Yes? Industrial plastics. Very interesting. Well... Here is looking at you, kid. You have anything to declare? Nothing. You may proceed. I come here very often, you know. I come here for the winter sports, - for the skiing. - So do I. Why have we never met? Well, it's quite simple, really. I get up at the crack of dawn... I'm so terribly sorry about that. I get up at the crack of dawn, always. Up the mountain, down the slopes on the piste. You must be a very good skier. Well, I started when I was a mere babe in arms. I could ski before I could even crawl. I'm terribly sorry, I beg your pardon. It's all right. This hotel is deteriorating rapidly. Well... Here's to you, Monsieur Gadbois. Is that your own parrot? - No, it comes with the hotel. - Does it? Someone let it out of its cage, and I can't get it back in. - You need another glass. - I most certainly do. Swine parrot. What is it you do, Monsieur Gadbois? Well, you know, I do a little bit of this and a little bit of that. A man of mystery. One might say that, yes. I would, of course, tell you more. But it would be safer for you if I did not. - Are you all right? - Of course I am. Yes? Excuse me, for moment I thought I was in your apartment. - Hello? - I am in your apartment. - It's for you. - For me? There is no need to leave on my account. There is need to leave on my account. - Hello? - Monsieur Gadbois? Yes, this is Monsieur Gadbois. Who is that speaking? Don't you know? Can't you guess? I'll give you a clue. This is the man who hates you. This is the man who more than anything else would like to see you dead and buried. The headwaiter that works at the little bistro on the rue des Beaux-Arts? No! This is Chief Inspector Dreyfus. Idiot! You understand that anyone could call up here and ask for Monsieur Guy Gadbois and say that they were Chief Inspector Dreyfus. What is your code name? Code name, huh? Code name? I don't have a code name. I never had a code name, lunatic! I understand that, sir, but only the real Inspector Dreyfus would know that he did not have a code name. Clouseau, why are you still in Switzerland? Because I am here attempting to interrogate Lady Litton and trying to find out where her husband is. Her husband is in Lugash. He's been there since Tuesday. Well, in that case, I will leave on the next available plane. Yes, sir, yes. Quite, quite. I quite understand what you mean, and I'm not arguing with you about that. That would be my advice, as well. Yes, absolutely. But... Yes, I can understand your feelings under the circumstances. Absolutely. Yes, that is quite right. But I must say to you, sir, whatever your feelings are, you must not call me here at any hour of the night or day. Even in an emergency. A little bit of this and a little bit of that add up sometimes. Thank you. Did I understand you to say you were leaving on the next plane? Regrettably, yes, yes. One of life's little tragedies, you know. - Aw! - So until we meet again... I will say... here is looking at you, kid. Is anything the matter? Yeah. Strange taste. Well... - au revoir. - Au revoir. The concierge, please. Monsieur Gadbois' room. Oh, no. Yes? Clouseau. Since you have seen fit to disregard my orders and remain in Switzerland... Don't interrupt! I want you to arrest Lady Litton! Arrest the Lady Litton? Immediately! If she is not in your custody within five minutes, you'll be checking parking meters in Martinique. Yes, sir. Five minutes! No, Cato, you fool, this is not the time. This is not the time, Cato! Come out of there, come out of there! This is the time! You stupid fool, you see what you did? You forgot the first rule of self-defence. Never be taken by surprise! I didn't expect to see you out of hospital so soon. My brown suit. Give me the valet. They did an excellent job of restoration on your yellow skin. Valet, this is Inspector Clouseau. Please send up my brown... Well, please send down my brown suit immediately. I cannot wait. As quick as you possibly can! Quicker, please! I can't wait for them. Help me get dressed. I have to go and arrest Lady Litton. Arrest Lady Litton, be sure, but on what charge? Hello, hello! This is Inspector Clouseau. Please connect me with Paris, France. Trocadero-3-7-1... Hello, oui. What? Who? Yes, yes, OK. I'll accept it. Hello, Clouseau. No, he's not here. On vacation. He won't be back for a week. I just spoke with him. He instructed me to arrest Lady Litton immediately. What? Yes! That's very easy for you to say. I would be delighted to arrest her, yes! On what charge? It could be embarrassing if I go to her and say, ""I arrest you in the name of the law."" She says ""On what charge?"" I do not have the answer. What? Oh, yes! And the same to you! Filthy swine. Cato, very strange. Chief Inspector Dreyfus calls me, tells me to arrest Lady Litton, immediately, without a charge I call him back, I find he's not in his office. Even stranger, I find he's gone away on vacation. Cato, things are very fishy in Denmark. - Switzerland. - Yes, there too. No more. No more, I've had enough. This time it ends with a bullet in his brain. Brain. - Bonjour... - Shh. Merci. Bonjour, madame. Breakfast. Voil. Just leave it over there. I'll sign for it later. How about a little tip? Charles, darling. All right, all right. Now where is it? After all these years, you need to ask? I'm quite serious. Oh, I hope so. You hotel waiters lead such interesting lives. No, no, no, no, no. Not now, darling. Not now. Please, now, where is it? That depends on what you're looking for. Now, come on, Claudine. Please, not now. Where is it? I'm losing patience. I shall ask the hotel to send up another waiter. I should like very much if you would hand me over the Pink Panther, if it is not too much trouble. How did you find out so quickly? Feminine intuition. I thought it would take you at least another week. You know, you are very good at what you do. Thank you. I was prepared to surrender my body to Clouseau if it was necessary. Why did you do it? I didn't. I said I was prepared to. Aren't you a little bit proud of me? You nearly had me killed, you know. - It's better than dying of boredom. - Me? Bored with you? I'm sorry, darling. It's just that I never realised how tedious life could be for a retired jewel thief. Yuck. Clever little beast. Better than a hotel safe. Now tell me, how did you find out it was me? Well, there's something about a wife even with a beard. Now, come on, darling. It's time to get dressed, pack and go home. Now, come on, darling... Forgive the intrusion, madam, but you see before you a very disillusioned man. Disillusioned and with a gun. - He's obviously not with the hotel. - No. Allow me to introduce Colonel Sharki of the Lugash Secret Police. That explains the gun. I foolishly believed that your husband was a man of integrity. - That was foolish. - Thank you. You see, your husband and I, we had an arrangement. He was to do certain things, and if he didn't... You were to do certain things. Regrettably. Coffee, darling. I'm sorry, there's only one cup. I know I'm going to be sorry I asked this, but want to give me a for instance? First, you will hand over the Pink Panther. And second? I will be forced to shoot you. Who's forcing you? Open the door in the name of the law. Would you please, sir, answer the door? Excuse me, darling. Lady Litton, I am forced to arrest you! And if you do not open this door, I will have no alternative but to break it down. Very well. Guy, you're all wet! There's a defect in my plumbing. Lady Litton, listen to me. I have deceived you. I am not Guy Gadbois. I am Inspector Clouseau of the Sret, and it is my painful duty to arrest you. Do you know my husband? I must confess I do. I met him several years ago. When I meet him again, I'll arrest him immediately. Then you must have met Colonel Sharki. That idiot from the Secret Police. Yes, I know him. And when I... Sir Charles Litton, I arrest you in the name of the law, and I warn you that anything you say will be... Before you get all worked up, there's something you must know. He intends to kill all of us. - Who? - Colonel Sharki. Good Sharki Colonel God, we were just talking about you. As you can see, I've got the whole case buttoned up. Everything is sewn up. This is Sir Charles Phantom, the famous Pink Litton. Who stole the... What did you say? He was going to kill us? Well, if you can persuade him to change his mind... - You're joking, of course. - No. - You're going to kill me, as well? - With pleasure. Is there anything I can do that will make you change your mind? Well, there's nothing that I can think of. Supposing that I thought of something. - Hmm. For instance? - Well... For instance, supposing I told you that your fly was undone? By a remarkable coincidence, so is yours. Oh, no. Not again. Ah! I see you are familiar with the ""open fly"" ploy. Well, so am I. You also know the ""falling on the bed with the arm on the floor"" ploy. - He's been shot dead, idiot. - Don't call me an idiot. What? Who? Be careful, darling. He's either reloading or out of ammunition. He's out of his mind, that's what he's out of. I'll kill him! I'll kill him! - Monsieur! - I'll kill you! Get out of my way! Chief Inspector Dreyfus was tried and found not guilty, by reason of insanity. Clouseau, the famous detective, was decorated by General Wadafi. Then he went back to France, where I believe he took over the position vacated by the madman, Dreyfus. There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the largest diamond in the world. And surely, the most famous, or infamous, if you prefer. The Pink Panther. What ever happened to Sir Charles? As far as anyone knows, he still is living the quiet life at his villa in the South of France. Although there has been a rumour that the notorious Phantom is back at work, and although it has long been suspected that Sir Charles and the Phantom are one and the same, it has never been proved. Mark my words, Franois. Before the week is out, I will have proof that Sir Charles Litton is the Phantom. - Did you enjoy your food? - Oh, yes, yes. Very nice. You've probably guessed I have a passion for the Oriental food. Cato usually does some cooking for me, but recently he's taken to attacking me at every chance. It's very bad for the digestion. That is very strange, Franois. I don't ever recall receiving the fortune cookie in a Japanese restaurant. - What does it say? - We shall see... ""Beware of Japanese waitress bearing fortune cookies."" Japanese waitress? Cato, get off! Cato! No, you idiot! Oh, I'm so terribly sorry. I beg your... Stop, Cato! Enough, enough! Enough, I say! Get your hands off of me! You must remember my new position in the force! You have devastated my sukiyaki in there. You fool! You raving Oriental idiot! There is a time and a place for everything, Cato! And this is it. Kill him! Kill him!, - We have to stop seeing each other. - Your wife? That witch! How long this time? I'm afraid permanently. Permanently? - Permanently? - Yes. - She gave me an ultimatum. - Like you have no choice in the matter. - I haven't. - You have to. Get rid of her! - My own wife? - Get rid of her. Out! Why can't you? She's got enough evidence in her safety deposit box to ruin me. Her attorney has been told that if anything accidental happens to her... to give her box to the authorities. - Then get rid of the authorities. - What do you think I am? Get rid of her attorney. - I couldn't afford the scandal. - I'll show you a scandal. You know I don't love her. I need her respectability. - Permanently? - Yes! Six years together, just washed up? Just over with? - I'm afraid so. I'm sorry. - That's just wonderful, isn't it? You obviously can't go on being my secretary. I have deposited a substantial amount of money in your bank account-- - I don't want your money. - What do you want? I don't know what I want. But I'll think of something! Leaving early? Later than you think, Mr. Algo. Something you want me to do? Not unless she decides to be indiscreet. If you have to, be sure you make it look like an accident. Ahoy! Ahoy, the skipper! Hello, up there in the fog. Don't worry. It's only an old salty Swedish sea dog... out there from the salty seas, you know. Pumpin' the air in the parrot. Naughty bird afraid of the fog. Swine leg. Hello, lnspector. Chief lnspector. I will keep under the covers. No one must suspect a thing. What do you have of special interest... to my secret investigations? There's something big going down at Le Club Foot. Le Club Foot? Remarkable. Keep your-- Keep your eyes and ears peeled. Keep in constant contact. I am extremely grateful for this excellent piece of information. Thar she blows! Once again, I thank you for this most useful tip. And if there is anything I can ever do to repay you-- Now that you mention it, Chief lnspector-- Sixteen chests on a dead man's rum Yo ho ho in the bottle of the chest Drink to the devils and some for the rum-- Do it some more Yeah, give me some more All right Come on, yeah Slide it Move 'em out Move 'em out If you mess around with women, boy You wanna fix the trimmin' Better listen to me, cousin-- She's coming in now. - Bonsoir, Vic. - How you doing, Simone? Mr. Toledo, Mr. Vancouver. What's happening? You can show us to my usual table. How about something near the floor? Easier for dancing. No, thank you. I want my usual table. Is something wrong? It is Mr. Douvier's table, ain't it, love? No, it really ain't, love, but if you're worried about Mr. Douvier... why don't you give him a call? I wouldn't want you to get in trouble with your boss. - He ain't my boss. - He ain't? Then why you paying him all that money every month? - That ain't cool, baby. - You ain't seen nothing yet. Come on. Where we going? We don't want to be obvious. We've got to make our entrance through the back... in disguise, as I told you, you fool. Get up here. - It's a bakery. - I know that. Come on. At least you're not yellow anymore. This time I'm going to stand on your shoulders. What good would that do? - Because I'm taller than you, you fool. - Oh, yeah. Make a cradle. Get rid of that. I can't reach it. You'll have to find something to stand on. All right! Let me see some, baby. Come on. Do it, baby. Let me go! - Can you reach it? - Yes. - Hey, are you okay? - No. - You know something? You're terrific. - What? You're terrific. You saved my life. Come with me. - Where? - Over here. I want to save your life. - Let's go. Come on. - Oh, God. -Come with me before the killers see us. -What killers? - I'll tell you at my apartment. - What apartment? My apartment. Oh, my God! And mine, too. I'm soaked to the skin. Yes, I have received considerable soak also. Get out of those wet clothes before you catch your death of pneumonia. Yes. What shall I do with my coat? I don't want to spoil your beautiful-- Just put it down anywhere. Put it on the floor. That's fine. Help yourself. I'm going to change. I'll bring you a robe. I'm gonna put on some music. - You know, it's strange. - What? I say, it's strange. Yes, I know. And I said ""what?"" - You mean, what is strange? - Yes. It's strange... that I have never yet set foot in this building... but I have the distinct impression that I have been here before. It's called deja vu. I have it all the time. Yeah, deja vu. Thank you. You're welcome. - You okay? - Yes. That feels good. It's not going to do you much good if you don't take your pants off. - What? - Take your pants off. Forgot about those. Look at me. Look at my hands. I'm shaking like a leaf. I can't stop shaking. I know what it is. You know what it is? I'm just not used to being killed. - That's my first time, you know? - I know, but listen. When you have been killed as many times as I have, you get used to it. - Really? - Yes, oh, yes. Yes, indeed. I'll put this here. - Cheers. - Cheers. - This is for you. - Yes, of course. - Then this must be yours. - Thank you. Cheers. Yes. Anyway-- - You have nothing to fear. - Yes, I have. - No, you don't. - Yes, I have. No. You see, I am an officer of the law. - The ""lew""? - What? You said you are an officer of the ""lew""? That is correct. Yes, yes. I am Chief Inspector of the surete. What? You doubt me. No, I don't doubt you. Why should I doubt you? - That's right. Why should you? - If you say so, I don't. Who were those men who tried to kill you? - Killers. - How do you know? - Because they work for Douvier. - Douvier? I know that name. Everyone in France knows that name. He's a millionaire businessman. Yes, of course. Douvier the millionaire businessman. I knew I knew. But, how many people do you think know... that Douvier the millionaire businessman is also Douvier the French connection? How many? I suppose his mother, for one. Why do you suppose he wanted to have me killed? Elementary. He wanted you dead. - You all right? - I got singed. - I'm sorry about your robe. - That's all right. Tell me about this Douvier. I was his mistress and private secretary for two years. I know enough about Philippe to send him to prison for his whole life. You keep talking about this Douvier. But who is Philippe? - Philippe Douvier. - His son? Whose son? He has no son. - His brother then? - His brother is Fred. - Then it has to be his father. - His father's dead. Now we're getting somewhere. Who killed him? - No one. He died of natural causes. - Then who is this Philippe? I want to see some identification. Right now. Right now. I want to see some identification. If you're not a policeman, then I shouldn't be telling you these things. - Can you keep a secret? - I don't know. That depends. Brace yourself for what I'm about to tell you. I am none other... then Staff lnspector Jacques Clouseau. No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. I am. You're not. Yes, you are. Oh, my God! I admit it's not a good photograph, but-- But I saw your funeral on television. Yes. Yes. Even the pope was there. Cheers. But if you're not dead, who's dead? A wandering transvestite took my car... and stole my clothes at gunpoint. I have been working under the covers tracking the killer. - The killer's Douvier! - What? He wanted to impress the godfather. What? You mean Douvier killed a wandering transvestite... just to impress his godfather? The man's unthinkable. The door. - What's wrong with it? - I saw the knob turn. Hurry. - I wonder whose apartment this is. - I don't know. The other one's probably upstairs waiting in my room. How do you know there's another one? Because assassins always travel in pairs. It's a company rule. Do you know what the Gannet Transaction is? The Gannet Transaction? What is that? It's a code name for a 50-million franc heroin sale. 50 million francs? Philippe's going to Hong Kong on Tuesday to meet with the American buyer. Hong Kong. I don't know how it fits in, but the Gannet's a boat. What are you doing? - I know why this place looks familiar. - Why? Chief lnspector Dreyfus lives here. I think he has received a faint. Wake up, Chief lnspector. Wake up. Chief lnspector? Hello? Are you in there, Chief lnspector? Hello? There's no reply. It's no use. We will have to go to Hong Kong without him. - We? - Yes. You, I and Cato, who will translate for us. Not me. I am not going to Hong Kong. Are you kidding? Douvier would shoot me on sight. Not if he doesn't recognize you. And he won't. Why not? We will leave that up to the great Balls. The great Balls? At your service! Please forgive the condition of my establishment... but as the lnspector knows-- - Chief lnspector knows-- - Auguste. So sorry. I beg your pardon. But as the Chief lnspector knows, we were bombed. Sounds like you still are. Almost all my collection was either destroyed or damaged. Starting Monday, I have to have a fire sale. You could call it ""The Great Balls of Fire"" sale. A catchy suggestion. Very good. Cunny! I can't tell you how good it is to see that you are still alive. It has been my privilege to serve the good lnspector... the Chief lnspector, for, lo, this many years. Thirteen, to be precise. And his reported demise was a real blow to me. Something's coming. Yes, Cunny, you are not dreaming. Our friend, our customer, is alive! Hello, Cunny. Now, how can I serve you? Through wind and mud, snow and hail... whether long or short, dark or pale, remember... that when duty calls... you've got Balls. I gotta sit down. Yes, of course. Cunny! Quick. Please, please, please. Come along. That's right. There you are. - Sit. Come, come, come. Sit, sit. - You're not serious. There has been no time to get new furniture. Believe me, since the blast, he's much more comfortable. Please sit. Matter of fact, I've been sleeping on him. Chief lnspector? I'm leaving for Hong Kong in the morning. Hong Kong? Could you pick me up some cheap coolie hats? My dear Auguste, I need your best Hong Kong disguise. Also, I will need something extra special in the godfather line. Doctor, please, you must help me. Is Clouseau real... or am I going mad again? - What do you think? - What do I think? What can I think? If that nincompoop is really alive... and the things I heard are true, he'll probably be decorated again... for rounding up the biggest drug ring in France... and I'll be a laughingstock. That sounds reasonable. What are you going to do? What choice do I have? I either commit myself and come back to be locked up in here... or... I go to Hong Kong. - I don't think I can do this. - Of course you can. Just think yellow and follow me. ""Mr. and Mrs. Low Key."" You stupid lunk! What the hell do you think you're doing? Absolutely ruined my suit! Why the hell don't you look where you're going? I'm Mr. Algo. When Mr. Scallini arrives, have me paged in the bar. Certainly, Mr. Algo. Who is gonna pay for my suit? See that man there? That's Guy Algo, Philippe's right-hand man. This Scallini must be Mr. Big from New York. Listen, we'll go up to the room. You stay here ten minutes, then tell Mr.-- - Algo. - Right, yes. Algo. That Mr. You-Know-Who has arrived, and bring him to the room. - Mr. You-Know-Who? - Right. I will be Mr. You-Know-Who. Come, Ming Loy. You got a reservation for Scallini? Page Mr. Algo in the bar. Tell him Mr. Scallini is here. - What do you think you're doing? - Mr. Scallini in lobby. You heard what I said to him? Dumb Frenchman. ""Cochon."" That means pig. I tell Mr. Scallini you're here. - Listen, boss-- - It's not boss. It's me! Where is he? In the bathroom getting into his godfather disguise. Algo's in the next room. Scallini's down the hall in the Tang suite. - Marvelous. - We rode up in the same elevator. Maybe I can reach him before he contacts Philippe. - What are you going to do? - I'm not sure. Keep your eye on Algo. - Ice? - Please. - Soda? - Yes. I hope it's not too strong. I'm sure it will be fine. Hey! Mama Mia. Spaghettini du AI Pacino! Carlo, Cato and me got a little business to talk over. We won't be long. Have another drink. Viva Zapata! - Where is she? - I don't know. Get out-- Hello, Mr. Marchione. - Hey. Come on in. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Can I get you a drink? No, nothing, thank you. It's Simone. You have a good memory. I never forget a pretty face. Boss, this is Simone. That's Douvier's personal-- Secretary. How do you do, Mr. Scallini? We never met before. If we meet before, you call me Julio. - That's a nice hand. - Thank you. That's only the right one. - You type, too. - 100 words a minute. I may faint. Mr. Douvier has asked me to apologize. He's going to be a little late. If you like, I'd be happy to keep you company until he arrives. If I like? Does my mother cook spaghetti? To the Gannet Transaction. Shall I tell Douvier we're on our way? Don't forget the money. What? Throat! Back! Choking! You want me to hit you on the back. We're on our way. - Mr. Douvier will meet us in the lobby. - Yeah. Great. - Is that it? - Yeah. 50 million francs and no bodyguard? Listen, buddy, I take care of my body, my body takes care of me. You know what I'm driving at? I'll buy some cigarettes, huh? Yeah, smoke a few. When Douvier shows, I'll meet you in the lobby. Right. Be right with you. What the hell is going on here? Lee Kee shipyards. - Where'd he go? - I think to Lee Kee shipyards. My cart! You see this? I can tell by your heart line you're a passionate man. See how long this is? Keep watching. It's going to get longer. - Hello. - Lee Kee shipyards. Douvier. It was Douvier! The doorman heard him tell the driver to go to the Lee Kee shipyard. Something is caccuzza around here. Your boss and a couple boys just left the hotel. Really? I wonder why they did that? You got me. Why don't we go ask him? Yes. Okay, I understand. Douvier left the hotel about five minutes ago. He was with two men. He told the driver to go to the Lee Kee shipyard. I'm sure it was that nincompoop. I'm sure Mr. Douvier didn't intend to be gone very long. - We'll see. - It doesn't make much sense. If you leave, and then he comes back-- Stop worrying. You give yourself wrinkles. What about this Lee Kee shipyard? Perfectly legitimate as far as I know. They build a line of expensive power cruisers and sailboats. Maybe Mr. Douvier is just buying himself a yacht. Lee Kee shipyards? Yeah, that's what the como si chiamare said. Move it! Come along! This is Mr. Chow, our Far Eastern representative. - Mr. Scallini. - It's an honor to meet you. - You remember Mr. Algo. Shall we go? - This way, please. After you launch the boat, we'll go to Mr. Chow's office. You can sign the ownership papers. Everything legal and aboveboard. Above the board. Good, good. - Where is it? You know-- - I understood you were told. No. I was told. But I'm checking, you know. - In the keel. - The old keel ploy. Yes. All you have to do is sail her around the Caribbean for a while... haul her out of the water, take the midsection out of the keel... and voila, 40 kilos of the finest merchandise... your experts have ever tested. I'll tell you, it better hell be the best merchandise... 'cause my experts certainly have tested some. - We have faith in our merchandise. - That's good. All right. Now, would you like to launch her? I would be delighted. September. A good month for the vintage. Congratulations! He must be a cop! Get him! Get him! Hey, boss! Look out, you are an idiot! What are you doing? Jesus Christ! You crumb! Get back here, you slob! It's me! I know! Wait! Hey, cancel the artillery! I don't care! Get out of my way! - Al, where are you? - How do I know? Wherever you are, this is Chief lnspector Clouseau. I'm warning you that if you are not careful... I will arrest you all in the name of the law. You and your bright ideas. Let me get my hands on you. Clouseau? Yes? - Are you wounded? - No. Fortunately I was saved by the darkness. So what we need is more light. Look what you did to my shoes! Hello, Philippe. Simone, what the hell are you doing here? I'm waiting for the firecrackers to go off. - What firecrackers? - The ones I stuck in your pants. Hello. I'm sorry I'm late. I had some important police business to attend to, you know. - Everything's all right? - Yes, absolutely fine. Allow me to let you in the car. Please. - It's beautiful. - It's rather neat, isn't it? I call it the Silver Hornet. Yes. It's a little overdue for service, unfortunately. Perhaps it's better to leave that there. It's a beautiful night. Why don't we walk? What an excellent idea. - I'm sorry about that. - It's quite all right. You look ravishing tonight. - Yes, I know that. - You know that? I knew that you knew that. You did? I knew you knew I knew that. What made you decide to become a detective? It's not something one decides every day of the week, you know. But in my case, it began when my great aunt was kidnapped... and held for ransom by an unlicensed Armenian phrenologist. An Armenian phrenologist? Yes, you know. A man who reads the ""bimps"" on the head. - The ""bimps""? - What?, What's your name again? Chrissie. Where are we going? Swimming. Slow up. Slow down. I'm not drunk! Slow down! Wait. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm definitely coming. Whoa. Hold on. Whoa! I can swim. I just can't walk or undress myself. Come on in the water! Take it easy. Oh, God, help! Please help me! I'm coming. It hurts! ...local fishing reported good. Amity Boat Rental Yard's opening early to prepare for the annual seasonal rush. This is WISS... How come the sun didn't use to shine in here? We bought the house in the fall, and this is summer. Somebody feed the dogs. Right. Do you see the kids? They must be in the back yard. In Amity you say ""yard."" They're in the ""yard,"" not too ""far"" from the ""car."" How's that? Like you're from New York. Mum, I got cut. I got hit by a vampire. You were playing on those swings, weren't you? Those swings are dangerous. Stay off there. I haven't fixed them yet. I think you're going to live. - It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen. - Hello. - Yes. - Can I go swimming? Yeah, but let me clean this thing off first. What do they usually do? Wash up, or float up, or what? Oh, no. Keep them there. I'll be out in about 15, 20 minutes. All right? - Dry you off. - Okay. Go on, get a Band-Aid. Got to go. Missing person. Season hasn't started. Nobody's even here yet. Listen, Chief... be careful, will you? In this town? Hi, Dad. Wait a minute. Let me get on. I want my cup back! You'll get it. Wave goodbye. Bye. Nobody saw her go into the water? Somebody could've. I was sort of passed out. You mean, she ran out on you? No, sir. She must've drowned. Look, I reported it to you, didn't I? You live here? No. Hartford. I go to Trinity. My folks live in Greenwich. Your folks were born here, right? Yeah, I'm an Islander. They moved off when my dad retired. You an Islander? No. New York City. You here for the summer? Come on. Hold it. Oh, Jesus. Well, you're up awful early. Is the Chief in there? Chief, what have you got on? If this new filing system is to work, you must keep outdated stuff off my desk. - Just the pending, all right? - Yes, Chief. We got a bunch of calls about that karate school. It seems that the 9-year-olds from the school have been karate-ing the picket fences. Chief Brody's office. The medical inspector. The Fire Chief wants you to go over the Fourth of July... Polly, I want a list of the water activities that the city fathers are planning for today. - Right away. - Hendricks! Where do we keep the ""Beach Closed"" signs? - We never had any. - No? There's a dead truck with New Hampshire plates in front of my store. Just have him fill out the form. Just fill it out. Look what the kids did to my fence. 8 and 9-year-olds... - Glasses? - Yeah, glasses. I'll call you later in the afternoon. I promise. This stuff ain't going to help me in August. The summer ginks come down here in June. You haven't got one thing on here I ordered. Not a beach umbrella, not a sun lounger, no beach balls. If I can't get service... Chief, Polly sent me to tell you that there's a bunch of Boy Scouts out in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phones out there. Okay. Come on, get out of there. Take this stuff back to the office and get to work on those signs. ""Beaches Closed. No Swimming. By order of the Amity P.D."" Let Polly do the printing. What's the matter with my printing? Let Polly do the printing. Chief Brody! What have you got there? Listen, we had a shark attack at South Beach this morning, Mayor. Fatal. I have to batten down the beach. Albert, come on, you kook. Keep your arms up. Charlie, take me out to those kids, will you? Martin, you're going to shut down the beaches on your own authority? What other authority do I need? Technically, you need a civic ordinance or a resolution by a board of... That's just going by the book. We're really a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here. This is your first summer, you know. What does that mean? I'm only trying to say that Amity is a summer town. We need summer dollars. If they can't swim here they'll be glad to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod, the Hamptons, Long Island. That doesn't mean we serve them a smorgasbord. But we've never had that kind of trouble in these waters. What else could've done that to that girl? A boat propeller? I think possibly, yes, a boating accident. That's not what you told me on the phone. I was wrong. We'll have to amend our reports. And you'll stand by that? I'll stand by that. Martin, a summer girl goes swimming, swims out a little far. She tires, fishing boat comes along... It's happened before. I don't think you appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things. Larry, I appreciate it. I'm just reacting to what I was told. Martin, it's all psychological. You yell, ""Barracuda!"" And everybody says, ""Huh? What?"" You yell, ""Shark!""... we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July. Okay. You can take us back now. Here's mommy, here. I'm going to get my raft and go back out in the water. Let me see your fingers. Alex Kintner, they're beginning to prune. Just let me go out a little longer. Just 10 more minutes. Thanks. There are no Islanders. None of them are from the island. It's just a big bother. They're bringing in... All I want to know... I just want to know one simple thing. When do I get to become an Islander? Ellen, never. You're not born here, you're not an Islander. That's it. Nantucket Ferries... to Amity, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket islands. Monday to Thursday, 8:40, 1:15, 5:45 and 6:00 p.m. Starting July 1, 8:30 p.m... Come back here. - But don't bother him. Come right back. - Okay. I won't. Martin, I know you got a lot of problems downtown but I've got problems at the house I wish you'd take care of. One, I've got some cats parking in front of the house, I can't get... And that garbage truck next to the office, that's terrible. What I need is a red zone. It's a simple thing you can take care of. - You've done it before. - Come here a minute, please. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Listen, if the kids going in the water is worrying you they can play out here on the beach. It's all right. Let them go. It's cold. We know all about you, Chief. You don't go in the water at all, do you? That's some bad hat, Harry. Chief Brody, you are uptight. Come on. That's it. Oh, do you know the muffin man The muffin man Tippet! Did you see that? Blood! Everybody out! Get them out! Michael, get out of the water! Alex? We don't even know if there's a shark around here. I can't argue with you. I can't talk to you. I have to talk to Mrs. Kintner. Because this is turning into a contest. It's not just the Gazette. She's advertising in out-of-town papers. I suggest we move back to council chambers where we'll have more room. I'm responsible for public safety here. Then go out tomorrow and see that no one gets hurt. It's a small story. I'll bury it as deep as I can. The ad will run on the back along with the grocery ads. Right in here, please. Move on in, please. Why do you insist on playing the heavy? I have a point of view and I think it speaks for many of the people here. Not only me, because I have the motel. How do you feel about it? Let's have some order. Let's have order, please. Any special questions? Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark in cash or check? I don't think that's funny. I don't think that's funny at all. All right. That's private business between you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner. Martin, would you please... Chief Brody. I just want to tell you what we're planning so far. What about the beaches, Chief? We're going to put on the extra summer deputies as soon as possible. And then we're going to try and use shark spotters on the beach. Are you going to close the beaches? Yes, we are. We also plan to bring in experts from the Oceanographic Institute on the mainland. Only 24 hours. I didn't agree to that. Only 24 hours. Twenty-four hours is like three weeks! You all know me. Know how I earn a living. I'll catch this bird for you. It ain't going to be easy. Bad fish. Not like going down to the pond and chasing bluegills or tommy cods. This shark, swallow you whole. Shaking, tenderizing. Down you go. And we got to do it quick. Got to bring back the tourists that'll put all your businesses on a paying basis. But it's not going to be pleasant. I value my neck a lot more than $3,000, Chief. I'll find him for $3,000, but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000. You got to make up your minds. Gonna stay alive and ante up, gonna play it cheap and be on welfare the whole winter. I don't want no volunteers. I don't want no mates. There's too many captains on this island. $10,000 for me, by myself. For that, you get the head, the tail, the whole damn thing. Thank you very much, Mr. Quint. We'll take it under advisement. Mr. Mayor, Chief, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, God, you scared me. You know, Ellen, people don't even know how old sharks are. I mean, if they live 2,000, 3,000 years... They don't know. Enough. You're not going to even be able to go to sleep tonight. Here. Come on. Thanks. Want to get drunk and fool around? Oh, yeah. Mikey really loves his present. Where is he? Sitting in it. Good God. All right, Michael, out of the boat! Tied up to the jetties, sitting in the boat. I'm helping Michael. Get out of that boat! Hi, Dad. Just a little longer. Please? It's his birthday. I don't want him on the ocean! He's not on the ocean, he is in a boat. He won't go in the water. I don't think he'll go in the water again, after what happened yesterday. All right, now don't say that. I don't want that to happen, you know that. I want him to read the boating regulations, the rules, before he goes out on his own. Michael, did you hear your father? Out of the water now! Now! I'm tired. Let's stop before someone reports us. Don't worry. The Chief lives on the other side of the island. Am I coming in straight? Don't worry about it. Just keep rowing. We better catch something, this is my wife's holiday roast. Don't worry about it. $3,000 buys an awful lot of roast. Come and get it. The tide's taking it right out. Can't we go home? He's taking it. Go! Charlie, take my word for it, don't look back! Swim, Charlie! Come on! To me, boy! Come on, Charlie! Swim! Come on, Charlie, keep coming. Keep swimming. Come on, a little more. Atta boy. I can't get up. Give me your hand, Charlie. Help me! Get your feet out of the water! Can we go home now? So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat. That's not funny. That's not funny at all. Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field & Stream. Looks more like The National Enquirer. All right, hold it. Hold everything. I said, hold it! Hello. Hello back, young fellow. How are you? Say, I hope you're not going out with those nuts, are you? The Weetock boats gotta move out first. You have to move out or he can't get out at all. Don't raise sail, you're going to luff it. You got a paddle? - I got a paddle. - Scull it out of here. Officer, wait a second. How many guys are you going to put aboard that boat? Whatever's safe, right? Yeah, well that ain't safe. Watch it, that's dynamite. What are you doing with that? Where are you going with that? I'm going on the boat. Please, help me get those guys out of the boat, will you? - Sure. - Come on. Gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you that you're overloading that boat! Go on, get out of here. You ain't going. What do you care? Can you tell me if there's a good restaurant or hotel on the island? Yeah, you walk straight ahead. They're all going to die. Listen to me. We've got some road block signs outside. You've got to get somebody to help us. Yeah, get those road block signs out on the highway. Because we've got more people down here than we can handle. What're you doing there? These are your people. Go talk to them. They aren't my people. They're from all over. You see all the license plates? Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey. I'm all by myself out there. What happened to the extra help... It's not until the Fourth of July. Till then, it's you and me. You know those guys in the fan-tail launch? None of them are getting out of the harbor alive. That's what I'm saying. You know their names. Talk to those clowns. Everyone's having a good time today. Tell me about it. Polly, I'll get back to you. Could you tell me how I could find Chief Brody? Who are you? Matt Hooper. I'm from the Oceanographic Institute. Oh, for Christ's sakes. You're the guy we called. I'm Brody. - Oh. I'm glad to meet you. - Me, too. I know you got a lot on your hands. What can we do for you? The best thing to do is to see the remains of the first victim, the girl on the beach. Okay, fine. Just bear with me, will you? Sure. Wait till we get them silly bastards down in that rock pile. There'll be some fun. They'll wish their fathers hadn't met their mothers when they start digging the bottoms out and slamming into them rocks, boy. Get away from there, you goddamn fool! What's the matter with you? You want to swamp us, you crazy son of a bitch? What are these guys doing out here? What are they doing back there? They're chumming right now. What the hell is that? They're tracking the shark. $3,000 divided four ways is what? Watch your starboard. Jesus! Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident. ""Victim identified as Christine Watkins, female Caucasian."" And here's the way we have it. ""Probable boating accident."" The height and weight of the victim can only be estimated from the partial remains. The torso has been severed in mid-thorax. There are no major organs remaining. May I have a glass of water? The right arm has been severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss in the upper musculature. Thank you very much. Partially denuded bone remaining. This was no boat accident. Did you notify the Coast Guard about this? No. It was only local jurisdiction. The left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum and portions of the rib cage are intact. Do not smoke in here. Thank you very much. This is what happens. Indicates the non-frenzy feeding of a large squalus possibly longimanus or Isurus glaucus. The enormous amount of tissue loss prevents any detailed analysis however, the attacking squalus must be considerably larger than any normal squalus found in these waters. Didn't you get out a boat and check these waters? No. Well, this is not a boat accident. And it wasn't any propeller. It wasn't any coral reef. And it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. I wanna go AP and UPI. I want to get on the state wire services. See if Boston will pick it up and go national. Call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him he owes me a favor. This is the shot I want with everybody and the fish in it. Guys, could we please get organized? I want to get a picture for the paper. Now, can we just have the... Ben Gardner get this? No, we caught it. That's swell. It's a beauty. Guys, please, I need a picture for the paper. Clear out of the way, please. Just the guys that caught the fish. Open it up a little bit. I want to get a picture of the guy with the fish. Come on. I need a picture for the paper. Could we get the sign, please? Kneel down, just like in high school. One row kneeling, one row standing. Come on, just get out of the way. Young fellow, could you step out of the picture? Take your rake with you. - We're ready. - Thank you. Can you get that, please. How's that? Larry, you won't believe it. What kind of a shark is that? I don't know. I think it's a mako. It's got a deep throat, Frank. Yeah, but what kind? What kind of shark? Tiger shark. A what? We can start breathing again. Is Ben getting plenty of pictures? Oh, you bet he is. What is this bite radius crap? That is a big mouth. You stuff your frigging head in there, man, and find out if it's a man-eater. All I'm saying is that it may not be the shark. It's just a slight... I want you to meet Matt. This is Larry Vaughn, our mayor. Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute. Nice to meet you. Terrific, huh, Mayor? There are all kinds of sharks in the waters. Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos. And the chances that these bozos got the exact shark... There are no other sharks like this here. It's 100-to-1. I'm not saying that this is not the shark. It probably is, Martin. It's a man-eater. It's extremely rare for these waters. But the fact is, the bite radius on this animal is different than the wounds on the victim. I want to be sure. You want to be sure. We all want to be sure, okay? What I want to do is very simple. The digestive system of this animal is very slow. Let's cut it open. Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours is bound to still be in there. And then we'll be sure. It may be the only way to confirm it. Look, fellows, let's be reasonable. This is not the time or the place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish. And I am not going to stand here and see that thing cut open and see that little Kintner boy spill out all over the dock. Chief Brody? Yes? I just found out that a girl got killed here last week. And you knew it. You knew there was a shark out there. You knew it was dangerous. But you let people go swimming anyway. You knew all those things, but still my boy is dead now. And there's nothing you can do about it. My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that. I'm sorry, Martin. She's wrong. No, she's not. All right, fellows let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down before it stinks up the whole island. Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow and dump it in the drink. Come here. Give us a kiss. Why? Because I need it. Get out of here. Can I help you? The door was open. Mind if I come in? I'm Matt Hooper. Oh, hi. Ellen Brody. - Your husband's home? - Yes. I'd really like to talk to him. Yes, so would I. Come in. Can I get you some coffee? No. Nothing, thank you. Oh, wine. How nice. How was your day? Swell. I got red and white. I didn't know what you'd be serving. Oh, that's nice. Is anyone eating this? No. My husband tells me you're in sharks. Excuse me. Yes. I've never heard it quite put that way. But yes, I am. I love sharks. You love sharks? Yeah, I love them. When I was 12 years old, my father got me a boat and I went fishing off of Cape Cod. I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in I hooked a 4.5 foot baby thresher shark who proceeded to eat my boat. He ate my oar, hooks, and my seat cushions. He turned an inboard into an outboard scared me to death, and I swam back to shore. When I was on the beach, I turned around and actually saw my boat being taken apart. Ever since then, I have been studying sharks and that's why I know that I'm going to go to the Institute tomorrow and tell them that you still have a shark problem here. - Why do you have to tell them that? - Sorry. I'm sorry, I thought that... You told me the shark was caught. I heard it on the news. I heard it on the Cape station. They caught a shark, not the shark. Not the shark that killed Chrissie Watkins. And probably not the shark that killed the little boy. Which I wanted to prove today by cutting the shark open... You may want to let that breathe... Nothing. You know, you'll be the only rational man left on this island after I leave tomorrow. Where are you going? I am going on the Aurora. The Aurora? What is that? It's a floating asylum for shark addicts. It's pure research, 18 months at sea. Martin hates boats. Martin hates water. Martin sits in his car when we go on the ferry to the mainland. I guess it's a childhood thing. There's a clinical name for it, isn't there? Drowning. Is it true that most people get attacked by sharks in three feet of water about 10 feet from the beach? Yeah. And that before people started to swim for recreation... I mean, before sharks knew what they were missing that a lot of these attacks weren't reported? That's right. Now this shark that swims alone - what's it called? - Rogue. Rogue, yeah. This guy, he keeps swimming around in a place where the feeding is good until the food supply is gone, right? That's called territoriality. It's just a theory that I happen to agree with. Then why don't we have one more drink and go down and cut that shark open? Martin? Can you do that? I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police. We start in the alimentary canal and open the digestive tract. Just like I thought. What? Came up in the Gulf Stream, from southern waters. He didn't eat a car, did he? No. Tiger shark's like a garbage can. It'll eat anything. Somebody probably threw that in the river. That's it. I've got to close the beach, call the Mayor. You got a bigger problem than that, Martin. You still got a hell of a fish out there with a mouth about this big. How do we confirm that by morning? If he is a rogue, and there's any truth to territoriality at all we got a good chance of spotting him between Cape Scott and South Beach. Where are you going? To find him. He's a night feeder. On the water? We're not gonna find him on the land. I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat. Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - I can't do that. - Yes, you can. I'm telling you, the crime rate in New York will kill you. There's so many problems, you never feel like you're accomplishing anything. Violence, rip-offs, muggings. The kids can't leave the house. You've got to walk them to school. But in Amity, one man can make a difference. In 25 years, there's never been a shooting or a murder in this town. No kidding? Want a pretzel? Where are we? We're right in the stretch where he's been feeding. Can you get The Late Show on this thing? No, it's a closed circuit TV system. I have underwater cameras fore-and-aft. Who pays for all this stuff? The government? The Institute? This stuff costs a lot of money. I paid for this mostly myself, actually. - You're kidding. - No. - You rich? - Yeah. How much? Personally, or the whole family? Doesn't make any sense. They pay a guy like you to watch sharks? Well, it doesn't make sense for a guy who hates the water to live on an island either. It's only an island if you look at it from the water. That makes a lot of sense. What is that thing doing? Well, it's a fish finder. It's probably just a school of mackerel or something, all clumped together. Wait a minute. There's something else out there. What is it? About 100 yards, south-southwest. That's Ben Gardner's boat. You know him? It's all banged up. Sure I know him. He's a fisherman. What happened? Martin, I gotta go down and check their hull. Wait. Why don't we just tow it all in? We will. I just got to check something out. Hit the lights for me. Let's tow it in. Don't worry, Martin. Nothing's going to happen. What am I supposed to do while you're gone? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Don't touch any of the equipment. I'll be back in two minutes. This is a great white, Larry. A big one. Any shark expert will tell you it's a killer, a man-eater. The situation is that apparently a great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island. He'll continue to feed here as long as there's food in the water. There's no limit to what he'll do. We've had three incidents. Two people killed within a week. It'll happen again. It happened before. The Jersey beach, 1916. - Five people were killed... - In one week. Tell him about the swimmers. A shark is attracted to the exact kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever human beings swim. You can't avoid it. Opening the beaches on the Fourth of July is like ringing the dinner bell. Look, Mr. Vaughn I pulled a tooth the size of a shot glass out of the wrecked hull of a boat out there. It was the tooth of a great white. It was Gardner's boat, all chewed up. I helped tow it in. You should've seen it! Where is that tooth? Did you see it, Brody? I didn't see it. He dropped it on the way in. I had an accident. And what did you say the name of this shark is? It's a Carcharodon carcharias. It's a great white. You don't have the tooth? Look, we depend on the summer people for our very lives... You won't have a summer unless you deal with this problem! We have to close the beach and hire someone to kill the shark! We have to tell the Coast Guard. You'll have to contact the Shark Research Panel. You'll have to ring this entire harbor! I don't think either one of you are familiar with our problems! I think that I am familiar with the fact that you'll ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass! Wait a second! There are two ways to deal with this problem! You either kill this animal or cut off its food supply. We have to close the beaches. Brody? Sick vandalism. That is a deliberate mutilation of a public service message. I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their Buster Browns. That's it. I won't waste my time arguing with a man who's lining up to be a hot lunch. I'm gonna see you later, Brody. Don't do this. He's not... What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks. And that's all. Why don't you take a long, close look at this sign? Those proportions are correct. You'd love to prove that, wouldn't you? Get your name into the National Geographic. Larry, if we make an effort today, we might be able to save August. August? For Christ's sake, tomorrow's the Fourth of July! We will be open for business. It'll be one of the best summers we've ever had. If you are concerned about the beaches, do whatever you have to, to make them safe. But those beaches will be open for this weekend. I want to know how many men you're going to send. There is no need for me to come to Brisbane when I have a great white shark right here! We need men to patrol the swimming area. We've got to have help. Anybody with a gun or a boat. Monday! Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there? He's the little guy with a crew cut. Operator, isn't there a phone on the island? Could you connect me, please? Come on, get him! Careful on the beach. Brody to Gotcha, do you read me? The guys from the TV station on the mainland are here. All right. I'll get to them later. Brody to Scutbucket, please come in. Brody to Daisy, do you read me? Fascinating Rhythm, do you read me? Come in, Hooper. What do you see? Nothing here, Martin. And nothing on sonar. Amity Island has long been known for its clean air, clear water and beautiful white-sand beaches. But in recent days a cloud has appeared on the horizon of this beautiful resort community. A cloud in the shape of a killer shark. That is very shocking in the outfield. Two balls, one strike, runners at first and third... Fly ball, deep left field. Jerry Christian goes back, running back near the wall and he takes it for the out. Oh, hi, Larry. Why aren't you in the water? I just put some suntan lotion on, and I'm trying to absorb some... Nobody's going in. Please, get in the water. Mike, come here. Listen, Mike. Do me a favor, will you? You and the other guys take the boat and put it in the pond instead? The pond is for old ladies. I know it's for the old ladies, but just do it for the old man. Please? All right. Thanks. I've got Sean. Michael! Wait! Michael, I don't like you no more. I can stand Harry, you know... Daisy, this is Hendricks. Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over. Hendricks, this is Daisy here. I don't see anything. False alarm. Must be this glare. I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have in fact caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers. As you see, it's a beautiful day. The beaches are open, and people are having a wonderful time. ""Amity,"" as you know, means ""friendship."" My God! Jesus Christ! Fin! Shark! 350! Get in there as fast as you can! Red one. Martin, get them the hell out of the water. No whistles! Everybody, please, get out of the water. Everybody out of the water. Don't push! Everybody out of the water, please. Come on! I want them out of there, guys. Give an answer, please. What's going on out there? He made me do it. He talked me into it. Please, move back. Give these people some air. Please, move back. Martin, it's just a hoax. There are two kids with a cardboard fin. Is everyone there okay? Everyone get out of the water all right? Folks, we had some practical joker down there with a fake fin... Shark! A shark! It's going into the pond! Shark in estuary! Now what? Michael's in the pond. It's going in the pond! Somebody do something! It's in the pond! Hurry up, get that done. I can't do a damn thing. Get that rope undone. You gotta untangle that up there. I'm doing it! Hey, fellows, haul in your sheet. Make it fast. You guys okay over there? In the pond! Somebody get a gun and shoot it! Doesn't anybody have a gun? Is he dead? No, he's not. He's in shock. Doctor said he's okay. Mild shock. He can go home in the morning. Thank you. How's my big kid? I'm all right. You going to miss me tonight? You can watch television. Want me to bring anything from home? My cars. What about ice cream? Coffee. Want to take him home? Back to New York? No. Home, here. I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry. You got a pen, Larry? Yeah, a pen, you know. 'Cause you're going to do what you do best. You're going to sign this voucher so I can hire a contractor. I don't know if I can do that without... I'm going to hire Quint to kill the shark. - August? - What? What are you talking about? Summer's over. You're the mayor of Shark City. People think you want the beaches open. I was acting in the town's best interest. You were acting in the town's best interest. That's why you'll do the right thing. That's why you're going to sign this, and we'll pay that guy what he wants. My kids were on that beach, too. Sign it, Larry. $10,000. $200 a day, whether I catch him or not. You've got it. Get the Mayor off my back so I don't have more of this zoning crap. You've got that. One case of apricot brandy, and you buy the lunch. Two cases. And you get dinner when you get back. Champagne, pte de foie gras, Iranian caviar, and don't forget the color TV. Chief, you try this. Made it myself. Pretty good stuff. Thanks. Here's to swimming with bow-legged women. Excuse me, Chief. Can't get a good man these days, under 60. All gone at least 35 years. Don't drink that. Mr. Quint... You're gonna need an extra hand. - This is Matt Hooper. - I know who he is. I've crewed three Trans Pacs. Transplants? He's from the Oceanographic Institute. And an America's Cup trial. Mr. Hooper, I'm not talking about pleasure boating or day-sailing. I'm talking about working for a living. I'm talking about sharking. I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about finding a great white. Porkers? Talking about porkers? Just tie me a sheepshank. I haven't had to pass basic seamanship in a long time. You didn't say how short you wanted it. How's that? Give me your hands. Dogfish? You got a $5,000 net and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it. Along comes Mr. Whitey, and when he's finished with that net it looks like a kiddies' scissors class has cut it up for a paper doll. You got city hands, Mr. Hooper. You been counting money all your life. I don't need this. I don't need this working-class-hero crap. You're not going to do this aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint? Maybe I should go alone. It's my party. It's my charter. Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party. It's my vessel. You're on board my vessel, I'm mate, master, pilot and I'm captain. I'll take him for ballast, Chief. You got him. ""Straight-jet, killing lance. ""Tail rope, eye splice, M-1, handy billy, pliers, irons..."" Sample bottles, dye marker, flares, safety float temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG... What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? Take that stuff down below and you lash it secure, all right? Jesus H. Christ! When I was a boy, every squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman. What have you got here? A portable shower or a monkey cage? An anti-shark cage. Anti-shark cage? You go inside the cage? Cage goes in the water? You go in the water? Shark's in the water. Our shark. Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain For we've received orders for to sail back to Boston And so nevermore shall we see you again Did you take your Dramamine? Yes. I put an extra pair of glasses in your black socks and there's the stuff for your nose, the zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit. Son of a bitch! Goddamn women today, they can't handle nothing. Young girls just ain't quite smart like their grandmothers were. That's got to be Quint. Colorful, isn't he? He scares me. Don't use the fireplace in the den... What am I going to tell the kids? Tell them I'm going fishing. Break it up, will you, Chief? Daylight's wasting! Front, bow. Back, stern. Better get it right, squirt, or I throw your ass out the little round window on the side! Come on, Chief. This isn't no Boy Scout picnic. See you got your rubbers. ""Here lies the body of Mary Lee Died at the age of 103 ""For 15 years she kept her virginity ""Not a bad record for this vicinity"" All right, Commissioner, fasten your safety belt! If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow! Up periscope. Rig for depth charge. Stand by fire drill. Damage control report. Nor'easter coming, bad news for Madison Avenue. I'm tired of that. How's the missus, Chief? If they don't like you going out, they'll love you coming in. Keep that chum line going, Chief. We got five good miles on it. Who's driving this boat? Nobody. The tide. One time, I caught a 16-footer off Montauk. Had to stick two barrels in him. Two to wear him down and bring him up. Nowadays, these kids, they take out everything. Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes. Jesus H. Christ. Chief, best drop another chum marker. Damn it, Martin! This is compressed air. What the hell kind of a knot was that? You pulled the wrong one! You screw around with these tanks, and they're going to blow up. Yeah, that's real fine, expensive gear you've brought out here, Mr. Hooper. I don't know what that bastard shark's going to do with it. Might eat it, I suppose. Seen one eat a rocking chair one time. Next time, you just ask me which line to pull, right? Little brown eel comes out of the cave swims into the hole comes out of the hole, goes back into the cave again. It's not too good, is it? Nothing's easy, is it? One more time. Little brown eel... I got it! - What? - Get behind me. Hooper, reverse her! Taking a hell of a lot of line! Chief, get the scoop out of the bucket! Wet the reel! Hooper, reverse her! Duck your head down. We're swinging. Get behind me again. No more water. I don't want you to drown me. Hooper, you idiot, starboard! Ain't you watching it! Hooper, neutral. Where'd he go now? He ain't fooling me. What's he yanking on now? Go on, try it. I don't know, Chief, if he's very smart or very dumb. Jesus... He's gone under. He's gone under the boat. I think he's gone under the boat. Yeah, it's too easy. He is a smart, big fish. He's gone under the boat. Keep her steady, now. I got something very big! I don't think so. Chief, put your gloves on. You put your gloves on, both of you! Getting ready to run out again. Quint, let it go. Maybe you're a big yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo! If you don't want to backstroke home, you get down here! You don't want to listen to me, don't listen to me. It's not a shark. The wire's showing. Unbuckle me. Get the other side. It's a tuna or swordfish wasting our time. Take this rod. Hooper, give the Chief a hand, will you? Right! Oh, shit! It may be a marlin or a stingray but it's definitely a game fish. Gaming fish? Marlin, stingray bit through this piano wire? Don't you tell me my business again. You get back on the bridge. Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing. It proves one thing, Mr. Hooper. You wealthy college boys don't have the education enough to admit if you're wrong. What's the point? Hooks and lines? You lose one, you rig one. Twelve minutes, south-southeast, now! Full throttle! Aye-aye, sir! You see, what I do, Chief, is I trick them to the surface. And then I jab at them. I'm not going to haul them up like a lot of catfish. Hooper, full throttle! I don't have to take this abuse much longer. Your head's bleeding. First aid there. Start that chum line again, will you? Let Hooper take a turn. Hooper drives the boat, Chief. Stop playing with yourself, Hooper. Slow ahead, if you please. You heard him. Slow ahead. Slow ahead. I can go slow ahead. Come on down and chum some of this shit. You're going to need a bigger boat. Shut off that engine. That's a 20-footer. Twenty-five. Three tons of him. We're going to need a bigger boat, right? Gotta get to work. How do we handle this? Come up front, Martin. I need you. He's circling the boat. This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca. Come in, Orca. Orca. Come in. I have Mrs. Martin Brody here. Put her on. Come on, Martin! Move! I'm not going out there! Beyond the edge of the barrels. Go to the end of the barrels, further out. - Further out! - Why? - Go further out! - What for? Will you go to the end of the pulpit? What? Will you go to the end of the pulpit? I need something in the foreground to give it some scale! Foreground my ass! Your husband's okay. He's fishing. He just caught some stripers. We'll bring them for dinner. We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out. I'm not staying here! I'm begging you! God damn it! Come here, darling. Chief, I want you up on the bridge, just take her forward, steady. I've never steered a boat in my life. Just watch my hand, take her steady. Mr. Hooper, attach the end of this line to the first keg. I've got to get a good shot at that porker's head. He's coming. Hooper? Get clear of the bow. Hurry up, will you? Your turn, Quint. Hooper, where are you? Hurry it up now, tie it on. He's coming straight for us. Don't screw it up now. Don't wait for me. Come on, Hooper, hurry it up! Tie it on! Now. Kill it! Now! Shoot! Time. What were you doing? You knew I had to get a clean shot right in the head. All right, let's see how long that barrel takes to bring him up. Bring another barrel! I'm coming around again! What do we do now? We're quitting, right? We got one barrel on him. We stay out here until we find him again. We could radio in and get a bigger boat... Don't you worry about it, Chief. It won't be permanent. You want to see something permanent? You want to feel something permanent? Just put your hand underneath my cap. You feel that little lump? Knocko Nolans, St. Patty's Day, Boston. I got that beat. It's a moray eel. It bit right through my wet suit. Well, Hoop, now, listen I don't know about that, but I entered an arm-wrestling contest in a bar in San Francisco. See this? I can't extend that. You know why? 'Cause in the semi-final celebrating my third wife's demise, big Chinese fellow, he pulled me right over. Look at that. That's a bull shark. He scraped me when I was taking samples. I got something for you. There's a thresher. You see that? A thresher's tail. - Thresher? - It's a shark. You want a drink? Drink to your leg? I'll drink to your leg. So we drink to our legs. I got the crme de la crme. Right here. Hold on. Here, you see that? You're wearing a sweater. Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit. She broke my heart. What's that one? What? That one, there. On your arm. A tattoo. I got that removed. Don't tell me. ""Mother."" What is it? Mr. Hooper, that's the U.S.S. Indianapolis. You were on the Indianapolis? What happened? Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief. I was coming back from the island of Tinian to Leyte just delivered the bomb, the Hiroshima bomb. 1,100 men went into the water. Vessel went down in 12 minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about half an hour. Tiger, 13-footer. You know how you know that when you're in the water, Chief? You tell by looking from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. Because our bomb mission had been so secret no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, sharks come cruising so we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know, kind of like old squares in a battle like you see on a calendar like the Battle of Waterloo. The idea was... the shark comes to the nearest man and he starts pounding, hollering and screaming. Sometimes the shark would go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you, right into your eyes. You know, a thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes. Black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at you, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites you. Those black eyes roll over white and then... Then you hear that terrible high-pitched screaming. The ocean turns red. In spite of the pounding and the hollering, they all come in. They rip you to pieces. You know, by the end of that first dawn... we lost 100 men. I don't know how many sharks. Maybe 1,000. I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday morning, I bumped into a friend of mine... Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland. Baseball player, bosun's mate. I thought he was asleep. Reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up and down in the water just like a kind of top. Upended. He'd been bitten in half, below the waist. Noon the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura saw us. He swung in low and he saw us. He was a young pilot. Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us and he came in low, and three hours later... a big fat PBY comes down and starts to pick us up. That was the time I was most frightened. Waiting for my turn. I'll never put on a life jacket again. So, 1,100 men went into the water 316 men come out. The sharks took the rest, June 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb. What's that? It's a whale. Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain Show me the way to go home I'm tired and I want to go to bed I had a little drink about an hour ago And it's gone right to my head Wherever I may roam By land, or sea or foam You will always hear me singing this song Show me the way to go home Show me the way to go home I'm tired and I want to go to bed I had a little drink about an hour ago And it's gone right to my head Wherever I may roam On land or sea or foam You can always hear me singing... Start the engines. Fire her up! Right in the middle! He's busting the shaft. Put out the fire, will you? - Pump her out. - Done. Everybody on deck. He ate the light. - Terrific. - Excuse me. Quint, what are you doing? Don't waste your time. Quint, come on. What's wrong with this? Hooper, take the wheel. Brody, follow that. Watch for him. You okay? Chief, more left rudder! Pull your left hand down. I can't. It'll only go about three inches. All of our injectors got scored from the salt water in the fuel. Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it. Try the left rudder again. More left. Good. Once again now. Quint, there it is. What do you say, Chief? The barrel is up, it's right in the stern. I think he's right under the keg. Grab the boat hook. Quint, if we can get close enough... I've got things on board that'll kill it. Just want to goose him up. Come on. When he runs, you drop that rope or you'll lose your hands. I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles. Whole sea's bones, full of them. Give it to me a minute. Haul in that line or it'll foul us. Start the engine. Where are you going? I'm going to make a phone call. Hello, mayday, Orca. Coast Guard? Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you read me? Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you... Excuse me, Chief. That's great! That's just great! Now, where the hell are we, eh? You're certifiable, Quint, you know that? You're certifiable! You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this! Boys, I think he's come back for his noon feeding. Hook me up another barrel. Bring her around after him. Full throttle! Get me right up alongside of him! I can't rev it up that high, it's not going to take it! Five degrees port. All right, hold your course. Five degrees port now. Hold your course. Fast fish. Watch my hand. Be sure you watch my hand! Follow me. Lad, you watch him now! Starboard! Run him down, Hooper. Hard aport. Watch him. Starboard. I can't believe it. Two barrels and he's going down again. It's incredible. - They're up again! - Now what? Why don't we lead the shark into shore instead of him leading us out to sea? Grab a couple of poles. Hang on now, we're going around. Into starboard. Easy. I'm going to back her off now. Watch those barrels, boys. Watch them. All right, gentlemen, snag them. Now then, tie them to the stern cleats. Brody, bring your end around the cleat. That's right, it'll lock itself off. Give him room, Brody. Stay clear of the line! Watch it. Stand clear. Stand away from those stern cleats! Back home we got a taxidermy man. He's going to have a heart attack when he sees what I brought him. Throttle back. You're losing a cleat. My God, this one, too. They're both going. He's eating his way through that line. He's working his way right up to us. Quint! Come on, Quint. Hurry! Out of my way. Watch it. Untie this. He'll pull out the transom. Make it fast! We got another line in him! I can't, it's trying to run! We better get another line! Pull, you son of a bitch! I hope your back breaks! Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out. Tie him off! It's impossible! Boys, it's too tight! He's pulling us! We're breaking up over here! We're breaking up! Cut it! Watch your hands! Cut it quick. I can't hold it! He can't stay down with three barrels on him. Not with three barrels, he can't. What about us? Hooper, get the pump out of the locker in front of you, will you? We're going to sink, aren't we? Keep an eye on the barrels. Pump it out, Chief. Starting to go under. He can't with three barrels on him. Not with three he can't. You ever have one do this before? No. He's chasing us. I don't believe it. I'm going to draw him into the shallows. Draw him into the shallow water. I'm going to draw him in and drown him. We're heading in, Brody. Thank Christ! You ever had a great white do that? No. How far do we have to go? Don't put that much pressure on it. God damn it. Shut up. Get back there. Hold on. Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain For we received order for to sail back to Boston You idiot, you burned out the bearings. All right, stop the boat. Stop it. What exactly can you do with these things of yours? I think I can pump 20 cc of strychnine nitrate into him. If I can get close enough. Get this little needle through his skin? No, I can't do that. If I can get him close to the cage, I can get him in the mouth. That shark will rip that cage to pieces. You got any better suggestions? Easy. Up she goes. Ease her up. Ain't got no spit. Try and keep him off me until I'm lower. Okay, I'm ready. Bring him up, God damn it. Bring him up now! Pull it up. Pull it. Pull him up. Come on, Quint, bring him in. It's giving way! Rig something! Got it? It's coming. Slow it down. Slower. All right, come on. Show me the tank. Blow up! Smile, you son of a bitch! Quint? No. Can we get in on those? What day is this? It's Wednesday. It's Tuesday, I think. I think the tide's with us. Keep kicking. I used to hate the water. I can't imagine why., Down! How ya doin'? Hey, watch out, Axel. We'll be calling him old fireballs after tonight. - Fuckin' A. - Not bad. Hey, Stevie, now that you're going to the army, how about giving me my 20 bucks back? - So long, Mike. - Take care, Mike. I'll see you, fellas. - Freddy! - Hi, Mike. Be good. - You hear about the happy Roman? - Yeah. - He was ""glad he ate her"". - Come on. Let's go, let's go. - Where's Stan? - All right? - Hey, Stan! Let's go! - Take care. - Nick! - All right! - Take care of yourself, OK? - Bye-bye. - So long. - Take it easy, Mike. - Don't get your ass shot off, OK? Good luck. - Nah, I won't. Hey!

What does it mean? It means a blessing on the hunter sent by the great wolf to his children. - What the fuck are you talking about? - No, it's an old Indian thing. You're full of shit. Stanley, would I shit you about something like that? You know, Mike, there's times when nobody but a doctor can understand you. And that's an omen, you know that? You know that we could have one great fucking hunting trip tonight? You know, Mike, I don't know where the hell you come up with all this shit. Hey, wait a minute. What, are you...?

I know. - Then why didn't you do it? - Cos I forgot. Oh, man! For Christ's sake, Mike, Steven's getting married in a couple of hours. I don't know what we're doing talking about hunting a last time before the army. The whole thing, it's crazy. I'll tell you one thing. If I found out my life had to end up in the mountains, I'd be all right. But it has to be in your mind. What? One shot? Two is pussy. I don't think about one shot that much anymore, Mike. You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about. A deer has to be taken with one shot. I try to tell people that. They don't listen. - You really think about Vietnam? - Yeah. I don't know. I guess. I'm thinking about the deer. Going to Nam. I like the trees, you know? I like the way the trees are in the mountains, all the different... The way the trees are. I sound like some asshole, right? I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy I go hunting with, you know? I like a guy with quick moves and speed. I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes. - Well, who's an asshole? - Who's an asshole? Who do you think's an asshole? They're all a bunch of assholes. I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys, but, you know, without you, I'd hunt alone. - Seriously, that's what I'd do. - Well, you're a fucking nut. You know what, Mike? You're a maniac. Control freak. I just don't like no surprises. - Damn thing won't open. - Well, give it a kick. Hey, hey, not like that. Not like that. Not... Here, here, here. - See that? - Fuckin' A. Unreal. Axel, now I know why you're not still kicking for the Steelers. You know, I love Mike's car. Yeah, some cars, they just sit. I mean, you never know with a car like this where the hell it's gonna take you. Yeah. It makes me feel safe. Oh, what is he doing? Axel's humping Mike's Coupe de Ville. - Axel, get out of there. - Let's get the carnations. Get up. Get up. What are you doing? Come on. Sit up. Oh, God, you're impossible. - Here, put this on, you have to have that on. - Crummy tuxedo. The tuxedo's been stuck a million times.

Careful, now. - Okay. - Is Mr. Fallon here? - Oh, yes, he's here. Would you take this? I'll check the fuse box. - Yeah, sure, okay. - Careful. Hugh? Hugh? Surprise! Is it 41 or 42? ...right in and chase the shepherds away ...right in and made my sunniest day Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear George Happy birthday to me I go down on my knees to you. How do you feel about 42? - 42 what? - Mm. You know. Years. It depends. How do you feel? - I feel betrayed. - Ohh. Really? Well.... You know... ...they say... ...you know who ""they"" are... ...that life begins at 40. I spent the last... ...2 years... ...realizing they'd been lying in their teeth. I don't know. I think the last 2 years have been rather good. That's because you're 38. - Keep your voice down. - Ohh. - Goodnight, George. - Mm. - Good night, Sam. - Night, Sheila. Night, Sheil. Sam... ...I want you to promise me something. Never! Never throw me a surprise party again. - You're welcome. - Oh, you know what I mean. I'm going to fill out my night. Could I have some more white wine, Bacchus, my dear? How you feeling, birthday boy? Oh. Invalided. You mean invalid? I'm... Well, that, too... ...but I feel basically invalided, like an invalid. Remember what they say, George. After 40, it's all patch, patch, patch. Ugh. I'm going home. - We're working here in the morning. - Oh, goody, goody. - Hey, hi. - Hi. - How you doing? - It's good to see you. - How's the water? - Great. Oh. Thanks, Covington. Thanks. Happily Oh, baby, won't you and me We had it made Here, try this. Put this in front of ""don't call it love."" - Oh, in front. - Right. Try it. If they ask you You can say that We ended happily - And then have... - Right. But don't call it love When you're talking to me Great. If they ask you You can say that We ended happily But don't call it love When you're talking to me - Great. Yeah. - Got it? - I'm going home. - Right. How's Sam? Oh. Sam's great. Sam's mostly always great. Can I have my jacket, please? That sounds mostly intellectual, not emotional. I guess so. I guess she'd be happier if things were more emotional. - I guess so would you. - Ho-ho-ho. For a man who's never been analyzed... I'd analyze you better than that expensive shrink. But you'd come out gay and I couldn't do that to Sam. - Here you go. - Thanks. - I'll give her your love. - No. Give her yours. He's no more than a man Nothing special that you'd run to see He's a child to be sure At times insecure But he pleases me For when I'm in his arms And the last little star slowly dies I'm enchanted to be The me that I see in his eyes He's a man, nothing more Sort of clumsy and absent of mind Not the kind of a beau I dreamed long ago That I would find He's my lover, my friend What more could I ask him to be? So in our little plot The mystery is what he sees in me Why is it I never doubt him When I've known all along Now and then The very best of men must roam Sure, I get lonely without him But a man, right or wrong The more you bind him The less you find him home He's no more than a man Just a weaver of wishes and dreams Very shy, insecure He's a child... Oh, shit! - Hi. - Hi. - Are you hurt? - No. Would you mind stepping out? - Do you have a license? - Yeah. Thank you. Did you know your license had expired? - What? - July 26. Oh, no! Yeah. Uh.... Do you have a registration? - For the car. - Um.... Yeah, sure. Expired license, no registration... ...and reckless driving. I think you'll need a lawyer to help you with this one, Mr. Webber. Yeah. - See if you can get this thing started. - Yeah. Thank you. Go on, move it! Marriage is a sacred commitment... ...designed on earth, sanctified in heaven. Consider these two rings. Perfect circles... ...without beginning, without end... ...signifying God's eternal love and devotion. Where would we be without God's love? One of the most glorious of God's institutions... ...is the institution of marriage. A union of two souls swearing allegiance... ...and promising in God's name to obey one another... ...until death do them part. In today's world... ...it does well to consider such a commitment. For in the final analysis, on the day of reckoning... ...we shall all be held to account. The time has come for David and Jenny... ...to make this commitment to one another. Do you, David, take Jennifer... ...as your lawful wedded wife... ...to have and to hold... ...in sickness and in health... ...from this day forward till death do you part? Ahh! Shit! Hello! Hi. - Whose car? - What? - Whose car? - It's a loaner. - Jesus, George! - Don't look. What have you done to your nose? A bee flew in the car. My God! You're lucky you didn't have a wreck. - I did have a wreck. I hit a police car. - A police car? Yes. And not just a police car. A Beverly Hills police car. - My God. Does it hurt? - You bet your knickers it hurts. Have you taken anything for it? Four of your birth control pills. I hope that's all right. Try an antihistamine. I don't like those. They make me pregnant. I'll start dinner. Thank God for that. Okay, what's up? What do you mean? I've been getting strange vibrations. Probably just a temporary... ...malfunction of my biorhythms, dear. Maybe you are allergic. That bee sting's awfully close to your frontal lobes. Sit down. You'll just screw things up in the kitchen. - Go play the piano. - I want to do my share. - You shall, darling. Later. - Ohh. Yeah! Unbelievable. Un-fucking-believable. - Does that guy have a telescope too? - Yeah. - See anything interesting? - Oh, yeah! Hi, Sam! Shit! She did it again. The latest hike in OPEC oil... That son of a bitch has a bigger telescope than we have. Not ""we"" have, ""you"" have. I don't peep into somebody else's windows to get my jollies. You and your friend are dirty old men. He's not my friend. He should be. You know him intimately now. I don't watch him, I watch his broads. He's got a hell of a stable. He must be good in the sack. What's that got to do with it? Unless he has a new remote control screwing device... ...how can you keep from watching him too? I concentrate on the broads. - He's around, isn't he? - Why are you so heat up? You got the time or you want to wait till after the late show? First, I'm getting a little fed up... ...at sexually emancipated ladies being referred to as ""broads."" Second... ...I think a telescope aimed at anything other than stars... ...is an invasion of privacy and qualifies the voyeur as a peeping Tom. And there's a very good law against that. Third, the first two wouldn't bother me a bit... ...if you'd stop watching so much television... ...and pay attention to your bedroom guests. This guest, in particular. Now, you want to argue or you want to make love? Define ""broad."" - Your definition or mine? - I know yours. A girl who screws around a lot. - A hooker. - A hooker's a hooker. Their spreading their legs doesn't make the terms interchangeable. - What's the difference? - A hooker sells it. So does a broad. A hooker makes the price going in. Ahh. So by definition a broad is less virtuous than a hooker. As far as I'm concerned, virtue has nothing to do with it. As far as you or any man is concerned, virtue has everything to do with it. Listen, I just said ""broad."" You applied a disparaging connotation to the term. Come on. Are you trying to tell me... ...that ""broad"" is not a term used by men... - ...to describe women disparagingly? - I'm just saying I didn't use it that way. - Would you call me a broad? - That depends. On whether you watched me through a telescope... ...while I fooled around with your degenerate neighbor. Okay, you define it. First and foremost, I don't equate the term exclusively with sex... ...voyeurism or, quote, ""degeneracy."" - You do that. - So do you, but you won't admit it. ""Broad"" to me is just another colloquial term for ""woman""! Like ""dame,"" ""skirt""... - ""Moll."" - ""Crumpet."" ""Moll."" I'm sure Dillinger never used that word derogatorily. For authority on female aggrandizement consult the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. Let's look it up. I want your definition, not Webster's. I'm going to get Monsieur Roget's definition. You know my definition. ""Broad"" means woman. Not good, not bad, unless so designated. You said a broad does it for money. You said a hooker sells it. I said so does a broad. If a broad is a woman, then women screw for money? - Some women! - Broads! Some broads do it for other things, but in a way, they sell it! ""Woman - dame, hen, petticoat."" ""Slang or derogatory. Jane, broad."" Look. ""Slang. Derogatory. Broad."" Okay? How about that, smartass? You want to look up ""derogatory?"" George.... Don't be a shitheel. Whatever Monsieur Roget's dfinition was... ...I was not using the term in a derogatory fashion! Some of my oldest and dearest friends are broads! - Including your mother. - You bet! I want a broad... My maternal grandmother was one of the greatest broads that ever lived. They don't make ""broads"" like that anymore. - You know what's wrong with you? - Male chauvinist pig. Besides that. You're gutless. You're afraid to admit you blew it, and lose like a man. I wouldn't mind losing like a man... ...if you weren't so damned determined to win like one! Oh, Christ. I've got an early call. Um.... Care to translate that? Yup. It's getting late. I think I'd better go. From Hollywood, The Tonight Show... ...starring Johnny Carson. This is Ed McMahon, along with Doc Severinsen... ...and the NBC Orchestra, inviting you... ...to join Johnny and his guest Cloris Leachman. From the Metropolitan Opera company, Judith Blegen.... I thought we were going to make love. It'll cost you 50 bucks and an apology. Here's Johnny! Sam! Oh, damn! Oh, bollocks! Ow. God. Oh, God. I give my heart Just to one man Loving... I can't hear you, Fraser. This too I swear While I am there - It's too soon. - Keep going. Didn't we have more tables in San Francisco? More tables, you know. Never mind. I give my heart I know my man Hold it. You must spend more time at the tables. Did we have more tables in San Francisco? We did, but... - Do you mind if I make a phone call? - Go ahead. Give everybody a 10, would you? Okay. Everybody take 10, please. Stage phone, please. Sorry, that line's busy. - Still busy. - I'll hold. Okay, over here! Still busy. Okay, thank you. Does he do anything except swim and jog on the beach? Oh, yes. He makes me happy, so I let him swim and jog on the beach. The more you do for him, the more he rubs your nose in it. Speaking of noses, why don't you keep yours out of my personal affairs? In return, I won't bring up that you've acted like a spoiled child all morning. I'm going to the market. Anybody want anything? No, but bring back the receipts. George thinks you take advantage of me. Is that so? Well, I suppose I do. But then, nobody's perfect. Oh, George is. What a drag. Hugh, sometimes you really are a pain-in-the-ass fag. Coming from one of the great Anglo-Saxon heterosexual... ...bores of all time, that's the ultimate compliment. You've brooded and sulked around my house all morning... ...without the good manners to explain or apologize, and I'm fed up. So you know what I'll do? I'll call it a day. I'll invite some company over to soak up the strain. Some happy, conversational... ...intellectually stimulating, pleasant company. The Malibu chapter of the Sugar Plum Fairies? As you don't qualify, you understand why I don't ask you to stay. I couldn't. I forgot my tutu. Yeah, see you later, Butch. - I won't be long. - Don't be. What does that mean? It means go to the store and come back. Don't hang around with your friends at the beach! Don't get heavy with me. I'll be back when I'm ready. What were your thoughts at the moment of this fixation? That she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Uh, on a scale from 1 to 10? You said there was no such thing as a 10. There's nothing unusual. I was sitting at the stop sign. I wasn't thinking anything special. Suddenly there she was. And I reacted. I mean, I wasn't expecting to see that vision. What about the young girls on the beach? And Larry? I don't like... ...middle age. I mean, it's not that complicated. I'd just rather be 30. Or 20, even. God. If to make it, I had to change places with Larry... ...and a life of faggotry... ...I'd sure as hell give it consideration. You don't consider that significant? I'm just using an extreme example to make a point. If you could, wouldn't you change places with Larry? But I can't! Didn't you ever play games like that? But not to the point where I got all hung up with it. You're becoming obsessed with the ugliness of old age. The fear of death. The inevitability of it. You'd change places with a homosexual to put it off. So what do you do? You play it safe. You get a fixation on a beautiful young girl. A ""vision,"" I think was your description. And I suspect, for your total vision... Yes? Um, excuse me, reverend, I was just driving by your church... ...and, uh, a thought struck me. If it wouldn't be an imposition... ...and you could spare a few minutes, I'd be eternally grateful. By George! Aren't you George...? - Webber. - Of course! George Webber! My goodness! Well, come on in, George! - Thank you. - How wonderful! You know, George, I'm a songwriter too. When you are near Though we're under a cloud Why do I hear Rainbows that shine out loud Why is there music When I'm kissing your glove Could it be That I have an ear for love Why, when you smile Do those bells ding-a-ling Turning my heart Into a thumping thing Glee clubs of moonbeams Sing your name in the blue When I hold you near My love Look into my ear My love You'll see that what I say I hear My love Is true Well? Well... Now, George, you must be absolutely frank with me. Yes. Well, frankly, I.... - I'm stunned. - Do you think it's professional? I think it's amazing. You realize, I've loved music all my life. Excuse us, Mrs. Kissel. Loved it all my life. Of course, I made a choice. I'm not dissatisfied. I took the right road. - I think you did. - But the music, you know. - Always there, right? - Oh, yes, yes. Sometimes, though, it gets to be almost too much. I feel like chucking everything, and just write, write. Yes. Well, I think you should stick with it, reverend. You really did like it. No. He that hath clean hands and a pure heart... ...who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity.... Yes, yes. Quite. All right, Mrs. Kissel, we'll take care of it. - She's been with me for ages. - Yes. It's all right. You go on back to the kitchen now. No damage done. How old is she? I honestly don't know. I don't think she does. Whenever Mrs. Kissel breaks wind, we beat the dog. I mean, the whole depersonalized lifestyle that puts down anything traditional... ...and completely ignores many of our... ...socially most fundamental institutions. Such as marriage, for instance. Right on, George. Heh-heh-heh. I think I'm fairly well psychologically oriented. I've talked to psychologists, psychiatrists... ...welfare workers.... But when I drove by your church today, I thought, ""God!"" Goodness... ...who better than somebody who truly represents... ""...the institution of marriage and all it stands for?"" I'd be more than happy to help. That's really marvelous. Well, for instance, compared to, say, 5 or 10... You may not believe it... ...but just as many young people are marrying today... - ...as they were 10 years ago. - Really? Of course, there's a difference. It fits right in with this depersonalized concept. So many don't seem able to relate to the true meaning of the ceremony. Mm. Can you be more specific? Have you married any young people lately? Yesterday I married Jennifer Miles and David Hanley. Perhaps you might know the bride's father, Dr. Miles. He's a very prominent Beverly Hills dentist. No. No. - Theater. - Stage phone, please. All I possess is Get the phone Hello? - Samantha Taylor, please. - She's busy. God, she's always busy. My name is George Webber. I'm trying to get a message to her. Can I do that? - For Samantha Taylor? Who's calling? - Right. George Webber. - Webber. - Could you spell that? W-E-B-B-E-R. - Got it. - Hello? Hello? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. If you could just tell her... Hello? Oh, dammit! Oh, God! You have all the... Ohh! Ahh! Shit! God! Dammit. Ow! Hey, I see him! What's he doing? Come on, George! - Oh! - Hello? Hello! I didn't want to bother you but I'm leaving town tomorrow. How long since you've had your teeth checked? God, I don't know. Uh.... My dentist is Dr. Shoup in New York. Do you know him? - No. Don't believe I do. - Oh. Open, please. - Ahh! - Shh. How long since you've seen Dr. Shoup? Couple of years. - You've got six cavities. - Tsk, tsk, tsk. - Two of them are pretty bad. - Really. - Six cavities? - This is the worst. See this shadow? That's the nerve. Lucky if we can save this tooth. Oh. What? - Who are my next appointments? - Mrs. Phillips and Mr. Rodinsky. Now open as wide as you can, please. Wide. Wide. See if you can cancel them. And tell Janie that we may have to work through the lunch hour. You have to do them all now? Couldn't we just do the bad ones? Well, they're all bad. Two of them really serious. But they're all bad. Look, I can cancel my vacation for a few days... I'm afraid that wouldn't help very much. In an emergency, I can shift things around a bit. But otherwise I'm booked solid for the next month. No, I think under the circumstances... ...better we just get it over with. It won't be so bad. Then you can take your vacation, and as far as your teeth are concerned... ...you can relax and enjoy yourself. - Beginning to feel the Novocaine? - Yeah. My lips are tingling. I enjoy your music. The last time I was in New York, Mrs. Miles and I saw, uh... ...Dream Boat! That was your show, wasn't it? - Uh. - Ha-ha-ha! It was '67. '68. That was a hell of a good show. - That hurt? - Not really. Where are you going on your vacation? The Virgin Islands. Mrs. Miles and I always go to Mexico. - Oh. - Las Hadas. Lava tus dientes. That's Spanish for ""brush your teeth."" It's really terrific. My daughter Jenny's there now on her honeymoon. - How are you? - Not very well. Pardon? - This'll take a few minutes. - Okay. - Sir? - Forget it. Sure. Hi, Mr. Webber. Huh? Cup of coffee. Black coffee. - Oh, coffee. - Coffee. That's all right. Thank you. Oh, Christ. Hello? - Hello? - Who is this? Is this 275-0817? Yeah, yeah, it's George. Ohh! Hello? Operator. Operator, I'm having trouble reaching 275-0817. Could you try it, please? Ohh. Hello? Hello? - Operator. - Would you get me the police? - Josh? - Yeah? - I'm going out. I'll be back. - Okay. - Do your homework. - I've already done it! Oh, what? What is this? What's wrong? What's wrong? - Pardon? - What's wrong? What are you doing here? We got a call from a Miss Taylor. She spoke to this house. A strange man answered. He spoke gibberish, made obscene sounds. She was afraid Mr. Webber, the tenant... - That's me! - ...met with foul play. The prescription's for G. Webber. Do you know Mr. Webber? He wants to write something. ""My name is George Webber."" I just came from the dentist where I had 6 cavities filled. ""I have identification in the house."" Six? You better take it easy. Pain pills and alcohol don't mix. You could've fooled me. Oh, George! With the... Come in. Step right in. George? George? You go for it, George! - Are you going for it? - I'm going for it. Oh, God! Anything. I want to say something. - I have a telescope. - You do? I look at him every day and he looks at me. I don't think I've been so happy for years. Come have a walk with me. You miserable little son of a bitch! - Yup? - Sam? Yep! Oh! Oh, fuck! Uh. Hello? Aeromexico. Oh! Damn you, George! Ow! - George Webber. - Would you please sign in? Mr. Webber? Buenos Dias. I'm Vicente, the assistant manager. Welcome to Las Hadas. Oh. Is that for me? It's a custom here at Las Hadas. It'll keep you cool. - Can I drink on the way to the room? - Of course. We've got a very beautiful place here. Look out! I hope the maid has made up the room. Good, she did. Mr. Webber? - Mr. Webber. - Huh? Right this way. Mr. Webber, right this way. - You must have had a rough flight. - Huh? - I said you must have had a rough flight. - Nyeh. These rooms are well-insulated. You'll have peace and quiet. And also, as I said... ...the view from the balcony is magnificent. Mr. Webber? Mr. Webber? - Hugh? - Hm? What is it about that miserable little son of a bitch that makes me care? - Well... - I don't want to, you know. He's more trouble than any man I've ever known, including my ex-husband. Apart from being uncommonly bright, wonderfully witty... ...generous, occasionally lovable and a genius... ...I can't think of a single thing. - How about unnaturally belligerent? - Oh, yes. - Exhaustingly childish? - Uh-huh. Yeah. We've nothing in common. We're the original odd couple. And when he really gets me going... ...I can't ask him to step outside because he's too small. I hope he's gone for good. Well, he hasn't. - He's going through male menopause. - Come on. All right. Ladies have a biological edge... ...but most males over 40 make up for it in the emotional department. He's gone. I don't know where he is. Nothing has happened to him. Nothing sinister, that is. It'll take him a while to find out he's a certified imbecile. He'll come home, tail between his legs and settle down for good. Lest ye judge harshly, remember.... - Nobody's perfect. - Thank God. Anyway, I'd still like to punch him right in the mouth. Buenos Dias. A very good evening to you. Oh. I'd like strong black coffee and some amphetamines. Might I suggest the dining room? And the local pusher. In whatever order you consider appropriate. Yes, yes. I'll settle for a brandy. - Thanks. - Certainly. Cheers. I think, one more time, basically. If you still want coffee... I've survived the crisis, thank you. - Is there a phone I can use? - Sure. - Dial ""9."" - Mm. Thank you. - Operator. - Mm. Hello, this is Mr. George Webber. I'm in room.... I don't know what room I'm in. Do you know? - Yes. 104. - Thank God. Thank you. Could you do me a favor and get me... ...area code 213... Miss Samantha Taylor. - Miss Samantha Taylor? - Right. Thank you. By what name are you known, sir? I'm known by the name of ""Donald."" ""Don,"" to my friends and paying customers. In that case... ...another double, Don. ""Double Don."" That'll be hard to say... ...by the shank of the evening. Better make that a single. Hello? Yes. - Sam! - George? Yes. Listen, you'll never guess in a million years. I'm in Mexico. And I'm sitting in... ...the Las Hadas bar... ...having a brandy with my old friend, Don. - Say hello to Sam, Don. - Hello, Sam. Listen, I tried to call you a dozen times. When do you plan on coming back? Hello? George? Darling... ...I won't stay... ...a minute longer than I have to. Just a couple of days... ...a couple of weeks. I should have it all sorted out. I love you too much... ...to put you through all that rubbish. I need... Ahem. I need the time to be alone. Okay? Sam? Sam? - Mm-hm? - Say something. Piss off, George! They don't write music like that anymore. Well, not much anymore, anyway. Is that good or bad? What do you think? I'm opposed to bartenders making value judgments while on duty. - For that matter, so is the management. - Oh, poo-poo. How old are you? Thirty-seven. But I look 40. No. You look 33. That's because I'm really 25. We are each of us the product of an era. That music is my era. Beautiful melody. Great lyric. If you were 19... ...and 20 years from now... ...you were dancing with your wife... ...or girlfriend you knew in high school... ...and you said to her, ""Darling..."" ...they're playing our song""... ...do you know what they'd be playing? ""Why Don't We Do It In the Road?"" What the fucking hell kind of era is that? - To each his own. - Ah. Now that's a good song. What... What is the sum total of my indebtedness... ...to this establishment? Name and room number. Uh.... I have left something for your favorite charity. - That's me. - Why not? - Good night, Don. - Good night. Mr. Webber.... And for what it's worth... ...I like your songs. God. Well.... You know something? You suddenly don't look a day over 30. Oh, oh. Oh, Sam. Come and save me, for chrissake. - Hello? - Josh. - Yeah. - Hi, it's George. - How are you? - Okay. Let me speak to your mother. She doesn't want to talk to you. What do you mean? Young man, go and tell her I'm on the phone, right now! Piss off, George! I couldn't sleep. - It's the brandy. - Yeah. - Let's get back to the doubles. - How will that help you sleep? I said I couldn't. I didn't say I wanted to. Live and learn, like I always say. Oh, God. What else do you always say? I always say... ...down the hatch. Ho, ho. Oh. Up the rebels. Hello. Hello. I don't mean to be rude, but aren't you George Webber? Yes, I am, and I don't think you're being the teeniest bit rude. Terrific. I met you at Truman Capote's party. - Terrific. - My name is Mary Lewis. - Congratulations, Mary Lewis. - Thank you. Thank you. Enid. Enid, darling. Have you met my wife? I'm so pissed. - She's lost her shape. - She's going to enjoy this. Nice room you have. Pretty. - Oh! - Oh, God! I'm sorry. Let me make it well. I don't want you to be afraid. George. Hmm? Is it me? No. Yes, it is. Okay. - Is it? - No. It is me, isn't it? No. This ever happen to you before? Well, it's happened to me before. Ta-da. Heh-heh-heh. There was this... ...beautiful guy. Willis. - Willis... - Ackerman. Willis Ackerman. We slept together, by actual count, 16 times. No matter what we did or how, he just couldn't manage. That's terrible. One time he got so crazy, he just started punching the wall. Hit it as hard as he could. Broke the old hand in three places. He swore he loved me. He'd sit on that bed in the dark and he would cry like a baby. It never happened to him before, he said. We stopped seeing each other finally. You know, he's got three kids now. He's married and he's got 3 kids in 4 years. I think he's... ...worked his problem out. Yeah, well, I was his problem and he sure worked me right out. So don't go punching any walls, Georgie, huh? Some of us... ...just don't bring out the man in men. Good night, sweet Georgie. The sand is hot! Oh! Ah! Hot! Oh, God. The sand is hot. God, bloody hell. - Oh! Ha, ha. - Sorry. Ah! Ahh. Oh, God. God. Hello. Drink, sir? Can I get you anything to drink? Something cool, refreshing? Can I soak my feet in it? How about a Bloody Mary? You can stand in the ocean while drinking it. God, yeah. That may be the suggestion of the week. - Thank you. - Okay. Oh, God. Think I'll go out and get a surfboard. Ow, ow! Damn! Damn! Ah, fuck it! - Here you go, sir. - Oh, shit! Here's your Bloody Mary. - Would you like to drink it in the ocean? - No, no. - It's really warm in the ocean. - No, no. - I'll take you on my back. Come on. - No. - Okay here, sir? - Yeah. - Cheers! - Thank you. Enjoy yourself. - He is a very enterprising young man. - Mm. Yes, yes. I must admit I feel a bit foolish. - Good morning. - Good morning. I didn't get your name. Webber. George. - Collins. Bill. - Hi. How are you? - Switzer. Chuck. - Hi. Chuck refuses to be carried. He used to be a Marine. Oh, well. To Tripoli. Semper fi. I was in the Royal Air Force, as a matter of fact. I thought you had to be English to be in that. You do. - You an English fellow, huh? - Mm-hm. That's all right. Sir. Can I get you anything else? Yeah. Terrific. How about a beer? Uh. No, actually. Thanks. I think I might go for a swim. - If you need anything... - I'll give you a shout. - Surfboard? - It's great. Can I get you one? I've never really used one. There's nothing to it. No big waves. Just paddle around. Sure it's not dangerous? Absolutely. The hotel's had only one accident since opening. - That was because the dummy fell asleep. - Fell asleep? Yeah. He fell asleep on the board... ...drifted out to sea and the currents got him. The currents? Past the point, there's heavy currents. 6 or 7 knots. If you're on a surfboard or swimming, that's it. You could end up in Peru. - You mean he... - Never found him. But you don't fall asleep on a surfboard. And you don't paddle out too far. - Well, maybe tomorrow. - What about sailing? - Great sport. - Maybe. I'll see you later. Adios. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on! Oh! Against odds and without thought for his own safety... ...George Webber, composer, playwright... ...and winner of four Academy Awards... ...braved treacherous waters to save a drowning man. David Hanley, 23, and his bride, Jennifer... ...are honeymooning at the Las Hadas Hotel in Mexico. David fell asleep on his surfboard and drifted out to sea. I've got to call Sam! ...told me how dangerous it is in the currents. I was out in the boat... ...and I decided... ...there wasn't time to go for help, so I went after him. Hello? Hello? - George Webber, please. - One moment please. - To your very good health. - Thank you, Don. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Lounge. - Mr. Webber, please. Wait one moment. - Are you in? - No, no. Listen, Kitty, until otherwise instructed... ...Mr. Webber'll be incommunicado. Oh, my God! Where's that? About 20 miles east, and make a left turn. Okay. Thank you, Don. Clever girl. She wanted to know where ""communicado"" was. Oh, it's very obvious. It's a stone's throw from ""cognito."" Sorry. Sorry. This is the new one, Hugh. That's beautiful. More, Georgie. Play ""Funny Valentine."" You don't remember? I played that for you already. You did? At Truman Capote's party. Gosh, I don't remember. Are you sure? I play it at every party. Keep a light in the window. I may be back. - Right, mate. - Oh, yes. - Who is it? - Uh, George Webber. Sorry, I didn't realize you were in the shower. Oh, no, no. Come in. I tried to call, but you weren't in. I'll just slip into a robe. Come in. There's a bar if you want a drink. There's a joint in the ashtray. I didn't get home from the hospital until 8:00. How is your husband? He's got a terrible sunburn. He'll lie on his stomach for days. It could have been much worse. - Wouldn't you like a drink? - No, thanks. - Some grass? - No, no, no. - Would you like to sit down? - Yes. You know my father. - Yes. - He says you're his patient. - Dr. Miles, D.D.S. - That's right. Well, isn't that wild? Yeah. You wouldn't believe this. About two weeks ago, David and I saw you on Dinah Shore. Oh, right. To be honest, I didn't know who you were or what you did. But I said to David, ""There's a really attractive older man."" Oh. Well, that's nice. And you've written all those songs. - A few. - Elevator music. God! Elevator music. The music in elevators. Lots of violins. I know what you mean. I'm very big in elevators. - And here you are. - Yeah. You saved my husband's life. It's unbelievable, isn't it? Yeah, I suppose it is. Did you know we were on our honeymoon? - No. - We were married Friday. Oh. - Not much of a honeymoon. - It doesn't matter. We lived together two years. We only did it for the family. My father's just right of Attila the Hun. - May I ask you something, Mr. Webber? - If you call me George. I haven't eaten all day. Well, in that case let me take you out to dinner. That's what I was going to ask you, George. Pretty song. ""Esta noche, la Paso contigo."" What does that mean? Tonight I spend with you. Tell me something, sweet Donald. What's fair about a man... ...getting older... ...and looking more distinguished and worldly... ...and a woman getting older and looking old? There's nothing fair about that. Yeah. No, I'm... ...just fine. I wasn't expecting Prokofiev. I saw Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Opera House... ...when I was 16, with Nureyev and Fonteyn. It really wiped me out. I like different music for different things. I like to listen to rock. I like to dance to jazz. What do you do to Prokofiev? Fuck. And not only Prokofiev. Ravel. Did you ever do it to Ravel's ""Bolero""? No. My uncle turned me on to it. My stepmother's younger brother. I spent weekends at his house. I was at school in England. Uncle Fred said ""Bolero"" was the most descriptive sex music ever written. And he proved it. George? I forgot the joint. What, now? Oh, God, you beautiful thing! Better hurry or you'll have to start it again. The music. You'll have to start it again. - Start it again! - What? It's better if you start right at the beginning. Please? Hurry! Oh, shit. It's all right. It's a long piece. Oh, God. Oh, Jenny. You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Ah, ah, ah! Ow, my hair! Oh, I'm sorry. - What? - It's better if I'm on top. Oh, okay. - What? - A feather! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - Maybe it's better if we go the other way. - Okay. - Now what? - It's stuck! It's not. Really, don't be afraid. The record is stuck! The record! Oh, Christ. Fix it, please! Finally. - Oh, Jesus! - I don't believe it! Hello? Oh, hi, baby. How do you feel? It's David. George Webber. We went out to dinner. George Webber, the man who saved... Right, right. Hold on. He wants to talk to you. He wants to thank you. Hi, David. Yeah. Oh, no big deal. No, it's my pleasure. Yeah, she's... We had a nice dinner. And we were just sitting around talking. I was just getting ready to leave. Sure will. Okay, nice talking to you. Hi. You sound like you're really out of it. Beautiful. I envy you. You'd better get some sleep. I'll be there about 11:00. Okay. All right. Bye. They just gave him a shot of Demerol. He's really out of it. Oh, God. Oh, fuck! Ow. Hold it. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. Why me? What do you mean? Tonight! Me. This. Why not? Are you bothered because my old man called? God, aren't you? No. And what about this? - I don't understand. - Oh, come on. This! Us! What about it? Why the hell get married? I got married because I wanted to. A week later you have an affair with the man who saved your husband's life! - Oh, wow! - Oh, Jenny. ""Oh, wow""? I don't understand that thinking. Well, evidently not. Five minutes ago you weren't worried about him. - Oh, boy. - Or whether I was married. The hell I wasn't! How do you act when you're not worried? I thought maybe you thought I was more than just a casual lay. Why'd you think that? Oh, great. Thank you. Terrific. Because I thought you were something different. Something special! I am. As far as I'm concerned, I'm very special. If I sleep with someone, it's because I want to. - Mm-hm. - I enjoy it. It pleases me. Jolly good! It's okay if your husband does it? If it makes him happy. Nothing wrong with being happy... ...but there's more to life than screwing to Ravel's ""Bolero."" Sure there is. But what's wrong with screwing to Ravel's ""Bolero""? It depends why you're doing it and with whom you're doing it... ...with. If I thought that much, I'd be a virgin! Oh, look, Jenny! George, are you happy? Let me see.... Um.... No. Not at this minute. Neither am I. But I was, and I intend to be again soon. I don't know your problem but you won't solve it by solving mine. - Fine. - And I don't think I really have a problem. Mm-hm. That's your problem. - George? - Hmm? Would you turn off the record? I give my heart Just to one man I give my heart To one man Alone - They loved it. - At $8.50 a crack, I'm lucky. - What's up? - George fucking Webber! Hello, Mr. Webber. Come in. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Is she expecting you? - No. - I'd better let her know you're here. - Okay. Mrs. Taylor? - Yes? - Mr. Webber's here. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. Your phone's out of order. No, it's not. It's been busy all day. It's Josh talking to his dad. I.... I got back this afternoon. I thought I'd surprise you. You did. Uh.... Maybe you'd like to go have dinner? - No, thanks. - Okay. I'm having dinner with Bernie Kaufman. - How come? - Because he asked me. Mom? Dad wants to talk to you. He wants me to come to Southampton for Easter. - Oh, hi, George. - Hi, Josh. You mad at me? Yeah. Mom says I should apologize. I think you should apologize because you want to... ...not because of your mother. - What if I don't want to? - Uh.... Then don't. - Okay, I won't. - Why the hell not? - Hi. - Hi. I'm Bernie Kaufman. Your mom expects me. She's on the phone. I'll apologize to you if you apologize to Mom. - Why should I do that? - Because you've been a real shit! - You little.... - I'll tell her you're here. - Bernie Kaufman. - Hi. George Webber. Okay, I'll see you later. - You two know each other? - I think we just met. - Hi, Bernie. - Hi - You know where the Scotch is. - No, I don't. Make yourself at home. - Nice meeting you. - Yeah. Yes? - What did you do, work all night? - I did. Was it worth it? As a matter of fact, it was. One of your better lyrics. I was inspired by one of your better melodies. Hmm. You don't sound happy. I've always gone on the premise that... ...to be happy, you have to feel happy. How's Larry? He's traveling abroad. I got a telegram saying he might come back. But due to some... ...foolish pride, I don't think I'll take him back. Have you seen Sam? She's going out to dinner with Bernie Kaufman. Don't do as I do. Do as I say. Kill if you must, but don't lose her. - I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. It's easy to say It's over It's easy To say We're the best of friends You walk away and for a while You try the summer Of a younger smile But the memory never ends You could lose your mind But then you'll find It's easy to say I love you There's only one way to say I love you You could search the years away That old clich Is the first of May Too old... ...for new love It's easy to say It's easy As A, B, C I love you Love you Love you That is pretty. Yeah. Thank you. I was going to call it, ""I Love You, Samantha""... ...but some old hack got there before me. It's the thought that counts. Yeah. Uh.... - Sam? - Hm? Do you want to get married? No. Oh, um.... Why not? Just as a matter of interest. We spend too much time arguing and not enough making love. I could work on that. You know, just reverse that trend. Make a lot of love, and just that much arguing. - As easy as that? - You've got it. It would make a difference. So you'll think about it? - Unless you want to argue. - Oh, no. I want to make a cup of coffee. And think about it. - Any action? - Ehh. She's in the kitchen. He's playing the piano. And I've had it! That's it, George! For one year I've been providing X-rated entertainment... ...and you reciprocate with PG! It's an iniquitous arrangement! - What's iniquitous? - I show him mine, he don't show his! Come on, Rapunzel. From now on, we do it in the dark! .srt Extracted From, Synced and Corrected by Dan4Jem, AD.I.MMXVIII, Son of a bitch. Anyway, the cop is sitting there, sipping his coffee, you see? And he's scratching his head. He's completely confused by now. - He says to the drunk... - How's it going, Philo? ...""What about the guy in bed with your wife?"" And the drunk says, ""The hell with him. Let him make his own coffee."" You get it? ""Let him make his own coffee."" Excuse me. That's funny, but don't give up your day job. Come on, Big Al. Let's have some fun. You want to go some place? - Hey, Big Al. Are you married? - I used to be. I know this place in the valley. We could go get a couple drinks. Lots of action there. Great fun. What do you say? Hey. Put them back. - You talking to me? - This ain't the Salvation Army. Put them back. I got plenty of peanuts, Big Al. - You mean these? - Yeah, asshole. - Unless you're taking them to your tree. - Shit. Excuse me, gents. The squirrel is taking his peanuts up to his tree. The squirrel is ripping off peanuts, ain't you, squirrel? Going to take them up to your tree? All right. - Come on, guys. Knock it off. - Get him! Attaboy! - Come on, get out of here, you guys. - Get him. Outside. Come on, guys. Outside! Hey, Orville, what's doing? Ma's going to try it again. I should have remembered my wig. You think it'll make any difference? I don't know, Ma. I don't expect that's all they're going to be looking at. Don't be in such a fired, big hurry. I want to look at these pictures one time more. I always did have trouble with these squiggly lines. I hope you pass it this time, Ma, because there ain't too many more... ...of these places we can go to. They all know you. They don't know how I drive. Don't none of them know how good I drive. Been driving since before them sons of bitches were born. Come on, get out. Here. You're getting pretty tricky, Clyde. You've done real good, Ma. Meathead. Waited till I passed the whole test before he tells me I'm too old. I should have remembered my wig. The hell with everybody. Come on, get going, for God's sake. - Philo, are you out here? - No, I ain't. What are you doing? Are you working on the car? Orville, that's two dumb questions in a row you've asked me. Here. Help me put that block under the car here. - This one here? - Yeah. You want it under the wheel or under the spring? Under the spring. There you go. - Thanks. - Sure. Ma's pissed. It's Clyde. He got out this morning, came over, and shit all over everything. How did she get him back? That's what she's pissed about. She had to bribe him with all her Oreos. Well, I'll make it up to her. - You got one going tomorrow? - Yeah, you coming? Sure am. Who wants some action around here? - There you go, my man. What's the name? - Name? - John Hatfield. I got you, my man. Thank you. Who else? How much you want? Quick, talk to me, my man. - Give me $80. - $80. Let me see that. - Name? - Jackson. All right, listen, I've got $100. Who wants to make a side-bet, here? Come on, guys. Talk up! He may be good, but he ain't no Tank Murdock. Take it. - We won't have anything... - Take it. You're on. - Who's gonna hold this? - You hold it. No problem, you're fine. Church, let's go, man. You got him. - Come up here, Clyde. There you go. - Put this bum away! Don't waste any time on the guy, just put him away. Put him away now, Church! Put him away. Thank you. $5, $100 and $200... ...$500, $600, $900... Clyde could have beat him. I kind of like this. That one's a redhead. - I'll take the one on the left. - All right. The one stuffing her face with chowder. Let's go over there and see what she's drinking. Hi. My name's Philo. Do you mind if I sit here for a while? Suit yourself. I don't recall seeing you around here. I've never been here before. Where do you go when you're not here? My name is Carol. I go to USC. I major in sociology. I'm here because I'm doing a paper on the country-western mentality. Well, that just blew five minutes of our conversation. Well, you asked if you could sit. You didn't say nothing about talking. Who are you mad at? - I don't suppose you have a light, do you? - No, I don't smoke. Excuse me. Orville. Tell me, just what is the country-western mentality? Well, if the lyrics of this song are any indication... ...it's somewhere between moron and dull-normal. Oh, my... Jesus Christ. You are disgusting. Let's leave. Go. What happened? This wild clam got out of control. Take it. Did you see her face? You could've put a turd in there and she couldn't gotten a better look on her. Thank you so much. Now, would you all put your hands together and keep the applause going? Let's all give a big, big Palomino welcome... ... to pretty Miss Lynn Halsey... ... Taylor. Thank you. Okay. Ready, boys? Let's get out of here. I want to watch this chick for a minute. That's awful nice. Lynn Halsey... ... Taylor. You can come back anytime, honey. Excuse me. Could I put this back there for a while? - Sure can. - Thank you. - You sure sing pretty. - Well, thank you. I'd really be pleased if I could buy you a drink. Sure. - I'd like a beer. - Two of those. I didn't get your name in the introduction. My name's Philo Beddoe. Lynn Halsey-Taylor. Did you have a fight with your girlfriend? - She sure ran out pretty fast. - Oh, her. I hardly knew her a minute. A minute? Well, you must go through a lot of women like that. - That was a nice song. Did you write that? - No. Wish I did. Just a song my daddy used to sing to me when I was little. When you were little? That's where I know you from. When I was in third grade I knew a girl that looked enough like you... ...it makes my memory water. You sure do talk funny. Kind of smoky in here. - Would you like to... - I'd love to. Say, it's kind of smoky in here. So, I decided there was nothing I liked doing better than singing. - So, here I am. - Am I glad. Row 3. That's my lucky number. I'll tell you what: You're my lucky number. Would you like to... ...have me in for a while, maybe? I'd love to. - Only... - Only? - Only my boyfriend, Schyler, is sleeping. - Boyfriend? - He wouldn't mind. - He wouldn't? So long as you don't drive his car. Well, I think maybe we could make it some other time when he ain't around. Okay. Whatever you say. Slightly advanced. Look, man, it's an ape! Yeah. Which one's the ape? - What did you say? - That looks your girlfriend. Hey, buddy. Are you taking your mother for a ride? - Take that up there, baby. - Hey. - So long, apeshit. - Son of a bitch. What the hell's this? We'll get them, right, boy? Clyde, get your hands off the wheel. - Let's get the hell out of here. He's crazy. - Follow me. - Hey, why did you come in here? - He'll never find us in here. Get those things out of here. Roll up your window. Shit! Get them out of here. Freaks! Hey, man, what in the hell is going on? - Do you think we ought to stop and fight? - Nope. Let's catch that train. Take it easy. It's a monkey. Crazy monkey! Are you okay? Thanks, Clyde. If you don't like him, how come you stay with him? Because he promised to help me get the $7,000. ""Best I can"" - For what? - ""It's hard for me to say no ""to a truck drivin' man"" For the down payment. - What do you want to buy? - ""Cadillac that I still don't have the time ""Keep the fool who wants to marry me dangling on my line"" My own club back home in Denver. I'm going to call it the Lynn Halsey-Taylor Drinking Fountain. ""Hard for me to say no to a truck driving man"" That will be the name of my group, too. I'll have talent night three nights a week. How much of the $7,000 do you have already? He won't tell me. Well, about the only thing of any value I've got is Clyde. - Clyde? - Yeah, he's my ape. - I won him in a fight. - You won him? Yeah. They brought him over here to make a baby. - You mean he's from Africa? - No, he's from Sumatra. When he got here, the other male orang they had on hand had already done the job. You're kidding? Yeah, so Clyde got real mean as hell, so they sold him to a desert zoo. - Desert zoo? - One of those places out in the desert... ...says, ""Real, live dragon, cactus candy, five miles ahead,"" that sort of thing. That's where I won him. I bet my truck and two dirt bikes on him. - You must have wanted him a lot. - I really hated to see him in that cage. - So, who'd you fight for him? - These four guys. Four guys? You would have thought after the first couple lost they'd have given up. - Well, I fought all four at once. - All four at once? - You like to fight? - I used to. Better than anything. Well, almost anything. So, why didn't you turn professional? None of that stuff. There's too many rules. You're just a regular Tank Murdock. - You know him? - I know of him. He's from Denver and he's a regular institution. You bet he is. Now that is one guy I'd like to meet up with. Well, I'd really like to meet Clyde. And you will. You will. Right now we'll meet my friend, Orville. He's waiting on us. So, Tank was in the back seat of this car with this debutante. I mean, her daddy owned the whole town. - And his buddy was in the trunk. - And then what happened? Well, you see, she was so pure... ...that nobody believed these wild stories that Tank had been telling about her. - What happened? - You got to use your imagination, Orville. Anyway, after... ...she heard all this bumping around and laughing coming from the trunk. And she started to scream. So, all these cops came in, six or eight of them. Tank tried to explain, but nobody believed him because they all knew him. He must have put four cops in the hospital. It took about 12 of them to take him in. Man. - One thing I want to know about the story. - What? Who let that poor guy out of the trunk? Shit, he's probably still there. Those two creeps over there asked me to bring this to the lady. This was mighty nice of you. - Do you see that? - An arm? No, that. A tattoo? They don't know what this means. Do you see that? - Sorry. - Two tattoos. Them's black widows. Did you know that more people die from black widows than rattlers each year? - Is that right? - Yeah, that's right. Well, listen, I sure do appreciate knowing that because... ...most of the people I know just step on them and squish them. I don't need this cheap shit. Orville, that's no way to thank two guys that just bought us a beer. Why don't you get the check and I'll go outside and thank them properly? Okay. - Go ahead. - You started it. Shouldn't you go with him? Sure is good pecan pie. I think we'd better get out of here. Cut it out, Clyde. Ma, what'd you do that for? Been trying to get your attention for five minutes. Did you see Orville? - Yeah. I saw him. - Well? Orville tell you what? Yeah, and I'm sorry, Ma, about you missing your driver's test again. That ain't the one what I mean. You mean Clyde? I'm sorry about that too, Ma. He won't do it again, I promise. - What are you gonna do about it? - What? The crap or the Oreos? About Clyde! Goddamn it! I don't have no privacy in my own home no more. Well, I confronted him about it, Ma. I guarantee it won't happen again. No privacy in your own home. A whole goddamn bag of Oreos. Stop that, you goddamn baboon. No respect. No privacy. No nothing. Bang. - You're late, pretty boy. - Shut up. I don't believe this. Damn. I never knew nobody who could hit so hard or so fast. - He could've been Denver Tank Murdock. - That's right. - Sound like him? - Don't know. Didn't get to see him so close as Elmo. At least I didn't drop my bike and run. Like you two! You big suckers! Shut up! Now, it isn't bad enough... ...that you let somebody else kick your butts... ...without you trying to do it to each other. If we're all talking about the same man... ...and I think we are... ...then it appears he's got a rather growing collection of our bikes. Yeah, but we don't know for sure if he took them or not. - We were... - Unconscious for two hours! - Sick son of a bitch. - It's not true! Shut up! The very first thing we do... ...is find out who we're talking about. I mean, we don't even know where to find him. How are we going to find him? Well, it appears to me that there can't be too many guys... ...driving around this valley with an ape. - What you got sticking out here? - Open it. - It sure feels heavy. - Open it. - Philo. God, where'd you get this? - Off a couple little old widows. - You're kidding. - Yeah. More people are dying to buy widow bikes than are dying by rattler bites every year. Well. - You like it? - Well, yeah. That I do. Wait until Clyde sees you in this outfit. - What's the matter? - I'm okay. - House not too good tonight? - I'm okay, Philo. Well, at least this outfit you bought me was a big hit. I don't like the way this guy's driving. Get down! Is that somebody you know? Schyler. - I thought you said he didn't care. - He must have changed his mind. Philo, I'm scared. - I won't let anything happen to you. - That's not what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid for Schyler. Please don't hurt him. He tried to shoot me and didn't care that you were next to me. That's just it. He was just trying to scare you. He doesn't even know how to shoot. I sure don't like the way he's trying to find out. Philo, I know him. He's probably in there now... ...hiding, scared out of his wits. I don't like to see you cry. Let me talk to him. Please. I don't know. Please. For me. Please. All right. You talk to him. And you tell him that I want you to come with me... ...and I want you to stay with me, you hear? Philo. Here. I want you to dry those tears. - I want you to take this. It's the dough. - I couldn't take that. Yes, you can. I want you to have it now, you hear? - Okay. - I don't want you to cry no more. Clyde, how'd you get out? What, did you pull the lock off? How'd you get out? No, you don't. Come on. No, you don't. Give me that! Give me it! What? Good Clyde. Just hold that truck up, Clyde. What are you doing, Clyde? - Philo. - Yeah. Call this son of a... No, don't call him. Don't call him. Good Clyde. That's it, Clyde. Hold it up. How many times have I told you? I don't want him drinking beer, except on Saturday night. - Don't expect I'll need these no more. - Take it easy, Ma. This is the easy part. Awful glad there ain't no more of them squiggly pictures. Good. Maybe you'll do it this time. Maybe. Well, I guess I will. Why didn't you tell him you wear glasses? It's none of his goddamn business what I wear. Just wear them to read, anyway. Was there anything else? Told me I was too old. Meathead! Orville. Yes, Mother? - Next time I'll wear my glasses. - Good. Goddamn it. God, you're a handsome devil. Clyde, you're going to meet a lady now. I want you to handle it. That means no spitting, pissing, farting or picking your ass. You hear me? Because if you do, I'll throttle you. Understand? Man, I'll tell you something. Clyde, this has got to stop. People are going to talk, you know? - What is it? - That trailer that was parked down there. What happened to it? - What spot? - That spot right over there. I don't see it. - Well, where'd it go? - It's gone. I know it's gone, goddamn it, but where'd it go? - Back home, I suppose. - Denver? Some folks just don't take me into their confidence. The plates said Colorado. Sound right to you? - When'd they leave? - This morning. Thanks. Goodbye, now. Hey, Philo. I've got a message for you. Why don't you watch what the hell you're doing? Why don't you shut your face, boy? What have we got here? A real, live, macho cowboy. Don't turn your back. - Somebody call the cops. - They are the cops. Shit. - She didn't say where she was going? - Nope. - Well, how do you know where to look? - I'll know. Well, how do you know she wants you to come looking for her? There you go asking those dumb questions again. - Is Clyde going? - Yes. - You got room for one more? - Yes. Got you! I'm coming. - Which way are we headed? - East. Sounds reasonable. East? What are you gonna do with the baboon? Orangutan, Ma. Clyde's an orangutan. - What's the difference? - He has 12 ribs, just like you and me. - What are you going to do with him? - He's coming with me. Come on. Well, when are you coming back? - When are you coming back? - Whenever it's time, Ma. It don't seem right to leave an old lady alone. And what about my goddamn license? This is... It's just... Twelve ribs. I don't believe any of that shit! This machine is very sensitive. What do you think you'll find here? You never know what you'll find here. Just listen. It picks up all kinds of metal. Swiss watches, expensive foreign cameras, silver dollars. Gold, man. - Gold? - Yeah. - Herb. - Yeah. What are we going to do about that son of a bitch? - Who? - You know who I'm talking about. That cowboy at the Palomino Club. I don't know what you can do about him. What can we do, man? You mean to stand there and tell me you'd let him get away with it? You got anything in mind? What I got in mind is to break his stupid head. - Listen, are you sure that thing works? - Sure it works. Just keep digging. Besides, you don't even know where to find him. Don't worry. I'll find him. I got a plan. - What's that? - I'm going to use my medical leave. What are you laughing at? You're going to spend your two weeks medical leave looking for him? I'll spend the next two years looking for him if I have to. - What's up? - Pit stop. - Are these cantaloupes fresh? - Yes. - Are they today's? - Yes. They just came in. No, I only want a quarter of a pound. These only cost a quarter a pound. I only want a quarter of a pound of tomatoes. Yes, ma'am. Right. Can I have a fresh bag now? I'll take these two cantaloupes. How much are they a pound? Cantaloupes are 29 cents a pound. I think they were cheaper down the road. I don't know why you're so expensive here. Ma'am. - Can you help me out? - Sure. - What's your name? - Echo. Echo. Do you want some cantaloupes? Those are beautiful. Thank you. How many would you like? Do you live around here? Yeah. Down past the wash. Where's the wash? How come you want to know so much about me? Because I never met anyone that made me feel like you do. Right out of the gate. - Where are you headed? - East. - What's your name? - Echo. - What? - Echo. Orville. What did you say, anyway, that made that woman storm away? I told her you had the clap. All right, spread out. - Hey, heifer, how's the slop? - Suits the clientele real good. Looking real good. Don't you got no special of the day? Liver and onions. Why don't you read the menu? Maybe I'd rather talk to you. Has Philo Beddoe been around? You want to talk, take a walk. You want to eat, take a seat. What are you laughing at? Lard-ass! I'll tell you what: Turn around and walk out that door, and I'll forget what you said. And I won't tell everybody that you drink horse piss. - Elmo, Cholla, did you hear what he said? - I heard it. - I'll just keep this warm for you, Lester. - Okay, big mouth, let's go. You want me to keep a piece of that lemon meringue? Yeah, this won't take but a minute. Let's go, cutes. Drinking horse piss. What is this? - Hey, come on! - Get him, come on! Kick him in the nuts. Kick him in the shins. Come on over here. Give me a hand. Where you going? Get back here. That's it. Get this little son of a gun right there. Good. Hurry up. Get out of there, Roy. Look out. My God. Spread out! Goddamn morphadites. Come on. Get the hell out of the way. Hurry. Let's go. Move it. - Who is it? - The police. I'm coming. I'm coming, goddamn it! What do you want with an old lady? Ma'am, we're looking for Philo Beddoe. Our records say he lives at this address. Well, your records are wrong. He lives at that address in the back. What do you want him for? - Just looking for him, ma'am. - Well, he don't live there anymore. He's gone off. Took that son of a bitch, Clyde, with him. Clyde? His ape. His ape? You heard me. What you making me repeat myself for? Do you know where he's gone? Who gives a damn? Stealing all my Oreos. Crapping all over the place. Twelve ribs, my ass! - Thank you. Sorry to bother you. - Yeah. I'm sorry, too, you see. Leave an old lady alone, fending for herself. No protection. It just don't seem... Well, I don't suppose you know of a ladies' room hereabouts? They're all over. Just pick one. - She's something, ain't she? - She sure is. You're full of all kinds of surprises these days. Listen, I want to say that I appreciate your making her feel at home. Clyde. There's something out there! God, it's horrible! It's a monster. - It's not even a bear. It's a... - No, Echo, it's just Clyde. Hey, Echo! Wait. Give me... What? Take it easy. You're going to scare him. - Me, scare him? - That's right. Let me introduce you. Echo, this is Clyde. Clyde, this is Echo. Echo. Did you get it? It's okay. See? - Hey, granny, how they hanging? - Hey, hot damn. - What are you doing tonight, honey? - Let her alone. She's mine. I saw her first. - Say, old lady. Where's Philo Beddoe? - How the hell do I know? Get off my porch with that thing. Get off my property! You're not very hospitable. Hospitable, my ass. Get off my porch! Very well. If you insist. All right, lady. Put that gun down! I'm warning you, lady. Put down that gun, now! Wait for me! First, the police. I told those boys not to leave a vulnerable old lady all alone. Hospitable? Horseshit! - Police. - Yeah? I want to ask you questions about a girl. Her name was Lynn Halslay-Taylor. Halsey. Yeah. She was here, but she left. Hey, man. How come that cat ain't moving? You think he's dead? Shit, man, if he's the only one here, let's have some fun. Shut up! But he's only one old man. It was only one old woman that nearly ruinated all of you. Yeah. Maybe we ought to split. Hello, there. You in there? What is it? What the hell are you doing here? Well, I'm looking for a girl that used to stay around here. - She was with a guy named Philo Beddoe. - Don't know no Philo Beddoe. Well, the girl's name was Halsey-Taylor. Lynn Halsey-Taylor. She must've been one jim-dandy of a girl. You're the third one come to ask about her since she left for Denver. - You don't say. - Yeah. - Could I put that back there? - Sure, doll. It'll be here when you need it. - Buy you a drink? - Sure. Taste that, too. Here. Get out of my stuff, Clyde. Here, take a piece of this. That's my salad. Why don't you two take the truck? Clyde and I are going to go check around. - What's going on? - Orville, you've got to get up. - Why? - Because it just isn't right, that's why. - What isn't right? - What isn't right? It just ain't right. I mean... I mean, you two have somebody. And I've almost got somebody. And it just ain't right. - Well, what isn't right about it? - You just don't understand, do you? Yeah. He just doesn't understand. Right, and that's why we've got to do something about it. We do? Yeah. Here. Off your ass and on your feet. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm talking about Clyde, damn it. You think he doesn't understand. He sits back there all the time. You don't think he understands, but he's smart. And I'll tell you something, Orville. He thinks about a lot of things besides Oreo cookies. Right, Clyde? - You don't mean... - I mean exactly that. Where the hell are we going to get Clyde laid in the middle of the night? Shit. How the hell do you break into a zoo? It's easy. Zoos are meant to keep everybody in. Listen to that. He knows something good will happen. Well, how do you know there's a lady in there for him? I don't, but if there is one there... ...and he doesn't find it, he wouldn't know what to do, anyway. Give me a hand. Come on. Well, what do you want us to do? The place is probably guarded, so I want you to stay here and keep an eye out. Come on, pal. Okay. All right, Clyde. Up. Boy, I bet there's a gal in there. Think there's a lady in there? You bet, man. Clyde, you think there's a lady in there? Come on. Clyde. Orville. When we get to this next town, you should drum up some action. We're getting a little short on cash. Sure, why not. Do you know where the meat-packing plant is? - No. But I'll find it. - All right, I'll see you there. You got it. I don't care much for that perfume they're wearing. - Do they know me here? - No, it's even money. - Anything else? - Yeah. Guy's name is Kincaid. He's a local champion. Taller than you. About 240 pounds. I checked. - And? - They say he stacks up to Tank Murdock. Tank Murdock? You know, like them all, Tank's gonna fall. And another thing, he fights dirty. - Orville Boggs? - You got it. Okay, open the gate. It's over there in the cold room. - How much you want? - What you got? - We'll take it. You've got to show me something besides conversation. - I'll take that. - All right, if I see yours. What do you want us to do with the body? Save your breath. It's enough you'll lose your money. - Hey, man. - Hey, baby! What's up? I want you. Come on, Philo, put him away! Don't let him tag you! What the hell are you doing, Philo? It's getting cold in here! - I think you owe us some money. - What money? Wait a minute. You aren't gonna tell all these boys that you'll take their money, are you? That was just so you'd know the first one was no accident. Did you see this little filly shoot? Where did you ever learn to do that? You could shoot a gnat off a buffalo's ass. - I told you I could take care of myself. - She took care of us. Car 103. Proceed to the intersection of Interstate 5 and Velasquez Road... ... for a 602. 103 here. Got you, over. That 602's the same as our 406. No way. It's got to be the same as our 309 or at the best our 213. You're crazy. No New Mexican 602 can come anywhere near California 309. When's the last time you been out on a 309? Maybe three or four months. But it don't mean that I don't know that our 309 ain't more than their 602. - What time you got? Unit 103, abort that 602, 103. Proceed to Velasquez Road on Interstate 5 for a 607. Well, kiss my... I suppose you think I'm crazy traipsing across the country... ...after a girl I hardly even know. Hell, I'm not like Orville. It takes me a long time to get to know a girl. Even longer to let her know me. You know what I mean? I'm not afraid of any man, but sharing my feelings with a woman... ...my stomach just turns to royal gelatin. I don't suppose that ever happens to you. I guess you just keep howling until sometime they howl back. If this is a strike, it means Ronstadt and Parton move over. It's Halsey-Taylor to the top. It's okay. It just means it's going to take a little longer. But we don't give up. If I get this pickup... ...it means the same time next year... ...Halsey-Taylor has her own special. That was a mighty fine pickup, little lady. Thank you. Will you mind Clyde for me? I'm going to take a run. All right. Shit! Hey, Lynn! Wait up! Fancy meeting you here. Incredible is more like it. What are you doing? Following you. You picked me up just in time. All this weather. You took off so fast I thought there was something wrong. Bad time to run. I figured maybe I'd better follow you. Thought you'd better, huh? Hell, you didn't even get a chance to meet Clyde. Pull in right here. I know where he keeps the money now, so it's a matter of finding the right time. I still say my way would be quicker. Philo, you promised. Please don't make me sorry I told you. You make me afraid to believe you. I never want to make you sorry. You want to come down and meet everybody? No, I'd better go back. We'll do it when we have more time. Tomorrow night? Like we agreed? El Patio Restaurant. Philo? You're really something. Jesus Christ. Goddamn, I don't believe what I'm seeing. I think I'm still asleep and dreaming. You're not dreaming. Come on. Get your ass up. Hi, Clyde. How you doing? Let's let the little lady up. What did you do that for? I think he's trying to tell us something. What's he trying to tell us? Why are you so all fired happy, Philo? Listen, the only time I ever see you smiling is when... You got laid? You were jogging, and you picked up somebody and laid her. - Did he? - I'll do you one better than that. - You mean Clyde got laid again, too? - No. I ran into Lynn Halsey-Taylor. How'd you do that? I was running down the highway and she picked me up. - Where is she now? - She's in town. She's getting things straightened up, we'll see her. Goddamn, that is good news. That means we can go home soon. I don't see why not. While we're waiting around for true romance... ...I think I'll jump down and get some flies. There's no way I don't want to get in on this action. - Help me finish these first, will you? - Right. Did you ever notice how drinking and fishing kind of go together? - You sell fishing licenses in here? - Sure do. Something about the six-pack and the worms. - Any good trout around here? - About four or five miles down the road. Orville. Don't these look like the humpers Clyde was eating this morning? Are these the flies Philo wanted? Grayish yellow. Hey, Philo. Where's your boat? I'm going to hang out here on shore. Echo and I are going on down to the other end here. - We got him? - Got him. Here. Be careful, it's loaded. Why the scattergun? - Because I don't want to miss that sucker. - Makes sense. Here. Why all the fishing gear? Because we got to look like we're going fishing, dummy. Now look, I'll go right through there. You go around the lake and come from behind him. I'm going around this lake... Damn it. Not so loud. He'll hear you. It's not so far. And here. Get going. Now get going, will you? Stinking hippie. Quite a mess of fish. Shit. The white boy's the craziest son of a bitch in the world. Where in the hell is that Putnam? What are you doing, boy? My God! Feet! Feet don't fail me now, man. Goddamn apes, snakes, alligators and shit! You so much as blink, and I'll blow a big hole in you. Who are you and what do you want? Just never you mind. You'll find out soon enough. What the hell was that? - Jesus. - Good Lord. He must be 5 or 6 pounds. Give him some slack. Don't jerk, you'll lose him! God, he's a monster. Don't jerk him! Give me that rod! I've never seen anything like it in my life. He's a monster! He's a frigging monster! I've never seen anything like it before. He must weigh 25 pounds. He's a stud! He's got to be a stud! Come on, help me here. Boy, he is a stud! - Have a stud. - Shit! Putnam! Big, dumb galoot. Putnam, where are you? Dummy. What was that? I think he's spending too much time with Clyde. What are we supposed to do with all this stuff? Eat it. All of it. - ""All of it""? - All of it. What if I can't? Then we'll give it to Clyde. Can you imagine what this would do to Clyde's digestive tract? He already has enough gas to go to North Denver. And he's never seen a bean in his life. Say, when's your little lady coming here? She should be along any time. Let's get out of here. Listen, Philo. Does that mean we're going back to L.A.? Hell, no. But when I find her... ...l'll take care of that guy she's with. My way. Hey, an Airstream! Hey, Cholla! That's the one! Howdy. I bet you're Lynn Halsey-Taylor, ain't you? Now how'd you know that? Well, we been following you, all the way from Los Angeles. You see me sing at the Palomino? I'm sorry to say, I missed that, but I promise not to miss it next time. Well, then, what did all you boys follow me all the way to Colorado for? Do you know a guy named Philo? Philo Beddoe? He's been following you. You know that? Yeah, I know that. Is he a friend of yours? Not particularly. You want to find him? Not particularly. We do. Now, that's a nice looking truck. There she is. You stay here. This is personal. Lynn! You Philo Beddoe? Do I know you? You're going to. Last time I saw you two, you were going for a fast freight. The last time we saw you, you were dirt-diving in an alfalfa patch. Philo Beddoe. Your time has come. Here we go again. I got him. The bikes, you dummies! The bikes! The bikes! Are those guys coming after me? Those guys are coming after me! I'll get him! I'm going to kill you all! Look out! Watch out for the truck! Hi, cutie pie. Want a ride? - Don't mind if I do. - Hop in. Darling, I'm only glad you happened along when you did. Nice day for a drive. - Look at these guys coming up the road. - I love this. Ten points. Get out of the way! There's the boy. - Thanks. - Make sure that door's closed, would you? Let's go get a bite to eat. No, you go on ahead. Clyde and me will eat later. We'll bring you back something, okay, Philo? Whatever. He's locked into that phone book. He must have called every place in town. What are you hungry for? Are you sure you don't want me to go in there and just hang out? - He pulled a shotgun last time. - This is personal. I'll handle it. Why don't Echo and I just go in and have a beer and listen to the music? - Do you want to borrow my pea shooter? - Thanks. You two go have a good time. See if you can find out the location of Tank Murdock. - What will you have? - A beer. Lynn Halsey-Taylor, everybody. All right! It's great to have you back in Denver, Lynn. And now, everybody, the featured performer of the evening... ... the star of tonight's show, Mr. Charlie Rich. The best club out there is the Palomino, and the manager's a good friend. So, I'll write him, tell him to give you a spot. That's mighty nice of you. Like me? Want me? - Let's go. - Harlan. I've got a friend. It's okay, though. He won't mind, he just might want to come along. Let's go. - Is this your... - No. You want to talk to him? The lady and I have a little business. I expect you'll be excusing us. Maybe you ought to excuse yourself. It's okay, Harlan, I'll just be a minute. - Are you sure? - Yes. It's your own goddamn fault! Who asked you to follow me? - I just thought... - You thought! If you'd thought, you would've taken some very broad hints. I've been trying to get rid of you practically ever since the first night we met. - What about Taos? - What about it? I need it just like anybody else. - You do this all the time. - I do this all the time. And you and me had our time, so why don't you know when to disappear? - Come here. - Take your hands off me! Lynn? Is everything all right? Schyler, this is the one from L.A. The big, dumb one I told you about. Schyler, with the shotgun? That was my idea. I was hoping he'd scare you away. Why didn't you just say goodbye? You're here, aren't you? Guys like you don't understand goodbye. What do you do? You hustle for him? You're just not too smart, are you? Why did you have to come? Why couldn't you quit like everybody else? You had to come chasing me and spoil it all. I guess I'm just not too smart, that's all. Up to now, I'm the only one dumb enough to want to take you further than your bed. I hate you! I hate you. I hate you. Well, listen, do you want to rest up a little bit? - You don't have to take him tonight. - No, that's fine. - Are you Philo Beddoe? - That's right. Keep on walking, you'll see him. - Here you go. - Is that all the money? - What's with the girl? - Don't worry about it. What do you mean, ""Don't worry about it""? Right to your left. Don't worry about it, Philo. This guy's a real porker. He's carrying his reputation around his waist. Looks like you've had a go at it already. You sure that face won't hurt too much to fight? - I ain't going to hit you with my face. - That's funny. I like you. Don't worry, we'll get this over in a hurry and take care of you. Where did you hear of Tank Murdock before, kid? - All around. - Yeah? - They say you're the best. - They do? Well, let's get with it. Jesus Christ, who is that guy? I don't know, but he's the one that'll beat Tank Murdock. Come on, Tank! Come on, get him! Jesus Christ, that guy's going to beat Tank Murdock! Get up! Come on! This guy will be the new Tank Murdock! - This is it for Tank! - Who is this guy? The new guy's beaten Tank! You has-been! You ought to learn to box! You old bum! You're all washed up! That guy's the new Tank Murdock. We're going to make money on this guy. My champ! ""5, Z."" Just a minute there, now. ""B."" Why don't you try that one with your glasses on? Yes. Why didn't I think of that? - There. Now try it again. - Thank you, I will. ""5, Z, B, D, F."" - You did it. - Of course I did. Now, if you'd please step over there for your photograph. - My what? - Your photograph. To put on your license. My photograph. Well, what will they think of next? I think I forgot my comb. Don't you worry. Your hair looks quite lovely. Do you really think so? All right, you ready? Let me get you focused. All right, now smile. Big smile., - Good morning, Miss Ratched. - Good morning. - Good morning, Miss Ratched. - Mr. Washington. - Good morning, Miss Ratched. - Good morning. - Good morning, Bancini. - Good morning. How are you feeling? Rested. Medication time. Medication time. Okay, move it up! Mr. Fredrickson, here. Juice. Chief. Okay, my friend, let's go. Here are his papers, and I'm going to need a signature. Hi. - Mr. McMurphy is here. - All right. Thank you. All right, I'm ready. Okay. One pair of socks. T-shirt. Hi. Goddamn, boy, you're as big as a mountain! Looks like you might have played some football. What's your name? He can't hear you. He's deaf. Deaf and dumb Indian. Is that so? Come on, Bibbit. Can't even make a sound, huh? How. Club lead. Jack of clubs. What's your name, son? Billy Bibbit. Glad to know you, Bill. McMurphy's mine. Those are old Charlie Cheswick's cards. That's his ace of spades. Your turn, Bill. Big ten. - Put one of them on it, will you? - Wait a minute. Oh, I can win that one. - I win. - Oh, you overtrumped? - Sure. - Pinochle, Bill? What's the bid? You like to look at other people's cards, do you? Yes. Ever seen this one? - Come on, Martini. - Martini! Martini, will you? Will you play a club? Whose turn is it now? Let's see, he trumped... Where you going? - Aren't you going to play? - What's the matter? Aren't you going to play, Martini? Martini? I want to play. Billy? Billy, I want to win some... Get a grip on yourself, will you? Yes? - Mr. McMurphy's here, Doc. - Good, have him come in. Thank you. McMurphy, I'm Dr. Spivey. Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure it is to meet you. Sure. Pull up a chair, sit down and let's talk. Sure. R.P. McMurphy. That's a hell of a fish there, Doc. - Isn't that a dandy? - Yeah. It's about 40 pounds, ain't it? - No, 32. - Thirty-two. But I'll tell you, it took every bit of strength I had... ...to hold it while the guy took the picture. Every damn bit. Probably that chain didn't help it any, either. You didn't weigh the chain, did you? No, I didn't weigh the chain. But, I'm awful proud of that picture. That's the first Chinooker I ever caught. It's a nice one. Randall Patrick McMurphy. 38 years old. What can you tell me about... ...why you've been sent over here? Well... I don't know. What's it say there? - Mind if I smoke? - No, go right ahead. Well, it... ...says several things here. It said you've been belligerent. Talked when unauthorized. You've been resentful in attitude towards work, in general. That you're lazy. Chewing gum in class. The real reason you've been sent here... ...is because they wanted you to be evaluated. To determine whether or not you're mentally ill. This is the real reason. Why do you think they might think that? Well, as near as I can figure out, it's because I... ...fight and fuck too much. In the penitentiary? No, you mean why... Why did you get sent over here... ...from the work farm? Well, I really don't know, Doc. It says here that you went around... - Let me just take a look... - It ain't up to me. One... ...two, three... ...four... You've got at least... ...five arrests for assault. What can you tell me about that? Five fights, huh? Rocky Marciano has 40, and he's a millionaire. - That's true. - That is true. Of course, it's true that you went in for... ...statutory rape. That's true, is it not, this time? Absolutely true. But, Doc... ...she was 15 years old going on 35, Doc... ...and she told me she was 18, and she was... ...very willing, you know what I mean? I practically had to take to sewing my pants shut. But between you and me... ...she might have been 15. When you get that little red beaver... ...right there in front of you, I don't think it's crazy at all. I don't think you do either. I hear what you're saying. No man alive could resist that. That's why I got into jail to begin with. Now they're telling me I'm crazy over here... ...because I don't sit there like a goddamn vegetable. It don't make a bit of sense to me. If that's what being crazy is... ...then I'm senseless, out of it, gone down the road, whacko. But, no more, no less. That's it. To be honest with you, McMurphy... ...what it says here... ...is that they think... They think... ...you've been faking it in order to get out of your work detail. - What do you think about that? - Do I look like that kind of guy to you? Let's just be frank for a minute. Randall, if you would. Tell me... Do you think there's anything wrong with your mind, really? Not a thing, Doc. I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science. You're going to be here for a period, for us to evaluate you. We're going to study you. We'll make our determinations as to what we're going to do... ...and give you the necessary treatment as indicated. Doc, let me just tell you this. I'm here to cooperate with you 100 percent. 100 percent. I'll be just right down the line with you. You watch. Because I think we ought to get to the bottom of... ...R.P. McMurphy. The scythe. I'm awfully tired. Sit down. - God, I'm tired. - Sit down. Is that better? Mr. Ellsworth... ...you'll wear yourself out. All right, gentlemen, let's begin. At the close of Friday's meeting... ...we were discussing Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife. Mr. Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy... ...because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mr. Harding? Yes. That's correct. He also thinks he may have given her reason... ...to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he wasn't able to say how. Mr. Harding has been heard to say to his wife: ""I hate you. ""I don't ever want to see you again. ""You've betrayed me."" So, does anyone care to touch on this further? Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today? Are you sure? Billy, how about you? No, ma'am. I'd like to write in my book that you began the meeting. Just once. Mr. Martini? Are you with us? Yes. Would you like to begin? Mr. Cheswick? - Me? - Yes. You mean there's not a man here who has an opinion on this matter? All right. Mr. Harding... ...you've stated on more than one occasion... ...that you've suspected your wife of seeing other men. Oh, yes. Yes, very much, I suspect her. I suspect her. Maybe you can tell us why... ...you suspect her. Well, I can only... ...speculate as to the reasons why. Have you ever speculated, Mr. Harding... ...that perhaps you are... ...impatient with your wife... ...because she doesn't meet your mental requirements? Perhaps. But you see, the only thing I can really... ...speculate on, Nurse Ratched... ...is the very existence of my life... ...with or without my wife... ...in terms of the human relationships, the juxtaposition of... ...one person to another, the form, the content. Harding, why don't you knock off the bullshit and get to the point? This is the point. This is the point, Taber. It's not bullshit. I'm not just talking about my wife, I'm talking about my life! I can't seem to get that through to you. I'm not just talking about one person, I'm talking about everybody! I'm talking about form! I'm talking about content! I'm talking about interrelationships! I'm talking about God, the Devil, Hell, Heaven! Do you understand? Finally? Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb I can't believe it. It makes me feel very peculiar, very peculiar... ...when you throw in something like that. - Why? What does that mean, ""peculiar""? - Peculiar? - Peculiar? I'm going to tell you guys something. You just don't want to learn anything. You just don't want to listen to anybody. He's got intelligence! You've never heard the word ""peculiar""? Say, what are you trying to say? You trying to say I'm queer? Is that it? Little Mary Ann? Little Marjorie Jane? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Is that your idea of communicating something to me? Well, is it? They're all crowding in on you, Mr. Harding. They're all ganging up on you. Is that news? They sometimes want to gang up on me, too, but I... Cheswick, do me a favor. Take it easy. - And stay off my side. - But I only want to... I only want to help you. - I understand. - But don't you want me to... - Please! - But I only want to... - Please! - But I only want to help you. Please! You see... ...the other day you made some allusions, both of you. - Illusions? - Yes, allusions. Not illusions. Allusions... ...to sexual problems I might be having with my wife. Let's say it's true! Let's say I know it's true, but you don't! If that's your idea of trying to tell me something... You know, Harding, I think you're some kind of morbid asshole! - ""Peculiar!"" - ""Asshole"" again. It makes you feel ""peculiar."" You've talked about your wife ever since I can remember! You know, she's on your mind, and blah, blah... I'm not talking about my wife! When will you get that through your thick head? When are you going to wise up and turn her loose? - Please! - I don't want to hear it! - I'm tired. - I don't want to hear it! I'm tired. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it. It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired. I don't want to hear it! We know you're tired. We're all tired. - I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney. - You're not tired, Bancini. Take your hands off me! Recreation time, gentlemen. The bus is waiting. All nonrestricted patients please report to the bus. Ever play this game, Chief? Come on, I'll show you. Old Indian game. It's called ""put the ball in the hole."" Now, that ought to be just... Hold it right there. All right. Now, that's your spot. Don't move. Never move. That's your spot, you understand? Right there. You don't move. Now... ...take the ball. Here, take the ball. That's it. Hold on to it. Not too hard, Chief. You'll crush all the air out of it. We're gonna put her in the basket. You understand? All right. Now, raise up your arms. Raise the ball up in the air, Chief. Raise it up. McMurphy? What the hell are you talking to him for? He can't hear a fucking thing. I ain't talking to him. I'm talking to myself. It helps me think. Yeah, well, it don't help him none. Well, it don't hurt him, either, does it? Don't hurt you, does it, Chief? See? Don't hurt him. All right, now, Chief. Let's raise our hands up in the air. Just raise them up. Up, you understand? Raise the hands up, here. Up. Raise your hands up. Up! That's it! That's it! Up, all the way up. All the way up. That's a baby, all right. Okay, now... Now, jump up in the air, and put it in the basket, Chief. Jump up and dunk it in! Jump up in the air and stuff that son of a bitch in there, Chief. Take a rest, Chief. Just stay right there. Take a rest. I'll be right back. Bancini, come here for a minute. You're looking all right. Get right over here for a second. Now, just stand right there. Just get down a little bit. All right. Stand up. Stand up. Go ahead. That's a baby! All right, you got it. All right. Now, over there. Hit me, Chief! I got the moves! I got them, Chief! Hold it right there. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. That's it. Thank you, Chief. Now... ...hold it right there. You take the ball, you jump up, and put it in the basket. See what I mean? Put it... Bancini, hold still. All right, Chief, here. Take the ball. Now, jump up and put it in the basket, Chief! Jump up and put it in the basket! Not you, Bancini. Raise up! Bancini, where you going? I'm tired! Fast break! Defense! Get back! Come on, Bancini, where the fuck you going at? General, get this man around here. That's it, back! Over to Chief. Fast break! Fast break! Hit me, Chief! Hit me, baby! Put it in the basket, Chief! Put it in the basket! All right. Make the bets. What's this? Make the bets. It's a dime, Martini. I bet a nickel. A dime is the limit, Martini. I bet a dime. This is not a dime, Martini. This is a dime. If you break it in half... ...you don't get two nickels, you get shit. Try and smoke it. You understand? You don't understand! All right, here they come. Queen to the Chesser, Big Bull to Tabulations... ...ten to Billy to match his whang, and the dealer gets a three. Hit me. Hit me. I can't hit you because it ain't your turn yet. You understand? You see these other people? These are the real ones. These are real people here. What'll you do, Ches? Hit or sit? Hit me. That's 23 up, Cheswick. Taber, you're busted. Give me this. Twenty-three. - Hit me. - Shut up! Taber. - Give me a dime! - I'm next. You're not next! Hit me. - Ace. - Hit me. That's 4 or 14. Don't want any more. Billy? - Hit me. Hit me. - Five. You didn't make a bet, Martini. I can't hit you. Jesus Christ. I bet a dime. All right, here. - That's 20 showing. - No. - Take your money. - No. It's not. It's 10, 11, 12, 13. This is a fucking queen here, you understand? You don't count the this and the this. Hit me. You got 20 showing! Hit me again. I want another card. Scanlon, who's pitching the opener? Medication time. This isn't a queen! Mac, hit me. - Who's pitching the opener? - Hit me. Jesus Christ Almighty! Do you nuts want to play cards or do you want to fucking jerk off? Play the game! I can't even hear myself think already, here. Stay back! - Excuse me, ma'am. I just wanted to... - Stay back! Patients aren't allowed in the nurses' station. Well, I just wanted to turn... When you're outside, we'll discuss whatever problem you have, okay? The patients are not allowed in the nurses' station. All right? Yes, ma'am. Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on? Thank you. Excuse me, miss. Do you think it might be possible to turn the music down... ...so maybe a couple of the boys could talk? That music is for everyone, Mr. McMurphy. I know, but do you think we might ease it down a little... ...so maybe the boys didn't have to shout? What you probably don't realize... ...is that we have a lot of old men in this ward... ...who couldn't hear the music if we turned it lower. That music is all they have. Your hand is staining my window. - I'm sorry, ma'am. - All right. Mr. McMurphy, your medication. What's in the horse pill? It's just medicine. It's good for you. Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking something if I don't know what it is. Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy. I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow. It's just that I don't want anyone to try and slip me saltpeter. You know what I mean? It's all right, Nurse Pilbow. If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want to take his medication orally... ...I'm sure we can arrange that he can have it some other way. But I don't think you'd like it, Mr. McMurphy. You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on? Give it to me. Good. Very good! Yummy! Mr. Harding? Merci. Tell me, lover-boy... ...why didn't you tell her to go fuck herself? Jesus Christ. Funny, huh? That's funny, huh? You know that wasn't very smart. She could have seen that. God Almighty, she's got you guys coming and going. What do you think she is? Some kind of a champ or something? No, I thought you were the champ. You want to bet? Bet on what? One week. I bet in one week I can put a bug so far up her ass... ...she won't know whether to shit or wind her wrist watch. What do you say to that? Want to bet? Do you want to bet? One week. That's all I need. Who wants to bet? You want to bet? Bet a buck. One buck. I'll bet. Tabes in, one buck. Solid. Last time we were discussing... ...Mr. Harding and the problem with his wife... ...and I think we were making a lot of progress. So who would like to begin today? Mr. McMurphy? I've been thinking about what you said about... ...you know, getting things off your chest. Well, there's a couple of things that I'd like to get off my chest. Well, that's very good, Mr. McMurphy. Go ahead. Today, as you may or may not know, it doesn't matter... ...is the opening of the World Series. What I'd like to suggest is that we change the work detail tonight... ...so that we can watch the ball game. Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking... ...is that we change a very carefully worked-out schedule. A little change never hurt, huh? A little variety? Well, it's not necessarily true, Mr. McMurphy. Some men on the ward take a long, long time to get used to the schedule. Change it now, and they might find it very disturbing. Fuck the schedule! They can go back to the schedule after the Series. I'm talking about the World Series, Nurse Ratched. Well, anyway, this is no way to proceed about this. How would it be if we had a vote... ...and let the majority rule? Great. Let's vote on it. So, all those in favor raise your hands. Okay, guys, come on. Put your hands up. What's the matter with you? Don't you want to watch the World Series? Get your hands up. It can do you some good... ...to get some exercise, putting your arms up in the air. That's it. Come on, let's... What is this crap? I watch the Series. I haven't missed the Series in years. Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler they run it there or they'll have a riot. What's the matter with you guys? Come on, be good Americans! Well, Mr. McMurphy, I only count three votes, and... ...that's not enough to change the ward policy. I'm sorry. My turn. Okay, hot dice. I want a ten to go... ...because I need cash. I want to get to Mediterranean Avenue. Big ten! Perfect. Two fives. - What are you doing? - Hotel. - You do not have a hotel there. - Hotel. For the third time... ...you do not have a hotel on Boardwalk. - Hotel. It costs $1,000 and four green houses... ...to put a hotel on Boardwalk. - Hotel. Play the game and knock off the bullshit. Play the game. What are you talking about? I am. - Play the game! - I ain't doing anything to you! - What bullshit? - Your bullshit! - What about your bullshit? - Play! - You keep your hands off me! - Play the game! I've had enough bullshit from you! - Play the game. - What are you picking on me for? Play the game, Harding. - I'm trying to ignore you, see? - Just play the game. Keep your hands off me, you son of a bitch! Keep your hands off me! You hear me? - Come on, come on. - I can be pushed just so far, see! Play the game. You touch me once more. Just touch me once more! Just once more, huh? Just once more! - Just touch me once more! - Play the game, Harding! Just touch me once more! Holy Jesus! Is that what your schedule does for you, Hard-on? Goddamn lunatic! I don't know what you're talking about. No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh? Because I'm going downtown to watch the World Series, anyway. Anybody want to come with me? I do, Mac. I want to go with you! Ches, all right. Anybody else? - Where? - Any bar downtown. Mac, you can't... ...get out of here. Anybody want to bet? Chicken shits! Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched his big thing... ...and she'll open the door for him. Yeah, maybe I will... ...and then maybe I'll use your thick skull and knock a hole in the wall. Sefelt, see? Why? My head would squash like an eggplant. Fuck Sefelt's head, I don't need Sefelt's head! I'll take this thing, and put it through the window... ...and me and Cheswick will go out through the hall... ...downtown, sit down in a bar, wet our whistles... ...and watch the ball game. And that's the bet. Now, does anybody want any of it? You're going to lift that thing? Yeah! That's right. I'll bet a buck. Taber, $1. I bet a dime. Mac, you can't... ...lift that thing. Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on? I'll bet $25! $25, Hard-on! Mac, nobody could ever lift that thing. Get out of my way, son. You're using my oxygen. You know what I mean? All right. All right. Giving up? No! Just warming up. Warming up. This will be the one. All right, baby. But I tried, didn't I? Goddamn it! At least I did that. And on the mound, the left-hander, Al Downing. The two pitchers still warming up, right down below us. The second game of the 1963 World Series... ... is being brought to you from Yankee Stadium. Did you tell the girl how you felt about her? I went over to her house... ...one Sunday afternoon and... ...and I brought her some flowers... ...and I said: ""Celia, will you... ""...marry me?"" Why did you want to marry her? Well, I was in love with her. Your mother told me that you never told her about it. Why didn't you tell her about it? Wasn't that the first time you tried to commit suicide? Oh, my God! Yes, Mr. Cheswick? Miss Ratched... ...I'd like to ask you a question, please. Go ahead. Okay. You know, if Billy doesn't feel like talking... ...I mean, why are you pressing him? Why can't we go on to some new business? The business of this meeting, Mr. Cheswick... ...is therapy. You know, I don't understand this, Miss Ratched... ...because I don't... Mr. McMurphy... ...said something yesterday about a World Series. A baseball game? You know, and I've never been to a baseball game and... ...I think I'd like to see one. That would be good therapy, too, wouldn't it, Miss Ratched? I thought we'd decided that issue. I don't think so, because, I mean... ...we discussed that yesterday... ...and we have a new game today, I think, don't we, Mac? That's right, Ches, and we want a new vote on it, don't we? Would one more vote satisfy you, Mr. McMurphy? Yeah. It'll satisfy me. There's a vote before the group. Everyone in favor of changing the schedule, please raise your hand. Okay, I want to see the hands. Come on! Which one of you nuts has got any guts? All right. That's it! I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy. She only counts nine. Only nine! It's a landslide. There are 18 patients on this ward, Mr. McMurphy... ...and you have to have a majority to change ward policy. So you gentlemen can put your hands down now. Are you trying to tell me that you're going to count these? These poor sons of bitches, they don't know what we're talking about. Well, I have to disagree with you, Mr. McMurphy. These men are members of the ward, just as you are. All right. All I need is one vote, right? Right? All right. Okay. Want to watch the World Series? This could be a big moment for you. You want to watch a baseball game? You want to watch baseball? Just raise that hand up. Just raise the hand up. - What do you say? - I gave it all to her. Sorry. Bancini, old horse. What do you say? You want to watch the ball game on TV? Want to watch the ball game? Baseball? World Series? What do you say, pal? You're tired? Just raise your hand up, Bancini. Watch the ball game, huh? I'm tired. Awfully tired. Okay. All right. What about you, pal? All we need is one vote. Just one. Just your one vote. That's all we need. Just raise your hand up and your buddies can watch the baseball game. General, you remember, don't you? October, the banner, the stars... ""Oh, say can you"" The World Series. Raise your hand up, Gen. Just raise your hand up. What about you pal, huh? Want to watch the ball game? Want to watch the ball game, huh? Just one vote. Just raise your... Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned. For Christ's sake, isn't there one of you fucking maniacs... ...that knows what I'm talking about? Mr. McMurphy? The meeting is adjourned. Just wait a minute, will you? Just one minute? You can bring the subject up again tomorrow. All right, Chief... ...you're our last chance. What do you say? Just raise your hand up. That's all we need from you today, Chief. Just raise your hand up one time. Show her that you can do it. Show her that you can still do it. Just raise your hand up. All the guys have got them up. Just raise your hand up, Chief. Will you? Huh? Come on, there's got to be one guy here that's not a total fucking nut! Mac? Chief! The Chief! Nurse Ratched? Nurse Ratched, look! Look. The Chief put his hand up. The Chief put his hand up. Look, he voted. Would you please turn the television set on? The Chief has got his hand up, right there. The Chief voted. Now... ...will you please turn the television set on? Mr. McMurphy... ...the meeting was adjourned, and the vote was closed. But the vote was ten to eight. The Chief, he's got his hand up! Look! No, Mr. McMurphy. When the meeting was adjourned, the vote was nine to nine. Come on, you're not going to say that now! You're not going to say that now! You're going to pull that henhouse shit, now, when the vote... The Chief just voted! It was ten to nine! I want that television set turned on! Right now! Cheswick. - I want to watch television. - No, you have a work assignment. Koufax. Koufax kicks. He delivers. It's up the middle, it's a base hit. Richardson's rounding first, going for second! The ball's into deep right center! Davidson cuts the ball off! Here comes the throw. Richardson's around first! He slides, he's in there. It's a double! He's in there! Look at Richardson, on second base. Koufax is in big fucking trouble! Big trouble, baby! All right, here's Tresh. He's the next batter! Tresh looks in. Koufax... Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro! He kicks once, he pumps... It's a strike! Koufax's curve ball is snapping off like a firecracker. Here he comes with the next pitch. Tresh swings! It's a long fly ball to deep left center! It's going! It's gone! Somebody give me a fucking wiener before I die. It's the great Mickey Mantle, now! Here comes the pitch! Mantle swings! It's a fucking home run! Gentlemen, stop this. Stop this immediately. Do you like it here? That fucking nurse, man! What do you mean, sir? She ain't honest. Miss Ratched is one of the finest nurses we've got in this institution. Well, I don't want to break up the meeting or nothing... ...but she's something of a cunt, ain't she, Doc? How do you mean that? She likes a rigged game, you know what I mean? Well, you know, I've been observing you here now... ...for the last four weeks... ...and I don't see any evidence of mental illness, at all. I think that you've been trying to put us on all this time. You know, what do you want me to do? You know. You know what I mean? Is that it? Is that crazy enough for you? Want me to take a shit on the floor? Christ! Have you ever heard the old saying, ""A rolling stone gathers no moss""? Yeah. Does that mean something to you? It's the same as ""Don't wash your dirty underwear in public."" I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I'm smarter than him, ain't I? Well that, sort of, has always meant... ...it's hard for something to grow on something that's moving. How did you feel about what happened yesterday? You want to kill. You know what I mean? Do you gentlemen have any more questions? I don't have any more, but perhaps you do. Do you have a question, McMurphy? Where do you suppose she lives? Chief, come on with me. We'll show these guys who's nuts. All right, wait. Stand right here. All right. Grab the fence. Grab the fence here. Right here, Chief. Strong! Strong, like this, here. That's it. All right. Okay. Up. That's it. All right, you got it? All right, push! Come on, Bob! Where are you going? Don't breathe on me, Club. Keep moving. Keep moving. Come on, you guys. Get the lead out, huh? Hey, what the hell's going on here? Wait a minute! Hold it! See how easy it is? Boys. This here is Candy. Candy, these are the boys. You all crazy? Let's go. Down here. - Isn't this wonderful? - Down here. No problem. Right here. Come on, we don't want to be late for our first day out. Hello! Come on, will you? What are you standing around for? Get on board. Give them these. Hey, wait a minute! What the heck is going on here? What are you doing on this boat? We're going fishing. No, you're not going fishing. Not on this boat. You're not going fishing on this boat. Oh, yeah, on this boat. Ask Captain Block. - Captain Block? - Captain Block. Yes, that's right. Who are you? We're from the... ...State Mental Institution. This is Dr. Cheswick... ...Dr. Taber, Dr. Fredrickson... ...Dr. Scanlon. The famous Dr. Scanlon. Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit... ...Dr. Martini, and... ...Dr. Sefelt. How about you? Who are you? I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy. Wait... Wait one second. You don't understand. We chartered the boat. We're going to go fishing. And that's all there is to it. You better quit on this. They'll throw you in the can again, you know? No, they won't. We're nuts! They'll just take us back to the feeb farm, see? Von Sefelt, get the stern line. Tabes, you're at the bow. This one? That one! The one at your feet. Get back on! Jesus! Tabes! Cheswick! Come here, quick! Aye, aye, sir. I mean, yes, Mac! Take it easy, Charlie. Have you ever driven one of these things? - Driven one of... - Yeah. No, Mac. Well, it's a lot of fun. Come on over here. Put your hands on the wheel. - Put your hands on. - I never did... Put your hands on the wheel so you don't fall down. All right. Just hold it steady right there, like that. - Steady? - Steady, yeah. Now just go straight. - Straight as an arrow. - Straight, Mac? - Just straight. That's right. - But, Mac... Mac, this thing ain't too steady. - Where are we going, Mac? - Straight. Just go on! This is the bait. Little fishes. Dead fishes. That's right. Now what are we going to do with these little fishes? - Catch big fishes. - That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini. And hooks. Hooks. Now, hold on to your hooks... ...because here are the fishes. Tabes. Get a fish here. There, for you, Martini. All right, now we, each one of us has got a fish. What are you laughing at? You're not an idiot, huh? You're not a goddamn looney now, boy, you're a fisherman. Now, take your bottom hook. You got it? You take it... ...and you... ...push it all the way through. Like that. Wait a second. Get it through the eyes, here. - Right through here. - In the eye? Don't worry about it! He's dead, Martini. Jesus Christ, just put it through his eyeball, here. That's it. Crunch it right through. All right. Now you got it, see? Now, you just pull that baby through. You see what I mean? And you wrap it around. You pull this so it's a little loop. That's very good. That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson! Very good eye work. Good eye work. That little devil's going to not even feel the sting, is he, boy? That son of a gun is going to bite on you, isn't he? You got beautiful hair. Thank you. And you got... ...beautiful eyes. Thank you. Billy, what's the matter? Fishing don't grab you? They do. Come on with me, over here. I'm going to give each and every one of you a rod. All right. Here are your poles. Now, just keep watching the tip here. If you get a strike, let me know. Understand? Come on, Candy. Just keep fishing, guys! Don't call me unless you get something really big... ...you can't handle yourselves. Keep on fishing! That's right. Where is everybody? Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you to... ...steer that boat straight! Fish! Help, help! Goddamn it, he's got a fish. Hold it! Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it! Cheswick, get the fuck back up there! Get up there in front! Tabes, I got it, Tabes! Get up, Tabes, I'll get it for you! Son of a bitch, he's going over here! Get up! I got it! I got it! Give it to me! Hey, Harding, I'm the skipper of this boat. Shut up! He said to go straight out as an arrow. You're not going straight, you're kind of... I'm going straight enough. Now, Chessy, stop it! - It's my duty! - Chessy, stop it! No, you son of a bitch! All right, Martini. All right, take him over! Take him over! That's it! Now play them, boys! You sons of bitches! Keep it straight! Come back this way! Home safe and sound. Didn't lose a nut! Beats bowling, you know what I mean? We caught it, look! They're going to be trolling this place for six months looking for dead bodies! I think he's dangerous. He's not crazy... ...but he's dangerous. You don't think he's crazy? No, he's not crazy. Dr. Songee? I don't think he's overly psychotic. But I still think he's quite sick. - Do you think he's dangerous? - Absolutely so. Well, John, what do you want to do with him? I think we've had our turn. I'd like to send him back to the work farm, frankly. Is there anybody that you have... ...on your staff, that could... ...relate to him? Maybe understand him. Help him out with some of these problems? The funny thing is that the person he's the closest to... ...is the one he dislikes the most. That's you, Mildred. Well, gentlemen, in my opinion, if we send him back to Pendleton or... ...we send him up to Disturbed... ...it's just one more way of passing on our problem to somebody else. You know, we don't like to do that. So I'd like to keep him on the ward. I think we can help him. Chief, Chief, come on. Come with me, huh? Chief, this is the spot. Right there is the spot. Remember? Raise the hands, in the basket. That's it. Raise the hands up. All right! Let's have a little ball from you nuts in here! Here we go! All right! Let's play ball, nuts. Let's make some moves! Hey, Mac. Time, time. You've got six men on the court. Harding, out of the ball game. Hey, why me? Because I'm the coach. I'll put you in later. I don't trust you. I'll go. Okay, good boy, Billy. I'll put you in in a minute, all right? Let's play ball. Harding, break over there. All right, Martini, get it back. I'm in the open! What're you doing? You threw the goddamn ball into the fence! Christ Almighty, you threw it into the fence! There's nobody there! We're playing ball! All right, come on, get in the game. Defense, nobody's doing nothing here! - For Christ's sake! - Hey, Mac, I'm open! Harding, give it back. Back to me, Harding! Here. I'm open. Will you give me the ball? - Stop dribbling the goddamn ball! - I got it! Harding, over here. Oh, for Christ's sake. I'm standing... - You were covered! - I was open! Just give me the ball. They're making all over the... I was open. Give me the ball. - You were covered, Mac. - I wasn't covered. Somebody get back! Give it to me! Give it to me! Chief! Atta baby, put it in! Get down there! Get down there, Chief! All right, all right. Get around, Chief! No, no, no. Get down there, Chief! The ball's in play! Ball's in play! - That's bullshit! - Ball's in play. Oh, fuck that shit! You've got to be crazy. Man, that doesn't go! That ball ain't in play! Come on, Chief! Put it in! What a ball club! McMurphy, get off the side. - Come on, move it, man! - Hey, damn it! Quick! Come on, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'll be seeing you on the outside. You know what I mean? By the time you get out of here... ...you'll be too old to even get it up. Sixty-eight days, buddy. Sixty-eight days. What the fuck you talking about, 68 days! That's in jail, sucker. You still don't know where you're at? Yeah, where am I at, Washington? With us, baby, you're with us. And you're going to stay with us until we let you go. Do you want to say something to the group, Mr. McMurphy? I'd like to know why none of the guys never told me that you... ...Miss Ratched... ...and the doctors could keep me here till you're good and ready to turn me loose. That's what I'd like to know. Fine, Randall, that's a good start. Would anyone care to answer Mr. McMurphy? Answer what? You heard me, Harding. You let me go on hassling Nurse Ratched here... ...knowing how much I had to lose and you never told me nothing! Now, Mac, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I didn't know anything about how much... - Shit! - Wait a minute. Listen. Now, look... I'm voluntary here, see? I'm not committed. I don't have to stay here. I mean, I can go home anytime I want. You can go home anytime you want? - That's it. - You're bullshitting me! He's bullshitting me, right? No, Randall, he's telling you the truth. As a matter of fact, there are very few men here who are committed. There's Mr. Bromden. Mr. Taber. Some of the chronics, and you. Cheswick? You're voluntary? Scanlon? Billy, for Christ's sake, you must be committed, right? No, no, no. You're just a young kid! What're you doing here? You ought to be out in a convertible... ...bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver. What are you doing here, for Christ's sake? What's so funny about that? Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing but complain about how you can't... ...stand it in this place, and then you haven't got the guts to walk out? What do you think you are, for Christ's sake? Crazy or something? Well, you're not. You're not! No crazier than the average asshole walking around on the streets. And that's it. Jesus Christ, I can't believe it! Those are very challenging observations you made, Randall. I'm sure some of the men would like to comment. Mr. Scanlon? I want to know why the dorm is locked in the daytime and on weekends. I would like to know about our cigarettes. May I have my cigarettes, please, Miss Ratched? You sit down, Mr. Cheswick, and wait your turn. Go ahead, sit down! To answer your question about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon. You know very well... ...that if we left the door open, you'd just go right back to bed after breakfast. Am I right? So what? May I have my cigarettes, please, Miss Ratched? Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick. Cigarettes are not important. Sit down, will you? For Christ's sake! Cigarettes! Remember, Mr. Scanlon, we've discussed many times... ...that time spent in the company of others is very therapeutic. While time spent brooding alone only increases a feeling of separation. You remember that, don't you? Do you mean to say... ...it's sick to want to be off by yourself? Miss Ratched? Mr. Cheswick, you sit down! - I want to know about... - Sit down, Mr. Cheswick. I want to... Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding? It's my last one. That's a fucking lie. Why don't you give him a cigarette? Look, I'm not running a charity ward, see? Come on! Look, I don't want his cigarettes. And I don't want his, or his, or his... ...or his, or his, or his... Or even yours. Do you understand that? I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched! I want my cigarettes! I want mine, Miss Ratched! What gives you the damn right... ...to keep our cigarettes piled up on your desk... ...and to squeeze out a pack only when you feel like it, huh? - Miss Ratched! - Mr. Harding! Oh, I'm sorry. - You surprise me. - I lost my head. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... I'm really very sorry. I just forgot. I didn't mean to. I'm really very sorry. I just forgot. It's all right. Miss Ratched! Yes, Mr. Cheswick? I asked you a question! I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick... ...and I will answer your question as soon as you've calmed down. Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick? - I'm calm. - Good. Now, as you all know, Mr. McMurphy... ...has been running a small gambling casino in our tub room. Now, most of you lost all your cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy... ...not to mention a tidy sum of money to Mr. McMurphy. And that's why... ...your tub room privileges have been suspended... ...and your cigarettes have been rationed. Mr. Martini? How are we going to win our money back? You're not going to win your money back, Mr. Martini. That's all over. If you had obeyed the rules in the first place... ...you wouldn't have lost your money. Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down, gentlemen! Sit down! Rules? Piss on your fucking rules, Miss Ratched! Sit down. Will you? I want you to know something right here and now! - I ain't no little kid! I ain't no little kid! - You sit down! What, are you going to have cigarettes kept from me like cookies? And I want something done! Ain't that right, Mac? That's right! Will you sit down? No, I won't! I won't! I want something done! - Sit down! - I want something done! I want something done! I want something done! I want something done! I want something done! - Here! - I want something done! Goddamn it, Cheswick, here! Hey, calm down! Why don't you leave him alone, Washington? He's going to be all right! Emergency 34-B. I'll break your fucking wrist! Forget it, Mac! It's all over, McMurphy! Warren! Would you move, please? We need this chair. Just move right over there, okay. I see we have Mr. Bromden back. Yeah, okay. - How do you do, Mr. McMurphy? - I do real fine. I know you didn't do anything wrong. Just sit. We're not going to hurt you. Sit down, here. That's it. Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick. He's a little upset. Okay, fine. Thank you very much. - You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick. - Yes. Would you keep an eye on these three? Would you please take these, gentlemen? He can't hear nothing. Calm down, Ches, will you? Mr. Cheswick, would you please follow me? Mr. Cheswick? - No! - Nobody's gonna hurt you, come on. - No! - It'll be all right. No one's going to hurt you. No, leave me alone! - Take it easy on yourself. Come on! - No! Mac! Mac! Mac! No! Come on. Come on, now. Come on. - Come on. - No! I didn't do nothing! Mac! - Come on. - I won't go! I don't want to go! Want some gum? Thank you. Juicy Fruit. You sly son of a bitch, Chief. Can you hear me, too? Yeah, you bet! Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief! And they all, they all think you're deaf and dumb. Jesus Christ! You fooled them, Chief. You fooled them. You fooled them all! Goddamn! What are we doing in here, Chief? What's us two guys doing in this fucking place? Let's get out of here. Out. Canada? Canada. We'll be there before these sons of bitches know what hit them. Listen to Randall on this one. Mr. McMurphy? Please follow me. You and me, Chief. Take a cigarette break, boys. Easy. I'll be fine. Would you sit up, please? - I'd love to. - Atta boy. There might be a little fluid in them boots, you know what I mean, boys? Just a little leak. A light shine, boys, and... ...send the specimen to Nurse Ratched. All right, out with your gum. Out with your gum. Okay, this won't hurt, and it'll be over in just a moment. - What's that? - Conductant. A little dab will do you. Right, Mr. Jackson? Open your mouth. - What's that? - This'll keep you from biting your tongue. Now just bite down on it. That's right. Just bite down. Now, bite down on it. Are you ready? Here we go. Now, one big breath. Very good. Gentlemen, I'd like to begin today. It shouldn't take too long. Jim? It's been brought to my attention... ...that you've been giving Mr. Fredrickson your medication. Is that true? No, ma'am. Jim? Are you giving your medication to Mr. Fredrickson... ...or are you not? How about it, you creeps, you lunatics, mental defectives. Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall, back in action. Nice shirt, Cheseroo. Look at the faces on you! Look at you! The feeb's brigade, you ding-a-lings! The mental defective league in formation. How are you, Nurse Ratched? I'm happy to be back. We're happy to have you back, Randall. Thank you. Would you like to rest today, or would you like to join the group? I'd love to join the group. I'd like... I'm proud to join the group, Mildred. How's it going, Mac? Perfect, Billy boy, absolutely perfect. They were giving me 10,000 watts a day, you know, and I'm... ...hot to trot. The next woman who takes me on will light up like a pinball machine... ...and pay off in silver dollars! That's an amusing thought, Randall... ...but when you came in we were talking to Jim. He has a problem with his medication... ...and we'd like to get back to that. Oh, I don't mind at all, Nurse Ratched, I'm... ...as gentle as a puppy dog. Please proceed. Thank you. The administration was hopeful, but cautious Friday in its reaction... ... to a possible opening of the Berlin Wall... ... during the upcoming Christmas holiday. Good night, gentlemen. See you in the morning. Yeah, baby, it's Mac. It's on tonight. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Get a car. I don't give a shit, baby. Steal it if you have to! I have to go! I have to go! Don't forget to bring some booze. Right. 'Bye. Chief, I can't take it no more. I have to get out of here. I can't. I just can't. It's easier than you think, Chief. For you, maybe. You're a lot bigger than me. Why, Chief, you're about as big as a goddamn tree trunk. My poppa's real big. He did like he pleased. That's why everybody worked on him. The last time I've seen my father he was blind in the cedars from drinking. And every time he put the bottle to his mouth... ...he don't suck out of it. It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so... ...wrinkled and yellow, even the dogs don't know him. Killed him, huh? I'm not saying they killed him. They just worked on him, the way they're working on you. There they are, Chief. There they are. They're here. Over here. That's it! McMurphy, stop all this holy roller shit... ...and get your ass back in bed. Do you understand? My prayers have been answered, Turkle. Come on and see. You'd take $20... ...to get down on your knees and pray, wouldn't you, Turkle? No, it don't send me, don't send me. - It don't? - Don't do nothing to me, no. Well, you know there'll be more. I mean, they'll be bringing a couple of bottles with them, and... You're getting closer, brother. You're getting closer, but... ...they're going to be sharing more than just bottles, ain't they? - You know what I mean? - Yeah, sure. - I know what you mean. - Understand what I mean? Yeah, I understand what you mean. - Anything you say. - I'm on my knees, brother. - I'm on my knees. - Yeah, all right, all right. I'll let them in. - Let me just give them a hand here. - I appreciate that. - Hi. - Ladies! Oh, thank you. I believe this is your department, Mr. Turkle. - Hi, there! Give me a hand. - How're you doing? Love to give you a hand. Keep it down. Keep it down. - I split my pants. - Keep it down! - Give it to me. Give it all to me. - You got to keep it down! This looks like my high school. Oh, hey, I take that. - The barber chair. - You may have it. It is mine, mine. You can have it. You can have it, honey. Get a load of these tubs. It's a real nice place you got here. Hey, can I take a bath? Sure, you can take a bath. Sure. Just don't drown your pretty little self. You know... ...Rose was married to a maniac once, up in Beaverton. Oh, really, miss? What seemed to be the problem? Oh, nothing, he used to put frogs in my bra all the time. Very interesting. Very interesting. Rose is very interested in hospitals, and hospital facilities. - I am? - Yes. Oh, yes, you are. - I'm going to take Miss Candy... - Where you going? I'm going to take Candy for a stroll. I got you, I got you. - But just don't make too much noise. - Oh, no, not a peep, not a peep. Now, you come over here, baby, right over here. Don't worry about Candy, honey. Sit down and relax. Wake up, boys. Wake up. It's medication time. Medication time. The nighttime spirits are here. It's Randall to say goodbye... ... and get you high, and nighttime angel, Candy. That's right, Mr. Martini, there is an Easter bunny. Around the side, join Mr. McMurphy... ... in the executive lounge, please. Around the side. It's going to be so great. You'd like a nip, Charles? No trouble at all! It's Billy the Club of the fabulous and fantastic... - What the hell's going on? - Mr. Turkle. Ain't this a bitch! McMurphy, what're you trying to do? Get my ass really fired? Come on, get your ass out of here. Come on. We're just having a party. Party, my ass! This ain't no nightclub, this is a hospital! Man, this is my fucking job! I don't give a damn, this is my fucking job! Oh, shit! The supervisor! Get your asses back in there. Come on. Come on there! Where's that no-talking son of a bitch? Is he in there? Good. Come on. Mr. Turkle? Mr. Turkle? Where the hell is he? Why doesn't he answer? He's jerking off somewhere. Ain't nobody jerking off nowhere, motherfucker! Turkle, what the fuck are you doing here? Go out and talk to her! Doing the same fucking thing you're doing in here, hiding! Yes, ma'am? Is everything all right, Mr. Turkle? Oh, everything is just fine, ma'am. Just fine. Just fine. Who's there? Ain't nobody in there. Please open that door. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ma'am, but... ...you know, a man gets awfully lonesome at night. You understand what I mean, don't you? You understand? I'm sure you understand. I want that woman off this ward immediately. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. - Jesus! - Mr. Turkle, is she gone? Shit! Yes, and so am I... ...so get your behinds out of here and go to bed. Go ahead, move it! Move it! - I knew we were in trouble! - Let's go! You and your teddy bear ass! Move them on out of here! Come on, come on! - Candy? - Come on, Candy! Jesus Christ! Mr. Turkle, I'm really sorry. Tell those fucking friends of mine to stay out! - Get out! - I'm really sorry. What are you... What the fuck? Get out of here! Please get out, this is my job! You're fucking it up! You understand? Get out! Get out of here, you slim motherfucker! Fuck it! Fuck it! Good night, good night, don't let the cooties bite. Right out of the shock department. I got it from... I got it from Ratched's charts. Right. There you go. Easy now. Don't take it all at once! Let's try a little over here. There you go. Let's go. I'll have to be the one, Chief. Hey, Mac, what's going on? Well, Dale... ...Lord Randall is stepping down one. Fredrickson. Jimmy. Aren't you going to say goodbye to me? Sure, I'm going to say goodbye to you, Charles. Thank you, Mac. Thank you. I'll never forget you. Settle down, Charles, all right. Hey, Billy, what's wrong? Billy, for Christ's sake? What's the matter? I'm going to miss you very... ...very much, Mac. Why don't you come with us, then? Think I don't want to? Well, come on then, let's go. Well, it's not that easy. I'm not ready yet. Tell you what we'll do... When I get to Canada, I'll write you a postcard... ...and I'll put my address on it. That way when you're ready, you'll... ...you'll know where to go. What do you say? Is she going with you? Candy? Yeah, she'll be there when you get there. She's going with us. Are you going to marry her? No, we're just good friends. Why? Nothing. Don't ""nothing"" me, all right? What is it? It's too late. Do you want a date with her? Jesus, I must be crazy to be in a looney bin like this! Date, huh? Well, it'll have to be a fast date, I'll tell you that. Not now! Not now? When, then? When I have a free weekend. You're busy right now, are you? You have something to do right now? - You have something to do? - No. Good, then don't talk to me about when you're ready. Yeah. - Ready and everything like that. - No. Candy, come here a minute. I want you to meet the famous Billy. Go get him, will you? Go get him. Get him out of there. I want you to get a hold of Billy... All you have to do is one little thing. - The kid is cute, isn't he? - Yeah. Think of me the whole time. There he is. Billy the Club! I got $25... ...that says you are going to burn this woman down! Candy, baby... ...I love you. Hurl the ringer. Take it easy! Back! No, I'll show you some card tricks. You ain't seen the Spanish deck yet. That's 40 percent more torture. I'm going to present you with this fine deck of cards for playing. This ain't going to take long, Rose, you know what I mean? When we get to Canada... Out of sight, man! Out of sight! - Good morning, Miss Ratched. - Good morning. Mr. Warren... ...close the window, and lock the screen. Right. Mr. Miller, show this woman the way out of the hospital. Gladly. Come on, lady, let's go. - You're going home. - Where? Let her go, Scanlon. You're going home. - Mr. Washington? - Yes. Make sure no one is missing. Will do. - Mac? - Come on, Scanlon, let's move. Everybody, out of here! Move it out! Come on, move it! Martini, get your butt up! Come on, up! All right, get your dead ass up there! What the hell's going on here? Come on, move out! Miss Ratched? What are you doing? Where you going? Back out here! Let's go! Come on, move it! Taber, get up. Come on. I said, get up! All right, move it back there! Get your ass over here, and bring Dracula with you. Move it. Stay right there, Bancini! - Miss Ratched? - Yes. It looks like Billy is the only one missing. Billy? - Thank you, Mr. Washington. - Okay. Did Billy Bibbit leave the grounds of the hospital, gentlemen? I want an answer to my question! Did he leave the grounds of the hospital? - Mr. Washington? - Yes. Miss Pilbow, check all the rooms. - Mr. Warren? - Yes. You start with the tub room. Mr. Martini? May I have my cap, please? My cap! My cap! There. Thank you. Miss Ratched. I can explain everything. Please do, Billy. Explain everything. Everything? Aren't you ashamed? No, I'm not. You know, Billy, what worries me is... ...how your mother's going to take this. Well, you... ...don't have to tell her, Miss Ratched. I don't have to tell her? Your mother and I are old friends, you know that. Please don't... ...tell my mother. Don't you think you should've thought of that before you took that woman... ...in that room? No, no. I didn't. You mean, she dragged you in there by force? She did. Everybody did. Everybody? Who did? You tell me who did! McMurphy. Miss Ratched... ...please don't... ...tell my mother, please. Would you see that the men are washed and ready for the day? Miss Ratched, please, please... - Mr. Washington? - Yes? - Put Billy in Dr. Spivey's office. - No. Stay with him till the doctor arrives. Move it! Come on, Martini, get on! Hey, that way, please. Please, gentlemen. Let's go, come on. Come on, you guys. What is this? Let's go. Hey, what the hell is that? McMurphy, what the hell are you doing? Washington, to the day room! Immediately! Put down those keys and nobody gets hurt. Move away from the window and take that damn Chief with you. Come on, let's go! Let me through! Let me through! Out of the way, McMurphy! Come on, clear it! Get these people out of here! Oh, Billy! Will you guys clear the door? Everybody out! Out! Everybody out! Come on, goddamn it! Now calm down! The best thing we can do is go on with our daily routine. All right? Don't! Mac! Mac! No! And the bets are placed. There's one for Tabes, and Chessy, and Martini, and the dealer. And a four to Tabes, and a six, and a nine... ...and a ten to the dealer. A nine? What do you say, Tabes? A dime apiece. No? You stick. - He sticks. - He sticks with a four. Chessy's going for the ride. What does that mean? He wants a hit. Yeah, and a big queen. I think you're busted. Buggered, not busted. - Turn them over. - Buggered. And weep. Hit me. I think you're over. - I know you're over. - Hovno. That's a three. Hovno. Mr. Sefelt? Did everything go well? That's very nice. Now you feel better, don't you? Yes, ma'am. Deuce to the dealer. Split them. Higher. McMurphy is out. McMurphy has escaped. They were taking him through the tunnel. He beat up two of the attendants and escaped. McMurphy is upstairs. Oh, no, no! Jim, I'm telling you, McMurphy is upstairs... ...and he's as meek as a lamb. Really? I mean, how do you know? Jack Dunphy told me. Jack Dunphy is full of shit! Right! Right! They said you escaped. I knew you wouldn't leave without me. I was waiting for you. Now we can make it, Mac. I feel big as a damn mountain. Oh, no! I'm not going without you, Mac. I wouldn't leave you here this way. You're coming with me. Let's go! Subtitles conformed by SOFTITLER, Where are you headed, little lady? Nowhere with you, numb-nuts. Buzz off! See you Thursday, you gorgeous thing. You picked a beautiful day to hitchhike. Well, I've got a nice little VW back at Stenson's Beach with a cracked block. You guys wouldn't be going up to Mill Valley, would you? Andy, aren't we going up to Mill Valley? I got a couple of bottles of ice-cold beer up there, if you're interested. You son of a bitch. Okay, pile in. How long you been in the Western Gas and Electric Company business? I can't remember how long I've been in it. How long have I been in it? Turn in, right here. Climb up this road here. Yeah, I'll be right with you. Better hang a left here, Harry. There's a jam up on Bay. What's with the citizen? Police officer, what's the problem? Thank God. He's inside. Come on, it's a heart attack. Wait here. Make some room, please. Please, move aside. Please, move aside. This is an emergency. Excuse us. Would you please move over. Would you please give us room. He's a police officer. - Police? Where's the ambulance? - This poor man's had a heart attack. I think he's still breathing, though. Come on, get up. - Get up. Come on. - What are you doing? I say. - Party's over. - Thanks a lot, Harry. What are you squawking about? You got the free meal, didn't you? Yeah, but I always enjoy the ride in the ambulance. Get out of here. All units, be advised that this is a 406. Harry, it's an ''all units.'' Marvelous. My old lady's gonna kill me. She's doing a nine-church novena tonight and I told her I'd be home early for supper. Suspects are armed. Code 33. Code 33. Inspector 71 responding to your 406. What's going on? A couple of bastards held up that liquor store. One of our guys stumbled in on it and they shot him up. They grabbed four hostages. They said they'll start shooting them one by one unless we give them a car. Then what are you waiting on? Lieutenant Brannigan of Robbery. He said to stall them until he gets here. - God, don't let him kill me. - We want the goddamn car, right now. All right. But you don't get anything till I come in and talk. All right, you bastard, lay your piece on the hood of that car. What about me? I'm your partner. I may have to move fast and I don't need too much linguini to hold me back. You got a lot of class, Harry. You get cute, I blow this nice lady all over you. Let's go. On the floor, motherfucker. For God's sakes, mister, do like he says! This is my best sports jacket. I said, get your ass on the floor, you dirty son of a bitch! Spread eagle. Move it! Get down there. San Francisco's finest. Mitch. Roll him over. He's clean. Here's the story. First, we want all the pigs out of here. Second, we want a car... ...with a police radio. Deliver it right out there in front. We're taking two hostages: Both the women. If you don't do exactly what I tell you, we blow their fucking heads off! - You got the picture? - Yeah. What are you waiting for? Run, you jive-ass bastard. - What do they want? - They want a car. What are you going to do? Give them one. You son of a bitch! Tell me, what makes a man crazy enough to join the cops? If you find out, you let me know, huh? - How can that be? - You want an itemized account? You took out two front doors, one front window, 12 feet of counter. Plus damages to the stock. Plus one city vehicle totaled. As well as three hostages in the hospital, all of whom will probably sue the city. - For what? - Excessive use of force. For your information, Callahan... ...the minority community has just about had it with this kind of police work. By the ''minority community,'' you're talking about the hoods? It so happens that they are American citizens, too. What about the lady with the shotgun in her ear? I'm not going to debate this with you. I've been on the phone to the Mayor twice this morning. He went right through the ceiling over this. Did you tell him about the meeting? - What meeting? - The meeting right here, two months ago... ...when you said high priority was: ''Run these hoods out of here.'' I never said to use violence. What should I do, yell ''trick-or-treat'' at them? Come on, Harry. I expect you, and every other man on this force... ...to behave with restraint or turn in his resignation. You're on notice, Callahan. This little show of yours yesterday is exactly the kind of thing... ...this department is no longer prepared to tolerate! Is that clear? Yes, sir. - If that's all, Captain, I've got work to do. - But not in Homicide. What? You've been transferred to Personnel. To Personnel? That's for assholes. I was in Personnel for 10 years. Yeah. That's it. You report tomorrow to the Oral Examining Board. 9:00, on the dot. No, you haven't got the picture. I'm the robber, you're the cop. Now, I'm in a market, see? And you've just caught me, dead bang. A 211 in the act. But I'm coming out, and I've got a hostage. A kid with a gun at his head. There's no way you're gonna take me alive. You've 10 seconds to make up your mind, ''Here I come.'' What are you gonna do? One... ...two, three... - You're under arrest. ...four, five... - Do something! ...six, seven... - How tall is he? Don't just stand there, goddamn it, do something! Bang, you're dead. - You're late, Callahan. - Sorry about that. - Hello, Krause. - Hi. All right, Bustanoby, you'll be notified of your grade. You were told to be here at 9:00. We have 50 officers out there to test. - For how many vacancies? - Eight. There will be five men and three women promoted to inspector out of this group. - Three women? - Do you object, Inspector? Now, who might you be? This is Mrs. Grey of the Mayor's staff. She's here to monitor these examinations. This is Inspector Callahan. Yes, I know something of Inspector Callahan. And I'd like to tell you... ...it's the Mayor's plan that the department be brought more into line with... ...the mainstream of 20th century thought. How does he figure to do that? For one thing... ...his Honor intends... ...to broaden the areas of participation for women in the police force. Well, that sounds very stylish. I think he also said something about: ''Winnowing the Neanderthals out of the department.'' Well, I guess we better get on with it. Next applicant. - Officer Moore? - Yes, sir. As you know, this is the final stage in your examination. It's an informal test to try and get an idea of your ability to think on your feet. Your reaction to stress and pressure. Your ability to apply the law in a hypothetical situation and so on, okay? Yes, sir. How long have you been on the force? - Nine years. - What department? Mainly Personnel and Records. - Personnel and Records? - Yes, sir. Have you any questions for the applicant? Questions? How fast do you run the 100? Come on, Callahan, you know how this board functions. All right, I'm sorry. You know that... ...if you make inspector under the Mayor's new guidelines... ...you might just be out riding in a police car? Yes, sir, that's what I'm hoping for. Officer Moore, maybe you'll tell us... ...about your most important felony arrest. I've never made a felony arrest. Well, maybe you'll tell us about your best misdemeanor arrest, then. I've never made a misdemeanor arrest either. Then what the hell gives you the right to become an inspector... ...when some men have been on the street for 10 or 15 years? ''The woman's place is in the home.'' Is that what you're trying to say? Do you think this is an encounter group? I want to know what she'll do when someone points a gun at her... ...and says, ''Hit the deck! '' You're just deliberately trying to fail this candidate, aren't you? Well, if she fails out there, she gets her ass blown off. It's my ass! And my hard luck. Except, out there you'll have a partner. If you get blown away, he gets blown away with you. And that's a hell of a price to pay for being stylish. Are you finished with the questioning? Hypothetical situation, huh? I'm standing on the street corner... ...and Mrs. Grey there comes up and propositions me. She says, if I come home with her for $5, she'll put on a show... ...with a Shetland pony. - If this is your idea of humor, Inspector... All right, what are you trying to do here, Callahan? I'm trying to find out if anybody here knows what law is being broken... ...besides cruelty to animals. That's a conspiracy, under Title 7, Section 182... ...Paragraph 1 of the California State Penal Code. A conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is a felony... ...and according to People vs. Bashor in... - Yes, that's right, good answer. Thank you, Officer Moore, you'll be notified of your grade. After I take care of the guard and get his keys... ...we drive to the far end of warehouse 50A. Lalo? All right, now that's... I drop you off at that end, at that small door, then I drive around... ...to the wharf side of the warehouse. You open up that first big door... ...I drive it in and back up to the first compound on the right. Karl and Tex? Hey, man, we grab the M-16 automatic rifles, right? Wanda? Locate and take any explosives. Dynamite, detonators, and any plastics. Right. Henry Lee? I tote and I load all the ammo for the M-16s, okay, man? Miki? Locate the Law rockets. They should be somewhere in the back of the compound. That's the most important item. Tex, are you sure of their location? Hey, I sweated in that place for five years. They're there, I promise. All right, you guys. - This is for the people. - Right on, ''for the people.'' Jesus, spare me. - What is it? - Gas Company. - What's the trouble? - We've a gas leak in the area. We got to check out your underground pipes. For pete's sake, don't smoke until we tell you it's okay. I won't. It's seeping down into your sewer system. This whole damn block could go! - You got a phone I could use? - Yeah, right this way. Let's go. Charlie left the gate open. Better check it. Tony, call a backup. - I'm going to check around. - Frank, watch yourself. Law's rocket! - Beautiful. - Yes. Lalo, get the rest of these loaded. You'll blow us out of here. Be quiet. Are you all right? Let us get these. Freeze. All of you, hold it right there! Put those boxes down. You, back there, stand up where I can see you. And drop that gun. Put your hands over your head and freeze! - Now, just wait a second, mister. - Now you shut up and listen. You just blink an eyelid and I'll mail you home to Mama in a box. Now, all of you, against the fence! Now! You, too, honey! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God. Jesus! Oh, baby, it's all right, I'll get you out. I'll get you home. Bobby, help me. Help me get her up. - You're going to get us caught. - No, we'll make it. - She's dead. - She's not dead! The hell she isn't! Come on, it's over. Get it on there. Lalo, get up in there. Come on. Halt, police! Halt or I'll fire! I'm gonna get this son of a bitch. Goddamn it! Well, he said it looked like a regular Gas Company truck. I'm checking with the Marin County Sheriff's Department. Might tie in with those two bodies they found up there last week. Yes, sir. How's DiGeorgio? Well, Irene is in there with him now. Is that supposed to be some kind of answer? Harry, he's just been given the last rites. - Get what you can, huh? - I will. - Listen, I'm sorry. - I know. Hello, Harry. He's been asking for you. How is he? He's in and out. I'll smoke a cigarette. It's a war, isn't it? I guess I never really understood that. Frank, what happened? I had them dead bang. And then I... Sorry. There's something you wanted to tell Harry. Harry, listen, the punk who cut me... ...l've seen him before. Where? I just can't make the name. Well, where do you know him from, Frank? That homicide, remember? The old hooker... ...up on Filmore district. The summer of '71? What about it? Well, he was one of the pimps we questioned. We liked him for it, Harry. We liked him real good. As I recall, we liked everybody north of Market Street on that one. He had one of those cutesy-pie little boy names: Charlie or something, or Bobby. I'll check Records, they should have your notes. Ten-to-one they blow it. Not this time, Frank. Maybe you better get some rest, huh? Do you have to go just yet? Not if you don't want me to. Thanks, Harry. Get Irene. - Did you talk to Records? - No, not yet. That was McKay. We just got a tape from those bastards. I'll see you in my office in 30 minutes. Code Blue, intensive care. Thirty minutes. We want $1 million or we start blowing things up. The People's Revolutionary Strike Force. Remember Fessenheim. Fessenheim? It's being checked. This Revolutionary Strike Force, are they on your list? Nothing. - Think it's legitimate? - Probably not. This is Lieutenant Bressler in Homicide. Well, what are you doing about those records? What's happening? What do you mean, ''what records''? I talked to you about them half an hour ago. Homicide. Filmore district. Inspectors Callahan and DiGeorgio. What are you talking about, a written request? Well, who's got the keys? Look. I'm coming down there in five minutes... ...and you better have those files open, you pencil-pushing son of a bitch! You don't have to make threats. I'm telling you, I'm going to nail the guy... ...who carved DiGeorgio if I have to do it on my own time. That won't be necessary. You've been back in Homicide since 9:00 this morning, didn't you know? No. I've been down in Records looking up an old homicide. Any luck? Well, I've got 11 names here of known pimps. - I think our man is one of them. - Judson, Maddox, Skidmore. Shall I tell you my instinct on this? - Black militants. - No, it keeps coming up hookers. The girl who was shot in the warehouse is Miki Waleska. She was a known prostitute. What we've got here is a well-organized group of militants... ...with enough explosives to blow half of San Francisco away, including... ...Law's rockets! - Law's rockets? - Yeah. The Army's giving us a demonstration at the firing range... ...in exactly 35 minutes. I'd like everyone connected with the case to be there. I want you to know what you're up against. I've too much to do. Besides, I've already been checked out on a Law's rocket. Your partner hasn't. My partner? Shit! You know Inspector Moore? Inspector. I'll see you both out at the firing range. Inspector? Listen, Inspector, I realize that you are not particularly happy by this assignment. - You don't think I'm up to it, do you? - Right. All right... ...I would like to get one thing straight, and that is the fact I'm a woman. I consider that fact absolutely irrelevant from now on... ...because I will not accept, nor do I expect, any special consideration. Marvelous. The Law's rocket, for all intents and purposes... ...a one-shot, throwaway, disposable bazooka. It is a fiberglass tube, 45 inches long... ...3 inches in diameter, which fires a single projectile... ...designed to penetrate armor plating up to the thickness 3/4 of an inch. If you've all had a good look at the rocket, I'll demonstrate how it works. To fire the rocket, you first pull this pin... ...dropping the rear cover... ...then pull. Your front sight, your rear sight spring up... I got word from Pathology... ...at noon they're posting that guard that was killed last night. - Check on it. - I'll be there. Captain? Go ahead. Gentlemen, if you'll keep your eyes on that half-track... ...l'll demonstrate how effective this weapon can be. Coming, Inspector? - Inspector? - Yeah? - 13.5 in my gym shorts. - What? My time in the 100. You asked me at the Orals Board. - You think I was picking on you? - Yes. It was nothing personal. Right. I don't think you know what we do for a living in Homicide. I'll find out. I hope you don't find out the hard way. How fast do you run the 100, Inspector? Beats me. I meant to tell you how sorry I am about your partner. He's not the first one I've lost. I know, Fanducci in '68 and Smith in '72, but it wasn't your fault. - How'd you know that? - I checked on your records. I don't want to get killed anymore than you do. What's the matter? The Black guy with the briefcase. I know him from somewhere. - Tan suit? - Yeah. What did he do? Can't remember. It's not important. - Tell me, ever been to one of these before? - No. In that case, I'd like to suggest that you sit out here. Please don't concern yourself, Inspector. - Hello, Harry. - Hi. Who's the pretty lady? That's my partner, Inspector Moore. You've missed most of it. We got hung up on a firing range. I've got it on tape for you. We've just finished the abdominal cavity. I'm interested in the wound. The entry wound was above the right renal area... ...between the ninth and tenth rib, penetrating up into the chest cavity... ...perforating the right lung. There was also damage to some of the other vital organs... ...pancreas, kidneys, etcetera. - What kind of a knife was it? - A long heavy blade. We're going into the skull now. I'd say, an educated guess, it was one of those killing knives: A Marine Corps Boy, or one of those Special Forces' Randalls. Any bruises about the face? Indications that the killer clamped his left hand over the mouth, from behind. - Professional? - Textbook. On first examination, no exterior damage to the skull. Subject brain shows no contrecoup- type damage or blood clotting. Jesus H. Christ, Harry, come here and look at this! - It's the damnedest thing I ever saw. - What's that? What it says: ''Eat at Luigi's! '' Welcome to Homicide. What are you doing? Come here. Excuse me, I'm with him. I was coming down the hall to take a leak when this whole thing blew. Anybody in there? - No, I don't think so. - Where are you going? I got a group of kids, some of them are missing. - Help him out. - Me? Great. Just step out here, will you? Well, we were lucky this time. It's getting so that you can't even go to the can in peace. - We've got them all, they're okay. - Good. You didn't see anybody go in there before the explosion, did you? No. You sure? Black guy with a tan hat and suit, briefcase. I did see a guy like that. Was he a short guy, about 5-foot-1? No, this dude was 6 foot. That's him. It was a bomb, I think I saw who did it. - Any idea who it was? - He looked familiar... - Inspector? - Just a minute. - You better check the mug shots. - Inspector? Honey, do you mind, we're talking. This is very important. Now, you better check the mug shots, we just got another message. They're asking for $2 million now. - $2 million? - I just saw him. - Who? - Tan suit and a hat and a briefcase. - Where? - Right down here. - Why the hell didn't you tell me? - Why the hell didn't you ask me? There he is, look! Jesus! Damn it. What the hell's going on here? What are you doing here? - Who are you? - Police officer. All right, speedy, you're under arrest. In the name of God, man, this is a church. What are you doing? I'm a police officer, this man's under arrest. Father, help me, I wasn't doing a thing. This guy is just rousting me. Would it be asking too much to see some credentials, Officer? This guy runs like a rabbit. I'm not about to let him go. I'd like to see the credentials, right now. If you insist. - Callahan, Inspector. - Well, Callahan... ...I think you're a disgrace to this city. Okay. Nobody move! Marvelous. Yes, I think so. Harry, wait a minute, I'm just talking to... Jesus Christ! Give him my best. I'll call you back. Don't worry, it's been disarmed by the bomb squad. But it's definitely the explosive out of the Hamilton Firearms works. There are times when I can only stand you as a human being. What about the punk? - You mean the suspect. - Suspect, my ass. He isn't talking, but we've got a make on him. His name is Henry Lee Caldwell. And he is a member of a Black militant group called Uhuru. - Pusseau, shelve that. - Uhuru? It's run by a guy called Big Ed Mustapha. Mustapha, down the Mission district. I thought that guy looked familiar. Where's my partner? She's in the can. She's been in there ever since she found out... ...that she was packing this thing, in that briefcase, all over San Francisco. Harry, do me a favor. Go easy on her, huh? It's her first day and it's been a damn long one. If she wants to play lumberjack, she's got to learn to handle her end of the log. Okay, I give up, what's this? This is the Filmore chapter of the VFW: Very Few Whites. I don't suppose it would do any good to suggest you wait in the car? Don't concern yourself, Inspector. Well, if it ain't the mighty whitey and friend. I'm looking for Big Ed Mustapha. Sorry, honkie, she can stay, but you've got to go. Yeah, baby, we're trying to keep up the standards, you understand. - You're not making us feel too welcome. - You're welcome. You're about as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool. Well, lookie here, if it ain't the fuzz. I'm looking for Ed Mustapha. - You hold some kind of warrant, honkie? - What I'm holding is Henry Lee Caldwell. I've never heard of him. Let's see how fast you and the lady fuzz can get your white asses out of here. What is Henry Lee into now? He's been playing with dynamite. Are you Mustapha? Yeah, that's right. Why don't you just come into my office here. Just you. Don't worry, pig, we'll see she don't get lonesome. Well, that's mighty white of you. Now, gentlemen, before anybody does anything uncalled for... ...l'd like to take this chance to point out I am a police officer... ...and if you touch me with intent to do bodily harm... Sit down, Callahan. Where do I know you from? You don't. I just know you. Now, what's Henry Lee been up to? You telling me you don't know? He don't come around here, not for a long time. Where is he? He went white. Why, did he do something else foolish? He and his friends were involved in a ripoff at the Hamilton Firearms. I heard about that. Would you like to buy into that? Four counts of murder, aiding and abetting. You got the wrong number, boy. We don't deal in violence. What do you deal in? Waiting. For what? Waiting for all you white honkies... ...to blow each other up so we can move right on in. Tell me about Henry Lee and these friends of his. Some paddy-dudes he met in Vietnam. Why? Anybody on this list here grab you? Hey, man, why should I want to help you? If you don't, I have to talk to Robbery. They might be interested... ...in these elaborate furnishings. What are you talking about? Room 401, Fairmont. ''Rest easy at the Holiday Inn.'' Okay, so? Maybe they're a little warm. I'll tell you what: One of my boys got busted on a possession charge. Now, you get him off and forget about my interior decorator... ...and I'll see what I can do. That's asking a lot. You want a lot. A thing like this can ruin my image. I'll see what I can do. What about the list? Bobby Maxwell. He's the main man. You know him? Stone waste of white. Where can I find him? I'll check around. You do that. Much obliged. Callahan, you're on the wrong side. How do you figure that? You go and put your ass on the line... ...for a bunch of dudes who wouldn't even let you in the front door anymore... ...than they would me. - I'm not doing it for them. - Who, then? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - If it becomes necessary to pull this piece... - Having fun, Inspector? If you're through socializing, we do have work to do. Son of a bitch. If you have some sort of objection to the way I handled myself... ...I wish you'd just say so. I thought I was doing all right. Marvelous. All right, Mustapha... ... this is Captain McKay of the San Francisco Police Department. I'm ordering you to throw down your weapons and come out peacefully. You are totally surrounded. Mustapha, do you hear me? Come out with your hands raised over your heads. I don't want to seem ungrateful, Your Honor... ...I just feel that it might be a better idea. Well, I'm still a little confused. Now, you and the SWAT team made the arrest... ...but you want the credit to go to Inspectors Moore and Callahan? Your Honor, I just felt it might be a better tactic... ...politically, what with the election coming up soon. To show how your new guidelines for women in the police have worked. Sort of an I-told-you-so situation, if you know what I mean, sir. Yes, I see. It's an excellent idea. What do you think, Jimmy? Yes, sir, I couldn't agree more. You have proved to be quite an asset... ...to the department and to this administration. Thank you, sir. Mr. Mayor, the presentation of the commendation starts in five minutes. - I think we'd better get going, sir. - Thank you, Jimmy. Captain, off the record, there are going to be changes... ...in the department after the election, and you'll figure greatly in my plans. I'm sure you'll make the right decision, sir. Do you have any comments on the arrest of the Black militants yesterday? Later, Jim, later. Now, as Mayor of San Francisco, I want to make it official. This is one hell of a cop. And here come a couple more. Good morning, right this way. Lieutenant Bressler, Inspector Moore, would you move toward the stairs. Mr. Mayor, would you join them. We're gonna have some photographs taken here. - Is this all right, Mayor? - Yes. Would you kindly move in just a little tighter. Here we are, gentlemen, the two inspectors who made the Mustapha arrest. This is Inspector Moore and Callahan. How about one with the Mayor and Inspector Moore? Captain McKay, can you switch places with Inspector Moore? Move in, nice and close. And, Callahan, you get in there, too! We're ready. Inspector Moore is one of the first of her sex in the whole country... ...to become a full-time homicide investigator. And we're very proud of her stunning professionalism. Thank you very much. Jimmy, do you want to... Let me have some time with these people. Certainly. Could we move off to the right. We'll see each other at the conference. Now, anybody here have the letters of commendation? - Jimmy? - Yes, sir? - Who's got the letters? - Right here, sir. - Wait a minute, what's this? - These are some form letters. They'll do, just so you hand them something for the cameras. Well, all right. Thank you, Jimmy. The Mayor will introduce you, hand you your letters of commendation... ...and then you'll each move off to the left, out of camera. And then I'm going to take this opportunity... ...to deliver a few boots in the rear... ...to those people who think the police department has gone to hell... ...under this administration. Two minutes, Mr. Mayor. Well, ready? Let's go. - Just one minute, Mr. Mayor. - Harry! Would you mind telling me what these commendations are for? - This can wait until after the broadcast. - No, it can't. All right, just watch it, Callahan. The Inspector has a right to know what he's being commended for. Specifically, it's for your part in smashing the group of terrorists... ...who were trying to blackmail San Francisco out of $2 million. Let's look at the... If you're talking about the Mustapha bust, nobody smashed anything. What? I made a deal with him. He was to help me find out who the people were. - Inspector Moore and I weren't even there. - What is he talking about? - No weapons or explosives were found. - We'll find them. The people are still out there. They'll blow hell out of half this city. Meanwhile, you're telling everyone how great we are. Button your lip. That's an order. If you want to jerk these people off you can, but don't do it with me. Callahan, you just got yourself a 60-day suspension. Make it 90. 180. Give me your star. Here's a seven-point suppository, Captain. What did you say? I said stick it in your ass. - Mr. Mayor, you're on. - I know, Jimmy, I know. I'll have to go down there and... Go down there and jerk them off. Inspector Callahan. Damn it, Harry, slow down. What's the matter? Nothing. Why aren't you up there getting your commendation? You don't give up, do you? Sometimes. Not you. What makes you think so? A woman's intuition. Listen. Harry, if you need anything or if there's anything I can do... ...access to records or files... ...anything, call me up. I might just do that. Fine. Anytime. Come on, take a walk. All right. I was wondering if I'll still have a job when I get back there. What difference does it make? What do you want to be a cop for, anyway? Why aren't you married and having kids like everybody else? Why aren't you? Nobody in their right mind's asking. Coitis interruptus. I beg your pardon? Coit Tower, it's vaguely phallic, don't you think? I never thought of it that way. I make up names for things. For instance, you're ""Cold, bold Callahan with his great big.44."" Every other cop in this city is satisfied with a.38 or a 357. What do you have to carry that cannon for? So I can hit what I aim at, that's why. A 357 is a good weapon, but I've seen.38s... ...careen off windshields. No good in a city like this. I see, so it's for the penetration? Does everything have a sexual connotation with you? Only sometimes. Want to go have a few beers? You've got a lot of nerve the way you talk to the Mayor. And McKay. Besides being wrong, they're stupid. They arrested the wrong guy, but their egos won't let them admit it. - You mean Mustapha? - Yeah. I had a deal with Mustapha. He put me on to Bobby Maxwell, the guy who knifed DiGeorgio, I'm sure of it. Where can we find Maxwell? We can't, now with Mustapha busted, can we? Maxwell's a prime candidate, he's a real tough cookie. He was in Vietnam, likes combat. He was finally busted out of the service on a Section 8. Well, we're good citizens, why don't we post Mustapha's bail? Not a bad idea. Big question is: Will he work with us now? Want to have a couple of beers? Why didn't I think of that? Only thing they had worth drinking was apple juice. - Anything's okay. - Here. I'm sorry. You like fishing? I have an Auntie Kate, I'm called after her. When I was a little girl, she had a ranch up in Oroville. We used to fish together, I'd even bait my own hooks. Is that what they call you, Kate? That or Inspector Moore. Well, Inspector Moore, I don't like to get too friendly with partners. I know. I mean I understand. Kate... ...you know whoever draws you as a partner could do a lot worse. Mr. Mayor, I think if we want to beat the crowd, we should leave now. You think so? You may be right. I'll see you, Karl. You don't have to come back to the office. - Take over, fellas. - Take it easy. - You hold onto this. - Sure thing. - Nice to see you. - We are running a little late, sir. - Please, come on, sir. - How you doing? All right, talk to me. He's on his way. Beautiful. - Everything set? - I'm ready. Hi there. Well, hello there, young lady. What can I do for you? Raise the bridge. Raise the bridge? Are you kidding? When I tell you to. I wish we could've stayed. I think the Giants are gonna finally win one. I don't know, Mr. Mayor, looks like it could end up as a no-hitter. Besides, you do have a testimonial this evening. God, testimonials. They never end, do they? Give me the Taser gun. Karl. Man, this thing looks like something from a James Bond movie. Sure it'll work? Karl, there's 25,000 volts in this thing. Even the fat boy's gonna do what we want once we hook him up to it. Okay, Tex. Raise it. What the hell! Dave, get me out of this. Don't hit the Mayor, goddamn it! Who the hell are you? What do you want? You. Get away from me, you son of a bitch! I'm not going anywhere with you. The hell you aren't! We're still trying to get details and as they come in we'll get them to you. - Somebody said the Mayor was killed. - That was the first report. Then we heard he was kidnapped. There's something heavy going on in China Basin, that's for sure. Okay, listen, I've got to go. Thanks for calling. You're rapping with Bubba, go ahead. The Mayor of this pig city has been taken prisoner of war... ...by the People's Revolutionary Strike Force. Everybody's a comedian tonight. Look, this is very serious. Hey, man, look... ...l'm leaving a tape of our demands in the booth across the street. Power to the people! Okay, we're gonna do a little music and I'll be right back. Harry? - What can I do for you? - We've got to talk. Go right ahead. I want all the information that you have on this case, Callahan. - Black militants, remember? - Come on, Harry, so we were wrong. - I'll handle this one. - No. We play as a team. As I remember, the last time we played as a team I got the cue stuck in my ass. Harry, we just got a tape, this time they're asking for $5 million. Or they send back the Mayor, one piece at a time. The negotiations are at a crucial point right now. What are you going to do, pay the bastards? Well, the Mayor's family is loaded, they can afford it. What about the people who were killed? Or isn't it against the law anymore? We're not debating the point, I'm simply saying you're out of it. What you're saying is: Whoever's got balls to grab a hostage, will do it. And can walk away from it. I'm saying, you're out of it. If I hear otherwise, you're finished as a cop in San Francisco. I want every bit of information you have on this case, every lead. Is that clear? - May I make a statement, McKay? - Go ahead! Your mouthwash ain't making it! You got any more surprises for me today? What do you mean? I mean, are you and McKay going to throw... ...another one of those paddy-wagon parties for me? That frigging McKay, he's something, isn't he? Now, I want a line on this Revolutionary Strike Force. You got to be kidding. No, I'm not kidding. If you don't give it to me, I'll let it out that you're an ear. Don't say that, not even joking. Who's joking? You really are a dirty bastard, ain't you, Harry? The dirtiest. Word has it that Bobby Maxwell and this... ...chick, Wanda... ...they're running around with these dudes who call themselves... ...the People's Revolutionary Strike Force. ""Call themselves."" They don't believe in that shit. They're just interested in the bread, that's where their head's at. Where do I find this Wanda? She's a tall brunette, works at Tiffany's on Broadway. Thanks. Do them in. You can count on that. Hi there. - Is this Tiffany's? - Like the sign says. My name is Larry Dickman... ...my brother was here last week. Tall fella, balding. Remember him well. Has a gold tooth right in front. That's him. You know what I bet you'd like. I bet you'd like to learn the love tussle. That sounds swell, but I was looking for a certain girl. We've got a whole bunch of them, warm and willing. - Her name's Wanda. - Anybody you want. My brother says she's terrific. Can I trust you? Yeah. What it is, is $75. Of course, that includes... We're not supposed to do this, you understand, because the heat is on... ...but seeing your brother was here... ...the $75 includes personal instructions... ...in 32 positions of lovemaking. That many? $75, you pay me first. Oh, yeah. Right this way. What's this? You've heard of a tackling dummy, well, it's the same principle. I see, for $75 you get to make it with a rubber dolly. Thirty-two ways! Any objections? No, is there one where the man gets on top? Thirty-three! Just take your duds off, honey. I'll send your teacher in. Hi there. You're not Wanda. Well, these are the breaks. Needs air. Can't hump a limp dummy, I always say. Speaking of limp dummies, hadn't you better strip? Where's Wanda? Beats the hell out of me, Tom. Now, I'm gonna ask you just one last time. - Where's Wanda? - I don't know. She left here a couple of weeks ago. Ask Buchinsky. He runs the whole damn street. - Where do I find this Buchinsky? - Down the hall, to the right. That's right, my friends, nearer my God to thee. That's why brother Bob is here. Brother Bob is here to bring you nearer to the Lord. To bring you nearer to the man. To save your soul. Salvation is where it is at, brother. You're trespassing. This is private property. - You a lawyer? - Seeing as you ask, yes, I am. I'm looking for a tall brunette, named Wanda. I want to tell you something, punk. This is a protected operation. Now, you can end up with your balls in spaghetti sauce. Are you trying to say you've a lot of clout with the syndicate? Enough to blow you away with one call. Now get the hell out of here! I'll tell you what you are to me. Just a maggot who sells dirty pictures. - Wanda, where is she? - Go to hell. - One more time, Wanda. - All right, all right. She quit a couple of weeks ago, that's all I know. She got religious. - What do you mean? - Hanging around the church on Garvey. Captain, is it true you received another ransom tape... ... from the People's Revolutionary Strike Force? - Yes, we have. - Is the Mayor all right? We have been assured that he's okay but, of course, there won't be... ... any payment or arrangement for transportation until we have... ... seen the Mayor with our own eyes. - Then you're letting the kidnappers go? - That is the agreement. - Any idea where they are holed up? - Not yet... ... but we should get one more message this evening. If you'll excuse me. Is it true that Inspector Callahan has been taken off this case? I'm sorry, no more questions. What do you have? I got the priest, John Voss, Father John, very militant, very big in prison reform. He runs rehabilitation seminars in all the prisons in this area. This is a list of the prisoners that took the seminar in San Quentin. Bobby Maxwell never missed a session. - You wait here. - Wait, wait. Fessenheim. The latest ransom tape mentioned Fessenheim again. And what does that mean? Last year, two bombs were exploded at a nuclear plant near Fessenheim, France. How about that. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body... Remember me, Father? Yes. What is it you want, Callahan? I'd like to talk to you about Bobby Maxwell. Then get a warrant. - Just a minute. - I thought I made it clear to you, Officer. I have nothing whatsoever to say to you. And what right do you have to come in here and harass me in my church? - Is that a confessional over there? - You want to make a confession? You first! Where the hell's Maxwell? God just might forgive you, but I won't. Why do you protect these people? Do you know how many they've killed? Sacrifices have to be made, mister. These people are at war! So am I. How dare you pull a gun in the house of God. If you don't believe in the sanctity... I don't have time to argue religion with you, boy. Look at her hands! - There wasn't supposed to be any killing. - Is she dead? I close my eyes to this. Father in heaven, help me. You can't close your eyes anymore. Now, where's Maxwell? Alcatraz. A place to hole up. I don't suppose it would do any good to suggest... Forget it. No further communications have been received since the last... Nothing. You sure Wanda got those tapes to the cops? Bobby, I don't know. I don't know, I don't... I wasn't with her. - If you didn't think she could do it... - Shut up! - What are you doing here? - A lousy cup of coffee, okay? Hey, can't you see it says no trespassing? Get the hell out of here. Jesus Christ, man, get your ass out there! Lalo. Let's get the Mayor. We'll bring him in here and hold out. I'll get the bar. You get that son of a bitch out of there. Freeze! All right, let him go. Move over there, Your Honor. That's fine. Okay, now, I want you very slowly... ...to put down that weapon... ...and then on the deck, and spread your legs. Are you kidding me? You laugh at me, you bastard, and I'll shoot you where you stand. Let's go, Your Honor. Let's go! Let's get out of here. Now speed it up! Stay with me. Hold it. Just take it very easy. You relax, do just as I say, and I'll get you home, all right? Yes. All right, take it slow. Wait a minute. Here we go. Harry, look out! Oh, Harry, I messed up. You're doing just fine, Kate. Let me get you out of here. Don't concern yourself, Harry. Get him. You can count on it. You fucking fruit! Get up there! Go on, move! Oh, God! Callahan, you saved my life. I'll never be able to thank you. I'll never be able to tell you. There will be a letter of commendation there for you. The chopper's here. Don't you want to ride... Maxwell. Bobby Maxwell, this is Captain McKay speaking. We have your money. A plane is waiting for you at the airport. We have acceded to all your demands... ... so release the Mayor. The pilot of this helicopter will fly you and your men to safety., l am, beyond a doubt, the last of the old-timers, My name is Jack Crabb, and I am the soIe white survivor of the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn, popuIarIy known as Custer's Last Stand. WeII, Mr Crabb, I'm more interested in the primitive IifestyIe of the PIains Indian than I am in... (LAUGHS ) ...taII taIes about Custer. TaII taIes? Are you caIIing me a Iiar? No, no. It's just that... I'm interested in the way of Iife of the Indian, rather than, shaII we say, adventure. You think the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn was an adventure? LittIe Bighorn was not representative of encounters between whites and Indians, Mr Crabb. You see, the near genocide of the Indian... - The near what? - Near genocide. It means... ...extermination. The kiIIing off of an entire peopIe. That's practicaIIy what we did to the Indian. But, of course, I wouIdn't expect an oId Indian fighter, Iike you, to agree with me. - Turn that thing on. - Pardon? I said, turn that thing on and shut up. You sit there and you'II Iearn something. I knowed GeneraI George Armstrong Custer for what he was, and I aIso knowed the Indians for what they was. 1 1 1 years ago, when I was ten years oId, my famiIy, in crossing the Great PIains, was wiped out by a band of wild lndians, Everybody was killed or drug off by them murdering varmints except me and my sister Caroline, (MUSlC: DOLEFUL HARMONlCA) Ah! Oh! Bye, Jack. I'II see you in heaven. Goodbye, CaroIine. We didn't know the difference then, but it was a band of Pawnee what attacked us, l ain't had no use for Pawnee ever since, But this one wasn't a Pawnee, He was a Cheyenne brave, l later got to know him well, His name was Shadow That Comes ln Sight, At first sight of an lndian camp, what you think is: ''l see their dump, Where's the camp?'' He brought us to their chief, His name was Old Lodge Skins, who later become my granddaddy, What do they want, CaroIine? It's as pIain as day what they want, Jack. What? Me. To show good manners, Old Lodge Skins smoked with our oldest male survivor, They didn't know I was a woman. That expIains why they didn't rape me right off. I don't think they're going to bother you. No such Iuck, Jack. They'II get me tonight, for sure. Poor Caroline never did have no luck with men, l reckon she figured we both couldn't get away and she'd send help to rescue me, The next morning, l found myself in that lndian camp all alone, But the Cheyenne, who call themselves the Human Beings, had no idea to hurt me, l was an honoured guest and they gave me a treat, Boiled dog, Dog ain't bad, neither, Greasy, l'll admit, but you'd be surprised how delicate the flavour is, especially when you're starving, You see, the Human Beings adopted me as one of their own, Shadow That Comes ln Sight taught me the bow and arrow and how to stalk game, Burns Red ln The Sun showed me how to protect my pale skin from sunburn, lt's little known that some lndians, like Burns Red, will sunburn their own selves, But my real teacher was my adopted grandpa, Old Lodge Skins, He taught me to read a trail, Cheyenne language and lots of other things, For a boy, it was a kind of paradise, l wasn't just playing lndian, l was living lndian, Only one thing bothered me: l was small for my years, ln fact, darn near a runt, The Pawnee stoIe seven ponies. There's going to be a war party. But you can't go. You're too IittIe and weak, Iike a girI. Run away now or I'II kick you. The lndians had never heard of fist fighting, and it amazed them, How did you do that? I'm sorry, Younger Bear. I didn't mean to hurt you. The lndian way: never feel sorry about beating an enemy unless, having conquered his body, you want his spirit as well, l had made the first real enemy of my life, There once was a Human Being, and he was very smaII. But he won a name: LittIe Man. You've heard of him? No, Grandfather. He went on a war party against the Pawnees. But the Pawnees were many. One by one, the Human Beings were rubbed out. LittIe Man was very brave. The Pawnees caIIed out to him, ''If you wiII quit fighting, we wiII Iet you go.'' But LittIe Man answered, ''It's a good day to die.'' FinaIIy, they cut off his head, but he kept fighting without his head. He rode among the Pawnees Iike a whirIwind, and his head, which was stuck on a spear, started to shout the war cry. The Pawnees couId take no more, and they ran away. When they Iooked back, they saw the body of LittIe Man Iie down among his friends. LittIe Man was smaII, but his bravery was big. The Human Beings don't require a boy to be a warrior if he ain't got the temperament, and Little Horse didn't, lf he wanted to stay with the women, that was all right with the Human Beings, We wiII Ieave the ponies here. You hoId them. No! I don't want to. I want to go to the Pawnee camp. You... You aren't even a Human Being. You're white. He didn't believe it himself, Younger Bear was just trying to hand me the worst possible insult, Ah! Ah! LittIe White Man... ...fooI poor Pawnee. Big fooIing. You want to eat? Pawnees was always sucking up to whites, LittIe White Man not mad, huh? See? Pawnee friend. Fix this bad Indian for LittIe White Man. Uh! l always felt kind of bad about that poor Pawnee, l didn't mean to kill him, l just meant to distract him, l had made a real enemy of Younger Bear, I give you these ponies, but...I owe you a Iife. Saving his life was the final insult, This boy is no Ionger a boy. He is a brave. He is IittIe in body, but his heart is big. His name shaII be LittIe Big Man. I don't understand it. Why wouId they kiII women and chiIdren? Because they are strange. They do not seem to know where the centre of the earth is. We must have a war on these cowards and teach them a Iesson. (BEATING ON DRUMS AND CHANTING ) This wiII be the first time, my son, I face the whites as an enemy. I don't know whether you remember before you became a Human Being and as dear a son to me as those I made with BuffaIo WaIIow Woman and the others, but I won't speak of that unfortunate time. I just want to say, if you beIieve riding against these white creatures is bad, you can stay out of the fight. No one wiII think the worse. Grandfather, I think it's a good day to die. My heart soars Iike a hawk. l'm sorry to say that Old Lodge Skins' war against the whites was kind of pitiful, Not that the Human Being wasn't brave, No warrior ever walked the earth more brave than a Human Being, But Old Lodge Skins' idea of war was different from the whites', Half our party didn't use weapons, They ''took coup'', hit the enemy with a little stick, Humiliate them, That was how a Human Being taught a coward a lesson and won a war, Shadow! Repeating rifles against bow and arrow, l never understood how the whites could be so proud of winning with them kind of odds, Yee...argh... ! God bIess George Washington! Before l knowed it, them words popped out, God bIess my mother! You murdering fooI! Do I have to cut your throat before you see I'm white? - White? - Sure I'm white. Didn't I say, ''God bIess Washington and my mother''? What kind of Indian wouId say a fooI thing Iike that? Lend me that to get off this paint. The troopers took me and turned me over to the Reverend Silas Pendrake, for moral guidance and a Christian upbringing, - Can you drive a buggy, boy? - Oh, yes, sir. I can do it. You're a Iiar, boy. If you was reared by the Indians, how couId you Iearn to drive a buggy? We shaII have to beat the Iying out of you. (MUSlC: DOLEFUL HARMONlCA) Dear Jack. WeIcome to your new home. Your travaiI is over, enfoIded now as you are in Christian Iove. WeII, boy, are you unabIe to converse? - No, I'm gIad to meet your daughter. - You are addressing my wife. Poor boy. Poor darIing. Think of the years of suffering, deprivation and hardship among those awfuI savages. The boy's deprivation, my dear, has been more spirituaI than physicaI. The Indians know nothing of God and moraI right. They eat human fIesh, fornicate, aduIterise, misogynise and commune constantIy with minions of the deviI. It must be our task... nay, our Christian duty, - to beat the misery out. - Beat the poor boy? - Not whiIe there's breath in my body. - l could have kissed her, I didn't mean beat him IiteraIIy. I meant beat him symboIicaIIy. Poor boy. He hasn't even had a proper bath. - I detect the odour of food. - I shaII wash this poor boy. It's supper time. It is my Christian duty to give this boy an immediate, thorough bath. - Take your cIothes off. - Off? - Yes. - AII of them? Every stitch. But I shaII avert my eyes at the necessary moment. # Bringing in the sheaves # Bringing in the sheaves # We shaII come rejoicing # Bringing in the sheaves # Greatest bath l ever had in my life, # ShaII we gather at the river? # The beautifuI, the beautifuI river # You do reaIise, don't you, dear Jack, that the Reverend Pendrake is not aItogether wrong? What? I mean, what, ma'am? WeII, Jesus is your saviour. - You do reaIise that, don't you? - Oh, Lordy. Yes, Mrs Pendrake. Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack? Yes'm. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. - You mustn't fib to me. - Oh, no. I Iove Jesus and Moses and aII of them. There's quite a difference. Moses was a Hebrew, but Jesus was a GentiIe, Iike you and me. Ain't you done washing that boy yet? I'm giving the chiId reIigious instruction. I want to eat. Looks Iike a weII-growed chiId, if you ask me. AII right now, dear. PIease stand up and Iet me dry you off. I shaII avert my eyes, of course. Now step out of the tub. ActuaIIy, you are rather weII-grown, Jack. You're smaII, but...nice-Iooking. Did you know that? - No, ma'am. - WeII, you are. AII the more reason for you to receive reIigious instruction. The girIs, I'm sure, wiII aII be after you. - And, Jack... - Ma'am? That way Iies madness. What way, ma'am? You'II understand these things better when you're oIder. The point is, my dear boy, that we aII must resist temptation. Purity is its own reward. Dear Jack... WeIcome to your new home. (BREATHLESS ) Now dress... ...and come in to supper. l went to school and learned all over how to read and write and cipher, lt was strange at first, but Mrs Pendrake tutored me and l learned fast, But there was one thing l didn't know about and that was a thing called sin, I caught you at the gates of heII! Boy, the hand of God must smite the carcass of man. It's worth it, dear Jack. It's worth it a miIIion times over to be pure and good, to waIk in the paths of righteousness. There's no happiness Iike it. Do you beIieve me, Jack? Do you beIieve me? Yes, ma'am. I sure do. # Amazing grace... # So it was l entered my religion period, l was a great little hymn singer, and l wasn't fooling, l'd been saved, I baptise you in the name of the Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit. O Lord, Iook down upon this poor boy who Iived among the heathen and cIeanse him of the corruption of their fouI, pagan ways and make him white again as the snow. Let him be reborn and repurified in thy name. I baptise you in the name of the Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit. Amen. Mrs Pendrake was right about temptation, l'd have nothing to do with them Jezebels, l told her about my triumph over temptation, and we read the Bible for about an hour to celebrate, As the weeks went by, l fell more and more in love with Mrs Pendrake,,, ,,,spiritually, of course, I shaII be off for my shopping. The boy's doing so poor these days, why not take him aIong and air him? - He'd be bored with the shopping. - No, I wouIdn't, ma'am. AII right, then. You come with me, Jack. Good morning, Mr Kane. This is Jack, my adopted son. What's your pIeasure, ma'am? WeII, Iet's see. I think I shaII have a sassafras fIip. How about you, buster? Oh. Yeah, I'II have the same. Never mind for me. I must do my shopping. It wouId bore you terribIy, Jack. You stay here and have some cake. - I'II take care of him, Mrs Pendrake. - Thank you very much, Mr Kane. That soda shop was something, Especially that elephant-head spigot, l was playing with it and enjoying myself, Then, all of a sudden, an awful feeling run through me, Where had that fellow gone to? (MRS PENDRAKE) Don't. Don't. No, don't. Oh, yeah. No, don't... Yeah, pIease. No, don't. (GIGGLING ) Pagan beast. HeIp! You deviI. You fiIthy, dirty deviI. Heathen. No, no...yeah, yeah, yeah. No. HeIp! HeIp! HeIp. I'm dying. (JACK) She was calling him a devil and moaning for help, but l didn't get no idea she wanted to be rescued, That was the end of my religion period, l ain't sung a hymn in 1 04 years, After starving a while, l took up with a swindler, name of Allardyce T Meriweather, After Mrs Pendrake, his honesty was downright refreshing, (MERIWEATHER) It is my mission to pass on to you... Meriweather was one of the smartest men l ever knowed, but he tended to lose parts of himself, When l joined him, his left hand and his left ear were already gone, We might see a miracIe, one I have witnessed before. The power of this eIixir has been proven... (CRIES OUT) WaIk! WaIk! During my years with Meriweather, he lost an eye as a result of a fifth ace dropping out his sleeve in a poker game, lt didn't faze him, though, Deception was his life's blood, even if it caused him to get whittled down kind of gradual like, You're improving. You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty. The one that ruined you was that Indian, OId Tepee. - You mean OId Lodge Skins? - He gave you a vision of moraI order in the universe, and there isn't any. Those stars twinkIe in a void, dear boy, and the two-Iegged creature schemes and dreams beneath them, aII in vain. AII in vain, Jack. - You hear anything? - Listen to me! Men wiII beIieve anything, the more preposterous the better. WhaIes speak French at the bottom of the sea. The horses of Arabia have siIver wings. Pygmies mate with eIephants in darkest Africa. I have soId aII those propositions. WeII, maybe we're aII fooIs and none of it matters. Ah... You stay with AIIardyce Meriweather, and you'II wear siIk. I don't know as I want to wear siIk. My dear boy, what eIse can a man of parts wear than siIk? Tar and feathers, I reckon. AII right. Sit right there. Don't make no moves unIess you want a IittIe dayIight in your Iiver. What, may I ask, brings you out into the wiIds at this hour, sir? - That them? - Yes. I've seen this young one before. - I've never been in this country. - You Iook famiIiar, bub. Oh! Sir... What's in there? Lye? You can't expect me to reveaI its constituents. Sir, pIease. You're wasting precious medicine. Seven foIks are haIf-dead because of this. What's in it? Nothing harmfuI, I assure you. - What? - MostIy water. Whiskey, a IittIe pepper, oiI of cIoves, ginger root... - What's that? - What's what? Oh, that. It's a dozen snake heads, to give it strength. AII right, boys. Yee-ha... ! Got caught, Jack, that's aII. Life contains a particIe of risk. - You don't know when you're Iicked. - Licked? I'm not Iicked. I'm tarred and feathered, that's aII. AII right, boys. I reckon they've been rode enough. - Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three. - Throw up three. What's your name, son? - Jack Crabb. - Lord above! I've tarred and feathered my own brother! It's wonderfuI, Jack. I can give you something you never had before, and something I never had before, neither... ...a reaI...famiIy Iife. Yeah. You are back in the bosom of your famiIy, Jack. OK, now you. I don't know anything about guns. I never even carried none. Lord! What kind of upbringing did them Indians give you? Never carried no gun? Why, a man ain't compIete without a gun. - Go snake-eyed. - Do what? Like this. Like this. AII right. Now... Draw and shoot that bottIe before you touch the gun. How can I draw and shoot the gun before I touch it? Concentrate. Try it. Hot damn! Yeah. Caroline was right, lt is possible to shoot a gun before you touch it, 'Course, it takes lightning reflexes,,, and considerable snake-eyed concentration, Throw up three. - Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three. - Throw up three. NaturaI-born gunfighter. So it was l entered my gunfighter period, You're crowding me. I didn't see you. I'm sorry. It's stupid of me to take up aII that room. - Set me up with a soda pop. - Yes, sir. Right away, kid. The Soda Pop Kid, that's what they called me, Soda pop, he wants. - Anything wrong with that, stranger? - No, not a thing, friend. In fact, I admire the styIe of you. Might I ask who I are addressing? I'm WiId BiII Hickok. WeII, I'm... - I'm pIeased to meet you. - The pIeasure's mutuaI, friend. Bring your soda pop over here and sit for a whiIe. I can break three bottIes throwed in the air. That's shooting. How many men have you... ...gunned down? I don't rightIy recoIIect. How many have you? Oh, about... ...two dozen. - That a fact? - No, it wasn't a fact at all, During my gunfighter period, l was an awful liar, I wouIdn't have estimated your totaI that high. No offence intended, but you don't have the Iook of murder in your eye. Like that buzzard over there. Him? WeII, he's just a common drunk. Hm... What are you so nervous about? Getting shot. I got a fuII house! I got a...fuII house. Now you've got me doing it. Sorry. HoId the fort a whiIe, oId horse, whiIe I get another bottIe. Did you know the man, BiII? Never saw the gent before. Mr Hickok, that man is reaIIy dead. Got him through the Iungs and heart, both. SeIIing your gunfighter outfit? Turning in your gun? - WeII, sorry, CaroIine. - There ain't nothing more useIess than a gunfighter who can't shoot peopIe. Men! Ah-har! There went the bosom of my family, Having tried religion, snake-oil and gunfighting unsuccessfully, l took a partner, become a respectable storekeeper, and married Olga, a Swedish girl who couldn't hardly speak no English, Preserve the moment. Yes. OIga, shaII I carry you over the threshoId? Ja? - It's a custom. - Ja? WeII, it ain't much now, OIga, but me and my partner, we got big pIans. Free enterprise and honest sweat. Ja, Ja, I don't understand this biII. Looks Iike I'm being charged twice. Ja, the biIIs of the store. There must be an error. Jack AppIebound wouIdn't do that to me. Jack, enough the biIIs. Come and get some rest. I must be making a mistake. Jack, the rest, the body. You needs it. Yeah. Maybe I do. Rest. OIga. OIga, come on. We'II get out of this somehow. One little thing about my new business partner: he was a thief, (AUC TlONEER) ,,,25 cents for this glorious musical instrument, Look at this beautiful instrument, Who will take it? - That is a pathetic scene. - Yes, sir. A ruined and desoIate famiIy wiped out by economic misfortune. I find it touching. l'll never forget the first time l set eyes on General George Armstrong Custer, (OLGA) Ruined! That's what we used to have. Ruined! Do you have another trade? WeII, GeneraI, I... Not exactIy. Then take my advice. Go west. West?! - My wife is scared of Indians. - You have nothing to fear. I give you my personaI guarantee. OIga! OIga! - Hit him! Hit him! - Sorry, brother. I think we're going to get away. - Let me at him! I've got a gun here. - We must be civiIised. ''And it came to pass after the pIague that the Lord spake...'' Grab the reins! Grab the reins! - Give it! Give me that shotgun. - No, it's mine! - (UNINTELLIGIBLE RANTING ) - Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Yee-haa! Ah! Get back! Come on, get back! Jack! Get back. I'II protect you. Aaah... ! OIga! OIga! OIga. l covered most of three states and hundreds of square miles looking for Olga, with no luck at all, - Hey, Crabb. - Whiskey, whiskey... For a drink of whiskey, they'II give you a squaw. Sure save you a Iot of Iooking. l looked everywhere for my wife but couldn't find her, Finally, l had to go deeper into Cheyenne country, l didn't figure for me it was dangerous, speaking Cheyenne and having once been a Human Being myself, - KiII him. - I didn't steaI, brother. Why do you caII me ''brother''? Don't. I am not your brother. I am a Human Being. I suppose you wiII say you have never heard of LittIe Big Man. LittIe Big Man was my brother, but you're not him. He was kiIIed after rubbing out many bIuecoats. Did you see the body? No, he turned into a swaIIow and fIew away. - Let's kiII him. - Shadow! You were shot. I put you on a pony. I saved you. Dirt On The Nose, do you stiII have the pony I gave you? No. The Pawnee stoIe him when we camped at the OId Woman Butte five snows ago. It is true there is a thing here I do not understand. There is a pain between my ears. My son, to see you again causes my heart to soar Iike a hawk. Sit here beside me. Grandfather, I brought you this present. Is this the hat I used to own, except grown softer of skin and fatter? No, grandfather, it's another. We must smoke to your return. I saw you in a dream. You were drinking from a spring that came from the Iong nose of an animaI. I did not recognise the animaI. AIongside his nose, he grew two horns, and the water that gushed from his nose was fuII of air. l can't explain it, but he was talking about that elephant-head spigot in the soda shop, This wasn't the only time Old Lodge Skins had dreams that turned out true, Don't be angry, my son, with Burns Red, Shadow and the others. They had many a bad experience with the white man Iast year. I have thought and taIked and smoked on this matter, and my decision is... LittIe Big Man has returned. lt was quite a homecoming, LittIe Big Man. lt was Little Horse, the boy who didn't want to fight the Pawnee, Don't you remember me? This hurts me in my heart. I think I'II cry. He'd become a heemaneh, for which there ain't no English word, And he was a good one, too, The Human Beings thought a lot of him, - HeIIo, Younger Bear. - Goodbye. lt was the boy whose life l'd saved, to his mortal embarrassment, Did you catch the rabbits on your hunting trip? No. Then don't give them to BuffaIo WaIIow Woman. You see, Younger Bear had become a contrary, the most dangerous of all Cheyenne warriors because the way they live drives them half-crazy, Except for battle, a contrary does everything backwards, He says ''goodbye'' for ''hello'', ''yes'' for ''no'', walks through bushes instead of on trails, and washes with dirt and dries with water, I thought you were dead. Why have you come back when nobody wants to see you? You mustn't speak to LittIe Big Man Iike that. You owe him a Iife. I'm gIad I said it. HeIIo. That was supposed to mean he was sorry he said it, goodbye, But that warrior wasn't sorry, He hated me still, Grandfather, I have a white wife. You do? That's interesting. Does she cook and work hard? Oh, yes, Grandfather. That surprises me. Does she show pIeasant enthusiasm when you mount her? WeII, sure, Grandfather. That surprises me even more. I tried one of them once, but she didn't show any enthusiasm at aII. WeII, Grandfather, aII the whites aren't crazy. I'm gIad to hear that, my son. - I thought they were. - Oh, no. I know of one who is as brave as any Human Being. I'd Iike to meet this man and smoke with him. What is he caIIed? He's caIIed GeneraI Custer. GeneraI Custer. - What does the name mean, my son? - WeII, it means... - ...''Iong hair''. - Good name. How did he win it? He won it in the war of the whites to free the bIack men. Oh, yes. The bIack white men. I know of them. It is said a bIack white man once became a Human Being. But mostIy, they are strange creatures. Not as ugIy as the white, true, but they're just as crazy. Don't worry, my son. You'II return to the Human Beings. I dreamed it Iast night. I saw you and your wives as you crawIed from one to the other in your tepee. - Wives, Grandfather? - Oh, yes. Three or four. It was dark, and they were hidden under buffaIo robes. But it was a great copuIation, my son. The Human Beings onIy take one wife. How couId I have three or four? I don't know. It worries me. l was sure l'd never see him again, Sir! I expect being a scout is the best way to find my wife, GeneraI. She was captured when we went west, Iike you advised. I advised? ImpossibIe. I've never set eyes on you. You wouIdn't remember me, sir. Furthermore, you don't Iook Iike a scout to me. Not a bit. A scout has a certain appearance. Kit Carson, for exampIe. But you don't have it. You Iook Iike... - ...a muIe skinner. - I know nothing about muIes. I can teII the occupation of a man by Iooking at him. Notice the bandy Iegs, the strong arms. This man has spent years with muIes. - Isn't that correct? - WeII, I... Yes, sir. - Hire the muIe skinner! - Yes, sir. Over here! Come on! I wouIdn't want my wife back from Indians. Kindest thing, a buIIet in the brain. WeII, I don't agree, and I want my wife back. WeII, one of the Pawnee Iocated a band of the vermin camped down the river. We ride in the morning! Is there any white women with them? My advice to you is to get yourseIf a IittIe revenge on them bucks. AII right. Spare the femaIes and chiIdren, if possibIe. Let's go. - (BARKING ) - (SCREAMING ) Hey! No! Hey! He said spare the women and chiIdren! Give me that! - Let go of my rifIe. - The heII I wiII! You son of a bitch! You bastard! I'II kiII you. lt was downright discouraging, lf it wasn't lndians trying to kill me for a white, it was whites trying to kill me for an lndian, lt made me sick, Pawnee scouts and soldiers was killing everything, Aah! Shadow! Brother, Iet's taIk. Shadow... I just took care of him. I'm saving you for the hanging. There is no describing how l felt, An enemy had saved my life by the violent murder of one of my best friends, The world was too ridiculous even to bother to live in it, That was why Shadow was there and that was why he'd fought so hard, l sat and watched that baby come into this world, Except for breathing, that woman made no sound, lf woman she was, She didn't look more than a girl, (BAB Y CRlES ) l couldn't take my eyes off of that girl and her baby, AII right, Iet's get the heII out. Let the Pawnee cIean up. Now, you Iisten to me. If you are kin to Shadow, then you know of LittIe Big Man. I was a friend of the Human Beings untiI they stoIe my wife. Are you Shadow's wife? His daughter? Where's your husband? KiIIed. - What's your name? - Sunshine. I'm going to take you with me and trade you for my wife. Near them bushes, Younger. They're gone. Nobody here. Let's get the heII out. Wait here. HeIIo, Grandfather. Greetings, my son. Do you want to eat? Grandfather? What happened to your neck? It's a wound. It cut the tunneI through which Iight traveIs to the heart. You're... You mean you're bIind? Oh, no. My eyes stiII see. But my heart no Ionger receives it. How did it happen? White men. - Where's BuffaIo WaIIow Woman? - Rubbed out. And White EIk Woman, too, and Dirt On The Nose, and High WoIf. - And many others. - And Burns Red? Yes. - Burns Red In The Sun? - Rubbed out. His wife, his chiIdren. - And many more. - Do you hate them? Do you hate the white men now? Do you see this fine thing? Do you admire the humanity of it? Because the Human Beings, my son, they beIieve everything is aIive. Not onIy man and animaIs, but aIso water, earth, stone. And aIso the things from them, Iike that hair. The man from whom this hair came, he's baId on the other side, because I now own his scaIp. That is the way things are. But the white men, they beIieve everything is dead: stone, earth, animaIs, and peopIe, even their own peopIe. If things keep trying to Iive, white men wiII rub them out. That is the difference. You wiII stay with us, my son. A year later, l was still with them, After wandering all over in constant danger of being killed by white settlers or white soldiers, we come to a place knowed as the lndian Nations, lt was a tract of land by the Washita River that had been give for ever to the lndians by the Congress and the President of the United States, We was safe there, This was lndian land,,, ,,,as long as grass grow and wind blow and the sky is blue, Your new son's kicking a Iot today. I think he wants to come out and see his father. TeII him to wait untiI I finish my dinner. I'II teII him, but I don't think he's going to wait much Ionger. It's good I have a strong, brave husband who brings in so much food. My strong husband brings in much more than we need. There are many Human Beings here, many bands from many pIaces. But it's sad. Many husbands have been rubbed out by the white man. So women sIeep aIone and cry. Be quiet now. I'm digesting. Yes, but I think my sisters are here. Your what? My sisters. Digging Bear, LittIe EIk and Corn Woman. I think they're here. What do you mean, you ''think'' they're here? I beIieve they are. You bring in much more food than we need. It is very sad. They have no husbands and they cry. That's too bad. I'm sorry. Digging Bear had a baby and Iost it, and so did Corn Woman. - But LittIe EIk had no baby at aII. - What do you want me to do about it? I knew you'd understand. lt was Old Lodge Skins' dream, trying to come true, l was determined to stay out of them buffalo robes, Three young and healthy women with no man for who knows how long, The very idea kind of shrunk me like a spider on a hot stove, Why, it's LittIe Big Man. Oh, LittIe Big Man. Younger Bear, it's LittIe Big Man. He's not a contrary any more. He has a wife. She's pIump, she works hard, but she henpecks him. Just when I think you're dead, you aIways come back. Yes, and I aIways wiII, tiII you pay me the Iife you owe me. I've heard you. Now come to my tepee and eat. We was caught in Cheyenne hospitality, I'm a very important man, more important than you. I have a wife and four horses. I have a horse and... ...four wives. That may be, but my wife, she's a very good one. See? Oh, so there you are, you crawIing coyote. What are we going to eat? This starved duck? Oh! Who's the beggar you brought to steaI what IittIe food we have? CIean it! CIean it! lt was Olga, l'd found her at last, One duck. Olga never did learn much English, but she sure in hell had learned Cheyenne, I just don't understand it. UsuaIIy, this woman is gentIe as a dove. My words were not the words to speak to a stranger. You stay and eat. You see what a good wife she is? It's because I'm a wonderfuI Iover. Go in my tepee. She wiII cook for you. That's aII right. I'm not hungry. You humiIiated him again. Goodbye, Younger Bear. You Iook tired, LittIe Big Man. Do you want to come into my tepee and rest on soft furs? Why don't you Iive with me and I'II be your wife? Thank you for inviting me. WeII, I've got to fix my hair to sing tonight. Goodbye, LittIe Big Man. Goodbye, LittIe Horse. And so l finally found Olga, But l had lost her long ago to the Human Beings and l saw no good reason to reveal myself to her now, Grandfather. Why have you moved your tepee so far from our band? The ponies are trying to teII me something. Last night I had a dream. The ponies were dying. I heard them scream. l'd learned to respect Old Lodge Skins' dreams, but for once we were in a safe place, give to us by treaty, Why do you hate my sisters? I don't hate your sisters. It's just that... ...the Great Spirit teIIs me... Where are you going? Your son won't wait any Ionger. He wants to come out and see his father. Sunshine, lndian style, was going off to have her baby, As l watched her walk away, it come over me that the Great Spirit wanted me to go in that tepee, Who wants to be first? - Who is this here? - It's me. WeII, I guess you'II do as weII as any. l figured she was the littlest one and it would be easy, But Lord help us, them young girls is deadly, However, the Great Spirit was with me, and l survived, Only thing was, just as l was about to drift off real peaceful,,, No, you stay. - Not yet. - Maybe I can come back Iater. ldle boasting, l assure you, - Who's this here? - It's me. Digging Bear. Well, she wasn't called Digging Bear for nothing, l can tell you that, Stay here. Corn Woman's too tired. She don't sound tired to me. That's not her. That's LittIe EIk. That's both of them. LittIe EIk, you go to sIeep. You too. Digging Bear... Corn Woman, where are you? l was lucky l come across her last, The others, too? Yes. I knew you were a good man. Here's your new son. l reckon right then l come close to turning pure lndian, and l probably would have spent the rest of my days with Sunshine and her sisters, - But sometimes grass don't grow, - (WHINNYING ) wind don't blow and the sky ain't blue, Something's wrong with the ponies. WoIves. Grandfather's... Here. Go inside. Don't Ieave the tepee. - (WHINNYING ) - (RUMBLE OF HOOVES ) Grandfather, what's wrong with the ponies? Don't you hear that, my son? I wonder why I didn't see them in my dream. Sunshine! Sunshine! Grandfather, you've got to get inside. Why bother, son? It's a good day to die. We've got to get to the river bank! I am bIind. I cannot fight. But I won't run. If it's my day to die, I want to do it here, within a circIe. Grandfather, the river is part of the great circIe of the waters of the earth. True, but the soIdiers wouId kiII us before we got to the river. The soIdiers? Grandfather, you didn't see any soIdiers in your dream, and that means that they can't see you now. - You think so? - Yes! What eIse did your dream mean? - I think you're right. - Let's go to the circIe of the river! I've never been invisibIe before. - It's too Iate. We're cut off. - It doesn't matter. We're invisibIe. Grandfather, wait! Grandfather! lt sounds ridiculous, but the soldiers never lifted a hand to stop us, lt was so crazy, they couldn't figure it out, Maybe they thought we was prisoners or friendlies, since Old Lodge Skins was grinning at them like a raccoon, Or maybe we really was invisible, All l knowed is we walked right through them to the river, CircIe the camp! CircIe the camp, boys! - That was extremeIy enjoyabIe. - GIad you Iiked it, Grandfather. Captain! - Captain, shoot the Indian ponies. - I beg your pardon, sir? That is my decision. Shoot the ponies. - Sunshine. - Yes, sir. Young man, your seIf-righteous piety is commencing to annoy me. - I didn't say anything. - Shooting ponies shocks you? Let me teII you, the women are more important than the ponies. They breed Iike rats. However, this is a IegaI action, and the men are under strict orders not to shoot the women. UnIess, of course, they refuse to surrender. - Isn't that correct? - Yes, sir. Sunshine! Run! Run! Run! No! No! - Where you going? - Message for the GeneraI. Wait a minute. - What's that on your face? - Mud, sir. That's not mud. That's Indian paint. And that's an Indian knife. - What's your company? - My company, sir? Yes, and your commanding officer. - What's the troubIe, Captain? - We've got a renegade. He's wearing Indian paint and he doesn't know his company. - Take him away and hang him. - GeneraI! Don't you remember me? I'm Jack Crabb, the muIe skinner! - MuIe skinner? - Yes. I appIied for a job as scout, but you couId teII my true occupation just by Iooking at me. Yes, I beIieve I do remember that. How did you become a renegade? GeneraI, I ain't no renegade! I was captured by the Cheyenne and heId prisoner! Why, they took cactus thorns and stuck them in me! But I just Iaughed and begged them to keep on doing it! - You Iaughed? - I Iaughed my head off. Otherwise I wouIdn't be here. GentIemen, it is difficuIt to admit to an error. Captain. Your summary judgement was whoIIy mistaken! Aren't you gIad I questioned this man more cIoseIy? Yes, sir. PIease be more carefuI in the future, Captain. - I'II drink the tea now, CorporaI. - Yes, sir. What are you doing up here, muIe skinner? Nothing. I just brought you tea, GeneraI. And I... ...wanted to thank you again for sparing my Iife. Why are you standing to the side? Turn this way. You came up here to kiII me, didn't you? And you Iost your nerve. WeII, I was correct in a sense. You are a renegade, but you are no Cheyenne brave. Custer was right, l was a total failure as an lndian, Do I hang you? I think not. Get out of here. - You're not going to hang me? - Your miserabIe Iife is not worth a reversaI of a Custer decision. That was the worst thing he could have done to me, There was nothing left of my self-respect at all, l couldn't go back to the lndians, so l went back among the whites and become a drunk, Oh, you're a sad sight, Hoss. You shouId have stuck to soda pop. - How are things with you, BiII? - Fine. - I've changed my ways, Hoss. - That's good. Hey, BiII, I need a drink worse than the breath of Iife itseIf. Here's $20. Get gIoriousIy drunk. But first, go to the barber and have yourseIf a bath. And buy some cIothes. Then come see me in the saIoon. One thing I do know, Hoss. Any fooI can drink himseIf to death. I'd Iike to ask you a confidentiaI favour. It's a deIicate matter invoIving a widow. She needs a train ticket out of town. - You give her this. - Sure, BiII. You see, my new, beautifuI wife is vioIentIy jeaIous. And this widow... Oh, she's quite a widow. - I think I know what you mean, BiII. - Her name is LuIu Kane. - Right now, BiII. - Good. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! - BiII! - He kiIIed my daddy! He kiIIed my daddy! He ain't never going to shoot nobody again! It took me seven years, but I got him! - Who was he, anyhow? - Some boy. Hoss, you know that matter we discussed? - The widow? - Yes, BiII. Don't teII my wife. That'd reaIIy get me in troubIe. You got me down in this goddamn water. - (BELL) - You quit it right now, Come in, stranger. Whatever it is you want, we've got it. Mrs Pendrake? You've mistaken me for someone eIse, stranger. My name is LuIu. Your name ain't LuIu. You're Louise Pendrake. - Who are you? - Why, I'm Jack Crabb. Mrs Pendrake, don't you remember me? Jack Crabb? My God. Jack. This is quite a pIeasant surprise. This room is more commodious. What have you been doing? LuIu! What are you doing, sitting on your arse? - A gentIeman is waiting. - I have a gentIeman here, too. Oh. I didn't see you, stranger. Need anything? If you do, just ring the beII. Our motto here is: whatever you want, we've got it. WeII, Jack. Now you know. This is a house of iII fame, and I'm a faIIen fIower. That widow hadn't lost her style one bit, A fallen flower, Chokes me up to think about it, This Iife is not onIy wicked and sinfuI. It isn't even any fun. No, I reckon not, Mrs Pendrake. Yet, if I was married and couId come here once or twice a week, it might be fun. But every night, it's just boring. Oh, I can understand that. I can't save any money. If I couId just save a few doIIars, I couId visit my maiden aunt in Washington. I'd have cIothes, a carriage... I might even marry a senator. Oh! You'd make a good wife for a senator, Mrs Pendrake. You aIways were a sweet boy. Do you know, I often had wicked thoughts about you? SeveraI times. I aImost gave in to temptation. And now, here we are. Mrs Pendrake, what are you doing? Do you know that, once, I tiptoed into your room and stood over you for the Iongest time? It was the most awfuI temptation to wake you up. I wish that I had. It wouId have been deIiciousIy wicked. Is anything the matter, Jack? - No. - Then I'II wait for you in the... ...pIace of retirement. You shouId have woke me up that night years ago, Mrs Pendrake. This is from WiId BiII. It was his Iast wish that you go and Iive with your maiden aunt. His Iast wish was to save me? Oh, Jack. I must honour that wish. You can do it, Mrs Pendrake. Yes. I can, and I wiII. I've got to go now. Goodbye, Mrs Pendrake. Oh, goodbye, Jack. And thank you ever so much. And, Jack... If you're ever in Washington, do Iook me up. - How are things, Mr Meriweather? - SpIendid. WeII, now, Iook at that. BuffaIo hides. There's a worId of money chewing grass on those pIains, Jack. There goes BuffaIo BiII himseIf. Yes, sir. MuItipIy that by thousands. The buffaIo are getting scarce. You were raised by Indians. You shouId know how to track them. We couId make a kiIIing, Jack. - Haven't changed a bit, Jack. - Neither have you. You'd better watch out. They're whittIing you down. You can't afford to Iose any more of your parts. Every business has a particIe of risk. Bye, dear boy. That was my low, l had reached the bottom, l become a hermit, l went deep in the wilderness, as far away as l could get, Then one day, l found something trappers see fairly regular, An animal had gnawed off its own foot to escape from a trap, Something snapped in my head, l decided life wasn't fit to live, and the only thing to do was to mingle with the twinkling stars, Goodbye, Jack. At that moment, l really was crazy, and l was darn near off that cliff when,,, The time had come to look the devil in the eye and send him to hell where he belonged, The only question was how to get him there, Sergeant, take this man... ...and give him some cIothes. This man wiII be invaIuabIe to me, Major. InvaIuabIe, sir? I aImost hanged him as a renegade. Now he asks to be a scout. Oh, his game is very obvious: to Iead me away from his Indian friends. WeII, I stiII don't quite foIIow you, GeneraI. Anything that man teIIs me wiII be a Iie. Therefore, he wiII be a perfect reverse barometer. - Isn't that correct? - Of course, GeneraI. ln my belief, Custer's hate for the lndians and his ambition had combined on him, He figured he needed one more dramatic victory over the lndians to be nominated for President of the United States, That is a historical fact, Men, hoId! - We wiII take brief refreshment. - Dismount! Water break! Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant. It's the ceIibacy of the saddIe. I had muscIe spasms aII night. - Poison from the goonads. - Poison from the what, sir? Goonads. That's medicaI terminoIogy. GeneraI, it's my duty as your... The poison rises from the goonads and seeps down to the muscIes. The Crows want to know if you're going down the Medicine TaiI CouIee. - They do, do they? - Yes, sir, they do. They cIaim they want time to sing their death song. TeII the Crows they're women. But if the hostiIes come in behind us, and if they're waiting for us beIow, we'II never get out of there. HostiIes behind us? I see no hostiIes behind us. Do you see any? - No, sir, not at the moment. - Then... ...stop trying to cause a reversaI of a Custer decision. But, sir, wouIdn't it be best to send a squad down Medicine TaiI CouIee? - No, it wouIdn't. - May I ask, sir, why it wouIdn't? Because it wouId cost us the vitaI eIement of surprise. Surprise? They know we're here. But they don't know that I intend to attack them without mercy. - That's no surprise. - Of course it is. Nothing is more surprising than the attack without mercy. GeneraI... GeneraI, I must protest this impetuous decision. A Custer decision, impetuous? Grant caIIed me impetuous, too! That drunkard, sitting there in the White House, caIIing me impetuous! GeneraI, I impIore you to reconsider. Think of the men whose Iives depend upon you. What shouId I do, muIe skinner? Sir, that man doesn't know anything. What do you say, muIe skinner? ShouId I go down there, or withdraw? l had him, But this time what l held in my hand wasn't a knife, but the truth, WeII? What's your answer, muIe skinner? GeneraI, you go down there. - You're saying, go into the couIee? - Yes, sir. There are no Indians there, I suppose? I didn't say that. There are thousands of Indians down there, and when they get done with you, there won't be nothing Ieft but a greasy spot. This ain't the Washita River, GeneraI, and them ain't heIpIess women and chiIdren waiting for you. They're Cheyenne Brave, and Sioux. You go down there if you got the nerve. StiII trying to outsmart me, aren't you, muIe skinner? You want me to think that you don't want me to go down there, but the subtIe truth is you reaIIy don't want me to go down there. WeII, are you reassured now, Major? Men of the Seventh! The hour of victory is at hand! Onward to LittIe Bighorn and gIory! We've caught them napping! Sound the charge! We have them on the run! Take no prisoners! (BUGLE SOUNDS ABOVE BATTLE NOISE) Get off of your knees, men! Custer's with you! Custer's up! Stay with me! What are they doing? - Why aren't they charging? - There's nowhere to charge to. FooIs! They're shooting their own horses! Arrest them! Arrest them! - BugIer! Sound the charge! - We've got to make breastworks! I know aII about that, Major. Don't try to teII me my business. Make breastworks, men! Show them no mercy! I said, give them a voIIey! - We're running out of ammunition. - Right. Now we are running out of ammunition. I toId him this wouId happen. But he just sat there in the White House and Iaughed at me. That damned Cossack. This is horribIe. We're being wiped out! Go on, Christian America! Let your arrows fIy, savages! I am unbowed! Mr President! Mr President, distinguished visitors, honoured members of the Senate, taking the Indian as we find him, waiting... Why don't you shut up? Mr President, you are drunk. We can't have a man Iike you in the White House! Get on your feet and face the enemy! - Go away, GeneraI. - AII right. The sentence is death. AII right. You and I are even at Iast. I paid you the Iife I owe you, and, the next time we meet, I can kiII you without becoming an eviI person. He goes to dance his joy. Grandfather. I am gIad to see you. I'm gIad to see you, too, my son. My heart soars Iike a hawk. Do you want to eat? I won't eat with you because I'm going to die soon. Die, Grandfather? Yes, my son. I want to die in my own Iand, where Human Beings are buried in the sky. Why do you want to die, Grandfather? Because there's no other way to deaI with the white man, my son. Whatever eIse you can say about them, it must be admitted, you cannot get rid of them. No, I suppose not, Grandfather. There is an endIess suppIy of white men, but there aIways has been a Iimited number of Human Beings. We won today. We won't win tomorrow. Snake Woman, get me my eIk buriaI robe. Come, my son. We wiII go. It makes my heart sad. A worId without Human Beings has no centre to it. Go where, Grandfather? To the mountain, to the top. Come out and fight. It is a good day to die. Thank you for making me a Human Being. Thank you for heIping me to become a warrior. Thank you for my victories and for my defeats. Thank you for my vision and the bIindness in which I saw further. You make aII things and direct them in their ways, O Grandfather. And now, you have decided the Human Beings wiII soon waIk a road... ...that Ieads nowhere. I am going to die now, unIess death wants to fight. And I ask you for the Iast time to grant me my oId power to make things happen. Take care of my son here. See that he doesn't go crazy. (RAINDROPS FALL ON OLD LODGE SKINS ) Grandfather? Am I stiII in this worId? Yes, Grandfather. I was afraid of that. WeII... ...sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't. Let's go back to the tepee and eat, my son. My newest Snake wife cooks dog very weII. AII right, Grandfather. She aIso has a very soft skin. The onIy troubIe with Snake women is they copuIate with horses, which makes them strange to me. She says she doesn't. That's why I caII her Doesn't Like Horses. But, of course, she's Iying. Of course, Grandfather. Well, that's the story of this old lndian fighter, That's the story of the Human Beings, who was promised land where they could live in peace, Land that would be theirs as long as grass grow, wind blow, and the sky is blue, Mr Crabb, l didn't know, Get out, get out. (MUSlC: MAN SlNGS BLUES AND PLAYS HARMONlCA) ENGLISH SDH, Teacher. I see your talents have gone beyond the mere physical level. Your skills are now at the point of spiritual insight. I have questions: what is the highest technique you hope to achieve? - To have no technique. - Very good. What are your thoughts when facing an opponent? There is no opponent. And why is that? Because the word ""I"" does not exist. So. Continue. A good fight should be... like a small play, but played seriously. A good martial artist does not become tense, but ready. Not thinking, yet not dreaming. Ready for whatever may come. When the opponent expand, I contract. When he contracts, I expand. And when there is an opportunity... I do not hit. It hits all by itself. Now, you must remember... the enemy has only images and illusions... behind which he hides his true motives. Destroy the image and you will break the enemy. The ""it"" that you refer to is a powerful weapon... easily misused by the martial artist who deserts his vows. For centuries now, the code of the Shaolin Temple has been preserved. Remember, the honor of our brotherhood has been held true. Tell me now the Shaolin commandment number 13. ""A martial artist has to take responsibility for himself... and accept the consequences of his own doing."" I'm ashamed to tell you now... among all the Shaolin men I have taught... there is one who has turned the ways of knowledge and strength... to his own base ends. He has perverted all we hold sacred. His name is Han. In defiance of all our beliefs... he has brought disgrace to the Shaolin Temple. So it is now for you to reclaim our lost honor. Yes. I understand. There is a man here. You will go to him. Hello, Mr. Lee. My name's Braithwaite. Hello, Mr. Braithwaite. I've come to speak to you about a matter of great importance. - Have some tea? - Yes, indeed. This is very pleasant. Mr. Lee, I've come to speak to you about a tournament of martial arts. A tournament to which you've received an invitation. Specifically, a tournament organized by Mr. Han. - Han's tournament. - I know, I know, I know. But we'd very much like you to attend that particular tournament, Mr. Lee. ""We,"" Mr. Braithwaite? It's Lao's time. Yes, of course. Kick me. Kick me. What was that? An exhibition? We need emotional content. Try again. I said, emotional content, not anger. Now, try again. With me. That's it. How did it feel to you? Let me think.... Don't think. Feel. It is like a finger pointing a way to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger... or you will miss all that heavenly glory. Do you understand? Never take your eyes off your opponent, even when you bow. That's it. There. That's Han. That's the only film we have on him. We know he was a member of your temple. A Shaolin monk, now a renegade. That's Oharra behind him. Personal bodyguard. Tough, ruthless, as you might expect, being Han's bodyguard. We got our hands on a demonstration film of Oharra. All real bricks and boards, nothing phony about any of it. This was before he picked up a facial scar somewhere. This is where you'll be going. An island fortress, really. After the war, the nationality of the island was uncertain. And sometime after that, Han bought it. What do you know about Han? He lives like a king on that island. Totally self-sufficient. All of his efforts, seemingly... are directed toward supporting what he calls his ""school of martial arts."" Han's only contact with the outside world is this tournament... which he holds every three years. This was a stewardess, Mary King, found floating in the harbor. Nothing unusual about a body in the harbor. But this girl was last seen at a party aboard Han's private junk. They'd reported her lost at sea before the body was found. We believe he selects attractive girls... methodically builds their dependence on drugs... ...then sells them to an elite clientele around the world. What did the autopsy reveal as the cause of death? - She did not drown. - She OD'd? Yes. Cause of death was heroin overdose. You still don't have enough to bust up his operation. We know everything. We can prove nothing. We want you to go in there as our agent. - Get us our evidence. - And get out in one piece to give it to you. We'll give you anything you need. Electronic equipment, weapons, anything. - Drink? - No, thanks. Guns. Now, why doesn't somebody pull out a .45 and bang, settle it? No. No guns. Look at this map here. As you know, the possession of a weapon is a serious offense here. Han's island rests partly within our territorial waters. If we had the slightest reason to believe he has any kind of arsenal... we'd move in on him. Besides, Han would never allow guns on the island anyway. He had a bad experience with them once and he's fearful of assassination. You can't really blame him. Any bloody fool can pull a trigger. I guess I won't need anything. There's a radio on the island. We'll monitor it... on the chance you can get to it. And then you come? Someone will. We aren't an agency of enforcement. We function as gatherers of information, evidence. Upon which interested governments can act. I see. If there's any trouble, you make a phone call. Oh, by the way, two months ago... we managed to place a female operative on the island. Since then, we've lost her. If she's there, she might have something. Name's Mei Ling. - Sure you won't have one? - No, thanks. But now the time has come to tell you something very difficult. I'm happy you have decided to go to Han's tournament. Yeah. The last of the tournaments were held three years ago. I was in the city with your sister at that time. I didn't know that. Yes. Many of Han's men had come in from the island. They were everywhere, bullying and arrogant. We were on our way into town. Stay back! Run! Run! Now! Now you know the truth. When you get to the city... pay your respects to your sister and your mother. I will, old man. You will not agree with what I am going to do. It is contrary to all that you have taught me... and all that Su Lin believed. I must leave. Please try to find a way to forgive me. Double or nothing? That's about 1000 bucks a foot, Roper. Why not? I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now. May I take a message? That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper. Excuse me, fellas. - I say he can't make it. - What'll you bet? You gotta love him. Come on, Roper. It's 175 big ones by Monday the 15th. Only 150. You forget interest. - Maybe I ought to talk to Freddie. - You take advantage, Roper. Come on, fellas. It's the dough, Roper, or we gotta break something. You got it? Freddie says this is for your own good. Better confirm that flight to Hong Kong for me. - How much do I have left in the bank? - It's all yours. - Thanks. - Only, I think you'll need it. - You wanna bet? Double-punching. Ready.... Going on a trip, are you? - Hey, this jig's got a passport. - Where you going, jig? - Where's the plane ticket for? - Hong Kong, via Hawaii. He's not going to Hawaii. Well, look what we got here! Assaulting a police officer. - Hey, soldier, shape it up! - Roper! Hey, how are you, man? How am I, man? How am I? I'm glad to see you, that's how I am. - Hey, how long has it been? Five...? - Six years, man. - Six. - It's not as long as it seems. Yeah, I know what you mean. - What you been doing since Nam? - Hanging in a little bit. - All these yours? - Always first-class. Same old Roper. Come here. - Parsons. - Yeah, from New Zealand. This man's putting quite a collection together. Know him? Never saw him before. What do you know about this Han cat? Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big. They don't live so big over there. Ghettos are the same all over the world. They stink. Same old Williams. Yeah. What have we got here? A little action. Insects. Okay, I'll lay you 50 bucks on the big one. Fifty. $50 on the big one, all right? I'll give you 5-to-1. Would you bet 100? You're on. Come on, let's end this thing quickly. Thattababy. Come on. Come on! That's it. Just get him on his back. Get him on his back! Come on. Come on. Give up! Come on! Hey. Oh, for crying out loud. Would you believe that? Dumb shit. Do I bother you? Don't waste yourself. - What's your style? - My style? You can call it the art of fighting without fighting. ""The art of fighting without fighting""? - Show me some of it. - Later. All right. Don't you think we need more room? Where else? That island, on the beach. We can take this boat. Okay. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Hey, are you crazy? Pull me in! Pull me in! Don't try to pull yourself up or I'll let go of the line. Would you look at that? A woman like that could teach you a lot about yourself. Welcome. This way. I'll show you to your rooms. The banquet begins promptly at 8. I think you'll find our little island quite charming. Say, I hope you haven't spent all that money you won from me yesterday. - I plan to win it back. - How? You'll find out, after you've lost it. You seem to be very much at home here, Mr. Roper. This guy Han's got a great sense of hospitality. And a fantastic sense of style. Yeah, it's great. Then why are you so apprehensive? Apprehensive? No. I was just wondering whether it was okay to drink the water. Mr. Roper, don't con me. Wanna bet? No. I really don't think so. Thanks. What's the matter, you on a diet? I'd like to eat, if I could find something I could keep down. Well, I can't wait to meet our host. I hear this is only one of his B parties. You ever been to a martial arts tournament like this? Never. I have a funny feeling we're being fattened up for the kill. Better keep an eye out for the referee. - Know what I mean? - Yeah. Gentlemen, welcome. You honor our island. I look forward to a tournament... of truly epic proportions. We are unique, gentlemen... in that we create ourselves... through long years of rigorous training... sacrifice, denial, pain. We forge our bodies in the fire of our will. But tonight, let us celebrate. Gentlemen, you have our gratitude. Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams! For me? You shouldn't have. But.... I'll take you, darling. And you. And you. And you. Please understand, if I missed anyone... it's been a big day. I'm a little tired. Oh, of course, Mr. Williams. You must conserve your strength. Come in. A gift, Mr. Lee. - If you don't see anything you like.... - There was a girl at the feast tonight. Which girl, sir? The owner of this dart. Oh, yes. I know the one. I'll send her to you. Another fine mess you got me into. Come in. Hi. Well, well, one more lovely than the next. What did you have in mind? Pick one. I already have. Wise decision. I wanna talk to you, Mei Ling. Where do you come from? - Braithwaite-- - Let's be quiet. Have you seen anything? Nothing much. I'm kept in the palace, watched always. I know nothing of Han's activities away from the palace. But I can tell you this: people disappear. - Who? - The girls. Every one of them. They're summoned to Han's at night and the next day they're gone. I know I don't have much time. You must attend the morning ritual in uniform. Outside. Mr. Lee, why you no wear uniform? Gentlemen, let the tournament begin! Bolo. Good work. You made me some bread. - Mr. Roper. - I'm ready. Okay. I got myself a real pigeon here. Keep the action going for me, will you? What do you think, Roper? Oh, no sweat. Give my friend 8-to-3 all the way. I'm finding out about myself. This is the real me, definitely. Do you like it here? Oh, yeah. But a little lower. No. I mean here on the island. Yeah, I like it here. But a little lower. A man like you belongs here. To you, I'm just another pretty face. Where you go? Out in the moonlight, baby. It is not allowed. You must stay. Goodbye. A human fly. Gentlemen... it seems that one of you... was not content last night... with the hospitality of the palace... and sought diversion elsewhere on the island. Who it was is not important... at this time. What is important is that... my guards performed their duties incompetently. And now they must prove... themselves worthy to remain among us. Are you shocked, Mr. Williams? Only at how sloppy your man works. Mr. Lee? Are you ready? Boards don't hit back. - Bolo. - Go! Oharra! Oharra! Oharra's treachery has disgraced us. If you wanna talk about this thing, I'll be in my room. Gotcha. Williams? Williams. - Go to Han's study as soon as possible. - All right. Hey, Roper. I'll see you in half an hour. Right. - Mr. Han? - You fought well yesterday. Your style is unorthodox. But effective. It is not the art, but the combat that you enjoy. The winning. We are all ready to win... just as we are born knowing only life. It is defeat that you must learn to prepare for. I don't waste my time with it. When it comes, I won't even notice. How so? I'll be too busy looking good. What were you looking for when you attacked my guards? Wasn't me. You were the only man outside the palace. I was outside, but I wasn't the only one. You will tell me who else. Mr. Han, suddenly I'd like to leave your island. - It is not possible. - Bullshit, Mr. Han-Man! Man, you come right out of a comic book. Been practicing? - Williams is expecting me. - I wanted to talk to you. We will meet your friend Williams later. - Okay. - This is my museum. It is difficult to associate these horrors... with the proud civilizations that created them: Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe, the samurai. They worship strength because it is strength... that makes all other values possible. Nothing survives without it. Who knows what delicate wonders have died out of the world... for want of the strength to survive. What's this? A souvenir. - Up here. - A guillotine? No, thanks. This is the only angle I care to see it from. If you please, Mr. Roper. You want me to put my head on that thing? An act of faith. I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han. Very few people can be totally ruthless. It isn't easy. It takes more strength than you might believe. Now you've got eight more. Then there is a point you will not go beyond. Faked out again. This way. Our power plant. Oh, yeah. A lifetime of women. A man's strength can be measured by his appetites. Indeed, a man's strength flows from his appetites. Oh, no. They are my daughters. Your daughters? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that-- I misunderstood. Miss Han? And also, they are my most personal guard. I admire your judgment. Nobody's as loyal as daddy's little girl. - Mr. Roper? - No, thanks. I'll get up myself. Nice meeting you. Opium. We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper. The business of corruption is like any other. Oh, yeah. Provide your customers with products they need... and encourage that need a little bit to stimulate your market... pretty soon your customers depend on you. I mean, really need you. It's the law of economics. Right. And here we are stimulating quite another need. You wonder why I am exposing so much of myself? I forget what I see very easily. But then, why are you? I'm hoping you'll join us, represent us in the United States. I'm beginning to understand the thing with the tournament. The whole setup. It's a great way to recruit new talent. And who are they? The refuse found in waterfront bars. Shanghaied? Just lost, drunken men... who no longer care where they find themselves each morning. You left some rather sizable debts in America. Diners Club hasn't called in my card yet. Oh, sh-- There were some questions which I was forced to ask. I got no answers. And you want me to join this? There are certain realities. I want us to have a clear understanding. No. There's no misunderstanding between us. Help me. Help, I'm 17! I'm from California. Help me! Please, help me! Mister, come back, please! You have to come back. Please! - Help me! Help me! - Hey, quiet! Shut up! The battle with the guards was magnificent. Your skill is extraordinary. And I was going to ask you to join us. My God. This came in half an hour ago. Why didn't I--? Hello. Put your colonel on. Well, wake him up. I don't care if he's not alone. Damn it all, I don't care who he's with! You bloody well put him on the line! Good morning, Mr. Roper. We have been waiting for you. What's going on? Would you be good enough to participate in this morning's edification? Edification. What are you gonna do to him? Not me, Mr. Roper. You. Bolo? Like you said... there's a point I won't go beyond. I was right about you. We shall strive to be worthy of your sense of grandeur. I will find someone with whom you can fight. Bolo. Quick, go destroy them. Kill! Kill them! Kill! Fools! You have offended my family and you have offended a Shaolin temple. Remember... the enemy has only images and illusions... behind which he hides his true motives. Destroy the image and you will break the enemy. , This is the end Beautiful friend This is the end My only friend The end Of our elaborate plans The end Of everything that stands The end No safety nor surprise The end I'll never look into your eyes Again Can you picture What will be So limitless and free Desperately in need Of some Stranger's hand In a Desperate land Lost in a Roman Wilderness of pain And all the children Are insane All the children Are insane Waiting for the summer rain Yeah Saigon. Shit. I'm still only in Saigon. Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle. When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing. I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce. When I was here, I wanted to be there. When I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I'm here a week now. Waiting for a mission... getting softer. Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker. And every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck Yeah Come on, babe, come on now Livin' life, yeah Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck Yeah Fuck, yeah, come on, baby Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck Oh, yeah, oh, fuck Yeah, do it, yeah, come on Yeah, all right Yeah Yeah, yeah Yeah Yeah, yeah Yeah Everyone gets everything he wants. I wanted a mission... and for my sins, they gave me one. Brought it up to me like room service. Captain Willard? Are you in there? Yeah, I'm comin'. It was a real choice mission. And when it was over, I'd never want another. - What do you want? - Are you all right, Captain? What does it look like? - Are you Willard, 505th Battalion? - Affirmative. - 173rd Airborne? - Yeah. - Assigned to SOG? - Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door? We have orders to escort you to the airfield. - What are the charges? - Sir? - What'd I do? - There's no charges, Captain. You have orders to report to Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang. - I see. - All right? - Nha Trang, for me? - That's right. Come on, Captain. You still have a few hours to get cleaned up. - I'm not feeling too good. - Captain? Dave, come here and give me a hand. We got a dead one. Come on, Captain. Let's take a shower. - Don't be an ass. - Get a hold of him good. We're gonna take a shower, Captain. In we go. Stand underneath this, Captain. I was going to the worst place in the world... and I didn't even know it yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river... that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable... plugged straight into Kurtz. It was no accident that I got to be the caretaker... of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory- any more than being back in Saigon was an accident. There is no way to tell his story without telling my own. If his story is really a confession- - Captain Willard reporting, sir. - then so is mine. - Captain. Good. Come on in. - Thank you, sir. - Stand at ease. - General. You want a cigarette? No, thank you, sir. - Have you ever seen this man before? - No, sir. - Met the general or myself? - No, sir. Not personally. - You've worked a lot on your own? - Yes, sir, I have. Your report specifies intelligence... counterintelligence with Com-Sec, ""I"" Corps. I'm not presently disposed to discuss those operations, sir. Did you not work for the CIA in ""I"" Corps? No, sir. Did you not assassinate a government tax collector... Quang Tri Province, June 18, 1968? Captain? Sir, I am unaware of any such activity or operation- nor would I be disposed to discuss such an operation... if it did, in fact, exist, sir. I thought we'd have a bite of lunch while we talk. I hope you brought a good appetite, Captain. I notice that you have a bad hand there. You wounded? I had a little fishing accident on R and R, sir. - Fishing on R and R? - Yes, sir. But you're feeling fit? You're ready for duty? Yes, General. Very much so, sir. Well, let's see what we have here, roast beef, and usually it's not bad. Try some, Jerry, and pass it around. To save a little time, we might pass both ways. Captain, I don't know how you feel about this shrimp... but if you'll eat it... you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way. I swear, why don't I just take a piece here? Captain, you've heard of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz? Yes, sir, I've heard the name. Oh, Jesus! Operations officer, Fifth Special Forces. Luke, would you play that tape for the captain, please? - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. - Listen to this carefully, Captain. October 9, 0430 hours, sector Peter, Victor, King. These were monitored out of Cambodia. This has been verified as Col. Kurtz's voice. I watched a snail... crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream. That's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering... along the edge... of a straight razor... and surviving. Transmission 11, received '68, December 30, 0500 hours. Sector King, Zulu, King. But we must kill them. We must incinerate them. Pig after pig. Cow after cow. Village after village. Army after army. And they call me an assassin. What do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin? They lie. They lie, and we have to be merciful... for those who lie. Those nabobs. I hate them. I do hate them. Walt Kurtz was one of the most outstanding officers... this country's ever produced. He was brilliant. He was outstanding in every way. And he was a good man, too, a humanitarian man. A man of wit and humor. He joined the Special Forces. And after that his... ideas, methods... became... unsound. Unsound. Now he's crossed into Cambodia with this... Montagnard army of his that worship... the man like a god... and follow every order, however ridiculous. Well, I have some other shocking news to tell you. Col. Kurtz was about to be arrested for murder. I don't follow, sir. Murdered who? Kurtz had ordered the execution of some Vietnamese intelligence agents- men he believed were double agents. So he took matters into his own hands. Well, you see, Willard... in this war, things get confused out there. Power, ideals, the old morality... and practical military necessity. But out there with these natives... it must be a temptation to... be God. Because there's a conflict in every human heart... between the rational and the irrational... between good and evil... and good does not always triumph. Sometimes... the dark side... overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. Every man has got a breaking point. You and I have them. Walt Kurtz has reached his. And very obviously, he has gone insane. Yes, sir. Very much so, sir. Obviously insane. Your mission is to proceed up the Nung River in a navy patrol boat- pick up Col. Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba... follow it, learn what you can along the way. When you find the colonel, infiltrate his team by- whatever means available and terminate the colonel's command. Terminate the colonel? He's out there operating without any decent restraint... totally beyond the pale of any acceptable... human conduct... and he is still on the field, commanding troops. Terminate with extreme prejudice. You understand, Captain, that this mission... does not exist nor will it ever exist. How many people had I already killed? There were those six that I knew about for sure- close enough to blow their last breath in my face. But this time it was an American... and an officer. That wasn't supposed to make any difference to me... but it did. Shit. Charging a man with murder in this place... was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500. I took the mission. What the hell else was I gonna do? But I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him. - Did you check the tank? - Yeah. I was being ferried down the coast in a navy PBR... a type of plastic patrol boat- a pretty common sight on the rivers. They said it was a good way to pick up information and move... without drawing a lot of attention, and that was okay. I needed the air and the time. Only problem was I wouldn't be alone. Mornin', Captain. The crew were mostly just kids- rock and rollers with one foot in their graves. - How old are you? - Seventeen. The machinist- the one they called Chef- was from New Orleans. He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam. Probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans. Lance, on the forward fifties... was a famous surfer from the beaches south of L. A. To look at him, you wouldn't believe he'd ever fired a weapon in his life. Clean- Mr. Clean- was from some South Bronx shit-hole... and I think the light and the space of Vietnam... really put the zap on his head. Then there was Phillips, the chief. It might have been my mission, but it sure as shit was the chief's boat. There's about two points where we can draw enough water... to get into the Nung River. They're both hot. Belong to Charlie. Don't worry about it. Don't smoke. You know, I've pulled a few special ops in here. About six months ago... I took a man who was going up past the bridge at Do Lung. He was regular army too. Heard he shot himself in the head. At first I thought they handed me the wrong dossier. I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead. Third-generation West Point, top of his class. Korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations. Et cetera, et cetera. I'd heard his voice on the tape, and it really put the hook in me... but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man. Like they said, he had an impressive career. Maybe too impressive. I mean, perfect. He was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation- general, chief of staff, anything. In 1964, he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam... and things started to slip. His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff... and Lyndon Johnson was restricted. Seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them. During the next few months, he made three requests for transfer... to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia, and was finally accepted. Airborne? He was 38 years old. Why the fuck would he do that? 1966, joins Special Forces... returns to Vietnam. Hey, what's that? - Arc light. - What's up? - B-52 strike. - Yeah? - What's that? - Arc light. I hate that. Every time I hear that, something terrible happens. Charlie don't never see 'em or hear 'em, man. There they are. Concussion will suck the air out of your damn lungs. Something terrible is gonna happen. Smoke! Secondary burning. Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys. Let's have a look, Chief. It was the Air-Cav. First of the Ninth- That's them. our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River. But they were supposed to be waiting for us another 30 kilometers ahead. Well, Air Mobile. Those boys just couldn't stay put. Hey, kid, come on. Get down. Come on. First of the Ninth was an old cavalry division... that had cashed in its horses for choppers... and gone tear-assing around 'Nam looking for the shit. They'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here. What they were mopping up now hadn't even happened yet an hour ago. Just keeping running by. We're for television. Don't look at the camera. Just keep- Go on. Keep going. This is for television. Don't look at the camera. Just go by like you're fighting, like you're fighting. Don't look at the camera. It's for television. Just go through. Just go by. Keep on going. Keep going. Don't look at the camera. Go on. Keep going. All right, come on. Go. Right here. Yes. Over here. Over here. Where can I find the CO? That's the colonel comin' down! The CO's on that chopper. Lieutenant, bomb that tree line back about 100 yards! - Give me some room to breathe! - Yes, sir! Body cards! - Sir? - Bring my body cards! Yes, sir! I'm the Fourth Tank commander. I got five tanks broken down. We're all right with the tanks. It's all right, Captain. Captain Willard! I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps. I understand Nha Trang has briefed you... on the requirements of my mission. What mission? I haven't heard from Nha Trang. Sir, your unit is supposed to escort us into the Nung! - We'll see what we can do. - Colonel! But just stay out of my way until this is done, Captain. All right, let's see what we have. Let's see what we have. A two of spades, three of spades, four of diamonds... six of clubs, eight of spades. There isn't one worth a jack in the whole bunch. Four of diamonds. - Hey, Captain, what's that? - Death cards! - What? - Death cards! - Death? - Lets Charlie know who did this. - Cheer up, son. - We will not hurt or harm you. - Fire in the hole! - Fire in the hole! This is an area that is controlled... by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. Jim. We are here to help you. - We extend a welcome hand... - Come on. - to those who would like to return... - Everybody in? to the arms of the South Vietnamese government. Get in. Hurry up. Move it out. This is an area that is controlled... by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. Hey! What's this? What is this? This man's hurt pretty bad, sir. About the only thing that's holding his guts in, sir, is that pot lid. Yeah? What do you have to say? This soldier is dirty VC. He wants water. He can drink paddy water. Get outta here! Give me that canteen. - He's VC! - Any man that's brave enough to- Get outta here! I'll kick your fuckin' ass! He killed a lot of our people! Any man brave enough to fight with his guts... strapped on him can drink from my canteen. Hey, Colonel, I think one of those sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer. - Where? Here? You sure? - Down there. Yeah? Here. Repeat. We have a body count. We have- What's your name, sailor? - Gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson. - Gunner's Mate Third Class- - Lance Johnson, the surfer? - Yes, sir. It's an honor to meet you. I've admired your nose riding for years. I like your cutback too. I think you have the best cutback there is. - Thank you, sir. - You can cut out the ""sir"" crap. I'm Bill Kilgore. I'm a goofy foot. - This guy with ya? - Yeah. I want you to meet some guys. - This is Mike from San Diego. - Far out. - Johnny from Malibu. Solid surfers. - John, hi. Far out. None of us are anywhere near your class though. No way. We do a lot of surfing around here. I like to finish operations early. Fly down to Yung Tau for the evening glass. Been riding since you got here? No way. I haven't surfed since I been here. Through Christ, our Lord... from Whom all good things come... through Him in the unity of the Holy Spirit. All glory and honor is Yours, Almighty Father. Let us bring our iniquities to the Father... in the words our Savior gave us. Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Kilgore had had a pretty good day for himself. They choppered in the T-bones and the beer... and turned the LZ into a beach party. The more they tried to make it just like home... the more they made everybody miss it. Make my meat rare- rare but not cold. Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess. He loved his boys, and you felt safe with him. He was one of those guys that had that weird light around him. You just knew he wasn't gonna get so much as a scratch here. What happened to your mission? Nha Trang forget all about you? Airborne. Sir, two places we can get into the river. - Yeah. - Here and here. It's a pretty wide delta, but these are the only two spots I'm sure of. That village you're pointing at is kind of hairy. - What do you mean ""hairy,"" sir? - It's hairy. Got some pretty heavy ordnance. I lost a few recon ships in there now and again. What's the name of that goddamn village? Vin Drin- - Dop. - Dop or Lop? Damn gook names all sound the same. Mike, you know anything about this point at Vin Drin Dop? That's a fantastic peak. - Peak? - About six foot. It's an outstanding peak. It's got both the long right and left slide... with a bowl section that's unbelievable. It's just tube city. Why didn't you tell me that before? A good peak. There aren't any good peaks in this whole shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break. It's really hairy in there. That's where we lost McDonald. They shot the hell out of us there. That's Charlie's point. Sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn. There's always a good offshore breeze in the morning. We may not be able to get the boat in. The draft at the mouth of that river may be too shallow. We'll pick your boat up and put it down like a baby where you want it. This is the First of the Ninth, Air-Cav, son. Air mobile! I can take that point and hold it as long as I like. You can get anyplace up that river that suits you, young Captain. Hell, a six-foot peak. Take a gunship back to the division. Lance, go with Mike and let him pick out a board for you. Bring me my Yater Spoon, the eight-six. - I don't know, sir- - What is it, soldier? It's hairy in there. It's Charlie's point. Charlie don't surf! Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't gonna believe this. Look. Hey, man! They're pickin' up the boat! - How are you feeling, Jimmy? - Like a mean motherfucker, sir! All right, son, let 'er rip. Let's go! I never have got used to a light board. I can't get used to one. - I'm used to a heavy board. - I know, it's a real drag. - You prefer a heavy or light board? - Heavier. - Really? - Yeah! I thought all the young guys like lighter boards. - You can't ride the nose on those. - Big Duke Six. This is Eagle Thrust Seven. We've got it spotted. Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. Put on heading two-seven-zero. Assume attack formation. That's a roger, Big Duke. We're going in. Hey, Lance, we'll come in low out of the rising sun. About a mile out, we'll put on the music. - Music? - Yeah, I use Wagner. Scares the hell out of the slopes. My boys love it. Hey, they're gonna play music! How come all you guys sit on your helmet? So we don't get our balls blown off. Big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. Put on psy war op. Make it loud. This is a Romeo Fox Trot. Shall we dance? Yes, sir! - Come on! - All right. Fire. We got a couple- at that tree line. We're taking fire from the holes. Run, Charlie! This should make everything burn. We got a couple of people ahead here. - What's going down here? - We got an automatic! Shoot to kill! - Shoot to kill in the open! - I spotted a large weapon down below. We're gonna go down and check it out. All right, this is Fox Trot. We're pullin' in. What a shot. Outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding. Get you a case of beer for that. Six-four-one-zero, we're over the village right now. I see a vehicle in the courtyard. I'm gonna check it out. Well done, Hawks. Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan along those tree lines. Ripple the shit out of 'em. Got a vehicle on the bridge, 50 caliber on board. He's moving across to resupply the weapon. Big Duke Six, clear the area. I'm coming down myself. Don't these people ever give up? Nice shot, Bill. - Shit! - All right, all right! - It's just a flare! - It's a flare! Gotta get outta here! Un-ass that shit. Get it outta here! Get it out. It's just a flare. It's all right. - Everybody all right? Lance? - I'm fine! Get down! I'm not going! I'm not going! I'm not going. We just got a secondary down there in the plaza. Hold on to your position. Duke Six, we've got wounded down there. - Get a stretcher over here! - You're all right. - Please, God! Help me! - Give him some morphine. My God! Oh! - Seven-four-two! - Where's that duster? I want my wounded out of there and in the hospital in 15 minutes. I want my men out. Somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke. This is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in, throw 'em on and get out. She's got a grenade! She's got a grenade! The whole thing blew up. - She blew the shit- - Fucking savages. - Get a medevac. - Holy Christ, she's a SAP. I'm gonna get that dink bitch. Get over there, Johnny. Roll that right skid right up her ass. We gotta get some air in these trees. It's goddamn eat-up with enemy down here. I'm taking fire. I'm taking hits all over. Three o'clock! I'm drawing heavy fire! I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday! I'm goin' in. My tail rotor's out. I got control. - What do you think? - Wow! This is really exciting, man. - No! No! The waves! The waves! - Oh, right. Look at that. Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch. Look! Good six-foot swells! Come here, Lance. Incoming! This LZ is still pretty hot, sir. Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else. What do you know about surfing, Major? You're from goddamn New Jersey. Come here! Come here! - Change! - You mean right now, sir? I wanna see how rideable that stuff is. Go change. It's still pretty hairy out there. - Do you wanna surf, soldier? - Yes, sir. That's good, son, 'cause you either surf or fight. That clear? Get going. I'll cover for 'em. And bring a board for Lance. We can't do shit until the boat gets here. Lance, I'll bet you can't wait to get out there. - What? - See how they break both ways? One guy can break right, one left, simultaneous. What do you think? We ought to wait for the tide to come up. - Come here. Look. - Incoming! The tide doesn't come in for six hours! You wanna wait here for six hours? Yo! Chief! Chief! Okay, fellas, quit hiding. Come on! Let's go! - Dick-heads, take off! - Goddamn it! Don't you think it's a little risky for R and R? If I say it's safe to surf this beach, it's safe to surf this beach! I'm not afraid to surf this place! I'll surf this fuckin' place. Give me that R-T, soldier. Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six. Goddamn it! I want that tree line bombed! Big Duke Six, roger. Dove One-Three, stand by. Blow them into the Stone Age, son! - Out! - No, back, no! Let me take care of this. Get that out of here! - I'm sorry. - Come here now. All right. - No, ma'am. Sorry! - Jimmy! Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three. They need some napalm in the tree line. Can you put it down there? Right, One-Three. We're fixin' to fuck with 'em. What's the target? We're trying to suppress some mortar fire off the tree line down there. - Roger. Here we come. - Good. Give it all you got. Bring in all your ships. Put him in my chopper. Get him back to the hospital. No, no, no, you got to go with him. Come on! Go! Go! Get it outta here! Tell my guys I want my board! Big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three. The jets are inbound now. You got about 30 seconds to bomb station. Get your people back and heads down. This is gonna be a big one. Don't worry. We'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry. Give me those shorts. These are from the Air-Cav, a present from me and the boys. I want to see you do your stuff in 'em out there. You smell that? - Do you smell that? - What? Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. Come on. Move it! Move it! Move it! I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn't find one of them, not one stinking dink body. But the smell- You know, that gasoline smell. The whole hill smelled like... victory. Someday this war's gonna end. - Lance! The wind! - Huh? - The wind! - What? It's blowin' onshore! It's gonna blow this place out. - It's gonna ruin it! - Not cool! It's gonna blow out! It's the goddamn napalm! That's what's doin' it! I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel. I'm afraid that does it. The kid's got a reputation. You can't expect him to surf those sloppy waves. - I understand. - I'm an artist, Bill. - I couldn't surf that stuff. - I apologize. It's not my fault. The waves are gettin' blown out by the napalm. Don't get me wrong- It was the bombs causing a vortex with the wind. I accept your apology. But if you could hang around 20 minutes- - Some other time, Bill. - Just 20 minutes! - I'm an artist. - Keep walking. Okay, give it a try, guys. One goes left and one goes right. Look, Lance. - You through surfing? - Yeah! - Wanna say good-bye to the colonel? - No. - You sure? - Yeah! - Get the fuck outta here. - It's the napalm. Just wait 20 minutes! Damn! Fuck! They've been lookin' for ya. - Don't leave without me! - Where the fuck you goin'? Here! Incoming! That's the colonel's surfboard! Hey, get the fuck off me! It's mine! You fucking Airborne! - Lance. - Chef, light up, man. Come on. Let's get high. - Wanna smoke? - Let's do it, man. Light up. Someday this war's gonna end. That would be just fine with the boys on the boat. They weren't looking for anything more than a way home. - Captain? - Trouble is, I'd been back there... and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore. Buddha time. Here. All right, that's great, you motherfuckers. Yeah. If that's how Kilgore fought the war... I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz. It wasn't just insanity and murder. There was enough of that to go around for everyone. I mean, he never was hurtin' for pussy. I'm not here. I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangos. I meet Raquel Welch. I make a nice mango cream pudding. You know, kind of spread it around on us. She's into mangos too. She's like one limb above me. - We're both in the jungle here nude. - Hey, Chief. - Yeah? - Here comes that colonel guy again. You know how hard it is to find a board you like. I will not hurt or harm you. I will not hurt or harm you. Just give me back the board, Lance. It was a good board, and I like it. You know how hard it is to find a board you like. - He's a determined motherfucker! - I will not hurt or harm you. I will not hurt or harm you. Just give me back the board, Lance. It was a good board, and I like it. You know how hard it is to find a board you like. - I will not hurt or harm you. - Jesus Christ. That guy's too fuckin' much, man. Do you think he would have shot us? He wouldn't have shot us on the beach... but he would have shot us if he saw me taking his board. Let's go surfin' now Everybody's learnin' how Let's get this board out of my turret. Sucker. How am I going to shoot him the next time he comes around? Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board. Sock it to me, Lance. I wonder if that's the same chopper. He's probably got them all over the river with that recording. We'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief. Don't worry, Lance. He won't follow us too far. What makes you say that? You think that big Cav colonel wants everyone upriver... to know we stole his board? I didn't steal it! - Captain? - Hmm? Just how far up this river we goin'? It's classified, Chief. I can't tell ya. We're goin' up pretty far. Is it gonna be hairy? I don't know, kid. Yeah, probably. You like it like that, Captain, when it's hot, hairy? Fuck. Maybe you'll get a chance to know... what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio. Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangos now, okay? - Take somebody with ya. - Yeah, I'll take- I'll go with him. Chef? - Yes, sir? - How come they call you that? - Call me what, sir? - Chef. - Because you like mangos and stuff? - No, sir, I'm a real chef. - I'm a saucier. - Saucier? Yes, sir. See, I come from New Orleans. I was raised to be a saucier, a great saucier. - What's a saucier? - You specialize in sauces. Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere. Then, I was supposed to go to Paris... study at the Escoffier school. But then I got orders for my physical. Hell, I joined the navy. Heard they had better food. Cook school- that did it. - Yeah, how's that? - You don't wanna hear about that. They lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib. All of us, you know, lined up lookin' at it. Magnificent meat. Really! Beautifully marbled. Next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons- all of it- boiling it! I looked inside, man. It was turning gray. I couldn't fucking believe that one. That's when I applied for radioman school, but then they gave me- What is it? Charlie? It's a tiger! Son of a bitch! It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger! Battle stations. Lance, up front. - Get on your 60! - Got it. - Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger! - Chef, come on! - Captain, come on! - Let's hop in and go! Let's go! You were right. Never get out of the boat. - Bring that 60 forward! - Why never get out of the boat? I gotta remember! Never get out of the boat! Never get out of the boat! - How many is it? - A fuckin' tiger! - What? - A tiger? Yes! I've had it! I've had the whole goddamn fuckin' shit, man! You can kiss my ass on the county square... because I'm fuckin' buggin' out. I didn't come here for this. I don't fuckin' need it! I don't want it. I didn't get out the goddamn eighth grade for this kind of shit! All I wanted to do was fuckin' cook! I just wanted to learn to fuckin' cook, man! - You're all right. - What happened, bro? You're all right. You're gonna be all right. All right? It's gonna be all right? Never get out of the fuckin' boat. Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Good-bye! Never get out of the boat. Absolutely, goddamn right... unless you were going all the way. Kurtz got off the boat. He split from the whole fuckin' program. How did that happen? What did he see here that first tour? Thirty-eight fucking years old. If you joined the Green Berets... there was no way you'd ever get above colonel. Kurtz knew what he was giving up. The more I read and began to understand... the more I admired him. His family and friends couldn't understand it... and they couldn't talk him out of it. He had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit. But when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him. The next youngest guy in his class was half his age. They must have thought he was some far-out old man... humping it over that course. I did it when I was 19. It damn near wasted me. A tough motherfucker. He finished it. He could have gone for general... but he went for himself instead. Dear Eva... Today was really a new one. Almost got eaten alive by a fuckin' tiger. Really un-fucking believable, you know? We're taking this guy, Captain Willard, up the river... but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him. Come on, baby Thought you might have heard by now from Elwood. October 1967. On special assignment... Kontoom Province, II Corps. Kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces. Rated a major success. He received no official clearance. He just thought it up and did it. What balls. They were gonna nail his ass to the floorboards for that one. But after the press got a hold of it... they promoted him to full colonel instead. Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam. You needed wings to stay above it. This sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of this shit. Expecting us this time? Damned if I know. Hello. Hello. Jesus- Wow. - It goes back up into the truck. - What? We gotta get all that stuff up. Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef? I bet you we can score up here. Check out the bikes, Lance. Yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah! - That's a good one. - Yeah, Sukiyaki. Yeah, man. This is something. - Please! - This must be the guy. Right over there. Sergeant. Sergeant. Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR five- Come on, man! Move! We don't have time. One hour. That's all. What do you want? - Can I get some Panama Red? - Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red. - Sergeant? - Destination? I don't have no destination. I can't do a goddamn thing without a destination. - Sarge? Sarge? - I need a destination! I can't do a thing about it with a destination. These guys are with me. Destination's classified. I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence. Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen, it's a real big night. Eight bucks for that- Hey! All right. Damn. - Just give him some fuel. - You got it. - Dog starts barking. - Hey, listen, Captain. I'm really sorry about tonight. It's really bad around here. Just take this over to the man at the supply desk and you got it. Would you guys like some seats- some press box seats for the show? The show out here. - Bunnies, bunnies. - Playboy bunnies? You got it. You gonna be here? Hey, listen, Captain, on the house. No hard feelings, huh? How ya doin' out there? I said, how ya doin' out there? Wanna say hello to you from all of us up here... to all of you out there who work... so goddamn hard in Operation Brute Force! Hello, all you paratroopers out there! And the marines! And the sailors! We wanna let you know that we're proud of you! We know how tough and how hard it's been. To prove it we're gonna give you entertainment you're gonna like. Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty. Miss May, Miss Terri Teray! Yeah! And the playmate of the year, Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah! Yo! Whoa! Oh, Susie-Q Oh, Susie-Q - Oh, Susie-Q, baby, I love you - Hello! Susie-Q I like the way you walk I like the way you talk I like the way you walk I like the way you talk Susie-Q Oh, Susie-Q Oh, Susie-Q Oh, Susie-Q Baby, I love you Susie-Q I love you! - Come on! - What's the matter? Come on, baby! Grease my gun! I'm ready to powwow, baby! Come on! All right! You're cute. I like you. I'm here, baby! I'm here! Yeah! - You fucking bitch! - Take it off! Take it off! Hey, lover! You want us to come over! - I sure do! - Sign my centerfold! Sign my centerfold! Come on, baby! Goddamn! Start her up. Hey! Get out of my way! Come on! - Will you sign these? - Let's go! Let's go! Hurry! So long! Charlie didn't get much USO. He was dug in too deep or moving too fast. His idea of great R and R was cold rice and a little rat meat. He had only two ways home- death or victory. No wonder Kurtz put a weed up Command's ass. The war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns... who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away. Hey, you know, man, that was far-fucking-out. I collected every picture of her since she was Miss December, Chief. Hey, Clean, look at that. She was here, man. I even wrote to the cunt. She didn't write me back. You can really get hung up on these broads, man... just like that cat in the delta. - Yeah, you better believe it. - What cat? The one that went up for murder. He was an army sergeant. Remember? This cat, man- He really dug his Playboy, man. Dig it. When the thing arrived, he was there to meet it, man. Look at these beautiful fuckin' jugs, man! Yeah, so anyway, he was workin' ARVN patrols. One of them cocky gook asshole lieutenants and shit- One day the gook took his magazine and wouldn't give it back. He said, ""Give me my magazine back."" Gook say, ""You shut up. I have you court-martialed."" - Typical fuckin' ARVN. - Yeah! - Then the gook starts to go too far. - Chef. Take the wheel. This dude started to stick pinholes in the lady's tits. Take the wheel. He started sticking pinholes and mutilating the centerfold. The sergeant said, ""You better not do that to her. You leave your shitty little gook hands off of that girl. Don't do her like that."" - Gook say ""Fuck you"" in Vietnamese. - Damn. The sergeant couldn't handle it no more. He just picked up his iron... flipped it to rock and roll and- Boom! Gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag. It blew his ass clean off of the dock. There wasn't no more lieutenant that day. That was it for his ass. - They burn him for it? - The sergeant? Yeah, man. They stuck his ass in the LBJ. It's too bad he didn't get no medals or nothin'. Fuckin' ARVN, man. They should have killed the fuck. Should have given the fucker a Silver Star. Bummer for the gook though, ain't it? Good morning, Vietnam. I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AMVN. It's about 82 degrees in downtown Saigon right now, also very humid. We have an important message for all GI's... who are living off base from the mayor of Saigon. He'd like you to hang your laundry up indoors... instead of on the windowsills. The mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful. Now here's another blast from the past going out to Big Sam... who's all alone out there with the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry... and dedicated by the fire team to their groovy CO. - The Rolling Stones, ""Satisfaction."" - All right! Watch out, Clean! Get down, bubba! I can't get no Satisfaction Hang on, Lance! I can't get no Satisfaction 'Cause I try and I try - Get down, bubba! - And I try and I try I can't get no I can't get no Yeah! When I'm drivin' in my car - And the man comes on the radio - Tell 'em you did it, Lance. He's tellin' me more and more - I see you is right on target. - About useless information - Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - All right! Look out, Lance! That's what I say ""Commitment and Counterinsurgency... by Col. Walter E. Kurtz. As long as our officers and troops perform... tours of duty limited to one year... they will remain dilettantes in war and tourists in Vietnam. As long as cold beer, hot food, rock and roll... and all the other amenities remain the expected norm... our conduct of the war will gain only impotence. We need fewer men, and better. If they were committed, this war could be won... with a fourth of our present force."" Shit. Chicken time. You ain't shittin', bro. They're motherfuckin'. Who is that? Is that you, Lazzaro? Don't chicken out. Lazzaro! Come on! - Fire on the canopy! - I got it! Get outta there! Yeah! I got it! I got it! I got it! Lance, get down! Put that fucker out, man! What the fuck they think they're doin'? Late summer, autumn 1968. Kurtz's patrols in the highlands coming under frequent ambush. The camp started falling apart. November. Kurtz orders assassination of three Vietnamese men and one woman. Two of the men were colonels in the South Vietnamese army. Enemy activity in his old sector dropped off to nothing. Guess he must have hit the right four people. He joined the Special Forces. After that his- The army tried one last time to bring him back into the fold. - methods- - If he'd pulled over... - it all would have been forgotten. - unsound. But he kept going. - Now he's crossed into Cambodia- - He kept winning it his way. - with this Montagnard army of his- - And they called me in. Man like a god and follow every order, however ridiculous. They lost him. He was gone. Nothing but rumors and random intelligence... mostly from captured VC. The VC knew his name by now, and they were scared of him. He and his men were playing hit-and-run... all the way into Cambodia. I know what I'm doin'. I'm goin' to the White House to have dinner... with the president of the United States. That's where I'm goin'. Hey, Chef, put the cover on that. Clean. How long has that kid been on this boat? Seven months. He's really specializing in busting my balls. Very possible, Captain, he thinks the same of you. - Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief? - I don't think. My orders say I'm not supposed to know where I'm taking this boat... so I don't! But one look at you, and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is. We're going upriver about 75 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge. - That's Cambodia, Captain. - That's classified. We're not supposed to be in Cambodia, but that's where I'm going. You just get me close to my destination... and I'll cut you and the crew loose. All right, Captain. ""Dear Son... I'm afraid that both you and your mother will have been worried... at not hearing from me during the past weeks... but my situation here has become a difficult one. I have been officially accused of murder by the army. The alleged victims were four Vietnamese double agents. We spent months uncovering them and accumulating evidence. When absolute proof was completed, we acted- we acted like soldiers. The charges are unjustified. They are, in fact, and in the circumstances of this conflict... quite completely insane. In a war, there are many moments for compassion and tender action. There are many moments for ruthless action- what is often called ruthless... but may in many circumstances be only clarity- seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it-"" - Medevac, come in. - ""directly- - quickly, awake."" - Alpha, Tango, Tango, Echo, Tango, Alpha. - ""Looking at it."" - Request dust-off. Three, maybe four KIA's. Over. ""I trust you to tell your mother what you choose about this letter. As for the charges against me, I am unconcerned."" Medevac, come in. ""I am beyond their timid, lying morality, and so I am beyond caring."" Medevac, do you read? Over. ""You have all my faith. Your loving father."" Jesus. No wonder I couldn't get 'em on the radio. What a dump. - Hi there! - How ya doin'? Wow. That's a nice little boat you got there. Never seen one up here before. We called in a request for Medevac. You receive it? Medevac? No. We passed a downed Huey with some KIA's. - On your way here? - Yeah. - You goin' up this river? - Way up. - Way upriver? Forget it. - Why? We want to send some people downriver. - Just forget it. - What the fuck was that? - We'll be back in a couple of days. - Yeah, right, you'll be back. - Chief? - Yeah, Captain? Why don't you see what you can do with that engine? - I'm gonna look around. - All right. Hey, don't leave without me. Hey, soldier, where's your CO? Don't ask me, man. Give my clothes back, you asshole! Asshole! Hey, guys, where's the CO? He stepped on a land mine about two months ago. He got blown to hell. - Who's in charge here? - Charge? I don't know, man. I'm just the night man. Just do what I'm told. Shit. I'm just a working girl. What about you, fella? Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam. You mark my words. - Keep it in that condition- - Get off my back! - No, man, I'm telling you- - Lay off! Hey! Hey! Come here! Is that your boat? Come on inside. What do you want? Come on inside. I want to talk to you. Come on! Get out of the rain. Get off me! Come on. Cut this shit. Hey, Chef. Hey, come on. Hey, how ya doin', Captain? I want you to meet some people. - I got your ass. - Your ass is shit. Chef, your ass is shit! You're a motherfucker, man. Goddamn, my ear, you motherfucker! - Get him off me, Chef. - You smart-ass. Hey, guys. I got you! I got your ass! - You ain't shit, Chef. - Hey, fellas. - You pulled my fuckin'- - Hey, guys. I just made a deal with the people from Hau Phat. I negotiated two barrels of fuel for a couple of hours with the bunnies. Whoa. Whoa. Captain! Hey! Hey! You shittin' me? No, I'm not. Grab a couple of barrels and get up to that big tent. Come on! Captain. You're giving away our fuel for a playmate of the month? Nope, playmate of the year, Chief. Warm 'em up, baby! Warm 'em up! Captain, we get in a fire fight and run out of fuel... I want you to tell me how she was. I made a deal for all of us, Chief. How about you? - You got some mamas in there? - Some what? Forget it, Captain. I'll stay with the boat. Hey, Captain! Give me a hand. You know, I got a- I got every one of your pictures. I got the centerfold, the playmate's review... the playmate of the year runoff. I even got the calendar. Hey, oiseau. How come you got a bird? I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens. - Busch Gardens? - I used to train birds there. You are- - You are Miss December, aren't you? - Miss May. Is it coming? - Miss December has black hair. - It's over there. He's not one of my regular birds. Come on. Come on, baby. Snack? Snatch a crack. Come here. Being playmate of the year... is the loneliest experience I can imagine. It's like- You try to express... your feelings to someone and show them your heart- Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act. I'd love to hear about your bird act. But would you mind just puttin' this- Would you just mind putting this black wig on for me, please? And there's this glass wall between you- this invisible glass. They can see your mouth moving. I used to train birds for at least two years- - That's beautiful. - at Busch Gardens. This was cascading over your right shoulder. This was open here. But they can't hear what you're saying. I used to train them to stand on their head and ride a bicycle- Your right hand was- Hey, Chef! - Get outta here, man! - Come on! - Does he want to talk to you? - Later. Give me 15 minutes. You can never really make them hear what you're trying to say. You okay with kind of bending? That's it. Your ass was sticking out just a little- Hey, man, fuck off! Fifteen minutes! That's why I tried so desperately... to show somebody that I had some talent. Little baby macaws. - Have you ever seen a baby macaw? - That's kind of open there. - They're all blue- - Take off, would you? I got my rights, man! They make you do things you don't wanna do- like, this picture here. I started feeling repulsed with myself. You were just kind of bending forward. Your ass kind of out a bit. - I love training birds. - That's it. That's it. That's very- That's it. Voila. You're beautiful. I just want to- You know, I can't believe it. Me, J. Hicks. I can't believe I'm really here. Maybe I'm unfit to have a relationship... with a beautiful, innocent boy. Just think, if it hadn't been for the Vietnam War... I never would have met you, Miss December. Miss May. I wish- I wish I could find... just one person... that could share my point of view. Oh, you kiss like a bird! Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me! Who is that? - You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me! - I love birds! You finished yet? Oh! Fuck! Like a bird! Take me like a bird! Fly, baby! Cock it to me! - Fly! - I can fly like an eagle! - Fly like an eagle! - It drives me crazy! It drives me crazy! Lance, that was somebody's son. Lance, there were things that they made me do... that I didn't want to do. They said, ""Pull the ribbons between your legs."" I didn't want to do it. But they said that was what was expected of me... that that's what people wanted to see. - Who are you? - Well, I'm next, ma'am. Ha, ha! Hell, I didn't know it was a cherry. - Didn't know you never got no pussy. - Shove it, fuckup. Sorry about that. If I'd have known, I'd take you to New Orleans. - Man, fuck you. - Introduce you to- - Lay off, Chef. - Cherry boy, cherry boy. You're a fuckin' dog! Come to New Orleans. I'll get you fixed up, ya prick. Lay off, Chef. You're the only fuckin' prick I see around here. If I wanna play with a prick, I'll play with my own. Lay off! What are you gonna do with it, cherry boy? Chef, I said lay off! Chef, knock it off! Give him a break! What do you think I said? Then give your jaws a rest! This ain't the army. You are a sailor! So get out of that frizzly army-looking shirt... and stop smoking that dope! You hear me? Lance, what's with all the green paint? - Camouflage. - How's that? So they can't see ya. They're everywhere, Chief. I want you to stay awake up there, man. You got a job to do. Sampan off the port bow. Sampan off the port bow. Let's take a look. Lance. Bring them in. Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 16. Clean, get on that 60! What's up, Chief? A junk boat, Captain. We're gonna take a routine check. Well, let's forget routine now and let 'em go. These boats are running supplies in this delta, Captain. I'm gonna take a look. My mission's got priority. You wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it wasn't for me. Until we reach your destination, Captain, you're just on for the ride. - Stand by, Lance. - Come on. Throw the rope, asshole. All right. Come on. Let's bring it over. Look in that forward hooch. Bring the people out of there. Come on! Hurry up, motherfucker! Can couc, you too. - Keep your eyes open, Clean. - I got you, Chief. It's clear, Chief. Okay, that's them. That's them. They're okay. - Board and search it. - It's just a fuckin' boat. - There ain't nothin' on it. - Board it and search it. Just some baskets and some ducks, fuckin' bananas. - Ain't nothin' on it. - Chef? - What's wrong? Search it. - There's the goat and some fish. - Chef! - Fuckin' vegetables- - Get on that boat! - There's nothin' on it, man! - Get on it! - All right! Move it, asshole! Goddamn it! Just some pigs! Look, mangoes! - What's in the rice bag? - Fuckin' rice! - Look in there! - Some fuckin' fish! More coconuts. Rice. Here's rice. - What's in that vegetable basket? - Get out of here! Come on! Check that vegetable basket! - All right! - Shut up, slope! - There ain't nothin' in here! - What's in the boxes? - Look in that rusty can. - Nothing! Just fuckin' rice! There ain't nothin' on it! Check the yellow can! She was sittin' on it. What's in it? Chef! Motherfuckers! Motherfuckers! - Hold it! - Come on! Let's kill them all. - Motherfucking cocksuckers mothers! - Hold it! Hold it! Let's kill all the assholes! Shoot the shit outta all of 'em. - Hold it! - Why not? Jesus Christ. Why the fuck not? - Clean? - I'm good. - You okay, Lance? - Shit! Fuck! Shit! - Chef! - Look what she was hiding! - You all right? - See what she was runnin' for? It's a fuckin' puppy. It's a fuckin' puppy. Give me that dog! - Give me that dog! - No! You're not gonna get it! - Give it to me! - Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole! Fuck you! Fuckin' mango too! - Chef- - You want that? She's moving behind you. She's alive. Check her out. Chef! She's moving behind you. Check her out! All right. All right. Come on, Clean! Goddamn it! She's not dead. She's wounded. Give him a hand. Just take it easy. Take it easy! - Slow down and take it easy. - Chef, wait a minute. - Bring her up. - Is she breathing? She's hurt. She's bleedin'. Bring her on board. We're taking her to an ARVN. - What are you talking about? - We're taking her to some friendlies. - She's wounded. She's not dead. - Get out of there. The book says- Fuck you. Fuck 'im. I told you not to stop. Now let's go. It was a way we had over here of living with ourselves. We'd cut 'em in half with a machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid. It was a lie. And the more I saw of them... the more I hated lies. Those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again... but I felt like I knew one or two things about Kurtz that weren't in the dossier. Do Lung Bridge was the last army outpost on the Nung River. Beyond it, there was only Kurtz. - What do you think? - It's beautiful. Huh? What's the matter with you? You're acting kind of weird. Hey, you know that last tab of acid I was saving? - I dropped it. - You dropped acid? Far out. Friendly! Friendly! Friendly! Take me home! Goddamn it! - Fucking shore police! Shit! - Man, you wanna die? Don't keep goin'! - You fuckin' police! - Don't leave me! Fuck you! You'll get what you deserve! Is there a Captain Willard on board? - Yeah. - Captain Willard? - Yeah. Who's that? - Lieutenant Carlsen, sir. Get that light off me! I was sent here from Nha Trang with these three days ago, sir. Expected you here a little sooner. This is mail for the boat. - Don't know how happy this makes me. - Why? Now I can get out of here, if I can find a way. You're in the asshole of the world, Captain. Captain, where you going? See if I can find some fuel and get some information. Pick me up at the other side of the bridge. Somebody go with him. Chef. I'll go. I wanna go. Man, listen to the music, man. Where can I find the CO? You came right to it, son of a bitch! Get down here! You still got a commanding officer here? - Beverly Hills. - What? Straight up the road, there's a concrete fucking bunker called Beverly Hills! Where the fuck else do you think it would be? - Goddamn it! You stepped in my face. - I thought you were dead. Well, you thought wrong, damn it! I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I? You think you're so bad, huh, nigger? What are you shooting at, soldier? What the fuck ya think I'm shootin' at? I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks out there by the wire. But I think I killed them all. You ain't shot shit. Listen. Oh, shit. He's trying to call his friends. Send up a flare. Think you so bad, huh, nigger? You think you bad, huh? They're all dead, stupid. There's one still alive underneath them bodies. Who's the commanding officer here? Ain't you? You think you so bad? I got something for your ass now, nigger! I got something for you now! He's underneath the bodies, man. Go get the Roach for me. Go get the Roach, nigger! Go get the Roach. Roach. Roach. Got slopes on the wire, man. You hear 'em? Do you hear 'em? Fuck you, GI! We'll bust 'em! Hey, GI, fuck you! Fuck you, GI! Fuck you, GI! Hear him out there on the wire, man? - I kill you, GI! - You need a flare? He's close, man. He's real close. Fuck you, GI! I kill you! Fuck you, GI! GI, fuck you! GI! GI- Motherfucker. Hey, soldier. Do you know who's in command here? Holy shit. Hey, Chief, man. Two guys just got blown off that bridge. You hang on, man. You're gonna be okay. - What's that? - Mail, man. Mail. Later on the mail. Watch them trees. There's no diesel fuel, but I picked up some ammo. Let's move out. - Did you find the CO, Captain? - There's no fucking CO here. Let's just get goin'. Which way, Captain? You know which way, Chief. You're on your own, Captain. Still wanna go on? It's like this bridge. We build it every night, Charlie blows it right back up again... just so the generals can say the road's open. Think about it. - Who cares? - Just get us upriver! Chef, on the bow. - Stand by, Clean. - Let's go! You got one, Miller. Geez, I got some too. Whose package is that? - Shit, you got another one, Clean. - No shit? Wait a minute. - Is that it? - That's it for you. Lance. Mr. L. B. Johnson, there you go. Far out, man. All right. I've been waitin' for this one. I got another one. I got a box from Eva. ""Lance. I'm fine. I'm fine. Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland. Sue skinned her knee."" Man, I wanna get back to Antoine's. ""I remember the time we went up to-"" How could I fucking forget? Beautiful. ""There could never be a place like Disneyland, or could there? Let me know."" Jim, it's here. It really is here. ""There has been a new development regarding your mission... which we must now communicate to you. Months ago, a man was ordered on a mission which was identical to yours. We have reason to believe that he is now operating with Col. Kurtz. Saigon was carrying him MIA for his family's sake... but they assumed he was dead. Then they intercepted a letter he tried to send to his wife."" Captain Richard Colby. He was with Kurtz. Disneyland. Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland. ""Charles Miller Manson ordered the slaughter of all in the home... anyway as a symbol of protest."" That's really weird, ain't it? - Purple haze. Look, man. - Hey, Lance, put away that smoke. - I got a tape from my mom. - Rainbow reality, man. Hey, Chief, get a good whiff. Eva can't picture me in Vietnam. She pictures me at home having a beer watching TV. Hey, Lance, man. Oh, hot potato, hot potato. I'm so glad you decided to join the navy. Eva's not sure she can have a relationship with me, you know. Here I am, 13,000 fucking miles away... trying to keep a relationship with my ass. That's much more than I can say for some of your friends. If this tape is any good... I will have Dad and the family send you a tape of their own. Fuckers! There! Over there! Motherfuckers! There. Over there! Chef, check out Clean! Captain, he's hit. Clean's hit. Where'd the dog go? Lance! Lance! They got Clean. Where's the dog? We gotta go back and get the dog. Hey, Clean. Hey. Hey, bubba. Bubba, you can't die, you fucker! Hey, bubba. And so I'm hoping that- pretty soon- not too soon- but pretty soon I'll have a lot of grandchildren to love and spoil. And then when your wife get 'em back, she'll be mad with me. Even Aunt Jessie and Mama... will come to celebrate your coming home. Granny and Dad are trying to get enough money to get you a car... but don't tell 'em because that's our secret. Anyhow, do the right thing... stay out of the way of the bullets... and bring your heinie home all in one piece... because we love you very much. Love, Mom. Hold on. Throw me the glasses. Lance, take a 16 on the bow. Chef. Chef. On the 60. Fuck me. Cover the captain. Lance. Cover the captain. They're French. They're French. Pick up that weapon! Pick it up! Pick it up! Stand fast. Captain. All right, you men. Put down your weapons. We lost one of our men. We French always pay respect to the dead of our allies. You're all welcome. My name is Hubert DeMarais. This is my family's plantation. It has been such for 70 years. And it will be such until we are all dead. Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller... on behalf of a grateful nation. This food is really wonderful, isn't it? The wine, the sauces. I can't believe it. Hey, can I speak with the chef? The chef speak only Vietnamese. No kidding? He cooks like this and he can't even speak French? Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope. This is Baudelaire. It's a very cruel poem for children. But they need it, 'cause life sometimes is very cruel. As you can see. Attack repels by the family. Just for this war. Vietcong, 58. North Vietnamese, 12. South Vietnamese, 11. Americans, six? Yes. Well, there were perhaps mistakes. May I present Captain Willard. He is of a paratroop regiment. Madame Sarrault. Captain. Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. It was just a little story... about Paris and people starving during the war. They are all around the table, and there was a silence and somebody say... ""An angel is passing by."" So somebody said, ""Let's eat it."" Oh. How long can you possibly stay here? We stay forever. No, no. I mean... why don't you go back home to France? - Back home? - I mean, this is our home, Captain. Sooner or later, you're- You don't understand our mentality- the French officer mentality! At first, we lose in Second World War. I don't say that you Americans win, but we lose. Oh, Papa- In Dien Bien Phu, we lose. In Algeria, we lose. In Indochina, we lose! But here we don't lose! This piece of earth, we keep it. We will never lose it. Never! You Americans. In 1945, yeah... after the Japanese war, your President Roosevelt... didn't want the French people to stay in Indochina. So... you Americans implant the Vietminh. What's he mean? Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong were invented by the Americans. The Americans? And now you take the French place... and the Vietminh fight you. And what can you do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The Vietnamese are very intelligent. You never know what they think. The Russian ones who help them, ""Come and give us their money. We are all Communists. Chinese, give us guns. We are all brothers."" They hate the Chinese! Maybe they hate the American less than the Russian and the Chinese. I mean, if tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists... they will be Vietnamese Communists. And this is something that you never understood, you American. I don't know. Maybe in the future we can make something with the Vietminh. Don't you understand? The VC say, ""Go away. Go away."" That's finish for all the white people in Indochina. If you're French, American, that's all the same. ""Go."" They want to forget you. Look, Captain. Look, this is the truth. An egg. The white left... but the yellow stays! When I was in Saigon, I spoke to an American politician. He explained it very well. He said, ""Look. Yesterday, it was Korea. Today, Vietnam. Tomorrow, Thailand, the Philippines... then maybe Europe."" Come on. Why not Europe? Look what happened in Czechoslovakia recently. Even before Second World War Americans knew exactly what was going on. They don't want that shit to take over! LeFevre! All you white people are shit. They are fighting- fighting for freedom. Freedom? Bullshit. French bullshit. American bullshit. Dien Bien Phu, that serious. All soldiers know they are already dead. You know anything about Dien Bien Phu? - Yeah, I know. - No, you don't. - Not really. - Dien Bien Phu was an error. A military mistake. A mistake? A voluntary mistake! Voluntary! All the soldiers knew. We knew we would be dead. The generals and the colonels believe it's impossible for the Viets... to get the cannon up there in the mountains. But they do. Then they wait for the rain to come. When it comes, no airplane can fly there. And our paratroopers jump at 90 meters. I mean, you know, 90 meters- 70 meters. I mean, that's crazy. No army in the world can do that. And they only do that to be dead with their friends. The French Army was sacrificed. Sacrificed by the politicians safe at home. They put the army in an impossible situation where they couldn't win. The students are marching in Paris... protesting, demonstrating. They stab the soldiers in their back. The soldier would open the grenade, it wouldn't work. A piece of paper would fall- ""Union of French Women."" ""We are for the Viets."" Traitors! Communist traitors at home. Dien Bien Phu, okay. The French is shit, huh? No one care. No one want- Why don't you Americans learn from us, from our mistakes? Mon Dieux, with your army, your strength... your power, you could win if you want to! You can win. You know, I'm sure we can make something here. I'm sure about it, you know? I never do something wrong to the people here. That's right, but the Communist at home have never been traitors. - Communist! - Socialist! Capitaine, good night. He was a Socialist, you know. We can stay. I know that we can stay. We can. You know, we always helped the people. We work with the people. So we can be friends, we are agreed. See, Captain, when my grandfather... and my uncle's father came here... there was nothing- nothing. The Vietnamese were nothing. So we worked hard... very hard, and brought... the rubber from Brazil, and then plant it here. We took the Vietnamese, work with them... make something- something out of nothing. So when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain... we want to stay here because it's ours- it belongs to us. It keeps our family together. I mean, we fight for that. While you Americans, you are fighting for... the biggest nothing in history. I'm sorry, Captain. I will see if your men need any help to... repair your boat... so that you can go on with your war. I apologize for my family, Captain. We have all lost much here. Hubert- his wife and two sons. And I have lost a husband. I understand. You are tired of the war. I can see it in your face. 'Twas the same in the eyes of the soldiers of our war. We called them ""Les Soldats Perdus-"" The Lost Soldiers. If you like, we can have some cognac. I have to- to see about my men and- The war will be still here tomorrow. Yeah, I guess you're right. I noticed you had no wine at dinner. No, I don't drink wine. I do like cognac, but I don't want any now. Thank you. Well... then I- I must drink alone. Will you go back after the war to America? Then you're like us- your home is here. Do you know why you can never step into the same river twice? Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving. I used to prepare a pipe for my husband. 'Twas the morphine he took for the wounds he suffered in his heart. He would rage and he would cry, my lost soldier. And I said to him, ""There are two of you. Don't you see? One that kills and one that loves."" And he said to me... ""I don't know whether I'm an animal or a god."" But you are both. You want more? All that matters is that you're alive. You are alive, Captain. That's the truth. There are two of you, don't you see? One that kills... and one that loves. Can't see nothing. We stoppin'. You're not authorized to stop this boat, Chief. I said I can't see a thing, Captain. I'm stopping this boat. I ain't riskin' no more lives. I'm in command here, goddamn it. You'll do what I say. You see anything, Chef? Why don't they fucking attack, man? Watch it over here, Chief. Got a stump. On the fifties. He was close. He was real close. I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him... as if the boat were being sucked upriver... and the water was flowing back into the jungle. Whatever was going to happen... it wasn't going to be the way they called it back in Nha Trang. - Arrows! - Fire! Chef, open up! Fire! Lance, fire! Chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing. - They're just little toy arrows. - Cut it out! Quiet! Chief, tell them to hold their fire! They're just little sticks. They're just trying to scare us. Quiet! You got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out... because you don't know where the hell you're going, do ya? Do ya? You son of a bitch! You bastard! Lance, get the wheel! You savages! Come and get it! You son of a bitches! A spear? My mission is to make it up into Cambodia. There's a Green Beret colonel up there who's gone insane... and I'm supposed to kill him. That's fucking typical! Shit! Fuckin' Vietnam mission! I'm short and we gotta go up there so you can kill one of our own guys? That's fucking great! That's just fucking great, man. Shit! That's fuckin' crazy. I mean, I thought you were going in to blow up a bridge... or some fuckin' railroad tracks or somethin'. - That's all right. - No. No, wait. Wait. We'll go together, on the boat. We'll go with you. We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay? Part of me was afraid of what I would find... and what I would do when I got there. I knew the risks... or imagined I knew. But the thing I felt the most... much stronger than fear... was the desire to confront him. Just keep movin'. Lance, keep your hands away from the guns. It's all right! It's all right! It's all been approved! I ain't comin' in there! Them bastards attacked us! Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man. Zap 'em with your siren. There's mines over there and mines over there too. And watch out. Those goddamn monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you. Ah, that's a pretty one. Move it right in towards me. I'm an American. Yeah. An American civilian. Hi, Yanks. Hi. American. American civilian. It's all right. And you got the cigarettes. And that's what I've been dreaming about. - Who are you? - Who are you? I'm a photojournalist. I've covered the war since '64. I've been in Laos, Cambodia and 'Nam. Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing. This boat is a mess, man. Who are all these people? Yeah, well, they think you've come to- to take him away. - And I hope that isn't true. - Take who away? Him! Col. Kurtz. These are all his children, man, as far as you can see. Hell, man, out here we're all his children. Could we talk to Col. Kurtz? Hey, mac. You don't talk to the colonel. Well, you listen to him. The man's enlarged my mind. He's a poet warrior in the classic sense. I mean, sometimes he'll- Well, you say hello to him, right? He'll just walk by you and he won't even notice you. Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say... ""Do you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'? If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming you. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you."" I'm a little man. I'm a little man. He's a great man. ""I should have been a pair of ragged claws... scuttling across floors of silent seas."" - I mean- - Stay with the boat. Don't go any- Don't go without me, okay? I wanna get a picture. He can be terrible and he can be mean... and he can be right. He's fighting the war. He's a great man. I mean- I wish I had words, you know. I wish I had words. I could tell you something like, the other day he wanted to kill me. - Something like that. - Why'd he want to kill you? Because I took his picture. He said, ""If you take my picture again... I'm gonna kill you."" And he meant it. See, just lay cool. Lay cool. Lay back. Dig it. He gets friendly again. He really does. But you don't- you don't- you don't judge the colonel. You don't judge the colonel like an ordinary man. Okay, watch it now. These are Americans. Americans! You can feel the vibe of this place. Let me take your picture. Hey, could you hold- Hey, hello. Hello. Could you hold up a minute? Colby. The heads. You're looking at the heads. I, uh- Sometimes he goes too far. He's the first one to admit it. - He's gone crazy. - Wrong, wrong! If you could have heard the man just two days ago- if you could have heard him then, God- - You were gonna call him crazy? - Fuckin' A! I just wanna talk to him. Well, man, he's gone away. He's gone away. He disappeared out in the jungle with his people. - I'll wait for him. - He feels comfortable with his people. He forgets himself with his people. - He forgets himself. - Captain? Maybe we should wait back at the boat. - I think you should- - Okay, Chef. We'll go back to the boat for a while. Yeah, stay with Lance. This colonel guy, he's wacko, man. He's worse than crazy. He's evil! I mean, that's what the man's got set up here, man! It's fuckin' pagan idolatry. Look around you! - Shit, he's loco. - Then you'll help me? Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do anything to get out of this joint. - Good boy. - We could blow all them assholes away. They're so fuckin' spaced out, they wouldn't even know it. I ain't afraid of all them fuckin' skulls and altars and shit. I used to think if I died in an evil place... then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to Heaven. But now, fuck- I mean, I don't care where it goes, as long as it ain't here. So what do you wanna do? I'll kill the fuck. - Get out of here. - I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef. I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around, check the place out. See if I can find the colonel, okay? Well, what do you want me to do? Here. You take the radio... and if I don't get back by 2200 hours... you call in the air strike. ""Air strike?"" The code is ""Almighty""... coordinates zero-niner-two-six- four-seven-one-two. It's all in there. Zero-niner-two-six- four-seven-one-two. Everything I saw told me that Kurtz had gone insane. The place was full of bodies- North Vietnamese, Vietcong, Cambodians. If I was still alive, it was because he wanted me that way. It smelled like slow death in there- malaria... and nightmares. This was the end of the river, all right. Where are you from, Willard? I'm from Ohio, sir. Were you born there? Yes, sir. Whereabouts? Toledo, sir. How far are you from the river? The Ohio River, sir? About 200 miles. I went down that river once when I was a kid. There's a place in the river- I can't remember- Must've been a gardenia plantation or a flower plantation at one time. It's all wild and overgrown now. But for about- for about five miles you'd think that... heaven just fell on the earth... in the form of gardenias. Have you ever considered... any real freedoms? Freedoms from the opinion of others? Even the opinions of yourself? Did they say why, Willard? Why they wanted to terminate my command? I was sent on a classified mission, sir. It's no longer classified, is it? What did they tell you? They told me... that you had gone... totally insane... and that your methods... were unsound. Are my methods unsound? I don't see any method... at all, sir. I expected... someone like you. What did you expect? Are you an assassin? I'm a soldier. You're neither. You're an errand boy... sent by grocery clerks... to collect the bill. Why, huh? Why would a nice guy like you wanna kill a genius? Feeling pretty good, huh? Why? Do you know- Do you know that the man- the man really likes you? He likes you. He really likes you. But he's got something in mind for you. Aren't you curious about that? I'm curious. I'm very curious. Are you curious? There's something happening out here, man. You know something, man. I know something that you don't know. That's right, Jack. The man is clear in his mind... but his soul is mad. Oh, yeah. He's dying, I think. He hates all this. He hates it. But the man's- He reads poetry out loud, all right? And a voice- a voice- He likes you 'cause you're still alive. He's got plans for you. No, no, I'm not gonna help you. You're gonna help him, man. You're gonna help him. I mean, what are they gonna say, man, when he's gone, huh? 'Cause he dies when it dies, man. When it dies, he dies. What are they gonna say about him? What are they gonna say? He was a kind man? He was a wise man? He had plans? He had wisdom? Bullshit, man! Am I gonna be the one that's gonna set them straight? Look at me. Wrong! You. Almost eight hours. I'm asleep. I'm asleep and dreaming I'm on this shitty boat. Fuck. Has it been eight hours? Hello. Almighty. Almighty. This is PBR Street Gang. Radio check. Over. PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty standing by. Over. Oh, Jesus! Oh, Christ! Time magazine. The weekly newsmagazine. September 22, 1967. Volume 90... number 12. ""The War on the Horizon. The American people may find it hard to believe... that the US is winning the war in Vietnam. Nevertheless... one of the most exhaustive inquiries... into the status of the conflict yet compiled... offers considerable evidence that the weight of US power... two-and-a-half years after the big buildup began... is beginning to make itself felt. White House officials maintain the impact of that strength... may bring the enemy to the point where he could... simply be unable to continue fighting."" Is this familiar? ""Because Lyndon Johnson fears that the US public... is in no mood to accept its optimistic conclusions... he may never permit the report to be released in full. Even so, he is sufficiently impressed with the findings... and sufficiently anxious to make their conclusions known... to permit experts who have been working on it... to talk about it in general terms."" No date, Time magazine. ""Sir Robert Thompson... who led the victory over Communist guerillas in Malaya... is now a RAND corporation consultant... recently returned to Vietnam to sound out the situation for President Nixon. He told the president last week... that things felt much better... and smelled much better over there."" How do they smell to you, soldier? You'll be free. You'll be under guard. Read these at your leisure. Don't lose them. Don't try to escape. You'll be shot. We can talk of these things later. ""We are the hollow men. We are the stuffed men... leaning together at peace filled with straw. Alas, our dried voices when we whisper together... are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass... or a rat's feet over broken glass in a dry cellar. He's really out there. Shape without form... shade without color... paralyzed force... gesture without motion."" Do you know what the man's saying? Do you? This is dialectics. It's very simple dialectics. It's one through nine. No maybes, no supposes, no fractions. You can't travel in space. You can't go out into space, you know... without like, you know, with fractions. What are you gonna land on? One-quarter? Three-eighths? What are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus? That's dialectic physics, okay. Dialectic logic is, there's only love and hate. You either love somebody or you hate 'em. Mutt! You mutt. This is the way the fucking world is. Look at this fucking shit we're in, man! Not with a bang. A whimper. And with a whimper, I'm fucking splitting, Jack. On the river, I thought that the minute I looked at him... I'd know what to do. But it didn't happen. I was in there with him for days. Not under guard. I was free. But he knew I wasn't going anywhere. He knew more about what I was going to do than I did. If the generals back in Nha Trang could see what I saw... would they still want me to kill him? More than ever, probably. And what would his people back home want if they ever learned... just how far from them he'd really gone? He broke from them... and then he broke from himself. I'd never seen a man so broken up and... ripped apart. I've seen the horrors- horrors that you've seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer. You have a right to kill me. You have a right to do that. But you have no right to judge me. It's impossible for words... to describe... what is necessary... to those... who do not know... what horror means. Horror. Horror has a face. And you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror... are your friends. If they are not... then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies. I remember when I was with Special Forces. Seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate... some children. We'd left the camp... after we had inoculated the children for polio. And this old man came running after us, and he was crying. He couldn't say. We went back there... and they had come and hacked off... every inoculated arm. There they were, in a pile- a pile of... little arms. And I remember... I- I- I cried. I wept like... some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And then I realized... like I was shot- like I was shot with a diamond- a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought, ""My God, the genius of that. The genius."" The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized... they were stronger than me because they could stand it. These were not monsters. These were men- trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts... who have families, who have children... who are filled with love... that they had the strength- the strength... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men... then our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men... who are moral... and at the same time... who are able to... utilize their... primordial instincts to kill... without feeling, without passion... without judgment- without judgment. Because it's judgment that defeats us. I worry that my son... might not understand what I've tried to be. And if I were to be killed, Willard... I would want someone to go to my home... and tell my son everything. Everything I did. Everything you saw. Because there's nothing that I detest more than... the stench of lies. And if you understand me, Willard, you- you will do this for me. PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty. Over. PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty standing by. Over. PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty standing by. How do you copy? They were gonna make me a major for this... and I wasn't even in their fuckin' army anymore. Everybody wanted me to do it. Him most of all. I felt like he was up there... waiting for me to take the pain away. He just wanted to go out like a soldier... standing up. Not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade. Even the jungle wanted him dead. And that's who he really took his orders from anyway. Come on, baby take a chance with us Come on, baby take a chance with us Come on, baby take a chance with us And meet me at the back of the blue bus tonight Blue bus tonight Blue bus tonight Blue Come on, yeah We train young men to drop fire on people... but their commanders... won't allow them to write ""fuck""... on their airplanes because... it's obscene. The horror. The horror. Calling PBR Street Gang. PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty. Do you read me? Over. PBR Street Gang? PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty- The horror. The horror., - So how was it? - Good. - You're gonna go ahead? - Full steam. Anything I can do to change your mind? Nope. No way. You know, there's an old saying: ""No matter how hot it gets up there during the day... ...there's not a..."" - ""Not a damn thing to do at night."" What the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere? Sleep like a winner. Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom. You'll be back in two weeks. Come in the office for a minute. I got people waiting upstairs. I wanted to tell you... ...Senator Parker's coming to the dedication tonight. He's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract. Do you know what that means? Skyscrapers like this all over the country. You design them. I'll build them. Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex. You'll never leave. After the party, come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie. Glad to see you back. Doug, I can't understand it. The dampers won't stay opened. - Whatever happened to ""hello""? - Hello. - How are you? - Good. You look like it took. - Hi, Mr. Roberts. - Just a second. We'll miss you. - Duncan know? - He's all smiles. - What electromagnets went in? - Doug? - Thompson G-4s. - Don't you think they should be G-12s? That's what comes from last-minute panic. I'll fix it. There's ground water on that Atlanta job. Bring the designs in today. How about Chicago specs? - Philadelphia? - In a minute, guys. Well, hello. Welcome back. Are you taking any calls? Who's there? No, I'm not taking any calls. Are we gonna talk at all? No. It's my lunch hour. Well, I'm not a cheeseburger, you know. You're better. All protein, no bread. All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water. All I need to go with you is in that suitcase. I got about a $ 140 worth of vulgar underwear for you. First things first. That's nice. Years from now, when they talk about this, and they will... ...remember to tell them that it was my idea. Got change for a 50? Sorry, it's the smallest I have. Not a chance! Let's see what we got here... Twenty-five, 50, 60... That's it exactly. Catch your tip next time. All your security squad's up there... Hello, Mrs. Allbright. Hi, Phillip. We won't be so messy tomorrow. We're gonna try charcoals. Mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us? Thank you, but I'm going up to the tower party. Aren't you coming? Mommy says thanks, but she doesn't go to parties since Daddy died. Here, let me take that paint off. Bye. How are you, Phillip? - Sorry, Mrs. Mueller, what was that? - I said how are you? Okay. Goodbye. Okay, I'll get on it right now. I'll have to check the panel. Have to see if all those light up. Mr. Callahan? We still got any G-12 electrodes? - Yeah, main storeroom. - Right. Okay, booster pump, zone one. - One-ten. - Check. Main generator, zone one. I don't get any reading. Try the auxiliary generator. What the hell? Go ahead. Here we are. Are there offices on this floor, as well as apartments? I wouldn't like that at all! The business offices only go up to 80. From the 81 st floor, here... ...all the way up to 120, it's exclusively residential. Now, the apartment I want to show you is 8145... Say, Bill? Tune in the main utility room. Something's screwed up. The sensor didn't trip the fire alarm. Why should it? You can see for yourself. There's no fire. The sensor indicates there is. Plus Wes just called. He said they're having wiring problems down there. You better stay with it. I want you up there with me. We can do good things together. What's the matter? Hello? Dave's leaving. They've offered me managing editor. That's nice. I mean... I guess we've got ourselves a situation. It seems. I want the kind of life you're talking about. I want that. I want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free. But? I want this job. I wanted it for five years. I've worked for it for five years. Now suddenly it's there. See, I have ideas, Doug. I can do something with it that hasn't been done before. I guess I want both, and I can't have both. Can I? I don't know. Where? Be right there. Let's hold this off till tonight. What happened? We kicked on the auxiliary, and this shorted out. Power off? - What about that? - It should've been conduit. Give me a pair of dikes. I know, I know. Callahan called me. Now just how bad is it? Depends on how good your imagination is. Jesus Christ! Specs called for conduit safety covering. How many fuse terminals did you check? How many do I have to? Mr. Bigelow is here, sir. Okay, send him in. Now, Doug, one piece of scorched wire... ...from a burned-out circuit breaker isn't conclusive. Maybe not. But now I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for. Will, Doug... ...J.D., wait till you see this. What happened? Was the wallpaper hung wrong? We have an equipment problem. - No problem in the tower, is there? - Could be. Come on. You're just guessing. I want to talk to your son-in-law. I wanna talk to him right away. - Get Roger Simmons. - Yes, sir. I guarantee I'll check this out. We're all going to check it out. I'm missing something. We damn near had a fire. Yeah, a fire. In this building? Come on. We haven't finished installing the safety equipment. - The party should've been put off... - Hold it, Will! Everybody's overreacting. - Mr. Simmons is out, sir. - Out where? They don 't know, sir, but I left word for him to call. We'll talk to Roger tomorrow. And then we'll decide what to do. - That's okay, isn't it? - Nope. Won't wait. Try zone one again. Damn it! This is top priority. We gotta get these electrical systems on. Our security program's loused up without them. Don't go away. Doug! Well, what a surprise! Where's that electrical genius of yours? I called his office, the club, the marina. No luck. What's he done? Come on, I'll get you a drink. He must've done something. My father called. He hasn't been that upset in years. Have any idea where he is? Well my husband's territory ranges rather widely. It's like that of the timber wolf, anywhere within a 50-mile radius. But if you wanna wait, he'll show up. He has to. His clothes are here. - Can I get you a drink? - No, thanks. I guess you don't plan to tell me what Roger's done. Hi, Doug. - Honey. - Hello. - What are you drinking these days? - Nothing, right now. Well, welcome back from the wilderness. To what do we owe the pleasure? Callahan was testing a backup generator. There was a systems failure. How can that be? It can't be, theoretically. Unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications. That's being rather blunt, isn't it? You betcha. Then you'll understand my being equally blunt. What the hell business is it of yours? I wonder what kickbacks were involved. I don't have to take crap from you. Listen. We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room. Some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for. All the wire I put in is up to code, inspected and approved. Code's not enough for that building! And you know it! I asked for installations way above standard. Buddy, you live in a dream world. I deal in realities. I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders. That would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have! In my office! Tomorrow, 9:00. They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana. Of course, he was younger then. Probably in better condition. You must have enjoyed all this immensely. No, I didn't. Actually, I'm depressed for both of us. What did you expect me to do? Punch him in the nose? If you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you. Baby, I don't need God's help or your old man's. Not anymore. So don't expect me to shake every time Daddy barks... ...even if that's what you want me to do. All I want is the man I thought I married. I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we? It's getting late. Mustn't miss the party. Stand back, please! Everybody, back of the ropes! Stand back, please. Everybody, back of the ropes! Hi. 7:30 sharp. I hope you like your men prompt. At my age? I only care that they show up at all. Nonsense. Be a good girl, Elke. I left you some milk in the kitchen. See you later. Did you find Simmons? Yeah, I found him. Did he or didn't he change your specs? He didn't admit it, but I bet you he did. Payoffs and kickbacks. The only way he could've swung it. Here you are... ...your original specs. Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere. That son of a bitch gave us an impossible job. - Susan. - Hello, Dan. Good evening. - How are you, dear? - Congratulations. It's magnificent. Thank you. I'll meet you out front. - I'd like to talk to Susan. - Right. Find me the architect who designed you... ...and who needs Doug Roberts? I do. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gala evening. The entire city is in a holiday mood. The list of luminaries reads like a Who's Who. There are leaders from society and government... ...stars of screen and television. And now, just arriving, the Honorable Gary Parker... ...chairman of the Federal Urban Renewal Commission. The senator's in from Washington to be here for the dedication. Senator Parker, ladies and gentlemen. We'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm honored to be here tonight. This magnificent building represents yet another landmark... ...in a long succession of landmarks for this great city. I think you've got him in the bag, Jim. - Being here at this historic moment. Thank you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Roger Simmons. Mrs. Simmons is the daughter of the builder, Jim Duncan. How are you? Nice to see you, senator. Shake hands with Mr. Duncan, please. Where were you all day? I wasn't aware the leash was that tight. Later, I wanna ask you a few questions... ...and I expect some straight answers. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor and Mrs. Robert Ramsay. I thank you very much. I hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower... ...tallest building in the world! We'll make it. That's it. All right, Callahan? Hit them. This way. It's really something, isn't it? After you. Come on, Dan. I'm going by the office. I'll be up in a few minutes. I've never seen the bridge look like that. - It's unbelievable! - Astonishing! - How did it go down there, Mr. Bigelow? - Fine, thank you. Good night. Shall I leave you a night line? No, you can disconnect. I've had it with phones for today. Lorrie... Sorry, but I have a letter that must go out. See you Monday, Janet. Gee, I never thought he'd come back here before the party. We almost missed him. It's all right. I'm not gonna do anything tonight. Have a nice weekend. Thanks. You too. Hello. Hi. - Promise me something? - What? If I ever start taking you for granted, do something about it. And what do you suggest? Cut off the phone lines. Pour coffee down my neck. Tweak my nose? I promise. - How's the family? - Fine, thank you. Good. Gary? - Would you excuse us, gentlemen? - Certainly. - I've got a surprise for you. - Politicians don't like surprises. - Carlos? - Yes, sir. - What can I fix you? - Meet Senator Parker. - Great pleasure. - It's an honor, senator. Show him what you've been hiding back there. Yes, sir. - That's all you'll drink tonight. - A whole case? What you don't drink, we'll ship to Washington. - Open a bottle, will you? - Yes, sir. How did you ever come by a whole case? Come on, Jim. It's nothing. I guess you're looking for someone. I am. Have you seen him? I've ordered for Patty. What can I get you? - Nothing right now. Thank you, Roger. - Susan, tell me... What does a girl do in San Francisco when her old man... ...decides to leave for two years? Beats me, buddy. No headhunting? I've had a little trouble making that work. Could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch? No. - You must miss your villa. - Well, yes and no. It gets rather dull in the south of France. Nothing but swimming and yachting, partying and all that sort of thing. And believe it or not, they fight over the few eligible bachelors. Even such old scraps as I. - No false humility, please. - Oh, shall we? I decided to come back to the reality of San Francisco... ...to regain my perspective and my humility... ...and spend more time at the one thing I'm really good at: The stock market. Monte Carlo's losses, San Francisco's gains. Thank you. Do you believe in destiny? I believe in all good things. There must be a reason for my coming back home. Meeting you. This can't be right. It's too hot. You better leave it off. Utility. Wes. Doug, I'm up on 83 with Will. We got a wiring problem. Overloads could be trouble. Shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can. I can't do that. All the lights are on for the dedication ceremony. You mean the whole building? We're taking the overload just fine. Well, shut it down right away. I can't do that without an okay from Mr. Duncan himself. I'll accept the responsibility. Just turn off the lights! What about the lights in the tower for the party? - Not all the power, just the overload! - Yes, sir, Mr. Roberts! We better get down to 81 and check the relay systems. They turned on everything in the whole building. There's something on 81. Phone it in, in case the lines to the fire department are out. - I'll be in 81. - You got it. Get those drapes! Smother it! Try to smother it! Pull it around over here. Put it all over him. Come on! Let's get some water onto that fire. Turn it on! Down, down! Stay low! Call an ambulance for this man. Get on the ball! Call an ambulance! I want everybody off this floor! - The fire department? - On their way. Get that ambulance. Give me a hand. Get him in the elevator. All right, try not to touch him. Try to get him by his belt. This is 81. A man's been burned. Get an ambulance. Yes, right away. Call Duncan in the tower. He's got a lot of people up there. - What? - Do it now! It's Mr. Roberts. Yeah, Doug. We were getting worried about you. Susan's here, Senator Parker, the mayor and his wife. They're asking why the greatest architect isn't here. Never mind that. Will Giddings has been badly burned. Will Giddings burned? How? An ambulance is coming, but you better think about... ...getting those people down on the ground floor. What for? We got a fire here! Well, I think it's under control, but... Well, then why the urgency? Urgency? If fluky wiring in this building caused that fire... ...fires could break out everywhere! Doug, I think you're overreacting. I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of. But I won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81... ...because it can't possibly affect us up here... ...not in this building. Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives. Meanwhile, get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party! What building's on the corner of Montgomery and... Oh, Jesus! - The glass tower! - What? The glass tower! I sure hope that fire's on the first floor. Did you ever fight one in a high rise? Is it as rough as I hear? Like being inside a chimney. Jesus! How in the hell did they get here before we did? Don't anybody ever stay home anymore? - Mike, she's throwing a lot of smoke. - Eighty-first floor, right? We've got lobby control, second alarm is in. - Set up a Forward Command. - Got it. Chief... ...this is Roberts, the architect. - What do we got here, Kappy? - Fire started, 81 st floor, storage room. It's bad. Smoke's so thick, we can't tell how far it's spread. - Exhaust system? - Should've reversed automatically. It must be a motor burnout. - Sprinklers? - They're not working on 81. - Why not? - I don't know. - Jim? - Yes, sir? Give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system. - Floors have 3 and 1.5- inch outlets. - GPM? Fifteen hundred from ground to 68, 1000 from 68 to 100... ...and 500 from there to the roof. Are these elevators programmed for emergencies? - What floor are your plans on? - 79. My office. That's two floors below the fire. It'll be our Forward Command. Men, take up the equipment. Let's go. Architects! Yeah, it's all our fault. You know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor. But you keep building them as high as you can. Are you here to take me on, or the fire? What about the 81 st floor? You got everybody out of there? I wanna see all floor plans, 81 through 85. Gotcha. This is what worries me. Those beams and that glass. Chief, 81 has been evacuated, but it doesn't look too good up there. Give me a list of your tenants. Don't worry. We're moving them out now. Not live-ins. Businesses. We lucked up. Most of them haven't moved in yet. Those that have are off at night. I wanna know who they are, not where. What's that got to do with anything? Who they are? Any wool or silk manufacturers? In a fire, wool and silk give off cyanide gas. Any sporting-good manufacturers, like table-tennis balls? They give off toxic gases. Now do you want me to keep going? - One tenant list, coming up. - Thank you. What do we got? Elevator bank, central core. Service elevators here. Air conditioning ducts, 6 inches. - Pipe alleys here? - One, two, three, four, five. - This is south? - South. Have you got any construction on 81? Anything that can blow up, like gasoline, fabric cleaner? I don't think so. Good. I'll be up on 81. For what it's worth, this is one building I figured wouldn't burn. Neither did I. And they're celebrating. A party. What party? Where? In the Promenade Room. 300 people. Why didn't you get them out? Why don't you go talk to Duncan? He ain't listening to me. I will. Here he is now. This is Duncan. A battalion chief? I'll watch out for him. Thank you. Ted, take your men down to check that hallway. Jack? Jack, how bad? I don't like the looks of it. It's running the ceiling. Work it around. Up there. - I'll be up topside. - Right. Jack... ...watch yourself. Keep it high. - Looking for me, chief? - If you're Duncan. I am. Everything under control? Gotta move these people out of here. Now, just how bad is it? It's a fire, mister, and all fires are bad. You're not familiar with the many modern safety systems... ...we have designed into this building. We've got them all. It's your building, but it's our fire. Now get out. I don't think you're listening. A fire on 81 can't reach up here, not in this building. - I'll do it. - Hold it, hold it. Do you want me to pull rank with the mayor? With a fire, I outrank everybody here. One thing we don't want is a panic. I could tell them, but you ought to. Just make a nice, cool announcement to all your guests... ...that the party's being moved down below the fire floor. Now. Patty, you and Susan stay right here where I can find you. Now, don't leave this table. You, I wanna talk to. Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications? - I most certainly did. - For God's sake, why? The reason should be obvious, especially to you. We've got a fire. If it was caused by what you did, I'll hang you out to dry. And then I'm going to hang you! Would you please stop playing? Stop playing, will you? Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention? It seems that we have a small fire... ...in one of our storage rooms... ...50 floors below. I assure you there's no danger. But in accordance with the fire department's orders... ...a purely precautionary procedure... ...we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while. And we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room. But I promise you, dinner will not be delayed. Now if we can all move to the elevators... Now, ladies and gentlemen... ...there's no reason to rush. Senator Parker, you and your party. It's really all right. Stay here. I'll be right back. - Lisolette! - Frank! Lisolette! - How's it going, chief? - Better get ready. Kappy, get the floor plans on 82. We got problems. Fire lapping? - Are your com lines tested? - Phone jacks on every floor. - I'm plugging into your PA system. - No sweat. - Emergency setup? - Battery-powered standby system. Splice these lines into our two-way communications van. Sure. - No problem? - No problem. - How long will this take? - A minute. Not bad. Here's our problem. The fire's lapping up through the windows. Get down! Get down! What was that? - Come on! - The ceiling's going! Men trapped! We need help! Bring a line! Pull them out, pull them out! Pass the fire hose! Pass it along! Battalion Two to Forward Command. Urgent! Forward Command, go ahead. Explosion on 81, fire headed toward elevator banks! We need more crews up here fast! - They need relief on 81. Hit it. - They're on their way. Done! Tell Duncan to stop those Tower Room people... ...from using that express elevator, or somebody'll get killed. Ring in a third alarm. I want some rescue squads and some choppers here. We may need them to get those people down. Come on, Park. I'll be on 81. The fire's moving toward the main shaft. Use the scenic elevator. Don't overload. I don't like how you talk to me. - You drunk? - Not yet. - Then get out of my way! - You didn't talk like this before. Running over budget and out of money. Did you ask me then to shave $2,000,000 off our electrical costs? Shut up and help these people! - Let me ask, father-in-law... - Excuse me. Did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners? Where did you save the other 4,000,000 in Doug's original budget? Please! Please! Hold everything. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry. Move back into the Promenade Room... ...and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator. Now these express elevators can be activated by fire. And with the probability of short circuits... ...the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is. So please, we'll use the scenic elevators over there. For God's sake, get out of there! Please, back! It looks bad, Jack. It is. I got a couple of men hurt. The fire's spreading. I got a third alarm in. What about this ceiling? Must have just happened. I'll check the other corridors. Firemen, let's pull it down before it falls down. Bring it out! Take it down! Empty all the water out. Chief, it's out of control. Bring in another line! Get another tank! Angela? Angela? Phillip? Phillip, open the door! What ideas can I use upstairs... ...to explain where I've been all this time? Well, what you might do is just... ...walk right up to him and say, ""J.D., I'm sorry for the delay... ...but my secretary had an urgent personal problem."" What happens if he asks what the problem was? He won't. - You know what astonishes me? - What? You make love with a girl... ...and there's no visible evidence. Nothing to mark the event. Look at you. You look like you could be going to church. In this outfit? I love you. Did you leave a cigarette burning? That's not a cigarette. Jesus! Get some towels. Stuff them under the door. Dan? Right. - What'd they say? - Help's on the way. There's nothing to worry about. We'll just sit tight and wait till they get here. I won't panic. Not to worry, baby. Please, just join the end of the line. Oh, no, ma'am. Please. But I can't find my daughter. She's here somewhere. - They're aware of that. - She's wearing a purple dress. - I've got to find her! - I promise, they'll find her. Now, only 12 at a time. I'm sorry. That's it. We'll be in the next group, maybe. It won't be too long. What's she doing on 87? Forward Command? I wanna speak to Jernigan. Harry. Jernigan. What? Damn it, man! You should've sent a man up there! How do you expect her to hear a phone call? She's deaf! Sure, the kids can hear! I don't know, maybe they were in the shower when you called. You stay there. I'll get them down! All my men are committed. I need fresh crews, damn it! - We'll send them right up. - Still got people on 87. I'll get them down. I'll give you a hand. Turn your face away. There never were any firemen, were there? I said that to make it easier on you. I switched off the phones. There's no way to call out. Nobody knows we're up here. Well, I always did want to die in bed. Nobody's going to die. At least they'll never find out about us, will they? I used to run the 100 in 10 flat. Don't go! I'll be back with the whole fire department. - You all right? - The mother and children are in there. - Don't worry. We'll get them out. - Wait! Please, Mrs. Mueller! Please stay back. - What do you think? - I don't know. Give it a kick. I'll take the back. I got Mrs. Allbright. Anybody in here?! It's okay, kid. It's okay. Come on. He's okay. - Mom, Mom! - Your mom's all right. Mr. Jernigan took her downstairs. Anybody else? My sister. Where's Angela? He'll get her. Angela? Angela? Angela, where are you? It's gonna be okay, Angela. Thank God! Hold it right here. Hold it right here. - All right! - That's it. Don't crush. It'll take hours to get everyone down. Those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs. - That's 135 floors. - All downhill. It's closer than they told us. Let's try the south exit. That might be clear. Carlos! - Yes, sir. - Help us get this thing open. Is it stuck? Here, let me try to kick it. - I'll call security. - Yes, sir. Battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm. Where are those choppers, Kappy? Navy's been alerted. Why do they make these goddamn things so heavy? You want it easy, chief? They should design a survival suit for us like for football players. Who pays to see us play? Let's go to work. I need two men up the stairwell to the tower. The door's jammed. I want it cleared. Okay, you got it. Timmy, I want you with me. Get two men with 30 minutes of air. Kappy? Glass will be sailing everywhere. Tell the police to move those barricades four blocks back. - Got it. - Let's hit it. Yo! Security guard. Anyone here? Hello. Security. Say, kitty, almost missed you. Keep away from the walls. There's fire on the other side. Wait a minute. It's a ruptured gas line. Get back! Oh, my God! Is there any way you can get down? I think I can. Phillip! Let him try. There's no other way. Come on, Phillip! Come on. That part's easy. Come on, boy. Easy does it. Get your foot over there. Ease down. Come on, Phillip. Come on, Phillip! It's just a couple of inches away now. There you go. Easy. Easy. Don't look down! Come on. I gotcha. I gotcha. We were supposed to have fire drills, but nobody ever told me anything. They said we would have fire drills. But they never did. It's going to be all right. It's going to be all right. You all right? You know, I had a... I got up, but I'll have trouble getting down. Can you help me? Could you just hold on around my neck, real tight? Come on. Give it a try. Just put your arms around me, and you tell me what to do. Put her legs down. Hold on tight. Hold on real tight, now. Just hold on tight. Hold on. Hold on tight, now. It's gonna be okay now. Hold on! Easy now. - Hold on, Angela. - I've got ahold of you! Get your arms around my neck! Thattagirl. Nurse? Mrs. Mueller, come on! You gotta try! Take it slowly, now. You've got about a foot to go. Feel around with your feet now. Can you see it? Hold on to that pole and grab ahold of my belt. Try to get your hand over there. Come on, half a foot. Six inches. Try to swing now. Just try to pendulum. Can you swing? Come on. Just get to me over here. Mrs. Mueller! Are you all right? All right, let's go. Come on. Come on. I'm coming. I'm coming. You okay? Nobody's gonna get down this way. Oh, God! We're cut off. Well, the only way is up. Come on, let's go. Chief O'Hallorhan? Inside, security phone on the right. - Get me Chief O'Hallorhan. - I'm trying to get through now. Can't we go down? The fire's below us. We gotta go up, underneath the Promenade Room. Come on! Tim, get that phone. Check your ventilating systems over here. I'll send up another truck company. Pull this ceiling, and vent that other side. It's the copter air-control officer. Thank you. Jack, I know you've been hitting it. I'm getting relief for you and your men. Who am I speaking to? Chief Flaker, sir. U.S. Navy, Air Rescue. It's about time. We need your rescue choppers. Right away. Our communications will be near the Forward Command center. No, too dangerous. Stay out of those elevators. Then, sir, we'll just trot up the stairs. You'll just trot right up to 79, huh? Standing by in the lobby. Thank you. This ain't gonna help any! They won't hear us in there. There's 300 people! It's a fire door. It's over 2.5 inches thick. I could crawl through the duct. Will we be able to go with you? That leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down. Phillip, take care of these ladies. They're your responsibility now. All right, I'll tell him. - How is it on 65? - They're containing it. Well, it's still below us. Let's take a look. Okay, watch the electrics. Come here! The master generator's blown. The backup should've kicked on. See what's holding up our starters. What happened? Where the hell are we? Security, this is Duncan. Have the main breakers gone? The whole system's failed. What's the last report on the firemen getting here? Are they on their way? Hold on to me a second. Hold on! Christ! That's one of our men! Oh, God! Go down by rope. Better get it. Sir? We'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit. Why not pry open the doors at this level? I don't think so. I can't make it. I'll fall. I know I'll fall. Then you better go first. That way, when you fall, you won't take any of us with you. Let's go to work. Check all rooms in that corridor. Check this room. Tear it down. See? Just like we taught you in training. Open it up. Of course I read you! I don't know where he is, but if I see him, I'll tell him. - Must be an easier way to get to a fire. - Not for us. - Where've you been? - We had trouble getting here. The Navy flight commander needs you. Just walk 65 floors down? Only five. A freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power. - Got it controlled? - Getting there. You men stay here with the chief. Tell him I'm on my way. Oh, Mike... This one of your men? ""Dan Bigelow."" Nope. Must be a civilian. Okay to O'Hallorhan. He's on his way. Look! There's another one there! Carlos, give me that security phone, will you? How'd you get in here? I'll give it to you later. Give me O'Hallorhan. Anybody'll do. Listen, the south stairwell is blocked. Cement, for chrissake! Can you send somebody up to break it loose? They're on their way? How...? Oh, my Lord, Elke. My poor cat. She's still in the apartment. I'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet. She'll be all right. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. - How're you doing? - We're fine. Glad to see you. That's the door right there. It's blocked with cement. We're gonna have to blow that thing. Mrs. Mueller? It's Mr. Roberts! Mrs. Mueller! Phillip! We hear you. We're gonna blow this door. Get everybody clear. You've got about 30 seconds. Understood? Understood! Okay, ma'am, let's get down there. Out of the way. Please go back. They're gonna dynamite this door. Step back, please. We're blowing the door. Okay, get down low. - What kind of explosives are you using? - It's plastic C-4. Blow a hole in anything. Here, shine this on the bag for me. That's it. Keep it up here. Is there gonna be a bang? Nothing for you to worry about, baby. You'll be safe. Okay, everybody ready? Good going, Brian. You all right? I'm James Duncan. Can we get down that way? No, not a chance, sir. The stairway below is completely gone. Everyone, listen! - Hold it down! - Listen! I've been informed that there's no possibility... ...of using this stairway to get out. Now, I'm sorry. Patty... There's still a chance we can get out of here. Didn't you hear what my father said? You can't get out that way. Are you coming or not? If you have to wait for permission to save your own life, go ahead. - I'm getting out. - Roger, you... Come on! Come on! Let's go. You guys, hose the ceiling. You two, in there! - I guess you thought I stood you up. - It crossed my mind. You sure you're all right? Those helicopters, they'll get us out of here, won't they? Sure they will if there's not too much wind. Some party. Can I get you anything else? The choppers are here, but the winds make a landing attempt too risky. Get some men on top of the Peerless Building... ...and get a breeches buoy to the Promenade Room. We can't shoot a line that far in this wind. Why not shoot it from a chopper? I'll get right on it. - Doc? - Chief, the ceiling fell in on him. By the time I got to him, he was covered with hot stuff. Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right? - There's no way down. - Thank God you're all right. - Oh, Roger, what are we gonna go? - I know what I'm gonna do. Get quietly drunk. If you're responsible for this, I know what you must be feeling. You don't know the meaning of the word. - Responsible? - Feeling! You know about responsibility. It's a family trait. Duncans are big in that department, at least on the surface. That's not fair! I don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty. Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase... ...lift an eyebrow in the exact same way... ...I see and I hear your father. The two of you, one! Like a big tree and a little tree in its shade, where the acorn fell. Roger, I came over here to you because I thought you might need me. Right now... ...what I need most... ...is this. I promised myself if I ever saw you again, I'd make a full confession. No, but thank you. - But you don't know anything about me. - But I do. You're penniless... ...you have no villa in the south of France... ...no antiques coming, no paintings. But, Harlee, I don't care. I'm a cheap tinhorn. A two-bit con man. Not cheap. Maybe unsuccessful. But you see, your heart isn't in it. How can you cheat people effectively... ...if you don't enjoy cheating them? I came here to sell you 1000 shares in Greater Anaheim Power and Light! Is it a good investment? There is no Greater Anaheim Power and Light. Only the certificate I had printed. I think you'd have admired the artwork. Beautiful engraving. I'd like to see it. It's in my jacket. I took the jacket off. It was needed elsewhere. You see what I mean? I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate. Did you hear what I said? Every word. Then tell me you're shocked... ...or at least disappointed. - But I'm not. - You must be! Harlee, I'm not. I'll be right back. Give me a few minutes with Doug, will you, dear? Sure. Will Giddings is dead. He died 20 minutes ago. Oh, boy. I wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow? I thought we were building something... ...where people could work, live and be safe. If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners? Now listen. Any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials... ...were made because I, as a builder, have a right to make those decisions. If I remain within the building code, and goddamn it, I did! Oh, here we go again! The building code. Come on. That's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble! I was crawling around up there. The duct holes weren't fire-stopped! Corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work. And an electrical system that's good for what? I mean, it's good for starting fires! Where was I when all this was going on? Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours! What do they call it when you kill people? - Who is it? - Chief O'Hallorhan. - What happened? - Part of the central corridor just blew. We've got in the fifth alarm. The helicopters? It's too windy. We'll set up the breeches buoy on the Peerless Building. What can we do to help? Move your combustible material away from the window. Okay, gotcha. There's nobody on those drapes. Let's get them. Jake, give me a hand. Did you reach her? The phones are all out. Just a little while longer, and we'll all be home together. If only I could have talked to her. Let her know we were thinking of her. Told her how precious she is to us. She's still such a child. She doesn't even know where I keep the key to the safety deposit box. How will she be able to get into it? I mean... ...if she should have to. The things you think of. Do you wanna help me? - Here he is. - The wind's down a little. We're gonna try for a landing. Get Roberts. Get 10 people on the roof. Have the rest stand by. We're gonna start airlifting. Will do. Put these over there. Give me a pad of paper and a pencil. Give me that brandy snifter too. - Doug, are they going to land? - They're gonna try. We'll send the kids out first, then the women. Number these up to 100 or so. High-rise roulette. High-rise roulette. That's right. - There may not be time to tell you... - There will be. I'll go tell everybody. Pass those out when you're ready. There'll be a lot of wind up there, so everybody stay in one group. Come on. Stay back, stay back! Look out! Roberts! Roberts! Chief O'Hallorhan wants to speak to you. All right, make way. Coming through, coming through! Here he is now. Roberts, I know those pilots are dead, and I... God, it was just awful up there. Listen, our best chance now is the breeches buoy. I told my two firemen to knock out a window. We'll try to shoot a line from a chopper. Hey, one of you guys got a pair of clippers? - Sure, what do you want them for? - I want to try something. Step back. The firemen are gonna knock out the windows. Step back and you won't get hurt. May I have your attention, please? We've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator. There's no power to bring it back up, but at least we can get 12 people out. Which 12? The same group that was up on the roof and two additions. The woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman! I want a trained man in there. All right, let's move it out! Marge! Take this. Take it! You can get out! Go on. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I want you out of here. So you can stop worrying about me? What about me worrying about you? It's the only way you can help me. Help me. If you asked me to go to the North Pole... ...or even the cliffs of Mendocino, I'd go. What if I ask you tomorrow? Please. - Ma'am, I'll take her. - Thank you. Come on, Phillip. I'll never let you go anywhere without me again. I don't want to. Ever again. - I'll meet you in the lobby. - I'll be waiting. We're still a lady short. - You've gotta go. - I don't want to leave you. Honey, I'll make it. I promise you. Have I ever broken a promise to you? Good luck, honey. Please. All set, everyone? Okay, here we go. Out of sight! Yeah, it's coming. Let's untie this, take it off, pull in the rest of the line! Okay, come on. Let's get it through. All right, hold it right there! Bring in another 20 feet of that main line. That's it. All right, bring in a little more! That's it. Hold it now. Brace yourselves. Watch your heads! Grab it! Take it back and secure it! All right, let it go! Let it go! All right, go on! Take it out! Okay, take ahold. How about the main line? Secured? Good! Chief! Explosion above 110... ...blew the elevator off its track. It's hanging by a cable. - How many people in it? - Loaded. I'd say about 12. What're you gonna go? Flaker. - Flaker! - Sir? Can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable? Have them pick me up on the Peerless Building. Got it. Try and get a hitch on that elevator. Drop it down to the deck by the chopper. Mommy, Mommy! I won't cry if you won't cry. It's all right. Yeah, take it up out of there. Pull it. Come on! Tie it over there. Okay, let her go! Look out below! Come on. Okay, that's it. All right! There's one in there! Come on! Pull it in! All right, let's haul that chair in! Come on! That's it! All right, keep it going! All right, hold it right there. Who's next in order? I am. I am! - Come ahead! - I can't do that. Yes, you can. - I can't! - Yes, you can. Oh, God! Don't let go of me! Don't let go of me! Don't let me fall! Don't let go! Don't let go of me! Get me out, please! Hold it right there. Okay, lower the cable. Grab that hook! Steady. What about the torch? Lash it tight. - This is O'Hallorhan. - We read you, chief. Pick me up with the hook... ...and set me down on the scenic elevator. Then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street. Can you handle the weight? I think we can handle it. We'll find out in a hurry. Watch it! Take it away! How much time do we have? I wish I knew. Goddamn it, Jim, you built the place! I just don't think that all of us are gonna make it. Well, I guess I'm next. I don't suppose you'll let me stay. Come on. I'll see you soon. I love you. Let it go! You think this'll hold it? It'd better. We have to cut the elevator cable. - What's your number? Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now. - You'll be all right. - Tell my husband I'm all right. - Tell him I'll be all right. - I will. - And I'll see him at home later. - I will. Let's go. Oh, my God, you're all right! Thank God you're all right! Watch the ladder. Hey, Mike... ...deputy wants to see you. Mike, we've been checking the situation in the Promenade Room. We figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left, if that. It'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy. They'll die up there if something's not done. We might have the answer. Johnson's a structural engineer. Tell the chief your calculations. The structural strength of the joists in that room... ...could definitely withstand the explosion. What explosion? Chief, we've got the copter ready. Wait a minute. We'll handle that. Just get back to your job. Yes, sir. What explosion? We can blow the tanks two floors above the Promenade Room. They hold 1,000,000 gallons of water. That's enough to drown the fire. - You're crazy. - Mike, it's the only way. You could kill everybody up there. I don't think so. You don't think? When you take into account the stress factors, the design... Wait a minute. Just hold it. We've already made the decision. Someone has got to go up there, rig the charges and blow them. There's only two people qualified for that. You and Conners. They just brought Conners down. He's on his way to the burn center. Under the circumstances, we can't order you to go up there. I'm just laying it out for you. But you... You see how it is, don't you? How do I get back down? Oh, shit! The women are gone. We are going next. You've all got numbers. And you're gonna take your turn. And if it's any consolation... ...I'll be the last one out of here along with my son-in-law. It's out of control. And it's coming your way. You got about 15 minutes. Now, they want to try something. They wanna blow those water tanks above you. They think it'll kill the fire. How are they gonna get the explosives up here? They'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up. Hang on, I'll tell them. They want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us. We'll eat a lot of water and concrete, but if they don't try it, we'll burn. The fire's out of control. They think we got maybe 15 minutes. This way, some of us might survive. We got no options. Come on. Let's go. Get that line. Get off! - You crazy bastards! Drop this line! - Let go of me! Drop the line. It's not gonna work. It won't hold everybody! Get off! Get off! - Get the hell out of there! - Go! Get off. Chief. We lost the breeches buoy. It was panic up here. It's under control now. I'll try and set down on the roof. I'll need you up there. I know where to place the charges, but I don't know how. I know how. See you up there. You'll have to tie yourselves down. Ropes, tablecloths, belts... ...anything you can find! - Carlos! - Yes, sir. Get some knives. There we go. For God's sakes, Carlos. Don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass. That's the '29. Try it. It's okay. Doug... ...I never thought this could happen. Sure. - How much time you think we got? - Ten minutes, maybe less. We'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks, you know. All right. This is your detonator. You're running instantaneous. I'm running delayed. Here you go. This is your explosive. This is the timer. Later on, after you throw the wire... ...we'll plug it and splice it into the timer, set it, and it blows. Set your explosive like this. Take your detonator, pull the plug. Toss it. - Got it? - I got it. - Good luck. See you later. - Okay, thanks. Here you go. What will you set it for? Five. I think we can make that. That's it. Tie yourselves down, goddamn it! You'll never make it through there. How much time? Three and a half. Here. Here. I'm burning up! Let's go! Fireman? Bob! Bob! Excuse me. She was in the elevator with you. The fine-looking lady. Mrs. Mueller. Have you seen her? I'm sorry, she's dead. Lisa! Lisa! - Claiborne! - What? I didn't want you to see him. You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead. All I can do now is pray to God... ...that I can stop this from ever happening again. I don't know. Maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is. Kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world. You know, we were lucky tonight. Body count's less than 200. One of these days, they'll kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps. And I'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies... ...until somebody asks us... ...how to build them. Okay. I'm asking. You know where to reach me. So long, architect.

None we know of, 'cept out in Missouri someplace. - Missouri... - Seems you got the child's jaw. No, ma'am, just a friend of her mama's, just passing through town. If ever a child needed a friend. ""...will I bless the Lord. ""Amen."" Amen. Amen, Essie Maye. I just know your ass is still warm. Would you like some water, Addie? We'll get the child some water. Bless you child, I just want to pay my respects to your mama. Well, I'm going to have to be going. It's a long way to St. Louis. - St. Louis? You mean in Missouri? - Yes, ma'am. I... I sell the good book, ma'am. Just moving through the country with the Lord's good news. Addie, child, don't you have your Aunt Billie living in St. Joseph? St. Joseph, Missouri. It's her poor mother's sister. - The child's only known relative. - That so? You're driving your chariot to Missouri, sir. You could deliver this child to her kin folk. Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a chariot, Reverend. - I'll write the women a letter tonight. - Hold it, hold it. I have to think upon this, you know, uh... I mean, I may have to make a few stops along the way. I never travelled with no child before. - But you're going that way. - The child's got no place to go. Well... The eyes of the Lord... Expect I have no choice, do I? - Hallelujah! - God works in mysterious ways. Don't he now? Come on, Addie. Better get your things together. This nice man's going to take you to your aunt. - How come you're taking me? - Huh? How come you're taking me? Because I'm going that way, honey. Although, I do want to make just one stop before we leave town. Got a little business to take care of. - You know my mama real good? - Oh, pretty good. You just stay out here till I come for you. Don't you say a word unless I ask you to. Mr Robertson? - That's right. - I'd like a minute of your time. - Not buying today. - Oh, not selling. Just want you to meet somebody, Mr Robertson. Only take a second. So what? - Tell him your name, honey. - Addie. - Addie what, honey? - Addie Loggins. You done real fine. I'll be out in a minute. Ain't she a sweet child? No, she ain't a sweet child. Well, maybe she don't seem sweet right now. That's because she's sad. That is with her mama being dead, what with your brother getting drunk and driving into that tree like that. What are you trying to pull? Get out of here! All right, I'm going, but let me tell you where I'm going to go. I don't care where you're going to go. I'm going to go see Mr J.T. Faraday. Now, you know who Mr J.T. Faraday is? He's one of the biggest lawyers in Kansas. And he don't favour the man with the money, he favours the man without it. And you know what's gonna happen to your brother? There's gonna be a lawsuit against him. You know what happens then? Everything's gonna be just tied up in knots, just sitting there. That's his banking money, his house, everything he owns. Including half this plant. Now, don't think that poor child ain't entitled, 'cause she is. I was thinking... couple a thousand dollars would be acceptable. Couple of thou? I'll give you 200. It's a deal. There you are. That'll be, uh, $67.54. You sure these tyres are new? Now, we'll have you to St. Jo in no time. What time's the next train to St. Joseph? St. Joseph? Let's see here. That'll be the 4:14. Change trains in Kansas City, and that'll put you into St. Jo at 9:52am. I want one child's price ticket. That will be $11.45. I want you to send this here telegram to Mrs Billie Roy Griggs, Cosmo Road, St. Joseph. Train arriving 9:52am, and bringing love, affection and $20 cash. Oh, make that $25 cash. And sign it just Addie Loggins. Ten words, that will be 85 cents more. That will be 12 and 30. 12 and 30, huh? Uh, you better say in that message there, love, affection and $20 cash. Love, affection and $20 cash. Now, here's your ticket, and here's $20 for your Aunt Billie. Well, we got till 4:15. I don't suppose you can wait here by yourself, can you? You hungry? You want a Nehi and a Coney Island? - Ain't you gonna eat it? - I ain't hungry. D'you worry about going on the train? You'll like the train. Don't worry about it. Before you know it, you'll be asleep in your aunt's house, all your troubles will be over. - So eat your Coney Island. - She don't even know me. - She's going to know you now. - She ain't gonna want me. What are you making trouble for? She ain't even seen you, yet. - She never even cared for my mama. - Nobody didn't care for your mama. - And she was her sister. - Your mama was a fine woman. Everybody said she weren't. Well everybody don't know your mama, do they? How good you know my mama? Good enough to know you can be real proud of the happiness she give to people. Now, eat your Coney Island. You meet my mama in a bar room? Where would you get a question like that? I hear Miss Ollie talking, the neighbour lady. Says one of you's my pa. Well, don't the world have a wild imagination? Eat your Coney Island. You my pa? Of course I ain't your pa. I'll get you some relish. A Coney Island ain't no good without relish. Look, I know how you feel. I lost my ma, too. I even lost my pa. I don't even know where my sister is. I wish I could tell you I'm your pa, but it just ain't like that. You met her in a bar room. Just because a man meets a woman in a bar room don't mean he's your pa. Eat your Coney Island. Well, then, if you ain't my pa, I want my $200. What's that? I want my $200. I heard you through the door talking to that man. It's my money you got, and I want it. Now, you... you just hold on a second. I want my money. You took my $200! - Will you quiet down, you hear? - I want my $200! Hold on, now, just hold on. Let me explain something to you. It ain't as if you was my pa. That'd be different. Well, I ain't your pa, so just get that out of your head. I don't care what those neighbour ladies said. - I look like that. - You don't look nothing like me. You don't look any more like me than you do that Coney Island. Eat that damn thing, you hear? - We got the same jaw. - Lots of people got the same jaw. - It's possible. - No, no, it ain't possible. - Then I want my $200! - All right! All right, maybe we got the same jaw, but same jaw don't mean same blood. I know a woman looks like a bullfrog, but that don't mean she's its mother. - You met my mum in a bar room. - For God's sakes, child! You think everybody gets met in a bar room gets a baby? It's possible. Anything is possible, but possible don't make it true. Then I want my money! Will you quiet down? You know what the trouble is with you? You got no appreciation. All right. Maybe I did get a little money from that man, and you're entitled to that, but I'm entitled to my share for getting it for you, ain't I? And where do you think you'd be without me? You think them folks would spend a penny to send you east? No, sir. But who got you a ticket to St. Jo? Who got you a Nehi and a Coney Island? And threw in $20 extra, not to mention 85 cents for that telegram. You wouldn't have had any of that without me. Now, I didn't have to take you, but I took you, didn't I? All right, I think that's fair enough. We're both a little better off. You get to St. Jo, I get myself a little better car. Fair is fair. Now, drink your Nehi, and eat your Coney Island. I want my $200. I don't have your $200 no more, and you know it. If you don't give me my $200, I'm going to tell a policeman how you got it, and he'll make you give it to me, 'cause it's mine. But I don't have it. Then get it. How we doing, Angel Pie? We going to have a little dessert when we finish up our hot dog? I don't know. What do you say, Daddy? Why don't we get Precious a little dessert if she eats her dog? Her name ain't Precious. I want my money back on this here ticket, and I want you to send this here telegram. Trip delayed, but I'm coming real soon! You just lie down in the seat and be quiet. Folks don't take to children when they're doing business. - Yes? - Good afternoon, ma'am. - Is Mr Rudolf Morgan at home, please? - Mr Morgan? Yes, ma'am. My name is Pray, Moses Pray, Kansas Bible Company. He'll know. Oh, I'm sorry. Mr Morgan has passed on. Oh, ma'am, I'm... I just... I don't know what to say. Uh, what was it you were seeing him about? - Well, he ordered this here bible from... - Bible? Rudolph ordered a bible? Yeah, he ordered this here deluxe edition with the lady's name in the corner. Lady's name? Oh, I expect some special gift for a family friend. But under the circumstances, I'll just give you back Mr Morgan's dollar deposit, and there won't be no further obligation. Ma'am, I just don't know how to put into words the sense of sorrow that I feel. What, what... what name is in the corner? I don't really know what name Mr Morgan had put in the corner, ma'am. Let's see, now. It's here somewhere. I've got it. Uh... Here it is. - Pearl... - Pearl. I'm Pearl. Well, he must have got this here good book for you, ma'am. Yes. Yes, he bought it for me. Of course, now, you're not obliged to take it. Of course I'll take it. There's just one thing. You see, I... I told him that I could sell him a cheaper bible, but no, naturally he wanted the best, the best, of course, being the deluxe edition with the lady's name printed in child-in-the-manger gold letters. Oh, he would. Bringing a balance due of, uh... Well, that's, uh, $8.00 minus the dollar deposit, making it $7.00. Um, I'll go get my purse. - Well, you're not obliged to take it, now. - Of course I'm obliged! He ordered the deluxe! 'But cold or no cold, it's good to be back in old Manhattan. 'Well, tell me, Jack, you've been in town now since Thursday. - 'What have you been doing with yourself?' - 'Oh, I've had a lot of fun, Don. 'I saw some shows, went to a couple of nightclubs, 'and last night, I was invited over to Fred Allen's apartment for dinner.' - 'Oh, Fred Allen, eh?' - 'Yeah, he and I are pretty good friends now.' 'Well, I'm glad to hear it. Has Fred got a nice apartment?' 'Oh, how could I tell, Don, 'with all that laundry hanging in the living room?' Ain't you gonna go to sleep? Don't you want to hear Jack Benny? No. 'I don't want to sound catty...' You're too young to smoke. You're going to set this whole place on fire. I now owe you $103.72. Seventy-four. I always knew Someday I'd accompany you Along Flirtation Walk A dream foretold A story that you would unfold That lives forever and never grows old I always felt That your little heart would melt Along Flirtation Walk... Frank D. Roosevelt said we're all feeling a lot better. He did, did he? Made me feel good when he said that. Better than I've felt in a long time. Bet old Frank sure does wish he was 21. You don't like me, do you? No, I don't like you. Yes? Afternoon, ma'am. I was wondering if Mr Bates might be at home. Mr Bates is dead. He died over a week ago. Oh, you mean he passed over, ma'am? Why, I was just talking to him not less than a month ago. - What was it you wanted? - Well... My name is Pray, Kansas Bible Company. I'm just here to deliver this bible that Mr Bates ordered. Bible? Who is it? What's the trouble? Something about Benjamin buying a bible. Bible? What kind of bible? He said he talked to Benjamin, less than a month ago. Well, I'm... I'm not exactly sure of the dates, ma'am. Well, I don't see how. Benjamin didn't go nowheres near that shop for more than a month before he died. Well, I may be a little mixed up on the dates. What company you say you're from? The Kansas Bible Company, out of Wichita. Kansas Bible Company? I ain't never heard of no Kansas Bible Company. Daddy... Can't we go now? I want to get to church and pray for Mama. Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure we can, honey. Daddy was just fixin' to leave. This here is my little girl. It's just the two of us now. - My Mama's gone to the Lord. - Oh, so has poor Mr Bates, honey. I'll just, uh, give you back his dollar deposit, and you let us know if there's anything we can do. Hold on, there. Wait one damn minute. He actually done ordered a bible, huh? Uh, he sure did. Here it is, right here in gold for somebody named ""Marie"". - That's her. She's Marie. - Oh, she sure did mean a lot to him. He especially had me get the deluxe edition. - How much to keep this here book? - Oh, well, that one is the... It's the $12 one, Daddy. Uh, yeah, well, honey, we have to have a little goodness in our hearts, - I mean, considering the circumstances. - Never mind the circumstances. And if it'll make that woman happy, I'll take it. You owe me $85.74. 'I mean, we're going to Washington on the QT. 'Molly, she says we can't go on the QT, we've got to take the Pennsylvania. 'Hey, I'd better get going. 'Hey, Molly, where's my suitcase? Do you know?' 'Uh, I'm sure I don't know, McGee. You had it last night.' 'Oh, I know where it is. It's right here in the hall...' He's going to open the closet! Now he's going to say how he's got to straighten the closet out! 'Got to straighten out that closet one of these days.' How'd you like to do a little business with me? You mean instead of paying me back? Now, don't get nervous. I'll pay you back. I'm just saying, while we're heading east, how'd you like to do a little business together, that's all? Well, you're looking at me like I'm out to cheat you or something. I am offering you a business proposition. Take it or leave it. And turn off that radio! You're like to drive us all deaf with that radio. '...in an average way, of course.' OK, I want you to remember one thing: I decide on the price. Maybe you don't know French, but there's something in this world called ""fine-esse"". $12! I never sold no bible for $12. That man was a law officer. You could've had me put me in jail. We got it, didn't we? I don't care if we got it. Don't you go making the decisions. I make the decisions. All you got to do is look like a pretty little girl. You ain't got something like a ribbon in that cigar box, do you? I got my mum's kimono in my suitcase, Chinamen with umbrellas. That ain't quite what I had in mind. You look real nice in that ribbon. First off, I didn't know was she a boy or a girl? I'm a girl. Well, it makes all the difference. Ain't she got a sweet little face, somehow. Well, seeing how I just got paid today, we'll take a ribbon in each colour. How much that going to set me back? Well, that'll be 15 cents. Bought my grandchildren ribbons just like this last holiday time. Grandchildren? I don't believe it. - You break a five? - Well, you can believe it, all right. I'm just as old as I look. Well, now, here you be. That's one, two, three, four, five. This old wallet of mine is about to bust its sides. I'll give you five ones back, you give me that $5 bill. How many grandchildren you got altogether? Well, I got two little granddaughters, a nine-year-old, a ten-year-old, two grandsons near 16, and I got a grandson 35 years old. Come on, you're pulling my leg. Why don't you just give me a $10 bill? Here's the $5, and five ones, there. That way I won't be so quick to see it break apart. - Six children, huh? My, my, my... - I've got a daughter, 51. Oh, now, I don't mean to be handing you no line, but that's just pretty hard to believe you got a 51-year-old child. You can believe it, all right. Well, I'm afraid I'd have to see it to believe it. Much obliged. - See you again. - Y'all come back! That just don't seem quite right... somehow. - Yes? - I'm looking for Mr Stanley, ma'am. Mr Stanley's dead. Oh, well, I'm looking for Mr Warren M. Stanley, ma'am. Warren's passed on, sir. Oh, that's hard to believe. I was just talking to Warren not more than two weeks back. He ordered this here bible from me. Warren spent money on a bible? Yes, ma'am, with the name Elvira in the corner. Why would Warren spend money on a bible? He took fast to the idea, ma'am. Only thing is, he left a balance due of, well, let's see, not counting the dollar deposit... Daddy, this one's already paid for. Mr Stanley paid for the whole thing, don't you remember? Afternoon, ma'am. Mr Huff at home? Mr Huff passed away, young man, a week ago. Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I was just talking to Mr Huff not more than a month ago. What was it you wanted? Oh, well, my name is Pray, Kansas Bible Company. Mr Huff ordered this bible as a gift for someone named Edna. Oh, that's my name. You don't have to take it if you don't want to. I'll just give you back Amos's dollar deposit and then... Of course I want to keep it. He bought me a bible. Yes, ma'am. Now, I told Amos I could sell him a cheaper one, but no, naturally, he wanted the best, the best, of course, being the deluxe edition with the name printed in child-in-the-manger gold letters, - bringing up a balance due of... - ...of $24! $24. I'll get my purse. What's your name, honey? - Addie. - Addie. What a sweet little name. Addie Pray, ma'am. Well, Addie Pray, I'm going to give you $24, and an extra $5 for just coming to my door. - Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. Keep your sunny side up, up Hide the side that gets blue... - Moze, let's give him some money. - No. Just a little bit. We got $305.16. Whole 'nother business giving it away. - It's bad enough you give away bibles. - But they're poorly. The whole country's poorly, I told you before. But Frank D. Roosevelt says we got to look out for one another. I don't care about Frank D. Roosevelt. - But he says it. - That so? Why don't you ask Frank D. Roosevelt what he thinks about taking care of himself? You think he don't eat off silver trays? He could eat off table tops like the rest of us, but he don't. You know why? Because that would make him look common. And besides, Frank D. Roosevelt ain't running this thing - I'm running it! So don't you make up no rules about what we're going to give away. It's my money too, you know. $200 belong to me, - and don't you forget that. - You want it? Well, just put my share in my pocket, and I'll take you to a train station. How do you like that? Get the map. Find out where the nearest depot is. Nothing but trouble, anyway. First you charge too much, then you want to give it away. - Where are we now? - We just left Plainville. $12 for a bible, then it's up to $24. If I stay with you, I'll spend the rest of my life in jail. There's a depot in Lincoln. You can take me to Lincoln. You bet I will! - Where's Lincoln? - Clear over there. Oh, boy, you think I'm going to take you clear over there just to get you to some depot? Then keep going east. We'll hit one in Sylvan Grove. - Where's Sylvan Grove? - Right here. Well, that'll take us down through Lucas. We got to go through something to get to Sylvan Grove. I'm not complaining. I'm just saying that'll take you through Lucas. You got to go through Paradox and Waldo and Lorraine and Lucas if you want to get to Sylvan Grove. Those are pretty good towns in there. We could do some business in there. Well, it won't matter much. We're near out of bibles anyway. What do you mean, we're out of bibles? Why didn't you tell me we're out of bibles? You look in the box too, don't you? - Well, you've got an excuse for everything. - 'Cause you blame me for everything. If we were running out of bibles, you should have told me. - We're running out of bibles! - Well, then we got to get new ones! - Then let's get new ones! - We can pick some up in Great Bend. - Great Bend's the other way. - Well, we gotta have bibles, don't we? Let's see, now, we can veer down to Lucas, and we'll veer over to Wilson. Veer off to Lorraine and Bushton. And we could veer off to Hoisington. We'll just have to keep on veering, that's all. - I'm getting hungry. You getting hungry? - Uh-huh. Just one more chance To prove it's you alone I care for Each night I say a little prayer for... You sweet thing. Don't you tell me that. Ooh! Sometimes I just don't know, with all the old doodly-doo. Doodly-doo, doodly-doo. OK, now, you go on back, now. I'll see you another time. - Don't send me back. - Oh, you got to go on back. - I'll see you another time, I promise. - I want to go in your place. No, no. You trying to keep secrets from me? You got diamonds and rubies in there? Go on, go on. Oh, Fido... Night-night, old Fido. - Woof-woof. - Woof-woof. Woof-woof. Still I'm holding on awhile You'll give me just one more word There it is. - Much obliged. - Thank you, sir. All right, boy, you're next. I ain't a boy. - Aw, don't let it bother you. - It ain't funny. No reason to get that sore. - He called me a boy, didn't he? - He just got mixed up, that's all. He did not. He looked me straight in the eye. Yeah, well, I'm looking you straight in the eye, and I think you're beautiful. - Oh, you're just saying that. - Would I make that up? You're as beautiful as your mama, and she put all the flowers in the world to shame. You know, they wouldn't even let her come to Holland for fear she'd droop the tulips, and you got all the good looks she ever had. Then how come that man called me a boy? I don't know, maybe it's... Maybe it's 'cause of what you got on, or something. What's wrong with what I got on? Oh, nothing wrong with it, just... don't exactly make you look feminine. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea we get you fixed up a little bit, get you a new dress, a fancy new hat, or something. Come to think of it, it wouldn't exactly hurt business, either. You really think I'm as pretty as my mama? Of course I do. - How much money we got in the box? Give me a $20. - What for? - Give me a $20! - Come on. - Where are we going? We're going to get us some fancy new outfits with this money you got from your Aunt Helen. - I don't have no Aunt Helen. - Oh, sure you do, honey. Come on, let me explain it to you. Yes, sir? I'd like an Ipana toothpaste and a pack of Sen-Sen. - Uh, twenty and five. - Twenty-five. - Yes, sir. - Here you go. 75 makes one, four makes five, and 15 makes 20. Thank you very much. I don't need a bag. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Bye now. Hello. How much is this? That'll be 35 cents. 65 cents makes a dollar. Thank you very much. Thank you. Yes? May I have a bottle of purple toilet water, please? That'll be 25 cents. There you go. Lady, you made a mistake. Huh? I give you $4.75. But I gave you a $20 bill. Uh-uh. You give me a $5. No, ma'am, it was a $20 bill. You give me a $5, and I give you $4.75. It was a $20 bill. Got no $20s in with no $5s. What's all the turmoil? What's going on here? This little girl give me a $5 bill, and I give her change. I gave her a $20 bill - I know I did. It was a birthday present from my Aunt Helen in Wichita, and she wrote ""Happy Birthday, Addie"" on the end of it. You just go look and see. That's it right there! That's my $20 bill I got from my Aunt Helen in Wichita. - Give the child her $20 bill. - I'm giving it. - Give the child her $20 bill, Miss Brownwell. - Yes, sir. - And give her a piece of candy. - Yes, sir. - And pay attention to things, Miss Brownwell. - Yes, sir. Come on in, get your cotton candy. Sweetheart, Cotton Candy. - Five cents. - Do you have change for this five? There you are, little girl. Cotton candy, get your cotton candy. Mister, this purse is sure full. If you give me the five back, I'll give you five ones. Cotton candy, get your cotton candy right here. Mister, if you got a ten dollar bill I'll give you the five back with the five ones you have. Would you give me a ten dollar bill? There, now don't bother me anymore, you understand? Cotton candy! Step up and get your cotton candy. Come and get it. Get your tickets. Only one fourth of a dollar. The show goes on in five minutes. Six unusual little ladies unveiling the secrets of passion. Found only a few years back in the actual Egyptian tomb of Queen Nefereti. And featuring the luscious Miss Trixie Delight. - I had my photo took, Moze. - You did, huh? Ain't that fine. Moze, can you come have your photo took with me? - Can't right now, sweetheart. - Only take a minute. - Not now, you hear me? - But it's almost down here tonight. - It wouldn't be here after... - I can't help that. - Now excuse me, you understand? - How many times you going to see it? As many times as I like, that's how many times. - You seen it half a dozen times. - And I might see it a half dozen more. Now why don't you go play bingo or something? I don't want to play bingo. Well, then why don't you go write another love note to St. Roosevelt? Maybe I will. And stop standing around here checking on me. You don't have to worry. I ain't about to leave some poor little child stranded in the middle of nowhere. I got scruples, too, you know. You know what that is, ""scruples""? No, I don't know what it is, but if you got them, I sure bet they belong to somebody else. And his name ain't Frank, it's Franklin. Hey there, my little turtle-dee. I wondered where you got to. Where's your pa? - Is my picture ready? - Sure, it's... Excuse me, folks, come right back. Sit back in the moon there, I'll be right with you. Let's see. Here it is, here. Hey, now, I thought you were gonna sit in the moon with your pa. He ain't my pa. Hi, folks. Get ready. Smile. Hold it. Hold it. Beautiful. I don't want you smoking in the car tomorrow. - What? - I didn't say nothing. I'm just listening to you. Well, there are going to be a couple extra people riding with us, and this particular person don't like cigarette smoke. - What extra person? - What? I said ""what extra person""? A lady and her maid. I'm giving them a ride to Topeka. I didn't know we was going to Topeka. Well, that's because you don't know everything. What's the lady's name? Miss Delight. Miss Trixie Delight. She's a real lady. She comes from a good family. I'm just giving her a ride, that's all. Well, that's what you're always talking about, ain't it? Helping other people out. Now don't you drop nothing, Imogene. You take care of those breakables, understand? Yes, Miss Trixie. Morning. Car is right over here. You better ride in the backseat a while. And then I danced in Tuscaloosa. And the mayor was there, and he just said the nicest things about me. The newspaper ran a whole big photo on me. I got a scrap book telling stories on me from towns all over. Tell him 'bout the time that man tried to crack your head open with the bottle, Miss Trixie. Why, Imogene, you silly old thing. You know that's not true. That old country boy wasn't going to hit me over the head with no bottle. He was just horsing around. Ask me real nice, maybe I'll tell you about that sometime. Well, tell him about the time you almost got thrown in jail, Miss Trixie. I just don't understand it, Daddy, but this little baby has to go winky-tinky all the time. Well, don't you worry none. We'll just plan on stopping here for dinner. But we just stopped for her to winky-tink at lunch. That's right, and now we're stopping for dinner. - Come on. - I ain't hungry. - Want one? - OK. - How old are you? - I don't know, 15. Why? Just asking, that's all. - Where are you from? - Nowhere. Well, you got to be from somewhere. Down by Troy, I guess. How long have you worked for her? Ain't kept count. A year, maybe. How old you be? Nine. She really do all that dancing? Well, if you want to call it ""dancing"". All she do is wag her hips and shake her old behind a little. How come she'd leave that job back there? 'Cause the boss man tried to make her put out for his friends. And she don't believe in putting out for free. She put out much? Just like a gum machine. You drop something in and she'll put something out. How much she charge? Most she can get. But she always asks for $5.00. She ain't putting out for your pa, though. Says she's going to wait and get all she can before she put out for him. He tell her he was my pa? Well, not exactly. I heard him mumbling something like he didn't want to talk about it. - Ain't he? - I'm with him, ain't I? And how do you come to be with her? 'Cause she promised to give me $4.00 every week. She ain't gave me nothing. 'Cept a nickel or dime, sometimes. - Why don't you quit? - Quit? How am I going to quit? And what if I do quit? Ain't got no money to get home to Mum. And what if I do get home? They got hard times as it is. My mama say, ""You go work for a white lady, ""she'll take good care of you."" - You want to know what I think? - Yeah. You know the little white speck on top of chicken doo-doo? Yeah. Well, that's the kind of white I think Miss Trixie is. She's just like that little white speck on top of old chicken shit. Oh, I just love it, love it, love it. All this white. It is absolutely the proper thing for my particular kind of appearance. You know, it wouldn't be bad for you to have a new dress, too. The right kind of dress makes all the difference in the face. Especially since you got the right kind of bone structure. Oh... Oh, my, oh, my. Daddy, but wouldn't you look handsome sitting behind the wheel of a thing like that? 'Course, you know, everything is in the bone structure. You know, a person can tell his whole life on what his bone structure is. I tried pushing her out a window once in Little Rock. Oh... Oh, I think there's bugs all over the... I just hope there's no snakes around here. You know, I think we ought to go now. Thank you so much. Now hurry... oh. Come on, hurry up. Get those things in there, now. Don't break anything, either. Let's go. Hurry up, doctor, this baby's got to go winky-tinky. Don't worry. Hey! Come on, we're ready. - Come on, now. - I ain't ready. Well, you don't look real busy with nothing, so you just come on down. I ain't coming. - Now you listen here, child. - No, I won't listen here. What the heck's up with you, then? I want to sit in front. And how come we ain't working no more? 'Cause we're on vacation, that's why. And Miss Delight and me are sitting in front because we are two grown-ups, and that's where grown-ups do the sitting. And little children do not tell grown-ups what to do with their lives, you understand that? Well, she ain't my grown-up, and I ain't planning no more to sit in the back. Not for no cow. Will you keep your voice down? And Miss Delight ain't no cow. She's a proper woman. She has a high school diploma, and right now she's gotta go to the bathroom, so you just get on down to the car. She always has to go to the bathroom. She must have a bladder the size of a peanut. Well, I ain't getting back in that car. Not till she gets out of it. Hey, what's up, kiddo? Daddy says you're wearing a sad face. Ain't good to have a sad face. Hey, how would you like a colouring book? Would you like that? You like Mickey the Mouse? Oh, son of a bitch! Ooh... oh. Now come on down to the car and let's all be friends. You see me smile? Come on, let's see you smile like Aunt Trixie. Now, come on! Come on down to the car with mademoiselle. Kiddo, I understand how you feel. Well, you don't have to worry. One of these days, you're going to be just as pretty as mademoiselle, maybe prettier. You already got bone structure. When I was your age, I didn't have no bone structure. Took me years to get bone structure. And don't think bone structure's not important. Nobody started to call me mademoiselle till I was 17 and getting a little bone structure. When I was your age, I was skinnier than a pole. I never thought I'd have nothing up here. You're going to have them up there, too. Look, I'll tell you what. Want me to show you how to use cosmetics? Look, I'll let you put on my earrings. You can see how pretty you're going to be. And I'll show you how to make up your eyes. And your lips. And I'll see to it you get a little bra or something. But right now you're gonna pick your little ass up, you're gonna drop it in the backseat and you're gonna cut out the crap, you understand? You're going to ruin it, ain't you? Look, I don't want to wipe you out, and I don't want you wiping me out, you know? So, I'm going to level with you, OK? Now, you see, with me, it's just a matter of time. I don't know why, but somehow I just don't manage to hold on real long. So, if you wait it out a little, it'll be over, you know? I mean, even if I want a fella, somehow or other I manage to get it screwed up. Maybe I'll get a new pair of shoes, nice dress, a few laughs. Times are hard. Now, if you fool around on the hill up here, then you don't get nothing, I don't get nothing, he don't get nothing. So how 'bout it, honey? Just for a little while, let old Trixie sit up front with her big tits. Hey, come on. We're coming, baby doll. And if you don't find me some old gas station soon, this little old snowflake's going to wet her pantaloons. Oh, my, I almost fell down. Yoo-hoo! Look what we got! Ain't she the sweetest little thing, and don't he look like a prince on that wheel? Now, come on, Imogene. Now, get everything in here. We got more room than the whole state of Kansas. And listen to the horn. Blow the horn, Daddy. Oh, go ahead. Do it again. Sticks his tongue into the water, and there's an alligator in the river... Very funny. This girl's sitting on the trolley, and she reaches in her bag, and she takes out this magazine, and she starts to read it. Well, she ain't read more than a couple of pages. And real slow and careful now, she takes her stockings down and takes off her shoes. Now, she turns the stockings wrong side out, and she puts them back on. She puts her shoes back on. Well, all the passengers are watching. They wonder what's going on. This old guy, he leans over to her, and he asks her, he says, ""What's...? ""I saw you indulge in a strange procedure, ma'am. What were you doing?"" And she said, ""Well, I was reading this here magazine, you know? ""And I found it to be such hot stuff that I... ""Well, I felt compelled to turn the hose on myself."" Oh, turn the hose on! When you said that, I... They wouldn't have a room with a canopy bed, would they? You wouldn't have a room with a canopy bed, would you? Uh, no. But I got one with a fireplace. Oh, I'd like that one, Daddy. It ain't no canopy bed, but it sure do open up a whole new can of peas, don't it? Can of peas. - Ain't that cute? - Huh? How's that? Come on, Imogene. Now, help the boy with these things. Give them 234, 235, and 236. They're working on the elevator right now, and it's the first flight up, if you don't mind. - It's all right. Thank you. - Thank you. - ""Can of peas"". Did you hear that? - Yeah, what was that all about? Well, you know, Canopy... can of pea... They rhyme, you know? - Oh, I see! Can of peas, canopy! - Yeah. I get it now. I knew you'd get it if I explained it to you. Picture Henry Ford without a car Picture heaven's firmament without a star Picture Grigsby Chrysler without a fiddle Picture poor Philadelphia without a Biddle Picture Central Park without a sailor Picture Mr Lord minus his detailer Mix 'em all together, and what have you got? Just a picture of me without you Now there's a rip in the seam of that dress, Imogene. You get it sewed up good, you hear? - And wash these hose. - Yes, Miss Trixie. - Got my bath ready? - Yes, Miss Trixie. Hope the water's not too hot. You've been making that water awful hot lately, Imogene. I knows you like it hot, Miss Trixie. Well, not that hot. Now, you go on, finish up all these things and come back in an hour and dry me off. Yes, Miss Trixie. What you doing up there? I got us an idea. Come on. - What kind of idea? - Come on in here, and I'll tell you. Go on. Imogene, what do you suppose Miss Trixie would do if somebody offered her $25 to put out? Oh-wee, you crazy. For that much money, that woman would drop her pants down - in the middle of the road. - That's what I figured. What you got in mind? You want to get away from Miss Trixie, don't you? Well, if you help me, I'll give you enough money to get home to your mama. - How much money? - When do we start? - Tomorrow morning. Miss Trixie, you know that man down at the desk who checked us in yesterday? Yeah, I know him. What about him? Well, he tell me, he'd pay $25 just to have a good time with you. What? Well, that little two-bit bum nerve of that guy. $25. I bet that little John don't make that much in a week. Where would he get 25 bucks? I don't know. All I know is what he told me. 25 bucks, huh? Sure have to see the money to believe it. Here you go. You come back and see us again real soon. I'll have a Juicy Fruit gum, please. Here you go, my little beauty. Want I should chew it for you? Say, you know that redheaded lady that comes down here named Miss Trixie Delight? Well, she thinks you're real cute. Oh, yeah? Says you and who else? No, honest. She says you're better looking than Dick Powell. She did, eh? Well, the lady's got good taste, don't she? - Well, just thought you'd like to know. - Hey, just a minute. Give these here to the lady, and tell her they're with Floyd's compliments. Oh. She'll like that. Maybe you should write her a note. - Yeah. What kind of a note? - Oh, I don't know. I thought men always wrote ladies notes when they send them presents. Maybe you should ask her for a date. That will sure tickle her. Yeah. Maybe I ought to. Say, she's not married up or anything like that, is she? Of course not. She don't even have a regular boyfriend. That man who come in here yesterday with her is my daddy. He's her manager. She's a dancer. A dancer? You know, I figured she was something like that. Whereabouts she dance? Oh, lots of big places. She's a star. Well, how about that! Why don't you print it? She like men who prints. Print it, huh? ""Some sweets for the sweet. Ha, ha. ""Some girls say I'm a pretty smooth dancer myself. - ""How about trying me out sometime?"" - You sure this is going to work? I don't know, but we're sure going to give it a try. Throw this in the drawer, will you? And keep your fingers crossed. - Who is it? - It's me, Addie. Oh. What do you want? I got a message from Moze. He asked me to tell you he had to run over to Hainesville today. He won't be back until suppertime. I think he had to get something fixed on his car. - He'll be gone all day. - Oh. Well... OK. OK! - Howdy. - Howdy. - What you having? - Waffles. I already ate. I had waffles, too. They sure are good, ain't they? They ain't bad for waffles. Mr Moze, Miss Trixie don't feel so good. She say she's going to stay in bed today. She say she'll see you around suppertime. She sick? Sick in bed? I... I better go up there. Oh, she ain't real sick. Ain't nothing to worry about. She's just having her lady's time. Oh. Well, you tell her I'll see her this evening. Well, just wanted to say good morning. I think I'll go upstairs and polish my shoes. - Somebody at the door, Imogene. - Yes, Miss Trixie. It's something for you, Miss Trixie. - Oh, what is it? - It was outside the door. What is that? Imogene, let all that go now. You can run along. I'll call you when I need you. Yes, Miss Trixie. Well, hello, cupid. Miss Trixie wants to see you. She says it's real important. Room 235. Oh, she does, does she? When? - Right now. - Well, I can't get off right now. But she says it's real important. Well, you tell her I'll come up later tonight... when the moon is full. But you can't come tonight. She won't even be here after tonight. Matter of fact, she won't even be here after today. She won't, huh? Well... You won't be sorry. I guess I could go up for a few minutes. What's that room number again? Room 235. She's waiting for ya. OK. You tell her I'm on my way up, sweetheart. He's coming! He's coming! - Who is it? - Sheik of Araby. Well, then, don't you look pretty? Well, come on in, honey. Come on. ...you don't give a girl much time. Oh, I manage to get around. Say, you're not one of these fellows goes around babbling, are you, honey? What do you mean? Well, you know, now most of the time I don't mind, but it's important to me right now not to get talked about. Hey, now do I look like that kind of fellow? Say... oh, say you are a wild one, aren't you? Hold it, hold it! Now, wait a minute, you're going to tear it! Now, now, just let me slip it off. Hey, there. Well, now, ain't you a show dog? Ooh... ooh! I'm going. The key... Give me the key! Mr Moze's going to kill that man. He's going to kill them both, I just knows it. - Wait for me here. - OK. - Moze! - What's the trouble? Better go up to Trixie's room right away. Why? What? She sick? No, she's not sick. Just do what I tell you. And take the elevator. Don't knock. Use the key. Your daddy going to kill that man, I reckon. I expect he cut him up pretty bad. Moze wouldn't do a thing like that. Well, down home, when a man come in from work, and hear a man inside house in bed with his wife, he just walk around to the woodpile and get his double-blade axe, and go inside, chop 'em both up to little pieces. Folks say he cut 'em up just like kindling wood. Get your things, Addie. We're leaving. - Now? - Right this minute. I swan, I don't know why that girl did such a thing to me. I'd have done almost anything for that girl. Just ain't fair. I reckon she's been... carrying on a long time. - From the start. - You mean, there were other men? Lots of 'em. Well, dadblammit, why didn't you tell me? I just knew you wouldn't believe me. - I want you to promise me just one thing. - What, Moze? When you grow up, don't you be the kind of woman who goes around deceiving men. - Promise me that. - I promise, Moze. Oh, my love, let's take a walk Just a little ways away While we walk along, we'll talk Talk about our wedding day Only say that you'll be mine And in our home, we'll happy be Down beside where the waters flow Down on the banks... - Moze? - Hmm? Moze, pay attention. - What's the trouble? - I seen something peculiar. - What's that? - That man in there. - What man? - Standing by the door. What's peculiar about him? He's got a roll of money could choke us both to death. Well, I'm not up to anything right now. But he's got a black book for making notes in, and all that money, and he keeps going outside and then coming back in again. - Bootlegger. - Bootlegger? No question about it. You think we might do some business with him? Maybe drop a wad or something? We ain't done nothing in two months, ever since Trixie. And we only have $212 left. Better ways of doing business with bootleggers. What ways? Oh, heaps of ways. Look, he's going out again! Follow him. - Should I, Moze? - I told you, didn't I? Follow him. Find out where he goes. Thinking, ""Lord, what a deed I have done!"" Killed the girl I loved, you see 'Cause she would not marry me Only say that you'll be mine And in our home, we'll happy be Down beside where the waters flow Down on the banks of the Ohio Thank you. Big brown eyes and curly hair... What'd you find out? He's got a lot of bottles he keeps in some kind of bin out back. - How big's the bin? - About as big as our car trunk, maybe. - What you plan to do? - Find out where he keeps his goods. Well, there was a little shack out there, too, but he didn't go in it. Well, honey... how about a little walk before Daddy puts you in the bed? Oh, goody. Our friend's name is Jess Hardin. He's a bootlegger, all right. Wholesales pretty near everybody in the county. His brother's some sort of a big shot, too, but the girl couldn't tell me about him. Some Romeo walked up, and I had to beat it. Now, where is it? - Right over there. - OK, come on. OK, now, you watch the hotel. You see anybody coming, you cough real low. I'm going inside. - It may be locked. - Shucks, honey. Folks in the country never lock anything. Don't you know that? Come sit by my side, little darling Come lay your cool hand on my brow Promise me that you will never - Be nobody's darlin' but mine - Your name Hardin? That's right. Conrad's the name. Jack said I ought to look you up. Jack who? Oh, just Jack's good enough, I reckon. Don't know no Jack. Well, maybe you ought to get acquainted. He's running the biggest wholesale business in the state. - You selling? - That's right. Ain't interested in no shiney. I ain't selling no shiney, I only deal in bonded goods. - What kind? - All kinds. I can let you have a pretty good deal on some Three Feathers. How much? Well, it depends. You take 20 cases, I'll let 'em go for $25 per. - That's too much. - Ain't too much. You can't get it that cheap where they sell it legal. Ain't legal here. That's all the more reason you're getting a bargain. Give you just $20. Can't do it. Price is set down in Wichita. How long before delivery? Oh... how's early in the morning? You got it in the county? That's right. My mother is dead and in heaven... Where do I pick it up? My daddy... - That'll do it. - Did you leave some? Plenty. He'll never miss it. Moze? Moze, we better get. - Here. - It's all filled up, I told you. Them's for me. Get going! Hurry. Get up there! Now hold on. And make sure nothing spills off. Well, you'd better go slow. And hurry. - Easy! - Well, I got to turn corners, don't I? Moze, ain't he going to miss his whisky? Oh, maybe in about a week, but by the time he's figured it out, we'll be in Missouri and he can't do nothing once we're in Missouri. Come on. Where is it? Scoot over! - How much you get? $625, and he bought his own whisky! That's $625 plus the $212 we already got. And if we drop some wallets and do some 20s, we'll... - What's that? - Where? Behind us. I don't see nothin'. - There's something back there. - Nothin' but pitch black. - I thought I seen something flicker. - Nothin' there. - You put the money in the box? - Uh-huh. I'll be glad to get out of this town, I'll tell you that. There it is again. Dadblammit! Somethin' flickered, sure as hell. Nothin' behind us, Moze. - Uh-oh. - I told ya! - Who could it be? - Christ! - Don't stop, keep going! - I can't keep going. The damn car's in front of me. Everything's going to be all right. You just let me do the talking. - You playin' games with us, Mister? - Oh, I... I didn't know who was back there. It's a risky thing to do. Might get your tyres shot off. Where you headin'? Me and my little girl are going to Saint Jo. - Oh. Live there? - Nearby. - What's your business? - Uh... Livestock, mostly... mules and horses. Some cattle. That's funny. I heard you was a bootlegger. Oh, no, sir, not me, friend. Must be some mistake. Maybe... Maybe not. The way I hear it... you just had a transaction by the old barn. Where'd you hear a thing like that? Oh, a... friend of the family. No, I'm sorry, I... - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm talkin' about bootleggin'. I'm talkin' about $625. Now, just where might that be? I don't have no $625. I... I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even know where the old barn is. Well... I reckon we'll just have to explain a little more thoroughly, won't we? Come on, Beau, you take a ride with these nice people. - Love to. - We're all goin' back to town. Damn. Just when you think you got it made... just ain't made, is it? - You pretty good at this little thing? - Not too good. Not too good, huh? Old bootlegger's sittin' there with his own little game, and he ain't even good at his own game. Yes, sir, that is some good joke. I found these on the front seat. Wasn't any money in the car. Went all through it, inside and out. Livestock business, huh? That whisky's for a friend. Hold out your hands. - Huh? - I said, hold out your hands. You heard me. I didn't say put 'em down, did I? Mighty clean hands for livestock. Them hands don't look like they do nothin' much except play a little casino every now and then. I told you, that whisky's for a friend. I didn't see no harm... Didn't see no harm? Hear that, Beau? Big bootlegger claims he don't know the law. Well, Mr Bootlegger, I don't need no couple of bottles to make a case against you. Law says all I need is just one little ol' drop. And... law says you use a vehicle to transport alcoholic beverages, and said vehicle is confiscated to be sold at public auctions, so... you can just kiss that pretty little ol' car of yours goodbye. Hey, hold on! That seems pretty rough just because... Don't lower your hands. I didn't tell you to lower your hands. I tell you to lower your hands, then you lower your hands. You don't do nothin' till I tell you to. Understand? Answer me. You understand? Yes, sir. Ah, I already done that. Ain't nothin' in his clothes 'cept him. He ain't worth five cents. No, she ain't got nothin' on her, either. You don't know what kind of real bad trouble you're in. You better start thinking on it. I've got a case against you for possession and transportin' whisky, and I reckon if I try, I can think of a few other things. Better face it, you're going to be up in these parts for quite a while, working on the county roads. Maybe you're lucky, you get out in six months. Six more months, influencing a child - maybe get six years for that. Maybe we could work something out. What's there to work out? '...while I rustle one up, 'you all listen to this little goodie 'from a couple of years ago...' Ah, I sure don't like to send a man to a road gang. Never have. Always felt sorry for them poor devils. But I can't overlook the fact that you've been paid $625, and you ain't tellin' me where it is. Now, I know you're a bootlegger, so what's there for me to work out? All right. Let's cut this ring-around-the-rosy. Where's that... money? You think I'm foolin' around? I ain't foolin' around. Maybe you'll come around in time. Get a little thirsty and get a little hungry. Time sure does have a way with criminals, don't it, Beau? Sure do. Well, it's gettin' on to 5:00. Somebody ought to be stirring over at the caf. I think I'll step over there a while. See if that friend of the family's there. I'll be on back 'fore long. I got all day, you know? I got all the time in the world. Trouble's just a bubble And the clouds will soon roll by So let's have another cup of coffee And let's have another piece of pie Let a smile be your umbrella For it's just an April shower Even John D. Rockefeller... Sir, may I get my things, please? Mr Herbert Hoover... OK. So let's have another cup of coffee And let's have another piece of pie Daddy... I need to go to the shithouse. Well, uh, there's a place down the hall. Daddy, I'm scared. I want you to come stand by the door. All right if I go with her? Down there. - Run! - You crazy? Hey! Where are we running? Oh, my God. Stop them people! Hey, there's bootleggers! Jesus Christ, this is the craziest... - Hurry! - I'm hurrying! - Stop! - Oh, Jesus! - I'm going to hit him! - Make him jump! Don't slow down! I could have killed him! They're going to have me up for murder! - They're shooting at us! - But they're missin'! Keep going! - We ain't gonna make it. - Yes, we will. Not in this car, we ain't. Every lawman in Kansas is going to be looking for this car. We got to get across the river to Missouri. Where's the bridge? - Oh, Jesus! - What's the matter? - Damn bridge is the other way! - What? Hang on. Ah, this ain't no good. We're gonna make it too easy for 'em. We got to get off this road. Hang on! Holy smoke! Blow your horn! Won't do no good. He can't pull off the road. Ain't we got all the luck, selling whisky to a sheriff's brother? Hang onto your hat. - What? - Hold on, I said. Oh, God! - You all right? - Uh-huh. OK, we threw a hobble on 'em for a while, but we got to get off this road, or we're going to end up in a town for sure. And take that money out of there. You like to give me heart failure. We made it, didn't we? Anybody 't home? Howdy. Need to get rid of my car here. I need to get rid of my car! Sheriff wants to take away my little girl, put her in an orphanage. You know anybody who might want to swap? How about that truck over there? Well, we'll just let him chew on it a while. Well, the rear tyres look new, anyway. - The radio looks OK. - Think this thing runs? It better. We got to have some way of travelling. - Where we going to go? - Out of Kansas, across the river to Saint Jo. That's where. Here he comes. Look at 'em all. All I'm looking for is a swap and three days' head start before you take it out on the highway. It's all legal. Got the papers right here to prove it. Just have to fill out that form on the back, and you own it. Ain't gonna swap. Well, it's brand-new. That car ain't no good. What's the matter with it? Can't haul nothing in it. Oh, well, if that's all that's bothering you, you can sell the car and get two trucks to do your hauling in. I ain't gonna swap. Wrassle you for it. - Are you crazy? - If I win, we swap. You win, you can keep the car and the truck both. - Moze... - Quiet down. - What kind of wrassling? - You name it. - Catch as can? - Shoes or barefoot? Makes no never mind to me. Barefoot. You're gonna get killed just to give something away. I ain't got no choice. Get that city boy. Get the city boy. Let's go. Make him say ""calf rope"", Leroy. Come on, Leroy. Get him, Leroy. Get him! That ain't fair! You stop that! You make him fight fair! Look out for that rake, Leroy. Watch out, Leroy. - Let's go in the car. Come on! - Yee-haw! Woo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Woo-hoo! - Are you pushing? - Of course I'm pushing! OK, it'll go now. Put your foot on the brake. - The brake! The brake! - It don't work! The brake, goddamn it! The brake! Don't you even know where the damn brake is? It don't work. Oh... Well, it figures. Well, we're in Missouri anyway. What'll we do now, drop some 20s? - How much money we got? - $837 and some change. 42 cents, I think. Well, we're just outside of St. Jo, ain't we? - So what? - So... It's a big town, ain't it? We can do better than 20s. 'Y'all know that one. ""'Let's have another cup of coffee, let's have another piece of pie."" 'Well, it's 10:30, and it's Sunday morning in St. Jo, 'and y'all get to church now, OK? 'Here's the news: 'In Omaha, President Roosevelt told the nation last night...' - Moze? - Yeah? - What if that old man don't believe ya? - He'll believe me, all right. He's in the market for making a killing, just like we are. Maybe he don't even have a silver mine. I had him checked out real thorough. Where's the money? And he's just what people say he is - rich and greedy. 'The independent candidate for Senate this year...' - Pull up your socks. - Moze... If we get a silver mine, we could get a house and everything, couldn't we? Everything, just... everything. Just around the corner, there's a rainbow in the sky So let's have another cup of coffee OK, you got it straight? Corner of East Warring and Burlington, 11 o'clock. Just show there with tears in your eyes. That's all. Moze, don't forget the money. Of course I won't forget the money. I'll see you in 30 minutes. Moze, could we get a piano, too? A piano? We'll have a whole factory. Just around the corner There's a rainbow in the sky I guess you just didn't make a good enough swap. My brother's real sore at ya. Seems you sold him some of his own whisky. You can't arrest me now. We're in Missouri. And your damn brother's a bootlegger! You got an awful big mouth, Mister. Maybe I can't arrest you in Missouri, and maybe I don't want to. But I sure can make sure that you ain't gonna feel real good while you're here. Let's go! Addie... Addie... Moze. Moze... I sw... I swallowed my gold tooth. - Aw, Moze. - They took it all. - Oh, Moze, you're all beat up. - Ain't nothing left. Don't worry none. I've been keeping ten dollars for emergencies. What the hell we do with ten dollars? We could buy some bibles, do a little widow business. Must be lots of good towns around here. Do some 20s, drop some wallets... before you know it, we'll be real good again. I'll bet in no time we could have a whole new car and everything. You're going to take me to Aunt Billie's now, ain't ya? - Aw, Moze... - Don't start crying. - I won't. - That's where we set out for, ain't it? Looks nice. Yeah, it looks real fine. - That must be your uncle Daniel. - He looks nice, too, don't he? Yup. Real nice. Maybe if Frank D. Roosevelt comes, he'll tell him to take me to the station to see him. Maybe you write, ol' Frankie'll have a place to write you back now. Yeah, he might, at that. 'Course he will. Ain't no question but he will. All this talk's just wasting time. Here's your... here, your skates, your radio. - Where you gonna go? - Don't worry about me. I got plans. New ideas coming in every day. Get going. You know, if I knew for sure you wasn't my pa... It's for sure I ain't your pa. Although sometimes I used to figure Mr Connors could have been my pa, the way he touched my shoulder, get me things from the candy counter for free. And Mr Pritchard, he smiled at me once real nice. Except they don't have my jaw or nothing. So long. Ain't you coming to the door with me? There it is, right there. How much closer am I supposed to bring you? They'll wonder how I got here. Tell 'em a family friend brung you, and you had a little trouble on the way with your car and with finances. Now, get going. Yes? Yes? I'm Addie. Addie? Addie! I've been worried sick about you. Addie... come on in, child. I been writing letters, and your Uncle Daniel's been trying to call those people down there to see where you've been. You're just the spitting image of your mother, pretty as a picture. I don't know why I go on like this. What you need is some ice-cold lemonade. Now you just sit right there, and I'll be right back. Everybody's going to be so happy to see you. We're going to get those clothes off of you. You're going to get into a nice, fresh, bath... and then you're going to sleep in your own little bed, alongside your cousin, Edna. I just near give up on you, child. I bet you're starving to death. I'm going to cut you a big piece of pie. We got those telegrams, and then we never did hear from ya. I told you, I don't want you riding with me no more. You still owe me $200. Moze, look! Come on. Hurry up. Keep your sunny side up Keep it up high, the side that gets blue If you have nine sons in a row Start a baseball team, they make money, you know Keep your funny side up, don't let up Let your laughter come through, doodley-doo Stand up on your legs Be like two fried eggs Keep your sunny side up, Who is it? It's Lieutenant Finley. He's coming up the path. It might be worth listening to him, Edna. So he can tell me about D-Day? I don't wanna hear about D-Day. Look what happened to my son. Hold it, Peggy. Cut from D-Day to... ...""Don't tell me about the black market."" You're making me a bitch... ...to keep in your propaganda! Peggy, I'll tell you-- Oh, Jesus! Oh, Bill. Katie wants to keep in the black market. Bill! Glad you're back. How did it go? Goddamn Pentagon, all they see is red! Where's my coffee? Get you some in a minute. Don't cast that broad again. Takes a reactionary to play one. Where's my coffee? Can't the chintzy OWI afford a gofer? And where's Roxanne? She called and she said that she couldn't make it. We'd like to get set up and go from the top again, Mr. Verso. - What's the matter? - What is this? Two lines I wrote. No good, huh? Morosky, let me do the writing, will you? Christ, I'm tired of being a patriot for no money. - She can't come? - Nope. Okay, Katie, you're in luck. I'm taking you to El Morocco, courtesy of the Office of War Information. All right, Americans, let's take it from the top. One, two. One, two, three. Clear the way. Please clear the way. Sir, we have a reservation. - There are no more tables. - But we called... - ...and you said-- - Sorry, no tables. - I told you-- - But we called-- I'd like to know your name and also why you're not in uniform. These boys have been in combat, you fascist rope-holder. - Hi, Fred. Bill Verso. OWI. - Don't tip him. - Get his name! - We were with a whole bunch of people. - Hey, Verso! Merry old Bill Verso. - Hey, Tiny! Stop it! Don't do that! They're with us. Come on! Thanks, Tiny. Good to see you. Listen, Katie-- Hey, Jimbo! Can't you leave your soapbox at home just once? Coming through. What do you want to drink? I know. Dubonnet over ice. Dubonnet over ice and a scotch, straight up. Here's your Dubonnet, Morosky. Oh, to be in uniform! Hubbell Gardiner. What? That's his name. Swell. What's hers? I suppose they learn that balance on board ship. Absolutely. Let's dance. What've you got to lose? I'll probably go overseas soon. It's pretty hush-hush. Save Loyalist Spain! Stop Franco for world peace now! Write President Roosevelt! Come on. Do something about it! Save Spain! Stop Franco! Stop the slaughter of innocent women and children. Do something! Write your congressman today. Katie, what are you selling? The ROTC. You can have it cheap! Fascist. Row, Hubbell! A true peace rally... ...should cover the entire spectrum from extreme right... ...to extreme left. As our next speaker proves. The President of the Young Communist League. She needs no introduction. Miss Katie Morosky. Guess I do need an introduction. Back up, Katie. Yeah, all the way to Moscow! You can still take Communion and like the Soviet Union! What's cooking in the Kremlin, Katie? The Kremlin's worried about the civil war in Spain. Are you? Thousands of Spanish citizens are being bombed and murdered. Only one country is sending help. One country. The Soviet Union. K-K-K-Katie, be my C-C-C-Comrade. O-K-K-K-Kay! What are you scared of? The Russians don't want anybody in Spain but the Spanish. Is that scary? They're Communists, but they want total disarmament. Is that scary? Hitler and Mussolini are using Spain as testing ground for what they want. Another world war! Is that scary? You're darn right it is! There's only one thing to be scared of... ...and it's not me, it's not the Young Communist League... ..and it's not the Red bogeyman. You be scared of anybody, anyplace... ...who will not stand up for world peace now! You're really... ...you're really something. Really-- You're really beautiful. No, I mean it. You're really beautiful. You're the best... ...the brightest... ...most committed generation this country's ever had. That's why you're here today, striking for peace. Why, they're striking on almost every single campus in this country. They're taking that pledge. Show your solidarity by taking it with them. ""I refuse to support""-- Come on, come on. ""I refuse""-- Come on. On your feet! ""I refuse to""-- That's right. On your feet. Everybody. ""I refuse to support""-- No, everybody. Everybody! ""I refuse to support... ...the government of the United States... ...in any war it might conduct."" The student council calls this a peace rally. I call it... ...a peace strike. And I'm an English major. It isn't that funny. You fascists! - We have to talk about this stuff. - Wait a second. - You've been on that for two months. - Three. It's a short story-- Frankie Mc Veigh, you're not funny. - I know it. - Listen... ...would you do me a favour? Take the YCL meeting Monday night. - You can't miss a meeting. - I have to. The story is due on Tuesday and it's just gotta be good. Look who's here, America the beautiful. - How much do you have in the treasury? Possible themes for the prom. ""Caribbean Holiday,"" ""Jungle Fever""-- Hey, you should be listening to this. ""Niagara Falls."" ""Thirteen Colonies,"" ""48 States."" ""Thirteen Colonies,"" ""48 States""-- J.J. J.J., listen. ""The 48 States,"" ""Starlight, Star Bright"" and "" In My Merry Oldsmobile."" How about ""Bread Lines Can Be Fun""? How about ""The Stalin Shuffle""? What are we gonna have? Hamburgers? How about ""The College Grad Meets The Leningrad""? She's a million laughs. - What do you want? - Coke. - Coca-Cola? - Coca-Cola. Excuse me. You're all decadent and disgusting. Come on, we weren't making fun of you. You make fun of everything. You think politics is a joke. You make fun of politicians. - What else can you do? - Think Franco's funny? - Franco? Is he here? - Yeah, Franco. He's a politician. He's funny? Hitler has a funny moustache. Why not have a Nazi prom? Well, we thought of that, but the uniforms itch. Comes the revolution, maybe we'll have a sense of humour. Four cheeseburgers, four cokes. Onion? Yeah, in the cokes. If I read comparatively few of your stories aloud in class... ...it's because I think we learn best from what's good. Or at least, talented. Today I'm going to read, with a great deal of pleasure... ...a remarkably good story from a surprising new source. The name of the story is ""The All-American Smile."" And it's by Hubbell Gardiner. ""In a way, he was like the country he lived in. Everything came too easily to him, but at least he knew it. About once a month he worried that he was a fraud. But then most everyone he knew was more fraudulent. Sometimes he felt.... --there's really no reason for us to change. But of course by then, they were too lost or too lazy. It had always been too easy."" The trouble with some people is they work too hard. Are you speaking to me? Want a beer? I don't drink. One sip. One sip of beer. Well? - You carry your books all the time? - That's what I crossed the street for? I'm celebrating. What are you celebrating? I got you to cross the street. Listen, I'm sorry I.... I haven't told you that I really liked your story. You're a good writer. Thank you. Mrs. Simpson married the Duke of Windsor. It's in tomorrow's paper. How do you know that? The papers aren't out yet. I work in the Linotype room two nights a week. You never quit, do you? Well... ...thanks for getting me across the street. I sold one. I sold a story. I've never known anybody who sold one. Oh, boy, Hubbell. Okay, so have a drink. Sit. To your first novel. - Wait a minute, not so fast. - Why not? Yeah, why not? You should've laughed. ""Any peace but Katie's piece."" You were good. You had them. You could've kept them, if only you'd laughed. - It wasn't funny. - That's not the only reason to laugh. - You're a puritan. - I am not. - You've no sense of humour. - My family thinks I'm humorous. - Why are you always angry? - Not always! Because I don't know... ...about coed humour. I've never been in a fraternity or sorority... ...which is where I'm sure they make up all that dirty stuff anyway. That's pretty dirty business. - Can I ask you a personal question? - Sure. Do you smile all the time? No. No. No. Here's to commencement. A funny word for ""the end."" Mrs. Simpson married the Duke of Windsor. I told you that, didn't I? Yeah, you did. I'm really happy about your news. I hope I get to read your story someday. Put your foot here. Go get 'em, Katie. See you, Hubbell. See you. Don't spill it on your dress. I'd like to have the sewing concession when they want to shorten those dresses. You know, to get some wear out of them. Grab your coat and get your hat Leave your worries on the doorstep I'm glad we're not working on commission. I've never been to a dance before, except the one the YCL gave for Spain. Here, have a drink. - Here. - What's that, bourbon? It's gin, Katie. Come on. From the bottle? So bourgeois. - Let's dance. - We aren't supposed to. You weren't supposed to buy me a corsage either. Come on. Can you, Frankie? Frankie Mc Veigh, you've got a foot for dancing! Hubbell? Hubbell? What do you know? Small world, isn't it? I fall asleep? I think so. What do you know? Would you like to have a cup of coffee? Oh, yeah. Coffee. Here you are, kiddo. Good night. Good night. Good night, Hubbell, old boy. Whoever you are. Who are you? It's the top floor. Only one more! In there. Hubbell? Hubbell? General quarters! Count down! Stand safe.... Hubbell. Hubbell, it's Katie. You didn't know it was Katie. I'll be done in a minute. - You don't have to do that. - Oh, it's okay. I like to iron. Gee, you have a lot of ribbons here. You have any aspirin? Oh, I don't. Push in on your temples. How can you not have aspirin? I always eat for a headache. Do you have my watch? Do you know where it is? I took it off and put it on the bedpost. I thought you'd be more comfortable-- - That's why I.... - Here. Thank you. It's your hair. That's what's different. I have it ironed. You have your hair ironed? Does it hurt? No. Have some coffee at least. I'm low on sugar, but it's real coffee. No, thank you. I have to meet J.J. at the train. Looks good, though. You still have J.J.? How long will you be around? Where are you stationed? In Washington. Oh, that's good. That could be exciting. Why? Roosevelt is there. I thought the Party said he was an evil warmonger. How do you know that? You still think a varsity letter stands for ""moron,"" huh? Some people work out better than we think. - Thank you very much. - Oh, listen.... This is my number, and this is the OWI office where I work. This is the radio station. It's very difficult to find a hotel room. If you're ever in town and you can't find one, well, just.... No obligation of course. Thank you. About last night.... I'm sorry. I've been falling asleep all over lately. That's okay. Hope my snoring didn't keep you awake. Oh, that's okay. I like snoring. See you, Katie. See you, Hubbell. Good luck. American-Soviet benefit, Friday night at town hall! Come to the American-Soviet Friendship benefit Friday. American-Soviet benefit at town hall, folks. Come to the American-Soviet benefit Friday night. Thank you. Big show. Big show at town hall, folks. Come to the American-Soviet benefit Friday night. Hey, soldier, why don't you bring a date? Come to the American-Soviet benefit. Bring a date. Come to the American-Soviet benefit. American-Soviet-- Jesus, I'm late for the OWI. See you later, Pony. Bye! - Vote for Thomas E. Dewey! - We've gotta stop FDR. I'll take them. I'll give them to your friends. I'll help you. CDHQ, America Calling. Applications are available at your local post office. CDHQ, America Calling. Can you identify them? Over the Bronx? 25 Stuka Dive Bombers. I've got it, madam. Yes, I remember Pearl Harbor. I'll connect you. Even if he lost the paper, I'm still in the book. It's only been a week. One moment, please. I'll connect you. He could phone at least. CDHQ, America Calling. Phone where? You've only got eleven jobs. You've censored all but nine minutes. - It implied that we spit on Negroes. - Which you do. - The situation-- - Now the Negroes are a situation? After the war, the Pentagon-- It'll be just like it was before, you racist fink! - What's with her this week? - This week? - What do you mean? - Shut up! - I have 21 minutes of dead airspace! - It's his fault! Okay, okay! I'll sign. Hubbell? - Where are you? - Grant's tomb. I can't get a room. Can I use your couch? - Of course you can. - Morosky, we have-- Will you, please! Hubbell, there's beer in the icebox and clean towels... ...and if you wanna take a nap... ...take off the phone and put it in the drawer of the desk. - How do I get the key? - I'll call the super. Hubbell! I wasn't sure when you'd be home. How are you? I'll be back later. Could you leave a key--? You can't. I got steaks and potatoes and sour cream and chives... ...and salad and fresh pie. I would have made pot roast... ...but I didn't know if you liked it. Anyway, there wasn't time... ...so I got steaks with my ration stamps. And you must be hungry, you couldn't have had time to eat. You can't go yet. You've got to stay for supper, that's all there is to it. What kind of pie? Oh, your hero, huh? Who? He wasn't in college when he did nothing for Spain. - Congress was isolationist in '37-- - You'd justify the Nazi-Soviet pact. Easier than you can justify the Allies sitting on their behinds-- Why can't you say asses? - Because I can't. - Why? What happens? I don't know. Nothing. - What a subject for two-- - It's interesting. You'd rather talk politics. All the contradictions. Should we get in the war, should we not? Stalin's for Hitler. Stalin's against him. All political doubletalk, but you hold on. I don't know how you do it. I don't know how you can't. You're jealous. - What? - You are. Why are you jealous? I'll live. Maybe longer. But you won't write another novel. You must've gotten one of the two copies sold. - You get through it? - Oh, I managed. Twice. I liked it. I liked it a lot. What didn't you like? The way you write is no problem. Your style is absolutely gorgeous. But-- Gorgeous? It is. It is gorgeous. But you... ...stand back. Do you know what I mean? Go ahead. You see, the people... ...you watch them... ...from a distance. Where? In the book. I know, in the book. Where in the book? Be specific. All through it, Hubbell. But it's your first novel, and I'm sure the second one will be-- Why should I write another novel? Because you must! You're too good a writer not to. Are you really so sure of everything you're so sure of? Sure. Aren't you? No. No. Not as sure. Do things still come too easily? ""In a way he was like the country he lived in. Everything came too easily to him."" What made you remember that? I always wondered if it would stay true. Not altogether. What doesn't come easy now? Hotel rooms. Be serious. Do you know you're beautiful? You are. But you mustn't be too serious. I won't be. I won't be. Happy Rosh Hashanah! - What is it? - What do you mean, what is it? You get to see your old pal J.J. It'll be fun. We can all be decadent and eat eggs Benedict... ...and vote Republican. - I don't like eggs Benedict. - Really? - I'll bet you were a cheerleader. - Me? - Come on. - No! Maybe you'll have a good time. Paper doll that I can call my own A doll that other fellows.... Boy, this is some Navy you're in, J.J. Hi, Hub. You mean all this? It belongs to my aunt. Is that the one that plays the accordion? Does she really play the accordion? - She got squeezed to death. - She did not. She's gone overseas. She's with the USO. Best USO? - Come on. - I got it. Hollywood and Vine. Best USO hostess? Tallulah Bankhead. I hope your aunt's under Patton. You can bet she's under somebody. Excuse me. All right. - Okay. How about-- Gardiner? - Wait a second. - Best small hotel. - Not fair. I haven't been abroad. But it's in Switzerland. We don't want to make any bad jokes. Saint Regis in Paris. Pretty, isn't it? You look different. It's my hair. I have it ironed. - You what? - In Harlem. I actually have friends in Harlem. I'm sure you do. Would you like me to disapprove? But how long has this been going on? I mean, Hubbell Gardiner and K-K-K-Katie Morosky. - No. No, she looks terrific. - I like her, J.J. - You really haven't changed, have you? - Neither have you. As pretty as ever. For a while. I'm with J.J. now. Are you? Excuse me. Remember how she looked in college compared to now? - Can I get you a drink? - I don't think so. - What were you doing? - She seemed upset. You do it. You make yourself feel out of place. I feel like I'm here for drinks and everyone else gets supper. Try talking to them. - I have. - No you don't. You don't talk, you lecture. What was that speech about Yalta? No one here needs you to explain it. Then why all those silly jokes? J.J. called Roosevelt the ""Yaltese Falcon."" I thought it was pretty funny. And selling your novel to Hollywood? I hope that's meant to be funny. - Why? - Why? Because you're too good for Hollywood, that's why. Maybe I'd be lucky to sell a book to Hollywood. You've never even been there! Besides, this isn't the point. Can't we just relax and enjoy the party? You get onto politics, and your sense of humour goes right out the window. I guess there are just some things that are... ...difficult for me to laugh about, Hubbell. Than have a fickle-minded Real live girl I'm sorry. I got caught up at the studio and... ...then I met somebody from the party who wondered-- What? What? The first eight chapters. You want to read it, read it. But let's not discuss it. All right. If you don't like it, you have to say you don't like it and why. What if I like it? Waiter? Ahoy. Come in. How you doing? Fine. Is that new? It was in the other room. Looks good there. Plants are all growing. How's your mother? Much better, like the news. I might be able sell my book to Hollywood. I know, J.J. told me. What do you think about that? About living in sunshine all year long... ...and going to work in a sports car? Sailing. Sounds wonderful. Would you like a drink? No. No, I just stopped. I was out walking. Hey, thanks. I love the way you write. Franklin Roosevelt is dead. Most of you have already heard the news. But it will take days, perhaps weeks, even months... ...for the final tragedy of what happened at 5:45 this morning... ...to be fully comprehended. What seems particularly touching is that he will not be here... ...to share in a victory so close at hand. Did you go see it? I was talking to.... There was this older guy... ...on, you know, that steel platform between cars? I helped him open a big door, he needed air. Jesus, I can't even remember when he wasn't President. A fourth term was too much for the old man. A third was too much for my old man. - At least it'll end those Eleanor jokes. - Some were funny. How about Eleanor in the mine with the hillbillies? Her face was covered with grime, right? Grime? For chrissakes, Judianne, Eleanor went down into... ...a mine and got her face black with coal. The hillbillies saw her... ...big buckteeth shining-- Her husband is dead! Dead. Yes, Mrs. Roosevelt went down into the mines. And when they asked her why, she said, ""I am my husband's legs."" Did you tell cripple jokes too? Is there anything that isn't a joke? Sorry. Who makes up jokes anyway? J.J.'s old man. Scads of swell material here for a good novel. If you wanna write about this. People who tell jokes instead of feeling something. Let's meet every five years... ...or every time a President conks. Whichever's sooner! - What are you doing? - What are we doing here? J.J.'s gonna buy your book and we're all gonna go to Hollywood? Take it easy. Lots of writers went there. Fitzgerald-- - He's dead! - I know that. It's none of your business anyway. He died of booze... - ...and people like you! - Damn it, stop it! He's sorry for the joke. Why did you bring me here? Couldn't we have gone for a walk... - ...or sit on a bench? - I didn't want to feel sadder. - What's wrong with feeling sadder? - It won't help! The President died! And everything in the world that happens doesn't just happen to you. Behave yourself. I don't care about behaving myself! Then don't. Do what you want. I wanna get out of here. All right. I meant us. And then what? See you later, Katie. Oh, yeah, see you. Good night, my beauty. You can finish in the morning. Cheer up. I'm about to have a big night and I wanna think of you as smiling. Good night, Billy. Hi. Hi. Gee, I thought you got sent overseas. Could I talk to you? Sure. Listen, I was a bad girl. I know that. But I'm better now. It was like a tantrum. I get them from time to time. It's like an eclipse. - I'm sorry. - Don't apologize. I wanted to have an apology dinner. I thought I'd fill my icebox-- I'm a pain in the ass, aren't I? I go to swearing school now. Soundproof school. I'm up to the F's. I'm taking a laughing course and studying Protestant cookery. Don't. Are you finished? Look, Katie-- Please don't start with ""Look."" It's always bad news. I don't think we're gonna make it, Katie. Why? I just don't think it's gonna work, that's all. I was too easy for you. Easy? I don't mean sexually. I mean easy like everything is for you. You really think you're easy? Compared to what? The Hundred Years' War? You're so ready to fight, you have no time to understand. Counterattack, politics, revolution, cause! That's all fine for you. So stay with it. I admire it. - Up to a point. - That's right! Okay, okay! Don't belabour it. I get it. I get it. I don't fit on Beekman Place, that's what's really wrong. - You think that's what I'm talking-- - Yes! No demands, just fun, laughs. Good! Go! Go have a good time on Beekman Place. You wanna end it like a gentleman, you have. So get out! Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I'm calm now, Hubbell. You can go. It's me. Hubbell.... Wait a minute, hold on. Don't go away. Listen, Hubbell... ...this is kind of peculiar. I know that I don't have to apologize for what I said because... ...I know that you know. And... ...I also know that you... ...you know that I don't feel exactly bright-eyed and bushy-tailed... ...as J.J. would say. Anyway, the peculiar thing is... ...it's really a request, you know, a favour. You see, I can't sleep, Hubbell... ...it would help me so much if you could.... Well, if I had someone to talk to. You know, if I had a best friend or something... ...to talk about it with. Only you're my best friend. Isn't that dumb? So dumb. You're the best friend I ever had. It would help me so much if you'd come over and see me through tonight. Hubbell, I promise I won't touch you... ...or beg you... ...or embarrass you. But I have to talk to my best friend about someone we both know. So could-- Hubbell, could you please come over right away, please? There's some sleeping pills in the cabinet. Here. Isn't one enough? No. I'm scared. Take them. Will you stay till I fall asleep? I'm really sorry. But that's what best friends are for. Aren't they? There's something I wanna ask you. Hope this doesn't make me drunk instead of sleepy. Don't drink it like water. Is it because I'm not attractive enough? I'm not fishing, really. I'm not. I know I'm attractive. Sort of. But... ...I'm not attractive in the-- I'm not attractive in the right way. Am I? I mean... ...I don't have the right style... ...for you. Do I? Be my friend. You don't have the right style. I'll change. Don't. You're your own girl. You have your own style. But then I won't have you. Why can't I have you? Why? Because you push too hard. Every damn minute. There's no time to relax and enjoy living. Everything's too serious. I push too hard because I want things to be better. I want us to be better, you to be better. Sure I make waves, you have to. I'll keep making them... ...till you're everything you should be. You'll never find anyone to believe in you this much or love you as much. - I know that. - Well then, why? You think if I come back it'll be okay by magic? What'll be different? - We'll be wrong. We'll both lose. - Couldn't we both win? I like Hollywood. I like Alice Faye. Don't. Don't. No, please. Somebody's getting up. Aren't you sleepy? You are. I'm exhausted. Katie, you expect so much. Oh, but look what I've got. Jesus! Your director lives here? Actually, he lives off the garage. The servants live here. How can he work here? Bissinger doesn't work, he's the director. As long as you're writing in France by next fall, I don't care. - Everybody's here. - Everybody who's anybody. - No ice skating rink? - It's in the cellar. - Hubbell! - Hi, George. George Bissinger. Glad you came. My wife, Vicki. - How are you? - It's Kate, isn't it? It's Katie. - Can I get you a drink? - No, thanks. Rhea! I want you to meet my agent. Reportedly the greatest in town. If I were a great agent, would I be an agent? - Nice to meet you. - You think those are croquet balls... ...but it's her collection of shrunken heads. Have you seen the Bissinger collection? You think these Hollywood intellectuals plan to overthrow the government? They couldn't overthrow Louella Parsons. In '37, in Munich, Hitler was a joke too. Paula Reisner, our resident pessimist. Sorry. I'm sorry. They're coming to investigate all us communist subversives. They're out to get election yardage from the silver screen. They're getting people to testify secretly. Horses' asses. Maybe. But we can't even write our congressman. He's on the committee. Your shot, George. - Alice in Wonderland. Come on. - Thank you. You're not home making the script brilliant? Listen to the producer. You don't even understand it. I'm glad you came. I was gonna call you. I'm giving J.J. a birthday party. - 45, huh? - You gotta come as a Marx Brother. - K-K-Katie, you could come as Karl. - Still stuttering? I'm not coming as Groucho. Come as Harpo, that way you won't be able to talk. I think your director's an idiot. Too high? Too low? Trying to tell me something? What? He's here? In the room? Good God! Ten years in Leavenworth, 11 years in Twelveworth, or 5 and 10 in Woolworth. --to control thought. Censorship. Let's not dramatize this. It'll all blow over. - That line is necessary. - It's the point of the whole scene. The point's made by the dancers in red, white and blue. There are no dancers in his book. You can't just have dancers. Please. Brooks, if we get this organized, you've got to talk. - I can't talk in front-- - Come on, Brooks. - It's gorgeous if you do. - I'll write, all right? He doesn't understand. - I never liked his movies anyway. - ""Honk-honk,"" said the duck. You rang? Your wish is my command. This morning I shot an elephant in my pyjamas.... - What are you hungry for? - I'm hungry for your absence. --meeting at my house Sunday. - George, is Paula Reisner a Red? - My heavens, I don't know. Why? - It's something I heard. - You listen to the wrong people. Come on. I have an early day. - He thinks Bissinger's right. - How dare you-- - Hey. - Hey, what? Could you stop? This is coming out in French. Maybe Bissinger will like it better in French. Taste this. How is it? It's great. I'll study French cooking while you finish your novel. Done much thinking about it? No, not much. Well, it's very hard here, you know. But when we're ensconced in our villa.... How about you? Have you read any good books lately? No, but I wrote two reports of books that haven't been written yet. - You'll get the sack. - I'll go back to brain surgery. They never read my synopses anyway. They just pay me for them. Why don't you quit? After all, it's-- I'm laying a nice nest egg for France. - Italy. - France. - Spain? - Never. China, maybe. My phony synopsis takes place there. China? Public's fed up with Westerns, Myrna. High time we had an Eastern. Got a title? Shevuos! Exclamation point. Sounds catchy. There's a kibbutz of Chinese Jews living in a rice paddy. - And he--? - No, she cooks communist rice patties. He gets the idea-- Of calling them matzos. You read the book! Backwards. Oh, I got one for you. I can't take another one. Loudmouthed Jewish girl... ...from New York City, comes to Malibu, California... - ...tells her gorgeous goyisher guy... - Good alliteration. ...that she's pregnant, you see. And... ...and he just looks at her and.... Are you kidding? - Don't be afraid to touch. - I'm not. Get it, Katie, sweetheart! All right, one more time. - Hungry? - Answer the question! You have no right to make me name the names-- Sergeant! Take the witness away. You've just heard excerpts from today's... ...session of the House Un-American.... - I'll make the salad. - Thank you. Watch out, the paint takes forever to dry. - You'll be in Beverly Hills by then. - France, not Beverly Hills. Not if Hubbell gets the deal I'm working on. What deal? Three more pictures. Provided this one works out of course. - Think he's interested? - I certainly hope so. It'll mean a lot more money, Kate. You and Hubbell could live in style. I thought we did, Rhea. Pop sent me a list of names. ""For my grandson, the following names are okay with me: Thomas Jefferson Gardiner, Solomon David Gardiner... ...and Eugene V. Debs Gardiner."" What if it's a girl? If it's a girl, there's only one name, my mother's. Yeah, what's that? Rachel. So keep your fingers crossed. What's this picture about? Cowboys and Indians. Not too loud. Brooks wrote it. - Tonight, the Indians are the good guys. - Can you do that? Well, it's un-American, but we can try. I think I'm calm enough. Vicki, let's start. Don't try the trick with the sunglasses. I know when you're sleeping. --the best Western I've ever read. I mean it. There they are. Hey, Velez and Yolanda. - I saved you guys a seat. - Thank you. - We didn't miss anything, did we? - All right, Floyd. - How's my godchild? - Very happy. My God. What the hell is going on? - What did it, George? - Your Picasso! What's the trouble? Testing. Do you get us? What the hell is going on? We're being recorded. - Would you knock it off up there? - Floyd, stop it! Can't hear me. Floyd, hold it! I'm going to sue the U.S. government for that painting. We've got to do something. Do you have a lawyer? Shouldn't we let him know what happened? How do we know this room isn't bugged too? - This country wouldn't believe this. - They'll never know about this. We can't let this happen. We have rights. - Can't the studios do something? - We have got to do something. We. Bissinger says this scene isn't necessary. I told him he's wrong. What do you think? - He's the director. - You're the producer! Easy, will you? Yeah, easy. Hey, Hub. Do you know what's going on over at your house? Sure. You know? Overthrowing the government, I suppose. Let's see, Sunday's volleyball.... Yeah, they like to overthrow the government on Monday. They're going to D.C. to challenge the committee... ...on the basis of the First Amendment. What? Well, well. - Think anybody knows what it says? - Katie does. That's for sure. Some actor comes up to me... ...and says this line doesn't make any sense. What do you think? If they go, it'll make more trouble. They may not have jobs to come back to. What do you want from me? Tell Katie to stay out of it. You tell her. I will. I'll buy tickets to that. Would you just tell her to go easy? Sure. You tell Bissinger to go easy. You're the producer. What's eating you? Nothing. The war's over, right? Movies.... Do you realize this is the first job we've ever had? Athletic Scholarship. Doesn't that count? Doesn't count, buddy. Well, then, Officer, Landing Craft, South Pacific? Nope. Why? We got paid $150 a month. Doesn't count. - You want a drink? - No. There's a little trouble at home. I have to keep my wits about me. Old Carol Ann. Don't take any crap. To the both of us. And all the absent friends, class of '37. - Is this the Gardiner house? - And I'm the gardener. - How are you doing? - Okay, so far-- Your lover chain smokes, no doubt to compensate for his extreme shortness. He has an enormous heart and no sense of humour. You found us out. Calls himself Brooks Kropatkin, but it's not his real name. - What is it? - Carpenter. Carpenter! Who told you that? J.J. With whom I was not drinking... ...since he no longer drinks due to trouble at home. Well, Carol Ann's 33. Not many moves left. Well, we're all 33, practically. Not you. Not the quiz kid. What were you, 16 in college? What's gonna happen? You're going to Washington. I meant with J.J. and Carol Ann. That's another house. In this house, the wife is going to D.C. Gonna take the baby with you? I thought I might. Nothing like an early education. I'd like her to learn not to be frightened. Her? Him. Why don't you come with us? We're kind of back where we started, aren't we? That's not true, Hubbell. Okay. Now why don't we all stay home? I can't. --and named the names of 14 of his fellow actors. He described their various associations... ...with subversive organizations. Ten men of the original 19 who refused to testify.... And there he is... ...Jack Armstrong, the all-American boy. - Hey, you look good. - I hate it! I like it! Isn't she lovely? America's sweetheart. Look at her go. I'd forgotten. She really was getting to those people. Take a look at some of those faces. Oh, she was a spellbinder. I'd forgotten about that. She's beautiful. I'm exhausted. Do you have any comment regarding the Hollywood 10? They're running toward martyrdom for nothing but their own destruction. They're standing up for principle. If you don't like this country, get out! It's my country too! They could've denied everything. They didn't want to. Can we do this someplace else? Why are you here? You might get put on a list. I refuse to be intimidated. Well, those 10 men feel exactly the same way. Free speech is all we're talking about. They're fighting for your right to make any movie you want. And all you can do is strut around here making simple remarks. Could we get a statement from Mrs. Gardiner? I'd like to ask these people why they think we just fought a war. What are you people afraid of? Shut your mouth, you commie bitch! You two wait here till the crowd clears. Are you okay? You're bleeding. I'm fine. It's always fun meeting trains, you know? I'm sorry, Hubbell. I really didn't expect this. You didn't expect to get a chance to tell off the world either. - Is that what you think I'm doing? - You bet I do. I'm not telling off the world. I'm just standing up for something I believe in. You're not angry when Bissinger ridicules those men? Calling them martyrs because they have guts... ...to fight for their Bill of Rights, his Bill of Rights and yours! We don't have any Bill of Rights. We'll never have free speech. We never will if people won't take a stand. We never will have because people are scared. This isn't college. This is grown-up politics, Katie. And it's stupid and dangerous. You're telling me to shut up because it's dangerous? I'm telling you it's a waste. And that those men are only gonna get hurt. And that nothing is gonna change. And after jail, after years of bad blood... ...when it's practical for a fascist producer to hire a communist writer... ...because his movie's in trouble, he'll do it. They'll make movies, have dinner, they'll play tennis... ...make passes at each other's wives. What did anybody go to jail for? For what? A political spat? You're telling me to close my eyes and watch people being destroyed... ...so you can work in a town that doesn't have spine enough... ...to stand up for anything but a buck! I'm telling you that people are more important than a goddamn witch hunt. You and me. Not causes. Not principles. Hubbell, people are their principles. The heads of the studios have reversed their positions... ...and any employee who... ...is an unfriendly witness before the committee is... ...fired. Oh, Jesus. So now we have an official blacklist. It's an open season for witch hunters... ...and stool pigeons. And now the problem is, how to convince the public... ...that a stool pigeon is a hero. You are like these damn palm trees. They don't belong here either. They were brought in and they look it. I'm sure that they don't like it either. - What if he does, Paula? - What is more important to you? He is. That's your choice, Katie. - Give him my love too. - I will. Thanks, Paula. It's no reflection on anything except that you're new to this... ...film technique. Especially for the novelist. He's too close to his own material. I'm not a novelist. I'd like to think of myself... ...as a screenwriter. I wanna be up front with you. I know what changes have to be made. But can you make them? Nobody else understands that story. Nobody knows it. It's mine. Mine. I know where it came from. I know what the heart of it is. You remember those few days before the war started. Before we had to change-- You don't lose what I know about it. Work with me. Work with me closely, fine. And I know the dialogue from the book is slowing the film up. But I can fix that. I learn fast. I always have. Things come-- Christ, I can do it. I know what you want. I know what your concept is. I'll make your changes. Let me. With no resistance? No. No resistance. Bad times? Can't be all bad. How's the picture? Troubled. I'm going back to New York. New York. When do you leave? Not until tomorrow. I'm getting rid of some things in my apartment. There's some champagne. For bon voyage. Well, it's getting better. Better.... It's most unusual. When it's slow, it seems necessary to be slow. Of course, with the audience.... Thank you, Paula, my dear. I'll have my brandy in bed. We'll conduct the postmortem tomorrow. Good night, Paula... ...Hubbell, J.J., silent Kate. Thank you, Floyd. Thank you very much. Good night, Mr. Bissinger. J.J., shall we go and have some wine? You will tell me your problems... ...and I'll tell you how the un-American gentlemen... ...offered to give me some names to name in Washington. Take care, darling. True to life. So true to life. I'll be up late, case you guys wanna stop by on your way to the beach. Well, that was a gripping experience. ""So true to life, darling."" The only picture she hasn't knocked is Potemkin. Probably a dyke anyway. She is not. She has two grandchildren. Katie, the day you die, you'll still be a nice Jewish girl. Are you still a nice gentile boy? I never was. I only looked it to you. - That's not true. - Oh, yes, it is. When you love someone, from Roosevelt to me, you go deaf, dumb and blind. Not blind, Hubbell. And certainly not dumb. Who told you? A friend. Some friend. Well, it's a friendly town... ...if you don't mind having your friends inform on you. I suppose you'll say it doesn't mean anything. It doesn't. Your picture will be a smash, Hubbell. Congratulations. But you didn't like it. Let's say I appreciated it. What didn't you like? Are you finished for the night, sir? Yes. Thank you. Why did you have to go with her? Tell me I'm not good enough. Tell me I talk too much. You don't like my perfume, my family, my pot roast. But you didn't have to go back to Beekman Place, did you? Katie, what's wrong with us... ...has nothing to do with another girl. Oh, give up. Please. I can't. I hate what you did to your book. I hate the picture. I hate the palm trees. I wish it would rain. Oh, I want.... I want.... What? I want us to love each other. Give me a beer. Coming up, skipper. There you go. What the hell. It doesn't matter anyway. She wasn't much. Don't get sloppy. You had some good days. It's the rum. No excuse, buddy. It's not like, you know... ...losing somebody like Katie. That would be a loss. Best Saturday afternoon? 1933, when ""Brute"" Holland was out with a bad knee. Best month? April. Best year? Best year.... No, '45.... It's amazing how decisions are forced on you willy-nilly. You never did want to finish your book, did you? I don't know. I never thought there was much point. And you never really wanted to go to France, did you? No, I didn't. You wanted me to. Oh, boy. Oh, girl. Are you all right? Wouldn't it be lovely if we were old? We'd have survived all this. Everything would be easy and uncomplicated. The way it was when we were young. It was never uncomplicated. But it was lovely. Wasn't it? Yeah. It was lovely. Will you do me one favour, Hubbell? Stay with me till the baby's born? More flowers for you, Mrs. Gardiner. I thought.... - It's a nice room. - Yeah, it is. Did you get your father? I'd like to call her Rachel. Fine. Did you see her yet? She's little. I've got the crib together. Oh, you don't have it ironed anymore! - What? - Your hair. No, I don't. It's pretty. Thank you. Still married? Sure. What are you doing in New York? I've been writing a TV show. Really? There's an experience. It happens so fast. Shoot it in one day, live, on the air. Everybody in a constant state of panic. You remember how radio was. Same thing... ...only with cameras. And craziness! Make a great comic novel. It sounds wonderful, really. Your taxi's ready, sir. I'm awfully late. Please call and come for a drink? It's the only David X. Cohen in the book. What's the ""X"" for? The only David X. Cohen in the book. I'm sorry I'm late. How are we doing, huh? Oh, wonderful. We've got 122 on that one. And Charlene called. She's doing great. - Marvellous. - Wonderful. That's a good one too, don't you think? What about Eileen? You never give up, do you? Only when I'm absolutely forced to. But I'm a very good loser. Better than I am. Well, I've had... ...more practise. Your girl is lovely, Hubbell. Bring her for a drink when you come. I can't come, Katie. I can't. I know. How is she? She is just beautiful. You would be so proud of her. I'm glad. Is he a good father? Yes. Very. Good. See you, Katie. See you, Hubbell. Ban the bomb! Join the thousands of Americans who are protesting the use...., - I'm Statler. - I'm Waldorf. We're here to heckle The Muppet Movie. Gentlemen, that's straight ahead. Private screening room D. - Private screening? - Yeah, they're afraid to show it in public. STATLER: Oh, oh. Look at this place. What a dump. WALDORF: Bunch of weirdos around here. Look at 'em. - Yes, I know you all want to sit with moi. - Hey, lady. Is this seat taken? Hey, you! Hey! Bring that back. I'm so nervous. If I'm not funny, I won't be able to live with myself. Well, then you'll have to get another apartment, won't you? You know, I hear this movie is dynamite. Get your fresh organic popcorn. Only a buck. Honey. Buy me some, please. Sure, Momma. Nothin's too good for my woman. Woman! Woman! Woman! - Well, I like the movie fine so far. - It hasn't started yet. - That's what I like about it. - (BOTH CHUCKLING) Yie, yie, yie, yie, yie! Do it. Yay! (LAUGHING) Oh, hey, Mr. The Frog. Is it okay for me and my boomerang fish to be in your movie? Hey! I told you, Lew. Not in the movie or at the screening. Hey, but watch. Whoa! (CLEARS THROAT) Kermit, does this film have socially redeeming value? Oh, I... I certainly hope so, Sam. Sorry about that. - Kermie. - Oh, hi, Piggy. Kermie, I tried to save you a seat, but somebody took it. Hi, everybody, and welcome to the first screening of The Muppet Movie. But before we begin, I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this film, starting with the little people, from the hairdressers to special effects. That's enough of that, Harry. - (ALL CLAMORING) - Boom! Blow it up. Ka-boom! - MUPPET: Boring. - To the costume designers. - To the prop makers. - MISS PIGGY: Kermie, Kermie. Speeches are not necessary, dear. Roll film. Yeah, but I'd like to thank everybody for all of their hard work and their patience - and their... - Roll film! Roll film! Roll film. Excuse me. Uncle Kermit, is this about how the Muppets really got started? Well, it's sort of approximately how it happened. KERMIT: (SINGING) Why are there so many songs about rainbows And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions But only illusions And rainbows have nothing to hide So we've been told And some choose to believe it I know they're wrong, wait and see Someday we'll find it The rainbow connection The lovers, the dreamers and me Who said that every wish Would be heard and answered When wished on the morning star? Somebody thought of that And someone believed it Look what it's done so far What's so amazing That keeps us stargazing? And what do we think we might see? Someday we'll find it The rainbow connection The lovers, the dreamers and me All of us under its spell We know that it's probably magic Have you been half asleep? And have you heard voices? I've heard them calling my name Is this the sweet sound That calls the young sailors? The voice might be one and the same I've heard it too many times to ignore it It's something that I'm supposed to be Someday we'll find it The rainbow connection The lovers, the dreamers and me MAN: Help! Hello. This is a serious call for help. - Yeah? - Someone help. Ah, I... Oh, oh. You, you with the banjo. Can you help me? I have lost my sense of direction. Have you tried Hare Krishna? Ha, ha. No. - No. I mean I'm really lost. - (FLY BUZZING) One second. Darn, I missed. You know, that's the first thing to go on a frog. His tongue. The tongue goes and you can't catch flies. That's rough. I'm sorry about your tongue, but I have to get out of this swamp. I have to catch a plane. With that tongue? No way. But seriously, there's a boat dock just downstream. - Thank you. - Just watch out for the alligators. I will. - Alligators? - That's right. Did you say alligators? Read my lips, alligators. It's just that I'm not used to alligators where I come from. See, I'm an agent. I... I winged in from Hollywood. - Hollywood? - That's right. Did you say Hollywood? Read my lips, Hollywood. You know... Hollywood The dream factory, the magic store. Hey, don't you ever go to the movies? Oh, sure. There's a double feature in town every Saturday. - Wait a minute. - What? There's an ad in here that you should be very interested in. - Feast your eyes on that. - Uh... ""World Wide Studios announces open auditions for frogs ""wishing to become rich and famous."" Well, thanks anyway, but I'm really pretty happy where I am. Oh, oh, if I were you, I would give this audition very careful consideration. You've got talent, kid. Singin', tellin' jokes. I mean, if you get your tongue fixed, who knows? You could make millions of people happy. - Millions of people happy? - Millions. Hey, if you ever come west to Hollywood, look me up. Bernie the Agent. Hey, well, listen, Bernie, why don't you say hello to Arnie the Alligator? - What? - Arnie. Arnie, wait a minute. Careful, Arnie. Stay! Stay! Arnie, that's okay. Leave him alone. It's all right, he's from Hollywood. Hollywood. Gee. I... I'd miss this old swamp, but... Millions of people happy. What the... MAN: Okay, okay, you guys. Now, come on. Do what I tell you. I don't know where you're... All right, now... Don't step on that asphalt! I told you not to step on it. We gotta get this... Off the asphalt! I told you, stay off the asphalt! Hey, look at him. Oh, big legs. MAN: Hey, you on the bike! Watch out! Watch out! - Watch out! - Oh, my... Ah! Watch out! Oh! Hmm. That's pretty dangerous, building a road in the middle of the street. I mean, if frogs couldn't hop, I'd be gone with the Schwinn. KERMIT: The El Sleezo Cafe. Hmm. Foreign food. Doesn't smell promising, but a frog's gotta eat. KERMIT: Wow. Rough place, huh? That's the toughest, meanest, filthiest, pesthole on the face of the Earth. Well, why not complain to the owner? I am the owner. MAN: Watch out. Hot plates comin' through. Look out. All right, you got your French-fried frog legs on Cotton. You got your frog legs on Eugenie. You got your frog legs stroganoff. - Everybody happy? All right. - Ugh! Hello, sailor. Buy me a drink? Well, you see, I'm not a sailor, I'm a frog. Cut the small talk and buy me a drink. - But I don't even know you. - Hey. You makin' a move on my girl? - No, sir. - He did, too. He touched me. Ugh! Go wash. You'll get warts. - No, you see, that's just a myth. - Yeah, but she's my ""myth."" - No, no. Myth, myth. - Yeth? What the hey? Showtime. Showtime at the El Sleezo. PIANIST: And now, filling in for the vacationing El Sleezo dancing girls, the funny, furry, fabulous Fozzie Bear. Wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka. Hey, you're a great crowd. Thank you, thank you and thank you. - Hey, wacka, wacka. - (HONKING) Ah, wacka, wacka, wacka. Here I am, Fozzie Bear, to tell you jokes both old and rare. Wacka, wacka, wacka. Ha, ha. Let's start things off with a bang. Thank you, sir. Wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka. This guy's lost. Maybe he should try Hare Krishna. Grief, it's a running gag. Uh... There was this sailor who was so fat... How fat was he? Uh... He was so fat that everybody liked him and there was nothing funny about him at all. FOZZIE: No problem. Oh, wait, please. Oh, please. Please wait. I'm trying so hard. Please don't do that. I'm a professional. I've had three performances. - Cut, cut, please. - Do you know any dance routines? What? Not really. Do you? - Play something snappy. - You got it. - Now dance. - What? - Dance. - Yes, sir. Ah! Wacka, wacka. Aha, wacka, wacka. Ah! It's too bad the dancing girls are on vacation. The crowd is getting ugly. Ha, ha. You think this crowd's ugly, you should see the dancing girls. FOZZIE: Two, three, four. - Two, three, kick. - Kick. Yeah, sorry. Coming home. FOZZIE: Argh! Please. I just cleaned the fur. Please. Oh. I hope you appreciate that I'm doing all my own stunts. Wacka wacka. Okay, everybody. Drinks on the house. Drinks on the house! Man, come on, let's go. - Drinks on the house. - Go, go. On the house. MAN: Drinks on the house. I don't see no drinks up here. What's he talkin' about? The bartender said there were drinks on the house. Works every time. Well... Well, hey, listen. My name is Kermit the Frog and I'm on my way to Hollywood. - Hollywood? - You wanna join me? Big-time show biz. That's always been my dream. Yeah, well, they're holding auditions for frogs next week. And if they need frogs, they must need bears, too. Oh. My car's right outside. Gee, a Studebaker. Where did you get it? - My uncle left it to me. - Huh? Is he dead? No, he's hibernating. You know, Fozzie, you really do have a lot of talent. Thank you. You know, how about you and me putting together an act? Oh, no. Sorry. I only work as a single. Oh, okay. All right. You talked me into it. We'll be a team. Oh, good. - What's this? - Hey, you better pull over here. Yes, sir. - (BANGING) - FOZZIE: Ah. Hey, what's going on? Howdy, Mr. Frog. - I'm a businessman with a proposition. - What? Let me show you somethin' that might change your whole life. Huh. Hop right on over here, my little green friend. - Listen, mister. - That's it. This is the kind of chance you can't afford to pass up. - (GASPS) - No, now, don't be afraid. - Watch the window. - Hm. - KERMIT: What's that? - FOZZIE: Ah. - (KERMIT GASPS) - Hi, I'm Doc Hopper, invitin' you to hop on down and get some Hopper's French-fried frog legs. Right here at the sign of the bright green legs. - Good grief. - Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Frog legs, frog legs, frog legs are fine Hopper's is the place you should dine There's cheese legs Bacon legs, chili legs too French-fried frog legs barbecued Oh, Fozzie. Ugh. If you want just a snack Don't worry. Then here is the one A frog leg burger on a bright green bun That is terrible. That's the most appalling, disgusting, revolting thing I've ever seen. I know. I'm a great businessman and a sweet fella, but I do lack the skills of a performer. You also make a lousy frog. You, on the other hand, make a terrific frog. - What? - He's right, you know. - You are very likable, Kermit. - The bear's right. You, my little likable friend, are gonna do all our television commercials. - No way. - Hold it. Now, just a minute. There's $500 in it for you up-front. $500 is just the beginning. You could be earning this much every year. - Let's go, Fozzie. Would you consider a bear in a frog suit? - Fozzie. - Yes, sir. I just lost my head. I... Now, just a minute, Mr. Frog. Everything's negotiable. - FOZZIE: Okay, here we go, here we go. - (BANGING) - FOZZIE: Sorry. - Hey, that's my Caddy! - Just get it in gear, Fozzie. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. HOPPER: Frog, it's money we're talking about. Max! - Follow that frog. - (TIRES SQUEAL) - Max! - (BRAKES SCREECH) Follow that frog with me in the car! I'm sorry, Doc. I just got excited.

You see what I mean? Kermit the Frog, symbol of Doc Hopper's French-fried frog legs. Isn't that splendid? Just splendid. Just take a look at it. All I can see are millions of frogs on tiny crutches. Now, listen, boy. Don't you wanna be rich and famous? - Not workin' for you, I don't. - That's right. - Crutches? - Shut up, Max. We're a small-time operation, but we're expandin'. Expandin', just like you frogs expand. Don't you frogs expand? - That's a myth. - What? Myth! Myth! Yeth? BOTH: Huh? - Come on, Bear. Burn rubber. - Yes, sir. Hey, Frog! That's the second time! Max, I've done my best with that frog. Now's the time to do my worst. - Open the door. - No! You open the door. - What? - I'm through, Doc. The frog is right. You're asking him to do something terrible. I can't be a part of it. It's a moral decision and I'll stand by it. - I'll double your percentage. - I'll open the door. FOZZIE: Kermit, where are we? Well, let's see. We were just traveling down this little black line here. And we just crossed that little red line over here. Well, how about... Let's take the blue line, huh? - No, we can't take that. That's a river. - Oh, I knew that. - Yeah, sure. - Listen, Kermit, why don't we just go... - Fozzie. Fozzie. - Huh. Yeah? Who's driving? - KERMIT: Look out! Stop! - FOZZIE: No problem. - Okay, back it up. - Ah, yes, sir. - Fozzie, where did you learn to drive? - I took a correspondence course. This looks like a nice quiet spot. Uh-huh. Boy, it feels like we've been driving for days. Yeah. Funny, I'm still wide awake. Yeah, me, too. Me, too. - (BAND PLAYING) - What? What? What? I'm up, I'm up. What's that? They don't look like Presbyterians to me. Hey, cool it, everybody. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Our gentle mornin' melodies have attracted wanderin' admirers. - Hey, who are you guys? - We am, is, are and be they whom as are known as the Electric Mayhem. - (LAUGHING) - For sure. He's Dr. Teeth. Golden teeth and golden tones. Welcome to my presence. - Thank you. - Fozzie. - I'm Floyd, I blow bass. - And I'm... I'm... Zoot. Sax is your ax. Uh-oh. Zoot's skipped a groove again. Wow, like, I'm Janice. I'm lead guitar, for surely. Oh, yeah. That's Animal. Show 'em what you do, Animal. I want to eat drums. No, no. Beat drums, beat drums. Beat drums. Beat drums. - Down, Animal.

We couldn't go anywhere without him. - He's the man with the contacts? - No, he's the man with the van. Yeah, we're takin' this old church and turnin' it into a coffeehouse. Yeah, with real good music and organic refreshments. It'll be so fine and laid-back and mellow and profitable. ANIMAL: Profitable. Yeah, but what brings you dudes here? Listen, see, Kermit here, he was living in the swamp... - Fozzie. ...and then a fisherman came along. Fozzie, you can't tell 'em the whole story. You'll bore the audience. Oh, sorry. But, Kermit, the band here wants to know. Well, let 'em read the screenplay. Ah! Yes, sir. Uh... You see, it starts here on page one. The Muppet Movie, huh? Hmm. Let's see. ""Exterior. Swamp. Day. In a long helicopter shot, ""we discover Kermit the Frog playin' his banjo and singin'. ""A Hollywood agent starts the frog travelin' west. ""Doc Hopper comes on strong and they get to this church. ""Interior. Church. Day. ""Fozzie. 'They don't look like Presbyterians to me.' ""Kermit and Fozzie come walkin' down the aisle ""to the thunderously loud music of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem."" - Which am us. - For sure, for sure. This is a narrative of very heavy-duty proportions. Yeah. Cosmic, man. We gotta keep his little froggy self away from this Hopper dude. Too true, too true. It is indeed a problem for us to probosculate upon. But it seems to me that the frog and the bear are temporarily out of service. Oh, wow, like, what can we do to help them? - Well, if this were the movies... - Which it is. ...we'd think of a clever plot device. Like disguising their car so they won't be recognized. Right. Two, three, four. Oh, yeah! Whoo! All right. Everybody's lover, everybody's brother I wanna be your lifetime friend Crazy as a rocket, nothin' in my pocket I'll keep it at the rainbow's end I never think of money I think of milk and honey Grinnin' like a Cheshire cat I focus on the pleasure Somethin' I can treasure Can you picture that?

Can you picture? You gotta see it in your mind Can you picture? You know it's quick and easy to find Can you picture? You don't have to buy a frame Can you picture? Can you picture that? - Use it if you need it - Don't forget to feed it Can you picture that? FLOYD: Great job. Doc Hopper will never recognize you now. - I don't know how to thank you guys. - I don't know why to thank you guys. Our pleasure, green stuff. Are you sure you won't come with us to Hollywood? Can't, baby, but when you get rich and famous, maybe we'll show up and exploit your wealth. Movin' right along, Fozzie. ANIMAL: Bye-bye. Bye-bye. (CHANTING) Hollywood! Hollywood! Hollywood! Hollywood! Hollywood! Hollywood! HOPPER: Remember, this frog does everything. He talks, he sings, he dances. He tells jokes. He even rides a bicycle. Max, find me a frog and a bear in a tan Studebaker. Gee, Doc. All I can see is a frog and a bear in a rainbow-colored Studebaker. What? - Fozzie, they're right behind us. - I know, I know. - Well, how did they recognize us? - They recognized you. - What do you mean? - There's a hundred bears around. I'm gaining on 'em, Doc. I'm gaining on 'em. - Can't you drive any faster? - No, sir. There's a sign up ahead there. Pull in front of that. - Move. Now duck. - What? - Get down, Fozzie. - Yes, sir. Aha! - GONZO: Oh, yeah? - (CLUCKING) GONZO: Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, I tell you, Camilla, great plumbers are born, not made. I'm a prince of plunger, fair maiden. GONZO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll do that. But first, wait till we get there. Fozzie, look at that funny little truck. Yeah, it's cute, huh? - No, it's coming straight at us. - (CLUCKS) KERMIT: We're gonna hit. We missed it. Oh, you call that a miss? GONZO: Well, I'm getting in your car. FOZZIE: Oh, boy. You guys okay? Why are you hopping up and down? Because I'm hopping mad. Guy's got a sense of humor. - Hey, why don't you join us? - Where are you going? - We're following our dream. - Really? I have a dream, too. - KERMIT AND FOZZIE: Huh? - But you'll think it's stupid. - KERMIT: No, I won't. - FOZZIE: Tell us, tell us. Well, I wanna go to Bombay, India and become a movie star. CAMILLA: Ah. You don't go to Bombay to become a movie star. You go where we're going, Hollywood. Sure, if you wanna do it the easy way. We picked up a weirdo. KERMIT: Hey, look up ahead. There's Mad Man Mooney's. - FOZZIE: What's that? - KERMIT: It's a used-car lot. I think we can trade in both these old cars and get one big one. FOZZIE: Wait. Trade in my uncle's Studebaker? KERMIT: Sure. FOZZIE: Oh, when he wakes up, he'll kill me. KERMIT: You're swinging this turn very wide, Fozzie. FOZZIE: Well, hold it, will you? Just... Here we go. Up the bump. KERMIT: There we go. Hold on. All right. Pull up ahead there. - FOZZIE: Look at these cars. - GONZO: Kermit, Kermit, Kermit. - Are you gonna sell my plunger, too? - There's all kinds of great cars. FOZZIE: No, he's not gonna sell your plunger. KERMIT: Look at 'em up there. Pull it up a little further here, Fozzie. FOZZIE: Where should I stop? - How should I stop? - KERMIT: A little bit farther. - GONZO: Easy, easy. - FOZZIE: Okay. Here? - KERMIT: Everybody out of the car. - FOZZIE: Okay. Chickens first. Oh, my dear friends. Welcome to Mad Man Mooney's hubcap heaven. Today... Today is your lucky day. - It is? - Yes, it is. You, for example... - You're driving the wrong car. - I am? I can put you in this German street machine for only $2,000, less a $12 trade-in on your old vehicle. Now, this... This car is one of the greatest... Detachable fenders for narrow garages. No, thanks. Hey, what is this pile of... Jack, get rid of this heap. Come out here! - What? What? - What's the matter with you? - That's my jack. - Oh, hi, Jack. Jack not name. Jack job. How many times have I told you not to talk to the customers? - Gee, I know, but... - Just move this. Move it. You understand? FOZZIE: Wow. Ah! But seriously, friends, Mad Man Mooney doesn't believe in all that dealing and wheeling. No, the price on the sticker is the price you pay. - And never more and never less. - (FLY BUZZING) Ha. We'll take that one for $11.95. What? Less our $12 trade-in. You owe us a nickel. Oh, thank you very much. Hey, we're all going to Hollywood. - Do you wanna come with us? - Hollywood? That's strange, he just ran away. Well, movin' right along, Fozzie. - Yes, sir. - (CLUCKING) KERMIT: Hey, watch where you're going now, Fozzie. FOZZIE: Yes, sir. Hey! Hey, where are you goin'? Hey! Wait for me. I wanna go to Hollywood. Hey, wait for me! Come on, guys. Wait! Please! I wanna go to Hollywood. Testing, one, two, three. Testing. Can you hear me? Well, it's time to announce the winner of this year's Bogen County beauty pageant. MAN: We sure grow 'em purdy around here, don't we? All right. Here they are. - MAN: The first runner-up... - What's over there, Kermit? - MAN: Is Debbie-Sue Anderson. - Over there. See? Ah! Nice-looking girls, huh? - Wow. Nice-looking chickens. - What? - Oh, no hard feelings, honey. - MAN: Before announcing the winner, I think we should thank the judges of today's contest, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. You're not gonna believe who the winner is, folks. - Come, now, Charlie. It's their movie. - So it is. So it is. And here she is, folks. This year's Miss Bogen County... Miss Piggy! Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Thank you. Wow, it's a pig. Did you see that? Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Oh. Oh, Debbie-Sue. Oh, Elma-Jane. Thank you. Thank you. Ohh. Thank you. Oh, oh, thank you. Oh, kissy-kissy. Kissy-kissy. Oh, thank you. Oh. - Kermit, you know... - Not... Not right now, Fozzie. I just want to say one thing. This is the happiest moment of my... (SINGING) Never before Have two souls joined so freely And so fast For me this is the first time And the last Is this an angel's wish For men? Never before And never again And where to find the words To sing its worth This love was bound for heaven Not for Earth This love was meant To light the stars But when we touched We made it ours And could they take it back? Oh, no, they wouldn't dare Why should they take it back When there's enough To share with all the world And fill the heavens above With leftover love? Never before A love that keeps on growing On and on To fill each lover's heart And light the dawn Is this an angel's wish For men? Never before And never again Never before And never again - Oh, oh. - Thanks. Excuse me. - Oh, yes. Of course. - Yeah. Listen, congratulations on winning the beauty contest. Thank you. Of course, normally, I don't do anything so trivial. - I am an actress-model. - Oh, is that right? Well... I... I'm gonna be a performer, too. Oh. Hey, Kermit. Who's the cute-lookin' pig? I beg your pardon. If you were a chicken, you'd be impeccable. Gonzo. Hey, I thought we were gonna go get some ice cream. Oh, well, in a minute. I'll join you. Um... Well... What are you doing in town, short, green and handsome? Well... We're headed west. - Really? - Yeah, but... You know, I really should join my friends for ice cream. Oh. You... You wanna come along? Me? You mean it? Oh. I'll be right back. Oh, oh. Don't move. Hmm. Hello. I'd like an ice cream. What do you want? Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, peach fudge, rum, banana? - Honey. - Honey? I beg your pardon. I hardly know you. Ah. But seriously, I'd like a honey ice cream cone for me. And a dragonfly ripple for my friend, the frog. Okay. One honey cone for the bear. - And one dragonfly ripple for the frog. - Ugh! - Don't get 'em mixed up. - Gotcha. All right, all right, Camilla. I'll get you a balloon, but you have to pick the color. Red or green? - Can I give you a word of advice? - GONZO: What? Why not take both? What a wild idea. Yeah. A beautiful chicken like that deserves two balloons. - You're right. - I have guys come in all the time. Sometimes they get a bunch of balloons for their girls. - They go gaga for it. - Gaga? I'll take the whole bunch. Gaga. Gaga. Aw. Gonzo? Wonder... Where they went? Fozzie? FOZZIE: Kermit. Kermit. Hey, Kermit. Hey. Where's your pig friend? Well, I'm not really sure. She said she was coming for ice cream, but... Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo. Here I am. Here I am. - I'm packed. I'm packed. - Yeah, so I see. What for? You said I could come with you. Yeah, but... To buy ice cream, not to Hollywood. - We're going to Hollywood? - No. I mean, listen... When I... When I said... I mean, well, when you heard... Oh, brother. GONZO: Oh! Oh! What? Gonzo? - KERMIT: Gonzo! What are you doing? - MISS PIGGY: What? About seven knots. - We'll follow you. To the car. - Yes, sir. KERMIT: Gonzo, we're coming! - KERMIT: Step on it, Fozzie! - FOZZIE: Yes, sir. MISS PIGGY: Oh, Kermit. You're a born leader. KERMIT: Now, where is he? (SIGHS) Isn't this great? Here I am floating in space. This is the place to be. Whoopee! - Fozzie. - Yes. - Bear left. - What? - Bear left. - Right, Frog. - What? That's cute. - Never mind. This is... Look at our little car down there. Oh, this is like flying. Hey, this is flying. I'm flying! Whoopee! Doc, isn't that a frog up there? No, that's a frog down here. KERMIT: He's caught in a crosswind, Fozzie. We're gonna lose him. FOZZIE: Oh, no. - Oh, what are you doin', Doc? - I'm goin' after the tires. KERMIT: We're okay now. The wind's shifted. - Wait a minute. Stay with him, Fozzie. - FOZZIE: Yeah. - He's right above us. - GONZO: Whoo-hoo! - He's okay. - Yeah. Hi, Gonzo. - Fozzie, come back in here. - What? - Come back in here. - Yes, sir. Oh! KERMIT: Why don't you stay on the road? Kermit! KERMIT: Look out for the billboard. MAX: No! - Take off, Fozzie. - Yes, sir. Come back, you! No frog's gonna make a monkey out of me! I'm back. I don't understand any of this. I just gotta catch up with those guys. MISS PIGGY: Kermit, you were so courageous. So magnificent. - Gee, I don't know what to say. - Say the bear was magnificent. After all, I did the driving. And I took a 100-foot belly flop onto a moving car. Yes, but Kermit assumed the awesome responsibility of command. - Gee. - Oh, brother. Um... Why don't we stop somewhere for the night and have a quiet little dinner... For two? Terrific! I'll eat with you, Miss Piggy. Not you, buzzard beak. Just mon capitaine and moi. Well... That... That might be nice. Oh. Wow. Good evening, Miss Piggy. You look lovely tonight. Thank you. I'm so sorry if I kept you waiting. Oh, it... It was worth it. How charming of vous. I... I took the liberty of ordering us some wine. Mmm. Oh, waiter. Yes? May I help you? The... The wine, please. Mmm. You mad, impetuous thing. It's champagne. Not exactly. Sparkling muscatel. One of the finest wines of Idaho. Well, you may serve us now, please. Oh, may I? - Look how he does that. - Yep. - Very suave. - Mmm. Don't you want to smell the bottle cap? Oh. - Mmm-hmm. Smells good. - Mmm. Yes. - Would you like to taste it first? - Well... I think he's supposed to. Would you taste it for us, please? Ugh! - Excellent choice. - Should be for 95 cents. Hmm. - And may we have straws, please? - Yes. I expected that. Thank you. That'll be all for now. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. - Here's to you, Miss Piggy. - Oh. Drink up. Oh. Makes me giggly. The wine? Everything. It's a beautiful evening, isn't it? Mmm-hmm. The moon is just lovely. Mmm-hmm. You know, Miss Piggy, the moon doesn't look like you. - WAITER: Miss Piggy. - Hmm. Miss Piggy. - Are you Miss Piggy? - Yes. - Telephone. - Oh. Uh... Oh... Kermie, I did place one phone call to my agent. It'll only be an eensy-teensy moment. What the hey? Evenin'. Rowlf, Rowlf the Dog. Sit yourself down. - Kermit, Kermit the Frog. - Pleased to meet you. I'm no Heifetz, but I get by. That was... That was very nice. - (SNIFFS) - Oh. A broken heart, right? - Does it show? - Listen. When you've been ticklin' the ivories as long as I have, you've seen a broken heart for every drop of rain, a shattered dream for every fallen star. Exactly. She just walked out on me. Yeah? Typical. That's why I live alone. - You do, huh? - You bet. I finish work, I go home, read a book, have a couple of beers, take myself for a walk and go to bed. Nice and simple. Stay away from women, that's my motto. - But I can't. - Neither can I. That's my trouble. (SINGING) You can't live with 'em You can't live without 'em There's somethin' irresistible-ish about 'em We grin and bear it 'cause the nights are long I hope that somethin' better comes along I see what you mean. It's no good complainin' And pointless to holler If she's a beauty She'll get under your collar She made a monkey out of old King Kong I hope that somethin' better comes along Still, it's fun when they're fetchin' And agree to see an etching that you keep at your lily pad There is no solution It's part of evolution The pitter-patter of souls The little feet of tadpoles Rowlf, tadpoles don't have feet. Oh, sorry about that. Two, three, four. There's no limitation to mixin' and matchin' Some get an itchin' for a critter they've been scratchin' A skunk was badgered The results were strong I hope that somethin' better I hope that somethin' better comes along WAITER: Phone call for Kermit the Frog. - Are you Kermit the Frog? - Yeah. Phone. Huh. It's not often you see a guy that green have the blues that bad. - Hello. - Kermie, please... - Piggy, is that you? - HOPPER: Yes, that's her. And this is Doc Hopper. You listen, Frog. And listen good. Step outside the motel right now. My guys will meet you there. Well... What if I don't? Then your girlfriend will be ham-hocked by breakfast. Kermie. Don't, don't, don't, don't. Uh, uh... Are you the guys I'm supposed to meet? That's good, Glen. That's good. That's nice and tight. - The Professor's here, Doc. - Show him in. Show him in. Kermie, I'm not a bit worried. I know you're planning something bold and clever. Well, I got us this far, didn't I? - How are you? - Ah, Professor Krassman. It's good to see you, Doc, you little rustic devil, you. Where's my victim? I mean, patient? Step this way, Professor. Let me introduce you to your patient. Professor Krassman is the world's leadin' authority on mind control in frogs. It's a very rapidly growing field. You like garlic, don't you? Tell us what you're gonna do to our little Kermit. Well, we're going to perform an electronic cerebrectomy. - Hmm? - A what? - (GASPS) - Electronic cerebrectomy. What's that? It's something so sensational that you'll have to hold on to your hat. Yes? When a German scientist says, ""Hold on to your hat,"" it's not casual conversation. Hold on to your hat! Hat! Hold! Good. Now, what we're going to do is bring out a machine that's going to wow you. Bertram! Bertram, you... Bring out the machine! Wait till you see this. You think we're sleeping in Dsseldorf? You think we're taking a nap in Cologne? No, we're working at night. Each night a new dial, a new knob... Electronic... Cerebrectomy, cerebrectomy. Electronic cerebrectomy. - What does it do? - What does it do? What does it do? It turns the brains into guacamole. First of all, I'll pull out of this, okay? Wonderful. Second? Halt! Argh! I detest the surfeit of provincial laughter. Now, we take your friend, the little F-O-R-G, put him in the chair, clamp on the terminals, drop the electronic yarmulke, and throw, what we call in German, the switch. Yes, you little green devil. Soon it'll be a hot time for the old skull tonight. Thank you, Herr Machine. Now, the frog will do your bidding. He will do your every whim, your every wish. He will do your television commercial, yes. He will sell your frogs' legs. - Zaparoonie. - Head full of jelly. - A noggin full of library paste. - Let's fry them brains! Professor Krassman, you've got a fun job. I love it, I love it. If I can inflict a little pain during the afternoon, I sleep good at night. - Well, we'll let you get on with it, then. - My pleasure. Max. I'll be back later to pick up what's left of the frog. What's left of the frog? You can have everything, excuse the brain. All right. Bring over the frog. Oh, Kermie. Whatever happens next, I wouldn't give up this evening together for anything. - Would you? - Make me an offer. Oh, Kermie. - Hey. - Okay. I got him. I got him. Good, good, good, good, good. And why don't we take a little seat, Kermit? Hands down. - Get the feet into place. - (WHIMPERING) Will you stop whimpering? Go out like a frog, not a little toad. Okay, Herr Machine. This is big time here. Ready to go to work? Hand clamps! Foot clamps! You can struggle all you want now, frog. It'll do you very little good. All right. And now it's time to drop the electronic beanie. Soon, there'll be enough voltage coursing through your little frog brain to light up Cincinnati. Oh, please, please. Not my frog. Please! - Say goodbye to the frog, pig. - Why should I? Because in 10 seconds, he won't know you from kosher bacon. That does it! Hi-yah! Hi! Hi! Hi-yah! Hii-yah! Hii-yah! Hi! Hi! Hii-yah! Hi-yah! What the heck's goin' on here? A pig that goes bananas? What is this? A luau? - MAN: Where'd she go? - MISS PIGGY: Oh, boys. - There she is. - Get her! I must reach the switch. I must... - Switch. I must reach... - Oh, no. Hi-yah! - Now, Kermie. - Oh, thank you. Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit. Well... Shall we go now, Kermie? Well... Just a second. Hello. - Piggy, it's your agent. - Ooh. Thank you. Yeah, Morty, what have you got? Commercial? How much? Mmm-hmm. When? Take it. (NORMAL VOICE) Um. Goodbye. - FOZZIE: What's going on? - Hey, what happened? Irritated! Don't worry, Animal. Your big scene is coming up. Yeah, yeah. Just be cool and eat another seat cushion. Seat cushion! Well, how do you like the film? I've seen detergents that leave a better film than this. Well, I don't care what anybody else says. I'm having a great time. Oh, good. Der flim is okey-dokey. - Good. Roll film. - Flim is rolling. - GONZO: Quiet. - FOZZIE: Quiet. FOZZIE: Quiet, Gonzo. - This is the patriotic part. - Should we stand up? No. FOZZIE: O beautiful for spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountain majesties Above the fruited plains America, America God shed his grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea Patriotism swells in the heart of the American bear. Hold it, boys. Hold it! Hold your fire! Boys, no reflection on the job you've been doin', but I decided to bring in a specialist. Now, boys, this is Snake Walker. Tell 'em what you do, Snake. Kill frogs. FOZZIE: How long is it to Hollywood? KERMIT: We gotta be there by tomorrow. GONZO: Hey, Kermit. Are you gonna get an agent like that pig had? FOZZIE: Gonzo, you know he's touchy about that. - ROWLF: Hey, who's that? - KERMIT: I don't believe that. - KERMIT: Piggy? - FOZZIE: Kermit. Kermit. - That's Piggy. - Yeah, I know. ROWLF: Hey, do you think we should help her with her bag? - ALL: No. - Kermie. Kermie, what an unbelievable coincidence. FOZZIE: Hmm. Hello again. It's me. Would you hold my vanity case? Hi-yah! - Well. - Well, what? So much has happened to me since I saw you last. - Yeah, sure. - Frankly, Miss Piggy, I don't give a hoot. My name is Rowlf the Dog and I was playing the piano... Oh, never mind. - Kermie. - Yeah? - I missed you. - Yeah. Don't I get one kissy-kissy? Uh, no, I... I don't think so, Miss Piggy. Just one little hug. FOZZIE: Hmmm. - Oh, Piggy. - Kermie. HOPPER: (ON RADIO) You've been listenin' to music to hug frogs by. And this is Doc Hopper sayin' that if Kermit the Frog don't stop right now and call me, and agree to be my national spokesman, he will soon be a frog burger. Kermie. Ah! We'll be okay. Mon capitaine. - FOZZIE: Oh, boy. Yeah, what? - KERMIT: Fozzie? FOZZIE: No problem. It's okay, it's okay. No problem. Okay, all right. - Listen... - KERMIT: Oh, boy. FOZZIE: Oh, we're in trouble. I wish I still had my Studebaker. ROWLF: Probably somethin' broken about the engine, I think. GONZO: Hey, don't worry. Someone's bound to come along. Well, I guess we blew it, huh, Gonzo? Yeah. But the sky sure is beautiful out here. Look at that. We... We're gonna miss the auditions tomorrow, right? Kermit? GONZO: Boy, you could get lost in a sky like that. I wish I had those balloons again. So much for Hollywood. Listen, gang. I never promised we'd make it. I never promised anything. (SINGING) This looks familiar Vaguely familiar Almost unreal, yet It's too soon to feel yet Close to my soul And yet so far away I'm going to go back there someday Sun rises, night falls Sometimes the sky calls Is that a song there? And do I belong there? I've never been there But I know the way I'm going to go back there someday Come and go with me It's more fun to share We'll both be completely At home in midair We're flyin', not walking On featherless wings We can hold on to love Like invisible strings There's not a word yet For old friends who've just met Part heaven, part space Or have I found my place? You can just visit But I plan to stay I'm going to go back there Someday I'm going to go back there Someday I didn't promise anybody anything. What do I know about Hollywood anyway? Just the dreams I got from sitting through too many double features. KERMIT'S VOICE: So, why did you leave the swamp in the first place? 'Cause some agent fella said I had talent. He probably says that to everybody. On the other hand, if you hadn't left the swamp, you'd be feeling pretty miserable anyhow. Yeah, but then it would just be me feeling miserable. Now I got a lady pig and a bear, and a chicken, a dog, a thing, whatever Gonzo is. He's a little like a turkey. Yeah. A little like a turkey, but not much. No, I guess not. Anyhow, I brought 'em all out here into the middle of nowhere. It's all my fault. Still, whether you promised them something or not, you gotta remember they wanted to come. But that's because they believed in me. No, they believed in the dream. - Well, so do I, but... - You do? Yeah. Of course I do. - Well, then? - Well, then... I guess I was wrong when I said I never promised anyone. I promised me. Hey. Now, wait a minute. Hey, what... What's happening? At the moment, we're what's happening. Oh, great. Wonderful. Yeah. Zoot, hey, Zoot. Hold it, hold it. Animal, cool it back there. Yeah. All right, yeah. Hey, listen, it's wonderful to see you guys, but how did you ever find us? Oh, easy. We just read the screenplay you left us. ""Exterior. Desert. Night."" We knew right where you were. Like, can you get behind it? Hey, listen. When do you dudes have to be at that audition? 2:00 tomorrow afternoon. Well, climb aboard the bus. We'll have breakfast at Hollywood and Vine. ALL: Movin' right along FLOYD: Oh, yeah. TEETH: Here we go. Movin' right along Kermie, whisper sweet nothings into my ear. Motorcycle cop. Motorcycle cop is a sweet nothing? A motorcycle cop is chasing us. - Hey, Dr. Teeth, you better pull over. - Hey, easier done than said. FLOYD: Uh-oh. JANICE: Drag city. What do we do now, huh? Oh, dear. TEETH: Hey, hey. The man with the badge. The police, the cops, the fuzz, the P.I... - Don't you dare! - I wouldn't think of it. Did we do something wrong, Officer? - Kermit, it's him. - Okay, gang. Let him explain. This whole disguise is only so I could warn you. Oh, yeah. Sure, sure. I never thought that Doc was gonna hurt Kermit. I only thought he was gonna lean on him a little. But now he's got this frog killer in from the coast, and the man is deadly. FOZZIE: Oh, no, Kermit. What are we gonna do? - It's time to beat feet, green stuff. - FOZZIE: Let's get out of here, Kermit. I love it. Chase music is one of our best riffs. Hold it, Dr. Teeth. What's up ahead? - It's only an old ghost town. - Fine. Listen, you go back and tell Doc Hopper I'll be waiting for him there. - What? - What? - Kermit, you'll get killed. - Oh, please, no. - FOZZIE: Kermit, you can't do that. - Now, listen, guys. Listen, I can't spend my whole life running away from a bully. It's time for a showdown. Showdown! Showdown! Uh, hey, listen, I'm gonna check things out. - Everybody stay in the bus, okay? - Mmm-hmm. Hey, Kermit. Can I take Animal for a walk? He needs some exercise. Yeah, yeah, sure. What is that? That's one of my latest inventions. A musical rotating rain barrel. Oh, oh, yeah. You see, I'm Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and this is my assistant, Beaker. We live here perfecting useful inventions. - Come in, come in. - (MEEPING) BUNSEN: Welcome to our laboratory. Please don't touch anything. Uh... - Is this the only street into town? - Yes, yes. Hey, what are you dudes doin' in here? I'm so glad you asked. We're perfecting our latest invention. Insta-Grow pills. Yeah, well, what in the name of Fats Waller is that? A 4-foot prune. A 4-foot prune? Yeah, man, well, what else do these pills make big? Oh, they work on anything, but the effect is sadly temporary. Sadly temporary. (SIGHS) Oh, no! SCOOTER: Hey, Kermit. Here comes Doc Hopper. I know. I'll be ready for him. Okay, Frog. Where are you? KERMIT: I'm here. I'll meet you in the middle of the street. Oh, yeah? KERMIT: Man to frog. - KERMIT: All right, Hopper. - All right, Frog. One last chance. You gonna do my TV commercials live or stuffed? Hopper, what's the matter with you? You gotta be crazy, chasin' me halfway across the country. Why are you doing this to me? 'Cause all my life, I wanted to own a thousand frog leg restaurants, and you're the key, greenie. Yeah, well, I've got a dream, too. But it's about singing and dancing and making people happy. That's the kind of dream that gets better the more people you share it with. And, well, I've found a whole bunch of friends who have the same dream. And... And it kind of makes us like a family. Do you have anybody like that, Hopper? I mean, once you get all those restaurants, who are you gonna share it with? Who are your friends, Doc? Those guys? Max. I got lots of friends. Max, for instance. - Max. - I don't think you're a bad man, Doc. And I think if you look in your heart, you'll find you really wanna let me and my friends go to follow our dreams. But if that's not the kind of man you are, or what I'm saying doesn't make any sense to you, well, then, go ahead and kill me. All right, boys. Kill him. No, wait, please. Animal! Ha! Ha, ha, ha! Everybody, on to Hollywood. ALL: Yay! GONZ0: Wow! Wicked! TEETH: Yeah, next stop is Hollywood and Vine. FOZZIE: Look at the ocean. The ocean. Yes, Mr. Lord. I'll have those deal numbers for you in a jiffy. - (PHONE RINGS) - Mmm-hmm. Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone. He's packaging a blockbuster. Mmm-hmm. - Ah, Kermie, look, it's wonderful. - Yeah. Like a dream come true. Well, don't count your tadpoles until they're hatched. - I still have to audition, you know. - Hey, there ain't nothin' to it, but to do it. And where do you think you're going? Oh, hi, there. I'm going to audition for Lew Lord. You can't just walk in here off the street, you know. Especially not with all these animals. Animals? What's wrong with animals? ANIMAL: Animal! This is a movie studio, not a zoo! Besides... I'm allergic to animal hair. Now, get along, all of you. No. Wait a second. See here, miss. I may not be one of your fancy Hollywood frogs, but I deserve a chance. And we're gonna stay right here in this office until you let us in to see Lew Lord. - Aren't we, gang, huh? - Yes! - FLOYD: What he says. - GONZO: Yeah, come on.

That's part of what rainbows do Rainbows are memories Sweet dream reminders What is it you'd like to do? All of us watching and wishing we'd find it I've noticed you're watching, too Someday you'll find it The rainbow connection The lovers, the dreamers and... Whoo-hoo-hoo! Kermit. (SINGING) Life's like a movie Write your own ending Keep believing, keep pretending We've done just what we've set out to do Thanks to the lovers The dreamers And you I just knew I'd catch up with you guys. - What did you think? - It was sick and weird. Kermit, it went swell. It went great, boss. Congratulations, Mr. The Frog. You can be in the next one, Lew. Great show. Oh, wow. Woman! - Did you like my close-up? - Oh, yes. Did you like my song? How about my karate? Kermit. Oh, Kermie. Was I funny? Was I funny, anybody? Fozzie, you were very, very funny. Just great. Go home! Go home!, - If you had a choice... - Yeah? Would you rather love a girl, or have her love you? I'd want it mutual. If you couldn't have it mutual. Would I rather be the one who loves, or is loved? Yeah. It's not that easy a question. I think I'd rather be in love. Me, too. I wouldn't want to get hurt, though. You were in love with Gloria. I was starting to be in love with her, then she let me feel her up on the first date. Turned me right off. You kept going with her, though. Well, she let me feel her up. Yeah, what about Gwen? Her I could talk to. I've never been able to talk to any girl. I was really getting crazy about her. She's stuck up. Wouldn't let me lay a hand on her. So I went back to Gloria. Well, you want perfection. What do you want, wise guy? She just has to be nice, that's all. You wouldn't want her beautiful? She doesn't have to be beautiful. I would like her built, though. I want mine sexy-looking. I wouldn't want her to look like a tramp. Sexy doesn't mean she has to look like a tramp. There's a middle ground, you know? I would want that, yeah. Tall, very tall... Eww, that would scare me. She should be very understanding. Start the same sentences together. Yeah, I'd like that. Big tits... Yeah, but still a virgin. I don't care about that. Come on. I wouldn't mind if she was a little ahead of me, with those big tits, and knew hundreds of different ways. I want more of a companion. The other stuff I can get on the outside. The first time I do it, I want it beautiful. I don't want to waste it on some beast. I feel the same way about getting laid as I feel about going to college. I'm being pressured into it. - You like that? - Yeah. - I give her to you. - What's wrong with her? - I'm a generous guy. - Yeah, I'm grateful. How do I break the news to her? - You go over there. - Yeah? There's a way to talk to girls, you know? Tell her a joke. What joke? Tell her about your unhappy childhood. - That's not bad. - But don't make it like an act. No. Go ahead. Go ahead, schmuck. If you don't, I will. You? You can't even stand up. I fucked up. It's my turn. What do you mean, it's your turn? She's mine, you gave her to me. You struck out. I get two more times at bat. This is the first time I've ever been to a college mixer. - Me too. I hate them. - I hate them too. It's such a phony way of meeting people. Everybody puts on an act. So, even if you meet somebody, you don't know who you're meeting. Because you're meeting the act. That's right, not the person. I'm not sure I agree. - With what? - With what you said. No, I don't either. You don't agree with what you said? How do you feel about it? I think people only like to think they're putting on an act, but it's not an act, it's really them. If they think it's an act, they feel better, because they think they can always change it. You mean, they're kidding themselves, because it's not really an act. Yes, it is an act, but they're the act. The act is them. But if it's them, then how can it be an act? - Because they're an act. - But they're also real. - No. - I'm not real? - No. - I'm an act. It's all right, I'm an act too. Don't you behave differently with different people? No. With your family? I thought you meant different people. Well, sure, with my family... And with friends, you're another way. Well, sure, with my friends. And with your teachers, you're still another way. So which one is you? Well, when you put it that way... You ought to be a lawyer. I'm gonna be a lawyer. A lady lawyer. You're from Smith, right? Huh. Do you like it? Yeah, I like it all right. Do you like Amherst? Sure, why shouldn't I? My parents worked very hard to send me. I'd better like it. Do you have a name or something? Susan. I'm Sandy. I think you can make out with her. Think so? She's stuff. You think so? I wouldn't kick her out of bed. I shouldn't try somebody else, then? Who? She was the best-looking girl at the whole mixer. I'll say that for her... Wasn't she? Her tits were too small. Yeah, I was thinking that. The hell with her. But her legs were great. You think so? Standing so close, I really couldn't tell about her legs. I wouldn't kick her out of bed. She's got some funny ideas. I wouldn't kick her out of bed. Don't rush me, please. What's the matter? I like you very much, Susan. It's our third date. I like you too. You let me kiss you last week. And this week. If I could kiss you once last week, I should be able to kiss you at least twice tonight. - Well? - You're the only boy I know that I can talk to. I can't see you being quiet for any guy. No, not quiet, exactly. But if you know somebody's not going to approve of what you are... - Whatever that is. - Whatever that is. Well, you just don't tell him. I mean, if I like a boy and I want him to keep liking me, and I'm brighter than he is, I have to not show it or I'll lose him, so it's hard. Well, I wouldn't want anyone overly bright. Yeah, but you wouldn't feel threatened. I might be bothered a little. I don't think you would nearly as much as some people. Now, for instance, someday I want to write novels. Not now, but you know, later on, when I have something to say. Now, that doesn't threaten you, does it? No... Maybe a little. Don't press so hard. See, it's better when it's gentle. See? What are you grinning at? Did you feel her up yet? Come on, I like this girl. I don't want to ruin things. Was I right about kissing her? Listen, we had a big fight over it. And you won? Well, I don't know if I won or not. Why are you letting yourself be pushed around? You're the one who's pushing me around. I guess I won. Sure, I won. She kissed me five times. Now, that's when you should've put your hand on her tit. Come on, when this girl's nice enough to kiss me, I should do that to her? You act as if she's doing you a favour. Well, it is sort of a favour, isn't it? I mean, when a girl lets you kiss her and, you know, go on from there. Feel her up and, you know, the rest of it. Go all the way and the rest of it. I mean, isn't it a favour? What's in it for her? I mean, if she's not getting paid or anything. Fuck you. Okay, okay, I'll feel her up. Sandy, please take your hand off my breast. - Why? - Because I want you to. How can it be any fun for you if you know I don't want it? I didn't say it was fun. Then why is your hand where it is? Because, the way we're going, by this time, I should be feeling you up. I don't feel that way about you, Sandy. I feel that way about you. Well, you want me to feel something for you too, don't you? I thought you liked me. I do like you, but I like you for other reasons. So... So... if we went any further, there wouldn't be those reasons anymore. Well, we might have something else, though. What? Something else. You're the first girl I've ever done that to, Susan. I didn't know that. It doesn't show? No. Well, it's something we both have to go through, I guess. Susan, are you a virgin? What do I do with my other hand? What are you gonna do with your hands? And then what? She told me to take my hand off her breast. - What did you do? - I said I didn't want to. Then what? She said how could it be fun for me if she didn't like it? Oh, Jesus. - I said I thought she liked me. - Yeah? She said, ""I like you for other reasons."" Other reasons? So, I told her how I really needed this. What did you tell her? You know, that it was my first time. Your first time what? What did you say exactly? I don't remember exactly. That she was the first girl I ever tried to feel up. - You told her that? - Was it a mistake? I wouldn't. Then she got nicer to me. What do you mean nicer? She put my hand on her breast. You mean you put it on, she left it there. No, she picked it up and put it on. She took your hand like this? And put it on like this? That's right. So, I didn't know what to think. You didn't, huh? For just wanting to be friends, she's suddenly getting pretty aggressive. Yeah, then what? I asked her if she was a virgin. - You're kidding. - Was that a mistake? Anyhow, she is. She says. So now you got, what, one hand or two hands on her tits? By this time, she's put the other hand on the other one. She put both hands on? Two hands? So I said, ""What are you gonna do with your hands?"" You didn't say that. It just came out. Yeah, then what? Let me see if I got this. She unzipped my fly. Bullshit artist. Then what? Then what? Then she did it. Did what? Bullshit artist. She really did that to you? - She did that? - Yeah. Hello, is this Susan? Well, you don't know me. I'm a friend of Sandy's. His room-mate. Yeah, Jonathan. He told you about me? Yeah, so, I'm just here at Smith for tonight, practically on campus. I was just taking a drive, you know, and I found myself practically on campus. How do you like Smith? What's your major? Where did you go to high school? What do you do in the summer? Do you always answer a question with a question? Do you always date your best friend's girlfriends? Sandy told me you were beautiful. He told me you were sexy. I guess he's just a poor judge. I guess he meant you had personality. Good grief. You have a special quality. I like girls who are special. I'm hardly that special. Some people you can tell about right away. Most girls I talk to it's like we're spies from foreign countries and we're speaking in code. Everything means something else. Like, I say, ""Would you like to take a walk?"" And it means something else. And she says, ""I can't. I've got a French test tomorrow."" And it means something else. And you say, ""I'll come over and help you study."" And it means something else. You're very sharp, I like that. And that means something else. You're too sharp. Does that bother you? It interests me. Is that more code? We'd be good together. I'm dating your best friend. He won't mind. - How do you know? - I won't tell him. What if I mind? You want to go out Friday? I'm seeing Sandy. Saturday? I have a date. Sunday? I'm seeing my folks. Where do they live? Newton. Sunday night? I'll be too tired. I'll help you get over your folks. How about it, Susan? What are you so afraid of? Not you. I think I'm in love. I think I'm in love. Bullshit artist. I really think so. Did you get in yet? What's that got to do with it? How do you know if you don't know how you are in bed together? Well, that's not everything. It's a lot. She tells me thoughts I didn't even know I had until she tells them to me. It's unbelievable. I can talk to her. You can talk to me too. Are you in love with me? I can say things to her I wouldn't dare say to you. What, for instance? Things you'd laugh at. I'm laughing now. She thinks I'm sensitive. Sensitive? Sensitive? Oh, boy. Whoa-ho. What do you talk to her about, flowers? Books. Books? You phony, I read more books than you do. Yeah, well, I'm gonna start. I'm reading ""The Fountainhead."" ""The Fountainhead."" What's that? It's her favourite book. You ever hear of ""Jean-Christophe""? What's that? It's a classic, you moron. Gonna read it after ""The Fountainhead."" Yeah, you ever read ""Guadalcanal Diary"" - by Richard Tregaskis? - No. That was a best seller and I read it. Ever read ""Gentleman's Agreement"" by Laura Z. Hobson? You ever read ""A Bell For Adano"" by John Hersey? I'm gonna read everything from now on. I read more than you do. So who's the one who's sensitive? You or me? Come on, who's sensitive? I've had a very messed-up childhood. What does your father do? He fails. It's not funny. I'm sorry. Were you very poor? My father couldn't hold on to a job. He kept giving me advice. The more he failed, the more advice I got. He's a Communist, my father. We're Republicans. Sometimes I think I'm a Communist, though. Me, too. We have so much, and other people have, you know, so little. After I get set up as a lawyer, what I'd really like to do is go into politics, public service. What really gets me is I was too young to fight in the war, because what was that all about except to prove that if everybody pitches in, the plain people have a chance. So, even though I'm the first in my family to get an education, I don't ever want to forget where I came from. You're a lot more serious than I thought. I know. Where did you meet her? I'm another person with her. You wouldn't recognise me. The things that come out of my mouth. Boy, she really sounds like something. Is she built? She's, she's got a quality. She doesn't talk much, but the things she says are so sharp. We should double-date sometime. Well... I want to know her a little better, you know, before we double-date. Gee, isn't it great? A month ago, neither of us even knew a girl. What's her name? Myrtle. Bullshit artist. You're kidding. You're not kidding me? You really did it. You bastard. You beat me to it. What's up? Next is my turn. I don't think she'll do it, Sandy. She will. I've just been taking it easy on her. Sandy, believe me, find somebody else. Are you crazy, when I'm right on the verge? I'll see her tomorrow night. Sandy? Yeah. Do you ever talk to her about me? Yeah, sure, sometimes. Do me a favour, will you? What? Don't tell her I got laid. Please, Susan. Sometimes I want to do it, and a second later, I don't want to do it. Let's do it. I don't know why you put up with me. I don't think I can do it. It really hurts, Susan. Let me... Not anymore. Please, Sandy. Not anymore. Susan, let's do it. I love you. Do you have anything? How long have you had that? Not too long. Not a year or anything? I'm sure it's okay. I don't wanna take any chances. These things have to be okay. It's okay. I'm positive it's okay. It's as if you're the first guy in history who ever got laid. I'm the first guy in my history who ever got laid. I like it too, but you don't hear me crowing about it. There's such a thing as good taste, you know? - What's the matter with you? - Jeez. After you started scoring, what did I get out of you? ""We did it standing, sitting, in the car, under the car. Myrtle, Myrtle, Myrtle..."" Maybe you forget, but I knew Susan before you knew Myrtle, and who scored first? You. That didn't make me feel very good, you know? In fact, it made me feel very jealous. But did I try to shut you up? Did I say, ""I'm tired of hearing about it already""? I didn't say it, because I'm your friend, so I sat through it. Okay, okay. You made your point. Sometimes I think I'm a better friend to you than you are to me. Didn't you ever do that? Of course, I... I knew what the word ""misled"" meant. I just didn't know... So, when I first saw it in print, I thought it was ""myzeled"". He had been ""myzeled."" I kept wondering, what does this word mean? ""Myzeled""? Sexy. Let's ""myzle."" Has anybody ever heard of ""Round John Virgin""? One of the guys in ""Robin Hood."" That's Little John. What did you say? Round John...? Round John Virgin. Is that in Falstaff? ""Round John Virgin mother and child."" Round John Virgin mother...?  Holy infant so tender and mild  All right, gunshee. Gunshee? G-u-n-s-h-y, gunshee. Gun-shy... I always thought it was gunshee. Susan, do the one about the bear. You'll love this, John. Oh, yeah, the hymn we used to sing in church about the bear with crossed eyes? Whose name was Gladly. Gladly the bear? Don't you know it? Gladly the cross-eyed bear. Gladly the cross-eyed bear, get it? Gladly the cross... oh, Gladly the cross-eyed bear. All right, pronounce this: c-h-o-p-h-o-u-s-e. Chophuse... Chophus...? Chophouse. This has to stop. I don't know how to tell him. You don't have any trouble telling him a lot of other things. - What does that mean? - The way you talk to him. I don't ever hear you talking to me that way. What way? I don't know. He's very vulnerable. I don't want to hurt him. You're hurting me. He loves me. That's no reason to go to bed with him. You would have just gone on, wouldn't you, if he hadn't told me? I don't know. I would have never known a thing about it. I don't know, maybe. Boy, you're really something. I don't feel like something. I feel like nothing. How much longer do you expect me to take this? I'm trying to tell him. I see how you're trying. It's not my fault. I don't enjoy these fights. Listen, it's me you're supposed to be in love with. - I'm gonna tell him. - What? I'm gonna tell him about you and me. No, Jonathan. Why don't you give me some of the understanding that you give to him? You're stronger. You tell him everything else. You can tell him about us. What do you mean, I tell him everything? Who says so? He tells me, he's my best friend. Are you going to tell him? He's so helpless. Susan, I love you. Why can't you be more with me like you are with Sandy? She says she's no good for me. Maybe she's trying to let you down easy. Go ahead and laugh. It adds up. Go ahead and laugh. You know every mood of mine like you know every mood of his. - No. - How come? I don't know. You don't tell me thoughts I never knew I had. - Does he say I do that? - Yes. Then I guess I must. You do it all right, so do it with me. I can't. You can do it with him, you can do it with me. Now tell me my thoughts. - I can't. - Why can't you? I can't with you. This has gone far enough. I cannot stand any more ultimatums. This is my last one. Now, tonight, you tell him about us, or tomorrow, I tell him. Look at me, Susan. Now tell me my goddamn thoughts. Hello. You didn't do it, did you? No. Why not? He looks at me with such trust. How do I look at you? With bitterness. It used to be trust. At least you know my thoughts. Did you tell him? What do you think? No. So, what do we do now? I don't know. I guess I get an ultimatum. Do you think there's any sense in this? In what? In you and me. That's up to you. No, it's up to you. I don't see any point in it. I wish I were wrong. I don't feel anything anymore. Neither do I. The reason I didn't say anything to Sandy... I knew he wouldn't believe me. And I'd go into details so he would have to believe me. And I knew he'd come running to you, and I knew you'd tell him everything I said was true, and I knew then you'd go to bed with him. Yeah, that sounds like what would happen. So? So? Jonathan... I'll always be your friend. Jesus, Susan, I hope not. It's going to be buggy. It's not going to be buggy. It's the tropics. What do you mean? It's the jungle. You can't cover yourself from head to toe. I'll get eaten alive. You don't know what it's like. You've never camped out before. Isn't he being silly, Jonathan? - I am not. - Are too. - Am not. - Are too. You're a real city boy. How about the cot? Come on, sweetie, we've got a sleeping bag. You're really serious about sleeping on the ground? You are a baby. Christ, this knapsack's heavy. Well, I told you you overpacked. What in the world do you plan to do with a pillowcase? Put it back. Well, you are a nut. Isn't he a nut, Jonathan? You pack your things. Let me pack mine. I'm just trying to help. Well, help your own stuff. You have packing to do. We don't even have room. We're going in a little car. Jesus... You want her? I wouldn't kick her out of bed. Will you look at the pair on her? Get a look at that schmuck trying to keep up with her. They're always with guys like that. That guy must be 60 if he's a day. Maybe he'll have a heart attack. You could save his life. Get her number and fuck her. You bastard... Bastard... How's Susan? Couldn't be better. I always said it, and I say it now. You found yourself a jewel. She is a jewel. Not bad, that one. Listen, you must be getting more than your share. I'd get married in a minute if I could find the right girl. Bullshit artist. You and your actress friends. Are you kidding, Doctor? You're the one that's got the deal. I mean, what can I say? ""Take your clothes off, baby, I wanna check your capital gains."" I just look. Sure, you do. I really do. Susan's plenty enough woman for one man. Hey, look at that. That's Sally Joyce. Didn't I see her on Ed Sullivan? I fucked her once. Bullshit artist. We used to do her taxes. She's with another firm now. Why don't you say hello? She wouldn't remember me. She's a real ball-buster, that one. I've been through the mill with her kind. Yeah? You think a girl goes for you, and you find out she's after your money or your balls... or your money and your balls. Women today are better hung than the men. I should have your problems. It's not as easy getting laid as it used to be. I don't think I fuck more than a dozen new girls a year now. Maybe I'm too much of a perfectionist. This last one came so close to being what I wanted. Good pair of tits on her... Not a great pair. Almost no ass at all, and that bothered me. Sensational legs. I would have settled for the legs, if she had just two more inches here and three more here. Anyhow... that took two years out of my life. You don't want a family? I don't want to put it down, but who needs it? You can't make fucking your life's work. Don't tell me what I can and can't do. You're so well-off? Susan's a very good homemaker. Very efficient. I come home, everything is in its place... which I like, because it's tiring putting in a full day at the office, then Doctors' Hospital for a couple of hours. So it's nice to have everything in its place when I get home. A Martini, dinner, the kids. We don't watch much television. We like to read aloud to each other. We used to have more friends than we do, but we don't have that many anymore. So, on weekends we might entertain a little or go over to see a friend. Come into town, see a play or a good film. It's not glamorous or anything. There are other things besides glamour. You have a long lifeline. I like that. The way you run your nail across my... You're difficult to get along with. Me? Bobbie... You always know your own mind. Right this minute, anyway. You won't stop going after what you want until you get it. Let me see your hand. Well? You are built. You see that in my hand? Even your hand is built. I think you're a dirty old man. I'm a dirty young man. How old are you? How old do you think I am? No... No. No. You skipped 23. No. No. No. You're getting warm. No. I like going out with older women. Are you married? Are you kidding? You don't want to get married? I'd marry you in a minute. Can you cook? Spaghetti. I can cook spaghetti. Good, you do the cooking. What will you do? What would you like me to do? What would you like to do? I asked you first. Well, I'm not gonna answer you first. Well... I can sew. Doesn't sound like much of a marriage. Me cooking spaghetti, and you sewing. You want a divorce? I'll take you for every cent you got. I didn't know I was marrying a gold digger. You won't take pity on me? Only if you say you're sorry. I'm sorry. And you'll never do it again. I'll never do it again. And you'll always be a good boy. Yes, Mama. You like to be mothered? I'd like to be smothered by you. What else would you like me to do to you? Well... How do you like it? How do I like what? My, you know. What do I know? You know everything. I know you. And I know you.  Dream   When you're feeling blue   Dream   That's the thing to do   Just   Watch the smoke rings   Rise in the air   You'll find your share   Of memories there   So   Dream   When the day is through  Wow... I almost came that time. Help. Oh, nurse? What is it, Mr. Weisenborn? Will you come in here a minute, please? Certainly, Mr. Weisenborn. Why, Mr. Weisenborn. Most guys I know are pricks. I don't know anymore what they want. I'll be happy to tell you. They want... the boodle. But they ain't gonna get the boodle. Goddamn right. Because this kid here has got the boodle. You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? You're a nice man. And you're a very lucky girl. You know something, Sam? What is it, sweetheart? You think it would be a fatal mistake in our lives if we shacked up? It's very difficult, Bobbie. These last couple of weeks, we get along so well together. The idea... I like you very much. So much... this idea... to be perfectly honest, I mean, it sounds very good to me. Let's both give it a couple of days to think about it. It sounds, like... well, very good. Very, very... well... good. Only, our eyes should be open. If we should go into this, we should know exactly what we're getting into. It's just a shack-up. I'm not asking for your hand in marriage. Yeah, well, as long as we both understand that. We do. I just thought it's better to get it all out on the table, so later, there can be no possibility of a misunderstanding. I don't know how many business deals I've seen come to grief... Okay... Okay. You're a real prick, you know that? Prick? I could very easily get serious about this girl. She's a lot of fun to be with. This is just between the two of us, but for the last year or so, I've been having... I don't know, a little trouble. I wasn't worried, but still and all... a little trouble with... well, myself. You know... getting hard. It took a long time, and you know how girls are today, they judge you. They judge you very quickly. So... I had a real rough time a couple of times. Some very nasty innuendos. And, as I say, I wasn't too worried, but... I won't lie to you, I was a little worried. Then along comes this Bobbie. I get one look at the size of the pair on her and I never had a doubt I'd ever be anything but okay again, and I was, I was. With all our kidding, back and forth on our first night together, I don't mind telling you I had tears in my eyes. She's really the girl in the airline commercial? You lucky son of a bitch. I don't know. I don't want to get in over my head. I got in over my head three, four times already, and you have to be a real bastard. I don't like being put in that position. What would you do? If she looks anything like she looks on television... Size 38, with a D cup. But looks aren't everything. Believe me, looks are everything. Maybe. I'm hungry. I'll get up. Why do we always have to eat so late? Because I work late, dumb-o. Why do you work at all? Brings in extra money. I make enough. You want me to quit working? I thought you were bored with it. I am. So quit. What'll I do? What do other women do? Have children. Well, you asked me. So until the day that one comes along   I'll sing my song with you  For every little fault that you have   Say I've got three or four  The human little faults you do have   Just make me love you more   You may not be an angel   But still I'm sure you'll do  So until the day that one comes along   I'll string along   With you  Hey, was that you? - Yeah, that was me. - No kidding. What about my beer? We're all out. I really wanted a beer. Do you want me to run out to the corner? You're too tired. I'm tired, but I don't mind. I'll get it. No, I'll get it. It's my fault. I knew I should have reminded you when I called this afternoon. I'm sorry, honey. You're more tired now than when you were working. I'm in the house all day. Did you get up at all today? What do you do? I mean, when you're not telephoning? I'm not on the phone that much. It took me 45 minutes to get through this afternoon. I'll go get the beer. No, I'll go. I thought you were too tired. I haven't been out all day. Fresh air will do you good. Will you walk with me? Then I may as well go myself.  To sing my love song too  And until the day that one comes along   I'll sing my song with you  For every little fault that you have  Wanna make love? We haven't in a week. Is it a week? It's funny. Susan and I do all the right things. We undress in front of each other. We spend 15 minutes on foreplay. We experiment, do it in different rooms. It's a seven-room house. We don't believe in making a ritual of it. We do it when we feel like it. We don't feel we have to be passionate all the time. Sometimes it's even more fun necking. We're considerate of each other's feelings. I had a tendency... Men, I guess, have... To be selfish. But I stopped. I don't do that now. We try to be patient, and we are patient, gentle with each other. Maybe it's just not meant to be enjoyable with women you love. Sandy... do you want to get laid? Please. Very nice. Very nice indeed. Indeed. Watch out. I almost had it. Sure, you almost had it. I almost had it. Right, Cindy? See that, Cindy? He was lucky. That's all. Bastard, that was out. - Bullshit it was. - Oh, bullshit. Let Cindy be the judge. We'll do it over, all right? All right. Fair's fair. Deuce. You see that shot, Cindy? Now we got some tennis. Hey. Game. Luck. Luck, my ass. Whoo-hoo. You want to take me on, Cindy? It's my turn. Oh, come on, Bobbie, you're so awful. You serve. Very nice. Hey, you play well. Hey, Sandy, will you look at this girl? Terrific, Cindy. Whoo. Hey. She's racking me up. I'm not kidding. Look at this. She's racking me up. Beautiful. Boy, will you look at this? 40-love. And I'm not taking it easy on her either. You and Lord & Taylor's are gonna have to work out a trial separation. I had the water running. What did you say? You and Lord & Taylor's are going to have to work out a trial separation. Look at the date. What do you mean? Five months ago. I'm sorry I cost you so much money. I want to get married. Are you tired of me, Jonathan? Am I ever. - The answer is yes. - I didn't say yes. You said, ""Am I ever."" I need more in life than this. Who put you up to this? Your psychiatrist? After a long, exhaustive bed hunt, you finally chose me. Cindy's not a virgin either. What? Oh, I get it. Is that what brought this on? Your mind is unbelievable. You have to have a low opinion of me thinking that I would do that to Sandy. Oh, no, you wouldn't want to cheat on Sandy. Oh, now it's Sandy. Well, he spends half his life over here. Wait a minute. A second ago you had me screwing Cindy. Who am I screwing now, Sandy? You're going too fast for me. I'm going too fast for you? Your little mind operates like an IBM, like a pinball machine. First Cindy. Oh, no, not Cindy? How about Sandy? How about Cindy and Sandy? Talk about the pot calling the kettle. The day I got an earful of your chequered past, I felt like a celibate. You made me tell you. Sure, I twisted your arm. It got you hot. Something has to. You have such contempt for me. Kid, you worked hard for it. It's yours. The way you paw me at parties. Now affection is contempt. Upside down. Everything upside down. Feeling me up in public is not affection. Will you come on? I know I sleep all day. I know I'm doing a terrible job, but you're not helping me any. And who helps me? I help you. Your kind of help I can do without. Can you? Can you really? You'll do anything you can to ruin my day, won't you? I got up today feeling so good. You couldn't leave us alone. - We were doing so well. - What? At one time... at one time, it was great what we had. The kidding around. It can't have a natural time span? Affairs can't dissolve in a good way. There's always got to be poison. I don't see why. I really don't see why. Jonathan, do you want it over between us? Why does it have to be one way or the other? You don't want me to leave? I want you right here where you belong. And what about you? When I'm here, I'm here. When I'm not here, I'm there. - Where? - Wherever? No. I'm a man-eater or a ball-buster and a castrator. I want to get married. All right, where the fuck is my shoehorn? This place is a mess. There's not any food in the house. Half the time, you look like you fell out of bed. You spend more time in bed than any other human being past the age of six months than I ever heard of. The reason I sleep all day is because I can't stand my life. What life? Sleeping all day. You say that sort of thing, I fall in love with you all over again. Marry me, Jonathan. Please, marry me. You're trying to kill me. Marriage isn't death. Why now? Because two years ago, I slept eight hours. A year ago, it was 12. It's up to 15 now. Pretty soon, it's gonna be 24. What are you trying to do, scare me? - I need a life. - Get a job. I don't want a job. I want you. I'm taken, by me. Get out of the house. Do something useful, God damn it. You wouldn't let me work when I wanted to. That was a year ago. You throw a tantrum every time you call and I'm not home. Look, sister, I'm out there in the jungle eight hours a day. You wouldn't even let me canvass for Kennedy. You want a job? I got a job for you. Fix up this pigsty. You get a pretty goddamn good salary for testing out this bed all day. You want an extra $50 a week? Try vacuuming. You want an extra 100? Make this goddamn bed. Try opening some goddamn windows. That's why you can't stand up in here. The goddamn place smells like a coffin. Oh... Bobbie. You don't need me. Why do you let yourself in for this kind of abuse? Walk out. Leave me. Please leave me. God's sake, I'd almost marry you if you'd leave me. You call that abuse? You don't know what I'm used to. With all your carrying on, to me you're a gift. So what's it gonna be? You sure know how to screw things up. So where does that leave us? Are you giving me an ultimatum? Is this an ultimatum? Answer me, you ball-busting, castrating, son-of-a-cunt bitch. Is this an ultimatum or not? Because if it is, I'm gonna tell you what you can do with your ultimatum. I'm gonna tell you what you can do with it. You can make this goddamn bed. That's what you can do with it. Goddamn clean these filthy sheets. That's what you can do with it. She's not ready. We're a little early. You're looking good, Cindy. I do my best. Will Bobbie be long? No. Hey... do we have to go to this party? How about it, Cindy? Where's the powder room? Right there. I'm going. You do what you want. Man, she's really something. I'm so bored, I'm going out of my mind. Bored? With that? You must be kidding. You have to go to this party? Stick around. No, it's better that I go. Hey, I just did my hair. I've got this at home. How's your tennis game, Jonathan? We'll have to have a rematch. Anytime. Is she always that way? You know women. Boy, is she competitive. She is very competitive, but I find that attractive. You know her problem? She wants balls. She's all right. I'm not criticising. I wish she were more feminine. She is a little masculine. I just wish she wouldn't always demand her own way. She's got a great body on her. I have to treat her like a child, give her everything she wants. I wouldn't mind giving her something. You got Bobbie. I should only have it that good. Bobbie. Bobbie, are you kidding? I've never seen a body like that. She could do with a little more of what Cindy's got. She's so goddamn passive. Yeah, I wouldn't mind Cindy just lying still once. She's so busy handing out instructions in bed. It's like close-order drill. Yeah, I wouldn't mind a little of that, as long as she doesn't forget who's boss. Hey... you wouldn't want to swap sometime, would you? Are you serious? What do you say? Might liven things up a bit. She can miss one party. Leave her to me. What about Bobbie? She's so mad at me, she'll jump all over you just for revenge. Hey, you like that, huh? Seriously? She's in the bedroom. If you're quiet, you can do it and she won't even know. You bastard. Give me a minute. Tell Sandy it's time to leave. I hope you dance better than you play tennis. Sandy won't mind. What's Sandy got to do with it? You're his girl. He said it would be okay. What did Sandy say? That you and me... you know. That was his idea. You had nothing to do with it? A little. A little or a lot? This much. I'm surprised it took you this long to get around to it. Sandy and I have a party to go to. Sandy's busy. You wanna come around sometime by yourself, that's one thing. I've been expecting that. But you tell Sandy that if he lays one hand on that tub of lard in there, not to come home. So you call me. Jesus. She's semi-comatose. Better send a resuscitation unit and an airway. Be ready to give her an IV on admission. It's on... Tell him we'll put her in intensive care. Bastard. Very slick. Very clever. Well, it's not going to work, Bobbie. That's Bonnie, my first love. She lived upstairs from us. We started exposing ourselves to each other at 10. We got caught on the roof one day by my mother who washed my mouth out with soap. I never got the connection. Here's Emily, my first steady. Until she moved off the block at 11, I never laid a hand on her. Mildred, I think, this one's name was. She followed me around at school. The fellas kidded me about her. I warned her if she didn't stop, I'd beat her up. She picked up her skirt, dropped her drawers and shoved her ass at me. So I got my first sight of ass at 12. Marcia, 13 1/2 or thereabouts, I kissed her one night at a spin-the-bottle party. This one's Rosalie. Rosalie looked just like Elizabeth Taylor in ""National Velvet."" I had a crush on Rosalie from 14 to 15 and I never went near her. In those days, we had illusions. Here's Charlotte. Not much on looks, but great tits for 15. That's Lenny Hartman's sister. My first French kiss, 16 years old. Here's Gloria, the best-built girl at Evander Childs. I took her to the Bronx Zoo once and on the bus, copped a cheap feel. Here's Gwen. I went with her for a year trying to get her to put out, but she thought I was too nice and was saving me for marriage. Every guy at Evander must have gotten into her pants except me. Here's my first... No, that one was a mistake. Here's Eileen, my very first fuck. She was a modern dancer at Swarthmore. Great body on her. What a waste... frigid. Here's Nancy. Sweet kid. She went into biology. Very frigid. Here's Bobbie. My wife. The fastest tits in the West and king of the ball-busters. She conned me into marrying her and now she's killing me with alimony. Don't know how this one get in here? This is my little girl, Wendy. ""Princess,"" I call her. Isn't she a dreamboat? Here's a real cunt. I forget her name. A Nazi. I banged her in Berlin. Here's something I went with for a couple of months. First time I banged her was on a yacht race to Nassau. This slob I went with for a year until I got so sick of her ball-busting, I couldn't get it up anymore. I can't remember her name. This was my Jap in the sack. I heard that Oriental girls were different. Not in America, they're not. Here's a 16-year-old I gave 20 bucks to one night in the village when I was drunk. Maybe you know her, Jennifer. She gave me a dose. That's all, folks. What are you crying for? It's not a Lassie movie. Sorry about that. Or something. So, what else is new? To tell you the truth, I don't see anybody anymore. Neither do we. Well, you've got each other. I thought she was your daughter when you first came in. In a lot of ways, she's older than I am. Yeah. She knows worlds I can't even begin to touch yet. Sandy, please. I found out who I am. You're in big trouble. Same old Jonathan. Indubitably. Let me talk to her about you, John. Talk to her about me? I'm 40, she's nine. You just don't get it, do you? Oh, I get it, all right. I've been getting it for a long time. What's the point? Sandy, you found a good piece of ass. God bless you. You're my friend, I'm happy for you. As long as it lasts, I'm happy for you. You deserve to be happy. I mean it. Why fight? Okay? All those games. Jesus Christ. You don't need those games, Jonathan. I know. I've played more games than anyone. The obedient son game. The bright student game. - The cocksman's game. - Some cocksman. The respectable husband game. The good father game. - The specialist game. - Good father? Games don't impress Jennifer. Just life, just love. Yeah, well, I don't want to argue with you, Sandy. So let's just agree to disagree, okay? Don't make me mad, okay? Jennifer knows more at 18 than Susan knows to this day. You found yourself a real jewel, okay? She's my love teacher. Finally got it up, huh? You give off such bad vibrations. Bad vibrations? Sandy, I love you, but you're a schmuck. You were always young, Sandy, open. You were schmucky a lot of the time, but maybe schmuckiness is what you need to stay young and open. Listen... don't listen to me. You're doing great, and I'm making money. You can find what I found, Jonathan. Don't make me insult you. Women... All ball-busters, right? You know it. When you think of some of the things he has to dip into, any guy with a conscience has a right to turn soft. Am I right, Louise? You're always right, lover. I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight. - You don't? - No, I don't. Are you sure? You wanna bet? How much? The sky's the limit. God damn it. What did I do? You're doing it all wrong. I'm doing it like always. You never said that before. - Said what? - ""Sky's the limit."" Sure, I... Never. What do I say? You forgot, didn't you? A hundred. I say a hundred. Okay. It just came out. I just want it right, that's all. I don't think we're going to have any trouble tonight. - You don't? - No, I don't. Are you sure? You wanna bet? How much? A hundred? You sound pretty sure. You're a kind of man... why shouldn't I be sure? What kind of man am I? A real man. A kind man. I'm not kind. I don't mean weak kind, the way so many men are. I mean the kindness that comes from an enormous strength, from an inner power so strong that every act, no matter what, is more proof of that power. That's what all women resent. That's why they try to cut you down. Because your knowledge of yourself and them is so right, so true that it exposes the lies which they, every scheming one of them, live by. It takes a true woman to understand that the purest form of love is to love a man who denies himself to her. A man who inspires worship, because he has no need for any woman, because he has himself. And who is better, more beautiful, more powerful, more perfect. You're getting hard. More strong, more masculine, more extraordinary, more robust... It's rising. It's rising. More virile, domineering. More irresistible... It's up... in the air., -Jer, clean or dirty? -Marginal. No, it's not. I don't know why you use that thing. I mean, if it's for me, it's not necessary. -Of course, I do like to watch you use it. -I know. Listen, I think we should wait with the powder room. Nope, no more waiting for toilets. I just don't like to see you worrying about loans and mortgages, that's all. Then don't look. I don't think we should spend money-- No more thinking tonight! Let's watch TV. Is there any good mail today? A couple of junk, some bills, and a letter for you. Read this. ""God grants you an interview. ""1600 North Hope Street, Los Angeles, California. ""Room 2700. Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m."" It's a gag. No stamp, no return address? Pretty crazy gag. -It's an ad. -For what? For God oven cleaner, or God detergent, or I don't know. Nobody would dare. Air ball. Artie Coogan. -What? -Artie Coogan, that's it. Yeah. Crazy Artie. No, an English teacher wouldn't misspell ""interview."" Neither would God. I can't meet him tomorrow. I've got to meet the District Produce Manager. -Sorry, God. -Two points. Did we make love last night? Just checking. Keep checking. I love you. Honey, it's so late. That was two points. -Wash your hands, Norman. -We were just.... Good morning, Mr. McCarthy. I'm sorry to be late, sir. Landers. Hold it. Is this how you've instructed your staff to prepare romaine lettuce for display? I know what you're getting at, and I had the same argument... -...with the last district manager. -Please answer. Yes, I do. Why would anyone buy that... ...when they could get this for the same price? Mr. McCarthy, if I put this head of lettuce in the bin, it's going to stay there all day... ...it'll be there tomorrow and the next day... ...and we will wind up throwing it away. Our other stores-- They do not have a Ralph's up the street and a Lucky Market... ...right around the corner who trim even closer than I do. Now, I know my customers, Mr. McCarthy. I see. Landers? I also noticed that you haven't been oiling your cukes. -What? -Why haven't you been oiling your cukes? It takes time, it takes oil, it's dishonest, Mr. McCarthy. -Dishonest? -Sir, there's an interview that I-- Look, our company has certain policies, which-- I have an interview with.... You have a what? Thank you very much. Stay. What is this? You're right on time, I like that. Close the door. -Who are you? -You read the note. -Who is that, Artie? -God. -Come on, Artie. -No, it's me, God. -God? -Right, God. God Almighty, Big ""G"". It's not a gag, I promise. -Where you going? -I've got this load of plums coming in. Let the plums wait. How often do you talk with God? Practically never. How do I know you're God? All I hear is a voice on an intercom. You're not allowed to see me. -Why not? -Because. -That's no answer. -Sue me. -If you're God.... -Yeah? -If you're really God.... -Yeah? If I'm really God, what? -You leaving? -Right the first time. Where are you leaving? Where do you think you are? What do you mean, where? Right here is where, that's where. -And where is here? -1600 North Hope Street, Room 2700. Jerry. There's no Room 2700 in this building. There's no 27th floor here. I thought, this way we'd have a little privacy. Check it out, Go ahead, I'll wait. -Sir? -Yes, sir? How do I get to the 27th floor? -In this building? -Yeah. I'm afraid you'd need a can opener. We only have 17 floors. Seventeen. Have a nice ride? Come in. Close the door. Sit down. Go ahead. Relax. Don't smoke. -I don't. -Good. Tobacco was one of my big mistakes. -Mistakes? -You try. Ostriches were a mistake. Silly looking things, Avocados. Made the pit too big, Like I say, ""You try."" You still don't believe it? Artie, if this is you, you win. -This is the best gag you've ever pulled. -I'm not Artie. Went to a lot of trouble to make it a comfortable interview. You misspelled it, you know. -What? -""Interview."" In your note. It's ""I"".... It's ""I"" before ""E."" Give me a break, A few things, I got right. I put summer before winter, didn't I? You're scared. Well, sure. But look, if this is a joke, it's gone too far. It's no joke. How come you've got such a.... Just a voice, like everybody's? Empathy, I'm talking to you in a way you can accept. I'm relating. I don't like to brag, but if I appeared to you just as God... ...how I really am, what I really am, your mind couldn't grasp it. I think you made a mistake. I'm not religious. So? I'm not one of your believers. And I sure as heck don't believe this. That's why I showed up. Too many nonbelievers. But I read in an article that religion is on the upswing. Religion is easy, I'm talking about faith. You're going to help me change that. Me? -I don't belong to any church. -Neither do I. Go back to work. I don't want you to get in trouble. Thank you. We'll talk on the way. -How? -Trust me, Like it says on the money. Sir? Are you all right, sir? No. Jerry. -You want me to talk louder? -Oh, God. I thought you didn't believe in me? That's just an expression. I'm more than that, and I want you to spread the word. Me? -Spread what word? -That I am, I exist. That we've spoken. You want me to tell people that I've spoken with God? -Yes. -They'll put me away. I'm tired of all the talk that I may be dead, or that I never was at all. Or that God was just particles of cosmos, Gas. I'm not gas, I found that very insulting. -Do you actually expect people to believe-- -That's your job. But I'm just a man. I'm no Moses. What was Moses? Do you think Moses was born on Page 1? Moses was just a messenger, my messenger. Look.... God, if.... If I tell people that I spoke with God, they.... And now an oldie but a goodie, Jerry Gray and A String of Pearls, God? Top-ten time on KGOD, What is it, Jerry? That guy on the motorcycle thinks I'm a nut. Is that the kind of God you are? -How come you didn't let him hear you? -That's a policy of mine. I try not to work with more than one savior at a time. Savior? Me? -You do your job right.... -I can't take this job. I don't believe-- I know, but even nonbelievers want what they've got down here to work. Have you read the papers lately? It ain't working. That's why I came, to tell everybody I set the world up so it can work. Only, it's up to you. You can't look to me to do it for you. No. You can do it, It's only one message. -Moses had to handle ten. -But you gave him tablets. -He had a bad memory. -I need something. What kind of something? I don't know. Anything. A tape recording. My voice wouldn't come out on tape. It's very complicated. It's like, you know how Dracula can't see himself in a mirror? It's along those lines. If people could just hear your voice-- This isn't even how I sound, I'm talking like this so that you'll understand me. Understand? I don't understand anything. That's a beginning, Over and out. Hold it. Don't hang up on me. You just went through a red light. You're going to get yourself killed. I need you down here. I have some nice, fresh chicken soup. Why don't you let me fix you a bowl? Is that all I can get from you? Soup? -You know what, darling? -What? Why don't you and I take a few days off and go on a little holiday? -A holiday? -Yeah. We could go to San Francisco. You haven't even seen your sister's new baby yet. You don't want me to see my sister's baby. You want me to see my sister's husband. I am not crazy, and I don't need some child psychiatrist to tell me... ...that I didn't talk to God, because I did. -On an intercom. -And on the car radio. Yes, Jerry. Do you remember when Artie Coogan set up that hidden microphone... ...and he broadcast those filthy limericks through the television set? It was not Artie. I know all of Artie's voices. Artie is not capable of adding 10 stories to a building that doesn't have them. He cannot talk back and forth through a car radio... ...that's been busted for two months. Whoever the hell this guy is, he's very smart. And I'm going to listen to him. -For a while. -And you think it's God? Well, he thinks he's God. And I'm in no position to argue with him. -I thought you believed in him. -I do. I believe in God. I just don't believe that he exists. I mean, in the sense... ...that he repaints floor numbers in office buildings or doubles as a disc jockey. Well, that is what he does. And he wants you to give his message to the world? Yes. Jerry, does he know how you feel about him? I told him. Doesn't seem to bother him. So is that all he told you? That you're going to be the savior? And that to tell everybody, what we have down here can work? Yes. He also told me, he's very disappointed in avocados. -He is? -He said he made the pit too big. I am not crazy! Jerry? I let you sleep a little later. I'll take the kids to school, okay? How do you feel? You know, about.... I almost forgot. I'm fine. Good. Because, you know, I was thinking... ...you didn't actually see, all you did was hear. And you know what they say. -What? -Seeing is believing. Not hearing. -What about Ingrid Bergman? -Ingrid Bergman? Joan of Arc. She played Joan of Arc. Joan of Arc. Joan didn't see either. She just heard, like me. Jerry? -Oh, God. -That's right. -Is that you? -In person. -You're not on the radio? -Have you got a radio out here? -No. -Bingo. You're here? -In my bathroom? -Come take a look. -I can't. I'm naked. -You think I don't know what you've got? That was another little goof of mine. Shame. I don't know why I thought we needed shame. Come on out. Don't catch cold. Not what you expected? I picked a look you could understand. For someone else, I would've looked different. I could do any face, voice, whatever. I could even be a woman. -Feeling a little strange? -Very strange. Like you're going to faint? You know what's good for that? Shaving. -Shaving? -Sometimes when you don't feel normal... ...doing a normal thing makes you feel normal. Here, start shaving. Go ahead. I am. I don't mean with the shaving... ...with the questions that are popping into your head. Yeah. -Why me? -Why not you? You mean, there's no special-- Life is a crap shoot, like the millionth customer who crosses a bridge... ...gets to shake hands with the governor. You thought I picked you because you're better than everybody? I'm not? You're better than some, but not as good as others. But you crossed the bridge at the right time. If you wanted to see me, why didn't you just appear over my bed? Hollywood. Next question. People are always praying to you. Do you listen? I can't help hearing. I don't always listen. -Then you don't care? -Of course I care. I care plenty. But what can I do? What can you do? You're God. Only for the big picture. I don't get into details. Then whatever happens to us-- Happens. Here, I put in a new blade. You mean, there's no plan... ...no scheme to guide our destinies? -A lot of it is luck. -Luck? Just luck? Put on a little toilet paper. I'll get you a piece. -You don't control our lives? -I gave you a world and everything in it. It's all up to you. -But we need help. -That's why I gave you each other. Here. With your powers, you could solve so many problems. Don't wet it. -Are you sure? -Am I sure? Did I do a good job on the Grand Canyon? Anyway, why don't you? Solve all our problems. -Work a few miracles. -I don't do miracles. They're too flashy. And they upset the natural balance. No miracles? I knew it. Maybe now and then, just to keep my hand in. The last miracle I did was the 1969 Mets. Before that, I think you have to go back to the Red Sea. That was a beauty. No offense, but I don't believe the Red Sea... ...and I don't believe six days to create the world. You're right. -I am? -Tell you the truth... ...I thought about it for five days and did the whole job in one. I'm really best under pressure. -One day to create the world? -And the sun. I hate to work in the dark. You have to remember... ...that one of my days is not exactly one of yours. How long are they? When I got up this morning, Sigmund Freud was still in medical school. -If you're so involved with us.... -Yeah? How can you permit all the suffering that goes on in the world? -How can I permit the suffering? -Yeah. I don't permit the suffering. You do. Free will. All the choices are yours. Choices? What choices? You can love, cherish and nurture each other, or you can kill each other. Incidentally, ""kill"" is the word. It's not ""waste."" If I meant ""waste,"" I would have written, ""Thou shalt not waste."" You're doing some very funny things with words here. You're also turning the sky into mud. I look down, I don't believe the filth. Using rivers for toilets, poisoning my fishes. You want a miracle? You make a fish from scratch. You can't. You think only God can make a tree? Try coming up with a mackerel. And when the last one is gone, that'll be that. Eighty-six on the fishes. Good-bye, sky. So long, world. Over and out. -I thought you said we would make it. -I said, you have to make it work. -You don't care. -I do care. -Then do something about it. -I did. I got you to carry the ball. -I got no ball. How can I carry it? -I gave you a mouth, didn't l? Tell people how I feel, what I said. How do I do that? How did you get to be an assistant manager? Did you ever hear of newspapers, reporters? You got a scoop here, an exclusive, a hold-the-presses. Fine. And how do I convince anybody that I've actually seen you? -That you exist? -Simple. Show them this. -Your card? -No, it's not my card. It's God's card. -It's God's card? -Look at it. I am. -Do you know where I got it? -At a novelty store? -God gave it to me. -Did he? -May I ask when and where you got it? -This morning, in my bathroom. God visited you in your bathroom this morning? Yes. Sounds crazy to you, doesn't it? Yesterday, he was just a voice on an intercom... ...and then he was on the radio. -God spoke to you on the radio? -In my car. -What station? -All stations. Right. And then this morning, he showed up in your bathroom? Yes. Why do you suppose the Almighty spoke to you, Mr.-- -Landers. -Mr. Landers. Jerry Landers. He said that he wanted me to be his messenger, like Moses. What sort of work do you do, Mr. Landers? I'm the assistant manager of Food World in Burbank. I see. Then you don't speak to God every day. Never before yesterday. Did God say why he needed a messenger... -...at this particular time, Mr. Landers? -Yes, he was very specific. He said that he wanted us to know that it can work. -What ""it"" is that? -Us ""it."" Our lives, our world, everything. He says that he's given us everything that we need, and it's entirely up to us. -And those were his exact words? -Close enough. You can print that. Did God specify the Los Angeles Times? That was my idea. Well, we're very grateful. I'm not a nut. -I didn't say that you were. -I'm not even religious. Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Landers, for bringing us this story. Look, don't brush me off. Do me a favor, and look at that card again. Take a good hard look at it. Certainly. Now, does that look like something I'd get at a novelty shop? Yes. Norman, did you just put a bag of potatoes on top of that white bread? No, sir. -I think you did. -Mr, Landers, please come to Aisle 10. Aisle 10, please. Did you hear that, Norman? Yes, never put a bag of potatoes on top of a white bread. No, the page. I was just paged. Did you hear that? I didn't hear anything. Did l? We'll get you a new white bread, ma'am. Take care of it. God? Chemicals, all chemicals. Turning kids into garbage cans. Jerry, I didn't see one word in the newspapers. Of course not. That guy at the Times kept looking at me like I was some kind of lunatic. And I felt like one. -Did you show him my card? -Sure I did. And he said, ""You can get one of those in any novelty store."" Here. You know, I really felt like an idiot. Please, don't do that to me again. -You said what I said? -Absolutely. And they didn't find God's word fit to print? Some tough cookies, boy. -Did you get the Coke? -Yes. I have Cup-a-Soup. -Good morning, Mrs. Levin. -Hi. -Mrs. Green. -Hi, Jerry. You know, I'd like you to meet.... -You did it to me again. -What'd she do? What? Nothing. -Can I help you ladies? -No. -We're all right. -Yes, thank you. -What was that all about? -I don't know. -Why did you change on me? -Why did you start to introduce me? I don't want to be the only guy in the world-- Look, I can't make appearances all over. Don't you understand? -No, I don't. -People would drop dead from hysterics. -Mr. Landers? -This place is too busy. Can you sign this, please? Jerry? Up here. -Let's go for a ride. -I'll meet you. -Where? -What? Not you. I can't understand it. Why wouldn't a religious editor believe you? Face it, you goofed again, just like the avocado pit. You picked the wrong message boy. -You don't believe I'm here, do you? -No, I don't. Then how do you explain this conversation we're having? I'm having. I'm dreaming you. And I ought to be real glad when I wake up, too. What color are my eyes? My eyes? Blue. My shirt? Red plaid. What does that got to do with anything? -Do you dream in color? -No. Bingo, again. Okay. All right. You know a lot of things... ...and you've been making things happen... ...but none of it seems.... -Godlike? -Yeah. Godlike. Now, what, to you, would be Godlike? -Change the weather. -Special effects? What would you like? A little earthquake? Small hurricane? No, I wouldn't want anybody hurt. I was just thinking, maybe, what about a little rain? -Little rain? -Yeah. A small shower. One small shower. You got it. It's raining. You made it rain. You didn't even bat an eye. You didn't lift a finger. -Rain's not that hard. -It's unbelievable. -Would you like it to rain a little harder? -No, this is fine. -How about bigger drops? -No. This is fine. Would you care for a little snow? I don't believe it. It's not raining outside. It's just in here. Why should I spoil everybody's day? -This is fantastic. -Thank you. -It's just like Noah's ark. -Same thing, without the smell. -What's the problem, officer? -I was about to ask you. My radiator must be leaking. I'm sorry about that. A radiator doesn't hold that much water. I must have driven through a car wash with my windows open? -That'd do it. -Yeah. -Roll up the windows next time. -Yes, sir, I will. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. -He believed that dumb excuse. -There's an aura of goodness around you. You. Going to try a little harder to get the word out? -Yeah! I'll give it another shot! -That's my boy. Mr. Briggs. -You're all wet. -Of course I'm wet. I didn't dry myself, I wanted you to see this. Do you remember me? Of course. You're the nonbeliever who spoke to God, twice, I believe. Four times, now. -Is he still visiting you in the toilet? -I just rode with him in my car. This time, I have got the proof. -He gave you another calling card? -No. He made it rain inside the car. This water that I'm dripping all over here is water that he made. This is holy water. -If you'll excuse me, I really am in a hurry. -I will not excuse you, Mr. Briggs! You are a reporter of religious events... ...and this is the most important religious event of our time. And I expect you.... I don't expect, I insist, that you print his message... ...in your paper and give it the prominence it deserves. Or, by God, you'll hear from me again. Jerry. No, listen to this. ""It should come as no surprise to anyone that in these tense-filled times... ""...religious freaks abound. ""From the Bronx cabbie who claims he drove Mary Magdalene... ""...to the airport last Christmas...."" Listen. ""To the Burbank, California, supermarket manager... ""...who insists he has had four conversations with God, no less."" What? ""According to this second gentleman... ""...who flashes a calling card with God's name on it... ""...God wants very much for us to know... ""...He is alive and well and that our world can work. It's up to us."" Let me see that. The Los Angeles Times. -Where is it? -How could you, for God's.... It's right here, with some terrific company. See this? A janitor who sleeps all night tied up on a cross. Did anybody else say they saw God? No, but there's an insurance salesman selling life-after-death policies. But only you have talked to the Big Boss. Did you just say that you saw him? -Yes. -You didn't just hear him? One line. That's all they gave it is one line. -Are you saying now that you saw God? -Three times, yeah. -Three times? -In the bathroom, at work, and in the car. One lousy line. I don't believe it. Let's go away for a couple days, okay? -Bobbie, I know how crazy this all sounds. -No, you don't. I saw him. He spoke to me. All right, let's say, for a minute, that you saw God-- Look, don't humor me. That'll really make me crazy. Okay! You saw him. -But why is he talking to you? -Why not me? Why not the Pope, or Billy Graham, or somebody way up there? -He doesn't care about religion. -God doesn't care about religion? That's what he said. He sure picked a funny business to go into then, didn't he? I'm sorry, Jerry. I can't seem to accept the concept of you... ...actually having a real, honest-to-God conversation with God. I don't understand why he wanted to talk to you. God, listen to me, this whole thing is making me nuts now, too. Too? -You do think I'm crazy. -No. I don't think you're crazy. Which is why I think I'm crazy. Bobbie, how can I convince anyone at all, if I can't convince you? Jerry, for some reason that I can't even begin to fathom... ...you really believe all this stuff, don't you? Can't you? I believe... ...that you believe. Which, in some sense, is the same as believing, I guess, isn't it? Do you understand what I've said? Do you have any questions? Adam? Sounds pretty bananas, Dad. Hello? Who? No, he isn't home right now. No, that's not him. Yes, you can print that in your paper. He is definitely not the man in the Times today. -Can I go now, Dad? -Sure, Son. I'll meet you. Look, I'm his wife. You can believe me. Don't call back. -What do you think? -Maybe he's going through a stage. You know, ""mentalpause."" That's ""menopause."" -Yeah, like Grandma. -I hope. And finally, this note. The Los Angeles Sunday Times reports today that in Tarzana, California... ...a supermarket manager, Jerry Landers, had an alleged conversation... ...with someone he claimed was God. According to the story, God has appeared on earth to reaffirm... ...that He lives and our world can work. It's up to us. This reporter would like to hedge his bets on the outside chance... ...that God did make this appearance and that he just might be tuned to ABC. We'd like him to know, we did report it. This is Jerry Dunphy. Thank you and good night. -Even Moses didn't give his last name. -That should get the phone ringing. I told you. Hello. Yes, this is Jerry Landers. It's the Tarzana Daily Review. Yes, I'm the one. Spoke with him? Absolutely. About 6 foot, blondish hair.... Oh, him. About 5' 7"", I guess. Gray hair. -I almost forgot my project. -Jerry. -I'm coming! -You made the front page. What? -Everybody, look. -What? Channel 11? That's the 10:00 news. -Can we stay up and watch us? -Jerry, I don't want the kids on TV. Can't be any worse than watching it. Don't worry. Come on, kids. Hold the cameras. -Mr, Landers? -Yes. Channel 11, 10:00 news. You're quoted as saying that you've talked with God, sir? Yes. -Face to face? -That's right. He's a fruitcake. And you say God wants to affirm he's alive and he's very disappointed... -...with the way we're handling our world? -That's right. How are you going to get people to believe you? It wasn't my idea. He picked me. Is God going to reveal himself to you, as you claim he has? Not as I claim he has. As he has. I don't know if he'll show up again, but he gave me his message and-- -Dad. It's 10 to. -Yes, Adam. That he exists? Yes, and that he would like us to cherish and nurture each other... -...as opposed to killing one another. -He said that? Yeah, that he's our shepherd, and we shall not want. -We can quote you? -I didn't make that up. For 10:00 news, this is Mario Machado and the man who talked to God in Tarzana. The second time, the first time was in Los Angeles. I stand corrected. Mr, Landers, please call Mr, Summers at his office. Mr, Summers for Mr, Landers. -Landers. -Mr. Summers. Glad you could get here so fast. -Well, you said-- -Right, have a seat. Thank you. -How's it going, Landers? -Fine. -You took over while Slavic is vacationing? -Yes, sir. -Think you can handle a store as manager? -I'm sure I can. Good. -Everything all right at home? -Wonderful. The missus? Kids? Adam? Betsy? Becky. Good, what is this ""seeing God"" crap all about? It's not crap, Mr. Summers. I've seen him. I've heard it all in this chair. I know what being a manager can do to a man. Trouble with books. -Humping check-out girls in the freezer. -I'm only the assistant. You can tell me. There's nothing like that to tell. I really have seen him. Landers, the founder and principal stockholder of Food World... ...is a man devoted to prayer. Lowell Wilson has personally gotten down on his knees... ...with three US Presidents. He attended prayer breakfasts and asked for God's blessing... ...with the Joint Chiefs of Staff right in the war room of the Pentagon. I don't think that Mr. Wilson is going to take too kindly to the idea... ...that one of his employees... ...is claiming to have had a personal audience with the Almighty himself. I should think that he would be very happy to know that his prayers are heard. Mr. Wilson has reached that point in his life... ...where he can be sure his prayers are heard. He doesn't need any help from you. It's not me. I'm just kind of like a Moses. Look, Landers. I don't want to pump any sunshine up your skirt... ...but you have a future at Food World. Don't blow it. Now, you just keep your mouth shut, and stay away from reporters. And if I don't? God may have been interested in you as an assistant manager... ...we'll just see how he feels about you as a bag stuffer. Over here! I thought I'd straighten up a little. The mess people make. Take a seat. It's started? You said you saw me, and the pressure started. -Is it going to get any worse? -How should I know? What do you mean, how should you know? -How could I know? -You know everything. I only know what is. Also, I'm very big on what was. On what isn't yet, I haven't got a clue. -But when you said-- -Move your foot. Sit down. When you said everything would work out... ...I thought you could tell the future. Absolutely, I could tell the future, the minute it becomes the past. I said, everything could work out, if that's everybody's choice. People have to decide what's to be done with the world. I can't make a personal decision for everybody. Why the face? So far, so good. We hit the papers, a little TV, we're in business. I'm liable to lose my job. Lose a job, save a world. Not a bad deal. Hey, Adam. -What are you doing here? -I got off early from work, Son. I thought I'd give you a lift home. No thanks, Dad. I'll walk. -Come on. -No, I got new tennis shoes on. I want to break them in. See you later. Come on, let's go. Why wouldn't they be embarrassed? -Their friends ribbed the hell out of them. -That's rotten. They wanted to know if you could get their test answers from God. And could he do anything about their little-league team? They gave them a very rough day. Jerry, what are you going to do about Mr. Summers? What can I do? What do you want me to do? I want you to say no more about it, like he said not to. Bobbie, Mr. Summers represents Food World. God is with ""World World."" It's a slightly bigger obligation. -Bigger than your job? -I have no choice. That's the problem. The problem is, you do! How far do you intend to take this? How long is this going to go on? Until everyone gets the message. Until I can convince people of this miracle. I mean, that's what it is. It's a miracle, nothing less. I have to reach the greatest number of people possible and tell them. It's for you. The producer of The Dinah Shore Show. You've been on television a long.... Not that long. I'm sorry. No, I'm much younger than I look. -No, I didn't want to say it that way. -You look.... I'm younger than people think I am, because I've been around a long time. Everything you've done has had such tremendous impact. It's been magnificent. I've never done anything bad in my life. I'm one of the perfect people. -That's kind of exciting. -It is. Do you remember your first moment on television? Actually, I do, It was in 1948. It was Maggie McNellis's Crystal Room. We were told to be visual in those days. The Picture of Dorian Grey was very popular then. I gave a 15-second impression of The Picture of Dorian Grey, About the man who carouses. He stays looking good, but his picture falls apart. -Ready, Mr. Landers? -Right. I think I broke a jaw. America is not ready for this. Okay, you'll take the empty seat next to Dinah. -This show is taped, isn't it? -Yes, it'll be on a week from today. You may have read about my next guest in the newspapers recently. He is a supermarket manager from Tarzana, California... ...who says that he has been instructed by God to spread the message... ...that God lives and God cares. Please welcome Mr. Jerry Landers. -Am I on? -Almost, that applause is for you. -Is Dinah nice, Daddy? -Not now, honey. -You're not nervous, are you? -No. I don't mind telling you, I am. You have some pretty powerful friend. -Why are they laughing? -Just watch. Because God is Daddy's friend. -Why do you suppose he picked you, Jerry? -God only knows, I mean.... You're right. You said that God wants us to know that he still cares. Is there anything else that he wants us to know? Yes, that he's given us everything that we need to make our life work... ...make the world work, and that he's watching us. -He's watching? -Yes. Watching us? -Now? -Yes. You agreed earlier to be part of an experiment today... ...with the Los Angeles Police Department. Do you want me to take a lie detector test? -No. -I will. What this is, is a sketch artist from the Los Angeles Police Department. He's an expert and very adept at making a sketch from a description. I think all of us here would like to know what God looks like. You would like to know. -Shall we? -Okay. Follow me. -Jerry, this is Mr, Fernando Ponce. -Hello, sir. -Please sit there. -Thank you. Mr, Ponce, as I said, is an expert at eyewitness sketches... ...for the LA Police Department. -How do I start? -Tell me about the shape of his face. The shape is... ...triangular. -Good. -I guess. -He's got large ears. -He has? Jerry, I don't believe you actually did this. It was their idea. He does, He wears glasses. God wears glasses? He's wearing a fishing cap. -A fishing cap? -Maybe it's like a baseball cap. His lips are kind of thin. His nose is straight. It's round on the ends. No one's supposed to know what God looks like. -I do. -You do? Yeah. In Bible Comics, they had a picture of him last week. They're horn-rimmed glasses. They're plastic ones, you know? Where would you suppose he would get his glasses? I don't know. -Anywhere he likes. -Yeah. Boy, I sure hope my friends are doing their homework. This is what God looked like to you? He's sort of captured the sense... ...I guess. America, here it is... ...as seen through the eyes of Jerry Landers. God. Dad, you're going to get God arrested. -You said it would be done by 6:00. -I'm sorry, but I just got the part. -Weren't you on the Dinah Show last night? -Yeah. Yeah, that was real different. Excuse me. How am I supposed to get home now? Where to, mister? Get in. I hope you have a license. -Did you watch Dinah Shore last night? -I watch everything. I got you national exposure. I hope you're happy. I could be happier. How? For starters, you do a show like that... ...you don't let them put you on the last few minutes. That's for fellas who write diet books. It wasn't up to me. And what was that drawing thing? -He was a police artist. -Man draws crooks. Makes everybody look like a crook. Made me look like a second-story man. -It's publicity. -I'm used to a little better treatment. That painting of me by Michelangelo, that's a picture. And he did it laying flat on his back. Now what happens? Now we see who can still believe, who wants to, who needs to. A few million people saw you last night, right? A few million? Some of them will believe you. Some are going to want to punch me in the head. Some will want to fire me. Some may decide I'm too crazy to live with. We can't worry about those. The ball is rolling. -Yeah, right over me. -Don't be a malcontent, I'll watch over you. While you're watching over me, would you mind watching the road? I'd rather watch a nice sunset. Dinah Shore must get a pretty big rating. You're on, kid. -Jerry? -Yes, God? You have the strength that comes from knowing. Can I have one minute with you? I have something very important to say. It just can't wait. Please, bless my baby. Touch him, pray for him. Pray for my baby. If I could just have one second with you.... -It's not for me, it's for you. -Sanctify my body. Bless him, make him a true believer! I have something very important. This is for you! -Give me your golden staff. -I can't! -God said it's okay. -I'll tell you this, it's very important! Officer, could you move the rest of them along? Yes, sir. One little moment, please. What I have to tell him is-- Okay. I went to empty the garbage, and two people blessed me. Then one of them blessed the garbage. And then he asked me if our children were conceived immaculately. Now, calm down, honey. The police had to take our kids to school today. -They said it was safer. -That's awful! Yes, that's awful. You want to hear awfuller? Mr. Summers said that Lowell Wilson... ...is personally deciding whether or not you can keep your job. Is that awful enough for you? Now, Bobbie, don't let it get to you. Don't let it get to me? Jerry, it's gotten to me! Don't you see? Jerry, look, you've got him to talk to. It's just me here, me and those religious nuts outside! I have to leave the phone off the hook. People keep calling up and asking to talk to God. Except, of course, for the guy who offered to chew on my pantyhose! Telegrams, notes in the mail box and the doorways. Today they even put one in the dog's mouth. This is from the university. I've been invited to appear before a theology group. -They want to verify the miracle. -Terrific. It is! This'll give me credibility, and God'll get his word across. It'll help me keep my job. Mr. Landers, it is the consensus of this group... ...that you are a person of little or no theological knowledge. You have demonstrated, over the years... ...an astonishing lack of interest in spiritual matters. It strikes me, as one who has actually heard his voice... ...that you have virtually no prerequisites to make direct contact... -...with the Almighty, whatsoever. -You've heard him? He has made his word known to me. What was he wearing? I know his word through the scriptures. It would be blasphemy to suggest... ...that we could describe the Creator in human terms. Why? If He created us... ...why wouldn't he appear to us as one of us? Don't you.... Don't you, young man... ...try to teach this assemblage the role of the Deity. Rabbi Silverstone, my good and great friend... ...brother in the work of the Lord, with whom we have broke bread many times... ...is a pillar of the American Jew community. Bishop Reardon represents millions of Roman Catholics. Bishop Marcos, multitudes of Greek Orthodoxers. Why, we have virtually every religious persuasion... ...represented here today. And I personally have been chosen... ...to render the benediction at this year's Super Bowl. Mr. Landers, we really find insufficient documentation... ...to support your claim. But you're not saying it didn't happen. No, we are saying there is insufficient documentation. Which puts the score at God 7, you 0. We have decided, however, out of a sense of fairness... ...and ecclesiastical curiosity... ...to allow you to present us with certain evidence. What evidence? We have assembled a set of questions... ...for you to ask God. There are 50 questions. Fifty. You want me to get God to take a quiz? Unless you've been concealing an abundant knowledge-- Which I find highly doubtful. There are questions there that you could not possibly answer. Look, I don't know when... ...or if he'll ever appear again. As a control measure, you will remain locked in your hotel room... ...alone. -Not even my wife? -No. There'll be no outside calls, whatsoever. You could, of course, decline. But then, that would form the basis of our report. God? -God? -Room service. Just put it right around over here, please. You can't come in. I understand. Do I need to sign this? Thank you very much. -They forgot the ketchup. -Come in! They're playing our number. $11 for a steak? Who would have thought? With me, cows were an afterthought. Just to give new mothers a little rest. -Boy, am I glad to see you. -Eat. It'll get cold. Pretty cute. -What is it? -They made sure you couldn't answer. The questions are in the ancient tongue of Aramaic. Is that what that is? They've figured out so many ways to talk to each other, they're finding nobody can. Let's see. ""What's the true origin of the universe? ""What is the source of the planet Earth?"" It's a History final, right? So many repeats. Eat the steak, and then get a pen. ""Did man fall from grace in the Garden of Eden?"" I'll tell you something, never came out. I made Adam 17. Eve was 15, 16, tops. I figured then, 16, 17 was middle-age, you know. Who knew people would live so long? Trees, I figured they had the best chance. Now I realize that they were kids, babies. Young people can't fall from my grace. They're my best things. Put that down. -""Which of the world's--"" -Wait. Okay. ""Which of the world's religions is the closest to the divine truth?"" The divine truth is not in a building or a book or a story. Put down that the heart is the temple wherein all truth resides. ""Is Jesus Christ the son of God?"" Jesus was my son. Buddha was my son. Mohammed, Moses, you... ...the man who said there was no room in the inn was my son. So is the one who charges $11 for steak in this one. Let's mush on. What was that last question? -""Will there--"" -""Will there be a judgment day for man?"" If they mean a doomsday, an end-of-the-world thing... ...I'm certainly not going to get into that. But if you want my personal opinion, I wouldn't look forward to it. There'd be a lot of yelling, and I don't need that anymore than you do. Got that? Got it. ""What is the meaning of man's existence?"" Life is like a glass of tea. No, I better not go for laughs. Voltaire may have had me pegged, right? He said I was a comedian playing to an audience who's afraid to laugh. But seriously, put down that man and women-persons... ...their existence means exactly and precisely... ...not more, not one tiny bit less, just what they think it means. What I think doesn't count at all. -That's very profound. -Sometimes I get lucky. -Last question. -Thank God. You're welcome. ""Why have you chosen to appear at this time?"" You've already said. Maybe they want to hear it in your own words. I want to say to everyone that everything around them that they see and smell... ...and feel and hear, they should delight in all this. That what is here are some of my very best ideas. I want everyone to try very hard... ...to make sure it doesn't all go down the drain. Give me, I'll do it. Can you remember exactly what you said? It was perfect. Boy, these answers are really going to get them. That's my handwriting! lmagine that. Shall I call the panel and tell them I'm ready? Never mind the panel. You deliver those papers to Rev. Williams... -...the one who looks like a football player. -I didn't like him. He's having one of his big dos at the Shrine Auditorium. Every time I turn around, he's spreading the word, my word. Only, my words he ran out of years ago. I'll tell you the truth. The reason I put everybody here naked... ...I wasn't trying to be cute, I just didn't want to create clothes. With clothes, there's right away pockets, and you have to put something in them. You take these, and give them to Rev. Bigmouth. Tell him that God says he's a phony. Also, tell him if he wants to get rich, fine. Tell him to sell Earth Shoes. But personally tell him I'd like him to shut up. I'll see you. God? Yeah? -Thank you. -Hope I get an ""A."" Love. Let's talk about love. What is it? You can love your brother, can't you? You can love your wife or your husband. You can love your new dress. You can love my new car. You can pass by a pet shop... ...and say, ""I just love that little doggie in the window, "" You can love this, and you can love that. But what am I talking about? Some folks say... ...that love is what they saw in a pornographic movie. But that is lust, not love. -Is that what you want? -No! -Is that love? -No! -Is that what the Bible teaches? -No! -Is that what I'm talking about? -No! No, because what I'm talking about is the kind of love... ...that calls for a sacrifice. Are you willing to make a sacrifice... ...to show God how much you love him? Yes! To show God how you love him with all of your heart and soul? Yes! -How do we love God? With all our.... -Hearts! -How do we love God? With all our.... -Souls! -Is that what I'm talking about? -Yes! Yes, amen, I say, yes! -Raise your right hand, and say amen! -Amen! -Say amen! -Amen! And you can show God how you love him... ...by digging down deep... ...so that this ministry will reach all of the people of the earth! Because the Bible tells us: ""Show God you love him, and he will show you the way, "" Amen! Now, I'm going to ask all of you to come up. Those of you who haven't come up before... ...I'm going to ask you to come up for God. Shake my hand, and let God see us together. Because the Bible tells us... ...that God knows the falling of a sparrow... ...and the depth of a pocket, and that is what I'm talking about! Amen! Come up, brothers and sisters... ...and put in our hands what you would put in God's hands... ...and he will have the whole world in his hands! ""He's got the whole world in his hands ""He's got the whole world in his hands ""He's got the whole world in his hands ""He's got the whole world..."" May the Lord bless and keep you. It's so good to see you. You can put that right-- Yes, thank you very much. God bless you. May the Lord always bless you and keep you. It's so good to see you. Thank you, please keep moving. -Rev. Williams. -That's all right. He is in need of me. What are you doing here? -God sent me to you. -One moment! Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters... ...this is the young man who has used so much energy... ...to convince everyone that he has seen God. Now, wait! Would you repeat what you just said to me? God sent me to you. God sent him to me! -Are you certain of that? -Yes, I just left him. He wanted me to give you these answers to all of those questions. -God specified me? -Yes. And he also asked me to tell you that he's very unhappy. God is very unhappy. Yes, he's unhappy that you're getting rich this way. And that he'd like you to stop pretending that you're spreading his word. In fact, he suggested that you sell shoes. That's what he said! You're a fake! This poor boy is ill. Get him out of here! Rev. Williams! Slander, Your Honor. Slander, surely, cruel and foul. The Rev. Willie Williams is on the road for God... ...to the tune of 100,000 miles a year. He's a tireless, selfless servant of the Lord. The idea that he'd line his pockets in this pursuit is the unkindest cut of all. Not only is Willie Williams' organization nonprofit... ...he personally pays over six figures in income tax every year. Give him back his honor, Your Honor. Award him the damages we seek from this defendant. A man so out of touch with reality... ...he even tries to smear the good name of a religious giant. A man whom the President of the United States once called... ...""God's own quarterback."" Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Landers, will you come to the bench, please? -You haven't changed your mind? -No, sir. A professional lawyer would be helpful. This is a tough time for you to be alone. I won't be alone, sir. -They're just going to kill you today, Jerry. -We'll see. We're going to lose everything you worked for. lsn't there any way you can say you're sorry? That it was all a big mistake? No, because I'm not, and it wasn't. I just can't believe that God would set me up... ...to get me into all of this trouble. I have to believe that he had a reason... ...and I have to believe that he'll bail me out. And all I want to say is, that young man is out of his mind. And the absolute being, the all-powerful, all-knowing, all-merciful... ...infinite spirit, the supreme soul... ...the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords... ...the infinite, everlasting eternal being... ...last came to you how? As a busboy. Your Honor, I rest my case. You may step down now, Mr. Landers. Call your witnesses, please, Mr. Landers. Yes, Your Honor, I would like to call one witness and one witness only. I'm waiting, Mr. Landers. Yes. Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand the Lord God. I object. The defendant's trying to make a mockery of this proceeding. Your Honor, I was trying to make a point. -What point? -Your Honor... ...when I just asked God to take the stand... ...in that brief moment after I called him, wasn't there a trace of expectation? Just a trace, Your Honor? Wasn't there a hesitation in this room? Didn't you feel it? Didn't we all feel it? It was the possibility that God does exist. And if he exists, he could materialize and sit right in that chair. In that moment, Your Honor, when no one in this room knew... ...what was going to happen next, in that flash of an instant... ...lies the benefit of the doubt you must give me to know that my story is true. And that I spoke exactly as God asked me. Mr. Landers, I cautioned you earlier that legal representation would be helpful. I must now warn you that, in addition to the plaintiff's charges... ...I'm seriously considering citing you with contempt. Amen. For what you apparently thought was a very clever stunt. You're getting deeper and deeper into trouble with this court, Mr. Landers. Excuse me, Your Honor. It's him. Bobbie, it's him. -This is most irregular. -Your Honor, he-- I'll take it from here. May I ask who you are, sir? You better swear me in. You'll never believe it. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? So help me me. So help you you? If it pleases the court, and even if it doesn't please the court... ...I'm God, Your Honor. Order in the court. Your Honor, I'd like permission to question this witness. Sit down, Sonny, I've answered enough questions. He saw me, just like he said. Each word true. The man tried to tell a lie, his tongue would snap off. Which I wouldn't say I could say about everybody. Why is it so hard for you to believe? Is my physical existence any more improbable than your own? What about all that hoo-hah with the devil a while ago, from that movie? Nobody had trouble believing that the devil took over... ...and existed in the little girl. All she had to do was wet the rug... ...throw up some pea soup, and everybody believed. The devil you could believe, but not God? I work in my own way. I don't get inside little children. They got enough to do, just being themselves. I'm not going to go around to every person in the world and say: ""Look, it's me, I want to talk to you."" So I picked one man. One very good man. I told him God lives. I live. He had trouble believing, too, in the beginning. I understood. I'm not sure how this whole miracle business started. The idea that anything connected with me has to be a miracle. Personally, I'm sorry that it did. It makes the distance between us even greater. But if a miracle helps you believe that I am who I say I am... ...I'll give you one, a good one. Let me see. What's my most impressive miracle? Pick a card. -What? -Pick a card, any card. -I don't know what you think you're doing. -A cute little miracle. Go ahead, pick one. -There are no cards there. -Look again. There's nothing miraculous about good sleight of hand. Have you ever seen this one? Yes, I've seen them make cards appear and disappear. As a matter of fact, I once saw a magician make an elephant disappear. Good. Now I'll show you one that you haven't seen. Have to get these shoes fixed. Watch this, Your Honor. I know how hard it is, in these times, to have faith. But maybe if you could have the faith to start with... ...maybe the times would change. You could change them, Think about it. Try, And try not to hurt each other. There's been enough of that. It really gets in the way. I'm a God of very few words, and Jerry's already given you mine. However hopeless, helpless, mixed-up and scary it all gets... ...it can work. If you find it hard to believe in me... ...maybe it would help you to know that I believe in you. Your Honor, I rest my case. What? This court is now recessed. May I see both parties in my chambers, please? Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? So help you you? Where's.... Order in the court. Your Honor, I'd like permission to question this witness. That's all there is. Not one word of what I assume we all assume we heard. Someone must have erased it. Nobody erases tapes anymore. -Then the machine.... -No. Not a thing wrong with it. He said he couldn't be recorded. God, when he first spoke to me, he said it wasn't his real voice I heard. He said he was just using one that I could understand. He did it again today. And there's nothing wrong with your stenotype machine? It took down every word, Your Honor, except now... ...some of them are not on the paper. Don't you see? He wants us all to decide for ourselves... ...whether or not we saw him and heard him. It's what he always said, that everything is up to us. No! There is no proof whatsoever that God was in that courtroom today. No, none whatsoever. -We saw Him! We heard Him! -We did. -He made himself and the cards disappear. -We saw it. On the basis of our common experience here today... ...I can see why you first claimed, and later maintained... ...that you had seen, and been in the actual presence of... ...God. And for that reason, your remarks to the Rev. Williams... ...could be regarded as a divine assignment. I shall rule, therefore, that the charge of slander be dismissed. Sam! Now, if, as you also claim... ...it is God's opinion... ...that we should all make our own decisions... ...and abide by them accordingly... ...then I must also rule that on the basis of the evidence... ...or rather the lack of it... ...that as much as we all may think... ...that what we saw here today was real... ...God did not, in fact, appear here before us. You may, of course, appeal to a higher court. We heard from the highest court. Thank you. -Good-bye, Mister Slavic. -And Jer, we'll send you your picture. -Would you do that? -Sure. Thank you. Hello? -Where are you? -Turn around. How do you like it? I'm going on a trip to spend a little time with animals. I like animals, and sometimes I don't spend enough time with them. -We failed, didn't we? -What are you talking? We did terrific. I gave a message of encouragement, you passed it along, now we'll see. You did good. We both did good. We're covered. You think anybody got the message? Do you think we have enough apples in the world? Apples? We got all the apples we need. You're Johnny Appleseed. You drop a few seeds, and you move on. If the seeds are good, they'll take root. I gave you great seeds, the best. I lost my job, you know. There are other cities, other supermarkets. Everybody thinks I'm a nut. Galileo, Pasteur, Einstein, Columbus. You're in good company. Hold on. Better be going. -Aren't you coming back? -No. -Ever? -When ever comes, we'll see. Sometimes, now and then... ...couldn't we just talk? I'll tell you what. You talk, I'll listen."
